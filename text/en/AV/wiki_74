<text>Jean Henri Gaston Giraud (; 8 May 1938 – 10 March 2012) was a French artist, cartoonist, and writer who worked in the Franco-Belgian &quot;bandes dessinées&quot; (BD) tradition. Giraud garnered worldwide acclaim predominantly under the pseudonym Mœbius (; ) for his fantasy/science-fiction work, and to a slightly lesser extent as Gir (), which he used for the &quot;Blueberry&quot; series and his other Western-themed work. Esteemed by Federico Fellini, Stan Lee, and Hayao Miyazaki, among others, he has been described as the most influential &quot;bande dessinée&quot; artist after Hergé.

His most famous body of work as Gir concerns the &quot;Blueberry&quot; series, created with writer Jean-Michel Charlier, featuring one of the first antiheroes in Western comics, and which is particularly valued in continental Europe. As Mœbius, he achieved worldwide renown (in this case in the English-speaking nations and Japan, as well – where his work as Gir had not done well), by creating a wide range of science-fiction and fantasy comics in a highly imaginative, surreal, almost abstract style. These works include &quot;Arzach&quot; and the &quot;Airtight Garage of Jerry Cornelius&quot;. He also collaborated with &quot;avant garde&quot; filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky for an unproduced adaptation of &quot;Dune&quot; and the comic-book series &quot;The Incal&quot;.

Mœbius also contributed storyboards and concept designs to numerous science-fiction and fantasy films, such as &quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;Tron&quot;, &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, and &quot;The Abyss&quot;. &quot;Blueberry&quot; was adapted for the screen in 2004 by French director Jan Kounen.

==Early life==
Jean Giraud was born in Nogent-sur-Marne, Val-de-Marne, in the suburbs of Paris, on 8 May 1938, as the only child to Raymond Giraud, an insurance agent, and Pauline Vinchon, who had worked at the agency. When he was three years old, his parents divorced and he was subsequently raised by mainly his grandparents, who were living in the neighboring municipality of Fontenay-sous-Bois (much later, when he was an acclaimed artist, Giraud returned to live in the municipality in the mid-1970s, but was unable to buy his grandparents&#x27; erstwhile house). The rupture between mother and father created a lasting trauma that he explained lay at the heart of his choice of separate pen names. A somewhat sickly and introverted child at first, young Giraud found solace after World War II in a small theater, located on a corner in the street where his mother lived, which concurrently provided an escape from the dreary atmosphere in postwar reconstruction-era France. Playing an abundance of American B-movie Westerns, Giraud, frequenting the theater there as often as he was able to, developed a passion for the genre, as did so many other European boys his age in those times.

Around ages 9–10, Giraud started to draw Western comics while enrolled by his single mother as a stop-gap measure in the Saint-Nicolas boarding school in Issy-les-Moulineaux for two years (and where he became acquainted with Belgian comic magazines such as &quot;Spirou&quot; and &quot;Tintin&quot;), much to the amusement of his schoolmates. In 1954, at age 16, he began his only technical training at the École Supérieure des Arts Appliqués Duperré, where he started producing Western comics, though these did not sit well with his conventional teachers. At the college, he befriended other future comic artists Jean-Claude Mézières and . With Mézières in particular, in no small part due to their shared passion for science fiction, Westerns, and the Far West, Giraud developed a close, lifelong friendship, calling him &quot;life&#x27;s continuing adventure&quot; in later life. In 1956, he left art school without graduating to visit his mother, who had married a Mexican in Mexico, and stayed there for nine months.

The experience of the Mexican desert, in particular its endless blue skies and unending flat plains, now seeing and experiencing for himself the vistas that had enthralled him so much when watching Westerns on the silver screen only a few years earlier, left an everlasting, &quot;quelque chose qui m&#x27;a littéralement craqué l&#x27;âme&quot; (&quot;something which literally cracked open my soul&quot;), enduring impression on him, easily recognizable in almost all of his later seminal works. After his return to France, he started to work as a full-time tenured artist for Catholic publisher , to whom he was introduced by Mézières, who had shortly before found employment at the publisher. In 1959–1960, he was slated for military service in, firstly the French occupation zone of Germany, and subsequently Algeria, in the throes of the vicious Algerian War at the time. Fortunately for him, however, he somehow managed to escape frontline duty as he – being the only service man available at the time with a graphics background – served out his military obligations being set to work as illustrator on the army magazine &quot;5/5 Forces Françaises&quot;, besides being assigned to logistic duties. Algeria was Giraud&#x27;s second acquaintance with other, more exotic cultures, and like he did in Mexico, he soaked in the experience, which made another indelible impression on the young man born as a suburban city boy, leaving its traces in his later comics, especially those created as Mœbius.

==Career==

===Western comics===
At 18, Giraud was drawing his own humorous, Morris-inspired, Western comic two-page shorts, &quot;Frank et Jeremie&quot;, for the magazine &quot;Far West&quot;, his first freelance commercial sales. Magazine editor Marijac thought young Giraud was gifted with a knack for humorous comics, but none whatsoever for realistically drawn comics, and advised him to continue in the vein of &quot;Frank et Jeremie&quot;.

====Fleurus (1956–1958)====
Tenured at publisher Fleurus from 1956 to 1958 after his first sales, Giraud did so, but concurrently continued to steadfastly create realistically drawn Western comics (alongside several others of a French historical nature) and illustrations for magazine editorials in their magazines &quot;Fripounet et Marisette&quot;, &quot;Cœurs Vaillants&quot;, and &quot; – all of them of a strong, edifying nature aimed at France&#x27;s adolescent youth – up to a point that his realistically drawn comics had become his mainstay. Among his realistic Westerns was a comic called &quot;Le roi des bisons&quot;&quot; (&quot;King of the Buffalo&quot; – has had an English publication), and another called &quot;Un géant chez lez Hurons&quot; (&quot;A Giant among the Hurons&quot;). Actually, several of his Western comics, including &quot;King of the Buffalo&quot;, featured the same protagonist Art Howell, and these can be considered as Giraud&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; first realistic Western series, as he himself did in effect, since he, save the first one, endowed these stories with the subtitle &quot;&quot;Un aventure d&#x27;Art Howell&quot;. For Fleurus, Giraud also illustrated his first three books. Already in this period, his style was heavily influenced by his later mentor, Belgian comic artist Joseph &quot;Jijé&quot; Gillain, who at that time was &quot;the&quot; major source of inspiration for an entire generation of young, aspiring French comic artists, including Giraud&#x27;s friend Mézières, interested in doing realistically drawn comics. How major Jijé&#x27;s influence was on these young artists, was amply demonstrated by the Fleurus publications these youngsters submitted their work to, as their work strongly resembled each other. For example, two of the books Giraud illustrated for Fleurus, were co-illustrated with Guy Mouminoux, another name of some future renown in the Franco-Belgian comic world, and Giraud&#x27;s work can only be identified, because he signed his work, whereas Mouminoux did not sign his. While not ample, Giraud&#x27;s earnings at Fleurus were just enough to allow him – disenchanted as he was with the courses, prevalent atmosphere, and academic discipline – to quit his art academy education after only two years, though he came to somewhat regret the decision in later life.

====Jijé apprenticeship (1961–1962)====
Shortly before he entered military service, Giraud visited his idol at his home for the first time with Mézières and Mallet, followed by a few visits on his own to see the master at work for himself. In 1961, returning from military service and his stint on &quot;5/5 Forces Françaises&quot;, Giraud, not wanting to return to Fleurus, as he felt that he &quot;had to do something else, if he ever wanted to evolve&quot;, became an apprentice of Jijé on his invitation, after he saw that Giraud had made artistic progress during his stay at &quot;5/5 Forces Françaises&quot;. Jijé was then one of the leading comic artists in Europe and known for his gracious tendency to voluntarily act as a mentor for young, aspiring comic artists, of whom Giraud was but one, going even as far as opening up his family home in Champrosay for days on end for these youngsters which, again, included Giraud. In this, Jijé resembled Belgian comic grandmaster Hergé, but unlike Jijé, Hergé only did so on a purely self-serving commercial basis, never on a voluntarily one. For Jijé, Giraud created several other shorts and illustrations for the short-lived magazine &quot;Bonux-Boy&quot; (1960/61), his first comic work after military service, and his penultimate one before embarking on &quot;Blueberry&quot;. In this period, Jijé used his apprentice for the inks on an outing of his Western series &quot;Jerry Spring&quot; – after whom Giraud had, unsurprisingly, modeled his Art Howell character previously – &quot;The Road to Coronado&quot;, which Giraud inked. Actually, Jijé had intended his promising pupil for the entirety of the story art, but the still-inexperienced Giraud, who was used to working under the relaxed conditions at Fleurus, found himself overwhelmed by the strict time schedules that production for a periodical (&quot;Spirou&quot; in this case) demanded. Conceding that he had been a bit too cocky and ambitious, Giraud stated, &quot;I started the story all by myself, but after a week, I had only finished half a plate, and aside from being soaked with my sweat, it was a complete disaster. So Joseph went on to do the penciling, whereas I did the inks.&quot; Even though Giraud did lose touch with his mentor eventually, he never forgot what &quot;his master&quot; had provided him with, both &quot;aesthetically and professionally&quot;, the fatherless Giraud gratefully stating in later life, &quot;It was as if he had asked me «Do you want me to be your father?», and if by a miracle, I was provided with one, a[n] [comic] artist no less!&quot;.

====Hachette (1962–1963)====
After his stint at Jijé&#x27;s, Giraud was again approached by friend Mézières to see if he was interested to work alongside him as an illustrator on Hachette&#x27;s ambitious multivolume &quot;L&#x27;histoire des civilisations&quot; history reference work. Spurred on by Jijé, who considered the opportunity a wonderful one for his pupil, Giraud accepted. Though he considered the assignment a daunting one, having to create in oil paints from historical objects and imagery, it was, besides being the best-paying job he had ever had, a seminal appointment. At Hachette, Giraud discovered that he had a knack for creating art in gouaches, something that served him well not that much later when creating &quot;Blueberry&quot; magazine/album cover art, as well as for his 1968 side project &quot;Buffalo Bill: le roi des éclaireurs&quot; history book written by , for whom Giraud provided two-thirds of the illustrations in gouache, including the cover. The assignment at Hachette being cut short because of his invitation to embark on &quot;Fort Navajo&quot;, meant he only participated on the first three to four volumes of the book series, leaving the completion to Mézières. In the &quot;Pilote&quot; era, Giraud additionally provided art in gouache for two Western-themed vinyl record music productions as sleeve art, as well as the covers for the first seven outings in the French-language edition of the &quot;Morgan Kane&quot; Western novel series written by Louis Masterson. Much of his Western-themed gouache artwork of this era, including that of &quot;Blueberry&quot;, has been collected in the 1983 artbook &quot;Le tireur solitaire&quot;.

Aside from its professional importance, Giraud&#x27;s stint at Hachette was also of personal importance, as he met Claudine Conin, an editorial researcher at Hachette, and who described her future husband as being at the time &quot;funny, uncomplicated, friendly, a nice boy next-door&quot;, but on the other hand, &quot;mysterious, dark, intellectual&quot;, already recognizing that he had all the makings of a &quot;visionary&quot;, long before others did. Married in 1967, &quot;after&quot; Giraud had become the recognized &quot;Blueberry&quot; artist, the couple had two children, Hélène (b:1970) and Julien (b:1972). Daughter Hélène in particular has inherited her father&#x27;s graphics talents and has carved out a career as a graphics artist in the animation industry, earning her a 2014 French civilian knighthood, the same her father had already received in 1985. Besides raising their children, wife Claudine not only took care of the business aspects of her husband&#x27;s art work, but has on occasion also contributed to it as colorist. The 1976 feminist fantasy short story, &quot;La tarte aux pommes&quot;, was written by her under her maiden name. Additionally, the appearance of a later, major character in Giraud&#x27;s &quot;Blueberry&quot; series, Chihuahua Pearl, was in part based on Claudine&#x27;s looks. The &quot;Mœbiusienne&quot; 1973 fantasy road trip short story &quot;La déviation&quot;, created as &quot;Gir&quot; before the artist fully embarked on his Mœbius career, featured the Giraud family as the protagonists, save Julien.

====&quot;Pilote&quot; (1963–1974)====
In October 1963, Giraud and writer Jean-Michel Charlier started the comic strip &quot;Fort Navajo&quot; for the Charlier-co-founded &quot;Pilote&quot; magazine, issue 210. At this time the affinity between the styles of Giraud and Jijé (who in effect had been Charlier&#x27;s first choice for the series, but who was reverted to Giraud by Jijé) was so close that Jijé penciled several pages for the series when Giraud went AWOL. In effect, when &quot;Fort Navajo&quot; started its run, &quot;Pilote&quot; received angry letters, accusing Giraud of plagiarism, which was however foreseen by Jijé and Giraud. Shirking off the accusations, Jijé encouraged his former pupil to stay the course instead, thereby propping up his self-confidence. The first time Jijé had to fill in for Giraud, was during the production of the second story, &quot;Thunder in the West&quot; (1964), when the still inexperienced Giraud, buckling under the stress of having to produce a strictly scheduled magazine serial, suffered from a nervous breakdown, with Jijé taking on plates 28–36. The second time occurred one year later, during the production of &quot;Mission to Mexico (The Lost Rider)&quot;, when Giraud unexpectedly packed up and left to travel the United States, and, again, Mexico; yet again former mentor Jijé came to the rescue by penciling plates 17–38. While the art style of both artists had been nearly indistinguishable from each other in &quot;Thunder in the West&quot;, after Giraud resumed work on plate 39 of &quot;Mission to Mexico&quot;, a clearly noticeable style breach was now observable, indicating that Giraud was now well on his way to develop his own signature style, eventually surpassing that of his former teacher Jijé, who, impressed by his former pupil&#x27;s achievements, has later coined him the &quot;Rimbaud de la BD&quot;.
The Lieutenant Blueberry character, whose facial features were based on those of the actor Jean-Paul Belmondo, was created in 1963 by Charlier (scenario) and Giraud (drawings) for &quot;Pilote.&quot; While the &quot;Fort Navajo&quot; series had originally been intended as an ensemble narrative, it quickly gravitated towards having Blueberry as its central figure. His featured adventures, in what was later called the &quot;Blueberry&quot; series, may be Giraud&#x27;s best known work in native France and the rest of Europe, before later collaborations with Alejandro Jodorowsky. The early Blueberry comics used a simple line drawing style similar to that of Jijé, and standard Western themes and imagery (specifically, those of John Ford&#x27;s US Cavalry Western trilogy, with Howard Hawk&#x27;s 1959 &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; thrown in for good measure for the sixth, one-shot title &quot;The Man with the Silver Star&quot;), but gradually Giraud developed a darker and grittier style inspired by, firstly the 1970 Westerns &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; and &quot;Little Big Man&quot; (for the &quot;Iron Horse&quot; story-arc), and subsequently by the Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone and the dark realism of Sam Peckinpah in particular (for the &quot;Lost Goldmine&quot; story-arc and beyond). With the fifth album, &quot;The Trail of the Navajos&quot;, Giraud established his own style, and after both editorial control and censorship laws were loosened in the wake of the May 1968 social upheaval in France – the former in no small part due to the revolt key comic artists, Giraud chief among them, staged a short time thereafter in the editorial offices of Dargaud, the publisher of &quot;Pilote&quot;, demanding and ultimately receiving more creative freedom from editor-in-chief René Goscinny – the strip became more explicitly adult, and also adopted a thematically wider range. The first &quot;Blueberry&quot; album penciled by Giraud after he had begun publishing science fiction as Mœbius, &quot;Nez Cassé&quot; (&quot;Broken Nose&quot;), was much more experimental than his previous Western work. While the editorial revolt at Dargaud had effectively become the starting point of the emancipation of the French comic world, Giraud admitted that it also had caused a severe breach in his hitherto warm relationship with the conservative Goscinny, which never fully mended.

Giraud left the series and publisher in 1974, partly because he was tired of the publication pressure he was under in order to produce the series, partly because of an emerging royalties conflict, but &quot;mostly&quot; because he wanted further explore and develop his &quot;Mœbius&quot; alter ego, in particular because Jodorowsky, who was impressed by the graphic qualities of &quot;Blueberry&quot;, had already invited him to Los Angeles to start production design on his &quot;Dune&quot; movie project, and which constituted the first Jodorowsky/Mœbius collaboration. Giraud was so eager to return to the project during a stopover from the United States while the project was in hiatus, that he greatly accelerated the work on the &quot;Angel Face&quot; outing of &quot;Blueberry&quot; he was working on at the time, shearing off weeks from its originally intended completion. The project fell through though, and after he had returned definitely to France later that year, he started to produce comic work under this pseudonym that was published in the magazine he co-founded, &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot;, which started its run in December 1974 and revolutionized the Franco-Belgian comic world in the process.

It was Jodorowsky who introduced Giraud to the writings of Carlos Castaneda, who had written a series of books that describe his training in shamanism, particularly with a group whose lineage descended from the Toltecs. The books, narrated in the first person, related his experiences under the tutelage of a Yaqui &quot;Man of Knowledge&quot; named Don Juan Matus. Castaneda&#x27;s writings made a deep and everlasting impression on Giraud, already open to Native-Mexican folk culture due to his three previous extended trips to the country (he had visited the country a third time in 1972), and it did influence his art as &quot;Mœbius&quot;, particularly in regard to dream sequences, though he was not quite able to work in such influences in his mainstream &quot;Blueberry&quot; comic. Yet, unbeknownst to writer Charlier, he did already sneak in some Castaneda elements in &quot;Nez Cassé&quot;. Castaneda&#x27;s influence reasserted itself in full in Giraud&#x27;s later life, having worked in elements more openly after Charlier&#x27;s death in his 1999 &quot;Blueberry&quot; outing &quot;Geronimo l&#x27;Apache&quot;, and was to become a major element for his &quot;Blueberry 1900&quot;-project, which however, had refused to come to fruition for extraneous reasons.

Even though Giraud had vainly tried to introduce his &quot;Blueberry&quot; co-worker to the writings of Castaneda, Charlier, being of a previous generation, conservative in nature and wary of science fiction in general, never understood what his younger colleague tried to achieve as &quot;Mœbius&quot;. Nonetheless, he never tried to hinder Giraud in the least, as he understood that an artist of Giraud&#x27;s caliber needed a &quot;mental shower&quot; from time to time. Furthermore, Charlier was very appreciative of the graphic innovations Giraud ported over from his work as &quot;Mœbius&quot; into the mainstream &quot;Blueberry&quot; series, most specifically &quot;Nez Cassé&quot;, making him &quot;one of the all-time greatest artists in the comic medium,&quot; as Charlier himself put it in 1982. Artist , who was taken on by Giraud in 1980 for the inks of &quot;La longue marche&quot; (&quot;The Long March&quot;) painted a slightly different picture though. Already recognizing that the two men were living in different worlds, he noted that Charlier was not pleased with Giraud taking on an assistant, afraid that it might have been a prelude to his leaving the series in order to pursue his &quot;experimentations&quot; as Mœbius further. While Charlier was willing to overlook Giraud&#x27;s &quot;philandering&quot; in his case only, he was otherwise of the firm conviction that artists, especially his own, should totally and wholeheartedly devote themselves to their craft, as Charlier had always considered the medium. Even Giraud was in later life led to believe that Charlier apparently &quot;detested&quot; his other work, looking upon it as something akin to &quot;treason&quot;, though his personal experiences with the author was that he had kept an &quot;open mind&quot; in this regard, at least in his case. According to Giraud, Charlier&#x27;s purported stance negatively influenced his son Philippe, causing &quot;their&quot; relationship to rapidly deteriorate into open animosity, after the death of his father.

====Post-&quot;Pilote&quot; (1979–2007)====
Giraud returned to the &quot;Blueberry&quot; series in 1979 with &quot;Nez Cassé&quot; as a free-lancer. Later that year however, the long-running disagreement Charlier and Giraud had with their publishing house Dargaud, the publisher of &quot;Pilote&quot;, over the residuals from &quot;Blueberry&quot; came to a head. They began the Western comic &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot; as a means to put the pressure on Dargaud. It did not work, and Charlier and Giraud turned their back on the parent publisher definitively, leaving for greener pastures elsewhere, and in the process taking all of Charlier&#x27;s other co-creations with them. It would be nearly fifteen years before the &quot;Blueberry&quot; series (and the others) returned to Dargaud after Charlier died. (For further particulars, including the royalties conflict, see: &quot;Blueberry&quot; publication history.) After the first album, &quot;Mississippi River&quot;, first serialized in &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; and for two decades remaining a one-shot, Giraud took on scripting the revitalized series after Charlier had died, while leaving the artwork to .

When Charlier, Giraud&#x27;s collaborator on &quot;Blueberry&quot;, died in 1989, Giraud assumed responsibility for the scripting of the main series, the last outing of which, &quot;Apaches&quot;, released in 2007, became the last title Giraud created for the parent publisher. &quot;Blueberry&quot; has been translated into 19 languages, the first English book translations being published in 1977/78 by UK publisher Egmont/Methuen, though its publication was cut short after only four volumes. The original &quot;Blueberry&quot; series has spun off a prequel series called &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; in the &quot;Pilote&quot;-era (1968–1970), but the artwork was in 1984, when that series was resurrected, left to Colin Wilson and later after the first three original volumes in that series, as well as the Giraud-written, but William Vance-penciled, 1991-2000 intermezzo series called &quot;Marshal Blueberry&quot;. All these series, except &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot;, had returned to the parent publisher Dargaud in late 1993, though Giraud himself – having already left the employ of the publisher in 1974 (see &quot;below&quot;) – had not, instead plying his trade as a free-lancer, explaining the &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot; exception.

While Giraud has garnered universal praise and acclaim for his work as &quot;Mœbius&quot; (especially in the US, the UK and Japan), as &quot;Gir&quot;, &quot;Blueberry&quot; has always remained his most successful and most recognized work in native France itself and in mainland Europe, despite its artist developing somewhat of a love/hate relationship with his co-creation in later life, which was exemplified by his regularly taking extended leaves of absence from it. That &quot;Blueberry&quot; has always remained his primary source of income, allowing him to fully indulge in his artistic endeavors as Mœbius, was admitted as such by Giraud as early as 1979: &quot;If an album of Moebius is released, about 10,000 people are interested. A &quot;Blueberry&quot; album sells at least 100,000 copies [in France],&quot; and as late as 2005, &quot;&quot;Blueberry&quot; is in some ways the &#x27;sponsor&#x27; of Moebius, for years now.&quot;

===Science fiction and fantasy comics===
The &quot;Mœbius&quot; pseudonym, which Giraud came to use for his science fiction and fantasy work, was born in 1963, while he was working on the Hachette project, as he did not like &quot;to work on paintings alone all day&quot;, and &quot;like an alcoholic needing his alcohol&quot; had to create comics. In a satire magazine called &quot;Hara-Kiri&quot;, Giraud used the name for 21 strips in 1963–64 (much of which collected in Epic&#x27;s &quot;Mœbius &quot; – see below). Though Giraud enjoyed the artistic freedom and atmosphere at the magazine greatly, he eventually gave up his work there as &quot;Blueberry&quot;, on which he had embarked in the meantime, demanded too much of his energy, aside from being a better paid job. Magazine editor-in-chief Cavanna was loath to let Giraud go, not understanding why Giraud would want to waste his talents on a &quot;kiddy comic&quot;. Subsequently, the pseudonym went unused for a decade, that is for comics at least, as Giraud continued its use for side-projects as illustrator. In the late 1960s-early 1970s, Giraud provided interior front, and back flyleaf illustrations as Mœbius for several outings in the science fiction book club series &#x27;, a limited edition hardcover series, collecting work from seminal science fiction writers, from French publisher , continuing to do so throughout the 1970s with several additional covers for the publisher&#x27;s &quot;Fiction&quot; (the magazine that introduced Giraud to science fiction at age 16) and &#x27; science fiction magazine and pocket book series. Additionally, this period in time also saw four vinyl record music productions endowed with Mœbius sleeve art. Much of this illustration art has been reproduced in Giraud&#x27;s first art book as Mœbius, aptly entitled &quot;Mœbius&quot;, released in 1980. There actually had also been a personal reason as well for Giraud to suspend his career as Mœbius comic artist; after he had returned from his second trip from Mexico, he found himself confronted with the artist&#x27;s version of a writer&#x27;s block as far as Mœbius comics were concerned, partly because &quot;Blueberry&quot; consumed all his energy. &quot;For eight months I tried, but I could not do it, so I quit&quot;, stated Giraud additionally. Giraud&#x27;s statement notwithstanding though, he did a couple of &quot;Hara-Kiri&quot;esque satirical comic shorts for &quot;Pilote&quot; in the early 1970s, but under the pseudonym &quot;Gir&quot;, most of which reprinted in the comic book &quot;Gir œuvres&quot;: &quot;Tome 1, Le lac des émeraudes&quot;, also collecting shorts he had created for the Fleurus magazines, &quot;Bonux-Boy&quot;, and the late-1960s &quot;TOTAL Journal&quot; magazine.

====&quot;L&#x27;Écho des savanes&quot; (1974)====
In 1974 he truly revived the Mœbius pseudonym for comics, and the very first, 12-page, story he created as such – while on one of his stopovers from America when the &quot;Dune&quot; production was in a lull – was &quot;Cauchemar Blanc&quot; (&quot;White Nightmare&quot;), published in the magazine &quot;L&#x27;Écho des savanes&quot;, issue 8, 1974. The black &amp; white story dealt with the racist murder of an immigrant of North-African descent, and stands out as one of the very few emphatic socially engaged works of Giraud. Bearing in mind Giraud&#x27;s fascination with the Western genre in general and the cultural aspects of Native Americans in particular – and whose plight Giraud had always been sympathetic to – it is hardly a surprise that two later examples of such rare works were Native-American themed. These concerned the 2-page short story &quot;Wounded Knee&quot;, inspired by the eponymous 1973 incident staged by Oglala Lakota, and the 3-page short story &quot;Discours du Chef Seattle&quot;, first published in the artbook &quot;Made in L.A.&quot; (&quot;The Words of Chief Seattle&quot;, in Epic&#x27;s &quot;Ballad for a Coffin&quot;). Giraud suddenly bursting out onto the comic scene as &quot;Mœbius&quot;, caught European readership by surprise, and it took many of them, especially outside France, a couple of years before the realization had sunk in that &quot;Jean Gir[raud]&quot; and &quot;Mœbius&quot; were, physically at least, one and the same artist.

It was when he was brainstorming with the founding editors of the magazine (founded by former &quot;Pilote&quot; friends and co-artists in the wake of the revolt at the publisher, when they decided to strike out on their own), that Giraud came up with his first major Mœbius work, &quot;Le bandard fou&quot; (&quot;The Horny Goof&quot;). Released directly as album (a first for Mœbius comics) in black &amp; white by the magazine&#x27;s publisher, the humorous and satirical story dealt with a law-abiding citizen of the planet Souldaï, who awakens one day, only to find himself with a permanent erection. Pursued through space and time by his own puritanical authorities, who frown upon the condition, and other parties, who have their own intentions with the hapless &quot;bandard&quot;, he eventually finds a safe haven on the asteroid &quot;Fleur&quot; of Madame Kowalsky, after several hilarious adventures. When discounting the as &quot;Gir&quot; signed &quot;La déviation&quot;, it is in this story that Giraud&#x27;s signature, minute &quot;Mœbius&quot; art style, for which he became famed not that much later, truly comes into its own. Another novelty introduced in the book, is that the narrative is only related on the right-hand pages; the left-hand pages are taken up by one-page panels depicting an entirely unrelated cinematographic sequence of a man transforming after he has snapped his fingers. The story did raise some eyebrows with critics accusing Giraud of pornography at the time, but one reviewer put it in perspective when stating, &quot;Peut-être Porno, mais Graphique!&quot;, which loosely translates as &quot;Porn maybe, but Graphic Art for sure!&quot;. In the editorial of the 1990 American edition, Giraud has conceded that he was envious of what his former &quot;Pilote&quot; colleagues had achieved with &quot;L&#x27;Écho des savanes&quot; in regard to creating a free, creative environment for their artists, he had already enjoyed so much back at &quot;Hara-Kiri&quot;, and that it was an inspiration for the endeavor, Giraud embarked upon next.

====&quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; (1974–1982)====

Later that year, after &quot;Dune&quot; was permanently canceled with him definitively returning to France, Giraud became one of the founding members of the comics art group and publishing house &quot;Les Humanoïdes Associés&quot;, together with fellow comic artists Jean-Pierre Dionnet, Philippe Druillet (likewise &quot;Pilote&quot; colleagues) and (outsider) financial director Bernard Farkas. In imitation of the example set by the &quot;L&#x27;Écho des savanes&quot; founding editors, it was therefore as such also an indirect result of the revolt these artists had previously staged at &quot;Pilote&quot;, and whose employ they had left for the undertaking. Together they started the monthly magazine &quot;Métal hurlant&quot; (&quot;Screaming metal&quot;) in December 1974, and for which he had temporarily abandoned his &quot;Blueberry&quot; series. The translated version was known in the English-speaking world as &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, and started its release in April 1977, actually introducing Giraud&#x27;s work to North-American readership. Mœbius&#x27; famous serial &quot;The Airtight Garage&quot; and his groundbreaking &quot;Arzach&quot; both began in &quot;Métal hurlant&quot;. Unlike &quot;Hara-Kiri&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Écho des savanes&quot; though, whose appeal has always remained somewhat limited to the socially engaged satire and underground comic scenes, it was &quot;Métal hurlant&quot; in particular that revolutionized the world of Franco-Belgian &quot;bandes dessinées&quot;, whereas its American cousin left an indelible impression on a generation of not only American comic artists, but on film makers as well, as evidenced below.

Starting its publication in the first issue of &quot;Métal hurlant&quot;, &quot;Arzach&quot; is a wordless 1974–1975 comic, executed directly in color and created as a conscious attempt to breathe new life into the comic genre which at the time was dominated by American superhero comics in the United States, and by the traditional, adolescent oriented &quot;bandes dessinée&quot; in Europe. It tracks the journey of the title character flying on the back of his pterodactyl through a fantastic world mixing medieval fantasy with futurism. Unlike most science fiction comics, it is, save for the artfully executed story titles, entirely devoid of captions, speech balloons and written sound effects. It has been argued that the wordlessness provides the strip with a sense of timelessness, setting up Arzach&#x27;s journey as a quest for eternal, universal truths. The short stories &quot;L&#x27;Homme est-il bon?&quot; (&quot;Is Man Good?&quot;, in issue 10, 1976, after the first publication in &quot;Pilote&quot;, issue 744, 1974, which however woke Giraud up to the &quot;unbearable realization&quot; that he was &quot;enriching&quot; the publisher with his Mœbius work, thereby expediting his departure.), &quot;Ballade&quot; (&quot;The Ballade&quot;, 1977 and inspired by the poem &quot;Fleur&quot; by French poet Arthur Rimbaud), &quot;Ktulu&quot; (issue 33bis, 1978, an H. P. Lovecraft-inspired story) and &quot;Citadelle aveugle&quot; (&quot;The White Castle&quot;, in issue 51, 1980 and oddly enough signed as &quot;Gir&quot;) were examples of additional stories Giraud created directly in color, shortly after &quot;Arzach&quot;. 1976 saw the &quot;Métal hurlant&quot;, issues 7–8, publication of &quot;The Long Tomorrow&quot;, written by Dan O&#x27;Bannon in 1974 during lulls in the pre-production of Jodorowsky&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot;.

His series &quot;The Airtight Garage&quot;, starting its magazine run in issue 6, 1976, is particularly notable for its non-linear plot, where movement and temporality can be traced in multiple directions depending on the readers&#x27; own interpretation even within a single &quot;planche&quot; (page or picture). The series tells of Major Grubert, who is constructing his own multi-level universe on an asteroid named &quot;Fleur&quot; (from the &quot;Bandard fou&quot; universe incidentally, and the first known instance of the artist&#x27;s attempts of tying all his &quot;Mœbius&quot; creations into one coherent &quot;Airtight Garage&quot; universe), where he encounters a wealth of fantastic characters including Michael Moorcock&#x27;s creation Jerry Cornelius.

1978 marked the publication of the 54-page &quot;Les yeux du chat&quot; (&quot;Eyes of the Cat&quot;). The dark, disturbing and surreal tale dealt with a blind boy in a non-descript empty cityscape, who has his pet eagle scout for eyes, which it finds by taking these from a street cat and offering them to his awaiting companion who, while grateful, expresses his preference for the eyes of a child. The story premise originated from a brainstorming session Alejandro Jodorowsky had with his fellows of the Académie Panique, a group concentrated on chaotic and surreal performance art, as a response to surrealism becoming mainstream. Jodorowsky worked out the story premise as a therapy to alleviate the depression he was in after the failure of his &quot;Dune&quot; project and presented the script to Giraud in 1977 during a visit to Paris. Deeming the story too short for a regular, traditional comic, it was Giraud who suggested the story to be told on the format he had already introduced in &quot;Le bandard fou&quot;, to wit, as single panel pages. On recommendation of Jodorowsky, he refined the format by relating the eagle&#x27;s quest on the right-hand pages, while depicting the awaiting boy in smaller single panel left-hand pages from a contra point-of-view. Giraud furthermore greatly increased his already high level of detail by making extensive use of zipatone for the first time. Considered a key and seminal work, both for its art and storytelling, setting Jodorowsky off on his career as comic writer, the art evoked memories of the wood engravings from the 19th century, including those of Gustave Doré, that Giraud discovered and admired in the books of his grandparents when he was living there in his childhood. However, it—like &quot;La déviation&quot;—has remained somewhat of a one-shot in Giraud&#x27;s body of work in its utilization of such a high level of detail. The story, printed on yellow paper to accentuate the black &amp; white art, was originally published directly as a, to 5000 copies limited book edition, gift item for relations of the publisher. It was only after expensive pirate editions started to appear that the publisher decided to make the work available commercially on a wider scale, starting in 1981. Jodorowsky had intended the work to be the first of a trilogy, but that never came to fruition.

In a certain way &quot;Les yeux du chat&quot; concluded a phase that had started with &quot;La Déviation&quot;, and this viewpoint was adhered to by the publisher who had coined the era &quot;Les années Métal Hurlant&quot; on one of its latter-day anthologies. The very first &quot;Mœbius&quot; anthology collection the publisher released as such, was the 1980–1985 &quot;Moebius œuvres complètes&quot; six-volume collection of which two, volumes 4, &quot;La Complainte de l&#x27;Homme Programme&quot; and 5, &quot;Le Désintégré Réintégré&quot; (the two of them in essence comprising an expanded version of the 1980 original), were Mœbius art books. It also concluded a phase in which Giraud was preoccupied in a &quot;characteristic period in his life&quot; in which he was &quot;very somber and pessimistic about my life&quot;, resulting in several of his &quot;Mœbius&quot; stories of that period ending in death and destruction. These included the poetic &quot;Ballade&quot;, in which Giraud killed off the two protagonists, something he came to regret a decade later in this particular case.
In the magazine&#x27;s issue 58 of 1980 Giraud started his famous &quot;L&#x27;Incal&quot; series in his third collaboration with Jodorowsky. However, by this time Giraud felt that his break-out success as &quot;Mœbius&quot; had come at a cost. He had left &quot;Pilote&quot; to escape the pressure and stifling conditions he was forced to work under, seeking complete creative freedom, but now it was increasingly becoming &quot;as stifling as it had been before with &quot;Blueberry&quot;&quot;, as he conceded in 1982, adding philosophically, &quot;The more you free yourself, the more powerless you become!&quot;. How deeply ingrained this sentiment was, was evidenced in a short interview in &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot;, issue 82, later that year, where an overworked Giraud stated, &quot;I will finish the &quot;Blueberry&quot; series, I will finish the &quot;John Difool&quot; [&quot;Incal&quot;] series and then I&#x27;m done. Then I will quit comics!&quot; At the time he had just finished working as storyboard, and production design artist on the Movie &quot;Tron&quot;, something he had enjoyed immensely. Fortunately for his fans, Giraud did not act upon his impulse as history has shown, though he did take action to escape the hectic Parisian comic scene in 1980 by moving himself and his family as far away from Paris as possible in France, and relocated to the small city of Pau at the foothills of the Pyrenees. It was while he was residing in Pau that Giraud started to take an interest in the teachings of Jean-Paul Appel-Guéry, becoming an active member of his group and partaking in their gatherings.

====Tahiti (1983–1984)====
From 1985 to 2001 he also created his six-volume fantasy series &quot;Le Monde d&#x27;Edena&quot;, which has appeared in English as &quot;The Aedena Cycle&quot;. The stories were strongly influenced by the teachings of Jean-Paul Appel-Guéry, and Guy-Claude Burger&#x27;s instinctotherapy. In effect, Giraud and his family did join Appel-Guéry&#x27;s commune on Tahiti in 1983, until late 1984, when the family moved to the United States, where Giraud set up shop first in Santa Monica, and subsequently in Venice and Woodland Hills, California. Giraud&#x27;s one-shot comic book &quot;La nuit de l&#x27;étoile&quot; was co-written by Appel-Guéry, and has been the most visible manifestation of Giraud&#x27;s stay on Tahiti, aside from the artbooks &quot;La memoire du futur&quot; and &quot;Venise celeste&quot;. Concurrently collaborating on &quot;La nuit de l&#x27;étoile&quot; was young artist Marc Bati, also residing at the commune at the time, and for whom Giraud afterwards wrote the comic series &quot;Altor&quot; (&quot;The Magic Crystal&quot;), while in the US. It was under the influence of Appel-Guéry&#x27;s teachings that Giraud conceived a third pseudonym, Jean Gir – formally introduced to the public as &quot;Jean Gir, Le Nouveau Mœbius&quot; in &quot;Venise celeste&quot; (p. 33), though Giraud had by the time of publication already dispensed with the pseudonym himself – which appeared on the art he created while on Tahiti, though not using it for his &quot;Aedena Cycle&quot;. Another member of the commune was Paula Salomon, for whom Giraud had already illustrated her 1980 book &quot;La parapsychologie et vous&quot;. Having to move stateside for work served Giraud well, as he became increasingly disenchanted at a later stage with the way Appel-Guéry ran his commune on Tahiti, in the process dispensing with his short-lived third pseudonym. His stay at the commune though, had practical implications on his personal life; Giraud gave up eating meat, smoking, coffee, alcohol and, for the time being, the use of mind-expanding substances, adhering to his newfound abstinence for the most part for the remainder of his life.

During his stay on Tahiti, Giraud had co-founded his second publishing house under two concurrent imprints, Éditions Gentiane (predominantly for his work as Gir, most notably &quot;Blueberry&quot;) and (predominantly for his work as Mœbius, and not entirely by coincidence named after the series he was working on at the time), together with friend and former editor at Les Humanoïdes Associés, , for the express purpose to release his work in a more artful manner, such as limited edition art prints, art books (&quot;La memoire du futur&quot; was first released under the Gentiane imprint, and reprinted under that of Aedena) and art portfolios. Both men had already released the very first such art book in the Humanoïdes days, and the format then conceived – to wit, a large 30x30cm book format at first, with art organized around themes, introduced by philosophical poetry by Mœbius – was adhered to for later such releases, including &quot;La memoire du futur&quot;.

====Marvel Comics (1984–1989)====

After having arrived in California, Giraud&#x27;s wife Claudine set up Giraud&#x27;s third publishing house Starwatcher Graphics in 1985, essentially the US branch of Gentiane/Aedena with the same goals, resulting in the release of, among others, the extremely limited art portfolio &quot;La Cité de Feu&quot;, a collaborative art project of Giraud with Geoff Darrow (see &quot;below&quot;). However, due to their unfamiliarity with the American publishing world, the company did not do well, and in an effort to remedy the situation Claudine hired the French/American editor couple Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier, whom she had met at the summer 1985 San Diego ComicCon, as translators and editors-in-chief for Starwatcher, also becoming shareholders in the company. Already veterans of the US publishing world (&quot;and&quot; Mœbius fans), it was the Lofficier couple that managed to convince editor-in-chief Archie Goodwin of Marvel Comics to publish most of Moebius&#x27; hitherto produced work on a wider scale in the US—in contrast with the &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; niche market releases by HM Communications in the late 1970s—in graphic novel format trade editions, under its Epic imprint from 1987 to 1994. These incidentally, included three of Mœbius&#x27; latter-day art books, as well as the majority of his &quot;Blueberry&quot; Western comic.

It was for the Marvel/Epic publication effort that it was decided to dispense with the &quot;Jean [Gir]aud&quot;/&quot;Mœbius&quot; dichotomy—until then strictly adhered-to by the artist—as both the artist&#x27;s given name and his &quot;Blueberry&quot; creation were all but unknown in the English speaking world. This was contrary to his reputation as &quot;Mœbius&quot;, already acquired in the &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; days, and from then on used for &quot;all&quot; his work in the English speaking world (and Japan), though the dichotomy remained elsewhere, including native France.

A two-issue &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; miniseries (later collected as &quot;Silver Surfer: Parable&quot;), written by Stan Lee and drawn by Giraud (as Mœbius), was published through Marvel&#x27;s Epic Comics imprint in 1988 and 1989. According to Giraud, this was his first time working under the Marvel method instead of from a full script, and he has admitted to being baffled by the fact that he already had a complete story synopsis on his desk only two days after he had met Stan Lee for the first time, having discussed what Giraud had assumed was a mere proposition over lunch. This miniseries won the Eisner Award for best finite/limited series in 1989. Mœbius&#x27; version was discussed in the 1995 submarine thriller &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; by two sailors pitting his version against those of Jack Kirby, with the main character played by Denzel Washington, emphasizing the Kirby one being the better of the two. Becoming aware of the reference around 1997, Giraud was later told around 2005 by the movie&#x27;s director Tony Scott, that it was he who had written in the dialog as an homage to the artist on behalf of his brother Ridley, a Mœbius admirer, and not (uncredited) script doctor Quentin Tarentino (known for infusing his works with pop culture references) as he was previously led to believe. An amused Giraud quipped, &quot;It&#x27;s better than a big stature, because in a way, I can not dream of anything better to be immortal [than] being in a movie about submarines!&quot;

As a result, from his cooperation with Marvel, Giraud delved deeper into the American superhero mythology and created superhero art stemming from both Marvel and DC Comics, which were sold as art prints, posters or included in calendars, besides becoming featured as comic book covers from both publishers. Even as late as 1997, Giraud had created cover art for two DC comic book outings, &quot;Hardware&quot; (Vol. 1, issue 49, March 1997) and &quot;Static&quot; (Vol. 1, issue 45, March 1997), after an earlier cover for &quot;Marvel Tales&quot; (Vol. 2, issue 253, September 1991). Another project Giraud embarked upon in his &quot;American period&quot;, was for a venture into that other staple of American pop culture, trading cards. Trading card company Comic Images released a &quot;Mœbius Collector Cards&quot; set in 1993, featuring characters and imagery from all over his Mœbius universe, though his Western work was excluded. None of the images were lifted from already existing work, but were especially created by Giraud the year previously.

Although Giraud had taken up residence in California for five years – holding a temporary residence (the O-1 &quot;Extraordinary Ability&quot; category, including the &quot;International Artist&quot; status) visa – he maintained a transient lifestyle, as his work had him frequently travel to Belgium and native France (maintaining a home in Paris), as well as to Japan, for extended periods of time. His stay in the United States was an inspiration for his aptly called &quot;Made in L.A.&quot; art book, and much of his art he had produced in this period of time, including his super hero art, was reproduced in this, and the follow-up art book &quot;Fusions&quot;, the latter of which having seen a translation in English by Epic.

Giraud&#x27;s extended stay in the US, garnered him a 1986 Inkpot Award, an additional 1991 Eisner Award, as well as three Harvey Awards in the period 1988–1991 for the various graphic novel releases by Marvel. It was in this period that Giraud, who had already picked up Spanish as a second language as a result from his various trips to Mexico and his dealings with Jodorowsky and his retinue, also picked up sufficient language skills to communicate in English.

===Later work (1990–2012)===
In late summer 1989, Giraud returned to France, definitively as it turned out, though that was initially not his intent. His family had already returned to France earlier, as his children wanted to start their college education in their native county and wife Claudine had accompanied them to set up home in Paris. However, it also turned out that his transient lifestyle had taken its toll on the marriage, causing the couple to drift apart, and it was decided upon his return to enter into a &quot;living apart together&quot; relationship, which allowed for an &quot;enormous freedom and sincerity&quot; without &quot;demands and frustrations&quot; for both spouses, according to the artist. Additionally, Giraud had met Isabelle Champeval during a book signing in Venice, Italy in February 1984, and entered into a relationship with her in 1987, which resulted in the birth of second son Raphaël in 1989. Giraud&#x27;s marriage with Claudine was legally ended in December 1994, without much drama according to Giraud, as both spouses had realized that &quot;each wanted something different out of life&quot;. Exemplary of the marriage ending without any ill will was, that Claudine was still emphatically acknowledged for her contributions in the 1997 artbook &quot;Blueberry&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;and&quot; the documentary made for the occasion of its release. Giraud and Isabelle were married on 13 May 1995, and the union resulted in their second child, daughter Nausicaa, the same year. For Giraud his second marriage was of such great personal importance, that he henceforth considered his life divided in a pre-Isabelle part and a post-Isabelle part, having coined his second wife &quot;the key to the whole grand design&quot;. Isabelle&#x27;s sister and Giraud&#x27;s sister-in-law, Claire, became a regular contributor as colorist on Giraud&#x27;s latter-day work.

The changes in his personal life were also accompanied with changes in his business holdings during 1988–1990. His co-founded publishing house Gentiane/Aedena went into receivership in 1988, going bankrupt a short time thereafter. The American subsidiary Starwatcher Graphics followed in its wake around the turn of the millennium, partly because it was a shared marital possession of the original Giraud couple and partly because the publication efforts of his work in the United States had run its course. Also in 1988, Giraud sold his shares in Les Humanoïdes Associés to Fabrice Giger, thereby severing his formal ownership ties with that publishing house as well, though it remained the regular publisher of his Mœbius work from the &quot;Métal hurlant&quot; era, including &quot;L&#x27;Incal&quot; and some other later titles such as the sequel to &quot;The Airtight Garage&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Homme du Ciguri&quot; in 1995. Together with Claudine he founded Stardom in 1990, his first true family operated business without any other third-party participation according to Giraud, with the 1525-copy limited mini art portfolio &quot;Mockba - carnet de bord&quot; becoming the company&#x27;s first recorded publication in September the same year. Apart from being a publishing house, it was concurrently an art gallery, located on 27 Rue Falguière, 75015 Paris, organizing themed exhibitions on a regular basis. In 1997, the company was renamed Moebius Production – singular, despite the occasional and erroneous use of the plural, even by the company itself. The company, in both publishing and art gallery iterations, is as of 2023 still being run by Isabelle Giraud who had taken over the function of publishing editor &quot;and&quot; co-ownership from Claudine (explaining the renaming of the company), after the latter&#x27;s marriage with Giraud was dissolved in 1994, and her sister Claire.

The first thing Giraud did creatively upon his return was to finish up on the &quot;Blueberry&quot; album &quot;Arizona Love&quot; on his own after his longtime writing partner Jean-Michel Charlier had died on 10 July 1989. Due to his intimate twenty-five year familiarity with both the series and its writer, it was a foregone conclusion that Giraud would from then on take on the scripting of the main &quot;Blueberry&quot; series as well, especially since it was already agreed upon in the &quot;contracts signed with Jean-Michel&quot; that &quot;the survivor would take over the series&quot;. Stunned by the sudden death of his longtime co-worker though, he could not bring himself to work on the art for &quot;Blueberry&quot; afterwards for nearly five years before he embarked on &quot;Blueberry&quot; again as artist. Giraud stated that the series had lost its &quot;father&quot;, and that the &quot;mother needed time to mourn&quot;. Nonetheless, he did embark on the &quot;Marshal Blueberry&quot; spin-off series in 1990 as writer (leaving the artwork firstly to William Vance and subsequently to ), wanting to pay homage to the legacy of his late writing partner by creating a story in his spirit, or as Giraud had put it, &quot;{A]nd [I] said to myself: Well, I&#x27;m going to see if I&#x27;m able to write a story à la Charlier. So I wrote this scenario, not too bad, but quite traditional, quite classic.&quot; In similar vein, Giraud took up the writing for the other Charlier/Giraud western creation, &quot;Jim Cutlass&quot;, that Charlier had actually been in the process of revitalizing in the year before his death, and for which he had already contracted for the artwork, besides having already started on the scenario. After having added six more volumes to the once one-shot series, the series – which he, as explained above, had published at publisher Casterman instead of (western) house-publisher Dargud – folded in 1999 due to the fact that it was not nearly as commercially successful as &quot;Blueberry&quot; had been.

Under his &quot;Mœbius&quot; pseudonym, Giraud concurrently continued to work on &quot;The Aedena Cycle&quot; and the &quot;Madwoman of the Sacred Heart&quot; trilogy, both of which started in the US and completed in 2001 and 1998 respectively, after which he concentrated on &quot;Blueberry&quot;″s &quot;OK Corral&quot; cycle, started in 1994 upon his return to France. While Giraud was in the midst of &quot;OK Corral&quot; cycle, he also embarked on a new sequel cycle of his acclaimed &quot;Incal&quot; main series, called &quot;Après l&#x27;Incal&quot; (&quot;After the Incal&quot;). Yet, after he had penciled the first outing in the series, &quot;Le nouveau rêve&quot;, he found himself confronted with &quot;too many things that attract me, too many desires in all the senses&quot;, causing him to be no longer able to &quot;devote myself to the &quot;bande dessinée&quot; as befitting a professional in the traditional sense&quot;. Despite repeated pleas to convince Giraud otherwise, it left writer Jodorowsky with no other recourse than to start anew with a new artist. This insight had repercussions though, as Giraud, after he had finished the &quot;OK Corral&quot; cycle in 2005, no longer continued to produce comics and/or art on a commercial base, but rather on a project and/or personal base, usually under the aegis of his own publishing house Mœbius Production.

As Mœbius Production, Giraud published from 2000 to 2010&quot; Inside Mœbius&quot; (French text despite English title), an illustrated autobiographical fantasy in six hardcover volumes totaling 700 pages. Pirandello-like, he appears in cartoon form as both creator and protagonist trapped within the story alongside his younger self and several longtime characters such as Blueberry, Arzak (the latest re-spelling of the &quot;Arzach&quot; character&#x27;s name), Major Grubert (from &quot;The Airtight Garage&quot;) and others.

Jean Giraud drew the first of the two-part volume of the &quot;XIII&quot; series titled &quot;La Version Irlandaise&quot; (&quot;The Irish Version&quot;) from a script by Jean Van Hamme, to accompany the second part by the regular team Jean Van Hamme–William Vance, &quot;Le dernier round&quot; (&quot;The Last Round&quot;). Both parts were published on the same date (13 November 2007) and were the last ones written by Van Hamme before Yves Sente took over the series. The contribution was also a professional courtesy to the series&#x27; artist, Vance, who had previously provided the artwork for the first two titles in the Giraud-written &quot;Marshall Blueberry&quot; spin-off series.

Late in life, Giraud also decided to revive his seminal Arzak character in an elaborate new adventure series; the first (and last in hindsight) volume of a planned trilogy, &quot;Arzak l&#x27;arpenteur&quot;, appeared in 2010. He also added to the &quot;Airtight Garage&quot; series with two volumes entitled &quot;Le chasseur déprime&quot; (2008) and &quot;Major&quot; (2011), as well as the art book &quot;La faune de Mars&quot; (2011), the latter two initially released in a limited, 1000 copy French only, print run by Mœbius Production. By this time, Giraud created his comic art on a specialized graphic computer tablet, as its enlargement features had become an indispensable aid, because of his failing eyesight.

Creating comics became increasingly difficult for Giraud, as his eyesight started to fail him in his last years, having undergone severe surgery in 2010 to stave off blindness in his left eye, and it was mainly for this reason that Giraud increasingly concentrated on creating single-piece art, both as &quot;Gir&quot; and as &quot;Mœbius&quot;, on larger canvases on either commission basis or under the aegis of Mœbius Production. Much of the latter artwork was from 2005 onward, alongside older original art Giraud still had in his possession, sold by the company for considerable prices in specialized comic auctions at such auction houses like Artcurial, Hôtel Drouot and Millon &amp; Associés.

===Illustrator and author===
As already indicated above, Giraud had throughout his entire career made illustrations for books, magazines, music productions (though playing the piano and electric guitar, Giraud was, unlike his second son Raphaël, regrettably not a creative musician himself by his own admission, but did have a lifelong fascination with jazz), but also promotional art for commercial institutions such as banks and corporations. A notable early example of the latter, concerned the &quot;Blueberry&quot; art he created in 1978 for the Spanish jeans manufacturer Lois Jeans &amp; Jackets; Aside from being traditionally run as an advertisement in numerous magazines, it was also blown up to gigantic, mural-like dimensions and as posters plastered on walls and billboards in several places all around Paris. As book illustrator, Giraud illustrated for example the 1987 first edition of the science fiction novel &quot;Project Pendulum&quot; by Robert Silverberg, and the 1994 French edition of the novel &quot;The Alchemist&quot; by Paulo Coelho. The subsequent year Giraud followed up in the same vein as the Coelho novel, with his cover and interior illustrations for a French 1995 reprint of &quot;Ballades&quot; from the French medieval poet François Villon, itself followed by similar work for &#x27;s 2001 new-age novel &quot;La mémoire de l&#x27;âme&quot;. Much of this non-comic art, including the one for Lois has been reproduced in the artbooks that were released over the years.
Giraud was in mid-1990s approached by two video game developers to provide the box cover art for the video games that were released in 1995; the first one concerned the &quot;Fade to Black&quot; video game developed by the US Delphine Software International, whereas the second one concerned &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; video game developed by the Japanese Sega Corporation. And while Giraud was by now the well established Mœbius artist in both countries, he was only asked to contribute the box cover art for the two video game releases, and nothing beyond. A few years later though, he was also asked to contribute to later games as a concept artist.

In 1999, Giraud&#x27;s illustrations appeared in a soft cover edition of Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;La Divina Commedia,&quot; published by the Nuages Gallery in Milan. As &quot;Mœbius&quot; he illustrated the &quot;Paradiso&quot; volume, while the two others, &quot;Inferno&quot; and &quot;Purgatorio&quot;, were illustrated by Lorenzo Mattotti and Milton Glaser respectively. The edition was published under the Mœbius name. Giraud&#x27;s illustrations for &quot;Paradiso&quot; take heavy inspiration from the engravings of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; by Gustave Doré, whose work he had discovered in his grandparents&#x27; library and learned to appreciate in his early formative years, with compositions often approaching an exact match. Giraud acknowledged this influence directly, praising Doré&#x27;s work and remarking how he sometimes literally used tracing paper to sketch compositions. Though another prominent example of Giraud&#x27;s non-comic book work, the influences from his science fiction and fantasy comics shine through. The illustrations, with vivid colors and space-age headresses, are distinctly rendered in the Mœbius mode.

An out-of-the-ordinary latter-day contribution as such, constituted his illustrations as &quot;Mœbius&quot; for the Thursday 6 March 2008 issue of the Belgian newspaper &quot;Le Soir&quot;. His illustrations accompanied news articles throughout the newspaper, providing a &quot;Mœbiusienne&quot; look on events. In return, the newspaper, for the occasion entitled &quot;Le Soir par (by) Mœbius&quot;, featured two half-page editorials on the artist (pp. 20 &amp; 37).

Under the names Giraud, Gir and Mœbius, he also wrote several comics for other comic artists as listed below, and the early ones included Jacques Tardi and Claude Auclair. Aside from writing for other comic artists, he also wrote story outlines for the movies &quot;Les Maîtres du temps&quot;, &quot;Internal Transfer&quot;, &quot;Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland&quot; and &quot; Thru the Moebius Strip&quot; as outlined further down the line.

As author on personal title, Giraud has – apart from his own &quot;bande dessinée&quot; scripts – written philosophical poetry that accompanied his art in his Mœbius artbooks of the 1980s and 1990s. He also wrote the &quot;Story Notes&quot; editorials for the American Epic publications, providing background information on his work contained therein. In 1998, he took time off to write his autobiography, &quot;Moebius-Giraud: Histoire de mon double&quot;.

===Films===
Giraud&#x27;s friend Jean-Claude Mézières has divulged in the 1970s that their very first outing into the world of cinema concerned a 1957 animated Western, unsurprisingly considering their shared passion for the genre, &quot;Giraud, with his newfound prestige because of his trip to Mexico [note: Mézières had wanted to accompany his friend to Mexico, but was not able to raise the money], started a pro career at &quot;Cœurs Valiants&quot;, but together with two other friends we tackled a very ambitious project first: a cartoon western for which Giraud drew the sets and the main characters. Alas, rather disappointingly, we had to stop after only 45 seconds!&quot; Any further movie aspirations Giraud, who himself had considered the effort &quot;too laborious&quot;, might have had entertained had to wait until he received the 1974 invitation of Alejandro Jodorowsky to work on his planned adaptation of Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot;, which was however abandoned in pre-production. &quot;Jodorowsky&#x27;s Dune&quot;, a 2013 American-French documentary directed by Frank Pavich, explores Jodorowsky&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt. Giraud, a non-English speaker at the time, later admitted that the prospect of moving over to Los Angeles filled him with trepidation, initially causing him to procrastinate. It was friend Philippe Druillet (with whom he would co-found Les Humanoïdes Associés later that year) who pushed him to up and go, which he did by going AWOL again from his job at &quot;Pilote&quot;. Giraud was grateful for Druillet pushing him as he found that he reveled in his first Hollywood experience. The project took nine months before it fell apart, but Giraud&#x27;s presence was not always required, giving him ample time to return to France on several occasions, to pursue his other work, such as his work for &quot;L&#x27;Écho des savanes&quot; and, most importantly, to firstly finish up on &quot;Blueberry&quot;″s &quot;Angel Face&quot;, which he ultimately did in record time, this time formally quitting &quot;Pilote&quot; afterwards.

Despite Jodowowsky&#x27;s project falling through, it had attracted the attention of other movie makers. One of them was Ridley Scott who managed to reassemble a large part of Jodorowsky&#x27;s original creative team, including Giraud, for his 1979 science fiction thriller &quot;Alien&quot;. Hired as a concept artist, Giraud&#x27;s stay on the movie lasted only a few days, as he had obligations elsewhere. Nonetheless, his designs for the Nostromo crew attire, and their spacesuits in particular, were almost one-on-one adopted by Scott and appearing onscreen as designed, resulting in what Giraud had coined &quot;two weeks of work and ten years of fallout in media and advertising&quot;. Scott did explicitly acknowledge &quot;Mœbius&quot; for his contributions in the special features for the movie in the &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot; home media collection. Scott was taken with Giraud&#x27;s art, having cited &quot;The Long Tomorrow&quot; as an influence on his second major movie &quot;Blade Runner&quot; of 1982 (see &quot;below&quot;), and invited him again for both this, and his subsequent third major movie &quot;Legend&quot; of 1985, which Giraud had to decline in both cases for, again, obligations elsewhere. He especially regretted not having been able to work on the latter movie, having deemed it &quot;very good&quot;, and it was still on his mind as late as 2010, as he directly referred to the movie when he made his &quot;unicorn&quot; statement regarding his legacy, quoted below.

1981 saw the release of the animated film &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, produced by Ivan Reitman. The heavily &quot;Arzach&quot;-inspired last, &quot;Taarna&quot;, section of the movie, has led to the persistent misconception, especially held in the United States, that Giraud had provided characters and situations for the segment, albeit uncredited. Giraud however, had already emphatically squashed &quot;that&quot; particular misconception himself on an early occasion, &quot;I had absolutely nothing to do with it,&quot; stated the artist in 1982, &quot;Sure, the people who made the movie were inspired by quite a few things from &quot;Arzach&quot;,&quot; further explaining that, while the American producers &quot;had&quot; indeed intended to use the artist&#x27;s material from the eponymous magazine, there were legalities involved between the American and French mother magazines, because the latter had financial interests in Laloux&#x27;s below mentioned &quot;Les Maîtres du temps&quot; that was concurrently in development, and in which Giraud &quot;was&quot; very much involved with. The American producers went ahead regardless of the agreements made between them and &quot;Métal hurlant&quot;. While not particularly pleased with the fact, Giraud was amused when third parties wanted to sue the Americans on his behalf. Giraud however, managed to convince his editor-in-chief Jean-Pierre Dionnet (one of his co-founding friends of &quot;Métal hurlant&quot;) to let the issue slide, as he found &quot;all that fuss with lawyers&quot; not worth his while, aside from the incongruous circumstance that the French magazine was running advertisements for the American movie.

Still, &quot;Alien&quot; led to two other movie assignments in 1982, this time as both concept and storyboard artist. The first one concerned the Disney science fiction movie &quot;Tron&quot;, whose director Steven Lisberger specifically requested Giraud, after he had discovered his work in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; magazine. The second assignment concerned Giraud&#x27;s collaboration with director René Laloux to create the science fiction feature-length animated movie &quot;Les Maîtres du temps&quot; (released in English as &quot;Time Masters&quot;) based on a novel by Stefan Wul. He and director Rene Laloux shared the award for Best Children&#x27;s Film at the Fantafestival that year. For the latter, Giraud was also responsible for the poster art and the comic adaption of the same title, with some of his concept and storyboard art featured in a &quot;making-of&quot; book to boot. Excepting &quot;Les Maîtres du temps&quot;, Giraud&#x27;s movie work had him travel to Los Angeles for longer periods of time.
Outside his actual involvement with motion pictures, Giraud was in this period of time also occasionally commissioned to create poster art for, predominantly European, movies. Movies for which Giraud, also as &quot;Mœbius&quot;, created poster art included, &quot;Touche pas à la femme blanche !&quot; (1974 as Gir, three 120x160 cm versions), &quot;S*P*Y*S&quot; (1974, unsigned, American movie but poster art for release in France), &#x27; (1975, unsigned), &quot;Les Chiens&quot; (1979 as Mœbius, rejected, used as cover for &quot;Taboo 4&quot;), &quot;Tusk&quot; (1980 as Giraud, a Jodorowsky film), and &#x27; (1983 as Mœbius).

As his two 1982 movies coincided with the end of his &quot;Métal hurlant&quot; days and his departure for Tahiti shortly thereafter, this era can be seen as Giraud&#x27;s &quot;first Hollywood period&quot;, especially since the next project he embarked on entailed a movie in which he was very much invested as initiator, writer and producer as well, contrary to the movies he hitherto had worked upon as a gun-for-hire.

While Giraud was residing in Appel-Guéry&#x27;s commune, he, together with Appel-Guéry and another member of the commune, Paula Salomon, came up with a story premise for a major animated science fiction movie called &quot;Internal Transfer&quot;, which was endowed with the English title &quot;Starwatcher&quot; – after which Giraud&#x27;s American publishing house was named. Slated for the production was Arnie Wong, whom Giraud had met during the production of &quot;Tron&quot; (and, incidentally, one of the animators of the vaunted &quot;Taarna&quot; segment of the &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; movie), and it was actually Disney whom Giraud offered the production first. Disney, at the time not believing in the viability of such a production in animation, declined. Another member of the commune fronted some of the money for the project to proceed, and the production was moved to Wong&#x27;s animation studio in Los Angeles. It was this circumstance that provided Giraud with his alibi to leave Appel-Guéry&#x27;s commune and settle in California – and the reason why he had to decline Ridley Scott for his &quot;Legend&quot; movie. Much to Giraud&#x27;s disappointment and frustration though, the project eventually fell apart for several extraneous reasons, most notably for lack of funding, as related above by the artist. Still, the concept art he provided for the project served as the basis for his first collaboration with Geof Darrow, whom he had also met previously on the production of &quot;Tron&quot;, on their 1985 &quot;City of Fire&quot; art portfolio. Some of the concept art was reprinted in the art book &quot;Made in L.A.&quot;.

Yet, despite this failure to launch, it did lead to his, what can be considered, &quot;second Hollywood period&quot; in his &quot;American period&quot;. Concurrent with his career as a comic artist in the United States, invitations followed to participate as concept artist on &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; (1987), &quot;Willow&quot; (1988), &quot;The Abyss&quot; (1989), and finally Yutaka Fujioka&#x27;s Japanese animated feature film &quot;Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland&quot; (1989), for which he was not only the conceptual designer, but also the story writer. It was for this movie that Giraud resided in Japan for an extended period of time. Giraud followed up on his involvement with &quot;Little Nemo&quot; by writing the first two outings of the 1994-2000 French graphic novel series of the same name, drawn by .

His definitive return to France in 1989 marked the beginning of Giraud&#x27;s third and last movie period. In January 1992, the French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot; reported on a computer animated movie that was under development at the company Vidéosystem. It actually concerned a second attempt to get &quot;Starwatcher&quot; on the silver screen, but just like its 1984 predecessor, it eventually failed to come to fruition. Afterwards, Giraud made original character designs and did visual development for Warner Bros.&#x27; partly animated 1996 movie &quot;Space Jam&quot;. 1997 saw his participation as concept artist on Luc Besson&#x27;s science fiction epic &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, which was of great personal importance for Giraud as it meant working together with his lifelong friend Jean-Claude Mézières, coming full circle after their very first aborted 1957 attempt at creating a motion picture. The 2005 documentary made for this occasion was testament to the great friendship both men had for each other. Concurrently, Giraud&#x27;s oldest child, daughter Hélène, was employed on the movie in a similar function, albeit uncredited, though Giraud had stated with fatherly pride, &quot;Yes, she had cooperated in a truly engaged manner. She started at the crack of dawn, and only went home in the evening, after the whole team had stopped working.&quot; Giraud&#x27;s experience on the movie was however somewhat marred by the 2004 lawsuit publisher Les Humanoïdes Associés (ostensibly on his behalf like the earlier 1981 intent which Giraud had then successfully prevented) and Alejandro Jodorowsky leveled against Besson for alleged plagiarism of &quot;L&#x27;Incal&quot;, a lawsuit they lost.

2005 saw the release of the Chinese movie &quot;Thru the Moebius Strip&quot;, based on a story by Giraud who also served as the production designer and the co-producer, and which reunited him with Arnie Wong, whereas his stint as concept designer on the 2012 animated science fiction movie &quot;Strange Frame&quot;, has become Giraud&#x27;s final recorded motion picture contribution.

====Movie adaptations====
In 1991 his graphic novel short, &quot;Cauchemar Blanc&quot;, was cinematized by Mathieu Kassovitz, winning Kassovitz (but not Giraud) two film awards. With &quot;, Giraud saw his ambitions as a full-fledged animation movie maker at least in part fulfilled. A 2002 series for French television broadcaster France 2, it consisted of fourteen four minute long animated vignettes, based on Giraud&#x27;s seminal character, for which he did the writing, drawings and co-production. Young daughter Nausicaa had voice-over appearances in three of the episodes together with her father.

&quot;The Lost Dutchman&#x27;s Mine&quot; story cycle of the &quot;Blueberry&quot; series was adapted for the screen in 2004, by Jan Kounen, as &quot;Blueberry: L&#x27;expérience secrète&quot;. Three prior attempts to bring &quot;Blueberry&quot; to the silver screen had fallen through two decades earlier; in 1986 Charlier disclosed how American actor Martin Kove had actually already been signed to play the titular role – with whom Kove shared a remarkable resemblance at the time – for the first two early-1980s attempts, which were both based on the &quot;Confederate Gold&quot; cycle. It was Kove who introduced the two Blueberry creators to would-be American film producers on both occasions. The first attempt failed because American producers intended a complete script rewrite turning Blueberry into a completely unrecognizable standard western. The second attempt suffered even worse as its American producer, &quot;inspired&quot; by the success of the 1981 movie &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, wanted to turn the project into a &quot;Raiders&quot; 2.0, set in the Yucatán peninsula, complete with Aztec warriors and pyramids and featuring a daring escape in a zeppelin-type airship. Helped by his background in law, an aghast Charlier instructed Giraud to sabotage the project as much as possible and the &quot; Blueberry&quot; creators eventually managed to buy back the rights for US$30,000. Already mentioned by Charlier in his 1986 interview, Kove had even traveled to Europe to shoot some test-footage scenes from the comic series in this role in order to entice potential investors, and that some of it was still in his possession as it turned out decades later. Convinced that the project was a viable one, Kove has also revealed in 2014 that he, together with the two &quot;Blueberry&quot; creators, tried to save it by putting up his own money as well when the project was falling apart due to arguments about funding among European/American would-be producers – to no avail however, which was a slightly different version of events as had been related by Charlier. The third (and last) attempt concerned a European only endeavor, which had at one point actually involved Sergio Leone, according to Charlier, and was actually conceived as a television movie series and slated to be produced by the Swiss/French/Belgian production/distribution company Technisonor, more faithfully adhering – than the later 2004 film adaptation – to the main comic series and intended to span the &quot;Iron Horse&quot; through the &quot;Rehabilitation&quot; story cycles. That 1983 attempt petered out without so much as a whimper, most likely due to lack of interest on the part of European investors.

2010 saw the adaptation of &quot;La planète encore&quot; (&quot;The Still Planet&quot;), a short story from the &quot;Le Monde d&#x27;Edena&quot; universe – and which had won him his 1991 Eisner Award – into an animated short. Moebius Production served as a production company, with Isabelle Giraud serving as one of its producers. Giraud himself was one of the two directors of the short and it premiered at the «Mœbius transe forme» exposition at the Fondation Cartier pour l&#x27;art contemporain in Paris.

In November 2021 it was announced Oscar winner Taika Waititi would direct the screen adaptation of Jodorowsky/Moebius&#x27;s graphic novel The Incal and co-write the script with frequent collaborators Jemaine Clement and Peter Warren.

===Video games===

Two years after he had provided box cover art for two video games, Giraud was approached for more substantial video game contributions when developer Arxel Tribe asked Giraud to become a concept designer for their 1997 &quot;&quot; game they had in development. It actually reunited Giraud with Paulo Coelho on whose 1987 work &quot;The Pilgrimage&quot; the game was based and who also responsible for its adaptation, and for whom Giraud had illustrated his &quot;Alchemist&quot; French-edition novel three years earlier. As Mœbius, Giraud designed among others the costumes for the game.

Seven years later the Japanese 2004 video game &quot;Seven Samurai 20XX&quot; was released for which Giraud was asked to provide the character concept designs. This was his last known video game contribution.

Essentially, the work he had been asked to perform for these two video games, did not differ that much from the movie work Giraud had done since the 1979 movie &quot;Alien&quot; in a near-similar function.

===Exhibitions===

Part of the &quot;many desires&quot; that increasingly attracted Giraud later in life, steering him away from creating traditional &quot;bandes dessinées&quot;, was his personal fascination and involvement with the many exhibitions dedicated to his work, that started to proliferate from the mid-1990s onward not only in native France, but internationally as well, causing him to frequently travel abroad, among others to Japan, for extended periods of time, with the prestigious high-profile 2010 «Mœbius transe forme» exposition in Paris becoming the apotheosis.

===Stamps===
In 1988 Giraud was chosen, among 11 other winners of the prestigious Grand Prix of the Angoulême Festival, to illustrate a postage stamp set issued on the theme of communication.

==Style==
Giraud&#x27;s working methods were various and adaptable ranging from etchings, white and black illustrations, to work in colour of the ligne claire genre and water colours. Giraud&#x27;s solo &quot;Blueberry&quot; works were sometimes criticized by fans of the series because the artist dramatically changed the tone of the series as well as the graphic style. However, &quot;Blueberry&quot; early success was also due to Giraud&#x27;s innovations, as he did not content himself with following earlier styles, an important aspect of his development as an artist.

To distinguish between work by Giraud and Moebius, Giraud used a brush for his own work and a pen when he signed his work as Moebius. Giraud was known for being an astonishingly fast draftsman.

His style has been compared to the &quot;Nouveaux réalistes&quot;, exemplified in his turn from the bowdlerized realism of Hergé&#x27;s Tintin towards a grittier style depicting sex, violence and moral bankruptcy.

Aided with the use of mind-expanding substances in the first part of his career, Giraud had cultivated various New Age type philosophies throughout his career, such as Guy-Claude Burger&#x27;s instinctotherapy, which influenced his creation of the comic book series &quot;Le Monde d&#x27;Edena&quot;. However, he dispensed with the use of drugs for the time being himself – though not condemning them, quite the contrary, as Giraud considered them a gateway to a hidden dreamworld ever since he was introduced in 1974 to the writings of Carlos Castaneda, and having started again with the use of marijuana in the last decade of his life, after a long abstinence – and outside teachers, or &quot;gurus&quot; as he himself had coined them, after his stay on Tahiti, instead continuing to seek deeper truths within himself on his own accord. However, it also negatively influenced his relationship with Philippe Charlier, heir and steward of his father&#x27;s &quot;Blueberry&quot; co-creation and legacy, who had no patience whatsoever with Giraud&#x27;s New Age predilections, particularly for his admitted fondness for mind-expanding substances. As 50% brand co-owner, Charlier jr. has vetoed several later &quot;Blueberry&quot; project proposals by Giraud, the aforementioned &quot;Blueberry 1900&quot; project in particular, precisely for these reasons, as they were to prominently feature, Castaneda inspired, substance-induced scenes, going even as far as to (successfully) threaten Giraud with a lawsuit to thwart his intentions.

In the documentary &quot;MetaMoebius&quot; (2010), Giraud claims his different styles may stem from his short-sightedness. When drawing without glasses he is more attuned to fine details but disconnected from the external world, but when drawing with glasses on he does not get into details but is more aware of the big picture. He often starts with glasses on to have a global perspective then later continues without glasses.

==Death==
Giraud died in Montrouge, on 10 March 2012, aged 73, after a long battle with cancer. His death was expedited by a lymphoma-induced pulmonary embolism. Fellow comic artist François Boucq (incidentally, the artist pegged by Giraud in person for the artwork of the canceled &quot;Blueberry 1900&quot; project) stated that Mœbius was a &quot;master of realist drawing with a real talent for humour, which he was still demonstrating with the nurses when I saw him in his hospital bed a fortnight ago&quot;. Giraud was buried on 15 March, in the Montparnasse Cemetery, after the funeral services, held in the Saint Clotilde Basilica. Many friends and representatives from the Franco-Belgian comic world and beyond attended the services, mirroring Giraud&#x27;s entire career in the industry. The French government was represented by its Minister of Culture, Frédéric Mitterrand, nephew of the former President of France François Mitterrand, who had personally awarded Giraud with his first civilian knighthood twenty-seven years earlier. Giraud left his estate to his second wife Isabelle and his four children.

===Biography===
Throughout his entire career, Jean Giraud gave numerous interviews both in Europe as well as in the United States, but it is the series of interview sessions conducted over the course of four decades by comics journalist Numa Sadoul that stand out for its all encompassing scope of Giraud&#x27;s entire career. Sadoul took a particular interest in the artist and followed the career of Giraud closely from the mid-1970s onward until the latter&#x27;s death in 2012, conducting extensive in-depth interviews with the artist throughout this period of time with approximate two-decade intervals, which resulted in three consecutive, chronologically organized interview books, &quot;Mister Mœbius et Docteur Gir&quot; (1976), &quot;Mœbius: Entretiens avec Numa Sadoul&quot; (1991), and &quot;Docteur Mœbius et Mister Gir: Entretiens avec Jean Giraud&quot; (2015, see &quot;below&quot; for bibliographical details on all editions), the latter two being each an edited, updated and expanded version of the previous one – and each title incidentally, featuring an entirely different selection of art. Excepting parts of the first book in &quot;SCHTROUMPF: Les cahiers de la BD&quot; (issue 25, July 1974), none of the later interviews had seen prior magazine publication, be it in part or in whole. The &quot;SCHTROUMPF&quot; interview excerpt, was by Giraud poured into a humorous eight-page autobiographical black &amp; white comic (pp. 8–16). The comic, entitled &quot;Entretien avec Jean Giraud&quot;, or &quot;Mœbius Circa &#x27;74&quot; as it is known in English, was however only reprinted in the 2015 edition of Sadoul&#x27;s book as a preface (but omitted from the 2023 English translation of that edition), and in hindsight a precursor to Giraud&#x27;s autobiographical &quot;Inside Mœbius&quot; comic books. The similarity had not been lost on the artist himself, after he had embarked on the &quot;Inside Mœbius&quot; series and realized, &quot;&quot;Merde&quot;, that is exactly like the comic I have done with Numa!&quot;

Noteworthy were the testimonials Sadoul collected from seminal persons in Giraud&#x27;s life and career which included among others his mother, first wife Claudine (of these two the only known published ones), his mentor Jijé and many others, as well as the fact that Giraud spoke more freely about the aspects of his life and career (including the more contentious ones, such as his mind-expanding substance use and his extremely strained relationship with the aforementioned Philippe Charlier, which had over time deteriorated into open hatred) than was commonplace in his more generic interviews, or even in his own, hereafter mentioned, autobiography. For editorial reasons, Sadoul omitted some of the outside testimonials from the second edition for his third. In the third installment (2023, pp. 254-255), Giraud also openly discussed his fear of a painful death because of his progressing cancer.

Posthumously published, the 2015 title was fully sanctioned and endorsed by Giraud&#x27;s widow Isabelle (who provided a foreword – praising Sadoul for his friendship and tenacity – family pictures, privately created art and additional details on her husband&#x27;s last two years of his life) and has therefore become the closest approximation of an &quot;official biography&quot; of the artist when discounting his own &quot;Inside Moebius&quot; autobiographical comic &quot;and&quot; his precursory text autobiography &quot;Histoire de mon double&quot;. The latter, published as an unillustrated paperback in 1999 was the &quot;biography written by Giraud on Mœbius &amp; vice versa&quot;, but constituted what Sadoul in his 2015 edition has coined a &quot;snapshot in time&quot;, aside from the obvious fact that the last phase of the artist&#x27;s career was not covered. Giraud himself considered his &quot;enhanced&quot; autobiography on which he had worked for a year, a &quot;funny&quot; piece of work, conceding that accuracy was left to be desired as he could not be bothered to correct mistakes made therein, finding &quot;flavor&quot; in the small inaccuracies, and also admitting that he gave his work only a cursory glance afterwards.

Author Sadoul accounted for his work in the introduction of the 2015 edition where he summarized that the interviews for the first edition took three days in March 1974 and in August and September 1975 – and thus shortly &quot;before&quot; Giraud achieved fame in his second &quot;Mœbius&quot; career – at the artist&#x27;s home in Fontenay-sous-Bois. Having kept more detailed records, the second edition took in total 19 hours and 45 minutes of interviews conducted between 18 and 21 October 1988 at Sadoul&#x27;s home in Cagnes-sur-Mer (for which Giraud and his future wife Isabelle especially traveled from Paris), augmented with an additional two hours at Giraud&#x27;s home in Paris on 17 August 1989. The third edition accounted for a further 10 hours and 48 minutes worth of interviews, conducted between 15 September 2000 and 28 December 2011, either at Giraud&#x27;s home in Paris or over the telephone. Sadoul acknowledged that the three series of interview sessions were snapshots in time of Giraud&#x27;s life and career, causing the artist to occasionally contradict himself in later life – something Giraud himself actually addressed in a humorous fashion in his &quot;Inside Moebius&quot; comics by regularly confronting his older self with his younger versions – , but chose not to redact or edit such earlier made statements (at most adding short, clarifying editorial annotations), instead transcribing these exactly as made at the time. Sadoul&#x27;s reasoning was that by doing so, it reflected truthfully the spiritual development the artist had undergone throughout his career.

Despite the worldwide renown Giraud/Mœbius has acquired, Sadoul&#x27;s biography has until late-2023 only seen two other-language editions, a German 2nd edition, and a Japanese 3rd edition release (also see &quot;below&quot; for bibliographic details). It has limited the appeal of the book as none of the three languages are all that easily accessible to the wider readership beyond the three respective language areas alone. Yet, a more universally accessible 3rd edition English-language release had already been solicited by Dark Horse as early as 12 May 2020. Dark Horse however, kept postponing the release at such a recurring frequency, that fans started to consider the solicitation a bad running gag by Dark Horse and began to wonder if the title would even be released at all. In 2021, after the umpteenth postponement of the release, translator Edward Gauvin, stumbled upon that restarted discussion on the Reddit newsite, and took it upon himself to clarify the reasons for the continuous release delays. He explained that firstly, regular Dark Horse translator for Mœbius works, Diana Schutz, had been temporarily disabled by a wrist operation, and that it took time to find a replacement. Secondly, a first draft was only delivered by Gauvin in late 2019, but the COVID-19 pandemic subsequently threw all kinds of monkey wrenches into Dark Horse&#x27;s release plans. Thirdly, after Gauvin had submitted his final draft in early 2021, he was asked by Dark Horse to compile a glossary of end-notes for the book, explaining the in the interview sessions casually dropped &quot;bande dessinée&quot; names and terminology to a US/UK readership, much like Schutz had done for her three-volume &quot;Inside Moebius&quot; translations. The substantial extra editorial work required by that late Dark Horse request only served to add to the series of release delays. The English-language edition of the book was ultimately released on 13 December 2023 after all.

A more traditional first-time biography, titled &quot;Jean Giraud alias Mœbius&quot;, by French &quot;BD&quot; publicist Christophe Quillien was shortly afterwards published on 17 May 2024.

==Influence and legacy==
Long before his death Giraud had already been coined &quot;the most influential &quot;bandes dessinées&quot; artist after Hergé&quot; by several academic comic scholars, and many artists from around the world have cited him as a major influence on their work. Testament to this was the publication of two special homage issues of the French comic journals &#x27; (Hors Série 3) and &#x27; (Hors Série 09) a month after Giraud&#x27;s death. The original &quot;Chihuaha Pearl&quot; album-cover-endowed 84-page &quot;Casemate&quot; issue featured, aside from an elaborate in-memoriam overview of Giraud&#x27;s life and career, testimonials from 89 predominantly European comic artists, who often had their testimonials accompanied with their own Giraud/Mœbius-themed art made for the occasion. For the 96-page &quot;dBD&quot; issue, which came in two cover variants, &quot;Giraud, mort d&#x27;un géant&quot; (&quot;Giraud, death of a giant&quot;) and &quot;Mœbius, Adieu à l&#x27;immortel&quot; (&quot;Mœbius: Farewell to an immortal&quot;), over 100 comic artists, this time added with international overseas artists, contributed art as tribute to the deceased artist. In January 2013, a similarly executed 64-page homage reverse double cover journal, became the first issue of the newly launched &quot;Tonnerre De Bulles!&quot; comics journal as issue Hors Série 1, which was followed by a similar 76-page Gir/Mœbius-themed double cover issue (Hors Série 5) in October 2015. Both issues were limited to 650 copies.

The testimonials quoted below, gathered from a myriad of other sources, are but a small and far from complete, random selection of all the accolades given to the artist, and presented in no particular order;

*Giraud was longtime friends with manga author and anime filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki. Giraud even named his daughter Nausicaa after the character in Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot;. Asked by Giraud in an interview how he first discovered his work, Miyazaki replied,
&quot;Through &quot;Arzach&quot;, which dates from 1975, I believe. I only read it in 1980, and it was a big shock. Not only for me. All manga authors were shaken by this work. Unfortunately, when I discovered it, I already had a consolidated style so I couldn&#x27;t use its influence to enrich my drawing. Even today, I think it has an awesome sense of space. I directed &quot;Nausicaä&quot; under Mœbius&#x27;s influence.&quot;

*Mike Mignola, creator of &quot;Hellboy&quot;, has stated upon seeing &quot;Arzach&quot;,
&quot;I fell out of love with American comics, lost interest in the super-hero subject matter, was more interested in the fantasy I saw in the European art.&quot;

*Pioneering cyberpunk author William Gibson said of Giraud&#x27;s &quot;The Long Tomorrow&quot; work,
&quot;So it&#x27;s entirely fair to say, and I&#x27;ve said it before, that the way Neuromancer-the-novel &quot;looks&quot; was influenced in large part by some of the artwork I saw in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;. I assume that this must also be true of John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Escape from New York&quot;, Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, and all other artefacts of the style sometimes dubbed &#x27;cyberpunk&#x27;. Those French guys, they got their end in early.&quot;

*&quot;The Long Tomorrow&quot; also came to the attention of Ridley Scott and was a key visual reference for &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. Having previously cooperated with the artist on his 1979 sci-fi thriller &quot;Alien&quot;, Scott stated as late as 2010 on Mœbius&#x27; influence on contemporary science fiction movies,
&quot;You see it everywhere, it runs through so much you can&#x27;t get away from it.&quot;

*Comic artist, publisher and editor Stephen R. Bissette, responsible for the first-time publication of &quot;Les yeux du chat&quot; in English, had it recorded that,
&quot;When I first saw the work of &#x27;Mœbius&#x27; – a.k.a. &#x27;Gir&#x27;, both noms de plume of Jean Giraud – his fresh science-fiction and fantasy comic art forever altered my perception of the comic medium.&quot;

*George Lucas, who had invited Giraud to work with him on his 1988 fantasy movie &quot;Willow&quot;, wrote in the foreword of the 1989 &quot;The Art of Mœbius&quot; art book,
&quot;In all his drawings, Mœbius demonstrates a command of many disciplines in art. He is a master draftsman, a superb artist, and more: his vision is original and strong. Since first seeing the Mœbius illustrations in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; years ago, I have been impressed and affected by his keen and unusual sense of design, and the distinctive way in which he depicts the fantastic. perhaps what strikes me most of all his work is its sheer beauty–a beauty that has always given me great pleasure.&quot;

*British author and comic artist Neil Gaiman, with whom Giraud collaborated on Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot; series, stated,
&quot;I read [&quot;Métal Hurlant&quot;] over and over and envied the French because they had everything I dreamed of in comics – beautifully drawn, visionary and literate comics, for adults. I wanted to make comics like that when I grew up.&quot;

*&quot;I consider him more important than Doré&quot;, said Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini, elaborating,
&quot;He&#x27;s a unique talent endowed with an extraordinary visionary imagination that&#x27;s constantly renewed and never vulgar. Moebius disturbs and consoles. He has the ability to transport us into unknown worlds where we encounter unsettling characters. My admiration for him is total. I consider him a great artist, as great as Picasso and Matisse.&quot;

*Following Giraud&#x27;s death, Brazilian author Paulo Coelho paid tribute on Twitter stating,
&quot;The great Moebius died today, but the great Mœbius is still alive. Your body died today, your work is more alive than ever.&quot;

*Comic book editor, translator, and publisher Kim Thompson eulogized,
&quot;I have said for years now — in fact, probably since 2000, when Charles Schulz left us, and there were four — that the three greatest living cartoonists are Robert Crumb, Jacques Tardi, and Jean Giraud. In the last 48 hours, that number has shrunk to two. – Salut, Jean!&quot;

*Benoît Mouchart, artistic director at France&#x27;s Angoulême International Comics Festival, made an assessment of his importance to the field of comics,
&quot;France has lost one of its best known artists in the world. In Japan, Italy, in the United States he is an incredible star who influenced world comics. Mœbius will remain part of the history of drawing, in the same right as Dürer or Ingres. He was an incredible producer, he said he wanted to show what eyes do not always see.&quot;

*French Culture Minister Frédéric Mitterrand, speaking at his funeral services at Saint Clotilde Basilica on 15 March 2012, said that by the simultaneous death of Giraud and Mœbius, France had lost &quot;two great artists&quot;. By both his presence and speech Mitterrand essentially cemented Giraud&#x27;s status as France&#x27;s premier standard bearer of &quot;Le Neuvième Art&quot; (&quot;the 9th art&quot;), the &quot;bande dessinée&quot; has officially become recognized as.

With the below referenced posthumous publishing efforts of Dark Horse Books that started in 2016, Giraud has become, along with fellow artist Enki Bilal from his &quot;Métal hurlant&quot; days, one of the relatively few European graphic novel artists to have the bulk of their body of work translated in the English language.

====HM Communications====
The English-language versions of many of Mœbius&#x27; comics have been collected into various editions, beginning with a small series of US graphic novel sized trade paperbacks from HM Communications, Inc., collecting work originally published in its &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; magazine (the US version of the French original, co-founded by Giraud), and in which Moebius&#x27; work was introduced to American readership in the 1970s. It has been noted by Taboo Editor-in-Chief Stephen R. Bissette that the quality of the translations of HM Communications had been very poor.

Heavy Metal presents (1977–1981)
* &quot;Arzach&quot; (64 pages, HM Communications, 1977, ); also collects the first time US publication of the above-mentioned single left hand panels of the &quot;transformation&quot; sequence as originally published in the 1974 &quot;Le bandard fou&quot; album.
* &quot;Is Man Good?&quot; (64 pages, HM Communications, 1978, )
* &quot;Moebius&quot; (96 pages, HM Communications, 1981, , issued without ISBN); art/comic book hybrid with an introduction by Federico Fellini, featuring a selection of art lifted from the French 1980 &quot;Mœbius&quot; source art book, and the entirety of the first volume of the &quot;Incal&quot; series, &quot;The Black Incal&quot;, therefore constituting the first English-language book release of the series.

====Marvel/Epic====
A far more comprehensive effort was undertaken at Marvel Comics under its Epic imprint in the late 1980s and early 1990s, initiated, translated and introduced by Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier. The intent was to collect &quot;all&quot; comics Giraud had hitherto published in Europe as Mœbius into one single format collection, and in this Epic largely succeeded, when the eventual two – three when counting &quot;Blueberry&quot; as well – collections had run their courses around 1992. When initiated, the collections were otherwise unaltered published in Great Britain as well, with a lag ranging from a few months to a year, by Titan Books in a smaller print run of 6.000 copies per title – like the previous HM Communications book releases had been – as opposed to the initial 20.000 copies per title release by Epic &quot;with&quot; a continuous reprint option for those volumes selling out while the Epic publication effort was underway, a relative novelty in the US comic world at the time. However, of the eventual eleven titles in the &quot;Fantasies&quot; softcover collection, only six (&quot;Mœbius 1&quot; - &quot;Mœbius 6&quot;) were ultimately released by Titan Books. With the exception of Mœbius 9 – &quot;Stel&quot; (itself a very late addition to the &quot;Fantasies&quot; collection, being a near simultaneous international 1994 release), Giraud created new cover art for the Marvel/Epic releases, including the &quot;Incal&quot; (and &quot;Blueberry&quot;) series. Save for Mœbius and aside from the covers, it was for the &quot;Fantasies&quot; collection that stories originally done in black &amp; white in the French source publications, received first time coloring, most notably &quot;The Airtight Garage&quot;, but excepting the seminal short story &quot;The Detour&quot;. Remarkably, Epic was aided by outsiders Dark Horse Comics and Graphitti Designs, who each added a volume to the &quot;Fantasies&quot; collection, adhering to the style and format as set by Epic, in which work was published Marvel/Epic itself apparently deemed too controversial to publish themselves, particularly the 0-volume for its heavy, albeit humorous, phallic theme.

Though some purist fans have frowned upon the coloring of the originally black &amp; white stories, the Marvel/Epic &quot;Fantasies&quot; collection has nevertheless served as the template for similar collections subsequently released in not only native France, but in other countries as well.

The Collected Fantasies of Jean Giraud (1987–1994):
* Mœbius 0 – &quot;The Horny Goof &amp; Other Underground Stories&quot; (72 pages, Dark Horse Comics, June 1990, )
* Mœbius – &quot;The Early Mœbius &amp; Other Humorous Stories&quot; (60 pages, Graphitti Designs, 1992, ); black &amp; white, expanded English-language version of &quot;John Watercolor et sa redingote qui tue!!&quot;
* Mœbius 1 – &quot;Upon A Star&quot; (72 pages, Marvel/Epic, September 1987, ; Titan, 1988, )
* Mœbius 2 – &quot;Arzach &amp; Other Fantasy Stories&quot; (72 pages, Marvel/Epic, April 1987, )
* Mœbius 3 – &quot;The Airtight Garage&quot; (120 pages, Marvel/Epic, April 1987, ; Titan, January 1990, )
* Mœbius 4 – &quot;The Long Tomorrow &amp; Other Science Fiction Stories&quot; (70 pages, Marvel/Epic, 1987, ; Titan, February 1988, )
* Mœbius 5 – &quot;The Gardens of Aedena&quot; (72 pages, Marvel/Epic, 1988, ; Titan, 1988, )
* Mœbius 6 – &quot;Pharagonesia &amp; Other Strange Stories&quot; (72 pages, Marvel/Epic, June 1987, ; Titan, June 1988, )
* Mœbius 7 – &quot;The Goddess&quot; (88 pages, Marvel/Epic, October 1990, )
* Mœbius 8 – &quot;Mississippi River&quot; (64 pages, Marvel/Epic, January 1991, )
* Mœbius 9 – &quot;Stel&quot; (80 pages, Marvel/Epic, 1994, ); executed in the European standard A4 comic album format as opposed to the smaller American graphic novel format hitherto employed.

The Incal collection (1988)&lt;br&gt;
Mœbius&#x27; magnum opus as such, &quot;The Incal&quot;, was separately released both in the US and Great Britain in its own mini series, each title collecting two of the original French source publications:
* &quot;The Incal 1&quot; (96 pages, Marvel/Epic, July 1988, ; Titan, 1988, )
* &quot;The Incal 2&quot; (118 pages, Marvel/Epic, 1988, ; Titan, October 1988, )
* &quot;The Incal 3&quot; (96 pages, Marvel/Epic, September 1988, ; Titan, November 1988, )

The Marvel/Epic graphic novel releases earned Giraud his three Harvey Awards in the category &quot;Best American Edition of Foreign Material&quot; in 1988 (for the &quot;Fantasies&quot; collection), in 1989 (for &quot;The Incal&quot; collection) and in 1991 (for the &quot;Blueberry&quot; collection).

The Silver Surfer (1988–2012)&lt;br&gt;
This miniseries won Giraud his Eisner Award for best finite/limited series in 1989, each comic book issue enjoying a print run of 200,000 copies.
* &quot;The Silver Surfer, Part 1&quot; (32 pages, Epic, December 1988); US standard comic book.
* &quot;The Silver Surfer, Part 2&quot; (32 pages, Epic, January 1989); US standard comic book.
* &quot;The Silver Surfer&quot; (68 pages, Epic, December 1988, ); with new cover and editorial enhanced, limited deluxe hardcover anthology edition in dust jacket, though print run is unknown.
* &quot;The Silver Surfer: Parable&quot; (68 pages, Marvel, 1998/Q1, ); softcover trade paperback reissue.
* &quot;The Silver Surfer: Parable&quot; (168 pages, Marvel, May 2012, ); hardcover trade edition, augmented with work from Keith Pollard, concurrently released as a numbered, limited to 640 copies, hardcover edition in dust jacket ().

Art Books (1989–1995)&lt;br&gt;
In between, Epic Comics did release four stand-alone art book titles, with &quot;Chaos&quot; and &quot;Metallic Memories&quot; reproducing most of the 1980 original:
*&quot;The Art of Mœbius&quot; (96 pages, Epic/Byron Preiss, October 1989, ); softcover US graphic novel format, collecting a selection of art previously published in the French source publications, including &quot;La memoire du futur&quot;, but – being otherwise an American initiative – it does not adhere to either the content or size format of the source publications, rather featuring artist&#x27;s annotations on each piece of artwork. Foreword by George Lucas.
*&quot;Chaos&quot; (96 pages, Epic, November 1991, ); hardcover book in deviant 30x30cm format issued without dust jacket, faithful reproduction of the French source publication.
*&quot;Metallic Memories&quot; (88 pages, Epic, November 1992, ); hardcover book in deviant 30x30cm format issued without dust jacket, faithful reproduction of the French source publication.
*&quot;Fusion&quot; (126 pages, Epic, 1995, ); oversized European graphic novel format hardcover book issued without dust jacket, faithful reproduction of the French source publication.

The Elsewhere Prince (1990)&lt;br&gt;
While Giraud (with Lofficier) was only the co-writer of this US standard comic book mini series, which took place in &quot;The Airtight Garage&quot; universe, there was additional art from him featured in short accompanying editorials, as well as one to two page short stories.
* Sonnet 1: &quot;The Jouk&quot; (32 pages, Epic, May 1990)
* Sonnet 2: &quot;The Princess&quot; (32 pages, Epic, June 1990)
* Sonnet 3: &quot;Abagoo&quot; (32 pages, Epic, July 1990)
* Sonnet 4: &quot;The Prince&quot; (32 pages, Epic, August 1990)
* Sonnet 5: &quot;The Bouch&#x27; Tarhai&quot; (32 pages, Epic, September 1990)
* Sonnet 6: &quot;The Artist&quot; (32 pages, Epic, October 1990)

Onyx Overlord (1992–1993)&lt;br&gt;
By Giraud co-written sequel to &quot;The Elsewhere Prince&quot;, and like that series, also featuring additional art from his hand. While Giraud was very pleased with Shanower&#x27;s art for &quot;The Elsewhere Prince&quot; for its &quot;naive qualities&quot; he found very fitting for the story-arc, he was deeply disappointed with Bingham&#x27;s art for &quot;Onyx Overlord&quot;, considering the work of the &quot;old comics veteran&quot; uninspired and &quot;truly undignified&quot;, suspecting Bingham did not like the work. Because of this, Giraud decided not to dispatch the already completed scenarios for Logs 5 and 6. Disappointing sales of the European editions left the cycle uncompleted indefinitely.
* Log 1: &quot;Armjourth&quot; (32 pages, Epic, October 1992)
* Log 2: &quot;Randomearth Yby&quot; (32 pages, Epic, November 1992)
* Log 3: &quot;Onyx&quot; (32 pages, Epic, December 1992)
* Log 4: &quot;Return to Armjourth&quot; (32 pages, Epic, January 1993)

Moebius&#x27; Airtight Garage (1993)&lt;br&gt;
Standard US comic book reissue of the 1987 graphic novel, with some additional art in the editorials.
* &quot;Volume 1&quot; (32 pages, Epic, July 1993)
* &quot;Volume 2&quot; (32 pages, Epic, August 1993)
* &quot;Volume 3&quot; (32 pages, Epic, September 1993)
* &quot;Volume 4&quot; (32 pages, Epic, October 1993)

The Halo Graphic Novel (2006)&lt;br&gt;
Comprising four chapters, Giraud provided the 16-page art for chapter 4, &quot;Second Sunrise over New Mombasa&quot;. In the editorial of the novel (p. 99), Giraud explained that son Raphaël&#x27;s enjoyment of the game series ultimately compelled him to accept an invitation to contribute his art; before penciling the story, he had never played the video games.
* &quot;The Halo Graphic Novel&quot; (128 pages, Marvel, August 2006, ); hardcover in dust jacket, US graphic novel format
* &quot;Halo Graphic Novel&quot; (128 pages, Marvel, June 2010, ); softcover trade paperback, US graphic novel format

====Graphitti Designs====
Excepting &quot;The Art of Mœbius&quot;, &quot;Mœbius 9&quot;, &quot;Fusion&quot; (being Johnny-come-lately&#x27;s, the latter two were released too late for inclusion, whereas the first one, having been a co-publication, could not for copyright reasons), &quot;The Silver Surfer&quot; and &quot;The Elsewhere Prince&quot;/&quot;Onyx Overlord&quot;, all these volumes were &quot;very&quot; shortly thereafter reissued by Graphitti Designs – having themselves added a volume to the &quot;Collected Fantasies&quot; series – as part of their signed and numbered, &quot;Limited Hardcover Edition&quot; 1500 copy each collection (in dust jacket), combining these with the similar &quot;Blueberry&quot; releases by Epic and Catalan Communications, in a single &quot;Mœbius&quot; ten-volume complete works anthology release. Excepting the last volume, the Mœbius collection was executed in the standard European graphic novel size. The &quot;Young Blueberry&quot; and &quot;Virtual Meltdown&quot; anthology titles differed from the others in that they were not printed on high gloss paper, but on matte paper as in the original ComCat/Epic publications, and was in itself a stark indication – aside from the very quick release after the original Marvel/Epic/ComCat individual publications – that the Graphitti Designs release had always been foreseen, resulting in that the original print run of the interior pages for the individual volumes had already accounted for inclusion in the anthology collection as well.

Mœbius anthology collection (1988–1993)
* Limited Hardcover Edition 12 - &quot;Mœbius 1&quot; (272 pages, Graphitti Designs, July 1987, ); collects Moebius 1 - 3

* Limited Hardcover Edition 44 - &quot;Virtual Meltdown: Images of Mœbius&quot; (188 pages, Graphitti Designs, 1993, ); collects &quot;Chaos&quot; and &quot;Metallic Memories&quot;; issued without dust jacket in deviant 30x30cm format

====Dark Horse====

*&quot;The Abyss, issue 2&quot; (32 pages, Dark Horse Comics, July 1989)

This special in the &quot;Concrete&quot; comic book series, featured the first time, full color publication of the 23-page short story &quot;The Still Planet&quot;, set in the Edena universe. Accounting for half the contents of the comic book, the story was instrumental in making Mœbius co-winner of the 1991 Eisner Award in the category &quot;Best Single Issue&quot;.
*&quot;Concrete Celebrates Earth Day 1990&quot; (52 pages, Dark Horse Comics, April 1990)

** &quot;Madwoman of the Sacred Heart&quot; (Volume 1); black &amp; white, art and cover artist issues 70 and 73
City of Fire art portfolio (1993)&lt;br&gt;
The fourth Mœbius outing of Dark Horse concerned a reissue of the art portfolio &quot;La Cité Feu&quot; – a collaborative art project of Giraud with Geoff Darrow – Starwatcher Graphics had released as an English language (for the introduction folio) &quot;Limited American lux edition&quot; version of 100 signed and numbered copies in January 1985 under its original title, alongside the French 950 copy original by Aedena. Some of the art is reproduced in the aforementioned &quot;Fusion&quot; art book by Epic.
* &quot;City of Fire&quot; (10 folios, Dark Horse, 1993); Unsigned and limited, though print run is unknown, 14.5&quot;x19&quot; sized lithograph prints with cover folio in envelope, as opposed to the hardboard box of the 1985 release. Also lacking the by Mœbius written introduction folio for that release, original cover, description and two black and white art folios, which are however replaced by two color additions.

Mœbius collection (1996)&lt;br&gt;
Having added the 0-volume to the &quot;Collected Fantasies&quot; series in 1990, Dark Horse Comics too decided to release a Mœbius specific – meaning without his Western work – collection themselves, this time executed in the standard US comic book-sized format and soliciting the editorial input from Jean-Marc Lofficier who had already done so for the previous efforts. Though much of the contents was essentially a recapitulation of the Marvel/Epic publications, Lofficier made use of the opportunity to add work Mœbius had created after the Marvel/Epic publications had run its course, such as the story &quot;The Man from the Ciguri&quot; (a sequel to &quot;The Airtight Garage&quot;) and the first two outings of the &quot;Madwomen of the sacred Heart&quot; series.
* &quot;Arzach&quot; (80 pages, Dark Horse Comics, February 1996, )
* &quot;Exotics&quot; (80 pages, Dark Horse Comics, April 1996, ) 
* &quot;The Man from the Ciguri&quot; (80 pages, Dark Horse Comics, May 1996, ), collecting the episodes as originally serialized in black &amp; white in the publisher&#x27;s &quot;Cheval Noir&quot; (French for Dark Horse) magazine (issues 26–30, 33–37, 40–41, and 50, 1992–1994). 
* &quot;H.P.&#x27;s Rock City&quot; (80 pages, Dark Horse Comics, June 1996, ) 
* &quot;Madwomen of the sacred Heart&quot; (144 pages, Dark Horse Comics, August 1996, ); black &amp; white, collecting the first volume as serialized in their 1993 &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; magazine, augmented with volume 2.

Mœbius Library (2016-)&lt;br&gt;
Twenty years later, in April 2016, Dark Horse announced an ambitious project called the &quot;Mœbius Library&quot; to be released by its book division in American graphic novel hardcover format – even though the later added &quot;Doctor Moebius and Mister Gir&quot; title became executed as a softcover release. The stated intent was to predominantly publish latter day work by Mœbius in conjunction with, and originally published under the auspices of, his own publishing house &quot;Mœbius Production&quot;, headed after his death in 2012 by second wife Isabelle. The first title was released in October 2016, which promptly won an Eisner Award.
* Mœbius Library 1 - &quot;The World of Edena&quot; (360 pages, Dark Horse Books, October 2016, ); featuring the first time English language version of the last installment &quot;Sra&quot;, thereby completing &quot;The World of Edena&quot; series in English. Recipient of a 2017 Eisner Award in the category &quot;Best U.S. Edition of International Material&quot;.

* Mœbius Library 6 - &quot;The Major&quot; (184 pages, Dark Horse Books, July 2024, ); edited translation of the 2011 French source publication
* Mœbius Library Special 1 - &quot;Doctor Moebius and Mister Gir&quot; (288 pages, Dark Horse Books, 16 December 2023, ; faithful translation of the 2015 French source publication, but with minute editorial differences such as the omission of some accompanying art and the addition of the postscript editorial glossary.

====Kitchen Sink Press====
Kitchen Sink Press was a publisher of underground comics, explaining the &quot;French Ticklers&quot; series, and had connotations with HM Communications, adopting some of its artist after the latter had become defunct. Concurrently they had merged with Tundra Publishing in 1993, explaining the &quot;Visions of Arzach&quot; anthology art book.&lt;br&gt;

French Ticklers (1989-1990)&lt;br&gt;

Giraud&#x27;s contributions concerned some of his early &quot;Mœbius&quot; work he had produced for &quot;Hara-Kiri&quot; in 1963–1964. Graphitti Designs subsequently collected all early Mœbius work in their 1992 &quot;Collected Fantasies&quot; contribution as &quot;Mœbius ½&quot;. All three black &amp; white issues featured a (color) cover by Mœbius.

After the initial cooperation with DC Comics in the mid-2000s, publisher Humanoids, Inc. (until 2013 the US subsidiary of the French publisher co-founded by Moebius in 1974) has from 2010 onward begun to reissue new editions of Mœbius works on its own, starting with two of Mœbius&#x27;s past collaborations with Alejandro Jodorowsky: &quot;The Incal&quot; and &quot;Madwoman of the Sacred Heart&quot;. Humanoids releases these latter-day hardcover editions, usually without dust jacket, in variant size formats, US graphic novel format (trade editions), oversized format (which is essentially the larger, standard European graphic novel A4 format), and the even larger coffee table format, the latter typically in a limited print run. Aside from the English language publications, Humanoids occasionally imports French deluxe, limited edition specialty Moebius editions, such as &quot;Le Garage hermétique&quot; () and &quot;Arzach&quot; (), from the parent publisher especially on behalf of its American readership. The post-2010 Humanoids editions are also intended for, and disseminated to, the British-Canadian and UK markets, with the exception of two 2011 &quot;Incal&quot; editions, which were licensed and featured variant cover art.

The Metabarons (2002)&lt;br&gt;
Giraud had created one 8-page short story &quot;Au coeur de l&#x27;inviolable meta bunker&quot; in 1989, focusing on one of the major secondary characters from the &quot;Incal&quot; saga, The Metabaron, whose ancestry later received its own &quot;The Metabarons&quot; spin-off series. Though that story was redrawn by the series&#x27; artist Juan Giménez for later book publications, Giraud&#x27;s original was published in black &amp; white in the below-mentioned 1990 British publication, and subsequently included in an outing of Humanoids&#x27; &quot;Prestige Format Comic Book&quot; collection as &quot;Metabaron 1: The Lost Pages&quot;, which introduced Valérie Beltran&#x27;s new coloring for Giraud&#x27;s &quot;Incal&quot; series.
*&quot;The Metabarons&quot;: &quot;Alpha/Omega&quot; (48 pages, Humanoids Inc, October 2002, ); Softcover trade edition

The Incal (2005–2022)&lt;br&gt;
Excepting the early 2005 co-productions with DC Comics, all subsequent editions feature the original coloring. The two co-editions with DC featured an entirely new coloring by Valérie Beltran as well as some censorship in regard to nudity, neither of which sitting well with writer Jodorowsky, who interpreted the changes as a cheap ploy to entice a younger readership. Customer reviews for both titles on Amazon.com, showed that fans were largely in concordance with Jodorowsky&#x27;s assessment. Considered a commercial failure, Beltran&#x27;s coloring has never been used again after the initial (international) releases, be it in the United States or elsewhere in the world.

Final Incal (2014-2022)&lt;br&gt; 
Though this three-volume series (originally called &quot;Après l&#x27;Incal&quot; – &quot;After the Incal&quot;) was ultimately realized with art from José Ladrönn, Giraud had actually already penciled the first outing in the series, &quot;Le nouveau rêve&quot;, but which was replaced by a re-scripted and by Ladronn redrawn variant for reprint runs. The anthology editions below however, feature the Moebius 56-page original as well as a bonus. Actually, the series was from the start intended to be a purely Jodorowsky/Moebius follow-up to their acclaimed main series, but as stated above, it was Giraud who declined to continue afterwards.
* &quot;Final Incal&quot; (216 pages, Humanoids Inc, May 2014, ); To 200 copies limited coffee table format edition in hardboard slipcase, issued with three art prints and a by Jodorowsky and Ladrönn signed and numbered bookplate.

Faithful reproduction of the 2016 second, updated and expanded edition of the 1989 French &quot;Les Mystères de l&#x27;Incal&quot; original, but without the &quot;Au coeur de l&#x27;inviolable meta bunker&quot; short story in its original coloring, which was however published by the publisher in July 2020 as a digital release () under its English title &quot;In the Heart of the Impregnable Metabunker&quot; (&quot;aka&quot; &quot;Solune&#x27;s Origin&quot; as the story was coined by the publisher in its 2005 co-publication with DC).
* &quot;Deconstructing The Incal&quot; (112 pages, Humanoids Inc, October 2017, ); Oversized hardcover trade edition.

&quot;Eyes of the Cat&quot; (1990)&lt;br&gt;
For unknown reasons, this 54-page work had been left out of the Marvel/Epic collection of the 1980s–1990s, despite the fact that the work was hailed by comic critics as a graphic masterpiece. Still, the story &quot;did&quot; see a contemporary first-time English-language publication, with elaborate annotations from its authors, in this graphic novel anthology. The black &amp; white Mœbius story was as only one printed on yellow paper, like it was in the original French source publication. The anthology featured the rejected &quot;Les Chiens&quot; 1979 movie poster by Mœbius as cover. In the 2010s reissued several times by Humanoides Publishing as specified above.

&quot;Angel Claw&quot; (1997)&lt;br&gt;
Due to the graphic, erotic nature of the book, this work of Moebius has not been published in the US in the 1990s by the &quot;usual suspects&quot;, but rather by outlier NBM Publishing under its &quot;Eurotica&quot; imprint, as a European A4 format padded hardcover in dust jacket book.

**&quot;Seven Samurai 20XX&quot; (2004, character design).
*Video games heavily inspired by Mœbius&#x27; art
**An arcade and bar based on Giraud&#x27;s work, called &quot;The Airtight Garage&quot;, was one of the original main attractions at the Metreon in San Francisco when the complex opened in 1999. It included three original games: &quot;Quaternia&quot;, a first-person shooter networked between terminals and based on the concept of &quot;junctors&quot; from &quot;Major Fatal&quot; and &quot;The Airtight Garage&quot;; a virtual reality bumper cars game about mining asteroids; and &quot;Hyperbowl&quot;, an obstacle course bowling game incorporating very little overtly Moebius imagery. The arcade was closed and reopened as &quot;Portal One&quot;, retaining much of the Moebius-based decor and Hyperbowl but eliminating the other originals in favor of more common arcade games.
**&quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot; - the artwork and graphics of the game are inspired by the artist&#x27;s work (2002).

**&quot;Swordship&quot; is a futuristic dodge&#x27;em up where the player&#x27;s vehicle is to evade the enemies and trick them into destroying each other. The minimalist graphics&#x27; colour tone looks close to the Moebius comics (2022).

<text>Harald Franz Schmidt (born 18 August 1957) is a German actor, comedian, television presenter and writer best known as the host of two popular German late-night shows.

== Early and private life ==
A son of refugees who fled from Sudetenland (now Czech Republic) in 1945, Schmidt spent his youth in Swabian Nürtingen. Due to his strict Catholic upbringing he devoted time to the Roman Catholic church, serving as choirmaster and playing the organ.

At the age of 21, Schmidt went to Stuttgart to attend drama school for three years. After that, he gained on-stage experience at Städtische Bühne (Municipal Stage) in Augsburg. His first role was that of the 2nd Mamaluke in Lessing&#x27;s &quot;Nathan the Wise&quot;. In 1984, Schmidt became a lyricist for the cabaret &quot;Kom(m)ödchen&quot; in Düsseldorf and in 1986, was honoured as &quot;Best Newcomer cabaret artist&quot; and toured through Germany with his own show.

In October 2005, his daughter Amelie was born. Schmidt resides in Cologne with his partner Ellen Hantsch, a school teacher, and their five children, the eldest being from a previous relationship. Little is known about the children and their two mothers as Schmidt shields them from the public. In interviews he hardly talks about them.

== Television career ==
Before long, TV noticed the talented young comedian, and in 1988, Schmidt began to host his first TV show, &quot;MAZ ab&quot;. This was followed by shows like &quot;Psst!&quot; and &quot;Schmidteinander&quot;. The biggest boost to his career occurred in 1992, when Schmidt started hosting the popular Saturday night show &quot;Verstehen Sie Spaß?&quot; (a variation of &quot;Candid Camera&quot;). Schmidt was awarded Germany&#x27;s most important TV award, the Adolf-Grimme-Preis, which would be followed by many others. Just one year later, he was honoured as the &quot;Entertainer of the Year&quot; and awarded the Bambi Award, as well as the Golden Camera.

In 2004, Schmidt toured through Germany with a live comedy show, featuring his former late night show sidekick Manuel Andrack.
=== &quot;Harald Schmidt Show&quot;===
In 1995, Schmidt changed from the publicly funded TV station ARD to the privately owned German television network Sat.1 in order to host a late night show similar to &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. The show, named &quot;Die Harald Schmidt Show&quot;, featured stand-up comedy as well as famous national and international guests. From 30 June 2003, the show was broadcast five days a week, including Monday evening. On 8 December 2003, Schmidt suddenly announced the end of the show, following a change of management of Sat.1. The last show was aired on 23 December 2003. The following suspension of the TV format lasted until 2011, when the show returned to Sat.1.

=== &quot;Harald Schmidt&quot;===

In 2004, Schmidt began a second run with a new show named &quot;Harald Schmidt&quot; on publicly funded ARD, where he had begun his television career 16 years earlier. The show no longer featured &quot;celebrity&quot; interviews but dealt even more with the discussion of current events in a rather freely associative manner. Manuel Andrack returned as his sidekick.

On his first show after the break, Schmidt appeared with long hair and a full beard, making fun of his long absence from the public. After summer break in 2005 the &quot;celebrity guest&quot; segment was reintroduced.

=== &quot;Schmidt &amp; Pocher&quot;===

Late in 2007, Manuel Andrack was replaced by comedian Oliver Pocher, who had a more active part than his predecessor, and some other elements changed as well. The broadcast&#x27;s title was changed to &quot;Schmidt &amp; Pocher&quot;, trying to attract a younger audience. Pocher appeared &quot;less intellectual&quot;, a fact that caused some criticism among Schmidt&#x27;s core audience and broadsheet newspaper comments in Germany.

=== &quot;Harald Schmidt&quot;===
After the termination of &quot;Schmidt &amp; Pocher&quot;, Schmidt again hosted the show under its former title &quot;Harald Schmidt&quot;, this time without any sidekick.

=== Relaunch of the &quot;Harald Schmidt Show&quot;===

On 15 September 2011, Schmidt returned to his former network Sat.1, picking up its former name of &quot;Die Harald Schmidt Show&quot; again. However, Sat.1 cancelled the show after one season due to low ratings. Starting 4 September 2012, new episodes were shown on Sky Hits HD and Sky Atlantic HD, two channels of the German Pay-TV network Sky Deutschland. Schmidt hosted his very last show on 13 March 2014. He announced he would not return to TV. SKY published the last show on video-sharing website YouTube.

== Concept and personalities ==

The self-proclaimed hypochondriac became popular for his cynical jokes, cruel remarks and wry intellectual wit. (Even though he is obsessed with health he was able to lampoon this weak spot in a self ironic TV commercial for a medicine curing colds.) Schmidt models himself after people like Johnny Carson and Conan O&#x27;Brien, but adds factors and qualities to his show himself.

He engaged in long, seemingly boring conversations with his &quot;supervising producer&quot; Manuel Andrack (known as &quot;chief dramatic adviser&quot;), who sat at a desk next to Schmidt&#x27;s until 2005, and, like David Letterman, also included his staff in the show, for instance, his cue card girl Suzana Novinscak and his band leader Helmut Zerlett. Schmidt celebrated the return of French woman Nathalie Licard in his ARD era (like Zerlett she is still part of Schmidt&#x27;s team). In Schmidt&#x27;s original &quot;Harald Schmidt Show&quot; (1995–2003), Licard was involved in the goings-on in front of the audience too.

== Criticism ==
Especially during the first years of &quot;Die Harald Schmidt Show&quot;, Schmidt was sometimes criticised for making fun of minorities like foreigners or gays. He also did Adolf Hitler imitations in his show (in one of these he as Hitler warned young people not to vote for racist and nationalistic parties). Schmidt&#x27;s more unorthodox and politically incorrect jokes have garnered the show a reputation as cult television and his supporters accused critics of being incapable of understanding satire.

In the later years of its first run on Sat.1 (circa 2001–2003), the &quot;Harald Schmidt Show&quot; became a critics&#x27; favourite due to Schmidt&#x27;s &quot;intellectual&quot; sense of humour, especially for incorporating many references to high culture (be it literature, theater, classical music, painting, or cinema), history, and philosophy. Another recurring item were forays into surrealism and absurdity that were pretty much anathema to commercial or &quot;mainstream&quot; interest: For example, Schmidt hosted one show completely in French (re-broadcast a few days later on Franco-German channel Arte, this &quot;Show en Francais&quot; episode gained glowing reviews from French critics). On another occasion, the screen was blacked for half of the show making it into a &quot;radio broadcast&quot;. Another time, Schmidt disproved a critic who had written that it is impossible to spend several minutes on TV just cracking nuts without anybody saying anything. The show&#x27;s reviews and renown among critics gradually worsened during the years of its ARD run (2004–2010), especially because Schmidt&#x27;s choice of Oliver Pocher as a new sidekick was considered a mistake that diminished the entire show&#x27;s quality.

== Other activities ==

Schmidt&#x27;s first book, &quot;Tränen im Aquarium&quot;, was published in 1993, the second, &quot;Mulatten in gelben Sesseln&quot;, in 2005.

1994–2013 H. Schmidt worked as a columnist for one of the major German weekly news magazines, &quot;Focus&quot;. Many of his articles were assembled and released as books. The first of these, &quot;Warum?&quot; (&quot;Why?&quot;), was published in 1997; another nine books followed.

Schmidt also voiced an audiobook, &quot;Jerry Cotton – Mein erster Fall beim FBI&quot; (2003).

== Awards ==

Schmidt has won more than 30 television, comedy and theatrical awards, including three German Television Awards, the viewers choice award Bambi, the Grimme Award, the Golden Camera and the RTL Golden Lion as best talk show host. In 2013, he became a Cavalier of Ordre national de la Légion d&#x27;honneur.

<doc id="164089" wikidata="Q281287" url="?curid=164089" title="Politeness">
<text>Politeness is the practical application of good manners or etiquette so as not to offend others and to put them at ease. It is a culturally defined phenomenon, and therefore what is considered polite in one culture can sometimes be quite rude or simply eccentric in another cultural context.

While the goal of politeness is to refrain from behaving in an offensive way so as not to offend others, and to make all people feel relaxed and comfortable with one another, these culturally defined standards at times may be broken within the context of personal boundaries – this is known as &quot;positive politeness&quot;.

==Types==

Anthropologists Penelope Brown and Stephen Levinson identified four kinds of politeness, deriving from Erving Goffman&#x27;s concept of face:
# Negative politeness is the act of making a request less infringing, such as &quot;If you don&#x27;t mind...&quot; or &quot;If it isn&#x27;t too much trouble...&quot;; respects a person&#x27;s right to act freely. This is a variety of &quot;deference&quot;. There is a greater use of indirect speech acts. It is also considered a part of being assertive.
#Non-assertive politeness is when a person refrains from making a comment or asserting their beliefs during a discussion so as to remain polite to others present. It is also when a person goes along with a decision made by someone else so as not to appear impolite, essentially following general social norms.
#Assertive politeness can be when a person offers their opinion in a positive and constructive way to be assistive and helpful during an interaction, or refrains from purporting to agree with something they do not actually agree with in a way that does not offend others.
# Positive politeness seeks to establish a positive relationship between parties, and it respects a person&#x27;s need to be liked and understood. This standard of politeness is determined by personal boundaries, and often violates etiquette norms in letter. Direct speech acts, swearing and flouting Grice&#x27;s maxims can be considered aspects of positive politeness because:
#* They show an awareness that the relationship is strong enough to cope with what would normally be considered impolite (in the popular understanding of the term);
#* They articulate an awareness of the other person&#x27;s values, which fulfills the person&#x27;s desire to be accepted.
#* They convey a natural, relaxed, casual setting.

Some cultures, groups, and individuals prefer some ideals of politeness over the other. In this way, politeness is culturally bound, and even within broader cultures, people may disagree.

==History==
During the Enlightenment era, a self-conscious process of the imposition of polite norms and behaviors became a symbol of being a genteel member of the upper class. Upwardly mobile middle class bourgeoisie increasingly tried to identify themselves with the elite through their adopted artistic preferences and their standards of behavior. They became preoccupied with precise rules of etiquette, such as when to show emotion, the art of elegant dress and graceful conversation and how to act courteously, especially with women. Influential in this new discourse was a series of essays on the nature of politeness in a commercial society, penned by the philosopher Lord Shaftesbury in the early 18th century. Shaftesbury defined politeness as the art of being pleasing in company: &quot;&#x27;Politeness&#x27; may be defined a dext&#x27;rous management of our words and actions, whereby we make other people have better opinion of us and themselves.&quot;
Periodicals, such as &quot;The Spectator&quot;, founded as a daily publication by Joseph Addison and Richard Steele in 1711, gave regular advice to its readers on how to be a polite gentleman. Its stated goal was &quot;to enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with morality... to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and coffeehouses.&quot; It provided its readers with educated, topical talking points, and advice on how to carry on conversations and social interactions in a polite manner.

The art of polite conversation and debate was particularly cultivated in the coffeehouses of the period. Conversation was supposed to conform to a particular manner, with the language of polite and civil conversation considered to be essential to the conduct of coffeehouse debate and conversation. The concept of &quot;civility&quot; referred to a desired social interaction which valued sober and reasoned debate on matters of interest. Established rules and procedures for proper behavior, as well as conventions, were outlined by gentleman&#x27;s clubs, such as Harrington&#x27;s Rota Club. Periodicals, including &quot;The Tatler&quot; and &quot;The Spectator&quot;, intended to infuse politeness into English coffeehouse conversation, as their explicit purpose lay in the reformation of English manners and morals.

==Techniques==

There is a variety of techniques one can use to seem polite. Some techniques include expressing uncertainty and ambiguity through hedging and indirectness, polite lying or use of euphemisms (which make use of ambiguity as well as connotation). 

Additionally, one can use tag questions to direct statements, such as &quot;You were at the store, weren&#x27;t you?&quot; There are three types of tags: modal tags, affective tags, and facilitative tags. Modal tags request information of which the speaker is uncertain: &quot;You haven&#x27;t been to the store yet, have you?&quot; Affective tags indicate concern for the listener: &quot;You haven&#x27;t been here long, have you? Facilitative tags invite the addressee to comment on the request being made: &quot;You can do that, can&#x27;t you?&quot; Finally, softeners reduce the force of what would be a brusque demand: &quot;Hand me that thing, could you?&quot;

Some studies have shown that women are more likely to use politeness formulas than men, though the exact differences are not clear. Most current research has shown that gender differences in politeness use are complex, since there is a clear association between politeness norms and the stereotypical speech of middle class white women, at least in the UK and US. It is therefore unsurprising that women tend to be associated with politeness more and their linguistic behavior judged in relation to these politeness norms.

==Linguistic devices==

Besides and additionally to the above, many languages have specific means to show politeness, deference, respect, or a recognition of the social status of the speaker and the hearer. There are two main ways in which a given language shows politeness: in its lexicon (for example, employing certain words in formal occasions, and colloquial forms in informal contexts), and in its morphology (for example, using special verb forms for polite discourse). The T–V distinction is a common example in Western languages, while some Asian languages extend this to avoiding pronouns entirely. Some languages have complex politeness systems, such as Korean speech levels and honorific speech in Japanese.

Japanese is perhaps the most widely known example of a language that encodes politeness at its core. Japanese has two main levels of politeness, one for intimate acquaintances, family, and friends, and one for other groups, and verb morphology reflects these levels. Besides that, some verbs have special hyper-polite suppletive forms. This happens also with some nouns and interrogative pronouns. Japanese also employs different personal pronouns for each person according to gender, age, rank, degree of acquaintance, and other cultural factors.

==Criticism of Brown and Levinson&#x27;s typology==
Brown and Levinson&#x27;s theory of politeness has been criticised as not being universally valid, by linguists working with East-Asian languages, including Japanese. Matsumoto and Ide claim that Brown and Levinson assume the speaker&#x27;s volitional use of language, which allows the speaker&#x27;s creative use of face-maintaining strategies toward the addressee. In East Asian cultures like Japan, politeness is achieved not so much on the basis of volition as on discernment (, finding one&#x27;s place), or prescribed social norms. is oriented towards the need for acknowledgment of the positions or roles of all the participants as well as adherence to formality norms appropriate to the particular situation.

<doc id="164090" wikidata="Q2985656" url="?curid=164090" title="United Kingdom cabinet committee">
<text>The British government is directed by the Cabinet, a group of senior government ministers led by the Prime Minister. Most of the day-to-day work of the Cabinet is carried out by Cabinet committees, rather than by the full Cabinet. Each committee has its own area of responsibility, and their decisions are binding on the entire Cabinet.

The details of the committee structure and membership are at the discretion of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is free to reorganize committees, assign responsibilities, and can appoint or dismiss committee members freely. The sole limitation is the requirement that Cabinet ministers must be sworn members of the Privy Council, since the Cabinet itself is a committee of the Privy Council.

Although there have been many changes since the Cabinet committee system was first developed in the early twentieth century, the committees for foreign and military policy, domestic policy, economic policy, and the government&#x27;s legislative agenda have been more or less permanent fixtures. These and many other committees are &quot;standing committees&quot;, which have a broad remit; others are &quot;ad hoc committees&quot;, which are established to deal with specific matters. Ad hoc committees are rarer now than throughout most of the twentieth century. Many matters are now expected to be resolved bilaterally between departments, or through more informal discussion, rather than requiring the formation of a committee.

The 2015 government introduced &quot;Implementation Taskforces&quot; to address specific cross-cutting priorities. These are to report to the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and Cabinet approval is still required if collective agreement is needed.

When the Prime Minister is unable to attend Cabinet or the chair and any deputy chair of a Cabinet committee are absent, the next most senior minister in the ministerial ranking should take the chair.

==Committee procedure==

Committee membership is limited to ministers, but non-ministers may attend in some cases. In particular, the National Security Council is routinely attended by senior military, intelligence and security officials. Members of the Prime Minister&#x27;s office – including the Prime Minister themselves – may attend any committee. The Prime Minister&#x27;s attendance does not mean that they will chair the committee, despite being the most senior Cabinet member present, though they may choose to do so.

In the 2010 coalition government, each Cabinet committee included members of both the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats. Furthermore, the general pattern was for committees to have a chair and a deputy chair, one from each party. There was a Coalition Committee, and an operational working group, to handle appeals over coalition disputes and to plan future policy.

Former committees with non-ministers as full members include the Economic Advisory Council, whose membership was made up of a combination of ministers and experts in economics. The Committee of Imperial Defence, a parallel Cabinet for military policy which existed from 1904 until 1939, included ministers, heads of the armed services, and civil servants. Between 1997 and 2001, there was a Ministerial Consultative Committee with the Liberal Democratic Party which included senior Liberal Democrats as well as Labour ministers.

Until 1992, the list of cabinet committees, their membership, and their terms of reference were secret, with rare exceptions. During the Second World War, details of the War Cabinet structure were communicated to Parliament; Winston Churchill had previously announced a Standing Committee on National Expenditure in his 1925 Budget statement. The existence and membership of the Defence and Overseas Policy Committee was announced in 1963, coinciding with the amalgamation of the service ministries into a single Ministry of Defence. Margaret Thatcher confirmed the continuing existence of this committee in the House of Commons in 1979, along with standing committees for Economic Strategy, Home and Social Affairs, and Legislation. The secrecy was due to the concern that public knowledge of Cabinet procedure would lead to a loss of faith in collective responsibility (if it became known that only a subset of the Cabinet had been involved in making a given decision) and undue pressure being put on committee chairs once their specific policy responsibilities became known. Whether decisions were made by the entire Cabinet, or by a committee, is not revealed at present.

Cabinet committees are shadowed by &quot;official committees&quot; made up of civil servants from the relevant departments. Official committees follow a thirty-year secrecy rule with respect to their existence and membership.

===Committees with special functions===

Most committees exist for the coordination of policy in some specific area. Some committees, however, have a special role in managing government business, and accordingly have different procedures.

The Public Expenditure Committee (PEX) plays a central role in the allocation of government money to departments. It originated in 1981 under the informal title of &quot;Star Chamber&quot; as an ad hoc committee (MISC 62) which could handle appeals over spending disputes, rather than having these be dealt with by the full Cabinet. An appeal to Cabinet was still possible, but this right was rarely exercised. The original name refers to the Star Chamber court noted for its secret, arbitrary and brutal decisions.
The committee was made permanent under John Major, under the name &quot;EDX&quot;, and placed under the chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. From 1998 to 2010 the same committee (by then called &quot;PX&quot;, and later &quot;PSX&quot;) also monitored departments&#x27; fulfillment of Public service agreements. While such agreements are no longer used, the committee retains its role in examining departmental expenditure, and will advise Cabinet on the allocation each department is to receive.

The Legislation committee allocates time for government bills to be considered in Parliament, coordinates the writing and handling of these bills in general, and is responsible for the Queen&#x27;s Speech. Previously, there had been two committees, one for considering future legislation and another to deal with bills during their passage through Parliament. Departments who wish to make new primary legislation must apply to the committee for a slot in the legislative programme, as well as obtaining clearance from the relevant policy committee.

In an emergency, the National Security Council (Threats, Hazards, Resilience and Contingencies) subcommittee can meet in an operational configuration. This arrangement was previously named as the Civil Contingencies Committee. In this case, the chair is taken by the minister for whichever government department is the &quot;lead&quot; for the emergency in question. That subcommittee however has disestablished as of 2021.

===&quot;Ad hoc&quot; committees===
During the post-Second World War period, in addition to standing committees, there were &quot;ad hoc&quot; committees that were convened to handle a single issue. These were normally short-lived. Each was given a prefix of Gen or Misc and a number. Gen 183, for example, was the Committee on Subversive Activities. Between 1945 and 1964, Gen (for general) committees were sequentially numbered from 1 to 881 in order of formation.

===Cabinet papers===

Committee minutes and papers follow the same secrecy rules as for the full Cabinet. Documents are generally handled on a need-to-know basis, and so may not be available to ministers who do not serve on the relevant committee. Some materials may be classified as being available exclusively to the named members of the committee, and particularly sensitive papers may be kept in a secure room and read only under supervision. Papers may be distributed physically or electronically (via the Government Secure Intranet). Notes taken at meetings for the purpose of preparing the official minutes are destroyed once the minutes have been written. The minutes do not generally link points made in discussion to the specific people who made them.

Future governments may not be permitted to see the cabinet papers of their predecessors, if there has been a change of party. Access in this case requires the approval of the former Prime Minister, or of the Leader of the Opposition. The few exceptions relate to papers of an expressly non-political nature, such as legal advice or international agreements. Retired ministers wishing to write their memoirs are given access to papers from their tenure, but are usually not allowed to borrow them from the Cabinet Office archive.

==Current committees==

This table follows the document issued by the Cabinet Office in November 2022.

===Mission boards===
In addition to cabinet committees there are five Mission Boards on growth, clean energy, safer streets, opportunities and health. The Mission Boards are chaired by the respective lead Secretaries of State with a remit to oversee the relevant mission.

===Non-Cabinet committees===
There are several committees for which the Cabinet Office is administratively responsible, but which are not Cabinet committees. These include the various &#x27;official&#x27; committees, which mostly shadow the Cabinet committees but with civil servants rather than ministers as members. Some others are:
* The Joint Intelligence Committee is an official committee that directs and oversees the UK intelligence and security agencies.
* The Prime Minister and Heads of Devolved Governments Council consists of the leaders of the UK and devolved administrations. Its secretariat is provided by the Cabinet Office but it is not a Cabinet committee.
* The Permanent Secretaries Management Group and Civil Service Steering Board are committees of the senior civil service, housed within the Cabinet Office.

==Historical statistics==

An approximate count of committees up to and during the Second World War was given by Wilson as follows.

This excludes committees which did not have at least one meeting (several of these existed solely as a means for documents to be circulated among the members). The 1939-45 figures do not include the Joint Intelligence Committee, Joint Planning Staff, or the Combined Chiefs of Staff.

===Former non-Cabinet committees===
* In the first years of the 2010 coalition government, the Coalition Operation and Strategic Planning Group (described as a &quot;working group&quot;, rather than a full committee) was to &quot;consider and resolve issues relating to the operation of the coalition agreement, the longer term strategic planning of Government Business and to report as necessary to the Coalition Committee&quot;. Its functions were later taken over by the &#x27;Quad&#x27; meetings attended by David Cameron, Nick Clegg, George Osborne, and Danny Alexander, with support from political aides and civil servants.
* The Joint Ministerial Committee was formed in 1999 consisted of ministers and officials from the UK and devolved administrations. It was superseded by Prime Minister and Heads of Devolved Governments Council in November 2022.

<doc id="164092" wikidata="Q161604" url="?curid=164092" title="Penny (United States coin)">
<text>The penny, also known as the cent, is a coin in the United States representing one-hundredth of a dollar. It has been the lowest face-value physical unit of U.S. currency since the abolition of the half-cent in 1857 (the abstract mill, which has never been minted, equal to a tenth of a cent, continues to see limited use in the fields of taxation and finance). 

The first U.S. cent was produced in 1787, and the cent has been issued primarily as a copper or copper-plated coin throughout its history. Due to inflation, pennies have lost virtually all their purchasing power and are often viewed as an expensive burden to businesses, banks, government (especially mints) and the public in general.

The penny was issued in its current form as the Lincoln cent, with its obverse featuring the profile of President Abraham Lincoln since 1909, the centennial of his birth. From 1959 (the sesquicentennial of Lincoln&#x27;s birth) to 2008, the reverse featured the Lincoln Memorial. Four different reverse designs in 2009 honored Lincoln&#x27;s 200th birthday and a new, &quot;permanent&quot; reverse – the Union Shield – was introduced in 2010. The coin is 0.75 inches (19.05 mm) in diameter and 0.0598 inches (1.52 mm) in thickness. The current copper-plated zinc cent issued since 1982 weighs 2.5 grams, while the previous 95% copper cent still found in circulation weighed 3.11 g (see further below).

The U.S. Mint&#x27;s official name for the coin is &quot;&quot; and the U.S. Treasury&#x27;s official name is &quot;one cent piece&quot;. The term &quot;penny&quot; derives from the British coin of the same name, which occupies a similar place in the British system. &quot;Pennies&quot; is the plural form (not to be confused with &quot;pence&quot;, which refers to the unit of currency).

In the early 2010s, the price of metal used to make pennies rose to a noticeable cost to the mint which peaked at more than 2¢, a negative seigniorage, for the $0.01 face-value coin. This pushed the mint to look for alternative metals again for the coin, and also brought the debate about eliminating the coin into more focus. On February 9, 2025, President Donald Trump said he instructed Scott Bessent, the secretary of the Treasury, to halt production of the penny.

==History of composition==
The composition of the penny has varied over time:
The isotope composition of early coins spanning the period 1828 to 1843 reflects the copper from Cornish ores from England, while coins after 1850 reflect the Keweenaw Peninsula, Michigan ores, a finding consistent with historical records.

In 1943, at the peak of World War II, zinc-coated steel cents were made for a short time because of war demands for copper. A few copper cents from 1943 were produced from 1942 planchets remaining in the bins. Similarly, some 1944 steel cents have been confirmed. From 1944 to 1946, salvaged ammunition shells made their way into the minting process, and it was not uncommon to see coins featuring streaks of brass or having a considerably darker finish than other issues.

During the early 1970s, the price of copper rose to the point where the cent contained almost one cent&#x27;s worth of copper. This led the Mint to test alternative metals, including aluminum and bronze-clad steel. Aluminum was chosen, and over 1.5 million samples of the 1974 aluminum cent were struck before ultimately being rejected.

The cent&#x27;s composition was changed in 1982 because the value of the copper in the coin started to rise above one cent. Some 1982 cents used the 97.5% zinc composition, while others used the 95% copper composition. United States cents minted after 1982 have been zinc with copper plating. The bronze and copper cents can be distinguished from the newer zinc cents by dropping the coins on a solid surface, or by flipping them in the air with your thumb. The predominantly zinc coins make a lower-pitched &quot;clunk&quot; when hitting the surface, and make no sound when flipped in the air; while the copper coins produce a higher-pitched ringing sound. In addition, a full 50-cent roll of pre-1982/3 coins weighs compared to a post-1982–83 roll which weighs .

==Designs==
The coin has gone through several designs over its two-hundred-year time frame. Until 1857 it was about the size of the current U.S. dollar coins (Susan B. Anthony through present dollars). Shown below are the different cent designs that have been produced; mintage figures can be found at United States cent mintage figures.

Large cents:
* Flowing Hair Chain 1793
* Flowing Hair Wreath 1793
* Liberty Cap 1793–1796
* Draped Bust 1796–1807

No cent coins were stamped with the year 1815. Shipments of copper planchets from the United Kingdom were embargoed during the War of 1812, and the Mint&#x27;s supply was exhausted in October 1814. Cent coins resumed minting in December 1815, though it is not clear whether these were stamped 1814 or 1816.

Throughout its history, the Lincoln cent has featured several typefaces for the date, but most of the digits have been old-style numerals, except with the 4 and 8 neither ascending nor descending. The only significant divergence is that the small 3 was non-descending (the same size as a 0, 1, or 2) in the early history, before switching to a descending, large 3 for the year 1934 and then permanently () in 1943. Similarly, the digit 5 was small and non-descending up to 1945.

==Lincoln cent==
The Lincoln cent is the current one-cent coin of the U.S. It was adopted in 1909 (which would have been Lincoln&#x27;s 100th birthday), replacing the Indian Head cent. Its reverse was changed in 1959 from a wheat-stalks design to a design which includes the Lincoln Memorial (to commemorate Lincoln&#x27;s sesquicentennial) and was replaced again in 2009 with four new designs to commemorate Lincoln&#x27;s bicentennial. There are more one-cent coins produced than any other denomination, which makes the Lincoln cent a familiar item. In its lifespan, this coin has weathered both world wars, one of which temporarily changed its composition as part of the war effort. The obverse design is the longest produced for any circulating American coin.

===History===
When the Lincoln one-cent coin made its initial appearance in 1909, it marked a radical departure from the accepted styling of United States coinage, as it was the first regular coin to bear a portrait other than the mythical Liberty which appeared on most pre-1909 regular coins. Previously, a strong feeling had prevailed against using portraits on coins in the United States, but public sentiment stemming from the 100th anniversary celebration of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s birth proved stronger than the long-standing tradition.

A variety of privately minted tokens bearing Lincoln&#x27;s image circulated as one-cent pieces during Lincoln&#x27;s presidency; legitimate coinage had become scarce during the Civil War. These early tokens undoubtedly influenced the denomination, appearance, size, and composition of Lincoln cents.

Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th U.S. president, thought American coins were so common and uninspiring that he attempted to get the motto &quot;In God We Trust&quot; removed as offending religion. Roosevelt had the opportunity to pose for a young Lithuanian-born Jew, Victor David Brenner, who, since arriving nineteen years earlier in the United States had become one of the nation&#x27;s premier medalists. Roosevelt had learned of Brenner&#x27;s talents in a settlement house on New York City&#x27;s Lower East Side and was immediately impressed with a bas-relief that Brenner had made of Lincoln, based on a Mathew Brady photograph. Roosevelt, who considered Lincoln the savior of the Union and the greatest Republican president, and who also considered himself Lincoln&#x27;s political heir, ordered the new Lincoln cent to be based on Brenner&#x27;s work and to be released just in time to commemorate Lincoln&#x27;s 100th birthday in 1909. The likeness of President Lincoln on the obverse of the coin is an adaptation of a plaque Brenner created several years earlier which had come to the attention of President Roosevelt in New York.

In addition to the prescribed elements on U.S. coins—LIBERTY and the date—the motto In God We Trust appeared for the first time on a coin of this denomination. The United States Congress passed the Act of March 3, 1865, authorizing the use of this motto on U.S. coins, during Lincoln&#x27;s tenure in office.

Even though no legislation was required for the new design, approval of the Secretary of the Treasury was necessary to make the change. Franklin MacVeagh gave his approval on July 14, 1909, and not quite three weeks later, on August 2, the new coin was released to the public.

===Wheat cent (1909–1958)===
A study of three potential reverses resulted in the approval of a very simple design bearing two wheatheads in memorial style. Between these, in the center of the coin, are the denomination and UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, while curving around the upper border is the national motto, &quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot;, Latin for &quot;Out of Many, One&quot;.

The original model bore Brenner&#x27;s name on the reverse, curving along the rim below UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Before the coins were issued, however, the initials &quot;VDB&quot; were substituted because officials at the United States Mint felt the name was too prominent. After the coin was released, many protested that even the initials were conspicuous and detracted from the design. Because the coin was in great demand, and because to make a change would have required halting production, the decision was made to eliminate the initials entirely. In 1918, after the controversy over Brenner&#x27;s name and initials on the reverse had died down, his initials were placed on the obverse with no further controversy. They are to be found in minute form on the rim of the bust, just under the shoulder of Lincoln.

Thus in 1909 the U.S. had six different cents: the 1909 and 1909-S Indian Head cents, and four Lincoln coins: 1909 VDB, 1909-S VDB, 1909 and 1909-S. In all cases the Philadelphia mintages far exceeded the San Francisco issues. While the smallest mintage is the &#x27;09-S Indian, the &#x27;09-S VDB is the key Lincoln date, and hence is most valuable. Its mintage of 484,000 is only 1.7% of the plain V.D.B.

===Lincoln Memorial cent (1959–2008)===

On February 12, 1959, a revised reverse design was introduced as part of the 150th anniversary of Lincoln&#x27;s birth. No formal competition was held. Frank Gasparro, then Assistant Engraver at the Philadelphia Mint, prepared the winning entry, selected from a group of 23 models that the engraving staff at the Mint had been asked to present for consideration. Again, only the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury was necessary to make the change because the design had been in use for more than the required 25 years. The imposing marble Lincoln Memorial provides the central motif, with the legends &quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot; and UNITED STATES OF AMERICA completing the design, together with the denomination. The initials &quot;FG&quot; appear on the right, near the shrubbery. This series is noteworthy for having the image of Abraham Lincoln both on the obverse and reverse, as his likeness can be discerned at the center of the memorial on the reverse.

===Lincoln Bicentennial cents (2009)===
The Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005 required that the cent&#x27;s reverse be redesigned in 2009. This resulted in the mintage of four different coins showing scenes from Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s life in honor of the bicentennial of his birth.

These four designs, unveiled September 22, 2008, at a ceremony held at the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., are:
* Birth and early childhood in Kentucky: this design features a log cabin and Lincoln&#x27;s birth year 1809. It was designed by Richard Masters and sculpted by Jim Licaretz. This cent was released into circulation on Lincoln&#x27;s 200th birthday, February 12, 2009, at a special ceremony at LaRue County High School in Hodgenville, Kentucky, Lincoln&#x27;s birthplace. The mintage was extremely low compared to prior years (see Lincoln cent mintage figures). It has been nicknamed the &quot;Log Cabin Penny&quot;.
* Formative years in Indiana: this design features a young Lincoln reading while taking a break from rail splitting. It was designed and sculpted by Charles Vickers. Nicknamed the &quot;Indiana Penny&quot;, it was released on May 14, 2009.
* Professional life in Illinois: this design features a young professional Lincoln standing before the Illinois State Capitol, in Springfield. It was designed by Joel Iskowitz and sculpted by Don Everhart. Nicknamed the &quot;Illinois Penny&quot;, it was released on August 13, 2009.
* Presidency in Washington, D.C.: this design features the half-completed Capitol dome. It was designed by Susan Gamble and sculpted by Joseph Menna. This fourth cent was released to the public on November 12, 2009. U.S. Mint released collector&#x27;s sets containing this design in copper prior to the public launch of this design in zinc.

Special 2009 cents struck for sale in sets to collectors had the metallic copper content of cents minted in 1909 (95% copper, 5% tin and zinc). Those struck for circulation retained the normal composition of a zinc core coated with copper.

===Union shield cent (2010–present)===

The 2005 act that authorized the redesign for the Bicentennial stated that another redesigned reverse for the Lincoln cent will be minted which &quot;shall bear an image emblematic of President Lincoln&#x27;s preservation of the United States of America as a single and united country&quot;. Eighteen designs were proposed for the reverse of the 2010 cent. On April 16, 2009, the Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) met and selected a design that showed 13 wheat sheaves bound together with a ring symbolizing American unity as one nation. Later this design was withdrawn because it was similar to coinage issued in Germany in the 1920s. The Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee later met and chose a design showing a Union shield with superimposed in a scroll; E Pluribus Unum was also depicted in the upper portion of the shield. In June 2009 the CFA met again and chose a design featuring a modern rendition of the American flag.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccac/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of the release ceremony for the last of the 2009 cents on November 12, the design for the 2010 cent was announced. The design chosen was the one that was chosen earlier by the CCAC. According to the Mint, the 13 stripes on the shield &quot;represent the states joined in one compact union to support the Federal government, represented by the horizontal bar above&quot;. The Mint also noted that a shield was commonly used in paintings in the Capitol hallways painted by Constantino Brumidi, an artist in the Capitol active during the Lincoln Presidency. 

The obverse of the cent was also changed to a modern rendition of Brenner&#x27;s design. The new Union Shield design replaces the Lincoln memorial in use since 1959. The coin was designed by artist Lyndall Bass and sculpted by U.S. Mint sculptor-engraver Joseph Menna. In January 2010, the coins were released early in Puerto Rico; this was caused by a shortage of 2009-dated pennies on the island. The new design was released at a ceremony at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield, Illinois on February 11, 2010. In 2017, cents minted in Philadelphia were struck with a &quot;P&quot; mintmark to celebrate the 225th anniversary of the U.S. Mint. 2017 is the only year that Philadelphia cents have had a mintmark. In 2019, the West Point Mint minted pennies marked with a &quot;W&quot; mintmark for the first time, which were only available with their annual sets, wrapped separately in their own plastic wrap. An uncirculated cent was included with the uncirculated mint set, a proof cent with the proof set, and a reverse proof with the silver proof set.

==Criticism of continued use==
===Proposals to eliminate===

It has been suggested that the penny should be eliminated as a unit of currency for several reasons. , about a quarter trillion pennies are estimated to be in circulation, or more than 700 pennies for each person in the United States. Many Americans do not actually spend pennies, but rather only receive them in change at stores and proceed to store them at home, or perhaps return them to a bank for higher denomination currencies, or cash them in at coin counting kiosks. Most modern vending machines do not accept pennies, further diminishing their utility. In addition, the production cost now exceeds the face value of the coin, caused by increasing inflation. 

In 2001 and 2006, for example, United States Representative Jim Kolbe (R) of Arizona introduced bills which would have stopped production of pennies (in 2001, the Legal Tender Modernization Act, and in 2006, the Currency Overhaul for an Industrious Nation [COIN] Act).

In anticipation of the business of melting down U.S. pennies and U.S. nickels for profit, the U.S. Mint, which is a part of the US Department of the Treasury, implemented new regulations on December 14, 2006, which criminalize the melting of pennies and nickels and place limits on export of the coins. Violators can be punished with a fine of up to $10,000 USD, imprisoned for a maximum of five years, or both.

On February 9, 2025, President Trump said he instructed Scott Bessent, the secretary of the Treasury, to halt production of the penny, citing its high production costs.

===Metal content and manufacturing costs===
The price of metal drives the cost to manufacture a cent. The Secretary of the Treasury has authority to alter the percentage of copper and zinc in the one-cent coin if needed due to cost fluctuations. For years, the Mint&#x27;s production and shipping costs for cents have exceeded the face value of the coin (the Mint&#x27;s fixed costs and overhead, however, are absorbed by other circulating coins). As a result, the U.S. Treasury loses tens of millions of dollars every year producing cents. For example, the loss in 2013 was $55 million.

When copper reached a record high in February 2011, the melt value of a 95% copper cent was more than three times its face value. As of January 21, 2014, a pre-1982 cent contained 2.203 cents&#x27; worth of copper and zinc, making it an attractive target for melting by people wanting to sell the metals for profit. In comparison, post-1982 copper-plated zinc cents have a metallurgical value of only 0.552 cent. Prior to 1982, the fluctuating price of copper periodically caused penny shortages, as people hoarded them for their perceived metallic value.

===Toxicity===

Zinc, a major component of U.S. cents minted after mid-1982, is toxic in large quantities. Swallowing such a coin, which is 97.5% zinc, can cause damage to the stomach lining because of the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach. Coins are the most commonly ingested foreign body in children but generally are allowed to pass spontaneously unless the patient is symptomatic. Zinc toxicity, mostly in the form of the ingestion of U.S. pennies minted after 1982, is commonly fatal in dogs where it causes a severe hemolytic anemia. It is also highly toxic in pet parrots and can often be fatal.

<doc id="164095" wikidata="Q2914277" url="?curid=164095" title="Moral panic">
<text>A moral panic is a widespread feeling of fear that some evil person or thing threatens the values, interests, or well-being of a community or society. It is &quot;the process of arousing social concern over an issue&quot;, usually perpetuated by moral entrepreneurs and mass media coverage, and exacerbated by politicians and lawmakers. Moral panic can give rise to new laws aimed at controlling the community.

Stanley Cohen, who developed the term, states that moral panic happens when &quot;a condition, episode, person or group of persons emerges to become defined as a threat to societal values and interests&quot;. While the issues identified may be real, the claims &quot;exaggerate the seriousness, extent, typicality and/or inevitability of harm&quot;. Moral panics are now studied in sociology and criminology, media studies, and cultural studies. It is often academically considered irrational (see Cohen&#x27;s model of moral panic, below).

Examples of moral panic include the belief in widespread abduction of children by predatory pedophiles and belief in ritual abuse of women and children by Satanic cults. Some moral panics can become embedded in standard political discourse, which include concepts such as the Red Scare, racism, and terrorism.

It differs from mass hysteria, which is closer to a psychological illness rather than a sociological phenomenon.

== History and development ==
Though the term &quot;moral panic&quot; was used in 1830 by a religious magazine regarding a sermon, it was used in a way that completely differs from its modern social science application. The phrase was used again in 1831, with an intent that is possibly closer to its modern use.

Though not using the term &quot;moral panic&quot;, Marshall McLuhan, in his 1964 book &quot;Understanding Media&quot;, articulated the concept academically in describing the effects of media.

As a social theory or sociological concept, the concept was first developed in the United Kingdom by Stanley Cohen, who introduced the phrase &quot;moral panic&quot; in a 1967–1969 PhD thesis that became the basis for his 1972 book &quot;Folk Devils and Moral Panics&quot;. In the book, Cohen describes the reaction among the British public to the rivalry between the &quot;mod&quot; and &quot;rocker&quot; youth subcultures of the 1960s and 1970s. Cohen&#x27;s initial development of the concept was for the purpose of analyzing the definition of and social reaction to these subcultures as a social problem.

According to Cohen, a moral panic occurs when a &quot;condition, episode, person or group of persons emerges to become defined as a threat to societal values and interests.&quot; To Cohen, those who start the panic after fearing a threat to prevailing social or cultural values are &#x27;moral entrepreneurs&#x27;, while those who supposedly threaten social order have been described as &#x27;folk devils&#x27;.

In the early 1990s, Erich Goode and Nachman Ben-Yehuda produced an &quot;attributional&quot; model that placed more emphasis on strict definition than cultural processes.

=== Differences in British and American definitions ===
Many sociologists have pointed out the differences between definitions of a &quot;moral panic&quot; as described by American versus British sociologists. Kenneth Thompson claimed that American sociologists tended to emphasize psychological factors, while the British portrayed &quot;moral panics&quot; as crises of capitalism.

British criminologist Jock Young used the term in his participant observation study of drug consumption in Porthmadog, Wales, between 1967 and 1969. In &quot;Policing the Crisis: Mugging, the State and Law and Order&quot; (1978), Marxist Stuart Hall and his colleagues studied the public reaction to the phenomenon of mugging and the perception that it had recently been imported from American culture into the UK. Employing Cohen&#x27;s definition of &quot;moral panic&quot;, Hall and colleagues theorized that the &quot;rising crime rate equation&quot; performs an ideological function relating to social control. Crime statistics, in Hall&#x27;s view, are often manipulated for political and economic purposes; moral panics could thereby be ignited to create public support for the need to &quot;police the crisis&quot;.

==Cohen&#x27;s model of moral panic==

First to name the phenomenon, Stanley Cohen investigated a series of &quot;moral panics&quot; in his 1972 book &quot;Folk Devils and Moral Panics&quot;. In the book, Cohen describes the reaction among the British public to the seaside rivalry between the &quot;mod&quot; and &quot;rocker&quot; youth subcultures of the 1960s and 1970s. In a moral panic, Cohen says, &quot;the untypical is made typical&quot;.

Cohen&#x27;s initial development of the concept was for the purpose of analyzing the definition of and social reaction to these subcultures as a social problem. He was interested in demonstrating how agents of social control amplified deviance, in that they potentially damaged the identities of those labeled as &quot;deviant&quot; and invited them to embrace deviant identities and behavior. According to Cohen, these groups were labelled as being outside the central core values of consensual society and as posing a threat to both the values of society and society itself, hence the term &quot;folk devils&quot;.

Setting out to test his hypotheses on mods and rockers, Cohen ended up in a rather different place: he discovered a pattern of construction and reaction with greater foothold than mods and rockersthe moral panic. He thereby identified five sequential stages of moral panic.

Characterizing the reactions to the mod and rocker conflict, he identified four key agents in moral panics: mass media, moral entrepreneurs, the culture of social control, and the public.

In a more recent edition of &quot;Folk Devils and Moral Panics&quot;, Cohen suggested that the term &quot;panic&quot; in itself connotes irrationality and a lack of control. Cohen maintained that &quot;panic&quot; is a suitable term when used as an extended metaphor.

=== Cohen&#x27;s stages of moral panic ===
Setting out to test his hypotheses on mods and rockers, Cohen discovered a pattern of construction and reaction with greater foothold than mods and rockersthe moral panic.

According to Cohen, there are five sequential stages in the construction of a moral panic:

# An event, condition, episode, person, or group of persons is perceived and defined as a threat to societal values, safety, and interests.
# The nature of these apparent threats are amplified by the mass media, who present the supposed threat through simplistic, symbolic rhetoric. Such portrayals appeal to public prejudices, creating an evil in need of social control (folk devils) and victims (the moral majority).
# A sense of social anxiety and concern among the public is aroused through these symbolic representations of the threat.
# The gatekeepers of moralityeditors, religious leaders, politicians, and other &quot;moral&quot;-thinking peoplerespond to the threat, with socially-accredited experts pronouncing their diagnoses and solutions to the &quot;threat&quot;. This includes new laws or policies.
# The condition then disappears, submerges or deteriorates and becomes more visible.

Cohen observed further:

Sometimes the object of the panic is quite novel and at other times it is something which has been in existence long enough, but suddenly appears in the limelight. Sometimes the panic passes over and is forgotten, except in folk-lore and collective memory; at other times it has more serious and long-lasting repercussions and might produce such changes as those in legal and social policy or even in the way the society conceives itself.

=== Agents of moral panic ===
Characterizing the reactions to the mod and rocker conflict, Cohen identified four key agents in moral panics: mass media, moral entrepreneurs, the culture of social control, and the public.
* Media – especially key in the early stage of social reaction, producing &quot;processed or coded images&quot; of deviance and the deviants. This involves three processes:

*# exaggeration and distortion of who did or said what;
*# prediction, the dire consequences of failure to act;
*# symbolization, signifying a person, word, or thing as a threat.
* Moral entrepreneurs – individuals and groups who target deviant behavior
* Societal control culture – comprises those with institutional power: the police, the courts, and local and national politicians. They are made aware of the nature and extent of the &#x27;threat&#x27;; concern is passed up the chain of command to the national level, where control measures are instituted.
* The public – these include individuals and groups. They have to decide who and what to believe: in the mod and rocker case, the public initially distrusted media messages, but ultimately believed them.

==Mass media==
The concept of &quot;moral panic&quot; has also been linked to certain assumptions about the mass media. In recent times, the mass media have become important players in the dissemination of moral indignation, even when they do not appear to be consciously engaged in sensationalism or in muckraking. Simply reporting a subset of factual statements without contextual nuance can be enough to generate concern, anxiety, or panic.

Cohen stated that the mass media is the primary source of the public&#x27;s knowledge about deviance and social problems. He further argued that moral panic gives rise to the folk devil by labelling actions and people. Christian Joppke furthers the importance of media as he notes shifts in public attention &quot;can trigger the decline of movements and fuel the rise of others.&quot;

According to Cohen, the media appear in any or all three roles in moral panic dramas:

* Setting the agendaselecting deviant or socially problematic events deemed as newsworthy, then using finer filters to select which events are candidates for moral panic.
* Transmitting the imagestransmitting the claims by using the rhetoric of moral panics.
* Breaking the silence and making the claim.

== Goode and Ben-Yehuda&#x27;s attributional model ==
In their 1994 book &quot;Moral Panics: The Social Construction of Deviance&quot;, Erich Goode and Nachman Ben-Yehuda take a social constructionist approach to moral panics, challenging the assumption that sociology is able to define, measure, explain, and ameliorate social problems.

Reviewing empirical studies in the social constructionist perspective, Goode and Ben-Yehuda produced an &quot;attributional&quot; model that identifies essential characteristics and placed more emphasis on strict definition than cultural processes. They arrived at five defining &quot;elements&quot;, or &quot;criteria&quot;, of a moral panic:

# Concern – there is &quot;heightened level of concern over the behaviour of a certain group or category&quot; and its consequences; in other words, there is the belief that the behavior of the group or activity deemed deviant is likely to have a negative effect on society. Concern can be indicated via opinion polls, media coverage, and lobbying activity.
# Hostility – there is &quot;an increased level of &quot;hostility&quot;&quot; toward the deviants, who are &quot;collectively designated as the enemy, or an enemy, of respectable society&quot;. These deviants are constructed as &quot;folk devils&quot;, and a clear division forms between &quot;them&quot; and &quot;us&quot;.
# Consensus – &quot;there must be at least a certain minimal measure of consensus&quot; across society as a whole, or at least &quot;designated segments&quot; of it, that &quot;the threat is real, serious and caused by the wrongdoing group members and their behaviour&quot;. This is to say, though concern does not have to be nationwide, there must be widespread acceptance that the group in question poses a very real threat to society. It is important at this stage that the &quot;moral entrepreneurs&quot; are vocal and the &quot;folk devils&quot; appear weak and disorganized.
# Disproportionality – &quot;public concern is in excess of what is appropriate if concern were directly proportional to objective harm&quot;. More simply, the action taken is disproportionate to the actual threat posed by the accused group. According to Goode and Ben-Yehuda, &quot;the concept of moral panic &quot;rests&quot; on disproportion&quot;. As such, statistics are exaggerated or fabricated, and the existence of other equally or more harmful activity is denied.
# Volatility – moral panics are highly volatile and tend to disappear as quickly as they appeared because public interest wanes or news reports change to another narrative.

Goode and Ben-Yehuda also examined three competing explanations of moral panics:

# the grass-roots model – the source of panic is identified as widespread anxieties about real or imagined threats.
# the elite-engineered model – an elite group induces, or engineers, a panic over an issue that they know to be exaggerated in order to move attention away from their own lack of solving social problems.
# the interest group theory – &quot;the middle rungs of power and status&quot; are where moral issues are most significantly felt.

Similarly, writing about the Blue Whale Challenge and the Momo Challenge as examples of moral panics, Benjamin Radford listed themes that he commonly observed in modern versions of these phenomena:

* Hidden dangers of modern technology.
* Evil stranger manipulating the innocent.
* A &quot;hidden world&quot; of anonymous evil people.

==Topic clusters==
In over 40 years of extensive study, researchers have identified several general clusters of topics that help describe the way in which moral panics operate and the impact they have. Some of the more common clusters identified are: child abuse, drugs and alcohol, immigration, media technologies, and street crime.

===Child abuse===
Exceptional cases of physical or sexual abuse against children have driven policies based on child protection, regardless of their frequency or contradicting evidence from experts. While discoveries about pedophilia in the priesthood and among celebrities has somewhat altered the original notion of pedophiles being complete strangers, their presence in and around the family is hardly acknowledged.

===Alcohol and other drugs===
Substances used for pleasure such as alcohol and other drugs are popularly subject to legal action and criminalization due to their alleged harms to the health of those who partake in them or general order on the streets. Recent examples include methamphetamine, mephedrone, and designer drugs.

===Immigration===
A series of moral panic is likely to recur whenever humans migrate to a foreign location to live alongside the native or indigenous population, particularly if the newcomers are of a different skin color or religion. These immigrants may be accused of: bringing alien cultures and refusing to integrate with the mainstream culture; putting strain on welfare, education, and housing systems; and excessive involvement in crime.

===Media technologies===
The advent of any new medium of communication produces anxieties among those who deem themselves as protectors of childhood and culture. Their fears are often based on a lack of knowledge as to the actual capacities or usage of the medium. Moralizing organizations, such as those motivated by religion, commonly advocate censorship, while parents remain concerned.

According to media studies professor Kirsten Drotner:

[E]very time a new mass medium has entered the social scene, it has spurred public debates on social and cultural norms, debates that serve to reflect, negotiate and possibly revise these very norms.… In some cases, debate of a new medium brings about – indeed changes into – heated, emotional reactions … what may be defined as a media panic.Recent manifestations of this kind of development include cyberbullying and sexting.

===Street crime===
A central concern of modern mass media has been interpersonal crime. When new types or patterns of crime emerge, coverage expands considerably, especially when said crime involves increased violence or the use of weapons. Sustaining the idea that crime is out of control, this keeps prevalent the fear of being randomly attacked on the street by violent young men.

==Examples==
Researchers have considered a number of historical and current events to meet the criteria set out by Stanley Cohen.

=== Historic examples ===
==== Nativist movement and the Know-Nothing Party (1840s–1860s) ====
The brief success of the Know-Nothing Party in the US during the 1850s can be understood as resulting from a moral panic over Irish Catholic immigration dating back to the 1840s, particularly as it related to religion, politics, and jobs. Nativist criticism of immigrants from Catholic nations centered upon the control of the Pope over church members. The concern regarding the social threat led the Know-Nothing Party in the 1856 presidential election to win 21.5% of the vote. The quick decline in political success for the Know-Nothing Party as a result of a decline in concern for the perceived social threat is an indicative feature of the movements situated in moral panic.

==== Red Scare (1919–1920, late 1940s–1950s) ====
During the years 1919 to 1920, followed by the late 1940s to the 1950s, the United States had a moral panic over communism and feared being attacked by the Soviet Union. In the late 1940s and the 1950s, a period now known as the McCarthy Era, Senator Joseph McCarthy used his power as a senator to conduct a witch hunt for communists he claimed had infiltrated all levels of American society, including Hollywood, the State Department, and the armed forces. When he began, he held little influence or respect within the Senate, but he exploited Americans&#x27; fears of communism (and Congress&#x27; desire to not lose re-election) to rise to prominence and keep the hunt going in spite of an increasingly apparent lack of evidence, often accusing those who dared oppose him of being communists themselves.

==== &quot;The Devil&#x27;s music&quot; (1920s–1980s) ====
Over the years, there has been concern of various types of new music causing spiritual or otherwise moral corruption to younger generations, often called &quot;the devil&#x27;s music&quot;. While the types of music popularly labeled as such has changed with time, along with the intended meaning of the term, this basic factor of the moral panic has remained constant. It could thus be argued that this is really a series of smaller moral panics that fall under a larger umbrella. While most notable in the United States, other countries such as Romania have seen exposure to or promotion of the idea as well.

Blues was one of the first music genres to receive this label, mainly due to a perception that it incited violence and other poor behavior. In the early 20th century, the blues was considered disreputable, especially as white audiences began listening to the blues during the 1920s.

Jazz was another early receiver of the label. At the time, traditionalists considered jazz to contribute to the breakdown of morality. Despite the veiled attacks on blues and jazz as &quot;negro music&quot; often going hand-in-hand with other attacks on the genres, urban middle-class African Americans perceived jazz as &quot;devil&#x27;s music&quot;, and agreed with the beliefs that jazz&#x27;s improvised rhythms and sounds were promoting promiscuity.

Some have speculated that the rock phase of the panic in the 1970s and 1980s contributed to the popularity of the satanic ritual abuse alleged moral panic in the 1980s.

==== Comic books (1950s) ====
In the United States, substantial limits were placed on comic book content during the 1950s, especially in the horror and crime genres. This moral panic was promoted by the psychologist Fredric Wertham, who claimed that comics were a major source of juvenile delinquency, arguing in his book &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; that they predisposed children to violence. Comic books appeared in congressional hearings, and organisations promoted book burnings. Wertham&#x27;s work resulted in the creation of the Comics Code, which drastically limited what kind of content could be published. As a result of these limitations, many comics publishers and illustrators were forced to leave the profession, and the content produced by those that remained became tamer and more focused on superheroes.

During the following decades, the Comics Code was loosened in scope before finally being abolished in 2011.

==== Switchblades (1950s) ====
In the United States, a 1950 article titled &quot;The Toy That Kills&quot; in the &quot;Women&#x27;s Home Companion&quot;, about automatic knives, or &quot;switchblades&quot;, sparked significant controversy. It was further fuelled by highly popular films of the late 1950s, including &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955), &quot;Crime in the Streets&quot; (1956), &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; (1957), &quot;The Delinquents&quot;, &quot;High School Confidential&quot; (1958), and the 1957 Broadway musical &quot;West Side Story&quot;.

Fixation on the switchblade as the symbol of youth violence, sex, and delinquency resulted in demands from the public and Congress to control the sale and possession of such knives. State laws restricting or criminalizing switchblade possession and use were adopted by an increasing number of state legislatures, and many of the restrictive laws around them worldwide date back to this period.

==== Mods and rockers (1960s) ====
In early 1960s Britain, the two main youth subcultures were Mods and Rockers. The &quot;Mods and Rockers&quot; conflict was explored as an instance of moral panic by sociologist Stanley Cohen in his seminal study &quot;Folk Devils and Moral Panics&quot;, which examined media coverage of the Mod and Rocker riots in the 1960s.

Although Cohen acknowledged that Mods and Rockers engaged in street fighting in the mid-1960s, he argued that they were no different from the evening brawls that occurred between non-Mod and non-Rocker youths throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, both at seaside resorts and after football games.

==== &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (1980s–1990s) ====
At various times, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and other tabletop role-playing games have been accused of promoting such practices as Satanism, witchcraft, suicide, pornography and murder. In the 1980s and later, some groups, especially fundamentalist Christian groups, accused the games of encouraging interest in sorcery and the veneration of demons.

==== HIV/AIDS (1980s–1990s) ====
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a viral illness that may lead to or exacerbate other health conditions such as pneumonia, fungal infections, tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, and cytomegalovirus. A meeting of the British Sociological Association&#x27;s South West and Wales Study entitled &quot;AIDS: The Latest Moral Panic&quot; was prompted by the growing interest of medical sociologists in AIDS, as well as that of UK health care professionals working in the field of health education. It took place at a time when both groups were beginning to voice an increased concern with the growing media attention and fear-mongering that AIDS was attracting. In the 1980s, a moral panic was created within the media over HIV/AIDS. For example, in Britain, a prominent advertisement by the government suggested that the public was uninformed about HIV/AIDS due to a lack of publicly accessible and accurate information.

The media outlets nicknamed HIV/AIDS the &quot;gay plague&quot;, which further stigmatized the disease. However, scientists gained a far better understanding of HIV/AIDS as it grew in the 1980s and moved into the 1990s and beyond. The illness was still negatively viewed by many as either being caused by or passed on through the gay community. Once it became clear that this was not the case, the moral panic created by the media changed to blaming the overall negligence of ethical standards by the younger generation (both male and female), resulting in another moral panic. Authors behind &quot;AIDS: Rights, Risk, and Reason&quot; argued that &quot;British TV and press coverage is locked into an agenda which blocks out any approach to the subject which does not conform in advance to the values and language of a profoundly homophobic culture—a culture that does not regard gay men as fully or properly human. No distinction obtains for the agenda between &#x27;quality&#x27; and &#x27;tabloid&#x27; newspapers, or between &#x27;popular&#x27; and &#x27;serious&#x27; television.&quot;

Similarly, reports of a group of AIDS cases amongst gay men in Southern California which suggested that a sexually transmitted infectious agent might be the etiological agent led to several terms relating to homosexuality being coined for the disease, including &quot;gay plague&quot;.

==== Dangerous dogs (late 1980s – early 1990s) ====
After a series of high-profile dog attacks on children in the United Kingdom, the British press began to engage in a campaign against so-called dangerous dog breeds, especially pit bulls and Rottweilers, which bore all the hallmarks of a moral panic.

This media pressure led the government to hastily introduce the &quot;Dangerous Dogs Act&quot; 1991 which has been criticised as &quot;among the worst pieces of legislation ever seen, a poorly thought-out knee-jerk reaction to tabloid headlines that was rushed through Parliament without proper scrutiny.&quot; The act specifically focused on pit bulls, which were associated with the lower social strata of British society, rather than the Rottweilers and Dobermann Pinschers generally owned by richer social groups. Critics have identified the presence of social class as a factor in the dangerous dogs moral panic, with establishment anxieties about the &quot;sub-proletarian&quot; sector of British society displaced onto the folk devil of the &quot;Dangerous dog&quot;.

=== Ongoing historic examples ===
==== Increase in crime (1970s–present) ====

Fear of increasing crime rates is often the cause of moral panics. In fact, the rates of many types of crime have declined by 50% or more beginning in the mid to late 1980s and early 1990s. In Europe, crime statistics show this is part of a broader pattern of crime decline since the late Middle Ages, with a reversal from the 1960s to the 1980s and 1990s, before the decline continued.

This phenomenon, which often taps into a population&#x27;s herd mentality, continues to occur in various cultures. In some cases, the perception of increased crime can be caused by increased reporting of crimes or by better record-keeping. Japanese jurist Koichi Hamai explains how the changes in crime recording in Japan since the 1990s caused people to believe that the crime rate was rising and that crimes were getting increasingly severe.

==== Violence and video games (1970s–present) ====

There have been calls to regulate violence in video games for nearly as long as the video game industry has existed, with &quot;Death Race&quot; being a notable early example. In the 1990s, improvements in video game technology allowed for more lifelike depictions of violence in games such as &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; and &quot;Doom&quot;. The industry attracted controversy over violent content and concerns about effects they might have on players, generating frequent media stories that attempted to associate video games with violent behavior, in addition to a number of academic studies that reported conflicting findings about the strength of correlations. According to Christopher Ferguson, sensationalist media reports and the scientific community unintentionally worked together in &quot;promoting an unreasonable fear of violent video games&quot;. Concerns from parts of the public about violent games led to cautionary, often exaggerated news stories, warnings from politicians and other public figures, and calls for research to prove the connection, which in turn led to studies &quot;speaking beyond the available data and allowing the promulgation of extreme claims without the usual scientific caution and skepticism&quot;.

Since the 1990s, there have been attempts to regulate violent video games in the United States through congressional bills as well as within the industry. Public concern and media coverage of violent video games reached a high point following the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, after which videos were found of the perpetrators, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, talking about violent games like &quot;Doom&quot; and making comparisons between the acts they intended to carry out and aspects of games.

Ferguson and others have explained the video game moral panic as part of a cycle that all new media go through. In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association&quot; that legally restricting sales of video games to minors would be unconstitutional and deemed the research presented in favour of regulation as &quot;unpersuasive&quot;.

==== War on drugs (1970s–present) ====
Some critics have pointed to moral panic as an explanation for the War on Drugs. For example, a Royal Society of Arts commission concluded that &quot;the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 ... is driven more by &#x27;moral panic&#x27; than by a practical desire to reduce harm&quot;.

Some have written that one of the many rungs supporting the moral panic behind the War on Drugs was a separate but related moral panic, which peaked in the late 1990s, involving media&#x27;s gross exaggeration of the frequency of the surreptitious use of date rape drugs. News media have been criticized for advocating &quot;grossly excessive protective measures for women, particularly in coverage between 1996 and 1998&quot;, for overstating the threat and for excessively dwelling on the topic. For example, a 2009 Australian study found that drug panel tests were unable to detect any drug in any of the 97 instances of patients admitted to the hospital believing their drinks might have been spiked.

==== Sex offenders, child sexual abuse, and pedophilia (1970s–present) ====
The media narrative of a sex offender, highlighting egregious offenses as typical behaviour of any sex offender, and media distorting the facts of some cases, has led legislators to attack judicial discretion, making sex offender registration mandatory based on certain listed offenses rather than individual risk or the actual severity of the crime, thus practically catching less serious offenders under the domain of harsh sex offender laws. In the 1990s and 2000s, there have been instances of moral panics in the United Kingdom and the United States, related to colloquial uses of the term &quot;pedophilia&quot; to refer to such unusual crimes as high-profile cases of child abduction.

The moral panic over pedophilia began in the 1970s after the sexual revolution. While homosexuality was becoming more socially accepted after the sexual revolution, pro-contact pedophiles believed that the sexual revolution never helped them. In the 1970s, pro-contact pedophile activist organizations such as Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) and North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) were formed in October 1974 and December 1978, respectively. Despite receiving some support, PIE received much backlash when they advocated for abolishing or lowering age of consent laws. As a result, people protested against PIE.

Until the first half of the 1970s, sex was not yet part of the concept of domestic child abuse, which used to be limited to physical abuse and neglect. The sexual part of child abuse became prominent in the United States due to the encounter of two political agendas: the fight against battered child syndrome by pediatricians during the 1960s and the feminist anti-rape movement, in particular the denunciation of domestic sexual violence. These two movements overlapped in 1975, creating a new political agenda about child sexual abuse. Laura Lowenkron wrote: &quot;The strong political and emotional appeal of the theme of &#x27;child sexual abuse&#x27; strengthened the feminist criticism of the patriarchal family structure, according to which domestic violence is linked to the unequal power between men and women and between adults and children.&quot; Although the concern over child sexual abuse was caused by feminists, the concern over child sexual abuse also attracted traditional groups and conservative groups. Lowenkron added: &quot;Concerned about the increasing expansion and acceptance of so-called &#x27;sexual deviations&#x27; during what was called the libertarian age from the 1960s to the early 1970s&quot;, conservative groups and traditional groups &quot;saw in the fight against &#x27;child sexual abuse&#x27; the chance&quot; to &quot;revive fears about crime and sexual dangers&quot;.

In the 1980s, the media began to report more frequently on cases of children being raped, kidnapped, or murdered, leading to the moral panic over sex offenders and pedophiles becoming very intense in the early 1980s. In 1981, for instance, a six-year-old boy named Adam Walsh was abducted, murdered, and beheaded. Investigators believe the murderer was serial killer Ottis Toole. The murder of Adam Walsh took over nationwide news and led to a moral panic over child abduction, followed by the creation of new laws for missing children. According to criminologist Richard Moran, the Walsh case &quot;created a nation of petrified kids and paranoid parents ... Kids used to be able to go out and organize a stickball game, and now all playdates and the social lives of children are arranged and controlled by the parents.&quot;

Also during the 1980s, inaccurate and heavily flawed data about sex offenders and their recidivism rates was published. This data led to the public believing sex offenders to have a particularly high recidivism rate; this in turn led to the creation of sex offender registries. Later information revealed that sex offenders, including child sex offenders, have a low recidivism rate. Other highly publicized cases, similar to the murder of Adam Walsh, that contributed to the creation of sex offender registries and sex offender laws include the abduction and murder of 11-year-old boy Jacob Wetterling in 1989; the rape and murder of 7-year-old girl Megan Kanka in 1994; and the rape and murder of 9-year-old girl Jessica Lunsford in 2005.

Another contributing factor in the moral panic over pedophiles and sex offenders was the day-care sex-abuse hysteria in the 1980s and early 1990s, including the McMartin preschool trial. This led to a panic where parents became hypervigilant with concerns of predatory child sex offenders seeking to abduct children in public spaces, such as playgrounds.

=== Contemporary examples ===

==== Satanic panic (1980s–present) ====
The &quot;satanic panic&quot; was a series of moral panics regarding satanic ritual abuse that originated in the United States and spread to other English-speaking countries in the 1980s and 1990s, which led to a string of wrongful convictions. The West Memphis Three were three teenagers falsely accused of murdering children in a satanic ritual. Two were sentenced to life in prison and one was sentenced to death, before all being released after 18 years in prison.

==== Human trafficking (2000–present) ====
Many critics of contemporary anti-prostitution activism argue that much of the current concern about human trafficking and its more general conflation with prostitution and other forms of sex work have hallmarks of moral panic. They further argue that this moral panic shares much in common with the &#x27;white slavery&#x27; panic of a century earlier, which in the US prompted passage of the 1910 &quot;Mann Act&quot;. Nick Davies argues that the following major factors contributed towards this effect. Since the collapse of Communism, Western Europe was flooded with sex workers from Eastern Europe, and the term &quot;sex trafficking&quot; came to mean any organized movement of sex workers, losing the connotation of force and coercion. This change of the definition entered, e.g., into the UK&#x27;s Sexual Offences Act 2003. Second, academic researchers on sex trade provided a range of estimates of the trafficked persons, including estimates based on various assumptions, up to the very pessimistic ones. The media picked the most alarmist numbers, which were uncritically used by politicians, who in their turn were quoted for further misleading information.

==== Terrorism and Islamic extremism (2001–present) ====
After the September 11 attacks in 2001, some scholars identified a rising fear of Muslims in the western world, which they described as a moral panic. This exaggeration of the threat posed by Islam served a political purpose, contributing to the concept of a global war on terror, including the war in Afghanistan and a war in Iraq.

Following the September 11 attacks, there was a dramatic increase in hate crimes against Muslims and Arabs in the United States, with rates peaking in 2001 and later surpassed in 2016.

==== African gangs moral panic (2007-2018) ====

A moral panic occurred in Australia between 2007 and 2018, centred on the supposed presence of Sudanese-Australian criminal gangs. The height of the panic coincided with the Victorian State election of 2018, and was strongly linked to members of the Australian Liberal Party and right-wing newspapers. The racialised nature of the panic showed great similarities to the &quot;Black muggers&quot; panic studied by Hall, but met with greater resistance from local &quot;experts&quot; such as senior police and politicians, limiting its effectiveness to a degree.

==== QAnon conspiracies (2020s) ====
QAnon, a late-2010s to early 2020s far-right conspiracy theory that began on 4chan and which alleged that a secret cabal of Jewish, Satan-worshipping, cannibalistic pedophiles is running a global child sex-trafficking ring, has been described as a moral panic and compared to the 1980s panic over satanic ritual abuse.

==== LGBT grooming conspiracy theory (2020s–present) ====

Since the early 2020s, members of the far-right and a growing number of mainstream conservatives, mostly in the United States, have falsely accused LGBT people, as well as their allies and progressives in general, of systematically using LGBT-positive education and campaigns for LGBT rights as a method of child grooming. These accusations and conspiracy theories are characterized by experts as baseless, homophobic and transphobic, and as examples of moral panic.

== Criticism of moral panic as an explanation ==
Paul Joosse has argued that while classic moral panic theory styled itself as being part of the &quot;sceptical revolution&quot; that sought to critique structural functionalism, it is actually very similar to Émile Durkheim&#x27;s depiction of how the collective conscience is strengthened through its reactions to deviance (in Cohen&#x27;s case, for example, &quot;right-thinkers&quot; use folk devils to strengthen societal orthodoxies). In his analysis of Donald Trump&#x27;s victory in the 2016 United States presidential election, Joosse reimagined moral panic in Weberian terms, showing how charismatic moral entrepreneurs can at once deride folk devils in the traditional sense while avoiding the conservative moral recapitulation that classic moral panic theory predicts. Another criticism is that of disproportionality: there is no way to measure what a proportionate reaction should be to a specific action.

Writing in 1995 about the moral panic that arose in the UK after a series of murders by juveniles, chiefly that of two-year-old James Bulger by two 10-year-old boys but also including that of 70-year-old Edna Phillips by two 17-year-old girls, the sociologist Colin Hay pointed out that the folk devil was ambiguous in such cases; the child perpetrators would normally be thought of as innocent.

In 1995, Angela McRobbie and Sarah Thornton argued &quot;that it is now time that every stage in the process of constructing a moral panic, as well as the social relations which support it, should be revised&quot;. Their argument is that mass media has changed since the concept of moral panic emerged so &quot;that &#x27;folk devils&#x27; are less marginalized than they once were&quot;, and that &quot;folk devils&quot; are not only castigated by mass media but supported and defended by it as well. They also suggest that the &quot;points of social control&quot; that moral panics used to rest on &quot;have undergone some degree of shift, if not transformation&quot;.

British criminologist Yvonne Jewkes (2004) has also raised issue with the term &quot;morality&quot;, how it is accepted unproblematically in the concept of &quot;moral panic&quot; and how most research into moral panics fails to approach the term critically but instead accepts it at face value. Jewkes goes on to argue that the thesis and the way it has been used fails to distinguish between crimes that quite rightly offend human morality, and thus elicit a justifiable reaction, and those that demonise minorities. The public are not sufficiently gullible to keep accepting the latter and consequently allow themselves to be manipulated by the media and the government.

Another British criminologist, Steve Hall (2012), goes a step further to suggest that the term &quot;moral panic&quot; is a fundamental category error. Hall argues that although some crimes are sensationalized by the media, in the general structure of the crime/control narrative the ability of the existing state and criminal justice system to protect the public is also overstated. Public concern is whipped up only for the purpose of being soothed, which produces not panic but the opposite, comfort and complacency.

Echoing another point Hall makes, sociologists Thompson and Williams (2013) argue that the concept of &quot;moral panic&quot; is not a rational response to the phenomenon of social reaction, but itself a product of the irrational middle-class fear of the imagined working-class &quot;mob&quot;. Using as an example a peaceful and lawful protest staged by local mothers against the re-housing of sex-offenders on their estate, Thompson and Williams argue that the sensationalist demonization of the protesters by moral panic theorists and the liberal press was just as irrational as the demonization of the sex offenders by the protesters and the tabloid press.

Many sociologists and criminologists (Ungar, Hier, Rohloff) have revised Cohen&#x27;s original framework. The revisions are compatible with the way in which Cohen theorizes panics in the third &quot;Introduction to Folk Devils and Moral Panics&quot;.

Masekela was known for his jazz compositions and for writing well-known anti-apartheid songs such as &quot;Soweto Blues&quot; and &quot;Bring Him Back Home&quot;. He also had a number-one US pop hit in 1968 with his version of &quot;Grazing in the Grass&quot;.

==Early life==
Hugh Ramapolo Masekela was born in the township of KwaGuqa in Witbank (now called Emalahleni), South Africa, to Thomas Selena Masekela, who was a health inspector and sculptor and his wife, Pauline Bowers Masekela, a social worker. His younger sister Barbara Masekela is a poet, educator and ANC activist. As a child, he began singing and playing piano and was largely raised by his grandmother, who ran an illegal bar for miners. At the age of 14, after seeing the 1950 film &quot;Young Man with a Horn&quot; (in which Kirk Douglas plays a character modelled on American jazz cornetist Bix Beiderbecke), Masekela took up playing the trumpet. His first trumpet was bought for him from a local music store by Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, the anti-apartheid chaplain at St. Peter&#x27;s Secondary School now known as St. Martin&#x27;s School (Rosettenville).

Huddleston asked the leader of the then Johannesburg &quot;Native&quot; Municipal Brass Band, Uncle Sauda, to teach Masekela the rudiments of trumpet playing. Masekela quickly mastered the instrument. Soon, some of his schoolmates also became interested in playing instruments, leading to the formation of the Huddleston Jazz Band, South Africa&#x27;s first youth orchestra. When Louis Armstrong heard of this band from his friend Huddleston he sent one of his own trumpets as a gift for Hugh. By 1956, after leading other ensembles, Masekela joined Alfred Herbert&#x27;s African Jazz Revue.

From 1954, Masekela played music that closely reflected his life experience. The agony, conflict, and exploitation faced by South Africa during the 1950s and 1960s inspired and influenced him to make music and also spread political change. He was an artist who in his music vividly portrayed the struggles and sorrows, as well as the joys and passions of his country. His music protested about apartheid, slavery, government; the hardships individuals were living. Masekela reached a large population that also felt oppressed due to the country&#x27;s situation.

Following a Manhattan Brothers tour of South Africa in 1958, Masekela joined the orchestra of the musical &quot;King Kong&quot;, written by Todd Matshikiza. &quot;King Kong&quot; was South Africa&#x27;s first blockbuster theatrical success, touring the country for a sold-out year with Miriam Makeba and the Manhattan Brothers&#x27; Nathan Mdledle in the lead. The musical later went to London&#x27;s West End for two years.

==Career==
At the end of 1959, Dollar Brand (later known as Abdullah Ibrahim), Kippie Moeketsi, Makhaya Ntshoko, Jonas Gwangwa, Johnny Gertze and Hugh formed the Jazz Epistles, the first African jazz group to record an LP. They performed to record-breaking audiences in Johannesburg and Cape Town through late 1959 to early 1960.

Following the 21 March 1960 Sharpeville massacre—where 69 protestors were shot dead in Sharpeville, and the South African government banned gatherings of ten or more people—and the increased brutality of the Apartheid state, Masekela left the country. He was helped by Trevor Huddleston and international friends such as Yehudi Menuhin and John Dankworth, who got him admitted into London&#x27;s Guildhall School of Music in 1960. During that period, Masekela visited the United States, where he was befriended by Harry Belafonte. After securing a scholarship back in London, Masekela moved to the United States to attend the Manhattan School of Music in New York, where he studied classical trumpet from 1960 to 1964. In 1964, Miriam Makeba and Masekela were married, divorcing two years later.

He had hits in the US with the pop jazz tunes &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot; (1967) and the number-one smash &quot;Grazing in the Grass&quot; (1968), which sold four million copies. He also appeared at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, and was subsequently featured in the film &quot;Monterey Pop&quot; by D. A. Pennebaker and mentioned in the song &quot;Monterey&quot; by Eric Burdon &amp; the Animals. In 1974, Masekela and friend Stewart Levine organised the Zaire 74 music festival in Kinshasa set around the Rumble in the Jungle boxing match.

He played primarily in jazz ensembles, with guest appearances on recordings by the Byrds (&quot;So You Want to Be a Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Star&quot; and &quot;Lady Friend&quot;) (the latter being denied by David Crosby) and Paul Simon (&quot;Further to Fly&quot;). In 1984, Masekela released the album &quot;Techno Bush&quot;; from that album, a single entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Lose It Baby&quot; peaked at number two for two weeks on the dance charts. In 1987, he had a hit single with &quot;Bring Him Back Home&quot;. The song became enormously popular, and turned into an unofficial anthem of the anti-apartheid movement and an anthem for the movement to free Nelson Mandela.

A renewed interest in his African roots led Masekela to collaborate with West and Central African musicians, and finally to reconnect with Southern African players when he set up with the help of Jive Records a mobile studio in Botswana, just over the South African border, from 1980 to 1984. Here he re-absorbed and re-used mbaqanga strains, a style he continued to use following his return to South Africa in the early 1990s.

In 1985 Masekela founded the Botswana International School of Music (BISM), which held its first workshop in Gaborone in that year. The event, still in existence, continues as the annual Botswana Music Camp, giving local musicians of all ages and from all backgrounds the opportunity to play and perform together. Masekela taught the jazz course at the first workshop, and performed at the final concert.

Also in the 1980s, Masekela toured with Paul Simon in support of Simon&#x27;s album &quot;Graceland&quot;, which featured other South African artists such as Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Miriam Makeba, Ray Phiri, and other elements of the band Kalahari, which was co-founded by guitarist Banjo Mosele and which backed Masekela in the 1980s. As well as recording with Kalahari, he also collaborated in the musical development for the Broadway play &quot;Sarafina!&quot;, which premiered in 1988.

In 2003, he was featured in the documentary film &quot;Amandla!: A Revolution in Four-Part Harmony&quot;. In 2004, he released his autobiography, &quot;Still Grazing: The Musical Journey of Hugh Masekela&quot;, co-authored with journalist D. Michael Cheers, which detailed Masekela&#x27;s struggles against apartheid in his homeland, as well as his personal struggles with alcoholism from the late 1970s to the 1990s. In this period, he migrated, in his personal recording career, to mbaqanga, jazz/funk, and the blending of South African sounds, through two albums he recorded with Herb Alpert, and solo recordings, &quot;Techno-Bush&quot; (recorded in his studio in Botswana), &quot;Tomorrow&quot; (featuring the anthem &quot;Bring Him Back Home&quot;), &quot;Uptownship&quot; (a lush-sounding ode to American R&amp;B), &quot;Beatin&#x27; Aroun de Bush&quot;, &quot;Sixty&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, and &quot;Revival&quot;. His song &quot;Soweto Blues&quot;, sung by his former wife, Miriam Makeba, is a blues/jazz piece that mourns the carnage of the Soweto riots in 1976. He also provided interpretations of songs composed by Jorge Ben, Antônio Carlos Jobim, Caiphus Semenya, Jonas Gwangwa, Dorothy Masuka, and Fela Kuti.

In 2006 Masekela was described by Michael A. Gomez, professor of history and Middle Eastern and Islamic studies at New York University as &quot;the father of African jazz.&quot;

In 2009, Masekela released the album &quot;Phola&quot; (meaning &quot;to get well, to heal&quot;), his second recording for 4 Quarters Entertainment/Times Square Records. It includes some songs he wrote in the 1980s but never completed, as well as a reinterpretation of &quot;The Joke of Life (Brinca de Vivre)&quot;, which he recorded in the mid-1980s. From October 2007, he was a board member of the Woyome Foundation for Africa.

In 2010, Masekela was featured, with his son Selema Masekela, in a series of videos on ESPN. The series, called &quot;Umlando – Through My Father&#x27;s Eyes&quot;, was aired in 10 parts during ESPN&#x27;s coverage of the FIFA World Cup in South Africa. The series focused on Hugh&#x27;s and Selema&#x27;s travels through South Africa. Hugh brought his son to the places he grew up. It was Selema&#x27;s first trip to his father&#x27;s homeland.

On 3 December 2013, Masekela guested with the Dave Matthews Band in Johannesburg, South Africa. He joined Rashawn Ross on trumpet for &quot;Proudest Monkey&quot; and &quot;Grazing in the Grass&quot;.

In 2016, at Emperors Palace, Johannesburg, Masekela and Abdullah Ibrahim performed together for the first time in 60 years, reuniting the Jazz Epistles in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the historic 16 June 1976 youth demonstrations.

==Social initiatives==
Masekela was involved in several social initiatives, and served as a director on the board of the Lunchbox Fund, a non-profit organization that provides a daily meal to students of township schools in Soweto.

==Personal life and death==
From 1964 to 1966 Masekela was married to singer and activist Miriam Makeba. He had subsequent marriages to Chris Calloway (daughter of Cab Calloway), Jabu Mbatha, and Elinam Cofie. During the last few years of his life, he lived with the dancer Nomsa Manaka. He was the father of American television host Selema Masekela. Poet, educator, and activist Barbara Masekela is his younger sister.

Masekela died in Johannesburg on the early morning of 23 January 2018 from prostate cancer, aged 78.

==Awards and honours==
Masekela was honoured with a Google Doodle on 4 April 2019, which would have been his 80th birthday. The Doodle depicts Masekela, dressed in colourful shirt, playing a flugelhorn in front of a banner.

===Grammy history===
Masekela was nominated for a Grammy Award three times, including a nomination for Best World Music Album for his 2012 album &quot;Jabulani&quot;, one for Best Musical Cast Show Album for &quot;Sarafina! The Music Of Liberation&quot; (1989) and one for Best Contemporary Pop Performance for the song &quot;Grazing in the Grass&quot; (1968).

<text>Harriet Elisabeth Beecher Stowe (; June 14, 1811 – July 1, 1896) was an American author and abolitionist. She came from the religious Beecher family and wrote the popular novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (1852), which depicts the harsh conditions experienced by enslaved African Americans. The book reached an audience of millions as a novel and play, and became influential in the United States and in Great Britain, energizing anti-slavery forces in the American North, while provoking widespread anger in the South. Stowe wrote 30 books, including novels, three travel memoirs, and collections of articles and letters. She was influential both for her writings as well as for her public stances and debates on social issues of the day.

==Life and work==
Harriet Elisabeth Beecher was born in Litchfield, Connecticut, on June 14, 1811. She was the sixth of 11 children born to outspoken Calvinist preacher Lyman Beecher. Her mother was his first wife, Roxana (Foote), a deeply religious woman who died when Stowe was only five years old. Roxana&#x27;s maternal grandfather was General Andrew Ward of the Revolutionary War. Harriet&#x27;s siblings included a sister, Catharine Beecher, who became an educator and author, as well as brothers who became ministers, including Henry Ward Beecher, who became a famous preacher and abolitionist, Charles Beecher, and Edward Beecher.

Harriet enrolled in the Hartford Female Seminary run by her older sister Catharine, where she received a traditional academic education – rather uncommon for women at the time – with a focus in the classics, languages, and mathematics. Among her classmates was Sarah P. Willis, who later wrote under the pseudonym Fanny Fern.

In 1832, at the age of 21, Harriet Beecher moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, to join her father, who had become the president of Lane Theological Seminary. There, she also joined the Semi-Colon Club, a literary salon and social club whose members included the Beecher sisters, Caroline Lee Hentz, Salmon P. Chase (future governor of Ohio and United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Abraham Lincoln), Emily Blackwell, and others. Cincinnati&#x27;s trade and shipping business on the Ohio River was booming, drawing numerous migrants from different parts of the country, including many escaped slaves, bounty hunters seeking them, and Irish immigrants who worked on the state&#x27;s canals and railroads. In 1829, the ethnic Irish attacked blacks, wrecking areas of the city, trying to push out these competitors for jobs. Beecher met a number of African Americans who had suffered in those attacks, and their experience contributed to her later writing about slavery. Riots took place again in 1836 and 1841, driven also by native-born anti-abolitionists.

Harriet was also influenced by the Lane Debates on Slavery. The biggest event ever to take place at Lane, it was the series of debates held on 18 days in February 1834, between colonization and abolition defenders, decisively won by Theodore Weld and other abolitionists. Elisabeth attended most of the debates. Her father and the trustees, afraid of more violence from anti-abolitionist whites, prohibited any further discussions of the topic. The result was a mass exodus of the Lane students, together with a supportive trustee and a professor, who moved as a group to the new Oberlin Collegiate Institute after its trustees agreed, by a close and acrimonious vote, to accept students regardless of &quot;race&quot;, and to allow discussions of any topic.

It was in the literary club at Lane that she met Rev. Calvin Ellis Stowe, a widower who was a professor of Biblical Literature at the seminary. The two married at the Seminary on January 6, 1836. The Stowes had seven children, including twin daughters.

===&quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; and Civil War===
The Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, prohibiting assistance to fugitives and strengthening sanctions even in free states. At the time, Stowe had moved with her family to Brunswick, Maine, where her husband was now teaching at Bowdoin College. Their home near the campus is now protected as a National Historic Landmark. The Stowes were ardent critics of slavery and supported the Underground Railroad, temporarily housing several fugitive slaves in their home. One fugitive from slavery, John Andrew Jackson, wrote of hiding with Stowe in her house in Brunswick as he fled to Canada in his narrative titled &quot;The Experience of a Slave in South Carolina&quot; (London: Passmore &amp; Albaster, 1862).

Stowe claimed to have had a vision of a dying slave during a communion service at Brunswick&#x27;s First Parish Church, which inspired her to write his story. What also likely allowed her to empathize with slaves was the loss of her eighteen-month-old son, Samuel Charles Stowe. She noted, &quot;Having experienced losing someone so close to me, I can sympathize with all the poor, powerless slaves at the unjust auctions. You will always be in my heart Samuel Charles Stowe.&quot; On March 9, 1850, Stowe wrote to Gamaliel Bailey, editor of the weekly anti-slavery journal &quot;The National Era&quot;, that she planned to write a story about the problem of slavery: &quot;I feel now that the time is come when even a woman or a child who can speak a word for freedom and humanity is bound to speak ... I hope every woman who can write will not be silent.&quot;

Shortly after in June 1851, when she was 40, the first installment of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; was published in serial form in the newspaper &quot;The National Era&quot;. She originally used the subtitle &quot;The Man That Was a Thing&quot;, but it was soon changed to &quot;Life Among the Lowly&quot;. Installments were published weekly from June 5, 1851, to April 1, 1852. For the newspaper serialization of her novel, Stowe was paid $400. &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; was published in book form on March 20, 1852, by John P. Jewett with an initial print run of 5,000 copies. Each of its two volumes included three illustrations and a title-page designed by Hammatt Billings. In less than a year, the book sold an unprecedented 300,000 copies. By December, as sales began to wane, Jewett issued an inexpensive edition at cents each to stimulate sales. Sales abroad, as in Britain where the book was a great success, earned Stowe nothing as there was no international copyright agreement in place during that era. In 1853, Stowe undertook a lecture tour of Britain and, to make up the royalties that she could not receive there, the Glasgow New Association for the Abolition of Slavery set up Uncle Tom&#x27;s Offering.

According to Daniel R. Vollaro, the goal of the book was to educate Northerners on the realistic horrors of the things that were happening in the South. The other purpose was to try to make people in the South feel more empathetic towards the people they were forcing into slavery. The book&#x27;s emotional portrayal of the effects of slavery on individuals captured the nation&#x27;s attention. Stowe showed that slavery touched all of society, beyond the people directly involved as masters, traders and slaves. Her novel added to the debate about abolition and slavery, and aroused opposition in the South. In the South, Stowe was depicted as out of touch, arrogant, and guilty of slander. Within a year, 300 babies in Boston alone were named Eva (one of the book&#x27;s characters), and a play based on the book opened in New York in November. Southerners quickly responded with numerous works of what are now called anti-Tom novels, seeking to portray Southern society and slavery in more positive terms. Many of these were bestsellers, although none matched the popularity of Stowe&#x27;s work, which set publishing records.

After the start of the Civil War, Stowe traveled to the capital, Washington, D.C., where she met President Abraham Lincoln on November 25, 1862. Stowe&#x27;s daughter, Hattie, reported, &quot;It was a very droll time that we had at the White house I assure you ... I will only say now that it was all very funny – and we were ready to explode with laughter all the while.&quot; What Lincoln said is a minor mystery. Her son later reported that Lincoln greeted her by saying, &quot;so you are the little woman who wrote the book that started this great war&quot;, but this story has been found to be apocryphal. Her own accounts are vague, including the letter reporting the meeting to her husband: &quot;I had a real funny interview with the President.&quot;

===Later years===
Stowe purchased property near Jacksonville, Florida. In response to a newspaper article in 1873, she wrote, &quot;I came to Florida the year after the war and held property in Duval County ever since. In all this time I have not received even an incivility from any native Floridian.&quot;

Stowe is controversial for her support of Elizabeth Campbell, Duchess of Argyll, whose grandfather had been a primary enforcer of the Highland Clearances, the transformation of the remote Highlands of Scotland from a militia-based society to an agricultural one that supported far fewer people. The newly homeless moved to Canada, where very bitter accounts appeared. It was Stowe&#x27;s assignment to refute them using evidence the Duchess provided, in Letter XVII Volume 1 of her travel memoir &quot;Sunny Memories of Foreign Lands&quot;. Stowe was criticized for her seeming defense of the clearances.

In 1868, Stowe became one of the first editors of &quot;Hearth and Home&quot; magazine, one of several new publications appealing to women; she departed after a year. Stowe campaigned for the expansion of married women&#x27;s rights, arguing in 1869 that:

In the 1870s, Stowe&#x27;s brother Henry Ward Beecher was accused of adultery, and became the subject of a national scandal. Unable to bear the public attacks on her brother, Stowe again fled to Florida but asked family members to send her newspaper reports. Through the affair, she remained loyal to her brother and believed he was innocent.

After her return to Connecticut, Mrs. Stowe was among the founders of the Hartford Art School, which later became part of the University of Hartford.

Following the death of her husband, Calvin Stowe, in 1886, Harriet started rapidly to decline in health. By 1888, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that as a result of dementia the 77-year-old Stowe started writing &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; over again. She imagined that she was engaged in the original composition, and for several hours every day she industriously used pen and paper, inscribing passages of the book almost exactly word for word. This was done unconsciously from memory, the author imagining that she composed the matter as she went along. To her diseased mind the story was brand new, and she frequently exhausted herself with labor that she regarded as freshly created.

Mark Twain, a neighbor of Stowe&#x27;s in Hartford, recalled her last years in the following passage of his autobiography:
Her mind had decayed, and she was a pathetic figure. She wandered about all the day long in the care of a muscular Irish woman. Among the colonists of our neighborhood the doors always stood open in pleasant weather. Mrs. Stowe entered them at her own free will, and as she was always softly slippered and generally full of animal spirits, she was able to deal in surprises, and she liked to do it. She would slip up behind a person who was deep in dreams and musings and fetch a war whoop that would jump that person out of his clothes. And she had other moods. Sometimes we would hear gentle music in the drawing-room and would find her there at the piano singing ancient and melancholy songs with infinitely touching effect.

Modern researchers now speculate that at the end of her life she was suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.
Harriet Beecher Stowe died on July 1, 1896, in Hartford, Connecticut, 17 days after her 85th birthday.
She is buried in the historic cemetery at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, along with her husband and their son Henry Ellis.

==Legacy==
===Landmarks===
Multiple landmarks are dedicated to the memory of Harriet Beecher Stowe, and are located in several states including Ohio, Florida, Maine and Connecticut. The locations of these landmarks represent various periods of her life such as her father&#x27;s house where she grew up and where she wrote her most famous work.

The Harriet Beecher Stowe House in Cincinnati, Ohio, is the former home of her father Lyman Beecher on the former campus of the Lane Seminary. Her father was a preacher who was greatly affected by the pro-slavery Cincinnati Riots of 1836. Harriet Beecher Stowe lived here until her marriage. It is open to the public and operated as a historical and cultural site, focusing on Harriet Beecher Stowe, the Lane Seminary and the Underground Railroad. The site also presents African-American history.

In the 1870s and 1880s, Stowe and her family wintered in Mandarin, Florida, now a neighborhood of modern consolidated Jacksonville, on the St. Johns River. Stowe wrote &quot;Palmetto Leaves&quot; while living in Mandarin, arguably an eloquent piece of promotional literature directed at Florida&#x27;s potential Northern investors at the time. The book was published in 1873 and describes Northeast Florida and its residents. In 1874, Stowe was honored by the governor of Florida as one of several northerners who had helped Florida&#x27;s growth after the war. In addition to her writings inspiring tourists and settlers to the area, she helped establish a church and a school, and she helped promote oranges as a major state crop through her own orchards. The school she helped establish in 1870 was an integrated school in Mandarin for children and adults. This predated the national movement toward integration by more than a half century. The marker commemorating the Stowe family is located across the street from the former site of their cottage. It is on the property of the Community Club, at the site of a church where Stowe&#x27;s husband once served as a minister. The Church of our Saviour is an Episcopal Church founded in 1880 by a group of people who had gathered for Bible readings with Professor Calvin E. Stowe and his famous wife. The house was constructed in 1883 which contained the &quot;Stowe Memorial stained glass window&quot;, created by Louis Comfort Tiffany.

The Harriet Beecher Stowe House in Brunswick, Maine, is where Stowe lived when she wrote &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin.&quot; Her husband was teaching theology at nearby Bowdoin College, and she regularly invited students from the college and friends to read and discuss the chapters before publication. Future Civil War general, and later Governor, Joshua Chamberlain was then a student at the college and later described the setting. &quot;On these occasions,&quot; Chamberlain noted, &quot;a chosen circle of friends, mostly young, were favored with the freedom of her house, the rallying point being, however, the reading before publication, of the successive chapters of her &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, and the frank discussion of them.&quot; In 2001, Bowdoin College purchased the house, together with a newer attached building, and was able to raise the substantial funds necessary to restore the house. It is now open to the public.

The Harriet Beecher Stowe House in Hartford, Connecticut, is the house where Stowe lived for the last 23 years of her life. It was next door to the house of fellow author Mark Twain. In this cottage-style house, there are many of Beecher Stowe&#x27;s original items and items from the time period. In the research library, which is open to the public, there are numerous letters and documents from the Beecher family. The house is open to the public and offers house tours on the hour.

In 1833, during Stowe&#x27;s time in Cincinnati, the city was afflicted with a serious cholera epidemic. To avoid illness, Stowe made a visit to Washington, Kentucky, a major community of the era just south of Maysville. She stayed with the Marshall Key family, one of whose daughters was a student at Lane Seminary. It is recorded that Mr. Key took her to see a slave auction, as they were frequently held in Maysville. Scholars believe she was strongly moved by the experience. The Marshall Key home still stands in Washington. Key was a prominent Kentuckian; his visitors also included Henry Clay and Daniel Webster.

The Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin Historic Site is part of the restored Dawn Settlement at Dresden, Ontario, which is 20 miles east of Algonac, Michigan. The community for freed slaves founded by the Rev. Josiah Henson and other abolitionists in the 1830s has been restored. There&#x27;s also a museum. Henson and the Dawn Settlement provided Stowe with the inspiration for &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;.

<doc id="164101" wikidata="Q624240" url="?curid=164101" title="Arabic name">
<text>Arabic names have historically been based on a long naming system. Many people from Arabic-speaking and also non-Arab Muslim countries have not had given, middle, and family names but rather a chain of names. This system remains in use throughout the Arab and Muslim worlds.

==Name structure==
The &quot; () is the given name, first name, or personal name; e.g. &quot;Ahmad&quot; or &quot;Fatima&quot;. Most Arabic names have meaning as ordinary adjectives and nouns, and are often aspirational of character. For example, &quot;Muhammad&quot; means &#x27;Praiseworthy&#x27; and &quot;Ali&quot; means &#x27;Exalted&#x27; or &#x27;High&#x27;.

The syntactic context will generally differentiate the name from the noun or adjective. However Arabic newspapers will occasionally place names in brackets, or quotation marks, to avoid confusion.

In fact, the name &quot;Muhammad&quot; is so popular throughout parts of Africa, Arabia, the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia, that it is often represented by the abbreviation &quot;Md.&quot;, &quot;Mohd.&quot;, &quot;Muhd.&quot;, or just &quot;M.&quot;. In India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, due to its almost ubiquitous use as a first name, a person will often be referred to by their second name:
* Md. Dinar Ibn Raihan
* Mohd. Umair Tanvir
* Md. Osman

The &quot;nasab&quot; () is a patronymic or matronymic, or a series thereof. It indicates the person&#x27;s heritage by the word &quot;ibn&quot; ( &quot;son of&quot;, colloquially &quot;bin&quot;) or &quot;ibnat&quot; (&quot;daughter of&quot;, also &quot;bint&quot;, abbreviated &quot;bte.&quot;). In the 1995 book &quot;Name Studies&quot; (De Gruyter), wrote that, although the nasab was still common contemporarily, &quot;ibn&quot; and &quot;bint&quot; were omitted &quot;in almost all Arab countries&quot;.

Ibn Khaldun () means &quot;son of Khaldun&quot;. Khaldun is the father&#x27;s personal name or, in this particular case, the name of a remote male ancestor.

ʿAmmār ibn Sumayya means &quot;ʿAmmār son of Sumayya&quot;. Sumayya is the personal name of ʿAmmār&#x27;s mother, the same person can also be identified by his father&#x27;s personal name &quot;ʿAmmār ibn Yasir&quot;. In later Islamic periods the nasab was an important tool in determining a child&#x27;s father by means of describing paternity in a social (i.e. to whom was the mother legally married during the conception of the child), not a biological sense, because the father&#x27;s biological identity can be grounds for speculation. In early Islamic contexts this function is not yet well established. This stems from a legal principle introduced by Islam regarding the legal status of children (they can only arise from marriage) and changes to waiting periods relating to divorce to establish an undisputed legal father for any child. This function only developing with Islam means that one can find many Companions of the Prophet bearing a maternal nasab, as the naming conventions reflected in their names still stem from pre-Islamic attitudes and beliefs.

Several &quot;nasab&quot; names can follow in a chain to trace a person&#x27;s ancestry backwards in time, as was important in the tribal society of medieval Arabs, both for purposes of identification and for socio-political interactions. Today, however, &quot;ibn&quot; or &quot;bint&quot; is no longer used (unless it is the official naming style in a country, region, etc.: Adnen bin Abdallah). The plural is &#x27; for males and &#x27; for females. However, &#x27; or &#x27; is tribal and encompasses both sexes.

The &quot;laqab&quot; (), pl. &quot;alqāb&quot; (), can be translated to English as agnomen; cognomen; nickname; title, honorific; last name, surname, family name. The &quot;laqab&quot; could be purely descriptive of a person, express admiration or be insulting and derogatory.

An example is the name of the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid, which uses the definite article &quot;al-&quot;. &#x27; is the Arabic version of the name &quot;Aaron&quot; and &#x27; means &quot;the Rightly-Guided&quot;. 

The &quot;laqab&quot; was used as a regnal title by the caliphs. This was most prominent in Abbasid times, for example al-Manṣūr bi’llāh. 

Another common form of is that of compounds ending with (), (&#x27;of the State&#x27;), (&#x27;of the Kingdom&#x27;), or (&#x27;of Islam&#x27;). Examples include Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn, Shams al-Dīn, Nūr al-Dīn, Izz al-Din, Nāṣir al-Dawla, Niẓām al-Mulk, Sayf al-Islām.

In ancient Arab societies, use of a &quot;laqab&quot; was common, but today is restricted to the surname, or family name, of birth.

The () surname could be an everyday name, but is mostly the name of the ancestral tribe, clan, family, profession, town, city, country, or any other term used to show relevance. It follows a family through several generations. A demonym example is , meaning that the person is originally from Aleppo or a descendant of people from Aleppo. For a profession example, meaning &quot;the tailor&quot;.

The &quot;laqab&quot; and &quot;nisbah&quot; are similar in use, but they could be used simultaneously. For example: Sayf Al-Dīn Al-Halabi.

A &quot;kunya&quot; (, &quot;kunyah&quot;) is a teknonym in Arabic names. It is a component of an Arabic name, a type of epithet, in theory referring to the bearer&#x27;s first-born son or daughter. By extension, it may also have hypothetical or metaphorical references, e.g. in a &quot;nom de guerre&quot; or a nickname, without literally referring to a son or a daughter. For example, Sabri Khalil al-Banna was known as Abu Nidal, &quot;father of struggle&quot;.

Use of a kunya implies a familiar but respectful setting.

A kunya is expressed by the use of &quot;abū&quot; (father) or &quot;umm&quot; (mother) in a genitive construction, i.e. &quot;father of&quot; or &quot;mother of&quot; as an honorific in place of or alongside given names in the Arab world.

A kunya may also be a nickname expressing the attachment of an individual to a certain thing, as in Abu Bakr, &quot;father of the camel foal&quot;, given because of this person&#x27;s kindness towards camels.

==Common naming practices==
===Arab Muslim===
A common name-form among Arab Muslims is the prefix &#x27; (&quot;Worshipper&quot;, &#x27;) combined with the word for God (Allah), &quot;&quot; ( &quot;Worshipper of God&quot;), or with one of the epithets of God.

As a mark of deference, &quot;&quot; is usually not conjoined with the prophet&#x27;s names. Nonetheless, such names are accepted in some areas. Its use is not exclusive to Muslims and throughout all Arab countries, the name &quot;Abdel-Massih&quot;, &quot;Servant of Christ&quot;, is a common Christian last name.

Converts to Islam may often continue using the native non-Arabic non-Islamic names that are without any polytheistic connotation, or association.

===Arab Christian===
Generally, Arab Christians have names indistinguishable from Muslims, with the exception of some explicitly Islamic names, e.g. &quot;Muhammad&quot;. Some common Christian names are:
* Arabic versions of Christian names (e.g. saints&#x27; names: &quot;&quot; for &quot;Peter&quot;, &quot;Boulos &quot; for &quot;Paul&quot;).
* Names of Greek, Armenian, and Aramaic origin, which are also used by ethnically &quot;non-Arab&quot; Christians such as Armenians, Assyrians, Copts and Syriac Christians.
* Use of European names, especially French, and English. This is a recent convention for Christian Arabs, which mainly started with the British and French mandates in the Levant. Examples include George Habash, Michel Aflaq, and Charles Helou.
* Names in honor of Jesus Christ:
: &#x27; ( ) / &#x27; () (&quot;Servant of Jesus&quot;)
: &#x27; (masc.) / &#x27; (fem.) (&quot;Servant of the Messiah&quot;)
: Derivations of &#x27; (&quot;Messiah&quot;): &#x27; (&quot;Most Anointed&quot;), &#x27; (&quot;More Anointed&quot;), &#x27; &quot;Anointed&quot; and &#x27; &quot;Infant Christ&quot;. The root, &#x27;, means &quot;to anoint&quot; (as in &quot;masah&quot;) and is cognate to the Hebrew &quot;&quot;.

==Dynastic or family name==
Some people, especially in the Arabian Peninsula, when descendant of a famous ancestor, start their last name with &quot;Āl&quot; &quot;family, clan&quot; (), like the House of Saud &quot;Āl Suʻūd&quot; or Al ash-Sheikh (&quot;family of the sheikh&quot;). &quot;Āl&quot; is distinct from the definite article (). If a reliably-sourced version of the Arabic spelling includes (as a separate graphic word), then this is a case of the definite article, so (capitalised and followed by a space, not a hyphen) should be used. &quot;Ahl&quot;, which has a similar meaning, is sometimes used and should be used if the Arabic spelling is .

Dynasty membership alone does necessarily imply that the dynastic is used – e.g. Bashar al-Assad.
===Example===

Muḥammad ibn Salmān ibn Amīn al-Fārisī

:&quot;Ism&quot; – Muḥammad (proper name, &quot;praised&quot;)
:&quot;Nasab&quot; – Salmān (father&#x27;s name, lit. &quot;secure&quot;)
:&quot;Nasab&quot; – Amīn (grandfather&#x27;s name, &quot;trustworthy&quot;)
:&quot;Nisbah&quot; – al-Fārisī (&quot;the Persian&quot;).

&quot;Muḥammad, son of Salmān, son of Amīn, the Persian&quot;

This person would simply be referred to as &quot;Muḥammad&quot; or by his kunya, which relates him to his first-born son, e.g. &quot;Abū Karīm&quot; &quot;father of Karīm&quot;. To signify respect or to specify which Muḥammad one is speaking about, the name could be lengthened to the extent necessary or desired.

== Common mistakes ==
Non-Arabic speakers often make these mistakes:
* Separating &quot;the X of Y&quot; word combinations (see iḍāfah):
** With &quot;Abdul&quot;: Arabic names may be written &quot;Abdul (something)&quot;, but &quot;Abdul&quot; means &quot;servant of the&quot; or &quot;follower of the&quot; and is not, by itself, a name. Thus for example, to address Abdul-Rahman bin Omar al-Ahmad by his given name, one says &quot;Abdul-Rahman&quot;, not merely &quot;Abdul&quot;. If he introduces himself as &quot;Abdul-Rahman&quot; (which means &quot;the servant of the Merciful&quot;), one does not say &quot;Mr. Rahman&quot; (as &quot;Rahman&quot; is not a family name but part of his theophoric personal name); instead it would be Mr. al-Ahmad, the latter being the family name. Therefore, it is better to write &quot;Abdul Rahman&quot; as &quot;abdu r-rahmān&quot; and &quot;abdul ghafār&quot; as &quot;abdu l-ghafār&quot; .
** People not familiar with Arabic sandhi in &quot;iḍāfah&quot;: &quot;Habībullāh&quot; = &quot;beloved (&quot;Habīb&quot;) of God (&quot;Allāh&quot;)&quot;; here a person may in error report the man&#x27;s name as &quot;forename &quot;Habib&quot;, surname &quot;Ullah&quot;&quot;. Likewise, people may confuse a name such as Jalālu-d-dīn (&quot;The majesty of the religion&quot;) as being &quot;Jalal Uddin&quot;, or &quot;Mr. Uddin&quot;, when &quot;Uddin&quot; is not a surname, but the second half of a two-word name (the desinence &quot;-u&quot; of the construct state nominative, plus the article, appearing as &quot;-d-&quot;, plus the genitive &quot;dīn[i]&quot;). To add to the confusion, some immigrants to Western countries have adopted Uddin as a surname, although it is grammatically incorrect in Arabic outside the context of the associated &quot;first name&quot;. Even Indian Muslims commit the same error. If a person&#x27;s name is Abd-ul-Rahim (&quot;servant of the Merciful&quot;), others may call him Mr. Abdul (&quot;servant of the&quot;) which would sound quite odd to a native speaker of Arabic.
* Not distinguishing &#x27; from &#x27;: Some Muslim names include the Arabic word &#x27; ( &quot;nobility&quot;). Here, ⟨ʻ⟩ represents the &quot;ayin&quot;, a voiced pharyngeal fricative, ⟨ʾ⟩ represents the hamza, a glottal stop, and ⟨l⟩ is spelled and pronounced at ordinary length, /l/. In &#x27;, the &quot;l&quot; is written twice (⟨ll⟩) and pronounced twice as long (a geminate), as /l/ or /ll/. In Arabic pronunciation, &#x27; and &#x27; are clearly different. But Europeans, Iranians, and Indians may not pronounce some Arabic sounds as a native Arabic speaker would, and thus tend to pronounce them identically. For example, the name &#x27; (Aladdin, &quot;the Nobility of the Faith&quot;) is sometimes misspelled as &#x27; by Europeans and Indians. There is another name &quot;&quot; (&quot;Aliullah&quot;, &quot;the Nobility of God&quot;), which uses both distinctly. Therefore, the name &quot;علاء&quot; must be written in Latin in the form of &quot;Halāʾ &quot; or &quot;Halaa&#x27;e&quot; to differentiate it between “Allāh” the name of God in Arabic , and also the female name آلاء “Ālāʾ ” (Alaa&#x27;e) Which means &quot;blessings&quot; (God&#x27;s blessings).
* Taking &#x27; or &#x27; for a middle name: As stated above, these words indicate the order of the family chain. English-speakers often confuse them with middle names, especially when they are written as &quot;Ben&quot;, as it is the case in some countries. For example, Sami Ben Ahmed would be mistakenly addressed as Mr. Ben Ahmed. To correctly address the person, one should use Mr. Sami or Mr. Sami Ben Ahmed.
* Grammar: As between all languages, there are differences between Arabic grammar and the grammar of other languages. Arabic forms noun compounds in the opposite order from Indo-Iranian languages, for example. During the war in Afghanistan in 2002, a BBC team found in Kabul an internally displaced person whose name they stated as &quot;Allah Muhammad&quot;. This may be a misspelling for &quot;&quot;, for if not, by the rules of Arabic grammar, this name means &quot;the Allah who belongs to Muhammad&quot;, which, assuming the person is an Arabic speaking Muslim would be unacceptable religiously. However, by the rules of Iranian languages and most languages of India, this name does mean &quot;Muhammad who belongs to Allah&quot;, being the equivalent of the Arabic &quot;Muhammadullah&quot;. Most Afghans speak Iranian languages. Such Perso-Arab or Indo-Arab multilingual compound names are not uncommon in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Pakistan and Tajikistan. There is, for example, the Punjabi name &quot;Allah-Ditta&quot; which joins the Arabic &quot;Allah&quot; with the Punjabi &quot;Ditta&quot; &quot;given&quot;.

==Arab family naming convention==
Conventionally, in Arab culture, as in many parts of the world, a person&#x27;s ancestry and family name are very important. An example is explained below.

Assume a man is called &quot;Saleh ibn Tariq ibn Khalid al-Fulan&quot;.
* &quot;Saleh&quot; is his personal name, and the one that his family and friends would call him by.
* &quot;ibn&quot; and &quot;bin&quot; translates as &quot;son of&quot;, so &quot;Tariq&quot; is Saleh&#x27;s father&#x27;s name.
* &quot;ibn Khalid&quot; means that Tariq is the son of Khalid, making Khalid the paternal grandfather of Saleh.
* &quot;al-Fulan&quot; would be Saleh&#x27;s family name.
Hence, &quot;Saleh ibn Tariq ibn Khalid al-Fulan&quot; translates as &quot;Saleh, son of Tariq, son of Khalid; who is of the family of al-Fulan.&quot;

The Arabic for &quot;daughter of&quot; is &quot;bint.&quot; A woman with the name &quot;Fatimah bint Abdullah ibn Omar al-Rashid&quot; translates as &quot;Fatimah, daughter of Abdullah, son of Omar; who is of the family al-Rashid.&quot;

In this case, ibn and bint are included in the official naming. Most Arab countries today, however, do not use &#x27;ibn&#x27; and &#x27;bint&#x27; in their naming system. If Saleh were an Egyptian, he would be called &quot;Saleh Tariq Khalid al-Fulan&quot; and Fatimah would be &quot;Fatimah Abdullah Omar al-Rashid.&quot;

If Saleh marries a wife (who would keep her own maiden, family, and surnames), their children will take Saleh&#x27;s family name. Therefore, their son Mohammed would be called &quot;Mohammed ibn Saleh ibn Tariq al-Fulan&quot;, not &quot;Mohammed ibn Saleh ibn Tariq ibn Khalid al-Fulan&quot; (too long). 

However, not all Arab countries use the name in its full length, but conventionally use two- and three-word names, and sometimes four-word names in official or legal matters. Thus the first name is the personal name, the middle name is the father&#x27;s name and the last name is the father&#x27;s family name.

==Biblical names and their Arabic equivalent==
The Arabic names listed below are used in the Arab world with correspondent Hebrew, English, Syriac and Greek equivalents in many cases. Most are derived from Syriac transliterations of the Hebrew Bible.

* The popular romanization of the Arabized and Hebrew names are written first, then the standardized romanization are written in oblique. Arabized names may have variants.
* If a literal Arabic translation of a name exists, it will be placed after the final standardized romanization. 
* If an Arabic correlation is ambiguous, &quot;(?)&quot; will be placed following the name in question.
*: * Yasu&#x27; is the Arab Christian name, while ʿĪsā is the Muslim version of the name, as used in the Qur&#x27;an. There is debate as to which is the better rendition of the Aramaic Ishuʿ, because both names are of late origin.
*: ** Yuhanna is the Arab Christian name of John, while Yahya is the Muslim version of the name, as used in the Qur&#x27;an. They have completely different triconsonantal roots: &quot;Ḥ-N-N&quot; (&quot;grace&quot;) vs &quot;Ḥ-Y-Y&quot; (&quot;Life&quot;). Specifically, Youhanna may be the Biblical John the Baptist or the apostle. Yahya refers specifically to John the Baptist.
* &quot;El&quot;, the Hebrew word for strength/might or deity, is usually represented as &quot;īl&quot; in Arabic, although it carries no meaning in classical and modern Arabic. The only exception is its usage in the Iraqi Arabic.

==Arabic names in English==
Often Arabic names can be spelled multiple ways in English, and sometimes a person&#x27;s name may be treated inconsistently.

==Indexing==
According to the &quot;Chicago Manual of Style&quot;, Arabic names are indexed by their surnames. Names may be alphabetized under &quot;Abu&quot;, &quot;Abd&quot; and &quot;ibn&quot;, while names are not alphabetized under &quot;al-&quot; and &quot;el-&quot; and are instead alphabetized under the following element.

<doc id="164103" wikidata="Q2613233" url="?curid=164103" title="Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act">
<text>The Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA), also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, () is an act of the 106th United States Congress (1999–2001). It repealed part of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, removing barriers in the market among banking companies, securities companies, and insurance companies that prohibited any one institution from acting as any combination of an investment bank, a commercial bank, and an insurance company. With the passage of the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, commercial banks, investment banks, securities firms, and insurance companies were allowed to consolidate. Furthermore, it failed to give to the SEC or any other financial regulatory agency the authority to regulate large investment bank holding companies. The legislation was signed into law by President Bill Clinton.

A year before the law was passed, Citicorp, a commercial bank holding company, merged with the insurance company Travelers Group in 1998 to form the conglomerate Citigroup, a corporation combining banking, securities and insurance services under a house of brands that included Citibank, Smith Barney, Primerica, and Travelers. Because this merger was a violation of the Glass–Steagall Act and the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, the Federal Reserve gave Citigroup a temporary waiver in September 1998. Less than a year later, GLBA was passed to legalize these types of mergers on a permanent basis. The law also repealed Glass–Steagall&#x27;s conflict of interest prohibitions &quot;against simultaneous service by any officer, director, or employee of a securities firm as an officer, director, or employee of any member bank.&quot;

==Legislative history==
The banking industry had been seeking the repeal of the 1933 Glass–Steagall Act since the 1980s, if not earlier. In 1987 the Congressional Research Service prepared a report that explored the cases for and against preserving the Glass–Steagall Act.

Respective versions of the Financial Services Act were introduced in the U.S. Senate by Phil Gramm (Republican of Texas) and in the U.S. House of Representatives by Jim Leach (R-Iowa). The third lawmaker associated with the bill was Rep. Thomas J. Bliley, Jr. (R-Virginia), Chairman of the House Commerce Committee from 1995 to 2001.

During debate in the House of Representatives, Rep. John Dingell (Democrat of Michigan) argued that the bill would result in banks becoming &quot;too big to fail.&quot; Dingell further argued that this would necessarily result in a bailout by the Federal Government.
The House passed its version of the &quot;Financial Services Act of 1999&quot; on July 1, 1999, by a bipartisan vote of 343–86 (Republicans 205–16; Democrats 138–69; Independent 0–1), two months after the Senate had already passed its version of the bill on May 6 by a much narrower 54–44 vote along basically partisan lines (53 Republicans and 1 Democrat in favor; 44 Democrats opposed).

When the two chambers could not agree on a joint version of the bill, the House voted on July 30 by a vote of 241–132 (R 58–131; D 182–1; Ind. 1–0) to instruct its negotiators to work for a law which ensured that consumers enjoyed medical and financial privacy as well as &quot;robust competition and equal and non-discriminatory access to financial services and economic opportunities in their communities&quot; (i.e., protection against exclusionary redlining).

The bill then moved to a joint conference committee to work out the differences between the Senate and House versions. Democrats agreed to support the bill after Republicans agreed to strengthen provisions of the anti-redlining Community Reinvestment Act and address certain privacy concerns; the conference committee then finished its work by the beginning of November. On November 4, the final bill resolving the differences was passed by the Senate 90–8, and by the House 362–57. The legislation was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on November 12, 1999.

==Changes caused by the Act==
Many of the largest banks, brokerages, and insurance companies desired the Act at the time. The justification was that individuals usually put more money into investments when the economy is doing well, but they put most of their money into savings accounts when the economy turns bad. With the new Act, they would be able to do both &#x27;savings&#x27; and &#x27;investment&#x27; at the same financial institution, which would be able to do well in both good and bad economic times.

Prior to the Act, most financial services companies were already offering both saving and investment opportunities to their customers. On the retail/consumer side, a bank called Norwest Corporation, which would later merge with Wells Fargo Bank, led the charge in offering all types of financial services products in 1986. American Express attempted to own participants in almost every field of financial business (although there was little synergy among them). Things culminated in 1998 when Citibank merged with The Travelers Companies, creating Citigroup. The merger violated the Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA), but Citibank was given a two-year forbearance that was based on an assumption that they would be able to force a change in the law. The Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act passed in November 1999, repealing portions of the BHCA and the Glass–Steagall Act, allowing banks, brokerages, and insurance companies to merge, thus making the CitiCorp/Travelers Group merger legal.

Also prior to the passage of the Act, there were many relaxations to the &quot;Glass–Steagall Act&quot;. For example, a few years earlier, commercial Banks were allowed to pursue investment banking, and before that banks were also allowed to begin stock and insurance brokerage. Insurance underwriting was the only main operation they weren&#x27;t allowed to do, something rarely done by banks even after the passage of the Act. The Act further enacted three provisions that allow for bank holding companies to engage in physical commodity activities. Prior to the enactment of the Act those activities were limited to those that were so closely related to banking to be considered incidental to it. Under GLBA depending on the provision the institution falls into, bank holding companies can engage in physical commodity trading, energy tolling, energy management services, and merchant banking activities.

Much consolidation occurred in the financial services industry since, but not at the scale some had expected. Retail banks, for example, do not tend to buy insurance underwriters, as they seek to engage in a more profitable business of insurance brokerage by selling products of other insurance companies. Other retail banks were slow to market investments and insurance products and package those products in a convincing way. Brokerage companies had a hard time getting into banking, because they do not have a large branch and backshop footprint. Banks have recently tended to buy other banks, such as the 2004 Bank of America and Fleet Boston merger, yet they have had less success integrating with investment and insurance companies. Many banks have expanded into investment banking, but have found it hard to package it with their banking services, without resorting to questionable tie-ins which caused scandals at Smith Barney.

==Remaining restrictions==
Crucial to the passing of this Act was an amendment made to the GLBA, stating that no merger may go ahead if any of the financial holding institutions, or affiliates thereof, received a &quot;less than satisfactory rating at its most recent CRA exam&quot;, essentially meaning that any merger may only go ahead with the strict approval of the regulatory bodies responsible for the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). This was an issue of hot contention, and the Clinton Administration stressed that it &quot;would veto any legislation that would scale back minority-lending requirements.&quot;

GLBA also did not remove the restrictions on banks placed by the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 which prevented financial institutions from owning non-financial corporations. It conversely prohibits corporations outside of the banking or finance industry from entering retail and/or commercial banking. Many assume Wal-Mart&#x27;s desire to convert its industrial bank to a commercial/retail bank ultimately drove the banking industry to back the GLBA restrictions.

Some restrictions remain to provide some amount of separation between the investment and commercial banking operations of a company. For example, licensed bankers must have separate business cards, e.g., &quot;Personal Banker, Wells Fargo Bank&quot; and &quot;Investment Consultant, Wells Fargo Private Client Services&quot;. Much of the debate about financial privacy is specifically centered around allowing or preventing the banking, brokerage, and insurances divisions of a company from working together.

In terms of compliance, the key rules under the Act include &quot;The Financial Privacy Rule&quot; which governs the collection and disclosure of customers&#x27; personal financial information by financial institutions. It also applies to companies, regardless of whether they are financial institutions, that receive such information. &quot;The Safeguards Rule&quot; requires all financial institutions to design, implement and maintain safeguards to protect customer information. The Safeguards Rule applies not only to financial institutions that collect information from their own customers, but also to financial institutions – such as credit reporting agencies, appraisers, and mortgage brokers – that receive customer information from other financial institutions.

==Privacy==
* GLBA compliance is mandatory; whether a financial institution discloses nonpublic information or not, there must be a policy in place to protect the information from foreseeable threats in security and data integrity.
* Major components put into place to govern the collection, disclosure, and protection of consumers&#x27; nonpublic personal information; or personally identifiable information include:
** Financial Privacy Rule
** Safeguards Rule
** Pretexting Protection

===Financial Privacy Rule===
(Subtitle A: Disclosure of Nonpublic Personal Information, codified at )

The Financial Privacy Rule requires financial institutions to provide each consumer with a privacy notice at the time the consumer relationship is established and annually thereafter. The privacy notice must explain the information collected about the consumer, where that information is shared, how that information is used, and how that information is protected. The notice must also identify the consumer&#x27;s right to opt out of the information being shared with unaffiliated parties pursuant to the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Should the privacy policy change at any point in time, the consumer must be notified again for acceptance. Each time the privacy notice is reestablished, the consumer has the right to opt out again. The unaffiliated parties receiving the nonpublic information are held to the acceptance terms of the consumer under the original relationship agreement. In summary, the financial privacy rule provides for a privacy policy agreement between the company and the consumer pertaining to the protection of the consumer&#x27;s personal nonpublic information.

On November 17, 2009, eight federal regulatory agencies released the final version of a model privacy notice form to make it easier for consumers to understand how financial institutions collect and share information about consumers.

====Financial institutions====
GLBA defines financial institutions as: &quot;companies that offer financial products or services to individuals, like loans, financial or investment advice, or insurance&quot;. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has jurisdiction over financial institutions similar to, and including, these:
* Non-bank mortgage lenders,
* Real estate appraisers,
* Loan brokers,
* Some financial or investment advisers,
* Debt collectors,
* Tax return preparers,
* Banks, and
* Real estate settlement service providers.

These companies must also be considered significantly engaged in the financial service or production that defines them as a &quot;financial institution&quot;.

Insurance has jurisdiction first by the state, provided the state law at minimum complies with the GLB. State law can require greater compliance, but not less than what is otherwise required by the GLB.

====Consumer vs. customer defined====
The &quot;Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act&quot; defines a &quot;consumer&quot; as
:&quot;an individual who obtains, from a financial institution, financial products or services which are to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and also means the legal representative of such an individual.&quot; (See .)

A customer is a consumer that has developed a relationship with privacy rights protected under the &quot;GLB&quot;. A customer is not someone using an automated teller machine (ATM) or having a check cashed at a cash advance business. These are not ongoing relationships like a customer might have—i.e., a mortgage loan, tax advising, or credit financing. A business is not an individual with personal nonpublic information, so a business cannot be a customer under the &quot;GLB&quot;. A business, however, may be liable for compliance to the &quot;GLB&quot; depending upon the type of business and the activities utilizing individual&#x27;s personal nonpublic information.

====Consumer/client privacy rights====
Under the &quot;GLB&quot;, financial institutions must provide their clients a privacy notice that explains what information the company gathers about the client, where this information is shared, and how the company safeguards that information. This privacy notice must be given to the client prior to entering into an agreement to do business. There are exceptions to this when the client accepts a delayed receipt of the notice in order to complete a transaction on a timely basis. This has been somewhat mitigated due to online acknowledgement agreements requiring the client to read or scroll through the notice and check a box to accept terms.

The privacy notice must also explain to the customer the opportunity to &#x27;opt out&#x27;. Opting out means that the client can say &quot;no&quot; to allowing their information to be shared with nonaffiliated third parties. The &quot;Fair Credit Reporting Act&quot; is responsible for the &#x27;opt-out&#x27; opportunity, but the privacy notice must inform the customer of this right under the GLB. The client cannot opt out of:
* Information shared with those providing priority service to the financial institution
* Marketing of products or services for the financial institution
* When the information is deemed legally required.
* When entering into a financial transaction, the institution providing said transaction must provide the customer a secure room with the ability to close in order to better protect the clients personal information.

====Receipt of GLBA notices by consumers====
===== ¶ Service of notice requirements =====
Notice requirements may vary. In most cases, service of a GLBA notice is not necessary unless the entity serving the notice intends to &quot;share&quot; customer information, which the FTC defines as, &quot;non-public personal information (NPI)&quot;, of customers required to be protected under &quot;GLBA&quot;.

=====¶ Response to receipt of a GLBA notice=====
A consumer may react to service of a &quot;GLBA&quot; notice by:

* Not responding
* Indicating, on an acknowledgment form that notice was not provided (typically for in-person signed documents) 
* Responding according to format suggested in the GLBA Notice
* Responding with a prepared letter (alone or in addition to the form)

====Synergy between GLBA and GDPR====
The European Union&#x27;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) became enforceable on 25 May 2018. As applies to consumers, the GDPR includes provision on scope of data collection, but also includes right of access, right to erasure, right to restriction of processing and right to data portability. Due to the multinational nature of some transactions, including data and internet transactions, and the possible implementation of corresponding regulations in some US states, it is likely that business and other entities will comply with the GDPR as well as US &quot;GLBA&quot; requirements.

Individualized requests for privacy under the &quot;GLBA&quot; are likely to include provisions guaranteed by the European Union&#x27;s GDPR.

===Safeguards Rule===
(Subtitle A: Disclosure of Nonpublic Personal Information, codified at )

The Safeguards Rule implements data security requirements from the GLBA and requires financial institutions to develop a written information security plan that describes how the company is prepared for, and plans to continue to protect its clients&#x27; nonpublic personal information. The Safeguards Rule applies to information of any consumer&#x27;s past or present regarding the financial institution&#x27;s products or services. The written plan must include:

* Denoting at least one employee to manage the safeguards
* Constructing a thorough risk analysis on each department handling the nonpublic information
* Develop, monitor, and test a program to secure the information
* Adapting the safeguards as needed with contemporary changes in how information is collected, stored, and used

The Safeguards Rule forces financial institutions to take a closer look at how they manage private data and to do a risk analysis on their current processes. The Federal Register features approaches for risk assessments such as evaluating the likelihood of magnitudes of harm that result from threats and errors and safeguards are commensurate with the risks they address. No process is perfect, so this has meant that every financial institution has had to make some effort to comply with the &quot;GLBA&quot;.

In December 2021, the Safeguards Rule was updated, amid some controversy, by the FTC to include specific criteria requiring financial institutions to introduce new security controls and to increase the accountability of boards of directors, with a six-month compliance extension, from January to June 2023, granted for some types of institutions in November 2022.

===Pretexting protection===
(Subtitle B: Fraudulent Access to Financial Information, codified at )

Pretexting (sometimes referred to as &quot;social engineering&quot;) occurs when someone tries to gain access to personal nonpublic information without proper authority to do so. This may entail requesting private information while impersonating the account holder, by telephone, by mail, by e-mail, or even by &quot;phishing&quot; (i.e., using a phony website or email to collect data). GLBA encourages the organizations covered by GLBA to implement safeguards against pretexting. For example, a well-written plan designed to meet GLB&#x27;s Safeguards Rule (&quot;develop, monitor, and test a program to secure the information&quot;) would likely include a section on training employees to recognize and deflect inquiries made under pretext. In fact, the evaluation of the effectiveness of such employee training probably should include a follow-up program of random spot checks, &quot;outside the classroom&quot;, after completion of the [initial] employee training, in order to check on the resistance of a given (randomly chosen) student to various types of &quot;social engineering&quot;—perhaps even designed to focus attention on any new wrinkle that might have arisen &quot;after&quot; the [initial] effort to &quot;develop&quot; the curriculum for such employee training. Under United States law, pretexting by individuals is punishable as a common law crime of false pretenses.

==Effect on usury law==
Section 731 of the GLB, codified as subsection (f) of , contains a unique provision aimed at Arkansas, whose usury limit was set at five percent above the Federal Reserve discount rate by the Arkansas Constitution and could not be changed by the Arkansas General Assembly. When the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ruled that interstate banks established under the Riegle–Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 could use their home state&#x27;s usury law for all branches nationwide with minimal restrictions, Arkansas-based banks were placed at a severe competitive disadvantage to Arkansas branches of interstate banks; this led to out-of-state takeovers of several Arkansas banks, including the sale of First Commercial Bank (then Arkansas&#x27; largest bank) to Regions Financial Corporation in 1998.

Under Section 731, all banks headquartered in a state covered by that law may charge up to the highest usury limit of any state that is headquarters to an interstate bank which has branches in the covered state. Therefore, since Arkansas has branches of banks based in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, and Texas, any loan that is legal under the usury laws of any of those states may be made by an Arkansas-based bank under Section 731. The section does not apply to interstate banks with branches in the covered state, but headquartered elsewhere; however, Arkansas-based interstate banks like Arvest Bank may export their Section 731 limits to other states.

Due to Section 731, it is generally regarded that Arkansas-based banks now have no usury limit for credit cards or for any loan of greater than $2,000 (since Alabama, Regions&#x27; home state, has no limits on those loans), with a limit of 18% (the minimum usury limit in Texas) or more on all other loans. However, once Wells Fargo fully completed its purchase of Century Bank (a Texas bank with Arkansas branches), Section 731 did away with all usury limits for Arkansas-based banks since Wells Fargo&#x27;s main bank charter is based in South Dakota, which repealed its usury laws many years ago.

Though designed for Arkansas, Section 731 may also apply to Alaska and California whose constitutions provide for the same basic usury limit, though unlike Arkansas their legislatures can (and generally do) set different limits. If Section 731 applies to those states, then all their usury limits are inapplicable to banks based in those states, since Wells Fargo has branches in both states.

==Controversy==
===Criticisms===
The act is often cited as a cause of the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis &quot;even by some of its onetime supporters.&quot; Former President Barack Obama has stated that GLBA led to deregulation that, among other things, allowed for the creation of giant financial supermarkets that could own investment banks, commercial banks and insurance firms, something banned since the Great Depression. Its passage, critics also say, cleared the way for companies that were too big and intertwined to fail.

Economist Joseph Stiglitz has also argued that the Act increased risk-taking leading up to the crisis, stating &quot;the culture of investment banks was conveyed to commercial banks and everyone got involved in the high-risk gambling mentality&quot;. In an article in &quot;The Nation&quot;, Mark Sumner asserted that the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act was responsible for the creation of entities that took on more risk due to their being considered &quot;too big to fail&quot;.

===Defenses===

According to a 2009 policy report from the Cato Institute authored by one of the institute&#x27;s directors, Mark A. Calabria, critics of the legislation feared that, with the allowance for mergers between investment and commercial banks, GLBA allowed the newly-merged banks to take on riskier investments while at the same time removing any requirements to maintain enough equity, exposing the assets of its banking customers. Calabria claimed that, prior to the passage of GLBA in 1999, investment banks were already capable of holding and trading the very financial assets claimed to be the cause of the mortgage crisis, and were also already able to keep their books as they had. He concluded that greater access to investment capital as many investment banks went public on the market explains the shift in their holdings to trading portfolios. Calabria noted that after GLBA passed, most investment banks did not merge with depository commercial banks, and that in fact, the few banks that did merge weathered the crisis better than those that did not.

In February 2009, one of the act&#x27;s co-authors, former Senator Phil Gramm, also defended his bill:
Bill Clinton, as well as economists Brad DeLong and Tyler Cowen have all argued that the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act softened the impact of the crisis. &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; columnist Megan McArdle has argued that if the act was &quot;part of the problem, it would be the commercial banks, not the investment banks, that were in trouble&quot; and repeal would not have helped the situation. An article in the conservative publication &quot;National Review&quot; has made the same argument, calling allegations about the Act &quot;folk economics.&quot; A &quot;New York Times&quot; financial columnist and occasional critic of GLBA Andrew Ross Sorkin stated that he believes GLBA had little to do with the failed institutions.

==Amendments==
===Proposed===
*National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 1155; 113th Congress) () is a bill meant to reduce the regulatory costs of complying with multiple states&#x27; requirements for insurance companies, making it easier for the same company to operate in multiple states. The bill would amend the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act to repeal the contingent conditions under which the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB) shall not be established. The bill would transform the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB) into a clearing house that set up its own standards that insurance companies would be required to meet in order to do business in other states. In this new system, however, the insurance company would only have to meet the requirements of their home state and the NARAB (only two entities), not their home state and every other state they wished to operate in (multiple entities). Proponents of the bill argued that it would help lower costs for insurance companies and make insurance cheaper for people to buy.

<text>Cosworth is a British automotive engineering company founded in London in 1958, specialising in high-performance internal combustion engines, powertrain, and electronics for automobile racing (motorsport) and mainstream automotive industries. Cosworth is based in Northampton, England, with facilities in Cottenham, England, Silverstone, England, and Indianapolis, IN, US.

Cosworth has collected 176 wins in Formula One (F1) as engine supplier, ranking third with most wins, behind Ferrari and Mercedes.

==Corporate history==

The company was founded as a British racing internal combustion engine maker in 1958 by Mike Costin and Keith Duckworth. Its company name, &quot;Cosworth&quot;, was derived as a portmanteau of the surnames of its two founders (Costin and Duckworth).

Both of the co-founders were former employees of Lotus Engineering Ltd., and Cosworth initially maintained a strong relationship with Lotus&#x27;s Colin Chapman; initial revenues of the company came almost exclusively from Lotus. When the company was founded in 1958, Duckworth left Lotus, leaving Costin (who had signed a term-employment contract with Chapman) at the company. Until 1962, Costin worked on Cosworth projects in his private time, while being active as a key Lotus engineer on the development of Lotus 15 through 26 (Elan), as well as leading the Team Lotus contingent at foreign races, as evidenced by the 1962 Le Mans Lotus scandal.


Initial series production engines (Mk.II, Mk.V, Mk.VIII, and Mk.XIV) were sold to Lotus exclusively, and many of the other racing engines up to Mk.XII were delivered to Team Lotus. The success of Formula Junior engines (Mk.III, IV, XI, and XVII) started bringing in non-Lotus revenues, and the establishment of Formula B by the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) allowed the financial foundation of Cosworth to be secured by the increased sales of Mk.XIII, a pure racing engine based on Lotus TwinCam, through its domination of the class. This newly found security enabled the company to distance itself from the Lotus Mk.VII and Elan optional road engine assembly business, and allowed its resources to be concentrated on racing engine development.

The first Cosworth-designed cylinder head was for SCA series; with a single overhead camshaft (SOHC) reverse-flow configuration, similar to the Coventry Climax FWE engine. A real success was achieved with the next gear-driven double overhead camshaft (DOHC) four-valve FVA in 1966, when Cosworth, with a help from Chapman, convinced Ford to purchase the rights to the design, and sign a development contract, including an eight-cylinder version. This resulted in the DFV, which dominated Formula One for many years.

From this time on, Cosworth was supported by Ford for many years, and many of the Cosworth designs were owned by Ford and named as Ford engines under similar contracts.
Cosworth then went through a number of ownership changes. After Duckworth decided he did not want to be involved with the day-to-day business of running a growing company, he sold his stake to United Engineering Industries (UEI) in 1980, retaining his life presidency and day-to-day technical involvement with Cosworth, and becoming a UEI board director; UEI was a group of small- to medium-sized technology companies, which was taken over by Carlton Communications in 1988. Carlton was primarily interested in some of the audio-visual companies in the UEI portfolio, and Cosworth was a poor fit with these; a new buyer for the company in the engineering/automotive sector was sought, and the traditional engineering company Vickers plc bought Cosworth in 1990.

In September 1998, Vickers sold Cosworth to Audi. Audi kept the engineering, manufacturing and casting unit, which it called Cosworth Technology, and sold the race engine division, Cosworth Racing, and its electronics division, Pi Research, to Ford. In December 2004, Audi announced that it had sold Cosworth Technology to Mahle GmbH; the company was renamed as MAHLE Powertrain on 1 July 2005.

On 15 November 2004 Ford sold Cosworth Racing to Champ Car World Series owners Gerald Forsythe and Kevin Kalkhoven. In December 2004, Ford also sold Pi Research to Kalkhoven and Forsythe, creating the Cosworth Group.

Since 2006, Cosworth has diversified to provide engineering consultancy, high performance electronics, and component manufacture services outside of its classic motorsport customer base. On 25 February 2008, Cosworth was awarded a $5.4 million contract by the United States Navy to develop a heavy fuel engine for their RQ-21A Blackjack unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

Cosworth then established an engineering partnership with Aston Martin on one of the world&#x27;s most powerful hybrid electric road car engines for the Aston Martin Valkyrie. Their naturally-aspirated 6.5-litre V12 engine develops at 10,500 rpm, and 740 N⋅m (546 lbf⋅ft) of torque at 7,000 rpm, claiming a new standard for maximum rpm and weight
Cosworth supplied its last premier class racing engines to one F1 team in 2013, the Marussia F1 Team.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cosworth.com/sport/f1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal combustion engines==
===Early types===
The following is the list of initial products, with cylinder heads modified, but not originally designed by Cosworth, on Ford Kent engine cylinder blocks. The exceptions were Mk.XVII and MAE (modified Anglia engine), which had intake port sleeves for downdraft carburettors brazed into the stock cast iron cylinder head, in place of the normal side draft ports, thus could be considered Cosworth designs.

In addition to the above, Cosworth designed and provided the assembly work for Lotus Elan Special Equipment optional road engines with special camshafts and high compression pistons.

The final model of the above initial series was the &quot;MAE&quot; in 1965, when new rules were introduced in Formula 3 allowing up to engines with 36 mm intake restrictor plates. MAE used one barrel of a two barrel Weber IDA downdraft carburettor with the other barrel blanked off. The domination of this engine was absolute as long as these regulations lasted until 1968. As Cosworth had a serious difficulty meeting the demand, the MAE was mainly sold as a kit. This experience led to the later FVA/DFV contract to be drawn where the responsibility of development rested with Cosworth, and the manufacturing right and responsibility rested with Ford. There also were some specially cast iron heads with similar dimensions to these brazed heads with titanium alloy valve spring retainers called the &quot;screamer head&quot; for MAE in later years.

===The SCA series===
A year before the introduction of the MAE, the single overhead cam two valve SCA was introduced. It was a 997 cc engine based on Ford Cortina 116E block that was designed for Formula 2, and featured the first totally Cosworth-designed head, Laystall forged crankshaft, steel main bearing caps and pistons with only one compression ring and one oil scraper ring each. Cylinder head to block sealing was by a head gasket incorporating Cooper Rings. The basic configuration was quite similar to Coventry Climax FWE on Lotus Elite including its SOHC reverse-flow design, except for a series of seven spur gears (one on the crank, two intermediary gears on two fixed shafts mounted on the front cover back plate, one on the 116E camshaft used as a jackshaft, two on a common fixed shaft in the head, and one on the camshaft) driving a five-bearing camshaft and the Ford five main bearing iron block. The intake ports and the oil scavenge pickup for dry sump lubrication were canted 25 degrees, so they faced straight up and down, respectively, when the engine was mounted 25 degrees from vertical to the right for a lower centre of gravity.

The SCA initially had two 40DCM2 Weber twin-choke downdraft sand-cast carburettors mounted on top to produce 115 hp, which was replaced by Lucas fuel injection in 1966, eventually reaching 140 hp.
The longer stroke SCB was built to compare against the 1,498 cc Mk.XVI, and upon proving its superior power against the Mundy-designed two-valve crossflow DOHC head, it acted as the benchmark for the development of FVA to measure the benefits and shortcomings of a four valve crossflow DOHC design. It was the results of this four valve development work that formed the basis for many of the Cosworth engines that followed.

A larger 85 mm bore SCC with the same short-stroke five-bearing crankshaft as the SCA was built and sold for SCCA 1.1 litre sports car class.


===The FVA series===
The Cortina Crossflow block was also the basis for the FVA (four valve Type A), an F2 engine introduced in 1966, and developed under the same contract as the DFV, for the new 1.6-litre engine rules. This engine featured 16 valves operated by twin overhead camshafts driven by a train of 9 gears. The metering unit for the Lucas mechanical fuel injection was rotated by a toothed belt from the gear-driven inlet cam, while the exhaust cam directly drove an alternator on the rear of the head. It produced at 9000 rpm. This engine dominated the category until 1971, and was also used in sports car racing in 1.8 Litre form as the &quot;FVC&quot;.

The cylinder head on the FVA pioneered many of Duckworth&#x27;s ideas that would be used on the DFV and a mule for the eight-cylinder engine development, FVB, was built. However, the distance between the two camshafts and the valve inclination angle were larger than on DFV for the series.

The larger displacement FVD was designed and released for endurance racing in 1975, that displaced on the aluminium block developed for BDG. The FVD produced only , down from the that other twin-cam four cylinders such as the Hart 420S produced but was more reliable. One was campaigned in the CanAm series in 1978 in the Osprey SR-1, built and driven by Dan Hartill.

===The DFV (Double Four Valve)===
In 1966, Colin Chapman (Lotus Cars founder and principal of Team Lotus) persuaded Ford to bankroll Keith Duckworth&#x27;s design for a new lightweight Formula One engine. Cosworth received the order along with the £100,000 that Ford felt it adequate to spend on such an objective. The contract stipulated that a four-cylinder Ford-based F2 engine would be developed as proof of concept (see the FVA above) and that a pure Cosworth V8 would be built based on this.

The DFV design used a similar cylinder head to the one Duckworth had prototyped on the four-cylinder FVB unit on a custom Cosworth cylinder block and crankcase, forming a single 90° V8 engine, thus creating a legend in its own right, the DFV – meaning &quot;Double Four Valve&quot;. This engine and its derivatives were used for a quarter of a century, and it was the most successful in the history of Formula One / Grand Prix motor racing. Winning 167 races in a career lasting over 20 years, it was the product that put Cosworth Engineering on the map. Although originally designed for Formula One, the engine has been modified to be used in a range of categories.

The DFV won on its first outing, at the 1967 Dutch Grand Prix in the hands of Jim Clark, fitted to a Lotus 49, and from 1968 was available for purchase to any F1 team that wished it. During the 1970s, it was common for almost the entire field (with the notable exception of Ferrari, BRM and Alfa Romeo scoring wins and titles with V12 engines) to use one of these engines – this at a time when independent wealthy individuals could buy exactly the same engine off the shelf that was also being used by McLaren et al. Most teams just built a tub around a Cosworth DFV and a Hewland gearbox. It won a record 155 World Championship races, the last being Detroit in 1983, powering a Tyrrell driven by Michele Alboreto.

Although the DFV (bore: , stroke: , displacement: ) with at 9,000 rpm did not produce as much power as some of its rival 12-cylinder engines, it was lighter, resulting in a better power to weight ratio. In addition to being lighter, it was also made a structural part of the car itself, by placing load bearing arms to stress the block. These design aspects appealed tremendously to the genius of Colin Chapman who used them to the fullest extent.

The DFY, introduced in 1982 was a further evolution of the DFV for Formula One, with a shorter stroke and a DFL bore (bore: , stroke: , displacement ) with at 11,000 rpm, thereby producing more power, but still unable to fight against the turbocharged cars of the day. It was the advent of turbocharged engines in Formula One which sounded the death knell for the venerable DFV, and in 1986 Cosworth returned to the lower formulae preparing the DFV for the newly created Formula 3000, with the installation of a compulsory 9,000 rpm rev limiter, which scaled power back from 500 to ; the DFV remained in this class until 1992 and the DFY until 1995. By this time the Cosworth AC V8 replaced the DFV/Y in F3000 and was the dominant engine in the class until it became a spec-series in 1996 using a Zytek-Judd V8. The final F3000 engines gave , almost equalling the 1983 DFV which gave at 11,200 rpm.

In Formula One, a new DFV-based design was introduced for the new normally aspirated rules in 1987. The DFZ was produced as an interim model, but in 1988 Cosworth created the DFV&#x27;s final evolution, the DFR, which soldiered on in F1 with smaller teams until 1991, scoring its last points – including a pair of second places by Jean Alesi – with Tyrrell in 1990.

The DFV has recently been given a new lease of life as a result of interest in Classic F1 racing, which was given a World Championship status by the FIA in 2004.

====DFV variants====
The DFV spawned a number of derivations. In 1968; Cosworth created the DFV&#x27;s first derivation, a version for the Tasman Series, the DFW. DFV to DFW conversion simply involved substitution of a short-stroke crank and longer connecting rods.

One of the most successful and longest-lived projects of Cosworth has been its CART / Champ Car engine programme. In 1975; Cosworth developed the DFX, by destroking the engine to and adding a turbocharger, the DFX became the standard engine to run in IndyCar racing, ending the reign of the Offenhauser, and maintaining that position until the late 1980s. Ford backed Cosworth with creating a new interim design for IndyCar racing in the late 1980s, the DFS, which merged DFR technology into the ageing DFX design, but it was eventually rendered obsolete by advancing technology.

While designed as an F1 engine, the DFV was also used as in endurance racing, although its flat-plane crank design led to destructive vibrations putting stress on devices surrounding the engine, especially the exhaust system. The first sports car to use a DFV, the Ford P68, failed to finish a single race because of repeated mechanical and electrical failures. Despite this handicap the DFV won the 24 Hours of Le Mans twice in its original 3.0 Litre form for Mirage in 1975 and Rondeau in 1980, who were able to attain sufficient reliability by de-tuning the motor.

The DFL for endurance racing was developed for the 1982 season to replace the DFV. It came in two versions: one with and the other with . While neither competed well in the Group C (C1 Class) the former was adapted to the C2 Class (700 kg minimum weight, 55 Litres fuel, 5 refuelings/1000 km) starting in 1984. During the latter half of the 1980s it was the most popular motor for that class, with successful championship campaigns and five class wins at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The latter version&#x27;s severe lack of reliability caused it to fall out of use by 1985.

===The BDA series===
Cosworth solidified its association with Ford in 1969, by developing a double overhead camshaft (DOHC) 16-valve inline four-cylinder engine for road use in the Ford Escort. As Keith Duckworth was busy designing and developing the DFV, the project was assigned to Mike Hall, who created the 1601 cc BDA on the Ford Kent engine block for homologation purposes. The camshafts were driven by a toothed belt developed for Fiat 124, hence the name BDA, literally meaning &quot;Belt Drive, A type&quot;. It was designed for FIA Group 2 and Group 4 on either rallying or touring car racing purpose. The nominal homologation at 1601 cc capacity meant that BDA-engined cars competed in what was usually the top class (1600 cc and up) so were eligible for overall victories rather than class wins.

In 1970, the 1701 cc BDB was created for the Escort RS1600, and this engine received fuel injection for the first time in the series as 1701 cc BDC. Two years later, the BDA series was adopted for Formula 2; first came the 1790 cc BDE, then the 1927 cc BDF eventually reaching a maximum of 1975 cc BDG in 1973. As the bore size reached ever closer to the bore centre distance, leaving little space in between cylinders, all three types had brazed-in cylinder liners to the block. As a departure from the Ford iron block, the BDG received a new aluminium block (originally designed by Brian Hart in 1971 and re-engineered by Cosworth) soon after, and this cylinder block was used as a replacement part in rebuilding many other BD series engines as well as some Mk.XIII engines.

The iron block was also used for smaller displacements; starting with the very successful 1599 cc Formula Atlantic BDD in 1970, followed by the 1098 cc BDJ and 1300 cc BDH variants for SCCA Formula C and sports car racing, respectively. There was even a one-off 785 cc version built by Cosworth employees Paul Squires and Phil Kidsley; fitted with a Lysholm supercharger it was installed in a Brabham BT28 Formula 3 chassis and competed in the British Hill Climb Championship as the Brabham-Lysholm.

In 1970, Ford asked Weslake and Co of Rye, East Sussex to build the BDD for them, and by the end of 1970, the production line was installed at Rye and production was under way. These engines were often called the &#x27;BDA&#x27;, but were 1599 cc BDDs eligible for under 1.6 Litre class.
The 1599 cc BDD engine won a number of championships around the world in Formula Atlantic and Formula Pacific during the 1980s.

In 1975, 1599 cc big valve BDM (225 bhp) was developed with fuel injection for Formula Atlantic, and a &#x27;sealed engine&#x27; version BDN (1599 cc, 210 bhp) followed in 1977 for Canadian Formula Atlantic series.

Largely known as &#x27;Cosworth BDA&#x27; or &#x27;Ford BDA&#x27;, BDD and BDM were also very successful in Formula Pacific and Formula Mondial racing in Australia and New Zealand. In open wheel racing, Cosworth powered cars (Ralt RT4 and Tiga&#x27;s) won Australian Drivers&#x27; Championship in 1982–1986 as well as winning the Australian Grand Prix in 1981–1984 (including wins by Alain Prost and Roberto Moreno) before the race became part of the Formula One World Championship in 1985, and won the New Zealand Grand Prix each year from 1982 to 1988. BDD and BDM engines were also prominent in the Australian Sports Car Championship during the 1980s, winning the 1987 championship.
The turbo charged 1778 cc BDT was created in 1981, which powered the never-raced RWD Escort RS1700T. In 1984, 4WD Ford RS200 debuted with a 1803 cc version of BDT, which was created for Group B rallying. Between 1984 and 1986 the BDT engine was used in Group C endurance racing by Roy Baker, in class C2 using the Tiga GC284, GC285 and GC286. Later in 1986, a 2137 cc version was created by Brian Hart using a bespoke aluminium block and a large intercooler for RS200 Evolution, just as Group B was cancelled by the FIA. This BDT-E (&#x27;E&#x27; for Evolution) produced over in Group B &#x27;rallycross&#x27; boost level, normally producing on a lower but sustainable boost.

In 1983, the BD series saw its second road engine incarnation (the first being the original BDA and BDB), the BDR, which was a BDA or BDB sold in kit form for the Caterham Super Seven in 1601 cc (120 bhp) and in 1701 cc (130 bhp) formats.

The Hart 420R and the Zakspeed F1 engines owe much to the BDA series, being essentially an aluminium-block derivative using similar heads.

===The GA/GAA V6===

A fuel-injected belt-driven DOHC GA (also called the GAA) was based on the 60 degree V6 block of Ford Essex, and was used for the Ford Capris raced in Group 2 in the early 1970s. This had a capacity of , and was highly competitive against the BMW straight-sixes. The GA was also used in the later years of Formula 5000 in Europe.

The GA or GAA was commissioned by Ford in May 1972, when Ford realised that the Cologne V6 based Weslake OHV V6 engines used in their Capris which competed in the European Touring Car Championship had been modified to the point that no more performance could be extracted from them. Mike Hall, who had already designed the highly successful Cosworth DFV and BDA engines, took on the task of developing a whole new engine based on the 3-Litre Essex V6 block.

The new engine was radically different from the previously used Weslake unit in that it featured twin overhead camshaft aluminium alloy cylinder heads, 4 valves per cylinder, a Lucas mechanical fuel injection system, dry sump oiling system, a steel crankshaft, and enlarged displacement of 3412cc, compared with the 2.9 litres of the previously used Cologne V6 based Weslake V6.

Ford expected a minimum of 400 Hp from the new Cosworth engine; that figure was exceeded, with the engine producing 420 Hp in the first test run. In race tune they finally produced around 462 bhp (345 kW; 468 PS) at 9000 rpm and 300 ft-lb of torque (407 Nm). This meant that the new engine proved highly successful at competing against BMW in the 1973 Season of the European Touring Car Championship where the engine was installed in Ford&#x27;s newly homologated Capri RS 3100.

Ford Motorsport also sold 100 Cosworth GA V6 engines, most of them ending up in Formula 5000 cars.

The GA/GAA V6 is a very rare, and extremely expensive engine, with rebuilt units priced at £50,000.

===The FBA and FBC V6===

The FBA and FBC engines were found in the Ford Granada and Ford Scorpio. The FBA came first in 1991 and was also known as the &#x27;BOA&#x27;; it was based on the Ford Cologne V6 used in the Ford Sierra and Ford Capri and other models and was a twin overhead camshaft 24valve conversion for more power, producing and better idle quality.

In 1995, with a new version of the Scorpio, it was upgraded with a wider torque spread and higher power – to , from a variable intake system and reprofiled cams. The NVH was improved with a change from a single chain to drive all four camshafts – to one chain to drive one bank of cams and a second for the other bank; this engine was known as the &#x27;BOB&#x27;.

A racing version was also available for a short time – FBE – with an individual throttle butterfly for each cylinder.

FBB and FBD engines existed as development engines but these were never released.

The two production engines were always mated to an automatic gearbox but have become popular in the custom car scene where they have been mated to the 4x4 manual transmission and the rear-wheel-drive manual transmission from the Ford Sierra XR4 and XR4x4. There are also companies that offer twin and single turbo conversions, and other modifications to increase power to usually around . These engines can be bought relatively cheaply and, providing they are well serviced, engines have been known to cover over 200,000 miles without major work being required.

=== The YB series===

The YB series of engines are based on the older inline four Ford T88 engine block, and were introduced in the road-going Ford Sierra RS Cosworth in 1986 with . With 5,000 units built for homologation purposes in Group A, both for rallies and touring cars. Racing versions of the RS Cosworth were developing around , but with the small Garrett T3 turbo on the cars reliability was a problem. A limited edition evolution model was introduced in mid-1987, the Sierra RS500 which included a bigger T4 turbo, with power initially at around the mark in 1987, but in later years climbing to close to some in full racing trim.

The RS500 came to dominate touring car racing in its heyday from 1987 to 1992, winning multiple championships and major races.&lt;br&gt;

The only car to truly challenge the Sierra&#x27;s power dominance towards the end of the Group A era in 1990–1992 was the , 4WD twin turbo Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R. 

At the end of its life in Group A in 1992, the Australian Sierra teams were reportedly getting around from the 2.0L turbocharged YB engines. For his pole position lap at the 1992 Bathurst 1000, Australian driver Dick Johnson (whose team since 1988 had a reputation for having the fastest Sierras in Group A racing anywhere in the world) was reportedly running a special qualifying engine that was producing close to in his RS500.

The various colour cam covers that distinguished each version were as follows: Red: YBB (Sierra Cosworth 2wd, both 3-door and Sapphire), YBD (Sierra RS500), YBJ (Sierra Sapphire 4wd, non cat); Green: YBG (catalyst equipped 4x4 Sierra Sapphire Cosworth); Blue: YBT (large-turbo Escort Cosworth); Silver: YBP (small-turbo Escort Cosworth).

Further evolutions of the YB included a reduced-emissions road version, as well as the block used in the Escort RS Cosworth (which used the Sierra floorpan). The engine stopped being used on new cars in 1997, with the Focus WRC and road-going Focus RS instead relying on Zetec designs.

===The GBA V6===

Cosworth experimented with turbocharged BD derivatives, before settling on an all-new turbocharged V6 engine to be badged as the Ford TEC (internally it was known as the GB-series). This had a long development history dating back to the 1984 British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch where Cosworth and Ford&#x27;s competition department agreed to build a new turbo engine to replace the outdated DFV / DFY series. The TEC raced only briefly, in , with the Haas Lola team and in with the Benetton team. The development of the GBA engine at Cosworth became the subject of a British TV documentary in Channel Four&#x27;s &quot;Equinox&quot; series, broadcast in 1986.
The GBA was designed by Keith Duckworth and Geoff Goddard, though many in Formula One doubted Duckworth&#x27;s ability to design another truly competitive engine due to his known distaste for turbocharging in general. Rather than design an entirely new engine, Duckworth instead chose to originally try and develop an old, modified 4 cylinder BDA sports car engine as he believed 4 cylinder engines were more compact and economical than a V6 (Cosworth&#x27;s chief race engine designer Geoff Goddard was against the idea of the straight 4, but reluctantly let Duckworth go down that path). However, after numerous failures of the test engines on the dynamometer which were eventually traced to an incurable vibration at the crankshaft, Duckworth and Goddard designed an all new 120° V6 engine instead, the same configuration as the Ferrari V6 turbo engine used from 1981 to 1986. The BDA engine was originally limited to 10,000 RPM in sports car racing, but with a turbo its failures generally happened at around 11,000 RPM. The first 4-cylinder test engine was so badly damaged that it actually changed the shape of the engine block to the point where the crankshaft would not move- the engine was simply not designed to be turbocharged. As around 4 months had been lost in trying to get the 4 cylinder engine to work, Ford and Cosworth&#x27;s plan for the engine to debut with Haas Lola in was pushed back to the 1986 season.

The GBA engine was first road tested by Haas Lola&#x27;s lead driver, World Champion Alan Jones in the new Lola THL2 at the Boreham Circuit in Essex just north-east of London on 21 February 1986. In freezing, snowy conditions (−6° Celsius) at approximately 10 AM, the V6 turbo, running a conservative 2.5 BAR boost setting, ran cleanly although the engine management electronics developed by Motorola in the United States and Cosworth had not yet been finalised and the engine ran with the same electronics that were used on the dynamometer. Also present at the test were Duckworth, Goddard, the THL2&#x27;s designer Neil Oatley, the teams #2 driver Patrick Tambay and other staff from both Haas Lola, Ford and Cosworth.

The engine made its Formula One debut with Jones driving the Lola THL2 at the 1986 San Marino Grand Prix, the third round of the 1986 season (for the opening two races in Brazil and Spain, the team used their 1985 car, the Hart 415-T turbo powered Lola THL1, while Tambay also drove the THL1 at Imola). Jones qualified in 21st place and retired after 28 of the races 60 laps due to overheating. Jones also recorded the engine&#x27;s first finish when he placed 11th in the Belgian Grand Prix. Jones and teammate Patrick Tambay captured the Ford V6 turbo&#x27;s first ever points when they finished 4th and 5th respectively in the Austrian Grand Prix, with Jones backing up in the next race in Italy with a 6th-placed finish, the final points the engine would gain in 1986.

Producing approximately , the turbocharged V6 is the most powerful Formula One engine designed and built by Cosworth. With Haas Lola not competing in 1987, Benetton, having lost the use of the 4 cylinder BMW engines when the German giant pulled out of Formula One, signed with Ford to race their V6 for the season. While in 1986 turbo boost had been unrestricted by the rules, 1987 saw the FIA introduce the pop-off valve to the turbocharged engines in a two-year plan to outlaw the turbos and make all Formula One engines 3.5 litres and naturally aspirated by the start of the season. While Cosworth adapted the TEC to 1987&#x27;s 4.0 Bar turbo limit and the new 195 litre fuel limit, development of the V6 turbo engine which would be obsolete in less than two years virtually stopped. Cosworth instead worked on the DFR V8 that was introduced with Benetton in .

With the reduction in turbo boost limit not affecting the Ford V6 as much as others such as Honda, BMW and Ferrari which had more horsepower to lose, the turbo engine would be more competitive with Benetton in 1987, with Teo Fabi taking the engine&#x27;s first podium with third in Austria, followed by its last podium when Thierry Boutsen also scored third in the last race of the season in Australia.

===The HB V8===

The HB DFV/DFZ/DFR replacement was designed by Geoff Goddard as a (96 mm x 60.4 mm) V8, introduced with the Benetton team midway through 1989, making its debut at the French Grand Prix. It won the Japanese Grand Prix that year (Benetton used both the original HBA1 and the development HBA4 in 1989).

As Ford&#x27;s de facto works team, Benetton maintained exclusivity with this model through the rest of 1989 and . saw the introduction of customer units, two specifications behind their works equivalents. In 1991, these were supplied to the fledgling Jordan Grand Prix outfit, and for 1992, Lotus. saw the customer deal extended to McLaren who had lost the use of their Honda V12 engines after 1992. Using the customer HBA7 (and later a customer HBA8), McLaren won five Grands Prix with triple World Champion Ayrton Senna that year.

The HBA1 V8 was introduced in 1989. It exploited a narrower 75° vee-angle rather than the 90° used in the DFV series, and was originally rated at approximately . By 1993, the factory HBA8 V8 engine used by Benetton was producing approximately at 13,000 rpm. Although the HB V8 was less powerful than the V10s and V12s used by rivals Renault, Honda, and Ferrari, its advantage was that it was lighter and gave better fuel economy.

A Jaguar-badged version of the HB was developed by Tom Walkinshaw Racing to the tune of 650 bhp at 11,500 rpm for sports car racing, fitted to the extremely successful Jaguar XJR-14.

===The EC, ECA, ED, EDM and ED 2/4 V8===

The HB was developed into the (100 mm x 55.7 mm) EC V8 for the 1994 season. This engine, producing about 740 bhp @ 14,500rpm, was badged as Ford Zetec-R, and Michael Schumacher won the Drivers&#x27; World Championship with Benetton (his first of a record 7 championships), in . This was the last Ford-powered F1 title.

For the 1995 season, the F1 engine regulation changed to 3 litres, and the EC&#x27;s bore and stroke were changed to 94mm x 53.9mm, resulting in ECA, which was introduced at about 600 bhp, and developed to 610 to 630 bhp at 14,000rpm. It was exclusively used by the Sauber team, whose biggest success of the year was Heinz-Harald Frentzen&#x27;s third place at Monza.

Customer unit Cosworth ED (not badged as Ford Zetec-R) for non-works teams was also made for 1995 with about 580 bhp for Simtek (called the EDB), Pacific Racing (EDC) and Forti (EDD) teams. Minardi continued with Magneti Marelli engine management as per their HB in 1994, this version having the Cosworth designation EDM. At the first test with the EDM, Luca Badoer reported that this engine felt less powerful then the 3 litre 9000rpm rev limited engine he had used to win the F3000 championship in 1992. Cosworth later updated the ED to ED 2/4 for Tyrrell and Lola with (94mm x 53.95mm) displacement for 600 bhp, which was used until the end of season.

===The JD, VJ and VJM V10===

In order to produce a higher power at higher rpm, a completely new (89mm x 48.1mm) JD 72° V10 was designed for 1996, which produced about 670 bhp at 15,800 rpm, and used by Sauber Formula One team. This engine was further developed into VJ and VJM with the same V-angle, bore and stroke, reaching 720 bhp for racing, and 730 bhp for qualifying, at 16,500 rpm. All three of these engines were badged as Ford Zetec-R as well, and used by several teams. In its debut season, the best result was another third place, this time taken by Johnny Herbert at Monaco. This was surpassed one year later by Rubens Barichello&#x27;s sensational second place, again at Monaco, which was the first points finish for the newly formed Stewart Grand Prix team.

===Further Formula One engines===

The Stewart Grand Prix team effectively became the Ford works team, and used Cosworth CR-1 engines from its first season in 1997, which was a much lighter version of VJM, ultimately reaching 770 bhp at 16,500 rpm by 2001. Over the next few years Ford had increased its involvement with the Stewart team, and finally bought the team, renaming it Jaguar Racing for 2000. Ford pulled out of F1 at the end of 2004, but the team (bought by and renamed Red Bull Racing) continued to use Cosworth V10 engines until switching to a Ferrari V8 for 2006. Minardi also used re-badged Cosworth engines until 2005.

Williams began testing the new CA2006 2.4-litre V8 in November 2005, which produced about 755 bhp @ 19,250 rpm (314.7 hp/L), and began using Cosworth V8 engines for the 2006 season. In the same year, Scuderia Toro Rosso used detuned V10 engines based on the 2005 units.

In 2007, however, the company was left without a partner when Williams chose to switch to Toyota power, and Scuderia Toro Rosso made the switch to Ferrari engines (as used in 2006 by their mother team Red Bull Racing).

In Max Mosley&#x27;s letter following the withdrawal of Honda from Formula One in December 2008, it was announced that Cosworth had won the tender to provide a standard engine to any interested participants. The new engine would become the standard design and manufacturers could opt to use whole units, construct their own from designs provided by Cosworth, or produce their own engine with the caveat that it be limited to the same power as the new &quot;standard&quot; engine.

In 2010 Cosworth returned as the engine supplier for Williams and three new teams; Hispania Racing, Lotus Racing and Virgin Racing. The CA2010 is the same 2.4-litre V8 base of the CA2006 used by Williams, but has been re-tuned for the then-mandated 18,000 rpm limit required on all engines, down from its original 20,000 rpm implementation. First units were ready and shipped to teams in mid-January for fitting 2 weeks prior to first track testing for the year.

===Other IndyCar and Champ Car engines===
Cosworth designed a series of replacements for the DFS to be used in IndyCar and Champ Car racing: the X-series, beginning in 1992 with the XB. The XF was developed for the 2000 season to replace the XD, and was chosen as the spec engine for the Champ Car World Series in 2003. The most recent derivative of the XF, the XFE quad-cam 90° V8 overhead camshaft, continued in that role through the 2007 season. The Champ Car World Series imposed a rev limit of 12,000 rpm down from the over 15,000 rpm of 2002. The 2004 model of the XFE had a rated power of nominal at 1,054 mmHg (intake boost pressure), and a maximum power of at 1130 mmHg (during Push-to-Pass). The 2004 XFE maximum speed was 12,000 rpm (rev limited) and torque of . The aluminium and iron turbo housing ran a boost of 5.9 psi at sea level (= boost of 12 inches of mercury which is 41.5 inches of mercury absolute). The Methanol-fuelled engine used a steel crankshaft and aluminium alloy pistons. Weight was and length was .

In 2007, the Ford name was removed from the engine as the manufacturer elected not to continue sponsorship of the series. Several other engine changes were made, notably the removal of the calibrated &quot;pop off valve&quot; designed to limit turbo boost pressure, replaced by engine electronics. The rated life of the engine was between rebuilds. Engines were sent by the race teams to Cosworth for the rebuild. In 2007, Champ Car switched to the new Panoz DP01 chassis, which was said to provide better ducting of airflow into the engine. The Champ Car World Series merged into the Indy Racing League IndyCar Series prior to the 2008 season, and Cosworth does not currently provide engines to any American open wheel racing series.

In mid-2003, Cosworth provided the 3.5 L V8 XG badged as a Chevrolet Gen 4 engine to IRL IndyCar Series teams after the proprietary Chevrolet Gen 3 engine proved inadequate against rival Hondas and Toyotas during the 2003 season. While many teams left Chevrolet after the 2003 season, those that stayed saw a significant improvement in performance with the new &quot;Chevworth&quot; engine compared to their previous units. The XG finished second in its first race at Michigan on July 27, 2003. Sam Hornish Jr. went on to win 3 races that season with the new XG. The XG was reduced in size to 3 L for 2004 season and it won one race in 2005 during Chevrolet&#x27;s final season in IRL.

===Other Formula Atlantic engines===
Currently these are straight-four engines based on the Mazda MZR engine developed in cooperation with Mazda. Changes includes a billet crankshaft, barrel throttle bodies, new cylinder head with larger valves, pistons, con rods and camshafts. A detuned version, targeting club racers, is sold to the consumer market. This engine retains the standard crankshaft, and has a different cylinder head. Both engines are built by Cosworth in Torrance, California, under the guidance of newly appointed technical designer Wayne Merry (formerly of Cosworth in Worcester UK).

===Other road engines===
Best known in Europe for its relationship with Ford – in particular because of the Cosworth name in the vehicle title on the high-performance Ford Sierra RS Cosworth and Ford Escort RS Cosworth, but also in the creation of other Ford models; the Escort RS1600, Escort RS1800, RS200, and Scorpio 2.9i 24V.

In the US, the name has also appeared in the title of a road car (well before it did in Europe) as the Cosworth version of the Chevrolet Vega. Only 3,508 1975 and 1976 Cosworth Vegas were produced from March 1975 through 1976. The engine features the Vega sleeveless, aluminium-alloy block fitted with forged components. The twin-cam, 16-valve, aluminium cylinder head design was assisted by Cosworth, but Chevrolet did the development work. The engine features electronic ignition, Bendix electronic fuel injection, and stainless steel headers. The final US emissions standardised version produces 110 bhp. Cosworth&#x27;s EA racing version was not successful due to engine block structural failures. Chevrolet later produced a heavy-duty &#x27;off-road&#x27; block with thicker walls to better withstand the racing application, but by that time Cosworth had moved on. Projected first year sales of the Cosworth Vega had been 5,000. With only 3,508 cars produced and many unsold, the car was discontinued. 1,500 hand-built Cosworth Vega engines were simply scrapped for lack of demand.

Other published projects for Adam Opel AG include the Opel Ascona 400 / Manta 400 rally cars and the 2.0L 16V engines in the Opel Kadett, Opel Astra GSi, Opel Vectra and Opel Calibra turbo.

Other companies known to have benefitted from the Cosworth engineering input are Mercedes-Benz (with the 190 E 2.3-16) and Audi (notably their RS cars).

Cosworth&#x27;s involvement with Mercedes-Benz came with moves in the mid-1980s from the German manufacturer to re-enter motorsport after retiring from direct factory participation after the 1955 Le Mans crash which killed 80 spectators. Mercedes-Benz was looking to create a Group B rally car out of its new W201 Chassis (190E Model) and turned to the expertise of Cosworth to shorten the development time for this project.

The request was a huge surprise for Cosworth, and the original brief for a 320 bhp engine based on the 136 bhp Mercedes M102 2.3-litre SOHC 4-cylinder engine was duly passed to Mike Hall, who &quot;drew the famed DFV and BDA engine&quot;. Designed around the existing M102 head bolt pattern, the new twin cam, 16-valve, pentroof head, had its valves set at 45° included angle, rather than the 40° angle of the BDA. The valves were the biggest that could be fitted into the combustion chamber. Flat top pistons delivered the 10.5:1 compression ratio. The new Cosworth WAA engine also was Cosworth&#x27;s first one-piece head, i.e. the camshaft carrier was cast integral with the head itself. Again the constraints of the existing head-bolt pattern meant that Hall had to shift the camshaft bearings from outside each pair of cam lobes as in the BDA to in between each cylinder&#x27;s pair of cam lobes. The upside being that this configuration made for less flex at high rpm.

The advent of the AWD turbo Audi Quattro gave the rear-wheel-drive, normally aspirated 190E rally car no chance of being successful and the competition car was stillborn. Instead Mercedes-Benz decided to recoup its development cost by selling the car as a road going sports-sedan. Hall detuned the WAA race engine to 185 bhp by reducing the port diameters and a more restrictive fuel injection and induction was substituted for the race items to complete the detune. All WAA 2.3-16 engines were built in the Cosworth factory with the heads being produced by the Coscast method.

Cosworth assisted with the later 2.5-16 engine (WAB), and the short-stroke 2.5-16 Evo engines (WAC) although these were all manufactured in house by Mercedes-Benz. The 190E 2.3-16 became the basis for privateer Mercedes entries into the DTM from 1988. The short-stroke 2.5-16 190E EVO II was race-developed to 375+ bhp, gaining the 1992 DTM crown with Klaus Ludwig at the wheel.

A V10 designated WDA was also built and tested in a Volvo S80 in 1997, but this did not see production.

In 2020, Gordon Murray Automotive commissioned Cosworth to design and build a V12 for use in their new T.50 sports car; which produces at 11,500 rpm, and of torque at 9,000 rpm.

Cosworth was chosen by Bugatti to develop a V16 engine as part of the hybrid powertrain for the upcoming Bugatti Tourbillon. The engine is reported to produce 1,000 PS (735 kW; 986 hp) and 900 N⋅m (664 lb⋅ft).

==Cosworth F1 car==

Cosworth made an attempt at designing a full Formula One Grand Prix car in 1969. The car, designed by Robin Herd, used an original 4WD transmission designed by Keith Duckworth (different from the Ferguson used by all other 4WD F1 cars of the 1960s) and powered by a magnesium version of the DFV unit. The car was planned to drive at the 1969 British Grand Prix, but it was silently withdrawn. When Herd left to form March Engineering, the project was cancelled. The external design of the car was a product of Herd&#x27;s use of Mallite sheeting (a wood-aluminium laminate composite) for the principal structural monocoque sections, a technique he pioneered on the first McLaren single-seat cars, including the McLaren M2B of 1966.

<doc id="164106" wikidata="Q1263696" url="?curid=164106" title="United States Asiatic Fleet">
<text>The United States Asiatic Fleet was a fleet of the United States Navy during much of the first half of the 20th century. Before World War II, the fleet patrolled the Philippine Islands. Much of the fleet was destroyed by the Japanese by February 1942, after which it was dissolved, and the remnants incorporated into the naval component of the South West Pacific Area command, which eventually became the Seventh Fleet.

The fleet was created when its predecessor, the Asiatic Squadron, was upgraded to fleet status in 1902. In early 1907, the fleet was downgraded and became the First Squadron of the United States Pacific Fleet. However, on 28 January 1910, it was again organized as the Asiatic Fleet. Thus constituted, the Asiatic Fleet, based in the Philippines, was organizationally independent of the Pacific Fleet, which was based on the United States West Coast until it moved to Pearl Harbor in the Territory of Hawaii in 1940.

Although much smaller than any other U.S. Navy fleet and indeed far smaller than what any navy generally considers to be a fleet, the Asiatic Fleet from 1916 was commanded by one of only four four-star admirals authorized in the U.S. Navy at the time. This reflected the prestige of the position of Asiatic Fleet commander-in-chief, who generally was more powerful and influential with regard to the affairs of the United States in China than was the American minister, or later United States Ambassador, to China.

==1902–1907==
In 1904, all armored cruisers were withdrawn from the Far East. Gunboats patrolled the Yangtze River in the Yangtze Patrol.

After Rear Admiral Charles J. Train became commander-in-chief of the fleet in March 1905, it was involved in various ways with the closing weeks of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905. After the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s decisive defeat of the Imperial Russian Navy in the Battle of Tsushima Strait in May 1905, units of the Asiatic Fleet escorted three fleeing Russian cruisers into Manila Bay in the Philippine Islands, where Train ensured that their crews were well taken care of during a lengthy stay until they were able to return to Russia.

In November 1905, Train was at the center of a diplomatic dispute while with a group of American officers on a pheasant-hunting expedition near Nanjing (Nanking), China, when he accidentally shot a Chinese woman with birdshot, inflicting minor injuries on her. A mob of hundreds of Chinese villagers formed around Train″s party and attacked it, pushing Train into the mud, seizing the officers&#x27; guns, and taking Train&#x27;s son, Navy Lieutenant Charles R. Train, hostage. When the Asiatic Fleet landed 40 United States Marines to rescue the officers, the villagers attacked them with pitchforks and the Marines fired two shots. Local Chinese officials refused to return the officers&#x27; guns, but Train and his companions were able to extricate themselves without further injury to anyone. The governor of Nanjing later apologized for the mob&#x27;s actions, returned the American officers&#x27; guns, and punished the ringleaders of the mob.

On 4 August 1906, Train died in Yantai (known to Westerners at the time as &quot;Chefoo&quot;), China, while still in command of the Asiatic Fleet. After a memorial ceremony, which Japanese Admiral Heihachiro Togo and other dignitaries attended at Yokohama, aboard Train″s flagship, the battleship , the steamer &quot;Empress of China&quot; carried his body out of the harbor under escort en route to Washington, D.C.

In early 1907, the Asiatic Fleet was abolished, and its ships and personnel became the First Squadron of the United States Pacific Fleet.

==1910–1937==

On 28 January 1910, the United States Asiatic Fleet was reestablished.

In December 1922 the U.S. Navy was restructured, with the U.S. Pacific Fleet and United States Atlantic Fleet combining to form a unified United States Fleet. However, the Asiatic Fleet remained a separate entity and was charged with defending the Philippines and Guam and with upholding the Open Door Policy in China.

Due to political unrest in China, the Asiatic Fleet assigned the gunboats and and destroyers to the Chinese ports of Amoy, Fuzhou, and Shantou in 1932 to protect American lives and property.

In late July 1937, the Asiatic Fleet&#x27;s commander-in-chief, Admiral Harry E. Yarnell, took his flagship, the heavy cruiser , to the Soviet Union&#x27;s main naval base in the Pacific, Vladivostok, along with four of the fleet&#x27;s destroyers. The visit, urged by the Soviet government, was an attempt to display solidarity between the Soviet Union and the United States in the face of increasingly aggressive Japanese behavior in China and along the border between the Soviet Union and the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo in Manchuria. The visit was unsuccessful in deterring further Japanese military operations in either area.

==Second Sino-Japanese War==

The Second Sino-Japanese War began on 7 July 1937 with the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. The United States was not a participant in the conflict, but it complicated the Asiatic Fleet&#x27;s mission as the fleet continued to maintain a presence and take action to protect American lives and property.

On 14 August 1937, &quot;Augusta&quot; with Yarnell aboard arrived at Shanghai from Qingdao just after the Battle of Shanghai began. That day, aircraft of the Republic of China Air Force mistakenly attacked the Royal Navy heavy cruiser in the harbor at Shanghai, but the bombs fell wide of &quot;Cumberland&quot; and did not damage her. Two bombs also fell close alongside &quot;Augusta&quot;, but there were no fatalities.

Japanese Special Naval Landing Force and Imperial Japanese Army forces landed on the coast of China at Shantou on 21 June 1939 and seized the city 12 hours later. At the time, 40 American citizens and 80 British nationals were ashore at Shantou and the Asiatic Fleet destroyer and the Royal Navy destroyer were in the harbor. The Japanese peremptorily ordered the two ships to leave, and when the demand reached Yarnell aboard &quot;Augusta&quot; — anchored to the north at Qinhuangdao — Yarnell requested instructions from the United States Government, which in turn granted U.S. military personnel in China the authority to make decisions on their own initiative, a response to the Japanese government&#x27;s habit of blaming any confrontation between Japanese and international forces in China on local Japanese commanders. With this authority in hand, Yarnell ordered &quot;Pillsbury&quot; to remain at Shantou, sent the destroyer there as a reinforcement, and informed his Japanese counterpart, the commander-in-chief of the China Area Fleet, Vice Admiral Koshirō Oikawa, that U.S. Navy ships would remain present anywhere where U.S. lives and property were in danger. &quot;Thanet&quot; also remained at Shantou, reinforced by the destroyer , and the Japanese did not take further action against any of the ships or against U.S. or British nationals at Shantou.

==World War II==
On 25 July 1939, Admiral Thomas C. Hart was appointed the commander-in-chief of the fleet. It was based at Cavite Naval Base and Olongapo Naval Station on Luzon, with its headquarters at the Marsman Building in Manila. On 22 July 1941, the Mariveles Naval Base was completed and the Asiatic Fleet began to use it as well.

Hart had permission to withdraw to the Indian Ocean, in the event of war with Japan, at his discretion.

Hart&#x27;s submarines, commanded by Commander, Submarines, Asiatic Fleet () Captain John E. Wilkes were six elderly S-class submarines (plus submarine tender ) and seven &quot;Porpoise&quot;s ( Submarine Squadron 5). In October 1941, 12 &quot;Salmon&quot;s or &quot;Sargo&quot;s—in Captain Stuart &quot;Sunshine&quot; Murray&#x27;s Submarine Division 15 and Captain Joseph A. Connolly&#x27;s Submarine Division 16, accompanied by the tender , were added. Walter E. &quot;Red&quot; Doyle was assigned as Wilkes&#x27; relief. Hart&#x27;s defensive plan relied heavily on his submarines, which were believed to be &quot;the most lethal arm of the insignificant Asiatic Fleet&quot;, to interdict the Japanese and whittle down their forces prior to a landing, and to disrupt attempts at reinforcing after the landings took place. When war began, Doyle&#x27;s inexperience in Asian waters meant Wilkes remained &quot;de facto&quot; .

Problems were encountered almost from the beginning. No defensive minefields were laid. Ineffective and unrealistic peacetime training, inadequate (or nonexistent) defensive plans, poor deployments, and defective torpedoes combined to make submarine operations in defense of the Philippines a foregone conclusion. No boats were placed in Lingayen Gulf, widely expected to be where the Japanese would land; in the event, several S boats, aggressively handled, scored successes there. Nor were any boats off ports of Japanese-held Taiwan, despite more than a week&#x27;s warning of impending hostilities. Successes were few in the early days of the war.

===Chinese detachment===
From 1901 to 1937, the United States maintained a strong military presence in China, to protect trade interests in the Far East, and to pursue a permanent alliance with the Chinese Republic, after long diplomatic difficulties with the Chinese Empire. The relationship between the U.S. and China was mostly on-again off-again, with periods of both cordial diplomatic relations accompanied by times of severed relations and violent anti-United States protests. China&#x27;s central government was relatively weak in comparison to the local influence of regional warlords. Armed renegade soldiers and boatmen prowled the Yangtze River ready to seize any vessel unable to defend itself.

The cooks, bakers, stewards, and mess attendants were exclusively Chinese aboard all gunboats and cruisers in Chinese waters. These men did not wear naval uniforms, but wore traditional Chinese civilian attire. They wore black satin slippers and a skullcap with a decorative button on top. The remainder of their clothing was made of white satin, consisting of long, rather loose pantaloons tied around the ankles and a short jacket fastened in front with frogs. Not considered part of the ships&#x27; crew were the Chinese girls who lived aboard sampans tied to the stern of each gunboat while moored at Shanghai. These sampans would shuttle members of the gunboat crew ashore upon request. The girls also painted the gunboat and polished brightwork in exchange for the ship&#x27;s garbage.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the Asiatic Fleet was based from China, and the image of the &quot;China Sailor&quot; developed, as many U.S. Navy members remained at postings in China for 10–12 years, then retired and continued to live there. The classic film &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; is a dramatization on the life of the China Sailors.

The U.S. military also created several awards and decorations to recognize those personnel who had performed duty in China. The China Service Medal and Yangtze Service Medal were all military medals which could be presented to those who had performed duty in China.

With the approach of World War II, the U.S. military in China was slowly withdrawn to protect other U.S. interests in the Pacific. With the rise of Communist China, there was no further U.S. military presence in mainland China, a status which continues to this day.

Early in November 1941, the Navy Department ordered Hart to withdraw the fleet&#x27;s Marines and gunboats stationed in China. Five of the gunboats were moved to Manila; was left with a skeleton crew as a radio base and was seized by the Japanese on 8 December; and was transferred to the Republic of China Navy under Lend-Lease.

The majority of the 4th Marine Regiment was stationed at Shanghai, and other detachments were at Beijing (Peking) and Tianjin (Tientsin). These troops were loaded onto two passenger liners, and , on 27–28 November (at either Shanghai or Qinghuangdao) and arrived in the Philippines on 30 November-1 December.

&quot;President Harrison&quot; returned to Qinghuangdao for the remaining Marines, but was captured by the Japanese on 7 December. Those Marines who had reached the Philippines were tasked with defending the naval stations, particularly Mariveles Naval Base.

===Minefields===

Manila Bay and Subic Bay had Army-operated minefields as well as naval mines. The Army minefields were operated by the Coast Artillery&#x27;s Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays. These minefields were designed to stop all vessels except submarines and shallow-draft surface craft. In Manila Bay, two controlled minefields were placed, one between Corregidor and La Monja Islands, and the other between Corregidor Island and the Bataan Peninsula east of Mariveles Bay, both operated from Corregidor. Also, in mid-1941 US Navy minefields of contact mines were laid between Mariveles Bay and La Monja Island, and between Corregidor and Carabao Islands. The Subic Bay minefield was laid in July 1941 and operated from Fort Wint, with the controlled Army mines in the ship channel, and naval mines to the sides of the channel.

===Aircraft of the Asiatic Fleet: 8 December 1941===
The aviation elements of the Asiatic Fleet comprised Patrol Wing 10 (Capt. Frank D. Wagner), with two patrol squadrons (VPs or PatRons), a utility unit, and the aviation units aboard the Fleet&#x27;s two cruisers and the large seaplane tender &quot;Langley&quot;.

Patrol Wing 10 had been commissioned in December 1940, and included Patrol Squadrons 101 (VP 101) and 102 (VP 102), each equipped with fourteen Consolidated PBY-4 Catalina flying boats. By Mid-1941, these 28 PBYs were numbered 1 through 14 for VP 101, 16 through 29 for VP 102. The Utility Unit included Grumman J2F Duck amphibians (1 J2F-2 and 4 J2F-4s), as well as five new Vought OS2U-2 Kingfisher floatplanes, delivered in the late summer. Also, a number of Curtiss SOC Seagull floatplanes were present. &quot;Houston&quot; carried four, &quot;Marblehead&quot; two, and &quot;Langley&quot; two or three, and two more were under repair or in storage at the Aircraft Overhaul Shop (Shop X 34) at Cavite Navy Yard.

As of 8 December, PBYs of Patrol Wing 10 patrolled the northwest and northeast of Luzon daily. These flights were based at either NAS Sangley Point, the Navy&#x27;s auxiliary seaplane station at Olongapo on Subic Bay, or seaplane tender &quot;Childs&quot; in Manila Bay. Trios of PBYs rotated down to the southern islands to base on &quot;William B. Preston&quot; at Malalag Bay on Davao Gulf, Mindanao. These patrols over the Philippine Sea to the east bordered with similar patrols flown by Royal Netherlands Naval Air Service flying boats based in the Netherlands East Indies. Seaplane tender &quot;Heron&quot;, with a detachment of four OS2U-2s from the Utility Unit, ran morning and evening patrols from Port Ciego, Balabac Island, over the strategically important Balabac Straits from 4–13 December.

Early in the morning of 8 December, &quot;Preston&quot; dispatched one aircraft on patrol and a short time later was attacked by aircraft from the small Japanese carrier , and her other two PBYs were sunk on the water.

Patrol Wing 10 was ordered south into the Netherlands East Indies on 12 December, when the collapsing defenses of the islands made further operations untenable. Within the first 90 days of the war, Patrol Wing 10 had fallen back to Perth, Western Australia, being reinforced by VP 22 from Hawaii but losing 41 of 44 PBYs to enemy action together with &quot;Langley&quot;. Patrol Wing 10 also lost all but one utility aircraft.

*PBY-4 (28. Added: 12 PBY-5s from VP 22 and 5 ex-Dutch Catalinas in January)
*J2F-2 or -4 (4)
*OS2U-2 (5)
*SOC-1 or -2 / SON (10–12)

===Asiatic Fleet components: 8 December 1941===
Asiatic Fleet Headquarters, ashore from mid-1941 at the Marsman Building on the Manila waterfront. The Fleet flagship, , was assigned to lead Task Force 5 (TF 5).

TF 4, Asiatic Fleet: Patrol Wing 10, seaplane tenders, and aviation resources.

TF 5, Asiatic Fleet: surface strike forces, including cruisers and Destroyer Squadron 29 (DesRon 29).

TF 6, Asiatic Fleet: submarines force, including all submarines, tenders and rescue ships.

TF 7, Asiatic Fleet: patrol force, including gunboats and .

4th Marine Regiment

Commandant 16th Naval District (COM16): The Cavite Navy Yard and all the shore establishment on Luzon, including the radio station, ammunition depot, hospital, Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron THREE, naval air station, mine depot, and similar facilities on Corregidor, at Mariveles, Bataan, and Olongpago, on Subic Bay.

The historic Yangtze Patrol was concluded in early December 1941. Of the five remaining gunboats, remained at Chongqing, was in reduced commission at Shanghai as a radio station for the U.S. State Department, and ComYangPat sailed in with &quot;Oahu&quot; for Manila, joined by .

===Battles fought by the Asiatic Fleet: early 1942===
As the Japanese sought sources of oil and minerals in the Netherlands East Indies and Borneo immediately following Pearl Harbor, the only fleet available to defend against them was the Asiatic Fleet. Outnumbered, outgunned, outmanned, the U.S. Navy, part of the ABDA (American, British, Dutch and Australian) force was unable to stop the Japanese, and could only attempt to slow them down.

====Battle of Balikpapan: 24 January 1942====
Catching a Japanese invasion fleet of 16 transports, a cruiser and several destroyers anchored in Balikpapan Bay, four U.S. &quot;four stacker&quot; destroyers—, , and —attacked at night using torpedoes and gunfire to sink four transports and one patrol craft. The Japanese believed that the attack came from submarines, and sent cruiser and destroyers out to sea in pursuit, leaving the transports unprotected. This was the first American surface action of the Pacific War and the first since the Spanish–American War. Although it significantly boosted morale, it had a negligible effect on Japanese operations.

====Battle of Flores Sea: 4 February 1942====
Encouraged by the success of the Balikpapan raid, an attempt was made to break up another invasion when word was received that a Japanese force was planning a landing at Makassar on Celebes Island.

Planning a night attack, the ABDA force had to sail some distance in open water in daylight. It was attacked by Japanese bombers which severely damaged the light cruiser and disabled turret No. 3 on the heavy cruiser . The force retreated to Tjilatjap, Java, having failed to prevent the Japanese landing.

====Battle of Badung Strait: 19/20 February 1942====
In an effort to break up another invasion, a small force of ABDA ships arrived on the island of Bali after the Japanese had made their landing and had retired, leaving only four Japanese destroyers on station. This attack failed. Three Japanese destroyers were damaged by gunfire, but the Dutch destroyer &quot;Piet Hein&quot; was sunk and a Dutch and American destroyer were damaged.

====Battle of Java Sea: 27 February 1942====
This was the largest battle fought in the area. The ABDA force of five cruisers and 11 destroyers, led by Dutch Admiral Doorman sailed against a Japanese force of seven cruisers and 25 destroyers. The Japanese had air cover, while ABDA did not (nor in any of the other battles described here). It was a rout, fought during the afternoon and evening, a running gun battle with Japanese planes constantly dropping flares to illuminate the ABDA ships. The Dutch lost two cruisers and a destroyer, the British two destroyers. One Japanese destroyer was damaged.

====Battle of Sunda Strait: 28 February 1942====
Retreating south to Batavia after the Battle of Java Sea the day before, the U.S. cruiser &quot;Houston&quot; and the Australian light cruiser —while heading at high speed for Sunda Strait, between Sumatra and Java—came upon a Japanese invasion force making a landing in Bantam (now Banten) Bay. In a confused night battle, both ships were sunk inside the Bay and not in Sunda Strait as is usually written. The two Allied ships fought bravely, but were overwhelmed by superior numbers. Four of the Japanese transports were torpedoed, most likely by their own side. The Japanese fired 87 torpedoes in the first half-hour of the battle.

====Battle of Java: 27 February 1942 to 3 March 1942====
Eight U.S. Navy Asiatic Fleet ships were sunk by enemy warships or airplanes during the Battle of Java when the Japanese invaded the island of Java. This was the final battle of the Dutch East Indies campaign. The seaplane tender (former aircraft carrier) was transporting 32 brand new Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighter planes from Australia to Java when she was sunk with 16 killed on 27 February. Hundreds more &quot;Langley&quot; survivors were killed when the other naval ships that rescued them were also sunk soon afterwards. The oil tanker was trapped and attacked by numerous Japanese ships and airplanes and was sunk on 1 March. 232 survivors were rescued and over 400 &quot;Pecos&quot; crew and survivors from &quot;Langley&quot; were left behind and drowned due to Japanese submarines threatening the U.S. ships that were rescuing the survivors. The destroyer was attached to an Allied fleet as the only U.S. vessel and was sunk in the Second Battle of the Java Sea. The destroyer was badly damaged and scuttled at Surabaya on 2 March 1942. On 3 March the submarine was sunk while attacking a Japanese convoy northwest of Surabaya. A major tragedy happened when three Asiatic Fleet warships (2 destroyers: and / 1 gunboat: ) were sunk on 1–3 March 1942 with no survivors while supporting the Allied forces during the Battle of Java. There were reports that there were prisoners-of-war from these 3 ships but none of them survived Japanese prisoner-of-war camps to tell their stories. No logs and no records of these three ships&#x27; final hours exist. The U.S. Navy didn&#x27;t even know what happened to the ships and fallen sailors until after World War II. From these 3 ships approximately 450 crewmen and officers were killed or died while prisoners-of-war.

====Half the U.S. Fleet lost====
Of the 40 surface vessels in the Asiatic Fleet on Pearl Harbor Day, 19 were sunk by 5 May 1942, the day General Wainwright surrendered to the Japanese at Corregidor in the Philippines. Most of the surviving ships safely reached Australia.

===Aftermath===
After the defeats in the defense of the Philippine Commonwealth and the Dutch East Indies, the remaining vessels retreated to Australia. They would fall under the command of the South West Pacific Area which would establish the 7th Fleet in 1943.

<text>The ABC 80 (Advanced BASIC Computer 80) is a home computer engineered by the Swedish corporation Dataindustrier AB (DIAB) and manufactured by Luxor in Motala, Sweden in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was introduced on the market in August 1978.

The ABC 80 was based on an earlier modular computer system from the same company and built around a Z80 and of ROM containing a fast semi-compiling BASIC interpreter. It had of RAM as main memory and a dedicated (included) tape recorder for program and data storage, but could also be expanded to handle disk drives as well as many other peripherals. The ROM could be extended in increments of 1 or 4 KB in order to handle such so called &quot;options&quot;. The monitor was a black and white TV set modified for the purpose, an obvious choice since Luxor also made TVs.

The ABC 80 was used in schools and offices around Scandinavia and parts of Europe. It was also used for industrial automation, scientific measurement and control systems. Like its successor, the ABC 800, the computer had an unusually quick and usable BASIC with excellent I/O response times, something that was often discovered when trying to switch to IBM PC-based personal computers. Due to its roots in an industrial computer system, the ABC 80 also had a flexible bus extension system with many (external) expansion and peripheral cards available for various purposes and applications, as well as high quality support and documentation.

ABC 80 was also manufactured on license as BRG ABC80 by &quot;Budapesti Rádiótechnikai Gyár&quot; in Hungary. It used the same keyboard, but the case was metal instead of plastic.

== Popularity ==
In addition to its widespread use in schools, offices and industrial applications, the initially also grasped a majority share of the rising personal computer market in Sweden, partly thanks to its office software in Swedish. The computer was robust and well engineered, mechanically and electrically, and its BASIC was fast enough that it could be used to write arcade games, without resorting to assembly language. However, despite such technical virtues, it couldn&#x27;t defend the home market against the dedicated gaming computers with color and sound that appeared in the early 1980s, neither against the cheap ultra simplistic home computers of the same era, even though a new low cost version was released that could use an ordinary TV instead of the dedicated monitor.

Luxor (and Facit) held on to its more professional markets for some more years with the ABC 800 series (also sold as Facit DTC). It had a more extensive BASIC, more memory, color, and a 512×240 graphics mode. From 1985 DIAB and Luxor also tried to compete against the IBM PC in the industrial and office markets with its high performance ABC 1600 and ABC 9000 series of computers based on DIABs real-time operating system called DNIX, but failed.

However, many ABC 80 and ABC 800 machines used in industrial or scientific applications were in use in their respective installations for many years to come, sometimes well into the late 1990s, despite no longer being produced.

== Performance ==
In order to see how the ABC 80 would compare to other contemporary personal computers, in 1982, the Swedish magazine &quot;MikroDatorn&quot; ran the Rugg/Feldman benchmarks of eight short BASIC programs (referred to as BM1~BM8) originally published by the American &quot;Kilobaud Microcomputing&quot; magazine and routinely used by the British magazine Personal Computer World for testing new machines. The result was that ABC 80&#x27;s interpreter turned out to be faster than most other BASICs used in popular machines, especially when integer variables are used, the results for some well known computers were as follows (times in seconds, lower is better):

The ABC 80 was up to as fast as the IBM PC using integers and up to as fast using floating point math. However, due to a sub-optimal exponentiation algorithm, the ABC 80 was slow on BM8 (which was fixed in the ABC 800). Compared to the ZX81, the ABC 80 was as fast on the simple loop of BM1 (with the ZX81 running in &quot;fast&quot; mode, i.e. without a continuous TV-picture).

== Sound ==
* Sine, noise, square wave. And mixing these.
* Quick decay, sine overlay, high or low tone, pulse tone control, on and off.

== Books ==
The circuitry in the ABC 80 is described in detail in the book &quot;Mikrodatorns ABC&quot; (&quot;The microcomputer ABC&quot;), by Gunnar Markesjö. It starts off with a course in digital electronics and microcomputer principles (assuming some general knowledge in electronics) and then presents a large number of block diagrams and partial circuit schematics, covering most of the computer, along with detailed explanations of how it works and why certain solutions were chosen.

<text>The Matra &amp; Hachette Ordinateur Alice is a home computer sold in France beginning in 1983. It was a clone of the TRS-80 MC-10, produced through a collaboration between Matra and Hachette in France and Tandy Corporation in the United States.

The Alice is distinguished by its bright red casing. Functionally, it is equivalent to the MC-10, with a Péritel (SCART) connector replacing the RF modulator for video output.

The Alice never became a popular computer in its home country. It tried to invade schools by being part of the country&#x27;s &quot;Plan Informatique pour Tous&quot; (&quot;Information technology for everyone&quot;) programme, but Thomson won the whole deal. Fewer than 50 games were released for the system.

The original model had 4 kB of RAM and used a Motorola 6847 video display generator chip, as used in the Dragon 32 and Acorn Atom among others.

At least three emulators for the system exist.

== Specifications ==
The machine is similar to the TRS-80 MC-10, with the following specifications: 
* CPU: Motorola 6803 at 0.89 MHz
* RAM: 4 KiB on-board, expandable to 20 KiB with a plug-in memory module
* ROM: 8 KiB (Microsoft BASIC)
* I/O Ports:
** RS-232C serial interface
** Cassette interface
** Péritel video output
** Expansion interface
* AZERTY keyboard layout
* Display: Motorola 6847, 32 x 16 or 64 x 32 with 8 colors, 160 x 125 with 4 colors (with expanded RAM) 
* Sound: 1 channel, 5 octaves

==Successor Models ==
Matra later released two successor models:
* The Matra Alice 32 released in 1983 shared the case style of the original, but was a different computer inside, due to using the EF9345 video chip. The Alice 32 had 8 kilobytes of main RAM, 8 kilobytes of dedicated video RAM, and 16 kilobytes ROM (the ROM incorporated an assembler). The CPU was clocked at 1 MHz. Higher resolution graphic modes included 320 X 192 with 16 colors from a 256 color palette.
* The Matra Alice 90 released in late 1984 was an upgrade to the Alice 32, which featured 32 kilobytes of RAM and a full-size case and keyboard. Its video cable included video-in, so EF9345 graphics could be overlaid onto the input video.
* The Matra Alice 8000 released in 1985 was a more powerful machine with two CPUs, a 6803 at 4,9152MHz and a Intel 8088. It had 64 kB of RAM.

The Thomson EF9345 video chip in the Matra Alice 32/90 was capable of displaying 8 colors, 128 alphanumeric characters, and 128 semi-graphic characters with a semigraphic mode and 40- and 80-column text modes. It could address up to 16 KiB of dedicated VRAM although the Alice 32 and 90 only included 8 KiB. The 32x16 semigraphic mode of the original Alice was simulated in software by the Alice 32/90 system ROM.

<text>Oranienburg () is a town in Brandenburg, Germany. It is the capital of the district of Oberhavel.

==Geography==
Oranienburg is a town located on the banks of the Havel river, 35 km north of the centre of Berlin.

===Division of the town===
Oranienburg consists of nine districts:

* Friedrichsthal
* Germendorf
* Lehnitz
* Malz
* Oranienburg
* Sachsenhausen
* Schmachtenhagen
* Wensickendorf
* Zehlendorf
==History==
Originally named Bötzow, the town of Oranienburg dates from the 12th century and was first mentioned in 1216. Margrave Albert the Bear (ruled 1157–1170) allegedly ordered the construction of a castle on the banks of the Havel. Around the castle stood a settlement of traders and craftsmen.

In 1646, Friedrich Wilhelm I of Brandenburg married Louise Henriette of Orange-Nassau (German: &quot;Oranien-Nassau&quot;). She was so attracted by the town of Bötzow that her husband presented the entire region to her. The princess ordered the construction of a new castle in the Dutch style and called it Oranienburg or Schloss Oranienburg. In 1653 the town of Bötzow was renamed Oranienburg.

Silvio Gesell, the founder of Freiwirtschaft (&quot;free economy&quot;), lived in Oranienburg between 1911 and 1915, publishing his magazine, &quot;Der Physiocrat&quot;. He returned to the town in 1927 and lived there until his death in 1930. The town remained a center of the &quot;free economy&quot; movement until the Nazi régime outlawed it in 1933, and many of Gesell&#x27;s followers ended up as prisoners in the town&#x27;s concentration camp.

The Oranienburg concentration camp (established in March 1933) was among the earliest of the Nazis concentration camps. In 1936, the Sachsenhausen concentration camp on the outskirts of Oranienburg replaced it; there 200,000 people were interned over the nine years that the Nazis operated it. Approximately 22,000 people died at the camp before the liberation of the camp by the Soviet Red Army in 1945. Thereafter the site reopened in August 1945 as &quot;Soviet Special Camp 7&quot;. A further 12,000 people (mostly Nazis not awaiting trial) died under the Soviets before the Special Camp closed in 1950. Their remains were not discovered until the 1990s.

Oranienburg became the center of Nazi Germany&#x27;s nuclear-energy project because it was the location of the Auergesellschaft Oranienburg Plant, Germany&#x27;s uranium production facility; the town also had an armaments hub, aircraft plant, and railway junction, all of military importance. According to military historian Antony Beevor, Stalin&#x27;s desire to acquire the nuclear facility motivated him to launch the Battle for Berlin of April–May 1945. It has been claimed that the pre-emptive destruction of these nuclear facilities by the USAAF Eighth Air Force on 15 March 1945 aimed to prevent them from falling into Soviet hands.

On 23 April 1945, during the Battle of Berlin, troops of the 1st Belorussian Front of the Red Army captured Oranienburg.

Between 1949 and 1990, Oranienburg was part of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).

Due to its heavy bombing, Oranienburg is the &quot;most dangerous town in Germany&quot;; it is the only town in Germany which pursues a systematic search for unexploded ordnance (UXO) based on postwar aerial photos and magnetic or radar underground measurements for metal. By 2017 about 200 had been disposed of, and 350 to 400 were estimated to remain. It is estimated that the search and disposal will continue throughout the rest of the century. In one case 12,000 residents had to be evacuated. The federal government does not finance the removal of foreign UXO.
==Public institutions==
The Zehlendorf transmission facility, a large facility for radio broadcasting in longwave, medium wave and FM-range, was located near Oranienburg, at Zehlendorf.

==Transport==
The town is served by the Berlin Northern Railway and provide a direct connection to Rostock.

<doc id="164117" wikidata="Q16038819" url="?curid=164117" title="Duration (music)">
<text>In music, duration is an amount of time or how long or short a note, phrase, section, or composition lasts. &quot;&quot;Duration&quot; is the length of time a pitch, or tone, is sounded.&quot; A note may last less than a second, while a symphony may last more than an hour. One of the fundamental features of rhythm, or encompassing rhythm, duration is also central to meter and musical form. Release plays an important part in determining the timbre of a musical instrument and is affected by articulation.

The concept of duration can be further broken down into those of beat and meter, where beat is seen as (usually, but certainly not always) a &#x27;constant&#x27;, and rhythm being longer, shorter or the same length as the beat. Pitch may even be considered a part of duration. In serial music the beginning of a note may be considered, or its duration may be (for example, is a 6 the note which begins at the sixth beat, or which lasts six beats?).

Durations, and their beginnings and endings, may be described as long, short, or taking a specific amount of time. Often duration is described according to terms borrowed from descriptions of pitch. As such, the &quot;duration complement&quot; is the amount of different durations used, the duration scale is an ordering (scale) of those durations from shortest to longest, the &quot;duration range&quot; is the difference in length between the shortest and longest, and the &quot;duration hierarchy&quot; is an ordering of those durations based on frequency of use.

Durational patterns are the foreground details projected against a background metric structure, which includes meter, tempo, and all rhythmic aspects which produce temporal regularity or structure. Duration patterns may be divided into rhythmic units and rhythmic gestures (Winold, 1975, chap. 3). But they may also be described using terms borrowed from the metrical feet of poetry: iamb (weak–strong), anapest (weak–weak–strong), trochee (strong–weak), dactyl (strong–weak–weak), and amphibrach (weak–strong–weak), which may overlap to explain ambiguity.

In 2018, he starred in the Roundabout Theatre Company&#x27;s revival of Sam Shepard&#x27;s play &quot;True West&quot;.

He has received numerous nominations including a total of four Academy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, and a Tony Award.

==Early life==
Hawke was born on November 6, 1970 to Leslie (née Green), a charity worker, and James Hawke, an insurance actuary. Hawke&#x27;s parents were high school sweethearts in Fort Worth, Texas, and married young, when Hawke&#x27;s mother was 17. Hawke was born a year later. Hawke&#x27;s parents were both students at the University of Texas at Austin at the time of his birth. They separated and later divorced in 1974, when he was four years old.

After the separation, Hawke was raised by his mother. The two relocated several times, before settling in New York City, where Hawke attended the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn Heights. Hawke&#x27;s mother remarried when he was 10 and the family moved to West Windsor Township, New Jersey. There, Hawke attended the public West Windsor Plainsboro High School (renamed to West Windsor-Plainsboro High School South in 1997). He later transferred to the Hun School of Princeton, a secondary boarding school, from which he graduated in 1988.

In high school, Hawke aspired to be a writer, but developed an interest in acting. He made his stage debut at age 13, in a production at the McCarter Theatre of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Saint Joan.&quot; He also performed in West Windsor-Plainsboro High School productions of &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot;. At the Hun School, he took acting classes at the McCarter Theatre, located on the Princeton campus. After graduation from high school, he studied acting at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, dropping out after he was cast in &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; (1989). He enrolled in New York University&#x27;s English program for two years, but dropped out to pursue other acting roles.

==Career==

===1980s: Early years and &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;===
Hawke obtained his mother&#x27;s permission to attend his first casting call at the age of 14, and secured his first film role in Joe Dante&#x27;s &quot;Explorers&quot; (1985), in which he played an alien-obsessed schoolboy alongside River Phoenix. The film was favorably reviewed but had poor box office results. This failure caused Hawke to quit acting for a brief period after the film&#x27;s release. Hawke later described the disappointment as difficult to bear at such a young age, adding, &quot;I would never recommend that a kid act.&quot;

In 1989, Hawke made his breakthrough appearance in Peter Weir&#x27;s &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;, playing one of the students taught by Robin Williams as a charismatic English teacher. The &quot;Variety&quot; reviewer noted &quot;Hawke, as the painfully shy Todd, gives a haunting performance.&quot; The film received considerable acclaim, winning the BAFTA Award for Best Film and an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. With revenue of $235 million worldwide, it remains Hawke&#x27;s most commercially successful movie to date. Hawke later described the opportunities he was offered as a result of the film&#x27;s success as critical to his decision to continue acting: 
While filming &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; he auditioned for what would be his next film, 1989&#x27;s comedy drama &quot;Dad&quot;, where he played Ted Danson&#x27;s son and Jack Lemmon&#x27;s grandson. Hawke&#x27;s next film, 1991&#x27;s &quot;White Fang&quot;, brought his first leading role. The film, an adaptation of Jack London&#x27;s novel of the same name, featured Hawke as Jack Conroy, a Yukon gold hunter who befriends a wolfdog (played by Jed). According to &quot;The Oregonian&quot;, &quot;Hawke does a good job as young Jack ... He makes Jack&#x27;s passion for White Fang real and keeps it from being ridiculous or overly sentimental.&quot; He appeared in Keith Gordon&#x27;s &quot;A Midnight Clear&quot; (1992), a well-received war film based on William Wharton&#x27;s novel of the same name. In the survival drama &quot;Alive&quot; (1993), adapted from Piers Paul Read&#x27;s , Hawke portrayed Nando Parrado, one of the survivors of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571, which crashed in the Andes.

===1990s: &quot;Reality Bites&quot;, and &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;===
Hawke&#x27;s next role was in the Generation X drama &quot;Reality Bites&quot; (1994), in which he played Troy Dyer, a slacker who mocks the ambitions of his girlfriend (played by Winona Ryder). Film critic Roger Ebert called Hawke&#x27;s performance convincing and noteworthy: &quot;Hawke captures all the right notes as the boorish Troy (and is so convincing it is worth noting that he has played quite different characters equally well in movies as different as &quot;Alive&quot; and &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;).&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted, &quot;Mr. Hawke&#x27;s subtle and strong performance makes it clear that Troy feels things too deeply to risk failure and admit he&#x27;s feeling anything at all.&quot;
The following year Hawke received critical acclaim for his performance in Richard Linklater&#x27;s 1995 drama &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;. The film follows a young American man (Hawke) and a young French woman (Julie Delpy), who meet on a train and disembark in Vienna, spending the night exploring the city and getting to know one another. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; praised Hawke&#x27;s and Delpy&#x27;s performances: &quot;[they] interact so gently and simply that you feel certain that they helped write the dialogue. Each of them seems to have something personal at stake in their performances.&quot;

Away from acting, Hawke directed the music video for the 1994 song &quot;Stay (I Missed You)&quot;, by singer-songwriter Lisa Loeb, who was a member of Hawke&#x27;s theater company at the time. &quot;Spin&quot; named Hawke and Loeb&#x27;s video as its video of the year in 1994. In a 2012 interview, Hawke said that the song, which was included in &quot;Reality Bites&quot;, is the only number-one popular song by an unsigned artist in the history of music.He published his first novel in 1996, &quot;The Hottest State&quot;, about a love affair between a young actor and a singer. Hawke said of the novel: 
The book met with a mixed reception. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said that Hawke &quot;opens himself to rough literary scrutiny in &quot;The Hottest State&quot;. If Hawke is serious ... he&#x27;d do well to work awhile in less exposed venues.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; thought Hawke did &quot;a fine job of showing what it&#x27;s like to be young and full of confusion&quot;, concluding that &quot;The Hottest State&quot; was ultimately &quot;a sweet love story&quot;.

In Andrew Niccol&#x27;s science fiction film &quot;Gattaca&quot; (1997), &quot;one of the more interesting scripts&quot; Hawke said he had read in &quot;a number of years&quot;, he played the role of a man who infiltrates a society of genetically perfect humans by assuming another man&#x27;s identity. Although &quot;Gattaca&quot; was not a success at the box office, it drew generally favorable reviews from critics. The &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; reviewer wrote that &quot;Hawke, building on the sympathetic-but-edgy presence that has served him well since his kid-actor days, is most impressive&quot;. In 1998, Hawke appeared alongside Gwyneth Paltrow and Robert De Niro in &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, a contemporary film adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel of the same name, directed by Alfonso Cuarón. During the same year, Hawke collaborated with Linklater again on &quot;The Newton Boys&quot;, based on the true story of the Newton Gang. Critical reviews for each film were mixed. The following year, Hawke starred in &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars&quot;, based on David Guterson&#x27;s novel of the same title. Set in the Pacific Northwest and featuring a love affair between a European-American man and Japanese-American woman, the film met with an unenthusiastic reception; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; noted, &quot;Hawke scrunches himself into such a dark knot that we have no idea who Ishmael is or why he acts as he does.&quot;

===2000s: &quot;Training Day&quot;, and &quot;Before Sunset&quot;===
Hawke&#x27;s next film role was in Michael Almereyda&#x27;s 2000 film &quot;Hamlet&quot;, in which he played the title character. The film transposed the famous William Shakespeare play to contemporary New York City, a technique Hawke felt made the play more &quot;accessible and vital&quot;. &quot;Salon&quot; reviewer wrote: &quot;Hawke certainly isn&#x27;t the greatest Hamlet of living memory ... but his performance reinforces Hamlet&#x27;s place as Shakespeare&#x27;s greatest character. And in that sense, he more than holds his own in the long line of actors who&#x27;ve played the part.&quot; In 2001, Hawke appeared in two more Linklater movies: &quot;Waking Life&quot; and &quot;Tape&quot;, both critically praised. In the animated &quot;Waking Life&quot;, he shared a single scene with former co-star Delpy continuing conversations begun in &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;. The real-time drama &quot;Tape&quot;, based on a play by Stephen Belber, takes place entirely in a single motel room with three characters played by Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, and Uma Thurman. Hawke regarded &quot;Tape&quot; as his &quot;first adult performance&quot;, a performance commended by Ebert for showing &quot;both physical and verbal acting mastery&quot;.

Hawke&#x27;s next role, and one for which he received substantial critical acclaim, came in &quot;Training Day&quot; (2001). Hawke played rookie cop Jake Hoyt, alongside Denzel Washington, as one of a pair of narcotics detectives from the Los Angeles Police Department spending 24 hours in the gang neighborhoods of South Los Angeles. The film was a box office hit, taking $104 million worldwide, and garnered generally favorable reviews. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that &quot;Hawke adds feisty and cunning flourishes to his role that allow him to respectably hold his own under formidable circumstances.&quot; Paul Clinton of CNN reported that Hawke&#x27;s performance was &quot;totally believable as a doe-eyed rookie going toe-to-toe with a legend [Washington]&quot;. Hawke himself described &quot;Training Day&quot; as his &quot;best experience in Hollywood&quot;. His performance earned him Screen Actors Guild and Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor.
Hawke pursued a number of projects away from acting throughout the early 2000s. He made his directorial debut with &quot;Chelsea Walls&quot; (2002), an independent drama about five struggling artists living in the famed Chelsea Hotel in New York City. The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. A second novel, 2002&#x27;s &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot;, was better received and made the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. The tale of an AWOL soldier and his pregnant girlfriend, the novel attracted critical praise. &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;sharply and poignantly written ... makes for an intense one-sitting read&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that in the book Hawke displayed &quot;a novelist&#x27;s innate gifts ... a sharp eye, a fluid storytelling voice and the imagination to create complicated individuals&quot;, but was &quot;weaker at narrative tricks that can be taught&quot;. In 2003, Hawke made a television appearance, guest starring in the second season of the television series &quot;Alias&quot;, where he portrayed a mysterious CIA agent.

In 2004, Hawke returned to film, starring in two features, &quot;Taking Lives&quot; and &quot;Before Sunset&quot;. Upon release, &quot;Taking Lives&quot; received broadly negative reviews, but Hawke&#x27;s performance was favored by critics, with the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; noting that he &quot;plays a complex character persuasively.&quot; &quot;Before Sunset&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; (1995) co-written by Hawke, Linklater, and Delpy, was much more successful. The &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; wrote that the three collaborators &quot;keep Jesse and Celine iridescent and fresh, one of the most delightful and moving of all romantic movie couples.&quot; Hawke called it one of his favorite movies, a &quot;romance for realists&quot;. &quot;Before Sunset&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, Hawke&#x27;s first screenwriting Oscar nomination.

Hawke starred in the 2005 action thriller &quot;Assault on Precinct 13&quot;, a loose remake of John Carpenter&#x27;s 1976 film of the same title, with an updated plot. The film received ambivalent reviews; some critics praised the dark swift feel of the film, while others compared it unfavorably to John Carpenter&#x27;s original. Hawke also appeared that year in the political crime thriller &quot;Lord of War&quot;, playing an Interpol agent chasing an arms dealer played by Nicolas Cage. In 2006, Hawke was cast in a supporting role in &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot;, directed by Richard Linklater based on Eric Schlosser&#x27;s best-selling 2001 book. The same year, Hawke directed his second feature, &quot;The Hottest State&quot;, based on his eponymous 1996 novel. The film was released in August 2007 to a tepid reception.

In 2007, Hawke starred alongside Philip Seymour Hoffman, Marisa Tomei, and Albert Finney in the crime drama &quot;Before the Devil Knows You&#x27;re Dead&quot;. The final work of Sidney Lumet, the film received critical acclaim. &quot;USA Today&quot; called it &quot;highly entertaining&quot;, describing Hawke and Hoffman&#x27;s performances as excellent. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised Hawke&#x27;s performance, noting that he &quot;digs deep to create a haunting portrayal of loss&quot;. The following year, Hawke starred with Mark Ruffalo in the crime drama &quot;What Doesn&#x27;t Kill You&quot;. Despite the favorable reception, the film was not given a proper theatrical release due to the bankruptcy of its distributor. In 2009, Hawke appeared in two features: &quot;New York, I Love You&quot;, a romance movie comprising 12 short films, and &quot;Staten Island&quot;, a crime drama co-starring Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio and Seymour Cassel.

===2010s: &quot;Before Midnight&quot;, &quot;Boyhood&quot;, &quot;First Reformed&quot;===
In 2010, Hawke starred as a vampire hematologist in the science fiction horror film &quot;Daybreakers&quot;. Filmed in Australia with the Spierig brothers, the feature received reasonable reviews, and earned US$51 million worldwide. His next role was in Antoine Fuqua&#x27;s &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s Finest&quot; as a corrupt narcotics officer. The film opened in March to a mediocre reception, yet his performance was well received, with the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; concluding, &quot;Hawke—continuing an evolution toward stronger, more intense acting than anyone might&#x27;ve predicted from him 20 years ago—drives the movie.&quot; In the 2011 television adaptation of Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, Hawke played the role of Starbuck, the first officer to William Hurt&#x27;s Captain Ahab. He then starred opposite Kristin Scott Thomas in Paweł Pawlikowski&#x27;s &quot;The Woman in the Fifth&quot;, a &quot;lush puzzler&quot; about an American novelist struggling to rebuild his life in Paris.

In 2012, Hawke entered the horror genre for the first time, by playing a true crime writer in Scott Derrickson&#x27;s &quot;Sinister&quot;, which grossed US$87 million at the worldwide box office—the film was the first in a series of highly profitable films for Hawke after the start of the new decade. In the week prior to the US opening of &quot;Sinister&quot;, Hawke explained that he was previously turned off by horror because good acting is not always required for success; however, the producer of &quot;Sinister&quot;, Jason Blum, who formerly ran a theater company with Hawke, made the offer to the actor based on the character and director.


During 2013, Hawke starred in three films of different genres. &quot;Before Midnight&quot;, the third installment of the &quot;Before&quot; series, reunited Hawke with Delpy and Linklater. Like its predecessors, the film garnered a considerable degree of critical acclaim; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that &quot;one of the great movie romances of the modern era achieves its richest and fullest expression in &quot;Before Midnight&quot;,&quot; and called the scene in the hotel room &quot;one for the actors&#x27; handbook.&quot; The film earned co-writers Hawke, Linklater, and Delpy another Academy Award nomination, for Best Adapted Screenplay.

Hawke then starred in the horror-thriller &quot;The Purge&quot;, about an American future where crime is legal for one night of the year. Despite mixed reviews, the film topped the weekend box office with a US$34 million debut, the biggest opening of Hawke&#x27;s career. Hawke&#x27;s third film of 2013 was the action thriller &quot;Getaway&quot;, which was both critically and commercially unsuccessful.

The release of Linklater&#x27;s &quot;Boyhood&quot;, a film shot over the course of 12 years, occurred in mid-2014. It follows the life of an American boy from age 6 to 18, with Hawke playing the protagonist&#x27;s father. The film became the best-reviewed film of 2014, and was named &quot;Best Film&quot; of the year by numerous critics associations. Hawke said in an interview that the attention was a surprise to him. When he first became involved with Linklater&#x27;s project, it did not feel like a &quot;proper movie,&quot; and was like a &quot;radical &#x27;60s film experiment or something&quot;. At the following awards season, the film was nominated for Academy Award for Best Picture, while winning Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama and BAFTA Award for Best Film. It also earned Hawke multiple awards nominations, including the Academy, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and SAG Award for Best Supporting Actor.

Hawke next worked with the Spierig brothers again on the science fiction thriller &quot;Predestination&quot;, in which Hawke plays a time-traveling agent on his final assignment. Following its premiere at the 2014 SXSW Film Festival, the film was released in Australia in August 2014 and in the US in January 2015. The film received largely positive reviews and was nominated for the AACTA Award for Best Film. He then reunited with his &quot;Gattaca&quot; director Andrew Niccol for &quot;Good Kill&quot;. In this modern war film, Hawke played a drone pilot with a troubled conscience, which led to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; calling it his &quot;best screen role in years.&quot; Also in 2014, Hawke appeared in the movie &quot;Cymbeline&quot; which reunited him with his &quot;Assault on Precinct 13&quot; co-star John Leguizamo.

In September 2014, Hawke&#x27;s documentary debut, &quot;&quot;, screened at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), winning second runner-up for TIFF&#x27;s People&#x27;s Choice Award for Best Documentary. Conceived after a dinner party at which both Hawke and Bernstein were present, the film is a profile of classical musician Seymour Bernstein, who explained that, even though he is typically a very private person, he was unable to decline Hawke&#x27;s directorial request because he is &quot;so endearing&quot;. Bernstein and Hawke developed a friendship through the filming process, and the classical pianist performed for one of Hawke&#x27;s theater groups. The film was released in March 2015 to a warm reception; the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reviewer described it as &quot;quietly moving, indefinitely deep&quot;.

Hawke had two films premiered at the 2015 TIFF, both garnering favorable reviews. In Robert Budreau&#x27;s drama film &quot;Born to Be Blue&quot;, he played the role of jazz musician Chet Baker. The film is set in the late 1960s and focuses on the musician&#x27;s turbulent career comeback plagued by heroin addiction. His portrayal of Baker was well received; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted that &quot;Everything that makes Ethan Hawke an extraordinary actor — his energy, his empathy, his fearless, vanity-free eagerness to explore the deeper recesses of a character — is on view in &quot;Born to Be Blue&quot;.&quot; In Rebecca Miller&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Plan&quot;, Hawke starred as an anthropologist and aspiring novelist alongside Greta Gerwig and Julianne Moore. His other films that year included the coming-of-age drama &quot;Ten Thousand Saints&quot; and the psychological thriller &quot;Regression&quot; opposite Emma Watson. In November 2015, Hawke published his third novel, &quot;Rules for a Knight&quot;, in the form of a letter from a father to his four children about the moral values in life.

In 2016, Hawke starred in Ti West&#x27;s western film &quot;In a Valley of Violence&quot;, in which he played a drifter seeking revenge in a small town controlled by its Marshal (John Travolta). He then portrayed two unpleasant characters in a row, first as the abusive father of a talented young baseball player in &quot;The Phenom&quot;, then as the harsh husband of Maud Lewis (played by Sally Hawkins) in &quot;Maudie&quot;. While some critics praised his unexpected turns, others felt that Hawke was &quot;miscast&quot; as a cruel figure. He reunited with &quot;Training Day&quot; director Antoine Fuqua and actor Denzel Washington for &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (2016), a remake of the 1960 western film of the same name. On June 7, his fourth book, &quot;Indeh: A Story of the Apache Wars&quot;, a graphic novel he wrote with artist Greg Ruth, was released.

In 2017, Hawke appeared in a cameo role in the science fiction film &quot;Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets&quot; by Luc Besson; and starred in Paul Schrader&#x27;s drama film &quot;First Reformed&quot;, as a former military chaplain tortured by the loss of his son he encouraged to enlist in the armed forces, and focused on impending cataclysmic climate change. The film premiered at the 2017 Venice Film Festival to a positive reception.

In 2018, Hawke had two films premiere at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival. In &quot;Juliet, Naked&quot;, a romantic comedy adapted from Nick Hornby&#x27;s novel of the same name, he appeared as an obscure rock musician whose eponymous album set the plot in motion. His third feature film, &quot;Blaze&quot;, based on the life of little-known country musician Blaze Foley, was selected in the festival&#x27;s main competition section. In addition, Hawke starred in Budreau&#x27;s crime thriller &quot;Stockholm&quot; which premiered at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival. Hawke was in the 2019 western drama &quot;The Kid&quot;, directed by Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio.

===2020s: Continued work ===
In 2019, Hawke and Jason Blum adapted the book &quot;The Good Lord Bird&quot; into the miniseries based on the same name which premiered on October 4, 2020, on Showtime. 

He stars as abolitionist John Brown alongside Daveed Diggs, Ellar Coltrane, and includes an appearance of Maya Hawke. In the 2020 biographical film &quot;Tesla&quot;, he plays the title character, inventor and engineer Nikola Tesla.

His third novel, &quot;A Bright Ray of Darkness&quot;, was published in February 2021. In 2022, Hawke starred as the primary villain Arthur Harrow in the Disney+ streaming series &quot;Moon Knight&quot;, produced by Marvel Studios, and as serial killer of children The Grabber in the Blumhouse feature, &quot;The Black Phone&quot;. The latter marked Hawke&#x27;s ninth collaboration with Blumhouse. Also that year, he appeared in Robert Eggers&#x27; &quot;The Northman&quot;, a 10th-century Viking epic which was filmed in Ireland, alongside Nicole Kidman, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Willem Dafoe.

In 2022, Hawke&#x27;s six-part biographical documentary on Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, &quot;The Last Movie Stars,&quot; was broadcast on HBO Max. Hawke also voiced Bruce Wayne/Batman in the animated children&#x27;s television series &quot;Batwheels&quot;.

===Stage career===
Hawke has described theater as his &quot;first love&quot;, a place where he is &quot;free to be more creative&quot;. Hawke made his Broadway debut in 1992, portraying the playwright Konstantin Treplev in Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot; at the Lyceum Theater in Manhattan. The following year Hawke was a co-founder and the artistic director of Malaparte, a Manhattan theater company, which survived until 2000. Outside the New York stage, Hawke made an appearance in a 1995 production of Sam Shepard&#x27;s &quot;Buried Child&quot;, directed by Gary Sinise at the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago. In 1999, he starred as Kilroy in the Tennessee Williams play &quot;Camino Real&quot; at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts.

Hawke returned to Broadway in Jack O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s 2003 production of &quot;Henry IV&quot;, playing Henry Percy (Hotspur). &quot;New York&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;Ethan Hawke&#x27;s Hotspur ... is a compelling, ardent creation.&quot; Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Hawke&#x27;s interpretation of Hotspur might be &quot;too contemporary for some tastes,&quot; but allowed &quot;great fun to watch as he fumes and fulminates.&quot; In 2005, Hawke starred in the Off-Broadway revival of David Rabe&#x27;s dark comedy &quot;Hurlyburly&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Brantley praised Hawke&#x27;s performance as the central character Eddie, reporting that &quot;he captures with merciless precision the sense of a sharp mind turning flaccid&quot;. The performance earned Hawke a Lucille Lortel Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor.
From November 2006 to May 2007, Hawke starred as Mikhail Bakunin in Tom Stoppard&#x27;s trilogy play &quot;The Coast of Utopia&quot;, an eight-hour-long production at the Lincoln Center Theater in New York. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; complimented Hawke&#x27;s take on Bakunin, writing: &quot;Ethan Hawke buzzes in and out as Bakunin, a strangely appealing enthusiast on his way to becoming a famous anarchist.&quot; The performance earned Hawke his first Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Play. In November 2007, he directed &quot;Things We Want&quot;, a two-act play by Jonathan Marc Sherman, for the artist-driven Off-Broadway company The New Group. The play has four characters played by Paul Dano, Peter Dinklage, Josh Hamilton, and Zoe Kazan. &quot;New York&quot; magazine praised Hawke&#x27;s &quot;understated direction&quot;, particularly his ability to &quot;steer a gifted cast away from the histrionics&quot;.

The following year, Hawke received the Michael Mendelson Award for Outstanding Commitment to the Theater. In his acceptance speech, Hawke said &quot;I don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;re honoring me. I think the real reason they are honoring me is to help raise money for the theater company. Whenever the economy gets hit hard, one of the first thing to go is people&#x27;s giving, and last on that list of things people give to is the arts because they feel it&#x27;s not essential. I guess I&#x27;m here to remind people that the arts are essential to our mental health as a country.&quot;

In 2009, Hawke appeared in two plays under British director Sam Mendes: as Trofimov in Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; and as Autolycus in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;. The two productions, launched in New York as part of the Bridge Project, went on an eight-month tour in six countries. &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; won a mixed review from the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, which wrote &quot;Ethan Hawke ... fits the image of the &#x27;mangy&#x27; student Trofimov, but one wishes he didn&#x27;t speak with a perennial frog in his throat.&quot; Hawke&#x27;s performance in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; was better received, earning him a Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play.

In January 2010, Hawke directed his second play, &quot;A Lie of the Mind&quot;, by Sam Shepard on the New York stage. It was the first major Off-Broadway revival of the play since its 1985 premiere. Hawke said that he was drawn to the play&#x27;s take on &quot;the nature of reality&quot;, and its &quot;weird juxtaposition of humor and mysticism&quot;. In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Ben Brantley noted the production&#x27;s &quot;scary, splendid clarity&quot;, and praised Hawke for eliciting a performance that &quot;connoisseurs of precision acting will be savoring for years to come&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commented that although &quot;A Lie of the Mind&quot; &quot;wobbles a bit in its late stages&quot;, Hawke&#x27;s &quot;hearty&quot; revival managed to &quot;resurrect the spellbinding uneasiness of the original&quot;. The production garnered five Lucille Lortel Award nominations including Outstanding Revival, and earned Hawke a Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Director of a Play.

Hawke next starred in the Off-Broadway premiere of a new play, Tommy Nohilly&#x27;s &quot;Blood from a Stone&quot;, from December 2010 to February 2011. The play was not a critical success, but Hawke&#x27;s portrayal of the central character Travis earned positive feedback; &quot;The New York Times&quot; said he was &quot;remarkably good at communicating the buried sensitivity beneath Travis&#x27;s veneer of wary resignation.&quot; A contributor from the &quot;New York Post&quot; noted it was Hawke&#x27;s &quot;best performance in years&quot;. Hawke won an Obie Award for his role in &quot;Blood from a Stone&quot;. The following year Hawke played the title role in Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Ivanov&quot; at the Classic Stage Company. In early 2013, he starred in and directed a new play &quot;Clive&quot;, inspired by Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Baal&quot; and written by Jonathan Marc Sherman. Later that year, he played the title role in a Broadway production of &quot;Macbeth&quot; at the Lincoln Center Theater, but his performance failed to win over the critics, with the &quot;New York Post&quot; calling it &quot;underwhelming&quot; for showing untimely restraint in a flashy production.

In 2019, Hawke returned to Broadway in the revival of Sam Shepard&#x27;s &quot;True West&quot;, co-starring Paul Dano. The show was met with critical acclaim. It received the Critic&#x27;s Pick from &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The show&#x27;s previews began on December 27, 2018, and officially opened January 24, 2019, closing on March 17, 2019. Hawke is a member of the LAByrinth theatre company.

==Personal life==
Hawke lives in Boerum Hill, a Brooklyn neighborhood in New York City, and owns a small island in Nova Scotia, Canada, where he occasionally lives during the summer. He is a second cousin twice-removed of Tennessee Williams on his father&#x27;s side. Hawke&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Howard Lemuel Green, served five terms in the Texas Legislature (1957–67), served as the elected Tarrant County Judge in Texas from 1967 to 1975, and was also a minor-league baseball commissioner. During his bachelor days, Hawke dated Kim Tannahill, a nanny who worked for Bruce Willis and Demi Moore.

===Family===

On May 1, 1998, Hawke married actress Uma Thurman, whom he had met on the set of &quot;Gattaca&quot; in 1996. They have two children, Maya (b. 1998) and Levon (b. 2002). The couple separated in 2003 amid allegations of Hawke&#x27;s infidelity, and filed for divorce the following year. The divorce was finalized in August 2005.

In 2008, Hawke married Ryan Shawhughes, who had briefly worked as a nanny to his and Thurman&#x27;s children before graduating from Columbia University. Dismissing speculation about their relationship, Hawke said, &quot;my [first] marriage disintegrated due to many pressures, none of which were remotely connected to Ryan.&quot; They have two daughters, Clementine and Indiana.

===Beliefs===
Hawke identifies as a feminist and has criticized &quot;the movie business [being] such a boys&#x27; club.&quot; He has also spoken in support of Colin Kaepernick and individual rights.

Hawke is an Episcopalian. He joked on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;: &quot;My mother always said we’re wannabe Catholics. We just didn’t want to do the hard work and we want to be able to get divorced.&quot; Hawke directed &quot;Wildcat&quot;, a biopic about Flannery O&#x27;Connor, a devout Catholic, which starred his daughter, Maya.

===Philanthropy===
Hawke has served as a co-chair of the New York Public Library&#x27;s Young Lions Committee, one of New York&#x27;s major philanthropic boards. In 2001, Hawke co-founded the Young Lions Fiction Award, an annual prize for achievements in fiction by writers under 35. In November 2010, he was honored as a Library Lion by the New York Public Library. In May 2016, Hawke joined the library&#x27;s board of trustees.

===Political views===
Hawke supports the Democratic Party, and supported Bill Bradley, John Kerry, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton for President of the United States in 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2016, respectively. He is also a supporter of gay rights; in March 2011, he and his wife released a video supporting same-sex marriage in New York.

In an October 2012 interview, Hawke said that he prefers great art to politics, explaining that his preference shows &quot;how little&quot; he cares about the latter; &quot;I think about the first people of our generation to do great art. I see Michael Chabon write a great book; when I see Philip Seymour Hoffman do &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; last year—I see people of my generation being fully realized in their work, and I find that really kind of exciting. But politics? I don&#x27;t know. Paul Ryan is certainly not my man.&quot;

Hawke was critical of Donald Trump, criticizing him for his Make America Great Again slogan, and for threatening to put Hillary Clinton in jail. According to Hawke, members of his family voted for Trump.

<text>Sankt Pölten (; Central Bavarian: &quot;St. Pödn&quot;), mostly abbreviated to the official name St. Pölten, is the capital and largest city of the State of Lower Austria in northeast Austria, with 55,538 inhabitants as of 1 January 2020. St. Pölten is a city with its own statute (or &quot;Statutarstadt&quot;) and therefore it is both a municipality and a district in the &quot;Mostviertel&quot;. Due to its cultural status, it has recently enjoyed an increase of visitors passing through Sankt Pölten on their way to Vienna.

==Geography==
The city lies on the Traisen river and is located north of the Alps and south of the Wachau. It is part of the &quot;Mostviertel&quot;, the southwest region of Lower Austria.

===Subdistricts===

St Pölten is divided into the following subdistricts: Altmannsdorf, Dörfl at Ochsenburg, Eggendorf, Ganzendorf, Hafing, Harland, Hart, Kreisberg, Matzersdorf, Mühlgang, Nadelbach, Oberradlberg, Oberwagram, Oberzwischenbrunn, Ochsenburg, Pengersdorf, Pottenbrunn, Pummersdorf, Ragelsdorf, Ratzersdorf at the Traisen, Reitzersdorf, Schwadorf, Spratzern, St Georgen on the Steinfelde, St Pölten, Stattersdorf, Steinfeld, Teufelhof, Unterradlberg, Unterwagram, Unterzwischenbrunn, Viehofen, Völtendorf, Waitzendorf, Wasserburg, Weitern, Wetzersdorf, Windpassing, Witzendorf, Wolfenberg, Wörth and Zwerndorf.

=== Transport ===
The city&#x27;s main railway station, St. Pölten Hauptbahnhof, is located directly on the West railway of the ÖBB and is also the terminus of the Leobersdorfer Railway, the Mariazellerbahn, the regional railway to Tulln and the regional railway to Krems. It is at the intersection of the Western Motorway A1 and the Kremser Speedway S33, and is traversed by the Vienna Road B1. St Pölten is a junction of the &quot;Wieselbus&quot; bus lines, which provides radial connections between the capital and the different regions of Lower Austria.

====In the city====
Between 1911 and 1976, a tramline operated in St Pölten. Today, a network of eleven bus lines operates at regular intervals within the city. Every summer, a free tourist train in the city centre connects the ancient parts of the city with the government district.

=== Climate ===

== History ==
The oldest part of the city is built on the site of the ancient Roman city of &quot;Aelium Cetium&quot; that existed between the 2nd and the 4th century AD. A Benedictine monastery was founded in 791; in the year 799, it was called &quot;Treisma&quot;. St Pölten did not become a town until 1050, and officially became a city in 1169. Until 1494, St Pölten was part of the diocese of Passau, and then became the property of the state. In 1081 it hosted the Augustinian &quot;Chorherren&quot;, and in 1784 their &quot;Kollegiatsstift&quot; closed. Since 1785, this building has hosted the cathedral of St Pölten. The city replaced Vienna as the capital of Lower Austria with a resolution by the Lower Austrian parliament on 10 July 1986. The Lower Austrian government has been hosted in St Pölten since 1997.

The name &quot;Sankt Pölten&quot; is derived from St. Hippolytus of Rome (a martyred early Church Father). The city was renamed to &quot;Sankt Hippolyt&quot;, then clipped to &quot;St Polyt&quot;, and finally &quot;St Pölten&quot;.

<doc id="164124" wikidata="Q489806" url="?curid=164124" title="Melk">
<text>Melk (; older spelling: ) is a city in the Austrian state of Lower Austria, next to the Wachau valley along the Danube. Melk has a population of 5,257 (as of 2012). It is best known as the site of a massive baroque Benedictine monastery named Melk Abbey.

The town is first mentioned as in 831 in a donation of Louis the German; the name is from a Slavic word for &#x27;border.&#x27; The area around Melk was given to Leopold I, Margrave of Austria, in the year 976 to serve as a buffer between the Magyars to east and Bavaria to the west. In 996 mention was first made of an area known as , which is the origin of the word (German for Austria). The bluff which holds the current monastery held a Babenberger castle until the site was given to Benedictine monks from nearby Lambach by Leopold II, in 1089. Melk received market rights in 1227 and became a municipality in 1898. In a very small area, Melk presents a great deal of architectural variety from many centuries.

== Notable sights==
The Forsthaus, which accommodates the city archives and the tourist information office, is the starting point of the tour. Beside the Forsthaus the Zaglauergasse meets with the Wiener Straße. The Zaglauergasse is restricted on one side by remnants of the ancient city wall. At this junction one could find the Wiener Tor (Vienna Gate) until 1874. It has been, along with the Linzer Tor (Linz Gate) on the other side of the city, one of the two entrances to Melk throughout the centuries.

After several metres, the Wiener Straße opens to the affectionately restored Rathausplatz, which got its name from the Rathaus built in 1575. The facade of the town hall was redesigned 150 years ago and the highly elaborate entrance door, made of wood and copper, is the town hall&#x27;s most outstanding feature.

To its left is the former Lebzelterhaus, which dates back to 1657 and which nowadays is a pharmacy. To the right is a secular building from the Middle Ages. The Kolomanbrunnen market fountain, which is a gift from the abbey to the city, is in the centre of the Rathausplatz. On the top of the fountain the statue of St. Koloman can be seen.

The old bread store with its tiny towers is about 400 years old and is still covered with the original shingle roof. Behind the old bread store extends the oldest lane in Melk, the Sterngasse, which used to be the main street of the town. The interesting wall paintings on the houses indicate what they used to be. Some other houses contain fascinating courtyards.

The hidden Haus am Stein (&#x27;house at the rock&#x27;) is the oldest building of Melk, built during the 15th century. Its facade is covered by a protected ancient vine. At the arm of the Danube river, parts of the former city walls and the Round Tower can be recognised. Following the Nibelungenlände and passing the Salzhof, the visitor reaches the Schiffsmeisterhaus with its high water level marks on the facade. The Danube reached 15.8 metres above the usual water level in 1501.

The Haus auf dem Stein (&#x27;house on the rock&#x27;) was built less than 50 years after this high water disaster. It was used as an atelier by the Austrian painter Walter Prinzl. The counterpart of the Wiener Tor, the Linzer Tor, was located at the end of the Linzer Straße. Neither gate exists anymore, but historical illustrations can be found at the city archives. At the corner of the Stadtgraben (moat), there is the defensive tower, where parts of it are still in original condition.

The Old Post Office is at the end of the moat, which was built in 1792. Its facade is decorated with a beautiful relief created at the end of the Baroque period. The Old Post Office is now used as a convention centre. The church court is dominated by the Gothic Pfarrkirche (parish church). Designed in the late Gothic period and embedded in the northern facade is the Kalvarienberggruppe, a significant sculpture. Before the main road connects to the Rathausplatz, a tablet commemorates the great Austrian composer Anton Bruckner.

About south of the town is the renowned Renaissance castle Schallaburg.

During World War II, a subcamp of Mauthausen concentration camp was located here.
Today the former crematorium is a museum while the rest of the camp was part of what is now the Birago barracks of the Austrian Army.

In 1950, the first official women&#x27;s Austrian Chess Championship was held in Melk, the winner of which was Salome Reischer.

<doc id="164126" wikidata="Q2206565" url="?curid=164126" title="Strategic lawsuit against public participation">
<text>Strategic lawsuits against public participation (also known as SLAPP suits or intimidation lawsuits), or strategic litigation against public participation, are lawsuits intended to censor, intimidate, and silence critics by burdening them with the cost of a legal defense until they abandon their criticism or opposition.

In a typical SLAPP, the plaintiff does not normally expect to win the lawsuit. The plaintiff&#x27;s goals are accomplished if the defendant succumbs to fear, intimidation, mounting legal costs, or simple exhaustion and abandons the criticism. In some cases, particularly in the context of investigative journalism, repeated frivolous litigation against a defendant may raise the cost of directors and officers and other liability insurance for that party, interfering with an organization&#x27;s ability to operate. A SLAPP may also intimidate others from participating in the debate. A SLAPP is often preceded by a legal threat. SLAPPs bring about freedom of speech concerns due to their chilling effect and are often difficult to filter out and penalize because the plaintiffs attempt to obfuscate their intent to censor, intimidate, or silence their critics.

To protect freedom of speech, some jurisdictions have passed anti-SLAPP laws. These laws often function by allowing a defendant to file a motion to strike or dismiss on the grounds that the case involves protected speech on a matter of public concern. The plaintiff then bears the burden of showing a probability that they will prevail. If the plaintiffs fail to meet the burden, their claim is dismissed and the plaintiffs may be required to pay a penalty for bringing the case. They vary widely by jurisdiction. Anti-SLAPP laws are generally considered to have a favorable effect, and many lawyers have fought to enact stronger laws protecting against SLAPPs.

== Characteristics ==
SLAPP is a form of strategic litigation or impact litigation that do not have true legal claims but are focused on deterring a message that they do not like.

A common feature of SLAPPs is forum shopping, wherein plaintiffs find courts that are more favourable towards the claims to be brought than the court in which the defendant (or sometimes plaintiffs) live.

Other widely mentioned elements of a SLAPP are the actual effectiveness at silencing critics, the timing of the suit, inclusion of extra or spurious defendants (such as relatives or hosts of legitimate defendants), inclusion of plaintiffs with no real claim (such as corporations that are affiliated with legitimate plaintiffs), making claims that are very difficult to disprove or rely on no written record, ambiguous or deliberately mangled wording that lets plaintiffs make spurious allegations without fear of perjury, refusal to consider any settlement (or none other than cash), characterization of all offers to settle as insincere, extensive and unnecessary demands for discovery, attempts to identify anonymous or pseudonymous critics, appeals on minor points of law, and demands for broad rulings when appeal is accepted on such minor points of law. In some instances it is clear that plaintiffs are attempting to drain defendants of their financial resources by making the lawsuit as costly as possible, and in these cases the plaintiff&#x27;s motive may not be legal victory, but merely to waste the defendant&#x27;s time and money.

When SLAPPs involve copyright law, they can be considered as a type of censorship by copyright.

== History ==
The acronym was coined in the 1980s by University of Denver professors Penelope Canan and George W. Pring. The term was originally defined as &quot;a lawsuit involving communications made to influence a governmental action or outcome, which resulted in a civil complaint or counterclaim filed against nongovernment individuals or organizations on a substantive issue of some public interest or social significance.&quot; The concept&#x27;s originators later dropped the notion that government contact had to be about a public issue to be protected by the right to petition the government, as provided in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. It has since been defined less broadly by some U.S. states, and more broadly in one state (California) where it includes suits about speech on any public issue.

The original conceptualization proffered by Canan and Pring emphasized the right to petition as protected in the United States under the US Constitution&#x27;s specific protection in the First Amendment&#x27;s fifth clause. It is still definitional: SLAPPs are civil lawsuits filed against those who have communicated to government officialdom (in its entire constitutional apparatus). The right to petition, granted by Edgar the Peaceful, King of England in the 10th century, antedates Magna Carta in terms of its significance in the development of democratic institutions. As currently conceived, the right claims that democracy cannot properly function in the presence of barriers between the governed and the governing.

New York Supreme Court Judge J. Nicholas Colabella said in reference to SLAPPs: &quot;Short of a gun to the head, a greater threat to First Amendment expression can scarcely be imagined.&quot; In the United States a number of jurisdictions have made such suits illegal, however the conditions that a defendant must satisfy for a dismissal of the suit vary from state to state. In some states, such as California, defendants may be entitled to counter-sue SLAPP plaintiffs under some circumstances. This is commonly referred to as &quot;SLAPPback&quot;.

== Jurisdictional variations ==

=== Australia ===
In the Australian Capital Territory, the &quot;Protection of Public Participation Act 2008&quot; (ACT) protects conduct intended to influence public opinion or promote or further action in relation to an issue of public interest. A party starting or maintaining a proceeding against a defendant for an improper purpose may be ordered to pay a financial penalty to the territory.

=== Canada ===
Canada&#x27;s three most populous provinces (Quebec, British Columbia, and Ontario) have enacted anti-SLAPP legislation.

==== British Columbia ====
Since the repeal, BC activists especially the BCCLA have argued repeatedly for a broad understanding of SLAPP and a broad interpretation of judicial powers especially in intervener applications in BC and other common law jurisdictions and when arguing for new legislation to prevent SLAPPs. The activist literature contains extensive research on particular cases and criteria. The West Coast Environmental Law organization agrees and generally considers BC to lag other jurisdictions.

In March 2019, the legislature voted unanimously to pass another anti-SLAPP bill, the Protection of Public Participation Act.

==== Nova Scotia ====
A private member&#x27;s bill introduced in 2001 by Graham Steele (NDP, Halifax Fairview) proposed a &quot;Protection of Public Participation Act&quot; to dismiss proceedings or claims brought or maintained for an improper purpose, awarding punitive or exemplary damages (effectively, a &quot;SLAPP back&quot;) and protection from liability for communication or conduct which constitutes public participation. The bill did not progress beyond first reading.

==== Ontario ====
By 2010, the Ontario attorney-general had issued a major report which identified SLAPP as a major problem but initially little to nothing was done.

In June 2013, the attorney general introduced legislation to implement the recommendations of the report. The bill proposed a mechanism for an order to dismiss strategic lawsuits which attack free expression on matters of public interest, with full costs (but not punitive damages) and on a relatively short timeframe, if the underlying claims had no reasonable prospect of success.

The bill enjoyed support from a wide range of groups including municipalities, the Canadian Environmental Law Association, EcoJustice, Environmental Defence, Ontario Clean Air Alliance, Ontario Nature, Canadian Civil Liberties Association, Canadian Journalists for Free Expression, Citizens Environment Alliance of Southwestern Ontario, The Council of Canadians, CPAWS Wildlands League, Sierra Club Ontario, Registered Nurses&#x27; Association of Ontario and Greenpeace Canada.

The legislation was re-introduced following the 2014 Ontario election as Bill 52, and on 3 November 2015, Ontario enacted it as the Protection of Public Participation Act, 2015.

==== Quebec ====
Québec&#x27;s then Justice Minister, Jacques Dupuis, proposed an anti-SLAPP bill on 13 June 2008.
The bill was adopted by the National Assembly of Quebec on 3 June 2009. Quebec&#x27;s amended Code of Civil Procedure was the first anti-SLAPP mechanism in force in Canada.

Prior to Ontario enacting its own Anti-SLAPP law the bill was invoked there (and then Supreme Court of Canada docket 33819). In the case of Les Éditions Écosociété Inc., Alain Deneault, Delphine Abadie and William Sacher vs. Banro Inc., in which the publisher Écosociété pleaded (supported by the BCCLA) that it should not face Ontario liability for a publication in Quebec, as the suit was a SLAPP and the Quebec law explicitly provided to dismiss these. The court denied the request, ruling it had jurisdiction. A separate 2011 decision in Quebec Superior Court had ruled that Barrick Gold had to pay $143,000 to the book&#x27;s three authors and publisher, Les Éditions Écosociété Inc., to prepare their defence in a &quot;seemingly abusive&quot; strategic lawsuit against public participation. Despite the Québec ruling, the book &quot;Noir Canada&quot; that documented the relationship between Canadian mining corporations, armed conflict and political actors in Africa was never published as part of a settlement which, according to the authors, was only made for the sole purpose of resolving the three-and-a-half-year legal battle.

The Quebec law is substantially different in structure than that of California or other jurisdictions, however, as Quebec&#x27;s Constitution generally subordinates itself to international law, and as such the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights applies. That treaty only permits liability for arbitrary and unlawful speech. The ICCPR has also been cited, in the BC case &quot;Crookes v. Newton&quot;, as the standard for balancing free speech versus reputation rights. The Supreme Court of Canada in October 2011, ruling in that case, neither reiterated nor rescinded that standard.

===European Union===
On 11 April 2024, the European Parliament approved an anti-SLAPP directive. The directive replaced a non binding Recommendation (EU) 2022/758 to member states issued by the European Commission on 27 April 2022. The directive&#x27;s approval came after long series of drafts, discussions and consultations between the European Commission, European Parliament and the EU member states, initiated by the European Parliament&#x27;s resolution of 25 November 2020 expressing &quot;its continued deep concern about the state of media freedom within the EU in the context of the abuses and attacks still being perpetrated against journalists and media workers in some Member States because of their work&quot; and called on the European Commission to &quot;establish minimum standards against SLAPP practices across the EU&quot;.

=== United Kingdom ===

The most common used to be a civil suit for defamation, which in the English common law tradition was a tort. The common law of libel dates to the early 17th century and, unlike most English law, is reverse onus, meaning that once someone alleges a statement is libelous, the burden is on the defendant to prove that it is not.

As in the European Union there has been increasing anti-SLAPP activism in the UK led by a coalition including English PEN, Index on Censorship, the National Union of Journalists, and Amnesty International. 

=== United States ===

==== State courts ====
As of 2024, trends have pointed towards defendants receiving more protection from SLAPP suits in the U.S. Thirty-three states, the District of Columbia, and Guam have enacted statutory protections against SLAPPs as of 2023. These states are Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington. In West Virginia, the courts have adopted protections against SLAPPs. These laws vary in scope and level of protection, while the remaining states lack specific protections. These protections, however, only apply to suits filed in courts in those states, and plaintiffs often seek jurisdictions more favorable, including federal courts, that lack the same added protections that many defendants would have received in their state court.

For example, in 1992 California enacted Code of Civil Procedure § 425.16, a statute intended to frustrate SLAPPs by providing a quick and inexpensive defense. It provides for a special motion to strike that a defendant can file at the outset of a lawsuit to strike a complaint when it arises from conduct that falls within the rights of petition or free speech. The statute expressly applies to any writing or speech made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, but there is no requirement that the writing or speech be promulgated directly to the official body. It also applies to speech in a public forum about an issue of public interest and to any other petition or speech conduct about an issue of public interest.

In February 2025, Greenpeace went on trial against Energy Transfer in North Dakota, where it had been sued by Energy Transfer itself in 2017 claiming &quot; Greenpeace spread misinformation that incited the protests and severely damaged its ability to run its business.&quot; Greenpeace considers this lawsuit a SLAPP; importantly ND does not have a law to dismiss lawsuits shown to be SLAPP cases.

====Federal law====
In 2010, Obama signed the SPEECH Act on the closely related issue of libel tourism, offering more protections for suits filed in foreign countries.

The SPEAK FREE Act of 2015 did not receive a vote after being introduced.

== Notable SLAPPs ==
=== Australia ===
* &quot;Gunns 20&quot;: In the 2005 &quot;Gunns Limited v Marr &amp; Ors&quot; case, Gunns filed a writ in the Supreme Court of Victoria against 20 individuals and organisations, including Senator Bob Brown, for over A$7.8 million. The defendants have become collectively known as the &quot;Gunns 20&quot;. Gunns claimed that the defendants sullied its reputation and caused it to lose jobs and profits. The defendants claimed that they are protecting the environment. Opponents and critics of the case have suggested that the writ was filed with the intent to discourage public criticism of the company. Gunns has maintained the position that they were merely trying to prevent parties enjoined to the writ from undertaking unlawful activities that disrupt their business. The statement of claim alleged incidents of assault against forestry workers and vandalism. At a hearing before the Supreme Court of Victoria, an amended statement of claim lodged by the company and served on defendants on 1 July 2005, was dismissed. However, the judge in the case granted the company leave to lodge a third version of their statement of claim with the court no later than 15 August 2005. The application continued before the court, before being brought to a close on 20 October 2006. In his ruling, Justice Bernard Bongiorno made an award of costs in favour of the respondents only as far as it covered those costs incurred with striking out the third version of the statement of claim, and costs incurred associated with their application for costs. In November 2006, Gunns dropped the case against Helen Gee, Peter Pullinger and Doctors for Forests. In December 2006, it abandoned the claim against Greens MPs Bob Brown and Peg Putt. The other matters were all settled in favour of Gunns following the payment of more than $150,000 in damages or, in some cases, undertakings to the court not to protest at certain locations.

===Belgium===

* Belgian law recognizes the concept of &quot;tergend geding&quot; (bullying litigation), any litigation of which the underlying aim is to cause discomfort to the opposing party, and hence increase the possibility of its redrawal from the lawsuit. Qualification of litigation as such by a judge can lead to its dismissal.

=== Brazil ===
* ThyssenKrupp Atlantic Steel Company (TKCSA), one of the largest private enterprises in Latin America, sued Brazilian researchers from public universities as UERJ (Rio de Janeiro State University) and Fiocruz (Oswaldo Cruz Foundation) for moral damages. First, TKCSA sued research pulmonologist Hermano Albuquerque de Castro from Sergio Arouca National School of Public Health (ENSP – Fiocruz). Then TKCSA sued Alexandre Pessoa Dias, research professor of the Joaquim Venâncio Polytechnic School of Health (EPSJV – Fiocruz), and Monica Cristina Lima, a biologist from Pedro Ernesto University Hospital and board member of the Public University Workers Union of Rio de Janeiro State (Sintuperj). The last two lawsuits occurred after the disclosure of the technical report &quot;Evaluation of social, environmental and health impacts caused by the setup and operation of TKCSA in Santa Cruz&quot;.

=== Canada ===
* &quot;Daishowa Inc. v. Friends of the Lubicon&quot;: From 1995 to 1998 a series of judgements (OJ 1536 1995, OJ 1429 1998 (ONGD)) established that defendants, who had accused a global company of engaging in &quot;genocide&quot;, were entitled to recover court costs due to the public interest in the criticism, even if it was rhetorically unjustifiable. This was the first case to establish clearly the SLAPP criteria.
* &quot;Fraser v. Saanich (District)&quot; 1995, [BCJ 3100 BCSC] was held explicitly to be a SLAPP, the first known case to be so described. Justice Singh found plaintiff&#x27;s conduct to be &quot;reprehensible and deserving of censure&quot;, ordering he pay &quot;special costs&quot; (page 48, &quot;Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation: The British Columbia Experience&quot;, RECEIL 19(1) 2010 ) to compensate.
* Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper filed a suit against the Liberal Party of Canada, the Official Opposition, after the latter paid for trucks to drive through the streets playing a journalist&#x27;s tape of Harper admitting he knew of &quot;financial considerations&quot; offered to dying MP Chuck Cadman before a critical House of Commons of Canada vote in 2005. This, the Liberals and most commentators and authorities agreed, would be a serious crime if proven. Harper alleged the tape had been altered but a court found no evidence of this. The suit was dropped by Michael Ignatieff after he replaced Stephane Dion as Leader of the Opposition, and so was not heard in court, but was transparently a (successful) effort to get the trucks off the streets.
* &quot;Crookes v. Openpolitics.ca&quot;, filed May 2006 [S063287, Supreme Court of BC], and a series of related suits leading to a unanimous October 2011 ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada in &quot;Crookes v. Newton&quot;, upheld the rights of online debaters to link freely to third parties without fear of liability for contents at the other end of the link. A number of related rulings had previously established that transient comments on the Internet could not be, in themselves, simply printed and used to prove that &quot;publication&quot; had occurred for purposes of libel and defamation law in Canada. Other elements of the ruling clarified how responsible journalism (and therefore the right to protect anonymous sources), qualified privilege and innocent dissemination defenses applied to persons accused of online defamation.
* In May 2010, Youthdale Treatment Centres of Toronto, Ontario filed a defamation suit against various former patients, parents of former patients, and other persons, claiming C$5 million in damages. The lawsuit, filed on 5 May 2010, on behalf of Youthdale by Harvin Pitch and Jennifer Lake of Teplitsky, Colson LLP, claimed that these persons were involved in a conspiracy to, among other things, have Youthdale&#x27;s licence to operate revoked. Youthdale also claimed their reputation was damaged as a result of various actions by the named defendants, which Youthdale alleged included the creation of websites and blogs containing complaints against Youthdale, including alleged accusations of unlawful administration of psychotropic medications. A notable left-turn for Youthdale occurred in July 2010, when Youthdale became the subject of a Toronto Star investigation, in which it was found that Youthdale had been admitting children to its Secure Treatment Unit that did not have mental disorders. The case has since been dismissed.
* In 2011, in &quot;Robin Scory v. Glen Valley Watersheds Society&quot;, a BC court ruled that &quot;an order for special costs acts as a deterrent to litigants whose purpose is to interfere with the democratic process&quot;, and that &quot;Public participation and dissent is an important part of our democratic system.&quot; However, such awards remained rare.
* In 2012, Sino-Forest sued Muddy Waters Research for $4 billion for defamation in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Muddy Waters had accused Sino-Forest of fraudulently inflating its assets and earnings, and had claimed the company&#x27;s shares were essentially worthless. However, on 10 January 2012, Sino-Forest announced that its historic financial statements and related audit reports should not be relied upon. Sino-forest also filed for bankruptcy protection. In response to the lawsuit, Muddy Waters stated that Sino&#x27;s bankruptcy protection filing vindicated its accusations since the company would not require bankruptcy protection if it was really generating close to $2 billion in cash flow. Sino-Forest was represented by Bennett Jones LLP.
* In September 2014, Brampton, Ontario mayor Susan Fennell used threats of legal action against fellow councillors, the Toronto Star, the city&#x27;s integrity commissioner, and auditor Deloitte to delay a city council meeting which was to discuss a major spending scandal. As the parties involved needed an opportunity to seek legal advice, regardless of the merit (or spuriousness) of the claims, this tactic served to defer a key debate which otherwise would have, and should have, taken place before the city&#x27;s 27 October municipal election.

=== France ===
* In 2010 and 2011, a French blogger was summoned twice by the communication company Cometik (NOVA-SEO) over exposing their quick-selling method (also known as one shot method) and suggesting a financial compensation for his first trial. The company&#x27;s case was dismissed twice, but appealed both times. On 31 March 2011, the company won:
** the censorship of any reference (of its name) on Mathias Poujol-Rost&#x27;s weblog,
** €2,000 as damages,
** the obligation to publish the judicial decision for 3 months,
** €2,000 as procedural allowance,
** all legal fees for both first and appeal instances.

=== Germany ===
In September 2017, a naturopath in Arizona named Colleen Huber filed a defamation lawsuit, preceded by two cease and desist letters, against Britt Marie Hermes, a naturopathy whistleblower. The lawsuit was filed for Hermes&#x27; blog post criticizing Huber for using naturopathic remedies to treat cancer and speculating that Hermes&#x27; name was being used without her permission in several registered domain names owned by Huber. The lawsuit was filed in Kiel, Germany where Hermes was residing to pursue her PhD in evolutionary genomics. Jann Bellamy of Science-Based Medicine speculates that this is &quot;due to good old forum shopping for a more plaintiff-friendly jurisdiction&quot; as there are no protections against SLAPP lawsuits in Germany. Britt Hermes is a notable scientific skeptic and the organization Australian Skeptics set up a fund to help with legal costs on the case. In an interview at CSICon 2019, Britt Hermes told Susan Gerbic that she had won her case on 24 May 2019. According to Britt Hermes, &quot;the court ruled that my post is protected speech under Article 5 (1) of the German constitution&quot;.

=== Greece ===

In 2022, in the wake of revelations that Greece&#x27;s National Intelligence Service (Greece) was spying on the leader of PASOK, the third largest party, Nikos Androulakis, the executive director of NIS, Grigoris Kontoleon, and the Secretary General to prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Grigoris Dimitriadis (also a close relative of Kyriakos Mitsotakis) resigned from office. Grigoris Dimitriadis filed lawsuits against two journalists who had helped uncover the scandal, Thodoris Chondrogiannos and Nikolas Leontopoulos, demanding 150,000 euros as damages for false publications and the removal of those publications, but also against Thanassis Koukakis, a journalist who during 2021 was spied upon because of his investigations on Greek businessmen.

=== India ===
In 2020, Karan Bajaj, the founder of WhiteHat Jr., now owned by Byju&#x27;s, filed a 2.6 million dollar lawsuit against Pradeep Poonia, a software engineer who publicly accused the company of having a toxic work environment and unethical business practices. The Delhi High Court issued an interim order requiring Poonia to remove certain tweets from his Twitter account. In 2021, Bajaj rescinded the lawsuit.

=== Israel ===
During 2016, Amir Bramly, who at the time was being investigated and subsequently indicted for an alleged Ponzi scheme, sued for libel Tomer Ganon, a Calcalist reporter, privately for ₪1 million in damages, due to a news item linking him to Bar Refaeli. In addition Bramly sued Channel-2 News and its reporters and managers for ₪5 million in damages due to an alleged libel in an in-depth TV news item and interview with the court appointed liquidator of his companies, and has threatened to sue additional bodies. The sued individuals and bodies have claimed that these are SLAPP actions.

=== Japan ===
In 2006, Oricon Inc., Japan&#x27;s music chart provider, sued freelance journalist Hiro Ugaya due to his suggesting in an article for business and culture magazine &quot;&quot; that the company was fiddling its statistics to benefit certain management companies and labels, specifically Johnny and Associates. The company sought ¥50 million and apology from him. He found allies in the magazine&#x27;s editor-in-chief Tadashi Ibi, lawyer Kentaro Shirosaki, and Reporters Sans Frontières (RSF).

He was found guilty in 2008 by the Tokyo District Court and ordered to pay one million yen, but he appealed and won. Oricon did not appeal later. His 33-month struggle against Oricon and his research on SLAPPs through his self-expense trip in the United States was featured on the TBS program &quot;JNN&quot; &quot;Reportage&quot;, titled as &quot;Legal Intimidation Against Free Speech: What is SLAPP?&quot;

RSF expressed its support to the journalist and was relieved on the abandonment of the suit.

=== Norway ===
On 17 May 2018, a non-profit project rettspraksis.no challenged a perceived monopoly on the publication of pre-2009 Supreme Court of Norway decisions by publishing a large back catalogue of historical decisions. To prevent publication, the government-established Lovdata foundation demanded an immediate injunction against two project volunteers, Håkon Wium Lie and Fredrik Ljone, that the website be shut down. The foundation claimed that rettspraksis.no had &quot;developed or used software to systematically download rulings from Lovdatas online services&quot; in order to publish the rulings in violation of Lovdata&#x27;s rights according to the Norwegian Copyright Act section 43, the Database Rights Section. The District Court granted the injunction without a hearing based on finding that the volunteer actions was in violation of section 43, and that the publication on rettspraksis.no would enable other commercial actors to exploit the material in violation of Lovdata&#x27;s rights even if the project itself did not. A postjudgement hearing on 30 and 31 August 2018 resulted in a reduction in the injunction&#x27;s effects, most significantly that the Database Rights Section did not extend to rulings published before 2005. Appeals from Ljone and Wium Lie to the Appeals Court and the Supreme Court were denied.

=== Serbia ===

In the late 1990s, many SLAPP cases against independent and pro-opposition media ensued after adoption of the infamous media law, proposed by then minister of information, Aleksandar Vučić. The main characteristic of these cases were quick trials and extremely high fines, most of which were unaffordable for journalists and their media houses.
While SLAPP cases became, more or less, rare after the Overthrow of Slobodan Milošević, they gradually reappeared in the late 2010s, and especially in the early 2020s, during SNS-led cabinets. Notably, Aleksandar Vučić is current president of Serbia, the most influential figure of the regime, and he is often accused of suppression of media freedoms.

=== Thailand ===
On 6 March 2024, Chutima Sidasathian won a SLAPP suit against Thanonthorn Kaveekitrattana, after facing defamation charges for a 2022 post exposing misappropriation of funds from the Village Fund program.

===United Kingdom===
A 2021 libel action brought against the publisher HarperCollins and the author and journalist Catherine Belton over the latter&#x27;s book &quot;Putin&#x27;s People&quot; was described by former Conservative cabinet minister David Davis as a SLAPP. Despite winning the legal case brought by several Russian oligarchs, including Roman Abramovich, Belton was left facing legal costs of £1.5 million. UK Government justice minister James Cartlidge said, &quot;the Ministry of Justice is monitoring SLAPP threats against journalists and announced that the UK will be a member of the Council of Europe’s inaugural working group on SLAPPs with an anti-SLAPP draft recommendation for member states due in December 2023. I will be giving SLAPPs in UK courts urgent consideration. I want to make it clear that the Government are committed to a robust defence of transparency and freedom of speech. We will not tolerate anything that risks tarnishing the integrity of our judicial and legal profession&quot;.

Ministers later said that they would reform the legal system to prevent &quot;intimidation lawsuits&quot;; amendments to this effect were proposed for an anti-corruption economic crime bill before Parliament in March 2022. In October 2023, royal assent was given to the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023. The final Act includes anti-SLAPP provisions covering economic crimes (e.g. corruption, embezzlement), but does not venture beyond those areas.

In February 2024, the Conservative government under Rishi Sunak supported legislation to extend anti-SLAPP protections in all cases whatsoever, but this was not passed before the 4 July 2024 election ended Sunak&#x27;s government.

=== United States ===
* From 1981 to 1986, Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF) and San Luis Obispo County, California, filed a suit attempting to obtain the mailing list of the Abalone Alliance to get the group to pay for the police costs of the largest anti-nuclear civil-disobedience act in U.S. history at the Diablo Canyon Power Plant. The September 1981 demonstration involved tens of thousands of people. The County was dismissed from the case by the trial judge, and lost on appeal for recovery of police costs (including in part because such costs are intended to be covered by taxes). In 1985, the Supreme Court of California declined to block a lower court ruling that allowed PLF to sue &quot;leaders of the demonstration [for] costs associated with the protest&quot;, which defendants said was an attempt to chill dissent. Pacific Legal Foundation lost at every court level and withdrew the suit the day before it was due to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
* Karen Winner, the author of &quot;Divorced From Justice&quot;, is recognized as &quot;[the] catalyst for the changes that we adopted&quot;, said Leo Milonas, a retired justice with the Appellate Division of the New York state courts who chaired a special commission that recommended the changes adopted by Chief Judge Judith Kaye. (The NY state court report&#x27;s committee cited a previous New York City Commissioner of Consumer Protection report as a &quot;major&quot; reason for its study. Karen Winner was the author of the earlier study.) But in 1999, Winner, along with a psychologist/whistleblower, and several citizens were SLAPPed for criticizing the guardian ad litem system and a former judge in South Carolina. Winner&#x27;s report, &quot;Findings on Judicial Practices &amp; Court-appointed Personnel in the Family Courts in Dorchester, Charleston &amp; Berkeley Counties, South Carolina&quot; and citizen demonstrations led to the first laws in South Carolina to establish minimum standards and licensing requirements for guardians ad litem, who represent the interests of children in court cases. The retaliatory SLAPPs have been dragging on for nearly 10 years, with judgments totaling more than $11 million against the co-defendants collectively. Reflecting the retaliatory nature of these suits, at least one of the co-defendants is still waiting to find out from the judges which particular statements, if any, he made were false.
* Barbra Streisand, as plaintiff, lost a 2003 SLAPP motion after she sued an aerial photographer involved in the California Coastal Records Project. &quot;Streisand v. Adelman&quot;, (California Superior Court Case SC077257) See Streisand effect.
* In 2004, RadioShack Corporation sued Bradley D. Jones, the webmaster of RadioShackSucks.com and a former RadioShack dealer for 17 years, in an attempt to suppress online discussion of a class action lawsuit in which more than 3,300 current or former RadioShack managers were alleging the company required them to work long hours without overtime pay.
* Nationally syndicated talk radio host Tom Martino prevailed in an anti-SLAPP motion in 2009 after he was sued for libel by a watercraft retailer. The case received national attention for its suggestion that no one reasonably expects objective facts from a typical talk show host, who is often a comedian telling jokes.
* In March 2009, MagicJack (a company that promotes a USB VoIP device) filed a defamation suit against Boing Boing for exposing their unfair and deceptive business tactics regarding their EULA, visitor counter, and 30-day trial period. This was dismissed as a SLAPP by a California judge in late 2009. In the resulting ruling, MagicJack was made responsible for most of Boing Boing&#x27;s legal costs.
* In the 2009 case &quot;Comins vs. VanVoorhis&quot;, a Florida man named Christopher Comins filed a defamation suit against a University of Florida graduate student after the student blogged about a video of Comins repeatedly shooting someone&#x27;s pet dogs. This was cited as an example of a SLAPP by the radio show &quot;On the Media&quot;.
* In November 2010, filmmaker Fredrik Gertten, as defendant, won an anti-SLAPP motion after he was sued for defamation by Dole Fruit Company. The case concerned Gertten&#x27;s documentary film about farm workers. The lengthy lawsuit was documented in Gertten&#x27;s film &quot;Big Boys Gone Bananas!*&quot;.
* In an effort to prevent four women from filing any Public Records Requests without first getting permission from a judge, or from filing future lawsuits, the Congress Elementary School District filed the lawsuit &quot;Congress Elementary School District v. Warren, et. al.&quot; on 28 January 2010. The Goldwater Institute, a think tank based in Phoenix, Arizona, represented the four defendants. The school district said that it has been harassed so often by Warren that it was not able to functionally educate its students. Toni Wayas, the school district&#x27;s superintendent, claimed &quot;that it had, time and time again, complied with the requests&quot;. The Goldwater Institute argued that the school district had been in violation of state laws mandating government transparency in the past. Investigations in 2002 and 2007 by the state Ombudsman and Attorney General uncovered violations of the state&#x27;s open meeting law by the Attorney General&#x27;s Office. According to Carrie Ann Sitren of the Goldwater Institute, this was &quot;a clear attempt to silence people in the community who have been critical of the board&#x27;s actions, and have made good-faith attempts to ensure the district is spending taxpayer money wisely&quot;. None of the records requested were private or confidential, and thus, should have been readily available to be released to the public, according to the assistant state Ombudsman.
* In December 2010, prominent foreclosure defense attorney Matthew Weidner was sued by Nationwide Title, a foreclosure processing firm.
* In January 2011 Sony Computer Entertainment America sued George Hotz and other individuals for jailbreaking the PlayStation 3 and publishing encryption and signing keys for various layers of the system&#x27;s architecture. The defendants and the Electronic Frontier Foundation consider the case an egregious abuse of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Hotz settled with Sony before trial.
* &quot;Scientology versus the Internet&quot; refers to a number of disputes relating to the Church of Scientology&#x27;s efforts to suppress material critical of Scientology on the Internet through the use of lawsuits and legal threats.
* &quot;Saltsman v. Goddard&quot; (the Steubenville High School rape case): In an effort to stop blogger Alexandria Goddard&#x27;s website from allowing allegedly defamatory posts about their son, two parents of a teenaged boy from Steubenville, Ohio sued Goddard and a dozen anonymous posters in October 2012. The lawsuit asked for an injunction against the blogger, a public apology, acknowledgement that he was not involved in the rape, and $25,000 in damages.
* On 27 August 2012, Robert E. Murray and Murray Energy filed a lawsuit against environment reporter Ken Ward Jr. and the &quot;Charleston Gazette-Mail&quot; of Charleston, West Virginia. The lawsuit alleged Ken Ward Jr. posted libelous statements on his blog. Murray claims the blog post entitled &quot;Mitt Romney, Murray Energy and Coal Criminals&quot; has damaged his business, reputation, and has jeopardized the jobs Murray Energy provides in Belmont County, Ohio. In June 2017, Murray Energy issued a cease and desist letter to the HBO television show &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot; following the show&#x27;s attempt to obtain comment about the coal industry. The show went ahead with the episode (18 June), in which host John Oliver discussed the Crandall Canyon Mine collapse in Utah in 2007, and expressed the opinion that Murray did not do enough to protect his miners&#x27; safety. Three days later, Murray and his companies brought suit against Oliver, the show&#x27;s writers, HBO, and Time Warner. The lawsuit alleged that, in the &quot;Last Week Tonight&quot; show, Oliver &quot;incited viewers to do harm to Mr. Murray and his companies&quot;. The ACLU filed an amicus brief in support of HBO in the case; the brief has been described as &quot;hilarious&quot; and the &quot;snarkiest legal brief ever&quot;. The brief also included a comparison of Murray with the fictional character Dr. Evil that was used in the Oliver show, with the explanation that &quot;it should be remembered that truth is an absolute defense to a claim of defamation&quot;. On 11 August 2017, a federal district court judge ruled that Murray Energy suits against &quot;The New York Times&quot; and HBO could each proceed in a lower state court. The suit against HBO was dismissed with prejudice on 21 February 2018. In November 2019, John Oliver discussed the implications of the lawsuit (and of SLAPP suits in general) on his show after Murray dropped the suit.
* In August 2015, the State Fair of Texas was sanctioned more than $75,000 for filing a SLAPP suit against a lawyer who had requested financial documents from the State Fair.
* In December 2015, James McGibney was ordered to pay a $1 million anti-SLAPP court sanction and $300,000 in attorney&#x27;s fees to Neal Rauhauser for filing a series of baseless lawsuits against him. The ruling was temporarily reversed when the presiding judge granted McGibney&#x27;s request for a new trial in February 2016, but reinstated in favor of Rauhasuer on 14 April 2016, with the SLAPP sanction against McGibney reduced from $1 million to $150,000. The judge ruled that McGibney had filed the suits to willfully and maliciously injure Rauhauser and to deter him from exercising his constitutional right to criticize McGibney.

*In March 2019, Republican US Representative for California, Devin Nunes filed a defamation lawsuit against Twitter, Elizabeth &quot;Liz&quot; Mair, Mair Strategies LLC, and the people behind the parody Twitter accounts &quot;Devin Nunes&#x27; Cow&quot; (@DevinCow) and &quot;Devin Nunes&#x27; Mom&quot; (@DevinNunesMom), seeking $250 million in damages. The lawsuit has been described by legal experts as a SLAPP. The suit was filed in Virginia, a state known to have weak anti-SLAPP laws, rather than in California, where Nunes lives and where Twitter is headquartered, which has strong anti-SLAPP laws. In April 2019, Nunes filed, again in Virginia, a defamation suit against The Fresno Bee, his hometown newspaper, and its owner, McClatchy, after it published a story about investors in his winery partying on a yacht with cocaine and prostitutes. Nunes has since filed defamation lawsuits against CNN, Ryan Lizza, Hearst Magazines, Campaign for Accountability, Fusion GPS, and others. In February 2020 (following the 2019 elections in which Democrats took control of both chambers for the first time since 1994), the Virginia General Assembly passed bills intended to discourage future SLAPPs in the state by strengthening defendant protections.
* In November 2020, BYD Company filed a libel lawsuit against Vice Media and the non-profit Alliance for American Manufacturing (AAM) and some of its employees. The Supreme Court of the United States rejected BYD&#x27;s suit in August 2022.

<doc id="164131" wikidata="Q311110" url="?curid=164131" title="John Blow">
<text>John Blow (baptised 23 February 1649 – 1 October 1708) was an English composer and organist of the Baroque period. Appointed organist of Westminster Abbey in late 1668, his pupils included William Croft, Jeremiah Clarke and Henry Purcell. In 1685 he was named a private musician to James II. His only stage composition, &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; (ca. 1680–1687), is thought to have influenced Henry Purcell&#x27;s later opera &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot;. In 1687, he became choirmaster at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, where many of his pieces were performed. In 1699 he was appointed to the newly created post of Composer to the Chapel Royal.

==Early life and education==
Blow was probably born in the village of Collingham in Nottinghamshire. The parish registers at Newark record the baptisms of Blow and of his brother and sister, the marriage of his parents, and the burial of his father. The register of Lambeth degrees notes that in 1677, on taking his doctorate, Blow said that his birthplace was &#x27;the faithful borough of Newark&#x27;. As he was baptised on 23 February 1649, he was likely born only a short while before. As a boy, he was selected as a chorister of the Chapel Royal, and distinguished himself by his proficiency in music.

Blow composed several anthems at an unusually early age, including &quot;Lord, Thou hast been our refuge&quot;, &quot;Lord, rebuke me not&quot; and the so-called &quot;club anthem&quot;, &quot;I will always give thanks&quot;, the last in collaboration with Pelham Humfrey and William Turner, either in honour of a victory over the Dutch in 1665, or more probably simply to commemorate the friendly intercourse of the three choristers.

==Career==
In 1668, he was an organist at Westminster Abbey. He composed a two-part setting of Robert Herrick&#x27;s &quot;Goe, perjur&#x27;d man&quot;, written at the request of Charles II to imitate Giacomo Carissimi&#x27;s &quot;Dite, o cieli&quot;. In 1674, he was made a gentleman of the Chapel Royal and Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal.

Blow, who by 1678 was a doctor of music, was named in 1685 one of the private musicians of James II. Between 1680 and 1687, he wrote his only stage composition of which any record survives, the Masque for the entertainment of the King, &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;. In this, Mary Davis played the part of Venus. Lady Mary Tudor, her daughter by Charles II, appeared as Cupid.

In 1687, Blow became choirmaster (or Master of the Choristers) at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. In 1690 he built a house for himself in Hampton. (Blow also owned eight other houses in the vicinity of Westminster Abbey). The Hampton house was demolished in 1799. It was on the site of the present-day house known as Beveree in the High Street.

In 1695 he was elected organist of St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, and is said to have resumed his post as organist of Westminster Abbey, from which in 1679 he had retired or been dismissed to make way for Purcell. In 1700, he was appointed to the newly created post of Composer to the Chapel Royal.

==Music==

Blow wrote fourteen services and 30 odes for royal celebrations, 50 secular song-like pieces and more than a hundred anthems.

In addition to purely ecclesiastical music and his relatively well-known masque &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;, Blow&#x27;s works include &quot;Great sir, the joy of all our hearts&quot;, an ode for New Year&#x27;s Day 1682, similar compositions for 1683, 1686, 1687, 1688, 1689, 1693 (?), 1694 and 1700; odes, and the like, for the celebration of St Cecilia&#x27;s Day for 1684, 1691, 1695 and 1700; for the coronation of James II, two anthems, &quot;Behold, O God, our Defender&quot; and &quot;God spake sometime in visions&quot;; some harpsichord pieces for the second part of Henry Playford&#x27;s &quot;Musick&#x27;s handmaid&quot; (1689); &quot;Epicedium for Queen Mary&quot; (1695) and &quot;Ode on the Death of Purcell&quot; (1696).

In 1700 he published his &quot;Amphion Anglicus&quot;, a collection of pieces of music for one, two, three and four voices, with a figured bass accompaniment. This includes a setting for voice and continuo of the poem &quot;The Self Banished&quot; by Edmund Waller.

==Personal life==
In September 1673, Blow married Elizabeth Braddock. She died in childbirth ten years later. Two of his sons died, but there were also three daughters, who survived him.

Blow died on 1 October 1708 aged 59 at his house in Broad Sanctuary. He is buried in Westminster Abbey.

==Legacy and honours==
*Collingham John Blow Primary School, Nottinghamshire, is named after him.
*Commissioned by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, Arthur Bliss composed &quot;Meditations on a Theme by John Blow&quot; in 1955 based on Blow&#x27;s verse anthem &quot;The Lord is my Shepherd&quot;. 
*The tercentenary of his death was marked by BBC Radio 3 and Westminster Abbey: the weekly broadcast of choral evensong was made by the choir of Westminster Abbey, live from the Abbey, and consisted of music mostly by him, and by his near contemporaries.

<text>A secret society is an organization about which the activities, events, inner functioning, or membership are concealed. The society may or may not attempt to conceal its existence. The term usually excludes covert groups, such as intelligence agencies or guerrilla warfare insurgencies, that hide their activities and memberships but maintain a public presence.
==Definitions==
The exact qualifications for labeling a group a secret society are disputed, but definitions generally rely on the degree to which the organization insists on secrecy, and might involve the retention and transmission of secret knowledge, the denial of membership or knowledge of the group, the creation of personal bonds between members of the organization, and the use of secret rites or rituals which solidify members of the group.

Anthropologically and historically, secret societies have been deeply interlinked with the concept of the Männerbund, the all-male &quot;warrior-band&quot; or &quot;warrior-society&quot; of pre-modern cultures (see H. Schurtz, &quot;Alterklassen und Männerbünde&quot;, Berlin, 1902; A. Van Gennep, &quot;The Rites of Passage&quot;, Chicago, 1960).

A purported &quot;family tree of secret societies&quot; has been proposed, although it may not be comprehensive.

Alan Axelrod, author of the &quot;International Encyclopedia of Secret Societies and Fraternal Orders&quot;, defines a secret society as an organization that:
* is exclusive
* claims to own special secrets
* shows a strong inclination to favor its members.

Historian Richard B. Spence of the University of Idaho offered a similar three-pronged definition: 
* The group&#x27;s existence is usually not kept secret, but some beliefs or practices are concealed from the public and require an oath of secrecy and loyalty to learn.
* The group promises superior status or knowledge to members. 
* The group&#x27;s membership is in some way restrictive, such as by race, sex, religious affiliation, or invitation only.
Spence also proposes a sub-category of &quot;Elite Secret Societies&quot; (composed of high-income or socially influential people) and notes that secret societies have a frequent if not universal tendency towards factionalism, infighting, and claiming origins older than can be reliably documented. Spence&#x27;s definition includes groups traditionally thought of as secret societies (Freemasons and Rosicrucians) and other groups not so traditionally classified such as certain organized crime cabals (the Mafia), religious groups (Order of Assassins and Thelema) and political movements (Bolsheviks and Black Dragon Society).

Historian Jasper Ridley says that Freemasonry is &quot;the world&#x27;s most powerful secret Society&quot;.

The organization &quot;Opus Dei&quot; (Latin for &quot;Work of God&quot;) is portrayed as a &quot;secret society&quot; of the Catholic Church. Critics such as the Jesuit Wladimir Ledóchowski sometimes refer to Opus Dei as a Catholic (or Christian or &quot;white&quot;) form of Freemasonry. Other critics label Opus Dei as &quot;Holy Mafia&quot; or &quot;Santa Mafia&quot;

The National Christian Association (1868–1983) is an example of an organization opposed to secret societies.

== Realms ==

===Politics===
Because some secret societies have political aims, they are illegal in several countries. Italy (Constitution of Italy, Section 2, Articles 13–28) and Poland, for example, ban secret political parties and political organizations in their constitutions.

===Colleges and universities===

Many student societies established on university campuses in the United States have been considered secret societies. Perhaps one of the most famous secret collegiate societies is Skull and Bones at Yale University. The influence of undergraduate secret societies at colleges such as Harvard College, Cornell University, Florida State University, Dartmouth College, Emory University, the University of Chicago, the University of Virginia, Georgetown University, New York University, and Wellesley College has been publicly acknowledged, if anonymously and circumspectly, since the 19th century.

British universities have a long history of secret societies or quasi-secret clubs, such as The Pitt Club at Cambridge University, Bullingdon Club at Oxford University, the Kate Kennedy Club, The Kensington Club and the Praetorian Club at the University of St Andrews, and the 16&#x27; Club at St David&#x27;s College. Another British secret society is the Cambridge Apostles, founded as an essay and debating society in 1820. Not all British universities host solely academic secret societies; both The Night Climbers of Cambridge and The Night Climbers of Oxford require both brains and brawn.

In France, Vandermonde is the secret society of the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers.

Notable examples in Canada include Episkopon at the University of Toronto&#x27;s Trinity College, and the Society of Thoth at the University of British Columbia.

Secret societies are disallowed in a few colleges. The Virginia Military Institute has rules that no cadet may join a secret society, and secret societies have been banned at Oberlin College from 1847 to the present, and at Princeton University since the beginning of the 20th century.

Confraternities in Nigeria are secret-society-like student groups within higher education, some of which have histories of violence and organized crime. The exact death toll from confraternity activities is unclear. One estimate in 2002 was that 250 people had been killed in campus cult-related murders in the previous decade, while the Exam Ethics Project lobby group estimated that 115 students and teachers had been killed between 1993 and 2003.

The Mandatory Monday Association is thought to operate out of a variety of Australian universities including the Australian Defence Force Academy. The Association has numerous chapters that meet only on Mondays to discuss business and carry out rituals.

The only secret society abolished and then legalized is that of The Philomaths, which is now a legitimate academic association founded on a strict selection of its members.

===Internet===
While their existence had been speculated for years, Internet-based secret societies first became known to the public in 2012 when Cicada 3301 began recruiting from the public via Internet-based puzzles. The goals of the society remain unknown, but it is believed to be involved in cryptography.

Secret societies played a major role in Chinese affairs for centuries. They were a key aspect of the Anti-Qing sentiments of the 20th century. After the collapse of the Qing Dynasty, they were tacitly supported by and actively collaborated with the Nationalist government. Having played prominent roles in history, they were targeted by the anti-secret society campaigns of the newly established government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China during the 1950s. Examples of Chinese secret societies include:

* Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists

==Opposition==

The Catholic Church strongly opposed secret societies, especially the Freemasons. It did relent somewhat in the United States and allowed membership in labour unions and the Knights of Columbus, but not the Masons. Some Christian denominations continue to forbid their members from joining secret societies in the 21st century, such as the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection and Seventh-day Adventists.

<doc id="164149" wikidata="Q3741" url="?curid=164149" title="Special Region of Yogyakarta">
<text>The Special Region of Yogyakarta is a province-level special region of Indonesia in southern Java. It is a semi-enclave that is surrounded by on the landward side by Central Java Province to the west, north, and east, but has a long coastline on the Indian Ocean to the south.

Co-ruled by the Yogyakarta Sultanate and the Duchy of Pakualaman, the region is the only officially recognized diarchy within the government of Indonesia. The city of Yogyakarta is a popular tourist destination and cultural center of the region. The Yogyakarta Sultanate was established in 1755 and provided unwavering support for Indonesia&#x27;s independence during the Indonesian National Revolution (1945–1949). As a first-level division in Indonesia, Yogyakarta is governed by Sultan Hamengkubuwono X as the governor and Duke Paku Alam X as the vice governor. With a land area of just 3,170.65 km2, it is the second-smallest province-level entity of Indonesia after Jakarta.

== History ==
In Javanese, it is pronounced , and named after the city of Ayodhya in Javanese-Hindu mythology. The Dutch name of the Special Region is Djokjakarta.

The Sultanate has existed in various forms and survived through the rule of the Dutch and the 1942 invasion of the Dutch East Indies by the Japanese Empire. In August 1945 Indonesia&#x27;s first president, Sukarno proclaimed the independence of the Indonesian Republic, and by September of that year, Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX and Duke Sri Paku Alam VIII had sent letters to Sukarno expressing their support for the newly born nation of Indonesia, in which they acknowledged the Yogyakarta Sultanate as part of the Indonesian Republic. The Sunanate of Surakarta did the same, and both of the Javanese kingdoms were awarded special status as special regions within the Indonesian Republic. However, due to a leftist anti-royalist uprising in Surakarta, the Sunanate of Surakarta lost its special administrative status in 1946 and was absorbed into the province of Central Java.

Yogyakarta&#x27;s overwhelming support and the Sultan&#x27;s patriotism were essential in the Indonesian struggle for independence during the Indonesian National Revolution (1945–1949). The city of Yogyakarta became the capital of the Indonesian Republic from January 1946 to December 1948 after the fall of Jakarta to the Dutch. Later, the Dutch also invaded Yogyakarta causing the Indonesian Republic&#x27;s capital to be transferred again to Bukittinggi in West Sumatra on 19 December 1948. In return for Yogyakarta&#x27;s support, the declaration of Special Authority over Yogyakarta was granted in full in 1950 and Yogyakarta was given the status of a Special Administrative Region, making Yogyakarta the only region headed by a monarchy in Indonesia.

The Special Region was struck by a 6.3-magnitude earthquake on 27 May 2006, killing 5,782 people, injuring approximately 36,000, and leaving 600,000 people homeless. The region of Bantul suffered the most damage and deaths.

== Geography ==

The Special Region is located near the southern coast of Java, surrounded on three sides by the province of Central Java, and with the Indian Ocean on the south side. The population at the 2010 Census was 3,457,491 people, which then increased to 3,668,719 at the 2020 Census; the official estimate for mid-2023 was 3,736,489 (comprising 1,849,540 males and 1,886,950 females). It has an area of 3,170.65 km2, making it the second-smallest area of the provinces in Indonesia, after the Jakarta Capital Region. Along with surrounding areas in Central Java, it has some of the highest population densities of Java.

Mount Merapi is located to the immediate north of the city of Yogyakarta and Sleman Regency. It is the most active volcano in Indonesia and has erupted regularly since 1548. It last erupted in October–November 2010, killing and injuring many people and temporarily displacing approximately 100,000 residents.

=== Geo-heritage sites ===
Indonesia has several geo-heritage sites in the Yogyakarta Special Region. It has been declared by the Geological Agency of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. The sites consist of nine sites: Eocene limestone in Gamping (Sleman Regency), pillow lava in Berbah (Sleman), pre-historic volcanic sediment in Candi Ijo, Prambanan (Sleman), dunes in Parangtritis Beach (Bantul Regency), Kiskendo cave, and former manganese mining site in Kleripan (Kulonprogo regency), the prehistoric volcano in Nglanggeran (Gunungkidul regency), Wediombo-Siung beaches (Gunungkidul) and Bioturbasi site in Kalingalang (Gunungkidul). The most unusual one is pillow lava in Berbah (Sleman) which is a big, rough black rock that lies on the bank of the narrow Dengkeng River. The prehistoric volcano in Nglanggeran (Gunungkidul Regency) has already been developed as a tourist destination.

According to Act No. 22 of 1948 (which is also the basis of Act No. 3 of 1950 on the formation of DIY), the Head and Vice Head of the Special Region are appointed by the president from the descendants of the ruling family in the region before Indonesian independence with the conditions of &quot;skill, honesty, and loyalty, and keeping in mind the customs of the area.&quot; Thus, the Head of the Special Region, until 1988, was automatically held by the reigning Sultan of Yogyakarta, and the Vice Head of the Special Region, until 1998, was automatically held by Prince Paku Alam who was on the throne. The nomenclature of the Governor and Vice Governor of the Special Region has only been used since 1999 with the issuance of Act No. 22 of 1999. Since 2012, the mechanism for filling the positions of Governor and Vice Governor of DIY is regulated by Act No. 13 of 2012 on the Uniqueness of the Special Region of Yogyakarta.

The province has a regional legislature, the Special Region of Yogyakarta Regional House of Representatives, which as of the 2024 election has 55 members. The largest party in the legislature is the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle.

=== Administrative divisions ===
The Special Region of Yogyakarta (provincial level) is subdivided into four regencies () and one city (), and divided further into districts ( or in the city of Yogyakarta) and villages (rural or urban , doublet); these are listed below, with their areas and their population at the 2000, 2010 and 2020 Censuses, with their present estimates, as of mid-2023.

Located within the Special Region of Yogyakarta, the city of Yogyakarta is known as a center of classical Javanese fine art and culture, such as &quot;batik&quot;, ballet, drama, music, poetry, and shadow puppetry. It is also one of Indonesia&#x27;s most renowned centres of higher education. At the city&#x27;s core is the Sultan&#x27;s palace, the &quot;Kraton&quot;. While the city sprawls outward in all directions from the Kraton, the &quot;modern&quot; centre of the city is located to the north.

The Special Region forms one of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The Yogyakarta S.R. Electoral District consists of all of the 4 regencies in the province, together with the city of Yogyakarta, and elects 8 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council.

== Demographics ==
===Language===
Aside from the Indonesian language, the Javanese language is also designated as the official language of the Special Region of Yogyakarta under Yogyakarta Special Region Regulation Number 2 of 2021.

===Religion===
The majority of the population is Muslim, which is 92.94%, the rest are Catholic Christians 4.45%, then Protestant Christians 2.42%, Buddhists 0.08%, Hindus 0.09%, Confucianism and others 0.02%.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Transport ===

Yogyakarta is served by Adisutjipto International Airport and Yogyakarta International Airport, the latter being opened for minimum operations in late April 2019 and fully operational starting late March 2020. There are two main railway stations: Lempuyangan Station and Yogyakarta railway station.

Yogyakarta is considered one of the major hubs that link the west–east main railway route in Java island. Yogyakarta Station is the main train station located in the center, and Lempuyangan Station is the second train station in the city. The two stations have their schedule to and from other cities on Java island. The Prambanan Express commuter rail service operates west of Yogyakarta Station across Kulonprogo Regency to Purworejo, and KAI Commuter Yogyakarta Line electric commuter rail system operates from east of the station to Surakarta. To the south, in the Bantul region, is the Giwangan bus station, one of the largest bus stations in Indonesia. The Yogyakarta metropolitan centre is surrounded by a ring road.

In 2008, the government of the Special Region of Yogyakarta launched a bus rapid transit system, the Trans Jogja, which connects places in and around Yogyakarta City, including the airport and the Prambanan temple. Today, Trans Jogja has reached other points in the south side of the city.

== Education ==
Yogyakarta is home to more than 100 institutions of higher education in Indonesia, the highest number of higher education institutions of any province in Indonesia. Hence, Yogyakarta earned its nickname &quot;Kota Pelajar&quot; (The City of Students).

Yogyakarta is the home of the first established state university in Indonesia, the Gadjah Mada University.

The Special Region is also the home of the first established private university in Indonesia, the Islamic University of Indonesia, which was founded in 1945. The Indonesia Institute of Arts, the first-established university in fine arts, is also in the region. Other large universities include Yogyakarta State University, Sunan Kalijaga State Islamic University, Sanata Dharma University, Muhammadiyah University of Yogyakarta, and the University of Atma Jaya Yogyakarta.

== Sister relationships ==
Yogyakarta Special Region has signed a sister province relationship or friendly ties agreement with the region/state:

* Kyoto Prefecture, Japan
* State of California, United States
* Gyeongsangbuk-do, South Korea
* Tyrol, Austria
* Chiang Mai Province, Thailand

<doc id="164151" wikidata="Q1083702" url="?curid=164151" title="Tong (organization)">
<text>A tong () is a type of organization found among Chinese immigrants predominantly living in the United States, with smaller numbers in Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. In Chinese, the word &quot;tong&quot; means &quot;hall&quot; or &quot;gathering place&quot;. These organizations are described as secret societies or sworn brotherhoods and are often tied to criminal activity. In the 1990s, in most American Chinatowns, clearly marked &quot;tong&quot; halls could easily be found, many of which have had affiliations with Chinese organized crime.

These associations often provide services for Chinatown communities such as immigrant counseling, Chinese schools, and English classes for adults. &quot;Tongs&quot; follow the pattern of secret societies common to southern China and many are connected to a secret society called the &quot;Tiandihui&quot;, which follows this pattern. Other groups worldwide that follow this pattern and are connected with the &quot;Tiandihui&quot; are known as &quot;hui&quot;, &quot;Hongmen&quot;, and triads.

==History==
Tongs first appeared in China in 1644 when the Ming dynasty was overthrown by the Qing dynasty. One of the first tongs was established by the secret society Chee Kung Tong, which aimed to restore the power of the Ming dynasty by removing the new Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty. These Zhigongtang tongs were located in the province of Guangdong, which was home to many of the first Chinese migrants heading to the United States—some of whom would take with them the notion of a tong as an organization to set up there.

===Establishment of tongs in various Asian countries===
After the 17th century, large numbers of Chinese, particularly from the Fujian and Canton areas, migrated to seek their fortunes in Southeast Asia and Taiwan. These Chinese immigrants quickly formed a trader and merchant class in many societies in various Asian countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia.

===Tongs in English-speaking countries===
Before the 1840s, very few Chinese had emigrated to the United States, Canada, or Australia. However, by the mid-19th-century, Chinese immigrant numbers dramatically increased. Beginning with a few hundred immigrants, their numbers increased to an estimated hundreds of thousands of Chinese immigrants.

Former Taiping Heavenly Kingdom military commander Yang Fuqing is alleged to have fled to the United States following the rebel state&#x27;s defeat and started a secret society in Los Angeles.

== Tongs in America ==
After settling in San Francisco and other California cities, Chinese workers were willing to work for lower wages than their American counterparts. Labor unions and American workers discouraged undercutting wages, so many Chinese left and went east. As a result, many Chinese immigrants moved to cities such as New York, Philadelphia, and Boston. Today these cities still have ethnic Chinese communities large enough to have developed Chinatowns. They have also been joined by new immigrants of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

Many Chinese soon organized voluntary benevolent associations for support and protection. These are usually formed by people originating in their district in China, family name, or depending on what native dialect, for example in the case of Hakka speakers, or sworn brotherhoods. The &quot;tongs&quot; provided services for immigrants such as employment and housing opportunities. They also helped resolve individual and group disputes within the community. Many of these volunteer societies did not have the financial ability to fund community events or look after their members, and those that did tended to focus inward and provide help only to their own members. As a result, many tongs with little or no hereditary financial value had to either disband or operate criminal activities such as gambling houses and prostitution. This transformed them from benevolent associations to providers of illegal services. The term &quot;tong&quot; became unfavorably associated with the secret brotherhoods in Chinatowns, and they often battled with other associations in that area. &quot;Tongs&quot; were usually composed of young men, some with criminal backgrounds, or outcasts who had been expelled from their associations. Notably, many of the traditional &quot;tong&quot; activities, such as gambling, were legal in China, but not in North America.

Early Chinese populations in the United States and Canada were overwhelmingly male, especially after sex-restrictive immigration laws were passed in 1882 in the U.S. and 1923 in Canada, respectively (see Chinese Exclusion Act and Chinese Immigration Act, 1923). For this reason tongs participated heavily in importing women from China for both marriage and prostitution. Many of these women did not come to America by choice, and some were deceived and forced into prostitution by procurers. Tongs associated with importing women to America fought over territories and profits. This became known as the &quot;Tong Wars&quot;, which were a series of violent attacks between two branches of the Tong Gang, the Hip Sing Tong and On Leong Tong. The reasons for this conflict vary, from struggles over territory to assassinations of members. The &quot;Tong Wars&quot; of the 19th and early 20th centuries were often based on control of these women. In the early years the &quot;tongs&quot; employed &quot;hatchet men&quot; or &quot;boo how doy&quot; (), also called &quot;highbinders&quot;, as hired killers to fight the street battles that ensued over turf, business and women.

=== San Francisco, California ===
San Francisco was the home of the first Tong in the United States; it formed in reaction to the hostility that Chinese immigrants faced from American workers upon their arrival to America. In Bill Lee&#x27;s memoirs in &quot;The Chinese Playground&quot;, which recalls the activities of the Tong Gang in San Francisco, he states that the oppression Chinese immigrants faced led them to turn to the Tong for protection. While it is true that the Tong offered protection, it is unclear if this protection was forced as a means to gain control of territory for the distribution of the group&#x27;s illicit activities. During the plague outbreak in Chinatown of San Francisco in the 1900s, the Chinese Six Companies recommended the vaccination plan to their members and the tongs. Doubting the effectiveness of vaccinations, many Chinese residents of Chinatown refused inoculations. Several tongs went so far as to threaten harm to those who did get vaccinated, as well as the Chinese leadership that endorsed doing so.

==Structure and aims==
Tongs in North America showed many similarities to the triads of Hong Kong and British colonies in Southeast Asia. These included similar initiation ceremonies and paying respect to the same deities. This is because both are similar organizations that follow the patterns of southern Chinese secret societies and sworn brotherhoods. The triad societies were underground organizations in British colonies that also existed for self-help of members, but spoke of the overthrow of the Qing dynasty. Ko-lin Chin outlined that most tongs have similar organization and have a headquarters where one can find a president, a vice president, a secretary, a treasurer, an auditor, and several elders and public relations administrators. Today their main aims are to care for their members and their respective communities.

<doc id="164153" wikidata="Q140694" url="?curid=164153" title="Alexis de Tocqueville">
<text>Alexis Charles Henri Clérel, comte de Tocqueville (29 July 180516 April 1859), was a French aristocrat, diplomat, political philosopher, and historian. He is best known for his works &quot;Democracy in America&quot; (appearing in two volumes, 1835 and 1840) and &quot;The Old Regime and the Revolution&quot; (1856). In both, he analyzed the living standards and social conditions of individuals as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. &quot;Democracy in America&quot; was published after Tocqueville&#x27;s travels in the United States and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science.

Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830–1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849–1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoléon Bonaparte&#x27;s 2 December 1851 coup and thereafter began work on &quot;The Old Regime and the Revolution&quot;. Tocqueville argued the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. He believed the failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals.

Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government and was sceptical of the extremes of majoritarianism. During his time in parliament, he was first a member of the centre-left before moving to the centre-right, and the complex and restless nature of his liberalism has led to contrasting interpretations and admirers across the political spectrum. For example, &quot;Democracy in America&quot; was interpreted differently across national contexts. In France and the United States, Tocqueville&#x27;s work was seen as liberal, whereas both progressives and conservatives in the British Isles interpreted his work as supporting their own positions.

== Early life ==
Tocqueville came from an old aristocratic Norman family, the great-grandson of the statesman Malesherbes, who was guillotined in 1793. He was the third son of Hervé Louis François Jean Bonaventure Clérel, Count of Tocqueville, an officer of the Constitutional Guard of King Louis XVI, and Louise Madeleine Le Peletier de Rosanbo who, themselves, might have faced the guillotine but for the fall in 1794 of Maximilien Robespierre. Under the Bourbon Restoration, Tocqueville&#x27;s father became a noble peer and prefect. Tocqueville attended the Lycée Fabert in Metz.

== Political career ==
Tocqueville, who despised the July Monarchy (1830–1848), began his political career in 1839. From 1839 to 1851, he served as member of the lower house of parliament for the Manche department (Valognes). He sat on the centre-left, defended abolitionist views and upheld free trade while supporting the colonisation of Algeria carried on by Louis-Philippe&#x27;s regime. In 1842, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

In 1847, Tocqueville sought to found a Young Left (&quot;Jeune Gauche&quot;) party which would advocate wage increases, a progressive tax, and other labor concerns in order to undermine the appeal of the socialists.

=== In the Second Republic ===
After the fall of the July Monarchy in the Revolution of 1848, Tocqueville was elected a member of the Constituent Assembly of 1848, where he became a member of the commission charged with the drafting of the new Constitution of the Second Republic (1848–1851). He defended bicameralism and the election of the President of the Republic by universal suffrage. As the countryside was thought to be more conservative than the labouring population of Paris, he conceived of universal suffrage as a means to counteract the revolutionary spirit of Paris.

During the Second Republic, Tocqueville sided with the Party of Order against the socialists. A few days after the February 1848 insurrection, he anticipated that a violent clash between the Parisian workers&#x27; population led by socialists agitating in favour of a &quot;Democratic and Social Republic&quot; and the conservatives, which included the aristocracy and the rural population, would be inescapable. Indeed, these social tensions eventually exploded in the June Days Uprising of 1848.

Led by General Cavaignac, the suppression of the uprising was supported by Tocqueville, who advocated the &quot;regularization&quot; of the state of siege declared by Cavaignac and other measures promoting suspension of the constitutional order. Between May and September, Tocqueville participated in the Constitutional Commission which wrote the new Constitution. His proposals, such as his amendment about the President and his reelection, reflected lessons he drew from his North American experience.
A supporter of Cavaignac and of the Party of Order, Tocqueville accepted an invitation to enter Odilon Barrot&#x27;s government as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 3 June to 31 October 1849. During the troubled days of June 1849, he pleaded with Interior Minister Jules Armand Dufaure for the reestablishment of the state of siege in the capital and approved the arrest of demonstrators. Tocqueville, who since February 1848 had supported laws restricting political freedoms, approved the two laws voted immediately after the June 1849 days which restricted the liberty of clubs and freedom of the press.

This active support in favour of laws restricting political freedoms stands in contrast of his defence of freedoms in &quot;Democracy in America&quot;. According to Tocqueville, he favoured order as &quot;the &quot;sine qua non&quot; for the conduct of serious politics. He [hoped] to bring the kind of stability to French political life that would permit the steady growth of liberty unimpeded by the regular rumblings of the earthquakes of revolutionary change″.

=== Opposition to Louis Napoleon ===
Tocqueville had supported Cavaignac against Louis Napoléon Bonaparte for the presidential election of 1848. Opposed to Louis Napoléon Bonaparte&#x27;s 2 December 1851 coup which followed his election, Tocqueville was among the deputies who gathered at the 10th arrondissement of Paris in an attempt to resist the coup and have Napoleon III judged for &quot;high treason&quot; as he had violated the constitutional limit on terms of office. Detained at Vincennes and then released, Tocqueville, who supported the Restoration of the Bourbons against Napoleon III&#x27;s Second Empire (1851–1871), quit political life and retreated to his castle ().

Against this image of Tocqueville, biographer Joseph Epstein concluded: &quot;Tocqueville could never bring himself to serve a man he considered a usurper and despot. He fought as best he could for the political liberty in which he so ardently believed—had given it, in all, thirteen years of his life ... . He would spend the days remaining to him fighting the same fight, but conducting it now from libraries, archives, and his own desk.&quot; There, he began the draft of , publishing the first tome in 1856 but leaving the second one unfinished.

== Travels ==

=== North America ===
In 1831, Tocqueville obtained from the July Monarchy a mission to examine prisons and penitentiaries in the United States and proceeded there with his lifelong friend Gustave de Beaumont. While they did visit some prisons, Tocqueville and Beaumont traveled widely in the United States: from the east-coast cities to what was then the north-west frontier, Michigan; by steamboat down the Ohio and Mississippi to New Orleans; and by stagecoach across the South back toward the east coast and north to New York. Tocqueville also made a side trip to Montreal and Quebec City. Throughout his trip, he took extensive notes on his observations and reflections. He returned within nine months and published a report, &quot;The Penitentiary System in the United States&quot;, although the more well-known result of his tour was his major work &quot;Democracy in America&quot;, which appeared in 1835. Beaumont also wrote an account of their travels in &quot;Jacksonian America: Marie or Slavery in the United States&quot; (1835).

=== England and Ireland ===
Tocqueville returned to France in February 1832. Before putting the finishing touches to his reflections on American democracy, he departed for England in 1833. Tocqueville had a private reason for crossing the Channel: to meet the family of Mary Mottley, a young woman he had met at Versailles. The couple were married in 1836. He stayed five weeks in England, eager to observe what many imagined as the dawning of the age of democracy, the passage of the Parliamentary Reform Act. Tocqueville concluded that there was &quot;a good chance for the English to succeed in modifying the social and political set-up ... without violent convulsions&quot;. The English aristocracy was open to new recruits. He suggested that the difference with the French was &quot;clear from the use of one word&quot; as &quot;&quot;gentleman&quot; in English applies to any well-educated man, regardless of birth, whereas in France &quot;gentilhomme&quot; can only be used of a noble by birth&quot;.

In May 1835, Tocqueville returned to England but then in summer with Beaumont travelled on to Ireland. then subordinate to Great Britain under the crown of the United Kingdom. He found a country having &quot;all the evils of an aristocracy and none of its advantages&quot;. There was &quot;no moral tie between rich and poor; the difference of political opinion of religious belief and the actual distance they live apart make them strangers one to the other, one could almost say enemies&quot;. In this circumstance he remarked on the &quot;unbelievable unity between the Irish clergy and the Catholic population&quot;. The people looked to the clergy, and the clergy &quot;rebuffed&quot; by the &quot;upper classes&quot; (&quot;Protestants and enemies&quot;), had &quot;turned all its attention to the lower classes; it has the same instincts, the same interests and the same passions as the people; [a] state of affairs altogether peculiar to Ireland&quot;.

Back in England, Tocqueville found confirmation of a close connection between centralisation and democratisation. He observed that in England centralisation took a form less absolute than in France. It was of &quot;legislation and not administration&quot;, and co-existed with a &quot;spirit of [civic] association&quot; that in responding to specific and local issues narrowed the range of government intervention. Tocqueville had intended the joint impressions of their trip to Britain and Ireland would form the basis of a work by Beaumont, just as their common reflections of the United States on had served as him as material for &quot;Democracy in America&quot;. Beaumont did produce &quot;L’Irlande sociale, politique et religieuse&quot; (1839)&quot;.&quot; Much praised by Daniel O’Connell, the first sentence of its historical introduction read: &quot;The dominion of the English in Ireland, from their invasion of the country in 1169, to the close of the last century, has been nothing but a tyranny.&quot;

=== Algeria ===
In 1841 and 1846, Tocqueville traveled to Algeria which France had invaded and colonised from 1830. Having himself entertained the possibility of settling in Algeria as a colonist, from his election to the Chamber of Deputies in 1839 Tocqueville had come to be seen as the parliament&#x27;s foremost expert on the colony. In 1837, he had written of his hope for eventual intermarriage between the French and indigenous Arabs and their amalgamation into a distinct whole. Following the first of his two visits to Algeria (again accompanied by Beaumont), his position was reversed. When it came to the French colonists, he &quot;displayed his usual liberalism&quot;, as he criticised the &quot;coarseness and violence&quot; of the military rule to which they too were subject. Yet from what he observed of Algerian society, including what he understood as &quot;the absence of all political life&quot;, he was persuaded that not only could its violent subjugation be justified but also that its result could not, and should never, be assimilation of the indigenous people into the civil and political life of France.

== Death ==
A longtime sufferer from bouts of tuberculosis, Tocqueville eventually succumbed to the disease on 16 April 1859 and was buried in the Tocqueville cemetery in Normandy. He was survived by his English wife of 23 years, Mary Mottley. Although she was &quot;too liberal ... too Protestant, too middle-class, and too English&quot; for some in his family, de Tocqueville described Mottley as perhaps his only true friend. While they had hoped for a family, they had no children.

In advance of their marriage, Mottley converted to Roman Catholicism, Tocqueville&#x27;s professed religion, before their marriage. While she appeared to be comparatively devout, Tocqueville&#x27;s own attitude toward religion has been described as &quot;utilitarian&quot;, regarding it as a &quot;social cement, a safety valve for passions that might otherwise feed a revolutionary torrent dangerous to individual liberty&quot;. Provided it was separated from state power, Tocqueville did not believe that his church was bound to be anti-democratic.

== &quot;Democracy in America&quot; ==
In &quot;Democracy in America&quot;, published in 1835, Tocqueville wrote of the New World and its burgeoning democratic order. Observing from the perspective of a detached social scientist, Tocqueville wrote of his travels through the United States in the early 19th century when the Market Revolution, Western expansion and Jacksonian democracy were radically transforming the fabric of American life.

According to political scientist Joshua Kaplan, one purpose of writing &quot;Democracy in America&quot; was to help the people of France get a better understanding of their position between a fading aristocratic order and an emerging democratic order and to help them sort out the confusion. Tocqueville saw democracy as an enterprise that balanced liberty and equality, concern for the individual as well as for the community. On a negative note, Tocqueville remarked that &quot;in democracies manners are never so refined as amongst aristocratic nations.&quot; 
Tocqueville was an ardent supporter of liberty. He wrote: &quot;I have a passionate love for liberty, law, and respect for rights. I am neither of the revolutionary party nor of the conservative. ... Liberty is my foremost passion.&quot; He wrote of &quot;Political Consequences of the Social State of the Anglo-Americans&quot; by saying: &quot;But one also finds in the human heart a depraved taste for equality, which impels the weak to want to bring the strong down to their level, and which reduces men to preferring equality in servitude to inequality in freedom.&quot;

The above is often misquoted as a slavery quote because of previous translations of the French text. The most recent translation by Arthur Goldhammer in 2004 translates the meaning to be as stated above. Examples of misquoted sources are numerous on the internet such as &quot;Americans are so enamored of equality that they would rather be equal in slavery than unequal in freedom&quot;, but the text does not contain the words &quot;Americans were so enamored by equality&quot; anywhere.

His view on government reflects his belief in liberty and the need for individuals to be able to act freely while respecting others&#x27; rights. Of centralized government, he wrote that it &quot;excels in preventing, not doing&quot;. Tocqueville continues to comment on equality by saying: &quot;Furthermore, when citizens are all almost equal, it becomes difficult for them to defend their independence against the aggressions of power. As none of them is strong enough to fight alone with advantage, the only guarantee of liberty is for everyone to combine forces. But such a combination is not always in evidence&quot;.

Tocqueville explicitly cites inequality as being incentive for the poor to become rich and observes that it is not often that two generations within a family maintain success and that it is inheritance laws that split and eventually break apart someone&#x27;s estate that cause a constant cycle of churn between the poor and the rich, thereby over generations making the poor rich and the rich poor. He cites protective laws in France at the time that protected an estate from being split apart among heirs, thereby preserving wealth and preventing a churn of wealth such as was perceived by him in 1835 within the United States.

=== On civil and political society and the individual ===

Tocqueville&#x27;s main purpose was to analyze the functioning of political society and various forms of political associations, although he brought some reflections on civil society too (and relations between political and civil society). For Tocqueville, as for Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Karl Marx, civil society was a sphere of private entrepreneurship and civilian affairs regulated by civil code. As a critic of individualism, Tocqueville thought that through associating for mutual purpose, both in public and private, Americans are able to overcome selfish desires, thus making both a self-conscious and active political society and a vibrant civil society functioning according to political and civil laws of the state.

According to political scientist Joshua Kaplan, Tocqueville did not originate the concept of individualism, instead he changed its meaning and saw it as a &quot;calm and considered feeling which disposes each citizen to isolate himself from the mass of his fellows and to withdraw into the circle of family and friends ... . [W]ith this little society formed to his taste, he gladly leaves the greater society to look for itself.&quot; While Tocqueville saw egotism and selfishness as vices, he saw individualism not as a failure of feeling but as a way of thinking about things which could have either positive consequences such as a willingness to work together, or negative consequences such as isolation and that individualism could be remedied by improved understanding.

When individualism was a positive force and prompted people to work together for common purposes and seen as &quot;self-interest properly understood&quot;, then it helped to counterbalance the danger of the tyranny of the majority since people could &quot;take control over their own lives&quot; without government aid. According to Kaplan, Americans have a difficult time accepting Tocqueville&#x27;s criticism of the stifling intellectual effect of the &quot;omnipotence of the majority&quot; and that Americans tend to deny that there is a problem in this regard. Others such as the Catholic writer Daniel Schwindt disagree with Kaplan&#x27;s interpretation, arguing instead that Tocqueville saw individualism as just another form of egotism and not an improvement over it. To make his case, Schwindt provides citations such as the following:Egoism springs from a blind instinct; individualism from wrong-headed thinking rather than from depraved feelings. It originates as much from defects of intelligence as from the mistakes of the heart. Egoism blights the seeds of every virtue; individualism at first dries up only the source of public virtue. In the longer term it attacks and destroys all the others and will finally merge with egoism.

=== On democracy and new forms of tyranny ===

Tocqueville warned that modern democracy may be adept at inventing new forms of tyranny because radical equality could lead to the materialism of an expanding bourgeoisie and to the selfishness of individualism. &quot;In such conditions, we might become so enamored with &#x27;a relaxed love of present enjoyments&#x27; that we lose interest in the future of our descendants...and meekly allow ourselves to be led in ignorance by a despotic force all the more powerful because it does not resemble one&quot;, wrote &quot;The New Yorker&quot;&#x27;s James Wood. Tocqueville worried that if despotism were to take root in a modern democracy, it would be a much more dangerous version than the oppression under the Roman emperors or tyrants of the past who could only exert a pernicious influence on a small group of people at a time.

In contrast, a despotism under a democracy could see &quot;a multitude of men&quot;, uniformly alike, equal, &quot;constantly circling for petty pleasures&quot;, unaware of fellow citizens and subject to the will of a powerful state which exerted an &quot;immense protective power&quot;. Tocqueville compared a potentially despotic democratic government to a protective parent who wants to keep its citizens (children) as &quot;perpetual children&quot; and which does not break men&#x27;s wills but rather guides it and presides over people in the same way as a shepherd looking after a &quot;flock of timid animals&quot;.

=== On the American social contract ===
Tocqueville&#x27;s penetrating analysis sought to understand the peculiar nature of American political life. In describing the American, he agreed with thinkers such as Aristotle and Montesquieu that the balance of property determined the balance of political power; however, his conclusions differed radically from those of his predecessors. Tocqueville tried to understand why the United States was so different from Europe in the last throes of aristocracy. In contrast to the aristocratic ethic, the United States was a society where hard work and money-making was the dominant ethic, where the common man enjoyed a level of dignity which was unprecedented, where commoners never deferred to elites and where what he described as crass individualism and market capitalism had taken root to an extraordinary degree.

Tocqueville writes: &quot;Among a democratic people, where there is no hereditary wealth, every man works to earn a living. ... Labor is held in honor; the prejudice is not against but in its favor.&quot; Tocqueville asserted that the values that had triumphed in the North and were present in the South had begun to suffocate old-world ethics and social arrangements. Legislatures abolished primogeniture and entails, resulting in more widely distributed land holdings. This was a contrast to the general aristocratic pattern in which only the eldest child, usually a man, inherited the estate, which had the effect of keeping large estates intact from generation to generation.

In contrast, landed elites in the United States were less likely to pass on fortunes to a single child by the action of primogeniture, which meant that as time went by large estates became broken up within a few generations which in turn made the children more equal overall. According to Joshua Kaplan&#x27;s Tocqueville, it was not always a negative development since bonds of affection and shared experience between children often replaced the more formal relation between the eldest child and the siblings, characteristic of the previous aristocratic pattern. Overall, hereditary fortunes in the new democracies became exceedingly difficult to secure and more people were forced to struggle for their own living.
As Tocqueville understood it, this rapidly democratizing society had a population devoted to &quot;middling&quot; values which wanted to amass through hard work vast fortunes. In Tocqueville&#x27;s mind, this explained why the United States was so different from Europe. In Europe, he claimed, nobody cared about making money. The lower classes had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth while the upper classes found it crass, vulgar and unbecoming of their sort to care about something as unseemly as money and many were virtually guaranteed wealth and took it for granted. At the same time in the United States, workers would see people fashioned in exquisite attire and merely proclaim that through hard work they too would soon possess the fortune necessary to enjoy such luxuries.

=== On majority rule and mediocrity ===
Beyond the eradication of old-world aristocracy, ordinary Americans also refused to defer to those possessing, as Tocqueville put it, superior talent and intelligence, and these natural elites could not enjoy much share in political power as a result. Ordinary Americans enjoyed too much power and claimed too great a voice in the public sphere to defer to intellectual superiors. Tocqueville argued that this culture promoted a relatively pronounced equality, but the same mores and opinions that ensured such equality also promoted mediocrity. Those who possessed true virtue and talent were left with limited choices.

Tocqueville said that those with the most education and intelligence were left with two choices. They could join limited intellectual circles to explore the weighty and complex problems facing society, or they could use their superior talents to amass vast fortunes in the private sector. He wrote that he did not know of any country where there was &quot;less independence of mind, and true freedom of discussion, than in America&quot;.

Tocqueville blamed the omnipotence of majority rule as a chief factor in stifling thinking: &quot;The majority has enclosed thought within a formidable fence. A writer is free inside that area, but woe to the man who goes beyond it, not that he stands in fear of an inquisition, but he must face all kinds of unpleasantness in every day persecution. A career in politics is closed to him for he has offended the only power that holds the keys.&quot; According to Kaplan&#x27;s interpretation of Tocqueville, he argued in contrast to previous political thinkers that a serious problem in political life was not that people were too strong but that people were &quot;too weak&quot; and felt &quot;swept up in something that they could not control&quot;.

=== On enslavement, black people, and Indigenous communities ===
Uniquely positioned at a crossroads in American history, Tocqueville&#x27;s &quot;Democracy in America&quot; attempted to capture the essence of American culture and values. Although a supporter of colonialism, Tocqueville could clearly perceive the evils that black people and natives had been subjected to in the United States. Tocqueville devoted the last chapter of the first volume of &quot;Democracy in America&quot; to the question, while his travel companion Gustave de Beaumont wholly focused on slavery and its fallouts for the American nation in &quot;Marie or Slavery in America&quot;. Tocqueville observes among the American races: 

Tocqueville contrasted the settlers of Virginia with the middle class, religious Puritans who founded New England and analyzed the debasing influence of slavery: 

Tocqueville maintained that the friction between races in America was deeper than merely the issue of slavery, even going so far as to say that discrimination against African Americans was worse in states where slavery was outlawed:

Tocqueville concluded that return of the Black population to Africa could not resolve the problem, as he writes at the end of &quot;Democracy in America&quot;: 

In 1855, Tocqueville wrote the following text published by Maria Weston Chapman in the &quot;Liberty Bell: Testimony against Slavery&quot;: 

French historian of colonialism Olivier Le Cour Grandmaison argues that Tocqueville (along with Jules Michelet) was ahead of his time in his use of the term &quot;extermination&quot; to describe what was happening during the colonization of Western United States and the Indian removal period.

=== On policies of assimilation ===
According to Tocqueville, assimilation of black people would be almost impossible, as was already being demonstrated in the Northern states; however, assimilation was the best solution for Native Americans, and since they were too proud to assimilate, they would inevitably become extinct. Displacement was another part of America&#x27;s Indian policy. Both populations were &quot;undemocratic&quot;, or without the qualities, intellectual and otherwise, needed to live in a democracy. Tocqueville shared many views on assimilation and segregation of his and the coming epochs but opposed Arthur de Gobineau&#x27;s theories as found in &quot;An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races&quot; (1853–1855).

=== On the United States and Russia as future global powers ===
In his &quot;Democracy in America&quot;, Tocqueville also forecast the preeminence of the United States and Russia as the two main global powers. In his book, he stated: &quot;There are now two great nations in the world, which starting from different points, seem to be advancing toward the same goal: the Russians and the Anglo-Americans. ... Each seems called by some secret design of Providence one day to hold in its hands the destinies of half the world.&quot;

=== On civil jury service ===
Tocqueville believed that the American jury system was particularly important in educating citizens in self-government and rule of law. He often expressed how the civil jury system was one of the most effective showcases of democracy because it connected citizens with the true spirit of the justice system. In his 1835 treatise &quot;Democracy in America&quot;, he explained: &quot;The jury, and more especially the civil jury, serves to communicate the spirit of the judges to the minds of all the citizens; and this spirit, with the habits which attend it, is the soundest preparation for free institutions. ... It invests each citizen with a kind of magistracy; it makes them all feel the duties which they are bound to discharge toward society; and the part which they take in the Government.&quot;

Tocqueville believed that jury service not only benefited the society as a whole but also enhanced jurors&#x27; qualities as citizens. Because of the jury system, &quot;they were better informed about the rule of law, and they were more closely connected to the state. Thus, quite independently of what the jury contributed to dispute resolution, participation on the jury had salutary effects on the jurors themselves.&quot;

== Views on Algeria ==

Alexis de Tocqueville was an important figure in the colonization of Algeria. A member of French parliament during the French conquest of Algeria and subsequent July Monarchy, Tocqueville took it upon himself to become an expert on the Algeria question, and to this end penned a number of discourses and letters. He also made a point of studying Islam, the Quran, and the Arabic language, in order to better understand the country.

=== 1837 letters on Algeria ===
In a series of letters penned by Alexis de Tocqueville, he describes the situation of France as well as the geography and society of Algeria at the time.

Despite being initially critical of the French invasion of Algeria, Toccqueville also believed that geopolitical necessities of the time would not allow for a withdrawal of military forces for two reasons: first, his understanding of the international situation and France&#x27;s position in the world; and second, changes in French society. Tocqueville believed that war and colonization would &quot;restore national pride; threatened&quot;, he believed, by &quot;the gradual softening of social mores&quot; in the middle classes. Their taste for &quot;material pleasures&quot; was spreading to the whole of society, giving it &quot;an example of weakness and egotism&quot;.

=== 1841 discourse on the conquest of Algeria ===
Tocqueville expressed himself in an 1841 essay concerning the conquest of Algeria in which he called for a dual program of &quot;domination&quot; and &quot;colonization&quot;.

Applauding the methods of General Bugeaud, Tocqueville went so far to claim that &quot;war in Africa is a science. Everyone is familiar with its rules and everyone can apply those rules with almost complete certainty of success. One of the greatest services that Field Marshal Bugeaud has rendered his country is to have spread, perfected and made everyone aware of this new science.&quot; Tocqueville advocated racial segregation as a form of consociationalism in Algeria with two distinct legislations, one for European colonists and one for the Arab population.

Such a two-tier arrangement would be fully realised with the 1870 Crémieux decree and the Indigenousness Code, which extended French citizenship to European settlers and Algerian Jews whereas Muslim Algerians would be governed under the Code de l&#x27;indigénat; however Tocqueville hoped for an eventual mixing of the French and Arab populations into a single body:

=== Opposition to the invasion of Kabylia ===

In opposition to Olivier Le Cour Grandmaison, Jean-Louis Benoît said that given the extent of racial prejudices during the colonization of Algeria, Tocqueville was one of its &quot;most moderate supporters&quot;. Benoît said that it was wrong to assume Tocqueville was a supporter of Bugeaud despite his 1841 apologetic discourse. It seems that Tocqueville modified his views after his second visit to Algeria in 1846 as he criticized Bugeaud&#x27;s desire to invade Kabylia in an 1847 speech to the Assembly. Although Tocqueville had favoured retention of distinct traditional law, administrators, schools and so on for Arabs who had come under French control, he compared the Berber tribes of Kabylia (in his second of &quot;Two Letters on Algeria&quot;, 1837) to Rousseau&#x27;s concept of the &quot;noble savage&quot;, stating:

If Rousseau had known the Kabyles ... he would not have spouted so much nonsense about the Caribbean and other American Indians: He would have looked to the Atlas for his models; there he would have found men who are subject to a kind of social police and yet almost as free as the isolated individual who enjoys his wild independence in the depths of the woods; men who are neither rich nor poor, neither servants nor masters; who appoint their own chiefs, and scarcely notice that they have chiefs, who are content with their state and remain in it

Tocqueville&#x27;s views on the matter were complex. Although in his 1841 report on Algeria he applauded Bugeaud for making war in a way that defeated Abd-el-Kader&#x27;s resistance, he had advocated in the &quot;Two Letters&quot; that the French military advance leave Kabylia undisturbed and in subsequent speeches and writings he continued to oppose intrusion into Kabylia. In the debate about the 1846 extraordinary funds, Tocqueville denounced Bugeaud&#x27;s conduct of military operations and succeeded in convincing the Assembly not to vote funds in support of Bugeaud&#x27;s military columns. Tocqueville considered Bugeaud&#x27;s plan to invade Kabylia despite the opposition of the Assembly as a seditious act in the face of which the government was opting for cowardice.

=== 1847 &quot;Report on Algeria&quot; ===
In his 1847 &quot;Report on Algeria&quot;, Tocqueville declared that Europe should avoid making the same mistake they made with the European colonization of the Americas in order to avoid the bloody consequences. More particularly he reminds his countrymen of a solemn caution whereby he warns them that if the methods used towards the Algerian people remain unchanged, colonization will end in a blood bath. Tocqueville includes in his report on Algeria that the fate of their soldiers and finances depended on how the French government treats the various native populations of Algeria, including the various Arab tribes, independent Kabyles living in the Atlas Mountains and the powerful political leader Abd-el-Kader. The latter stresses the obtainment and protection of land and passageways that promise commercial wealth. In the case of Algeria, the Port of Algiers and the control over the Strait of Gibraltar were considered by Tocqueville to be particularly valuable whereas direct control of the political operations of the entirety of Algeria was not. Thus, the author stresses domination over only certain points of political influence as a means to colonization of commercially valuable areas.

Tocqueville argued that although unpleasant, domination via violent means is necessary for colonization and justified by the laws of war. Such laws are not discussed in detail; however, given that the goal of the French mission in Algeria was to obtain commercial and military interest as opposed to self-defense, it can be deduced that Tocqueville would not concur with just war theory&#x27;s &quot;jus ad bellum&quot; criteria of just cause. Furthermore, given that Tocqueville approved of the use of force to eliminate civilian housing in enemy territory, his approach does not accord with just war theory&#x27;s &quot;jus in bello&quot; criteria of proportionality and discrimination.

== &quot;The Old Regime and the Revolution&quot; ==

In 1856, Tocqueville published &quot;The Old Regime and the Revolution&quot;. The book analyzes French society before the French Revolution—the &quot;ancien régime&quot;—and investigates the forces that caused the Revolution.

== References in popular literature ==
Tocqueville was quoted in several chapters of Toby Young&#x27;s memoirs &quot;How to Lose Friends and Alienate People&quot; to explain his observation of widespread homogeneity of thought even amongst intellectual elites at Harvard University during his time spent there. He is frequently quoted and studied in American history classes. Tocqueville is the inspiration for Australian novelist Peter Carey in his 2009 novel &quot;Parrot and Olivier in America&quot;. Tocqueville and his memoir &quot;Recollections&quot; are mentioned in Ada Palmer&#x27;s novel &quot;Too Like the Lightning&quot; to describe someone with divided loyalty.
