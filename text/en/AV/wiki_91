<text>The Australian Senate is the upper house of the bicameral Parliament of Australia, the lower house being the House of Representatives.

The powers, role and composition of the Senate are set out in Chapter I of the federal constitution as well as federal legislation and constitutional convention. There are a total of 76 senators: twelve are elected from each of the six Australian states, regardless of population, and two each representing the Australian Capital Territory (including the Jervis Bay Territory and Norfolk Island) and the Northern Territory (including the Australian Indian Ocean Territories). Senators are popularly elected under the single transferable vote system of proportional representation in state-wide and territory-wide districts. 

Section 24 of the Constitution provides that the House of Representatives shall have, as near as practicable, twice as many members as the Senate. The constitution grants the Senate nearly equivalent powers to the House, with the exception that the Senate may not originate or amend money bills, but only reject or defer them. According to convention, the Senate plays no role in the formation of the executive government and the prime minister is drawn from the majority party or coalition in the House. However, the government appoints a Senate leader and senators hold senior roles in the government as ministers of state and members of cabinet. Senators from the opposition likewise serve in the shadow ministry.

The Senate elects one of its members to serve as president, who exercises only an ordinary vote and has no casting vote. Since the late 20th century, it has been rare for governments to hold a majority in the Senate and the balance of power has typically rested with minor parties and independents. In practice, this means government bills cannot be assured of passage and regulations may be disallowed. The power to bring down the government and force elections by blocking supply also exists, as happened for the first and only time during the 1975 constitutional crisis. Since major reforms in 1970, the Senate&#x27;s role as a house of review has increased with the expansion of its committee system.

Senators from states ordinarily serve six-year terms, with half of the Senate up for re-election at each federal election along with the entirety of the House of Representatives. However, there is no constitutional requirement that Senate and House elections occur at the same time; the last Senate-only and House-only elections occurred in 1970 and 1972 respectively. The terms of senators from territories expire at the dissolution of the House of Representatives, typically at three-year intervals. Section 57 of the constitution provides for a double dissolution as a mechanism to break deadlocks between the House and Senate, whereby the entire Senate is dissolved and all seats made vacant.

Casual vacancies are filled by the relevant state or territory parliament, or by the corresponding state or territory government on an interim basis if the parliament is not in session. A constitutional amendment passed in 1977 provides that casual vacancies must be filled by a member of the same political party as the previous senator.

==Origins and role==

The Constitution of Australia established the Senate as the second chamber of the national parliament of the newly federated Australia. In contrast to countries employing a pure Westminster system the Senate plays an active role in legislation and is not merely a chamber of review. Instead of being modelled solely after the House of Lords, as the Senate of Canada was, the Australian Senate was in part modelled after the United States Senate, by giving equal representation to each state and almost equal powers with the lower house. This was done to give less populous states a real influence in the Parliament, while also maintaining the traditional review functions upper houses have in the Westminster system. This has led to the description of a &quot;Washminster system&quot; to describe the Australian political structure.

Although the prime minister and treasurer, by convention (though not legal requirement), are members of the House of Representatives (after John Gorton was appointed prime minister in 1968, he resigned from the Senate and was elected to the House), other ministers may come from either house, and the two Houses have almost equal legislative power. As with most upper chambers in bicameral parliaments, the Senate cannot introduce or amend appropriation bills (bills that authorise government expenditure of public revenue) or bills that impose taxation, that role being reserved for the lower house; it can only approve, reject or defer them (as famously occurred in the lead up to the Dismissal). That degree of equality between the Senate and House of Representatives reflects the desire of the Constitution&#x27;s authors to prevent the more populous states totally dominating the legislative process.

In practice, however, most legislation (except for private member&#x27;s bills) in the Australian Parliament is initiated by the government, which has control over the lower house. It is then passed to the Senate, which has the opportunity to amend the bill, pass or reject it. In the majority of cases, voting takes place along party lines, although there are occasional conscience votes.

The Senate maintains a number of committees, which engage in a wide variety of inquiries. The results have no direct legislative power, but are valuable forums that raise many points of view that would otherwise not receive government or public notice.

==Electoral system==
The system for electing senators has changed several times since Federation. The original arrangement involved a first-past-the-post and block voting system, on a state-by-state basis. This was replaced in 1919 by preferential block voting. Block voting tended to produce landslide majorities. For instance, from 1920 to 1923 the Nationalist Party held all but one of the 36 seats, and from 1947 to 1950, the Australian Labor Party held all but three.

In 1948, single transferable vote with proportional representation on a state-by-state basis became the method for electing senators. At this time the number of senators was expanded from 36 to 60 and it was argued that a move to proportional representation was needed to even up the balance between both major parties in the chamber. The change in voting systems has been described as an &quot;institutional revolution&quot; that has had the effect of limiting the government&#x27;s ability to control the chamber, as well as helping the rise of Australian minor parties.

The 1984 election saw the introduction of group ticket voting, in order to reduce a high rate of informal voting that arose from the requirement that each candidate be given a preference, and to allow small parties and independent candidates a reasonable chance of winning a seat. This allowed voters to select a single party to distribute their preferences on their behalf (voting &quot;above the line&quot;), but voters were still able to vote directly for individual candidates and distribute their own preferences if they wished (voting &quot;below the line&quot;) by numbering every box. Following 1981, the government has only had a majority in the Senate from 2005–2007; otherwise, negotiations with other parties and independents have generally been necessary to pass legislation.

Group tickets were abolished in advance of the 2016 election to reduce the number of senators elected with a very small number of first preference votes as a result of the candidates of these micro-parties preferencing each other. In the place of group tickets, a form of optional preferential voting was introduced. As a result of the changes, voters may now assign their preferences for parties above the line (numbering as many boxes as they wish), or individual candidates below the line, and are not required to fill all of the boxes. Both above and below the line voting now use optional preferential voting. For above the line, voters are instructed to number at least their first six preferences; however, a &quot;savings provision&quot; is in place to ensure that ballots will still be counted if less than six are given. For below the line, voters are required to number at least their first 12 preferences. Voters are free to continue numbering as many preferences as they like beyond the minimum number specified. Another savings provision allows ballot papers with at least 6 below the line preferences to be formal. The voting changes make it more difficult for new small parties and independent candidates to be elected to the Senate, but also allow a voter to voluntarily exhaust preferences — that is, to ensure their vote cannot flow to specific candidates or parties — if none of the voter&#x27;s candidate preferences are elected.

The changes were subject to a challenge in front of High Court of Australia by sitting South Australian Senator Bob Day of the Family First Party. The senator argued that the changes meant the senators would not be &quot;directly chosen by the people&quot; as required by the constitution. The High Court rejected Day&#x27;s challenge unanimously, deciding that both above the line and below the line voting were consistent with the constitution.

===Ballot paper===
The Australian Senate voting paper under the single transferable vote proportional representation system resembles the following example (shown in two parts), which shows the candidates for Victorian senate representation in the 2016 federal election.

To vote correctly, electors must either:
* Vote for at least six parties above the thick black line, by writing the numbers 1–6 in party boxes. Votes with fewer than six boxes numbered are still admitted to the count through savings provisions.
* Vote for at least twelve candidates below the thick black line, by writing the numbers 1–12 in the individual candidates&#x27; boxes. Votes with between six and twelve boxes numbered are still admitted to the count through savings provisions.

Because each state elects six senators at each half-Senate election, the quota for election is only one-seventh or 14.3% (one third or 33.3% for territories, where only two senators are elected). Once a candidate has been elected with votes reaching the quota amount, any votes they receive in addition to this may be distributed to other candidates as preferences, if there are still open seats to fill.

With an odd number of seats in a half-Senate election (3 or 5), 50.1% of the vote wins a majority (2/3) or (3/5).

With an even number of seats in a half-Senate election (6), 57.1% of the vote is needed to win a majority of seats (4/6).

The ungrouped candidates in the far right column do not have a box above the line. Therefore, they can only get a primary (number 1) vote from electors who vote below the line. For this reason, some independents register as a group, either with other independents or by themselves, such as group B in the above example.

Names of parties can be shown only if the parties are registered, which requires, among other things, a minimum of 1,500 members.

=== Order of parties ===
The order of parties on the ballot papers and the order of ungrouped candidates are determined by a random ballot conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission.

=== Deposit ===
Candidates, parties and groups pay a deposit of $2,000 per candidate, which is forfeited if they fail to achieve 4% of the primary vote.

=== Public subsidy ===
Candidates, parties and groups earn a public subsidy if they gain at least 4% of the primary vote. At the 2019 federal election, funding was $2.756 per formal first preference vote.

==Membership==
Under sections 7 and 8 of the Australian Constitution:
* The Senate must comprise an equal number of senators from each original state,
* each original state shall have at least six senators, and
* the Senate must be elected in a way that is not discriminatory among the states.

These conditions have periodically been the source of debate, and within these conditions, the composition and rules of the Senate have varied significantly since federation.

===Size and nexus===
Under Section 24 of the Constitution, the number of members of the House of Representatives has to be &quot;as nearly as practicable&quot; double the number of senators.

The reasons for the nexus are twofold: a desire to maintain a constant influence for the smaller states, and maintain a constant balance of the two Houses in the event of a joint sitting after a double dissolution. A referendum in 1967 to eliminate the nexus was rejected.

The size of the Senate has changed over the years. The Constitution originally provided for six senators for each state, resulting in a total of 36 senators.

The Constitution permits the Parliament to increase the number of senators, provided that equal numbers of senators from each original state are maintained; accordingly, in 1948, Senate representation was increased from 6 to 10 senators for each state, increasing the total to 60.

In 1975, the two territories, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, were given an entitlement to elect two senators each for the first time, bringing the number to 64. The senators from the Northern Territory also represent constituents from Australia&#x27;s Indian Ocean Territories (Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands), while the senators from the Australian Capital Territory also represent voters from the Jervis Bay Territory and since 1 July 2016, Norfolk Island.

The latest expansion in Senate numbers took place in 1984, when the number of senators from each state was increased from 10 to 12, resulting in a total of 76 senators.

===Term===
Senators normally serve fixed six-year terms (from 1 July to 30 June). At most federal elections, the seats of 40 of the 76 senators (half of the 72 senators from the six states and all four of the senators from the territories) are contested, along with the entire House of Representatives; such an election is sometimes known as a half-Senate election. The seats of senators representing states elected at a half-Senate election are not contested at the next election, provided it is a half-Senate election. However, under some circumstances, the entire Senate (and the House of Representatives) is dissolved, in what is known as a double dissolution. Following a double dissolution, half the senators representing states serve terms ending on the third 30 June following the election (two to three years) and the rest serve a five to six-year term. Section 13 of the Constitution requires the Senate to allocate long and short terms amongst its members. The term of senators representing a territory expires at the same time as there is an election for the House of Representatives.

Section 13 of the Constitution requires that in half-Senate elections, the election of State senators shall take place within one year before the places become vacant. The actual election date is determined by the Governor of each State, who acts on the advice of the State Premier. The Governors almost always act on the recommendation of the Governor-General, with the last independent Senate election writ being issued by the Governor of Queensland during the Gair Affair in 1974.

Slightly more than half of the Senate is contested at each general election (half of the 72 state senators, and all four of the territory senators), along with the entire House of Representatives. Except in the case of a double dissolution, senators for the states are elected for fixed terms of six years, commencing on 1 July following the election, and ceasing on 30 June six years later.

The term of the four senators from the territories is not fixed, but is defined by the dates of the general elections for the House of Representatives, the period between which can vary greatly, to a maximum of three years and three months. Territory senators commence their terms on the day that they are elected. Their terms expire the day prior to the following general election day.

While there is no constitutional requirement for the election of senators to take place at the same time as those for members of the House of Representatives, the government usually synchronises the dates of elections for the Senate and House of Representatives. However, because their terms do not coincide, the incoming Parliament will for some time comprise the new House of Representatives and the old Senate, except for the senators representing the territories, until the new senators start their term on the next 1 July.

Following a double dissolution, all 76 senators face re-election. If there is an early House election outside the 12-month period in which Senate elections can occur, the synchronisation of the election will be disrupted, and there can be half-Senate elections without a concurrent House election. The last time this occurred was on 21 November 1970.

===Quota size===
The number of votes that a candidate must receive to be elected to the senate is referred to as a &quot;quota&quot;. The quota is worked out by dividing the number of formal votes by one more than the number of vacancies to be filled and then adding one to the result. The 2019 senate election was a half senate election, so 6 senate vacancies were contested in each state. At this election, the quotas in each state were:
===Proportional representation of the states vs one vote one value===
Each state elects the same number of senators, meaning there is equal representation for each of the Australian states, regardless of population, so the Senate, like many upper Houses, does not adhere to the principle of one vote one value. Tasmania, with a population of around 500,000, elects the same number of senators as New South Wales, which has a population of more than 8 million. Because of this imbalance, governments favoured by the more populous states are occasionally frustrated by the extra power the smaller states have in the Senate, to the degree that former Prime Minister Paul Keating famously referred to the Senate&#x27;s members as &quot;unrepresentative swill&quot;. 

The proportional election system within each state ensures that the Senate incorporates more political diversity than the lower house (House of Representatives), which has historically been a two party body. The elected membership of the Senate more closely reflects the first voting preference of the electorate as a whole than does the composition of the House of Representatives, despite the large discrepancies from state to state in the ratio of voters to senators. This often means that the composition of the Senate is different from that of the House of Representatives, contributing to the Senate&#x27;s function as a house of review.

With proportional representation, and the small majorities in the Senate compared to the generally larger majorities in the House of Representatives, and the requirement that the number of members of the House be &quot;nearly as practicable&quot; twice that of the Senate, a joint sitting after a double dissolution is more likely than not to lead to a victory for the House over the Senate. When the Senate had an odd number of senators retiring at an election (3 or 5), 51% of the vote would lead to a clear majority of 3 out of 5 per state. With an even number of senators retiring at an election, it takes 57% of the vote to win 4 out of 6 seats, which may be insurmountable. This gives the House an advantage in joint sittings but not in ordinary elections, where the Senate may be too evenly balanced to get House legislation through.

A party does not need the support of the Senate to form government (needing only a majority in the House of Representatives), however the Senate can block supply, effectively preventing the government from lawfully spending money. Whether a government facing a Senate that blocks supply is obliged to either resign or call an election was one of the major disputes of the 1975 constitutional crisis. However, even where the Senate does not block supply, they can still use their power to frustrate the legislative agenda of the government.

===Parties===

Political parties have played a major role in the operations of the Senate throughout its history. Some framers of the constitution intended that senators would give first priority to the interests of their states, placing state considerations above party interests. However, others involved in drafting the constitution – including Alfred Deakin, Isaac Isaacs, and H. B. Higgins – correctly predicted that party considerations would soon dominate state interests. 

Party discipline was important in the Senate from the first parliament, most notably with the formation of an Australian Labor Party caucus after the inaugural 1901 election which required its members to vote in line with decisions of the majority. A two-party system became ensconced in both houses of parliament following the &quot;fusion&quot; of the non-Labor parties in 1909, largely as a response to the discipline of the ALP. Votes on party lines soon became a regular feature of debate, with corresponding criticisms that the Senate had merely become a rubber stamp for the government rather than filling the role of a states&#x27; house.

The &quot;block&quot; voting system used for the Senate prior to electoral reform in 1948 contributed to uneven party representation in the Senate, with the party securing the majority of votes in a state typically winning all that state&#x27;s Senate seats. After the emergence of the two-party system, there were only two elections between 1910 and 1949 where the government formed in the House of Representatives did not also hold a majority in the Senate. In both cases (1913 and 1929) the government lasted only a single term. The system produced &quot;extreme and wildly fluctuating results&quot;. On five occasions, the government won all available seats at half-Senate elections; consecutive landslide victories could resulted in the opposition being reduced to a handful of seats, such as when the ALP was reduced to a single Senate seat after the 1919 election. These outcomes, while still uncommon, led the Senate to be perceived as a weak institution serving as a rubber stamp and contributed to calls for reform.

The system of proportional representation passed in 1948 and implemented at the 1949 election resulted in a more even balance of party representation. A largely unintended consequence of the reforms was the emergence of minor parties as a political force in the Senate, ending a period of 40 years where every elected senator had been a member of either the ALP or the various anti-Labor parties. The first minor party to achieve prominence and obtain the balance of power in the Senate was the Democratic Labor Party (DLP), formed after the ALP split of 1955. The Australian Democrats and the Australian Greens have also held the balance of power at various points. This marked the start of a pattern of non-government control of the Senate, where neither the government nor the opposition held a majority of seats and the government was reliant on minor party and independent senators to pass legislation. Since 1962, the government has secured a Senate majority on only three occasions: after the 1975, 1977 and 2004 elections.

===Casual vacancies===

Section 15 of the Constitution provides that a casual vacancy of a State senator shall be filled by the State Parliament. If the previous senator was a member of a particular political party the replacement must come from the same party, but the State Parliament may choose not to fill the vacancy, in which case Section 11 requires the Senate to proceed regardless. If the State Parliament happens to be in recess when the vacancy occurs, the Constitution provides that the State Governor can appoint someone to fill the place until fourteen days after the State Parliament resumes sitting.

== Procedure ==
=== Work ===
The Australian Senate typically sits for 50 to 60 days a year. Most of those days are grouped into &#x27;sitting fortnights&#x27; of two four-day weeks. These are in turn arranged in three periods: the autumn sittings, from February to April; the winter sittings, which commence with the delivery of the budget in the House of Representatives on the first sitting day of May and run through to June or July; and the spring sittings, which commence around August and continue until December, and which typically contain the largest number of the year&#x27;s sitting days.

The senate has a regular schedule that structures its typical working week.

====Dealing with legislation====
All bills must be passed by a majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate before they become law. Most bills originate in the House of Representatives, and the great majority are introduced by the government.

The usual procedure is for notice to be given by a government minister the day before the bill is introduced into the Senate. Once introduced the bill goes through several stages of consideration. It is given a first reading, which represents the bill&#x27;s formal introduction into the chamber.

The first reading is followed by debate on the principle or policy of the bill (the second reading debate). Agreement to the bill in principle is indicated by a second reading, after which the detailed provisions of the bill are considered by one of a number of methods (see below). Bills may also be referred by either House to their specialised standing or select committees. Agreement to the policy and the details is confirmed by a third and final reading. These processes ensure that a bill is systematically considered before being agreed to.
The Senate has detailed rules in its standing orders that govern how a bill is considered at each stage. This process of consideration can vary greatly in the amount of time taken. Consideration of some bills is completed in a single day, while complex or controversial legislation may take months to pass through all stages of Senate scrutiny. The Constitution provides that if the Senate vote is equal, the question shall pass in the negative.

====Committees====

In addition to the work of the main chamber, the Senate also has a large number of committees which deal with matters referred to them by the Senate. These committees also conduct hearings three times a year in which the government&#x27;s budget and operations are examined. These are known as estimates hearings. Traditionally dominated by scrutiny of government activities by non-government senators, they provide the opportunity for all senators to ask questions of ministers and public officials. This may occasionally include government senators examining activities of independent publicly funded bodies, or pursuing issues arising from previous governments&#x27; terms of office. There is however a convention that senators do not have access to the files and records of previous governments when there has been an election resulting in a change in the party in government. Once a particular inquiry is completed the members of the committee can then produce a report, to be tabled in Parliament, outlining what they have discovered as well as any recommendations that they have produced for the Government to consider.

The ability of the Houses of Parliament to establish committees is referenced in Section 49 of the Constitution, which states, &quot;The powers, privileges, and immunities of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, and of the members and the committees of each House, shall be such as are declared by the Parliament, and until declared shall be those of the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom, and of its members and committees, at the establishment of the Commonwealth.&quot;

Parliamentary committees can be given a wide range of powers. One of the most significant powers is the ability to summon people to attend hearings in order to give evidence and submit documents. Anyone who attempts to hinder the work of a Parliamentary committee may be found to be in contempt of Parliament. There are a number of ways that witnesses can be found in contempt, these include; refusing to appear before a committee when summoned, refusing to answer a question during a hearing or to produce a document, or later being found to have lied to or misled a committee. Anyone who attempts to influence a witness may also be found in contempt. Other powers include the ability to meet throughout Australia, to establish subcommittees and to take evidence in both public and private hearings.

Proceedings of committees are considered to have the same legal standing as proceedings of Parliament. They are recorded by Hansard, except for private hearings, and also operate under Parliamentary privilege. Every participant, including committee members and witnesses giving evidence, is protected from being prosecuted under any civil or criminal action for anything they may say during a hearing. Written evidence and documents received by a committee are also protected.

====Holding governments to account====
One of the functions of the Senate, both directly and through its committees, is to scrutinise government activity. The vigour of this scrutiny has been fuelled for many years by the fact that the party in government has seldom had a majority in the Senate. Whereas in the House of Representatives the government&#x27;s majority has sometimes limited that chamber&#x27;s capacity to implement executive scrutiny, the opposition and minor parties have been able to use their Senate numbers as a basis for conducting inquiries into government operations. When the Howard government won control of the Senate in 2005, it sparked a debate about the effectiveness of the Senate in holding the government of the day accountable for its actions. Government members argued that the Senate continued to be a forum of vigorous debate, and its committees continued to be active. The Opposition leader in the Senate suggested that the government had attenuated the scrutinising activities of the Senate. The Australian Democrats, a minor party which frequently played mediating and negotiating roles in the Senate, expressed concern about a diminished role for the Senate&#x27;s committees.

In addition to review of legislation, the &quot;Legislation Act 2003&quot; provides that the Senate may also disallow legislative instruments – typically regulations made by government ministers using powers delegated by relevant legislation. The same power is afforded to the House of Representatives, but is rarely exercised given the government&#x27;s control of numbers in the lower house. The &quot;Legislation Act 2003&quot; provides that any senator may move a motion disallowing a legislative instrument, which if passed within 15 days has the effect of repealing the instrument. The government may not enact an equivalent legislative instrument for a period of six months following the disallowal.

===Voting===
Senators are called upon to vote on matters before the Senate. These votes are called &quot;divisions&quot; in the case of Senate business, or &quot;ballots&quot; where the vote is to choose a senator to fill an office of the Senate (such as the President).

Party discipline in Australian politics is strong, so divisions almost always are decided on party lines. Nevertheless, the existence of minor parties holding the balance of power in the Senate has made divisions in that chamber more uncertain than in the House of Representatives.

When a division is to be held, bells ring throughout the parliament building for four minutes, during which time senators must go to the chamber. At the end of that period the doors are locked and a vote is taken, by identifying and counting senators according to the side of the chamber on which they sit (ayes to the right of the chair, noes to the left). The whole procedure takes around eight minutes. Senators with commitments that keep them from the chamber may make arrangements in advance to be &#x27;paired&#x27; with a senator of the opposite political party, so that their absence does not affect the outcome of the vote.

The Senate contains an even number of senators, so a tied vote is a real prospect (which regularly occurs when the party numbers in the chamber are finely balanced). Section 23 of the Constitution requires that in the event of a tied division, the question is resolved in the negative. The system is however different for ballots for offices such as the President. If such a ballot is tied, the Clerk of the Senate decides the outcome by the drawing of lots. In reality, conventions govern most ballots, so this situation does not arise.

====Political parties and voting outcomes====
The strength of party discipline is demonstrated by how rare it is for members to vote against the position taken by their party. The exceptions are where a conscience vote is allowed by one or more of the political parties; and occasions where a member of a political party crosses the floor of the chamber to vote against the instructions of their party whip. Crossing the floor very rarely occurs, but is more likely in the Senate than in the House of Representatives.

When the government has a majority in the Senate, the importance of party discipline increases, as it is only backbenchers that may prevent the passage of government bills. While strong party discipline has been a feature of Australian politics since the emergence of the Labor Party in the early 1900s, as late as 1980 the Fraser government could not be assured that his party&#x27;s majority in the Senate would translate to absolute control, with at least 12 senators prepared to vote against the government. Similarly, when the Howard government had a Senate majority between 2005 and 2007, the internal differences between members of the government coalition parties became more apparent. However due to the increase in party discipline, only two senators in this period crossed the floor: Gary Humphries on civil unions in the Australian Capital Territory, and Barnaby Joyce on voluntary student unionism. A more significant potential instance of floor crossing was averted when the government withdrew its Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill, of which several government senators had been critical, and which would have been defeated had it proceeded to the vote. The controversy that surrounded these examples demonstrated both the importance of backbenchers in party policy deliberations and the limitations to their power to influence outcomes in the Senate chamber.

In September 2008, Barnaby Joyce became leader of the Nationals in the Senate, and stated that his party in the upper house would no longer necessarily vote with their Liberal counterparts.

== Where the Houses disagree ==
=== Double dissolutions and joint sittings ===
If the Senate rejects or fails to pass a proposed law, or passes it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree, and if after an interval of three months the Senate refuses to pass the same piece of legislation, the government may either abandon the bill or continue to revise it, or, in certain circumstances outlined in section 57 of the Constitution, the Prime Minister can advise the Governor-General to dissolve the entire parliament in a double dissolution. In such an event, the entirety of the Senate faces re-election, as does the House of Representatives, rather than only about half the chamber as is normally the case. After a double dissolution election, if the bills in question are reintroduced, and if they again fail to pass the Senate, the Governor-General may agree to a &quot;joint sitting&quot; of the two Houses in an attempt to pass the bills. Such a sitting has only occurred once, in 1974.

The double dissolution mechanism is not available for bills that originate in the Senate and are blocked in the lower house.

On 8 October 2003, the then Prime Minister John Howard initiated public discussion of whether the mechanism for the resolution of deadlocks between the Houses should be reformed. High levels of support for the existing mechanism, and a very low level of public interest in that discussion, resulted in the abandonment of these proposals.

=== Allocating terms after a double dissolution ===

After a double dissolution election, section 13 of the Constitution requires the Senate to divide the senators into two classes, with the first class having a three-year &quot;short term&quot;, and the second class a six-year &quot;long term&quot;. The Senate may adopt any approach it wants to determine how to allocate the long and short terms, however two methods are currently &#x27;on the table&#x27;:
* &quot;elected-order&quot; method, where the senators elected first attain a six-year term. This approach tends to favour minor party candidates as it gives greater weight to their first preference votes; or
* re-count method, where the long terms are allocated to those senators who would have been elected first if the election had been a standard half-Senate election. This method is likely to be preferred by the major parties in the Senate where it would deliver more six-year terms to their members.

The Senate applied the &quot;elected-order&quot; method following the 1987 double dissolution election. Since that time the Senate has passed resolutions on several occasions indicating its intention to use the re-count method to allocate seats at any future double dissolution, which Green describes as a fairer approach but notes could be ignored if a majority of senators opted for the &quot;elected-order&quot; method instead. In both double dissolution elections since 1987, the &quot;elected order&quot; method was used.

==Blocking supply==

The Senate has the same legislative power as the House of Representatives, except it may not originate or amend taxing or appropriation bills; they may only pass or reject them. The ability to block the annual appropriations bills required to fund the government (&quot;supply&quot;) was exercised in the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis. During the crisis, the Opposition used its numbers in the Senate to defer supply bills, refusing to deal with them until an election was called for both Houses of Parliament, an election which it hoped to win. The Prime Minister of the day, Gough Whitlam, contested the legitimacy of the blocking and refused to resign. The crisis brought to a head two Westminster conventions that, under the Australian constitutional system, were in conflict – firstly, that a government may continue to govern for as long as it has the support of the lower house, and secondly, that a government that no longer has access to supply must either resign or be dismissed. The deadlock ended in November 1975 when Governor-General Sir John Kerr dismissed Whitlam&#x27;s government and appointed Opposition Leader Fraser as Prime Minister, on the condition that elections for both Houses of parliament be held. 

In 2014, ABC elections analyst Antony Green noted that the blocking of supply alone cannot force a double dissolution. There must be legislation repeatedly blocked by the Senate which the government can then choose to use as a trigger for a double dissolution. 

==Current Senate==


===2019 election===
In the 2019 half-Senate election, 40 seats were up for election: six from each state and two from each territory. The senate results were: Liberal/National coalition 19 seats, Labor 13 seats, Greens 6 seats, One Nation 1 seat, and Jacqui Lambie Network 1 seat.

=== 2022 election ===

In the 2022 half–Senate election, 40 seats were up for election: six from each state and two from each territory. The senate results were: Liberal/National coalition 15 seats (−4), Labor 15 seats (±0), Greens 6 seats (+3), Jacqui Lambie Network 1 seat (+1), One Nation 1 seat (±0), United Australia 1 seat (+1), and independent 1 seat (+1). The composition of the Senate after the election was:

*Liberal/National Coalition 32 seats
*Labor 26 seats
*Greens 12 seats
*Jacqui Lambie Network 2 seats
*One Nation 2 seats
*United Australia 1 seat

==Historical party composition of the Senate==
The Senate has included representatives from a range of political parties, including several parties that have seldom or never had representation in the House of Representatives, but which have consistently secured a small but significant level of electoral support, as the table shows.

Results represent the composition of the Senate after the elections. The full Senate has been contested on eight occasions; the inaugural election and seven double dissolutions, these elections took place in 1914, 1951, 1974, 1975, 1983, 1987, and 2016. These are underlined and highlighted in puce.

<text>Mark Pattison (10 October 1813 – 30 July 1884) was an English author and a Church of England priest. He served as Rector of Lincoln College, Oxford.

==Life==
He was the son of the rector of Hauxwell, North Riding of Yorkshire, and was privately educated by his father, Mark James Pattison. His sister was Dorothy Wyndlow Pattison (&quot;Sister Dora&quot;). In 1832, he matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford, where he took his B.A. degree in 1836 with second-class honours. After other attempts to obtain a fellowship, he was elected in 1839 to a Yorkshire fellowship at Lincoln College, Oxford, an anti-Puseyite College. Pattison was at this time a Puseyite, and greatly under the influence of John Henry Newman, for whom he worked, helping in the translation of Thomas Aquinas&#x27;s &quot;Catena Aurea&quot;, and writing in the &quot;British Critic&quot; and &quot;Christian Remembrancer&quot;.

He was ordained a priest in 1843, and in the same year became tutor of Lincoln College, where he rapidly made a reputation as a clear and stimulating teacher and as a sympathetic friend of youth. The management of the college was practically in his hands, and his reputation as a scholar became high in the university. In 1851 the rectorship of Lincoln became vacant, and it seemed certain that Pattison would be elected, but he was edged out. The disappointment was acute and his health suffered. In 1855, he resigned the tutorship, travelled to Germany to investigate Continental systems of education, and began his researches into the lives of the philologist Isaac Casaubon and the historian Joseph Justus Scaliger, which occupied the remainder of his life.

In 1861, he was at last elected rector of Lincoln College in Oxford, marrying in the same year Emily Francis Strong (afterwards Lady Dilke). As rector, he contributed largely to various reviews on literary subjects, and took a considerable interest in social science, even presiding over a section at a congress in 1876. However, he avoided the routine of university business, and refused the vice-chancellorship. But while living the life of a student, he was fond of society, and especially of the society of women. In later life he formed a close friendship with Meta Bradley, a young woman 40 years his junior. On his death he left her £5,000, much to his wife&#x27;s displeasure. Pattison died at Harrogate, Yorkshire.

His biography of Isaac Casaubon appeared in 1875; he also wrote about John Milton in Macmillan&#x27;s &quot;English Men of Letters&quot; series in 1879. The late nineteenth-century English author George Gissing wrote in his diary in 1891 that he &quot;was astonished to find [the biography of Casaubon] on the shelves&quot; of a circulating library in the small north Somerset seaside resort of Clevedon. The 18th century, alike in its literature and its theology, was a favourite study, as is illustrated by his contribution (&quot;Tendencies of Religious Thought in England&quot;, 1688–1750) to the once famous &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot; (1860), and by his edition of Pope&#x27;s &quot;Essay on Man&quot; (1869), etc. His &quot;Sermons and Collected Essays&quot;, edited by Henry Nettleship, were published posthumously (1889), as well as the &quot;Memoirs&quot; (1885), an autobiography deeply tinged with melancholy and bitterness. His projected &quot;Life&quot; of Scaliger was never finished.

His extensive personal archive—comprising 63 archival boxes and including diaries, correspondence, journals, sermons and working papers, including material relating to Scaliger, Pierre-Daniel Huet and Claude Saumaise—is held in Bodleian Archives &amp; Manuscripts, the Bodleian Library, Oxford (MSS. Pattison 7*, 79-144).

<doc id="165709" wikidata="Q1998897" url="?curid=165709" title="A (Jethro Tull album)">
<text>A is the 13th studio album by British rock band Jethro Tull. It was released on 29 August 1980 in the UK and 1 September of the same year in the United States.

The album was initially written and recorded with the intention of being frontman Ian Anderson&#x27;s debut solo album. Hence the album&#x27;s title: the master tapes were marked &quot;A&quot; for Anderson during recording. However, the album was eventually released as a Jethro Tull album after pressure from Chrysalis Records. Anderson has since stated that he regrets allowing the album to be released under the Jethro Tull name.

Musically, the album was a departure from prior Tull works, adopting more of an electronic rock sound with heavy use of synthesizers, although still retaining the band&#x27;s trademark folk influence and Anderson&#x27;s flute playing. Lyrically, the album saw a similar departure from the fantasy and folklore themes of previous Tull work, instead emphasizing contemporary matters such as the Cold War. The album was the first Tull album released following a large lineup change which saw drummer Barrie &quot;Barriemore&quot; Barlow and keyboardists John Evan and Dee Palmer departing the band in 1980 while bassist John Glascock had died from heart complications the previous year. The album instead features Glascock&#x27;s touring replacement Dave Pegg on bass in his first recorded appearance with the band, Mark Craney on drums and Eddie Jobson on keyboards (with Jobson credited as a &quot;special guest&quot;) and electric violin. 

== Overview ==
&quot;A&quot; was recorded as an intended Ian Anderson solo album before Tull&#x27;s record label, Chrysalis, asked that it become credited to the group. This is the reason for the album&#x27;s title, as the tapes were marked &quot;A&quot; for &quot;Anderson&quot;. It is noted for its more synthesiser-based sound, a fact which created controversy among many of the band&#x27;s fans. On the other hand, it features a folk-influenced piece, &quot;The Pine Marten&#x27;s Jig&quot;.

&quot;A&quot; features a dramatically different line-up of Tull from the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Stormwatch&quot; (1979). Former keyboardist John Evan and organist Dee Palmer were fired from the group, while drummer Barriemore Barlow left the band due to depression over the death of John Glascock as well as plans to start his own band.

The only members of Tull to appear on both &quot;Stormwatch&quot; (1979) and &quot;A&quot; (1980) are Ian Anderson and Martin Barre. This is also bassist Dave Pegg&#x27;s first appearance on a Tull studio recording, but he had become a member of the band during the &quot;Stormwatch&quot; tour in 1979, replacing the deceased Glascock. Conflicting reasons have been given for the line-up change. Anderson has stated that he wanted to take the band in a different direction from the folk rock and progressive rock of the 1970s.

Barriemore Barlow was unhappy with the direction the band was taking and later stated that he would have left anyway. However, biographer David Rees reports in his book &quot;Minstrels in the Gallery: A History of Jethro Tull&quot; (2001) that Anderson had never intended to replace Jethro Tull&#x27;s previous line-up with the musicians who recorded &quot;A&quot;, but was forced by Chrysalis Records, which had decided to release his &#x27;solo&#x27; album under the name Jethro Tull. This claim was further evidenced by Anderson&#x27;s note in the 2003 re-release of the album.

A 40th anniversary box set was released in April 2021, featuring the album remixed by Steven Wilson. It includes some bonus tracks, a DVD of &quot;Slipstream&quot;, and audio of a concert in Los Angeles.

<text>Wilson Pickett (March 18, 1941 – January 19, 2006) was an American singer and songwriter.

A major figure in the development of soul music, Pickett recorded more than 50 songs that made the US R&amp;B charts, many of which crossed over to the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Among his best-known hits are &quot;In the Midnight Hour&quot; (which he co-wrote), &quot;Land of 1000 Dances&quot;, &quot;634-5789 (Soulsville, U.S.A.)&quot;, &quot;Mustang Sally&quot;, &quot;Funky Broadway&quot;, &quot;Engine No. 9&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock My Love&quot;.

Pickett was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991, in recognition of his impact on songwriting and recording.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and family ===
Pickett was born March 18, 1941, in Prattville, Alabama, and sang in Baptist church choirs. He was the fourth of 11 children and called his mother &quot;the baddest woman in my book,&quot; telling historian Gerri Hirshey: &quot;I get scared of her now. She used to hit me with anything, skillets, stove wood ... [one time I ran away and] cried for a week. Stayed in the woods, me and my little dog.&quot; Pickett eventually left to live with his father in Detroit in 1955.

=== Early musical career (1955–1964) ===
Pickett&#x27;s forceful, passionate style of singing was developed in the church and on the streets of Detroit, under the influence of recording stars such as Little Richard, whom he referred to as &quot;the architect of rock and roll.&quot;

In 1955, Pickett joined the Violinaires, a gospel group. The Violinaires played with another gospel group on concert tour in America. After singing for four years in the popular gospel-harmony group, Pickett, lured by the success of gospel singers who had moved to the lucrative secular music market, joined the Falcons in 1959.

By 1959, Pickett recorded the song &quot;Let Me Be Your Boy&quot; with the Primettes as background singers. The song is the B-side of his 1963 single &quot;My Heart Belongs to You&quot;.

The Falcons were an early vocal group bringing gospel into a popular context, thus paving the way for soul music. The group featured notable members who became major solo artists; when Pickett joined the group, Eddie Floyd and Sir Mack Rice were members. Pickett&#x27;s biggest success with the Falcons was &quot;I Found a Love&quot;, co-written by Pickett and featuring his lead vocals. While only a minor hit for the Falcons, it paved the way for Pickett to embark on a solo career. Pickett later had a solo hit with a re-recorded two-part version of the song, included on his 1967 album &quot;The Sound of Wilson Pickett&quot;.

Soon after recording &quot;I Found a Love&quot;, Pickett cut his first solo recordings, including &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Cry&quot;, in collaboration with Don Covay. Pickett also recorded a demo for a song he co-wrote, &quot;If You Need Me&quot;, a slow-burning soul ballad featuring a spoken sermon. Pickett sent the demo to Jerry Wexler, a producer at Atlantic Records. Wexler gave it to the label&#x27;s recording artist Solomon Burke, Atlantic&#x27;s biggest star at the time. Burke admired Pickett&#x27;s performance of the song, but his own recording of &quot;If You Need Me&quot; became one of his biggest hits (No. 2 R&amp;B, No. 37 pop) and is considered a soul standard. Pickett was crushed when he discovered that Atlantic had given away his song. When Pickett—with a demo tape under his arm—returned to Wexler&#x27;s studio, Wexler asked whether he was angry about this loss. He denied it, saying &quot;It&#x27;s over&quot;. Pickett&#x27;s version was released on Double L Records as his debut solo single and was a moderate hit, peaking at No. 30 R&amp;B and No. 64 pop.

Pickett&#x27;s first significant success as a solo artist came with &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot;, an original composition (not to be confused with the Chuck Willis standard of the same name). Entering the charts on July 27, 1963, it peaked at No. 7 on the R&amp;B chart (No. 49 pop); the same title was used for Pickett&#x27;s debut album, released in the same year. Compiling several of Pickett&#x27;s single releases for Double L, &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot; showcased a raw soulful sound that foreshadowed the singer&#x27;s performances throughout the coming decade. The single&#x27;s success persuaded Wexler and Atlantic to buy Pickett&#x27;s recording contract from Double L in 1964.

=== Rise to stardom: &quot;In the Midnight Hour&quot; (1965) ===
Pickett&#x27;s Atlantic career began with the self-produced single, &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Cry&quot;. Looking to boost Pickett&#x27;s chart chances, Atlantic paired him with record producer Bert Berns and established songwriters Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil. With this team, along with arranger, conductor Teacho Wiltshire Pickett recorded &quot;Come Home Baby,&quot; a duet with singer Tami Lynn, but this single failed to chart.

Pickett&#x27;s breakthrough came at Stax Records&#x27; studio in Memphis, Tennessee, where he recorded his third Atlantic single, &quot;In the Midnight Hour&quot; (1965). This song was Pickett&#x27;s first big hit, peaking at No. 1 R&amp;B, No. 21 pop (US), and No. 12 (UK). It sold more than one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. It garnered Pickett his first Grammy nomination for Best Rhythm &amp; Blues Recording at the 8th Annual Grammy Awards.

The genesis of &quot;In the Midnight Hour&quot; was a recording session on May 12, 1965, at which Wexler worked out a powerful rhythm track with studio musicians Steve Cropper and Al Jackson of the Stax Records house band, including bassist Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn. (Stax keyboard player Booker T. Jones, who usually played with Dunn, Cropper and Jackson as Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, did not play on the studio sessions with Pickett.) Wexler said to Cropper and Jackson, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you pick up on this thing here?&quot; He performed a dance step. Cropper explained in an interview that Wexler told them that &quot;this was the way the kids were dancing; they were putting the accent on two. Basically, we&#x27;d been one-beat-accenters with an afterbeat; it was like &#x27;boom dah,&#x27; but here was a thing that went &#x27;um-chaw,&#x27; just the reverse as far as the accent goes.&quot;

=== Stax/Fame years (1965–1967) ===
Pickett recorded three sessions at Stax in May and October 1965. He was joined by keyboardist Isaac Hayes for the October sessions. In addition to &quot;In the Midnight Hour,&quot; Pickett&#x27;s 1965 recordings included the singles &quot;Don&#x27;t Fight It,&quot; (No. 4 R&amp;B, No. 53 pop) &quot;634-5789 (Soulsville, U.S.A.)&quot;(No. 1 R&amp;B, No. 13 pop) and &quot;Ninety-Nine and a Half (Won&#x27;t Do)&quot; (No. 13 R&amp;B, No. 53 pop). All but &quot;634-5789&quot; were original compositions which Pickett co-wrote with Eddie Floyd or Steve Cropper or both; &quot;634-5789&quot; was credited to Cropper and Floyd alone.

For his next sessions, Pickett did not return to Stax, as the label&#x27;s owner, Jim Stewart, had decided in December 1965 to ban outside productions. Wexler took Pickett to Fame Studios, a studio also with a close association with Atlantic Records, located in a converted tobacco warehouse in nearby Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Pickett recorded some of his biggest hits there, including the highest-charting version of &quot;Land of 1000 Dances&quot;, which was his third R&amp;B No. 1 and his biggest pop hit, peaking at No. 6. It was a million-selling disc.

Other big hits from this era in Pickett&#x27;s career included his remakes of Mack Rice&#x27;s &quot;Mustang Sally&quot; (No. 6 R&amp;B, No. 23 pop), and Dyke &amp; the Blazers&#x27; &quot;Funky Broadway&quot;, (R&amp;B No. 1, No. 8 pop). Both tracks were million sellers. The band heard on most of Pickett&#x27;s Fame recordings included keyboardist Spooner Oldham, guitarist Jimmy Johnson, drummer Roger Hawkins, and bassist Tommy Cogbill.

=== Later Atlantic years (1967–1972) ===
Near the end of 1967, Pickett began recording at American Studios in Memphis with producers Tom Dowd and Tommy Cogbill, and began recording songs by Bobby Womack. The songs &quot;I&#x27;m in Love,&quot; &quot;Jealous Love,&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ve Come a Long Way,&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m a Midnight Mover,&quot; (co-written by Pickett and Womack), and &quot;I Found a True Love&quot; were Womack-penned hits for Pickett in 1967 and 1968. Pickett recorded works by other songwriters in this period; Rodger Collins&#x27; &quot;She&#x27;s Lookin&#x27; Good&quot; and a new arrangement of the traditional blues standard &quot;Stagger Lee&quot; were Top 40 hits Pickett recorded at American. Womack was the guitarist on all recordings.

Pickett returned to Fame Studios in late 1968 and early 1969, where he worked with a band that featured guitarist Duane Allman, Hawkins, and bassist Jerry Jemmott. A No. 16 pop hit remake of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Hey Jude&quot; came out of the Fame sessions, as well as the minor hits &quot;Mini-Skirt Minnie&quot; and &quot;Hey Joe&quot; (a remake of the Jimi Hendrix hit).

Late 1969 found Pickett at Criteria Studios in Miami. His remakes of the Supremes&#x27; &quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot; (No. 16 R&amp;B, No. 92 pop) and The Archies&#x27; &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot; (No. 4 R&amp;B, No. 25 pop), and the Pickett original &quot;She Said Yes&quot; (No. 20 R&amp;B, No. 68 pop) came from these sessions.

Pickett then teamed up with established Philadelphia-based hitmakers Gamble and Huff for the 1970 album &quot;Wilson Pickett in Philadelphia&quot;, which featured his next two hit singles, &quot;Engine No. 9&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Green Grass Fool You&quot;, the latter selling one million copies.
Following these two hits, Pickett returned to Muscle Shoals and the band featuring David Hood, Hawkins and Tippy Armstrong. This lineup recorded Pickett&#x27;s fifth and last R&amp;B No. 1 hit, &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock My Love, Pt. 1&quot;. It was another Pickett recording that rang up sales in excess of a million copies. Two further hits followed in 1971: &quot;Call My Name, I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; (No. 10 R&amp;B, No. 52 pop) and &quot;Fire and Water&quot; (No. 2 R&amp;B, No. 24 pop), a cover of a song by the rock group Free.

In March 1971, Pickett headlined the &quot;Soul To Soul&quot; concert in Accra to commemorate Ghana&#x27;s 14th Independence Day. He is featured on the soundtrack album, &quot;Soul To Soul&quot;, which peaked at No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Soul LPs chart.

Pickett recorded several tracks in 1972 for a planned new album on Atlantic, but after the single &quot;Funk Factory&quot; reached No. 11 R&amp;B and No. 58 pop in June 1972, he left Atlantic for RCA Records. His final Atlantic single, a recording of Randy Newman&#x27;s &quot;Mama Told Me Not to Come,&quot; was culled from Pickett&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock My Love&quot;. However, six years later, the Big Tree division of Atlantic released his album, Funky Situation, in 1978.

In 2010, Rhino Handmade released a comprehensive compilation of these years titled &quot;Funky Midnight Mover – The Studio Recordings (1962–1978)&quot;. The compilation included all recordings originally issued during Pickett&#x27;s Atlantic years along with previously unreleased recordings. This collection was sold online only by Rhino.com.

=== Post-Atlantic recording career ===
Pickett continued to record with success on the R&amp;B charts for RCA in 1973 and 1974, scoring four top 30 R&amp;B hits with &quot;Mr. Magic Man&quot;, &quot;Take a Closer Look at the Woman You&#x27;re With&quot;, &quot;International Playboy&quot; (a re-recording of a song he had previously recorded for Atlantic on &quot;Wilson Pickett in Philadelphia&quot;), and &quot;Soft Soul Boogie Woogie&quot;. However, he was failing to cross over to the pop charts with regularity, as none of these songs reached higher than No. 90 on the Hot 100. In 1975, with Pickett&#x27;s once-prominent chart career on the wane, RCA dropped Pickett from the label. After being dropped, he formed the short-lived Wicked label, where he released one LP, &quot;Chocolate Mountain&quot;. In 1978, he made a disco album with Big Tree Records titled &quot;Funky Situation&quot;, which is a coincidence as, at that point, Big Tree was distributed by his former label, Atlantic. The following year, he released an album on EMI titled &quot;I Want You&quot;.

Pickett was a popular composer, writing songs that were recorded by many artists, including Van Halen, the Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, the Grateful Dead, Booker T. &amp; the MGs, Genesis, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Hootie &amp; the Blowfish, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Roxy Music, Bruce Springsteen, Los Lobos, the Jam and Ani DiFranco, among others.

Pickett continued to record sporadically with several labels over the following decades (including Motown), occasionally making the lower to mid-range of the R&amp;B charts, but he had no pop hit after 1974. His career was hindered by his addictions. His alcoholism was exacerbated by heavy cocaine use, and he became increasingly violent towards his family and bandmates.

Throughout the 1980s and &#x27;90s, despite his personal troubles, Pickett was repeatedly honored for his contributions to music. During this period, he was invited to perform at Atlantic Records&#x27; 40th Anniversary concert in 1988, and his music was prominently featured in the 1991 film &quot;The Commitments&quot;, with Pickett as an off-screen character.

In the late 1990s, Pickett returned to the studio and received a Grammy Award nomination for the 1999 album &quot;It&#x27;s Harder Now&quot;. The comeback resulted in his being honored as Soul/Blues Male Artist of the Year by the Blues Foundation in Memphis. &quot;It&#x27;s Harder Now&quot; was voted &#x27;Comeback Blues Album of the Year&#x27; and &#x27;Soul/Blues Album of the Year.&#x27;

Pickett appeared in the 1998 film &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot;, in which he performed &quot;634-5789&quot; with Eddie Floyd and Jonny Lang. He was previously mentioned in the 1980 film &quot;Blues Brothers&quot;, which features several members of Pickett&#x27;s backing band, as well as a performance of &quot;Everybody Needs Somebody to Love.&quot;

He co-starred in the 2002 documentary &quot;Only the Strong Survive,&quot; directed by D. A. Pennebaker, a selection of both the 2002 Cannes and Sundance Film Festivals. In 2003, Pickett was a judge for the second annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists&#x27; careers.

Pickett spent the twilight of his career playing dozens of concert dates every year until the end of 2004, when he began suffering from health problems and took what was initially intended to be year-long break from performing. While in the hospital, he returned to his spiritual roots and told his sister that he wanted to record a gospel album, but he never recovered.

On September 10, 2014, TVOne&#x27;s Unsung program aired a documentary that focused on Pickett&#x27;s life and career. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Pickett at number 76 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

==Personal life ==
Pickett was the father of four children. At the time of his death, he was engaged.

=== Legal problems and drug abuse ===
Pickett&#x27;s struggle with alcoholism and cocaine addiction led to run-ins with the law.

In 1991, Pickett was arrested for yelling threats while drunkenly driving his car over the front lawn of Donald Aronson, the mayor of Englewood, New Jersey. He faced charges of drunk driving, refusing to take a breath test, and resisting arrest. Pickett agreed to perform a benefit concert in exchange for having the disorderly conduct and property damage charges dropped. He performed his community service obligation.

In 1992, Pickett struck 86-year-old pedestrian Pepe Ruiz with his car in Englewood. Police allegedly found six empty miniature vodka bottles and six empty beer cans in Pickett&#x27;s car. Ruiz, who had helped organize the New York animation union, died later that year. Pickett pleaded guilty to drunk driving charges. He agreed to rehab and received a reduced sentence of one year in jail and five years probation. A week after this incident, a judge ordered Pickett to move out of his home after his live-in girlfriend charged him with threatening to have her killed and throwing a vodka bottle at her.

In 1996, Pickett was arrested for assaulting his girlfriend Elizabeth Trapp while under the influence of cocaine; she refused to press charges. Pickett was charged with cocaine possession.

==Death==
Pickett died on January 19, 2006, as a result of a heart attack. He had been suffering from health problems for the last year of his life and had spent considerable time in the hospital. He died at a hospital in Reston, Virginia. At the time of his death, Pickett was living in Ashburn, Virginia. He was laid to rest in a mausoleum at Evergreen Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky. Pickett spent many years in Louisville. Pastor Steve Owens of Decatur, Georgia, presided over his funeral, and Little Richard, a long-time friend of Pickett&#x27;s, delivered the eulogy.

Pickett was remembered on March 20, 2006, at New York&#x27;s B. B. King Blues Club with performances by the Commitments, Ben E. King, his long-term backing band the Midnight Movers, soul singer Bruce &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Wayne, and Southside Johnny in front of an audience that included members of his family, including two brothers.

== Awards and nominations ==
Wilson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. In 1993, he was honored with a Pioneer Award by the Rhythm and Blues Foundation. In 2005, Wilson Pickett was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame. In 2015 Wilson Pickett was inducted into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame.

===Grammy Awards===
He was nominated for five Grammy Awards during the course of his career.

<text>Michael Colin Cowdrey, Baron Cowdrey of Tonbridge, (24 December 1932 – 4 December 2000) was an English cricketer who played for Kent County Cricket Club from 1950 to 1976, and in 114 Test matches for England from 1954 to 1975. He was born in Ootacamund, Madras Presidency, British India and died in Littlehampton, West Sussex.

Cowdrey was a right-handed batsman who played in 692 first-class matches. He scored 42,719 career runs at an average of 42.89 runs per completed innings with a highest score of 307 as one of 107 centuries. He was an occasional right-arm leg spin bowler, taking 65 first-class wickets with a best innings return of 4/22. An outstanding slip fielder, he held 638 career catches. Cowdrey was the first player to make 100 appearances in Test cricket and also the first batsman to score a Test century, both home and away, against six other countries.

==Early life and school years==
Colin Cowdrey was born on his family&#x27;s tea plantation at Ootacamund, Madras Presidency, although his birthplace has often been misrecorded as Bangalore, 100 miles to the north. His father, Ernest Cowdrey, was a keen cricketer who had played in the Minor Counties Championship for Berkshire. Ernest made an application for Colin to join Marylebone Cricket Club while still an infant. Colin&#x27;s mother was Molly Cowdrey (née Taylor), who played tennis and hockey. He had no schooling in India, but his father and the servants taught him how to play cricket from a very early age.

When Cowdrey was five, he was taken to England where he attended the Homefield Preparatory School in Sutton from 1938 to 1945. In 1945, aged 12, he went to Alf Gover&#x27;s Cricket School for three weeks and his father enrolled him at Tonbridge School so that he could qualify for Kent County Cricket Club. On Gover&#x27;s recommendation, Cowdrey was selected for the school&#x27;s first team. In July 1946, aged thirteen, Cowdrey played at Lord&#x27;s for Tonbridge School against Clifton College. He scored 75 and 44 and, bowling leg spin, took 3/58 and 5/33. Tonbridge won the match by two runs. The school later established the Cowdrey Scholarships for sporting excellence in his memory.

Cowdrey was asked to play for Kent Young Amateurs in 1948 and made 157 against Sussex Young Amateurs, 87 against Middlesex Young Amateurs and 79 against Surrey Young Amateurs. He was asked to join the Kent Second XI in 1949 and played three matches in August against Norfolk, Wiltshire and Devon in the Minor Counties Championship. In 1950, he was made captain of his school cricket team and scored 126* for the Public Schools XI against Combined Services at Lord&#x27;s. Less than a week later, Kent selected Cowdrey for his first-class debut in a County Championship match against Derbyshire at the County Ground in Derby. He held a catch and took a wicket in Derbyshire&#x27;s first innings of 345/6 declared. He was fifth in the Kent batting order and scored 15 in his debut innings before he was caught by Derbyshire captain Pat Vaulkhard off a ball by Cliff Gladwin. Kent were all out for 96 and Vaulkhard imposed the follow on. Cowdrey made Kent&#x27;s top score of 26 in the second innings. He was bowled by Gladwin whose match return was 10/86. Kent were all out for 151 and Derbyshire won by an innings and 98 runs.

==First-class and international career==
===1951 to 1954===
Cowdrey left Tonbridge School in the summer of 1951 and, having been offered an exhibition, became a student at the University of Oxford. He was there till the summer of 1954 and studied geography at Brasenose College. He joined the Oxford University Cricket Club and, in each season from 1952 to 1954, played for them in the early weeks and then for Kent till the end of the season. He captained the Oxford team in 1954.

Before going into residence at Oxford in the autumn of 1951, Cowdrey scored his maiden first-class century against them for the Free Foresters. This match was played at the University Parks 2–5 June and Cowdrey scored 143 at a run a minute in the first innings. Free Foresters totalled 317 all out but the university replied with 395/5 declared. In their second innings, Free Foresters scored 355 all out. Errol Holmes was the top scorer with 162 and Cowdrey contributed 39. Oxford needed 278 and won by 8 wickets. Cowdrey made his debut in the Gentlemen v Players series soon afterwards, playing for the Gentlemen. In his first match for them at North Marine Road, Scarborough, he scored 106. The match ended in a draw. In all matches, Cowdrey scored 1,189 runs in the 1951 season and was awarded his Kent county cap. He received the cap from team captain David Clark after an innings of 71 against the touring South Africans. At the age of eighteen, he was the youngest player to be capped by Kent.
===First international tour===
Cowdrey was a surprise choice for the England tour of Australia in 1954–55. He was called in to replace the injured Willie Watson. According to Cowdrey, England captain Len Hutton later told him that his selection was a gamble, but it was thought that his technique would be good on the hard Australian wickets. Frank Tyson recalled Hutton telling Cowdrey and himself that they would be secondary players on the tour, there to gain experience with probably no involvement in the Test series.

On the team&#x27;s arrival in Perth, Cowdrey received a telegram that his father had died, but the team rallied round him and he played in the opening match against a local Western Australian Country XI. He scored 48* and took 4/35 with his leg breaks. The party moved on to Sydney where Cowdrey was selected to play against New South Wales. This became a key match in his career as he scored a century in each innings and thereby earned his place in the England team for the first Test, even though he failed in the next match against Queensland.

The first Test, Cowdrey&#x27;s international debut, was played at the Brisbane Cricket Ground and Australia scored 601/8 declared after Hutton had won the toss and sent them in. England&#x27;s batting collapsed in the first innings, though Cowdrey made 40, and they had to follow on. Cowdrey scored 10 in the second innings and England, with totals of 190 and 257 were unable to avoid a heavy defeat by an innings and 154 runs. After that, England staged a recovery and won the second Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground by 38 runs, having been 74 behind on first innings. In the second innings, Cowdrey (54) shared a fourth wicket partnership of 116 with Peter May (104) which enabled England to reach 296 and left Australia needing 223 to win. Frank Tyson and Brian Statham bowled them out for 184 to level the series.

In the third Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, England were in trouble at 41/4 and were rescued by Cowdrey&#x27;s maiden Test century. He scored 102 out of 191 after sharing partnerships of 74 with Trevor Bailey and 54 with Godfrey Evans. Some writers have said this was the highlight of Cowdrey&#x27;s career as it laid a foundation for eventual victory by 128 runs after Tyson, with a return of 7/27, shattered Australia&#x27;s batting in their second innings. Among those who praised Cowdrey&#x27;s performance were Bill O&#x27;Reilly, who said it was the best Test innings he had ever seen and, Tyson who doubted if Cowdrey had &quot;ever scored a better hundred&quot;. Cowdrey made 102 of England&#x27;s first innings of 191 and once again this was enough for Tyson to bowl his team to victory as the tourists took a 2–1 lead in the series.

Australia opened the fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval with a total of 323. In reply, England scored 341 including 79 by Cowdrey. Australia could only manage 111 in their second innings. Cowdrey was injured when the ball hit him in the face while he was fielding. He batted in the second innings and was out for 4 but the injury worsened and he was hospitalised for several days. England scored 97/5 to win the match by 5 wickets. The final Test at Sydney was drawn and so England won the series 3–1 to retain The Ashes.

===1955 to 1958===
On his return from Australia, Cowdrey decided to drop out of Oxford and concentrate on his cricket career. As he was no longer an undergraduate, he was called up for national service in the Royal Air Force. However, he was almost immediately discharged because of a hereditary disability of rigid toes, on which he had previously had an operation. Cowdrey cemented his place in the England team and took part in each of the home series during this period. He also went to South Africa in 1956–57. In 1957, during the Test series against West Indies, Cowdrey and May shared a fourth wicket partnership of 411 at Edgbaston. Cowdrey scored 154 and May 285*. At the time, it was the third highest stand in Test cricket. 

Before the 1957 season, Cowdrey was appointed captain of the Kent team, succeeding Doug Wright. Kent finished 14th in the County Championship, winning six of their 28 matches. &quot;Playfair Cricket Annual&quot; commented that Cowdrey had &quot;infused the right spirit&quot; into the team but pointed out that Kent cricket was still well short of resurgence. Cowdrey only played in 18 matches because of international calls and, without him, the team&#x27;s batting was weak.

===1958–59 to 1962===
Cowdrey replaced Trevor Bailey as Peter May&#x27;s vice-captain for the 1958–59 tour of Australia. The Test series was a disaster for England, who lost 4–0. Cowdrey had one notable innings when he scored 100* in the Third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground and helped England to save that match as a draw. In 1959, Cowdrey had a successful series against India and scored 160 in the third Test at Headingley. Cowdrey captained England for the first time on their tour of the West Indies in 1959–60 after May was seriously injured. He took over from May for the last two matches of the series. Both were drawn and England, who had won the second Test, took the series 1–0.

With May out of action for the whole of 1960, Cowdrey captained England in the series against South Africa and won it 3–0. South Africa nearly won the last Test at The Oval after dismissing England for 155 and then scoring 479/9 declared. Cowdrey opened the England second innings with Geoff Pullar and they shared a first wicket stand of 290 which saved the match. Cowdrey scored 155 and Pullar 175.

May returned in 1961 and was expected to take back his captaincy, but declared himself unfit. Cowdrey was hurriedly brought to Lords and was told he would take over only a few days before the First Test. Although Richie Benaud had beaten England 4–0 in the last Ashes series the 1961 Australians were considered to be the weakest sent to England with Benaud and Alan Davidson struggling with injuries and many players unused to English conditions. They nearly upset England in the First Test at Edgbaston, leading by 321 runs in the first innings and Ted Dexter had to save the game with an innings of 180. Before the Second Test at Lords Cowdrey made 149 and 121 for Kent against the tourists and was 7 runs from victory when the game ended. May returned to the England team, but insisted that Cowdrey be captain despite pressure from the selectors. Benaud was unable to play, but the Australians under Neil Harvey rose to the occasion, Davidson taking 5/42 in the first innings, Bill Lawry making his maiden Test century of 130 and Garth McKenzie taking 5/37 to clear up the second innings in their 5 wicket victory. May agreed to lead England in the Third Test at Headingley and Cowdrey made 93 and 22 in a low scoring match as Fred Trueman took 11/93 to even the series. Cowdrey missed the Fourth Test at Old Trafford with a fever, where Australia won a nail-biting match to retain the Ashes. May thought England would have won if Cowdrey had played, even if he wasn&#x27;t fit, but he returned for the drawn Fifth Test at the Oval.

The Ashes series had been a disappointment and Cowdrey decided to miss the tough tour of India and Pakistan, which was led by Ted Dexter. He lost to India 2–0, but beat Pakistan 1–0 and made 712 Test runs (71.20) on the tour, including his highest Test score of 205. May returned to play for Surrey, but refused to play for England and retired from cricket after a few games in 1963. When Pakistan toured England in 1962 Dexter was made captain for the First Test, winning by an innings and 24 runs (Cowdrey making 159) and the Second Test, which was won by 9 wickets. Cowdrey replaced him in the Third Test as the selectors considered their options for the forthcoming tour of Australia and he won by an innings and 117 runs. When Cowdrey was made captain in the final Gentleman v Players match at Lord&#x27;s it looked like he would be chosen, but he was forced to withdraw because of kidney stones and Dexter was put in charge. However, he found a new rival in the old Sussex captain the Reverend David Sheppard, who was willing to take a sabbatical from his church mission in the East End in order to tour Australia. Sheppard made 112 for the Gentlemen and was chosen for the tour, but Dexter was confirmed as captain for the last two Tests against Pakistan and the forthcoming tour of Australia and New Zealand with Cowdrey as vice-captain. Cowdrey recovered to open the batting in the Fifth Test and make his highest Test score of 182, adding 238 with Dexter (172) and ending the series with 409 runs (81.80).

===1962–63 to 1967===
The tour manager Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk joined the team with three of his daughters and announced &quot;You may dance with my daughters. You may take them out and wine them and dine them, but that is all you may do&quot;, though years later Cowdrey would marry the eldest, Lady Anne. Cowdrey had a poor start to the tour and made three successive ducks, which Jack Fingleton blamed on his fondness for golf. However, Cowdrey made the highest score of his career against South Australia on Christmas Eve (his birthday). He caressed his way to 307 in 369 minutes, beating Frank Woolley&#x27;s 305 not out against Tasmania in 1911–12 as the highest score by a tourist in Australia; it was the highest first-class score in Australia for 18 years. Cowdrey added 103 runs with David Sheppard (81), 98 with Ken Barrington, then stroked 344 runs with fellow stylist Tom Graveney (122 not out), striking 4 sixes and 29 fours, until he was out and Dexter declared on 586/5. Fresh from his triumph at Adelaide Cowdrey made his only century of the series in the Second Test at Melbourne after joining Dexter at 19/2. They withstood Alan Davidson&#x27;s burst of speed, but the other bowlers failed to trouble them and by stealing quick ones, twos and threes they rebuilt the innings. Dexter was out for 93, but the stand had made 175 runs and Cowdrey made 113, his third and highest century in Australia, but the celebrations were short lived as he hooked into the hands of Peter Burge off Garth McKenzie. In the second innings he took 30 minutes to score after being dropped off his first ball, but made 52 not out and hit the winning runs to give England a 1–0 lead. 

Despite Cowdrey&#x27;s first innings of 85, Australia won the Third Test to level the series and keep the Ashes, as the final two Tests were drawn. He finished third in the averages with 397 runs (43.77). The tour continued in New Zealand where Cowdrey made 292 runs (146.00) in the three Tests, which England won 3–0. Cowdrey made 86 in the First at Auckland, 128 not out in the Second at Wellington and 43 and 35 not out in the Third at Christchurch. The 128 not out at Wellington made him the first batsman to make a century against six countries, having already made hundreds against Australia, South Africa, the West Indies, India and Pakistan. He made an unbeaten stand of 163 with the wicket-keeper Alan Smith (69 not out) which was a Test record for the 9th wicket until beaten by Asif Iqbal and Intikhab Alam, who made 190 for the 9th wicket against England at the Oval in 1967.

In 1963 Frank Worrell led an exciting West Indies team on their tour of England. They won the First Test at Old Trafford by an innings, with Cowdrey being bowled round his legs by Hall for 4 after swaying away from a delivery which kept lower than he expected. The Second Test at Lord&#x27;s was one of the best he played in. Fred Trueman took 6/100 and Cowdrey three catches to dismiss the tourists for 301 and the captain Ted Dexter thrashed Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith round the ground for 70 off 75 balls in England&#x27;s reply of 297. Dexter couldn&#x27;t field due to an injury taken when batting so Cowdrey led the team and took 3 more catches as Trueman took 5/52 and the West Indies&#x27; 229 relied almost entirely on Basil Butcher&#x27;s 133. Needing 234 to win England were reduced to 31/3, but had recovered to 72/3 when Cowdrey fended a bouncer from Hall off his face and broke his wrist, retiring hurt on 19. Ken Barrington (60) and Brian Close (70) took England to the verge of victory and when Derek Shackleton was run out in the last over they were 228/9, needing five runs to tie, six runs to win, one wicket to lose or to survive two balls for a draw. Cowdrey returned to the crease with his arm in plaster and stood at the non-striker&#x27;s end while Dave Allen blocked the last two balls for a draw. England won the Third Test, but lost the series 3–1 and Cowdrey was unable to play for the rest of the season.

England was to tour India and Pakistan again and Cowdrey was asked to captain the tour, but declined as his arm had not fully healed. Ted Dexter also took a rest and M.J.K. Smith led the team, which soon ran into difficulties as illness and injury reduced them to ten men and they considered calling up the broadcaster Henry Blofeld. Cowdrey was contacted by Lord&#x27;s to recommend a replacement batsman and as the batsmen he would have suggested were contracted to play in South Africa he volunteered to join the team himself. On arrival he was immediately chosen for the Third Test without any match practice (this happened again in Australia in 1974–75), but took three catches and made 107 and 13 not out for a draw. He made 151 in the Fourth Test and 38 in the Fifth to end with 309 runs (103.00) and England survived the series 0–0, the first full Test series which England drew all their matches, but the third time India had managed this. 

Dexter was back in charge in the rain-soaked 1964 Ashes series. Cowdrey played in the First and Second Tests, making 32, 33 and 10, but was injured and England lost the Third Test and with it the series 1–0. Cowdrey returned for the Fifth Test to make 20 and 93 not out, finishing with 188 runs (47.00). More importantly he took the catches for Fred Trueman&#x27;s 299th and 300th Test wickets. In the County Championship Cowdrey&#x27;s captaincy and his long-term plans with Les Ames were starting to pay off as Kent moved up to 7th place. 

Dexter declared himself unavailable for the 1964–65 tour of South Africa as he contested the Cardiff South East seat in the 1964 General Election. Cowdrey did not tour, though he did go to the West Indies with the International Cavaliers, and Mike Smith was made captain, though Dexter joined him as vice-captain after losing to Jim Callaghan. After his 1–0 victory in South Africa Smith was retained as captain and as Dexter broke his leg while parking his car Cowdrey was made vice-captain again. He made 85 in the First Test against New Zealand, 119 in the Second and 13 in the Third as England easily won the series 3–0. South Africa were a tougher prospect with Graeme Pollock making 125 in the Second Test at Trent Bridge and his brother Peter Pollock taking 10/87, Cowdrey came in at 63/3 and made 105 of the 142 runs added while he was at the crease, but it was the only time England lost a Test in which he made a century. He made 58 and 78 not out in the Third Test and 327 runs (65.40), but South Africa won 1–0, their last Test series against England for 29 years. Cowdrey took Kent up to 5th place in the County Championship, compared with 7th in the previous season. 

Though Cowdrey still had his supporters at Lords Smith was kept as captain for the 1965–66 Ashes series with Cowdrey as vice-captain, but they knew each other as schoolboys and Oxford undergraduates and got on well. Cowdrey was ill for most of December and missed the First Test. He made 104 in the Second Test at Melbourne, where England made 558, their biggest total down under since 636 in the Second Test in 1928–29. He did little on the tour except to make 63 and 108 against the weak Tasmanian attack and the series was drawn 1–1 with the batsmen on both sides scoring heavily. Cowdrey himself made 267 runs (53.40), his best batting average in an Ashes series. Carrying on to New Zealand Cowdrey made a duck in the First Test, but recovered with 89 not out in the Second and 58 in the Third which made him the fifth player after Wally Hammond, Don Bradman, Len Hutton and Neil Harvey to make 6,000 Test runs, but the rain affected series was drawn 0–0. 

Mike Smith was kept as captain for only the First Test of the 1966 series against a West Indian side held together by the superb all round skills of their captain Gary Sobers. Sobers won the toss at Old Trafford, batted first and caught England on a spinning wicket for an innings victory, Cowdrey making 69 in the debacle. Smith was dismissed as captain and dropped from the side due to his well-known weakness to the West Indian fast bowlers. Cowdrey was placed in charge, which he accepted reluctantly due to the shoddy treatment of his friend and predecessor. In the Second Test at Lords England were 86 runs ahead in the first innings with the West Indies 95/5 when Sobers and his cousin David Holford added 274 to save the game. Cowdrey was criticised for not surrounding Sobers with fielders at the beginning of his innings, but he maintained that by spreading the field he encouraged him to make the strokes which could have got him out, but there was little doubt that the plan failed.

In the Third Test at Trent Bridge Cowdrey came in at 13/3 and made 96, adding 169 with Tom Graveney (109) to give England a 90 run lead, but Basil Butcher made 209 not out in the West Indian second innings and they won by 139 runs. The Fourth Test at Headingley saw the tourists rattle up 500, enforce the follow on and win by an innings and 55 runs. Like Smith Cowdrey was removed from the captaincy and dropped from the team, to be replaced by the hard-headed Yorkshire captain Brian Close. In an amazing Fifth Test at the Oval the West Indies made 268 and had England 166/7, but the last three wickets added 363 runs and England won by an innings. In the County Championship Cowdrey&#x27;s Kent moved up for the third year in a row to 4th place. 

There was no tour in 1966–67 and Cowdrey was not picked for the first four Tests of the summer, instead concentrating on Kent&#x27;s chances in the County Championship. He was recalled for the Second Test against Pakistan, opening the innings, and made 14 and 2 not out in the 10 wicket victory. The Third Test at the Oval was won as well, but Close had been found guilty of time-wasting in a county match and accosting a spectator who complained of gamesmanship. He was fired as soon as the Test was won and the selectors announced that Cowdrey was to lead the MCC tour of the West Indies, although he disliked the politics and press attention. On a happier note Kent came second in the County Championship to Yorkshire and won their first one-day competition, the Gillette Cup final against Somerset in front of 20,000 fans at Lord&#x27;s. Cowdrey won the toss and batted first, Kent making 193 with man of the match Mike Denness scoring 50 and Brian Luckhurst 54. Somerset were bowled out for 161 with Derek Underwood taking 3/41 for a 32 run victory. 

===1967–68 to 1971===
The tour got off to a bad start when they were outscored in the warm up match against the Barbados Colts, but Cowdrey made 139 against the West Indies Board President&#x27;s XI, adding 249 with Geoff Boycott (135). They batted poorly against Trinidad and Tobago and Colin Milburn made 139 against the Trinidad Colts, but the fast bowler John Snow was ill and went into the First Test at the Port of Spain as underdogs. It was Cowdrey&#x27;s 92nd Test, taking him past Godfrey Evans&#x27;s record of 91 Test caps. He won the toss and made 72 batting at number three, followed by Ken Barrington (143) and vice-captain Tom Graveney (118) to be all out for 568. The West Indies were made to follow on after making 363, but drew the match with 243/8 in the second innings. 

Cowdrey made 107 when the MCC beat Jamaica by 174 runs and they went into the Second Test at Kingston with more confidence. He won the toss again and made 101 in England&#x27;s 376 and forced the West Indies to follow on again when Snow&#x27;s 7/49 dismissed them for 143. The West Indies were 204/5 on the day four and when Basil Butcher was caught behind off Basil D&#x27;Oliveira the crowd rioted and threw bottles onto the outfield. Cowdrey tried to calm the crowd without success and play was abandoned as the police used tear gas to restore order. Cowdrey and the manager Les Ames reluctantly agreed to resume play to help placate the crowd and an extra 75 minutes was added on the sixth day to make up for lost time. Sobers thought it wouldn&#x27;t be needed as they had battled so badly, but the riot had unsettled the England team. The West Indian captain made 113 not out and was able to declare at 391/9, leaving England 190 to win on the extra day. Boycott and Cowdrey made ducks and English crashed to 43/4 at the end of day five and barely survived with 68/8 after the extra time on day six. Sobers took 3/33 and Lance Gibbs 3/11, which would have grave repercussions in the Fourth Test. 

Cowdrey took the next two matches off (which were drawn), but was with Fred Titmus when the off-spinner had four toes cut off by a boat propeller while swimming and drove him to the hospital for surgery, which enabled him to return to cricket after the tour. The Third Test at Bridgetown was a dull draw, with Sobers winning the toss and the West Indies making 349, followed by 449 from England with Boycott (146) and John Edrich (90) adding 172 for the 1st wicket. They returned to Port of Spain for the Fourth Test, Sobers won the toss again and his team made 526/7. England replied with 404, Cowdrey top-scoring with 148 and hitting 21 boundaries. The game looked doomed to another draw when Sobers suddenly declared at 92/2 on the fifth day, leaving England 215 runs to win in 165 minutes. Sobers disliked the thought of playing out five draws in a series and remembered the sudden English collapse in the Third Test which might give him a surprise victory. Though he needed Tom Graveney and Ken Barrington to overcome his natural inclination to safety they set about the runs with Boycott holding up one end with 80 not out and adding 118 in 75 minutes with Cowdrey (71) for a 7 wicket victory with three minutes to spare. Sobers was lambasted throughout the West Indies for his declaration and Cowdrey found him drinking alone in a bar that evening when he was usually surrounded by fans. 

The MCC beat Guyana and England went into the Fifth Test at Bourda with a 1–0 lead. Sobers won the toss again and revived his reputation with an innings of 150, adding 250 with Rohan Kanhai (152) as the West Indies made 414. England made 371 with Boycott (116) and Cowdrey (59) adding 172, then England collapsed to 269/8 before Tony Lock (brought over from Western Australia to replace Titmus) struck 89. Sobers made 95 not out in the West Indies second innings of 264, and England needed 308 to win on the last day. They fell to 41/5, but the four-hour Kent partnership of 127 between Cowdrey (82) and Alan Knott (73 not out) saved the day and England drew the match with a nail-biting 206/9. The win assumed greater proportions over the following years as it would be 32 years before England won another series against the West Indies. Cowdrey finished with 534 runs (66.75), his most prolific Test series and the only one in which he exceeded 500 runs.

Australia had held the Ashes since 1958–59 and Cowdrey was keen to return them to England, but he was frustrated by the damp summer. There was no excuse for the First Test at Old Trafford where Australia made 357 and England fell from 86/0 to 165 all out to the part-time off-spin of Bob Cowper (4/48) and lost by 159 runs, though Basil D&#x27;Oliveira made 87 not out in the second innings. The Second Test was the 200th between the two countries and Colin Milburn hammered 83 and Cowdrey 45 in England&#x27;s 351/7 while Australia were hustled out for 78 after a freak hail storm whitened the ground. 15 hours were lost to the weather and after following on Australia salvaged a draw with 127/4.

The Third Test at Edgbaston was Cowdrey&#x27;s 100th, the first time that anyone had completed a century of Tests. He celebrated by making 104, using Boycott as a runner after straining his leg. He became the second batsman after Wally Hammond to make 7,000 Test runs, but England took 172.5 overs to make 409 and though Australia only made 222 the match was drawn. Both Cowdrey and the Australian captain Bill Lawry were unfit for the Fourth Test, which was drawn when England finished on 230/4 needing 326. Australia&#x27;s 1–0 lead ensured that they held onto the Ashes, but Cowdrey went to the Fifth Test determined to at least even the series. As the ball was swinging at the Oval that season he wanted the bowlers Tom Cartwright and Barry Knight, but they were both unfit and the opener Roger Prideaux caught a virus of the eve of the Test. D&#x27;Oliveira was an all-rounder who could swing the ball so Cowdrey asked for him to cover both needs and he made a politically important 158 in England&#x27;s 494. Australia made 325 and dismissed England for 181, but collapsed to 85/5 at lunch on the last day needing 352 to win when a deluge flooded the Oval. The players started packing their bags, but Cowdrey called on the crowd to help the groundstaff dry the ground. &quot;Like a modern-day King Canute he rolled up his trousers, waded into the water...and supervised the mopping up operations of hundreds of volunteers&quot;, Derek Underwood took 7/50 and England won by 226 runs with six minutes to spare. Kent came second to Yorkshire again in the County Championship, winning more matches, but falling behind on bonus points.

Basil D&#x27;Oliveira was a Cape Coloured who emigrated to England so he could play first-class cricket, from which he was banned in South Africa. When he was not included in the MCC team for South Africa after his match-winning century there was a press storm in what was known as the D&#x27;Oliveira affair. It appeared that he was omitted as he was unacceptable to the South African government, then at the height of apartheid. Cowdrey and the selectors maintained that he had not been chosen for purely cricketing reasons, but when Cartwright was declared unfit they brought in D&#x27;Oliveira, who was the first reserve. To President Vorster of South Africa it looked like the MCC was caving in to anti-apartheid pressure and he cancelled the tour. Cowdrey offered to fly to South Africa to mediate, but it was 26 years before England next played South Africa.

With the South African tour cancelled a new one was arranged to Ceylon and Pakistan, which was in political turmoil that resulted in the fall of President Ayub Khan and imposition of martial law by his successor General Yahya Khan. After a few easy-going matches in Ceylon the tour match against the West Pakistan Governor&#x27;s XI saw play abandoned after 25 overs, there were no other tour matches and all the Tests were affected by political demonstrations against the military regime. In the First Test at Lahore Cowdrey won the toss and made exactly 100, his 22nd Test century to match Wally Hammond&#x27;s England record. England made 309, dismissed Pakistan for 209 and Cowdrey declared the second innings at 225/9 to give them 326 to win, but Pakistan made 203/5 for a draw. Saeed Ahmed won the toss in the Second Test at Dacca in East Pakistan, soon to be Bangladesh, where there was rioting and gunfire around the team hotel. Pakistan made 246, which was matched by England&#x27;s 274, thanks to D&#x27;Oliveira&#x27;s 114 not out. Pakistan took 101 overs to make 196/5 and a token declaration left England to make 33/0. Cowdrey won the toss again in the Third Test at Karachi, but there were riots on the first two days by fans who wanted Hanif Mohammad as captain instead of Saeed. England piled up 502/7, with Colin Milburn making 139 and Tom Graveney 105, but the match was abandoned after demonstrators wrecked the stadium on the morning of the third day, leaving Alan Knott stranded on 96 not out. Cowdrey was not there to see it as he left on the second day after his father-in-law died, leaving Graveney in charge. The team followed on the third day, with manager Les Ames abandoning the Test and the rest of the tour to save the team.

Cowdrey broke the Achilles tendon in his left heel three weeks into the 1969 season and he could not play until the last match in September. The veteran Yorkshire professional Ray Illingworth was his surprise replacement after only a month as captain of Leicestershire. He was chosen over his rivals Brian Close and Tom Graveney as he was not seen as a threat to Cowdrey&#x27;s long-term captaincy due to his age and inability to establish a regular spot in the Test team. However, Illingworth made his maiden Test century in his second Test in charge, beat the West Indies and New Zealand 2–0 each and remained captain even when Cowdrey recovered. Kent suffered from his absence and fell to 10th in the County Championship, but Cowdrey was able to get some match practice in by touring the West Indies with the International Cavaliers and the Duke of Norfolk&#x27;s XI.

The South African tour was cancelled and as the cricketers needed practice against a top team before going to Australia, and to fill MCC coffers, a Rest of the World XI under Gary Sobers was organised from overseas cricketers playing for English counties. Cowdrey was still easing himself back into cricket when the First &#x27;Test&#x27; was played and he was not selected, but played in the other four and made 1 and 64 in the Second, 0 and 71 in the Third, 1 and 0 in the Fourth and 73 and 31 in the Fifth, a total of 241 runs (30.13). England lost the series 4–1, but three of their defeats were close and they were playing the best team in the world. These were counted as Tests at the time, but the ICC subsequently disallowed them. This meant that Cowdrey passed Wally Hammond&#x27;s record of 7,249 Test runs when he made 71 at Trent Bridge to become the most prolific Test batsmen, and would do it again in Australia. 

Cowdrey&#x27;s return to the England team fueled speculation that he was to resume the captaincy from Illingworth, but he did not and in the Third &#x27;Test&#x27; he was told that his rival would be made captain for the Australian tour. He was willing to accompany him as a player, but had to think about being vice-captain again as he thought a younger man should be chosen. In the end he accepted in order to help his Kent teammate David Clark with the administration.

Cowdrey had other considerations in the summer of 1970, which was Kent County Cricket Club&#x27;s Centenary. Kent had been 13th in the County Championship in his first year as captain in 1957, but had improved and were runners up in 1967 and 1968. The county has been short of funds throughout the 60s, but agreed to increase resources for extra staff for the 1970 season, which could only be justified by winning the County Championship for the first time since 1913. Apart from their energetic overseas player Asif Iqbal and the Scottish Mike Denness they had home-grown talent in the shape of Alan Knott, Derek Underwood, Bob Woolmer, Brian Luckhurst, and Alan Ealham. At the start of the season Edward Heath, Kent fan and leader of the Conservative Party, gave a speech at their dinner, saying that 1906 had seen Kent win their first County Championship alongside a change of government and they should do so again in 1970.

In early July it appeared that he had jinxed both their chances with Heath behind in the polls in the General Election and Kent at the bottom of the championship table. The change came when Sussex defeated them in the Gillette Cup, giving them two rest days which Cowdrey used to hammer out their difficulties in a team meeting. They decided to chase bonus points and won 7 and drew 5 of their last 12 games, often by close margins and it was a draw at the Oval, where Cowdrey made 112, that gave them the title with the newly elected Prime Minister Heath at the ground to invite them to a reception at 10 Downing Street to celebrate.

Cowdrey was made vice-captain for an Australian tour for the fourth time and Illingworth&#x27;s tough no-nonsense approach to the game clashed with the MCC tour manager David Clark, who had been captain of Kent in Cowdrey&#x27;s youth and had given him his county cap. As a result, Illingworth effectively took over the running of the tour with the support of the players and Clark&#x27;s influence declined, as did that of Cowdrey, who as his only ally he became isolated, though he still had his Kent teammates Derek Underwood, Alan Knott and Brian Luckhurst. The players tended to avoid the press and public, even to the point of having their meals in their hotel rooms, and only Cowdrey made an effort to meet and greet the cricket fans. The rotund Cowdrey was in the sunset of his career and failed on tour, making only one century – 101 against Victoria – which was so slow that he was likened to a beached whale.

In the First Test he overtook Wally Hammond&#x27;s record of 7,249 runs to become the most prolific Test batsman, a record he held for a year when it was overtaken by Gary Sobers. Cowdrey made only 1 run in the inaugural One Day International at Melbourne and was dropped for the Fourth Test, had his cap stolen while fielding in the Fifth Test and was dropped again for the Sixth and Seventh Tests. Illingworth won an argumentative series 2–0 and regained the Ashes, but Cowdrey only made 82 runs (20.50) in the series. They carried on to New Zealand, and Cowdrey missed the First Test and needed a runner to make 54 and 45 in the Second Test at Auckland, coming in at 63/4 in the second innings when New Zealand had a real chance of winning their first victory against England, but he added 76 with Alan Knott (96), and the danger was averted.

Cowdrey played what he thought was would be his last Test against Pakistan at Edgbaston, making 14 and 34. He was now 38 and a serious bout of pneumonia meant he could not play for half the season, though his 15th year as Kent captain he equalled Lord Harris&#x27;s record and made him the longest serving post-war captain in county cricket. His vice-captain and successor Mike Denness led Kent for most of the season; they fell to 4th in the County Championship and were the finalists in the Gillette Cup, but Cowdrey was unable to play and they lost to Lancashire by 24 runs.

===1972 to 1976===
Cowdrey continued to play for Kent under Mike Denness (who succeeded Ray Illingworth as England captain in 1973) and the county continued its success. It came 2nd in the County Championship in 1972, 4th in 1973, but slipped to 10th in 1974, but won the John Player League in 1972 and 1973, the Benson and Hedges Cup in 1973 (Cowdrey hitting a cheeky 25 not out) and the Gillette Cup again in 1974, beating Lancashire by 4 wickets in the final. With his Test career seemingly over he was appointed a CBE by the Prime Minister Ted Heath in 1972. Cowdrey&#x27;s great milestone was his 100th first-class century, 100 not out against Surrey at Maidstone on 4 July 1974, after which he had a celebratory luncheon at Lords with ex-prime minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home as the guest speaker. 

After the disastrous First Test in Brisbane the tour selectors sent back to London for the 41-year-old Cowdrey as a replacement batsmen. Cowdrey was highly regarded by the MCC team and in particular by Mike Denness, who had succeeded him as captain of Kent. In his 20-year Test career he had faced the Australian fast bowlers Keith Miller, Ray Lindwall, Alan Davidson, Ian Meckiff, Gordon Rorke and even the young Dennis Lillee. Although the Australian press was aghast at such a recall – Cowdrey had not played a Test in four years – the tourists were keen to have a man with the technique and strength of purpose to play the fastest of bowlers. He arrived in Perth with the wives of the MCC team after a 19-hour delay in Bombay, too late to play a practice match, and was called up for the Second Test two days after he arrived and with three hours in the nets. This was his sixth tour of Australia, matching the record of the Lancashire spinner Johnny Briggs.

Cowdrey showed he had lost none of his timing and that his bat was as straight as ever until he was bowled behind his legs by Thomson (2/45) for 22. In the second innings he volunteered to open with David Lloyd instead of the badly bruised Brian Luckhurst. Cowdrey was dropped by Ian Redpath off Lillee, hit on the arm, survived a confident appeal by Rod Marsh before he was finally caught lbw by Thomson for 41, his highest score of the series. After the Second Test Cowdrey made 78 and took 2/27 against South Australia. Before the Third Test at Melbourne Frank Tyson recalled &quot;Colin Cowdrey and John Edrich were unable to practice on Christmas Eve – mainly because of the drizzling rain but also because Cowdrey wanted to spend his birthday in comparative peace. Since both batsmen wanted to feel the ball on bat before the Test, I volunteered the use of the Hawthorn Indoor Cricket Centre, in which I was a partner, for a two-hour work-out on Christmas morning. It was quite a contrast to open the children&#x27;s presents in the early hours and to open the bowling at the two English batsmen before lunch. My fifteen old son, Philip, thought the latter experience to be quite the best of his Christmas presents&quot;. He played his 114th and last Test at Melbourne, and opened the innings again as Lloyd was injured, but only made 7. Even so, England made 529 and won by an innings, with Cowdrey dismissing Rick McCosker for his 120th catch. He was given a warm farewell by his fans in &quot;an impromptu little gathering on the outfield in front of the banner reading &#x27;M.C.G. FANS THANK COLIN – 6 TOURS&#x27;. The central figure, wearing a large straw sun-hat, was signing endless autographs, posing for photographs and exchanging friendly talk with young and old in the way that has made him as popular a cricketer as has ever visited Australia&quot;.

The South African tour of 1975 was cancelled and instead there was Prudential World Cup with the Australians staying on for a Test series afterwards. Their first first-class match after losing the Cup Final was against Kent and Cowdrey has already announced his retirement at the end of the season. Ian Chappell won the toss and declared on 415/8, Kent were out for 202 and Chappell was able to declare his second innings at 140/3 on the last day to set the hosts 354 to win. He was so confident of a win that he ordered a coach for 4 pm to take the team to Southampton for dinner before their next match against Hampshire, but Cowdrey struck 151 not out, Kent won by 4 wickets and the Australians didn&#x27;t reach Southampton until midnight. It was first victory by Kent over Australia since 1899. Cowdrey was asked to captain the MCC against the Australians, but was dismissed for a pair by Lillee, though this did not stop speculation that he would replace Mike Denness as England captain. His 107th and last first-class century was 119 not out against Gloucestershire, but he returned next year for one more game against Surrey when Kent were short of players, making 25 and 15 and taking two catches. Kent, incidentally, went on to win the John Player League in 1976 and the County Championship in 1977–78.

===International centuries===
Cowdrey made 22 Test centuries to equal Wally Hammond&#x27;s England record. This has subsequently been exceeded by a number of players.

Of the 22 Tests in which Cowdrey made a hundred, England won 10, drew 11 and lost one; the defeat was the 1965 match against South Africa at Trent Bridge, in which Cowdrey scored 105. He was the first batsman to score a Test century against six different nations: Australia, South Africa, the West Indies, New Zealand, India and Pakistan – they were the only Test nations during his career. The table below is a list of Cowdrey&#x27;s Test centuries:

==Style and personality==
As a batsman, Cowdrey&#x27;s favourite stroke was the cover drive, at which he excelled, but he had the full array of stokes all around the wicket. His quick reflexes also made him an outstanding slip fielder. Tom Graveney described him as &quot;a masterly batsman with an excellent technique (who) delighted crowds throughout the world with his style and elegance&quot;. However, Cowdrey always feared that his wicket was too important to be thrown away and he was sometimes too cautious when facing certain bowlers. John Arlott noticed this and commented: &quot;Cowdrey could sink into pits of uncertainty when the fire ceased to burn, allowing himself to be dominated by bowlers inferior to him in skill&quot;. Cowdrey himself said: &quot;The proudest thing in my career was that I kept surviving&quot;.

Cowdrey adopted a mostly cautious approach to captaincy but always listened to his players. He would usually set a field as recommended by the bowler and then stick to it, rather than making frequent changes. His greatest asset was man-management as he genuinely cared about his players. For example, he always thanked each bowler at the end of a spell and each batsman at the end of an innings. Tom Graveney said Cowdrey was the best captain he played under.

==Personal life and post-retirement==

While still a player, Cowdrey was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1972 New Year Honours for services to cricket. Following his retirement in 1976, he worked closely behind the scenes at Kent and became President of the MCC in 1986. He was Chairman of the International Cricket Council from 1989 to 1993, when referees and neutral umpires were introduced to international cricket. He served on the board at House of Whitbread Frelims and Barclays Bank International and was a member of the Council of the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust, a Member of the Council of The Cook Society (affiliate of Britain–Australia Society) Having been knighted in the 1992 New Year Honours, Cowdrey became a life peer as Baron Cowdrey of Tonbridge in the 1997 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List; he is one of only two cricketers to be given a life peerage for their services to the sport, the other being Learie Constantine in 1969. Cowdrey was named President of Kent County Cricket Club in 2000, the year he died.

He was married twice. His first wife was Penny Chiesman from 1956 until their divorce in 1985. They were the parents of Kent cricketers Chris and Graham Cowdrey. Cowdrey&#x27;s second wife was Lady Anne Fitzalan-Howard, whom he married in 1985. Cowdrey died of a heart attack on 4 December 2000, aged 67. He is the fourth most recent sportsman to be honoured with a memorial service in Westminster Abbey, following Sir Frank Worrell, Lord Constantine and Bobby Moore. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture was inaugurated in his memory.

As president of the European Commission (EC), Delors was the most visible and influential leader in European affairs. He implemented policies that closely linked the member nations together and promoted the need for unity. He created a single market that made the free movement of persons, capital, goods, and services within the European Economic Community (EEC) possible. He also headed the Delors Committee, which proposed the monetary union to create the euro, a new single currency to replace individual national currencies. This was achieved by the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992.

Delors was a member of the French Socialist Party. Before becoming president of the EC, he was France&#x27;s finance minister from 1981 to 1984, and a member of the European Parliament from 1979 to 1981.

==French politics==
Born in Paris in a family originating from Corrèze, Delors first held in the 1940s through the 1960s a series of posts in French banking and state planning with the Bank of France. As a member of the French Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC), he participated in its secularization and the foundation of the French Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT). In 1969, he became social affairs adviser to the Gaullist Prime Minister Jacques Chaban-Delmas, a move which was presented as part of Chaban&#x27;s outreach to the centre-ground and first attracted media attention to Delors personally.

In 1957, Delors left the CFDT when he became a high government official to avoid conflicts of interests. In 1974, he joined the Socialist Party, with other left-wing Christians. He was one of the rare members of the party to be openly religious, thus challenging its long-standing secular tradition of . He served in the European Parliament from 1979 to 1981, becoming chairman of its Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, actively taking part in debates about economic, social, and monetary policies. Under President François Mitterrand, Delors served as Economics and Finance Minister from 1981 to 1983, and Economics, Finance, and Budget Minister from 1983 to 1984. He advocated a pause in the social policies, a clear acceptance of the market economy, and an alignment with European social democracy. Critically, he held the line on France&#x27;s membership of the European Monetary System (EMS), giving priority to monetary stability over left-wing spending priorities. Mitterrand flirted with the idea of naming him Prime Minister, but never made the appointment.

==President of the European Commission==
Delors became the President of the European Commission in January 1985. During his presidency, he oversaw important budgetary reforms and laid the groundwork for the introduction of a single market within the European Community. It came into effect on 1 January 1993 and allowed the free movement of persons, capital, goods, and services within the Community.

Delors also headed the Committee for the Study of Economic and Monetary Union, widely known as the Delors Committee, that in early 1989 proposed the creation of a new currency—the euro—to replace individual national currencies. This was achieved in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty.

In opposition to the strident neoliberalism of US president Ronald Reagan (1981–1989) that dominated the American political agenda, Delors promoted an alternative interpretation of capitalism that embedded it in the European social structure. He synthesized three themes. First, from the left came support for the redistribution of wealth and protection of the weakest. Second, a neo-mercantilist approach was designed to maximize European industrial output. And the third was reliance on the marketplace. His emphasis on the social dimension of Europe was and remains central to a strong narrative that became a key element of the self-identification of the European Union.

The Delors presidency is considered to have been the apex of the European Commission&#x27;s influence on European integration.

==Post-presidency==
Delors had a longstanding interest in education. As the initiator of a French law in 1971 (, FPC) requiring firms to set aside part of their profits for educational opportunities for their employees, he also chaired a UNESCO Commission on Education for the Twenty-first Century from 1993 to 1996, whose final report was published as &quot;Learning: the Treasure Within&quot;. This work continues to have a significant influence on discourse on lifelong learning, forming the conceptual foundation for both the Canadian Composite Learning Index as well as the European Lifelong Learning Indicators (ELLI) project.

In 1994, members of the Socialist Party attempted to persuade Delors to run for president. Polls showed that he would have a very good chance of defeating either of the main conservative contenders, Prime Minister Édouard Balladur and Mayor of Paris Jacques Chirac. However Delors declined to run and the eventual Socialist nominee, Lionel Jospin, was defeated in the 1995 presidential election by Jacques Chirac.

Delors founded the Paris-based, centre-left think tank Notre Europe in 1996 and remained one of its presidents for the rest of his life. He was president of the , and an honorary member of both the Institut Aspen France and the Club of Rome.

On 15 September 2010, Delors supported the new initiative Spinelli Group, which was founded to reinvigorate the striving for federalization of the European Union. Other prominent supporters include Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Guy Verhofstadt, Sylvie Goulard, Andrew Duff, and Elmar Brok. In 2010, Delors was the first to be given the Leonardo European Corporate Learning Award.

In 2012, Delors stated in the &quot;Handelsblatt&quot; newspaper that &quot;If the British cannot support the trend towards more integration in Europe, we can nevertheless remain friends, but on a different basis. I could imagine a form such as a European economic area or a free-trade agreement.&quot;

On 25 June 2015, Donald Tusk announced that Delors would become the third person to have the title of Honorary Citizen of Europe bestowed upon them, in recognition of &quot;his remarkable contribution to the development of the European project&quot;.

In March 2024, Delors was posthumously given a &quot;Special Recognition&quot; award at &quot;The Parliament Magazine&quot; annual MEP Awards, in recognition of his contributions towards the European project, to mark the awards&#x27; 20th anniversary.

==Personal life and death==
Delors was married to Marie Lephaille until her death in 2020. They had a daughter, Martine Aubry, who served as First Secretary of the Socialist Party from 2008 to 2012, and a son, Jean-Paul Delors, who was a journalist and died aged 29 in 1982 from leukaemia.

Delors died in his sleep at his home in Paris, on 27 December 2023, aged 98. He was honored with a state funeral at the Hôtel des Invalides in Paris on 5 January in the presence of political figures from all over Europe before his burial alongside his wife and his son at the Fontaine-la-Gaillarde cemetery.

<text>The Yukaghirs, or Yukagirs ( (), ), are a Siberian ethnic group in the Russian Far East, living in the basin of the Kolyma River.

==Geographic distribution==

The Tundra Yukaghirs live in the Lower Kolyma region in the Sakha Republic; the Taiga Yukaghirs in the Upper Kolyma region in the Sakha Republic and in Srednekansky District of Magadan Oblast. By the time of Russian colonization in the 17th century, the Yukaghir tribal groups occupied territories from the Lena River to the mouth of the Anadyr River. The number of the Yukaghirs decreased between the 17th and 19th centuries due to epidemics, internecine wars and Tsarist colonial policy which may have included genocide against the sedentary hunter-fisher Anaouls. Some of the Yukaghirs have assimilated with the Yakuts, Evens, and Russians.

Currently, Yukaghirs live in the Sakha Republic and the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug of the Russian Federation. According to the 2002 Census, their total number was 1,509 people, up from 1,112 recorded in the 1989 Census.

According to the latest 2001 all Ukrainian census, 12 Yukaghirs are living in Ukraine. Only 2 of them indicated Yukaghir as their native language. For the remaining others (6) it is Russian and for 1 it is some other tongue.

Yukaghirs (including Chuvans) by selected settlements:
== Genetics ==
Genetically, Yukaghirs exhibit roughly equal frequencies of the Y-DNA haplogroups N1c, Q1, and C2 (formerly C3). 

According to another study, out of 11 Yukaghir males 3 turned out to belong to the Y-haplogroup N1c (different subclade from the one found in Yakuts), another 4 - to the Y-haplogroup C2 (former C3; for the most part, the same subclade that&#x27;s also found in Koryaks), one more - to the Y-haplogroup O, and the rest 3 exhibit apparent Russian genetic influence (two individuals belonging to the Y-haplogroup R1a, and one more - to the Y-haplogroup I2a). The study also found no similarities between Yukaghirs and Chukchis in regards to mitochondrial DNA.

==Subethnic groups==

Modern Yukaghirs are thought to be descendants of the late Neolithic Ymyyakhtakh culture.

The 13 tribes that once constituted the Yukaghir group are: Vadul-Alais, Odul, Chuvan, Anaoul, Lavren, Olyuben, Omok, Penjin, Khodynts, Khoromoy, Shoromboy, Yandin, and Yandyr. 

The surviving three tribes are the Odul of Nelemnoe, the Vadul of Andryushkino and the Chuvan of the Anadyr river area. Of the extinct groups, the most important were the Khodynts, the Anaoul (both of the Anadyr River area), and the Omok (north of the Chuvan). Sometimes the Chuvan are considered a separate people. The Chuvantsy language has been extinct since the early 20th century. In 2002, 1,087 identified themselves as Chuvan compared to more than 1,300 in 1989. The Vadul are mainly involved in reindeer herding while the Odul (Kogime) are mostly hunter-gatherers. The Vadul are also known as Tundra Yukaghir. The Odul are also known as Taiga Yukaghir or Kolyma Yukaghir. The Vadul and Odul languages are as different as German is from Dutch. Both are nearing extinction, and Odul is in a much weaker state compared to Vadul. In the 1989 census, more than 700 of the Yukaghirs identified as Vadul while fewer than 400 were Odul.

The Yukaghir are one of the oldest peoples in North-Eastern Asia. Originally they lived over a huge territory from Lake Baikal to the Arctic Ocean. By the time of the first encounter with Russians, Yukaghir were divided into twelve tribes with around 9,000 people. The Yukagir ethnonym is &quot;Odul&quot; or &quot;Vadul&quot;, which means “mighty”.

Tribal divisions among the Yukaghir are fading now, although in every census from 1926, significant number of tribesmen identified themselves with tribal divisions like Anaoul, Odul and Vadul rather than describing themselves as Yukaghir. The Soviet government actively discouraged this tendency and now only the most elderly identify this way. In the 2002 census, out of the 1,509 Yukaghirs, 51 identified themselves as Omok, 40 as Alais, 21 as Odul, 17 as Vadul, 6 as Khangait and 4 as Detkil.

===Clan system===
The head of every clan was an elder called a &quot;Ligey Shomorokh&quot;. His was the final word in all aspects of life. Hunting leaders were &quot;Khangitche&quot;, and war leaders were &quot;Tonbaia Shomorokh&quot; (&quot;the mighty man&quot;). Women and teenagers had equal voices with men. The internal life of the community was under the control of the older women. Their decisions in those matters were indisputable.

In the beginning of every summer all clans gathered for the &quot;Sakhadzibe&quot; festival, where mutual Yukaghir questions were discussed.

In the Yakut-Sakha Republic there are three nomadic extended family communities. These are Tchaila in Nizhnekolymsky District, Teki Odulok in Verkhnekolymsky District and Ianugail in Ust-Yansky District. The head of Ianugail is I. I. Tomsky. The community&#x27;s main activities are deer hunting and fishing. Tchaila is the biggest of the three. Its head is S. I. Kurilov. They have 4000 domesticated reindeer, 200 horses, and 20 cows. The community also hunts deer and polar foxes. There is also a shop where traditional skin and fur garments are made. The head of Teki Odulok is N. I. Shalugin. Their base is the village of Nelemnoe. This community is in the most difficult situation. Due to the “creative interpretation” of various Perestroika and privatization laws by the local and district administration and so-called businessmen, the community has lost all their reindeer, cows and even part of its land. All they have left are about 50 horses. They have no money for supplies for hunting and fishing. 80% of all adult population is &quot;de facto&quot; unemployed.

The highest forum for Yukagir is the all-people gathering &quot;Suktuul&quot;.

==Culture==
The main traditional activity is nomadic and semi-nomadic hunting of deer, moose, wild sheep, and sable, as well as fishing. Reindeer are bred mostly for transportation. Horses are known among the Yukaghir as &quot;domestic reindeer of Yakuts&quot; (&quot;Yoqod ile&quot; in Tundra Yukaghir or &quot;Yaqad āçə&quot; in Kolyma Yukaghir). A Yukaghir house is called a &quot;chum&quot;.

The decline of traditional economic activities, the unfavorable environmental situation of the Yukaghir&#x27;s traditional lands and waters, and the absence of local and federal laws and executive mechanisms protecting indigenous peoples in Russia, have not aided the welfare and continuation of traditional Yukaghir communities. The average life span for men is 45 years, and 54 years for women. Child mortality is the highest in the Yakut-Sakha Republic. In addition, one expedition made to the Yukaghir found that most had no knowledge of traditional Yukaghir culture.

===Language===
The Yukaghir languages are a small language family of two closely related languages, Tundra Yukaghir and Kolyma Yukaghir, although there used to be more. They are unclassified languages: their origin and relation to other languages are unknown; some scholars consider them distantly related to the Uralic languages, but this classification is not accepted by the majority of specialists in Uralic linguistics. The languages are regarded as moribund, since less than 370 people can speak either Yukaghir language. Most Yukaghirs today speak Yakut and Russian.

===Religion===
Alongside Russian Orthodox beliefs, Yukaghirs practice shamanism. The dominant cults are ancestral spirits, the spirits of Fire, Sun (Pugu), Hunting, Earth, and Water, which can act as protectors or as enemies of people. The most important is the cult of &quot;Pugu&quot;, the Sun, who is the highest judge in all disputes. The spirits of the dead go to a place called &quot;Aibidzi&quot;. Every clan had a shaman called an &quot;alma&quot;. After death every &quot;alma&quot; was treated as a deity, and the body of the dead &quot;alma&quot; was dismembered and kept by the clan as relics. The Yukaghir still continue traditions stemming from their origins as nomadic reindeer-hunters: they practice dog sacrifice and have an epic poem based around crows. The animal cult was especially strong in the elk cult. There was a number of rituals and taboos connected with elk and deer hunting.

<doc id="165723" wikidata="Q49767" url="?curid=165723" title="François-René de Chateaubriand">
<text>François-René, vicomte de Chateaubriand (4 September 1768 – 4 July 1848) was a French writer, politician, diplomat and historian who influenced French literature of the nineteenth century. Descended from an old aristocratic family from Brittany, Chateaubriand was a royalist by political disposition. In an age when large numbers of intellectuals turned against the Church, he authored the &quot;Génie du christianisme&quot; in defense of the Catholic faith. His works include the autobiography &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;Outre-Tombe&quot; (&quot;Memoirs from Beyond the Grave&quot;), published posthumously in 1849–1850.

Historian Peter Gay said that Chateaubriand saw himself as the greatest lover, the greatest writer, and the greatest philosopher of his age. Gay states that Chateaubriand &quot;dominated the literary scene in France in the first half of the nineteenth century&quot;.

== Biography ==

=== Early years and exile ===
Born in Saint-Malo on 4 September 1768, the last of ten children, Chateaubriand grew up at his family&#x27;s castle (the château de Combourg) in Combourg, Brittany. His father, René de Chateaubriand, was a sea captain turned ship-owner and slave trader. His mother&#x27;s maiden name was Apolline de Bedée. Chateaubriand&#x27;s father was a morose, uncommunicative man, and the young Chateaubriand grew up in an atmosphere of gloomy solitude, only broken by long walks in the Breton countryside and an intense friendship with his sister Lucile. His youthful solitude and wild desire produced a suicide attempt with a hunting rifle, although the weapon failed to discharge.

English agriculturist and pioneering travel writer Arthur Young visited Comburg in 1788 and he described the immediate environs of the &quot;romantic&quot; Chateau de Combourg thusly:

&quot;SEPTEMBER 1st. To Combourg, the country has a savage aspect; husbandry not much further advanced, at least in skill, than among the Hurons, which appears incredible amidst inclosures; the people almost as wild as their country, and their town of Combourg one of the most brutal filthy places that can be seen; mud houses, no windows, and a pavement so broken, as to impede all passengers, but ease none - yet here is a chateau, and inhabited; who is this Mons. de Chateaubriant, the owner, that has nerves strung for a residence amidst such filth and poverty? Below this hideous heap of wretchedness is a fine lake...&quot;

Chateaubriand was educated in Dol, Rennes and Dinan. For a time he could not make up his mind whether he wanted to be a naval officer or a priest, but at the age of seventeen, he decided on a military career and gained a commission as a second lieutenant in the French Army based at Navarre. Within two years, he had been promoted to the rank of captain. He visited Paris in 1788 where he made the acquaintance of Jean-François de La Harpe, André Chénier, Louis-Marcelin de Fontanes and other leading writers of the time. When the French Revolution broke out, Chateaubriand was initially sympathetic, but as events in Paris - and throughout the countryside (including, presumably, &quot;wretched&quot; &quot;brutal&quot; and &quot;filthy&quot; Combourg) - became more violent he wisely decided to journey to North America in 1791. He was given the idea to leave Europe by Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes, who also encouraged him to do some botanical studies.

=== Journey to America ===

In &quot;Voyage en Amérique&quot;, published in 1826, Chateaubriand writes that he arrived in Philadelphia on 10 July 1791. He visited New York, Boston and Lexington, before leaving by boat on the Hudson River to reach Albany. He then followed the Mohawk Trail up the Niagara Falls where he broke his arm and spent a month in recovery in the company of a Native American tribe. Chateaubriand then describes Native American tribes&#x27; customs, as well as zoological, political and economic consideration. He then says that a raid along the Ohio River, the Mississippi River, Louisiana and Florida took him back to Philadelphia, where he embarked on the &quot;Molly&quot; in November to go back to France.

This experience provided the setting for his exotic novels &quot;Les Natchez&quot; (written between 1793 and 1799 but published only in 1826), &quot;Atala&quot; (1801) and &quot;René&quot; (1802). His vivid, captivating descriptions of nature in the sparsely settled American Deep South were written in a style that was very innovative for the time and spearheaded what later became the Romantic movement in France. As early as 1916, some scholars have cast doubt on Chateaubriand&#x27;s claims that he was granted an interview with George Washington and that he actually lived for a time with the Native Americans he wrote about. Critics have questioned the veracity of entire sections of Chateaubriand&#x27;s claimed travels, notably his passage through the Mississippi Valley, Louisiana and Florida.

=== Return to France ===
Chateaubriand returned to France in 1792 and subsequently joined the army of Royalist &quot;émigrés&quot; in Koblenz under the leadership of Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Condé. Under strong pressure from his family, he married a young aristocratic woman, also from Saint-Malo, whom he had never previously met, Céleste Buisson de la Vigne (in later life, Chateaubriand was notoriously unfaithful to her, having a series of love affairs). His military career came to an end when he was wounded at the Siege of Thionville, a major clash between Royalist troops (of which Chateaubriand was a member) and the French Revolutionary Army. Half-dead, he was taken to Jersey and exiled to England, leaving his wife behind.

=== Exile in London ===
Chateaubriand spent most of his exile in poverty in London, scraping a living offering French lessons and doing translation work, but also worked as a French teacher in Beccles in Suffolk. While he was in Suffolk he fell in love with Charlotte Ives, the daughter of a clergyman living in Bungay, but the romance ended when he was forced to reveal he was already married. During his time in Britain, Chateaubriand also became familiar with English literature. This reading, particularly of John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (which he later translated into French prose), had a deep influence on his own literary work.

His exile forced Chateaubriand to examine the causes of the French Revolution, which had cost the lives of many of his family and friends; these reflections inspired his first work, &quot;Essai sur les Révolutions&quot; (1797). An attempt in 18th-century style to explain the French Revolution, it predated his subsequent, romantic style of writing and was largely ignored. A major turning point in Chateaubriand&#x27;s life was his conversion back to the Catholic faith of his childhood around 1798.

===Consulate and Empire===
Chateaubriand took advantage of the amnesty issued to &quot;émigrés&quot; to return to France in May 1800 (under the French Consulate); he edited the &quot;Mercure de France&quot;. In 1802, he won fame with &quot;Génie du christianisme&quot; (&quot;The Genius of Christianity&quot;), an apologia for the Catholic faith which contributed to the post-revolutionary religious revival in France. It also won him the favour of Napoleon Bonaparte, who was eager to win over the Catholic Church at the time.

James McMillan argues that a Europe-wide Catholic Revival emerged from the change in the cultural climate from intellectually-oriented classicism to emotionally-based Romanticism. He concludes that Chateaubriand&#x27;s book:
Appointed secretary of the legation to the Holy See by Napoleon, he accompanied Cardinal Fesch to Rome. But the two men soon quarrelled, and Chateaubriand was appointed minister to the Republic of Valais in November 1803. He resigned his post in disgust after Napoleon ordered the execution in 1804 of Louis XVI&#x27;s cousin, Louis-Antoine-Henri de Bourbon-Condé, duc d&#x27;Enghien. Chateaubriand was, after his resignation, completely dependent on his literary efforts. However, and quite unexpectedly, he received a large sum of money from the Russian Tsarina Elizabeth Alexeievna. She had seen him as a defender of Christianity and thus worthy of her royal support.

Chateaubriand used his new-found wealth in 1806 to visit Greece, Asia Minor, The Ottoman Empire, Egypt, Tunisia, and Spain. The notes he made on his travels later formed part of a prose epic, &quot;Les Martyrs&quot;, set during the Roman persecution of early Christianity. His notes also furnished a running account of the trip itself, published in 1811 as the &quot;Itinéraire de Paris à Jérusalem&quot; (&quot;Itinerary from Paris to Jerusalem&quot;). The Spanish stage of the journey inspired a third novella, &quot;Les aventures du dernier Abencérage&quot; (&quot;The Adventures of the Last Abencerrage&quot;), which appeared in 1826.

On his return to France at the end of 1806, he published a severe criticism of Napoleon, comparing him to Nero and predicting the emergence of a new Tacitus. Napoleon famously threatened to have Chateaubriand sabred on the steps of the Tuileries Palace for it, but settled for merely banishing him from the city. Chateaubriand therefore retired, in 1807, to a modest estate he called &quot;Vallée-aux-Loups&quot; (&quot;Wolf Valley&quot;), in Châtenay-Malabry, south of central Paris, where he lived until 1817. Here he finished &quot;Les Martyrs&quot;, which appeared in 1809, and began the first drafts of his &quot;Mémoires d’Outre-Tombe&quot;. He was elected to the Académie française in 1811, but, given his plan to infuse his acceptance speech with criticism of the Revolution, he could not occupy his seat until after the Bourbon Restoration. His literary friends during this period included Madame de Staël, Joseph Joubert and Pierre-Simon Ballanche.

=== Under the Restoration ===
Chateaubriand became a major figure in politics as well as literature. At first he was a strong Royalist in the period up to 1824. His liberal phase lasted from 1824 to 1830. After that he was much less active.
After the fall of Napoleon, Chateaubriand rallied to the Bourbons. On 30 March 1814, he wrote a pamphlet against Napoleon, titled &quot;De Buonaparte et des Bourbons&quot;, of which thousands of copies were published. He then followed Louis XVIII into exile to Ghent during the Hundred Days (March–July 1815), and was nominated ambassador to Sweden.

After Napoleon&#x27;s final defeat in the Battle of Waterloo (of which he heard the distant cannon rumblings outside Ghent), Chateaubriand became peer of France and state minister (1815). In December 1815 he voted for Marshal Ney&#x27;s execution. However, his criticism of King Louis XVIII in &quot;La Monarchie selon la Charte&quot;, after the &quot;Chambre introuvable&quot; was dissolved, resulted in his disgrace. He lost his function of state minister, and joined the opposition, siding with the Ultra-royalist group supporting the future Charles X, and becoming one of the main writers of its mouthpiece, &quot;Le Conservateur&quot;.

Chateaubriand sided again with the Court after the murder of the Duc de Berry (1820), writing for the occasion the &quot;Mémoires sur la vie et la mort du duc&quot;. He then served as ambassador to Prussia (1821) and the United Kingdom (1822), and even rose to the office of Minister of Foreign Affairs (28 December 1822 – 4 August 1824). A plenipotentiary to the Congress of Verona (1822), he decided in favor of the Quintuple Alliance&#x27;s intervention in Spain during the &quot;Trienio Liberal&quot;, despite opposition from the Duke of Wellington. Chateaubriand was soon relieved of his office by Prime Minister Joseph de Villèle on 5 June 1824, over his objections to a law the latter proposed that would have resulted in the widening of the electorate. Chateaubriand was subsequently appointed French ambassador to Genoa.

Consequently, he moved towards the liberal opposition, both as a Peer and as a contributor to &quot;Journal des Débats&quot; (his articles there gave the signal of the paper&#x27;s similar switch, which, however, was more moderate than &quot;Le National&quot;, directed by Adolphe Thiers and Armand Carrel). Opposing Villèle, he became highly popular as a defender of press freedom and the cause of Greek independence. After Villèle&#x27;s downfall, Charles X appointed Chateaubriand ambassador to the Holy See in 1828, but he resigned upon the accession of the Prince de Polignac as premier (November 1829).

In 1830, he donated a monument to the French painter Nicolas Poussin in the church of San Lorenzo in Lucina in Rome.

=== July Monarchy ===

In 1830, after the July Revolution, his refusal to swear allegiance to the new House of Orléans king Louis-Philippe put an end to his political career. He withdrew from political life to write his &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;Outre-Tombe&quot; (&quot;Memoirs from Beyond the Grave&quot;), published posthumously in two volumes in 1849–1850. It reflects his growing pessimism regarding the future. Although his contemporaries celebrated the present and future as an extension of the past, Chateaubriand and the new Romanticists couldn&#x27;t share their nostalgic outlook. Instead he foresaw chaos, discontinuity, and disaster. His diaries and letters often focused on the upheavals he could see every day — abuses of power, excesses of daily life, and disasters yet to come. His melancholy tone suggested astonishment, surrender, betrayal, and bitterness.

His &quot;Études historiques&quot; was an introduction to a projected &quot;History of France&quot;. He became a harsh critic of the &quot;bourgeois king&quot; Louis-Philippe and the July Monarchy, and his planned volume on the arrest of Marie-Caroline, duchesse de Berry caused him to be (unsuccessfully) prosecuted.

Chateaubriand, along with other Catholic traditionalists such as Ballanche or, on the other side of the political divide, the socialist and republican Pierre Leroux, was one of the few men of his time who attempted to conciliate the three terms of &quot;Liberté&quot;, &quot;égalité&quot; and &quot;fraternité&quot;, going beyond the antagonism between liberals and socialists as to what interpretation to give the seemingly contradictory terms. Chateaubriand thus gave a Christian interpretation of the revolutionary motto, stating in the 1841 conclusion to his &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;Outre-Tombe&quot;:

In his final years, he lived as a recluse in an apartment at 120 rue du Bac, Paris, leaving his house only to pay visits to Juliette Récamier in Abbaye-aux-Bois. His final work, &quot;Vie de Rancé&quot;, was written at the suggestion of his confessor and published in 1844. It is a biography of Armand Jean le Bouthillier de Rancé, a worldly seventeenth-century French aristocrat who withdrew from society to become the founder of the Trappist order of monks. The parallels with Chateaubriand&#x27;s own life are striking. As late as 1845–1847, he also kept revising &quot;Mémoires d’Outre-Tombe&quot;, particularly the earlier sections, as evidenced by the revision dates on the manuscript.

Chateaubriand died in Paris on 4 July 1848, aged 79, in the midst of the Revolution of 1848, in the arms of his dear friend Juliette Récamier, and was buried, as he had requested, on the tidal island Grand Bé near Saint-Malo, accessible only when the tide is out.

== Influence ==
His descriptions of Nature and his analysis of emotion made him the model for a generation of Romantic writers, not only in France but also abroad. For example, Lord Byron was deeply impressed by &quot;René&quot;. The young Victor Hugo scribbled in a notebook, &quot;To be Chateaubriand or nothing.&quot; Even his enemies found it hard to avoid his influence. Stendhal, who despised him for political reasons, made use of his psychological analyses in his own book &quot;De l&#x27;amour&quot;.

Chateaubriand was the first to define the &quot;vague des passions&quot; (&quot;intimations of passion&quot;) that later became a commonplace of Romanticism: &quot;One inhabits, with a full heart, an empty world&quot; (&quot;Génie du Christianisme&quot;). His political thought and actions seem to offer numerous contradictions: he wanted to be the friend both of legitimist royalty and of republicans, alternately defending whichever of the two seemed more in danger: &quot;I am a Bourbonist out of honour, a monarchist out of reason, and a republican out of taste and temperament&quot;. He was the first of a series of French men of letters (Lamartine, Victor Hugo, André Malraux, Paul Claudel) who tried to mix political and literary careers.

&quot;We are convinced that the great writers have told their own story in their works&quot;, wrote Chateaubriand in &quot;Génie du christianisme&quot;. &quot;One only truly describes one&#x27;s own heart by attributing it to another, and the greater part of genius is composed of memories&quot;. This is certainly true of Chateaubriand himself. All his works have strong autobiographical elements, overt or disguised.

George Brandes, in 1901, compared the works of Chateaubriand to those of Rousseau and others:
The year 1800 was the first to produce a book bearing the imprint of the new era, a work small in size, but great in significance and mighty in the impression it made. &quot;Atala&quot; took the French public by storm in a way which no book had done since the days of &quot;Paul and Virginia&quot;. It was a romance of the plains and mysterious forests of North America, with a strong, strange aroma of the untilled soil from which it sprang; it glowed with rich foreign colouring, and with the fiercer glow of consuming passion.
Chateaubriand was a food enthusiast; Chateaubriand steak is most likely to have been named after him.

==Honors and memberships==
In 1806, Chateaubriand was invested as a Knight of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem during a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.

Chateaubriand was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1816.

A French school in Rome (Italy) is named after him.

The cut of meat, a Chateaubriand, is named after him.

<text>Vincent Eugene Craddock (February 11, 1935 – October 12, 1971), known as Gene Vincent, was an American rock and roll musician who pioneered the style of rockabilly. His 1956 top ten hit with his backing band the Blue Caps, &quot;Be-Bop-a-Lula&quot;, is considered a significant early example of rockabilly. His chart career was brief, especially in his home country of the US, where he notched three top 40 hits in 1956 and 1957, and never charted in the top 100 again. In the UK, he was a somewhat bigger star, racking up eight top 40 hits from 1956 to 1961.

Vincent was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. He is sometimes referred to by his somewhat unusual nickname/moniker the &quot;Screaming End&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Craddock was born February 11, 1935, in Norfolk, Virginia, to Mary Louise and Ezekiah Jackson Craddock. His musical influences included country, rhythm and blues, and gospel. His favorite composition was Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Egmont&quot; overture. He showed his first real interest in music while his family lived in Munden Point (now Virginia Beach), in Princess Anne County, Virginia, near the North Carolina line, where they ran a country store. He received his first guitar at the age of twelve as a gift from a friend.

Craddock&#x27;s father volunteered to serve in the U.S. Coast Guard and patrolled American coastal waters to protect Allied shipping against German U-boats during World War II. Craddock&#x27;s mother maintained the general store in Munden Point. His parents moved the family to Norfolk, the home of a large naval base, and opened a general store and sailors&#x27; tailoring shop.

Craddock dropped out of school in 1952, at the age of seventeen, and enlisted in the United States Navy. As he was under the age of enlistment, his parents signed the forms allowing him to enter. He completed boot camp and joined the fleet as a crewman aboard the fleet oiler , with a two-week training period in the repair ship , before returning to the &quot;Chukawan&quot;. He never saw combat but completed a Korean War deployment. He sailed home from Korean waters aboard the battleship but was not part of the ship&#x27;s company.

Craddock planned a career in the Navy and, in 1955, used his $612 re-enlistment bonus to buy a new Triumph motorcycle. On July 4, 1955, while he was in Norfolk, his left leg was shattered in an auto crash. He refused to allow the leg to be amputated, and the leg was saved, but the injury left him with a limp and pain. He wore a steel sheath as a leg brace for the rest of his life. Most accounts relate the accident as the fault of a drunk driver who struck him. Years later in some of his music biographies, there is no mention of an accident, but it was claimed that his injury was due to a wound incurred in combat in Korea. He spent time in the Portsmouth Naval Hospital and was medically discharged from the navy shortly thereafter.

===Early music career===
Craddock became involved in the local music scene in Norfolk. He changed his name to Gene Vincent and formed a rockabilly band, Gene Vincent and His Blue Caps (a term used in reference to enlisted sailors in the U.S. Navy). The band included Willie Williams on rhythm guitar (replaced in late 1956 by Paul Peek), Jack Neal on upright bass, Dickie Harrell on drums (died May 31, 2023, at age 82), and Cliff Gallup on lead guitar. He also collaborated with another rising musician, Jay Chevalier of Rapides Parish, Louisiana. Vincent and His Blue Caps soon gained a reputation playing in various country bars in Norfolk. There they won a talent contest organized by a local radio DJ, &quot;Sheriff Tex&quot; Davis, who then became Vincent&#x27;s manager.

===Biggest hits===
In 1956 he wrote &quot;Be-Bop-a-Lula&quot;, which drew comparisons to Elvis Presley and which &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine later listed as number 103 on its &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. Local radio DJ &quot;Sheriff Tex&quot; Davis arranged for a demo of the song to be made, and this secured Vincent a contract with Capitol Records. He signed a publishing contract with Bill Lowery of the Lowery Group of music publishers in Atlanta, Georgia. &quot;Be-Bop-a-Lula&quot; was not on Vincent&#x27;s first album and was picked by Capitol producer Ken Nelson as the B-side of his first single, &quot;Woman Love&quot;. Prior to the release of the single, Lowery pressed promotional copies of &quot;Be-Bop-a-Lula&quot; and sent them to radio stations throughout the country. By the time Capitol released the single, &quot;Be-Bop-a-Lula&quot; had already gained attention from the public and radio DJs. The song was picked up and played by other U.S. radio stations (obscuring the original A-side song) and became a hit, peaking at number 7 and spending 20 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart and reaching number 5 and spending 17 weeks on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; chart, and launching Vincent&#x27;s career as a rock-and-roll star.

After &quot;Be-Bop-a-Lula&quot; became a hit, Vincent and His Blue Caps were unable to follow it up with the same level of commercial success, although they released critically acclaimed songs like &quot;Race with the Devil&quot; (number 96 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and number 50 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; chart) and &quot;Bluejean Bop&quot; (number 49 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and another million-selling disc).

Cliff Gallup left the band in 1956, and Russell Williford joined as the new guitarist for the Blue Caps. Williford played and toured Canada with Vincent in late 1956 but left the group in early 1957. Gallup came back to do the next album and then left again. Williford came back and exited again before Johnny Meeks joined the band. The group had another hit in 1957 with &quot;Lotta Lovin&#x27; (highest position number 13 and spending 19 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and number 17 and 17 weeks on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; chart). Vincent was awarded gold records for two million sales of &quot;Be-Bop-a-Lula&quot;, and 1.5 million sales of &quot;Lotta Lovin. The same year he toured the east coast of Australia with Little Richard and Eddie Cochran, drawing audiences totaling 72,000 to their Sydney Stadium concerts. Vincent also made an appearance in the film &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot;, with Jayne Mansfield, performing &quot;Be-Bop-a-Lula&quot; with the Blue Caps in a rehearsal room. &quot;Dance to the Bop&quot; was released by Capitol Records on October 28, 1957. On November 17, 1957, Vincent and His Blue Caps performed the song on the nationally broadcast television program &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. The song spent nine weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and peaked at number 23 on January 23, 1958 and reached number 36 and spent eight weeks on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; chart. It was Vincent&#x27;s last American hit single. The song was used in the movie &quot;Hot Rod Gang&quot; for a dance rehearsal scene featuring dancers doing the West Coast Swing.

Vincent and His Blue Caps also appeared several times on &quot;Town Hall Party&quot;, California&#x27;s largest country music barn dance, held at the Town Hall in Compton, California. They appeared on October 25, 1958, and July 25 and November 7, 1959. However, by the end of 1959 the Blue Caps were no longer part of the billing on Gene Vincent records. The late 1959 single &quot;Wild Cat&quot; was credited solely to Gene Vincent, and this would be the case on all subsequent Gene Vincent releases.

===Europe===
A dispute with the US tax authorities and the American Musicians&#x27; Union over payments to his band and his having sold the band&#x27;s equipment to pay a tax bill led Vincent to leave the United States for Europe.

On December 15, 1959, Vincent appeared on Jack Good&#x27;s TV show, &quot;Boy Meets Girl&quot;, his first appearance in England. He wore black leather, gloves, and a medallion, and stood in a hunched posture. Good is credited with the transformation of Vincent&#x27;s image. After the TV appearance he toured France, the Netherlands, Germany and the UK performing in his US stage clothes.

On April 16, 1960, while on tour in the UK, Vincent, Eddie Cochran and the songwriter Sharon Sheeley were involved in a high-speed traffic accident in a private-hire taxi in Chippenham, Wiltshire. Vincent broke his ribs and collarbone and further damaged his weakened leg. Sheeley suffered a broken pelvis. Cochran, who had been thrown from the vehicle, suffered serious brain injuries and died the next day. Vincent returned to the United States after the accident.

While they were preparing to board their taxi, Vincent and Cochran had rebuffed Tony Sheridan&#x27;s request to ride along with them to the next venue. After escaping that fateful road accident, Sheridan soon relocated to Hamburg, where he helped influence the musical training of many British groups who would later become part of the British Invasion, including one of his backing bands, the Beatles.

Promoter Don Arden had Vincent return to the UK in 1961 to do an extensive tour in theatres and ballrooms, including the Agincourt Ballroom, Camberley with Chris Wayne and the Echoes. In 1962 Vincent was on the same bill as the Beatles in Hamburg; Paul McCartney recalled an incident with a pistol at Vincent&#x27;s girlfriend&#x27;s hotel. In 1963 Vincent appeared in court for pointing a gun at his then wife Margaret Russell and threatening to kill her, though his wife said in court that she had forgiven him. After the overwhelming success of the UK tour, Vincent moved to Britain in 1963. On a UK tour Vincent had pulled a gun on Jet Harris, Harris hid behind John Leyton, the situation was defused and the three would later become friends. His accompanying band, Sounds Incorporated, a six-piece outfit with three saxophones, guitar, bass and drums, went on to play with the Beatles at their Shea Stadium concert. Vincent toured the UK again in 1963 with the Outlaws, featuring future Deep Purple guitar player Ritchie Blackmore, as a backing band. Vincent&#x27;s alcohol problems marred the tour, resulting in problems both on stage and with the band and management.

===Later career===

Vincent&#x27;s attempts to re-establish his American career in folk rock and country rock proved unsuccessful; he is remembered today for recordings of the 1950s and early 1960s released by Capitol Records. In the early 1960s, he also put out tracks on EMI&#x27;s Columbia label, including a cover of Arthur Alexander&#x27;s &quot;Where Have You Been All My Life?&quot; A backing band called the Shouts joined him.
In 1966 and 1967, in the United States, he recorded for Challenge Records, backed by ex-members of the Champs and Glen Campbell. Challenge released three singles in the US, and the UK London label released two singles and collected recordings on to an LP, &quot;Gene Vincent&quot;, on the UK London label in 1967. Although well received, none sold well. In 1968 in a hotel in Germany, Vincent tried to shoot Paul Raven, later to find fame as Gary Glitter. He fired several shots but missed and a frightened Raven left the country the next day.
In 1969, he recorded the album &quot;I&#x27;m Back and I&#x27;m Proud&quot; for long-time fan John Peel&#x27;s Dandelion Records, produced by Kim Fowley with arrangements by Skip Battin (of the Byrds), Mars Bonfire on rhythm guitar, Johnny Meeks (of Blue Caps and Merle Haggard&#x27;s The Strangers) on lead guitar, Jim Gordon on drums, and backing vocals by Linda Ronstadt and Jackie Frisco. While recording the track &quot;Sexy Ways&quot; for the album Vincent threatened to get a gun from his car and shoot Paul A. Rothchild and John Densmore if they did not leave the studio; the pair then left the studio quickly. He recorded two other albums for Kama Sutra Records, reissued on one CD by Rev-Ola in March 2008. On his 1969 tour of the UK he was backed by the Wild Angels, a British band that had performed at the Royal Albert Hall with Bill Haley &amp; His Comets and Duane Eddy. Because of pressure from his ex-wife Margaret Russell, the Inland Revenue and promoter Don Arden, Vincent returned to the US.

His final US recordings were four tracks for Rockin&#x27; Ronny Weiser&#x27;s Rolling Rock label, a few weeks before his death. These were released on a compilation album of tribute songs, including &quot;Say Mama&quot;, by his daughter, Melody Jean Vincent, accompanied by Johnny Meeks on guitar. On September 19, 1971, he began his last series of gigs in Britain. He was backed by Richard Cole and Kansas Hook (Dave Bailey, Bob Moore, and bass player Charlie Harrison from Poco and Roger McGuinn&#x27;s Thunderbyrd). They recorded four tracks (&quot;Say Mama&quot;, &quot;Be-Bop-A-Lula&quot;, &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot;, &quot;Distant Drums&quot;) at the BBC studios in Maida Vale, London, for Johnnie Walker&#x27;s Radio 1 show. The fifth record (&quot;Whole Lotta Shakin&#x27; Goin&#x27; On&quot;) remained unfinished. He managed one show at the Garrick Night Club in Leigh, Lancashire, and two shows at the Wookey Hollow Club in Liverpool on October 3 and 4. Vincent then returned to the US and died a few days later. In September 1974, the BBC launched pop label BEEB with a maxi single by Vincent (&quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot;, BEEB 001). The single comprised three of these tracks. The four tracks are now on Vincent&#x27;s album &quot;White Lightning&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
Vincent died at the age of 36 on October 12, 1971, from a combination of a ruptured ulcer, internal hemorrhage and heart failure, while visiting his father in Saugus, California. He is interred at Eternal Valley Memorial Park, in Newhall, California.

Vincent is mentioned in one of Ian Dury&#x27;s earliest songs, &quot;Upminster Kid&quot; (on the 1975 Kilburn and the High Roads album &quot;Handsome&quot;), with the words &quot;Well Gene Vincent Craddock remembered the love of an Upminster rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll teen&quot;. Vincent had died just four years earlier. He later recorded the song &quot;Sweet Gene Vincent&quot;.

Vincent was the first inductee into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame upon its formation in 1997. The following year he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Vincent has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1749 North Vine Street. In 2012, his band, the Blue Caps, were retroactively inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by a special committee, alongside Vincent. On Tuesday, September 23, 2003, Vincent was honored with a Norfolk&#x27;s Legends of Music Walk of Fame bronze star embedded in the Granby Street sidewalk.

Writing for AllMusic, Ritchie Unterberger called Vincent &quot;an American rockabilly legend who defined the greasy-haired, leather-jacketed, hot rods &#x27;n&#x27; babes spark of rock and roll.&quot; &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau was less impressed by the musician&#x27;s career, saying &quot;Vincent was never a titan – his few moments of rockabilly greatness were hyped-up distillations of slavering lust from a sensitive little guy who was just as comfortable with &#x27;Over the Rainbow&#x27; in his normal frame of mind.&quot; However, he included Vincent&#x27;s compilation album &quot;The Bop That Just Won&#x27;t Stop&quot; (1974) in his &quot;basic record library&quot;, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981).

<text>The Blue Caps were a pioneering American rock and roll band of the 1950s, the backing band for early rockabilly icon Gene Vincent. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, as part of a class of overlooked backing bands selected by a special committee.

Robert Burke Warren, writing for the Hall of Fame, called them &quot;One of the first self-contained rock &amp; roll bands&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; has called them &quot;The first rock &amp; roll band in the world&quot;.

Members inducted into the Hall of Fame were guitarists Cliff Gallup, Tommy &quot;Bubba&quot; Facenda, Paul Peek, Willie Williams, and Johnny Meeks; bassists Bobby Jones and Jack Neal; and drummer Dickie Harrell, who died in 2023. Drummers Juvy Gomez and Clyde Pennington, bassist Bill Mack, piano player Max Lipscomb, and guitarists Grady Owen and Jerry Merritt were also members at various times.
 

The Blue Caps appeared, backing Gene Vincent, in the movies &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; (1956) and &quot;Hot Rod Gang&quot; (1958).

The Blue Caps wore flat light blue caps on stage.

The Blue Caps disbanded before the end of the 1950s, but reformed with original members Meeks, Peek, Harrell, Jones, and Facenda for a 1982 tour of England and a new record.

<doc id="165732" wikidata="Q23623" url="?curid=165732" title="Queer as Folk (British TV series)">
<text>Queer as Folk is a 1999 British television series that chronicles the lives of three gay men living in Manchester&#x27;s gay village around Canal Street. Initially running for eight episodes, a two-part follow up was shown in 2000. It was written by Russell T Davies and produced by Red Production Company for Channel 4.

== Background ==
The title of the programme comes from a traditional Northern English saying, &quot;there&#x27;s nowt so queer as folk&quot;, meaning &quot;there&#x27;s nothing as strange as people&quot;, and is a word play on the modern-day English definition of &quot;queer&quot; as homosexual. The script had originally started life with the title &quot;Queer as Fuck&quot; but &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; was considered more suitable.

== Characters and plot ==
The main characters are Stuart Allen Jones (Aidan Gillen), who is highly sexually active, and successfully so. His long-time friend Vince Tyler (Craig Kelly), who has a crush on Stuart, has less luck with men. 15-year-old Nathan Maloney (Charlie Hunnam) is new to the gay scene but is not lacking in self-confidence.

The producers say that &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;, although superficially a realistic depiction of gay urban life in the 1990s, is meant as a fantasy, and that Stuart, Vince, and Nathan are not so much characters as gay male archetypes.

Stuart, an advertising executive, possesses intrinsic power, able to bend anything to his will. Stuart&#x27;s principal characteristic is that he does whatever he wants, whenever he wants, however he wants. He blows up a car belonging to his friend Alexander&#x27;s antagonistic mother (in the second series). He invites Vince&#x27;s female colleague, who has a crush on closeted Vince, to Vince&#x27;s birthday party and then introduces Vince&#x27;s boyfriend. When offered a test drive of a Jeep by a car salesman who makes some homophobic comments, Stuart drives the car straight through the large window of the car dealership.

== Reception ==
At the time, the response was mixed from gay commentators in relation to the portrayal of the characters. The show was criticised by the gay press for not addressing the issue of the AIDS epidemic but the writer said he wanted to show the love and joy of gay life as this had not been shown on TV before. In the wider press and media, a commentator in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; called for censorship and made homophobic comments. Twenty years after the show first aired, however, &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; was generally praised.

The first four episodes were sponsored by Beck&#x27;s Brewery but the company withdrew their sponsorship halfway through the series. Following a backlash from the gay community, Beck&#x27;s offered to sponsor the second series, a request which was refused by the producers.

In 2010, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; at number 13 in their list of &quot;The Top 50 TV Dramas of All Time&quot;.

== Awards ==
Gillen was nominated for Best Actor at the 2000 British Academy Television Awards for his role, whilst the series was nominated for Best Drama Serial at the 1999 Royal Television Society Awards. Murray Gold won the Best Music - Original Score at the 1999 RTS Craft &amp; Design Awards while Pam Tait was nominated for Best Costume Design - Drama.

== Music ==
The theme song for the series was created by Murray Gold. A soundtrack album was released by Almighty Records for the original series and features tracks by OT Quartet, Ultra Naté, and Blondie. Selling 125,000 copies, it remained popular long after the broadcast of the first series and ended up the 50th biggest selling compilation album of 1999. An album for the second series was released by Channel 4 Music and sold 19,000 copies in its first week to debut at #5 on the UK Compilation Chart.

== Spin-offs ==
A spin-off series, &quot;Misfits&quot; (no relation to the later E4 series of the same name), was initially commissioned by Channel 4. The series would have followed the characters of Hazel, Alexander, Donna (who was absent from the 2nd series due to scheduling commitments) and Bernard from the original series, while introducing new characters. Although Davies developed draft scripts for four episodes and storylines for a further twenty-two, the series was cancelled before it went into pre-production.

As a result of Channel 4&#x27;s decision, Davies pulled out of a deal that would have seen a series of &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; short stories published on the broadcaster&#x27;s website, and vowed not to work with Channel 4 again, unless he has an idea that only works on that channel. However, fifteen years later in 2015, Davies returned to Channel 4 with drama series &quot;Cucumber&quot;, drama anthology &quot;Banana&quot; (on E4) and documentary series &quot;Tofu&quot; (on 4oD). Denise Black makes a cameo appearance as Hazel Tyler&#x27;s ghost in the sixth episode of &quot;Cucumber&quot;.

== American versions==
Driven by the success of the series, American cable channel Showtime and Canadian cable channel Showcase co-produced an American version, &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;. This is set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania although was filmed in Toronto, Ontario.

In late 2018, a second American adaptation was in development for Bravo. In April 2021, it received a series order from Peacock, the streaming service it shifted to within the NBCUniversal family. It reimagines this series instead of serving as a reboot of the first American series. &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; was released on June 9, 2022, on Peacock.

<text>Frank Yates FRS (12 May 1902 – 17 June 1994) was one of the pioneers of 20th-century statistics.

==Biography==
Yates was born in Manchester, England, the eldest of five children (and only son) of seed merchant and botanist Percy Yates and his wife Edith. He attended Wadham House, a private school, before gaining a scholarship to Clifton College in 1916. In 1920, he obtained a scholarship at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and four years later graduated with a First Class Honours degree.

He spent two years teaching mathematics to secondary school pupils at Malvern College before heading to Africa, where he was mathematical advisor on the Gold Coast Survey. He returned to England, due to ill health, and met and married a chemist, Margaret Forsythe Marsden, the daughter of a civil servant. This marriage was dissolved in 1933, and he later married Prascovie (Pauline) Tchitchkine, previously the partner of Alexis Tchitchkine. After her death in 1976, he married Ruth Hunt, his long-time secretary.

In 1931, Yates was appointed assistant statistician at Rothamsted Experimental Station by R.A. Fisher. In 1933, he became head of statistics when Fisher went to University College London. At Rothamsted he worked on the design of experiments, including contributions to the theory of analysis of variance, as well as developing Yates&#x27;s algorithm and the balanced incomplete block design.

During World War II he worked on what would later be called operations research.

After WWII, he worked on sample survey design and analysis. He became an enthusiast of electronic computers, in 1954 obtaining an Elliott 401 for Rothamsted and contributing to the initial development of statistical computing. During 1960–61, he was President of the British Computer Society, succeeding the founding president and computer pioneer, Maurice Wilkes. In 1960, he was awarded the Guy Medal in Gold of the Royal Statistical Society and, in 1966, he was awarded the Royal Medal of the Royal Society. He retired from Rothamsted to become a senior research fellow at Imperial College London. He died in 1994, aged 92, in Harpenden.

<text>The Chao Phraya River is the major river in Thailand, with its low alluvial plain forming the centre of the country. It flows through Bangkok and then into the Gulf of Thailand.

==Etymology==
On many old European maps, the river is named the &quot;Mae Nam&quot; (แม่น้ำ), the Thai word for &quot;river&quot; (literally, &quot;motherly water&quot;). Irish surveyor and cartographer James McCarthy, F.R.G.S., who served as Director-General of the Siamese Government Surveys prior to establishment of the Royal Thai Survey Department, wrote in his account, &quot;&quot;Mae Nam&quot; is a generic term, &quot;mae&quot; signifying &quot;mother&quot; and &quot;Nam&quot; &quot;water,&quot; and the epithet Chao P&#x27;ia signifies that it is the chief river in the kingdom of Siam.&quot;

Herbert Warington Smyth, who served as Director of the Department of Mines in Siam from 1891 to 1896, refers to it in his book first published in 1898 as &quot;the Mae Nam Chao Phraya&quot;.

In the English-language media in Thailand, the name Chao Phraya River is often translated as &quot;river of kings&quot;.

==History==

On the basins of Chao Phraya River rose the earliest civilizations in the south east Asia, most notably the ancient Mon kingdom and the civilization of Dvaravati from the 7th century to the 11th century. The river played a crucial role in the Lavo kingdom that existed on its left bank in the Upper Chao Phraya valley, and then maintained its role in the kingdoms that succeeded the Lavo kingdom. It formed the basis of the Ayodhaya kingdom, which was later incorporated into the Ayutthaya Kingdom in the 14th century, which itself was the precursor of modern Thailand (known formerly as Siam). The river became very significant after the establishment of Rattanakosin (Bangkok) in 1782 on its east bank, the location of Bangkok on the east bank of Chao Phraya River ensuring protection for Siam from the Burmese invasions coming from the west.

==Geography==
The Chao Phraya begins at the confluence of the Ping and Nan rivers at Nakhon Sawan (also called Pak Nam Pho) in Nakhon Sawan province. After this, it flows south for from the central plains to Bangkok and the Gulf of Thailand. In Chai Nat, the river then splits into the main course and the Tha Chin River, which then flows parallel to the main river and exits in the Gulf of Thailand about west of Bangkok in Samut Sakhon.

In the low alluvial plain which begins below the Chao Phraya Dam, there are many small canals (&quot;khlong&quot;) which split off from the main river. The &quot;khlongs&quot; are used for the irrigation of the region&#x27;s rice paddies.

The rough coordinates of the river are 13 N, 100 E. This area has a wet monsoon climate, with over of rainfall per year. Temperatures range from in Bangkok.

===River engineering===
The lower Chao Phraya underwent several human-made modifications during the Ayutthaya period. Several shortcut canals were constructed to bypass large loops in the river, shortening the trip from the capital city to the sea. The course of the river has since changed to follow many of these canals.

* In 1538, Thailand&#x27;s first river engineering of a long canal was dug at the order of King Chairachathirat. It was called &quot;Khlong Lat&quot;, and today forms a part of Khlong Bangkok Noi. It shortened the route by 13–14 km for ships from the Gulf of Siam to the then-capital city, Ayutthaya.
* In 1542, a two kilometer-long canal, &quot;Khlong Lat Bangkok&quot;, was completed. The Chao Phraya then diverted along the new canal, its old course becoming part of Khlong Bangkok Noi and Khlong Bangkok Yai. It is said to have shortened the river route by .
* In 1608, a seven kilometer-long &quot;Khlong Bang Phrao&quot; canal was completed and has shortened the Chao Phraya&#x27;s original route by .
* In 1636, the &quot;Khlong Lat Mueang Nonthaburi&quot; was completed.
* In 1722, the two kilometre long &quot;Khlong Lat Kret Noi&quot; shortened the Chao Phraya by . This route formed the island of Ko Kret.
* In 2024 the 22-km-long &quot;Chao Phraya II&quot; channel was under construction. It will join the river at points to the north and south of Ayutthaya, providing flood relief for the city.

==River settlements==
Provinces along the Chao Phraya include, from north to south, Nakhon Sawan Province, Uthai Thani Province, Chai Nat Province, Sing Buri Province, Ang Thong Province, Ayutthaya Province, Pathum Thani Province, Nonthaburi Province, Bangkok, and Samut Prakan Province. These cities are among the most historically significant and densely populated settlements of Thailand due to their access to the waterway.

==Transportation==
Major bridges cross the Chao Phraya in Bangkok: the Rama VI railroad bridge; Phra Pin-klao near the Grand Palace; Rama VIII, a single tower asymmetrical cable-stayed bridge; Rama IX, a semi-symmetric cable-stayed bridge; and Mega Bridge, on the Industrial Ring Road.

In Bangkok, the Chao Phraya is a major transportation artery for a network of river buses, cross-river ferries, and water taxis (&quot;longtails&quot;). More than 15 boat lines operate on the rivers and canals of the city, including commuter lines.

==Tributaries==
The principal tributaries of the Chao Phraya River are the Pa Sak River, the Sakae Krang River, the Nan River (along with its principal confluent the Yom River), the Ping River (with its principal confluent, the Wang River), and the Tha Chin River. Each of these tributaries (and the Chao Phraya itself) is augmented by minor tributaries referred to as &quot;khwae&quot;. All of the tributaries, including the lesser khwae, form an extensive tree-like pattern, with branches flowing through nearly every province in central and northern Thailand. None of the tributaries of the Chao Phraya extend beyond the nation&#x27;s borders. The Nan and the Yom River flow nearly parallel from Phitsanulok to Chumsaeng in the north of Nakhon Sawan Province. The Wang River enters the Ping River near Sam Ngao district in Tak Province.

==Length==

When measured from the most commonly accepted source, which is the confluence of the Ping and Nan River in Nakhon Sawan, the river measures . However, when measured from the longest source, which is the origin point of the Nan River in the Luang Prabang Range, the river measures .

==Chao Phraya watershed==
The expanse of the Chao Phraya River and its tributaries, i.e., the Chao Phraya river system, together with the land upon which falling rain drains into these bodies of water, form the Chao Phraya watershed.

The Chao Phraya watershed is the largest watershed in Thailand, covering approximately 35 percent of the nation&#x27;s land, and draining an area of .

The watershed is divided into the following basins:
*Pa Sak Basin
*Sakae Krang Basin
*Greater Nan Basin (composed of the Nan Basin and the Yom Basin, and usually divided as such in drainage analyses)
*Greater Ping Basin (composed of the Ping Basin and the Wang Basin, and usually divided as such in drainage analyses)
*Tha Chin Basin (the basin of the Chao Phraya&#x27;s most significant distributaries)
*Finally the Chao Phraya Basin itself is defined as the portion of the Chao Phraya watershed drained by the Chao Phraya River itself, and not by its major tributaries or distributaries. As such, the Chao Phraya Basin drains of land.

To the west, the central plain of Thailand is drained by the Mae Klong and the east by the Bang Pakong River. They are not part of the Chao Praya system.

The landscape of the river basins is a very wide, flat, well-watered plain continuously refreshed with soil and sediment brought down by the rivers. The lower central plain from the delta north to Ang Thong Province is a flat, low area with an average of two metres above sea level. Further north and into the plains of the Ping and the Nan the elevation is over 20 m. Then the mountains that are the natural boundary of the Chao Praya watershed form a divide, which has, to some degree, historically isolated Thailand from other Southeast Asian civilisations. In northern Thailand the divide roughly corresponds to a long section of the political border of the country today. Southern portions of the divide&#x27;s boundary correspond less to the nation&#x27;s political border, because isolation in this area was prevented by the ease of transportation along the lowlands surrounding the Gulf of Thailand, allowing a unified Thai civilisation to extend beyond the watershed without issue. The slightly higher northern plains have been farmed for centuries and saw a major change from the 13th century during the Sukhothai Kingdom in the 13th and 14th centuries and the Ayutthaya Kingdom that succeeded it when rice growing intensified with the introduction of floating rice, a much faster-growing strain of rice from Bengal. The southern swamps meanwhile changed radically from the 18th century when King Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke moved the capital of Siam to Bangkok, and a process of canalisation and cultivation began, especially as Thailand began to export rice from 1855.

==Delta==

The Tha Chin River is the major distributary of the Chao Phraya River. The expanse of the Chao Phraya and Tha Chin Rivers and their distributaries, starting at the point at which the distributaries diverge, together with the land amid the triangle formed by the outermost and innermost distributary, form the Chao Phraya delta. The many distributaries of the Chao Phraya delta are interconnected by canals that serve both for irrigation and for transportation.

==Ecology==

The lowland areas of the Chao Phraya watershed in central Thailand have been designated as the Chao Phraya freshwater swamp forests, a tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests ecoregion, an area about north to south and wide.

The original swamp forests have almost entirely been removed as the plain has been converted to rice paddies, other agriculture, and urban areas like Bangkok. Much of the wildlife that once inhabited these plains has disappeared, including a large number of fish in the river systems, birds such as vultures, the Oriental darter (&quot;Anhinga melanogaster&quot;), white-eyed river martin (&quot;Pseudochelidon sirintarae&quot;), the sarus crane (&quot;Grus antigone&quot;) and animals such as tigers, Asian elephants, Javan rhinoceroses, and the much-hunted Schomburgk&#x27;s deer. Today we can only guess at the original habitat and wildlife by comparing it with neighbouring countries. It is believed that the area would have consisted of freshwater swamps inland and salty mangroves on the coast and the river estuaries. The swamp would have been covered in &quot;Phragmites&quot; marsh grasses. Today there is a small area of this remaining in Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, a relic of the original landscape.

As so much has been cleared or altered the potential for creating large protected areas to preserve original habitat no longer exists. However much wildlife does remain in the rice fields and steps may be taken to preserve these as urban and industrial development on the plains is ongoing and the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand has very little control or planning over this. Particular threats come from the conversion of rice paddies to large-scale production of prawns by pumping in seawater, and the use of pesticides to eliminate the introduced snail,&quot;Pomacea canaliculata&quot;, which damages rice plants.

There are populations of threatened birds, including colonies of breeding water birds such as the world&#x27;s largest populations of the near-threatened Asian openbill (&quot;Anastomus oscitans&quot;), and other birds such as the wintering black kite (&quot;Milvus migrans&quot;). Endemic mammals that remain are the limestone rat (&quot;Niviventer hinpoon&quot;), Neill&#x27;s long-tailed giant rat (&quot;Leopoldamys neilli&quot;), and the near-endemic Thailand roundleaf bat (&quot;Hipposideros halophyllus&quot;).

The Chao Phraya basin is home to about half a dozen endemic dragonflies and damselflies. The conservation status of most of these in unclear (they are rated as data deficient by the IUCN), but &quot;Cryptophaea saukra&quot; is critically endangered and &quot;Caliphaea angka&quot; is endangered.

There are few areas of wetland protected as national parks, but these are mostly very small.

===Fish===
The Chao Phraya basin is home to around 280 species of fish, including about 30 endemics. By far the most diverse family is Cyprinidae with 108 species. The mainstream of the Chao Phraya River has about 190 native fish species. In general, the aquatic fauna of Chao Phraya and Mae Klong show clear similarities, and they are sometimes combined in a single ecoregion with 328 fish species. Despite their similarities, there are also differences between the aquatic fauna of Chao Phraya and Mae Klong; the latter (but not the former) is home to a few taxa otherwise only known in major Burmese rivers: the Irrawaddy, Salween, and Tenasserim. The aquatic fauna in Chao Phraya–Mae Klong also show clear similarities with that of the middle Mekong (the lower Mekong fauna more closely resembles that of the eastern Malay Peninsula). It is believed that the upper Mekong was connected to Chao Phraya (rather than present-day lower Mekong) until the Quaternary, which explains the similarities in their river faunas. This included the Nan River basin, a tributary of the Chao Phraya, which is home to a number of taxa (for example, &quot;Ambastaia nigrolineata&quot; and &quot;Sectoria&quot;) otherwise only known from Mekong. Of the fish species known from the Chao Phraya–Mae Klong, only about 50 are absent from the Mekong.

There has been extensive habitat destruction (pollution, dams, and drainage for irrigation) in the Chao Phraya basin and overfishing also presents a problem. Within mainland Southeast Asia, the only freshwater region with similar high levels of threat is the lower Mekong. It has been estimated that only around 30 native fish species still are able to reproduce in the mainstream of the Chao Phraya River.

The catfish &quot;Platytropius siamensis&quot; is endemic to Chao Phraya and Bang Pakong, but has not been recorded since the 1970s and is considered extinct. Recent records of the near-endemic cyprinid &quot;Balantiocheilos ambusticauda&quot; are also lacking and it is possibly extinct. Three of the largest freshwater fish in the world are native to the river, but these are all seriously threatened: the critically endangered giant barb (wild populations have been extirpated from Chao Phraya, but remain elsewhere), critically endangered giant pangasius, and endangered giant freshwater stingray. The critically endangered red-tailed black shark, a small colourful cyprinid that is endemic to Chao Phraya, is commonly seen in the aquarium trade where it is bred in large numbers, but the only remaining wild population is at a single location that covers less than . The endangered dwarf loach, another species bred in large numbers for the aquarium trade, has been extirpated from most of its range in Chao Phraya. The critically endangered Siamese tigerfish has been entirely exirpated from Chao Phraya and Mae Klong, but small populations remain in the Mekong basin.

Many other species that either are prominent in the aquarium trade or important food fish are native to the Chao Phraya basin, such as the climbing perch, blue panchax, Asian bumblebee catfish, giant snakehead, striped snakehead, walking catfish, banded loach, several &quot;Yasuhikotakia&quot; loaches, tinfoil barb, Siamese algae eater, silver barb, pearl danio, rainbow shark, Hampala barb, black sharkminnow, &quot;Leptobarbus rubripinna&quot;, long pectoral-fin minnow, bonylip barb, Jullien&#x27;s golden carp, blackline rasbora, scissortail rasbora, &quot;Tor tambroides&quot;, finescale tigerfish, marble goby, Chinese algae eater, giant featherback, clown featherback, giant gourami, several &quot;Trichopodus&quot; gouramis, iridescent shark, several &quot;Pangasius&quot;, &quot;Belodontichthys truncatus&quot;, several &quot;Phalacronotus&quot; sheatfish, several &quot;Wallago&quot; catfish, largescale archerfish, smallscale archerfish, and wrestling halfbeak.

===Pollution===
The Thai Pollution Control Department (PCD) reports that the water quality of major rivers flowing into the upper Gulf of Thailand has seriously deteriorated, and the lower Chao Phraya contains bacteria and nutrient pollution from phosphates, phosphorus, and nitrogen. Nutrient pollution causes algae to grow faster than ecosystems can handle, harming water quality, food resources for aquatic animals, and marine habitats. It also decreases the oxygen that fish need to survive. PCD rated water quality at the mouth of Chao Phraya at Bangkok&#x27;s Bang Khun Thian District as &quot;very poor&quot;, worse than in 2014, and their findings indicated large amounts of wastewater were discharged into the river from households, industry, and agriculture. In addition, 4,000 metric tons of plastic flows down the river into the Gulf of Thailand every year. To counter this, Thailand&#x27;s Department of Marine and Coastal Resources (DMCR) signed an agreement with The Ocean Cleanup organization to deploy an Interceptor Original, one of the organization&#x27;s solar-powered, automated systems, in the river. Since 19 February 2024, an interceptor of the latest third generation has been deployed for testing purposes.

<text>Gaston François Marie, Viscount Eyskens (1 April 1905 – 3 January 1988) was a Christian democratic politician and prime minister of Belgium. He was also an economist and member of the Belgian Christian Social Party (CVP-PSC).

He served three terms as the prime minister of Belgium, holding the position from 1949 to 1950, 1958 to 1961 and 1968 to 1973. During his periods in office, Eyskens was confronted with major ideological and linguistic conflicts within Belgium including the Royal Question in 1950, the School War in 1958, the independence of the Belgian Congo in 1960 and the split of the University of Leuven in 1970. He oversaw the first steps towards the federalization of Belgium (constitutional reform of 1970).

== Family==
Eyskens was born in Lier, the son of Antonius Franciscus Eyskens (1875–1948) and Maria Voeten (1872–1960). On 10 August 1931 he married Gilberte De Petter (1902–1981), daughter of the Leuvener politician , with whom he had two sons: Erik Eyskens (Leuven, 20 July 1935 – Antwerp, 31 August 2008) and Mark Eyskens. His son Mark also became Prime Minister, serving from 6 April 1981 to 17 December 1981.

==Career==

===Academic career===

Eyskens studied at the Catholic University of Leuven where he gained a master and doctorate degree. In 1927 he became Master of Science at Columbia University. In 1931 Eyskens became a professor at the University of Leuven. He later became dean of the economics faculty. He also served on the board of Lovanium University in the Congo.

Eyskens was made doctor honoris causa by Columbia University, the University of Cologne and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

===Political career===

During the early 1930s Eyskens was chief of staff of CVP ministers and . In 1939 Eyskens was elected to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives. He was steadily re-elected (in 1946, 1949, 1950, 1954, 1958 and 1961) and served until 1965.

In 1945 and between 1947 and 1949 he was Minister of Finance. On 11 August 1949 he became Prime Minister of Belgium in a coalition (Eyskens I) between Christian-democrats and liberals. His cabinet fell in June 1950 over the constitutional crisis caused by King Leopold III&#x27;s actions during the Second World War. In the short lived government of Jean Duvieusart (June–August 1950) Eyskens was Minister of Economic Affairs.

Between 26 June 1958 and 6 November 1958, Eyskens led a minority government which was the most recent government of Belgium (Eyskens II) not to be a coalition government. On 6 November, Eyskens formed a coalition government with the liberals (Eyskens III) which remained in power until 3 September 1960. On 3 September 1960 he formed his third government (Eyskens IV), again a coalition with the liberal party. This government fell on 25 April 1961 over the Unitary Law (which raised the fiscal pressure by 7 billion Belgian francs, cut spending in education and the military, and reformed unemployment benefits and government pensions) and had caused large-scale strikes. During these years he also had to deal with the School War and the independence of the Belgian Congo.
In the general election of 1965 Eyskens was elected to the Belgian Senate (re-elected in 1968 and 1971). In the government led by Pierre Harmel (1965–1966) he again served as Minister of Finance. Student unrest and questions of discrimination against the ethnic Flemish population brought down the Belgian government in February 1968. On 17 June 1968, Gaston Eyskens formed his fifth government (Eyskens V); this time a centre-left coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Socialists. On 20 January 1973, he formed his sixth and last government (Eyskens VI), again a coalition with the Socialists.

His last two governments were plagued by linguistic troubles regarding the split of the old bilingual Catholic University of Leuven into a Dutch-language university (the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven), which stayed in Leuven and a French-language university which moved to Louvain-la-Neuve and became the Université catholique de Louvain and the start of the process of changing Belgium from a unitary state into a federation with the creation of the Communities. Upon the fall of his last government Gaston Eyskens retired from politics. He died in Leuven.

<text>The Navajo Nation (), also known as Navajoland, is an Indian reservation of Navajo people in the United States. It occupies portions of northeastern Arizona, northwestern New Mexico, and southeastern Utah. The seat of government is located in Window Rock, Arizona.

At roughly , the Navajo Nation is the largest Indian reservation in the United States, exceeding the size of ten U.S. states. It is one of the few reservations whose lands overlap the nation&#x27;s traditional homelands.

In 2010, the reservation was home to 173,667 out of 332,129 Navajo tribal members; the remaining 158,462 tribal members lived outside the reservation, in urban areas (26%), border towns (10%), and elsewhere in the U.S. (17%). In 2020, the number of tribal members increased to 399,494, surpassing the Cherokee Nation as the largest tribal group by enrollment.

The U.S. gained ownership of what is today Navajoland in 1848 following the Mexican–American War. The reservation was first established in 1868 within New Mexico Territory, initially spanning roughly ; it subsequently straddled what became the Arizona–New Mexico border in 1912, when the states were admitted to the union. Unlike many reservations in the U.S., it has since expanded several times since its formation, reaching its current boundaries in 1934.

==Terminology==
In English, the official name for the area was Navajo Indian Reservation, as outlined in Article II of the 1868 Treaty of Bosque Redondo. On April 15, 1969, the tribe changed its official name to the &quot;Navajo Nation&quot;, which is displayed on its seal. In 1994, the Tribal Council rejected a proposal to change the official designation from &quot;Navajo&quot; to &quot;Diné&quot;, a traditional name for the people. Some people said that &quot;Diné&quot; represented the people in their time of suffering before the Long Walk, and that &quot;Navajo&quot; is the appropriate designation for the future. In the Navajo language, &quot;Diné&quot; means &quot;the People&quot;, a term used in many languages as an endonym. Among the Navajo populace, both terms are employed. In 2017, the Navajo Nation Council rejected legislation to change the name to &quot;Diné Nation&quot;, citing potential &quot;confusion and frustration among Navajo citizens and non-Navajos&quot;.

In Navajo, the geographic entity with its legally defined borders is known as &#x27;. This contrasts with &#x27; and &#x27; for the general idea of &quot;Navajoland&quot;. Neither of these terms should be confused with &#x27;, the term used for the traditional homeland of the Navajo. This is located in the area among the four sacred Navajo mountains of &#x27; (San Francisco Peaks), &#x27; (Hesperus Mountain), &#x27; (Blanca Peak), and &#x27; (Mount Taylor).

==History==

The Navajo people&#x27;s tradition of governance is rooted in their clans and oral history. The clan system of the Diné is integral to their society. The system has rules of behavior that extend to the manner of refined culture that the Navajo people call &quot;walking in beauty&quot;. The philosophy and clan system were established long before the Spanish colonial occupation of Dinétah, through to July 25, 1868, when Congress ratified the Navajo Treaty with President Andrew Johnson, signed by Barboncito, Armijo, and other chiefs and headmen present at Bosque Redondo, New Mexico.

The Navajo people have continued to transform their conceptual understandings of government since signing the Treaty of 1868. Social, cultural, and political academics continue to debate the nature of modern Navajo governance and how it has evolved to include the systems and economies of the &quot;western world&quot;.

===Reservation and expansion===

In the mid-19th century, primarily in the 1860s, most of the Navajo were forced to abandon their homes due to a series of military campaigns by the U.S. Army conducted with a scorched-earth policy and sanctioned by the U.S. government. The Army burned their homes and agricultural fields, and stole or killed livestock, to weaken and starve the Navajo into submission. In 1864, the main body of Navajo, numbering 8,000 adults and children, were marched on the Long Walk to imprisonment in Bosque Redondo. The Treaty of 1868 established the &quot;Navajo Indian Reservation&quot; and the Navajo people left Bosque Redondo for this territory.

The borders were defined as the 37th parallel in the north; the southern border as a line running through Fort Defiance; the eastern border as a line running through Fort Lyon; and in the west as longitude 109°30′.

As drafted in 1868, the boundaries were defined as:
Though the treaty had provided for one hundred miles by one hundred miles in the New Mexico Territory, the size of the territory was —slightly more than half. This initial piece of land is represented in the design of the Navajo Nation&#x27;s flag by a dark-brown rectangle.

As no physical boundaries or signposts were set in place, many Navajo ignored these formal boundaries and returned to where they had been living prior to the U.S. occupation. A significant number of Navajo had never lived in the Hwéeldi (near Fort Sumner). They remained or moved near the Little Colorado and Colorado rivers, on &quot;Naatsisʼáán&quot; (Navajo Mountain), and some lived with Apache bands.

The first expansion of the territory occurred on October 28, 1878, when President Rutherford Hayes signed an executive order pushing the reservation boundary to the west. Further additions followed throughout the late 19th and early 20th century (see map). Most of these additions were achieved through executive orders, some of which were confirmed by acts of Congress. For example, President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s executive order to add the region around Aneth, Utah in 1905 was confirmed by Congress in 1933.

The eastern border was shaped primarily as a result of allotments of land to individual Navajo households under the Dawes Act of 1887. This experiment was designed to assimilate Native Americans into mainstream American culture. The federal government proposed to divide communal lands into plots assignable to heads of household – tribal members – for their subsistence farming, in the pattern of small family farms common among Americans. This was intended to extinguish tribal land claims for such territory. The land allocated to these Navajo heads of household was initially not considered part of the reservation. Further, the federal government determined that land &quot;left over&quot; after all members had received allotments was to be considered &quot;surplus&quot; and available for sale to non-Native Americans. The allotment program continued until 1934. Today, this patchwork of reservation and non-reservation land is called the &quot;checkerboard area&quot;. It resulted in the loss of much Navajo land.
In the southeastern area of the reservation, the Navajo Nation has purchased some ranches, which it refers to as its &quot;Nahata Dził&quot;, or New Lands. These lands are leased to Navajo individuals, livestock companies, and grazing associations.

In 1996, Elouise Cobell (Blackfeet) filed a class action lawsuit against the federal government on behalf of an estimated 250,000–500,000 plaintiffs, Native Americans whose trust accounts did not reflect an accurate accounting of money owed them under leases or fees on trust lands. The settlement of &quot;Cobell v. Salazar&quot; in 2009 included a provision for a nearly $2 billion fund for the government to buy fractionated interests and restore land to tribal reservations. Individuals could sell their fractionated land interests on a voluntary basis, at market rates, through this program if their tribe participated.

Through March 2017, under the Tribal Nations Buy-Back Program, individual Navajo members received $104 million for purchase of their interests in land; 155,503 acres were returned to the Navajo Nation for its territory by the Department of Interior under this program.

===Clan governance===

In the traditional Navajo culture, local leadership was organized around clans, which are matrilineal kinship groups. Children are considered born into the mother&#x27;s family and gain their social status from her and her clan. Her eldest brother traditionally has a strong influence on rearing the children.

The clan leadership have served as a &quot;de facto&quot; government on the local level of the Navajo Nation.

====Rejection of Indian Reorganization Act====
In 1933, during the Great Depression, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) attempted to mitigate environmental damage due to over-grazing on reservations. Significant pushback was given by the Navajo, who did not feel that they had been sufficiently consulted before the measures were implemented. BIA Superintendent John Collier&#x27;s attempt to reduce livestock herd size affected responses to his other efforts to improve conditions for Native Americans. The herds had been central to Navajo culture, and were a source of prestige.

Also during this period, under the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) of 1934, the federal government was encouraging tribes to revive their governments according to constitutional models shaped after that of the United States. Because of the outrage and discontent about the herd issues, the Navajo voters did not trust the language of the proposed initial constitution outlined in the legislation. This contributed to their rejection of the first version of a proposed tribal constitution.

In the various attempts since, members found the process to be too cumbersome and a potential threat to tribal self-determination. The constitution was supposed to be reviewed and approved by BIA. The earliest efforts were rejected primarily because segments of the tribe did not find enough freedom in the proposed forms of government. In 1935 they feared that the proposed government would hinder development and recovery of their livestock industries; in 1953 they worried about restrictions on development of mineral resources.

They continued a government based on traditional models, with headmen chosen by clan groups.

==Language==

On December 30, 2024, Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren, made the Navajo language the official language of the Navajo Nation by signing legislation. He said “One of my priorities coming in as President has always been to make sure that we make Navajo cool again.” This is in order to promote the intergenerational preservation of the Navajo language within the Navajo Nation and intending to work in conjunction with the Diné Language Teachers Association to foster the utilization of the Navajo language.

==Navajo Nation and federal government jurisdictions==
The Navajo Nation must submit all proposed laws to the United States Secretary of the Interior for Secretarial Review, through the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).

Most conflicts and controversies between the federal government of the United States and the Nation are settled by negotiations outlined in political agreements. The Navajo Nation Code consists of codified rules and laws of the Navajo Nation. The Navajo Nation Code has 26 titles, covering subjects from the Navajo Nation Government to Commerce and Trade to Water. The 2010 version is available on the Navajo Nation Office of Legislative Services, as well as a section for amendments beginning from January 2014 to December 2022.

There is a map that outlines the boundaries of the Navajo Nation, available on the Navajo Land Department&#x27;s Website. Also, see Dine Land Use&#x27;s website for the history of the Navajo Nation&#x27;s land base. Lands within the boundaries of the Navajo Nation are composed of Public, Tribal Trust, Tribal Fee, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Private, State, and BIA Indian Allotment Lands. Within the Arizona and Utah portions of the Navajo Nation, there are a few private and BIA Indian Allotments in comparison to New Mexico&#x27;s portion, which consists of a checkerboard pattern of all the aforementioned lands. The Eastern Agency, as it is referred to, consists of primarily Tribal Fee, BIA Indian Allotments, and BLM Lands. Although there are more Tribal Fee Lands in New Mexico, the Navajo Nation government intends to convert most or all Tribal Fee Lands to Tribal Trust, which has some benefits according to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

==Government==
The Title II Amendment of 1989 established the Navajo Nation government as a three-part system (changes to the judicial branch had already begun in 1958). Two branches are independent of the council (where all government decision making was centralized before the change).

The president and vice-president are elected every four years. The Executive nominates judges of the District Courts, and the Supreme Court. The nation consists of several divisions, departments, offices, and programs as established by law.

===Constitution===
In 2006, a committee for a &quot;Navajo Constitution&quot; began advocating for a Navajo constitutional convention. The committee&#x27;s goal was to have representation from every chapter on the Navajo Nation represented at a constitutional convention. The committee proposed the convention be held in the traditional &quot;naachid&quot;/modern chapter house format, where every member of the nation wishing to participate may do so through their home chapters. The committee was formed by former Navajo leaders Kelsey Begaye, Peterson Zah, Peter MacDonald, Ivan Gamble (a writer/social activist), and other local political activists.

===Judiciary branch===
Prior to Long Walk of the Navajo, judicial powers were exercised by peace chiefs () in a mediation-style process. While the people were held at Bosque Redondo, the U.S. Army handled severe crimes. Lesser crimes and disputes remained in the purview of the villages&#x27; chiefs. After the Navajo return from Bosque Redondo in 1868, listed criminal offenses were handled by the US Indian Agent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs with support of the U.S. Army, while lesser disputes remained under Navajo control.

In 1892, BIA Agent David L. Shipley established the Navajo Court of Indian Offenses and appointed judges. Previously, judicial authority was exercised by the Indian Agent.

In 1950, the Navajo Tribal Council decided that judges should be elected. By the time of the judicial reorganization of 1958, the council had determined that, due to problems with delayed decisions and partisan politics, appointment was a better method of selecting judges.

The president makes appointments, subject to confirmation by the Navajo Nation Council; however, the president is limited to the list of names vetted by the Judiciary Committee of the council.

The current judicial system for the Navajo Nation was created by the Navajo Tribal Council on 16 October 1958. It established a separate branch of government, the &quot;Judicial Branch of the Navajo Nation Government&quot;, which became effective 1 April 1959. The Navajo Court of Indian Offenses was eliminated; the sitting judges became judges in the new system. The resolution established &quot;Trial Courts of the Navajo Tribe&quot; and the &quot;Navajo Tribal Court of Appeals&quot;, which was the highest tribal court and its only appellate court.

In 1978, the Navajo Tribal Council established a &quot;Supreme Judicial Council&quot;, a political body rather than a court. On a discretionary basis, it could hear appeals from the Navajo Tribal Court of Appeals. Subsequently, the Supreme Judicial Council was criticized for bringing politics directly into the judicial system and undermining &quot;impartiality, fairness and equal protection&quot;.

In December 1985, the Navajo Tribal Council passed the Judicial Reform Act of 1985, which eliminated the Supreme Judicial Council. It redefined the &quot;Navajo Tribal Court of Appeals&quot; as the &quot;Navajo Nation Supreme Court&quot;, and redefined &quot;Trial Courts of the Navajo Tribe&quot; as &quot;District Courts of the Navajo Nation&quot;. Navajo courts are governed by Title 7, &quot;Courts and Procedures&quot;, of the Navajo Tribal Code.

From 1988 to 2006, there were seven judicial districts and two satellite courts. , there are ten judicial districts, centered respectively in Alamo (Alamo/Tó&#x27;hajiilee), Aneth, Chinle, Crownpoint, Dilkon, Kayenta, Ramah, Shiprock, Tuba City and Window Rock. All of the districts also have family courts, which have jurisdiction over domestic relations, civil relief in domestic violence, child custody and protection, name changes, quiet title, and probate. , there were 17 trial judges presiding in the Navajo district and family courts.

===Executive branch===
The Navajo Nation Presidency, in its current form, was created on December 15, 1989, after directives from the federal government guided the Tribal Council to establish the current judicial, legislative, and executive model. This was a departure from the system of &quot;Council and Chairmanship&quot; from the previous government body.

Conceptual additions were made to the language of Navajo Nation Code Title II, and the acts expanded the new government on April 1, 1990. Qualifications for the position of president include fluency in the Navajo language (this has seldom been enforced and in 2015 the council changed the law to repeal this requirement). Term limits allow only two consecutive terms.

===Legislative branch===


The Navajo Nation Council, formerly the Navajo Tribal Council, is the legislative branch of the Navajo Nation. , the Navajo Nation Council consists of 24 delegates, representing the 110 chapters, elected every four years by registered Navajo voters. Prior to the November 2010 election, the Navajo Nation Council consisted of 88 representatives. The Navajo voted for the change in an effort to have a more efficient government and to curb tribal government corruption associated with council members who established secure seats.

====Chapters====
In 1927, agents of the U.S. federal government initiated a new form of local government entities called Chapters, modeled after jurisdictional governments in the US such as counties or townships. Each chapter elected officers and followed parliamentary procedures.

By 1933, more than 100 chapters operated across the Navajo Nation. The chapters served as liaisons between the Navajo and the federal governments, respectively. They also acted as voting precincts for the election of tribal council delegates. They served as forums for local tribal leaders but the chapters had no authority within the structure of the Navajo Nation government.

In 1998, the Navajo Tribal Council passed the &quot;Local Governance Act&quot; (LGA), which expanded the political roles of the existing 110 chapters. It authorized them to make decisions on behalf of the chapter members and to take over certain roles previously delegated to the council and executive branches. This included entering into intergovernmental agreements with federal, state and tribal entities, subject to approval by the Intergovernmental Relations Committee of the council. As of 2006, 44 chapters were LGA certified.

===Administrative divisions===
====Agencies and chapters====
The Navajo Nation is divided into five agencies. The seat of government is located at the Navajo Governmental Campus in Window Rock/&quot;Tségháhoodzání&quot;. These agencies are composed of several chapters each, and reflect the five Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) agencies created in the early formation of the Navajo Nation.

The five agencies within the Navajo Nation are Chinle Agency in Chinle, Arizona; Eastern Navajo Agency in Crownpoint, New Mexico; Western Navajo Agency in Tuba City, Arizona; Fort Defiance Agency in Fort Defiance, Arizona; and Shiprock Agency in Shiprock, New Mexico. The BIA agencies provide various technical services under direction of the BIA&#x27;s Navajo Area Office at Gallup, New Mexico.

Agencies are divided into chapters as the smallest political unit, similar to municipalities or small U.S. counties. The Navajo capital city of Window Rock is located in the chapter of St. Michaels, Arizona.

The Navajo Nation also operates executive offices in Washington, DC to facilitate government-to-government relations and for lobbying services and congressional relations.

====Departments and divisions====
=====Law enforcement=====
Navajo law enforcement consists of approximately 180 tribal police officers as of 2023.

Certain classes of crimes, such as capital cases, are prosecuted and adjudicated in Federal courts. However, the Navajo Nation operates its own divisions of law enforcement via the Navajo Division of Public Safety, commonly referred to as the Navajo Nation Police (formerly Navajo Tribal Police). Law enforcement functions are also delegated to the Navajo Nation Department of Fish and Wildlife: Wildlife Law Enforcement and Animal Control Sections; Navajo Nation Forestry Law Enforcement Officers; and the Navajo Nation EPA Criminal Enforcement Section; and Navajo Nation Resource Enforcement (Navajo Rangers).

Other local, state and federal law enforcement agencies routinely work on the Navajo Nation, including the BIA Police, National Park Service U.S. Park Rangers, U.S. Forest Service Law Enforcement and Investigations, Bureau of Land Management Law Enforcement, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), US Marshals, Federal Bureau of Investigation as well as other Native American units such as the Ute Mountain Agency and the Hopi Agency plus Arizona Highway Patrol, Utah Highway Patrol, New Mexico Department of Public Safety (State Police and Highway Patrol), Apache County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, Navajo County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, McKinley County Sheriff&#x27;s Office.

=====Other agencies=====
* Transportation
* Health
* Education
* Navajo Nation Parks &amp; Recreation

====Regional Commissions====
Regional government functions are carried out by the &quot;District Grazing Committees&quot; and &quot;Off-Reservation Land Boards&quot;, &quot;Major Irrigation Projects Farm Boards&quot;, and &quot;Agency Councils&quot;.

===Politics===
====Notable Navajo politicians====

* Henry Chee Dodge, first chairman of Navajo Tribal Council (1922–1928, 1942–1946)
* Tom B. Becenti, tribal judge and chapter official from Eastern Navajo Agency. WWII veteran. He is known to have helped develop the Navajo Tribal Court System while preserving traditional Navajo Fundamental Law.
* Peter MacDonald, Navajo Tribal chairman convicted for cause (1971–1983, 1987–1989)
* Jacob (JC) Morgan, first chairman elected by the tribe, serving 1938–1942
* Lilakai Julian Neil, first woman elected to Navajo Tribal Council, serving 1946–1951
* John Pinto, New Mexico state senator (1977–2019), code talker and military veteran, teacher and National Education Association organizer
* Amos Frank Singer, early Council delegate from Kaibito and designer of Navajo Seal
* Joe Shirley Jr., oversaw the reduction in seats on the Navajo Council
* Annie Dodge Wauneka, Navajo Tribal councilwoman and philanthropist (1951–1978)
* Peterson Zah, chairman and first president of the Navajo Nation (1983–1987, 1991–1995)

==== 2015 presidential election ====

On August 25, 2014, the Navajo Nation held primary elections for the Office of President. Joe Shirley Jr. and Chris Deschene had the two highest vote counts. In the weeks following, two other primary candidates sued in tribal court, invoking a never-used 1990s law that required candidates to be fluent in the Navajo language. They asked for an assessment of the leading candidates&#x27; language skills.

On October 23, 2014, the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the tribe held the first hearing on the complaint filed against Deschene. The meeting was presided by chief hearing officer Richie Nez. The court body ruled in favor of Dale Tsosie and Hank Whitethorne, the former primary candidates, and issued a default ruling against Deschene, who had refused to participate in assessment.

Later that day, the Navajo Supreme Court, in a special session on the matter, enforced the ruling from the lower Court body and ordered that the Navajo government remove Deschene from the presidential ballot because of his lack of Navajo language skills.

The High Court ruled that the presidential election scheduled for November 4 (12 days later) would be postponed, and ordered that it be held by the end of January 2015. Chief Justice Herb Yazzie and Associate Justice Eleanor Shirley ruled for the 2–1 majority; Justice Irene Black wrote in her dissent that the technicality must be sent back to the lower court for correction there. The decision did not outline who would act as executive at the end of the current president&#x27;s term (January 2015).

In the early hours of October 24, 2014 the Navajo Council passed legislative Bill 0298-14 amending the Navajo Nation Code. The legislation repealed the language requirement of the qualifications sections for president. This enabled Chris Deschene&#x27;s participation in the election.

The following Monday, the Navajo Board of Election Supervisors (NBES) met but took no action to implement the court directives. Counsel for NBES motioned the High Court for further instruction. The next day, the Navajo Nation Election Board commissioner, Wallace Charley (joined later by Kimmeth Yazzie, Navajo Election Administration) announced that Deschene&#x27;s name would remain on the ballot. Though he had vowed to continue, Deschene resigned from the race on October 30.

On October 29, Navajo President Ben Shelly vetoed the bill repealing the language requirement. The Navajo general election was held. Joe Shirley Jr. had the majority of votes by the unofficial tally.

The Navajo Council scheduled a primary and general election for June and August 2015. On Monday, January 5, 2015, President Shelly vetoed the language fluency bill. On January 7, five assistant attorneys-general filed petition with the Navajo Nation Supreme Court for clarification on the question of the presidential vacancy issue. Through a controversial agreement and resolution, the Court and the Council appointed Ben Shelly to act as interim President.

In the special election, businessman Russell Begaye was elected as president and Jonathan Nez as vice-president. In May 2015, they were sworn in. Begaye supports encouraging native language use among the Navajo, who have the most members of nearly any tribe who speak their native language. Approximately half of the Nation&#x27;s 340,000 members speak Navajo. Begaye came to office supporting the Grand Canyon Escalade, a proposed project to increase tourism at the canyon, as well as initiatives to develop a rail port to export crops and coal from the reservation and to pursue clean coal technology.

====Infrastructure====
The Navajo Tribal Utility Authority provides utility services for houses. By 2019 it was conducting a campaign to electrify remaining houses without electricity. about 15,000 houses, with 60,000 residents, did not have electricity; at that time the authority electrified, on an annual basis, 400–450 houses. The Navajo Nation has 13 grocery stores, 12 health facilities, 170 hospital beds, 13 intensive care unit beds, 52 isolation rooms, and 28 ventilators. 

Coconino County installed a Wi-Fi hotspot between the Page Magistrate Court Buildings and Coconino County Health and Human Services Northern Region Office at 467 Vista Ave. in Page, Arizona. While remaining in a vehicle, this hotspot, named CountyWi-Fi, is freely accessible and does not require a network password. Northern Arizona University (NAU), with clearance from Navajo and Hopi officials, extended free Wi-Fi signals to parking lots on the Navajo Nation for any college and K-12 student. Coconino County offers assistance for rent and utilities based on income eligibility. Assistance may be granted for electric, gas, wood, water, propane, rental, or utility deposits when moving.

====International cooperation====
In December 2012, Ben Shelly led a delegation of Navajo overseas to Israel, where they toured the country as representatives for the Navajo people. In April 2013, Shelly&#x27;s aide, Deswood Tome, led a delegation of Israeli agricultural specialists on a tour of resources on the Navajo Nation. The visit by Israelis was criticized by some indigenous people who believe that Palestinians in Israel have a status similar to their own.

In 2020, Ireland donated to the Navajo and Hopi Nations during Covid in a program called &quot;pay it forward&quot;. A GoFundMe page was created to help the Hopi and Navajo tribes fight Covid. It raised over $4 Million dollars, tens of thousands coming from Irish donors. At the time, the Navajo and Hopi tribes had the highest rates of Covid outside of New York and New Jersey. The communications director for the fundraiser, Cassandra Begay, attempted to spread awareness through Twitter. Chief of the Choctaw Nation, Gary Batton, responded to these donations, saying &quot;We have become kindred spirits with the Irish in the years since the Irish potato famine. We hope the Irish, Navajo and Hopi peoples develop lasting friendships, as we have.&quot;

==Geography==


The land area of the Navajo Nation is over , making it the largest Indian reservation in the United States; it is approximately 8,000 km2 larger than the state of West Virginia.

Adjacent to or near the Navajo Nation are the Southern Ute of Colorado, and the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe of Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico, both along the northern borders; the Jicarilla Apache Tribe to the east; the Zuni Pueblo and White Mountain Apache to the south; and the Hualapai Bands in the west. The Navajo Nation&#x27;s territory fully surrounds the Hopi Indian Reservation.

In the 1980s, a conflict over shared lands peaked when the Department of the Interior attempted to relocate Navajo residents living in what is still referred to as the Navajo–Hopi Joint Use Area. The litigious and social conflict between the two tribes and neighboring communities ended with &quot;The Bennett Freeze&quot; Agreement, completed in July 2009 by President Barack Obama. The agreement lessened the contentious land disagreement by providing a 75-year lease to Navajo who had land claims dating to before the US occupation of the territory.

Situated on the Navajo Nation are Canyon de Chelly National Monument, Monument Valley, Rainbow Bridge National Monument, the Shiprock monadnock, and the eastern portion of the Grand Canyon. Navajo Territory in New Mexico is popularly referred as the &quot;Checkerboard&quot; area because it is interrupted by Navajo and non-Native fee ownership of numerous plots of land. In this area, Navajo lands are intermingled with fee lands, owned by both Navajo and non-Navajo, and federal and state lands under various jurisdictions. Three large non-contiguous sections located in New Mexico are also under Navajo jurisdiction: these are the Ramah Navajo Indian Reservation, the Alamo Navajo Indian Reservation, and the Tohajiilee Indian Reservation near Albuquerque.

===Climate===
Much of the Navajo Nation is situated on the Colorado Plateau. The large variation in altitude () throughout the Navajo Nation produces considerable variations in climate, from an arid, desert climate, accounting for 55% of the area, through an intermediate steppe region, to the cold, sub-humid climate of the mountainous 8% of the area. Average daily temperatures range from , with a low of in mountainous regions and a high of in the desert. Average rainfall is at higher elevations, and in the desert.

===Daylight saving time===
The Navajo Nation observes daylight saving time (DST) on its Arizona land as well as on its Utah and New Mexico lands. But the rest of Arizona, including the Hopi Reservation, an enclave within the Arizona portion of the Nation, have opted out of DST.

==Demographics==

On the 2010 census 166,826 residents identified as Navajo or other Native American, 3,249 as White/European American, 401 Asian or Pacific Islanders, 208 African American, and the remainder identify as some other group or more than one ancestry. The 2010 census recorded 109,963 individuals who report speaking a language at home that is neither Asian nor Indo-European. DiscoverNavajo.com reports that 96% of the Navajo Nation is American Indian, and 66% of Navajo tribe members live on Navajo Nation.

The average family size was 4.1, and the average household was home to 3.5 persons. The average household income in 2010 was $27,389.

Nearly half of the enrolled members of the Navajo tribe live outside the nationʼs territory, and the total enrolled population is 300,048, as of July 2011.
As of 2016, 173,667 Diné lived on tribal lands.

==Education==
Historically, the Navajo Nation resisted compulsory western education, including boarding schools, as imposed by the government in the aftermath of the Long Walk. Navajo families and society have provided traditional and home education with considerable scope and depth since before the US annexation.

Continued education, and retention of Navajo students in school are significant priorities. Major problems faced by the Nations relates to helping students improve their grades and to prevent a very high drop-out rate among high school students. Over 150 public, private, and Bureau of Indian Affairs schools serve Nation students from kindergarten through high school. Most schools are funded from the Navajo Nation under the Johnson O&#x27;Malley program.

The Nation runs community Head Start programs, the only in the field of education fully operated by the Navajo Nation government. Post-secondary education and vocational training are available on and off the territory.

The Navajo Nation operates Tséhootsooí Diné Bi&#x27;ólta&#x27;, a Navajo-language immersion school for grades K–8 in Fort Defiance, Arizona. Located on the Arizona-New Mexico border in the southeastern quarter of the Navajo Nation, the school strives to revitalize Navajo among children of the Window Rock Unified School District. Tséhootsooí Diné Bi&#x27;ólta&#x27; has thirteen Navajo language teachers who instruct only in the Navajo language. Five English language teachers instruct in the English language. Kindergarten and first grade are taught completely in the Navajo language, while English is incorporated into the program during third grade, when it is used for about 10% of instruction.

===Primary and secondary education===
The Nation has access to six systems of primary and secondary academic institutions that serve Navajo students, including:
* Arizona public schools
* New Mexico public schools
* Utah public schools
* Bureau of Indian Education-operated public schools
* Association of Navajo-Controlled schools
* Navajo Preparatory School, Inc.
* Catholic Schools

===Diné College – Tsaile campus===


The Navajo Nation operates Diné College, a two-year tribal community college, with its main campus at Tsaile in Apache County, Arizona. The college also operates seven sub-campuses throughout the nation. The Navajo Nation Council founded the college in 1968 as the first tribal college in the United States. Since then, tribal colleges have been established on numerous reservations and now total 32.
Diné College has 1,830 students enrolled, of which 210 are students seeking transfer to four-year institutions in order to earn bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

====Center for Diné Studies====
The college includes the Center for Diné Studies. Its goal is to apply Navajo &quot;Sa&#x27;ah Naagháí Bik&#x27;eh Hózhóón&quot; principles to advance quality student learning through &quot;Nitsáhákees&quot; (thinking), &quot;Nahat&#x27;á&quot; (planning), &quot;Iiná&quot; (living), and &quot;Siihasin&quot; (assurance) in study of the Diné language, history, and culture. Students are prepared for further studies and employment in a multi-cultural and technological world.

===Navajo Technical University (NTU)===
Located in Crownpoint, New Mexico, Navajo Technical University is a tribal university offering various vocational, technical, and academic degrees and certificates. NTU was opened in 1979 as the Navajo Skill Center, intended to provide opportunity to unemployed people of the Navajo Nation. The center has since been renamed multiple times in response to growth and its changing programs.

In 1985 it was renamed Crownpoint Institute of Technology and in 2006 as Navajo Technical College. In 2013 it was named as a &quot;university&quot; in recognition of its program expansion, under resolution codified by the Navajo Nation Council.

=== Navajo Preparatory School Inc ===
Navajo Preparatory School is located in Farmington, New Mexico on a small patch of land owned by The Navajo Nation bought for the purpose of the School. Navajo Preparatory School is 1 of 1926 International Baccalaureate (IB) schools in the world. Navajo Preparatory School is the Only Navajo-sanctioned, college-preparatory school for Native Americans, Navajo Preparatory School recruits some of the best and brightest students of the Navajo Nation. The moto of Navajo Preparatory School is Yideską́ą́góó Naatʼáanii (Leaders now and into the future). The purpose of the program is to provide students with an academically challenging high school education, which meets worldwide standards and criteria and is sanctioned by International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO).

==Environmental and health concerns==
===Uranium mining===
Extensive uranium mining took place in areas of the Navajo Nation from the 1940s, and stringent worker and environmental safety laws were not passed and enforced until the early 1960s.

Studies have proven uranium mining created severe environmental consequences for miners and nearby residents. Several types of cancer occur at much higher rates than the national average in these locations. Especially high are the rates of reproductive-organ cancers in teenage Navajo girls, averaging seventeen times higher than the average of girls in the United States. In 1990, Congress passed the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act.

Residents of the Red Water Pond Road area have requested relocation to a new, off-grid village to be located on Standing Black Tree Mesa. Cleanup is underway on the Northeast Church Rock Mine Superfund site. They proposed this as an alternative to the EPA-proposed relocation of residents to Gallup.

==== Navajo neurohepatopathology ====
The Navajo are uniquely affected by a rare and life-threatening autosomal recessive multi-system disorder called Navajo Neurohepatopathology (NNH). This genetic condition is estimated to occur in one of every 1,600 live births. The most severe symptoms include neuropathy and liver dysfunction (hepatopathy), both of which may be moderate and progressive or severe and fatal, as it often is in cases that develop in infants (before six months of age) or children (1–5 years). Other symptoms include corneal anesthesia and scarring, injuries due to lack of sensation, cerebral leukoencephalopathy, failure to thrive, and recurrent metabolic acidosis, with intercurrent infections.

===Diabetes===
Diabetes mellitus is a major health problem among the Navajo, Hopi and Pima tribes, whose members are diagnosed at a rate about four times higher than the age-standardized U.S. estimate. Medical researchers believe increased consumption of carbohydrates, coupled with genetic factors, play significant roles in the emergence of this chronic disease among Native Americans.

===Severe combined immunodeficiency===
One in every 2,500 children in the Navajo population inherits severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). This genetic disorder results in births of children with virtually no immune system. In the general population, the genetic disorder is much rarer, affecting one in 100,000 children. The disorder is sometimes known as &quot;bubble boy disease&quot;. This condition is a significant cause of illness and death among Navajo children. Research reveals a similar genetic pattern among the related Apache.

In a December 2007 Associated Press article, Mortan Cowan, director of the Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplant Program at the University of California, San Francisco, noted that, although researchers have identified about a dozen genes that cause SCID, the Navajo/Apache population has the most severe form of the disorder. This is due to the mutations in the gene &quot;DCLRE1C&quot;, which leads to a defective copy of the protein Artemis. Without the gene, children&#x27;s bodies are unable to repair DNA or develop disease-fighting cells.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
The COVID-19 pandemic was first documented in the Navajo Nation on March 17, 2020. On March 20, a stay-at-home order was issued after 14 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed, with an 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew enforced. Beginning April 12, a 57-hour weekend curfew was declared. At that point, there were 698 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 24 deaths, among members of the Navajo Nation living in New Mexico, Arizona and Utah. On April 19, the Navajo Department of Health issued an emergency public health order mandating the use of masks outside the home, in addition to existing orders for sheltering in place and for nightly and weekend curfews.

By April 20, the Navajo Nation had the third-highest infection rate in the United States, after those of New York and New Jersey.
On May 18, it surpassed New York as most affected U.S. region per capita, with 4,071 positive COVID-19 tests and 142 fatalities recorded.

On April 25, the Nation announced that it was joining ten other tribes in a lawsuit against the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, over what the plaintiffs said was an unfair allocation of money under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). On May 5, $600 million of aid money was delivered to the Navajo Nation, a month after the legislation was signed into law.

As of February 2022, there had been 50,428 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Navajo Nation, and 1,619 deaths associated with the virus.

=== Water rights and protection ===
==Economy==
The Navajo economy and culture have long been based on the raising of sheep and goats. Navajo families process the wool and sell it for cash or spin it into yarn and weave blankets and rugs for sale. The Navajo are also noted for their skill in creating turquoise and silver jewelry. Navajo artists have other traditional arts, such as sand painting, sculpture, and pottery.

The Navajo Nation has created a mixture of industry and business that has provided the Navajo with alternative opportunities to traditional occupations. The Nation&#x27;s median cash household income is around $20,000 per year. However, using federal standards, unemployment levels fluctuate between 40 and 45%. About 40% of families live below the federal poverty rate.

Economic development within the Navajo Nation has fluctuated over its history but has largely remained limited. One obstacle to investment has been the incompatibility of its two land management systems. Tribal lands are held in common and leased to individuals for specific purposes, such as home construction or for livestock grazing. Financial institutions outside of tribal lands require assets, including land, to be used as collateral when potential borrowers seek capital. Since individuals do not own the land outright, financial institutions have little recourse if borrowers default on their loans. Additionally, the wide-ranging bureaucracy involving elements of the U.S. Department of Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the tribal government has created a complex network that is cumbersome and time-consuming for investors and businesses to navigate.

Self-employed Navajo workers and Navajo entrepreneurs are often involved in the grey economy. For instance, artisans staff roadside shops and cater to American and international tourists, travelers passing through Navajo Nation, and to the Navajo people themselves. Other Navajo workers find employment in the nearby cities and towns of Page, Arizona; Flagstaff, Arizona; Farmington, New Mexico; Gallup, New Mexico; Cortez, Colorado; and other towns along the I-40 corridor. Commute times vary for these workers. Because of the remoteness of some Navajo communities, they can last up to several hours. Economic push-pull factors have led a sizeable portion of the workforce to temporarily or permanently relocate to these border towns or to large metropolitan areas further away, such as Phoenix, Arizona; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Los Angeles, California; Chicago, Illinois; Denver, Colorado; and Salt Lake City, Utah. With nearly half of all Navajo tribal members living off the reservation, it is more difficult for the tribe to build social capital there and to draw from those people&#x27;s talents.

Navajo college students and graduates studying at universities in cities and towns outside the reservation may elect to stay there rather than relocate to the Navajo Nation because of the relative abundance of employment opportunities, connections with other classmates, and higher quality of life. This phenomenon contributes to human capital flight or &quot;the brain drain&quot;, where highly skilled or highly educated individuals are attracted or pushed to a location with different or more economic opportunities. They are not incorporated into the community and local economy of origin.

The tribe has grown peaches (&quot;Prunus persica&quot;) since the 1700s. In the late 1800s the Bureau of Indian Affairs began to discourage traditional methods of peach growing. Wytsalucy (2019) genotyped some of the trees and distinguished them from those grown elsewhere. Wytsalucy&#x27;s analysis illuminates the different course that Navajo breeding of peach has taken from peach breeding elsewhere.

===Natural resources===
Mining – especially of coal and uranium – provided significant income to both the Navajo Nation and individual Navajos in the second half of the 20th century. Many of these mines have closed. But in the early 21st century, mining still provides significant revenues to the tribe in terms of leases (51% of all tribal income in 2003). Navajos are among the 1,000 people employed in mining.

====Coal====
The volume of coal mined on the Navajo Nation land has declined in the early 21st century.

Peabody Energy&#x27;s Black Mesa coal mine, a controversial strip mine, was shut down in December 2005 because of its adverse environmental impacts. It lost an appeal in January 2010 to reopen.

The Black Mesa mine fed the 1.5 GW Mohave Power Station at Laughlin, Nevada, via a slurry pipeline that used water from the Black Mesa aquifer. The nearby Kayenta Mine used the Black Mesa &amp; Lake Powell Railroad to move coal to the former Navajo Generating Station (2.2 GW) at Page, Arizona. The Kayenta mine provided the majority of leased revenues for the tribe. The Kayenta mine also provided wages to those Navajo who were among its 400 employees.

The Chevron Corporation&#x27;s P&amp;M McKinley Mine was the first large-scale, surface coal mine in New Mexico when it opened in 1961. It closed in January 2010.

The Navajo Mine opened in 1963 near Fruitland, New Mexico, and employs about 350 people. It supplies sub-bituminous coal to the 2 GW Four Corners Power Plant via the isolated 13-mile Navajo Mine Railroad. Parts of the Navajo Nation, through the Navajo Transitional Energy Company, acquired the mine and three mines in Montana and Wyoming.

====Uranium====
The uranium market, which was active during and after the Second World War, slowed near the end of that period. The Navajo Nation has suffered considerable environmental contamination and health effects as a result of poor regulation of uranium mining in that period. As of 2005, the Navajo Nation has prohibited uranium mining altogether within its borders.

====Oil and natural gas====
There are developed and potential oil and gas fields on the Navajo Nation. The oldest and largest group of fields is in the Paradox Basin in the Four Corners area. Most of these fields are located in the Aneth Extension in Utah, but there are a few wells in Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona. The first well was drilled in the Aneth Extension in 1956. In 2006 the Paradox Basin fields were injected with water and carbon dioxide to increase declining production. There are also wells in the Checkerboard area in New Mexico that are on leased land owned by individual Navajo.

The selling of leases and oil royalties have changed over the years. The Aneth Extension was created from Public Domain lands as part of a 1933 exchange with the federal government for lands flooded by Lake Powell. Congress appointed Utah as trustee on behalf of Navajos living in San Juan County, Utah for any potential revenues that came from natural resources in the area. Utah initially created a 3-person committee to make leases, receive royalties and improve the living conditions for Utah Navajo. As the revenues and resulting expenditures increased, Utah created the 12-member Navajo Commission to do the operational work. The Navajo Nation and Bureau of Indian Affairs are also involved.

Several Navajo organizations deal with oil and gas. The Utah Diné Corporation is a nonprofit organization established to take over from the Navajo Commission. The Navajo Nation Oil and Gas Company owns and operates oil and natural gas interests, primarily in New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah. Federally incorporated, it is wholly owned by the Navajo Nation.

====Renewables====
In early 2008, the Navajo Nation and Houston-based International Piping Products entered into an agreement to monitor wind resources, with the potential to build a 500-megawatt wind farm some 50 miles (80 km) north of Flagstaff, Arizona. Known as the Navajo Wind Project, it is proposed as the second commercial wind farm in Arizona after Iberdrola&#x27;s Dry Lake Wind Power Project between Holbrook and Overgaard-Heber. The project is to be built on Aubrey Cliffs in Coconino County, Arizona.

In December 2010, the President and Navajo Council approved a proposal by the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority (NTUA), an enterprise of the Navajo Nation, and Edison Mission Energy to develop an 85-megawatt wind project at Big Boquillas Ranch, which is owned by the Navajo Nation and is located 80 miles west of Flagstaff. The NTUA plans to develop this into a 200-megawatt capacity at peak. This has been planned as the first majority-owned native project; NTUS was to own 51%. An estimated 300–350 people will construct the facility; it will have 10 permanent jobs. In August 2011, the Salt River Project, an Arizona utility, was announced as the first utility customer. Permitting and negotiations involve tribal, federal, state and local stakeholders. The project is intended not only as a shift to renewable energy but to increase access for tribal members; an estimated 16,000 homes are without access to electricity.

The wind project has foundered because of a &quot;long feud between Cameron [Chapter] and Window Rock [central government] over which company to back&quot;. Both companies pulled out. Negotiations with Clipper Windpower looked promising, but that company was put up for sale after the recession.

===Parks and attractions===

Tourism is important to the Navajo Nation. Parks and attractions within traditional Navajo lands include:
* Shiprock Pinnacle (large volcanic remnants, elevation , located in New Mexico near Shiprock)
* Navajo Mountain (mountain along Utah and Arizona border, elevation )
* Chaco Canyon
* Bisti/De-Na-Zin Wilderness
* Canyon De Chelly National Monument
* Navajo National Monument
* Window Rock Tribal Park
* Navajo Nation Museum
* Navajo Nation Zoological and Botanical Park
* Navajo Bridge
* Kinlichee Ruins
* Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site
* Grand Falls
* Narbona Pass
* Hovenweep National Monument Outside of but bordering the Navajo Nation. 

==== Navajo Tribal Parks ====
The Navajo Nation has four Tribal Parks, which bring tourists and revenue to the Tribe.

* Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park (on the Utah and Arizona border, near the town of Kayenta, Arizona)
* Little Colorado River Gorge Navajo Tribal Park
* Lake Powell Navajo Tribal Park – includes Antelope Canyon and hiking trail to Rainbow Bridge National Monument
* Four Corners Monument Navajo Tribal Park

Navajo Nation Parks &amp; Recreation also operates Tseyi Heritage Cottonwood Campground at Canyon de Chelly, Camp Asaayi at Bowl Canyon, and the Navajo Veterans Memorial Park.

===Art and crafts===
An important small business group on the Navajo Nation is handmade arts and crafts industry. A survey conducted by the Arizona Hospitality Research &amp; Resource Center reported that the Navajo nation made $20,428,039 from the art and crafts trade in 2011.

Since the introduction of sheep into the New World, Navajos have traditionally made use of either the vertical loom or the back strap loom (belt loom) to weave yarns. The early weaving practice was such that unprocessed wool was chiefly used to make blankets and which still retained its lanolin and suint (sweat), and which could repel water, on the one hand, but which left an unpleasant odor to the finished woolen product, on the other. Today, modern techniques have replaced the old, and wool is preprocessed and treated with an alkali substance. By 1900, the weaving of traditional Navajo blankets had been replaced by rug-making.

===Diné Development Corp.===
The Diné Development Corporation was formed in 2004 to promote Navajo business and seek viable business development to make use of casino revenues.

==Media==
===&quot;Navajo Times&quot;===
The Navajo Nation is served by various print media operations. The &quot;Navajo Times&quot; used to be published as the &quot;Navajo Times Today&quot;. Created by the Navajo Nation Council in 1959, it has been privatized. It continues to be the newspaper of record for the Navajo Nation. The&quot; Navajo Times&quot; is the largest Native American-owned newspaper company in the United States.

===KTNN===
Established as a Navajo Nation Enterprise in 1985, KTNN is a commercial radio station that provides information and entertainment, and is located on AM 660.

===Other newspapers===
Other newsprint groups also serve the Navajo Nation. The media outlets include the &quot;Navajo/Hopi Observer&quot;, serving Navajo, Hopi and towns of Winslow and Flagstaff, and the &quot;Navajo Post&quot;, a web-based with print outlet that serves urban Navajos from its offices at Tempe. Non-Navajo papers such as the &quot;Gallup Independent&quot; also serve Navajo audiences.

<text>The Staple Singers were an American gospel, soul, and R&amp;B singing group. Roebuck &quot;Pops&quot; Staples (December 28, 1914 – December 19, 2000), the patriarch of the family, formed the group with his children Cleotha (April 11, 1934 – February 21, 2013), Pervis (November 18, 1935 – May 6, 2021), and Mavis (b. July 10, 1939). Yvonne (October 23, 1937 – April 10, 2018) replaced her brother when he was drafted into the U.S. Army, and again in 1970. They are best known for their 1970s hits &quot;Respect Yourself&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Take You There&quot;, &quot;If You&#x27;re Ready (Come Go with Me)&quot;, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot;. While the family name is Staples, the group used &quot;Staple&quot; commercially.

==History==
First child to Roebuck &quot;Pops&quot; Staples and his wife Oceola Staples, Cleotha was born in Drew, Mississippi, in 1934. Two years later, Roebuck moved his family from Mississippi to Chicago. Roebuck and Oceola&#x27;s children, son Pervis and daughters, Mavis and Yvonne, were born in Chicago. Roebuck worked in steel mills and meatpacking plants while his family of four children grew up. The family began appearing in Chicago-area churches in 1948. Their first public singing appearance was at the Mount Zion Church, Chicago, where Roebuck&#x27;s brother, the Rev. Chester Staples, was pastor.

They signed their first professional contract in 1952. During their early career, they recorded in an acoustic gospel-folk style with various labels: United Records, Vee-Jay Records (their &quot;Uncloudy Day&quot; and &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken?&quot; were best sellers), Checker Records, Riverside Records, and then Epic Records in 1965. &quot;Uncloudy Day&quot; was an early influence on Bob Dylan, who said of it in 2015, &quot;It was the most mysterious thing I&#x27;d ever heard ... I&#x27;d think about them even at my school desk ... Mavis looked to be about the same age as me in her picture (on the cover of &quot;Uncloudy Day&quot;) ... Her singing just knocked me out ... And Mavis was a great singer—deep and mysterious. And even at the young age, I felt that life itself was a mystery.&quot;

The move to Epic yielded a run of albums, including the live in-church &quot;Freedom Highway&quot; album produced by Billy Sherrill; the title track of which was a civil rights movement protest song penned by Pops Staples. It was on Epic that the Staple Singers developed a style more accessible to mainstream audiences, with &quot;Why (Am I Treated So Bad)&quot; and &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot; (Stephen Stills) in 1967. In 1968, the Staple Singers signed to Stax Records and released two albums with Steve Cropper—&quot;Soul Folk in Action&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;ll Get Over&quot;, Pervis returning for them. After Cropper left Stax, Al Bell produced their recordings, conducting the rhythm sessions at the famed Muscle Shoals Sound Studio and cutting the overdubs himself with engineer/musician Terry Manning at Memphis&#x27;s Ardent Studios, moving in a more funk and soul direction.

The Staple Singers&#x27; first Stax hit was &quot;Heavy Makes You Happy (Sha-Na-Boom-Boom)&quot; in early 1971. Their late 1971 recording of &quot;Respect Yourself&quot;, written by Luther Ingram and Mack Rice, peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart and number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Both hits sold over one million copies and were each awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America. The song&#x27;s theme of self-empowerment had universal appeal, released in the period immediately following the intense American civil rights movement of the 1960s. In 1972, &quot;I&#x27;ll Take You There&quot; topped both &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. In 1973, &quot;If You&#x27;re Ready (Come Go With Me)&quot; reached number 9 on the Hot 100 and number one on the R&amp;B chart.

After Stax&#x27;s 1975 bankruptcy, The Staple Singers signed to Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s label, Curtom Records, and released &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot;, produced by Mayfield; the song became their second number-one pop hit in the U.S., and the album was also successful. In 1976, they collaborated with The Band for their film &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;, performing on the song &quot;The Weight&quot; (which The Staple Singers had previously covered on their first Stax album). However, they were not able to regain their momentum, releasing only occasional minor hits. The 1984 album &quot;Turning Point&quot; featured a cover of Talking Heads&#x27; &quot;Slippery People&quot;, which reached the Top 5 on the Dance chart. In 1994, they again performed the song &quot;The Weight&quot; with country music artist Marty Stuart for MCA Nashville&#x27;s &quot;Rhythm, Country and Blues&quot; compilation, somewhat re-establishing an audience. The song &quot;Respect Yourself&quot; was used by Spike Lee in the soundtrack to his movie &quot;Crooklyn&quot;, made in 1994.

In 1999, The Staple Singers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, where they performed &quot;Respect Yourself&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Take You There&quot;.

Pops Staples died of complications from a concussion suffered in December 2000. Cleotha Staples died in Chicago on February 21, 2013, at the age of 78, after suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease for over a decade. Mavis Staples has continued to carry on the family tradition and continues to add her vocal talents to both the projects of other artists and her own solo ventures. In 2022, she released &quot;Carry Me Home&quot;, a collaboration with Levon Helm, recorded at Helm&#x27;s Midnight Ramble in 2011. She appeared at Glastonbury in 2015 and 2019, and her 2016 album &quot;Livin&#x27; on a High Note&quot; includes a simple acoustic version of a Martin Luther King sermon in the track &quot;MLK Song&quot;. Yvonne Staples died on April 10, 2018, at the age of 80. Pervis Staples died suddenly in his home in Dolton, Illinois, on May 6, 2021, at the age of 85, leaving Mavis as the band&#x27;s last surviving member.

==Documentary==
The 2015 documentary film &quot;Mavis!&quot; recounts the history of The Staple Singers and follows Mavis Staples&#x27;s solo career after Pops Staples&#x27;s death. Directed by Jessica Edwards, the film premiered at the 2015 South by Southwest Film Festival and was broadcast by HBO in February 2016.

==Awards==
The Staple Singers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999 and the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2018. They were also honored with a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail in Drew, Mississippi. In 2005, the group was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

<text>The Sabbateans (or Sabbatians) were a variety of Jewish followers, disciples, and believers in Sabbatai Zevi (1626–1676), an Ottoman Jewish rabbi and Kabbalist who was proclaimed to be the Jewish Messiah in 1666 by Nathan of Gaza.

Vast numbers of Jews in the Jewish diaspora accepted his claims, even after he outwardly became an apostate due to his forced conversion to Islam in the same year. Sabbatai Zevi&#x27;s followers, both during his proclaimed messiahship and after his forced conversion to Islam, are known as Sabbateans.

In the late 17th century, northern Italy experienced a surge of Sabbatean activity, driven by the missionary efforts of Abraham Miguel Cardoso. Around 1700, a radical faction within the Dönmeh movement, led by Baruchiah Russo, emerged, which sought to abolish many biblical prohibitions. During the same period, Sabbatean groups from Poland migrated to the Land of Israel. The Sabbatean movement continued to disseminate throughout central Europe and northern Italy during the 18th century, propelled by &quot;prophets&quot; and &quot;believers.&quot; Concurrently, anti-Sabbatean literature emerged, leading to a notable dispute between Rabbi Jacob Emden (Ya&#x27;avetz) and Jonathan Eybeschuetz. Additionally, a successor movement known as Frankism, led by Jacob Frank, began in Eastern Europe during this century. Part of the Sabbateans lived on until well into 21st-century Turkey as descendants of the Dönmeh.

==Sabbatai Zevi==

Sabbatai Zevi was a Sephardic ordained rabbi from Smyrna (now İzmir, Turkey). A kabbalist of Romaniote origin, Zevi, who was active throughout the Ottoman Empire, claimed to be the long-awaited Jewish Messiah. He was the founder of the Sabbatean movement, whose followers subsequently were to be known as Dönmeh &quot;converts&quot; or crypto-Jews.

==Conversion to Islam==

In February 1666, upon arriving in Constantinople, Sabbatai was imprisoned on the order of the grand vizier Köprülüzade Fazıl Ahmed Pasha; in September of that same year, after being moved from different prisons around the capital to Adrianople (the imperial court&#x27;s seat) for judgment on accusations of fomenting sedition, Sabbatai was given by the Grand Vizier, in the name of the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Mehmed IV, the choice of either facing death by some type of ordeal, or of converting to Islam. Sabbatai seems to have chosen the latter by donning from then on a turban. He was then also rewarded by the heads of the Ottoman state with a generous pension for his compliance with their political and religious plans.

Sabbatai&#x27;s conversion to Islam was extremely disheartening for the world&#x27;s Jewish communities. In addition to the misery and disappointment from within, Muslims and Christians jeered at and scorned the credulous and duped Jews.

In spite of Sabbatai&#x27;s apostasy, many of his adherents still tenaciously clung to him, claiming that his conversion was a part of the Messianic scheme. This belief was further upheld and strengthened by the likes of Nathan of Gaza and Samuel Primo, who were interested in maintaining the movement.

Many within Zevi&#x27;s inner circle followed him into Islam, including his wife Sarah and most of his closest relatives and friends. Nathan of Gaza, the scholar closest to Zevi, who had caused Zevi to reveal his Messiahship and in turn became his prophet, never followed his master into Islam but remained a Jew, albeit excommunicated by his Jewish brethren.

After Sabbatai Zevi&#x27;s apostasy, many Jews, although horrified, clung to the belief that Zevi could still be regarded as the true Jewish Messiah. They constituted the largest number of Sabbateans during the 17th and 18th centuries. By the 19th century, Jewish Sabbateans had been reduced to small groups of hidden followers who feared being discovered for their beliefs, that were deemed to be entirely heretical and antithetical to Rabbinic Judaism. These very Jews fell under the category of &quot;sectarian&quot; Sabbateans, which originated when many Sabbateans refused to accept that Zevi&#x27;s feigned apostasy might have been indicative of the fact that their faith was genuinely an illusion.

Another large group of Sabbateans after Zevi&#x27;s apostasy began to view Islam in an extremely negative light. Polemics against Islam erupted directly after Zevi&#x27;s forced conversion. Some of these attacks were considered part of a largely anti-Sabbatean agenda. Accusations coming from anti-Sabbatean Jews revolved around the idea that Sabbatai Zevi&#x27;s feigned conversion to Islam was rightfully an indicator of a false claim of Messianship.

Inside the Ottoman Empire, those followers of Zevi who had converted to Islam but who secretly continued Jewish observances and brit milah became known as the Dönmeh ( &quot;convert&quot;). There were some internal sub-divisions within the sect, according to the geographical locations of the group, and according to who the leaders of these groups were after the death of Sabbatai Zevi.

==Sabbatean-related controversies in Jewish history==
===The Emden-Eybeschutz controversy===

The Emden-Eybeschutz controversy was a serious rabbinical disputation with wider political ramifications in Europe that followed the accusations by Rabbi Jacob Emden (1697–1776), a fierce opponent of the Sabbateans, against Rabbi Jonathan Eybeschutz (1690–1764) whom he accused of being a secret Sabbatean.

The Emden-Eybeschutz controversy arose concerning the amulets which Emden suspected Eybeschutz of issuing. It was alleged that these amulets recognized the messianic claims of Sabbatai Zevi. Emden then accused Eybeschutz of heresy. Emden was known for his attacks directed against the adherents, or those he supposed to be adherents, of Sabbatai Zevi. In Emden&#x27;s eyes, Eybeschutz was a convicted Sabbatean. The controversy lasted several years, continuing even after Eybeschutz&#x27;s death.

Emden&#x27;s assertion of heresy was chiefly based on the interpretation of some amulets prepared by Eybeschutz, in which Emden professed to see Sabbatean allusions. Hostilities began before Eybeschutz left Prague; when Eybeschutz was named chief rabbi of the three communities of Altona, Hamburg, and Wandsbek in 1751, the controversy reached the stage of intense and bitter antagonism. Emden maintained that he was at first prevented by threats from publishing anything against Eybeschutz. He solemnly declared in his synagogue the writer of the amulets to be a Sabbatean heretic and deserving of &quot;ḥerem&quot; (excommunication).

The majority of the rabbis in Poland, Moravia, and Bohemia, as well as the leaders of the Three Communities, supported Eybeschutz: the accusation was &quot;utterly incredible&quot;.

In July 1725, the Ashkenazic beth din of Amsterdam had issued a ban of excommunication on the entire Sabbatian sect (). Writings of Sabbatian nature found by the beit Din at that time were attributed to Eybeschutz. In early September, similar proclamations were issued by the &quot;batei din&quot; of Frankfurt and the triple community of Altona, Hamburg, and Wandsbeck. The three bans were printed and circulated in other Jewish communities throughout Europe. Rabbi Ezekiel Katzenellenbogen, the chief rabbi of the Triple Community and Rabbi Moses Hagiz were unwilling to attack Eybeschütz publicly, mentioning that &quot;greater than him have fallen and crumbled&quot; and that &quot;there is nothing we can do to him&quot;. However, Rabbi Katzenelenbogen stated that one of the texts found by the Amsterdam beit din &quot;Va&#x27;avo Hayom el Ha&#x27;Ayin&quot; &quot;And I Came This Day into the Fountain&quot; was authored by Jonathan Eybeschütz and declared that the all copies of the work that were in circulation should be immediately burned. Emden later suggested that the rabbis decided against attacking Eybeschutz out of a reluctance to offend his powerful family and a fear of rich supporters of his living in their communities. As a result of Eybeschutz and other rabbis in Prague formulating a new (and different) ban against Sabbatianism in September of that year his reputation was restored and Eybeschutz was regarded as having been totally vindicated. The issue was to arise again, albeit tangentially, in the 1751 dispute between Emden and Eybeschutz.

The controversy was a momentous incident in Jewish history of the period, involving both Yechezkel Landau and the Vilna Gaon, and may be credited with having crushed the lingering belief in Sabbatai current even in some Orthodox circles. In 1760 the quarrel broke out once more when some Sabbatean elements were discovered among the students of Eybeschutz&#x27; yeshiva. At the same time his younger son, Wolf, presented himself as a Sabbatean prophet, with the result that the yeshiva was closed.

===Sabbateans and early Hasidism===
Some scholars see seeds of the Hasidic movement within the Sabbatean movement. When Hasidism began to spread its influence, a serious schism evolved between the Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews. Those who rejected the Hasidic movement dubbed themselves as &quot;misnagdim&quot; (&quot;opponents&quot;).

Critics of Hasidic Judaism expressed concern that Hasidism might become a messianic sect as had occurred among the followers of both Sabbatai Zevi and Jacob Frank. However the Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism, came at a time when the Jewish masses of Eastern Europe were reeling in bewilderment and disappointment engendered by the two Jewish false messiahs Sabbatai Zevi (1626–1676) and Jacob Frank (1726–1791) in particular.

===Sabbateans and modern secularism===

Some scholars have claimed that the Sabbatean movement in general fostered and connected well with the principles of modern secularism. Related to this is the drive of the Dönmeh in Turkey for secularizing their society just as European Jews promoted the values of Age of Enlightenment and its Jewish equivalent the &quot;haskalah&quot;.

==Rabbis who opposed the Sabbateans==
* Joseph Escapa (1572–1662) was especially known for having been the teacher of Zevi and for having afterward excommunicated him.
* Aaron Lapapa (1590–1674) was the rabbi at Smyrna in 1665, when Zevi&#x27;s movement was at its height there. He was one of the few rabbis to oppose and excommunicate Zevi. Zevi and his adherents retorted by deposing him and forcing him to leave the city, and his office was given to his colleague, Hayyim Benveniste, at that time one of Sabbatai&#x27;s followers. After Sabbatai&#x27;s conversion to Islam, Lapapa seems to have been reinstated.
* Jacob ben Aaron Sasportas (1610–1698) was one of the fiercest opponents of the Sabbatean movement. He wrote many letters to various communities in Europe, Asia, and Africa, exhorting them to unmask the impostors and to warn the people against them. He documented his struggle in his book &quot;Tzitzat Novel Tzvi&quot;, the title being based on Isaiah 28:4. He wrote a number of works, such as &quot;Toledot Ya&#x27;akob&quot; (1652), an index of Biblical passages found in the &quot;haggadah&quot; of the Jerusalem Talmud, similar to Aaron Pesaro&#x27;s &quot;Toledot Aharon&quot;, which relates to the Babylonian Talmud only; and &quot;Ohel Ya&#x27;akov&quot; (1737), a volume of halachic responsa which includes polemical correspondence against Zevi and his followers.
* Jacob Hagis (1620–1674) was one of Zevi&#x27;s chief opponents, who put him under the ban. About 1673 Hagis went to Constantinople to publish his &quot;Lehem ha-Panim,&quot; but he died there before this was accomplished. This book, as well as many others of his, was lost.
* Naphtali Cohen (1649–1718) was a kabbalist who was tricked into giving an to a book by the Sabbatean Nehemiah Hayyun. Provided with this and with other recommendations secured in the same way, Hayyun traveled throughout Moravia and Silesia, propagating everywhere his Sabbatean teachings. Cohen soon discovered his mistake, and endeavored, without success, to recover his approbation, although he did not as yet realize the full import of the book. It was in 1713, while Cohen was staying at Breslau (where he acted as a rabbi until 1716), that Haham Tzvi Ashkenazi of Amsterdam informed him of its tenets. Cohen thereupon acted rigorously. He launched a ban against the author and his book, and became one of the most zealous supporters of Haham Tzvi in his campaign against Hayyun.
* David Nieto (1654–1728) was the &quot;haham&quot; of the Spanish and Portuguese Jewish community in London. He waged war untiringly on the Sabbateans, which he regarded as dangerous to the best interests of Judaism, and in this connection wrote his &quot;Esh Dat&quot; (London, 1715) against Nehemiah Hayyun (who supported Zevi).
* Tzvi Ashkenazi (1656–1718) known as the &quot;Chacham Tzvi&quot;, for some time rabbi of Amsterdam, was a resolute opponent of the followers of Sabbatai Zevi. In Salonica he also witnessed the impact of the Sabbatai Zevi movement on the community, and this experience became a determining factor in his whole career. His son Jacob Emden served as rabbi in Emden and followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps in combating the Sabbatean movement.
* Moses Hagiz (1671 – c. 1750) was born in Jerusalem and waged a campaign against Sabbatean emissaries during 1725–1726.
* Jacob Emden (1697–1776) was Talmudic scholar and leading opponent of the Sabbatians. He is best known as the opponent of Rabbi Jonathan Eybeschutz, whom he accused of being a Sabbatean during The Emden-Eybeschütz Controversy.

<text>Kelps are large brown algae or seaweeds that make up the order Laminariales. There are about 30 different genera. Despite its appearance and use of photosynthesis in chloroplasts, kelp is technically not a plant but a stramenopile (a group containing many protists).

Kelp grow from stalks close together in very dense areas like forests under shallow temperate and Arctic oceans. They were previously thought to have appeared in the Miocene, 5 to 23 million years ago based on fossils from California. New fossils of kelp holdfasts from early Oligocene rocks in Washington State show that kelps were present in the northeastern Pacific Ocean by at least 32 million years ago. The organisms require nutrient-rich water with temperatures between . They are known for their high growth rate—the genera &quot;Macrocystis&quot; and &quot;Nereocystis&quot; can grow as fast as half a metre a day (that is, about 20 inches a day), ultimately reaching .

Through the 19th century, the word &quot;kelp&quot; was closely associated with seaweeds that could be burned to obtain soda ash (primarily sodium carbonate). The seaweeds used included species from both the orders Laminariales and Fucales. The word &quot;kelp&quot; was also used directly to refer to these processed ashes.

==Description==
The thallus (or body) consists of flat or leaf-like structures known as blades that originate from elongated stem-like structures, the stipes. A root-like structure, the holdfast, anchors the kelp to the substrate of the ocean. Gas-filled bladders (pneumatocysts) form at the base of blades of American species, such as &quot;Nereocystis lueteana,&quot; (Mert. &amp; Post &amp; Rupr.) to hold the kelp blades close to the surface.

=== Growth and reproduction ===
Growth occurs at the base of the meristem, where the blades and stipe meet. Growth may be limited by grazing. Sea urchins, for example, can reduce entire areas to urchin barrens. The kelp life cycle involves a diploid sporophyte and haploid gametophyte stage. The haploid phase begins when the mature organism releases many spores, which then germinate to become male or female gametophytes. Sexual reproduction then results in the beginning of the diploid sporophyte stage, which will develop into a mature individual.

The parenchymatous thalli are generally covered with a mucilage layer, rather than cuticle.

== Taxonomy ==
=== Phylogeny ===

Seaweed were generally considered homologues of terrestrial plants, but are only very distantly related to plants, and have evolved plant-like structures through convergent evolution. Where plants have leaves, stems, and reproductive organs, kelp have independently evolved blades, stipes, and sporangia. With radiometric dating and the measure Ma “unequivocal minimum constraint for total group Pinaceae” vascular plants have been measured as having evolved around 419–454 Ma while the ancestors of Laminariales are much younger at 189 Ma. Although these groups are distantly related as well as different in evolutionary age, there are still comparisons that can be made between the structures of terrestrial plants and kelp but in terms of evolutionary history, most of these similarities come from convergent evolution.

Some kelp species including giant kelp, have evolved transport mechanisms for organic as well as inorganic compounds, similar to mechanisms of transport in trees and other vascular plants. In kelp this transportation network uses trumpet-shaped sieve elements (SEs). A 2015 study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of giant kelp (&quot;Macrocystis pyrifera&quot;) transport anatomy looked at 6 different laminariales species to see if they had typical vascular plant allometric relationships (if SEs had a correlation with the size of an organism). Researchers expected to find the kelp’s phloem to work similarly to a plant&#x27;s xylem and therefore display similar allometric trends to minimize pressure gradient. The study found no universal allometric scaling between all tested structures of the laminariales species which implies that the transport network of brown algae is only just beginning to evolve to efficiently fit their current niches.

Apart from undergoing convergent evolution with plants, species of kelp have undergone convergent evolution within their own phylogeny that has led to niche conservatism. This niche conservatism means that some species of kelp have convergently evolved to share similar niches, as opposed to all species diverging into distinct niches through adaptive radiation. A 2020 study looked at functional traits (blade mass per area, stiffness, strength, etc.) of 14 species of kelp and found that many of these traits evolved convergently across kelp phylogeny. With different species of kelp filling slightly different environmental niches, specifically along a wave disturbance gradient, many of these convergently evolved traits for structural reinforcement also correlate with distribution along that gradient. The wave disturbance gradient that this study refers to is the environments that this kelp inhabit have a varied level of perturbation from the tide and waves that pull at the kelp. It can be assumed from these results that niche partitioning along wave disturbance gradients is a key driver of divergence between closely related kelp.

Due to the often varied and turbulent habitat that kelp inhabit, plasticity of certain structural traits has been a key for the evolutionary history of the phyla. Plasticity helps with a very important aspect of kelp adaptations to ocean environments, and that is the unusually high levels of morphological homoplasy between lineages. This in fact has made classifying brown algae difficult. Kelp often have similar morphological features to other species within its own area since the roughness of the wave disturbance regime, but can look fairly different from other members of its own species that are found in different wave disturbance regimes. Plasticity in kelps most often involves blade morphology such as the width, ruffle, and thickness of blades. Just one example is the giant bull kelp &quot;Nereocystis luetkeana&quot;, which have evolved to change blade shape in order to increase drag in water and interception of light when exposed to certain environments. Bull kelp are not unique in this adaptation; many kelp species have evolved a genetic plasticity for blade shapes for different water flow habitats. So individuals of the same species will have differences to other individuals of the same species due to what habitat they grow in. Many species have different morphologies for different wave disturbance regimes but giant kelp &quot;Macrocystis integrifolia&quot; has been found to have plasticity allowing for 4 distinct types of blade morphology depending on habitat. Where many species only have two or three different blade shapes for maximizing efficiency in only two or three habitats. These different blade shapes were found to decrease breakage and increase ability to photosynthesize. Blade adaptations like these are how kelp have evolved for efficiency in structure in a turbulent ocean environment, to the point where their stability can shape entire habitats. Apart from these structural adaptations, the evolution of dispersal methods relating to structure have been important for the success of kelp as well.

Kelp have had to adapt dispersal methods that can make successful use of ocean currents. Buoyancy of certain kelp structures allows for species to disperse with the flow of water. Certain kelp form kelp rafts, which can travel great distances away from the source population and colonize other areas. The bull kelp genus &quot;Durvillaea&quot; includes six species, some that have adapted buoyancy and others that have not. Those that have adapted buoyancy have done so thanks to the evolution of a gas filled structure called the pneumatocysts which is an adaptation that allows the kelp to float higher towards the surface to photosynthesize and also aids in dispersal by floating kelp rafts. For &quot;Macrocystis pyrifera&quot;, adaptation of pneumatocysts and raft forming have made the species dispersal method so successful that the immense spread of coast in which the species can be found has been found to actually be very recently colonized. This can be observed by the low genetic diversity in the subantarctic region. Dispersal by rafts from buoyant species also explains some evolutionary history for non-buoyant species of kelp. Since these rafts commonly have hitchhikers of other diverse species, they provide a mechanism for dispersal for species that lack buoyancy. This mechanism has been recently confirmed to be the cause of some dispersal and evolutionary history for kelp species in a study done with genomic analysis. Studies of kelp structure evolution have helped in the understanding of the adaptations that have allowed for kelp to not only be extremely successful as a group of organisms but also successful as an ecosystem engineer of kelp forests, some of the most diverse and dynamic ecosystems on earth.

==Ecology==
===Kelp forests===
Kelp may develop dense forests with high production, biodiversity and ecological function. Along the Norwegian coast these forests cover 5,800 km2, and they support large numbers of animals. Numerous sessile animals (sponges, bryozoans and ascidians) are found on kelp stipes and mobile invertebrate fauna are found in high densities on epiphytic algae on the kelp stipes and on kelp holdfasts. More than 100,000 mobile invertebrates per square meter are found on kelp stipes and holdfasts in well-developed kelp forests. While larger invertebrates and in particular sea urchins (&quot;Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis&quot;) are important secondary consumers controlling large barren ground areas on the Norwegian coast, they are scarce inside dense kelp forests.

===Interactions===

Some animals are named after the kelp, either because they inhabit the same habitat as kelp or because they feed on kelp. These include:
* Northern kelp crab (&quot;Pugettia producta&quot;) and graceful kelp crab (&quot;Pugettia gracilis&quot;), Pacific coast of North America.
* Kelpfish (blenny) (e.g., &quot;Heterosticbus rostratus&quot;, genus &quot;Gibbonsia&quot;), Pacific coast of North America.
* Kelp goose (kelp hen) (&quot;Chloephaga hybrida&quot;), South America and the Falkland Islands
* Kelp pigeon (sheathbill) (&quot;Chionis alba&quot; and &quot;Chionis minor&quot;), Antarctic

== Conservation ==
Overfishing nearshore ecosystems leads to the degradation of kelp forests. Herbivores are released from their usual population regulation, leading to over-grazing of kelp and other algae. This can quickly result in barren landscapes where only a small number of species can thrive. Other major factors which threaten kelp include marine pollution and the quality of water, climate changes and certain invasive species.

Kelp forests are some of the most productive ecosystems in the world - they are home to a great diversity of species. Many groups, like those at the Seattle Aquarium, are studying the health, habitat, and population trends in order to understand why certain kelp (like bull kelp) thrives in some areas and not others. Remotely Operated Vehicles are used in the surveying of sites and the data extracted is used to learn about which conditions are best suited for kelp restoration. 

== Uses ==

Giant kelp can be harvested fairly easily because of its surface canopy and growth habit of staying in deeper water.

Kelp ash is rich in iodine and alkali. In great amount, kelp ash can be used in soap and glass production. Until the Leblanc process was commercialized in the early 19th century, burning of kelp in Scotland was one of the principal industrial sources of soda ash (predominantly sodium carbonate). Around 23 tons of seaweed was required to produce 1 ton of kelp ash. The kelp ash would consist of around 5% sodium carbonate.

Once the Leblanc Process became commercially viable in Britain during the 1820s, common salt replaced kelp ash as raw material for sodium carbonate. Though the price of kelp ash went into steep decline, seaweed remained the only commercial source of iodine. To supply the new industry in iodine synthesis, kelp ash production continued in some parts of West and North Scotland, North West Ireland and Guernsey. The species &quot;Saccharina latissima&quot; yielded the greatest amount of iodine (between 10 and 15 lbs per ton) and was most abundant in Guernsey. Iodine was extracted from kelp ash using a lixiviation process. As with sodium carbonate however, mineral sources eventually supplanted seaweed in iodine production.

Alginate, a kelp-derived carbohydrate, is used to thicken products such as ice cream, jelly, salad dressing, and toothpaste, as well as an ingredient in exotic dog food and in manufactured goods. Alginate powder is also used frequently in general dentistry and orthodontics for making impressions of the upper and lower arches. Kelp polysaccharides are used in skin care as gelling ingredients and because of the benefits provided by &quot;fucoidan&quot;.

Kombu (昆布 in Japanese, and 海带 in Chinese, &quot;Saccharina japonica&quot; and others), several Pacific species of kelp, is a very important ingredient in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean cuisines. Kombu is used to flavor broths and stews (especially &quot;dashi&quot;), as a savory garnish (&quot;tororo konbu&quot;) for rice and other dishes, as a vegetable, and a primary ingredient in popular snacks (such as &quot;tsukudani&quot;). Transparent sheets of kelp (&quot;oboro konbu&quot;) are used as an edible decorative wrapping for rice and other foods.

Kombu can be used to soften beans during cooking, and to help convert indigestible sugars and thus reduce flatulence.

In Russia, especially in the Russian Far East, and former Soviet Union countries several types of kelp are of commercial importance: &quot;Saccharina latissima&quot;, &quot;Laminaria digitata&quot;, &quot;Saccharina japonica&quot;. Known locally as &quot;Sea Cabbage&quot; (Морская капуста in Russian), it comes in retail trade in dried or frozen, as well as in canned form and used as filler in different types of salads, soups and pastries.

Because of its high concentration of iodine, brown kelp (&quot;Laminaria&quot;) has been used to treat goiter, an enlargement of the thyroid gland caused by a lack of iodine, since medieval times. An intake of roughly 150 micrograms of iodine per day is beneficial for preventing hypothyroidism. Overconsumption can lead to kelp-induced thyrotoxicosis.

In 2010, researchers found that alginate, the soluble fibre substance in sea kelp, was better at preventing fat absorption than most over-the-counter slimming treatments in laboratory trials. As a food additive, it may be used to reduce fat absorption and thus obesity. Kelp in its natural form has not yet been demonstrated to have such effects.

Kelp&#x27;s rich iron content can help prevent iron deficiency.

===Commercial production===
Commercial production of kelp harvested from its natural habitat has taken place in Japan for over a century. Many countries today produce and consume laminaria products; the largest producer is China. &quot;Laminaria japonica&quot;, the important commercial seaweed, was first introduced into China in the late 1920s from Hokkaido, Japan. Yet mariculture of this alga on a very large commercial scale was realized in China only in the 1950s. Between the 1950s and the 1980s, kelp production in China increased from about 60 to over 250,000 dry weight metric tons annually.

==In culture==
Some of the earliest evidence for human use of marine resources, coming from Middle Stone Age sites in South Africa, includes the harvesting of foods such as abalone, limpets, and mussels associated with kelp forest habitats.

In 2007, Erlandson et al. suggested that kelp forests around the Pacific Rim may have facilitated the dispersal of anatomically modern humans following a coastal route from Northeast Asia to the Americas. This &quot;kelp highway hypothesis&quot; suggested that highly productive kelp forests supported rich and diverse marine food webs in nearshore waters, including many types of fish, shellfish, birds, marine mammals, and seaweeds that were similar from Japan to California, Erlandson and his colleagues also argued that coastal kelp forests reduced wave energy and provided a linear dispersal corridor entirely at sea level, with few obstacles to maritime peoples. Archaeological evidence from California&#x27;s Channel Islands confirms that islanders were harvesting kelp forest shellfish and fish, beginning as much as 12,000 years ago.

During the Highland Clearances, many Scottish Highlanders were moved on to areas of estates known as crofts, and went to industries such as fishing and kelping (producing soda ash from the ashes of kelp). At least until the 1840s, when there were steep falls in the price of kelp, landlords wanted to create pools of cheap or virtually free labour, supplied by families subsisting in new crofting townships. Kelp collection and processing was a very profitable way of using this labour, and landlords petitioned successfully for legislation designed to stop emigration. The profitability of kelp harvesting meant that landlords began to subdivide their land for small tenant kelpers, who could now afford higher rent than their gentleman farmer counterparts. But the economic collapse of the kelp industry in northern Scotland during the 1820s led to further emigration, especially to North America.

Natives of the Falkland Islands are sometimes nicknamed &quot;Kelpers&quot;. This designation is primarily applied by outsiders rather than the natives themselves.

In Chinese slang, &quot;kelp&quot; (), is used to describe an unemployed returnee. It has negative overtones, implying the person is drifting aimlessly, and is also a homophonic expression (, literally &quot;sea waiting&quot;). This expression is contrasted with the employed returnee, having a dynamic ability to travel across the ocean: the &quot;sea turtle&quot; () and is also homophonic with another word (, literally &quot;sea return&quot;).

<text>Singapore English (SgE, SE, en-SG) is the set of varieties of the English language native to Singapore. In Singapore, English is spoken in two main forms: Singaporean Standard English, which is indistinguishable grammatically from British English, and Singaporean Colloquial English, which is better known as Singlish.

Singapore is a cosmopolitan society. For example, in 2015, among Singaporeans of Chinese descent, over a third spoke English as their main language at home while almost half spoke Mandarin and the rest spoke various varieties of Chinese such as Hokkien. Most Singaporeans of Indian descent speak either English or a South Asian language. Many Malay Singaporeans use Malay as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; among the ethnic groups of the Malay world, while Eurasians and mixed-race Singaporeans are usually monolingual in English.

English is the medium of communication among students from preschool to university in Singapore. Many families use two or three languages on a regular basis, and English is often one of them. The level of fluency in English among residents in Singapore also varies greatly from person to person, depending on their educational background, but English in general is nevertheless understood, spoken and written as the main language throughout the country.

== Classification of Singapore English ==
Singapore English can be classified into Singapore Standard English (SSE) and Singapore Colloquial English (Singlish). The language consists of three sociolects; Acrolect, Mesolect, and Basilect. Both Acrolect and Mesolect are regarded as Standard Singapore English, while Basilect is considered as Singlish. 
* Acrolect; there is no substantial difference from Standard British English (SBE), though there may be some features of pronunciation that indicate the speaker is Singaporean, such as use of a full vowel in unstressed syllables and a relatively monophthongal realisation of the vowel.
* Mesolect; it has some features distinct from SBE 
*# Question tenses in an indirect form; e.g. &quot;May I ask where is the toilet?&quot;
*# Indefinite article deletion (copula absence); e.g. &quot;May I apply for car licence?&quot; (Instead of saying &quot;a&quot; car licence)
*# Lack of marking in verb forms (Regularisation); e.g. &quot;He always go to the shopping centre.&quot;
* Basilect (Singlish); 
*# Generalised &quot;is it&quot; question tag; e.g. &quot;You coming today, Is it?&quot;
*# Consistent copula deletion; e.g. &quot;My handwriting no good, lah.&quot;
*# Use of particles like ah; lah, e.g. &quot;Wait ah; Hurry lah, I need to go now!&quot;

Singaporeans vary their language according to social situations (Pakir 1991) and attitudes that they want to convey (Poedjosoedarmo 1993). Better educated Singaporeans with a &quot;higher&quot; standard of English tend to speak &quot;Standard&quot; Singapore English (the acrolect), whereas those who are less-educated or whose first language is not English tend to speak Singlish (the basilect). Gupta (1994) said that most Singaporean speakers systematically alternate between colloquial and formal language depending on the formality of the situation.

== Standard Singapore English ==
Standard Singapore English is the standard form of English used in Singapore. It generally resembles British English and is often used in more formal settings such as the workplace or when communicating with people of higher authority such as teachers, bosses and government officials. Singapore English acts as the &quot;bridge&quot; among different ethnic groups in Singapore. Standard Singapore English retains British spelling and grammar.

===History===
The British established a trading post on the island of Singapore in 1819, and the population grew rapidly thereafter, attracting many immigrants from Chinese provinces and from India. The roots of Standard Singapore English derive from nearly a century and a half of British control. Its local character seems to have developed early in the English-medium schools of the 19th and early-20th centuries, where the teachers often came from India and Ceylon, as well as from various parts of Europe and from the United States of America. By 1900 Eurasians and other locals were employed as teachers. Apart from a period of Japanese occupation (1942–1945), Singapore remained a British colony until 1963, when it joined the Malaysian federation, but this proved a short-lived alliance, largely due to ethnic rivalries. Since its expulsion from the Federation in 1965, Singapore has operated as an independent city-state. English served as the administrative language of the British colonial government, and when Singapore gained self-government in 1959 and independence in 1965, the Singaporean government decided to keep English as the main language to maximise economic prosperity. The use of English as the nation&#x27;s first language serves to bridge the gap between the diverse ethnic groups in Singapore; English operates as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the nation. The use of English as a global language for commerce, technology and science has also helped to expedite Singapore&#x27;s development and integration into the global economy. Public schools use English as the main language of instruction, although students are also required to receive part of their instruction in their mother tongue; placement in such courses is based on ethnicity and not without controversy.
The standard Singaporean accent used to be officially RP. However, in recent decades, a standard Singaporean accent, quite independent of any external standard, including RP, started to emerge. A 2003 study by the National Institute of Education in Singapore suggests that a standard Singaporean pronunciation is emerging and is on the cusp of being standardised. Singaporean accents can be said to be largely non-rhotic.

In 2023, opposition leader Pritam Singh advocated for English proficiency testing for immigrants seeking Singaporean citizenship. Polling data of native-born Singaporeans show broad support for the proposal.

=== Singapore&#x27;s Speak Good English Movement ===
The wide use of Singlish led the government to launch the Speak Good English Movement in Singapore in 2000 in an attempt to replace Singlish with Standard English. This movement was made to show the need for Singaporeans to speak Standard English. Nowadays, all children in schools are being taught Standard English with one of the other official languages (Chinese, Malay, Tamil) being taught as a second language. In Singapore, English is a &quot;working language&quot; that serves the economy and development and is associated with the broader global community. Meanwhile, the rest are &quot;mother tongues&quot; that are associated with the country&#x27;s culture. Speaking Standard English also helps Singaporeans communicate and express themselves in their everyday life.
In 2014, the Singaporean government made an announcement entitled &quot;Speak Good English Movement brings fun back to Grammar and good English&quot;, where the strategies that would be used to promote their program in the following years were explained. Specifically, the government would release a series of videos demystifying the difficulty and dullness of the grammatical rules of the English language. These videos provide a more humorous approach to learning basic grammar rules. Singaporeans will now be able to practise the grammatical rules in both written and spoken English thanks to a more interactive approach.

=== Malay, Indian, and Chinese influences ===
Although Standard Singapore English (SSE) is mainly influenced by British English and, recently, American English, there are other languages that also contribute to its use on a regular basis. The majority of Singaporeans speak more than one language, with many speaking three to four. Most Singaporean children are brought up bilingual. They are introduced to Malay, Chinese, Tamil, or Singapore Colloquial English (Singlish) as their native languages, depending on their families&#x27; ethnic backgrounds and/or socioeconomic status. They also acquire those languages from interacting with friends in school and other places. Naturally, the presence of other languages in Singapore has influenced Singapore English, something particularly apparent in Singlish.

Both Singapore English and Singapore colloquial English are used with multiple accents. Because Singaporeans speak different ethnic mother tongues, they exhibit ethnic-specific features in their speech such that their ethnicity can be readily identified from their speech alone. The strength of one&#x27;s ethnic mother tongue-accented English accent depends on factors like formality and their language dominance. Words from Malay, Chinese, and Tamil are also borrowed, if not code-switched, into Singapore English. For example, the Malay words &quot;&quot; (to eat), &quot;&quot; (finished), and the Hokkien word &quot;kiasu&quot; () are constantly used, having been adopted into the lexicon, to the point that Singaporeans are not necessarily aware of which language those words are from. The nativisation process has progressed so far that the word &quot;kiasu&quot; has been used in the Singapore press since 2000 without being italicised, and went onto claim international recognition, being admitted to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2007.

== Overview of Singaporean accents ==
Broadly speaking, Singaporean English accents are based on the sound systems of standard non-rhotic Southern British English accents, as is often the case with dialects of English spoken in Commonwealth nations aside from Canada. Like many Southern British English dialects, the vowels in and are distinct in Singapore English, and almost all speakers use the vowel in the word &quot;plant&quot;, rather than the vowel .

As English becomes more often used as a day-to-day language in Singapore, mass adoption of local norms have led to the formation of a standard Singaporean accent with characteristics driven by conventions and language change within the country. Unlike some contact varieties of English, Singapore English is now considered to be , and has been able to evolve independently of any other standard. Accents still vary, depending on age, ethnicity and upbringing.

=== Rhoticity ===
Singapore English is predominantly non-rhotic, like Australian and Nigerian English, so most speakers will leave out the &quot;r&quot; sound in words like &quot;far&quot;. Semi-rhotic accents are, however, quite commonly heard on radio. Studies suggest that final &quot;r&quot; sounds are more likely to be realised by younger speakers and women among Chinese and Indian Singaporeans, and that this tendency is more common in content words than in function words, and in reading than in conversation. Rhoticity is nevertheless generally uncommon and seldom consistent, even in environments where a linking &quot;r&quot; could occur, e.g., &quot;my brother is&quot; and &quot;my sister is&quot;. In a 2018 study examining the speech of 104 Singapore English speakers, linking &quot;r&quot; was used less than 20% of the time, and cases of intrusive &quot;r&quot; (e.g., pronouncing &quot;drawing&quot; as &quot;draw-ring&quot;) were rare.

=== Front vowels ===


* and : The vowel is closer to the vowel in in Singapore English than in most other dialects, and at its most extreme, it can be as high and front as the latter vowel, making &quot;sit&quot; and &quot;seat&quot; homophones. Several studies confirm significant overlap between these two vowels, however demonstrates that a distinction is still maintained by the majority of native speakers in the study. Speakers may also rely on vowel length to distinguish words like &quot;rid&quot; and &quot;read&quot;, since the vowel is usually very short.
* : According to , the vowel in has minimal diphthongal movement, meaning there is little change in its quality over time, compared to standard southern British English accents. It may be described as a short or long monophthong . Acoustic measurements suggest that, on average, this vowel is slightly more diphthongal for Chinese Singaporeans than for Malays.
* &quot;Met&quot;–&quot;mat&quot; merger: The vowels in &quot;met&quot; and &quot;mat&quot; are seldom distinguished in conversational speech. Any distinction is less likely between words ending in stop consonants, like &quot;met&quot; and &quot;mat&quot;, though &quot;bed&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; are kept distinct (see ). Some studies report that tends to be less centralised in vowel space. The vowel in is long and open-mid.

==== &quot;Next&quot;–&quot;text&quot; split ====

For nearly all speakers, some words from the lexical set have diverged into a separate group, so words like &quot;next&quot; and &quot;text&quot; no longer rhyme. In this scenario, the word &quot;next&quot; has a raised vowel, which is distinguished from the low-mid vowel in &quot;text&quot;. The raised vowel occurs unpredictably in a handful of words like &quot;leg&quot;, &quot;dead&quot; and &quot;head&quot;; other words like &quot;fed&quot; and &quot;neck&quot; do not have this vowel. For many speakers, it is equivalent to the vowel in , in which case &quot;dead&quot; rhymes with &quot;made&quot;, but not with &quot;fed&quot;. Taking this into account, speakers with the complete &quot;met&quot;–&quot;mat&quot; merger will distinguish &quot;lag&quot; from &quot;leg&quot;, but not the words &quot;lad&quot; and &quot;led&quot; . The raised vowel can also occur in &quot;red&quot;, making &quot;red&quot; and &quot;read&quot; (as in &quot;I have read the book&quot;) non-homophones.

Speakers use the raised vowel in &quot;bed&quot;, &quot;dead&quot;, &quot;edge&quot;, &quot;egg&quot;, &quot;head&quot;, &quot;heavy&quot;, &quot;instead&quot;, &quot;leg&quot;, &quot;next&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;said&quot; and &quot;says&quot;, though for some of these words, like &quot;edge&quot;, both raised and non-raised pronunciations are heard. The vast majority of other words like &quot;mess&quot;, &quot;beg&quot; and &quot;dread&quot; continue to use the more common low-mid vowel. The &quot;next&quot;–&quot;text&quot; split appears to be motivated by the &quot;met&quot;–&quot;mat&quot; merger in the speech of younger Singaporeans, who are more likely than older speakers to raise the vowel in &quot;next&quot;, though younger speakers raise it to a lower height on average. While words with the raised vowel tend to end in voiced stop consonants like &quot;d&quot; and &quot;g&quot;, this split is not phonologically conditioned, unlike raising in Pacific Northwest English.

=== Central and back vowels ===

* : The vowel is a mid central vowel, or .
* and : The vowels in &quot;luck&quot; and &quot;lark&quot; usually overlap and are both open central. A length distinction may still be maintained, in which case the latter vowel is longer. This is less likely in syllables closed by voiceless stop consonants like &quot;p&quot;, &quot;t&quot; and &quot;k&quot;. As Singapore English is generally non-rhotic, and both use the same vowel sound , so &quot;yard&quot; sounds like &quot;yahd&quot;. Like all free vowels, this vowel is longer in open syllables.
* and : The vowel is higher and further back in Singapore English than in Received Pronunciation. Like and , acoustic measurements show that there is some overlap between the and vowels, raising the possibility of a – merger. demonstrate that for at least some speakers, these vowels are durationally distinct, with the vowel being longer on average. While previous studies have categorised as a back vowel in Singapore English, more recent ones suggest that -fronting is now prevalent among younger speakers, and that it is more accurate to classify this variant of as a near-back or centralised vowel. proposes that is further front if there is a final consonant, like in the word &quot;soon&quot;, while in other environments it remains a back vowel .
* : Like the vowel, for many speakers, the vowel in has limited diphthongal movement over time. It is therefore sometimes described as a monophthong or .
* and : The vowel is a rounded, low back vowel . The vowel in / may be longer and closer to cardinal and this tendency is stronger before voiced consonants and in open syllables, but is otherwise the same as the vowel for many speakers. This results in identical pronunciations for &quot;cot&quot; and &quot;caught&quot; . Acoustic studies by show that speakers produce an allophone of the vowel that is higher and further back in words not closed by final consonants, like &quot;more&quot; and &quot;saw&quot;. While Singapore English is commonly and traditionally described as featuring a &quot;cot&quot;–&quot;caught&quot; merger in conversational contexts, so the same vowel is used in , , , and , newer studies suggest that there are older speakers who still maintain some distinction between &quot;cot&quot; and &quot;caught&quot;.

==== &quot;Trap&quot;–&quot;bath&quot; split ====


For the vast majority of speakers, the words &quot;grass&quot;, &quot;last&quot; and &quot;path&quot; use the vowel —the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;father&quot;—like most dialects from the south of England. Unlike some varieties of North American English, &quot;aunt&quot; and &quot;ant&quot; do not sound the same in Singapore English. While speakers will generally use the vowel in the words &quot;laugh&quot;, &quot;ask&quot;, &quot;half&quot;, &quot;example&quot; and even some words that normally have in Southern English dialects, like &quot;plastic&quot; and &quot;elastic&quot;, many speakers will use the vowel in &quot;gasp&quot;. Usage of the vowel in &quot;dance&quot; and &quot;can’t&quot; has also been reported, but this is generally rare.

=== Diphthongs ===

There are five diphthongs: , not counting , and , which are normally analysed as monophthongs in the context of Singapore English. The diphthongs in , and do not differ significantly from their counterparts in Received Pronunciation. Words with triphthongs in other dialects, like &quot;fire&quot; and &quot;towel&quot;, are normally broken down into two syllables.

The vowel in is always a centering diphthong: , or . notes that, while words like &quot;tour&quot; and &quot;sure&quot; are always pronounced with the diphthong or , many speakers will use the vowel after , like in &quot;cure&quot; and &quot;endure&quot; , if not or .

=== Consonants ===

==== Fricatives and stop consonants ====

* Pronunciation of ⟨&quot;th&quot;⟩: &quot;Th&quot;-stopping is common at the start of syllables, making &quot;tree&quot; and &quot;three&quot; homophones. This is generally more common in informal settings. Dental fricatives may undergo &quot;th&quot;-fronting at the end of words, so &quot;teeth&quot; sounds like &quot;teef&quot;, though many speakers will use a sound in the word &quot;maths&quot; . For some Tamil bilinguals, word-final &quot;th&quot; sounds are alternatively realised as stops.

* Intervocalic &quot;t&quot; and &quot;d&quot;: There are some speakers who occasionally realise &quot;t&quot; and &quot;d&quot; in words like &quot;water&quot; and &quot;medal&quot; as alveolar taps or flaps in colloquial speech, like in North American English and certain accents of Australian and New Zealand English, as a result of influence from these varieties. However, the vast majority of speakers do not do so.

* Stop consonants: Stop consonants in Singapore English are usually not released at the end of words, and voiceless stops can be aspirated or unaspirated in initial positions. Moreover, word-final &quot;k&quot; may be realised as a glottal stop , as in Malay.

==== Liquid consonants ====

* Pronunciation of final &quot;l&quot;: There are three prevalent variants of final &quot;l&quot; in Singapore English: dark &quot;l&quot;s, clear &quot;l&quot;s and vocalised &quot;l&quot;s. For speakers who vocalise their &quot;l&quot;s, the &quot;l&quot; sound can be dropped entirely after back vowels, diphthongs with back vowels, and sometimes mid central vowels, so that &quot;mole&quot; sounds like &quot;mow&quot;, and &quot;small&quot; like &quot;smaw&quot;. The diphthong is also monophthongised into before a vocalised &quot;l&quot;, so &quot;Nile&quot; and &quot;now&quot; are similar-sounding. Vocalised &quot;l&quot;s are realised as high back vowels with varying degrees of lip rounding. Older Chinese Singaporeans are more likely to vocalise final &quot;l&quot;s, and Malay speakers are more likely to use clear &quot;l&quot;s in these environments.

* Pronunciation of &quot;r&quot;: The most common and predominant realisation of the &quot;r&quot; sound in Singapore English is the postalveolar approximant . The alveolar tap or trill is an alternative realisation of &quot;r&quot; among Malay and Indian Singaporeans and older speakers in general. Among Tamil Singaporeans, the trilled variant appears to be extremely rare in comparison to the approximant and tapped &quot;r&quot;. A rare and emergent variant of &quot;r&quot;, described as a labiodental approximant, has also been reported. Across English dialects, this phenomenon is known as &quot;R&quot;-labialization.

==== Final consonant cluster reduction ====

Final consonant clusters, like , are often simplified in conversational Singapore English, in which case &quot;list&quot; drops its final &quot;t&quot;, &quot;flask&quot; its final &quot;k&quot;, and &quot;world&quot; its final &quot;d&quot;, though speakers are seldom consistent in doing so. Other examples include:

: → : &quot;environment&quot; , &quot;end&quot; 
: → : &quot;act&quot; , → : &quot;next&quot; 
: → : &quot;lift&quot; , → : &quot;lifts&quot; 

Combinations of two consonants with an &quot;s&quot; as the second component, like the in &quot;rats&quot; and in &quot;tags&quot;, and many other final consonant clusters do not usually undergo simplification.

=== Lexical incidence ===

While words generally follow the lexical incidence patterns of Southern British English accents, so &quot;new&quot; for example, is pronounced &quot;nyoo&quot;, never &quot;noo&quot; like in some North American dialects, there are several exceptions.

* The words &quot;want&quot; and &quot;what&quot; are pronounced with the open central vowel instead of the rounded vowel, like most varieties of North American English. In the English spoken in Southern England and Australia, these words are usually pronounced with the vowel.
* Many speakers use the vowel for &quot;won&quot; (&quot;win&quot; in the past tense), so that it rhymes with &quot;con&quot; and no longer sounds like &quot;one&quot;.
* For many, &quot;their&quot; sounds more like &quot;thya&quot; in informal or conversational speech, so it is distinct from &quot;there&quot;, which rhymes with &quot;mare&quot;.
* &quot;Flour&quot; is pronounced , and is clearly distinct from &quot;flower&quot;.
* &quot;Seems&quot; and &quot;seen&quot; are sometimes realised with the lax &quot;i&quot; vowel found in words like .
* The vowel in &quot;love&quot; is the mid central vowel, rather than the open vowel.
* &quot;December&quot; is sometimes &quot;De&quot;&quot;ember&quot;, with a , at least for some speakers.

=== Stress and intonation ===


Singapore English is characterised by a unique intonational system where pitch tends to be slightly raised at the end of a word with lexical stress. According to one analysis, the rightmost syllable of a stressed word or phonological word is marked with higher pitch, while words with no stress (e.g. my house&quot;) and unstressed initial syllables (e.g. again&quot;) carry relatively lower pitch. Meanwhile, all other non-final stressed syllables (e.g. &quot;writer&quot;) coincide with a mid level tone, or similar pitch contour between low and high levels. There is also a tendency for pitch contours to be accentuated near the start of a sentence and diminished towards the end, and for pitch to drop or level out at the end of declarative sentences. For example, in the phrase &quot;I don’t remember&quot; , pitch starts off low in &quot;I&quot;, then rises to a higher level in &quot;don’t&quot;. The word &quot;remember&quot; is then realised with a less accentuated low–mid–high pitch contour.

Tone assignment only takes place within the scope of the phonological word. &quot;Cranberry&quot; takes on a high–mid–high pitch contour , since &quot;cran&quot; and &quot;berry&quot; are analysed as separate words. Similarly, in &quot;brainstorm&quot; , &quot;brain&quot; and &quot;storm&quot; are both assigned high pitch. Prefixes with stress constitute their own phonological words, so the &quot;re&quot; in &quot;reenact&quot;  is high-pitched. In words where the prefix is unstressed or less salient, like &quot;unfortunate&quot;  and &quot;nonsense&quot; , the prefix is not treated as a separate unit with stress and is therefore not assigned high pitch.

Words are not restricted to discrete level tones. One alternative analysis posits that high pitch is associated with the right edge of an accentual phrase, and low pitch with the left edge; an accentual phrase may consist of a content word with zero or any number of preceding unstressed function words. For instance, in a sentence like &quot;I joined the call&quot;, in which &quot;I joined&quot; is analysed as a single accentual phrase, &quot;joined&quot; can be realised with rising pitch starting from the low pitch in &quot;I&quot;, in lieu of consistently high pitch. In this model, phonological words (e.g. &quot;cran&quot; and &quot;berry&quot; in &quot;cranberry&quot;) and prefixes with stress are analysed as belonging to separate accentual phrases. Other intonational variants have also been noted. For instance, flat pitch contours can sometimes span the entire length of words and accentual phrases where rising contours would normally be expected.

Wider pitch range is associated with the introduction of a topic near the start of a sentence. Elsewhere in the sentence, differences in pitch are less prominent, so low, mid and high tones may collapse into roughly the same pitch level. Moreover, at the end of declarative sentences and open-ended questions, &quot;high-pitched&quot; syllables are weaker and often replaced with a drop or leveling out in pitch. For example, in the sentence &quot;I left all my things on the table&quot;, pitch is much higher on &quot;left&quot; than it is on the second syllable of &quot;table&quot;, which has underlying high pitch but tends to be realised instead with a fall or leveling out in pitch. Yes-no questions are accompanied with rising pitch, as is the case in many other dialects of English. Rising pitch is also commonly used when there is non-final information at the end of an utterance, sometimes to indicate a non-final item in a list.

==== Timing ====

Unstressed initial syllables are often realised with shorter duration and lower intensity. There is also a tendency for the last syllable in an utterance to be lengthened or dragged out.

Singapore English tends towards syllable timing, unlike British English, which is considered stress-timed.

== Foreign dialects of English in Singapore ==
A wide range of foreign English dialects can be heard in Singapore. American and British accents are often heard on local television and radio due to the frequent airing of foreign television programmes.

== Singapore Colloquial English / Singlish ==
Unlike Singapore Standard English, Singlish includes many discourse particles and loan words from Malay, Mandarin and Hokkien. Many of such loan words include swear words, particularly Hokkien profanities such as &quot;kanina&quot; and &quot;chee bai&quot;. Hence, it is commonly regarded with low prestige in the country and not used in formal communication.

However, Singlish has been used in several locally produced films, including &quot;Army Daze&quot;, &quot;Mee Pok Man&quot; and &quot;Talking Cock the Movie&quot;, among others. Some local sitcoms, in particular &quot;Phua Chu Kang Pte Ltd&quot;, also feature extensive use of Singlish.

The proliferation of Singlish has been controversial and the use of Singlish is not endorsed by the government. Singapore&#x27;s first two prime ministers, Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong, have publicly declared that Singlish is a substandard variety that handicaps Singaporeans, presents an obstacle to learning standard English, and renders the speaker incomprehensible to everyone except another Singlish speaker. The country&#x27;s third, Lee Hsien Loong, has also said that Singlish should not be part of Singapore&#x27;s identity. In addition, the government launched the Speak Good English Movement in 2000 to encourage Singaporeans to speak proper English.

Despite strong criticisms of Singlish, linguist David Yoong has put forward the argument that &quot;Singaporeans who subscribe to Singlish and have a positive attitude towards the code see Singlish as a language that transcends social barriers&quot; and that the language can be used to &quot;forge rapport and, perhaps more importantly, the Singaporean identity&quot;. Sociolinguist Anthea Fraser Gupta also argues that Singlish and standard English can and do co-exist, saying that &quot;there is no evidence that the presence of Singlish causes damage to standard English&quot;. This was followed by organisers of the Speak Good English Movement clarifying that they are &quot;not anti-Singlish&quot;, with their primary intention instead to ensure that Singaporeans are able to speak standard English first. A spokesperson was quoted as saying: &quot;The presence of Singlish causes damage to standard English only when people do not have a good grounding in standard English&quot;.

== English language trends in Singapore ==
In 2010, speakers of English in Singapore were classified into five different groups: 
# Those who have no knowledge of English (extremely few people, most of whom were born before the 1940s);
# Those who regard English as a foreign language, have limited command of, and seldom speak the language (mostly the older age groups);
# Those who learnt English at school and can use it but have a dominant other language (many people, of all ages);
# Those who learnt English at school and use it as their dominant language (many people, of all ages);
# Those who learnt English as a native language (sometimes as a sole native language, but usually alongside other languages) and use it as their dominant language (many people, mostly children born after 1965 to highly educated parents).

, English is the most commonly spoken language in Singaporean homes. One effect of mass immigration into Singapore since 2000, especially from China, has been an increase in the proportion of the population to whom English is a foreign language. The most recent trend in Singapore favours an increasing use of English as well as stability in the use of Mandarin at the expense of other varieties of Chinese (apparently as the Chinese population switches first to Mandarin, then to English) while the use of Malay slowly erodes.

In 2010, 52% of Chinese children and 26% of Malay children aged between 5 and 14 speak English at home, as compared to 36% and 9.4% respectively in 2000.

== Other official languages in Singapore ==
English is Singapore&#x27;s main and one of the four official languages, along with Malay, Chinese and Tamil. The symbolic national language is Malay for historical reasons. All official signs, legislation and documents are required to be in English, although translations in the other official languages are sometimes included, though it is not necessary. Under the education system, English is the language of instruction for all subjects except the official Mother Tongue languages (the other three official languages) and the literatures of those languages.

<text>Sierra Nevada (; meaning &quot;snow-covered mountain range&quot;) is a mountain range in the Andalusian province of Granada in Spain. It contains the highest point of continental Spain: Mulhacén, at above sea level.

It is a popular tourist destination, as its high peaks make skiing possible in one of Europe&#x27;s most southerly ski resorts, in an area along the Mediterranean Sea predominantly known for its high temperatures and abundant sunshine. At its foothills is found the city of Granada, and a little further south, Almería and Motril.

Parts of the range have been included in the Sierra Nevada National Park. The range has also been declared a biosphere reserve. The Sierra Nevada Observatory, the Calar Alto Observatory, and the IRAM 30m telescope are located on the northern slopes at an elevation of .

==Formation==
Sierra Nevada was formed during the Alpine Orogeny, a mountain-building event that also formed the European Alps to the east and the Atlas Mountains of northern Africa across the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Sierra as observed today formed during the Paleogene and Neogene Periods (66 to 1.8 million years ago) from the collision of the African and Eurasian continental plates.

==Geography==

Central to the mountain range is a ridge running broadly west-south-west - east-north-east. For a substantial distance, the watershed stays consistently above . This is sufficient altitude for the peaks to be consistently snow-covered.

On the southern side of the range, several long, narrow river valleys lead off towards the south-west, separated by a number of subsidiary ridges. On the steeper and craggier northern side, the valleys have less regular orientations. This side is dominated by the Rio Genil which starts near Mulhacén and into which many of the other rivers flow.

Geologically, the range is composed chiefly of soft micaceous schists, sloping steeply to the north, but more gradually to the south and south-east.

=== Highest peaks ===

=== Climate ===
According to the Köppen climate classification, Sierra Nevada has a Mediterranean climate (Csa/Csb), with different variations depending on the altitude. Above the climate is subarctic (Dsc), due to the location&#x27;s high elevation and low summer precipitation. With June and September being around the threshold of in mean temperature to avoid the subarctic classification, the climate at a slightly lower elevation is humid continental (Dsa/Dsb). At an elevation slightly lower than that classification area; where February means average above ; it falls into the normal cool-summer mediterranean classification transitioning with the hot-summer variety in surrounding lowland areas. This renders Sierra Nevada&#x27;s climate a highland cooled-down variety of a typical mediterranean climate. Summer and winter daytime temperatures are some 12 °C lower than found in Granada, differences that are even greater in spring as Sierra Nevada takes longer to approach the short summers. In May daytime highs in Sierra Nevada are around with Granada having an average of . The yearly temperature of at the ski station of Pradollano is in stark contrast to Granada&#x27;s and coastal Málaga&#x27;s .

<text>Presque rien, also titled Almost Nothing in the UK and Come Undone in the US, is a 2000 French-Belgian romantic drama film directed by Sebastien Lifshitz, set in Brittany, depicting a stormy holiday romance between two teenagers and what remains of that relationship eighteen months later.

==Plot==
Upper-middle class Mathieu, is spending his summer vacation on the French coast before beginning studies in the autumn to become an architect. His mother is deeply depressed because of the death of his baby brother from cancer, and is cared for by her sister, while Mathieu and his moody younger sister cannot get along.

Then he meets Cédric at the beach, who is attractive and obviously looking for a boyfriend. The boys embark on a romance, and Mathieu&#x27;s sudden secrecy and long hours away from home invite the curiosity of both his sister and aunt.

A parallel plotline focuses on Mathieu eighteen months later, as he recovers from the shock of their separation. After Mathieu has tried to commit suicide, he chooses to go back to the small seaside town to learn how to deal with what happened.

The film ends on a hopeful note when Mathieu looks up Pierre, another former boyfriend of Cédric&#x27;s living in the seaside town, and they overcome past tensions to discover that they understand each other.

==Cast==
* Jérémie Elkaïm as Mathieu
* Stéphane Rideau as Cédric
* Dominique Reymond as Mother
* Marie Matheron as Annick
* Laetitia Legrix as Sarah
* Nils Ohlund as Pierre

==Production==
Rather than having a clear, chronologically ordered narrative, the movie switches between the &quot;summer&quot; and the &quot;winter&quot; plotlines, depicting the differences in Mathieu&#x27;s life at both points, as well as establishing the contrast between one and the other visually.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack uses songs by Irish singer and songwriter Perry Blake (from his album &quot;Still Life&quot;) to convey Mathieu&#x27;s melancholic, depressive mood.

<doc id="165754" wikidata="Q1429998" url="?curid=165754" title="Pork barrel">
<text>Pork barrel, or simply pork, is a metaphor for the appropriation of government spending for localized projects secured solely or primarily to direct expenditures to a representative&#x27;s district. The usage originated in American English, and it indicates a negotiated way of political particularism.

==Political science==
Scholars use it as a technical term regarding legislative control of local appropriations. In election campaigns, the term is used in derogatory fashion to attack opponents. Typically, &quot;pork&quot; involves national funding for government programs whose economic or service benefits are concentrated in a particular area but whose costs are spread among all taxpayers. Public works projects, certain national defense spending projects, and agricultural subsidies are the most commonly cited examples. Citizens Against Government Waste outlines seven criteria by which spending in the United States can be classified as &quot;pork&quot;:
# Requested by only one chamber of Congress
# Not specifically authorized
# Not competitively awarded
# Not requested by the President
# Greatly exceeds the President&#x27;s budget request or the previous year&#x27;s funding
# Not the subject of Congressional hearings
# Serves only a local or special interest.

==History and etymology==
The term &quot;pork barrel politics&quot; originated in American English, and usually refers to spending intended to benefit constituents of a politician in return for their political support, either in the form of campaign contributions or votes. In the popular 1863 story &quot;The Children of the Public&quot;, Edward Everett Hale used the term &quot;pork barrel&quot; as a homely metaphor for any form of public spending to the citizenry; however, after the American Civil War, the term came to be used in a derogatory sense. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; dates the modern sense of the term to 1910. 

Pork barrels originally came from storing meat. By the 1870s, references to &quot;pork&quot; were common in Congress, and the term was further popularized by a 1919 article by Chester Collins Maxey in the &quot;National Municipal Review&quot;, which reported on certain legislative acts known to members of Congress as &quot;pork barrel bills&quot;. He claimed that the phrase originated in a pre-Civil War practice of giving enslaved people a barrel of salt pork as a reward and requiring them to compete among themselves to get their share of the handout. More generally, a barrel of salt pork was a common larder item in 19th-century households and could be used as a measure of the family&#x27;s financial well-being. For example, in his 1845 novel &quot;The Chainbearer&quot;, James Fenimore Cooper wrote: &quot;I hold a family to be in a desperate way when the mother can see the bottom of the pork barrel.&quot;

==Examples==
An early example of pork barrel politics in the United States was the Bonus Bill of 1817, which was introduced by Democrat John C. Calhoun to construct highways linking the Eastern and Southern United States to its Western frontier using the earnings bonus from the Second Bank of the United States. Calhoun argued for it using general welfare and post-roads clauses of the United States Constitution. Although he approved of the economic development goal, President James Madison vetoed the bill as unconstitutional.

One of the most famous alleged pork-barrel projects was the Big Dig in Boston, Massachusetts. The Big Dig was a project to relocate an existing section of the Interstate Highway System underground. The official planning phase started in 1982; the construction was done between 1991 and 2006, and the project concluded on December 31, 2007. It ended up costing US$14.6 billion, or over US$4 billion per mile. Tip O&#x27;Neill (D-Mass), after whom one of the Big Dig tunnels was named, pushed to have the Big Dig funded by the federal government while he was the speaker of the United States House of Representatives.

During the 2008 United States presidential election campaign, the Gravina Island Bridge (also known as the &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot;) in Alaska was cited as an example of pork barrel spending. The bridge, pushed for by Republican Senator Ted Stevens, was projected to cost $398 million and would connect the island&#x27;s 50 residents and the Ketchikan International Airport to Revillagigedo Island and Ketchikan. Pork-barrel projects, which differ from &quot;earmarks&quot;, are added to the federal budget by members of the appropriation committees of the United States Congress. This allows the delivery of federal funds to the local district or state of the appropriation committee member, often accommodating major campaign contributors. To a certain extent, a member of Congress is judged by their ability to deliver funds to their constituents. The Chairman and the ranking member of the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations are in a position to deliver significant benefits to their states. Researchers Anthony Fowler and Andrew B. Hall claim that this still does not account for the high reelection rates of incumbent representatives in American legislatures. Former Hawaii Senator Daniel Inouye described himself as &quot;the No. 1 earmarks guy in the U.S. Congress&quot;. Inouye regularly passed earmarks for funding in the state of Hawaii including military and transportation spending.

<text>Pearl Comfort Sydenstricker Buck (June 26, 1892 – March 6, 1973) was an American writer and novelist. She is best known for &quot;The Good Earth&quot;, the best-selling novel in the United States in 1931 and 1932 and which won her the Pulitzer Prize in 1932. In 1938, Buck became the first American woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for her rich and truly epic descriptions of peasant life in China&quot; and for her &quot;masterpieces&quot;, two memoir-biographies of her missionary parents.

Buck was born in West Virginia, but in October 1892, her parents took their 4-month-old baby to China. As the daughter of missionaries and later as a missionary herself, Buck spent most of her life before 1934 in Zhenjiang, with her parents, and in Nanjing, with her first husband. She and her parents spent their summers in a villa in Kuling, Mount Lu, Jiujiang, and it was during this annual pilgrimage that the young girl decided to become a writer. She graduated from Randolph-Macon Woman&#x27;s College in Lynchburg, Virginia, then returned to China. From 1914 to 1932, after marrying John Lossing Buck, she served as a Presbyterian missionary, but she came to doubt the need for foreign missions. Her views became controversial during the Fundamentalist–Modernist controversy, leading to her resignation. After returning to the United States in 1935, she married the publisher Richard J. Walsh and continued writing prolifically. She became an activist and prominent advocate of the rights of women and racial equality, and wrote widely on Chinese and Asian cultures, becoming particularly well known for her efforts on behalf of Asian and mixed-race adoption.

== Early life and education ==

Originally named Comfort, Pearl Sydenstricker was born in Hillsboro, West Virginia, to Caroline Maude (Stulting) (1857–1921) and Absalom Sydenstricker, of Dutch and German descent respectively. Her parents, Southern Presbyterian missionaries, were married on July 8, 1880 and moved to China shortly thereafter, but returned to the United States for Pearl&#x27;s birth. When Pearl was five months old, the family returned to China, living first in Huai&#x27;an and then in 1896 moving to Zhenjiang, which was then known as Chingkiang in the Chinese postal romanization system, near the major city of Nanjing. In summer, she and her family spent time in Kuling. Her father built a stone villa in Kuling in 1897, and lived there until his death in 1931. It was during this annual summer pilgrimage in Kuling that the young girl decided to become a writer.

Of her siblings who survived into adulthood, Edgar Sydenstricker had a distinguished career with the U.S. Public Health Service and later the Milbank Memorial Fund, and Grace Sydenstricker Yaukey (1899–1994) wrote young adult books and books about Asia under the pen name Cornelia Spencer.

Pearl recalled in her memoir that she lived in &quot;several worlds&quot;, one a &quot;small, white, clean Presbyterian world of my parents&quot;, and the other the &quot;big, loving merry not-too-clean Chinese world&quot;, and there was no communication between them. The Boxer Uprising (1899–1901) greatly affected the family; their Chinese friends deserted them, and Western visitors decreased. Her father, convinced that no Chinese could wish him harm, stayed behind as the rest of the family went to Shanghai for safety. A few years later, Buck was enrolled in Miss Jewell&#x27;s School in Shanghai, and was dismayed at the racist attitudes there of other students, few of whom could speak any Chinese. Both of her parents felt strongly that Chinese were their equals; they forbade the use of the word &quot;heathen&quot;, and she was raised in a bilingual environment: tutored in English by her mother, in the local dialect by her Chinese playmates, and in classical Chinese by a Chinese scholar named Mr. Kung. She also read voraciously, especially, in spite of her father&#x27;s disapproval, the novels of Charles Dickens, which she later said she read through once a year for the rest of her life.

In 1911, Buck left China to attend Randolph-Macon Woman&#x27;s College in Lynchburg, Virginia, where she graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1914 and was a member of Kappa Delta sorority.

== Career ==
===China===
Although Buck had not intended to return to China, much less become a missionary, she quickly applied to the Presbyterian Board when her father wrote that her mother was seriously ill. In 1914, Buck returned to China. She married an agricultural economist missionary, John Lossing Buck, on May 13, 1917, and they moved to Suzhou, Anhui Province, a small town on the Huai River (not to be confused with the better-known Suzhou in Jiangsu Province). This is the region she describes in her books &quot;The Good Earth&quot; and &quot;Sons&quot;.

From 1920 to 1933, the Bucks made their home in Nanjing, on the campus of the University of Nanking, where they both had teaching positions. She taught English literature at this private, church-run university, and also at Ginling College and at the National Central University. In 1920, the Bucks had a daughter, Carol, who was afflicted with phenylketonuria that left her severely developmentally disabled. Buck had to have a hysterectomy due to complications of Carol&#x27;s birth, leaving her unable to have more biological children. In 1921, Buck&#x27;s mother died of a tropical disease, sprue, and shortly afterward her father moved in. In 1924, they left China for John Buck&#x27;s year of sabbatical and returned to the United States for a short time, during which Pearl Buck earned a master&#x27;s degree from Cornell University. In 1925, the Bucks adopted a child named Janice (later surnamed Walsh). That autumn, they returned to China.

The tragedies and dislocations that Buck suffered in the 1920s reached a climax in March 1927, during the &quot;Nanking Incident&quot;. In a confused battle involving elements of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Nationalist troops, Communist forces, and assorted warlords, several Westerners were murdered. Since her father Absalom insisted, as he had in 1900 in the face of the Boxers, the family decided to stay in Nanjing until the battle reached the city. When violence broke out, a poor Chinese family invited them to hide in their hut while the family house was looted. The family spent a day terrified and in hiding, after which they were rescued by American gunboats. They traveled to Shanghai and then sailed to Japan, where they stayed for a year, after which they moved back to Nanjing. Buck later said that this year in Japan showed her that not all Japanese were militarists. When she returned from Japan in late 1927, Buck devoted herself in earnest to the vocation of writing. Friendly relations with prominent Chinese writers of the time, such as Xu Zhimo and Lin Yutang, encouraged her to think of herself as a professional writer. She wanted to fulfill the ambitions denied to her mother, but she also needed money to support herself if she left her marriage, which had become increasingly lonely. Since the mission board could not provide it, she also needed money for Carol&#x27;s specialized care.

Buck traveled once more to the United States in 1929 to find long-term care for Carol, eventually placing her in the Vineland Training School in New Jersey. Buck served on the Board of Trustees for the school, at which Carol lived for the rest of her life and where she eventually died in 1992 at age 72. While Buck was in the United States, Richard J. Walsh, editor at John Day publishers in New York, accepted her novel &quot;East Wind: West Wind.&quot; She and Walsh began a relationship that would eventually result in marriage and many years of professional teamwork.

Back in Nanking, Buck retreated every morning to the attic of her university house, and within the year, completed the manuscript for &quot;The Good Earth&quot;. She was involved in the charity relief campaign for the victims of the 1931 China floods, writing a series of short stories describing the plight of refugees, which were broadcast on the radio in the United States and later published in her collected volume &quot;The First Wife and Other Stories&quot;.

When her husband took the family to Ithaca, New York the following year, Buck accepted an invitation to address a luncheon of Presbyterian women at the Hotel Astor in New York City. Her talk was titled &quot;Is There a Case for the Foreign Missionary?&quot; and her answer was a barely qualified &quot;no&quot;. She told her American audience that she welcomed Chinese to share her Christian faith, but argued that China did not need an institutional church dominated by missionaries who were too often ignorant of China and arrogant in their attempts to control it. When the talk was published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, the scandalized reaction led Buck to resign her position with the Presbyterian Board. In 1934, Buck left China, believing she would return, while her husband remained.

===United States===
Buck divorced her husband John in Reno, Nevada on June 11, 1935, and she married Richard Walsh that same day. He reportedly offered her advice and affection which, her biographer concludes, &quot;helped make Pearl&#x27;s prodigious activity possible&quot;. The couple moved with Janice to Green Hills Farm in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, which they quickly set about filling with adopted children. Two sons were brought home as infants in 1936 and followed by another son and daughter in 1937.

Following the Communist Revolution in 1949, Buck was repeatedly refused all attempts to return to her beloved China. Her 1962 novel &quot;Satan Never Sleeps&quot; is heavily anti-communist and filled with religious themes, and was adapted into a film in the same year. During the Cultural Revolution, Buck, as a preeminent American writer of Chinese village life, was denounced as an &quot;American cultural imperialist&quot;. Buck was &quot;heartbroken&quot; when she was prevented from visiting China with Richard Nixon in 1972, reportedly due to political interference by Jiang Qing, a prominent figure in the denunciation of Buck.

===Nobel Prize in Literature===
In 1938 the Nobel Prize committee in awarding the prize said:

In her speech to the Academy, Buck took as her topic &quot;The Chinese Novel&quot;. She explained, &quot;I am an American by birth and by ancestry&quot;, but &quot;my earliest knowledge of story, of how to tell and write stories, came to me in China.&quot; After an extensive discussion of classic Chinese novels, especially &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;All Men Are Brothers&quot;, and &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;, she concluded that in China &quot;the novelist did not have the task of creating art but of speaking to the people.&quot; Her own ambition, she continued, had not been trained toward &quot;the beauty of letters or the grace of art.&quot; In China, the task of the novelist differed from the Western artist: &quot;To farmers he must talk of their land, and to old men he must speak of peace, and to old women he must tell of their children, and to young men and women he must speak of each other.&quot; And like the Chinese novelist, she concluded, &quot;I have been taught to want to write for these people. If they are reading their magazines by the million, then I want my stories there rather than in magazines read only by a few.&quot;

===Humanitarian efforts===

Buck was committed to a range of issues that were largely ignored by her generation. Many of her life experiences and political views are described in her novels, short stories, fiction, children&#x27;s stories, and the biographies of her parents entitled &quot;Fighting Angel&quot; (on Absalom) and &quot;The Exile&quot; (on Carrie). She wrote on diverse subjects, including women&#x27;s rights, Asian cultures, immigration, adoption, missionary work, war, the atomic bomb (&quot;Command the Morning&quot;), and violence. Long before it was considered fashionable or politically safe to do so, Buck challenged the American public by raising consciousness on topics such as racism, sex discrimination and the plight of Asian war children. Buck combined the careers of wife, mother, author, editor, international spokesperson, and political activist. Buck became well-known as an advocate for civil rights, women’s rights, and the disability rights.

In 1949, after finding that existing adoption services considered Asian and mixed-race children unadoptable, Buck founded the first permanent foster home for US-born mixed-race children of Asian descent, naming it The Welcome Home. The foster home was located in a 16-room farmhouse in Pennsylvania next door to Buck&#x27;s own home, Green Hill Farm, and Buck was actively involved in everything from planning the children&#x27;s diets to buying their clothing. Among the home&#x27;s Board of Directors were librettist Oscar Hammerstein II and his second wife, interior designer Dorothy, composer Richard Rodgers, seed company tycoon David Burpee and his wife Lois and author James A. Michener. As more and more children were referred to the foster home, however, it quickly became apparent that it couldn&#x27;t accommodate them all and adoptive homes were needed. Welcome Home was turned into the first international, interracial adoption agency, and Buck began actively promoting the adoption of mixed-race children to the American public. In an effort to overcome the longstanding public view that such children were inferior and undesirable, Buck claimed in interviews and speeches that &quot;hybrid&quot; children of interracial backgrounds were actually genetically superior to other children in terms of intelligence and health. She and her husband Richard then adopted two mixed-race daughters from overseas themselves: an Afro-German girl in 1951 and an Afro-Japanese girl in 1957, giving her eight children in total. In 1967 she turned over most of her earnings—more than $7 million— to the adoption agency to help with costs.

Buck established the Pearl S. Buck Foundation (name changed to Pearl S. Buck International in 1999) to &quot;address poverty and discrimination faced by children in Asian countries.&quot; In 1964, she opened the Opportunity Center and Orphanage in South Korea, and later offices were opened in Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam. When establishing Opportunity House, Buck said, &quot;The purpose ... is to publicize and eliminate injustices and prejudices suffered by children, who, because of their birth, are not permitted to enjoy the educational, social, economic and civil privileges normally accorded to children.&quot;In 1960, after a long decline in health that included a series of strokes, Buck&#x27;s husband Richard Walsh died. She renewed a warm relationship with William Ernest Hocking, who died in 1966. Buck then withdrew from many of her old friends and quarreled with others. 

In 1962 Buck asked the Israeli Government for clemency for Adolf Eichmann, the Nazi war criminal who was complicit in the deaths of six million Jews during World War II, as she and others believed that carrying out capital punishment against Eichmann could be seen as an act of vengeance, especially since the war had ended. 

During a December 17, 1962 visit to the Kennedy White House, Buck urged the Kennedy administration to help resolve People&#x27;s Republic of China-Taiwan relations by supporting de facto independence of Taiwan for a 10 to 25 year period with an agreement that afterwards a plebiscite could be held based on a negotiated settlement.

Buck’s ties with her native state remained strong. In the title essay of My Mother’s House, a small book written by Buck and others to help raise funds for the Birthplace Museum, she paid tribute to the house her mother had cherished while living far away: ‘‘For me it was a living heart in the country I knew was my own but which was strange to me until I returned to the house where I was born. In the late 1960s, Buck toured West Virginia to raise money to preserve her family farm in Hillsboro, West Virginia. Today the Pearl S. Buck Birthplace is a historic house museum and cultural center. She hoped the house would &quot;belong to everyone who cares to go there,&quot; and serve as a &quot;gateway to new thoughts and dreams and ways of life.&quot; Former U.S. President George H. W. Bush toured the Pearl S. Buck House in October 1998. He expressed that he, like millions of other Americans, had gained an appreciation for the Chinese people through Buck&#x27;s writing.

==Final years==
In the mid-1960s, Buck increasingly came under the influence of Theodore Harris, a former dance instructor, who became her confidant, co-author, and financial advisor. She soon depended on him for all her daily routines, and placed him in control of Welcome House and the Pearl S. Buck Foundation. Harris, who was given a lifetime salary as head of the foundation, created a scandal for Buck when he was accused of mismanaging the foundation, diverting large amounts of the foundation&#x27;s funds for his friends&#x27; and his own personal expenses, and treating staff poorly. Buck defended Harris, stating that he was &quot;very brilliant, very high strung and artistic.&quot; Before her death, Buck signed over her foreign royalties and her personal possessions to Creativity Inc., a foundation controlled by Harris. 
==Death==
Pearl S. Buck died of lung cancer on March 6, 1973, in Danby, Vermont. 
She was interred on Green Hills Farm in Perkasie, Pennsylvania. She designed her own tombstone. Her name was not inscribed in English on her tombstone. Instead, the grave marker is inscribed with the Chinese characters 賽珍珠 () representing the name Pearl Sydenstricker; specifically, Sai is the sound of the first syllable of her last name (Chinese family names come first), and Zhenzhu is the Chinese word for pearl.

Buck left behind three contradictory wills, resulting in a three-way legal dispute over her estate between her financial advisor Theodore Harris, the nonprofit Pearl Buck Foundation, and her seven adopted children. After a six-year battle, the dispute was settled in her children&#x27;s favor after both Harris and the Pearl Buck Foundation dropped their claims (the latter in return for a financial settlement from Buck&#x27;s children).

== Legacy ==
Many contemporary reviewers praised Buck&#x27;s &quot;beautiful prose&quot;, even though her &quot;style is apt to degenerate into over-repetition and confusion&quot;. Robert Benchley wrote a parody of &quot;The Good Earth&quot; that emphasised these qualities. Peter Conn, in his biography of Buck, argues that despite the accolades awarded to her, Buck&#x27;s contribution to literature has been mostly forgotten or deliberately ignored by America&#x27;s cultural gatekeepers. Kang Liao argues that Buck played a &quot;pioneering role in demythologizing China and the Chinese people in the American mind&quot;. Phyllis Bentley, in an overview of Buck&#x27;s work published in 1935, was altogether impressed: &quot;But we may say at least that for the interest of her chosen material, the sustained high level of her technical skill, and the frequent universality of her conceptions, Mrs. Buck is entitled to take rank as a considerable artist. To read her novels is to gain not merely knowledge of China but wisdom about life.&quot; These works aroused considerable popular sympathy for China, and helped foment a more critical view of Japan and its aggression.

Chinese-American author Anchee Min said she &quot;broke down and sobbed&quot; after reading &quot;The Good Earth&quot; for the first time as an adult, which she had been forbidden to read growing up in China during the Cultural Revolution. Min said Buck portrayed the Chinese peasants &quot;with such love, affection and humanity&quot; and it inspired Min&#x27;s novel &quot;Pearl of China&quot; (2010), a fictional biography about Buck.

In 1973, Buck was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. Buck was honored in 1983 with a 5¢ Great Americans series postage stamp issued by the United States Postal Service In 1999 she was designated a Women&#x27;s History Month Honoree by the National Women&#x27;s History Project.

Buck&#x27;s former residence at Nanjing University is now the Pearl S. Buck Memorial House or in Mandarin 賽珍珠紀念館 () along the West Wall of the university&#x27;s north campus.

Pearl Buck&#x27;s papers and literary manuscripts are currently housed at Pearl S. Buck International and the West Virginia &amp; Regional History Center.

<text>Wissembourg (; South Franconian: &quot;Weisseburch&quot; ; German: &quot;Weißenburg&quot; ) is a commune in the Bas-Rhin department in Grand Est in northeastern France.

Wissembourg was a sub-prefecture of the department until 2015. The name &quot;Wissembourg&quot; is a Gallicized version of &quot;Weißenburg (Weissenburg)&quot; in German meaning &quot;white castle&quot;. The Latin place-name, sometimes used in ecclesiastical sources, is &quot;Sebusium&quot;.

The town was annexed by France after 1648 but then incorporated into Germany in 1871. It was returned to France in 1919, but reincorporated back into Germany in 1940. After 1944 it again became French.

==Geography==
Wissembourg is situated on the little river Lauter close to the border between France and Germany approximately north of Strasbourg and west of Karlsruhe. The Wissembourg station offers rail connections to Strasbourg, Haguenau and Landau (Germany).

==History==

Weissenburg (later Wissembourg) Abbey, the Benedictine abbey around which the town has grown, was founded in the 7th century, perhaps under the patronage of Dagobert I. The abbey was supported by vast territories. Of the 11th-century buildings constructed under the direction of Abbot Samuel, only the and some moats remain. The town was fortified in the 13th century. The abbey church of Saint-Pierre et Paul erected in the same century under the direction of Abbot Edelin was secularized in the French Revolution and despoiled of its treasures; in 1803 it became the parish church, resulting in the largest parish church of Alsace, only exceeded in size by the cathedral of Strasbourg. At the abbey in the late 9th century the monk Otfried composed a gospel harmony, the first substantial work of verse in German.

In 1354 Emperor Charles IV made it one of the grouping of ten towns called the Décapole that survived annexation by France under Louis XIV in 1678 and was extinguished with the French Revolution. On 25 January 1677 a great fire destroyed many houses and the Hôtel de Ville; its replacement dates from 1741 to 1752. Many early structures were spared: the (1448), under its Alsatian pitched roof, was the first hospital of the town. There are many 15th- and 16th-century timber-frame houses, and parts of the walls and gateways of the town. The was the retreat of Stanisław Leszczyński, ex-king of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, from 1719 to 1725, when the formal request arrived on 3 April 1725 asking for the hand of his daughter in marriage to Louis XV. The First Battle of Wissembourg took place near the town in 1793.

The &quot;Lines of Wissembourg&quot; (; ), originally made by Villars in 1706, were famous. They were a line of works extending to Lauterbourg nine miles to the southeast. Like the fortifications of the town, only vestiges remain, although the city wall is still intact for stretches. Austrian General von Wurmser succeeded in briefly capturing the lines in October 1793, but was defeated two months later by General Pichegru of the French Army and forced to retreat, along with the Prussians, across the River Rhine.

Wissembourg formed the setting for the Romantic novel &quot;L&#x27;ami Fritz&quot; (1869) co-written by the team of Erckmann and Chatrian, which provided the material for Mascagni&#x27;s opera &quot;L&#x27;amico Fritz&quot;.

Another Battle of Wissembourg took place on 4 August 1870. It was the first battle of the Franco-Prussian War. The Prussians were nominally commanded by the Crown Prince Frederick, but ably directed by his chief of staff, General Leonhard Graf von Blumenthal. The French defeat allowed the Prussian army to move into France. The Geisberg monument commemorates the battle; the town&#x27;s cemetery holds large numbers of soldiers, including the stately tomb of French general Abel Douay who was killed in combat.

In 1975 the commune of Wissembourg absorbed the former commune of Altenstadt.

<text>Consensus decision-making is a group decision-making process in which participants work together to develop proposals for actions that achieve a broad acceptance. Consensus is reached when everyone in the group (or almost everyone; see &quot;stand aside&quot;) &quot;assents&quot; to a decision; even if some do not fully agree to or support all aspects of it. It differs from simple unanimity, which requires all participants to support a decision. Consensus decision-making in a democracy is consensus democracy.

==Origin and meaning of term==
The word &quot;consensus&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;agreement, accord&quot;, derived from &quot;consentire&quot; meaning &quot;feel together&quot;. A noun, &quot;consensus&quot; can represent a generally accepted opinion – &quot;general agreement or concord; harmony&quot;, &quot;a majority of opinion&quot; – or the outcome of a consensus decision-making process. This article refers to the process &quot;and&quot; the outcome (e.g. &quot;to decide &quot;by&quot; consensus&quot; and &quot;&quot;a&quot; consensus was reached&quot;).

== History ==
Consensus decision-making, as a self-described practice, originates from several nonviolent, direct action groups that were active in the Civil rights, Peace and Women&#x27;s movements in the USA during counterculture of the 1960s. The practice gained popularity in the 1970s through the anti-nuclear movement, and peaked in popularity in the early 1980s. Consensus spread abroad through the anti-globalization and climate movements, and has become normalized in anti-authoritarian spheres in conjunction with affinity groups and ideas of participatory democracy and prefigurative politics. 
The Movement for a New Society (MNS) has been credited for popularizing consensus decision-making. Unhappy with the inactivity of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) against the Vietnam War, Lawrence Scott started A Quaker Action Group (AQAG) in 1966 to try and encourage activism within the Quakers. By 1971 AQAG members felt they needed not only to end the war, but transform civil society as a whole, and renamed AQAG to MNS. MNS members used consensus decision-making from the beginning as a non-religious adaptation of the Quaker decision-making they were used to. MNS trained the anti-nuclear Clamshell Alliance (1976) and Abalone Alliance (1977) to use consensus, and in 1977 published &quot;Resource Manual for a Living Revolution&quot;, which included a section on consensus.

An earlier account of consensus decision-making comes from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the main student organization of the civil rights movement, founded in 1960. Early SNCC member Mary King, later reflected: &quot;we tried to make all decisions by consensus ... it meant discussing a matter and reformulating it until no objections remained&quot;. This way of working was brought to the SNCC at its formation by the Nashville student group, who had received nonviolence training from James Lawson and Myles Horton at the Highlander Folk School. However, as the SNCC faced growing internal and external pressure toward the mid-1960s, it developed into a more hierarchical structure, eventually abandoning consensus.

Women Strike for Peace (WSP) are also accounted as independently used consensus from their founding in 1961. Eleanor Garst (herself influenced by Quakers) introduced the practice as part of the loose and participatory structure of WSP.

As consensus grew in popularity, it became less clear who influenced who. Food Not Bombs, which started in 1980 in connection with an occupation of Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant organized by the Clamshell Alliance, adopted consensus for their organization. Consensus was used in the 1999 Seattle WTO protests, which inspired the S11 (World Economic Forum protest) in 2000 to do so too. Consensus was used at the first Camp for Climate Action (2006) and subsequent camps. Occupy Wall Street (2011) made use of consensus in combination with techniques such as the people&#x27;s microphone and hand signals.

==Objectives==
Characteristics of consensus decision-making include:

*&quot;Collaboration&quot;: Participants contribute to a shared proposal and shape it into a decision that meets the concerns of all group members as much as possible.
*&quot;Cooperation&quot;: Participants in an effective consensus process should strive to reach the best possible decision for the group and all of its members, rather than competing for personal preferences.
*&quot;Egalitarianism&quot;: All members of a consensus decision-making body should be afforded, as much as possible, equal input into the process. All members have the opportunity to present and amend proposals.
*&quot;Inclusion&quot;: As many as possible should be involved in a consensus decision-making process.
*&quot;Participation&quot;: The consensus process should actively solicit the input and participation of all decision-makers.

==Alternative to common decision-making practices==
Consensus decision-making is an alternative to commonly practiced group decision-making processes. &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot;, for instance, is a guide book used by many organizations. This book on Parliamentary Procedure allows the structuring of debate and passage of proposals that can be approved through a form of majority vote. It does not emphasize the goal of full agreement. Critics of such a process believe that it can involve adversarial debate and the formation of competing factions. These dynamics may harm group member relationships and undermine the ability of a group to cooperatively implement a contentious decision. Consensus decision-making attempts to address the beliefs of such problems. Proponents claim that outcomes of the consensus process include:

*Better decisions: Through including the input of all stakeholders the resulting proposals may better address all potential concerns.
*Better implementation: A process that includes and respects all parties, and generates as much agreement as possible sets the stage for greater cooperation in implementing the resulting decisions.
*Better group relationships: A cooperative, collaborative group atmosphere can foster greater group cohesion and interpersonal connection.

== Decision rules ==
Consensus is not synonymous with unanimity – though that may be a rule agreed to in a specific decision-making process. The level of agreement necessary to finalize a decision is known as a decision rule.

Diversity of opinion is normal in most all situations, and will be represented proportionately in an appropriately functioning group.

==Blocking and other forms of dissent==
To ensure the agreement or consent of all participants is valued, many groups choose unanimity or near-unanimity as their decision rule. Groups that require unanimity allow individual participants the option of blocking a group decision. This provision motivates a group to make sure that all group members consent to any new proposal before it is adopted. When there is potential for a block to a group decision, both the group and dissenters in the group are encouraged to collaborate until agreement can be reached. Simply vetoing a decision is not considered a responsible use of consensus blocking. Some common guidelines for the use of consensus blocking include:

*Providing an option for those who do not support a proposal to &quot;stand aside&quot; rather than block.
*Requiring a block from two or more people to put a proposal aside.
*Requiring the blocking party to supply an alternative proposal or a process for generating one.
*Limiting each person&#x27;s option to block consensus to a handful of times in one&#x27;s life.
*Limiting the option of blocking to decisions that are substantial to the mission or operation of the group and not allowing blocking on routine decisions.
*Limiting the allowable rationale for blocking to issues that are fundamental to the group&#x27;s mission or potentially disastrous to the group.

===Dissent options===
A participant who does not support a proposal may have alternatives to simply blocking it. Some common options may include the ability to:
*&quot;Declare reservations&quot;: Group members who are willing to let a motion pass but desire to register their concerns with the group may choose &quot;declare reservations.&quot; If there are significant reservations about a motion, the decision-making body may choose to modify or re-word the proposal.
*&quot;Stand aside&quot;: A &quot;stand aside&quot; may be registered by a group member who has a &quot;serious personal disagreement&quot; with a proposal, but is willing to let the motion pass. Although stand asides do not halt a motion, it is often regarded as a strong &quot;nay vote&quot; and the concerns of group members standing aside are usually addressed by modifications to the proposal. Stand asides may also be registered by users who feel they are incapable of adequately understanding or participating in the proposal.
*&quot;Object&quot;: Any group member may &quot;object&quot; to a proposal. In groups with a unanimity decision rule, a single block is sufficient to stop a proposal. Other decision rules may require more than one objection for a proposal to be blocked or not pass (see previous section, ).

==Process models==
The basic model for achieving consensus as defined by any decision rule involves:
*Collaboratively generating a proposal
*Identifying unsatisfied concerns
*Modifying the proposal to generate as much agreement as possible

All attempts at achieving consensus begin with a good faith attempt at generating full-agreement, regardless of decision rule threshold.

===Spokescouncil===
In the &quot;spokescouncil&quot; model, affinity groups make joint decisions by each designating a speaker and sitting behind that circle of spokespeople, akin to the spokes of a wheel. While speaking rights might be limited to each group&#x27;s designee, the meeting may allot breakout time for the constituent groups to discuss an issue and return to the circle via their spokesperson. In the case of an activist spokescouncil preparing for the A16 Washington D.C. protests in 2000, affinity groups disputed their spokescouncil&#x27;s imposition of nonviolence in their action guidelines. They received the reprieve of letting groups self-organize their protests, and as the city&#x27;s protest was subsequently divided into pie slices, each blockaded by an affinity group&#x27;s choice of protest. Many of the participants learned about the spokescouncil model on the fly by participating in it directly, and came to better understand their planned action by hearing others&#x27; concerns and voicing their own.

=== Modified Borda Count vote ===
In &quot;Designing an All-Inclusive Democracy&quot; (2007), Emerson proposes a consensus oriented approach based on the Modified Borda Count (MBC) voting method. The group first elects, say, three referees or consensors. The debate on the chosen problem is initiated by the facilitator calling for proposals. Every proposed option is accepted if the referees decide it is relevant and conforms with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The referees produce and display a list of these options. The debate proceeds, with queries, comments, criticisms and/or even new options. If the debate fails to come to a verbal consensus, the referees draw up a final list of options - usually between 4 and 6 - to represent the debate. When all agree, the chair calls for a preferential vote, as per the rules for a Modified Borda Count. The referees decide which option, or which composite of the two leading options, is the outcome. If its level of support surpasses a minimum consensus coefficient, it may be adopted.

===Blocking===
Groups that require unanimity commonly use a core set of procedures depicted in this flow chart.

Once an agenda for discussion has been set and, optionally, the ground rules for the meeting have been agreed upon, each item of the agenda is addressed in turn. Typically, each decision arising from an agenda item follows through a simple structure:
*&quot;Discussion of the item&quot;: The item is discussed with the goal of identifying opinions and information on the topic at hand. The general direction of the group and potential proposals for action are often identified during the discussion.
*&quot;Formation of a proposal&quot;: Based on the discussion a formal decision proposal on the issue is presented to the group.
*&quot;Call for consensus&quot;: The facilitator of the decision-making body calls for consensus on the proposal. Each member of the group usually must actively state whether they agree or consent, stand aside, or object, often by using a hand gesture or raising a colored card, to avoid the group interpreting silence or inaction as agreement. The number of objections is counted to determine if this step&#x27;s consent threshold is satisfied. If it is, dissenters are asked to share their concerns with proceeding with the agreement, so that any potential harms can be addressed/minimized. This can happen even if the consent threshold is unanimity, especially if many voters stand aside.
*&quot;Identification and addressing of concerns&quot;: If consensus is not achieved, each dissenter presents his or her concerns on the proposal, potentially starting another round of discussion to address or clarify the concern.
*&quot;Modification of the proposal&quot;: The proposal is amended, re-phrased or ridered in an attempt to address the concerns of the decision-makers. The process then returns to the call for consensus and the cycle is repeated until a satisfactory decision passes the consent threshold for the group.

===Quaker-based model===
Quaker-based consensus is said to be effective because it puts in place a simple, time-tested structure that moves a group towards unity. The Quaker model is intended to allow hearing individual voices while providing a mechanism for dealing with disagreements.

The Quaker model has been adapted by Earlham College for application to secular settings, and can be effectively applied in any consensus decision-making process.

Its process includes:

*Multiple concerns and information are shared until the sense of the group is clear.
*Discussion involves active listening and sharing information.
*Norms limit number of times one asks to speak to ensure that each speaker is fully heard.
*Ideas and solutions belong to the group; no names are recorded.
*Ideally, differences are resolved by discussion. The facilitator (&quot;clerk&quot; or &quot;convenor&quot; in the Quaker model) identifies areas of agreement and names disagreements to push discussion deeper.
*The facilitator articulates the sense of the discussion, asks if there are other concerns, and proposes a &quot;minute&quot; of the decision.
*The group as a whole is responsible for the decision and the decision belongs to the group.
*The facilitator can discern if one who is not uniting with the decision is acting without concern for the group or in selfish interest.
*Ideally, all dissenters&#x27; perspectives are synthesized into the final outcome for a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.
*Should some dissenter&#x27;s perspective not harmonize with the others, that dissenter may &quot;stand aside&quot; to allow the group to proceed, or may opt to &quot;block&quot;. &quot;Standing aside&quot; implies a certain form of silent consent. Some groups allow &quot;blocking&quot; by even a single individual to halt or postpone the entire process.

Key components of Quaker-based consensus include a belief in a common humanity and the ability to decide together. The goal is &quot;unity, not unanimity.&quot; Ensuring that group members speak only once until others are heard encourages a diversity of thought. The facilitator is understood as serving the group rather than acting as person-in-charge. In the Quaker model, as with other consensus decision-making processes, articulating the emerging consensus allows members to be clear on the decision in front of them. As members&#x27; views are taken into account they are likely to support it.

==Roles==
The consensus decision-making process often has several roles designed to make the process run more effectively. Although the name and nature of these roles varies from group to group, the most common are the facilitator, consensor, a timekeeper, an empath and a secretary or notes taker. Not all decision-making bodies use all of these roles, although the facilitator position is almost always filled, and some groups use supplementary roles, such as a Devil&#x27;s advocate or greeter. Some decision-making bodies rotate these roles through the group members in order to build the experience and skills of the participants, and prevent any perceived concentration of power.

The common roles in a consensus meeting are:
*&quot;Facilitator&quot;: As the name implies, the role of the facilitator is to help make the process of reaching a consensus decision easier. Facilitators accept responsibility for moving through the agenda on time; ensuring the group adheres to the mutually agreed-upon mechanics of the consensus process; and, if necessary, suggesting alternate or additional discussion or decision-making techniques, such as go-arounds, break-out groups or role-playing. Some consensus groups use two co-facilitators. Shared facilitation is often adopted to diffuse the perceived power of the facilitator and create a system whereby a co-facilitator can pass off facilitation duties if he or she becomes more personally engaged in a debate.
*&quot;Consensor&quot;: The team of consensors is responsible for accepting those relevant proposals; for displaying an initial list of these options; for drawing up a balanced list of options to represent the entire debate; to analyse the preferences cast in any subsequent ballot; and, if need be, to determine the composite decision from the two most popular options.
*&quot;Timekeeper&quot;: The purpose of the timekeeper is to ensure the decision-making body keeps to the schedule set in the agenda. Effective timekeepers use a variety of techniques to ensure the meeting runs on time including: giving frequent time updates, ample warning of short time, and keeping individual speakers from taking an excessive amount of time.
*&quot;Empath&quot; or &quot;vibe watch&quot;: The empath, or &#x27;vibe watch&#x27; as the position is sometimes called, is charged with monitoring the &#x27;emotional climate&#x27; of the meeting, taking note of the body language and other non-verbal cues of the participants. Defusing potential emotional conflicts, maintaining a climate free of intimidation and being aware of potentially destructive power dynamics, such as sexism or racism within the decision-making body, are the primary responsibilities of the empath.
*&quot;Note taker&quot;: The role of the notes taker or secretary is to document the decisions, discussion and action points of the decision-making body.

==Tools and methods==

* Some consensus decision-making bodies use a system of colored cards to indicate speaker priority. For instance, red cards to indicate feedback on a breach in rules or decorum, yellow cards for clarifying questions, and green cards for desire to speak.
* Hand signals are another method for reading a room&#x27;s positions nonverbally. They work well with groups of fewer than 250 people and especially with multi-lingual groups. The nature and meaning of individual gestures varies between groups, but a widely adopted core set of hand signals include: wiggling of the fingers on both hands, a gesture sometimes referred to as &quot;twinkling&quot;, to indicate agreement; raising a fist or crossing both forearms with hands in fists to indicate a block or strong disagreement; and making a &quot;T&quot; shape with both hands, the &quot;time out&quot; gesture, to call attention to a point of process or order. One common set of hand signals is called the &quot;Fist-to-Five&quot; or &quot;Fist-of-Five&quot;. In this method each member of the group can hold up a fist to indicate blocking consensus, one finger to suggest changes, two fingers to discuss minor issues, three fingers to indicate willingness to let issue pass without further discussion, four fingers to affirm the decision as a good idea, and five fingers to volunteer to take a lead in implementing the decision. A similar set of hand signals are used by the Occupy Wall Street protesters in their group negotiations.
* First-past-the-post is used as a &quot;fall-back method&quot; when consensus cannot be reached within a given time frame. If the potential outcome of the fall-back method can be anticipated, then those who support that outcome have incentives to block consensus so that the fall-back method gets applied. Special fall-back methods have been developed that reduce this incentive.

==Criticism==
===Criticism of blocking===
Critics of consensus blocking often observe that the option, while potentially effective for small groups of motivated or trained individuals with a sufficiently high degree of affinity, has a number of possible shortcomings, notably
*&quot;Preservation of the status quo&quot;: In decision-making bodies that use formal consensus, the ability of individuals or small minorities to block agreement gives an enormous advantage to anyone who supports the existing state of affairs. This can mean that a specific state of affairs can continue to exist in an organization long after a majority of members would like it to change.
*&quot;Susceptibility to widespread disagreement&quot;: Giving the right to block proposals to all group members may result in the group becoming hostage to an inflexible minority or individual. When a popular proposal is blocked the group actually experiences widespread disagreement, the opposite of the consensus process&#x27;s goal. Furthermore, &quot;opposing such obstructive behavior [can be] construed as an attack on freedom of speech and in turn [harden] resolve on the part of the individual to defend his or her position.&quot; As a result, consensus decision-making has the potential to reward the least accommodating group members while punishing the most accommodating.
*&quot;Stagnation and group dysfunction&quot;: When groups cannot make the decisions necessary to function (because they cannot resolve blocks), they may lose effectiveness in accomplishing their mission.
*&quot;Susceptibility to splitting and excluding members&quot;: When high levels of group member frustration result from blocked decisions or inordinately long meetings, members may leave the group, try to get to others to leave, or limit who has entry to the group.
*&quot;Channeling decisions away from an inclusive group process&quot;: When group members view the status quo as unjustly difficult to change through a whole group process, they may begin to delegate decision-making to smaller committees or to an executive committee. In some cases members begin to act unilaterally because they are frustrated with a stagnated group process.

===Groupthink===
Consensus seeks to improve solidarity in the long run. Accordingly, it should not be confused with unanimity in the immediate situation, which is often a symptom of groupthink. Studies of effective consensus process usually indicate a shunning of unanimity or &quot;illusion of unanimity&quot; that does not hold up as a group comes under real-world pressure (when dissent reappears). Cory Doctorow, Ralph Nader and other proponents of deliberative democracy or judicial-like methods view explicit dissent as a symbol of strength.

In his book about Wikipedia, Joseph Reagle considers the merits and challenges of consensus in open and online communities. Randy Schutt, Starhawk and other practitioners of direct action focus on the hazards of apparent agreement followed by action in which group splits become dangerously obvious.

Unanimous, or apparently unanimous, decisions can have drawbacks. They may be symptoms of a systemic bias, a rigged process (where an agenda is not published in advance or changed when it becomes clear who is present to consent), fear of speaking one&#x27;s mind, a lack of creativity (to suggest alternatives) or even a lack of courage (to go further along the same road to a more extreme solution that would not achieve unanimous consent).

Unanimity is achieved when the full group apparently consents to a decision. It has disadvantages insofar as further disagreement, improvements or better ideas then remain hidden, but effectively ends the debate moving it to an implementation phase. Some consider all unanimity a form of groupthink, and some experts propose &quot;coding systems ... for detecting the illusion of unanimity symptom&quot;. In &quot;Consensus is not Unanimity&quot;, long-time progressive change activist Randy Schutt writes:

Confusion between unanimity and consensus, in other words, usually causes consensus decision-making to fail, and the group then either reverts to majority or supermajority rule or disbands.

Most robust models of consensus exclude uniformly unanimous decisions and require at least documentation of minority concerns. Some state clearly that unanimity is not consensus but rather evidence of intimidation, lack of imagination, lack of courage, failure to include all voices, or deliberate exclusion of the contrary views.

===Criticism of majority voting processes===
Some proponents of consensus decision-making view procedures that use majority rule as undesirable for several reasons. Majority voting is regarded as competitive, rather than cooperative, framing decision-making in a win/lose dichotomy that ignores the possibility of compromise or other mutually beneficial solutions. Carlos Santiago Nino, on the other hand, has argued that majority rule leads to better deliberation practice than the alternatives, because it requires each member of the group to make arguments that appeal to at least half the participants.

Some advocates of consensus would assert that a majority decision reduces the commitment of each individual decision-maker to the decision. Members of a minority position may feel less commitment to a majority decision, and even majority voters who may have taken their positions along party or bloc lines may have a sense of reduced responsibility for the ultimate decision. The result of this reduced commitment, according to many consensus proponents, is potentially less willingness to defend or act upon the decision.

Majority voting cannot measure consensus. Indeed,—so many &#x27;for&#x27; and so many &#x27;against&#x27;—it measures the very opposite, the degree of dissent. The Modified Borda Count has been put forward as a voting method which better approximates consensus.

===Additional critical perspectives===
Some formal models based on graph theory attempt to explore the implications of suppressed dissent and subsequent sabotage of the group as it takes action.

High-stakes decision-making, such as judicial decisions of appeals courts, always require some such explicit documentation. Consent however is still observed that defies factional explanations. Nearly 40% of the decisions of the United States Supreme Court, for example, are unanimous, though often for widely varying reasons. &quot;Consensus in Supreme Court voting, particularly the extreme consensus of unanimity, has often puzzled Court observers who adhere to ideological accounts of judicial decision making.&quot; Historical evidence is mixed on whether particular Justices&#x27; views were suppressed in favour of public unity.

Heitzig and Simmons (2012) suggest using random selection as a fall-back method to strategically incentivize consensus over blocking. However, this makes it very difficult to tell the difference between those who support the decision and those who merely tactically tolerate it for the incentive. Once they receive that incentive, they may undermine or refuse to implement the agreement in various and non-obvious ways. In general voting systems avoid allowing offering incentives (or &quot;bribes&quot;) to change a heartfelt vote.

In the Abilene paradox, a group can unanimously agree on a course of action that no individual member of the group desires because no one individual is willing to go against the perceived will of the decision-making body.

Since consensus decision-making focuses on discussion and seeks the input of all participants, it can be a time-consuming process. This is a potential liability in situations where decisions must be made speedily, or where it is not possible to canvass opinions of all delegates in a reasonable time. Additionally, the time commitment required to engage in the consensus decision-making process can sometimes act as a barrier to participation for individuals unable or unwilling to make the commitment. However, once a decision has been reached it can be acted on more quickly than a decision handed down. American businessmen complained that in negotiations with a Japanese company, they had to discuss the idea with everyone even the janitor, yet once a decision was made the Americans found the Japanese were able to act much quicker because everyone was on board, while the Americans had to struggle with internal opposition.

== Similar practices ==
Outside of Western culture, multiple other cultures have used consensus decision-making. One early example is the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederacy Grand Council, which used a 75% supermajority to finalize its decisions, potentially as early as 1142. In the Xulu and Xhosa (South African) process of indaba, community leaders gather to listen to the public and negotiate figurative thresholds towards an acceptable compromise. The technique was also used during the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference. In Aceh and Nias cultures (Indonesian), family and regional disputes, from playground fights to estate inheritance, are handled through a &quot;musyawarah&quot; consensus-building process in which parties mediate to find peace and avoid future hostility and revenge. The resulting agreements are expected to be followed, and range from advice and warnings to compensation and exile.

The origins of formal consensus-making can be traced significantly further back, to the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, who adopted the technique as early as the 17th century. Anabaptists, including some Mennonites, have a history of using consensus decision-making and some believe Anabaptists practiced consensus as early as the Martyrs&#x27; Synod of 1527. Some Christians trace consensus decision-making back to the Bible. The Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia references, in particular, Acts 15 as an example of consensus in the New Testament. The lack of legitimate consensus process in the unanimous conviction of Jesus by corrupt priests in an illegally held Sanhedrin court (which had rules preventing unanimous conviction in a hurried process) strongly influenced the views of pacifist Protestants, including the Anabaptists (Mennonites/Amish), Quakers and Shakers. In particular it influenced their distrust of expert-led courtrooms and to &quot;be clear about process&quot; and convene in a way that assures that &quot;everyone must be heard&quot;.

The Modified Borda Count voting method has been advocated as more &#x27;consensual&#x27; than majority voting, by, among others, by Ramón Llull in 1199, by Nicholas Cusanus in 1435, by Jean-Charles de Borda in 1784, by Hother Hage in 1860, by Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) in 1884, and by Peter Emerson in 1986.

===Japanese business===
Japanese companies normally use consensus decision-making, meaning that unanimous support on the board of directors is sought for any decision. A &quot;ringi-sho&quot; is a circulation document used to obtain agreement. It must first be signed by the lowest level manager, and then upwards, and may need to be revised and the process started over.

===IETF rough consensus model===
In the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), decisions are assumed to be taken by &quot;rough consensus&quot;. The IETF has studiously refrained from defining a mechanical method for verifying such consensus, apparently in the belief that any such codification leads to attempts to &quot;game the system.&quot; Instead, a working group (WG) chair or BoF chair is supposed to articulate the &quot;sense of the group.&quot;

One tradition in support of rough consensus is the tradition of humming rather than (countable) hand-raising; this allows a group to quickly discern the prevalence of dissent, without making it easy to slip into majority rule.

Much of the business of the IETF is carried out on mailing lists, where all parties can speak their views at all times.

===Social constructivism model===
In 2001, Robert Rocco Cottone published a consensus-based model of professional decision-making for counselors and psychologists. Based on social constructivist philosophy, the model operates as a consensus-building model, as the clinician addresses ethical conflicts through a process of negotiating to consensus. Conflicts are resolved by consensually agreed on arbitrators who are selected early in the negotiation process.

===US Bureau of Land Management collaborative stakeholder engagement===
The United States Bureau of Land Management&#x27;s policy is to seek to use collaborative stakeholder engagement as standard operating practice for natural resources projects, plans, and decision-making except under unusual conditions such as when constrained by law, regulation, or other mandates or when conventional processes are important for establishing new, or reaffirming existing, precedent.

===Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===
The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth of 1569–1795 used consensus decision-making in the form of &quot;liberum veto&quot; (&#x27;free veto&#x27;) in its Sejms (legislative assemblies). A type of unanimous consent, the &quot;liberum veto&quot; originally allowed any member of a Sejm to veto an individual law by shouting &quot;Sisto activitatem!&quot; (Latin: &quot;I stop the activity!&quot;) or &quot;Nie pozwalam!&quot; (Polish: &quot;I do not allow!&quot;). Over time it developed into a much more extreme form, where any Sejm member could unilaterally and immediately force the end of the current session and nullify any previously passed legislation from that session. Due to excessive use and sabotage from neighboring powers bribing Sejm members, legislating became very difficult and weakened the Commonwealth. Soon after the Commonwealth banned &quot;liberum veto&quot; as part of its Constitution of 3 May 1791, it dissolved under pressure from neighboring powers.

===Sociocracy===
Sociocracy has many of the same aims as consensus and is in applied in a similar range of situations. It is slightly different in that broad support for a proposal is defined as the lack of disagreement (sometimes called &#x27;reasoned objection&#x27;) rather than affirmative agreement. To reflect this difference from the common understanding of the word consensus, in Sociocracy the process is called gaining &#x27;consent&#x27; (not consensus).

<doc id="165762" wikidata="Q1424757" url="?curid=165762" title="Mark Jonathan Harris">
<text>Mark Jonathan Harris (born October 28, 1941) is an American documentary filmmaker, writer, and educator known for his award-winning work in the documentary genre. Over the course of his career, Harris has earned three Academy Awards and numerous accolades for his contributions to filmmaking and education. He served as a distinguished professor and head of advanced documentary production at the USC School of Cinematic Arts, where he taught from 1983 until his retirement in 2023. Harris is also an accomplished author, having written five children&#x27;s novels and a collection of short stories.

== Early life and education ==
Mark Jonathan Harris was born on October 28, 1941, in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He attended Harvard University, where he completed his education before pursuing a career in documentary film making.

== Career in filmmaking ==
Harris began his career in documentary filmmaking in the late 1960s. His first major success came with &quot;Huelga!&quot; (1967), a documentary about Cesar Chavez and the groundbreaking farmworkers strike in Delano, California. He followed this with &quot;The Redwoods&quot; (1968), a film he wrote and co-produced for the Sierra Club to help establish a Redwoods National Park and which won an Academy Award for Best Short Documentary. He gained international recognition for &quot;The Long Way Home&quot; (1997), a feature-length documentary on the aftermath of the Holocaust, which won the Academy Award for Best Feature Documentary.

In 2000, Harris wrote and directed &quot;Into the Arms of Strangers: Stories of the Kindertransport&quot;, a documentary chronicling the British rescue mission that saved 10,000 Jewish children during World War II. The film received critical acclaim and won the Academy Award for Best Feature Documentary. It was later selected by the U.S. Library of Congress for permanent preservation in the National Film Registry.

Harris continued to focus on socially and politically significant issues in his work. He co-wrote and co-directed &quot;Breaking Point: The War for Democracy in Ukraine&quot; (2016), a film about the Ukrainian fight for independence, which garnered multiple awards at international film festivals. His HBO documentary &quot;Foster&quot; (2019), which examined the foster care system in Los Angeles, was nominated for Best Documentary Screenplay by the Writers Guild of America.

=== Recent projects ===
In recent years, Harris has returned to making films centered on contemporary social and political issues. His projects include &quot;Darfur Now&quot; (2007), a documentary about the genocide in Darfur, which received the NAACP Image Award, and &quot;Living in Emergency: Stories of Doctors Without Borders&quot; (2008), which focuses on the medical humanitarian organization and was shortlisted for the Oscar for Best Feature Documentary. &quot;Women of the Gulag (2018)&quot;, a film he executive produced, was also shortlisted by the Academy for Best Short Documentary.  Harris also served as Consulting Producer for the PBS series &quot;Asian Americans&quot; (2021), which won a Peabody Award.

=== Literary work ===
Harris has written five children&#x27;s novels, which have won numerous awards, including the FOCAL Award for best children’s book about California for &quot;Come the Morning&quot; (1989).  He is also co-author of the book version of &quot;Into the Arms of Strangers&quot;.  In addition to his work in children&#x27;s literature, Harris has published short stories and articles in various national newspapers and magazines. His most recent literary work, &quot;Misfits&quot; , a collection of short stories, was published in 2023  and was an Editor’s Choice of Publishers Weekly BookLife.

=== Academic career ===
Harris was a faculty member at the USC School of Cinematic Arts for 40 years, teaching courses in documentary filmmaking and screenwriting. From 2012 to 2023, he also served as co-principal investigator of the American Film Showcase, the flagship film and TV diplomacy program of the U.S State Department.  In 2023, he was named Emeritus Distinguished Professor in recognition of his contributions to the university.

<doc id="165763" wikidata="Q837249" url="?curid=165763" title="Marble sculpture">
<text>Marble has been the preferred material for stone monumental sculpture since ancient times, with several advantages over its more common geological &quot;parent&quot; limestone, in particular the ability to absorb light a small distance into the surface before refracting it in subsurface scattering. This gives an attractive soft appearance which is especially good for representing human skin, and which can also be polished.

Of the many different types of marble the pure white ones are generally used for sculpture, with coloured ones preferred for many architectural and decorative uses. The degree of hardness is right to carve without too much difficulty, but still give a very durable result, if not exposed to acid rain or seawater.

Famous individual types and quarries include from classical times Parian marble from Paros, used for the &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; and many other Ancient Greek sculptures, and Pentelic marble, from near Athens, used for most of the Parthenon sculptures, and by the Romans. Carrara marble from northern Italy was used by the Romans, and very extensively up to recent decades, when the pure white &quot;statuario&quot; grade more or less ran out. This was used by Michelangelo and other Renaissance sculptors, and later exported, including to America.

==Material origin and qualities==

Marble is a metamorphic rock derived from limestone, composed mostly of calcite (a crystalline form of calcium carbonate, CaCO3). The original source of the parent limestone is the seabed deposition of calcium carbonate in the form of microscopic animal skeletons or similar materials. Marble is formed when the limestone is transformed by heat and pressure after being overlain by other materials. The finest marbles for sculpture have no or few stains, though natural stains can be incorporated into the work itself.

===Advantages===
Among the commonly available stones, only marble has a slight translucency i.e. subsurface scattering that is comparable to that of human skin. It is this translucency that gives a marble sculpture a visual depth beyond its surface and this evokes a certain realism when used for figurative works. Some types of marble also have the advantage that, when first quarried, it is relatively soft and easy to work, refine, and polish. As the finished marble ages, it becomes harder and more durable. Preference to the cheaper and less translucent limestone is based largely on the fineness of marble&#x27;s grain, which enables the sculptor to render minute detail in a manner not always possible with limestone. In contrast to limestone, marble is also extremely weather-resistant. As a result, surface changes due to the immediate environment are not always visible to the naked eye. This feature can pose challenges when dating ancient works.

===Disadvantages===
Marble sculptors must be careful when handling their materials, as the stone can absorb skin oils and develop yellow or brown stains. While more resistant than limestone it is subject to attack by weak acids, and so performs poorly in outdoor environments subject to acid rain. For severe environments, granite is a more lasting material but one which is far more difficult to work and much less suitable for refined works. Compared to metals such as bronze, furthermore, marble is inflexible and vulnerable to fracturing. This drawback means that sculptors must incorporate specific supporting features into the sculpture to prevent collapse. In Thomas Ridgeway Gould&#x27;s &quot;The West Wind,&quot; for example, he poised the figure&#x27;s short and slender ankles delicately upon the balls of her small feet. This would not be possible without the deliberate decision by Gould to distribute almost all of the marble&#x27;s weight to her massive, flowing skirt. Unlike bronze sculpture, this statue is not hollow; her drapery is one solid block of marble.

==Developing a sculpture==
Sculptors usually begin by knocking off, or &quot;pitching,&quot; large portions of unwanted stone. A suitable tool for this task is a point chisel, which is a long, hefty piece of steel with a point at one end and a broad striking surface at the other. A pitching tool may also be used at this early stage, which is a wedge-shaped chisel with a broad, flat edge. The pitching tool is useful for splitting the stone and removing large, unwanted chunks.

The sculptor may also use a mallet, which is similar to a hammer with a broad, barrel-shaped head. When the mallet connects to the tool, energy is transferred through the tool, shattering the stone. Most sculptors work rhythmically, turning the tool with each blow so that the stone is removed quickly and evenly. This is the &quot;roughing out&quot; stage of the sculpting process. While a mallet provides the force needed to fracture the marble, it must be used accurately. The smallest miscalculation can ruin the intended sculpture and even injure the sculptor.

Some artists prefer to carve directly onto the stone, without a model; the Renaissance artist Michelangelo, for example, claimed that his job was to free the human form trapped inside the block. Other artists sculpt a preliminary model out of clay or wax and then translate its features to stone through the use of calipers or a pointing machine.

Once the general shape of the statue has been determined, the sculptor uses other tools to refine the figure. A toothed chisel or claw chisel has multiple gouging surfaces which create parallel lines in the stone. These tools are generally used to add texture to the figure. An artist might mark out specific lines by using calipers to measure an area of stone to be addressed and marking the removal area with pencil, charcoal or chalk. The stone carver generally uses a shallower stroke at this point in the process.

Eventually, the sculptor has changed the stone from a rough block into the general shape of the finished statue. Tools called rasps and rifflers are then used to enhance the shape into its final form. A rasp is a flat, steel tool with a coarse surface. The sculptor uses broad, sweeping strokes to remove excess stone as small chips or dust. A riffler is a smaller variation of the rasp, which can be used to create details such as folds of clothing or locks of hair.

Polishing is the last step of the carving process. Sculptors use a variety of fine, abrasive materials such as sandpaper or emery paper to highlight patterns in the stone and to accentuate its natural sheen. Some sculptors may also use tin oxide to achieve a high-lustre polish. Regardless of the method, however, a glossy marble sculpture will appear more translucent than one that has not been polished.

==Tools==

The Italian terms for the basic carving tools of stone sculpture are given here, and where possible the English terms have been included.

*La Mazza – The mallet. This is used to strike the chisel.
*Gli Scalpelli – The chisels. These come in various types:
**La Subbia – (the Point) a pointed chisel or punch
**L&#x27;Unghietto – (Round or Rondel Chisel) Literally, &quot;little fingernail&quot;
**La Gradina – (Toothed Chisel or Claw) a chisel with multiple teeth-
**Lo Scalpello – a flat chisel
*Lo Scapezzatore – (Pitcher or Pitching Tool) a hefty chisel with a broad blunt edge, for splitting.
*Il Martello Pneumatico – Pneumatic hammer
*Il Flessibile – an angle grinder, fitted with an electrolysis-applied diamond studded blade
*Hand Drill
In addition to those hand tools listed above, the marble sculptor uses a variety of hammers – both for the striking of edge tools (chisels and hand drills) and for striking the stone directly (Bocciarda a Martello in Italian, Boucharde in French, Bush Hammer in English). Following the work of the hammer and chisel, the sculptor will sometimes refine the form further through the use of rasps, files and abrasive rubbing stones and/or sandpaper to smooth the surface contours of the form.

==Tool technique==

Hammer and point work is the technique used in working stone, in use at least since Roman times, as it is described in the legend of Pygmalion, and even earlier, the ancient Greek sculptors used it from . It consists of holding the pointed chisel against the stone and swinging the hammer at it as hard as possible. When the hammer connects with the striking end of the chisel, its energy is transferred down the length and concentrates on a single point on the surface of the block, breaking the stone. This is continued in a line following the desired contour. It may sound simple but many months are required to attain competency. A good stone worker can maintain a rhythm of relatively longer blows (about one per second), swinging the hammer in a wider arc, lifting the chisel between blows to flick out any chips that remain in the way, and repositioning it for the next blow. This way, one can drive the point deeper into the stone and remove more material at a time. Some stoneworkers also spin the subbia in their fingers between hammer blows, thus applying with each blow a different part of the point to the stone. This helps prevent the point from breaking.

== Automation and robotic carving techniques ==
Some contemporary sculptors use advanced robots and automation software to help them create carved works in marble. A 2021 &quot;New York Times&quot; article describes how robots like ABB2, a 13-foot zinc-alloy robotic arm located in Carrara, Italy, mill marble slabs to fit designs created by artists from the United States, Great Britain, and elsewhere.

Artists often blend robotic carving with hand carving. The process begins with digital files artists create to guide their robotic carving systems. “The data drives computer-controlled, stone-carving machines that use diamond and carbide bits that slowly mill away a rough version of the sculpture,” described New York sculptor Barry X Ball in a 2020 interview. “Then, we take it from there.” Ball&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Sleeping Hermaphrodite&quot; required 10,000 hours of hand-sculpting after the initial robot sculpting phase was completed.

While some artists and scholars criticize the use of robot technology in marble sculpture, others see it as a natural evolution of the classical tradition. In a 2021 article, art historian Marco Ciampolini stated that many of history&#x27;s greatest artists, including Michelangelo, delegated work to apprentices, and that the only difference between that practice and the use of digital automation is the fact that modern-day helpers are robots, rather than humans.

<text>A towel () is a piece of absorbent cloth or paper used for drying or wiping a surface. Towels draw moisture through direct contact.
Bathing towels and hand towels are usually made of cotton, linen, bamboo and synthetic microfibers.

In households, several types of towels are used, such as hand towels, bath towels, and kitchen towels.

Paper towels are provided in commercial or office bathrooms via a dispenser for users to dry their hands. They are also used for such duties such as wiping, cleaning, and drying.

==History==
According to Middle Ages archaeological studies, &quot;... closely held personal items included the ever present knife and a towel.&quot; However, the invention of the towel is commonly associated with the city of Bursa, Turkey, in the 17th century. These Turkish towels began as a flat, woven piece of cotton or linen called a &quot;peshtamal&quot;, often hand-embroidered. Long enough to wrap around the body, peshtamal were originally fairly narrow, but are now wider and commonly measure . Peshtamel were used in Turkish baths as they stayed light when wet and were very absorbent.

As the Ottoman Empire grew, so did the use of the towel. Weavers were asked to embroider more elaborate designs, aided by their knowledge of carpet-weaving. By the 18th century, towels began to feature loops sticking up from the pile of the material. These looped towels became known as &quot;havly&quot;; over time, this word has changed to &quot;havlu&quot;, the Turkish word for towel, and means &#x27;with loops&#x27;.

Towels did not become affordable until the 19th century, with the cotton trade and industrialization. With mechanization, cotton terry-towelling became available by the yard as well as being stocked in shops as pre-made towels. Today, towels come in a variety of sizes, materials and designs.

==Types==

* A &quot;bath towel&quot; is used for drying the body when it is wet, such as after bathing or showering. It is typically rectangular, with a typical size around , and is made of terrycloth.
* A &quot;beach towel&quot; is usually somewhat larger than a bath towel, and often has a colorful pattern. Although often used for drying off after being in the water, its main purpose is to provide a surface on which to lay down. They are also worn for privacy while changing clothes in a public area, and for wiping sand from the body or objects.
* A &quot;bath sheet&quot; (or &quot;sheet towel&quot;) is larger than a bath towel. The classic bath sheet size is 80×160 cm. A large bath sheet that can wrap the entire body is 100×150 cm or 90×160 cm. They are used after bathing, in saunas, on beaches, and for massage.
* A &quot;foot towel&quot; is a small, rectangular towel that, in the absence of a rug, carpet or bathroom mat, is placed on the bathroom floor to stand on after finishing a shower or bath.
* A &quot;hand towel&quot; is significantly smaller than a bath towel (perhaps ), and is used for drying the hands after washing them.
* An &quot;oven towel&quot; or &quot;confectioner&#x27;s mitten&quot; is a multipurpose household towel used for a kitchen or shop applications.
* A &quot;paper towel&quot; is a piece of paper that can be used once as a towel and then be disposed of. A perforated roll of paper towels is usually mounted on a rod slightly longer than the width of the roll, or in an alternative type of hanger that has protrusions on ears, the protrusions fitting into the ends of the paper towel roll. Paper towels might also be packaged as facial tissues are (as individual folded sheets).
* A &quot;disposable towel&quot; (or non-woven towel) is a towel intended for a single user, but not necessarily for a single use, as it can be reused but not washed. It is often made of non-woven fibres and often is used in hospitals, hotels, geriatric and salon or beauty settings, for their hygienic properties.
* A &quot;show towel&quot; is a bath or hand towel with a trim (such as satin, lace or linen) stitched onto it, or embroidery done on it—mostly for visual appeal. These types of towels are used to add a decorative touch, most commonly in the United States. They are generally not to be used for drying, as regular washing ruins the added trim, and the towels usually shrink differently than the trim.
* A &quot;sports towel&quot; is a synthetic or semi-synthetic towel originally developed for swimmers and divers, favoured for its super-absorbent qualities. Sports towels can be wrung out when saturated, leaving the towel able to absorb water again, though not dry. These qualities, along with their compact nature, have further popularized sports towels among general outdoor and athletic enthusiasts. The absorbent material in sports towels may be composed of viscose, PVA or microfiber, with polyester woven in for durability. Some manufacturers incorporate a silver ion or compound treatment into their towels to better inhibit microbial growth and associated odors.
* The term &quot;kitchen towel&quot; refers to a dish towel in American English (called a &quot;tea towel&quot; in UK and Canadian English), and to a paper towel in British English.
* A &quot;tea towel&quot; or &quot;tea cloth&quot; (UK and Canadian English), called &quot;dishtowel&quot; or &quot;dish towel&quot; in America, is an absorbent towel made from soft, lint-free linen. They are used in the kitchen to dry dishes, cutlery, etc. after they are washed. The towels are also used during tea time. They can be wrapped around the tea pot to keep the tea warm, prevent drips, and keep one&#x27;s hand from being burned by the hot tea pot handle when serving the tea. They are commonly made of cotton rather than linen. They are also used for drying glassware, but sometimes a special glass cloth is used for that purpose. Tea towels originated in 18th-century England.
* A &quot;tenugui&quot; is a variety of hand towel that originates from Japan. It is most often used in the same way as a tea towel or flannel (washcloth), but can also be used for decoration, as a headband, or for wrapping bottles and other items to be given as gifts.
* A &quot;cloth towel dispenser&quot; or &quot;continuous cloth towel&quot; is a towel manipulated by a series of rollers, used as an alternative to paper towels and hand dryers in public washrooms. These may have a lower environmental impact than paper towels, though concerns over hygiene mean they are not used by some organisations and have greatly declined in popularity.
* A &quot;bar towel&quot; is an absorbent, usually small, towel used in bars and often given away free as promotional items.
* A &quot;fingertip towel&quot; or &quot;finger towel&quot; is a small towel that is folded and placed next to the sink or in the guest bedroom. Hosts often pin a note to these towels indicating that they are for guest use.
* A &quot;golf towel&quot; is a small towel which usually comes with a loop or clip to attach to a golf bag for drying hands, golfballs, and clubs.
* A &quot;baby towel&quot; is a smaller towel with an extra sewn-on hood at one corner to cover a baby&#x27;s head.
* A &quot;peshtemal&quot; (or pestemal) is a unique multipurpose towel from Anatolia.
* A &quot;poncho towel&quot; is a wearable towel made for drying off and changing, often used poolside, at the beach or after swimming. 
* A &quot;fouta towel&quot; is a Tunisian hammam and beach towel, which is also used as a pareo.

==In fiction==

In Douglas Adam&#x27;s book The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy, there is an in-world emphasis on towels and their importance to hitchhikers, because if a hitchhiker has a towel it can be inferred by a non-hitchhiker that they also have a toothbrush, soap, washcloth, raincoat, and related things, and would be happy to lend the hitchhiker any of those items if they have &quot;lost&quot; them.

<text>Beautiful Thing is a 1993 British play written by Jonathan Harvey. A 
screen adaptation of the play was released in 1996 by Channel 4 Films, with a revised screenplay also by Harvey.

==Plot of the Screen Version==
The story is set in Thamesmead, a working class area of South East London dominated by post-war council estates.

Jamie, a teen who is infatuated with his classmate, Steve, has to deal with his single mother Sandra, who is preoccupied with ambitious plans to run her own pub and with an ever-changing string of lovers, the latest of whom is Tony, a neo-hippie. Sandra finds herself at odds with Leah, a sassy and rude neighbour who has been expelled from school, does several drugs, and constantly listens and sings along to her mother&#x27;s Cass Elliot records. While Jamie&#x27;s homosexuality remains concealed, his introvert nature and dislike of football are reason enough for his classmates to bully him at every opportunity.

Ste, who is living together with his drug-dealing brother and abusive, alcoholic father in the flat next door, is one night beaten by his father so badly that Sandra takes pity and lets him sleep over. In the absence of a third bed, Ste has to make do with sleeping &#x27;top-to-toe&#x27; with Jamie. On the second night they share a bed: after a massage and a minor conversation, the boys soon change sleeping arrangements and Jamie kisses Ste for the first time.

The next morning, Ste panics and leaves before Jamie awakens, avoiding him for days. Jamie works up the nerve to steal a &quot;Gay Times&quot; from a newsagent, apparently starting to accept his sexuality and affection for Ste. Jamie finally spots Ste at a nearby party and confronts him; they prepare to leave together. The party ends badly, with Sandra taking vengeance on Leah for gossiping, who then threatens to &#x27;spill the beans&#x27; about Ste and Jamie and confesses to having covered up for Ste in front of his father and brother. Ste reacts poorly, angrily rejecting Jamie and running away.

Slowly, Ste accepts Jamie&#x27;s love and their relationship begins to develop as they visit a gay pub together. Sandra follows them and discovers their secret, and the story reaches its climax as a bad trip by Leah (on an unnamed drug) precipitates Sandra&#x27;s breakup with Tony; the news of Sandra&#x27;s new job comes out; and Sandra confronts Ste and Jamie. Sandra comes to accept her son&#x27;s relationship.

The play ends with the two boys slow-dancing in the courtyard of their council flats to the Cass Elliot song &quot;Dream a Little Dream of Me&quot;, while a guarding Sandra dances defiantly at their side with Leah as the local residents look on; some of them shocked, some of them enjoying the moment themselves.

<doc id="165793" wikidata="Q711730" url="?curid=165793" title="Hal Newhouser">
<text>Harold Newhouser (May 20, 1921 – November 10, 1998), nicknamed &quot;Prince Hal&quot;, was an American professional baseball player. In Major League Baseball (MLB), he pitched 17 seasons on the Detroit Tigers and Cleveland Indians, from 1939 through 1955.

Newhouser was an All-Star for six seasons and was considered to be the most dominating pitcher of the World War II era of baseball, winning the pitching triple crown for the Tigers in 1945. To date, he is also the only pitcher in MLB history ever to win two consecutive MVP awards. Newhouser was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1992.

After his retirement from baseball, Newhouser stepped away from the sport for 20 years, serving as a bank vice president. He later worked as a scout for several MLB teams, including the Houston Astros. Angered when they rebuffed his recommendation to draft future Hall of Famer Derek Jeter in favor of Phil Nevin, he quit shortly after.

==Early life==
Newhouser was a schoolboy star at Wilbur Wright High School in his hometown of Detroit, Michigan. Before he was approached by professional baseball teams, he had been saving money to attend a trade school by working several jobs. The young Newhouser sold newspapers, collected pop bottles, and worked in a bowling alley before signing on in professional baseball.

He was signed by the Detroit Tigers in at the age of 18. A Tigers scout offered a $500 signing bonus to Newhouser, who found the sum of money to be unimaginable. Ten minutes after he signed, someone arrived from the Cleveland Indians; that employee had been prepared to offer $15,000 to his parents in addition to a $4,000 car.

==Playing career==

===Early career===
Newhouser made his debut for Detroit on September 29, 1939. In , he earned a spot on the Tigers out of spring training. In his first two full big-league seasons, the young left-hander experienced control problems, walking more batters than he struck out while posting win–loss records of 9–9 and 9–11. He improved in and , posting excellent earned run averages (ERAs), but he still lost more than he won on a team with a weak offense.

As World War II got under way, the Tigers moved up in the standings because several of their top players, including Newhouser, were classified as 4-F (ineligible to be drafted). Newhouser was 4-F due to a leaky heart valve; he attempted to join the service anyway but was turned down several times.

He blossomed in , becoming a dominant pitcher in wartime baseball. That season, Newhouser rang up a 29–9 record, leading the league in wins and strikeouts (187). His 2.22 ERA was second in the league, as were his 25 complete games and six shutouts. The Tigers jumped into contention, finishing second in the American League, with Newhouser named MVP. Newhouser won the first Sporting News Pitcher of the Year Award in 1944.

By the season, Newhouser had been selected for three consecutive AL All-Star teams. The 1945 All-Star Game was cancelled on April 24 because of travel restrictions and seven out of eight scheduled interleague games were played in place of the All-Star Game on July 9 and 10 to support the American Red Cross and War Relief fund. Newhouser became the first pitcher to repeat as MVP that season and helped the team win the World Series. He won the pitcher&#x27;s Triple Crown, leading the AL in wins (25, against nine losses), ERA (1.81) and strikeouts (212); he also led the league in innings pitched, games started, complete games and shutouts. Newhouser pitched four innings of relief on the season&#x27;s final day as Detroit rallied for the pennant. Newhouser won the second Sporting News Pitcher of the Year Award. He became the youngest player (24) to win the award in two consecutive years. In that year&#x27;s World Series against the Chicago Cubs, Newhouser won two games, including a complete-game victory in the deciding seventh game.

===Later career===

In , he went 26–9 with a 1.94 ERA, again leading the league in wins and ERA. His 275 strikeouts was second in the league. Newhouser was runner-up in the MVP race to Ted Williams. Newhouser continued to rate among the game&#x27;s best pitchers for the next five years. He won 17 games in , led the AL with 21 wins in and rang up an 18–11 mark in . After a 15–13 season in , he hurt his arm and his workload was cut significantly.

After being released by the Tigers following the season, Newhouser signed on with the Cleveland Indians and was their top long reliever in , when Cleveland won 111 games and the pennant. In his final big-league hurrah, he posted a 7–2 mark with a 2.54 ERA, and got to pitch in his second World Series. He ended his career with a record of 207–150 and a 3.06 ERA. He is the only pitcher ever to win consecutive MVP awards.

As a hitter, Newhouser had a .201 career batting average (201-for-999) with 70 runs, 2 home runs, 81 RBI and 89 bases on balls. Defensively, he recorded a .971 fielding percentage covering 488 games pitched.

Newhouser tried to vary his pitch selection. Even if he threw a batter the same variety of pitch twice in a row, he would always change speeds slightly, to keep the hitters guessing.

==Later life==

Newhouser spent his first 20 years after retiring from baseball away from the sport, working as a bank vice president in Pontiac, Michigan.
Eventually, he served as a scout for the Baltimore Orioles, Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers, and Houston Astros. As a scout with the Orioles, Newhouser discovered Milt Pappas, a Detroit high schooler who went on to win 209 games in an All-Star career—two more than Newhouser did. He also signed future Cy Young Award winner Dean Chance, who later earned the trophy with the Los Angeles Angels in 1964.

While with the Astros, Newhouser was credited with discovering Derek Jeter, whom the Astros passed over for Phil Nevin. He quit his job with the Astros after they ignored his advice to draft Jeter, though he had planned to retire after that season in any case.

In , he was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. His induction class included Tom Seaver, Rollie Fingers and Bill McGowan. The ceremony was attended by a then-record-setting crowd of 20,000 people. The Tigers retired Newhouser&#x27;s number 16 in . He died on November 10, 1998, in a hospital in Southfield, Michigan. He had been ill with emphysema and heart problems.

==Personal life==
Newhouser was married to his wife, the former Beryl Margaret Steele (1922–2012), from 1941 until his death. They had two daughters, Charlene and Sherrill.

During his playing days, Newhouser&#x27;s teammates nicknamed him &quot;Prince Hal&quot; because of the way he carried himself.

<text>In &amp; Out is a 1997 American comedy film directed by Frank Oz, written by Paul Rudnick, and starring Kevin Kline, Tom Selleck, Joan Cusack, Matt Dillon, Debbie Reynolds, Bob Newhart, Shalom Harlow, and Wilford Brimley. Cusack was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. 

The film was inspired by Tom Hanks&#x27;s tearful speech when he accepted his 1994 Oscar (for his role in &quot;Philadelphia&quot;), in which he mentioned his high-school drama coach Rawley Farnsworth, and his former classmate John Gilkerson, &quot;two of the finest gay Americans, two wonderful men that I had the good fortune to be associated with.&quot; The film became one of mainstream Hollywood&#x27;s first few attempts at a comedic &quot;gay movie&quot; of its era, and was widely noted at the time for a 12-second kiss between Kevin Kline and Tom Selleck.

Howard Brackett is a well-liked English literature teacher, living a quiet life in the fictional town of Greenleaf, Indiana, with his fiancée and fellow teacher Emily Montgomery, who has low self-esteem and recently lost weight for the wedding.

The town is filled with anticipation over the nomination of Howard&#x27;s former student Cameron Drake in the Best Actor category at the Academy Awards for his portrayal of a gay soldier in &quot;To Serve and Protect&quot;. Cameron wins, and in his acceptance speech he thanks Howard, dedicating the award to him, finishing his speech with &quot;and he&#x27;s gay&quot;.

Howard&#x27;s family, friends, students, co-workers and Emily are shocked, but that is nothing compared to Howard&#x27;s own reaction of disbelief and indignation. He angrily reassures those who know him that he is heterosexual. Reporters invade his hometown and harass him for interviews following the awards night telecast. Howard is placed under the scrutiny of his boss, Principal Tom Halliwell, who is uncomfortable with the attention being brought to the school.

Although the other reporters leave after getting their story, one stays behind: on-camera entertainment reporter Peter Malloy, who wants to wait the week out so he can cover Howard&#x27;s wedding to Emily. Howard confesses to a priest who recommends he sleep with Emily in order to prove his heterosexuality. Howard finds he cannot go through with it due to his conflicting emotions and Emily&#x27;s concern for his well-being.

Howard crosses paths with Peter, who reveals that he is gay. Peter narrates his own experience in coming out to his family. Howard insists that he is not gay, prompting Peter to kiss him. Although shocked, he reacts somewhat positively to the kiss.

Howard&#x27;s final measure to restore his heterosexuality is the use of a self-help audio cassette, although that fails as well. During the wedding ceremony, Emily recites her vow without hesitation, but when Howard is prompted by the minister, he finally comes out as gay. The wedding is called off, and although Peter is proud of him, Howard is angry with himself for hurting Emily.

Howard is fired from the school because of his coming out. Despite no longer being on the faculty, he is allowed to attend the graduation ceremony to support his students and sits on stage with his former co-workers. Having learned of the ensuing media blitz while in Los Angeles, Cameron flies to his hometown with his supermodel girlfriend and shows up at the ceremony.

When Cameron learns that his former teacher became ineligible for the &quot;Teacher of the Year&quot; award due to being dismissed for being gay, he publicly questions if the reason given, that the community would not have supported Howard&#x27;s continued employment, is valid. Spurred on by this, when one student who got into college—thanks to Howard&#x27;s hard work—proclaims himself to be gay, his classmates join him to proclaim themselves to be gay as well, showing their support. Howard&#x27;s family follows suit, as do his friends, and all the townsfolk assembled. Although Howard does not win &quot;Teacher of the Year&quot;, Cameron presents him with his Oscar to the cheers of the crowd.

Howard&#x27;s wedding-crazy mother finally gets a wedding—her own, when she and her husband renew their vows. Howard, Peter and the rest of the townsfolk attend the reception. Among the crowd are Emily and Cameron, who appear to have begun a relationship. Everyone dances to the Village People song &quot;Macho Man&quot;.

==Cast==
==Production==
According to Frank Oz, production had to be stopped temporarily because &quot;we all got sick...because we all got the flu.&quot; Oz and Wilford Brimley reportedly did not get along during production; however neither of them have ever elaborated on what caused the friction between the two.

Selected for its &quot;beautiful auditorium, a great gymnasium&quot; and other aesthetic qualities, the Pompton Lakes High School in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey was used extensively as a filming location for &quot;In &amp; Out&quot;.

Some filming was done in Northport, New York, located on the north shore of Long Island in Suffolk County.

==Soundtrack==
At first, Frank Oz asked Miles Goodman to do the music for &quot;In &amp; Out&quot;. Goodman, who composed several of Oz&#x27;s previous films, died before he could do so.

A soundtrack was released on Tuesday, September 23, 1997, featuring previously recorded songs as well as Marc Shaiman&#x27;s instrumental music composed for the film.

==Release==

===Critical reception===
&quot;In &amp; Out&quot; was well received by critics. The performances were widely praised, especially Cusack, who earned an Oscar nod, and Kline. The film also gained attention for depicting homosexuality in a &quot;mainstream&quot; comedy about &quot;Middle America,&quot; which, Rita Kempley Howe wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;manages to simultaneously flaunt and flout gay stereotypes.&quot; Critics also noted its generally asexual treatment of homosexuality: Janet Maslin commented in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the film is not one &quot;to associate gayness with actual sex,&quot; while &quot;TV Guide&quot; quipped that it &quot;finally gets discussion about gay people out of the bedroom and into the record store.&quot; Despite generally positive reviews, several critics, even those who were complimentary, felt that the ending was weak and did not live up to the rest of the film.

The film has a 75% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10; the site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t always find comfortable ground between broad comedy and social commentary, but lively performances—especially from Kevin Kline and Joan Cusack—enrich &quot;In &amp; Out&quot;″s mixture of laughs and sexual tolerance.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a rating of 70 based on reviews from 18 critics.

===Accolades===
American Film Institute recognition:
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Laughs – Nominated

===Box office===
The film did well at the box office, grossing $15,019,821 in its opening weekend and $63,856,929 over its entire theatrical run.

<doc id="165798" wikidata="Q12395" url="?curid=165798" title="The Legend of Zelda (video game)">
<text>The Legend of Zelda, originally released in Japan as is an action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo. The first game of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series, it is set in the fantasy land of Hyrule and centers on an elf-like boy named Link, who aims to collect the eight fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom in order to rescue Princess Zelda from Ganon. The player controls Link from a top-down perspective and navigates throughout the overworld and dungeons, collecting weapons, defeating enemies and uncovering secrets along the way.

Designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka, it was originally released in Japan as a launch title for the Family Computer Disk System in February 1986. More than a year later, North America and Europe received releases on the Nintendo Entertainment System in cartridge format, being the first home console game to include an internal battery in the US for saving data. This version was later released in Japan in 1994 under the title The game was ported to the GameCube and Game Boy Advance, and was available via the Virtual Console on the Wii, Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. It was also one of 30 games included in the NES Classic Edition system, and is available on the Nintendo Switch through the Nintendo Switch Online service.

&quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; was a critical and commercial success for Nintendo. The game sold over 6.5 million copies, launched a major franchise, and has been regularly featured in lists of the greatest video games of all time. A sequel, &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot;, was first released in Japan for the Famicom Disk System less than a year after its predecessor, and numerous additional successors and spinoffs have been released in the decades since its debut.

==Gameplay==
&quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; incorporates elements of action, adventure, and role-playing genres. The player controls Link from a flip-screen overhead perspective as he travels the overworld, a large outdoor map with various environments. Link begins the game equipped only with a small shield, but can enter a cave and receive a sword from an old man who advises, &quot;&quot; Throughout the adventure, Link finds and acquires various items that increase his abilities further, including heart containers which increase his life meter; magic rings which decrease the amount of damage Link takes from enemy attacks; and stronger swords which allow Link to inflict more damage to enemies. These items are mainly found in caves scattered throughout the land. Some are easily accessible, while others are hidden beneath obstacles such as rocks, trees, and waterfalls. Defeated enemies sometimes drop items including hearts, which refill the life meter, and Rupees, the in-game currency. Rupees can also be found in hidden treasure caves and are used to buy equipment, information, and ability upgrades.

Hidden in the overworld are entrances to eight large dungeons housing the pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom. Each dungeon has a unique maze-like layout of rooms connected by doors and secret passages, often barred by monsters (which must be defeated) or by blocks (which must be moved to gain entrance). Dungeons also contain useful items Link can add to his inventory, such as a boomerang for stunning enemies and retrieving distant items, and a magical recorder that lets Link teleport to the entrance of any dungeon he has previously cleared. Once Link has collected all eight pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom from these dungeons, he gains access to a ninth and final dungeon in order to defeat Ganon and rescue Zelda. The game may be completed by traversing any given dungeon on the overworld and is largely flexible to players, although gameplay steadily increases in difficulty, and some rooms can only be passed by using items gained in previous locations. There are dungeons with secret entrances which must be uncovered while freely wandering the overworld after acquiring useful items. This freedom allows many ways of progressing through the game. It is possible to reach the final boss without receiving the normally vital sword at its outset. The game world contains 600 separate scenes, with the overworld consisting of over 97 scenes and the underworld consisting of nine multi-scene labyrinths.

After initially completing the game, a player can begin a more difficult version referred to as the , which alters many locations, secrets, and includes entirely distinct dungeons and stronger enemies. Although more difficult &quot;replays&quot; were not unique to &quot;Zelda&quot;, few games offered completely different levels upon the second playthrough. By starting a new file with the name entered as &quot;ZELDA&quot;, this mode can instead be accessed without needing to beat the game first.

== Plot ==
=== Setting ===
Within the official &quot;Zelda&quot; Chronology, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; takes place in an Era called &quot;The Era of Decline&quot;, which exists within an alternative reality. In this era, Hyrule has been reduced to a small kingdom where the residents now live in caves, setting the background for &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;.

=== Story ===
The story of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; is described in the instruction booklet and during the short prologue which plays after the title screen: The small kingdom of Hyrule is engulfed by chaos when an army led by Ganon, the prince of darkness, invades and steals the Triforce of Power, one part of a magical artifact which alone bestows great strength. In an attempt to prevent him from acquiring the Triforce of Wisdom, Princess Zelda splits it into eight fragments and hides them in secret underground dungeons. Before eventually being kidnapped by Ganon, she commands her nursemaid Impa to find someone courageous enough to save the kingdom. While wandering the land, the old woman is surrounded by Ganon&#x27;s henchmen, when a young boy named Link appears and rescues her. Upon hearing Impa&#x27;s plea, he resolves to save Zelda and sets out to reassemble the scattered fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom, with which Ganon can then be defeated.

During the course of the tale, Link locates and braves the eight underworld labyrinths, and beyond their defeated guardian monsters retrieves each fragment. With the completed Triforce of Wisdom, he is able to infiltrate Ganon&#x27;s hideout in Death Mountain, confronting the prince of darkness and destroying him with the Silver Arrow. Obtaining the Triforce of Power from Ganon&#x27;s ashes, Link returns it and the restored Triforce of Wisdom to the rescued Princess Zelda, and peace returns to Hyrule.

== Development ==
&quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; was directed and designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka (credited as S. Miyahon and Ten Ten respectively in the closing credits). Miyamoto produced the game, and Tezuka wrote the story and script. Much of the programming was done by Toshihiko Nakago of Nintendo&#x27;s partner SRD. Keiji Terui, a screenwriter who worked on anime shows such as &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; and &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, wrote the backstory for the manual, drawing inspiration from conflicts in medieval Europe. Development began in the fall of 1984, and the game was originally intended to be a launch game for the Famicom Disk System. The development team worked on &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; concurrently, and tried to separate their ideas: &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; was to be linear, where the action occurred in a strict sequence, whereas &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; would be the opposite. In &quot;Mario&quot;, Miyamoto downplayed the importance of the high score in favor of simply completing the game. This concept was carried over to &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;. Miyamoto was also in charge of deciding which concepts were &quot;&quot;Zelda&quot; ideas&quot; or &quot;&quot;Mario&quot; ideas&quot;. Contrasting with &quot;Mario&quot;, &quot;Zelda&quot; was made non-linear and forced the players to think about what they should do next. According to Miyamoto, those in Japan were confused and had trouble finding their way through the multi-path dungeons, and in initial game designs, the player would start with the sword already in their inventory. Rather than merely simplifying matters for players, Miyamoto forced the player to listen to the old man who gives the player their sword, and encouraged interaction among people to share their ideas with each other to find the various hidden secrets, a new form of gaming communication. Relatedly, this concept turned into the root of another series to be developed many years in the future: Miyamoto said that &quot;Zelda&quot; became the inspiration for &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;, a game based solely on communication.

With &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, Miyamoto wanted to flesh out the idea of a game &quot;world&quot; even further, giving players a &quot;miniature garden that they can put inside their drawer&quot;. He drew his inspiration from his experiences as a boy around Kyoto, where he explored nearby fields, woods, and caves, always trying through &quot;Zelda&quot; games to impart players some sense of that limitless wonder he felt through unknown exploration. According to Miyamoto: &quot;When I was a child, I went hiking and found a lake. It was quite a surprise for me to stumble upon it. When I traveled around the country without a map, trying to find my way, stumbling on amazing things as I went, I realized how it felt to go on an adventure like this.&quot; The memory of being lost amid the maze of sliding doors in his family&#x27;s home in Sonobe was recreated in &quot;Zelda&quot;″s labyrinthian dungeons. Tezuka finalized the designs for each &quot;level&quot; of dungeons and handed them all to Nakago in December 1985 so he could closely replicate them in the actual game. Nakago ended up using only half of all the dungeon pieces while copying the whole map. Miyamoto said it was good enough, and the team decided to use half of the left-over memory to create the Second Quest. Tezuka also wrote the setting to be a fairytale adventure, taking inspiration from fantasy books such as J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

The hero &quot;Link&quot; was so named in part to connect players inserted into this world with their interactive role, as something of a blank slate representing their individuality or methods. Designed by Miyamoto as a coming of age motif to identify with, journeying as an ordinary boy strengthened by trials to triumph over great challenges and rise to meet evil. The name of the titular princess came from Zelda Fitzgerald. Miyamoto explained that &quot;Zelda was the wife of famous novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald. She was a famous and beautiful woman from all accounts, and I liked the sound of her name. So I took the liberty of using [it] for the very first title.&quot; Early &quot;Zelda&quot; concepts involved technological elements, with microchips for the Triforce made of electronic circuits and a time-traveling hero, another factor of their name relating to the idea of a computer hyper-&quot;link&quot;. While the final game and subsequent games in the series follow a more traditional medieval-like sword and sorcery setting, later entries have incorporated some technology-based concepts.

Koji Kondo (credited as Konchan) composed the game&#x27;s five music tracks. He had planned to use Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot; as the title theme as it perfectly matched its speed. In Japan, music is publicly released over 50 years after the composer&#x27;s death. But Kondo was forced to change it in November 1985, late in the game&#x27;s development cycle, after learning that it had only been 47 years and 11 months after Ravel&#x27;s death. As a result, Kondo wrote a new arrangement of the overworld theme within one day, which has become an iconic motif echoing throughout continued entries of the series.

== Release ==
=== Japanese release ===
In February 1986, Nintendo released &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; as the launch game for the Family Computer&#x27;s new Disk System peripheral, joined by a re-release of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;Tennis&quot;, &quot;Baseball&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Soccer&quot;, and &quot;Mahjong&quot; as part of the system&#x27;s introduction. It made full use of Disk Card media&#x27;s advantages over traditional ROM cartridges, with an increased size of 128 kilobytes which would be expensive to produce on cartridge format. Due to the still-limited amount of disk space, all of the text used in the game was from only a single syllabary known as katakana, which under normal circumstances primarily relates more to foreign words which supplement those of traditional Japanese origin as with hiragana and kanji characters. Rather than passwords, rewritable disks saved players&#x27; game progress, and the extra sound channel provided by the system was utilized for certain sound effects; most notably Link&#x27;s sword beam at full health, roars and growls of dungeon bosses, and those of defeated enemies. Sound effects had to be altered for the eventual cartridge release version of Zelda which used the Famicom&#x27;s PCM channel. The game also took advantage of that system&#x27;s controller having a built-in microphone, a feature the NES model did not include. It was used to defeat the large-eared rabbit-like monster Pols Voice by blowing or shouting. The U.S. instruction manual still hints that this enemy &quot;hates loud noise&quot;, confusing many into thinking the recorder item could be used to attack (in actuality, it has no effect). The cartridge version made use of the Memory Management Controller chip (specifically the MMC1 model), which could use bank-switching to allow for larger games than had previously been possible, and could also use battery-powered RAM letting players save their data for the first time on the NES.

=== American release ===
When Nintendo published the game in North America, the packaging design featured a small portion of the box cut away to reveal the unique gold-colored cartridge. In 1988, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; sold two million copies. Nintendo of America sought to keep its strong base of fans; anyone who purchased a game and sent in a warranty card became a member of the Fun Club, whose members got a four-, eight- and eventually 32-page newsletter. Seven hundred copies of the first issue were sent out free of charge, but the number grew as the data bank of names got larger.

From the success of magazines in Japan, Nintendo knew that game tips were a valued asset. Players enjoyed the bimonthly newsletter&#x27;s crossword puzzles and jokes, but game secrets were most valued. The Fun Club drew kids in by offering tips for the more complicated games, especially &quot;Zelda&quot;, with its hidden rooms, secret keys and passageways. The mailing list grew. By early 1988, there were over 1 million Fun Club members, which led then-Nintendo of America president Minoru Arakawa to start the &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; magazine.

Since Nintendo did not have many products, it made only a few commercials a year, targeting high quality for each. The budget for a single commercial could reach US$5 million, four or five times more than most companies spent. One of the first commercials made under Bill White, director of advertising and public relations, was the market introduction for the &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot;, which received a great deal of attention in the ad industry. In it, a wiry-haired, nerdy guy (John Kassir) walks through the dark making goofy noises, yelling out the names of enemies from the game, and screaming for Zelda.

=== Re-releases ===
&quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; was first re-released in cartridge format for the Famicom in 1994. The cartridge version slightly modified the title screen of the Disk Card version of the game, such that it displayed the number &quot;1&quot; at the end of the title. In 2001, the original game was re-released in the GameCube game &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;. The only way to unlock the game is by using an Action Replay. An official re-release was included in 2003&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; for the GameCube, and the game was again re-released on the Game Boy Advance in 2004 along with its sequel, &quot;The Adventure of Link&quot;, as part of the Famicom Mini/Classic NES Series. In 2006, it was released on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console, and a timed demo of the game was released for the 2008 Wii game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;, available in the Vault section.

All re-releases of the game are virtually identical to the original, though the GameCube, Game Boy Advance, and Virtual Console versions have been altered slightly to correct several instances of incorrect spelling from the original, most notably in the intro story. A tech demo called &quot;Classic Games&quot; was shown for the Nintendo 3DS at E3 2010, showcasing more than a dozen classic games using 3D effects, including &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;. Reggie Fils-Aimé, president of Nintendo of America, said that the games were slated for release on the 3DS, including &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;Mega Man 2&quot;, and &quot;Super Mario World 2: Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;, using some of the 3DS&#x27;s features, such as 3D effects, analog control, or camera support.

&quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; was released to the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in September 2011, as a part of the Nintendo 3DS Ambassador program, and was later released to the Nintendo 3DS eShop on December 22 in Japan; in 2012, it was released in Europe on April 12 and on July 5 in North America. The version released to the Japanese 3DS Virtual Console was the cartridge version. The game was released for the Nintendo Switch as part of the &quot;Nintendo Switch Online - Nintendo Entertainment System&quot; service on September 18, 2018. A special &quot;Living the life of luxury!&quot; edition of the game, which grants players all equipment and extra items at the start of the game, was later added to the service on October 10. In November 2021, Nintendo released a &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; edition of the Game &amp; Watch console, similar to the rereleased &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; Game &amp; Watch. This version includes the original &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot;, as well as &quot;Zelda II: Adventure of Link&quot;, and the Gameboy version of &quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot;. The &quot;Zelda&quot; Game &amp; Watch also includes a modified version of the Game and Watch original, &quot;Vermin&quot;, with Link replacing Mr. Game and Watch.

== Reception ==
&quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; received highly positive reviews from critics and was a best-seller for Nintendo. Upon release in Japan, it sold 1 million copies on its first day of release, and sold a total of 1.69 million for the Famicom Disk System in Japan. In North America, the game was highly anticipated and topped the video game charts upon release. It became the first NES game to sell over 1 million cartridges in the United States during 1987, increasing to more than 2 million cartridges sold by 1988. It went on to sell 3 million cartridges in the United States by 1990, and eventually 6.51 million copies worldwide.

Critics lauded the graphics, storytelling and setting, and gameplay, hailing the latter as groundbreaking. In Japan, &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; (&quot;Famitsu&quot;) magazine gave it a full score of 5 out of 5 stars, while the first &quot;Famitsu&quot; Best Hit Game Awards gave &quot;Zelda&quot; the award for best background music and listed it as the third best Game of the Year (just below &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; and &quot;Gradius&quot;). Upon release in North America, &quot;Computer Entertainer&quot; called it an &quot;excellent&quot; adventure game that exceeded expectations and said it had &quot;more to offer than the typical hack-and-slash&quot; epics, with &quot;monsters to fight, secret doors to discover, and plenty of frustration&quot; rewarded with new treasures, weapons, experience, places and discoveries. The review also praised the &quot;very appealing&quot; and &quot;beautiful, fairy-tale&quot; quality, the battery backup save feature, the &quot;charming graphics, superb original music, excellent animation, and smooth transitions in scrolling between locations&quot;. They called it &quot;an incredibly rich, deep gaming experience that goes far beyond the typical cartridge game&quot; with appeal &quot;to both male and female players&quot; of all ages, making it a &quot;must-have&quot; for every Nintendo owner. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1988 named the game as the best adventure of the year, stating that &quot;Zelda&quot; had been a &quot;sensational success&quot; in bringing elements of computer action-adventures to consoles. In 1990, the magazine implied that the game was a killer app, causing computer RPG players who had dismissed consoles as &quot;mere arcade toys&quot; to buy the NES.

Upon release in Europe, Tony Takoushi reviewed the game in British magazine &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; and called it a massive arcade adventure packed full of dragons, imprisoned princesses, traps and pitfalls. They said it has &quot;an enormous country to examine&quot; with &quot;dozens of things to collect&quot; along with hidden power-ups and bonuses, while praising the &quot;supreme&quot; playability and the &quot;excellent&quot; graphics and sound, but they criticized the &quot;hefty&quot; price tag of £39 or in the United Kingdom. &quot;ACE&quot; magazine reviewed the game in 1989, calling it a &quot;role-playing epic&quot; that proves &quot;consoles can be just as good at role-playing games as they are for arcade entertainment&quot; while listing it as one of the top four best games available for the NES (along with &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;Mike Tyson&#x27;s Punch-Out&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;). &quot;Zelda&quot; was reviewed in 1992 by &quot;Total!&quot; where it received a 78% rating due in great part to mediocre sub-scores for music and graphics. A 1993 review of the game was printed in American magazine &quot;Dragon&quot; #198 by Sandy Petersen in the &quot;Eye of the Monitor&quot; column, scoring the game 4 out of 5 stars.

It was reissued in 1992 as part of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Classic Series&quot; and featured a grey cartridge. The game placed first in the player&#x27;s poll &quot;Top 30&quot; in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s first issue and continued to dominate the list into the early 1990s. &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; was also voted by &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; readers as the &quot;Best Challenge&quot; in the &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; Awards &#x27;88. The magazine also listed it as the best Nintendo Entertainment System video game ever created, stating that it was fun despite its age and innovated on the genre. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; ranked it the third best NES game ever made. The staff praised its &quot;mix of complexity, open world design, and timeless graphics&quot;.

&quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; has continued to receive critical acclaim from modern critics and remains well regarded. It is often featured in lists of games considered the greatest or most influential. In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; ranked the game 2nd on its &quot;Top 100 Video Games&quot;. It placed first in &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s list of the &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot; and &quot;The Top 200 Games of All Time&quot; (in 2001 and 2009 respectively), thirteenth in &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s 100th issue listing the &quot;100 Best Games of All Time&quot;, fifth in &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s 200th issue listing &quot;The Greatest 200 Videogames of Their Time&quot;, seventh in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s list of the 200 Best Nintendo Games Ever, 77th in &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot;″s 100 greatest Nintendo games of all time and 80th among &quot;IGN&quot; readers&#x27; &quot;Top 99 Games&quot;. &quot;Zelda&quot; was inducted into &quot;GameSpy&quot;″s Hall of Fame in August 2000 and voted by &quot;GameSpy&quot;″s editors as the tenth best game of all time. Editors of the popular Japanese magazine &quot;Weekly Famitsu&quot; voted the game among the best on the Famicom. In 1997 &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed the North American release in their &quot;Five Greatest Game Packages of All Time&quot;, citing the die-cut hole which revealed the gold cartridge, full color manual, and fold-out map. In 2016, The Strong National Museum of Play inducted &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; to its World Video Game Hall of Fame.

== Legacy ==
&quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; is considered a spiritual forerunner of the modern action role-playing video game (RPG) genre. Though it is often not considered part of the genre since it lacked key RPG mechanics such as experience points, it had many features in common with RPGs and served as the template for the action role-playing game genre. The game&#x27;s fantasy setting, musical style and action-adventure gameplay were adopted by many RPGs. Its commercial success helped lay the groundwork for involved, non-linear games in fantasy settings, such as those found in successful RPGs, including &quot;Crystalis&quot;, &quot;Soul Blazer&quot;, Square&#x27;s &quot;Seiken Densetsu&quot; series, &quot;Alundra&quot;, and &quot;Brave Fencer Musashi&quot;. The popularity of the game also spawned several clones trying to emulate the game. Despite this, Miyamoto did not consider &quot;Zelda&quot; an RPG, but classified &quot;Zelda&quot; as &quot;a real-time adventure game&quot;; he said he was &quot;not interested in systems where everything in the game is decided by stats and numbers&quot; but what&#x27;s &quot;important to me is to preserve as much of that &#x27;live&#x27; feeling as possible&quot; which he said &quot;action games are better suited in conveying&quot; to players.

&quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; spawned a solitary sequel, many prequels and spin-offs and is one of Nintendo&#x27;s most popular series. It established important characters and environments of the &quot;Zelda&quot; universe, including Link, Princess Zelda, Ganon, Impa, and the Triforce as the power that binds Hyrule together. The overworld theme and distinctive &quot;secret found&quot; jingle have appeared in nearly every subsequent &quot;Zelda&quot; game. The theme has also appeared in various other games featuring references to the &quot;Zelda&quot; series.

An arcade system board, called the Triforce, was developed jointly by Namco, Sega, and Nintendo, with the first games appearing in 2002. The name &quot;Triforce&quot; is a reference to Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series of games, and symbolized the three companies&#x27; involvement in the project.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; featured &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; as one of the 15 most influential games of all time, for being an early example of open world, nonlinear gameplay, and for its introduction of battery backup saving worldwide, to laying the foundations for later action-adventure games like &quot;Metroid&quot; and role-playing video games like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, while influencing most modern games in general. In 2009, &quot;Game Informer&quot; called &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; &quot;no less than the greatest game of all time&quot; on their list of &quot;The Top 200 Games of All Time&quot;, saying that it was &quot;ahead of its time by years if not decades&quot;.

In 2011, Nintendo celebrated the game&#x27;s 25th anniversary in a similar vein to the &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; 25th anniversary celebration the previous year. This celebration included a free mailout Club Nintendo offer of the &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; soundtrack to owners of the 3DS version of that particular game, the first digital for Nintendo eShop release of &quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening DX&quot;, special posters that are mailed out as rewards through Club Nintendo, and a special stage inspired by the original &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; in the video game &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; for the Nintendo 3DS.

=== Sequels ===
There have also been a few substantially altered versions of the game that have been released as pseudo-sequels, and &quot;&quot;- or &quot;gaiden&quot;-versions. As part of a promotional advertisement campaign for their noodles, released a version of the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; in 1986, . It is one of the rarest video games available on the second-hand collector&#x27;s market, and copies have sold for over .

From August 6 to September 2, 1995, Nintendo, in collaboration with the St.GIGA satellite radio network, began broadcasts of a substantially different version of the original &quot;The Hyrule Fantasy: Legend of Zelda&quot; for a Super Famicom peripheral, the Satellaview—a satellite modem add-on. The game, , was released for download in four episodic, weekly installments which were rebroadcast at least four times between the game&#x27;s 1995 premiere and January 1997. &quot;BS Zelda&quot; was the first Satellaview game to feature a &quot;SoundLink&quot; soundtrack—a streaming audio track through which, every few minutes, players were cautioned to listen carefully as a voice actor narrator, broadcasting live from the St.GIGA studio, would give them plot and gameplay clues. In addition to the SoundLink elements, &quot;BS Zelda&quot; also featured updated 16-bit graphics, a smaller overworld, and different dungeons. Link was replaced by one of the two Satellaview avatars: a boy wearing a backward baseball cap or a girl with red hair.

Between December 30, 1995, and January 6, 1996, a second version of the game, , was broadcast to the Satellaview as the functional equivalent of the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;″s Second Quest. &quot;MAP 2&quot; was rebroadcast only once, in March 1996.

<text>Guisborough ( ) is a market town and civil parish in the borough of Redcar and Cleveland, North Yorkshire, England. It lies north of the North York Moors National Park. Roseberry Topping, midway between the town and Great Ayton, is a landmark in the national park. It was governed by an urban district and rural district in the North Riding of Yorkshire.

==Etymology==
Assessing the origin of the name &quot;Guisborough&quot;, Albert Hugh Smith commented that it was &quot;difficult&quot;. From its first attestation in the Domesday Book into the 16th century, the second part sometimes derived from the originally Old English word &quot;burh&quot; (&#x27;town, fortification&#x27;) and sometimes from the Old English word -&quot;burn&quot; (&#x27;stream&#x27;). It seems that the settlement was simply known by both names, the -&quot;burh&quot;/-&quot;borough&quot; forms predominate in the historical record and this survives today.

The origin of the first element is uncertain: Smith&#x27;s best guess was from the Old Norse personal name &quot;Gígr&quot; in its genitive &quot;Gígs&quot;. If so, &quot;Guisborough&quot; once meant &quot;Gígr&#x27;s town&quot;. To this day the first element has a different spelling for the town from Gisborough Priory and Gisborough Hall in the town.

== Demographics ==

At the 2011 census, the civil parish with outlying Upleatham, Dunsdale and Newton under Roseberry had a population of 17,777, of which 16,979 were in the town&#x27;s built-up area.

==History==
===Roman===
Some archaeologists date the town to the Roman occupation, when it may have been a military fortification. The discoveries of a few Roman artefacts such as the elaborate ceremonial Guisborough Helmet, support this but proof is still lacking.

The Guisborough Helmet is a Roman cavalry helmet found near the town in 1864. Its original protective cheek-pieces have not survived but the attachment holes can be seen in front of the helmet&#x27;s ear guards. It is lavishly decorated with engraved and embossed figures indicating that it was probably used for display or cavalry tournaments, although possibly for battle as well. It was unearthed in what appears to be a carefully arranged deposition in a bed of gravel, distant from any known Roman sites. After its recovery during roadworks it was donated to the British Museum for restoration and display.

===Medieval===

&quot;Gighesbore&quot; is recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086 as a place within Langbaurgh Wapentake or hundred.

The ruined Gisborough Priory dates from the 12th century.

===Victorian era===
The town shared in the prosperity of the Industrial Revolution by being close to the ironstone mines of the North York Moors. One of the area&#x27;s ironfounders, Sir Joseph Whitwell Pease, chose as his country seat the Gothic revival Hutton Hall designed by Alfred Waterhouse, at Hutton Lowcross, near Guisborough.

Gisborough Hall, a Victorian mansion, owned by the Chaloner family, was built in a Jacobean revival style in 1856. It is a Grade II listed building, but has undergone conversion into a hotel.

===Recent history===
 station was on the Middlesbrough–Guisborough branch of the North Eastern Railway; it closed in 1964. Extensive residential development occurred in the 1960s and 1970s, linked to the expansion of the chemical industry at Wilton and the steel industry at Redcar.

==Governance==

Guisborough&#x27;s county authority since 1889, the North Riding of Yorkshire, was disbanded in 1974. The town was in the county of Cleveland&#x27;s Langbaurgh borough from 1974 to 1996 and is now in the Redcar and Cleveland unitary authority borough of North Yorkshire.

Guisborough Town Hall was built on Westgate in 1821. When built, it was arcaded with shambles on the ground floor and an assembly room on the first. The two-storey building was topped with a third storey in 1870. In 2015 Redcar and Cleveland Council acquired the building at auction and subsequently announced plans to redevelop it with financial support from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Tees Valley Combined Authority, the building reopened in April 2022. This building now hosts tea afternoons on Thursdays.

==Religion==
The Anglican Church of St Nicholas houses the De Brus Cenotaph. A church may have existed here in 1290. The chancel of the present one dates from the late 15th century and the nave and interior have been altered. The church in its present form resulted from major rebuilding in 1903–1908, to a design by Temple Moore.

==Community==

Guisborough is the home of the East Cleveland Explorer Scout Unit for those aged 14–18, affiliated to the Scout Association. Activities include work on The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award, Young Leaders volunteering, and over 200 different adventure activities. It has about 30 members. The 3rd Guisborough Scout Group (The Pioneers) at Belmangate was established in 1974.

There is also a group of volunteer trail builders working to provide free mountain-bike trails in the local forest. Local musicians are catered for at an open mic/jam session every Wednesday night.

==Education==
 Primary education is provided at Belmont, Galley Hill, Highcliffe, St Paulinus (Roman Catholic) and Chaloner Primary which is an amalgamation of the previous Park Lane Infants &amp; Northgate Junior School. Laurence Jackson School, situated at the eastern end of the town, is the only secondary school, and doubles as a Specialist Sports College.

Prior Pursglove College, a sixth-form college for GCSE, A level and AS level students, stands next to the parish church and priory ruins on the former site of Guisborough Grammar School, which it replaced after changes in the education system. It had been founded in 1561 by Robert Pursglove, the last Prior of Gisborough, as a charitable school for poor boys. It was accompanied by a set of almshouses for twelve pensioners.

Askham Bryan College of Agriculture operates a Guisborough Centre on the same site as Prior Pursglove College. It consists of an animal management centre and a modern building, the Priory Centre, which the two colleges share.

==Transport==
===Road===

Two main roads cross at Guisborough, the A171 leading west to Middlesbrough and east to Whitby, and the A173 south-west to Stokesley and north-east as far as Skelton, where it joins the A174 coast road. Before the bypass was built, the A171 ran along Westgate, the town&#x27;s main street, crossing the A173 at Chapel Beck Bridge. Just beyond the bypass to the north-east, a B-road heads north from the A173 to Redcar. Another minor route out of town, Wilton Lane, is a winding, almost single-track road running north to the village of Wilton and on to the ICI Wilton chemical works. There are two other lanes that lead out of town into the hills. Hutton Lane ends at Hutton Village, built mostly for local mining, agricultural and estate workers. Belmangate is an ancient funeral route.

===Paths===
The south of the town is bounded by the North York Moors National Park. Guisborough Forest, which is Forestry England land, clothes the edge of the moors. Through the forest, the ground climbs sharply from the plain to the moors behind. There are several rocky outcrops on the steep slope, including Highcliff Nab and the Hanging Stone. The woods are crossed by several rights of way, including Cleveland Way, but other paths and commission tracks are also open to walkers. Beyond the woods, the ground levels out to form Gisborough Moor.

===Railway station===

Until 1964, Guisborough was served by trains from Middlesbrough – the Middlesbrough &amp; Guisborough Railway had its terminus at the now-demolished Guisborough station. Before 1958 it was possible to travel from Guisborough to Whitby and Scarborough, along the scenic North Yorkshire coast railway.

==Economy==
Guisborough market is held on Thursday and Saturday with a few stalls on Tuesday. Originally selling cattle and other livestock, the market developed into a general market for fruit and vegetables, clothing and flowers. It opens from early morning to late afternoon on the restored cobbles of Westgate, the main shopping street. Guisborough Museum, behind Westgate&#x27;s Sunnyfield House, shows photographs of Guisborough&#x27;s history and inhabitants.

One main employer in the town was The Shirt Factory. Towards the end of its existence it was acquired by Montague Burton of Leeds, but it closed in 1999. Other former employers were Blackett Hutton and Co., maker of medium high-integrity castings, and the civil engineering firm Henderson Campbell.

There is a working watermill at Tocketts Mill. On 15 January 2004, Guisborough was granted Fairtrade Town status. It is a commuter town for nearby Middlesbrough and has many working in the chemical plants around Teesside.

==Sport==

Guisborough Town FC, founded in 1973, play in as of the 2023-24 season. The King George V Ground, which hosts the club&#x27;s home matches, is named after the king.

King George&#x27;s Fields, adjacent to the football club, is a playing field with a small playground and a skate park. There is a swimming pool, built in 1968, at the fields. An eight-year campaign led by the late MP, Dr Ashok Kumar, secured the pool&#x27;s refurbishment, which was completed in 2008–2009.

Guisborough Rugby Union Football club plays in Durham/Northumberland 2 division in the 2021–22 season. The area&#x27;s constituent body is the Yorkshire Rugby Football Union, able to compete in the region&#x27;s Silver Trophy.

Guisborough Cricket Club plays in the NYSD cricket league. In 2001–04 it equalled its record of four successive league wins. Past players have included the professionals Murray Goodwin (Sussex and Zimbabwe), Desmond Haynes and Phil Simmons (both West Indies), Imran Jan (Trinidad and Tobago), Sean Clingeleffer (Tasmania) and Greg Todd (Otago).

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Tyne Tees. Television signals are received from the Bilsdale and the local relay TV transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Tees, Capital North East, Smooth North East, Heart North East, and Zetland FM, a community based radio station which broadcast from its studio in Redcar.

The town is served by the local newspapers &quot;TeessideLive&quot; and &quot;The Northern Echo&quot;.
