<text>Genetic recombination (also known as genetic reshuffling) is the exchange of genetic material between different organisms which leads to production of offspring with combinations of traits that differ from those found in either parent. In eukaryotes, genetic recombination during meiosis can lead to a novel set of genetic information that can be further passed on from parents to offspring. Most recombination occurs naturally and can be classified into two types: (1) &quot;interchromosomal&quot; recombination, occurring through independent assortment of alleles whose loci are on different but homologous chromosomes (random orientation of pairs of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I); &amp; (2) &quot;intrachromosomal&quot; recombination, occurring through crossing over.

During meiosis in eukaryotes, genetic recombination involves the pairing of homologous chromosomes. This may be followed by information transfer between the chromosomes. The information transfer may occur without physical exchange (a section of genetic material is copied from one chromosome to another, without the donating chromosome being changed) (see SDSA – Synthesis Dependent Strand Annealing pathway in Figure); or by the breaking and rejoining of DNA strands, which forms new molecules of DNA (see DHJ pathway in Figure).

Recombination may also occur during mitosis in eukaryotes where it ordinarily involves the two sister chromosomes formed after chromosomal replication. In this case, new combinations of alleles are not produced since the sister chromosomes are usually identical. In meiosis and mitosis, recombination occurs between similar molecules of DNA (homologous sequences). In meiosis, non-sister homologous chromosomes pair with each other so that recombination characteristically occurs between non-sister homologues. In both meiotic and mitotic cells, recombination between homologous chromosomes is a common mechanism used in DNA repair.

Gene conversion – the process during which homologous sequences are made identical also falls under genetic recombination.

Genetic recombination and recombinational DNA repair also occurs in bacteria and archaea, which use asexual reproduction.

Recombination can be artificially induced in laboratory (&quot;in vitro&quot;) settings, producing recombinant DNA for purposes including vaccine development.

V(D)J recombination in organisms with an adaptive immune system is a type of site-specific genetic recombination that helps immune cells rapidly diversify to recognize and adapt to new pathogens.

==Synapsis==

During meiosis, synapsis (the pairing of homologous chromosomes) ordinarily precedes genetic recombination.

==Mechanism==
Genetic recombination is catalyzed by many different enzymes. Recombinases are key enzymes that catalyse the strand transfer step during recombination. RecA, the chief recombinase found in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, is responsible for the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). In yeast and other eukaryotic organisms there are two recombinases required for repairing DSBs. The RAD51 protein is required for mitotic and meiotic recombination, whereas the DNA repair protein, DMC1, is specific to meiotic recombination. In the archaea, the ortholog of the bacterial RecA protein is RadA.

===Bacterial recombination===

Bacteria regularly undergo genetic recombination in three main ways:
* Transformation, the uptake of exogenous DNA from the surrounding environment.
* Transduction, the virus-mediated transfer of DNA between bacteria.
* Conjugation, the transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another via cell-to-cell contact.

Sometimes a strand of DNA is transferred into the target cell but fails to be copied as the target divides. This is called an abortive transfer.

==Chromosomal crossover==

In eukaryotes, recombination during meiosis is facilitated by chromosomal crossover. The crossover process leads to offspring having different combinations of genes from those of their parents, and can occasionally produce new chimeric alleles. The shuffling of genes brought about by genetic recombination produces increased genetic variation. It also allows sexually reproducing organisms to avoid Muller&#x27;s ratchet, in which the genomes of an asexual population tend to accumulate more deleterious mutations over time than beneficial or reversing mutations.

Chromosomal crossover involves recombination between the paired chromosomes inherited from each of one&#x27;s parents, generally occurring during meiosis. During prophase I (pachytene stage) the four available chromatids are in tight formation with one another. While in this formation, homologous sites on two chromatids can closely pair with one another, and may exchange genetic information.

Because there is a small probability of recombination at any location along a chromosome, the frequency of recombination between two locations depends on the distance separating them. Therefore, for genes sufficiently distant on the same chromosome, the amount of crossover is high enough to destroy the correlation between alleles.

Tracking the movement of genes resulting from crossovers has proven quite useful to geneticists. Because two genes that are close together are less likely to become separated than genes that are farther apart, geneticists can deduce roughly how far apart two genes are on a chromosome if they know the frequency of the crossovers. Geneticists can also use this method to infer the presence of certain genes. Genes that typically stay together during recombination are said to be linked. One gene in a linked pair can sometimes be used as a marker to deduce the presence of the other gene. This is typically used to detect the presence of a disease-causing gene.

The recombination frequency between two loci observed is the &quot;crossing-over value&quot;. It is the frequency of crossing over between two linked gene loci (markers), and depends on the distance between the genetic loci observed. For any fixed set of genetic and environmental conditions, recombination in a particular region of a linkage structure (chromosome) tends to be constant, and the same is then true for the crossing-over value which is used in the production of genetic maps.

==Gene conversion==

In gene conversion, a section of genetic material is copied from one chromosome to another, without the donating chromosome being changed. Gene conversion occurs at high frequency at the actual site of the recombination event during meiosis. It is a process by which a DNA sequence is copied from one DNA helix (which remains unchanged) to another DNA helix, whose sequence is altered. Gene conversion has often been studied in fungal crosses where the 4 products of individual meioses can be conveniently observed. Gene conversion events can be distinguished as deviations in an individual meiosis from the normal 2:2 segregation pattern (e.g. a 3:1 pattern).

==Nonhomologous recombination==
Recombination can occur between DNA sequences that contain no sequence homology. This can cause chromosomal translocations, sometimes leading to cancer.

==In B cells==

B cells of the immune system perform genetic recombination, called immunoglobulin class switching. It is a biological mechanism that changes an antibody from one class to another, for example, from an isotype called IgM to an isotype called IgG.

==Genetic engineering==
In genetic engineering, recombination can also refer to artificial and deliberate recombination of disparate pieces of DNA, often from different organisms, creating what is called recombinant DNA. A prime example of such a use of genetic recombination is gene targeting, which can be used to add, delete or otherwise change an organism&#x27;s genes. This technique is important to biomedical researchers as it allows them to study the effects of specific genes. Techniques based on genetic recombination are also applied in protein engineering to develop new proteins of biological interest.

Examples include Restriction enzyme mediated integration, Gibson assembly and Golden Gate Cloning.

==Recombinational repair==
DNA damages caused by a variety of exogenous agents (e.g. UV light, X-rays, chemical cross-linking agents) can be repaired by homologous recombinational repair (HRR). These findings suggest that DNA damages arising from natural processes, such as exposure to reactive oxygen species that are byproducts of normal metabolism, are also repaired by HRR. In humans, deficiencies in the gene products necessary for HRR during meiosis likely cause infertility In humans, deficiencies in gene products necessary for HRR, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, increase the risk of cancer (see DNA repair-deficiency disorder).

In bacteria, transformation is a process of gene transfer that ordinarily occurs between individual cells of the same bacterial species. Transformation involves integration of donor DNA into the recipient chromosome by recombination. This process appears to be an adaptation for repairing DNA damages in the recipient chromosome by HRR. Transformation may provide a benefit to pathogenic bacteria by allowing repair of DNA damage, particularly damages that occur in the inflammatory, oxidizing environment associated with infection of a host.

When two or more viruses, each containing lethal genomic damages, infect the same host cell, the virus genomes can often pair with each other and undergo HRR to produce viable progeny. This process, referred to as multiplicity reactivation, has been studied in lambda and T4 bacteriophages, as well as in several pathogenic viruses. In the case of pathogenic viruses, multiplicity reactivation may be an adaptive benefit to the virus since it allows the repair of DNA damages caused by exposure to the oxidizing environment produced during host infection. See also reassortment.

==Meiotic recombination==
A molecular model for the mechanism of meiotic recombination presented by Anderson and Sekelsky is outlined in the first figure in this article. Two of the four chromatids present early in meiosis (prophase I) are paired with each other and able to interact. Recombination, in this model, is initiated by a double-strand break (or gap) shown in the DNA molecule (chromatid) at the top of the figure. Other types of DNA damage may also initiate recombination. For instance, an inter-strand cross-link (caused by exposure to a cross-linking agent such as mitomycin C) can be repaired by HRR.

Two types of recombinant product are produced. Indicated on the right side is a &quot;crossover&quot; (CO) type, where the flanking regions of the chromosomes are exchanged, and on the left side, a &quot;non-crossover&quot; (NCO) type where the flanking regions are not exchanged. The CO type of recombination involves the intermediate formation of two &quot;Holliday junctions&quot; indicated in the lower right of the figure by two X-shaped structures in each of which there is an exchange of single strands between the two participating chromatids. This pathway is labeled in the figure as the DHJ (double-Holliday junction) pathway.

The NCO recombinants (illustrated on the left in the figure) are produced by a process referred to as &quot;synthesis dependent strand annealing&quot; (SDSA). Recombination events of the NCO/SDSA type appear to be more common than the CO/DHJ type. The NCO/SDSA pathway contributes little to genetic variation, since the arms of the chromosomes flanking the recombination event remain in the parental configuration. Thus, explanations for the adaptive function of meiosis that focus exclusively on crossing-over are inadequate to explain the majority of recombination events.

==Achiasmy and heterochiasmy==
Achiasmy is the phenomenon where autosomal recombination is completely absent in one sex of a species. Achiasmatic chromosomal segregation is well documented in male &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;. The &quot;Haldane-Huxley rule&quot; states that achiasmy usually occurs in the heterogametic sex.

Heterochiasmy occurs when recombination rates differ between the sexes of a species. In humans, each oocyte has on average 41.6 ± 11.3 recombinations, 1.63-fold higher than sperms. This sexual dimorphic pattern in recombination rate has been observed in many species. In mammals, females most often have higher rates of recombination. 

==RNA virus recombination==

Numerous RNA viruses are capable of genetic recombination when at least two viral genomes are present in the same host cell. Recombination is largely responsible for RNA virus diversity and immune evasion. RNA recombination appears to be a major driving force in determining genome architecture and the course of viral evolution among picornaviridae ((+)ssRNA) (e.g. poliovirus). In the retroviridae ((+)ssRNA)(e.g. HIV), damage in the RNA genome appears to be avoided during reverse transcription by strand switching, a form of recombination.

Recombination also occurs in the reoviridae (dsRNA)(e.g. reovirus), orthomyxoviridae ((-)ssRNA)(e.g. influenza virus) and coronaviridae ((+)ssRNA) (e.g. SARS).

Recombination in RNA viruses appears to be an adaptation for coping with genome damage. Switching between template strands during genome replication, referred to as copy-choice recombination, was originally proposed to explain the positive correlation of recombination events over short distances in organisms with a DNA genome (see first Figure, SDSA pathway).

Recombination can occur infrequently between animal viruses of the same species but of divergent lineages. The resulting recombinant viruses may sometimes cause an outbreak of infection in humans.

Especially in coronaviruses, recombination may also occur even among distantly related evolutionary groups (subgenera), due to their characteristic transcription mechanism, that involves subgenomic mRNAs that are formed by template switching.

When replicating its (+)ssRNA genome, the poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is able to carry out recombination. Recombination appears to occur by a copy choice mechanism in which the RdRp switches (+)ssRNA templates during negative strand synthesis. Recombination by RdRp strand switching also occurs in the (+)ssRNA plant carmoviruses and tombusviruses.

Recombination appears to be a major driving force in determining genetic variability within coronaviruses, as well as the ability of coronavirus species to jump from one host to another and, infrequently, for the emergence of novel species, although the mechanism of recombination in is unclear.
In early 2020, many genomic sequences of Australian SARS‐CoV‐2 isolates have deletions or mutations (29742G&gt;A or 29742G&gt;U; &quot;G19A&quot; or &quot;G19U&quot;) in the s2m, suggesting that RNA recombination may have occurred in this RNA element. 29742G(&quot;G19&quot;), 29744G(&quot;G21&quot;), and 29751G(&quot;G28&quot;) were predicted as recombination hotspots. During the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, such a recombination event was suggested to have been a critical step in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2&#x27;s ability to infect humans. Linkage disequilibrium analysis confirmed that RNA recombination with the 11083G &gt; T mutation also contributed to the increase of mutations among the viral progeny. The findings indicate that the 11083G &gt; T mutation of SARS-CoV-2 spread during Diamond Princess shipboard quarantine and arose through de novo RNA recombination under positive selection pressure. In three patients on the &quot;Diamond Princess&quot; cruise, two mutations, 29736G &gt; T and 29751G &gt; T (G13 and G28) were located in Coronavirus 3′ stem-loop II-like motif (s2m) of SARS-CoV-2. Although s2m is considered an RNA motif highly conserved in 3&#x27; untranslated region among many coronavirus species, this result also suggests that s2m of SARS-CoV-2 is RNA recombination/mutation hotspot. SARS-CoV-2&#x27;s entire receptor binding motif appeared, based on preliminary observations, to have been introduced through recombination from coronaviruses of pangolins. However, more comprehensive analyses later refuted this suggestion and showed that SARS-CoV-2 likely evolved solely within bats and with little or no recombination.

==Role of recombination in the origin of life==
Nowak and Ohtsuki noted that the origin of life (abiogenesis) is also the origin of biological evolution. They pointed out that all known life on earth is based on biopolymers and proposed that any theory for the origin of life must involve biological polymers that act as information carriers and catalysts. Lehman argued that recombination was an evolutionary development as ancient as the origins of life. Smail et al. proposed that in the primordial Earth, recombination played a key role in the expansion of the initially short informational polymers (presumed to be RNA) that were the precursors to life.

<text>The States&#x27; Rights Democratic Party (whose members are often called the Dixiecrats), also colloquially referred to as the Dixiecrat Party, was a short-lived segregationist, States&#x27; Rights, and old southern democratic political party in the United States, active primarily in the South. It arose due to a Southern regional split in opposition to the national Democratic Party. After President Harry S. Truman, the leader of the Democratic Party, ordered integration of the military in 1948 and other actions to address civil rights of African Americans, including the first presidential proposal for comprehensive civil and voting rights, many Southern white politicians who objected to this course organized themselves as a breakaway faction. They wished to protect the ability of states to decide on racial segregation. Its members were referred to as &quot;Dixiecrats&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;Dixie&quot;, referring to the Southern United States, and &quot;Democrat&quot;.

In the 1930s, a political realignment occurred largely due to the New Deal policies of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. While many Democrats in the South supported substantive economic intervention, civil rights for African Americans were not specifically incorporated within the New Deal agenda, due in part to Southern control over many key positions of power within the U.S. Congress. Supporters assumed control of the state Democratic parties in part or in full in several Southern states. They opposed racial integration and wanted to retain Jim Crow laws and other aspects of &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot; racial discrimination. On non-racial issues, they held heterogeneous beliefs. Despite the Dixiecrats&#x27; success in several states, Truman was narrowly re-elected. After the 1948 election, its leaders generally returned to the Democratic Party, at least for a time, although the Dixiecrats weakened Democratic identity among white Southerners. The Dixiecrats&#x27; standard bearer, Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, eventually switched to the Republican Party in 1964, in opposition to national civil rights legislation.

== Background (1865–1948) ==

Since the beginning of Reconstruction, Southern white voters supported the Democratic Party by overwhelming margins in both local and national elections, (the few exceptions include minor pockets of Republican electoral strength in Appalachia, East Tennessee in particular, Gillespie and Kendall Counties of central Texas) forming what was known as the &quot;Solid South&quot;. Even during the last years of Reconstruction, Democrats used paramilitary insurgents and other activists to disrupt and intimidate Republican freedman voters, including fraud at the polls and attacks on their leaders. The electoral violence culminated in the Democrats regaining control of the state legislatures and passing new constitutions and laws from 1890 to 1908 to disenfranchise most blacks and many poor whites. They also imposed Jim Crow, a combination of legal and informal segregation acts that made blacks second-class citizens, confirming their lack of political power through most of the southern United States. The social and economic systems of the Solid South were based on this structure, although the white Democrats retained all the Congressional seats apportioned for the total population of their states. Three-time Democratic Party presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan opposed a highly controversial resolution at the 1924 Democratic National Convention condemning the Ku Klux Klan, expecting the organization would soon fold. Bryan disliked the Klan but never publicly attacked it.

In the 1930s, a political realignment occurred largely due to the New Deal policies of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. While many Democrats in the South had shifted toward favoring economic intervention, civil rights for African Americans was not specifically incorporated within the New Deal agenda, due in part to Southern control over many key positions of power within the U.S. Congress. Nonetheless, civil rights gained an outspoken champion in First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and supportive approaches from the administration&#x27;s &quot;Black Cabinet&quot;.

With the entry of the United States into the Second World War, Jim Crow was indirectly challenged. More than one and a half million black Americans served in the U.S. military during World War II, where they received equal pay while serving within segregated units. (While equally entitled to receive veterans&#x27; benefits after the war, the vast majority of African American veterans were prevented from accessing most benefits due in part to Southern success in congress to have benefits administered by the states instead of the federal government.) Tens of thousands of black civilians at home were recruited in the labor-starved war industries across many urban centers in the country, mainly due to the promotion of Executive Order 8802, which required defense industries not to discriminate based on ethnicity or race.

Members of the Republican Party (which nominated Governor of New York Thomas E. Dewey in 1944 and 1948), along with many Democrats from the northern and western states, supported civil rights legislation that the Deep South Democrats in Congress almost unanimously opposed. Southern Democratic ideology on non-racial issues was heterogeneous. Some such as Fielding L. Wright supported the tenets of the New Deal, others such as Harry F. Byrd joined the conservative coalition. The Dixiecrats&#x27; presidential candidate, Strom Thurmond, became a Republican in 1964, as the Republican standard bearer opposed civil rights laws. The Dixiecrats represented the weakening of the &quot;Solid South&quot;. (This referred to the Southern Democratic Party&#x27;s control of presidential elections in the South and most seats in Congress, partly through decades of disfranchisement of blacks entrenched by Southern state legislatures between 1890 and 1908.) The Republicans of the lily-white movement in the South also turned against blacks. Blacks had formerly been aligned with the Republican Party before being excluded from politics in the region, but during the Great Migration African Americans had found the Democratic Party in the North, West and the national Democratic party more suited to their interests.

==1948 presidential election==

After Roosevelt died, the new president Harry S. Truman established a highly visible President&#x27;s Committee on Civil Rights and issued Executive Order 9981 to end discrimination in the military in 1948. A group of Southern governors, including Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and Fielding L. Wright of Mississippi, met to consider the place of Southerners within the Democratic Party. After a tense meeting with Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairman and Truman confidant J. Howard McGrath, the Southern governors agreed to convene their own convention in Birmingham, Alabama if Truman and civil rights supporters emerged victorious at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. In July, the convention nominated Truman to run for a full term and adopted a plank proposed by Northern liberals led by Hubert Humphrey calling for civil rights; 35 Southern delegates walked out. The move was on to remove Truman&#x27;s name from the ballot in the southern United States. This political maneuvering required the organization of a new and distinct political party, which the Southern defectors from the Democratic Party chose to brand as the States&#x27; Rights Democratic Party.

Just days after the 1948 Democratic National Convention, the States&#x27; Rights Democrats held their own convention at Municipal Auditorium in Birmingham, on July 17. While several leaders from the Deep South such as Strom Thurmond and James Eastland attended, most major Southern Democrats did not attend the conference. Among those absent were Georgia Senator Richard Russell Jr., who had finished with the second-most delegates in the Democratic presidential ballot.
Prior to their own States&#x27; Rights Democratic Party convention, it was not clear whether the Dixiecrats would seek to field their own candidate or simply try to prevent Southern electors from voting for Truman. Many in the press predicted that if the Dixiecrats did nominate a ticket, Arkansas Governor Benjamin Travis Laney would be the presidential nominee, and South Carolina Governor Strom Thurmond or Mississippi Governor Fielding L. Wright the vice presidential nominee. Laney traveled to Birmingham during the convention, but he ultimately decided that he did not want to join a third party and remained in his hotel during the convention. Thurmond himself had doubts about a third-party bid, but party organizers convinced him to accept the party&#x27;s nomination, with Fielding Wright as his running mate. Wright&#x27;s supporters had hoped that Wright would lead the ticket, but Wright deferred to Thurmond, who had greater national stature. The selection of Thurmond received fairly positive reviews from the national press, as Thurmond had pursued relatively moderate policies on civil rights and did not employ the fiery rhetoric used by other segregationist leaders.

The States&#x27; Rights Democrats did not formally declare themselves as being a new third party, but rather said that they were only &quot;recommending&quot; that state Democratic Parties vote for the Thurmond–Wright ticket. The goal of the party was to win the 127 electoral votes of the Solid South, in the hopes of denying Truman–Barkley or Dewey–Warren an overall majority of electoral votes, and thus throwing the presidential election to the United States House of Representatives and the vice presidential election to the United States Senate. Once in the House and Senate, the Dixiecrats hoped to throw their support to whichever party would agree to their segregationist demands. Even if the Republican ticket won an outright majority of electoral votes (as many expected in 1948), the Dixiecrats hoped that their third-party run would help the South retake its dominant position in the Democratic Party. In implementing their strategy, the States&#x27; Rights Democrats faced a complicated set of state election laws, with different states having different processes for choosing presidential electors. The States&#x27; Rights Democrats eventually succeeded in making the Thurmond–Wright ticket the official Democratic ticket in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. In other states, they were forced to run as a third-party ticket.

In numbers greater than the 6,000 that attended the first, the States&#x27; Rights Democrats held a boisterous second convention in Oklahoma City, on August 14, 1948, where they adopted their party platform which stated:

The platform went on to say:

In Arkansas, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Sid McMath vigorously supported Truman in speeches across the state, much to the consternation of the sitting governor, Benjamin Travis Laney, an ardent Thurmond supporter. Laney later used McMath&#x27;s pro-Truman stance against him in the 1950 gubernatorial election, but McMath won re-election handily. Efforts by States&#x27; Rights Democrats to paint other Truman loyalists as turncoats generally failed, although the seeds of discontent were planted which in years to come took their toll on Southern moderates. On election day in 1948, the Thurmond–Wright ticket carried the previously solidly Democratic states of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina, receiving 1,169,021 popular votes and 39 electoral votes. Progressive Party presidential nominee Henry A. Wallace drew off a nearly equal number of popular votes (1,157,172) from the Democrats&#x27; left wing, although he did not carry any states. The splits in the Democratic Party in the 1948 election had been expected to produce a victory by GOP presidential nominee Dewey, but Truman defeated Dewey in an upset victory.

== Subsequent elections ==
The States&#x27; Rights Democratic Party collapsed after the 1948 election, as Truman, the Democratic National Committee, and the New Deal Southern Democrats acted to ensure that the Dixiecrat movement would not return in the 1952 presidential election. Some Southern diehards, such as Leander Perez of Louisiana, attempted to keep it in existence in their districts. Wright continued to defend racial segregation, but conceded that complete obstinance along the lines of the 1948 departure from the Democratic Party would cause his home state of Mississippi to lose &quot;its standing with everybody in America.&quot; Former Dixiecrats received some backlash at the 1952 Democratic National Convention, but all Southern delegations were seated after agreeing to a party loyalty pledge. Segregationist Alabama Senator John Sparkman was selected as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee in 1952, helping to boost party loyalty in the South.

=== Legacy ===
The Dixiecrats are considered to have begun the weakening of the Democratic Solid South. 

Regardless of the power struggle within the Democratic Party concerning segregation policy, the South remained a strongly Democratic voting bloc for local, state, and federal Congressional elections, but increasingly not in presidential elections. Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower won several Southern states in the 1952 and 1956 presidential elections. In the 1956 election, former Commissioner of Internal Revenue T. Coleman Andrews received just under 0.2 percent of the popular vote running as the presidential nominee of the States&#x27; Rights Party. In the 1960 presidential election, Republican Richard Nixon won several Southern states, and Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia received the votes of several unpledged electors from Alabama and Mississippi. In the 1964 presidential election, Republican Barry Goldwater won all four states that Thurmond had carried in 1948. In the 1968 presidential election, Republican Richard Nixon or third-party candidate George Wallace won every former Confederate state except Texas. Thurmond eventually left the Democratic Party and joined the Republican Party in 1964, charging the Democrats with having &quot;abandoned the people&quot; and having repudiated the U.S. Constitution; he subsequently worked on the presidential campaign of Barry Goldwater. Within the next few decades, a realignment took place whereby most conservatives (economic, cultural, and racial conservatives included) migrated to the Republican Party, with liberals on the same issues going to the Democrats, resulting in more heterogenous national platforms. The Southern states subsequently shifted over time to voting mainly Republican, with the Northeast switching to voting mainly Democratic. 

By the early 2010s, statistician and political analyst Nate Cohn wrote of the &quot;demise of the Southern Democrat&quot;.

<text>Barnabe Barnes (c. 1571 – 1609) was an English poet. He is known for his Petrarchan love sonnets and for his combative personality, involving feuds with other writers and culminating in an alleged attempted murder.

==Early life==
The third son of Dr Richard Barnes, bishop of Durham, he was baptised in York at the church of St Michael le Belfry on 6 March 1571. In 1586 he was entered at Brasenose College, Oxford, but did not take his degree. His father died in 1587 leaving two-thirds of his estate to be divided among his six children, and Barnes appears to have been able to live on income from this bequest. In 1591 he went to France with the earl of Essex, who was then serving against the prince of Parma. On his return he published &quot;Parthenophil and Parthenophe, Sonnettes, Madrigals, Elegies and Odes&quot; (ent. on Stationers&#x27; Register 1593), dedicated to his &quot;dearest friend,&quot; the poet and nobleman William Percy, who contributed a sonnet to the eulogies prefixed to a later work, &quot;Offices&quot;. &quot;Parthenophil&quot; was possibly printed for private circulation, and the copy in the duke of Devonshire&#x27;s library is believed to be unique.

==Sonnets==
Barnabe Barnes was well acquainted with the work of contemporary French sonneteers, to whom he is largely indebted, and he borrows his title, apparently, from a Neapolitan writer of Latin verse, Hieronymus Angerianus. &quot;Parthenophil and Parthenophe&quot; are the names given to the two protagonists in the sonnets, the first name meaning &quot;virgin-lover&quot; and the second &quot;virgin&quot;. It is possible to outline a story from this series of love lyrics, but the incidents are slight, and in this case, as in other Elizabethan sonnet-cycles, it is difficult to dogmatise as to what is the expression of a real personal experience, and what is intellectual exercise in imitation of Petrarch. &quot;Parthenophil&quot; abounds in passages of great freshness and beauty, although its elaborate conceits are sometimes over-ingenious and strained. For example, the passage in which Parthenophil wishes to be transformed into the wine his mistress drinks, so that he might pass through her, excited the derision of at least one hostile contemporary critic, Thomas Nashe.

The sequence also has a highly unusual ending: the lover Parthenophil dreams that he uses black magic to compel his unattainable mistress to appear to him naked, whereupon he rapes her. This is such a reversal of Petrarchan convention that it has been interpreted as possibly reflecting contemporary political tensions. John Cox suggests that it is linked to the unfolding conflict between the Earl of Essex and Queen Elizabeth, in which Parthenophe stands for Elizabeth: &quot;Since Parthenophe means virgin Barnes&#x27;s dream seems unavoidably political, and the stance of frustrated expectation, occasioned by an unyielding and unapproachable female, seems appropriate to one of Essex&#x27;s party in the early 1590s.&quot;

==Feuds and attempted murder==
Barnes became involved in the pamphlet feud between Gabriel Harvey and Thomas Nashe. Barnes took the part of Harvey, who wanted to impose the Latin rules of quantity on English verse: Barnes even experimented in classical metres himself. This partisanship is sufficient to account for the abuse of Nashe, who accused him, apparently on no proof at all, of stealing a nobleman&#x27;s chain at Windsor, and of other things. Prior to this literary assault Barnes had written a sonnet for Harvey&#x27;s anti-Nashe pamphlet &quot;Pierces Supererogation&quot; (1593), in which he labelled Nashe a confidence trickster, a liar, a viper, a laughing stock and mere &quot;worthless matter&quot; who should be flattered that Harvey even deigned to insult him. Nashe, never slow to pick a fight, took due note: &quot;But my young master Barnaby the Bright, and his kindness (before any desert at all of mine towards him might pluck him on or provoke it), I neither have nor will be unmindful of.&quot; He therefore responded in kind in &quot;Have with You to Saffron-Walden&quot; (1596) with various observations on Barnes: he was a bad poet, he had dreadful dress sense (&quot;getting him a strange pair of Babylonian britches, with a codpiece as big as a Bolognian sausage&quot;) and had been a coward on the field of battle during the wars in France. Nashe claimed, not entirely seriously, that Barnes had gone to the general to complain war was dangerous, highly illegal and he wanted to go home at once, and despite six burly captains offering to be his personal bodyguard &quot;home he would, nothing would stay him, to finish &quot;Parthenophil and Parthenope&quot; and write in praise of Gabriel Harvey.&quot;

These charges may well be comic fabrications. It is however on record that Barnes was prosecuted in Star Chamber in 1598 for attempting to murder one John Browne, first by offering him a poisoned lemon and then by sweetening his wine with sugar laced with mercury sublimate. Browne fortunately survived the attack and Barnes fled prison before the case concluded. He was not pursued. It seems likely he attempted Browne&#x27;s assassination at the behest of Lord Eure, warden of the Middle March and of Berwick upon Tweed, and political stringpulling protected him.

==Later works==
Barnes&#x27;s second work, &quot;A Divine Centurie of Spirituall Sonnetts&quot;, appeared in 1595. He also wrote two plays: &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Charter&quot; (1607), a tragedy dealing with the life of Pope Alexander VI, which was played before the king; and &quot;The Battle of Evesham&quot; (or Hexham), of which the manuscript, traced to the beginning of the 18th century, is lost. In 1606 he dedicated to King James &quot;Offices enabling privat Persons for the special service of all good Princes and Policies&quot;, a prose treatise containing, among other things, descriptions of Queen Elizabeth and of the earl of Essex. Barnabe Barnes was buried at Durham in December 1609.

<text>The lipid bilayer (or phospholipid bilayer) is a thin polar membrane made of two layers of lipid molecules. These membranes form a continuous barrier around all cells. The cell membranes of almost all organisms and many viruses are made of a lipid bilayer, as are the nuclear membrane surrounding the cell nucleus, and membranes of the membrane-bound organelles in the cell. The lipid bilayer is the barrier that keeps ions, proteins and other molecules where they are needed and prevents them from diffusing into areas where they should not be. Lipid bilayers are ideally suited to this role, even though they are only a few nanometers in width, because they are impermeable to most water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules. Bilayers are particularly impermeable to ions, which allows cells to regulate salt concentrations and pH by transporting ions across their membranes using proteins called ion pumps.

Biological bilayers are usually composed of amphiphilic phospholipids that have a hydrophilic phosphate head and a hydrophobic tail consisting of two fatty acid chains. Phospholipids with certain head groups can alter the surface chemistry of a bilayer and can, for example, serve as signals as well as &quot;anchors&quot; for other molecules in the membranes of cells. Just like the heads, the tails of lipids can also affect membrane properties, for instance by determining the phase of the bilayer. The bilayer can adopt a solid gel phase state at lower temperatures but undergo phase transition to a fluid state at higher temperatures, and the chemical properties of the lipids&#x27; tails influence at which temperature this happens. The packing of lipids within the bilayer also affects its mechanical properties, including its resistance to stretching and bending. Many of these properties have been studied with the use of artificial &quot;model&quot; bilayers produced in a lab. Vesicles made by model bilayers have also been used clinically to deliver drugs.

The structure of biological membranes typically includes several types of molecules in addition to the phospholipids comprising the bilayer. A particularly important example in animal cells is cholesterol, which helps strengthen the bilayer and decrease its permeability. Cholesterol also helps regulate the activity of certain integral membrane proteins. Integral membrane proteins function when incorporated into a lipid bilayer, and they are held tightly to the lipid bilayer with the help of an annular lipid shell. Because bilayers define the boundaries of the cell and its compartments, these membrane proteins are involved in many intra- and inter-cellular signaling processes. Certain kinds of membrane proteins are involved in the process of fusing two bilayers together. This fusion allows the joining of two distinct structures as in the acrosome reaction during fertilization of an egg by a sperm, or the entry of a virus into a cell. Because lipid bilayers are fragile and invisible in a traditional microscope, they are a challenge to study. Experiments on bilayers often require advanced techniques like electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy.

== Structure and organization ==

When phospholipids are exposed to water, they self-assemble into a two-layered sheet with the hydrophobic tails pointing toward the center of the sheet. This arrangement results in two &#x27;leaflets&#x27; that are each a single molecular layer. The center of this bilayer contains almost no water and excludes molecules like sugars or salts that dissolve in water. The assembly process and maintenance are driven by aggregation of hydrophobic molecules (also called the hydrophobic effect). This complex process includes non-covalent interactions such as van der Waals forces, electrostatic and hydrogen bonds.

=== Cross-section analysis ===

The lipid bilayer is very thin compared to its lateral dimensions. If a typical mammalian cell (diameter ~10 micrometers) were magnified to the size of a watermelon (~1 ft/30 cm), the lipid bilayer making up the plasma membrane would be about as thick as a piece of office paper. Despite being only a few nanometers thick, the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section. These regions and their interactions with the surrounding water have been characterized over the past several decades with x-ray reflectometry, neutron scattering, and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.

The first region on either side of the bilayer is the hydrophilic headgroup. This portion of the membrane is completely hydrated and is typically around 0.8-0.9 nm thick. In phospholipid bilayers the phosphate group is located within this hydrated region, approximately 0.5 nm outside the hydrophobic core. In some cases, the hydrated region can extend much further, for instance in lipids with a large protein or long sugar chain grafted to the head. One common example of such a modification in nature is the lipopolysaccharide coat on a bacterial outer membrane.

Next to the hydrated region is an intermediate region that is only partially hydrated. This boundary layer is approximately 0.3 nm thick. Within this short distance, the water concentration drops from 2M on the headgroup side to nearly zero on the tail (core) side. The hydrophobic core of the bilayer is typically 3-4 nm thick, but this value varies with chain length and chemistry. Core thickness also varies significantly with temperature, in particular near a phase transition.

===Asymmetry===
In many naturally occurring bilayers, the compositions of the inner and outer membrane leaflets are different. In human red blood cells, the inner (cytoplasmic) leaflet is composed mostly of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol and its phosphorylated derivatives. By contrast, the outer (extracellular) leaflet is based on phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and a variety of glycolipids. In some cases, this asymmetry is based on where the lipids are made in the cell and reflects their initial orientation. The biological functions of lipid asymmetry are imperfectly understood, although it is clear that it is used in several different situations. For example, when a cell undergoes apoptosis, the phosphatidylserine — normally localised to the cytoplasmic leaflet — is transferred to the outer surface: There, it is recognised by a macrophage that then actively scavenges the dying cell.

Lipid asymmetry arises, at least in part, from the fact that most phospholipids are synthesised and initially inserted into the inner monolayer: those that constitute the outer monolayer are then transported from the inner monolayer by a class of enzymes called flippases. Other lipids, such as sphingomyelin, appear to be synthesised at the external leaflet. Flippases are members of a larger family of lipid transport molecules that also includes floppases, which transfer lipids in the opposite direction, and scramblases, which randomize lipid distribution across lipid bilayers (as in apoptotic cells). In any case, once lipid asymmetry is established, it does not normally dissipate quickly because spontaneous flip-flop of lipids between leaflets is extremely slow.

It is possible to mimic this asymmetry in the laboratory in model bilayer systems. Certain types of very small artificial vesicle will automatically make themselves slightly asymmetric, although the mechanism by which this asymmetry is generated is very different from that in cells. By utilizing two different monolayers in Langmuir-Blodgett deposition or a combination of Langmuir-Blodgett and vesicle rupture deposition it is also possible to synthesize an asymmetric planar bilayer. This asymmetry may be lost over time as lipids in supported bilayers can be prone to flip-flop. However, it has been reported that lipid flip-flop is slow compare to cholesterol and other smaller molecules.

It has been reported that the organization and dynamics of the lipid monolayers in a bilayer are coupled. For example, introduction of obstructions in one monolayer can slow down the lateral diffusion in both monolayers. In addition, phase separation in one monolayer can also induce phase separation in other monolayer even when other monolayer can not phase separate by itself.

=== Phases and phase transitions ===

At a given temperature a lipid bilayer can exist in either a liquid or a gel (solid) phase. All lipids have a characteristic temperature at which they transition (melt) from the gel to liquid phase. In both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer, but in liquid phase bilayers a given lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second. This random walk exchange allows lipid to diffuse and thus wander across the surface of the membrane.Unlike liquid phase bilayers, the lipids in a gel phase bilayer have less mobility. 

The phase behavior of lipid bilayers is determined largely by the strength of the attractive Van der Waals interactions between adjacent lipid molecules. Longer-tailed lipids have more area over which to interact, increasing the strength of this interaction and, as a consequence, decreasing the lipid mobility. Thus, at a given temperature, a short-tailed lipid will be more fluid than an otherwise identical long-tailed lipid. Transition temperature can also be affected by the degree of unsaturation of the lipid tails. An unsaturated double bond can produce a kink in the alkane chain, disrupting the lipid packing. This disruption creates extra free space within the bilayer that allows additional flexibility in the adjacent chains. An example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter, which has a large percentage saturated fats, is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil, which is mostly unsaturated, is liquid.

Most natural membranes are a complex mixture of different lipid molecules. If some of the components are liquid at a given temperature while others are in the gel phase, the two phases can coexist in spatially separated regions, rather like an iceberg floating in the ocean. This phase separation plays a critical role in biochemical phenomena because membrane components such as proteins can partition into one or the other phase and thus be locally concentrated or activated. One particularly important component of many mixed phase systems is cholesterol, which modulates bilayer permeability, mechanical strength, and biochemical interactions.

===Surface chemistry===
While lipid tails primarily modulate bilayer phase behavior, it is the headgroup that determines the bilayer surface chemistry. Most natural bilayers are composed primarily of phospholipids, but sphingolipids and sterols such as cholesterol are also important components. Of the phospholipids, the most common headgroup is phosphatidylcholine (PC), accounting for about half the phospholipids in most mammalian cells. PC is a zwitterionic headgroup, as it has a negative charge on the phosphate group and a positive charge on the amine but, because these local charges balance, no net charge.

Other headgroups are also present to varying degrees and can include phosphatidylserine (PS) phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). These alternate headgroups often confer specific biological functionality that is highly context-dependent. For instance, PS presence on the extracellular membrane face of erythrocytes is a marker of cell apoptosis, whereas PS in growth plate vesicles is necessary for the nucleation of hydroxyapatite crystals and subsequent bone mineralization. Unlike PC, some of the other headgroups carry a net charge, which can alter the electrostatic interactions of small molecules with the bilayer.

==Biological roles==
===Containment and separation===
The primary role of the lipid bilayer in biology is to separate aqueous compartments from their surroundings. Without some form of barrier delineating “self” from “non-self”, it is difficult to even define the concept of an organism or of life. This barrier takes the form of a lipid bilayer in all known life forms except for a few species of archaea that utilize a specially adapted lipid monolayer. It has even been proposed that the very first form of life may have been a simple lipid vesicle with virtually its sole biosynthetic capability being the production of more phospholipids. The partitioning ability of the lipid bilayer is based on the fact that hydrophilic molecules cannot easily cross the hydrophobic bilayer core, as discussed in Transport across the bilayer below. The nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts have two lipid bilayers, while other sub-cellular structures are surrounded by a single lipid bilayer (such as the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticula, Golgi apparatus and lysosomes). See Organelle.

Prokaryotes have only one lipid bilayer - the cell membrane (also known as the plasma membrane). Many prokaryotes also have a cell wall, but the cell wall is composed of proteins or long chain carbohydrates, not lipids. In contrast, eukaryotes have a range of organelles including the nucleus, mitochondria, lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum. All of these sub-cellular compartments are surrounded by one or more lipid bilayers and, together, typically comprise the majority of the bilayer area present in the cell. In liver hepatocytes for example, the plasma membrane accounts for only two percent of the total bilayer area of the cell, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum contains more than fifty percent and the mitochondria a further thirty percent.
=== Signaling ===

The most familiar form of cellular signaling is likely synaptic transmission, whereby a nerve impulse that has reached the end of one neuron is conveyed to an adjacent neuron via the release of neurotransmitters. This transmission is made possible by the action of synaptic vesicles which are, inside the cell, loaded with the neurotransmitters to be released later. These loaded vesicles fuse with the cell membrane at the pre-synaptic terminal and their contents are released into the space outside the cell. The contents then diffuse across the synapse to the post-synaptic terminal.

Lipid bilayers are also involved in signal transduction through their role as the home of integral membrane proteins. This is an extremely broad and important class of biomolecule. It is estimated that up to a third of the human proteome are membrane proteins. Some of these proteins are linked to the exterior of the cell membrane. An example of this is the CD59 protein, which identifies cells as “self” and thus inhibits their destruction by the immune system. The HIV virus evades the immune system in part by grafting these proteins from the host membrane onto its own surface. Alternatively, some membrane proteins penetrate all the way through the bilayer and serve to relay individual signal events from the outside to the inside of the cell. The most common class of this type of protein is the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). GPCRs are responsible for much of the cell&#x27;s ability to sense its surroundings and, because of this important role, approximately 40% of all modern drugs are targeted at GPCRs.

In addition to protein- and solution-mediated processes, it is also possible for lipid bilayers to participate directly in signaling. A classic example of this is phosphatidylserine-triggered phagocytosis. Normally, phosphatidylserine is asymmetrically distributed in the cell membrane and is present only on the interior side. During programmed cell death a protein called a scramblase equilibrates this distribution, displaying phosphatidylserine on the extracellular bilayer face. The presence of phosphatidylserine then triggers phagocytosis to remove the dead or dying cell.

==Characterization methods==

The lipid bilayer is a difficult structure to study because it is so thin and fragile. To overcome these limitations, techniques have been developed to allow investigations of its structure and function.

===Electrical measurements===

Electrical measurements are a straightforward way to characterize an important function of a bilayer: its ability to segregate and prevent the flow of ions in solution. By applying a voltage across the bilayer and measuring the resulting current, the resistance of the bilayer is determined. This resistance is typically quite high (108 Ohm-cm2 or more) since the hydrophobic core is impermeable to charged species. The presence of even a few nanometer-scale holes results in a dramatic increase in current. The sensitivity of this system is such that even the activity of single ion channels can be resolved.

===Fluorescence microscopy===

A lipid bilayer cannot be seen with a traditional microscope because it is too thin, so researchers often use fluorescence microscopy. A sample is excited with one wavelength of light and observed in another, so that only fluorescent molecules with a matching excitation and emission profile will be seen. A natural lipid bilayer is not fluorescent, so at least one fluorescent dye needs to be attached to some of the molecules in the bilayer. Resolution is usually limited to a few hundred nanometers, which is unfortunately much larger than the thickness of a lipid bilayer.

===Electron microscopy===

Electron microscopy offers a higher resolution image. In an electron microscope, a beam of focused electrons interacts with the sample rather than a beam of light as in traditional microscopy. In conjunction with rapid freezing techniques, electron microscopy has also been used to study the mechanisms of inter- and intracellular transport, for instance in demonstrating that exocytotic vesicles are the means of chemical release at synapses.

=== Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ===

31P-Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is widely used for studies of phospholipid bilayers and biological membranes in native conditions. The analysis of 31P-NMR spectra of lipids could provide a wide range of information about lipid bilayer packing, phase transitions (gel phase, physiological liquid crystal phase, ripple phases, non bilayer phases), lipid head group orientation/dynamics, and elastic properties of pure lipid bilayer and as a result of binding of proteins and other biomolecules.

===Atomic force microscopy===
A new method to study lipid bilayers is Atomic force microscopy (AFM). Rather than using a beam of light or particles, a very small sharpened tip scans the surface by making physical contact with the bilayer and moving across it, like a record player needle. AFM is a promising technique because it has the potential to image with nanometer resolution at room temperature and even under water or physiological buffer, conditions necessary for natural bilayer behavior. Utilizing this capability, AFM has been used to examine dynamic bilayer behavior including the formation of transmembrane pores (holes) and phase transitions in supported bilayers. Another advantage is that AFM does not require fluorescent or isotopic labeling of the lipids, since the probe tip interacts mechanically with the bilayer surface. Because of this, the same scan can image both lipids and associated proteins, sometimes even with single-molecule resolution. AFM can also probe the mechanical nature of lipid bilayers.

=== Dual polarisation interferometry ===

Lipid bilayers exhibit high levels of birefringence where the refractive index in the plane of the bilayer differs from that perpendicular by as much as 0.1 refractive index units. This has been used to characterise the degree of order and disruption in bilayers using dual polarisation interferometry to understand mechanisms of protein interaction.

===Quantum chemical calculations===
Lipid bilayers are complicated molecular systems with many degrees of freedom. Thus, atomistic simulation of membrane and in particular ab initio calculations of its properties is difficult and computationally expensive. Quantum chemical calculations has recently been successfully performed to estimate dipole and quadrupole moments of lipid membranes.

==Transport across the bilayer==
===Passive diffusion===

Most polar molecules have low solubility in the hydrocarbon core of a lipid bilayer and, as a consequence, have low permeability coefficients across the bilayer. This effect is particularly pronounced for charged species, which have even lower permeability coefficients than neutral polar molecules. Anions typically have a higher rate of diffusion through bilayers than cations. Compared to ions, water molecules actually have a relatively large permeability through the bilayer, as evidenced by osmotic swelling. When a cell or vesicle with a high interior salt concentration is placed in a solution with a low salt concentration it will swell and eventually burst. Such a result would not be observed unless water was able to pass through the bilayer with relative ease. The anomalously large permeability of water through bilayers is still not completely understood and continues to be the subject of active debate. Small uncharged apolar molecules diffuse through lipid bilayers many orders of magnitude faster than ions or water. This applies both to fats and organic solvents like chloroform and ether. Regardless of their polar character larger molecules diffuse more slowly across lipid bilayers than small molecules.

===Ion pumps and channels===
Two special classes of protein deal with the ionic gradients found across cellular and sub-cellular membranes in nature- ion channels and ion pumps. Both pumps and channels are integral membrane proteins that pass through the bilayer, but their roles are quite different. Ion pumps are the proteins that build and maintain the chemical gradients by utilizing an external energy source to move ions against the concentration gradient to an area of higher chemical potential. The energy source can be ATP, as is the case for the Na+-K+ ATPase. Alternatively, the energy source can be another chemical gradient already in place, as in the Ca2+/Na+ antiporter. It is through the action of ion pumps that cells are able to regulate pH via the pumping of protons.

In contrast to ion pumps, ion channels do not build chemical gradients but rather dissipate them in order to perform work or send a signal. Probably the most familiar and best studied example is the voltage-gated Na+ channel, which allows conduction of an action potential along neurons. All ion pumps have some sort of trigger or “gating” mechanism. In the previous example it was electrical bias, but other channels can be activated by binding a molecular agonist or through a conformational change in another nearby protein.

===Endocytosis and exocytosis===

Some molecules or particles are too large or too hydrophilic to pass through a lipid bilayer. Other molecules could pass through the bilayer but must be transported rapidly in such large numbers that channel-type transport is impractical. In both cases, these types of cargo can be moved across the cell membrane through fusion or budding of vesicles. When a vesicle is produced inside the cell and fuses with the plasma membrane to release its contents into the extracellular space, this process is known as exocytosis. In the reverse process, a region of the cell membrane will dimple inwards and eventually pinch off, enclosing a portion of the extracellular fluid to transport it into the cell. Endocytosis and exocytosis rely on very different molecular machinery to function, but the two processes are intimately linked and could not work without each other. The primary mechanism of this interdependence is the large amount of lipid material involved. In a typical cell, an area of bilayer equivalent to the entire plasma membrane travels through the endocytosis/exocytosis cycle in about half an hour. 

Exocytosis in prokaryotes: Membrane vesicular exocytosis, popularly known as membrane vesicle trafficking, a Nobel prize-winning (year, 2013) process, is traditionally regarded as a prerogative of eukaryotic cells. This &quot;myth&quot; was however broken with the revelation that nanovesicles, popularly known as bacterial outer membrane vesicles, released by gram-negative microbes, translocate bacterial signal molecules to host or target cells to carry out multiple processes in favour of the secreting microbe e.g., in &quot;host cell invasion&quot; and microbe-environment interactions, in general.

===Electroporation===

Electroporation is the rapid increase in bilayer permeability induced by the application of a large artificial electric field across the membrane. Experimentally, electroporation is used to introduce hydrophilic molecules into cells. It is a particularly useful technique for large highly charged molecules such as DNA, which would never passively diffuse across the hydrophobic bilayer core. Because of this, electroporation is one of the key methods of transfection as well as bacterial transformation. It has even been proposed that electroporation resulting from lightning strikes could be a mechanism of natural horizontal gene transfer.

==Mechanics==


Lipid bilayers are large enough structures to have some of the mechanical properties of liquids or solids. The area compression modulus Ka, bending modulus Kb, and edge energy formula_1, can be used to describe them. Solid lipid bilayers also have a shear modulus, but like any liquid, the shear modulus is zero for fluid bilayers. These mechanical properties affect how the membrane functions. Ka and Kb affect the ability of proteins and small molecules to insert into the bilayer, and bilayer mechanical properties have been shown to alter the function of mechanically activated ion channels. Bilayer mechanical properties also govern what types of stress a cell can withstand without tearing. Although lipid bilayers can easily bend, most cannot stretch more than a few percent before rupturing.

As discussed in the Structure and organization section, the hydrophobic attraction of lipid tails in water is the primary force holding lipid bilayers together. Thus, the elastic modulus of the bilayer is primarily determined by how much extra area is exposed to water when the lipid molecules are stretched apart. It is not surprising given this understanding of the forces involved that studies have shown that Ka varies strongly with osmotic pressure but only weakly with tail length and unsaturation. Because the forces involved are so small, it is difficult to experimentally determine Ka. Most techniques require sophisticated microscopy and very sensitive measurement equipment.

In contrast to Ka, which is a measure of how much energy is needed to stretch the bilayer, Kb is a measure of how much energy is needed to bend or flex the bilayer. Formally, bending modulus is defined as the energy required to deform a membrane from its intrinsic curvature to some other curvature. Intrinsic curvature is defined by the ratio of the diameter of the head group to that of the tail group. For two-tailed PC lipids, this ratio is nearly one so the intrinsic curvature is nearly zero. If a particular lipid has too large a deviation from zero intrinsic curvature it will not form a bilayer and will instead form other phases such as micelles or inverted micelles. Addition of small hydrophilic molecules like sucrose into mixed lipid lamellar liposomes made from galactolipid-rich thylakoid membranes destabilises bilayers into the micellar phase. 

formula_1 is a measure of how much energy it takes to expose a bilayer edge to water by tearing the bilayer or creating a hole in it. The origin of this energy is the fact that creating such an interface exposes some of the lipid tails to water, but the exact orientation of these border lipids is unknown. There is some evidence that both hydrophobic (tails straight) and hydrophilic (heads curved around) pores can coexist.

==Fusion==

Fusion is the process by which two lipid bilayers merge, resulting in one connected structure. If this fusion proceeds completely through both leaflets of both bilayers, a water-filled bridge is formed and the solutions contained by the bilayers can mix. Alternatively, if only one leaflet from each bilayer is involved in the fusion process, the bilayers are said to be hemifused. Fusion is involved in many cellular processes, in particular in eukaryotes, since the eukaryotic cell is extensively sub-divided by lipid bilayer membranes. Exocytosis, fertilization of an egg by sperm activation, and transport of waste products to the lysozome are a few of the many eukaryotic processes that rely on some form of fusion. Even the entry of pathogens can be governed by fusion, as many bilayer-coated viruses have dedicated fusion proteins to gain entry into the host cell.

There are four fundamental steps in the fusion process. First, the involved membranes must aggregate, approaching each other to within several nanometers. Second, the two bilayers must come into very close contact (within a few angstroms). To achieve this close contact, the two surfaces must become at least partially dehydrated, as the bound surface water normally present causes bilayers to strongly repel. The presence of ions, in particular divalent cations like magnesium and calcium, strongly affects this step. One of the critical roles of calcium in the body is regulating membrane fusion. Third, a destabilization must form at one point between the two bilayers, locally distorting their structures. The exact nature of this distortion is not known. One theory is that a highly curved &quot;stalk&quot; must form between the two bilayers. Proponents of this theory believe that it explains why phosphatidylethanolamine, a highly curved lipid, promotes fusion. Finally, in the last step of fusion, this point defect grows and the components of the two bilayers mix and diffuse away from the site of contact.

The situation is further complicated when considering fusion &quot;in vivo&quot; since biological fusion is almost always regulated by the action of membrane-associated proteins. The first of these proteins to be studied were the viral fusion proteins, which allow an enveloped virus to insert its genetic material into the host cell (enveloped viruses are those surrounded by a lipid bilayer; some others have only a protein coat). Eukaryotic cells also use fusion proteins, the best-studied of which are the SNAREs. SNARE proteins are used to direct all vesicular intracellular trafficking. Despite years of study, much is still unknown about the function of this protein class. In fact, there is still an active debate regarding whether SNAREs are linked to early docking or participate later in the fusion process by facilitating hemifusion.

In studies of molecular and cellular biology it is often desirable to artificially induce fusion. The addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) causes fusion without significant aggregation or biochemical disruption. This procedure is now used extensively, for example by fusing B-cells with myeloma cells. The resulting “hybridoma” from this combination expresses a desired antibody as determined by the B-cell involved, but is immortalized due to the melanoma component. Fusion can also be artificially induced through electroporation in a process known as electrofusion. It is believed that this phenomenon results from the energetically active edges formed during electroporation, which can act as the local defect point to nucleate stalk growth between two bilayers.

==Model systems==

Lipid bilayers can be created artificially in the lab to allow researchers to perform experiments that cannot be done with natural bilayers. They can also be used in the field of Synthetic Biology, to define the boundaries of artificial cells. These synthetic systems are called model lipid bilayers. There are many different types of model bilayers, each having experimental advantages and disadvantages. They can be made with either synthetic or natural lipids. Among the most common model systems are:

* Black lipid membranes (BLM)
* Supported lipid bilayers (SLB)

* Vesicles
* Droplet Interface Bilayers (DIBs)

==Commercial applications==
To date, the most successful commercial application of lipid bilayers has been the use of liposomes for drug delivery, especially for cancer treatment. (Note- the term “liposome” is in essence synonymous with “vesicle” except that vesicle is a general term for the structure whereas liposome refers to only artificial not natural vesicles) The basic idea of liposomal drug delivery is that the drug is encapsulated in solution inside the liposome then injected into the patient. These drug-loaded liposomes travel through the system until they bind at the target site and rupture, releasing the drug. In theory, liposomes should make an ideal drug delivery system since they can isolate nearly any hydrophilic drug, can be grafted with molecules to target specific tissues and can be relatively non-toxic since the body possesses biochemical pathways for degrading lipids.

The first generation of drug delivery liposomes had a simple lipid composition and suffered from several limitations. Circulation in the bloodstream was extremely limited due to both renal clearing and phagocytosis. Refinement of the lipid composition to tune fluidity, surface charge density, and surface hydration resulted in vesicles that adsorb fewer proteins from serum and thus are less readily recognized by the immune system. The most significant advance in this area was the grafting of polyethylene glycol (PEG) onto the liposome surface to produce “stealth” vesicles, which circulate over long times without immune or renal clearing.

The first stealth liposomes were passively targeted at tumor tissues. Because tumors induce rapid and uncontrolled angiogenesis they are especially “leaky” and allow liposomes to exit the bloodstream at a much higher rate than normal tissue would. More recently work has been undertaken to graft antibodies or other molecular markers onto the liposome surface in the hope of actively binding them to a specific cell or tissue type. Some examples of this approach are already in clinical trials.

Another potential application of lipid bilayers is the field of biosensors. Since the lipid bilayer is the barrier between the interior and exterior of the cell, it is also the site of extensive signal transduction. Researchers over the years have tried to harness this potential to develop a bilayer-based device for clinical diagnosis or bioterrorism detection. Progress has been slow in this area and, although a few companies have developed automated lipid-based detection systems, they are still targeted at the research community. These include Biacore (now GE Healthcare Life Sciences), which offers a disposable chip for utilizing lipid bilayers in studies of binding kinetics and Nanion Inc., which has developed an automated patch clamping system.

A supported lipid bilayer (SLB) as described above has achieved commercial success as a screening technique to measure the permeability of drugs. This parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) technique measures the permeability across specifically formulated lipid cocktail(s) found to be highly correlated with Caco-2 cultures, the gastrointestinal tract, blood–brain barrier and skin.

==History==

By the early twentieth century scientists had come to believe that cells are surrounded by a thin oil-like barrier, but the structural nature of this membrane was not known. Two experiments in 1925 laid the groundwork to fill in this gap. By measuring the capacitance of erythrocyte solutions, Hugo Fricke determined that the cell membrane was 3.3 nm thick.

Although the results of this experiment were accurate, Fricke misinterpreted the data to mean that the cell membrane is a single molecular layer. Prof. Dr. Evert Gorter (1881–1954) and F. Grendel of Leiden University approached the problem from a different perspective, spreading the erythrocyte lipids as a monolayer on a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. When they compared the area of the monolayer to the surface area of the cells, they found a ratio of two to one. Later analyses showed several errors and incorrect assumptions with this experiment but, serendipitously, these errors canceled out and from this flawed data Gorter and Grendel drew the correct conclusion- that the cell membrane is a lipid bilayer.

This theory was confirmed through the use of electron microscopy in the late 1950s. Although he did not publish the first electron microscopy study of lipid bilayers J. David Robertson was the first to assert that the two dark electron-dense bands were the headgroups and associated proteins of two apposed lipid monolayers. In this body of work, Robertson put forward the concept of the “unit membrane.” This was the first time the bilayer structure had been universally assigned to all cell membranes as well as organelle membranes.

Around the same time, the development of model membranes confirmed that the lipid bilayer is a stable structure that can exist independent of proteins. By “painting” a solution of lipid in organic solvent across an aperture, Mueller and Rudin were able to create an artificial bilayer and determine that this exhibited lateral fluidity, high electrical resistance and self-healing in response to puncture, all of which are properties of a natural cell membrane. A few years later, Alec Bangham showed that bilayers, in the form of lipid vesicles, could also be formed simply by exposing a dried lipid sample to water. This demonstrated that lipid bilayers form spontaneously via self assembly and do not require a patterned support structure. In 1977, a totally synthetic bilayer membrane was prepared by Kunitake and Okahata, from a single organic compound, didodecyldimethylammonium bromide. This showed that the bilayer membrane was assembled by the intermolecular forces.

<text>A letter of credence (, ) is a formal diplomatic letter that designates a diplomat as ambassador to another sovereign state. Commonly known as diplomatic credentials, the letter is addressed from one head of state to another, asking them to give credence () to the ambassador&#x27;s claim of speaking for their country. The letter is presented personally by the ambassador-designate to the receiving head of state in a formal ceremony, marking the beginning of the ambassadorship.

Letters of credence are traditionally written in French, the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of diplomacy. However, they may also be written in the official language of the sending state.

== Language of letters ==

Letters of credence between two monarchs of equal rank will typically begin with the salutation &quot;Sir My Brother&quot; (or &quot;Madame My Sister&quot;, in the case of a female monarch) and close with the valediction &quot;Your Good Brother&quot; (or Sister, in the case of a female monarch). 

== Presentation of credentials ==


Upon arrival at their post, the ambassador-designate meets with the foreign minister to arrange for an audience with the head of state. They bring both a sealed original and an unsealed copy of his credentials. The unsealed copy is given to the foreign minister upon arrival, and the original is presented personally to the head of state in a formal ceremony. Ambassadors do not begin their duties until their credentials are accepted, and their precedence within the diplomatic corps is determined by the date on which the credentials were presented. They are, however, entitled to diplomatic immunity as soon as they enter the country.

The ambassador-designate travels to the presentation ceremony in an official vehicle provided by the receiving state, accompanied by a military escort. In parliamentary systems, the head of state or viceroy acts according to legally-binding advice from the government. The foreign minister will &quot;attend&quot; (be present with) the head of state at the actual ceremony, to symbolize the fact that the credentials are being accepted on the basis of government advice. The ambassador-designate uses both hands to present their credentials to the head of state. 

Many governments hold presentation ceremonies with elements that are usually accorded to heads of state and government, like military honors. 

While credential ceremonies are among the most formal events in diplomacy, governed by strict protocols and detailed guidelines, variations in the nature of these ceremonies can still be observed among diplomats from different countries. Despite their scripted and calculated nature, these ceremonies offer state representatives a subtle yet significant space for signaling— positive or negative — establishing contact, or conveying messages.

=== &quot;Chargé&quot;-level relations ===

When two countries maintain relations at the chargé d&#x27;affaires level, the letter of credence will be written by the foreign minister of the sending state and addressed to the foreign minister of the receiving state. The chargé will present their credentials to the foreign minister. The head of state is neither addressed nor presented with the credentials, symbolizing the lower level of diplomatic relations between the countries. The chargé is not entitled to a military escort or an official car.

=== Commonwealth ===

High commissioners from Commonwealth nations do not present letters of credence. When two Commonwealth realms share the same monarch as head of state, the prime minister of the sending state writes an informal letter of introduction to the prime minister of the receiving state. When a Commonwealth nation is a republic or has its own separate monarch, high commissioners are dispatched and received with letters of commission, which are written by one head of state and presented to another head of state. Both forms of letters were standardized in 1950–1951 after India became a republic, replacing a chaotic system where some high commissioners carried letters from the prime minister, some carried letters from the minister of external relations, and others carried no letters at all.

<text>North East Lincolnshire is a unitary authority area with borough status in Lincolnshire, England. It borders the borough of North Lincolnshire and districts of West Lindsey and East Lindsey. The population of the district in the 2011 Census was 159,616. The administrative centre and largest settlement is Grimsby and the borough includes the towns of Cleethorpes and Immingham as well as the villages of New Waltham, Waltham, Humberston, Healing and Great Coates. The borough is also home to the Port of Grimsby and Port of Immingham as well as Cleethorpes beach.

==History==

North East Lincolnshire was created from the boroughs of Cleethorpes and Great Grimsby on 1 April 1996 with the abolition of Humberside. The area lies within the Parts of Lindsey, a historic subdivision of Lincolnshire. The district was awarded borough status on 23 August 1996, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.
==Geography==
The borough is located at the northeastern corner of Lincolnshire and opposite the East Riding of Yorkshire. It borders the Humber estuary. The area between Cleethorpes and Grimsby as well as the villages of Great Coates, Humberstone, New Waltham and Waltham form a large conurbation. Immingham is separated from the Grimsby urban area by the A180 and is a few miles west of the town.
==Governance==

The council is based at Grimsby Town Hall, which had been built in 1863 for the old borough council of Grimsby.

There are four main roads that link to the unitary authority - the A180 (from the M180) which was built in 1984, and the A46 from Lincoln. The A46 terminates in Cleethorpes, previously terminating at the Laceby roundabout, and follows the former route of the A18 through Grimsby and Cleethorpes. The A18 which runs from Doncaster to Laceby past the Humberside Airport. And the A16 from southern Lincolnshire through Louth, Entering the town at toll bar roundabout Waltham

There are good connections by railway from Doncaster and Sheffield, which start at Manchester Airport - the TransPennine Express.

The Port of Immingham is the UK&#x27;s largest port by tonnage, handling around 46 million tonnes per year. It has DFDS freight routes to Brevik, Cuxhaven, Esbjerg, Gothenburg, Rotterdam and Zeebrugge. The Port of Grimsby is a major car importation hub, along with being an offshore wind farm servicing hub.

==Education==

The local LEA has comprehensive schools, becoming comprehensive in the early 1970s when part of the County Borough of Grimsby, and the Lindsey Education Committee, based in Lincoln. However, due to the proximity of West and East Lindsey which have grammar schools, some children capable of passing the eleven-plus are bussed over the border to places such as Caistor, Louth, and Alford. Previous to this Cleethorpes had girls&#x27; and boys&#x27; grammar schools, and Grimsby had the girls&#x27; and boys&#x27; (which joined in the late 1960s) Wintringham grammar schools.

The local secondary schools have improved in recent years, but Grimsby still has some of the worst GCSE results in the country. There is a clear cut dichotomy of education up to 16, with schools on the edge of Grimsby and Cleethorpes performing with respectable results, leaving the centre of these towns with struggling schools that have faced closure. Most schools have converted to Academy status, with some also lucky enough to move into brand new spacious buildings. It is more the case that affluent parents would refuse to send their children to schools in central Grimsby, hence the schools on the outer edge do much better.

Franklin College has a good reputation at A level, and regularly produces the best A level results for state schools in the former area of Humberside (north and south). It was formed by the Humberside Education Committee, based in Beverly. Sixth formers travelled from East and West Lindsey to attend this college, such was its reputation.

The main FE college in Grimsby is the Grimsby Institute. This offers a wide range of vocational courses and has links with the fishing industry. It offers higher education courses, and has done for many years - HNDs, for vocational subjects. It has the long-term ambition to become a university. The University of Humberside used to have its food science campus at the college, but removed this when it became the University of Lincoln.

<doc id="158015" wikidata="Q131207" url="?curid=158015" title="Cosmetics">
<text>Cosmetics are composed of mixtures of chemical compounds derived from either natural sources or synthetically created ones. Cosmetics have various purposes, including personal and skin care. They can also be used to conceal blemishes and enhance natural features (such as the eyebrows and eyelashes). Makeup can also add colour to a person&#x27;s face, enhance a person&#x27;s features or change the appearance of the face entirely to resemble a different person, creature, or object.

People have used cosmetics for thousands of years for skin care and appearance enhancement. Visible cosmetics for women and men have gone in and out of fashion over the centuries. 

Some early forms of cosmetics used harmful ingredients such as lead that caused serious health problems and sometimes resulted in death. Modern commercial cosmetics are generally tested for safety but may contain controversial ingredients, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), formaldehyde releasers, and ingredients that cause allergic reactions.

The European Union and regulatory agencies around the world have stringent regulations for cosmetics. In the United States, cosmetic products and ingredients do not require FDA approval. Some countries have banned using animals for cosmetic testing.

== Definition and etymology ==

The word &quot;cosmetics&quot; is derived from the Greek (), meaning &quot;technique of dress and ornament,&quot; from (), &quot;skilled in ordering or arranging,&quot; and from (), meaning &quot;order&quot; and &quot;ornament.&quot;.

=== Legal definition ===
Though the legal definition of cosmetics in most countries is broader, in some Western countries, cosmetics are commonly taken to mean only makeup products, such as lipstick, mascara, eye shadow, foundation, blush, highlighter, bronzer, fake eyelashes, eyeliner, concealer, lip gloss, and several other product types.

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates cosmetics, defines cosmetics as products &quot;intended to be applied to the human body for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance without affecting the body&#x27;s structure or functions.&quot; This broad definition includes any material intended for use as an ingredient in a cosmetic product, with the FDA specifically excluding pure soap from this category.

== Use ==
Cosmetics designed for skin care may be used to cleanse, exfoliate and protect the skin, as well as replenish it, using body lotions, cleansers, toners, serums, moisturizers, eye creams, retinol, and balms. Cosmetics designed for more general personal care, such as shampoo, soap, and body wash, can be used to clean the body.

Cosmetics designed to enhance one&#x27;s appearance (makeup) can be used to conceal blemishes, enhance one&#x27;s natural features, or add color to a person&#x27;s face. In some cases, more extreme forms of makeup are used for performances, fashion shows, and people in costume and can change the appearance of the face entirely to resemble a different person, creature, or object. Techniques for changing appearance include contouring, which aims to give shape to an area of the face.

Cosmetics can also be designed to add fragrance to the body.

Products used for haircare, such as permanent waves, hair colors, and hairsprays, are classified as cosmetic products as well.

== History ==

Cosmetics have been in use for thousands of years, with ancient Egyptians and Sumerians using them. In Europe, the use of cosmetics continued into the Middle Ages—where the face was whitened and the cheeks rouged— though attitudes towards cosmetics varied throughout time, with the use of cosmetics being openly frowned upon at many points in Western history. Regardless of the changes in social attitudes towards cosmetics, many occasionally achieved ideals of appearance through cosmetics. 

According to one source, early major developments in cosmetics include:
* Kohl used by ancient Egyptians
* Castor oil also used in ancient Egypt as a protective balm
* Skin creams made of beeswax, olive oil, and rose water, described by the Romans 
* Vaseline and lanolin in the nineteenth century.

Historically, the absence of regulation of the manufacture and use of cosmetics, as well as the absence of scientific knowledge regarding the effects of various compounds on the human body for much of this time period, led to a number of negative effects upon those who used cosmetics, including deformities, blindness, and, in some cases, death. Although harmless products were used, such as berries, and beetroot, many cosmetic products available at this time were still chemically dubious and even poisonous. Examples of the prevalent usage of harmful cosmetics include the use of ceruse (white lead) throughout a number of different cultures, such as during the Renaissance in the West, and blindness caused by the mascara Lash Lure during the early 20th century. During the 19th century, there were numerous incidents of lead poisoning due to the fashion for red and white lead makeup and powder, leading to swelling and inflammation of the eyes, weakened tooth enamel, and blackened skin, with heavy use known to lead to death. Usage of white lead was not confined only to the West, with the white Japanese face makeup known as also produced using white lead. In the second part of the 19th century, scientific advances in the production of makeup lead to the creation of makeup free of hazardous substances such as lead. 

Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, changes in the prevailing attitudes towards cosmetics led to a wider expansion of the cosmetics industry. In 1882, English actress and socialite Lillie Langtry became the poster girl for Pears of London, making her the first celebrity to endorse a commercial product. She allowed her name to be used on face powders and skin products. During the 1910s, the market in the US was developed by figures such as Elizabeth Arden, Helena Rubinstein, and Max Factor. These firms were joined by Revlon just before World War II and Estée Lauder just after. By the middle of the 20th century, cosmetics were in widespread use by women in nearly all industrial societies around the world, with the cosmetics industry becoming a multibillion-dollar enterprise by the beginning of the 21st century. The wider acceptance of the use of cosmetics led some to see makeup as a tool used in the oppression and subjection of women to unfair societal standards. In 1968, at the feminist Miss America protest, protesters symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a &quot;Freedom Trash Can&quot;, with cosmetics among the items the protesters called &quot;instruments of female torture&quot; and accoutrements of what they perceived to be enforced femininity.

, the world&#x27;s largest cosmetics company is L&#x27;Oréal, founded by Eugène Schueller in 1909 as the French Harmless Hair Colouring Company (now owned by Liliane Bettencourt 26% and Nestlé 28%; the remaining 46% is traded publicly).

Although modern makeup has been traditionally used mainly by women, men also use makeup to enhance their own facial features or cover blemishes and dark circles. The negative stigma of men wearing makeup in countries such as the United States has weakened over the years, with the number of men using makeup increasing in the 21st century. Cosmetics brands have increasingly targeted men in the sale of cosmetics, with some products targeted specifically at men.

Lead has been used as a makeup product since the 18th century. It is said to be lethal to women who apply it daily to achieve a pale complexion representing nobility, as tanner skin represents the working class. Lead can be detrimental to people&#x27;s health and cause death if mixed with vinegar which it allows lead to be absorbed through the skin.

== Types of cosmetics ==

Though there are a large number of different cosmetics used for a variety of different purposes, all cosmetics are typically intended to be applied externally. These products can be applied to the face (on the skin, lips, eyebrows, and eyes), to the body (on the skin, particularly the hands and nails), and to the hair. These products may be intended for use as skincare, personal care, or to alter the appearance, with the subset of cosmetics known as makeup primarily referring to products containing colour pigments intended for the purpose of altering the wearer&#x27;s appearance; some manufacturers will distinguish only between &quot;decorative&quot; cosmetics intended to alter the appearance and &quot;care&quot; cosmetics designed for skincare and personal care.

Most cosmetics are also distinguished by the area of the body intended for application, with cosmetics designed to be used on the face and eye area usually applied with a brush, a makeup sponge, or the fingertips. Cosmetics can also be described by the physical composition of the product. Cosmetics can be liquid or cream emulsions, powders (pressed or loose), dispersions, or anhydrous creams or sticks.

=== Decorative ===
* Primers are used on the face before makeup is applied, creating a typically transparent, smooth layer over the top of the skin, allowing for makeup to be applied smoothly and evenly. Some primers may also be tinted, and this tint may match the wearer&#x27;s skin tone or may colour correct it, using greens, oranges, and purples to even out the wearer&#x27;s skin tone and correct redness, purple shadows, or orange discolouration respectively.
* Concealer is a cream or liquid product used to conceal marks or blemishes on the skin. Concealer is typically the colour of the user&#x27;s skin tone and is generally applied after the face has been primed to even out the wearer&#x27;s skin tone before foundation can be applied. Concealer is usually more heavily pigmented, has higher coverage, and is thicker than foundation or tinted primers. Though concealer is often more heavy duty in terms of pigment and consistency than foundation, a number of different formulations intended for different styles of use, such as a lighter concealer for the eyes and a heavier concealer for stage makeup, are available, as well as color-correcting concealers intended to balance out discolouration of the skin specifically.
* Foundation is a cream, liquid, mousse, or powder product applied to the entirety of the face to create a smooth and even base for the user&#x27;s skin tone. Foundation provides a generally lower amount of coverage than concealer and is sold in formulations that can provide sheer, matte, dewy or full coverage to the skin.
* Rouge, blush, or blusher is a liquid, cream, or powder product applied to the centre of the cheeks with the intention of adding or enhancing their natural colour. Blushers are typically available in shades of pink and red or warm tan and brown, and may also be used to make the cheekbones appear more defined.
* Bronzer is a powder, cream, or liquid product that adds colour to the skin, typically in bronze or tan shades, intended to give the skin a tanned appearance and enhance the colour of the face. Bronzer, like highlighter, may also contain substances providing a shimmer or glitter effect, and comes in either matte, semi-matte, satin, or shimmer finishes. Unlike bronzer, the purpose of contour is to help emphasize your facial features by adding depth.
* Highlighter is a liquid, cream, or powder product applied to the high points of the face, such as the eyebrows, nose, and cheekbones. Highlighter commonly has substances added, providing a shimmer or glitter effect. Alternatively, a lighter toned foundation or concealer can be used as a highlighter.
* Eyebrow pencils, creams, waxes, gels, and powders are used to color, fill in, and define the brows. Eyebrow tinting treatments are also used to dye the eyebrow hairs a darker colour, either temporarily or permanently, without staining and colouring the skin underneath the eyebrows.
* Eyeshadow is a powder, cream, or liquid pigmented product used to draw attention to, accentuate, and change the shape of the area around the eyes, the eyelids, and the space below the eyebrows. Eyeshadow is typically applied using an eyeshadow brush with generally small and rounded bristles, though liquid and cream formulations may also be applied with the fingers. Eyeshadow is available in almost every colour, as well as being sold in a number of different finishes, ranging from matte finishes with sheer coverage to glossy, shimmery, and highly pigmented finishes. Many different colours and finishes of eyeshadow may be combined in one look and blended together to achieve different effects.
* Eyeliner is used to enhance and elongate the apparent size or depth of the eye. Though eyeliner is commonly black, it can come in many different colours. Eyeliner can come in the form of a pencil, a gel or a liquid.
* False eyelashes are used to extend, exaggerate, and add volume to the eyelashes. Consisting generally of a small strip to which hair—either human, mink, or synthetic—is attached, false eyelashes are typically applied to the lash line using glue, which can come in latex and latex-free varieties; magnetic false eyelashes, which attach to the eyelid after magnetic eyeliner is applied, are also available. Designs vary in length and colour, with rhinestones, gems, feathers, and lace available as false eyelash designs. False eyelashes are not permanent and can be easily taken off with the fingers. Eyelash extensions are a more permanent way to achieve this look. Each set lasts for two to three weeks, then the set can be filled, similar to the maintenance of acrylic nails. To apply for extensions, the certified lash artist would start by taping down the bottom eyelashes. The lash artist would then use two tweezers, one to isolate the natural eyelash and one to apply the false eyelash. An individual false eyelash, or lash fan, is applied to one natural eyelash using a lash glue specific for this process. The eyelashes should not be stuck together. The length and thickness of the false lash should not be to heavy for the natural eyelash. If this process is done correctly, no harm will be done to the natural eyelashes.
* Mascara is used to darken, lengthen, thicken, or enhance the eyelashes through the use of a typically thick, cream-like product applied with a spiral bristle mascara brush. Mascara is commonly black, brown, or clear, though a number of different colours, some containing glitter, are available. Mascara is typically advertised and sold in a number of different formulations that advertise qualities such as waterproofing, volume enhancement, length enhancement, and curl enhancement, and may be used in combination with an eyelash curler to enhance the natural curl of the eyelashes.
* Lip products, including lipstick, lip gloss, lip liner and lip balms, commonly add color and texture to the lips, as well as serving to moisturise the lips and define their external edges. Products adding colour and texture to the lips, such as lipsticks and lip glosses, often come in a wide range of colors as well as a number of different finishes, such as matte finishes and satin or glossy finishes. Other styles of lip coloration products, such as lip stains, temporarily saturate the lips with a dye and typically do not alter the texture of the lips. Both lip colour products and lip liners may be waterproof and may be applied directly to the lips, with a brush, or with the fingers. Lip balms, though designed to moisturise and protect the lips (such as through the addition of UV protection) may also tint the lips.
* Face powder, setting powder, or setting sprays are used to &#x27;set&#x27; foundation or concealer, giving it a matte or consistent finish while also concealing small flaws or blemishes. Both powders and setting sprays claim to keep makeup from absorbing into the skin or melting off. While setting sprays are generally not tinted, setting powder and face powder can come in translucent or tinted varieties, and can be used to bake foundation in order for it to stay longer on the face. Tinted face powders may also be worn alone without foundation or concealer to give an extremely sheer coverage base.
* Nail polish is a liquid used to colour the fingernails and toenails. Transparent, colorless nail polishes may be used to strengthen nails or be used as a top or base coat to protect the nail or nail polish. Nail polish, like eyeshadow, is available in every colour and a number of different finishes, including matte, shimmer, glossy and crackle finishes.

=== Skincare ===

Cleansing is a standard step in skin care routines. Skin cleansing includes some or all of these steps or cosmetics:
* Cleansers or foaming washes are used to remove excess dirt, oil, and makeup left on the skin. Different cleansing products are aimed at various types of skin, such as sulfate-free cleansers and spin brushes.
** Cleansing oil, or oil cleanser, is an oil-based solution that gently emulsifies the skin&#x27;s natural oils and removes makeup. Cleansing oils are typically used as part of a two-step cleansing process. After the skin has been cleansed with an oil cleanser, a second cleanse is done using a mild gel, milk or cream cleanser to ensure any traces of the oil cleanser and makeup are removed.
* Toners are used after cleansing to remove any remaining traces of cleanser and restore the pH of the skin. They may also add some hydration. They are usually applied to a cotton pad and wiped over the skin, but they can be sprayed onto the skin from a spray bottle or poured onto the hand and patted directly onto the skin. Toners usually contain water, citric acid, herbal extracts, and other ingredients. Witch hazel is still commonly used in toners to tighten the pores and refresh the skin. Alcohol is used less often as it is drying and can be irritating to the skin. It may still be found in toners, specially for those with oily skin. Some toners contain active ingredients and target particular skin types, such as tea tree oil, salicylic acid, or glycolic acid.
* Hyperpigmentation treatment: Kojic acid soap, cream, or powder, and Arbutin (a b-D-glucopyranoside derivative of hydroquinone) serum or cream help get rid of hyperpigmentation spots of the skin.
* Facial masks are treatments applied to the skin and then removed. Typically, they are applied to a dry, cleansed face, avoiding the eyes and lips.
** Clay-based masks use kaolin clay or fuller&#x27;s earth to transport essential oils and chemicals to the skin and are typically left on until completely dry. As the clay dries, it absorbs excess oil and dirt from the surface of the skin and may help to clear blocked pores or draw comedones to the surface. Because of their drying actions, clay-based masks should only be used on oily skins.
** Peel masks are typically gel-like in consistency and contain acids or exfoliating agents to help exfoliate the skin, along with other ingredients to hydrate, discourage wrinkles, or treat uneven skin tone. They are left on to dry and then gently peeled off. They should be avoided by people with dry or sensitive skin, as they tend to be very drying.
** Sheet masks are a relatively new product that is becoming extremely popular in Asia. Sheet masks consist of a thin cotton or fiber sheet with holes cut out for the eyes and lips and cut to fit the contours of the face, onto which serums and skin treatments are brushed in a thin layer; the sheets may be soaked in the treatment. Masks are available to suit almost all skin types and skin complaints. Sheet masks are quicker, less messy, and require no specialized knowledge or equipment for their use compared to other types of face masks, but they may be difficult to find and purchase outside Asia.
** Exfoliants are products that help slough off dead skin cells from the topmost layer of the skin to improve the appearance of the skin. This is achieved either by using mild acids or other chemicals to loosen old skin cells or lightly abrasive substances to physically remove them. Exfoliation can also help even out patches of rough skin, improve cell turnover, clear blocked pores to discourage acne, and improve the appearance and healing of scars.
** Chemical exfoliants include azelaic acid, citric acid, acetic acid, malic acid, mandelic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, papain, and bromelain. They may be found in cleansers, scrubs, and peels, but also in leave-on products such as toners, serums, and moisturisers. Chemical exfoliants mainly fall into the categories of AHAs, BHAs, PHAs or enzymes.
** Abrasive exfoliants include gels, creams or lotions, as well as physical objects.
* Moisturizers are creams or lotions that hydrate the skin and help it to retain moisture. Typical components are polyols such as glycerol and sorbitol as well as partially hydrolyzed proteins. Tinted moisturizers contain a small amount of foundation, which can provide light coverage for minor blemishes or to even out skin tones. They are usually applied with the fingertips or a cotton pad. 
* Eyes require a different kind of moisturizer compared with the rest of the face. The skin around the eyes is extremely thin and sensitive, and it is often the first area to show signs of aging. Eye creams are typically very light lotions or gels, and are usually very gentle; some may contain ingredients such as caffeine or Vitamin K to reduce puffiness and dark circles under the eyes. Eye creams or gels should be applied over the entire eye area with a finger, using a patting motion. Finding a moisturizer with SPF is beneficial to prevent aging and wrinkles.
* Sunscreens are creams, lotions, sprays, gels, sticks, or other topical projects that protect the skin from the sun. They contain organic or inorganic filters that act to absorb or reflect harmful UV radiation. Sunscreens are marked with &#x27;spf&#x27;, which means &#x27;sun protection factor.&#x27; This shows that a product provides protection against UVB. UVA ratings on sunscreens can be denoted by the number of stars or plus symbols varying among countries. UVA ratings do not specifically depict the amount of UVA protection a sunscreen is providing but rather the ratio of equal UVA and UVB protection. The recommended &#x27;gold standard&#x27; of a sunscreen should be at least SPF 30 and at least 4 stars or plus symbols. Daily sunscreen application is very important, but uses of shade, clothing, and hats are as important and more effective for sun protection.
* Serums are light, easily absorbed liquids that one spreads on their skin. The main purpose of the product is to be applied before moisturizer, and the serum provides a high concentration of any specific ingredient on the face. The benefits of serum are skin firmness, smoothness of the face, and reducing the fine lines and wrinkles on ones face.

=== Hair care ===
Hair care is a category of cosmetics devoted to products which are used to improve the appearance of hair.
* Shampoos are used to clean the hair and scalp by massaging into wet hair and then rinsing.
* Hair conditioners are used following shampoo to improve the appearance of hair by making it smoother and shinier.
* Styling products include gels, waxes, foams, creams, mousse, serum and pomades; they are used to create and maintain hairstyles.

== Perfume ==
Perfumes or fragrances, are liquids that can be sprayed or applied to produce a long-lasting smell. They are created by mixing different compounds together. There are different groups of perfumes which are categorised according to their concentration.
* Parfum
* Eau de parfum
* Eau de toilette

The difference between Eau de parfum and Eau de toilette is more about the perfume oil concentration. Eau de parfum has a higher concentration of perfume than Eau de toilette.

== Tools ==
Various tools are used to apply cosmetics.

=== Brushes ===
* A makeup brush is used to apply makeup to the face. There are two types of makeup brushes: synthetic and natural. Synthetic brushes are best for cream products while natural brushes are ideal for powder products. Using the appropriate brush to apply a certain product allows the product to blend into the skin smoothly and evenly.
* A foundation brush is usually a dense brush that distributes the product evenly while smoothing out the face. This brush is best used to achieve full coverage.
* A concealer brush has a small, tapered tip that allows for precise spot correction such as blemishes or discoloration.
* A stippling brush has soft, synthetic bristles that give an airbrushed effect. This brush is best used to achieve light to medium coverage.
* A blush brush comes in all shapes and sizes and is used to apply blush, allowing the blush to look natural while giving a flush of color.
* A powder brush tends to be big and fluffy for quick and easy application of dusting powder all over the face. Powder gives the appearance of a matte effect.
* A bronzer brush, which can also serve as a contour brush, is an angled brush that gives the face dimensions and illusions by allowing the makeup to be placed in place of bone structure. This brush can also be used to add a shimmering highlight illusion to the cheekbones, nose and chin.
* A highlight brush, also known as a fan brush, has bristles that are typically spread out and is used to apply where the sun would naturally hit.
* An eyeshadow brush is a dense brush that allows shadow to be packed onto the eyelid.
* A blending eyeshadow brush is used to blend out any harsh lines you may have from the eyeshadow and can soften the eyeshadow look.
* An eyeliner brush is tapered with an extra-fine tip used for gel eyeliners which allows precision to line the eyes.
* A spoolie is used to brush out the eyebrows and can also be used as a mascara wand.
* A lip brush is small to ensure precision and is used to apply lipstick evenly onto the lips.
* An eyebrow brush is tapered and slanting from the top, which tends to define the eyebrows and fill in the empty spaces between brows, to give them a fuller and denser look.
* A Kabuki brush is used to apply any sort of powder makeup to large surfaces of the face (loose powder, foundation, face powder, blush, bronzer). This brush is used to evenly the skin.

=== Other applicators ===
In addition to brushes, a makeup sponge is a popular applicator. Makeup sponges can be used to apply foundation, blend concealer, and apply powder or highlighter.

Loofahs, microfiber cloths, natural sponges, or brushes may be used to exfoliate skin simply by rubbing them over the face in a circular motion. Gels, creams, or lotions may contain an acid to encourage dead skin cells to loosen, and an abrasive such as microbeads, sea salt and sugar, ground nut shells, rice bran, or ground apricot kernels to scrub the dead cells off the skin. Salt and sugar scrubs tend to be the harshest, while scrubs containing beads or rice bran are typically very gentle.
== Ingredients ==

A variety of organic compounds and inorganic compounds comprise typical cosmetics. Typical organic compounds are modified natural oils and fats as well as a variety of petrochemically derived agents. Inorganic compounds are processed minerals such as iron oxides, talc, and zinc oxide. The oxides of zinc and iron are classified as pigments, i.e., colorants that have no solubility in solvents. Cosmetic companies have become more transparent in the ingredients of their products because consumers are interested in the formula of their products.

=== Natural ===

Handmade and certified organic products are becoming more mainstream due to consumer concerns that certain chemicals in some skincare products may be harmful if absorbed through the skin. The FDA, which regulates the US cosmetic industry, says &quot;FDA has not defined the term “natural” and has not established a regulatory definition for this term in cosmetic labeling.&quot; It goes on to warn consumers, &quot;choosing ingredients from sources you consider “organic” or “natural” is no guarantee that they are safe.&quot;

=== Mineral ===
The term &quot;mineral makeup&quot; applies to a category of face makeup, including foundation, eye shadow, blush, and bronzer, made with loose, dry mineral powders. These powders are often mixed with oil-water emulsions. Lipsticks, liquid foundations, and other liquid cosmetics, as well as compressed makeups such as eye shadow and blush in compacts, are often called mineral makeup if they have the same primary ingredients as dry mineral makeups. Liquid makeups must contain preservatives, and compressed makeups must contain binders, which dry mineral makeups do not. Mineral makeup usually does not contain synthetic fragrances, preservatives, parabens, mineral oil, or chemical dyes. For this reason, dermatologists may consider mineral makeup to be gentler on the skin than makeup that contains those ingredients. Some minerals are nacreous or pearlescent, giving the skin a shining or sparking appearance. One example is bismuth oxychloride. There are various mineral-based makeup brands, including: Bare Minerals, Tarte, Bobbi Brown, and Stila.

== Packaging ==

The term cosmetic packaging is used for primary packaging and secondary packaging of cosmetic products.

Primary packaging, also called cosmetic containers, houses the cosmetic product. It is in direct contact with the cosmetic product. Secondary packaging is the outer wrapping of one or several cosmetic container(s). An important difference between primary and secondary packaging is that any information that is necessary to clarify the safety of the product must appear on the primary package. Otherwise, much of the required information can appear on just the secondary packaging.

Cosmetic packaging is standardized by ISO 22715, set by the International Organization for Standardization and regulated by national or regional regulations such as those issued by the EU or the FDA. Marketers and manufacturers of cosmetic products must be compliant to these regulations to be able to market their cosmetic products in the corresponding areas of jurisdiction.

== Industry ==

The manufacture of cosmetics is dominated by a small number of multinational corporations that originated in the early 20th century, but the distribution and sales of cosmetics are spread among a wide range of businesses. The world&#x27;s largest cosmetic companies are L&#x27;Oréal, Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever, Shiseido, and Estée Lauder. In 2005, the market volume of the cosmetics industry in the US, Europe, and Japan was about EUR 70 Billion/a year. In Germany, the cosmetic industry generated €12.6 billion of retail sales in 2008, which makes the German cosmetic industry the third largest in the world, after Japan and the United States. German exports of cosmetics reached €5.8 billion in 2008, whereas imports of cosmetics totaled €3 billion.

The worldwide cosmetics and perfume industry currently generates an estimated annual turnover of US$170 billion (according to Eurostaf, May 2007). Europe is the leading market, representing approximately €63 billion, while sales in France reached €6.5 billion in 2006, according to FIPAR (Fédération des Industries de la Parfumerie – the French federation for the perfume industry). France is another country in which the cosmetic industry plays an important role, both nationally and internationally. According to data from 2008, the cosmetic industry has grown constantly in France for 40 consecutive years. In 2006, this industrial sector reached a record level of €6.5 billion. Famous cosmetic brands produced in France include Vichy, Yves Saint Laurent, Yves Rocher, and many others.
The Italian cosmetic industry is also an important player in the European cosmetic market. Although not as large as in other European countries, the cosmetic industry in Italy was estimated to reach €9 billion in 2007. The Italian cosmetic industry is dominated by hair and body products and not makeup as in many other European countries. In Italy, hair and body products make up approximately 30% of the cosmetic market. Makeup and facial care are the most common cosmetic products exported to the United States.

According to Euromonitor International, the market for cosmetics in China is expected to be $7.4 billion in 2021 up from $4.3 billion in 2016. The increase is due to social media and the changing attitudes of people in the 18-to-30-year age bracket.

Due to the popularity of cosmetics, especially fragrances, many designers who are not necessarily involved in the cosmetic industry came up with perfumes bearing their names. Moreover, some actors and singers (such as Celine Dion) have their own perfume line. Designer perfumes are, like any other designer products, the most expensive in the industry as the consumer pays for the product and the brand. Famous Italian fragrances are produced by Giorgio Armani, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, and others.

Procter &amp; Gamble, which sells CoverGirl and Dolce &amp; Gabbana makeup, funded a study concluding that makeup makes women seem more competent. Due to the source of funding, the quality of this Boston University study is questioned.

Cosmetics products may be retailed in beauty stores, department stores and hypermarkets, drugstores, variety stores, grocery stores, beauty supply stores, and many other formats, and in similar types of online stores or the online presence of these types of physical stores.

Cosmetic companies have changed their traditional methods of marketing by using social media influencers and brand ambassadors to market their products.

== Controversy ==

During the 20th century, the popularity of cosmetics increased rapidly. Cosmetics are used by girls at increasingly young ages, especially in the United States. Because of the fast-decreasing age of makeup users, many companies, from drugstore brands like Rimmel to higher-end products like Estee Lauder, cater to this expanding market by introducing flavored lipsticks and glosses, cosmetics packaged in glittery and sparkly packaging, and marketing and advertising using young models. The social consequences of younger and younger cosmetics use have had much attention in the media over the last few years.

Criticism of cosmetics has come from a wide variety of sources including some feminists, religious groups, animal rights activists, authors, and public interest groups. It has also faced criticism from men, some of whom describe it as a form of deception or &quot;fakeup&quot;.

The new generation has been more accepting of males wearing makeup, and having a &quot;soft pretty boy&quot; look in South Korea has become more widespread in recent years, particularly among younger generations. This trend is known as &quot;K-beauty,&quot; and it has been popularized by K-pop idols, actors, and social media influencers. Many of these idols have become beauty icons and have allowed many men to access beauty products and to feel comfortable using them. While there may still be some societal pressure to conform to traditional gender norms, there is also a growing acceptance of individual expression and breaking free from traditional gender roles.

&quot;The Sephora Kids are the generation alpha (the cohort born roughly between 2010 and 2025) and is growing up in a very different environment compared to previous generations, and several factors contribute to their heightened interest in skincare and makeup. Platforms like TikTok have also popularized short, fun videos about skincare and makeup tips, making beauty routines seem exciting and achievable. Social media platforms have made it easier for celebrities and influencers to become role models for Gen Alpha, and as a result, many celebrities and influencers actively promote skincare routines or collaborate with beauty brands, making skincare and makeup more aspirational Alpha is also inspired by the &quot;clean beauty&quot; movement and inclusive beauty brands that champion self-expression, allowing them to feel more confident in exploring skincare and makeup.&quot;

In 2023 and 2024, many people posting on social media have reported seeing girls, ranging from 10 to 12 in age in popular cosmetic stores, such as the likes of Boots and Sephora. This is most commonly reported in western countries, specifically America, Australia and the United Kingdom. This has garnered attention because it bring awareness to the growing need for make-up for younger girls and women, many criticize this claiming it&#x27;s connected to western beauty standards which in recent years have become an increasingly controversial topic in many medias revolving around politics and women&#x27;s rights. It&#x27;s also a hot topic in medical spaces such as dermatology, due to the increase of young girls using anti-aging cream, despite only being around 11 years old. 

=== Safety ===

In the United States, &quot;Under the law, cosmetic products and ingredients do not need FDA premarket approval.&quot; The EU and other regulatory agencies around the world have more stringent regulations. The FDA does not have to approve or review cosmetics, or what goes in them, before they are sold to consumers. The FDA only regulates some colors that can be used in the cosmetics and hair dyes. The cosmetic companies do not have to report any injuries from the products; they also only have voluntary recalls of products.

There has been a marketing trend towards the sale of cosmetics lacking controversial ingredients, especially those derived from petroleum, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), and parabens. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of about 9,000 synthetic organofluorine compounds that have multiple highly toxic fluorine atoms attached to an alkyl chain. PFAS are used by major cosmetics industry companies in a wide range of cosmetics, including such products as lipstick, eye liner, mascara, foundation, concealer, lip balm, blush, nail polish. A 2021 study tested 231 personal care products and found organic fluorine, a hallmark of PFAS, in more than half of the samples. Substantial levels of fluorine were identified in tested brands of products as follows: 82% of the brands of waterproof mascara, 63% of the brands of foundations, and 62% of liquid lipstick. PFAS compounds are readily absorbed through human skin and through tear ducts, and such products on lips are often unwittingly ingested. Manufacturers often fail to label their products as containing PFAS, which makes it difficult for cosmetics consumers to avoid products containing PFAS.

Formaldehyde is no longer used in cosmetics but has been replaced by formaldehyde releasers. Formaldehyde is dangerous to human health, especially when inhaled. In 2011, the US National Toxicology Program described formaldehyde as &quot;known to be a human carcinogen&quot;.

The danger of formaldehyde is a major reason for the development of formaldehyde releasers which release formaldehyde slowly at lower levels.

Numerous reports have raised concern over the safety of a few surfactants, including 2-butoxyethanol. In some individuals, SLS may cause a number of skin problems, including dermatitis. Additionally, some individuals have had an emergence of vitiligo after using cosmetics containing the ingredient rhododendrol.

Parabens can cause skin irritation and contact dermatitis in individuals with paraben allergies, a small percentage of the general population. Animal experiments have shown that parabens have a weak estrogenic activity, acting as xenoestrogens.
Perfumes are widely used in consumer products. Studies concluded from patch testing show fragrances contain some ingredients which may cause allergic reactions.

Balsam of Peru was the main recommended marker for perfume allergy before 1977, which is still advised. The presence of Balsam of Peru in a cosmetic will be denoted by the INCI term &quot;Myroxylon pereirae&quot;. In some instances, Balsam of Peru is listed on the ingredient label of a product by one of its various names, but it may not be required to be listed by its name by mandatory labeling conventions (in fragrances, for example, it may simply be covered by an ingredient listing of &quot;fragrance&quot;).

Some cosmetics companies have made pseudo-scientific claims about their products which are misleading or unsupported by scientific evidence.

=== Animal testing ===
As of 2019, an estimated 50–100 million animals are tested each year in locations such as the United States and China. Such tests have involved general toxicity, eye and skin irritants, phototoxicity (toxicity triggered by ultraviolet light), and mutagenicity. Due to ethical concerns around animal testing, some nations have legislated against animal testing for cosmetics. An updated list can be found on the Humane Societies website. According to the Humane Society of the United States, there are nearly 50 non-animal tests that have been validated for use, and are potentially more efficacious. In the United States, mice, rats, rabbits, and cats are the most used animals for testing. In 2018, California banned the sale of animal-tested cosmetics.

Cosmetics testing is banned in the Netherlands, India, Norway, Israel, New Zealand, Belgium, and the UK. In 2002, the European Union agreed to phase in a near-total ban on the sale of animal-tested cosmetics throughout the EU from 2009 and to ban all cosmetics-related animal testing. In December 2009, the European Parliament and Council passed EC Regulation 1223/2009 on cosmetics, a bill to regulate the cosmetic industry in the EU. EC Regulation 1223/2009 took effect on July 11, 2013. In March 2013, the EU banned the import and sale of cosmetics containing ingredients tested on animals. China required animal testing on cosmetic products until 2014, when they waived animal testing requirements for domestically produced products. In 2019, China approved nine non-animal testing methods, and in 2020 laws making animal testing compulsory were lifted.

In June 2017, legislation was proposed in Australia to end animal testing in the cosmetics industry. In March 2019, the Australian Senate passed a bill that banned the use of data from animal testing in the cosmetic industry since July 1, 2020.

== Legislation ==

=== Europe ===
In the European Union, the manufacture, labelling, and supply of cosmetics and personal care products are regulated by Regulation EC 1223/2009. It applies to all the countries of the EU as well as Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland. This regulation applies to single-person companies making or importing just one product as well as to large multinationals. Manufacturers and importers of cosmetic products must comply with the applicable regulations in order to sell their products in the EU. In this industry, it is common fall back on a suitably qualified person, such as an independent third party inspection and testing company, to verify the cosmetics&#x27; compliance with the requirements of applicable cosmetic regulations and other relevant legislation, including REACH, GMP, hazardous substances, etc.

In the European Union, the circulation of cosmetic products and their safety have been the subject of legislation since 1976. One of the newest improvements to the regulation concerning the cosmetic industry is the ban on animal testing. Testing cosmetic products on animals has been illegal in the European Union since September 2004, and testing the separate ingredients of such products on animals is also prohibited by law, since March 2009 for some endpoints and full since 2013.

Cosmetic regulations in Europe are often updated to follow the trends of innovations and new technologies while ensuring product safety. For instance, all annexes of Regulation 1223/2009 were aimed at addressing potential risks to human health.
Under the EU cosmetic regulation, manufacturers, retailers, and importers of cosmetics in Europe will be designated as &quot;responsible persons.&quot;. This new status implies that the responsible person has the legal liability to ensure that the cosmetics and brands they manufacture or sell comply with the current cosmetic regulations and norms. The responsible person is also responsible for the documents contained in the Product Information File (PIF), a list of product information including data such as Cosmetic Product Safety Report, product description, GMP statement, or product function.

=== United States ===
In 1938, the U.S. passed the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act authorizing the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to oversee safety via legislation in the cosmetic industry and its aspects in the United States. The FDA joined with 13 other federal agencies in forming the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) in 1997, which is an attempt to ban animal testing and find other methods to test cosmetic products.

The current law on cosmetics in the U.S. does not require cosmetic products and ingredients to have FDA approval before going on the market, except from color additives. The Cosmetic Safety Enhancement Act was introduced in December 2019 by Representative Frank Pallone.

=== Brazil ===

ANVISA (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária, &quot;Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency&quot;) is the regulatory body responsible for cosmetic legislation and directives in the country. The rules apply to manufacturers, importers, and retailers of cosmetics in Brazil, and most of them have been harmonized so they can apply to the entire Mercosur.

The current legislation restricts the use of certain substances, such as pyrogallol, formaldehyde, or paraformaldehyde, and bans the use of others, such as lead acetate in cosmetic products. All restricted and forbidden substances and products are listed in the regulation RDC 16/11 and RDC 162, 09/11/01.

More recently, a new cosmetic Technical Regulation (RDC 15/2013) was set up to establish a list of authorized and restricted substances for cosmetic use, used in products such as hair dyes, nail hardeners, or used as product preservatives.

Most Brazilian regulations are optimized, harmonized, or adapted in order to be applicable and extended to the entire Mercosur economic zone.

=== International ===
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) published new guidelines on the safe manufacturing of cosmetic products under a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) regime. Regulators in several countries and regions have adopted this standard, ISO 22716:2007, effectively replacing existing guidance and standards. 
ISO 22716 provides a comprehensive approach for a quality management system for those engaged in the manufacturing, packaging, testing, storage, and transportation of cosmetic end products. The standard deals with all aspects of the supply chain, from the early delivery of raw materials and components until the shipment of the final product to the consumer.

The standard is based on other quality management systems, ensuring smooth integration with such systems as ISO 9001 or the British Retail Consortium (BRC) standard for consumer products. Therefore, it combines the benefits of GMP, linking cosmetic product safety with overall business improvement tools that enable organisations to meet global consumer demand for cosmetic product safety certification.

In July 2012, since microbial contamination is one of the greatest concerns regarding the quality of cosmetic products, the ISO introduced a new standard for evaluating the antimicrobial protection of a cosmetic product by preservation efficacy testing and microbiological risk assessment.

<text>Timothy Patrick &quot;Tim Pat&quot; Coogan (born 22 April 1935) is an Irish journalist, writer and broadcaster. He served as editor of &quot;The Irish Press&quot; newspaper from 1968–87. He has been best known for such books as &quot;The IRA&quot;, &quot;Ireland Since the Rising&quot; and &quot;On the Blanket&quot;, and biographies of Michael Collins and Éamon de Valera.

Coogan&#x27;s particular focus has been Ireland&#x27;s nationalist/independence movement in the 20th century, a period of unprecedented political upheaval. He blames the Troubles in Northern Ireland on &quot;Paisleyism&quot;.

==Biography==

Coogan was born in Monkstown, County Dublin in 1935, the first of three children born to Beatrice (née Toal) and Ned Coogan. Ned (sometimes referred to as &quot;Eamonn Ó Cuagain&quot;), a native of Kilkenny, was an Irish Republican Army volunteer during the War of Independence and later served as the first Deputy Commissioner of the newly established Garda Síochána, then a Fine Gael TD for the Kilkenny constituency. Beatrice Toal, the daughter of a policeman, was a Dublin socialite who was crowned &quot;Dublin&#x27;s Civic Queen of Beauty&quot; in 1927. She wrote for the &quot;Evening Herald&quot; and took part in various productions in the Abbey Theatre and Radio Éireann. Coogan spent many summer holidays in the town of Castlecomer in County Kilkenny, his father&#x27;s home town.

A former student of the Irish Christian Brothers in Dún Laoghaire and Belvedere College in Dublin, he spent most of his secondary studies in Blackrock College in Dublin.

In 2000, Irish writer and editor Ruth Dudley Edwards was awarded £25,000 damages and a public apology by the High Court in London against Coogan for factual errors in references to her in his book &quot;Wherever Green is Worn: the Story of the Irish Diaspora&quot;. In the book, Coogan had written that Dudley Edwards had &quot;grovelled to and hypocritically ingratiated herself with the English establishment to further her writing career&quot;. He also alleged that Dudley Edwards &quot;had abused the position of chairwoman of the British Association for Irish Studies (BAIS) by trying to impose her political views on it&quot; and that her commission to write &quot;True Brits&quot; had been awarded because of political favouritism.

When Taoiseach Enda Kenny caused confusion following a speech at Béal na Bláth by incorrectly claiming Michael Collins had brought Lenin to Ireland, Coogan commented: &quot;Those were the days when bishops were bishops and Lenin was a communist. How would that have gone down with the churchyard collections?&quot;

In November 2012, for reasons that are uncertain, the United States embassy in Dublin refused to grant Coogan a visa to visit the U.S. As a result, a planned book tour for his book (&quot;The Famine Plot, England&#x27;s role in Ireland&#x27;s Greatest Tragedy&quot;) was cancelled. After representations to then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by United States Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Congressman Peter T. King (R-NY), Coogan received his visa.

==Criticism==

Coogan has been criticised by the Irish historians Liam Kennedy and Diarmaid Ferriter, as well as Cormac Ó Gráda, for a supposed lack of thoroughness in his research and bias: 
* &quot;Well, I waited in this book to hear some great revelation and it just isn’t there. It’s anticlimactic. I could not see the great plot, and indeed there is no serious historian who ... I can’t think of a single historian who has researched the Famine in depth – and Tim Pat has not researched it in depth&quot; (&quot;The Famine Plot&quot;).
* &quot;Coogan is not remotely interested in looking at what others have written on 20th-century Irish history... he does not appear interested in context and shows scant regard for evidence. He does not attempt to offer any sustained analysis in relation to the challenges of state building, the meaning of sovereignty, economic and cultural transformations, or comparative perspectives on the evolution of Irish society. There is no indication whatsoever that Coogan has engaged with the abundant archival material relating to the subject matter he pronounces on. There is no rhyme or reason when it comes to the citation of the many quotations he uses; the vast majority are not referenced. For the 300-page text, 21 endnotes are cited and six of them relate to Coogan&#x27;s previous books, a reminder that much of this tome consists of recycled material... Tim Pat Coogan... he is a decent, compassionate man who has made a significant contribution to Irish life. But he has not read up on Irish history; indeed, such is the paucity of his research efforts that this book amounts to a travesty of 20th-century Irish history&quot; (&quot;1916: The Mornings After&quot;).

<text>Great Britain, also known as the Kingdom of Great Britain, was a sovereign state in Western Europe from 1707 to the end of 1800. The state was created by the 1706 Treaty of Union and ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the Kingdom of England (including Wales) and the Kingdom of Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands, with the exception of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament at the Palace of Westminster, but distinct legal systems—English law and Scots law—remained in use, as did distinct educational systems and religious institutions, namely the Church of England and the Church of Scotland remaining as the national churches of England and Scotland respectively. 

The formerly separate kingdoms had been in personal union since the 1603 &quot;Union of the Crowns&quot; when James VI of Scotland became King of England and King of Ireland. Since James&#x27;s reign, who had been the first to refer to himself as &quot;king of Great Britain&quot;, a political union between the two mainland British kingdoms had been repeatedly attempted and aborted by both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland. Queen Anne () did not produce a clear Protestant heir and endangered the line of succession, with the laws of succession differing in the two kingdoms and threatening a return to the throne of Scotland of the Roman Catholic House of Stuart, exiled in the Glorious Revolution of 1688.

The resulting kingdom was in legislative and personal union with the Kingdom of Ireland from its inception, but the Parliament of Great Britain resisted early attempts to incorporate Ireland in the political union. The early years of the newly united kingdom were marked by Jacobite risings, particularly the Jacobite rising of 1715. The relative incapacity or ineptitude of the Hanoverian kings resulted in a growth in the powers of Parliament and a new role, that of &quot;prime minister&quot;, emerged in the heyday of Robert Walpole. The &quot;South Sea Bubble&quot; economic crisis was brought on by the failure of the South Sea Company, an early joint-stock company. The campaigns of Jacobitism ended in defeat for the Stuarts&#x27; cause in 1746.

The Hanoverian line of monarchs gave their names to the Georgian era and the term &quot;&quot; is typically used in the contexts of social and political history for Georgian architecture. The term &quot;Augustan literature&quot; is often used for Augustan drama, Augustan poetry and Augustan prose in the period 1700–1740s. The term &quot;Augustan&quot; refers to the acknowledgement of the influence of classical Latin from the ancient Roman Empire.

Victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War led to the dominance of the British Empire, which was to become the foremost global power for over a century. Great Britain dominated the Indian subcontinent through the trading and military expansion of the East India Company in colonial India. In wars against France, it gained control of both Upper and Lower Canada, and until suffering defeat in the American War of Independence, it also had dominion over the Thirteen Colonies. From 1787, Britain began the colonisation of New South Wales with the departure of the First Fleet in the process of penal transportation to Australia. Britain was a leading belligerent in the French Revolutionary Wars.

Great Britain was merged into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on 1 January 1801, with the Acts of Union 1800, enacted by Great Britain and Ireland, under George III, to merge with it the Kingdom of Ireland.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Britain&quot; descends from the Latin name for the island of Great Britain, or , the land of the Britons via the Old French (whence also Modern French ) and Middle English , . The term &quot;Great Britain&quot; was first used officially in 1474.

The use of the word &quot;Great&quot; before &quot;Britain&quot; originates in the French language, which uses for both Britain and Brittany. French therefore distinguishes between the two by calling Britain , a distinction which was transferred into English.

The Treaty of Union and the subsequent Acts of Union state that England and Scotland were to be &quot;United into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britain&quot;, and as such &quot;Great Britain&quot; was the official name of the state, as well as being used in titles such as &quot;Parliament of Great Britain&quot;.. The term &quot;Great Britain&quot; had been in use in some official contexts for a century, such as at the proclamation of Charles I&#x27;s acession to the throne in 1625 as &quot;King of Great Britain&quot;. 

The websites of the Scottish Parliament, the BBC, and others, including the Historical Association, refer to the state created on 1 May 1707 as &quot;the United Kingdom of Great Britain&quot;. Both the Acts and the Treaty describe the country as &quot;One Kingdom&quot; and a &quot;United Kingdom&quot;, leading some publications to treat the state as the &quot;United Kingdom&quot;. The term &quot;United Kingdom&quot; was sometimes used informally during the 18th century to describe the state.

==Political structure==
The kingdoms of England and Scotland, both in existence from the 9th century (with England incorporating Wales in the 16th century), were separate states until 1707. However, they had come into a personal union in 1603, when James VI of Scotland became king of England under the name of James I. This Union of the Crowns under the House of Stuart meant that the whole of the island of Great Britain was now ruled by a single monarch, who by virtue of holding the English crown also ruled over the Kingdom of Ireland. Each of the three kingdoms maintained its own parliament and laws. Various smaller islands were in the king&#x27;s domain, including the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.

This disposition changed dramatically when the Acts of Union 1707 came into force, with a single unified Crown of Great Britain and a single unified parliament. Ireland remained formally separate, with its own parliament, until the Acts of Union 1800 took effect. The Union of 1707 provided for a Protestant-only succession to the throne in accordance with the English Act of Settlement 1701; rather than Scotland&#x27;s Act of Security 1704 (c.3 (S)) and the Peace and War Act 1703 (c. 6) (S)), which ceased to have effect by the Repeal of Certain Scotch Acts 1707. The Act of Settlement required that the heir to the English throne be a descendant of the Electress Sophia of Hanover and not a Roman Catholic; this brought about the Hanoverian succession of George I of Great Britain in 1714.

Legislative power was vested in the Parliament of Great Britain, which replaced both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland. In practice, it was a continuation of the English parliament, sitting at the same location in Westminster, expanded to include representation from Scotland. As with the former Parliament of England and the modern Parliament of the United Kingdom, the Parliament of Great Britain was formally constituted of three elements: the House of Commons, the House of Lords, and the Crown. The right of the English peers to sit in the House of Lords remained unchanged, while the disproportionately large number of Scottish peers were permitted to send only sixteen Scottish representative peers, elected from amongst their number for the life of each parliament. Similarly, the members of the former English House of Commons continued as members of the British House of Commons, but as a reflection of the relative tax bases of the two countries the number of Scottish representatives was fixed at 45. Newly created peers in the Peerage of Great Britain, and their successors, had the right to sit in the Lords.

Despite the end of a separate parliament for Scotland, it retained its own laws and system of courts, as also its own established Presbyterian Church and control over its own schools. The social structure was highly hierarchical, and the same ruling class remained in control after 1707. Scotland continued to have its own universities, and with its intellectual community, especially in Edinburgh, the Scottish Enlightenment had a major impact on British, American, and European thinking.

==Role of Ireland==
As a result of Poynings&#x27; Law of 1495, the Parliament of Ireland was subordinate to the Parliament of England, and after 1707 to the Parliament of Great Britain. The Westminster parliament&#x27;s Declaratory Act 1719 (also called the Dependency of Ireland on Great Britain Act 1719) noted that the Irish House of Lords had recently &quot;assumed to themselves a Power and Jurisdiction to examine, correct and amend&quot; judgements of the Irish courts and declared that as the Kingdom of Ireland was subordinate to and dependent upon the crown of Great Britain, the King, through the Parliament of Great Britain, had &quot;full power and authority to make laws and statutes of sufficient validity to bind the Kingdom and people of Ireland&quot;. The Act was repealed by the Repeal of Act for Securing Dependence of Ireland Act 1782. The same year, the Irish constitution of 1782 produced a period of legislative freedom. However, the Irish Rebellion of 1798, which sought to end the subordination and dependency of the country on the British crown and to establish a republic, was one of the factors that led to the formation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801.

== History ==

=== Merging of Scottish and English Parliaments ===
The deeper political integration of her kingdoms was a key policy of Queen Anne, the last Stuart monarch of England and Scotland and the first monarch of Great Britain. A Treaty of Union was agreed in 1706, following negotiations between representatives of the parliaments of England and Scotland, and each parliament then passed separate Acts of Union to ratify it. The Acts came into effect on 1 May 1707, uniting the separate Parliaments and uniting the two kingdoms into a kingdom called Great Britain. Anne became the first monarch to occupy the unified British throne, and in line with Article 22 of the Treaty of Union Scotland and England each sent members to the new House of Commons of Great Britain. The Scottish and English ruling classes retained power, and each country kept its legal and educational systems, as well as its established Church. United, they formed a larger economy, and the Scots began to provide soldiers and colonial officials to the new British forces and Empire. However, one notable difference at the outset was that the new Scottish members of parliament and representative peers were elected by the outgoing Parliament of Scotland, while all existing members of the Houses of Commons and Lords at Westminster remained in office.

===Queen Anne, 1702–1714===

During the War of the Spanish Succession (1702–14) England continued its policy of forming and funding alliances, especially with the Dutch Republic and the Holy Roman Empire against their common enemy, King Louis XIV of France. Queen Anne, who reigned 1702–1714, was the central decision maker, working closely with her advisers, especially her remarkably successful senior general, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. The war was a financial drain, for Britain had to finance its allies and hire foreign soldiers. Stalemate on the battlefield and war weariness on the home front set in toward the end. The anti-war Tory politicians won control of Parliament in 1710 and forced a peace. The concluding Treaty of Utrecht was highly favourable for Britain. Spain lost its empire in Europe and faded away as a great power, while working to better manage its colonies in the Americas. The First British Empire, based upon the English overseas possessions, was enlarged. From France, Great Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain Gibraltar and Menorca. Gibraltar became a major naval base which allowed Great Britain to control the entrance from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean. The war marks the weakening of French military, diplomatic and economic dominance, and the arrival on the world scene of Britain as a major imperial, military and financial power. British historian G. M. Trevelyan argued:
:That Treaty [of Utrecht], which ushered in the stable and characteristic period of Eighteenth-Century civilization, marked the end of danger to Europe from the old French monarchy, and it marked a change of no less significance to the world at large,—the maritime, commercial and financial supremacy of Great Britain.

===Hanoverian succession: 1714–1760===

In the 18th century England, and after 1707 Great Britain, rose to become the world&#x27;s dominant colonial power, with France as its main rival. The pre-1707 English overseas possessions became the nucleus of the First British Empire.

&quot;In 1714 the ruling class was so bitterly divided that many feared a civil war might break out on Queen Anne&#x27;s death&quot;, wrote historian W. A. Speck. A few hundred of the richest ruling class and landed gentry families controlled parliament, but were deeply split, with Tories committed to the legitimacy of the Stuart &quot;Old Pretender&quot;, then in exile. The Whigs strongly supported the Hanoverians, in order to ensure a Protestant succession. The new king, George I was a foreign prince and had a small English standing army to support him, with military support from his native Hanover and from his allies in the Netherlands. In the Jacobite rising of 1715, based in Scotland, the Earl of Mar led eighteen Jacobite peers and 10,000 men, with the aim of overthrowing the new king and restoring the Stuarts. Poorly organised, it was decisively defeated. Several of the leaders were executed, many others dispossessed of their lands, and some 700 prominent followers deported to forced labour on sugar plantations in the West Indies. A key decision was the refusal of the Pretender to change his religion from Roman Catholic to Anglican, which would have mobilised much more of the Tory element. The Whigs came to power, under the leadership of James Stanhope, Charles Townshend, the Earl of Sunderland, and Robert Walpole. Many Tories were driven out of national and local government, and new laws were passed to impose greater national control. The right of habeas corpus was restricted; to reduce electoral instability, the Septennial Act 1715 increased the maximum life of a parliament from three years to seven.

====George I: 1714–1727====
During his reign, George I spent only about half as much of his time overseas as had William III, who also reigned for thirteen years. Jeremy Black has argued that George wanted to spend even more time in Hanover: &quot;His visits, in 1716, 1719, 1720, 1723 and 1725, were lengthy, and, in total, he spent a considerable part of his reign abroad. These visits were also occasions both for significant negotiations and for the exchange of information and opinion...The visits to Hanover also provided critics with the opportunity...to argue that British interests were being neglected...George could not speak English, and all relevant documents from his British ministers were translated into French for him...Few British ministers or diplomats...knew German, or could handle it in precise discussion.&quot;

George I supported the expulsion of the Tories from power; they remained in the political wilderness until his great-grandson George III came to power in 1760 and began to replace Whigs with Tories. George I has often been caricatured in the history books, but according to his biographer Ragnhild Hatton:
====Age of Walpole: 1721–1742====
Robert Walpole (1676–1745) was a son of the landed gentry who rose to power in the House of Commons from 1721 to 1742. He became the first &quot;prime minister&quot;, a term in use by 1727. In 1742, he was created Earl of Orford and was succeeded as prime minister by two of his followers, Henry Pelham (1743–1754) and Pelham&#x27;s brother the Duke of Newcastle (1754–1762). Clayton Roberts summarizes Walpole&#x27;s new functions:
=====South Sea Bubble=====

Corporate stock was a new phenomenon, not well understood, except for the strong gossip among financiers that fortunes could be made overnight. The South Sea Company, although originally set up to trade with the Spanish Empire, quickly turned most of its attention to very high risk financing, involving £30 million, some 60 per cent of the entire British national debt. It set up a scheme that invited stock owners to turn in their certificates for stock in the Company at a par value of £100—the idea was that they would profit by the rising price of their stock. Everyone with connections wanted in on the bonanza, and many other outlandish schemes found gullible takers. South Sea stock peaked at £1,060 on 25 June 1720. Then the bubble burst, and by the end of September it had fallen to £150. Hundreds of prominent men had borrowed to buy stock high; their apparent profits had vanished, but they were liable to repay the full amount of the loans. Many went bankrupt, and many more lost fortunes.

Confidence in the entire national financial and political system collapsed. Parliament investigated and concluded that there had been widespread fraud by the company directors and corruption in the Cabinet. Among Cabinet members implicated were the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Postmaster General, and a Secretary of State, as well as two other leading men, Lord Stanhope and Lord Sunderland. Walpole had dabbled in the speculation himself but was not a major player. He rose to the challenge, as the new First Lord of the Treasury, of resolving the financial and political disaster. The economy was basically healthy, and the panic ended. Working with the financiers he successfully restored confidence in the system. However, public opinion, as shaped by the many prominent men who had lost so much money so quickly, demanded revenge. Walpole supervised the process, which removed all 33 company directors and stripped them of, on average, 82% of their wealth. The money went to the victims. The government bought the stock of the South Sea Company for £33 and sold it to the Bank of England and the East India Company, the only other two corporations big enough to handle the challenge. Walpole made sure that King George and his mistresses were not embarrassed, and by the margin of three votes he saved several key government officials from impeachment.
Stanhope and Sunderland died of natural causes, leaving Walpole alone as the dominant figure in British politics. The public hailed him as the saviour of the financial system, and historians credit him with rescuing the Whig government, and indeed the Hanoverian dynasty, from total disgrace.

====Patronage and corruption====
Walpole was a master of the effective use of patronage, as were Pelham and Lord Newcastle. They each paid close attention to the work of bestowing upon their political allies high places, lifetime pensions, honours, lucrative government contracts, and help at election time. In turn the friends enabled them to control Parliament. Thus in 1742, over 140 members of parliament held powerful positions thanks in part to Walpole, including 24 men at the royal court, 50 in the government agencies, and the rest with sinecures or other handsome emoluments, often in the range of £500 – £1000 per year. Usually there was little or no work involved. Walpole also distributed highly attractive ecclesiastical appointments. When the Court in 1725 instituted a new order of chivalry, the Order of the Bath, Walpole immediately seized the opportunity. He made sure that most of the 36 men honoured were peers and members of parliament who would provide him with useful connections. Walpole himself became enormously wealthy, investing heavily in his estate at Houghton Hall and its large collection of European master paintings.

Walpole&#x27;s methods won him victory after victory, but aroused furious opposition. Historian John H. Plumb wrote:
The opposition called for &quot;patriotism&quot; and looked at the Prince of Wales as the future &quot;Patriot King&quot;. Walpole supporters ridiculed the very term &quot;patriot&quot;.

The opposition Country Party attacked Walpole relentlessly, primarily targeting his patronage, which they denounced as corruption. In turn, Walpole imposed censorship on the London theatre and subsidised writers such as William Arnall and others who rejected the charge of political corruption by arguing that corruption is the universal human condition. Furthermore, they argued, political divisiveness was also universal and inevitable because of selfish passions that were integral to human nature. Arnall argued that government must be strong enough to control conflict, and in that regard Walpole was quite successful. This style of &quot;court&quot; political rhetoric continued through the 18th century. Lord Cobham, a leading soldier, used his own connections to build up an opposition after 1733. Young William Pitt and George Grenville joined Cobham&#x27;s faction—they were called &quot;Cobham&#x27;s Cubs&quot;. They became leading enemies of Walpole and both later became prime minister.

By 1741, Walpole was facing mounting criticism on foreign policy—he was accused of entangling Britain in a useless war with Spain—and mounting allegations of corruption. On 13 February 1741, Samuel Sandys, a former ally, called for his removal. He said:
Walpole&#x27;s allies defeated a censure motion by a vote of 209 to 106, but Walpole&#x27;s coalition lost seats in the election of 1741, and by a narrow margin he was finally forced out of office in early 1742.

=====Walpole&#x27;s foreign policy=====
Walpole secured widespread support with his policy of avoiding war. He used his influence to prevent George II from entering the War of the Polish Succession in 1733, because it was a dispute between the Bourbons and the Habsburgs. He boasted, &quot;There are 50,000 men slain in Europe this year, and not one Englishman.&quot; Walpole himself let others, especially his brother-in-law Lord Townshend, handle foreign policy until about 1726, then took charge. A major challenge for his administration was the royal role as simultaneous ruler of Hanover, a small German state that was opposed to Prussian supremacy. George I and George II saw a French alliance as the best way to neutralise Prussia. They forced a dramatic reversal of British foreign policy, which for centuries had seen France as England&#x27;s greatest enemy. However, the bellicose King Louis XIV died in 1715, and the regents who ran France were preoccupied with internal affairs. King Louis XV came of age in 1726, and his elderly chief minister Cardinal Fleury collaborated informally with Walpole to prevent a major war and keep the peace. Both sides wanted peace, which allowed both countries enormous cost savings, and recovery from expensive wars.

Henry Pelham became prime minister in 1744 and continued Walpole&#x27;s policies. He worked for an end to the War of the Austrian Succession. His financial policy was a major success once peace had been signed in 1748. He demobilised the armed forces, and reduced government spending from £12 million to £7 million. He refinanced the national debt, dropping the interest rate from 4% p.a. to 3% p.a. Taxes had risen to pay for the war, but in 1752 he reduced the land tax from four shillings to two shillings in the pound: that is, from 20% to 10%.

=====Lower debt and taxes=====
By avoiding wars, Walpole could lower taxes. He reduced the national debt with a sinking fund, and by negotiating lower interest rates. He reduced the land tax from four shillings in 1721, to 3s in 1728, 2s in 1731 and finally to only 1s (i.e. 5%) in 1732. His long-term goal was to replace the land tax, which was paid by the local gentry, with excise and customs taxes, which were paid by merchants and ultimately by consumers. Walpole joked that the landed gentry resembled hogs, which squealed loudly whenever anyone laid hands on them. By contrast, he said, merchants were like sheep, and yielded their wool without complaint. The joke backfired in 1733 when he was defeated in a major battle to impose excise taxes on wine and tobacco. To reduce the threat of smuggling, the tax was to be collected not at ports but at warehouses. This new proposal, however, was extremely unpopular with the public, and aroused the opposition of the merchants because of the supervision it would involve. Walpole was defeated as his strength in Parliament dropped a notch.

=====Walpole&#x27;s reputation=====
Historians hold Walpole&#x27;s record in high regard, though there has been a recent tendency to share credit more widely among his allies. W. A. Speck wrote that Walpole&#x27;s uninterrupted run of 20 years as Prime Minister

He was a Whig from the gentry class, who first arrived in Parliament in 1701, and held many senior positions. He was a country squire and looked to country gentlemen for his political base. Historian Frank O&#x27;Gorman said his leadership in Parliament reflected his &quot;reasonable and persuasive oratory, his ability to move both the emotions as well as the minds of men, and, above all, his extraordinary self-confidence.&quot; Julian Hoppit has said Walpole&#x27;s policies sought moderation: he worked for peace, lower taxes, growing exports, and allowed a little more tolerance for Protestant Dissenters. He avoided controversy and high-intensity disputes, as his middle way attracted moderates from both the Whig and Tory camps. H.T. Dickinson summed up his historical role:
===Age of George III, 1760–1820===
====Victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War, 1756–1763====

The Seven Years&#x27; War, which began in 1756, was the first war waged on a global scale and saw British involvement in Europe, India, North America, the Caribbean, the Philippines, and coastal Africa. The results were highly favourable for Britain, and a major disaster for France. Key decisions were largely in the hands of William Pitt the Elder. The war started poorly. Britain lost the island of Minorca in 1756, and suffered a series of defeats in North America. After years of setbacks and mediocre results, British luck turned in the &quot;miracle year&quot; (&quot;Annus Mirabilis&quot;) of 1759. The British had entered the year anxious about a French invasion, but by the end of the year, they were victorious in all theatres. In the Americas, they captured Fort Ticonderoga (Carillon), drove the French out of the Ohio Country, captured Quebec City in Canada as a result of the decisive Battle of the Plains of Abraham, and captured the rich sugar island of Guadeloupe in the West Indies. In India, the John Company repulsed French forces besieging Madras.

In Europe, British troops partook in a decisive Allied victory at the Battle of Minden. The victory over the French navy at the Battle of Lagos and the decisive Battle of Quiberon Bay ended threats of a French invasion, and confirmed Britain&#x27;s reputation as the world&#x27;s foremost naval power. The Treaty of Paris of 1763 marked the high point of the First British Empire. France&#x27;s future in North America ended, as New France (Quebec) came under British control. In India, the third Carnatic War had left France still in control of several small enclaves, but with military restrictions and an obligation to support the British client states, effectively leaving the future of India to Great Britain. The British victory over France in the Seven Years&#x27; War therefore left Great Britain as the world&#x27;s dominant colonial power, with a bitter France thirsting for revenge.

====Evangelical religion and social reform====

The evangelical movement inside and outside the Church of England gained strength in the late 18th and early 19th century. The movement challenged the traditional religious sensibility that emphasized a code of honour for the upper class, and suitable behaviour for everyone else, together with faithful observances of rituals. John Wesley (1703–1791) and his followers preached revivalist religion, trying to convert individuals to a personal relationship with Christ through Bible reading, regular prayer, and especially the revival experience. Wesley himself preached 52,000 times, calling on men and women to &quot;redeem the time&quot; and save their souls. Wesley always operated inside the Church of England, but at his death, it set up outside institutions that became the Methodist Church. It stood alongside the traditional nonconformist churches, Presbyterians, Congregationalist, Baptists, Unitarians and Quakers. The nonconformist churches, however, were less influenced by revivalism.

The Church of England remained dominant, but it had a growing evangelical, revivalist faction in the &quot;Low Church&quot;. Its leaders included William Wilberforce and Hannah More. It reached the upper class through the Clapham Sect. It did not seek political reform, but rather the opportunity to save souls through political action by freeing slaves, abolishing the duel, prohibiting cruelty to children and animals, stopping gambling, and avoiding frivolity on the Sabbath; evangelicals read the Bible every day. All souls were equal in God&#x27;s view, but not all bodies, so evangelicals did not challenge the hierarchical structure of English society.

===First British Empire===
The first British Empire was based largely in mainland North America and the West Indies, with a growing presence in India. Emigration from Britain went mostly to the Thirteen Colonies and the West Indies, with some to Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. Few permanent settlers went to British India, although many young men went there in the hope of making money and returning home.

====Mercantilist trade policy====
Mercantilism was the basic policy imposed by Great Britain on its overseas possessions. Mercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants—and kept others out—by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries to maximise exports from and minimise imports to the realm. The government had to fight smuggling—which became a favourite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch. The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in London and other British ports. The government spent much of its revenue on a superb Royal Navy, which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. Thus the Royal Navy captured New Amsterdam (later New York City) in 1664. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.

====Loss of the 13 American colonies====

During the 1760s and 1770s, relations with the Thirteen Colonies turned from benign neglect to outright revolt, primarily because of the British Parliament&#x27;s insistence on taxing colonists without their consent to recover losses incurred protecting the American Colonists during the French and Indian War (1754–1763). In 1775, the American Revolutionary War began at the Battles of Lexington and Concord, and the Americans then trapped the British Army in Boston in the Siege of Boston and suppressed the Loyalists who supported The Crown.

On 4 July 1776, the Second Continental Congress, representing the Thirteen Colonies, unanimously adopted and issued the Declaration of Independence. The Second Continental Congress charged the Committee of Five with authoring the Declaration, but the committee, in turn, largely relied on Thomas Jefferson, who authored its first draft.

Under the military leadership of Continental Army general George Washington and with some economic and military assistance from France, the Dutch Republic, and Spain, the United States held off successive British invasions. The Americans captured two main British armies in 1777 and 1781. After that, King George III lost control of Parliament and was unable to continue the war, which was brought to an end with the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which acknowledged the independence and sovereignty of the thirteen colonies and recognized the United States.

The American Revolutionary War, which lasted from 1775 to 1783, was expensive but the British financed it successfully. Approximately 8,500 British troops were killed in action during the war.

===Second British Empire===
The loss of the Thirteen Colonies marked the transition between the &quot;first&quot; and &quot;second&quot; empires, in which Britain shifted its attention away from the Americas to Asia, the Pacific and later Africa. Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot;, published in 1776, had argued that colonies were redundant, and that free trade should replace the old mercantilist policies that had characterised the first period of colonial expansion, dating back to the protectionism of Spain and Portugal. The growth of trade between the newly independent United States and Great Britain after 1781 confirmed Smith&#x27;s view that political control was not necessary for economic success.

====Canada====

After a series of &quot;French and Indian wars&quot;, the British took over most of France&#x27;s North American operations in 1763. New France became Quebec. Great Britain&#x27;s policy was to respect Quebec&#x27;s Catholic establishment as well as its semi-feudal legal, economic, and social systems. By the Quebec Act of 1774, the province of Quebec was enlarged to include the western holdings of the American colonies. In the American Revolutionary War, Halifax, Nova Scotia became Britain&#x27;s major base for naval action. They repulsed an American revolutionary invasion in 1776, but in 1777 a British invasion army was captured in New York, encouraging France to enter the war.

After the American victory, between 40,000 and 60,000 defeated Loyalists migrated, some bringing their slaves. Most families were given free land to compensate their losses. Several thousand free blacks also arrived; most of them later went to Sierra Leone in Africa. The 14,000 Loyalists who went to the Saint John and Saint Croix river valleys, then part of Nova Scotia, were not welcomed by the locals. Therefore, in 1784 the British split off New Brunswick as a separate colony. The Constitutional Act of 1791 created the provinces of Upper Canada (mainly English-speaking) and Lower Canada (mainly French-speaking) to defuse tensions between the French and English-speaking communities, and implemented governmental systems similar to those employed in Great Britain, with the intention of asserting imperial authority and not allowing the sort of popular control of government that was perceived to have led to the American Revolution.

====Australia====

In 1770, British explorer James Cook had discovered the eastern coast of Australia whilst on a scientific voyage to the South Pacific. In 1778, Joseph Banks, Cook&#x27;s botanist on the voyage, presented evidence to the government on the suitability of Botany Bay for the establishment of a penal settlement. Australia marks the beginning of the Second British Empire. It was planned by the government in London and designed as a replacement for the lost American colonies. The American Loyalist James Matra in 1783 wrote &quot;A Proposal for Establishing a Settlement in New South Wales&quot; proposing the establishment of a colony composed of American Loyalists, Chinese and South Sea Islanders (but not convicts). Matra reasoned that the land was suitable for plantations of sugar, cotton and tobacco; New Zealand timber and hemp or flax could prove valuable commodities; it could form a base for Pacific trade; and it could be a suitable compensation for displaced American Loyalists. At the suggestion of Secretary of State Lord Sydney, Matra amended his proposal to include convicts as settlers, considering that this would benefit both &quot;Economy to the Publick, &amp; Humanity to the Individual&quot;. The government adopted the basics of Matra&#x27;s plan in 1784, and funded the settlement of convicts.

In 1787 the First Fleet set sail, carrying the first shipment of convicts to the colony. It arrived in January 1788.

====India====
India was not directly ruled by the British government, instead certain parts were seized by the East India Company, a private, for-profit corporation, with its own army. The &quot;John Company&quot; (as it was nicknamed) took direct control of half of India and built friendly relations with the other half, which was controlled by numerous local princes. Its goal was trade, and vast profits for the Company officials, not the building of the British empire. Company interests expanded during the 18th century to include control of territory as the old Mughal Empire declined in power and the East India Company battled for the spoils with the French East India Company (&quot;Compagnie française des Indes orientales&quot;) during the Carnatic Wars of the 1740s and 1750s. Victories at the Battle of Plassey and Battle of Buxar by Robert Clive gave the Company control over Bengal and made it the major military and political power in India. In the following decades it gradually increased the extent of territories under its control, ruling either directly or in cooperation with local princes. Although Britain itself only had a small standing army, the company had a large and well trained force, the presidency armies, with British officers commanding native Indian troops (called sepoys).

===Battling the French Revolution and Napoleon===
With the regicide of King Louis XVI in 1793, the French Revolution represented a contest of ideologies between conservative, royalist Britain and radical Republican France. The long bitter wars with France 1793–1815, saw anti-Catholicism emerge as the glue that held the three kingdoms together. From the upper classes to the lower classes, Protestants were brought together from England, Scotland and Ireland into a profound distrust and distaste for all things French. That enemy nation was depicted as the natural home of misery and oppression because of its inherent inability to shed the darkness of Catholic superstition and clerical manipulation.

====Napoleon====
It was not only Britain&#x27;s position on the world stage that was threatened: Napoleon, who came to power in 1799, threatened invasion of Great Britain itself, and with it, a fate similar to the countries of continental Europe that his armies had overrun. The Napoleonic Wars were therefore ones in which the British invested all the moneys and energies it could raise. French ports were blockaded by the Royal Navy.

====Ireland====
The French Revolution revived religious and political grievances in Ireland. In 1798, Irish nationalists, under Protestant leadership, plotted the Irish Rebellion of 1798, believing that the French would help them to overthrow the British. They hoped for significant French support, which never came. The uprising was very poorly organized, and quickly suppressed by much more powerful British forces. Including many bloody reprisals, the total death toll was in the range of 10,000 to 30,000.

Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger firmly believed that the only solution to the problem was a union of Great Britain and Ireland. The union was established by the Act of Union 1800; compensation and patronage ensured the support of the Irish Parliament. Great Britain and Ireland were formally united on 1 January 1801. The Irish Parliament was closed down.

==Parliament of Great Britain==
Under the terms of the Treaty of Union, both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland were abolished and subsumed into a new Parliament of Great Britain which was to meet in London. Additionally, both the Privy Council of England and the Privy Council of Scotland, the bodies which advised the monarch in the respective kingdoms, were abolished in 1708 and subsumed into a new Privy Council of Great Britain.

The Parliament of Great Britain consisted of the House of Lords (an unelected upper house of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal) and the House of Commons, the lower chamber, which was elected periodically. In England and Wales parliamentary constituencies remained unchanged throughout the existence of the Parliament.

==Monarchs==

Anne was from the House of Stuart and the Georges were from the House of Hanover.
Anne had been Queen of England, Queen of Scots, and Queen of Ireland since 1702.

* Anne, Queen of Great Britain (1707–1714)
* George I of Great Britain (1714–1727)
* George II of Great Britain (1727–1760)
* George III Great Britain (1760–1800)

George III continued as King of the United Kingdom until his death in 1820.

<doc id="158020" wikidata="Q150610" url="?curid=158020" title="Sacculina">
<text>Sacculina is a genus of barnacles that is a parasitic castrator of crabs. They belong to a group called Rhizocephala. The adults bear no resemblance to the barnacles that cover ships, whales, and piers; they are recognised as barnacles because their larval forms are like other members of the barnacle class Cirripedia. The prevalence of this crustacean parasite in its crab host can be as high as 50%.

==Habitat==
&quot;Sacculina&quot; live in a marine environment. During their larval stage they are pelagic, but as they form into adults they live as ectoparasites on crabs. Their primary host is the green crab, which is native to the Eastern Atlantic Ocean. Though these crabs have spread to other bodies of water, it is not believed that &quot;Sacculina&quot; barnacles have traveled with them to these new localities.

==Anatomy==
The body of the adult parasite can be divided into two parts: one part is called the &quot;externa&quot; where the bulbous reproductive organ of the parasite sticks out of the abdomen of the host. The other part is called the &quot;interna&quot; which is inside the host&#x27;s body. This part is composed of root-like tendrils that wrap themselves around the host&#x27;s organs, which gives its group name of Rhizocephala, meaning &quot;root-head&quot;. Through microCT scans, these roots have been discovered to wrap around certain organs of the body, with most around the hepatopancreas of crustaceans. This area is primarily for absorbing nutrients, which would explain why most concentrate in that region. In a similar species called &quot;Briarosaccus&quot; roots were seen extending to the brain and central nervous system, which is a hypothesis to help explain how parasites like these can manipulate their hosts&#x27; behavior.

==Life cycle==

The female &quot;Sacculina&quot; larva finds a crab and walks on it until she finds a joint. She then molts into a form called a kentrogon, which then injects her soft body into the crab while her shell falls off. The &quot;Sacculina&quot; grows in the crab, emerging as a sac, known as an &quot;externa&quot;, on the underside of the crab&#x27;s rear thorax, where the crab&#x27;s eggs would be incubated. Parasitic &quot;Sacculina&quot; destroy a crab&#x27;s genitalia, rendering the crab permanently infertile.

After this invasion of the &quot;Sacculina&quot;, the crab is unable to perform the normal function of molting. This results in a loss of nutrition for the crab, and impairs its overall growth. The natural ability of regrowing a severed claw that is commonly used for defense purposes is therefore lost after the infestation of &quot;Sacculina&quot;.

The male &quot;Sacculina&quot; &#x27;larva&#x27; looks for a female &quot;Sacculina&quot; on the underside of a crab. He then implants his cells into a pocket in the female&#x27;s body called the &quot;testis&quot;, where the male cells then produce spermatozoa to fertilize eggs. 

When a female &quot;Sacculina&quot; is implanted in a male crab, it interferes with the crab&#x27;s hormonal balance. This sterilizes it and changes the bodily layout of the crab to resemble that of a female crab by widening and flattening its abdomen, among other things. The female &quot;Sacculina&quot; then forces the crab&#x27;s body to release hormones, causing it to act like a female crab, even to the point of performing female mating dances. If the parasite is removed from the host, female crabs will normally regenerate new ovarian tissue, while males usually develop complete or partial ovaries instead of testes.

Although all energy otherwise expended on reproduction is directed to the &quot;Sacculina&quot;, the crab develops a nurturing behavior typical of a normal female crab. The natural hatching process of a crab consists of the female finding a high rock and grooming its brood pouch on its abdomen and releasing the fertilized eggs in the water through a bobbing motion. The female crab stirs the water with her claw to aid the flow of the water. When the hatching larvae of &quot;Sacculina&quot; are ready to emerge from the brood pouch of female &quot;Sacculina&quot;, the crab performs a similar process. The crab shoots them out in pulses, creating a large cloud of &quot;Sacculina&quot; larvae. The crab uses the familiar technique of stirring the water to aid in flow.

==Life span==
&quot;Sacculina&quot; are primarily host dependent so their life span matches that of their hosts. Crabs usually have a life span anywhere from 1 to 2 years.

== Biological control agents ==
&quot;Sacculina&quot; has been suggested to be used as a type of biological control agent to help reduce the populations of the invasive green crab. This is controversial because &quot;Sacculina&quot; can also use native crab species as their host and there would be no way to control or stop them from attacking native species.

It was most famously regarded as a stem-group chelicerate, a group which includes horseshoe crabs, spiders and scorpions, although subsequent phylogenetic studies have not always supported this conclusion. Its chelicerate affinities regain support in later observations, alongside the reassignment of &quot;Habelia optata&quot; as a sanctacaridid-related basal chelicerate. It has been placed as a member of the extinct family Sanctacarididae alongside &quot;Wisangocaris&quot; and &quot;Utahcaris&quot;.

&quot;Sanctacaris&quot; specimens range from 46 to 93 mm in length. The head bears five pairs of grasping appendages (corresponding to chelicerate&#x27;s pedipalps and walking legs) and a sixth pair of posterior appendages (correspond to horseshoe crab&#x27;s chilaria). The grasping appendages each bear an antenna-like exopods. There are 11 body segments, with the former 10 each bearing a pair of biramous appendages with flap-like exopod and reduced leg-like endopod. There is a broad, flat paddle-like telson.

Originally &quot;Sanctacaris&quot; was called informally &#x27;Santa Claws&#x27;. Its Latin name translates as &quot;saintly crab&quot;. Unlike most other Burgess forms, &quot;Sanctacaris&quot; is not present in Charles Walcott&#x27;s 1909 quarry and was discovered at a different level by Desmond Collins in 1980–1981.

== Etymology ==
The generic name &quot;&quot;Sanctacaris&quot; &quot; is a compound of the Latin words &quot;sanctus&quot; (saint or sacred) and &quot;caris&quot; (meaning crab or shrimp, a common suffix used in aquatic arthropods). The specific name of the type species &quot;&quot;uncata&quot; &quot; means &quot;claws&quot; in Latin and is named after the claw-shaped appendages on the head of this species. The name &quot;saint claws&quot; refers to Santa Claus, which was the field name used to refer to &quot;Sanctacaris&quot;.

== Ecology ==
The robust gnathobases, alongside the fact that fellow sanctacaridid &quot;Wisangocaris&quot; has been found with trilobite fragments in its stomach, has led to suggestions that &quot;Sanctacaris&quot; was durophagous, feeding on hard shelled organisms.

<text>The First Dáil () was Dáil Éireann as it convened from 1919 to 1921. It was the first meeting of the unicameral parliament of the revolutionary Irish Republic. In the December 1918 election to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the Irish republican party Sinn Féin won a landslide victory in Ireland. In line with their manifesto, its MPs refused to take their seats, and on 21 January 1919 they founded a separate parliament in Dublin called &quot;Dáil Éireann&quot; (&quot;Assembly of Ireland&quot;). They declared Irish independence, ratifying the Proclamation of the Irish Republic that had been issued in the 1916 Easter Rising, and adopted a provisional constitution.

Its first meeting happened on the same day as one of the first engagements of what became the Irish War of Independence. Although the Dáil had not authorised any armed action, it became a &quot;symbol of popular resistance and a source of legitimacy for fighting men in the guerrilla war that developed&quot;.

The Dáil was outlawed by the Dublin Castle administration in September 1919, and thereafter it met in secret. The First Dáil met 21 times and its main business was establishing the Irish Republic. It created the beginnings of an independent Irish government and state apparatus. Following the May 1921 elections, the First Dáil was succeeded by the Second Dáil of 1921–1922.

==Background==
In the early 20th century Ireland was a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and was represented in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom by 105 Members of Parliament (MPs). From 1882, most Irish MPs were members of the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) who strove in several Home Rule Bills to achieve self-government for Ireland within the United Kingdom. This resulted in the Government of Ireland Act 1914, but its implementation was postponed with the outbreak of World War I.

The founder of the small Sinn Féin party, Arthur Griffith, believed Irish nationalists should emulate the Hungarian nationalists who had gained legislative independence from Austria. In 1867, Hungarian representatives had boycotted the Imperial parliament in Vienna and unilaterally established their own legislature in Budapest, resulting in the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. Griffith argued that Irish nationalists should follow this &quot;policy of passive resistance – with occasional excursions into the domain of active resistance&quot;.

In April 1916, Irish rebels launched the Easter Uprising against British rule in Ireland, proclaiming an independent Irish Republic. After a week of heavy fighting, mostly in Dublin, the rebellion was suppressed by British forces, who took 3,500 people prisoner, 1,800 of whom were sent to internment camps or prisons in Britain; most of the rebellion&#x27;s leaders were executed. The rebellion, the British response to it, and the British government&#x27;s failed attempt to introduce conscription in Ireland led to greater public support for Sinn Féin and Irish independence. 

In the 1918 general election, Sinn Féin won 73 out of the 105 Irish seats in the House of Commons. In 25 constituencies, Sinn Féin won the seats unopposed. Elections were held almost entirely under the &#x27;first-past-the-post voting&#x27; system. The recent Representation of the People Act had increased the Irish electorate from around 700,000 to about two million. Unionists (including the Ulster Unionist Labour Association) won 26 seats, all but three of which were in east Ulster, and the IPP won only six (down from 84), all but one in Ulster. The Labour Party did not stand in the election, allowing the electorate to decide between home rule or a republic by having a clear choice between the two nationalist parties. The IPP won a smaller share of seats than votes due to the first-past-the-post system.

Sinn Féin&#x27;s manifesto had pledged to establish an Irish Republic by founding &quot;a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies&quot; which could then &quot;speak and act in the name of the Irish people&quot;. Once elected the Sinn Féin MPs chose to follow through with their manifesto.

==First meeting==
Sinn Féin had held several meetings in early January to plan the first sitting of the Dáil. On 8 January, it publicly announced its intention to convene the assembly. On the night of 11 January, the Dublin Metropolitan Police raided Sinn Féin headquarters and seized drafts of the documents that would be issued at the assembly. As a result, the Dublin Castle administration was fully aware what was being planned.

The first meeting of Dáil Éireann began at 3:30 pm on 21 January in the Round Room of the Mansion House, the residence of the Lord Mayor of Dublin. It lasted about two hours. The packed audience in the Round Room rose in acclaim for the members of the Dáil as they walked into the room, and many waved Irish tricolour flags. A tricolour was also displayed above the lectern. Among the audience were the Lord Mayor Laurence O&#x27;Neill and Maud Gonne. Scores of Irish and international journalists were reporting on the proceedings. Outside, Dawson Street was thronged with onlookers. Irish Volunteers controlled the crowds, and police were also present. Precautions had been taken in case the assembly was raided by the police. A reception for soldiers of the British Army&#x27;s Royal Dublin Fusiliers, who had been prisoners of war in Germany, had ended shortly beforehand.

Twenty-seven Sinn Féin MPs attended. Invitations had been sent to all elected MPs in Ireland, but the Unionists and Irish Parliamentary Party MPs declined to attend. The IPP&#x27;s Thomas Harbison, MP for North East Tyrone, acknowledged the invitation but wrote he should &quot;decline for obvious reasons&quot;. He expressed sympathy with the call for Ireland to have a hearing at the Paris Peace Conference. Sir Robert Henry Woods was the only unionist who declined rather than ignored his invitation. Sixty-nine Sinn Féin MPs had been elected (four of whom represented more than one constituency), but thirty-four were in prison, and eight others could not attend for various reasons. Those in prison were described as being &quot;imprisoned by the foreigners&quot; (&quot;fé ghlas ag Gallaibh&quot;). Michael Collins and Harry Boland were marked in the roll as &quot;i láthair&quot; (present), but the record was later amended to show that they were &quot;as láthair&quot; (absent). At the time, they were in England planning the escape of Éamon de Valera from Lincoln Prison, and did not wish to draw attention to their absence.

Being a first and highly symbolic meeting, the proceedings of the Dáil were held wholly in the Irish language, although translations of the documents were also read out in English and French. George Noble Plunkett opened the session and nominated Cathal Brugha as acting Ceann Comhairle (chairman or speaker), which was accepted. Both actions &quot;immediately associated the Dáil with the 1916 Rising, during which Brugha had been seriously wounded, and after which Plunkett&#x27;s son had been executed as a signatory to the famed Proclamation&quot;. Brugha then called upon Father Michael O&#x27;Flanagan to say a prayer.

===Declarations and constitution===

A number of short documents were then read out and adopted. These were the:

*Dáil Constitution
*Declaration of Independence
*Message to the Free Nations of the World – calling for international recognition of Irish independence
*Democratic Programme – a declaration of social and economic policy

These documents asserted that the Dáil was the parliament of a sovereign state called the &quot;Irish Republic&quot;. With the Declaration of Independence, the Dáil ratified the Proclamation of the Irish Republic that had been issued in the 1916 Rising, and pledged &quot;to make this declaration effective by every means&quot;. It stated that &quot;the elected representatives of the Irish people alone have power to make laws binding on the people of Ireland, and that the Irish Parliament is the only Parliament to which that people will give its allegiance&quot;. It also declared &quot;foreign government in Ireland to be an invasion of our national right&quot; and demanded the withdrawal of British forces from Irish soil. Once the Declaration was read, Cathal Brugha said (in Irish): &quot;Deputies, you understand from what is asserted in this Declaration that we are now done with England. Let the world know it and those who are concerned bear it in mind. For come what may now, whether it be death itself, the great deed is done&quot;.

The Message to the Free Nations called for international recognition of Irish independence and for Ireland to be allowed to make its case at the Paris Peace Conference. It stated that &quot;the existing state of war between Ireland and England can never be ended until Ireland is definitely evacuated by the armed forces of England&quot;. Although this could have been a &quot;rhetorical flourish&quot;, it was the nearest the Dáil came to a declaration of war.

The Dáil Constitution was a brief provisional constitution. It stated that the Dáil had &quot;full powers to legislate&quot; and would be composed of representatives &quot;chosen by the people of Ireland from the present constituencies of the country&quot;. It established an executive government or Ministry (&quot;Aireacht&quot;) made up of a president (&quot;Príomh-Aire&quot;) chosen by the Dáil, and ministers of finance, home affairs, foreign affairs and defence. Cathal Brugha was elected as the first, temporary president. He would be succeeded, in April, by Éamon de Valera.

===Reactions===
The first meeting of the Dáil and its declaration of independence was headline news in Ireland and abroad. However, the press censorship that began during the First World War was continued by the Dublin Castle administration after the war. The Press Censor forbade all Irish newspapers from publishing the Dáil&#x27;s declarations.

That evening, a unionist view of events was printed in a local newspaper. It claimed that the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, &quot;Lord French, is today the master of Ireland. He alone... will decide upon the type of government the country is to have, and it is he rather than any member of the House of Commons, who will be the judge of political and industrial reforms&quot;. French&#x27;s observer at the meeting, George Moore, was impressed by its orderliness and told him that the Dáil represented &quot;the general feeling in the country&quot;. &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, then the voice of the Unionist status quo, called the events both farcical and dangerous.

Irish republicans, and many nationalist newspapers, saw the meeting as momentous and the beginning of &quot;a new epoch&quot;. According to one observer: &quot;It is difficult to convey the intensity of feeling which pervaded the Round Room, the feeling that great things were happening, even greater things impending, and that in looking around the room he saw a glimpse of the Ireland of the future&quot;.

One American journalist was more accurate than most when he forecast that &quot;The British government apparently intends to ignore the Sinn Fein republic until it undertakes to enforce laws that are in conflict with those established by the British; then the trouble is likely to begin&quot;.

==Irish War of Independence==

Members of the Irish Volunteers, a republican paramilitary organization, &quot;believed that the election of the Dáil and its declaration of independence had given them the right to pursue the republic in the manner they saw fit&quot;. It began to refer to itself as the Irish Republican Army (IRA). The First Dáil was &quot;a visible symbol of popular resistance and a source of legitimacy for fighting men in the guerrilla war that developed&quot;.

On the same day as the Dáil&#x27;s first meeting, two officers of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) were killed in an ambush in County Tipperary by members of the Irish Volunteers. The Volunteers seized the explosives the officers had been guarding. This action had not been authorised by the Irish Volunteer leadership nor by the Dáil. Although the Dáil and the Irish Volunteers had some overlapping membership, they were separate and neither controlled the other.

After the founding of the Dáil, steps were taken to make the Volunteers the army of the new self-declared republic. On 31 January 1919 the Volunteers&#x27; official journal, &quot;An tÓglách&quot; (&quot;The Volunteer&quot;), stated that Ireland and England were at war, and that the founding of Dáil Éireann and its declaration of independence justified the Irish Volunteers in treating &quot;the armed forces of the enemy – whether soldiers or policemen – exactly as a &quot;national army&quot; would treat the members of an invading army&quot;. In August 1920, the Dáil adopted a motion that the Irish Volunteers, &quot;as a standing army&quot;, would swear allegiance to it and to the Republic.

The Soloheadbeg ambush &quot;and others like it that occurred during 1919 were not […] intended to be the first shots in a general war of independence, though that is what they turned out to be&quot;. It is thus seen as one of the first actions of the Irish War of Independence. The Dáil did not debate whether it would &quot;accept a state of war&quot; with, or declare war on, the United Kingdom until 11 March 1921. It was agreed unanimously to give President de Valera the power to accept or declare war at the most opportune time, but he never did so.

In September 1919 the Dáil was declared illegal by the British authorities in Ireland and thereafter met only intermittently and at various locations. The Dáil also set about attempting to secure &quot;de facto&quot; authority for the Irish Republic throughout the country. This included the establishment of a parallel judicial system known as the Dáil Courts. The First Dáil held its last meeting on 10 May 1921. After elections on 24 May the Dáil was succeeded by the Second Dáil which sat for the first time on 16 August 1921.

==Legacy==
The First Dáil and the general election of 1918 came to occupy a central place in Irish republicanism and nationalism. Today the name &quot;Dáil Éireann&quot; is used for the lower house of the modern Oireachtas (parliament) of the Republic of Ireland. Successive &quot;Dála&quot; (plural for Dáil) continue to be numbered from the &quot;First Dáil&quot; convened in 1919. The current Dáil, elected in 2024, is accordingly the &quot;34th Dáil&quot;. The 1918 general election was the last time the whole island of Ireland voted as a unit until elections to the European Parliament over sixty years later. The landslide victory for Sinn Féin was seen by Irish republicans as an overwhelming endorsement of the principle of a united independent Ireland. Until recently republican paramilitary groups, such as the Provisional IRA, often claimed that their campaigns derived legitimacy from this 1918 mandate, and some still do.

The First Dáil &quot;created the beginnings of an independent Irish governmental and bureaucratic machine&quot;, and was a means by which &quot;a formal constitution for the new state was created&quot;. It also &quot;provided the personnel and the authority to conclude the articles of agreement with Britain and bring the war to an end&quot;. The Irish state has commemorated the founding of the First Dáil several times, as &quot;the anniversary of when a constitutionally elected majority of MPs declared the right of the Irish people to have their own democratic state&quot;.

Seán MacEntee, who died on 10 January 1984 at the age of 94, was the last surviving member of the First Dáil.

<doc id="158029" wikidata="Q720369" url="?curid=158029" title="Liquid Tension Experiment">
<text>Liquid Tension Experiment (LTE) is an American instrumental progressive metal supergroup founded by Mike Portnoy in 1997. The band initially released two albums, between 1998 and 1999. An extension of their second regular album, with the absence of John Petrucci was released in 2007 under the name &quot;Liquid Trio Experiment&quot;. 

Active up until 1999, when Jordan Rudess formally joined Dream Theater, the band reunited in 2008 for a series of live shows. A live album with the absence of Jordan Rudess (mostly) was released in 2009 under the name &quot;Liquid Trio Experiment 2&quot;, as were three live albums and two videos featuring the complete band. They regrouped once again in 2020 to record a third studio album featuring all band members, which was released on April 16, 2021.

==History==

===Formation, studio albums and tours===
Liquid Tension Experiment was formed by Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy after Magna Carta gave him the green light for &quot;whatever he wanted to do&quot;. Portnoy first invited keyboardist Jordan Rudess and progressive rock icon Tony Levin (bass, Chapman Stick) of King Crimson and Peter Gabriel&#x27;s band to join him. Portnoy also had bassist Billy Sheehan and keyboardist Jens Johansson on his shortlist.

In his second instructional video &quot;Liquid Drum Theater&quot;, Portnoy said that his first choice for the guitar was Dimebag Darrell, but he was unable to join because of conflicting schedules. Two other primary choices, Steve Morse (formerly of Dixie Dregs and Kansas, at that time of Deep Purple) and Jim Matheos (Fates Warning) were also unavailable. Portnoy then turned to fellow Dream Theater member John Petrucci to fill the position (despite initially wanting to keep the project completely separate from Dream Theater). The combo was formed as a side project to Dream Theater in 1997. Both Mike and John confirmed on the 5 Years in a Livetime DVD commentary, that Rudess was asked to join Dream Theater largely because of the success of Liquid Tension Experiment, and the chemistry of the three working together. Rudess had previously declined to join Dream Theater in 1994 and instead became a member of the Dixie Dregs, known for complex, &quot;Southern fusion&quot; instrumental music.

Liquid Tension Experiment released two albums, &quot;Liquid Tension Experiment&quot; (1998) and &quot;Liquid Tension Experiment 2&quot; (1999) on Magna Carta Records. They also played a few live shows in New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and London. Mike Portnoy had stated in numerous interviews (and on his web site FAQ) that there would not be a third LTE album, as three of the four band members were also part of Dream Theater and the material would be too similar. In 2007 however, he said that a third release is possible, but that his problems with the Magna Carta label are more of an obstacle than getting the band members together to record.

A situation that had to do with the company that released the Liquid Drum Theater VHS tape using video footage of Liquid Tension Experiment in the studio without getting the required permission of Magna Carta. Mike Portnoy came back to Magna Carta in 2007 to release Liquid Trio Experiment&#x27;s &quot;Spontaneous Combustion&quot; Sessions.

Several songs and riffs from the project have been incorporated into Dream Theater&#x27;s live performances, such as &quot;Instrumedley&quot; from &quot;Live at Budokan&quot;, which includes excerpts of the songs &quot;Paradigm Shift&quot; and &quot;Universal Mind.&quot;

On October 4, 2007, it was announced that LTE would headline NEARfest 2008 in June. On March 29, 2008, six Liquid Tension Experiment tour dates in June 2008 were announced to celebrate the bands 10 year anniversary as well to create a &quot;whole new musical experiment&quot;.

Liquid Tension Experiment released a multi-disc boxed set of tour highlights from their 2008 tour, including complete shows from New York and Los Angeles on DVD and CD (the L.A. show also on Blu-ray), the Liquid Trio Experiment 2 recording from Chicago (q.v. below), and a disc of improvisations from other shows on the tour. The New York and Los Angeles shows were also released separately on CD or DVD, all through Dream Theater&#x27;s official bootlegs website, YtseJam Records&#x27; subsidiary, Lazy Tomato Entertainment.

===Liquid Trio Experiment===
During the recording sessions for their second album, John Petrucci had to leave when his wife went into premature labor. During that period, the remaining members, who still had studio time booked, continued to write music in improvisation. On October 23, 2007, a compilation of jams from those sessions was released under the name of &quot;Liquid Trio Experiment&quot;. The album, called &quot;Spontaneous Combustion&quot;, was recorded from Mike Portnoy&#x27;s DATs of the sessions because the original master tapes disappeared before the mixing stage. A few songs from Liquid Tension Experiment 2 were spawned from these jam sessions, including &quot;914&quot;, &quot;Chewbacca&quot;, and &quot;Liquid Dreams&quot;.

===Liquid Trio Experiment 2===
The second incarnation of Liquid Trio Experiment happened unexpectedly while playing a concert in Chicago, IL on June 25, 2008. In the beginning of their set, Jordan Rudess&#x27; keyboard started playing two adjacent notes on every press of a key. At the end of playing &quot;Universal Mind&quot;, he went off stage to talk to the tech crew to see if it could be fixed. In the meantime, the other three musicians on stage continued to play, improvising for what turned out to be the rest of the concert. Rudess was on the phone with Roland for most of the time, and finally realized the keyboard was unfixable in that time, so he came onstage and took Petrucci&#x27;s guitar to jam with the band. Petrucci took Levin&#x27;s bass, and Levin joined in on Chapman Stick. Toward the end of the show, Charlie Benante from the band Anthrax came and played drums while Portnoy played bass. This entire improvised concert was released in 2009 as &quot;When the Keyboard Breaks: Live in Chicago&quot;.

===Interim period===
On July 19, 2012, at Dream Theater&#x27;s second show on Huntington NY, Tony Levin joined Petrucci, Rudess and Mike Mangini (Dream Theater&#x27;s drummer at the time) onstage to perform &quot;Paradigm Shift.&quot;

Later in 2012, Portnoy performed &quot;Acid Rain&quot; live with PSMS, his band with Derek Sherinian, Tony MacAlpine and Billy Sheehan. They recorded a live DVD in Tokyo including the song.

On February 10, 2017, Mike Portnoy and Tony Levin reunited on stage in Tampa, FL to perform Paradigm Shift, Acid Rain and Universal Mind. They were accompanied by members of progressive metal group Haken.

In April 2019, both John Petrucci and Jordan Rudess announced that a new Liquid Tension Experiment reunion is possible, once all involved musicians find time for that.

In May 2020, Jordan Rudess posted a video to the website Cameo stating, in response to a fan&#x27;s question, that the prospect of Liquid Tension Experiment reuniting &quot;looks very good&quot;, with the only barrier being the band members&#x27; schedules.

===Reunion and &quot;Liquid Tension Experiment 3&quot;===
On December 14, 2020, Levin, Portnoy, Rudess and Petrucci released a series of posts on social media (pictures of themselves wearing surgical masks spelling out &quot;LTE 3&quot;) teasing a third Liquid Tension Experiment album; a picture of the four of them together with the same masks was posted the following day. On December 17, 2020, it was formally announced that &quot;Liquid Tension Experiment 3&quot; would be released by Inside Out Music on March 26, 2021. The album was ultimately released April 16, 2021; the delay was due to printing errors by the manufacturer.

A video for the song &quot;The Passage of Time&quot; was released on January 22, 2021. This was followed up by a video for the song &quot;Beating the Odds&quot; on February 26, 2021, and then by a video for the song &quot;Hypersonic&quot; on March 24, 2021.

In an interview for &quot;Revolver&quot; magazine, Portnoy revealed the group had signed a two-album deal with InsideOut, and humorously added that a fourth Liquid Tension Experiment album would probably not take another 20 years.

<text>The River Derwent, also known as timtumili minanya in palawa kani, is a significant river and tidal estuary in Tasmania, Australia. It begins its journey as a freshwater river in the Central Highlands at Lake St Clair, descending over across a distance of more than . At the settlement of New Norfolk in the Derwent Valley its waters become brackish, flowing through Hobart, the capital city of Tasmania, its seawater estuary eventually empties into Storm Bay and the Tasman Sea.

Historically, the banks of the Derwent were covered by forests and frequented by Aboriginal Tasmanians. With the arrival of European settlers, the area saw agricultural development and the construction of dams for hydro-electricity generation during the 20th century.

Today, the Derwent&#x27;s catchment area is characterised by agriculture, forestry, and hydropower generation. It serves as a vital source of water for irrigation and urban supply, notably providing a significant portion of Hobart&#x27;s water needs. The river is also crucial for recreation, supporting activities such as boating, fishing, and leisure along its banks. Additionally, it facilitates marine transportation and various industrial activities, playing a central role in Tasmania&#x27;s economy and lifestyle.

==Etymology==
The upper part of the river was named after the River Derwent, Cumbria by British Commodore John Hayes who explored it in 1793. The name is Brythonic Celtic for &quot;valley thick with oaks&quot;.

Matthew Flinders placed the name &quot;Derwent River&quot; on all of the river.

The name &quot;River Derwent&quot; was officially endorsed on 20 May 1959.

==History==
The River Derwent valley was inhabited by the Mouheneener people for at least 8,000 years before British settlement. Evidence of their occupation is found in many middens along the banks of the river. The first European to chart the river was Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux, who named it the &quot;Rivière du Nord&quot; in 1793. Later that same year, John Hayes explored the river and named it after the River Derwent, which runs past his birthplace of Bridekirk, Cumberland.

When first explored by Europeans, the lower parts of the valley were clad in thick she-oak forests, remnants of which remain in various parts of the lower foreshore.

There was a thriving whaling industry until the 1840s when the industry rapidly declined due to over-exploitation.
==Geography==
Formed by the confluence of the Narcissus and Cuvier rivers within Lake St Clair, the Derwent flows generally southeast over a distance of to New Norfolk and the estuary portion extends a further out to the Tasman Sea. Flows average in range from and the mean annual flow is .

The large estuary forms the Port of the City of Hobart – the deepest sheltered harbour in the Southern Hemisphere. Some past guests of the port include in February 1836, carrying Charles Darwin; the ; and . The largest vessel to ever travel the Derwent is the , high, ocean liner &quot;Diamond Princess&quot;, which made her first visit in January 2006.

At points in its lower reaches the river is nearly wide, and as such is the widest river in Tasmania.

The Derwent estuary contains dozens of white sandy beaches, many of which are staples of local activity within Hobart suburbs and include Bellerive Beach, Blackmans Bay Beach, Howrah Beach, Nutgrove Beach, Lords Beach, Long Beach, Taroona Beach, Hinsby Beach, Kingston Beach and Windermere Beach.

===Hydro schemes===

Until the construction of several hydro-electric dams between 1934 and 1968, the river was prone to flooding. Now there are more than twenty dams and reservoirs used for the generation of hydro-electricity on the Derwent and its tributaries, including the Clyde, Dee, Jordan, Nive, Ouse, Plenty and Styx rivers. Seven lakes have been formed by damming the Derwent and the Nive rivers for hydroelectric purposes and include the Meadowbank, Cluny, Repulse, Catagunya, Wayatinah, Liapootah and King William lakes or lagoons.

===River health===
The Upper Derwent is affected by agricultural run-off, particularly from land clearing and forestry. The Lower Derwent suffers from high levels of toxic heavy metal contamination in sediments. The Tasmanian Government-backed &quot;Derwent Estuary Program&quot; has commented that the levels of mercury, lead, zinc and cadmium in the river exceed national guidelines. In 2015 the program recommended against consuming shellfish and cautioned against consuming fish in general. Nutrient levels in the Derwent between 2010 and 2015 increased in the upper estuary (between Bridgewater and New Norfolk) where there had been algal blooms.

====Industrial pollution====

A large proportion of toxic heavy metal contamination stems from legacy pollution caused by major industries that discharge into the river including Nyrstar Hobart, a historic smelter establish at Lutana in 1916, and the Norske Skog Boyer paper mill at Boyer which opened in 1941.

The Derwent adjoins or flows through the Pittwater–Orielton Lagoon, Interlaken Lakeside Reserve and Goulds Lagoon, all wetlands of significance protected under the Ramsar Convention.

==Flora and fauna==
In recent years, southern right whales finally started making appearance in the river during months in winter and spring when their migration takes place. Some females even started using calm waters of the river as a safe ground for giving birth to their calves and would stay over following weeks after disappearance of almost 200 years due to being wiped out by intense whaling activities. In the winter months of 2014, humpback whales and a minke whale (being the first confirmed record of this species in the river) have been recorded feeding in the River Derwent for the first time since the whaling days of the 1800s.

The rare spotted handfish (&quot;Brachionichthys hirsutus&quot;), whose only habitat is in the Derwent estuary and surrounds, was the first marine fish to be listed as critically endangered in the IUCN Red List, in 1996. The fish is threatened by the Northern Pacific seastar&#x27;s invasion into southern Australian waters. The Northern Pacific seastar (&quot;Asterias amurensis&quot;), now firmly established in the Derwent, preys on not only the fish eggs, but also on the sea squirts (ascidians) that help to form the substrate that the fish spawn on.

==Bridges==
Several bridges connect the western shore (the more heavily populated side of the river) to the eastern shore of Hobart – in the greater Hobart area, these include the five lane Tasman Bridge, near the CBD, just north of the port; the four lane Bowen Bridge; and the two lane Bridgewater Bridge and Causeway. Until 1964 the Derwent was crossed by the unique Hobart Bridge, a floating concrete structure just upstream from where the Tasman Bridge now stands.

Travelling further north from the Bridgewater crossing, the next crossing point is the Blair Street Bridge at New Norfolk, slightly north of the point where the Derwent reverts from seawater to fresh water, Bushy Park, Upper Meadowbank Lake, Lake Repulse Road, Wayatinah, and the most northerly crossing is at Derwent Bridge, before the river reaches its source of Lake St Clair. At the Derwent Bridge crossing, the flow of the river is generally narrow enough to be stepped across.

==Cultural references==
The river is the subject of the multimedia performance &quot;Falling Mountain&quot; (2005 Mountain Festival), a reference to the mountain in the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park from which the river rises.

The Derwent is mentioned in the song, &quot;Mt Wellington Reverie&quot; by Australian band, Augie March. Hobart is located in the foothills of Mount Wellington.

<doc id="158033" wikidata="Q939664" url="?curid=158033" title="River Derwent, Derbyshire">
<text>The Derwent is a river in Derbyshire, England. It is long and is a tributary of the River Trent, which it joins south of Derby. Throughout its course, the river mostly flows through the Peak District and its foothills.

Much of the river&#x27;s route, with the exception of the city of Derby, is rural. However, the river has also seen many human uses, and between Matlock and Derby was one of the cradles of the Industrial Revolution. It is the site of the Derwent Valley Mills, the first industrial-scale cotton mills. Today it provides a water supply to several surrounding cities, and its steep-sided valley is an important communications corridor through the uplands of the Peak District.

The scenery of the Derwent valley attracts many tourists. The upper reaches pass through the Peak District National Park, whilst the middle reaches around the old spa town of Matlock Bath offer souvenir shops and amusement arcades, together with attractions such as the Heights of Abraham and its cable car.

==Etymology==
Derwent is derived from Brittonic river name , Latinised as , meaning &quot;(belonging/pertaining to the) forest of oak trees&quot;; the old river name survived in medieval Welsh poetry, such as (&quot;Dinogad&#x27;s Smock&quot;) attached to the larger poem , as .

==Course==
The River Derwent rises at Swains Greave ( above sea level) on the eastern flank of Bleaklow, opposite Howden Moors, and some east of Glossop. It flows through the Upper Derwent Valley, and for most of its first forms the county boundary between Derbyshire, on its west bank, and South Yorkshire, on the east bank. Some into its journey it passes through three consecutive reservoirs: Howden, the highest, Derwent and Ladybower Reservoir. Derwent Reservoir is named after the now-submerged village of Derwent, which was named after the river. Once past Howden Reservoir, both banks of the river are in Derbyshire, and the river remains in the county to its mouth. Howden Reservoir is also fed by the River Westend, whilst Ladybower Reservoir is also fed by the River Ashop. The former confluences of the two tributaries with the Derwent are now submerged below the respective reservoirs.

Further south, the Derwent passes the village of Bamford, where it is joined by the River Noe. Below this confluence, it flows through Hathersage, Grindleford, Calver and Baslow, and through the estate of Chatsworth House, before it is joined by the River Wye at Rowsley. After passing through Darley Dale, the Derwent reaches Matlock, where, at an oxbow, it collects the Bentley Brook. It then flows past the villages of Matlock Bath, Cromford, Whatstandwell, and Ambergate, where it is joined by the River Amber.

Below Ambergate, the river flows through the town of Belper and the villages of Milford and Duffield, where it is joined by the River Ecclesbourne. It then enters the city of Derby near Darley Abbey and flows through the centre of the city. The river ends at Derwent Mouth, between Shardlow and Sawley, where it joins the River Trent at a height of above sea level; a total drop of . Its course meanders somewhat, especially in its lower reaches, adding to its apparent length of . Its waters ultimately reach the North Sea via the Humber Estuary.

==Natural history==
The River Derwent is the habitat for many different animals such as otters, birds, insects, fish and crayfish. It is also a habitat for many wild flowers, as exemplified by the Lower Derwent Trail.

==River uses==

The lower river from Derwent Mouth upstream as far as Derby was made navigable under an act of Parliament of 1720, the (6 Geo. 1. c. 27), and this stretch opened to navigation in 1721. Traffic ceased about 1795 and the navigation was acquired by the owners of the competing Derby Canal. The river is no longer considered navigable, although the upper river is widely used by kayakers and canoeists who enjoy the fast-flowing water and the slalom course at Matlock Bath.

The river was also used to power the many textile mills that were built along the Derwent between Matlock Bath and Derby. Initially, the need for water power was quite modest, for example Lombe&#x27;s Silk Mill in Derby, which is considered to be the forerunner of the later cotton mills, only needed to use the power provided by a small mill stream, and Richard Arkwright&#x27;s Cromford Mill, the world&#x27;s first water-powered cotton spinning mill, only used a small tributary of the Derwent in conjunction with a lead mine sough. The later mills at Belper, Darley Abbey and Masson Mill were much larger and needed to harness the full power of the river to drive their complex machinery. This required the construction of large weirs across the Derwent that still remain as significant features in the riverscape.

These sites were all important in the development of the Industrial Revolution, and Arkwright&#x27;s innovation, along with several local competitors, is recognised today by the designation of the area as the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site.

The power of the Derwent is still harnessed at a number of these historic mill sites, producing hydro-electricity from turbines instead of driving mill wheels, with a recent development being the construction of a hydro-electric station at Longbridge weir, adjacent to the Riverside Gardens in Derby.

Howden and Derwent Reservoirs in the upper valley were both completed in 1916 to supply the cities of Sheffield, Nottingham, Derby, and Leicester. The adjacent Ladybower Reservoir was completed in 1945 to cover increasing demand. Treated water from these reservoirs flows down the Derwent Valley Aqueduct parallel to the river. The river also indirectly supplies Carsington Reservoir, with the water taken from the river by a pumping station at Ambergate in times of high flow. When flows are low, water is released back into the river via the same route of tunnels and aqueducts, thus allowing greater abstraction rates downstream at Little Eaton in the drier summer months. Today all these reservoirs are managed by Severn Trent Water.

The valley of the Derwent provides an important communications route. Between Derby and Rowsley the valley is followed by the A6 road, which was the main road from London to Manchester until the creation of the motorway network, and is still a busy single-carriageway road. The former Midland Railway&#x27;s lines from Derby to Sheffield and Manchester also followed the Derwent, the former as far as Ambergate and the latter as far as Rowsley. The Sheffield line still operates as part of the Midland Main Line, but the Manchester line was severed north of Matlock in 1968, and the section from Ambergate to Matlock now forms the Derwent Valley Line, a single-track branch line. Between Ambergate and Cromford, the river, road and railway are also paralleled by the Cromford Canal. The terminus was once connected to Manchester across the High Peak by the early Cromford and High Peak Railway.

==Tributaries==
Alphabetical listing of tributaries, extracted from the Water Framework Directive list of water bodies for the Derbyshire Derwent:

*River Amber
*River Ashop
*Bar Brook, which joins the Derwent near Baslow
*Black Brook, near Belper
*Bottle Brook, at Little Eaton
*Bentley Brook
*Chaddesden Brook, in Derby
*River Ecclesbourne
*Highlow Brook, near Hathersage
*Hood Brook, also near Hathersage
*Lea Brook, near High Peak Junction
*Ladybower Brook (Highshore Clough Catchment), flows into Ladybower Reservoir
*Markeaton Brook, joins the Derwent in Derby
*River Noe
*River Westend

==Naming==
The River Derwent provides the name for the oldest hockey club in Derbyshire. Derwent Hockey Club was established in 1897 and played its matches on the banks of the Derwent in Darley Dale, before relocating to Wirksworth.
It also gives its name to Derwent Rowing Club in Derby, founded in 1857.

== Curiosities ==
The pureness of the river has also been commented on by Charles Cotton – &quot;Piscator&quot; in Izaac Walton&#x27;s &quot;Compleat Angler&quot;.

<text>The River Derwent is a river which flows between the historic county boundaries of Durham and Northumberland in the north east of England. It broadens into the Derwent Reservoir, west of Consett. The Derwent is a tributary of the River Tyne, which it joins at Derwenthaugh near Gateshead.

The river flows for 35 miles from its origin, where two streams, Beldon Burn and Nookton Burn meet approximately a mile west of Blanchland, to Derwenthaugh where it flows into the River Tyne (the confluence is between Blaydon and the MetroCentre complex). On its journey, the River Derwent flows through places such as Allensford, Shotley Bridge, Blackhall Mill and Rowlands Gill. The Derwent Walk Country Park at Rowlands Gill is named after the river.

The name Derwent comes from the Brythonic/Early Welsh word for oak &quot;derw&quot; and valley &quot;-went&quot;.

The Muggleswick-born writer, John Carr, wrote a 40 verse poem &quot;Ode to the River Derwent&quot;.

River Derwent flows next to the Gibside estate.

<text>The Derwent is a famous river in the county of Cumbria in the north of England; it rises in the Lake District and flows northwards through two of its principal lakes, before turning sharply westward to enter the Irish Sea at Workington

The name &quot;Derwent&quot; is shared with three other English rivers and is thought to be derived from a Celtic word for &quot;oak trees&quot; (an alternative is &quot;dour&quot; &quot;water&quot; and &quot;(g)-went&quot; &quot;white / pure&quot;. The river&#x27;s Old Welsh name was &quot;Derwennydd&quot; and it is believed to be to be the setting of the medieval Welsh lullaby Dinogad&#x27;s Smock.

The river rises at Sprinkling Tarn underneath Great End and flows in a northerly direction through the valley of Borrowdale, before entering Derwentwater, which it exits to the north just outside Keswick and is joined by the waters of the River Greta. The Derwent then enters Bassenthwaite Lake at its southern end; it exits it at its northern end, thereafter flowing generally westward to Cockermouth, where the River Cocker joins it from the south. William Wordsworth&#x27;s childhood home in Cockermouth backed onto the Derwent, and he briefly mentions it in The Prelude: ... the bright blue river passedalong the terrace of our childhood walk;
A tempting playmate whom we dearly loved) From Cockermouth, the river continues westward past Papcastle, site of the Roman fort of Derventio, is joined by the River Marron near Bridgefoot and continues and onwards to Workington, where it flows into the Irish Sea.

The River Derwent was officially named by Sir Braelyn Smith in 1634 after he laid claim to the baronies of Allerdale.

<text>Derwentwater, or Derwent Water, is a lake in the Lake District in North West England, immediately south of Keswick. It is in the unitary authority of Cumberland within the ceremonial county of Cumbria. It is the third largest lake by area, after Windermere and Ullswater. It has a length of , a maximum width of , and an area of . Its primary inflow and outflow is the River Derwent, which also flows through Bassenthwaite Lake before reaching the Irish Sea at Workington. There are several islands within the lake, one of which is inhabited.
Derwentwater is a place of considerable scenic value. It is surrounded by hills (known locally as fells), and many of the slopes facing Derwentwater are extensively wooded. A regular passenger launch operates on the lake, taking passengers between various landing stages. There are seven lakeside marinas, the most popular stops being Keswick, Portinscale and the Lodore Falls, from which boats may be hired. Recreational walking is a major tourist activity in the area and there is an extensive network of footpaths in the hills and woods surrounding the lake.

The Keswick to Borrowdale road runs along the eastern shore of the lake and carries a regular bus service. There is a lesser, or unclassified, road along the western shore connecting the villages of Grange and Portinscale.

Derwentwater gave its name to the Earldom of Derwentwater.

From 2008 to 2014, the lake was believed to be the last remaining native habitat of the vendace (&quot;Coregonus vandesius&quot;) fish from the four originally known sites: Bassenthwaite Lake and Derwentwater in the Lake District, and the Castle Loch &amp; Mill Loch in Lochmaben. However, a breeding population was discovered at Bassenthwaite Lake by conservationists in September 2014. The lake (and many others) is polluted with the invasive New Zealand Pigmyweed.

==Etymology==

&#x27;Derwent&#x27; is &quot; &#x27;(River) with oak trees&#x27;, traditionally explained from Brit.&quot; (i.e.: Brythonic Celtic) or Old Welsh, &quot; &#x27;derwā&#x27; &#x27;oak&#x27; plus suffixes, hence of the same origin as other English rivers named Derwent, Darwen, Darent and Dart...The river gave its name to Derwent Water (which was also known as the &#x27;Lake of Derwent&#x27;, &#x27;Keswick Lake&#x27;, or &#x27;Keswick Water&#x27; in the 18th-19th centuries)...&quot;.
Plus &quot;OE &#x27;wæter&#x27;, with the meaning probably influenced by its ON relative &#x27;vatn&#x27;.&quot;

==Derwentwater&#x27;s islands==
There are numerous islands in Derwentwater, the largest being Derwent Island, Lord&#x27;s Island, St Herbert&#x27;s Island, Rampsholme Island, Park Neb, Otter Island and Otterbield Island. There is a house on Derwent Island.

St. Herbert&#x27;s Island is named after a 7th-century hermit priest; Herbert of Derwentwater.

==In art and literature==
Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poetical illustration is attached to a plate of &quot;Derwent Water, from the Castle Head, Cumberland&quot; (artist Thomas Allom) in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1837.

==In popular culture==
A slightly cropped and colour hue-edited real photo with an open view of the Derwentwater was used by Team Silent as a backdrop image at the very beginning of the Konami&#x27;s &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; video game, to serve as a higher ground touristic observational viewpoint of the fictional &quot;Toluca Lake&quot; (not to be confused with Toluca Lake, Los Angeles) in the local area encompassing the fictional eponymous town of &quot;Silent Hill&quot;, Maine. Derwentwater was used in the 2018 video game Forza Horizon 4. The album artwork for the 2010 album Black Sands by Bonobo features a photograph taken of Derwentwater. The tower in the background is located in Castlerigg (54°35′29.95″N 3°7′3.43″WCoordinates: 54°35′29.95″N 3°7′3.43″W). On his album &quot;Republic of Geordieland&quot;, singer-songwriter Richard Dawson has a song titled &quot;Derwentwater Farewell.&quot; Derwentwater was used as the principal location for the planet Takodana in the sci fi movie sequel &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;.

<doc id="158038" wikidata="Q546983" url="?curid=158038" title="River Derwent, Yorkshire">
<text>The Derwent is a river in Yorkshire in the north of England. 
It flows from Fylingdales Moor in the North York Moors National Park, east then southwards as far as its confluence with the River Hertford then westwards through the Vale of Pickering, south through Kirkham Gorge and the Vale of York, joining the River Ouse at Barmby on the Marsh. The confluence is unusual in that the Derwent converges on the Ouse at a shallow angle in an upstream direction.

The river used to flow further east, its old course entering the Ouse east of Howden.

The River Derwent catchment area includes the Upper Derwent, River Rye, River Hertford, Bielby Beck and Pocklington Canal and their tributaries. It covers an area of 2,057 square kilometres and includes the towns of Stamford Bridge, Malton, Pickering, Helmsley, Filey and Scarborough. The area is bounded by the Cleveland Hills, North York Moors and Hambleton Hills to the north, the Yorkshire Wolds and the coast to the east, the Vale of York to the west and the River Ouse and Humber Estuary to the south. The area around the river is primarily rural in nature with grazing moorland in the upland areas and a variety of agricultural uses at lower levels. There are large areas of designated conservation sites throughout the area. There are two titles named after the River Derwent in the British peerage, Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent which is extinct and Baron Derwent.

==Uses==
The river is used for water abstraction, leisure and sporting activities and effluent disposal, and also has several important nature reserves. It is the subject of conflicting interests. It has an interesting ice age past and a long recorded history.

Water abstracted from the Derwent supplies towns and cities such as Hull, Leeds, York and Scarborough. The river water is of generally good quality with BOD levels remaining below 2 mg/L all year round. It is typical of northern British rivers in that it exhibits acid flushes at peak times of rainfall (during the winter months).

There are also several effluent sites scattered along this river at Malton, Stamford Bridge, Elvington, Wheldrake and Bubwith.

As of 2023 the River Derwent is only navigable by small powered craft between East Cottingwith Lock and Barmby Barrage. Upstream of East Cottingwith/Thorganby are the remains of the stanchions of an old bridge which are a choke point for drifting fallen trees, which prevent access. Additionally the locks at Elvington/Sutton on Derwent are silted and not accessible to river users.

==Geology==

At its source on the North York Moors the River Derwent and its tributaries run over Corallian Limestone from the Jurassic period. Downstream of Stamford Bridge the catchment area is mainly of Sherwood Sandstone from the Triassic period. To the east this sandstone dips under Mercia Mudstone, also of the Triassic period.
Some of the underlying rocks are major aquifers and provide a valuable source for water supply in the area. The major aquifers are the Corallian limestone, chalk and Sherwood sandstone. The Corallian Limestone outcrops on the hills surrounding the Vale of Pickering and is made up of a series of limestones and sandstones. This aquifer is unconfined in parts and gets water from the River Rye and River Derwent through swallow holes.

Before the last ice age the waters of the upper Derwent flowed east and discharged into the sea at Scalby, near Scarborough. The River Hertford, the present middle Derwent and the River Rye flowed east and discharged into the North Sea near Filey Brigg. During the Ice Age these outlets were blocked by a tongue of ice which extended down the North Sea basin carrying with it large amounts of glacial detritus. As the ice melted the detritus was deposited to form the Wykeham moraine and permanently blocked the eastern exits of the watercourse. Water from the melting ice and the North York Moors formed a lake in the Vale of Pickering which expanded and deepened until eventually the water escaped by overflowing at the lowest point at Kirkham. The water cut a gorge through the Howardian Hills as it drained away southwards, breaching the Escrick moraine just east of Wheldrake, and joining the Humber glacial lake.

==Climate==
Rainfall and climate conditions vary slightly across the Derwent catchment area due to the topography.
Annual rainfall ranges from averages of at Barmby Barrage to over at its source on the North York Moors.

==Course and character of the Derwent catchment area==
For management purposes the catchment area has been divided into ten smaller units. Two of these units (Howe Bridge and Ness) relate to the River Rye which is the subject of a separate article. The other eight, starting at the source, are:
*East and West Ayton
The Derwent starts its course at Lilla Rig on the North York Moors a few miles from the east coast of Yorkshire. After collecting the waters of the Jugger Howe Beck, Black Beck and Troutdale Beck it flows south through the Forge Valley to East and West Ayton. From there it continues across lower ground to where it is joined by the River Hertford. The Sea Cut, a man made channel, connects the Derwent to the North Sea near Scarborough to alleviate flooding in the lower reaches of the Derwent, downstream of the Cut. This management area is about 127 km2 and largely rural with no major settlements. Corallian limestone lies beneath this area. The landscape is upland moors in the upper reaches with lower lying flatter land near Hackness. The river flows through the narrow Forge Valley and several designated natural conservation sites. Water is retained behind a weir at West Ayton and there are sink holes in the river bed where river water is lost to underlying aquifers, so that in drought years the river below the weir may run dry. There are no wastewater treatment works. The ecology and fisheries have a very high sensitivity to changes in water flow.
*River Hertford
The River Hertford starts close to Hunmanby near the seaside town of Filey and flows westwards into the Derwent. The management area is about 83 km2 with a largely rural economy of arable farming and managed grassland in a flat to undulating landscape. The underlying rock is Corallian Limestone but overlying deposits insulate the river water from this aquifer. Close to the river the land is less than 30 m high whilst to the south of the area on the slopes of the Yorkshire Wolds it reaches 100 m. The river flows in a narrow heavily modified channel. Water is discharged from water treatment works at Seamer, Folkton and Hunmanby.

*Low Marishes
Having been joined by the River Hertford, the Derwent turns sharply west and flows along the Vale of Pickering past Yedingham village. It is joined by the River Rye four miles upstream from Malton and then flows southwards. It covers an area of about 273 km2 (105 sq miles) and overlies the Corallian Limestone aquifer. The topography and land use are varied. The flat valley floor is less than 20 metres in height, and here the dominant land use is arable farming. In the northern part of this area lies the North York Moors National Park, where the land is used mainly for upland grazing and forestry. To the south are the Yorkshire Wolds and here the land rises to over 180 metres in height.
There are waste-water treatment works at Thornton le Dale, East Heslerton and Sherburn.

*Kirkham Bridge
After leaving Malton the river flows south through the steep-sided valley of Kirkham Gorge past Howsham Mill and weir to Buttercrambe.
*Buttercrambe
At Buttercrambe the river continues southwards and through Stamford Bridge.
The above two areas have similar physical and ecological characteristics. They have a combined catchment area of 256 km2 (99 sq miles). Part of the Kirkham Bridge area is underlain by Corallian limestone. The areas are predominantly rural with undulating scenery. The Howardian Hills lie to the north of Buttercrambe and the Yorkshire Wolds to the east of Kirkham Bridge. There are many scattered villages in the agricultural landscape. The land near the river is less than 20 metres high.
The River Derwent Special Area of Conservation runs through the length of both areas. There are waste-water treatment works at Foston, Leavening, Harton, Whenby, Welburn and Settrington.

*Sutton upon Derwent

The river continues southwards, cutting through the slightly higher surrounds of the Escrick moraine and into the Vale of York and past Wheldrake. This area covers 79 km2 (31 sq miles). It is low undulating agricultural land; the largest settlement is Stamford Bridge. The River Derwent in this area has many designated riverine conservation sites. There is a substantial public water supply abstraction point in the area which supplies 4.5 million people. There are significant waste-water treatment sites at Elvington, Stamford Bridge and Bugthorpe.

*East Cottingwith

At East Cottingwith the Derwent meanders across its flood plain still going south, and collects the waters of the Bielby Beck and the Pocklington Canal which form the major part of the catchment.
This area is 199 km2 (77 sq miles). It is largely rural, having several scattered villages amongst open fields and common land in the Vale of York. Pocklington is the largest settlement. The area lies also on the undulating foothills of the Yorkshire Wolds. Pocklington Canal is long and joins the Derwent at East Cottingwith. In the southern part of the area the land is flat and low. On either side of the watercourse the land is rich and it is farmed as arable or permanent grassland. There are also hay meadows and pastures, known locally as Ings, which form part of the Lower Derwent Valley designated conservation sites. There are waste-water treatment sites at Pocklington, Bishop Wilton, Wilberfoss and Melbourne.

*Barmby Barrage
At Barmby Barrage the waters of the Derwent are separated from the tidal Ouse to prevent the tides polluting the water extraction plant at Loftsome Bridge. This area consists of the River Derwent from Sutton upon Derwent lock downstream to the confluence with the River Ouse at Barmby Barrage. It covers 116 km2 (45 sq miles) and it overlies the Sherwood Sandstone major aquifer. It is largely rural, with a few small villages in an agricultural landscape of pastures, meadows and arable fields. There are several designated conservation sites. There are waste-water treatment works at Wheldrake, Bubwith, Ellerton and North Duffield.
==Barmby Barrage==
Water from the tidal River Ouse is prevented from entering the Derwent by means of a barrage at Barmby on the Marsh. The Derwent has been kept non-tidal since the 1970s because water is abstracted at Loftsome Bridge water treatment works to supply the City of Hull.
The barrage has a navigation lock and two sluice gates. The objectives of the barrage are:
# to exclude the waters of the Ouse from the Derwent
# to maintain a depth of water for navigation and abstraction
# to keep the river level low enough to permit drainage from the surrounding land.
The barrage has two sluice gates, each is 7 metres wide and 5 metres high. They are raised and lowered by ropes from winches mounted in a machine room in the centre of the barrage. To travel the 5 metres from the fully closed to the open position of the gates takes 10 minutes. There is a PLC system to control the opening and closing of the gates which incorporates river level sensors, gate position sensors and a motor control centre.
On a rising tide in the River Ouse the gates are closed and they are only allowed to open again once the level of the Ouse has fallen below that of the Derwent. An electronic communications link provides data remotely to the UK Environment Agency.

==Natural history==
The main river, its tributaries and adjacent wetlands are significant for nature conservation, ecology and landscape. The area contains a wide diversity of habitats and a number of designated sites.
*Special Protection Areas provide protection to birds, their nests, eggs and habitats. (SPAs)
*Special Areas of Conservation contribute to biodiversity by maintaining and restoring habitats and species other than birds. (SACs)
*Ramsar Sites are wetlands of international importance designated under the Ramsar Convention
*Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs)

==History==
The unusual upstream-facing outfall of the Derwent is man-made. It is believed to have been cut during the Roman occupation of Britain to reduce the distance between the Derwent mouth and the Roman legionary headquarters at York by 9 miles. The first navigation weir, also believed to be of Roman origin, was a flash weir built near Wheldrake to raise the level of the river upstream and regulate its flow downstream.

It has been suggested that the name &quot;Derwent&quot; is related to that of Deira, one of the post-Roman kingdoms that later became Northumbria. a derivation also found in the Latin name for Malton, .

During the reign of King John (1199–1216) a water mill on the Derwent at Wheldrake was given to the monks of Fountains Abbey, and later in the 13th century a weir is known to have existed at the same place.
By 1462 when the Lord Mayor of York was authorised to &quot;correct and amend defects&quot; of the Derwent &quot;from the Ouse as far as the town and bridge of Sutton upon Derwent&quot; the river must have been navigable at least to Sutton. A corn mill existed at Sutton upon Derwent by 1597. It was rebuilt in 1836 and continued in use until 1960. There are other water mill sites at Stamford Bridge, Buttercrambe, Howsham, Kirkham and Malton.

Before the 18th century coal was usually taken by coastal shipping from Newcastle or Sunderland and put into smaller vessels at coastal ports to be delivered to upriver destinations. For this purpose there was an interest in improving navigation on the Derwent as far as Malton. In 1702 an Act of Parliament was passed authorising its proprietors to improve the river. Towpaths were laid out and &quot;locks, turnpikes, pens for water, wharfs and warehouses&quot; were constructed. The promoters of these works were allowed to charge tolls on the cargo carried on any part of the river.
The owners of land near the river complained in 1722 that the new locks and weirs caused them to lose income because their meadows were more often flooded. In 1793 thirty-five vessels were trading from Malton, carrying corn downstream to the West Riding towns and returning upstream with coal. Virtually every village and hamlet near the tidal river had its own landing place.

In 1845 the York and North Midland Railway was built to join the West Riding to Scarborough via Malton. Much of the freight traffic of the Derwent Navigation was transferred to the cheaper railway. In 1855 the railway managers bought the Navigation, and to further stifle competition they charged high tolls on barge freight. More cargo was moved to the railway, and by the 1890s the only regular trade on the Derwent was on its lower reaches.

By the beginning of the 20th century the river was being used for pleasure craft, and by 1920 there were craft based regularly at Stamford Bridge and Kirkham Abbey. After floods in 1930 damaged the lock gates at Kirkham, several vessels were stranded upstream. In 1935 the statutory Right of Navigation was revoked above Sutton Lock. There followed a long series of fights for public access against riparian interests which continue to the present day.

==Economy==
The economic profile of the River Derwent is dominated by its value as a water resource with the Derwent supplying Leeds, Hull, York and Scarborough as well as agricultural holdings along its course. The river is popular with anglers throughout its course, and Hull &amp; District Anglers Association, York &amp; District Amalgamation of Anglers, Leeds &amp; District Amalgamated Society of Anglers among many other smaller clubs and syndicates have stretches along the river. It also has many valuable conservation areas and Sites of Special Scientific Interest.

<doc id="158048" wikidata="Q719662" url="?curid=158048" title="Víctor Galíndez">
<text>Víctor Emilio Galíndez (2 November 1948 in Vedia – 25 October 1980 in Veinticinco de Mayo, Buenos Aires) was an Argentine boxer who was the third Latin American to win the world Light Heavyweight championship, after Puerto Rico&#x27;s José Torres and Venezuela&#x27;s Vicente Rondon.

Galíndez was born in Vedia in the Leandro N. Alem Partido of the Buenos Aires Province in Argentina in 1948. He aspired to become both a boxer and a stock car pilot since an early age, but he was more interested in boxing. As an amateur, he compiled a winning record and participated in the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, where he lost in a preliminary round bout to Aldo Bentini of Italy. A year earlier he claimed the silver medal at the 1967 Pan American Games.

Galíndez then turned professional, and on 10 May 1969, he debuted as a paid fighter with a win over Ramon Ruiz by a knockout in four at Buenos Aires. After one more win, he faced Adolfo Cejas in Azul, Argentina, in a fight which resulted in a ten-round draw.

In 1970, Galíndez had 10 fights, a span during which he went 5-3-1, with one no contest. He suffered his first loss, at the hands of Juan Aguilar, by a decision in ten, and had a second and third fight with Aguilar, of which the second ended in a first round no contest, and the second in another Aguilar decision win. He began his five fight rivalry with Jorge Ahumada knocking Ahumada out in five rounds, and lost the Argentine Light Heavyweight title with a twelve-round decision defeat against Avenamar Peralta.

He and Peralta had an immediate, non-title rematch in 1971, and Galíndez won by a ten-round decision. 1971 was a year of rematches for Galíndez, the only new boxer he met that year being Pedro Rimovsky, and he too, had a rematch with Galíndez before that year was over. He lost to Ahumada in the second of the five fights between them, by a decision in Mendoza, Argentina, then beat him in fight three by a knockout in nine, and in fight four by a knockout in six, both the third and fourth fight being held in Buenos Aires. He and Rimovsky had a first round no contest in their first bout, and drew over the ten round distance in the rematch, and then Galíndez had two more fights with Peralta, losing by a knockout in nine and a decision in 10.

In 1973, Galíndez had eight fights, winning seven and drawing one. He was finally able to obtain Argentina&#x27;s Light Heavyweight title, by beating Aguilar by a decision in twelve. He beat Aguilar once again, by a knockout in six, and he also beat Eddie Owens, Eddie Duncan and Raul Loyola, the latter being beaten twice, one time defending his Argentine title.

He began 1974 with a step up in class, meeting former world title challenger Ray Anderson, beating him by a knockout in two. After six more consecutive wins, he was given his first shot at a world title, facing Len Hutchins for the WBA&#x27;s vacant world Light Heavyweight championship. Galíndez then joined Torres and Rondon as the only Hispanic Light Heavyweight world champions in history, and Carlos Monzón as the only Argentine world champions of that era, with a TKO of Hutchins in the thirteenth round to become the WBA&#x27;s world Light Heavyweight champion.

Galíndez, who never fought outside Argentina before becoming a world champion, became a traveling fighter after that. After he beat Johnny Griffin in Buenos Aires by knockout in six in a non-title bout, it was off to South Africa, for his first international fight, which was, at the same time, his first world title defense. He beat Pierre Fourie there by a decision. Next was Las Vegas, for his first fight in the United States, another non title affair. He knocked out Ray Elson in eight there. Next stop was the Madison Square Garden in New York, where he and arch-rival Ahumada met for a fifth time, this time with the world title on the line. After beating Ahumada by a decision in 15, Galíndez returned to South Africa, where he once again beat Fourie by decision in 15.

1976 saw a trip to Norway, where he beat Harald Skog by a knockout in three to retain the title, and to Denmark, where he beat Jesse Burnett by a decision in ten in a non tite affair. Then came a third trip to South Africa, where he knocked out challenger Richie Kates in the 15th and last round, and, after a fight with Billy Douglas in Buenos Aires, (a win by decision in ten) he found himself in South Africa once again, where he beat Kosie Smith by a decision in fifteen to once again, retain the title.

After beginning 1977 by beating Guillermo Aquirrezabala by a knockout in four in Mendoza, he and Kates had a rematch in Rome, Italy, where Galíndez once again beat Kates by decision over 15. Next, the Argentine champion and challenger Yaqui López faced-off in a 15-round title bout, once again in Italy, and Galíndez retained the title by a decision in Rome. Galíndez&#x27; last fight of &#x27;77 took him to Italy for a third time, and he beat future world champion Eddie Mustafa Muhammad (then Eddie Gregory) by a decision in fifteen.

In 1978, Galíndez went to Italy again, retaining the title with a fifteen-round decision in a rematch with Lopez, and then he made a series of non-title bouts in Argentina before he went on the road again, this time losing his title to Mike Rossman by a knockout in 13, in the same undercard where Muhammad Ali recovered the world Heavyweight title for the third time by beating Leon Spinks at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans.

After his first fight in 1979, beating Roberto Aguilar by a knockout in six back home, he and Rossman were supposed to have a rematch in February of that year, but Galíndez refused to fight, arguing that the judges selected for the rematch would probably favor Rossman. However, the rematch did come off later that year, and Galíndez recovered the world championship, once again in New Orleans, knocking Rossman out in 10 rounds. This time, however, he wouldn&#x27;t last long as king of the Light Heavyweights, and he lost the title in his first defense, by a knockout in 11 to Marvin Johnson, a boxer who would later join Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Robinson and Carlos De León among others as one of the few boxers to be world champions three times in the same category. The fight with Johnson also took place in New Orleans.

He had a boxing record of 52 wins, 9 losses and 4 draws with 2 no contests, and 34 wins by knockout. He successfully defended the WBA world light heavyweight title ten times against seven boxers.

In 2002, Galíndez was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

== Death ==
After losing a rematch with Burnett in 1980 by a decision in twelve in Anaheim, California, Galíndez was forced to retire because of two operations to repair his detached retinas, and then he tried to pursue his other dream of becoming a stock-car race driver. On 25 October of that year, he participated in what would be his first and last Turismo Carretera race, as a co-driver. After a mechanical failure shortly after the start of the race, Galíndez and his driver Antonio Lizeviche headed towards the pits, walking alongside the road. A car of another competitor lost control and hit Galíndez and Lizeviche, killing them on the spot.

<text>Staffa (, , from the Old Norse for stave or pillar island) is an island of the Inner Hebrides in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. The Vikings gave it this name as its columnar basalt reminded them of their houses, which were built from vertically placed tree-logs.

Staffa lies about west of the Isle of Mull; its area is and the highest point is above sea level.

The island came to prominence in the late 18th century after a visit by Sir Joseph Banks. He and his fellow-travellers extolled the natural beauty of the basalt columns in general and of the island&#x27;s main sea cavern, which Banks renamed &#x27;Fingal&#x27;s Cave&#x27;. Their visit was followed by those of many other prominent personalities throughout the next two centuries, including Queen Victoria and Felix Mendelssohn. The latter&#x27;s &quot;Hebrides Overture&quot; brought further fame to the island, which was by then uninhabited. It is now in the care of the National Trust for Scotland.

==Geology and pre-history==

In prehistoric times (Pleistocene) Staffa was covered by the ice sheets which spread from Scotland out into the Atlantic Ocean beyond the Outer Hebrides. After the last retreat of the ice around 20,000 years ago, sea levels were up to lower than at present. Although the isostatic rise of land makes estimating post-glacial coastlines a complex task, around 14,000 years ago it is likely that Staffa was part of a larger island, just off the coast of mainland Scotland, which would have included what are now Mull, Iona and the Treshnish Isles.

Steadily rising sea levels then further isolated this little island, which is entirely of volcanic origin. It consists of a basement of tuff, underneath colonnades of a black fine-grained Tertiary basalt, overlying which is a third layer of basaltic lava without a crystalline structure. By contrast, slow cooling of the second layer of basalt resulted in an extraordinary pattern of predominantly hexagonal columns which form the faces and walls of the principal caves. The lava contracted towards each of a series of equally spaced centres as it cooled and solidified into prismatic columns, a process known as columnar jointing. The columns typically have three to eight sides, six being most common. The columns are also divided horizontally by cross joints. These columnar jointed sections represent the tops and bottoms of individual lava flows. Between these sections lie regions of much more chaotic jointing, known as the entablature. The origin of the entablature is unknown, but could be due to flooding of the lava flow, causing much more rapid cooling, or the interaction of stress fields from the two regions of columnar jointing as they approach one another.

Similar formations are found at the Giant&#x27;s Causeway in Northern Ireland, on the island of Ulva and at Ardmeanach on the Isle of Mull. Grooves in the roof of MacKinnon&#x27;s cave indicate either a pyroclastic flow or a series of eroded ash falls in the rock above the columnar basalt. The &#x27;Staffa Group&#x27; is the name given to the series of olivine tholeiite basalts found in the vicinity of Mull which erupted 55–58 million years ago.

==Geography==
Staffa lies about 10 kilometres (6 mi) west of Mull, and 9 km northeast of Iona. It is longitudinally oriented north–south, and is a kilometre long by about half a kilometre wide. The circumference is about 3.8 km in extent. In the northeast the isle shelves to a shore, but otherwise the coast is rugged and much indented; numerous caves have been carved out by rain, streams and sea. There is enough grass to feed a few cattle, and the island has a spring.

On the east coast are Goat Cave and Clamshell Cave. The latter is 10 m high, about 6 m wide at the entrance, and some 45 m long, and on one side of it the ridges of basalt stand out like the ribs of a ship. Near this cave is the pyramidal rock islet of &quot;Am Buachaille&quot; (&#x27;The Herdsman&#x27;), a pile of basalt columns seen fully only at low tide. Other outlying rocks include Eilean Dubh to the north-west and a series of skerries stretching for half a kilometre to the south-west. On the southwest shore are Boat Cave and Mackinnon&#x27;s Cave (named after a 15th-century abbot of Iona), which has a tunnel connecting it to Cormorant Cave. These caves lie to the south-west and can be accessed from the bay of Port an Fhasgaidh at low tide. In 1945 a mine exploded near Boat Cave, causing damage to the cliff face which is still visible. Mackinnon&#x27;s Cave is 107 metres long.

Staffa&#x27;s most famous feature is Fingal&#x27;s Cave, a large sea cave located near the southern tip of the island some 20 m high and 75 m long formed in cliffs of hexagonal basalt columns. This cliff face is called the Colonnade or The Great Face and it was these cliffs and their caves that inspired Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Die Hebriden&quot; (English: Hebrides Overture opus 26), which was premiered in London in 1832. The original Gaelic name for Fingal&#x27;s Cave is &quot;An Uamh Bhin&quot; – &quot;the melodious cave&quot; – but it was subsequently renamed after the 3rd-century Irish warrior Fionn MacCool. Mendelssohn was nonetheless inspired by the sound of the waves in the cave and waxed lyrical about his visit, claiming that he arrived in Scotland &quot;with a rake for folk-songs, an ear for the lovely, fragrant countryside, and a heart for the bare legs of the natives.&quot;

==History==
===18th century===
Little is known of the early history of Staffa, although the Swiss town of Stäfa on Lake Zurich was named after the island by a monk from nearby Iona. Part of the Ulva estate of the MacQuarries from an early date until 1777, it was brought to the English-speaking world&#x27;s attention after a visit by Sir Joseph Banks in August 1772. &quot;En route&quot; to Iceland in the company of the painter Johann Zoffany, the Bishop of Linköping, and the Swedish naturalist Daniel Solander, Banks (later a president of the Royal Society) was entertained by Maclean of Drummen, on the Isle of Mull. Hearing about Staffa he resolved to visit and set out from Tobermory the next day. The winds were light and they did not arrive until darkness had fallen. Banks wrote:
It was too dark to see anything, so we carried our tent and baggage near the only house on the island, and began to cook our suppers, in order to be prepared for the earliest dawn, and to enjoy that which, from the conversation of the gentlemen we had, now raised the highest expectations of.
They were not disappointed. Despite becoming infested with lice during his short stay on the island, he provided glowing reports of his visit. He confessed that he was:
forced to acknowledge that this piece of architecture, formed by nature, far surpasses that of the Louvre, that of St. Peter at Rome, all that remains of Palmyra and Paestum, and all that the genius, the taste and the luxury of the Greeks were capable of inventing.
Samuel Johnson and his protege James Boswell visited clan MacQuarrie on Ulva in 1773, the year after Banks&#x27; visit. Perhaps aware that Banks considered that the columnar basalt cliff formations on Ulva called &quot;The Castles&quot; rivalled Staffa&#x27;s Johnson wrote:
When the islanders were reproached with their ignorance or insensibility of the wonders of Staffa, they had not much to reply. They had indeed considered it little, because they had always seen it; and none but philosophers, nor they always, are struck with wonder otherwise than by novelty.
Amongst the first eminent overseas visitors to Staffa were Barthélemy Faujas de Saint-Fond, a wealthy French zoologist and mineralogist and the American architect and naturalist William Thornton. Visiting in 1784, they were suitably impressed, Faujus writing: &quot;this superb monument of nature, which in regard to its form bears so strong a resemblance to a work of art, though art can certainly claim no share in it.&quot;

===19th and 20th centuries===
Subsequently, a stream of famous visitors came to view Staffa&#x27;s wonders including Robert Adam, Sir Walter Scott (1810), John Keats (1818), J. M. W. Turner, whose 1830 visit yielded an oil painting exhibited in 1832, William Wordsworth (1833), Jules Verne (1839), Alice Liddell (the inspiration for Alice in Wonderland) in 1878, David Livingstone (1864), Robert Louis Stevenson (1870) and Mendelssohn himself in 1829. Wordsworth, however, found the volume of tourism disappointing.
Writing more than a century later the writer W. H. Murray agreed, complaining that the visitors spoiled the &quot;character and atmosphere&quot;, and suggesting that &quot;to know Staffa one must go alone&quot;.

Others were more enthusiastic, despite the presence of numerous others. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were rowed into the cave in the royal barge in 1847, and &quot;The Times&quot; correspondent recorded:

Keats complained about the expense of the ferry, but was captivated by what he saw nonetheless. Displeased with his first efforts to describe this &quot;cathedral of the sea&quot; he finally settled on:
===Tenants and owners===

However inspiring the scenery, it was not an easy place in which to live. In 1772 there was only a single family, living on a diet of barley, oats, and potatoes, and whatever their grazing animals could provide, and growing flax. By the end of the 18th century they had deserted Staffa, apparently terrified by the severity of winter storms. Signs of &quot;rig and furrow&quot; agriculture can still be seen on the island but the only surviving building is the ruin of a 19th-century shelter for travellers.

By 1800 the island was under the ownership of Colin MacDonald of Lochboisdale. In 1816 his son Ranald MacDonald sold Staffa into the care of trustees. In 1821 these trustees sold the island to Alexander Forman as trustee, the purchase money being paid by his brother John Forman WS. It remained in the Forman family until sold by Bernard Gilpin Vincent &quot;Pat&quot; Forman in 1968. There were several private owners after that, including Alastair de Watteville, a descendant of Colin MacDonald who wrote a book about the island, until finally Jock Elliott Jr. of New York gifted it to the National Trust for Scotland in 1986 to honour the 60th birthday of his wife, Eleanor. A grateful National Trust bestowed upon her the honorific &quot;Steward of Staffa&quot;. In a 2005 poll of &quot;Radio Times&quot; readers, Staffa was named as the eighth-greatest natural wonder in Britain.

During the 20th century there were issues of bogus postage stamps bearing Staffa&#x27;s name.

==Nature and conservation==

In 1800 there were three red deer on the island, later replaced by goats and then by a small herd of black cattle. Subsequently, the summer grazing was used for sheep by crofters from Iona, but in 1997 all livestock was removed. This has led to a regeneration of the island&#x27;s vegetation. The island supports a diverse range of plants, with species such as common heather, kidney vetch, common-bird&#x27;s-foot trefoil, wild thyme and tormentil all found. The clifftop grassland supports species such as red fescue, yorkshire fog, thrift, sea campion, sea plantain and ribwort plantain.

Staffa is nationally important for breeding fulmars, common shags and puffins, and great skuas and gulls also nest on the island. The surrounding waters provide a livelihood for numerous seabirds, grey seals, dolphins, basking sharks, minke, and pilot whales.

The island has been designated as a national nature reserve since 2001. The national nature reserve is classified as a Category II protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Staffa is also a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), whilst the seas surrounding the island are designated as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) due to the presence of harbour porpoises. Staffa is part of the Loch Na Keal National Scenic Area, one of 40 in Scotland.

==Visiting Staffa==
Boat trips from Tiree, Tobermory, Oban, Ulva Ferry and Fionnphort on Mull, and Iona allow visitors to view the caves and the puffins that nest on the island between May and September. There is a landing place used by the tourist boats just north of Am Buachaille, but disembarkation is only possible in calm conditions. The island lacks a genuine anchorage. To avoid disturbing the ground-nesting birds, the National Trust for Scotland asks people not to bring dogs to Staffa between 1 April and 30 September.

<text>Wrawby Postmill is a windmill at Wrawby near Brigg, in North Lincolnshire, England.

The mill is the last post mill in the north of England, and was built between 1760 and 1790 to serve the Elsham Hall estate. Originally it had four common sails, but through most of its working life had a more usual combination of two common and two spring sails, providing power with flexibility. It was working until the 1940s, when it had four spring sails, before becoming derelict. Following the possibility of its demolition, it was acquired and restored in 1962 by Wrawby Windmill Preservation Society. It was returned to working order in 1965 with new sails and a new set of stones. Maintenance work in 2008, which returned the mill to mixed sail types, was funded by the SPAB Mill Repairs Fund and local residents.

The mill is the last working post mill in Northern England, and is open to the public. The mill also contains a small museum of milling tools, and holds milling demonstrations. The windmill was grade II* listed in 1951.

<text>&quot;Howl&quot;, also known as &quot;Howl for Carl Solomon&quot;, is a poem written by Allen Ginsberg in 1954–1955 and published in his 1956 collection &quot;Howl and Other Poems&quot;. The poem is dedicated to Carl Solomon.

Ginsberg began work on &quot;Howl&quot; in 1954. In the Paul Blackburn Tape Archive at the University of California, San Diego, Ginsberg can be heard reading early drafts of his poem to his fellow writing associates. &quot;Howl&quot; is considered to be one of the great works of American literature. It came to be associated with the group of writers known as the Beat Generation.

Ginsberg read a draft of &quot;Howl&quot; at the Six Gallery reading in San Francisco in 1955. Fellow poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti of City Lights Books, who attended the performance, published the work in 1956. Upon the poem&#x27;s release, Ferlinghetti and the bookstore&#x27;s manager, Shigeyoshi Murao, were charged with disseminating obscene literature, and both were arrested. On October 3, 1957, Judge Clayton W. Horn ruled that the poem was not obscene.

==Writing ==
According to Ginsberg&#x27;s bibliographer and archivist Bill Morgan, it was a terrifying peyote vision that was the principal inspiration for &quot;Howl&quot;. This occurred on the evening of October 17, 1954, in the Nob Hill apartment of Sheila Williams, Ginsberg&#x27;s girlfriend at that time, with whom he was living. Ginsberg had the terrifying experience of seeing the façade of the Sir Francis Drake Hotel in the San Francisco fog as the monstrous face of a child-eating demon. Ginsberg took notes on his vision, and these became the basis for Part II of the poem.

In late 1954 and 1955, in an apartment he had rented at 1010 Montgomery Street in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco, Ginsberg worked on the poem, originally referring to it by the working title &quot;Strophes&quot;. Some drafts were purportedly written at a coffeehouse called Caffe Mediterraneum in Berkeley, California; Ginsberg had moved into a small cottage in Berkeley a few blocks from the campus of the University of California on September 1, 1955. Many factors went into the creation of the poem. A short time before the composition of &quot;Howl&quot;, Ginsberg&#x27;s therapist, Dr. Philip Hicks, encouraged him to realize his desire to quit his market-research job and pursue poetry full-time and to accept his own homosexuality. He experimented with a syntactic subversion of meaning called parataxis in the poem &quot;Dream Record: June 8, 1955&quot; about the death of Joan Vollmer, a technique that became central in &quot;Howl&quot;.

Ginsberg showed this poem to Kenneth Rexroth, who criticized it as too stilted and academic; Rexroth encouraged Ginsberg to free his voice and write from his heart. Ginsberg took this advice and attempted to write a poem with no restrictions. He was under the immense influence of William Carlos Williams and Jack Kerouac and attempted to speak with his own voice spontaneously. Ginsberg began the poem in the stepped triadic form he took from Williams but, in the middle of typing the poem, his style altered such that his own unique form (a long line based on breath organized by a fixed base) began to emerge.

Ginsberg experimented with this breath-length form in many later poems. The first draft contained what later became Part I and Part III. It is noted for relating stories and experiences of Ginsberg&#x27;s friends and contemporaries, its tumbling, hallucinatory style, and the frank address of sexuality, specifically homosexuality, which subsequently provoked an obscenity trial. Although Ginsberg referred to many of his friends and acquaintances (including Neal Cassady, Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs, Peter Orlovsky, Lucien Carr, and Herbert Huncke), the primary emotional drive was his sympathy for Carl Solomon, to whom it was dedicated; he had met Solomon in a mental institution and became friends with him.

Ginsberg later stated this sympathy for Solomon was connected to bottled-up guilt and sympathy for his mother&#x27;s schizophrenia (she had been lobotomized), an issue he was not yet ready to address directly. In 2008, Peter Orlovsky told the co-directors of the 2010 film &quot;Howl&quot; that a short moonlit walk—during which Orlovsky sang a rendition of the Hank Williams song &quot;Howlin&#x27; At the Moon&quot;—may have been the encouragement for the title of Ginsberg&#x27;s poem. &quot;I never asked him, and he never offered,&quot; Orlovsky told them, &quot;but there were things he would pick up on and use in his verse form some way or another. Poets do it all the time.&quot; The Dedication by Ginsberg states he took the title from Kerouac.

==Performance and publication==
The poem was first performed at the Six Gallery in San Francisco on October 7, 1955. Ginsberg had not originally intended the poem for performance. The reading was conceived by Wally Hedrick—a painter and co-founder of the Six—who approached Ginsberg in mid-1955 and asked him to organize a poetry reading at the Six Gallery. &quot;At first, Ginsberg refused. But once he&#x27;d written a rough draft of Howl, he changed his &#x27;fucking mind&#x27;, as he put it.&quot;

Ginsberg was ultimately responsible for inviting the readers (Gary Snyder, Philip Lamantia, Philip Whalen, Michael McClure and Kenneth Rexroth) and writing the invitation. &quot;Howl&quot; was the second to last reading (before &quot;A Berry Feast&quot; by Snyder) and was considered by most in attendance the highlight of the reading. Many considered it the beginning of a new movement, and the reputation of Ginsberg and those associated with the Six Gallery reading spread throughout San Francisco. In response to Ginsberg&#x27;s reading, McClure wrote: &quot;Ginsberg read on to the end of the poem, which left us standing in wonder, or cheering and wondering, but knowing at the deepest level that a barrier had been broken, that a human voice and body had been hurled against the harsh wall of America...&quot;

Jack Kerouac gave a first-hand account of the Six Gallery performance (in which Ginsberg is renamed &#x27;Alvah Goldbrook&#x27; and the poem becomes &#x27;Wail&#x27;) in Chapter 2 of his 1958 novel, &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot;:Anyway I followed the whole gang of howling poets to the reading at Gallery Six that night, which was, among other important things, the night of the birth of the San Francisco Poetry Renaissance. Everyone was there. It was a mad night. And I was the one who got things jumping by going around collecting dimes and quarters from the rather stiff audience standing around in the gallery and coming back with three huge gallon jugs of California Burgundy and getting them all piffed so that by eleven o&#x27;clock when Alvah Goldbrook was reading his poem &#x27;Wail&#x27; drunk with arms outspread everybody was yelling &#x27;Go! Go! Go!&#x27; (like a jam session) and old Rheinhold Cacoethes the father of the Frisco poetry scene was wiping his tears in gladness.Soon afterwards, &quot;Howl&quot; was published by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, who ran City Lights Bookstore and the &quot;City Lights Press.&quot; Ginsberg completed Part II and the &quot;Footnote&quot; after Ferlinghetti had promised to publish the poem. It was too short to make an entire book, so Ferlinghetti requested some other poems. Thus the final collection contained several other poems written at that time; with these poems, Ginsberg continued the experimentation with long lines and a fixed base he&#x27;d discovered with the composition of &quot;Howl&quot; and these poems have likewise become some of Ginsberg&#x27;s most famous: &quot;America&quot;, &quot;Sunflower Sutra&quot;, &quot;A Supermarket in California&quot;, etc.

The earliest extant recording of &quot;Howl&quot; was thought to date from March 18, 1956, but in 2007 an earlier recording was found. Ginsberg had read his poem at the Anna Mann dormitory at Reed College on February 13 and 14, with the second of those dates recorded. The tape was in excellent condition and was released by Omnivore Recordings in 2021. In this recording, Ginsberg performs Part I of his poem. In the March 18 reading, in Berkeley, he performed all three parts.

==Overview and structure==
The poem consists of 112 paragraph-like lines, which are organized into three parts, with an additional footnote.

===Part I===
Called by Ginsberg &quot;a lament for the Lamb in America with instances of remarkable lamb-like youths&quot;, Part I is perhaps the best known, and communicates scenes, characters, and situations drawn from Ginsberg&#x27;s personal experience as well as from the community of poets, artists, political radicals, jazz musicians, drug addicts, and psychiatric patients whom he had encountered in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Ginsberg refers to these people, who were underrepresented outcasts in what the poet believed to be an oppressively conformist and materialistic era, as &quot;the best minds of my generation&quot;. He describes their experiences in graphic detail, openly discussing drug use and homosexual activity at multiple points.

Most lines in this section contain the fixed base &quot;who&quot;. In &quot;Notes Written on Finally Recording &quot;Howl&quot;&quot;, Ginsberg writes, &quot;I depended on the word &#x27;who&#x27; to keep the beat, a base to keep measure, return to and take off from again onto another streak of invention&quot;.

===Part II===
Ginsberg says that Part II, in relation to Part I, &quot;names the monster of mental consciousness that preys on the Lamb&quot;. Part II is about the state of industrial civilization, characterized in the poem as &quot;Moloch&quot;. Ginsberg was inspired to write Part II during a period of peyote-induced visionary consciousness in which he saw a hotel façade as a monstrous and horrible visage which he identified with that of Moloch, the Biblical idol in Leviticus to whom the Canaanites sacrificed children.

Ginsberg intends that the characters he portrays in Part I be understood to have been sacrificed to this idol. Moloch is also the name of an industrial, demonic figure in Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot;, a film that Ginsberg credits with influencing &quot;Howl, Part II&quot; in his annotations for the poem (see especially &quot;Howl: Original Draft Facsimile, Transcript &amp; Variant Versions&quot;). Most lines in this section contain the fixed base &quot;Moloch&quot;. Ginsberg says of Part II, &quot;Here the long line is used as a stanza form broken into exclamatory units punctuated by a base repetition, Moloch.&quot;

===Part III===
Part III, in relation to Parts I and II, is &quot;a litany of affirmation of the Lamb in its glory&quot;, according to Ginsberg. It is directly addressed to Carl Solomon, whom Ginsberg met during a brief stay at a psychiatric hospital in 1949; called &quot;Rockland&quot; in the poem, it was actually Columbia Presbyterian Psychological Institute. This section is notable for its refrain, &quot;I&#x27;m with you in Rockland&quot;, and represents something of a turning point away from the grim tone of the &quot;Moloch&quot;-section. Of the structure, Ginsberg says Part III is &quot;pyramidal, with a graduated longer response to the fixed base&quot;.

===Footnote===
The closing section of the poem is the &quot;Footnote&quot;, characterized by its repetitive &quot;Holy!&quot; mantra, an ecstatic assertion that everything is holy. Ginsberg says, &quot;I remembered the archetypal rhythm of Holy Holy Holy weeping in a bus on Kearny Street, and wrote most of it down in notebook there. ... I set it as &#x27;Footnote to Howl&#x27; because it was an extra variation of the form of Part II.&quot;

===Rhythm===
The frequently quoted and often parodied opening lines set the theme and rhythm for the poem:

Ginsberg&#x27;s own commentary discusses the work as an experiment with the &quot;long line&quot;. For example, Part I is structured as a single run-on sentence with a repetitive refrain dividing it up into breaths. Ginsberg said, &quot;Ideally each line of &#x27;Howl&#x27; is a single breath unit. My breath is long—that&#x27;s the measure, one physical-mental inspiration of thought contained in the elastic of a breath.&quot;

On another occasion, he explained: &quot;the line length ... you&#x27;ll notice that they&#x27;re all built on bop—you might think of them as a bop refrain—chorus after chorus after chorus—the ideal being, say, Lester Young in Kansas City in 1938, blowing 72 choruses of &#x27;The Man I Love&#x27; until everyone in the hall was out of his head...&quot;

==1957 obscenity trial==
&quot;Howl&quot; contains many references to illicit drugs and sexual practices, both heterosexual and homosexual. Claiming that the book was obscene, customs officials seized 520 copies of the poem that were being imported from
England on March 25, 1957.

On June 3 Shig Murao, the bookstore manager, was arrested and jailed for selling &quot;Howl and Other Poems&quot; to an undercover San Francisco police officer. City Lights publisher Lawrence Ferlinghetti was subsequently arrested for publishing the book. At the obscenity trial, nine literary experts testified on the poem&#x27;s behalf. Ferlinghetti, a published poet himself, is credited (by David Skover and Ronald K. L. Collins) with breathing &quot;publishing life&quot; into Ginsberg&#x27;s poetic career. Supported by the American Civil Liberties Union, Ferlinghetti won the case when California State Superior Court Judge Clayton Horn decided that the poem was of &quot;redeeming social importance&quot;.

The case was widely publicized, with articles appearing in both &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; magazines. An account of the trial was published by Ferlinghetti&#x27;s lead defense attorney Jake Ehrlich in a book called &quot;Howl of the Censor&quot;. The 2010 film &quot;Howl&quot; depicts the events of the trial. James Franco stars as the young Allen Ginsberg and Andrew Rogers portrays Ferlinghetti.

==1969 broadcast controversy in Finland==

Part one of &quot;Howl&quot; was broadcast in Finland on September 30, 1969, on Yleisradio&#x27;s (Finland&#x27;s national public-broadcasting company) &quot;parallel programme&quot; at 10:30 p.m. The poem was read by three actors with jazz music specially composed for this radio broadcast by Henrik Otto Donner. The poem was preceded by an eight-minute introduction. The Finnish translation was made by Anselm Hollo. The translation was published already in 1961 in &quot;Parnasso&quot; literary magazine, and caused no turmoil then.

A Liberal People&#x27;s Party member of the Finnish Parliament, Arne Berner, heard the broadcast, and started an interpellation, addressed to the Minister of Transport and Public Works. It was signed by him and 82 of the 200 members of parliament. It is unclear how many of the other signatories actually had heard the broadcast. The interpellation text only contained a short extract of six lines (considered to be offensive, and representative of the poem) of over seventy from the poem, and the debate was mainly based upon them.

Also, a report of an offence was filed to the criminal investigation department of Helsinki police district because the obscenity of the poem allegedly offended modesty and delicacy. The report was filed by Suomen kotien radio- ja televisioliitto (The radio and television association of Finnish homes), a Christian and patriotic organization, and it was only based on the six-line fragment. In connection with that, Yleisradio was accused of copyright violation. No charges followed.

At that time, homosexual acts were still illegal in Finland.

Finally, the Ministry of Transport and Public Works considered in December 1969 that the broadcast of &quot;Howl&quot; contravened the licence of operation of Yleisradio: it was neither educational nor useful. Yleisradio received a reprimand, and was instructed to be more careful when monitoring that no more such programs should be broadcast.

===Footnote to &quot;Howl&quot;===

==Critical reception==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; sent Richard Eberhart to San Francisco in 1956 to report on the poetry scene there. The result of Eberhart&#x27;s visit was an article published in the September 2, 1956 &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; titled &quot;West Coast Rhythms&quot;. Eberhart&#x27;s piece helped call national attention to &quot;Howl&quot; as &quot;the most remarkable poem of the young group&quot; of poets who were becoming known as the spokespersons of the Beat generation.

On October 7, 2005, celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the first reading of the poem were staged in San Francisco, New York City, and in Leeds in the UK. The British event, Howl for Now, was accompanied by a book of essays of the same name, edited by Simon Warner and published by Route Publishing (&quot;Howl for Now&quot; ) reflecting on the piece&#x27;s enduring influence.

===1997 broadcasting controversy===
Boston independent alternative rock radio station WFNX became the first commercial radio station to broadcast &quot;Howl&quot; on Friday, July 18, 1997, at 6:00 p.m. despite Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Safe Harbor laws which allow for mature content later at night.

===2007 broadcasting fears===
In late August 2007, Ron Collins, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Nancy Peters, Bill Morgan, Peter Hale, David Skover, Al Bendich (one of Ferlinghetti&#x27;s lawyers in the 1957 obscenity trial), and Eliot Katz petitioned Pacifica Radio to air Ginsberg&#x27;s &quot;Howl&quot; on October 3, 2007, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the verdict declaring the poem to be protected under the First Amendment against charges of obscenity. Fearing fines from the FCC, Pacifica New York radio station WBAI opted not to broadcast the poem. The station chose instead to play the poem on a special webcast program, replete with commentary (by Bob Holman, Regina Weinreich and Ron Collins, narrated by Janet Coleman), on October 3, 2007.

== Legacy ==

Part II of the poem was used as libretto for Song #7 in &quot;Hydrogen Jukebox&quot;, a 1990 chamber opera using a selection of Ginsberg&#x27;s poems set to music by Philip Glass. The title itself comes from the poem: &quot;...listening to the crack of doom on the hydrogen jukebox...&quot;
The first line of the poem, &quot;I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical ...&quot; was also used as the opening line in the song &quot;I Should Be Allowed to Think&quot; by They Might Be Giants. A paraphrased version of the quote, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen the best minds of my generation, they are starving, hysterical, and naked&quot; can be heard during the interlude of Machinehead by Bush.

The opening of the poem was also recited by Richard Moll in the 1981 movie &quot;American Pop&quot;.

==Film==
The 2010 film &quot;Howl&quot; explored Ginsberg&#x27;s life and works. Constructed in a nonlinear fashion, the film juxtaposes historical events with a variety of cinematic techniques. It reconstructs the early life of Ginsberg during the 1940s and 1950s. It also re-enacts Ginsberg&#x27;s debut performance of &quot;Howl&quot; at the Six Gallery Reading on October 7, 1955, in black-and-white. Parts of the poem are interpreted through animated sequences, and the events are juxtaposed with color images of Ferlinghetti&#x27;s 1957 obscenity trial.

<doc id="158052" wikidata="Q325662" url="?curid=158052" title="Aguirre, the Wrath of God">
<text>Aguirre, the Wrath of God (; ; ) is a 1972 epic historical drama film produced, written and directed by Werner Herzog. Klaus Kinski stars in the title role of Spanish soldier Lope de Aguirre, who leads a group of conquistadores down the Amazon River in South America in search of the legendary city of gold, El Dorado. The accompanying soundtrack was composed and performed by kosmische musik band Popol Vuh. The film is an international co-production between West Germany and Mexico.

Using a minimalist approach to story and dialogue, the film creates a vision of madness and folly, counterpointed by the lush but unforgiving Amazonian jungle. Although loosely based on what is known of the historical Lope de Aguirre, Herzog acknowledged years after the film&#x27;s release that its storyline is a work of fiction. Some of the people and situations may have been inspired by missionary Gaspar de Carvajal&#x27;s account of an earlier Amazonian expedition, although Carvajal never accompanied Aguirre on any of his expeditions.

&quot;Aguirre&quot; was the first of five collaborations between Herzog and Kinski. They had differing views as to how the role should be played, and they clashed throughout filming; Kinski&#x27;s rage terrorized both the crew and the locals who were assisting the production. The film was shot entirely on location, and has itself become famous for its difficulties. During an arduous five-week shoot in the Peruvian rainforest Herzog filmed on and near tributaries of the Amazon River in the Ucayali region. The cast and crew climbed mountains, cut through heavy vines to open routes to the various jungle locations, and rode treacherous river rapids on rafts built by local craftworkers.

&quot;Aguirre&quot; opened to widespread critical acclaim, and quickly developed a large international cult following. It was given an extensive arthouse theatrical release in the United States in 1977, and remains one of the director&#x27;s best-known films. Several critics have declared the film a masterpiece, and it has appeared on &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;All Time 100 Best Films&quot;.

==Plot==
On Christmas Day, 1560, several scores of Spanish conquistadors under Gonzalo Pizarro and a hundred native slaves march down from the newly conquered Inca Empire into the Amazon rainforest in search of the fabled El Dorado. The men, clad in half armor, pull cannons down narrow mountain paths and through dense, muddy jungle.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve, Pizarro orders a group of forty men to build rafts and scout down the river. If they do not return to the main party within one week with news of what lies beyond, they will be considered lost. Pizarro chooses Don Pedro de Ursúa as the commander of the expedition, Don Lope de Aguirre as his second-in-command, portly nobleman Don Fernando de Guzmán to represent the Spanish crown, and Brother Gaspar de Carvajal to bring the word of God. Accompanying the expedition, against Pizarro&#x27;s better judgment, are Ursúa&#x27;s mistress, Doña Inés, and Aguirre&#x27;s teenage daughter Flores.

One of the four rafts gets caught in an eddy while traveling through river rapids, and the others are unable to help free it. That night, gunfire erupts on the trapped raft; in the morning, the men on board are found dead, with three missing. Ursúa wants the bodies to be brought back to camp for burial. Knowing this would slow down the expedition, Aguirre suggests that Perucho fire the cannon to clean the rust from it. He fires at the raft, destroying it and throwing the bodies into the river.

During the night, the remaining rafts are swept away by the rising river. Time has run out for the scouting mission, and Ursúa decides to return to Pizarro&#x27;s group despite the danger from hostile natives. Aguirre leads a mutiny against Ursúa, telling the men that untold riches await them ahead, and reminding them that Hernán Cortés won an empire in Mexico by disobeying orders. Ursúa orders Aguirre arrested, but he and a soldier loyal to him are shot. Aguirre nominates Guzmán as the new leader of the expedition and rebels against the Spanish crown, proclaiming Guzmán the emperor of El Dorado. A farcical trial of Ursúa results in his being sentenced to death, but Guzmán surprises Aguirre by granting Ursúa clemency.

Aguirre remains the true leader of the mutiny, so oppressive and terrifying that few protest his leadership. Only Inés has the courage to speak out against him. Knowing that some of the soldiers are still loyal to Ursúa, Aguirre ignores her.

The expedition continues downriver on a single large raft. An indigenous couple approaching peacefully by canoe are captured by the explorers, and when the man expresses confusion upon being presented with a Bible, Brother Carvajal kills them for blasphemy. Guzmán dines on the low food supplies while the men starve, and has the expedition&#x27;s only remaining horse pushed off the raft because it annoys him; soon afterwards he is found dead near the raft&#x27;s privy. After Guzmán&#x27;s death, Aguirre proclaims himself leader. Ursúa is then taken ashore and hanged in the jungle. The group attacks an indigenous village, where several soldiers are killed by spears and arrows. The distraught Inés walks into the jungle and disappears.

On the raft, the group of slowly starving, feverish men begin disbelieving everything they see, even when shot at with arrows. The group stares in disbelief at a wooden ship perched in the highest branches of a tall tree. Aguirre orders that it be brought down and refurbished, but Brother Carvajal refuses. In a series of attacks by unseen assailants, all of the remaining crew except Aguirre are killed by arrows. Monkeys overrun the raft as Aguirre imagines conquering all of the Americas and founding an incestuous dynasty with his deceased daughter to rule over it. Picking up a monkey, he asks, &quot;Who else is with me?&quot;

==Cast==
==Production==
The idea for the film began when Herzog borrowed a book on historical adventurers from a friend. After reading a half-page devoted to Lope de Aguirre, the filmmaker became inspired and immediately devised the story. He fabricated most of the plot details and characters, although he did use some historical figures in purely fictitious ways.

===Screenplay===
Herzog wrote the screenplay &quot;in a frenzy&quot; in two-and-a-half days. Much of the script was written during a bus trip with Herzog&#x27;s football team. His teammates got drunk after winning a game and one vomited on several pages of Herzog&#x27;s manuscript, which he immediately threw out the window. Herzog claims that he cannot remember what he wrote on these pages.

The screenplay was mostly shot as written, with only minor differences. In an early scene in which Pizarro instructs Ursúa to lead the scouting team down the river, in the script, Pizarro mentions that in the course of the expedition Ursúa could possibly discover what happened to Francisco de Orellana&#x27;s expedition, which had vanished without a trace years before (see &quot;Historical Accuracy&quot; section). Later in the screenplay, Aguirre and his men find a boat and the long-dead remains of Orellana&#x27;s soldiers.

Further down the river, they discover another ship lodged in the treetops. In the screenplay, Aguirre and others explore the boat but find no sign of Orellana or his men. Herzog ultimately eliminated any such references to Orellana&#x27;s expedition from the film. The sequence with the boat caught in the upper branches of a tree remains, but as filmed it seems to be simply a hallucinatory vision.

The finale is significantly different from Herzog&#x27;s original script. The director recalled, &quot;I only remember that the end of the film was totally different. The end was actually the raft going out into the open ocean and being swept back inland, because for many miles you have a counter-current, the Amazon actually goes backwards. And it was tossed to and fro. And a parrot would scream: &#x27;El Dorado, El Dorado. This ending was eventually adapted for &quot;Cobra Verde&quot;, Herzog&#x27;s final film with Kinski.

===Herzog and Kinski===
Herzog&#x27;s first choice for the role of Aguirre was Klaus Kinski. The two had met many years earlier when the then-struggling young actor rented a room in Herzog&#x27;s family apartment, and Kinski&#x27;s often terrifying antics during the three months he lived there left a lasting impression on the young Herzog. Years later, the director remembered the volatile actor and knew that he was the only possible man who could play Aguirre, and he sent Kinski a copy of the screenplay. &quot;Between three and four in the morning, the phone rang&quot;, Herzog recalled. &quot;It took me at least a couple of minutes before I realized that it was Kinski who was the source of this inarticulate screaming. And after an hour of this, it dawned on me that he found it the most fascinating screenplay and wanted to be Aguirre.&quot;

From the beginning of the production, Herzog and Kinski argued about the proper manner to portray Aguirre. Kinski wanted to play a &quot;wild, ranting madman&quot;, but Herzog wanted a &quot;quieter, more menacing&quot; portrayal. In order to get the performance he desired, Herzog would deliberately infuriate Kinski before each shot and wait for the actor&#x27;s anger to &quot;burn itself out&quot; before rolling the camera.

On one occasion, irritated by the noise from a hut where members of the cast and crew were playing cards, the explosive Kinski fired three gunshots at it, blowing the tip off of one extra&#x27;s finger. Kinski subsequently decided to leave the jungle location over Herzog&#x27;s refusal to fire a sound assistant, only changing his mind after Herzog threatened to shoot first Kinski and then himself. The latter incident has given rise to the legend that Herzog made Kinski act for him at gunpoint; however, Herzog has repeatedly denied this claim during interviews, saying he only verbally threatened Kinski in the heat of the moment in a desperate attempt to keep him from leaving the set. This incident is parodied in the 2004 film &quot;Incident at Loch Ness&quot;, which Herzog co-wrote.

===Filming===
The film was made for $370,000 (), with one-third of the budget going towards Kinski&#x27;s salary. It was filmed on location in the Peruvian rainforest, Machu Picchu (the stone steps of Huayna Picchu), and on the Amazon River tributaries of the Ucayali region. &quot;Aguirre&quot; was shot in five weeks following nine months of pre-production planning. The film was shot in chronological order, as Herzog believed the film crew&#x27;s progress on the river directly mirrored that of the explorers&#x27; journey in the story. The director and his cast and crew floated in rafts down the Huallaga and Nanay rivers through the Urubamba Valley.

All of the actors spoke their dialogue in English. The members of the cast and crew came from sixteen countries, and English was the only common language among them. In addition, Herzog felt that shooting &quot;Aguirre&quot; in English would improve the film&#x27;s chances for international distribution. However, the small amount of money that had been set aside for post-synchronization &quot;left Peru with the man in charge of the process; both absconded &quot;en route&quot;&quot;. The English-language track was ultimately replaced by a higher-quality German-language version, which was dubbed after production was completed. According to Herzog, Kinski requested too much money for the dubbing session, and so his lines were performed by another actor.

The low budget precluded the use of stunt men or elaborate special effects. Cinematography in many scenes was done in order to accommodate the inclement weather and terrain of the region, with the camera lens often being obscured by rainwater and mud when the cast moved through thicker regions of the jungle. The cast and crew climbed up mountains, experienced the adverse conditions of the jungle, and rode Amazonian river rapids on rafts built by locals. At one point, a storm caused a river to flood, covering the film sets in several feet of water and destroying all the rafts built for the film. This flooding was immediately incorporated into the story, as a sequence including a flood and subsequent rebuilding of rafts was shot.

The camera used to shoot the film was stolen by Herzog from the Munich Film School. Years later, Herzog recalled:

It was a very simple 35mm camera, one I used on many other films, so I do not consider it a theft. For me, it was truly a necessity. I wanted to make films and needed a camera. I had some sort of natural right to this tool. If you need air to breathe, and you are locked in a room, you have to take a chisel and hammer and break down a wall. It is your absolute right.

To obtain the monkeys used in the climactic sequence, Herzog paid several locals to trap 400 monkeys. He paid them half in advance and was to pay the other half upon receipt. The trappers sold the monkeys to someone in Los Angeles or Miami, and Herzog came to the airport just as the monkeys were being loaded to be shipped out of the country. He pretended to be a veterinarian and claimed that the monkeys needed vaccinations before leaving the country. Abashed, the handlers handed the monkeys over to Herzog, who used them in the shot they were required for, then released them afterwards into the jungle.

===Music===

&quot;Aguirre&quot; musical score was performed by Popol Vuh, a West German progressive/Krautrock band. The band was formed in 1969 by keyboardist Florian Fricke, who had known Herzog for several years prior to the formation of the band.
He had appeared as an actor in the director&#x27;s first full-length film, &quot;Signs of Life&quot; (1968), playing a pianist. &quot;Aguirre&quot; was only the first of many collaborations between the band and the director.

Popol Vuh&#x27;s &quot;hypnotic music&quot; for &quot;Aguirre&quot; met with considerable acclaim. Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;The music sets the tone. It is haunting, ecclesiastical, human and yet something else ... [T]he music is crucial to &quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&quot;&quot;. AllMusic noted, &quot;The film&#x27;s central motif blends pulsing Moog and spectral voices conjured from Florian Fricke&#x27;s Mellotron-related &#x27;choir organ&#x27; to achieve something sublime, in the truest sense of the word: it&#x27;s hard not to find the music&#x27;s awe-inspiring, overwhelming beauty simultaneously unsettling. The power of the legendary opening sequence of Herzog&#x27;s film ... owes as much to Popol Vuh&#x27;s music as it does to the director&#x27;s mise-en-scène.&quot;

Herzog explained how the choir-like sound was created: &quot;We used a strange instrument, which we called a &#x27;choir-organ.&#x27; It has inside it three dozen different tapes running parallel to each other in loops. ... All these tapes are running at the same time, and there is a keyboard on which you can play them like an organ so that [it will] sound just like a human choir but yet, at the same time, very artificial and really quite eerie.&quot;

In 1975 Popol Vuh released an album entitled &quot;Aguirre&quot;. Although ostensibly a soundtrack album to Herzog&#x27;s film, the six-track LP included only two songs (&quot;Aguirre I (L&#x27;Acrime Di Rei)&quot; and &quot;Aguirre II&quot;) taken from &quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&quot;. The four remaining tracks were derived from various recordings made by the group between about 1972 and 1974. At the time of &quot;Aguirre&quot; the band members were Fricke (piano, Mellotron), Fichelscher (electric guitar, acoustic guitar, drums), Djong Yun (vocals), and Robert Eliscu (oboe, pan pipe). The film features several music pieces that have not been released in any form.

===&quot;Wings of Hope&quot;===
While Herzog was location scouting for &quot;Aguirre&quot; in Peru, his reservation on LANSA Flight 508 was canceled due to a last minute change in itinerary. During this flight, the airplane disintegrated in mid-air after a lightning strike and crashed in the Peruvian Amazon rainforest in 1971, killing 91 people: all on board except 17-year-old Juliane Koepcke. Herzog was inspired to make the 1998 documentary film &quot;Wings of Hope&quot; about Koepcke&#x27;s survival, since he had narrowly avoided taking the same flight.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The film was produced in part by West German television station Hessischer Rundfunk, which televised the film on the same day it opened in theatres. Herzog has blamed this for the relatively poor commercial reception of the film in Germany. However, outside Germany the film became an &quot;enormous cult favorite&quot; in &quot;such places as Mexico, Venezuela, and Algiers&quot;. The film had a theatrical run of fifteen months in Paris. &quot;Aguirre&quot; received a theatrical release in the United States in 1977 by New Yorker Films. It immediately became a cult film, and New Yorker Films reported four years after its initial release that it was the only film in its catalog that never went out of circulation.

In Germany, the &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot; described the film as &quot;a colour-drenched, violently physical moving painting&quot;. The &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; described Kinski&#x27;s acting as &quot;too theatrical&quot; to embody God&#x27;s wrath.

In the US and the UK the film received mostly positive critical notices upon release. Vincent Canby, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called it &quot;[A]bsolutely stunning ... Mr. Herzog views all the proceedings with fixed detachment. He remains cool. He takes no sides. He may even be slightly amused. Mainly he is a poet who constantly surprises us with unexpected juxtapositions ... This is a splendid and haunting work.&quot;

In &quot;Time&quot;, Richard Schickel opined that &quot;[Herzog] does the audience the honor of allowing it to discover the blindnesses and obsessions, the sober lunacies he quietly lays out on the screen. Well acted, most notably by Klaus Kinski in the title role, gloriously photographed by Thomas Mauch, &quot;Aguirre&quot; is, not to put too fine a point on it, a movie that makes a convincing claim to greatness.&quot; &quot;Time Out&#x27;s&quot; Tony Rayns noted, &quot;each scene and each detail is honed down to its salient features. On this level, the film effectively pre-empts analysis by analysing itself as it proceeds, admitting no ambiguity. Yet at the same time, Herzog&#x27;s flair for charged explosive imagery has never had freer rein, and the film is rich in oneiric moments.&quot;

===Legacy===
The film&#x27;s reputation through the years has continued to grow. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 96% of 54 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 9/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;A haunting journey of natural wonder and tangible danger, &quot;Aguirre&quot; transcends epic genre trappings and becomes mythological by its own right.&quot;

J. Hoberman has written that &quot;Aguirre&quot; &quot;is not just a great movie but an essential one ... Herzog&#x27;s third feature ... is both a landmark film and a magnificent social metaphor&quot;. Danny Peary wrote, &quot;To see &quot;Aguirre&quot; for the first time is to discover a genuine masterpiece. It is overwhelming, spellbinding; at first dreamlike, and then hallucinatory.&quot; Roger Ebert has added it to his list of The Great Movies, and in a 2002 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll of critics and filmmakers on the best films ever made, Ebert listed it in his top ten. In the same poll, critic Nigel Andrews and director Santosh Sivan also placed it in their top ten list. Martin Scorsese included it on a list of &quot;39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker&quot;.

In 1999, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included the film on the magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Maverick Movies of the Last 100 Years&quot; list. &quot;Aguirre&quot; was included in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;All Time 100 Best Films&quot;, compiled by Richard Schickel and Richard Corliss. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named it the 46th greatest cult film ever made. The film was ranked #19 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema&quot; in 2010.

&quot;Aguirre&quot; has won several prestigious film awards. In 1973 it won the Deutscher Filmpreis (German Film Award) for &quot;Outstanding Individual Achievement: Cinematography&quot;. In 1976 it was voted the &quot;Best Foreign Film&quot; by the French Syndicate of Film Critics. In 1977 the National Society of Film Critics in the United States gave it their &quot;Best Cinematography&quot; Award. It won the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association in 1976 and was nominated for a &quot;Best Film&quot; César Award.

===Influence===
Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s 1979 film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, a film based on Joseph Conrad&#x27;s 1902 novella &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, was also influenced by &quot;Aguirre&quot;, containing seemingly deliberate visual &quot;quotations&quot; of Herzog&#x27;s film. Coppola himself has noted that &quot;&quot;Aguirre&quot;, with its incredible imagery, was a very strong influence. I&#x27;d be remiss if I didn&#x27;t mention it.&quot;

Several critics have noted that &quot;Aguirre&quot; appears to have had a direct influence on several other films. Martin Rubin has written that &quot;[a]mong the films strongly influenced by &quot;Aguirre&quot; are Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; and Terrence Malick&#x27;s &quot;The New World&quot; (2005)&quot;. J. Hoberman agreed, noting that Herzog&#x27;s &quot;sui generis Amazon fever dream&quot; was &quot;the influence Malick&#x27;s over-inflated &quot;New World&quot; can&#x27;t shake.&quot; Channel 4 opined &quot;This is an astonishing, deceptively simple, pocket-sized epic whose influence, in terms of both style and narrative, is seen in films as diverse as &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, &quot;The Mission&quot;, &quot;Predator&quot;, and &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; (1999).&quot;

==Historical accuracy==
Although plot details and many of the characters in &quot;Aguirre&quot; come directly from Herzog&#x27;s own imagination, historians have pointed out that the film fairly accurately incorporates some 16th-century events and historical personages into a fictional narrative.

Herzog&#x27;s screenplay merged two expeditions: one led by Gonzalo Pizarro in 1541, which resulted in the discovery by Europeans of the Amazon River by Francisco de Orellana, and another one that occurred in 1560.
The expedition of Gonzalo Pizarro and his men left from the city of Quito and entered the Amazon basin in search of El Dorado. Various troubles afflicted the expedition and, sure that El Dorado was very close, Pizarro set up a smaller group led by Francisco de Orellana, to break off from the main group and forge ahead, then return with news of what they had found.

This group utilized a brigantine to journey down the river. After failing to find the legendary city, Orellana was unable to return because of the current, and he and his men continued to follow the Napo River until he reached the estuary of the Amazon in 1542. Accompanying Orellana was Gaspar de Carvajal, who kept a journal of the group&#x27;s experiences.

The historic Gaspar de Carvajal (1500–1584) was a Spanish Dominican friar who had settled in Peru and dedicated himself to the conversion of the Indigenous peoples. His general attitude towards the local people was consistent with the benevolence of his better-known brother Dominican friar, Bartolomé de las Casas. This personality is at odds with the description in the film where Carvajal is portrayed as a cowardly priest who claimed that &quot;the church was always on the side of the strong&quot;.

The film&#x27;s major characters, Aguirre, Ursúa, Don Fernando, Inez and Flores, were involved in the second expedition, which left Peru in 1560 to find the city of El Dorado. Commissioned by Peru&#x27;s governor, Ursúa organized an expeditionary group of 300 men to travel by way of the Amazon River. He was accompanied by his mixed-race mistress, Doña Inez. At one point during the journey, Aguirre, a professional soldier, decided that he could use the 300 men to overthrow the Spanish rule of Peru. Aguirre had Ursúa murdered and proclaimed Fernando as &quot;The Prince of Peru&quot;.

Fernando himself was eventually murdered when he questioned Aguirre&#x27;s scheme of sailing to the Atlantic, conquering Panama, crossing the isthmus and invading Peru. Many others who attempted to rebel against Aguirre were also killed. The surviving soldiers conquered Isla Margarita off the coast of Venezuela and made preparations to attack the mainland.

By that time, Spanish authorities had learned of Aguirre&#x27;s plans. When the rebels arrived in Venezuela, government agents offered full pardons to Aguirre&#x27;s men. All of them accepted the deal. Immediately prior to his arrest, Aguirre murdered his daughter Flores, who had remained by his side during the entire journey. He was then captured and dismembered.

Other Spanish expeditions outside the Amazon influenced the story. The conversation in which the local inhabitants refuse a Bible comes from events before the Battle of Cajamarca, in which Inca emperor Atahualpa allegedly rejected the (declaration by the Spanish monarchy in 1513 of its divine right to take New World territories). The chronicle of Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, &quot;La Relación&quot; (&quot;The Account&quot;), mentions the appearance of a boat in a treetop after a fierce tropical storm in Hispaniola:

Kinski&#x27;s crazed performance bore similarities to the real Aguirre, a &quot;true homicidal megalomaniac&quot;. Many of his fellow soldiers considered his actions to be that of a madman. Kinski&#x27;s use of a limp reflected a limp that Aguirre had, the result of a battle injury. Aguirre&#x27;s frequent short but impassioned speeches to his men in the film were accurately based on the man&#x27;s noted &quot;simple but effective rhetorical ability&quot;. The &quot;South Atlantic Review&quot; observes the film&#x27;s attitude toward historical accuracy as being similar to works of Shakespeare:Like Shakespeare, Herzog begins with chronicle accounts of events and personages, but then re-shapes and embroiders upon these historical chronicles, at once providing answers and revealing more puzzling questions, not only turning &quot;history&quot; into &quot;art&quot; (a tenuous distinction in any case), but meditating upon the makers and the making of history.

— Gregory A. WallerAdditionally noted is the juxtaposition of Spanish imperialism with that of Nazism, specifically citing Aguirre&#x27;s deranged closing speech as &quot;historical analogy with Hitler and German fascism&quot;.

&quot;Film Quarterly&quot; further expands on this point, marking the casting of Kinski as emblematic of this historical parallel:[Herzog] achieves this dimension by choosing an actor with typically Nordic coloring: Klaus Kinski, with his blond hair and blue eyes. According to historical accounts, Aguirre was &quot;of short stature . . . sparely made, ill-featured, the face small and lean, [the] beard black. &quot; Herzog&#x27;s Aguirre is not of &quot;short stature&quot; but although he is not very tall, his deformity causes him to stand out. Unlike the historical Aguirre, this one has unusually large features and is beardless and blond. Through this blond Nordic knight, Herzog alludes to a much earlier age of expansionism: to medieval Germany with the religious imperialism of the Crusaders and the Teutonic Knights, and also to a more recent period: the 1930s, which combined the rebirth of the Nordic stereotype (seen in the light of racial superiority) with Hitler&#x27;s attempts at imperialist conquest. Herzog&#x27;s main character is more than a conquistador of one particular century; he is the embodiment of imperialism as such.

Seen in this light, Herzog&#x27;s re-creation of a specific period in history, i.e., Spain&#x27;s conquests in the New World, becomes a treatise on the evils of imperialism through the ages. It is not surprising then, that Herzog&#x27;s film constitutes a great flight of fancy mostly leaving historical data behind and making instead a collage of fact and fiction.While film journalists acknowledge the various liberties taken within the film&#x27;s depiction of historical events, these choices are observed as creative decisions on the part of the director, both in service of the narrative structure and also as reflections of imperialist and fascist manifestations occurring throughout history, both prior to and following the 16th-century conquest of South America. Kinski&#x27;s manic performance combined with the film&#x27;s blunt portrayal of violence toward the native population acts less as a literal portrayal of events and more as broad condemnation of both historical events and the concept of imperialist conquest.

<text>No contest (abbreviated &quot;NC&quot;) is a technical term used in some combat sports to describe a fight that ends for reasons outside the fighters&#x27; hands, without a winner or loser. The concept carried over to professional wrestling, where it is far more common, usually scripted to further a feud, generate heat and/or protect a push.
==Boxing==
In the 19th and early parts of the 20th century, many countries (and some parts of the United States) officially banned boxing, and occasionally the police would step in to shut down the bouts (which, although unlawful, were still sanctioned by regional boxing commissions). Since boxing is now lawful virtually anywhere in the world, the number of fights called no contest has decreased dramatically since the beginning of the 20th century. Referees were also known to stop bouts during this period when they felt bouts were too slow due to lack of aggression from one or both boxers.

In the modern game, the various rules that dictate whether a fight should be called a no contest, a disqualification, or a knockout differ between countries and boxing organizations. Rules in the United States now dictate that any bout which ends prior to the completion of the 4th round, due to an accidental headbutt, is to be declared a no contest. Prior to this, accidental headbutt stoppages had been ruled a technical draw. Most other no contests in boxing occur when unusual circumstances, which would include instances such as an outdoor bout being rained out, the ring falling apart, or an unexpected injury caused by something outside of the boxer&#x27;s control. 

One good example of an unusual circumstance occurred in 1983, on the undercard of the fight where Roberto Durán beat Davey Moore for the World Jr. Middleweight title at the Madison Square Garden, when Luis Resto and Billy Collins Jr boxed ten rounds. Resto appeared to win the fight cleanly, and the scorers gave the match to Resto. But, it was later discovered that he had cheated by tampering with his gloves before the fight. The injuries Collins received affected his sight, and, upon finding out what Resto and his corner had done, the New York State Athletic Commission decided to change the result of the fight to a no contest.

On August 28, 1998, Bernard Hopkins fought Robert Allen in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States. The fight was ruled a no contest when Hopkins was injured after he was accidentally pushed out of the ring by referee Mills Lane as Lane was trying to break up a clinch.

==Mixed martial arts==
No contest decisions in mixed martial arts (MMA) are usually declared when an &quot;accidental&quot; illegal strike (the rules on which differ from each organization) causes the recipient of the blow to be unable to continue, that decision being made by the referee, doctor, the fighter or his corner. Each fighter receives a NC counted in their record and is scored as neither a win nor a loss. Blows from &quot;intentional&quot; illegal strikes that force a fighter to be unable to continue are generally not declared a no contest, but as a win and a loss by disqualification for the appropriate fighters.

In 2007, a controversial no contest decision in MMA occurred at &quot;The Ultimate Fighter 5&quot; season finale between Rob Emerson and Gray Maynard. Maynard knocked himself temporarily unconscious during a takedown of Emerson, who then submitted due to an aggravated injury of the ribs, each being unaware that the other fighter could not continue. While awaiting the official announcement, many believed that Gray Maynard would be declared the winner, because Emerson tapped out and it appeared that Maynard was unharmed. The NC decision was made due to both fighters being unable to continue. A replay of the incident, taken from a different angle, later confirmed that Maynard had indeed knocked himself out and needed assistance to stand back up.

At &quot;Legends of Fighting Championship 25: Breaking Point&quot; in May 2008, Tyler Bryan and Shaun Parker knocked each other out simultaneously with two legal punches. Referee Shonie Carter, surprised and unsure of protocol, ultimately signaled for a no-contest rather than a draw. Both fighters became popular video stars and ended their brief fighting careers later that year.

In the case of a title fight that is ruled a no contest, the champion will retain their title, but it will not be counted as a title defense. An example of this can be found in the second bout between Daniel Cormier and Jon Jones at UFC 214. Jones was originally awarded a victory and won the title, but the decision was overturned due to a failed drug test. The title was returned to Cormier, who entered the bout as champion, but the bout is not considered as one of his title defenses at light-heavyweight.

==Team sports==
===American football===
A 2023 game between the Cincinnati Bengals and the Buffalo Bills was officially ruled a no contest after Bills safety Damar Hamlin suffered a sudden cardiac arrest and collapsed on the field. The game was suspended with 5:58 remaining in the first quarter, and was officially ruled a no contest three days later. Hamlin survived, and as of September 2024, still plays for the Bills.

<text>Dorris Alexander&quot;Dee&quot;Brown (February 29, 1908 – December 12, 2002) was an American novelist, historian, and librarian. His most famous work, &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; (1970), details the history of the United States&#x27; westward colonization of the continent between 1860 and 1890 from the point of view of Native Americans.

== Personal life ==

Born on Leap Year Day 1908 (a Saturday, and the same day Billy the Kid killer Pat Garrett died in what would in 1912 become New Mexico) in Alberta, Louisiana, a sawmill town, Brown grew up in Ouachita County, Arkansas, which experienced an oil boom when he was thirteen years old. Brown&#x27;s mother later relocated to Little Rock so he and his brother and two sisters could attend a better high school. He spent much time in the public library reading the three-volume &quot;History of the Expedition under the Command of Captains Lewis and Clark&quot; which saw him develop an interest in the American West. He also discovered the works of Sherwood Anderson and John Dos Passos, and later William Faulkner and Joseph Conrad. He cited these authors as those most influential on his own work.

While attending home games by the baseball team the Arkansas Travelers, he became acquainted with Chief Yellow Horse, a pitcher. His kindness, and a childhood friendship with a Creek boy, caused Brown to reject the descriptions of Native American peoples as violent and primitive, which dominated American popular culture at the time.

He worked as a printer and reporter in Harrison, Arkansas, and decided to continue his education at Arkansas State Teachers College in Conway, Arkansas. His mentor, the history professor Dean D. McBrien, helped give him the idea to become a writer. They traveled west along with other students on two occasions in a Model T Ford. On campus, Brown worked as an editor to the student newspaper and was a student assistant in the library. The latter convinced him that he should become a librarian.

In the midst of the Great Depression he went to George Washington University in Washington, D.C. for graduate study. Brown worked part-time for J. Willard Marriott, attended classes, and married Sally Stroud (another graduate of Arkansas State Teachers College drawn to Washington by the New Deal). Eventually he found a full-time job and became a librarian for the U.S. Department of Agriculture from 1934 to 1942. He lived at 1717 R Street NW, in the Dupont Circle neighborhood.

Brown&#x27;s first novel was a satire of New Deal bureaucracy, but it was not published, owing to the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The publisher suggested &quot;something patriotic&quot; instead. He responded with &quot;Wave High The Banner&quot;, a fictionalized account of the life of Davy Crockett (who was an acquaintance of his great-grandfather). A few months after its publication, he was drafted into the U.S. Army where he met Martin Schmitt, with whom he collaborated on several works after the war. During the war, Brown worked for the United States Department of War as a librarian and never went overseas.

From 1948 to 1972, he was an agriculture librarian at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where he had gained a master&#x27;s degree in library science, became a professor, and raised a son, Mitchell, and daughter, Linda, with his wife Sally.

As a part-time writer, he published nine books, three fiction and six nonfiction, by the end of the 1950s. During the 1960s, he completed eight more including &quot;The Galvanized Yankees&quot;, which Brown described as requiring more research than any of his other books, and &quot;The Year of the Century: 1876&quot;, which he described as his personal favorite.

During 1971, his book &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; became a best-seller. Many readers assumed that Brown was of Native American heritage.

During 1973, Brown and his wife retired in Little Rock, Arkansas, where he devoted his time to writing. His later works include &quot;Creek Mary&#x27;s Blood&quot;, a novel telling of several generations of a family descended from one Creek woman, and &quot;Hear That Lonesome Whistle Blow&quot;, which described the chicanery and romance concerning the construction of the western railroads. His last book-length work, &quot;The Way To Bright Star,&quot; is a picaresque novel set during the Civil War. He never completed its sequel, which was to feature P. T. Barnum and Abraham Lincoln.

Brown died at the age of 94 in Little Rock, Arkansas. His remains are interred in Urbana, Illinois, along with those of his wife.

<text>Mount Pleasant Mill is a windmill north of Kirton in Lindsey on the North Cliff Road in North Lincolnshire in the east of England (Yorkshire and the Humber).

==Construction==
It was built in 1875 for miller Edric Lansdall as a four-patent-sailed, slightly tapering four-storeyed tarred tower mill with onion-shaped cap and fantail on top of the remaining roundhouse of a previously erected post-mill. The junction between the former roundhouse wall of hand-made bricks and the newly superimposed tower made of machine-moulded bricks is almost indistinguishable. On the second floor, the stone floor, originally three pairs of millstones (two pairs of peak stones (grey stones or greys) and one pair of quartzite (French stone)) were driven, of which only one grey pair remained. This peak stone is cut from rock millstone grit quarried in the Peak District of southwest Yorkshire and northeast Derbyshire, England.

The mill has had a namesake windmill in Stockton-on-Tees, built around 1790 as an 8-storeyed four-sailed stage-windmill of ca. 80 ft height in reverse colours (white painted tower with black onion-shaped cap) and demolished around the late 1920s.

==History==

Mount Pleasant Mill worked by wind until 1933 and by a diesel single cylinder Crossley engine until 1973. Fred Banks, who ran it then, also owned Alford Windmill. It is the only windmill in the area beside Heapham Mill with original and unrestored equipment and machinery of the 1920s and 1930s. The original cap with the oak cap frame is still in place. The original &quot;windshaft&quot;, &quot;wallower&quot;, &quot;upright shaft&quot; and &quot;great spur whee&quot;l are made of cast iron, as are the tooth ring of the wooden &quot;brakewheel&quot; with its timber clasp arm construction and wooden brake, all installed in the 1930s. A refinement to the mill is the elevator to replace the old &quot;sack hoist&quot; which worked off the underside of the &quot;wallower&quot; by a friction ring, and the elevator to feed the first floor bin (3rd floor) for the hurst frame. This is a massive timber frame supporting the transfer gearing and heavy mill stones casings, helping to reduce the vibration of the turning mill stones and their wheels (&quot;stone nuts&quot;). It is a separate structure inside the mill tower thus reducing the transfer of vibrations and noise into the building itself.

The mill was restored in 1991 and is a commercially working flour mill, making organic flour which is sold to the public. There is a tea room for visitors.

On 29 November 2015 the windmill was severely damaged by high winds, causing two of the sails and the tail-fan to be torn off - some pieces landing away. The mill was shut for two weeks and is now up and running through the use of electric motors powering the French burr stones and the Derbyshire peaks. Business is continuing as usual producing a range of organic flours and fresh breads using a wood-fired oven.

<doc id="158061" wikidata="Q315723" url="?curid=158061" title="Burl Ives">
<text>Burl Icle Ivanhoe Ives (June 14, 1909 – April 14, 1995) was an American musician, singer and actor with a career that spanned more than six decades.

Ives began his career as an itinerant singer and guitarist, eventually launching his own radio show, &quot;The Wayfaring Stranger&quot;, which popularized traditional folk songs. In 1942, he appeared in Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;This Is the Army&quot; and became a major star of CBS Radio. In the 1960s, he successfully crossed over into country music, recording hits such as &quot;A Little Bitty Tear&quot; and &quot;Funny Way of Laughin&#x27;&quot;. Ives was also a popular film actor through the late 1940s and &#x27;50s. His film roles included parts in &quot;So Dear to My Heart&quot; (1948) and &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (1958), as well as the role of Rufus Hannassey in &quot;The Big Country&quot; (1958), for which he won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and the film noir &quot;Day of the Outlaw&quot; (1959).

Ives is often associated with the Christmas season. He did voice-over work as Sam the Snowman, narrator of the classic 1964 Christmas television special &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;. Ives also worked on the special&#x27;s soundtrack, including the songs &quot;A Holly Jolly Christmas&quot; and &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;, both of which continue to chart annually on the &quot;Billboard&quot; holiday charts into the 2020s.

==Early life==
Ives was born in Hunt City, an unincorporated town in Jasper County, Illinois, near Newton, to Levi &quot;Frank&quot; Ives (1880–1947) and Cordelia &quot;Dellie&quot; (née White; 1882–1954). He had six siblings: Audry, Artie, Clarence, Argola, Lillburn, and Norma. His father was first a farmer and then a contractor for the county and others. One day, Ives was singing in the garden with his mother, and his uncle overheard them. He invited his nephew to sing at the old soldiers&#x27; reunion in Hunt City. The boy performed a rendition of the folk ballad &quot;Barbara Allen&quot; and impressed both his uncle and the audience.

From 1927 to 1929, Ives attended Eastern Illinois State Teachers College (now Eastern Illinois University) in Charleston, Illinois, where he played football. During his junior year, he was sitting in English class, listening to a lecture on &quot;Beowulf,&quot; when he suddenly realized he was wasting his time. As he walked out of the door, the professor made a snide remark and Ives slammed the door behind him, shattering the window in the door. Sixty years later, the school named a building after its most famous dropout. Ives was a member of the Charleston Chapter of The Order of DeMolay and is listed in the DeMolay Hall of Fame. He was also initiated into Scottish Rite Freemasonry in 1927. He was elevated to the 33rd and highest degree in 1987, and was later elected the Grand Cross.

On July 23, 1929, in Richmond, Indiana, Ives made a trial recording of &quot;Behind the Clouds&quot; for the Starr Piano Company&#x27;s Gennett label, but the recording was rejected and destroyed a few weeks later. In later years Ives did not recall having made the record.

==Music career==
===1930s–1940s===
Ives traveled about the U.S. as an itinerant singer during the early 1930s, earning his way by doing odd jobs and playing his banjo. He was jailed in Mona, Utah, for vagrancy and for singing &quot;Foggy Dew&quot; (an English folk song), which the authorities decided was a bawdy song. Around 1931, he began performing on WBOW radio in Terre Haute, Indiana. He also went back to school, attending classes at Indiana State Teachers College (now Indiana State University). In 1933, Ives also attended the Juilliard School in New York. He made his Broadway debut in 1938 with a small role in Rodgers and Hart&#x27;s hit musical, &quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot;. In 1939, he joined his friend and fellow actor Eddie Albert, who had the starring role in &quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot;, in Los Angeles. The two shared an apartment for a while in the Beachwood Canyon community of Hollywood.

In 1940, Ives named his own radio show, &quot;The Wayfaring Stranger&quot;, after one of his ballads. Over the next decade, he popularized several traditional folk songs, such as &quot;Foggy Dew&quot;, &quot;The Blue Tail Fly&quot; (an old minstrel tune now better known as &quot;Jimmy Crack Corn&quot;), and &quot;Big Rock Candy Mountain&quot; (an old hobo song). He was also associated with the Almanacs, a folk-singing group which at different times included Woody Guthrie, Will Geer, Millard Lampell, and Pete Seeger. The Almanacs were active in the American Peace Mobilization (APM), a far left group initially opposed to American entry into World War II and Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s pro-Allied policies. They recorded such songs as &quot;Get Out and Stay Out of War&quot; and &quot;Franklin, Oh Franklin&quot;.

In June 1941, after the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, the APM abandoned its pacifist stance and reorganized itself into the pro-war American People&#x27;s Mobilization. Ives and the Almanacs rerecorded several of their songs to reflect the group&#x27;s new stance in favor of US entry into the war. Among them were &quot;Dear Mr. President&quot; and &quot;Reuben James&quot; (the name of a US destroyer sunk by the Germans before the official US entry into the war).

In early 1942, Ives was drafted into the U.S. Army. He spent time first at Camp Dix, then at Camp Upton, where he joined the cast of Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;This Is the Army.&quot; He attained the rank of corporal. When the show went to Hollywood, he was transferred to the Army Air Forces. He was honorably discharged, apparently for medical reasons, in September 1943. Between September and December 1943, Ives lived in California with actor Harry Morgan. In December 1943, Ives went to New York City to work for CBS Radio for $100 a week. In 1944, he recorded &quot;The Lonesome Train&quot;, a ballad about the life and death of Abraham Lincoln, written by Earl Robinson (music) and Lampell (lyrics).

In 1946, Ives was cast as a singing cowboy in the film &quot;Smoky&quot;.

In 1947, Ives recorded one of many versions of &quot;The Blue Tail Fly&quot;, but paired this time with the popular Andrews Sisters (Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne). The flip side of the record was a fast-paced &quot;I&#x27;m Goin&#x27; Down the Road&quot;. Ives hoped the trio&#x27;s success would help the record sell well, which it did, becoming both a best-selling disc and a &quot;Billboard&quot; hit.

His version of the song &quot;Lavender Blue&quot; became his first hit and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song after Ives introduced it in the 1949 film &quot;So Dear to My Heart&quot;.

Music critic John Rockwell said, &quot;Ives&#x27; voice ... had the sheen and finesse of opera without its latter-day Puccinian vulgarities and without the pretensions of operatic ritual. It was genteel in expressive impact without being genteel in social conformity. And it moved people&quot;.

===1950s–1960s===

Ives was identified in the 1950 pamphlet &quot;Red Channels&quot; and blacklisted as an entertainer with supposed Communist ties. In 1952, he cooperated with the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and agreed to testify, fearful of losing his source of income. Ives&#x27;s statement to the HUAC ended his blacklisting, allowing him to continue acting in movies, but it also led to a bitter rift between Ives and many folk singers, including Pete Seeger, who accused Ives of naming names and betraying the cause of cultural and political freedom to save his own career. Seeger publicly ridiculed Ives for attempting to distance himself from many of the far left organizations he had supported. In 1993, Ives, by then using a wheelchair, reunited with Seeger during a benefit concert in New York City, having reconciled years earlier. They sang &quot;Blue Tail Fly&quot; together.

Ives expanded his appearances in films during this decade. His movie credits include the role of Sam the Sheriff of Salinas, California, in &quot;East of Eden&quot;, Big Daddy in &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;, roles in &quot;Desire Under the Elms&quot;, &quot;Wind Across the Everglades&quot;, &quot;The Big Country&quot;, for which he won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, &quot;Ensign Pulver&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;, and &quot;Our Man in Havana&quot;, based on the Graham Greene novel.

Barred for a while from American employment, he frequently played on BBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;, with such favorites as &quot;Big Rock Candy Mountain&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;ll Be Coming &#x27;Round the Mountain&quot;, and &quot;Lavender Blue&quot;. Ives also performed at the Royal Coronation festival in 1952 which purportedly was also attended by a young John Lennon and Paul McCartney.

He was the Mystery Guest on the August 7, 1955 and February 1, 1959, episodes of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot;.

===1960s–1990s===
In the 1960s, Ives began singing country music with greater frequency. In 1962, he released three songs that were popular with both country music and popular music fans: &quot;A Little Bitty Tear&quot;, &quot;Call Me Mister In-Between&quot;, and &quot;Funny Way of Laughin&#x27;&quot;. His records, recorded in Nashville for Decca Records, were produced by Owen Bradley, one of the record producers who (along with Chet Atkins) helped define the Nashville Sound style of country music that expanded the music&#x27;s appeal to a wider audience. Bradley used the Nashville A-Team of session musicians behind Ives, including the Anita Kerr Singers, which enhanced Ives&#x27; appeal. Bradley also produced the recording of Ives&#x27;s perennial Holiday favorite &quot;A Holly Jolly Christmas&quot; in Nashville.

Ives had several film and television roles during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1961, he sang the folk song, &quot;I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly&quot; for a short film of the same name produced by the National Film Board of Canada. In 1962, he starred with Rock Hudson in &quot;The Spiral Road,&quot; which was based on a novel of the same name by Jan de Hartog. He also starred in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Summer Magic&quot; with Hayley Mills, Dorothy McGuire, and Eddie Hodges, and a score by Robert and Richard Sherman. In 1964, he played the genie in the movie &quot;The Brass Bottle&quot; with Tony Randall and Barbara Eden.

Ives&#x27;s &quot;A Holly Jolly Christmas&quot; and &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; became Christmas standards after they were first featured in the 1964 NBC-TV presentation of the Rankin/Bass stop-motion animated family special &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;. Johnny Marks had composed the title song (originally an enormous hit for singing cowboy Gene Autry) in 1949, and producers Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass retained him to compose the TV special&#x27;s soundtrack. Ives voiced Sam the Snowman, the banjo-playing &quot;host&quot; and narrator of the story, explaining how Rudolph used his &quot;nonconformity&quot;, as Sam refers to it, to save Christmas from being cancelled due to an impassable blizzard. The following year, Ives rerecorded all three of the Johnny Marks hits which he had sung in the TV special, but with a more &quot;pop&quot; feel. He released them all as singles for the 1965 holiday season, capitalizing on their previous success. In 2022, 27 years after his death, &quot;A Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;, made the Billboard Year-End chart.

Ives performed in other television productions, including &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;Roots.&quot;

He starred in short-lived &quot;O.K. Crackerby!&quot; (1965–66), a comedy which costarred Hal Buckley, Joel Davison, and Brooke Adams, about the presumed richest man in the world, which replaced Walter Brennan&#x27;s somewhat similar &quot;The Tycoon&quot; on the ABC schedule from the preceding year.

He played Walter Nichols in the drama &quot;The Bold Ones: The Lawyers&quot; (1969–72), a segment of the wheel series &quot;The Bold Ones&quot;.

Ives narrated the 1971 season highlight film for the Washington Redskins of the National Football League produced by NFL Films. The Executive Producer was NFL Films founder Ed Sabol, and chief producer was Ed&#x27;s son, Steve Sabol. Ed and Steve Sabol are members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

Ives occasionally starred in macabre-themed productions. In 1970, for example, he played the title role in &quot;The Man Who Wanted to Live Forever&quot;, in which his character attempts to harvest human organs from unwilling donors. In 1972, he appeared as old man Doubleday in the episode &quot;The Other Way Out&quot; of Rod Serling&#x27;s &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, in which his character seeks a gruesome revenge for the murder of his granddaughter.

In honor of Ives&#x27;s influence on American vocal music, on October 25, 1975, he was awarded the University of Pennsylvania Glee Club Award of Merit. This award, initiated in 1964, was &quot;established to bring a declaration of appreciation to an individual each year who has made a significant contribution to the world of music and helped to create a climate in which our talents may find valid expression.&quot;

When America Sings opened at Disneyland in 1974, Ives voiced the main host, Sam Eagle, an Audio-Animatronic.

In 1976, Ives was featured as a main character in &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; season 3 episode 10 titled &quot;The Hunters&quot;. Ives played an old fur trapper who was blind and afraid to leave the comfort and safety of his cabin which he shared with his adult son (Johnny Crawford). In this episode Ives paired off with Laura Ingalls (Melissa Gilbert) to help rescue her injured father who was accidentally shot while hunting for venison.

Ives lent his name and image to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management&#x27;s &quot;This Land Is Your Land – Keep It Clean&quot; campaign in the 1970s. He was portrayed with the program&#x27;s fictional spokesman, Johnny Horizon.

Burl Ives was seen regularly in television commercials for Luzianne tea for several years during the 1970s and 1980s, when he was the company&#x27;s commercial spokesman.

In 1982 he played Carruthers, a dog trainer, in Samuel Fuller&#x27;s controversial and critically acclaimed film &quot;White Dog&quot;.

In 1989, Ives officially announced his retirement from show business on his 80th birthday. However, he continued to do occasional benefit concert performances of his own accord until 1993.

==Other engagements==

=== Broadway roles ===
Ives&#x27;s Broadway career included appearances in &quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot; (1938–39), &quot;Heavenly Express&quot; (1940), &quot;This Is the Army&quot; (1942), &quot;Sing Out, Sweet Land&quot; (1944), &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot; (1951–52), and &quot;Dr. Cook&#x27;s Garden&quot; (1967). His most notable Broadway performance (later reprised in a 1958 movie) was as &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Pollitt in &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (1955–56).

=== Autobiography ===
Ives&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Wayfaring Stranger&quot;, was published in 1948. He also wrote or compiled several other books, including &quot;Burl Ives&#x27; Songbook&quot; (1953), &quot;Tales of America&quot; (1954), &quot;Sea Songs of Sailing, Whaling, and Fishing&quot; (1956), and &quot;The Wayfaring Stranger&#x27;s Notebook&quot; (1962).

=== Boy Scouts ===
Ives had a long-standing relationship with the Boy Scouts of America. He was a Lone Scout before that group merged with the Boy Scouts of America in 1924. The organization &quot;inducted&quot; Ives in 1966. He received the Boy Scouts&#x27; Silver Buffalo Award, its highest honor. The certificate for the award is on display at the Scouting Museum in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.

Ives often performed at the quadrennial Boy Scouts of America jamboree, including the 1981 jamboree at Fort A.P. Hill in Virginia, where he shared the stage with the Oak Ridge Boys. There is a 1977 sound recording of Ives being interviewed by Boy Scouts at the National Jamboree at Moraine State Park, Pennsylvania. Ives was also the narrator of a 28-minute film about the 1977 National Jamboree. In the film, which was produced by the Boy Scouts of America, Ives &quot;shows the many ways in which Scouting provides opportunities for young people to develop character and expand their horizons.&quot;

== Civic awards ==
Ives was inducted as a laureate of the Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the state&#x27;s highest honor) by the governor of Illinois in 1976 in the area of the performing arts.

Ives was inducted into the DeMolay International Hall of Fame in June 1994.

== Personal life ==
On December 6, 1945, Ives, then 36, married 29-year-old script writer Helen Peck Ehrlich. Their son Alexander was born in 1949.

Ives and Helen Peck Ehrlich were divorced in February 1971. Ives married Dorothy Koster Paul in London two months later. In their later years, Ives and Paul lived in a waterfront home in Anacortes, Washington, in the Puget Sound area, and in Galisteo, New Mexico, near the Turquoise Trail. In the 1960s, he had another home just south of Hope Town on Elbow Cay, a barrier island of the Abacos in the Bahamas.

Ives, a longtime smoker of pipes and cigars, was diagnosed with oral cancer in the summer of 1994. After several unsuccessful operations, he decided against further surgery. He fell into a coma and died from the disease on April 14, 1995, at his home in Anacortes, Washington, at age 85. He was buried at Mound Cemetery in Hunt City Township, Jasper County, Illinois.

<text>Joseph Hill &quot;Joss&quot; Whedon ( ; born June 23, 1964) is an American screenwriter, director, producer, comic book writer, and composer. He is best known as the creator of several television series: the supernatural drama &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1997–2003) and its spinoff &quot;Angel&quot; (1999–2004), the short-lived space Western &quot;Firefly&quot; (2002), the Internet musical miniseries &quot;Dr. Horrible&#x27;s Sing-Along Blog&quot; (2008), the science fiction drama &quot;Dollhouse&quot; (2009–2010), the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;The Avengers&quot; (2012) and series &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; (2013–2020), and the science fiction drama &quot;The Nevers&quot; (2021).

After beginning his career in sitcoms, Whedon wrote the poorly received horror comedy film &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1992) – which he later adapted into the acclaimed television series of the same name – co-wrote the Pixar animated film &quot;Toy Story&quot; (1995), and wrote the science fiction horror film &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; (1997). After achieving success as a television showrunner, Whedon returned to film to write and direct the &quot;Firefly&quot; film continuation &quot;Serenity&quot; (2005), co-write and produce the horror comedy film &quot;The Cabin in the Woods&quot; (2012), and write and direct the Shakespeare adaptation &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (2012). For the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Whedon wrote and directed the ensemble superhero film &quot;The Avengers&quot; (2012) and its sequel &quot;&quot; (2015). He also co-wrote the DC Extended Universe superhero film &quot;Justice League&quot; (2017), for which he also served as director for re-shoots, replacing Zack Snyder (who retained directorial credit).

Whedon has also worked as a composer (notably for the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; musical episode &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; and &quot;Dr. Horrible&#x27;s Sing-Along Blog&quot;) and comic book writer, both for comic book continuations of television series he created and for established franchises, such as &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;.

Beginning in July 2020, multiple actors, producers, and writers spoke out against Whedon following the toxic workplace environment he had allegedly created in many of his projects. Whedon has denied any wrongdoing, while acknowledging that he can be &quot;confrontational&quot;.

==Early life==
Born on June 23, 1964, in New York City and raised on the Upper West Side as Joseph Hill Whedon, he would later become a third-generation TV writer as a son of Tom Whedon, a screenwriter for &quot;Alice&quot; in the 1970s and &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; in the 1980s, and a grandson of John Whedon, who worked on &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot; in the 1950s and &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; and &quot;That Girl&quot; in the 1960s, as well as writing for radio shows such as &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot;. His mother, Ann Lee (née Jeffries) Stearns, originally from Kentucky, was an activist and a teacher at Riverdale Country School as Lee Whedon, in addition to being an aspiring novelist. Jessica Neuwirth, a former student of Stearns, has often cited her as her inspiration, describing her as a &quot;visionary feminist&quot;. His parents both acted, appearing in a play together at the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club. The family would spend vacations reciting Shakespeare.

Whedon is the younger sibling of Samuel and Matthew Whedon and the older sibling of writers Jed and Zack Whedon. Whedon stated that his parents expected constant creativity from their children and were often verbally demeaning and gave them the silent treatment if he and his brothers were not amusing or entertaining, or if they simply disagreed with them. He stated, however, that he was more afraid of his older brothers who constantly bullied him. At the age of 5, a friend (age 4) died by drowning in a pond on the Whedons&#x27; upstate property. His parents divorced when he was 9. Whedon cited his childhood trauma as having a direct influence in his relationships, addictions and behaviors into adulthood and has stated that he suffers from complex post traumatic stress disorder.

At a young age, he showed great interest in British television series shows like &quot;Masterpiece&quot; and &quot;Monty Python&quot;. 
Whedon attended Riverdale Country School in New York City where his mother taught history. Starting at age 15, he spent three years at Winchester College, a boarding school in England. There, taking note of omnipresent bullying, he concluded, &quot;it was clear to me from the start that I must take an active role in my survival&quot;. Whedon graduated from Wesleyan University in 1987, where he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters in 2013. There, he also studied under renowned academic Richard Slotkin. It was at Wesleyan he would meet Jeanine Basinger, a film scholar who became his mentor. After leaving Wesleyan, Whedon conceived the first incarnation of Buffy Summers, &quot;Rhonda, the Immortal Waitress&quot;.

==Career==
===1980s–1990s===
====Early work====
From 1989 to 1990, Whedon worked as a staff writer on the sitcoms &quot;Roseanne&quot; and &quot;Parenthood&quot;. As a script doctor, Whedon was an uncredited writer on films including &quot;The Getaway&quot;, &quot;Speed&quot;, &quot;Waterworld&quot;, and &quot;Twister&quot;. Whedon worked on an early draft of &quot;X-Men&quot; which subsequently contained at least two of his contributions to dialogue exchanges, while the final cut of &quot;Speed&quot; retained most of his dialogue. While he was script consulting, he also wrote &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (the film that would precede the series), &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; and early drafts for &quot;Titan A.E.&quot; and &quot;&quot; – but would subsequently express strong dissatisfaction with the released versions of the first three of these films. He co-wrote &quot;Toy Story&quot;, which earned him a shared Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay. He became one of the highest paid screenwriters when he sold his &quot;Afterlife&quot; script to Columbia Pictures for $1.5 million.

====&quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;====

In 1997, Whedon created his first television series, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. The series depicts Buffy Summers, the latest in a line of young women called to battle against vampires, demons, and other forces of darkness. The idea came directly from his aversion to seeing the Hollywood formula of &quot;the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie&quot;. Whedon said he wanted to subvert the idea and create someone who was a hero. This conception came from &quot;the very first mission statement of the show, which was the joy of female power: having it, using it, sharing it&quot;. The writing process came together from conversations about the emotional issues facing Buffy Summers, and how she would confront them in her battle against supernatural forces. Whedon usually directed episodes from his own scripts that held the most cathartic moments in Buffy&#x27;s story.

The series received numerous awards and nominations, including an Emmy Award nomination for writing for the 1999 episode &quot;Hush&quot;. The 2001 episode &quot;The Body&quot; was nominated for a Nebula Award in 2002, and the fall 2001 musical episode &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; was nominated for a Best Dramatic Presentation Hugo Award and a Best Script Nebula Award. The final episode &quot;Chosen&quot; was nominated for a Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form Hugo Award in 2003. All written and directed by Whedon, they are considered some of the most effective and popular episodes of the series.

A. Asbjørn Jøn, an anthropologist and scholar, recognized that the series has shifted the way vampires have since been depicted in popular culture representations. Since the end of the series, Whedon has stated that his initial intention was to produce a &quot;cult&quot; television series and acknowledged a corresponding &quot;rabid, almost insane fan base&quot; that subsequently emerged. In June 2012, &quot;Slate&quot; identified it as the most written about popular culture text of all time. &quot;[M]ore than twice as many papers, essays, and books have been devoted to the vampire drama than any of our other choices—so many that we stopped counting when we hit 200&quot;.

Whedon, a lifelong comic book fan, authored the Dark Horse Comics miniseries &quot;Fray&quot;, which takes place in the far future of the Buffyverse. Like many writers of the show, he contributed to the series&#x27; comic book continuation, writing for the anthology &quot;Tales of the Slayers&quot;, and also for the main storyline of the miniseries &quot;Tales of the Vampires&quot;. Whedon and the other writers released a new ongoing series, taking place after the series finale &quot;Chosen&quot;, which he officially recognizes as the canonical eighth season. He returned to the world of &quot;Fray&quot; during the season eight-story arc &quot;Time of Your Life&quot;. &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine&quot; was published from August 2011 to September 2013, for which Whedon wrote &quot;Freefall, Part I–II&quot; (with Andrew Chambliss).

====&quot;Angel&quot;====
As a result of the success of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, Whedon was given the opportunity to make &quot;Angel&quot;, his 1999 spin-off series of the show. David Greenwalt and Whedon collaborated on the pilot which was going to be developed for The WB Network. During the series&#x27; early expansion, efforts were made by the network to mitigate Whedon&#x27;s original concept. &quot;Corrupt&quot;, a precociously optioned second episode, was entirely abandoned due to the gloominess written into the script. The tone was then softened in the opening episodes, establishing Angel Investigations as an idealistic, shoestring operation. It follows Angel, who works as a private detective in order to &quot;help the helpless&quot;.

Though praised for presenting a unique and progressive version of the archetypal noir hero as a sympathetic vampire detective, early in its run it was criticized as being lesser than its parent show, in the context of having devolved from a more popular original work. Despite that it won a Saturn Award for Best Network TV Series and three episodes, &quot;Waiting in the Wings&quot;, &quot;Smile Time&quot; and &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, were nominated for Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form in 2003 and 2005.

The WB Network announced on February 13, 2004, that &quot;Angel&quot; would not be brought back for a sixth season. Whedon said of the cancellation, &quot;I believe the reason &quot;Angel&quot; had trouble on The WB was that it was the only show on the network that wasn&#x27;t trying to be &quot;Buffy&quot;. It was a show about grown-ups&quot;. An official continuation of the story came later in the form of a comic book series. Following the successful eighth season of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, IDW Publishing approached Whedon about similarly producing a canonical sixth season for &quot;Angel&quot;. &quot;&quot; released 17 issues written by Whedon and Brian Lynch.

===2000s===
====&quot;Firefly&quot;====
Whedon followed &quot;Angel&quot; with the space western &quot;Firefly&quot;, starring Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin, Adam Baldwin, Jewel Staite, Sean Maher, Summer Glau and Ron Glass. Set in the year 2517, &quot;Firefly&quot; explores the lives of the people who while on the outskirts of society, make their living as the crew of &quot;Serenity&quot;, a &quot;Firefly-class&quot; spaceship. The series&#x27; original concept progressed after Whedon read &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;, a book on the Battle of Gettysburg.

An ever-present element was Whedon&#x27;s injection of anti-totalitarianism, writing into the show a historical analogy of the Battle of Gettysburg, the &quot;Battle of Serenity Valley&quot;. The beaten soldiers were called &quot;Browncoats&quot; after the brown dusters they wore as their uniforms. Whedon said, &quot;I wanted to play with that classic notion of the frontier: not the people who made history, but the people history stepped on—the people for whom every act is the creation of civilization&quot;. &quot;Firefly&quot; was written as a serious character study, encompassing what Whedon called &quot;life when it&#x27;s hard&quot;. He went on to elaborate that it was about &quot;nine people looking into the blackness of space and seeing nine different things&quot;.

Fox chose to play the episodes of the series out of order, running &quot;The Train Job&quot; first, and not airing the pilot until a dozen episodes later, resulting in some confusion from viewers. The series was also promoted as a comedy, not a science fiction drama, and placed in the infamous &quot;Friday night death slot&quot;. The show was praised by critics overall, but some objected to the fusion of American frontier and outer space motifs. Faced with these hurdles, the show had an average of 4.7 million viewers at the time and was ranked 98th in Nielsen ratings. The series was cancelled by Fox before all of the episodes had aired. Whedon took to Universal Pictures as a means of achieving a continuation of the story. Following &quot;Firefly&quot; was &quot;Serenity&quot;, a follow-up film taking place after the events of the final episode. &quot;Serenity&quot; developed into a franchise that led to graphic novels, books and other media. &quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine held a poll in 2005 to find &quot;The World&#x27;s Best Space Sci-Fi Ever&quot;, and &quot;Firefly&quot; and &quot;Serenity&quot; took first and second place, respectively. It also received an Emmy shortly after its cancellation, as well as a number of other awards. Since being canceled, &quot;Firefly&quot; has attained cult status.

====Marvel Comics====
In 2004, Whedon created the comic book line &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;. He finished a 24 issue run in 2008 and then handed over the reins as a writer to Warren Ellis. One storyline from the comic, the notion of a cure for mutation being found, was also an element in the third X-Men film, &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;. In February 2009 &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; #6, which depicted the return of Colossus to the title and concluded Whedon&#x27;s first story arc, was named by readers as #65 in Marvel&#x27;s Top 70 Comics of all time.

Taking over after series creator Brian K. Vaughan completed his run on the series, Whedon became the second writer of the Marvel comic &quot;Runaways&quot;. Having already been a committed reader, he had a letter published in the first volume, which was included in the Volume 1 hardcover edition. He also wrote short pieces for &quot;Stan Lee Meets Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men&quot; #1, and he was the subject of an issue of the comic book, &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot; (alongside artist Michael Lark). As part of a panel of writers, he contributed to Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Civil War&quot; crossover event lending advice on how to tell the story and also how to end it. In March 2016, Whedon contributed a story for the 75th anniversary issue of &quot;Captain America: Sam Wilson&quot; with &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; collaborator John Cassaday. He introduced several new characters into the Marvel Universe such as the villainous Ord, X-Men Ruth &quot;Blindfold&quot; Aldine and Hisako &quot;Armor&quot; Ichiki, Runaway Klara Prast, and Special Agent Abigail Brand along with S.W.O.R.D., the organization Brand commands.

====&quot;Serenity&quot;====
After Universal Pictures acquired the film and distribution rights from Fox, Whedon began writing the screenplay for &quot;Serenity&quot;. Transforming the series into a film, he says, &quot;... was the hardest piece of writing I&#x27;ve ever done ... It had to be self-contained and work as a movie, which meant I had to cope with problems like introducing nine main characters who&#x27;d already met!&quot; The script was based on unused story ideas for &quot;Firefly&quot;″s unfilmed second season. On writing the dialogue, Whedon felt that part of it came from &quot;getting to invent the language&quot;, which &quot;once I had... reads like a kind of poetry&quot;. The narrative centered on Captain Malcolm Reynolds as the hero accompanied by River Tam acting as the catalyst for what he does.

The score was composed by David Newman, and according to Whedon was intended to &quot;deglorify space — to feel the intimacy of being on a ship as opposed to the grandeur&quot;. He used two long steadicam shots for several minutes of the film&#x27;s opening sequence to establish &quot;a sense of safety in space&quot;. In 2006, it won a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form. The elements of science fiction that Whedon wanted to convey were essentially different in kind, and held &quot;a sort of grittiness&quot; and &quot;realism&quot;, which he said, together, &quot;get the most exciting kind of film-making&quot;. Critic Roger Ebert observed, &quot;Like &quot;Brave New World&quot; and &quot;1984&quot;, the movie plays like a critique of contemporary society, with the Alliance as Big Brother, enemy of discontent&quot;. The film received the 2005 Nebula Award for Best Script, the 2006 Prometheus Special Award, and was voted the best sci-fi movie of all time in a poll set up by &quot;SFX&quot; magazine. There have since been multiple rumors regarding sequel possibilities.

The limited three-issue comic book series called &quot;&quot;, the story of which was written by Whedon, was released in 2005 as a tie-in to &quot;Serenity&quot;. Set between &quot;Firefly&quot; and the film, it was intended to connect the two storylines. &quot;&quot; also spanned three issues and was written by Whedon and Brett Matthews. Whedon later co-wrote &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Tale&quot; with his half-brother Zack.

====Freelance directing and &quot;Sugarshock!&quot;====
As a guest director, he contributed two 2007 episodes of &quot;The Office&quot; (&quot;Business School&quot; and &quot;Branch Wars&quot;) and a 2010 episode of &quot;Glee&quot; (&quot;Dream On&quot;). Denoting this period, Whedon has said, &quot;I had free time, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I mean my career was on the skids&quot;.

In collaboration with Fábio Moon, Whedon created the free webcomic titled &quot;Sugarshock!&quot;, as part of the revival of &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot;, which was launched on Myspace. Whedon later executive produced another free comic book on the Internet, &quot;Serenity: The Other Half&quot;.

====&quot;Dr. Horrible&#x27;s Sing-Along Blog&quot;====

As a response to the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, Whedon directed, co-wrote and produced &quot;Dr. Horrible&#x27;s Sing-Along Blog&quot;. It tells the story of Dr. Horrible, an aspiring supervillain, who shares a love interest in a girl named Penny with his nemesis, Captain Hammer. To Whedon the miniseries was &quot;a project of love&quot;, an accomplishment that from their excitement would be embellished with passion and &quot;ridiculousness&quot;. His half-brothers Zack and Jed and sister-in-law Maurissa Tancharoen share the other writing credits. Whedon said it was a &quot;glorious surprise&quot; to him to discover how well they worked together.

After having attended meetings with companies discussing the prospect of producing something for the Internet and faced with negative feedback on his ideas, he realized that as long as the strike was still in progress, acquiring corporate funding was an unlikely prospect. Whedon himself funded the project investing just over $200,000 and earned more from it than he did directing &quot;The Avengers&quot;. He enjoyed the independence he gained from &quot;Dr. Horrible&#x27;s Sing-Along Blog&quot; as it provided him the freedom to include content without the expectancy of lessening it on behalf of the runtime. He and Jed composed the music, parts of which were influenced by Stephen Sondheim.

The miniseries was nominated and won numerous awards. Whedon was awarded Best Directing and Best Writing for a Comedy Web Series at the Streamy Awards, a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form, and a Creative Arts Emmy Award in 2009.

====&quot;Dollhouse&quot;====
In 2009, Whedon created his fourth television series, &quot;Dollhouse&quot;, and explored themes throughout the show that were initially present in an unproduced spec script of his called &quot;Afterlife&quot;. The series follows Echo, whose brain is programmed to accomplish various assignments, on her journey towards self-awareness. As stated by Whedon, &quot;Dollhouse&quot; was about &quot;the sides of us that we don&#x27;t want people to see&quot;, sexuality and, on some level, a celebration of perversion, which he equates to obsession, &quot;the thing that makes people passionate and interesting and worthy&quot;.

Despite low ratings in its first season, the series was renewed for a second and final season. The reason for the renewal given by Fox&#x27;s president of entertainment was to avoid any backlash that would have resulted from its cancelation. In reflection of Fox&#x27;s disruptive involvement, Whedon lamented the loss of ideas with identity and moral culpability, saying they were dancing around them in the process which then devolved the series into a procedural show.

===2010s===
====&quot;The Cabin in the Woods&quot;====
Whedon co-wrote and produced a horror-comedy film titled &quot;The Cabin in the Woods&quot; with director Drew Goddard, finishing production in 2009 though the film was not released until 2011. Whedon and Goddard intended to make a film that exemplified horror movies while still preserving the fun and frightening elements necessary to being a horror film. The script was written in three days and they produced a minimum of 15 pages a day. Whedon described it as an attempt to revitalize horror, calling it a &quot;loving hate letter&quot; to the genre, continuing:

Whedon thought part of what distinguished it from other horror films was that people were not disposable – &quot;As a culture, for our own entertainment, we tend to assume that they are (expendable)&quot;. He reiterated a sentiment that the introduction of torture porn into this genre was becoming an exercise in nihilism and misogyny as a means to promote distress and instead of trying to scare its audience.

====Marvel Studios====

In July 2010, it was confirmed that Whedon would write and direct &quot;The Avengers&quot;, a live-action adaptation of the superhero team of the same name.&lt;ref name=&quot;/Film; The Avengers&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Of his desire to take on the film, he explained that the core of the movie was about &quot;finding yourself from community&quot; and the togetherness derived from a group that ultimately doesn&#x27;t belong together.

It became the third-highest-grossing film of all time at the North American box office back in 2012, and it received considerable praise from critics. In retrospect, Whedon thought the film had &quot;imperfections&quot;, begrudging its quality in comparison to that of &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;. Nonetheless, he felt he &quot;pulled off&quot; the endeavor of making a summer movie reminiscent of those from his childhood.

In March 2012, Whedon stated that although television involves more compromise than film:

In August 2012, Whedon signed a deal to develop the Marvel TV show &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; for ABC. The series focuses on the secret military law-enforcement agency featured throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Created by Whedon, Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen, the show involves individuals who possess powers within the spectacle of science fiction, while also focusing on &quot;the peripheral people ... the people on the edges of the grand adventures.&quot; The character Phil Coulson was resurrected after his death in &quot;The Avengers&quot; to helm the show.

Whedon spoke about certain complications that factored in with making the show for Marvel, noting confusion between him and the company regarding the degree to which they wanted him to create it, citing their demand that he prioritize &quot;Avengers: Age of Ultron&quot;. He once expressed regrets for having brought back Phil Coulson, feeling that his death had lost meaning as a result, but later clarified that he did not regret this decision.

Whedon returned to write and direct the sequel to &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;&quot;, following the deal with Marvel Studios, which expired in June 2015. On the matter of approaching a sequel, Whedon reasoned not to go &quot;bigger&quot; but &quot;deeper&quot;, and likened it to digging with a scalpel to cause pain. He said of the film&#x27;s characters, &quot;Strong but damaged by power describes every person in this movie. It may, in fact, describe what the movie is about ... the more power that we have, the less human we are.&quot; Whedon discerns that &quot;Age of Ultron&quot; &quot;is an odd film&quot; that proved challenging when it came to finding the rhythm between both its calm and exciting moments. Drawing parallels to a symphony, he wanted to bring about &quot;grace in the middle of ultimate chaos&quot;.

Whedon also served as a creative consultant on the films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe leading up to &quot;Age of Ultron&quot;. He rewrote some dialogue for &quot;&quot;, directed the mid-credits scene of &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot;, and suggested that James Gunn make &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; &quot;weirder&quot; after reading an early draft. Whedon said it was unlikely that he would return to make another sequel, stating that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t imagine doing this again&quot;. He remarked that not having created his own fictional universe in over five years felt wrong and intended to use the proceeds made from &quot;Avengers: Age of Ultron&quot; for such ventures. In January 2016, Whedon announced that he will no longer work with Marvel. Marvel Studios CEO Kevin Feige would be cited in &quot;MCU: The Reign of Marvel Studios&quot;, released in October 2023, that he would never work again with Whedon.

====&quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;====
To create &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; in 2012, Whedon established Bellwether Pictures. He filmed it in black-and-white on digital video over a period of 12 days at his residence in Santa Monica, California. The film was scripted, produced, directed, edited and composed by Whedon, based on William Shakespeare&#x27;s play of the same name. His idea to adapt the play for the screen originated from having &quot;Shakespeare readings&quot; at his house with several of his friends, years prior. Despite the play&#x27;s comedy, he discovered that there were elements in the text &quot;of debauchery&quot; that brought out a core darkness, and said the visual nature of film influenced him to permeate a motif of sexuality into the script.

====&quot;In Your Eyes&quot; and &quot;Twist&quot;====

Whedon wrote and executive produced the paranormal romance film &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, the second feature by Bellwether Pictures. The film tells the story of Rebecca Porter and Dylan Kershaw, who can feel each other&#x27;s emotions but are ultimately strangers. Whedon&#x27;s script marked a theme of human connection as the metaphor for the couple&#x27;s mysterious link. He conceived the idea in the early 1990s, and had written drafts of the screenplay since then.

In summer 2014, Whedon encountered artist Shawnee Kilgore on Kickstarter. Whedon funded her album and when Kilgore contacted him about his fulfillment reward, he suggested they make a song together. She agreed, and the collaboration was later repurposed into producing an EP.

At the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con, Whedon announced &quot;Twist&quot;, which was described as a comic book about &quot;a Victorian female Batman&quot;.

In 2017, Whedon directed &quot;Unlocked&quot;, a short film in support of Planned Parenthood.

====&quot;Justice League&quot;====
In May 2017, Whedon took over post-production duties for &quot;Justice League&quot;, including writing and directing additional photography for the film. He received a co-writing credit for his contributions to the film, which was released in November 2017. Despite reshooting a majority of the film and largely changing the tone from what Zack Snyder had originally intended, Snyder retained sole credit as director of the film. After Snyder&#x27;s original cut was released in 2021, fans began to refer to the theatrical cut as the &quot;Whedon Cut&quot; and &quot;Josstice League&quot;.

===2020s===

====&quot;The Nevers&quot;====
On July 13, 2018, HBO announced that the network had obtained the rights to &quot;The Nevers&quot;, an &quot;epic science fiction drama about a gang of Victorian women who find themselves with unusual abilities, relentless enemies, and a mission that might change the world&quot;, on which Whedon was going to serve as writer, director, executive producer, and showrunner. Production on the series started in July 2019 in London, with scenes filmed at Trinity Church Square and the New Wimbledon Theatre area. By 2020, production was completed on five episodes before being shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, only resuming in September of that year to complete six of the season&#x27;s ten-episode order. On November 25, 2020, HBO announced that Whedon had exited the project.

==Accusations of workplace harassment==
In July 2020, &quot;Justice League&quot; actor Ray Fisher accused Whedon of showing &quot;gross, abusive, unprofessional, and completely unacceptable&quot; behavior toward the cast and crew of the film, going so far as to invite Whedon to sue him for slander if he believed the allegations were untrue. A virtual panel for the 2020 at-home San Diego Comic-Con focusing on Whedon&#x27;s work was cancelled following Fisher&#x27;s statements. The following month, it was reported that WarnerMedia had begun an investigation into Whedon&#x27;s behavior during the production of &quot;Justice League&quot;. Jason Momoa posted in support of Fisher, writing about &quot;the shitty way [they] were treated&quot; on &quot;Justice League&quot; reshoots and saying that &quot;serious stuff went down&quot;. In December 2020, WarnerMedia announced that its investigation had concluded and that &quot;remedial action&quot; had been taken.

Fisher also claimed that Whedon&#x27;s exit from the HBO Max series &quot;The Nevers&quot; was a result of HBO parent company WarnerMedia&#x27;s inquiry. He said on Twitter that &quot;I have no intention of allowing Joss Whedon to use the old Hollywood tactic of &#x27;exiting and claimed, &quot;This is undoubtedly a result of [the investigation].&quot; HBO had announced on November 25, 2020, that the company had &quot;parted ways&quot; with Whedon, and Whedon released his own statement, claiming the departure was due to the COVID-19 pandemic. HBO chief Casey Bloys declined to elaborate on the decision to part ways, but said HBO had received no complaints about Whedon&#x27;s behavior. Nonetheless, in what Bloys acknowledged was an unusual step, Whedon&#x27;s name has not been used in marketing for the series, though he remained credited in the series itself.

Gal Gadot told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in December 2020 that her experience with Whedon had not been &quot;the best&quot; but that she had taken it &quot;to the higher-ups and they took care of it&quot;. Grace Randolph later reported that Whedon had asked Gadot to film a sexually charged scene in &quot;Justice League&quot;, but that Gadot had refused and a body double was used in her place.

In February 2021, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; actress Charisma Carpenter alleged that Whedon had &quot;abused his power on numerous occasions&quot;, calling him a &quot;vampire&quot; and &quot;casually cruel&quot;. In a tweeted statement, Carpenter said that Whedon had called her &quot;fat&quot; and asked her &quot;if [she] was going to keep it&quot; upon learning of her pregnancy, mocked her religious faith, and repeatedly threatened to fire her, which he ultimately did. Carpenter also revealed that she had participated in WarnerMedia&#x27;s &quot;Justice League&quot; investigation.

&quot;Buffy&quot; co-stars Amber Benson and Michelle Trachtenberg corroborated Carpenter&#x27;s allegations. On social media, Benson wrote: &quot;&quot;Buffy&quot; was a toxic environment and it starts at the top. [Carpenter] is speaking truth&quot;. Trachtenberg wrote that &quot;we know what he did&quot; and alleged that his behavior toward her when she was a teenager was, &quot;Very. Not. Appropriate.&quot; Trachtenberg later stated on social media that there was a rule on set preventing Whedon from being in a room alone with her. &quot;Buffy&quot; star Sarah Michelle Gellar also lent her support and distanced herself from Whedon. Jose Molina, a writer on &quot;Firefly&quot;, also spoke out against Whedon&#x27;s behavior saying that &quot;casually cruel&quot; was a &quot;perfect&quot; description and that &quot;He thought being mean was funny. Making female writers cry during a notes session was especially hysterical. He actually liked to boast about the time he made one writer cry twice in one meeting.&quot; Other &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; costars voiced their support for the alleged victims including David Boreanaz, James Marsters, Anthony Stewart Head, Eliza Dushku, J. August Richards, and Amy Acker. Marsters said, however, that he thought that Whedon&#x27;s intensity toward the &quot;Buffy&quot; cast was because &quot;he put an enormous amount of pressure on himself ... trying to accomplish something that was a very high bar&quot;.

In April 2021, in light of Fisher&#x27;s accusations, Gadot told &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; that &quot;I had my issues with Whedon and Warner Bros handled it in a timely manner.&quot; A knowledgeable source stated that Gadot &quot;had multiple concerns with the revised version of the film, including issues about her character being more aggressive than her character in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;. She wanted to make the character flow from one movie to the next, the report said. &quot;The biggest clash, sources say, came when Whedon pushed Gadot to record lines she didn&#x27;t like, threatened to harm Gadot&#x27;s career and disparaged &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; director Patty Jenkins.&quot; The following month, Gadot added that Whedon &quot;threatened&quot; her career during the reshoots, saying, &quot;if I did something, he would make my career miserable and I just took care of it instead.&quot; In October of that year, Gadot went on to say that she was &quot;shocked&quot; by the way Whedon spoke to her, adding, &quot;You&#x27;re dizzy because you can&#x27;t believe this was just said to you. And if he says it to me, then obviously he says it to many other people.&quot;

In January 2022, Whedon claimed Gadot &quot;misunderstood&quot; him due to English not being her first language and called Fisher a &quot;bad actor in both senses&quot;. He also said he had never worked with &quot;a ruder group of people&quot; than the rest of the &quot;Justice League&quot; cast. Gadot responded to this by stating that she &quot;understood perfectly&quot; and would not work with Whedon again in the future.

In October 2023, screenwriter Zak Penn wrote in the book &quot;MCU: The Reign of Marvel Studios&quot; that during the process of writing the script for &quot;The Avengers&quot; and finding a director for the project, &quot;All the other directors we had been talking about, Joss wasn&#x27;t on the list. I heard he was going to rewrite the script himself. He didn&#x27;t even want to meet with me – which, by the way, I always call the writer I&#x27;m replacing. I feel like that&#x27;s courtesy.&quot; When Penn reached out to Whedon personally, &quot;He said to me, &#x27;No, it&#x27;s not awkward for me. I&#x27;m rewriting you.&#x27; It became pretty apparent that he had less than zero interest in, in any way, having me involved with the movie.&quot; Penn also called Whedon, &quot;a d*ck&quot; as well as &quot;a bad person.&quot;

==Unrealized projects==
Early in his career, Whedon sold two spec scripts that were not produced, &quot;Suspension&quot; and &quot;Afterlife&quot;. He sold &quot;Suspension&quot; for $750,000, with an additional $250,000 if production had commenced. In September 2014, &quot;Empire&quot; suggested the script was being made, with Liam Neeson attached to the project. In 1994, he sold &quot;Afterlife&quot; for $1.5 million, with an additional $500,000 if production had commenced. In 2000, Andy Tennant was in talks to direct and rewrite. In &quot;Afterlife&quot; there were precursors to themes Whedon would later explore in &quot;Dollhouse&quot;. The script was about Daniel Hoffstetter, a government scientist, who awakes after dying to discover his mind has been imprinted on a mind-wiped body.

Whedon had a number of planned &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; spinoffs that became stuck in development or terminally stalled. Among these were &quot;Buffy the Animated Series&quot;, a set of television movies for The WB based on &quot;Angel&quot; and &quot;Buffy&quot; characters, a Spike spin-off film, and &quot;Ripper&quot;, a proposed BBC pilot about Rupert Giles.

&quot;Goners&quot; was announced in 2005. According to &quot;Variety&quot; magazine, it was a fantasy thriller under development by Universal Pictures, and was to be produced by Mary Parent and Scott Stuber. From a 2006 interview with &quot;Fanboy Radio&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;ve been seeing a lot of horror movies that are torture porn, where kids we don&#x27;t care about are mutilated for hours, and I just cannot abide them... it&#x27;s an antidote to that very kind of film, the horror movie with the expendable human beings in it. Because I don&#x27;t believe any human beings are&quot;.

Whedon was hired to write and direct a Warner Bros. adaptation of &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;. However, in February 2007, Whedon announced that he would no longer be involved with the project. &quot;We just saw different movies, and at the price range this kind of movie hangs in, that&#x27;s never gonna work. Non-sympatico. [sic] It happens all the time&quot;. Conversely, he stated, &quot;the fact of the matter is, it was a waste of my time. We never [wanted] to make the same movie; none of us knew that&quot;. Whedon also pitched a screenplay to adapt Batman for the same company as development started on what would eventually become &quot;Batman Begins&quot;. It was described as having included a new, &quot;more of a &#x27;Hannibal Lecter&#x27; type&quot; villain, and portrayed Bruce Wayne as &quot;a morbid, death-obsessed kid&quot; whose grief was overcome by protecting a girl from being bullied in an alley similar to where his parents were murdered. In March 2017, Whedon was in negotiations to direct, write, and produce &quot;Batgirl&quot; set in the DC Extended Universe. He withdrew from the project in February 2018, saying he didn&#x27;t have a story for the movie.

The sequel to &quot;Dr. Horrible&#x27;s Sing-Along Blog&quot; has been shelved on multiple occasions. In 2009, Whedon remarked upon the possibility of presenting it in the form of another miniseries or a feature film. The script was planned to be written in summer 2012 and the principal photography to take place the following year. However, production was delayed because of his commitment to projects at Marvel Studios.

&quot;Wastelanders&quot;, a web-based &quot;end-of-the-world&quot; project, once in development with author Warren Ellis, was postponed due to Whedon&#x27;s preoccupation with &quot;The Avengers&quot;.

==Themes, style and influences==

Thematically, Whedon&#x27;s work often explores perspectives on existentialism, anti-authoritarianism, free will, power, powerlessness, sexuality, adulthood, sacrifice, atheism, misogyny and feminism. His projects usually revolve around an ensemble of protagonists, primarily focused on a loner hero who ends up working with others to accomplish a goal. He says of the recurring aspects of community, &quot;Everything I write tends to turn into a superhero team, even if I didn&#x27;t mean for it to. I always start off wanting to be solitary, because a) it&#x27;s simpler, and b) that isolation is something that I relate to as a storyteller. And then no matter what, I always end up with a team&quot;. Examining a typical motif, he says, &quot;I tend to write about people who are helpless or out of control who then regain or retake control&quot;.

Articulating his approach to screenwriting, Whedon has noted outlining and act structure as the hardest parts of storytelling, but emphasizes that he feels they are &quot;completely essential&quot;. Many of Whedon&#x27;s altered phrases and heavily popularized words have entered a common usage called &quot;Slayer Slang&quot;, which PBS included an entire section of in their article series &quot;Do You Speak American?&quot;. In an issue of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot;, where Buffy travels to the future, Whedon writes Buffy&#x27;s reaction to the future dialect of Manhattan; this allows Whedon to comment on the series&#x27; distinctive style of dialogue; &quot;Buffy blames herself for what&#x27;s happened to the English language, and there&#x27;s a lot of hubris in that joke. I like to think that adding Y&#x27;s to words that don&#x27;t usually have Y&#x27;s is going to destroy the whole fabric of our society&quot;. His use of self-aware dialogue to humanize characters, which relies heavily on dry humor and subtext, treating clichés subversively, using misogyny to define the trait of a villain, and the recurring theme of self-sacrifice led by subverting moral icons have been defining to his style of storytelling.

His penchant to kill off characters has been widely acknowledged. Whedon responded to the criticism, saying, &quot;The percentage of people who die... is a lot. I think it&#x27;s pretty near everybody. The percentage of people that I kill—not so many. I think the reason that my rep is so nasty is that I tend to do it... unexpectedly, or to someone people are recently invested in, and that is a real mission statement for me, because, death doesn&#x27;t leave a card. Death doesn&#x27;t take Hitler. It doesn&#x27;t work according to story plans, and when a death feels like a loss, gives you grief... then you have told a story that involves death.&quot; Dramatic effect is used to convey the sense of realism and shock value that comes from fatal circumstances.

Whedon has kept ambivalent on whether to shoot on film or digital video, saying that he has &quot;no allegiance to film as film. If the story is in front of me, I&#x27;m fine&quot;. In terms of visual aesthetics, he prefers to incorporate as many practical effects as possible when using computer-generated imagery, so people &quot;really don&#x27;t know where one begins and the other ends&quot;. On working with high or low budgets, he remarked that both offer &quot;the exact same job&quot; and whether one has $100 million or $100,000, &quot;you&#x27;re trying to hit someone in the gut with an emotional moment.&quot; Whedon determines that, although giving actors notes for guidance, he also aims to assuage their concerns when communicating the reasons and outcomes of a scene.

Whedon has cited Ray Bradbury, James Cameron, Rod Serling, William Shakespeare, Stephen Sondheim, Steven Spielberg, Charles Dickens, Stan Lee, Robert Klein, Jerome Robbins, Frank Borzage, Steve Gerber, Steven Bochco, Frances Hodgson Burnett and John Williams as influences. When asked about his five favorite films, Whedon listed &quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;, &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Magnolia&quot; and &quot;The Court Jester&quot;.

===Feminism===

Elements of feminism are present throughout much of Whedon&#x27;s work and he gives his mother credit for inspiring this. The character Kitty Pryde from the &quot;X-Men&quot; comics was an early model for Whedon&#x27;s strong teenage girl characters. He said, &quot;If there&#x27;s a bigger influence on Buffy than Kitty, I don&#x27;t know what it was. She was an adolescent girl finding out she has great power and dealing with it.&quot; Kitty Pryde later played a central role in Whedon&#x27;s run on &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;. In his 2006 Equality Now address, Whedon said that journalists frequently ask him why he writes such strong female characters. In his speech he provided several answers, concluding with, &quot;Because you&#x27;re still asking me that question.&quot;

In college, Whedon studied a theory called &quot;womb envy&quot;, a concept he says observes &quot;a fundamental thing that women have something men don&#x27;t, the obvious being an ability to bear children. Men not only don&#x27;t get what&#x27;s important about what women are capable of, but in fact they fear it, and envy it, and want to throw stones at it, because it&#x27;s the thing they can&#x27;t have.&quot; In 2007, Whedon expressed his outrage over the murder of Du&#x27;a Khalil Aswad, and because the act was caught on video, was prompted to attack the underlying attitude he felt led to the murder, comparing the video to torture porn.

In late 2013, Whedon spoke at an Equality Now event, where he issued a pointed dissection of the word &quot;feminist&quot;. He begins to say, &quot;I have the privilege living my life inside of words ... but part of being a writer is also living in the very smallest part of every word.&quot; Arguing against the suffix &quot;-ist&quot;, he continues, &quot;you can&#x27;t be born an –ist. It&#x27;s not natural.&quot; Whedon explains that because of this, the word &quot;includes the idea that believing men and women to be equal ... is not a natural state. That we don&#x27;t emerge assuming that everybody in the human race is a human. That the idea of equality is just an idea that&#x27;s imposed on us...&quot; This sparked an unfavorable reaction from the feminist community, but also an appreciation for Whedon&#x27;s arguments&#x27; thought provocation.

News website Digital Spy released in early 2015 an interview they had conducted with Whedon, during which he criticized the entertainment industry for its &quot;genuine, recalcitrant, intractable sexism, and old-fashioned quiet misogyny&quot;. Whedon exemplified &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; film series as an argument for female-led franchises, and hoped Marvel Studios would pursue production of more such franchises. However, critics noted an almost stereotypical lack of feminist ideals in his writing decisions and portrayal of Black Widow, one of two female protagonists in Marvel&#x27;s 2015 &quot;&quot;, played by Scarlett Johansson.

==Frequent collaborators==
Whedon has repeatedly hired the same actors for his projects and has been described as &quot;the gravitational center of the Whedonverse, a galaxy that spins recurring actors and themes through an orbital system of TV shows, films and comic books that all share similar traits: a unique brand of witty dialogue, relatable characters and fantasy/sci-fi mythology&quot;.

Note: Due to Whedon&#x27;s frequent casting of the same actors in various projects, the above list only includes those who have played two or more different roles in Whedon productions; actors that only played one role in multiple Whedon productions are not included. 

== Personal life ==
In 2013, Whedon said that he is a workaholic. This arose during the time that followed the completion of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, which was made in the span of a two-week vacation from &quot;The Avengers&quot;, and after making the pilot for &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; amidst the pre-production for &quot;Avengers: Age of Ultron&quot;. &quot;It is actually a problem. Sometimes it&#x27;s adorable ... and sometimes it&#x27;s not ... Not to get all dark and weird, but it is something I need to address.&quot; He has been a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in its Writers&#x27; branch since 2017.

===Marriages===
In 1995, Whedon married Kai Cole, an architect, producer and co-founder of Bellwether Pictures. They have two children together. Whedon and Cole separated in 2012 and divorced in 2016. In 2017, Cole claimed that Whedon had repeatedly been unfaithful to her and that he &quot;does not practice what he preaches&quot; in regard to feminism.

Whedon married Canadian artist Heather Horton in February 2021.

===Religious and philosophical views===
Whedon has identified himself as an atheist.
Whedon has identified as an absurdist and existentialist. A committed humanist, Whedon was presented with the Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism by the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard University in 2009. He has spoken about existentialism, explaining in detail how it, and more specifically Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s &quot;Nausea&quot;, was used as a basis for the &quot;Firefly&quot; episode &quot;Objects in Space&quot;. He called it &quot;the most important book&quot; he ever read, and said it was given to him right after he saw Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, whose impact, he recalls, had made him an existentialist.

===Political views===
In July 2012, at San Diego Comic-Con, in response to one woman who noted the anti-corporate themes in many of his films and asked him to give his economic philosophy in 30 seconds or less, Whedon spoke out against capitalism, saying that America is &quot;turning into Tsarist Russia&quot;.

Endorsing Barack Obama in the 2012 United States presidential election, Whedon satirically equated Mitt Romney&#x27;s future as president with a zombie apocalypse, quipping, &quot;Romney is ready to make the deep rollbacks in health care, education, social services and reproductive rights that will guarantee poverty, unemployment, overpopulation, disease, rioting—all crucial elements in creating a nightmare zombie wasteland.&quot;

In 2015, Whedon signed a petition as part of a political campaign calling for Elizabeth Warren to run for President of the United States.

In January 2017, after actress Nicole Kidman publicly suggested that America should accept that Donald Trump is president, Whedon tweeted a photograph of plastic puppet Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward alongside an image of Kidman, an action some interpreted as mocking and objectifying Kidman&#x27;s physical appearance. That same month, Whedon also received criticism for reportedly comparing Ivanka Trump to a dog and for wishing that Paul Ryan would be raped to death by a rhinoceros. Referring to Ivanka&#x27;s husband Jared Kushner and Trump, he tweeted: &quot;He&#x27;s a Voldemort in training, &amp; unlike the Pekingese he married under, can play the long game.&quot; Whedon stated that he had been referring to Donald Trump. In April 2017, Whedon took a shot at Republicans by criticizing the physical appearance of teenage cancer survivors who were visiting then–Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. He later apologized on Twitter.

<text>&quot;Lavender&#x27;s Blue&quot; (also called &quot;Lavender Blue&quot;) is an English folk song and nursery rhyme from the 17th century. Its Roud Folk Song Index number is 3483. It has been recorded in various forms and some pop versions have been hits in the U.S. and U.K. charts.

==Lyrics==
There are as many as thirty verses to the song, and many variations of each verse. A typical version, described by James Halliwell in 1849, is:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em;&quot;&gt;Lavender&#x27;s blue, dilly dilly, lavender&#x27;s green,
When I am king, dilly dilly, you shall be queen:
Who told you so, dilly dilly, who told you so?
&#x27;Twas mine own heart, dilly dilly, that told me so.

Call up your men, dilly dilly, set them to work,
Some with a rake, dilly dilly, some with a fork;
Some to make hay, dilly dilly, some to thresh corn,
Whilst you and I, dilly dilly, keep ourselves warm.

If you should die, dilly dilly, as it may hap,
You shall be buried, dilly dilly, under the tap;
Who told you so, dilly dilly, pray tell me why?
That you might drink, dilly dilly, when you are dry.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Origins==

The earliest surviving version of the song is in a broadside printed in England between 1672 and 1679, under the name &quot;Diddle Diddle, or The Kind Country Lovers&quot;. The broadside indicates it is to be sung to the tune of &quot;Lavender Green&quot;, implying that a tune by that name was already in existence. The lyrics printed in the broadside are fairly bawdy, celebrating sex and drinking.

According to Robert B. Waltz, &quot;The singer tells his lady that she must love him because he loves her. He tells of a vale where young man and maid have lain together, and suggests that they might do the same&quot;. Waltz cites Sandra Stahl Dolby as describing this broadside version as being about a girl named Nell keeping the singer&#x27;s bed warm.

Here is the first of ten verses:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em;&quot;&gt;Lavender&#x27;s green, diddle, diddle,
Lavender&#x27;s blue
You must love me, diddle, diddle,
cause I love you,
I heard one say, diddle, diddle,
since I came hither,
That you and I, diddle, diddle,
must lie together.&lt;/poem&gt;

Both Waltz (citing Eloise Hubbard Linscott) and Halliwell have noted the song&#x27;s association with Twelfth Night and the choosing of the king and queen of the festivities of that holiday.

&quot;Lavender&#x27;s Blue&quot; emerged as a children&#x27;s song in &quot;Songs for the Nursery&quot; in 1805 in the form:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em;&quot;&gt;Lavender blue and Rosemary green,
When I am king you shall be queen;
Call up my maids at four o&#x27;clock,
Some to the wheel and some to the rock;
Some to make hay and some to shear corn,
And you and I will keep the bed warm.&lt;/poem&gt;

Similar versions appeared in collections of rhymes throughout the 19th century.

A version of the song, titled &quot;Lavender Blue (Dilly Dilly)&quot;, was featured in the 1948 Walt Disney film &quot;So Dear to My Heart&quot;, where it was sung by Burl Ives. This version was nominated for Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1949. This version of the song was credited to Eliot Daniel (music) and Larry Morey (lyrics). &quot;Lavender Blue&quot; was one of 400 nominees for the American Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;100 Years...100 Songs&quot; list of the 100 greatest film songs, which was presented on a television program of that name which aired on June 22, 2004, but it didn&#x27;t make the final list. The appearance of &quot;Lavender Blue&quot; in the Disney film sparked a revival of interest in the song.

Ives&#x27; version of &quot;Lavender Blue&quot; was recorded in December 1948 and released as a single in January 1949. As was common for pop songs in those days, several other singers released versions at near the same time. Sammy Kaye also released a version in 1949, which charted at No. 5, as did Dinah Shore (her version went to No. 1 on the Australian chart and was the title track of her album &quot;Lavender Blue&quot;). Vera Lynn&#x27;s version of &quot;Lavender Blue&quot; was issued on the B side of her single &quot;Again&quot;, which reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine Best Seller chart on January 21, 1949.

===Later 20th century===
The Canadian author Kathleen Lines published a selection of classical nursery rhymes in 1954 under this title.

In 1959, Sammy Turner released a rhythm and blues version produced by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller which reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Benjamin Britten wrote &quot;Lavender&#x27;s Blue&quot; into his 1954 opera &quot;The Turn of The Screw&quot;, where it is sung by the two children, Miles and Flora.

In 1985, the British rock band Marillion included a song called &quot;Lavender&quot; on their album &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot;. The song had lyrics derived from &quot;Lavender&#x27;s Blue&quot; and became a number 5 hit on the UK singles chart.

<doc id="158088" wikidata="Q11622" url="?curid=158088" title="Firefly (TV series)">
<text>Firefly is an American space Western drama television series, created by writer and director Joss Whedon, under his Mutant Enemy Productions label. Whedon served as an executive producer, along with Tim Minear. The series is set in the year 2517, after the arrival of humans in a new star system, and follows the adventures of the renegade crew of &quot;Serenity&quot;, a &quot;&quot;Firefly&quot;-class&quot; spaceship. The ensemble cast portrays the nine characters living aboard &quot;Serenity&quot;. Whedon pitched the show as &quot;nine people looking into the blackness of space and seeing nine different things.&quot;

The show explores the lives of a group of people, some of whom fought on the losing side of a civil war, who make a living on the fringes of society as part of their star system&#x27;s pioneer culture. The two surviving superpowers, the United States and China, united to form the central federal government, called the Alliance. According to Whedon&#x27;s vision, &quot;Nothing will change in the future: Technology will advance, but we will still have the same political, moral, and ethical problems as today.&quot;

&quot;Firefly&quot; premiered in the United States on the Fox network on September 20, 2002. By mid-December, it had averaged 4.7 million viewers per episode and was 98th in Nielsen ratings. It was canceled after 11 of the 14 produced episodes were aired. Despite its short run, it received strong sales when it was released on DVD and has large fan support campaigns. It won a Primetime Emmy Award in 2003 for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series. &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked it No. 5 on their 2013 list of 60 &quot;shows that were canceled too soon&quot;.

The show&#x27;s post-airing success led Whedon and Universal Pictures to produce &quot;Serenity&quot;, a 2005 film that continues the story from the series. The &quot;Firefly&quot; franchise expanded into other media, including comics and two tabletop role-playing games.

== Premise ==

=== Backstory ===
The series takes place in the year 2517, on a variety of planets with numerous habitable moons. The TV series does not reveal whether these celestial bodies are within one star system, only saying that &quot;Serenity&quot;″s mode of propulsion through space is a &quot;gravity-drive&quot;. Each episode begins with either Book or Captain Reynolds providing the backstory. Book&#x27;s narration runs as follows:
The film &quot;Serenity&quot; reveals that the planets and moons are in an extensive system, and production documents related to the film indicate that there is no faster-than-light travel in this universe. The characters occasionally refer to &quot;Earth-that-was&quot;, and the film establishes that long before the events in the series, a large population had emigrated from Earth to a new star system in generation ships: &quot;Earth-that-was could no longer sustain our numbers, we were so many.&quot; The emigrants established themselves in this new star system, with &quot;dozens of planets and hundreds of moons&quot;, and many of these were terraformed, a process that was only the first step in making a planet habitable. The outlying settlements often did not receive support in the construction of their civilizations. This resulted in many border planets and moons having forbidding, dry environments, well-suited to the Western genre.

=== Synopsis ===
The show takes its name from the &quot;&quot;Firefly&quot;-class&quot; spaceship &quot;Serenity&quot; that the central characters call home. The &quot;Firefly&quot;-class ships, some 40,000 still in use, is so named for the resemblance to the shape of a firefly, complete with a tail section that lights up during acceleration, analogous to the bioluminescent insect&#x27;s abdomen. The &quot;Serenity&quot; was named for the Battle of Serenity Valley, where Sergeant Malcolm Reynolds and Corporal Zoe Alleyne were among the survivors on the losing side. It is revealed in &quot;Bushwhacked&quot; that the Independents&#x27; loss at the Battle of Serenity Valley was widely considered as sealing their fate.

The Alliance governs the star system through an organization of core planets, following its success in forcibly unifying all the colonies under one government. DVD commentary suggests that the Alliance is composed of two primary systems, one predominantly Western, the other pan-Asian, explaining the blended linguistic and visual themes of the series. The central planets are firmly under Alliance control, but the outlying planets and moons resemble the American Old West, under little governmental authority. Settlers and refugees on the outlying worlds have relative freedom from the central government but lack the amenities of high-tech civilization found on inner worlds. The outlying areas of space (&quot;the black&quot;) are inhabited by the Reavers, a cannibalistic group of nomadic humans.

The captain of &quot;Serenity&quot; is Malcolm &quot;Mal&quot; Reynolds (Nathan Fillion). The episode &quot;Serenity&quot; establishes that the captain and his first mate Zoe Washburne, née Alleyne (Gina Torres) are veteran &quot;Browncoats&quot; of the Unification War, a failed attempt by the outlying worlds to resist the Alliance. A later episode, &quot;Out of Gas&quot;, reveals that Mal bought the spaceship &quot;Serenity&quot; to travel increasingly distant reaches of space, beyond Alliance control. Much of the crew&#x27;s work consists of cargo runs or smuggling. In the original pilot, &quot;Serenity&quot;, Simon (Sean Maher) joins the crew as a paying passenger, smuggling his sister River Tam (Summer Glau) aboard as cargo. River is a child prodigy whose brain was subjected to Alliance scientists at a secret government institution; she displays symptoms of schizophrenia and often hears voices. It is later revealed that she is a &quot;reader&quot;, one who possesses telepathic abilities. Simon gave up a career as an eminent trauma surgeon in an Alliance hospital to rescue her, and they are fugitives. As Whedon states in an episode of a DVD commentary, every show he does is about creating a family. By the last episode, &quot;Objects in Space&quot;, the fractured character of River has finally become whole, partly because the others decided to accept her into their &quot;family&quot; on the ship.

=== Signature show elements ===
The show blends elements from the space opera and Western genres in a grounded depiction of humanity&#x27;s future. &quot;Firefly&quot; takes place in a multi-social future, primarily a fusion of Western and East Asian societies (and in particular those of mainland China), where there is gross class inequality. As a result of the Sino-American Alliance, Mandarin Chinese is a common second language; English-speaking characters in the show frequently curse in Mandarin.

The show features slang not used in contemporary culture, such as adaptations of modern words or new words. &quot;Shiny&quot; is frequently used as the real world slang &quot;cool&quot;, and &quot;gorram&quot; is used as a mild swear word. Written and spoken Chinese, as well as Old West dialect, are also employed. As one reviewer noted: &quot;The dialogue tended to be a bizarre purée of wisecracks, old-timey Western-paperback patois, and snatches of Chinese.&quot;

Tim Minear and Joss Whedon pointed out two scenes that articulated the show&#x27;s mood clearly: In the original pilot &quot;Serenity&quot; when Mal is eating with chopsticks with a Western tin cup by his plate; and in &quot;The Train Job&quot; pilot when Mal is thrown out of a holographic bar window. The DVD set&#x27;s &quot;making-of&quot; documentary explains the distinctive frontispiece of the series (wherein &quot;Serenity&quot; soars over a herd of horses) as Whedon&#x27;s attempt to capture &quot;everything you need to understand about the series in five seconds.&quot;

Whedon struggled with Fox over the tone of the show, and especially over the character of Malcolm Reynolds. Fox pressured Whedon to make Mal more &quot;jolly&quot;, as they feared he was too dark in the original pilot, epitomized by the moment he suggests he might &quot;space&quot; Simon and River, throwing them out of the airlock. Fox was unhappy that the show portrayed &quot;nobodies&quot; who &quot;get squished by policy&quot; instead of actual policymakers.

== Cast ==
=== Main ===
&quot;Firefly&quot; maintained an ensemble cast that portrayed nine crew members and passengers of the ship, &quot;Serenity&quot;, dealing with criminals and schemers, Alliance security forces, the utterly psychotic and brutal Reavers, and the mysterious men with &quot;hands of blue&quot;—operatives of a secret agency possibly aligned with The Blue Sun Corporation. The crew is driven by the need to secure enough income to keep their ship operational while keeping a low profile to avoid their adversaries. Their situation is complicated by the differing motivations of the individuals aboard &quot;Serenity;&quot; the show&#x27;s brief run hampered further characterization.

All nine of the main characters appeared in every episode, except &quot;Ariel&quot;, from which Book is absent.
* Nathan Fillion as Malcolm &quot;Mal&quot; Reynolds—the owner and captain of &quot;Serenity&quot; and former Independent sergeant in the Battle of Serenity Valley. Malcolm grew up on a ranch and was raised by his mother and the ranch hands. In the Unification War, he fought as a platoon sergeant in the 57th Overlanders of the Independent Army, the &quot;Browncoats&quot;. He is a cunning, capable leader, and a skilled fighter. Mal&#x27;s primary motivation is a desire for independence. While he is not above petty theft, smuggling, or even killing to maintain his freedom, he is generally honest in his dealings with others, fiercely loyal to his crew, and adheres to a personal code of honor. He is openly antagonistic toward religion as a result of his experiences during the war.
* Gina Torres as Zoe Alleyne Washburne—second-in-command onboard &quot;Serenity&quot;, a loyal wartime friend of Captain Reynolds, and Wash&#x27;s wife. Her surname during the Unification War was Alleyne. She was born and raised on a ship and served under Mal during the war as a corporal. Described by her husband as a &quot;warrior woman&quot;, she is a capable fighter who keeps calm even in the most dangerous situations. She demonstrates an almost unconditional loyalty to Mal. The only exception noted being her marriage to Wash, which the captain claims was against his orders.
* Alan Tudyk as Hoban &quot;Wash&quot; Washburne—&quot;Serenity&quot;″s pilot and Zoe&#x27;s husband. Deeply in love with his wife, Wash expresses jealousy over his wife&#x27;s &quot;war buddy&quot; relationship and unconditional support of their captain, most particularly in the episode &quot;War Stories&quot;, in which he confronts Mal even as the two of them are being tortured. He joined pilot training just to see the stars, which were invisible from the surface of his polluted homeworld, and he joined &quot;Serenity&quot; despite being highly sought after by other ships. He is light-hearted and tends to make amusing comments, despite the severity of any situation.
* Morena Baccarin as Inara Serra—a Companion, which is the 26th century cross between a geisha, and a courtesan or mistress; she rents and works out of one of &quot;Serenity&quot;″s two small shuttles. As a Companion, Inara enjoys high social standing. Her presence confers a degree of legitimacy and social acceptance that the crew of &quot;Serenity&quot; would not have without her on board. Inara displays great dignity, civility, and compassion. There is strong romantic tension between her and Mal, who share many character traits, but each frequently objects to the other&#x27;s work as &quot;whoring&quot; or &quot;petty theft&quot;, respectively. Both refuse to act on their feelings and attempt to keep their relationship professional.
* Adam Baldwin as Jayne Cobb—a mercenary who first met Mal on the opposite side of a dispute: Mal, while held at gunpoint by Jayne, offered Jayne his own bunk and a higher cut than his current employer, prompting Jayne to switch sides and shoot his then-partners. In the original pilot, &quot;Serenity&quot;, he tells Mal that he did not betray him because &quot;The money wasn&#x27;t good enough.&quot; However, he had previously showed reluctance in betraying the captain to an Alliance agent. In &quot;Ariel&quot;, he defends betraying Simon and River by claiming he had not intended to betray Mal. He can be depended on in a fight. Occasional hints of intelligence peek through his oafish façade, giving the impression that he acts dumber than he is. Whedon has stated several times that Jayne will ask the questions that no one else wants to. Even though he is a macho character, he has shown a particularly intense fear of Reavers, more so than the rest of the crew. He sends a significant portion of his income to his mother, again suggesting that there is more to his character than what he presents to the rest of the crew.
* Jewel Staite as Kaywinnet Lee &quot;Kaylee&quot; Frye—the ship&#x27;s mechanic. In the episode &quot;Out of Gas&quot;, Kaylee reveals she&#x27;s had no formal training, but keeps &quot;Serenity&quot; running with an intuitive gift for the workings of mechanical equipment. Jewel Staite describes Kaylee&#x27;s character as being wholesome, sweet, and &quot;completely genuine in that sweetness&quot;, adding &quot;She loves being on that ship. She loves all of those people. And she is the only one who loves all of them incredibly genuinely.&quot; She has a crush on Simon Tam. Kaylee is the heart of the ship; according to creator Joss Whedon, if Kaylee believes something, it is true.
* Sean Maher as Simon Tam—a trauma surgeon of the first caliber (ranked top 3% in his class at a top core-planet institution), who is on the run after breaking his sister River out of a government research facility. The episode &quot;Safe&quot;, reveals that he and River had a privileged upbringing with access to the best education. By rescuing River in spite of his father&#x27;s severe objections, Simon gave up a highly successful future in medicine. His bumbling attempts at a romantic relationship with Kaylee are a recurring subplot throughout the series. At every turn, he unwittingly foils his attempts at romance. His life is defined by caring for his sister.
* Summer Glau as River Tam—smuggled onto the ship by her brother. She is a brilliant, compassionate, and intuitive child prodigy. Experiments and invasive brain surgery at an Alliance secret facility left her delusional, paranoid, and at times violent—though her uncanny ability to seemingly sense things before they happen leaves questions as to where the delusions end and reality begins. The experiments seem to have made her a psychic. The experiments also gave her an innate knack for hand-to-hand combat, and she is capable of killing or incapacitating several opponents with ease. She gets frequent fits of anxiety and experiences post-traumatic flashbacks of her time in the Alliance facility. Her mental instability and uncanny abilities, paired with several erratic and violent acts, are a recurring source of fear and doubt among the crew, especially with Jayne, whom she once slashed with a knife. Jayne frequently requests that River and Simon be taken off the ship.
* Ron Glass as Derrial Book—a Shepherd (equivalent to a pastor). Although presented as a devout Christian, Book has profound, unexplained knowledge about criminal activities, police corruption, and military strategy, tactics, and weapons. In &quot;Safe&quot;, he was shown to have sufficient status in the Alliance to receive emergency medical treatment from an Alliance ship. He is also proficient in hand-to-hand combat and the use of firearms. He maintains his objection to violence even during a rescue mission, joining the fight while stating that although the Bible specifically disallows killing, it is &quot;somewhat fuzzier on the subject of kneecaps.&quot; Book is a moral guide for Mal and the rest of the crew, a voice of reason, conscience, and spirituality. He also gets along well with the amoral mercenary Jayne, with the two spotting each other while working out using a bench press. His hidden backstory would have been gradually revealed had the series continued but was instead explored in the 2010 comic book &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

Despite the series&#x27; short run, several recurring characters emerged from the inhabitants of the &quot;Firefly&quot; universe:
* Mark Sheppard as Badger—an established smuggling middleman on the planet Persephone. He provided jobs for &quot;Serenity&quot; on at least two occasions. In the DVD commentary for the episode &quot;Serenity&quot;, it was revealed that this part was initially written with Whedon himself playing the role. Badger appeared in the original pilot &quot;Serenity&quot; and in &quot;Shindig&quot;, with a return in the comic book series &quot;&quot;.
* Michael Fairman as Adelai Niska—a criminal with a reputation for violent reprisals, including severe, prolonged torture against those who fail him or even irritate him. He appeared in &quot;The Train Job&quot; and &quot;War Stories&quot;.
* Christina Hendricks as &quot;Saffron&quot;—a con artist whose real name is unknown. She first appeared in the episode &quot;Our Mrs. Reynolds&quot; as Mal&#x27;s involuntarily acquired wife. She has a habit of marrying her marks in the process of scamming them. She returns in the episode &quot;Trash&quot;, where Mal jokingly addresses her as &quot;YoSaffBridge&quot;, from the three of her aliases known within the show: &quot;Yolanda&quot;, &quot;Saffron&quot;, and &quot;Bridget&quot;.
* Jeff Ricketts and Dennis Cockrum as &quot;The Hands of Blue&quot;–two unnamed men wearing suits and blue gloves who pursue River, apparently to return her to the institute from which she escaped, as shown in &quot;The Train Job&quot;, &quot;Ariel&quot;, and the &quot;Serenity: Those Left Behind&quot; comic. They kill anyone, including Alliance personnel, who had contact with her, using a mysterious hand-held device that causes fatal hemorrhaging in anyone at whom it is aimed. River, during anxiety attacks or psychological meltdowns, has repeated the phrase &quot;Two by two/hands of blue&quot; in a way that resembles poetic meter. This suggests that River has had close experience(s) with them.

== Production ==

=== Origin ===
Whedon developed the concept for the show after reading &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; by Michael Shaara chronicling the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War. He wanted to follow people who had fought on the losing side of a war, their experiences afterward as pioneers and immigrants on the outskirts of civilization, much like the post-American Civil War era of Reconstruction and the American Old West. He intended the show to be &quot;a &quot;Stagecoach&quot; kind of drama with a lot of people trying to figure out their lives in a bleak pioneer environment&quot;. Whedon wanted to develop a show about the tactile nature of life, a show where existence was more physical and more difficult. Whedon also read a book about Jewish partisan fighters in World War II. Whedon wanted to create something for television that was more character-driven and gritty than most modern science fiction. Television science fiction, he felt, had become too pristine and rarefied. Whedon wanted to give the show a name that indicated movement and power and felt that &quot;Firefly&quot; had both. This powerful word&#x27;s relatively insignificant meaning, Whedon felt, added to its allure. He eventually created a ship in the image of a firefly.

=== Format ===
During the pilot episode filming, Whedon was still arguing with Fox that the show should be displayed in widescreen format. Whedon filmed scenes with actors on the edge of both sides so that they could only be shown in widescreen. This led to a few scenes on the DVD (and later Blu-ray) where objects or setups that were not visible in the original 4:3 broadcasts were displayed—such as the scene in the pilot where Wash mimes controlling the ship with a non-existent yoke. The Fox executives rejected the pilot, who felt that it lacked action and that the captain was too &quot;dour&quot;. They also disliked a scene in which the crew backed down to a crime boss since the scene implied the crew was &quot;being nothing&quot;. Fox told Whedon on a Friday afternoon that he had to submit a new pilot script on Monday morning or the show would not be picked up. Whedon and Tim Minear closeted themselves for the weekend to write what became the new pilot, &quot;The Train Job&quot;. At the direction of Fox, they added &quot;larger than life&quot; characters such as the henchman &quot;Crow&quot; and the &quot;hands of blue&quot; men, who also introduced an &quot;X-Files&quot;-type ending.

For the new pilot, Fox made it clear that they would not air the episodes in widescreen. Whedon and company felt they had to &quot;serve two masters&quot; by filming widescreen for eventual DVD release but keeping objects in-frame so it could still work when aired in pan and scan full frame. To obtain an immersive and immediate feel, the episodes were filmed in a documentary style with hand-held cameras, giving them the look of &quot;found footage&quot;, with deliberately mis-framed and out-of-focus subjects. As Whedon related: &quot;don&#x27;t be arch, don&#x27;t be sweeping—be found, be rough and tumble and docu[mentary] and you-are-there&quot;. Computer-generated scenes mimicked the motion of a hand-held camera; the style was not used when shooting scenes that involved the central government, the Alliance. Tracking and steady cameras were used to show the sterility of this aspect of the &quot;Firefly&quot; universe. Another style employed was lens flares harking back to 1970s television. The need for this particular style resulted in the director of photography (David Boyd) favoring cheaper lenses over cutting-edge equipment. &quot;Firefly&quot; portrays space as silent, as sounds cannot be transmitted in the vacuum of space.

=== Set design ===
Production designer Carey Meyer built the ship &quot;Serenity&quot; in two parts (one for each level) as a complete set with ceilings and practical lighting installed, as part of the set that the cameras could use along with moveable parts. The two-part set also allowed the second unit to shoot in one section while the actors and first unit worked undisturbed in the other. As Whedon recalled: &quot;you could pull it away or move something huge so that you could get in and around everything. That meant the environment worked for us and there weren&#x27;t a lot of adjustments that needed to be made&quot;. This design allowed the viewers to feel they were really in a ship. For Whedon, the design of the ship was crucial in defining the known space for the viewer and that there were not &quot;fourteen hundred decks and a holodeck and an all-you-can-eat buffet in the back.&quot; He wanted to convey that it was utilitarian and &quot;beat-up but lived-in. Ultimately, it was home.&quot; Each room represented a feeling or character, usually conveyed by the paint color. He explains that the colors and mood progress from extremely warm to cooler, as you move from the back of the ship in the engine room, toward the front of the ship to the bridge. Besides evoking a mood associated with the character who spends the most time in each area, the color scheme also alludes to the heat generated in the ship&#x27;s tail. Whedon was keen on using vertical space; having the crew quarters accessible by ladder was important. The set design allowed the actors to stay in the moment and interact, without having to stop after each shot and set up for the next, helping contribute to the documentary style Whedon aimed for.

The set had several influences, including the sliding doors and tiny cubicles reminiscent of Japanese hotels. Artist Larry Dixon has noted that the cargo bay walls are &quot;reminiscent of interlaced, overlapping Asian designs, cleverly reminding us of the American-Chinese Alliance setting while artistically forming a patterned plane for background scale reference.&quot; Dixon has also remarked on how the set design contributed to the storytelling through the use of color, depth, composition, lighting, as well as its use of diagonals and patterned shadows.

Their small budget was another reason to use the ship for much of the storytelling. When the characters did leave the ship, the worlds all had Earth atmosphere and coloring because the production team could not afford to design alien worlds. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to go to Yucca Flats every other episode and transform it into Bizarro World by making the sky orange&quot;, recalled Whedon. As Meyer recalled: &quot;I think in the end the feel was that we wound up using a lot of places or exteriors that just felt too Western and we didn&#x27;t necessarily want to go that way; but at some point, it just became the lesser of two evils—what could we actually create in three days?&quot;

=== Music ===

Greg Edmonson composed the musical score for the series. He stated that he wrote for the emotion of the moment. A reviewer stated that he also wrote for the characters: &quot;Edmonson has developed a specialized collection of musical symbolism for the series.&quot; To help illustrate the collection, the reviewer gave leitmotifs, or &quot;signatures&quot;, various names, noting that &quot;Serenity&quot; recalls the theme of the show and is used when they return to the ship, or when they were meeting in secret; it was &quot;the sound of their home&quot;. The slide guitar and fiddle used in this piece are portable instruments that fit the lifestyle of the crew: &quot;the music they make calls up tunes played out in the open, by people who were hundreds of miles away yesterday. &#x27;Serenity&#x27; conjures the nomadic lifestyle the crew leads and underlines the western aspect of the show.&quot; Another emotional signature was &quot;Sad Violin&quot; used at the end of the Battle of Serenity Valley but also to set up the joke when Mal tells Simon that Kaylee is dead in the episode &quot;Serenity&quot;. The most memorable use of &quot;Sad Violin&quot; is at the end of &quot;The Message&quot;, when the crew mourned the death of Tracey. This was also the last scene of the last episode the actors shot, and so this was seen by them and Edmonson, as &quot;Firefly&quot; farewell. To denote danger, &quot;Peril&quot; was used, which is &quot;a low pulse, like a heartbeat, with deep chimes and low strings&quot;. The reviewer also noted character signatures. The criminal Niska has a signature: Eastern European or Middle Eastern melodies over a low drone. Simon and River&#x27;s signature was a piano played sparsely with a violin in the background. This contrasts with the portable instruments of &quot;Serenity&quot;: the piano is an instrument that cannot be easily moved and evokes the image of &quot;the distant house and family they both long for.&quot; The signatures were mostly established in the first pilot, &quot;Serenity&quot;, and helped enhance the narrative.

Whedon&#x27;s use of music in his television shows has been regarded as &quot;filmic&quot;, as during pivotal moments the music reminds viewers of earlier events, resulting in a tighter continuity throughout the season.

The musical score expressed the social fusion depicted in the show. Cowboy guitar blended with Asian influence produced the atmospheric background for the series. As one reviewer stated: 

The show&#x27;s theme song, &quot;The Ballad of Serenity&quot;, was written by Joss Whedon and performed by Sonny Rhodes. Whedon wrote the song before the series was greenlit, and a preliminary recording performed by Whedon can be found on the DVD release. The soundtrack to the series was released on CD on November 8, 2005, by Varèse Sarabande. Fox Music released a 40-minute soundtrack in September 2005 as a digital EP. &quot;The Ballad of Serenity&quot; was used by NASA as the wake-up song for astronaut Robert L. Behnken and the other crewmembers of STS-130 on February 12, 2010.

=== Casting ===
The series was picked up in December 2001, and casting started in January 2002. In casting his nine-member crew, Whedon looked first at the actors and considered their chemistry with others. Cast member Sean Maher recalls, &quot;So then he just sort of put us all together, and I think it was very quick like right out of the gate, we all instantly bonded.&quot; All nine cast members were chosen before filming began; while making the original pilot &quot;Serenity&quot;, Whedon decided that Rebecca Gayheart was unsuitable for the role of Inara Serra, and shot her scenes in singles so that it would be easier to replace her. Morena Baccarin auditioned for the role and two days later was on the set in her first television show. &quot;Joss brought me down from the testing room like a proud dad, holding my hand and introducing me&quot;, Baccarin recalled.

Whedon approached Nathan Fillion to play the lead role of Malcolm Reynolds; after Whedon explained the premise and showed him the treatment for the pilot, Fillion was eager for the role. Fillion was called back several times to read for the part before he was cast. He noted that &quot;it was really thrilling. It was my first lead, and I was pretty nervous, but I really wanted that part, and I wanted to tell those stories.&quot; Fillion later said he was &quot;heartbroken&quot; when he learned the series had been canceled. Fillion has called his time on &quot;Firefly&quot; the best acting job he ever had, and compares every job he has had to it.

Alan Tudyk applied through a casting office and several months later was called in for an audition, where he met with Whedon. He was called back to test with two candidates for the role of Zoe (Wash&#x27;s wife) and was told that it was down to him and one other candidate. The Zoes he tested with were not selected (Gina Torres eventually received the role), and Tudyk was sent home but received a call informing him he had the part anyway. His audition tape is included in the special features of the DVD release.

Gina Torres, a veteran of several science fiction/fantasy works (&quot;Cleopatra 2525&quot;, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, &quot;Alias&quot;, &quot;&quot;), was at first uninterested in doing another science fiction show but &quot;was won over by the quality of the source material&quot;. As she recalled, &quot;you had these challenged characters inhabiting a challenging world, and that makes for great storytelling. And no aliens!&quot;

For Adam Baldwin, who grew up watching westerns, the role of Jayne Cobb was particularly resonant.

Canadian actress Jewel Staite videotaped her audition from Vancouver and was asked to come to Los Angeles to meet Whedon, at which point she was cast for the role of Kaylee Frye, the ship&#x27;s engineer. She was asked to put on weight for the role.

Sean Maher recalls reading for the part and liking the character of Simon Tam, but that it was Whedon&#x27;s personality and vision that &quot;sealed the deal&quot; for him. Neil Patrick Harris also read for the part of Simon.

For the role of Simon&#x27;s sister, River Tam, Whedon called in Summer Glau for an audition and test the same day. Glau had first worked for Whedon in the &quot;Angel&quot; episode &quot;Waiting in the Wings&quot;. Two weeks later, Whedon called her to tell her she had the part.

Veteran television actor Ron Glass has said that until &quot;Firefly&quot;, he had not experienced or sought a science-fiction or western role. Still, he fell in love with the pilot script and the character of Shepherd Book.

=== Production staff ===
Whedon selected Tim Minear to be the show runner, who serves as the head writer and production leader. According to Whedon, &quot;[Minear] understood the show as well as any human being, and just brought so much to it that I think of it as though he were always a part of it.&quot; Many of the other production staff were people Whedon had worked with in the past, except the director of photography David Boyd, who was the &quot;big find&quot; and who was &quot;full of joy and energy&quot;.

The writers were selected after interviews and script samplings. Among the writers were José Molina, Ben Edlund, Cheryl Cain, Brett Matthews, Drew Z. Greenberg and Jane Espenson. Espenson wrote an essay on the writing process with Mutant Enemy Productions. A meeting is held and an idea is floated, generally by Whedon, and the writers brainstorm to develop the central theme of the episode and the character development. Next, the writers (except the one working on the previous week&#x27;s episode) meet in the anteroom to Whedon&#x27;s office to begin breaking the story into acts and scenes. One of the key components to devising acts for the team is deciding where to break for commercial and ensuring the viewer returns. &quot;Finding these moments in the story help give it shape: think of them as tentpoles that support the structure.&quot; For instance, in &quot;Shindig&quot;, the break for commercial occurs when Malcolm Reynolds is gravely injured and losing the duel. &quot;It does not end when Mal turns the fight around when he stands victorious over his opponent. They&#x27;re both big moments, but one of them leaves you curious, and the other doesn&#x27;t.&quot;

Next, the writers develop the scenes onto a marker-filled whiteboard, featuring &quot;a brief ordered description of each scene&quot;. A writer is selected to create an outline of the episode&#x27;s concept—occasionally with some dialogue and jokes—in one day. The outline is given to showrunner Tim Minear, who revises it within a day. The writer uses the revised outline to write the first draft of the script while the other writers develop the next. This first draft is usually submitted for revision within three to fourteen days; afterward, a second and sometimes third draft is written. After all modifications are made, the final draft would be produced as the &quot;shooting draft&quot;.

=== Costume ===
Jill Ohanneson, &quot;Firefly&quot;″s original costume designer, brought on Shawna Trpcic as her assistant for the pilot. When the show was picked up, Ohanneson was involved in another job and declined &quot;Firefly&quot;, suggesting Trpcic for the job.

The costumes were chiefly influenced by World War II, the American Civil War, the American Old West, and 1861 samurai Japan. Trpcic used deep reds and oranges for the main cast to express a feeling of &quot;home&quot; and contrasted that with grays and cool blues for the Alliance. Since the characters were often getting shot, Trpcic would make up to six versions of the same costume for multiple takes.
* For River, mostly jewel tones were used to set her apart from the rest of the &quot;Serenity&quot; crew. River had boots to contrast with the soft fabrics of her clothes, &quot;because that&#x27;s who she is—she&#x27;s this soft, beautiful, sensitive girl, but with this hardcore inner character&quot;, recalled Trpcic.
* The designers also wanted to contrast Simon, River&#x27;s brother, with the rest of the crew. Whereas they were dressed in cotton, Simon wore wool, stiff fabrics, satins, and silk. He was originally the &quot;dandy&quot;, but as the show progressed, he loosened up slightly.
* For Kaylee, Trpcic studied Japanese and Chinese youth, as originally the character was Asian. Other inspirations for Kaylee&#x27;s costumes were Rosie the Riveter and Chinese Communist posters.
* Inara&#x27;s costumes reflect her high status and are very feminine and attractive.
* Trpcic designed and created the clothes for the minor character of Badger with Joss Whedon in mind since he intended to play that part. When Mark Sheppard played the role instead, he could fit into the clothes made for Whedon.
* For the Alliance, besides the grays and cool blues, Trpcic had in mind Nazi Germany, but mixed it with different wars, as the first sketches were &quot;too Nazi&quot;. The uniforms of the Alliance soldiers are from the 1997 film &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;.
* In the commentary for the pilot episode, Whedon points out that &quot;bad guys wear hats, good guys don&#x27;t.&quot;

=== Unproduced episodes ===
Since the cancellation of the series, various cast and crew members have revealed details they had planned for the show&#x27;s future:
* Alan Tudyk had the idea for an episode about a planet that is always day on one side and night on the other. On the night side, Jayne accidentally spills a type of pheromone on himself and the crew, which attracts many dogs. The crew is chased back to the ship by these dogs. There River uses her mind powers to domesticate the dogs.
* Adam Baldwin wanted to make an episode in which Jayne goes up against Mal as captain of his ship.
* Tim Minear revealed the secret of Inara&#x27;s syringe, as seen in the pilot episode; she is infected with a deadly disease. There would have been an episode where Reavers gang-rape her. Because she injected herself with the syringe, all of the Reavers on the ship die.
* According to Nathan Fillion, there was an episode in which the crew land on a dying planet. The inhabitants try to steal &quot;Serenity&quot; after explaining to the crew about their need to get off the planet. The problem is that unless they were to run into another ship along the way, with the extra passengers, &quot;Serenity&quot; would not have enough fuel and oxygen to make it to the closest destination. While everyone else is asleep, Mal takes the ship himself and discovers that help would never have arrived.

== Broadcast history ==
&quot;Firefly&quot; consists of a two-hour pilot and thirteen one-hour episodes (with commercials). The series originally premiered in the United States on Fox in September 2002 on Friday nights. Three episodes, including the original pilot, were aired out of the production order. Although Whedon had designed the show to run for seven years, low ratings resulted in cancellation by Fox in December 2002 after only 11 of the 14 completed episodes aired in the United States. The three episodes unaired by Fox eventually debuted in 2003 on the Sci Fi Channel in the United Kingdom. Prior to cancellation, some fans, worried about low ratings, formed the online &quot;Firefly&quot; Immediate Assistance campaign whose goal was to support the production of the show by sending in postcards to Fox. After it was canceled, the campaign worked on getting another network such as UPN to pick up the series. The campaign was unsuccessful in securing the show&#x27;s continuation.

&quot;The A.V. Club&quot; cited several actions by the Fox network that contributed to the show&#x27;s failure, most notably airing the episodes out of sequence, making the plot more difficult to follow. The double episode &quot;Serenity&quot; was intended as the premiere, and therefore contained most of the character introductions and back-story. Fox decided that &quot;Serenity&quot; was unsuitable for opening the series, and &quot;The Train Job&quot; was specifically created to act as a new pilot. In addition, &quot;Firefly&quot; was promoted as an action-comedy rather than the more serious character study it was intended to be, and the showbiz trade paper &quot;Variety&quot; noted Fox&#x27;s decision to occasionally preempt the show for sporting events.

Fox remastered the complete series in 1080i high-definition for broadcast on Universal HD, which began in April 2008.

On March 12, 2009, the series was the winner of the first annual Hulu awards in the category &quot;Shows We&#x27;d Bring Back&quot;.

The Science Channel began airing the series on March 6, 2011. All episodes aired in the intended order, including episodes &quot;Trash&quot;, &quot;The Message&quot; and &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;, which were not aired in the original Fox series run. Along with each episode, Dr. Michio Kaku provided commentary about the real-life science behind the show&#x27;s science fiction.

== Home media releases ==
A box set containing the 14 completed episodes (including those which had not yet aired in the United States) was released on region 1 DVD on December 9, 2003; region 2 on April 19, 2004; and region 4 on August 2, 2004. The box features the episodes in the original order in which the show&#x27;s producers had intended them to be broadcast, as well as seven episode commentaries, outtakes, and other features. The DVDs feature the episodes as they were shot in 16:9 widescreen, with anamorphic transfers and Dolby Surround audio. By September 2005, its DVD release had sold about 500,000 copies.

The series was re-released on Blu-ray Disc on November 11, 2008, comprising three discs; exclusive extras to the Blu-ray release include extra audio commentary from Joss Whedon, Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk, and Ron Glass for the episode &quot;Our Mrs. Reynolds&quot;; as well as an additional featurette, &quot;&quot;Firefly&quot; Reunion: Lunch with Joss, Nathan, Alan and Ron&quot;. On September 19, 2017, the series was reissued on Blu-ray as a &quot;15th Anniversary Collection&quot;. The set included new packaging that came with character cards and a fold-out map of the solar system in which the series is set.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an approval rating of 77% with an average score of 7.8 out of 10 based on 44 reviews. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Firefly&quot; earns its audience&#x27;s adoration with the help of Nathan Fillion&#x27;s dry delivery, a detailed fantasy world, and compelling storylines – even if it doesn&#x27;t stand with creator Joss Whedon&#x27;s most consistent work.&quot; Metacritic collected 30 reviews and calculated an average score of 63 out of 100, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Many reviews focused on the show&#x27;s fusion of Wild West and outer space motifs. &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s Matt Roush, for instance, called the show &quot;oddball&quot; and &quot;offbeat&quot; and noted how the series took the metaphor of space operas as Westerns. Roush opined that the shift from space travel to horseback was &quot;jarring&quot;, but that once he got used to this, he found the characters cleverly conceived and the writing a crisp balance of action, tension, and humor. Several reviewers criticized the show&#x27;s setting; Tim Goodman of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; felt that the melding of the western and science fiction genres was a &quot;forced hodgepodge of two alarmingly opposite genres just for the sake of being different&quot; and called the series a &quot;vast disappointment&quot;, and Carina Chocano of Salon.com said that while the &quot;space as Wild West&quot; metaphor is fairly redundant, neither genre connected to the present. Emily Nussbaum of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, reviewing the DVD set, noted that the program featured &quot;an oddball genre mix that might have doomed it from the beginning: it was a character-rich sci-fi western comedy-drama with existential underpinnings, a hard sell during a season dominated by &quot;Joe Millionaire&quot;&quot;.

The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; described &quot;Firefly&quot; as a &quot;wonderful, imaginative mess brimming with possibility&quot;. The review further notes the difference between the new series and other programs was that those shows &quot;burst onto the scene with slick pilots and quickly deteriorate into mediocrity ... &quot;Firefly&quot; is on the opposite creative journey.&quot; Jason Snell called the show one of the best on television, and one &quot;with the most potential for future brilliance&quot;.

Tim White, writing for &quot;The Objective Standard&quot;, focused his review on the show&#x27;s depiction of heroism. He concludes that &quot;&quot;Firefly&quot; is not perfectly accurate in its attempts to depict the essential natures of heroism and villainy, but its successes are much more uplifting than its failures are problematic. It&#x27;s also consistently funny, skillfully written, and passionately acted.&quot;

Reviewers compared &quot;Firefly&quot; to Whedon&#x27;s other series, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. Chocano noted that the series lacks the psychological tension of &quot;Buffy&quot; and suggests that this might be attributable to the episodes being aired out of order. MSN, on the other hand, pointed out that after viewing the DVD boxed set, it was easy to see why the program had attracted many die-hard fans. &quot;All of Whedon&#x27;s fingerprints are there: the witty dialogue, the quirky premises and dark exploration of human fallacy that made &quot;Buffy&quot; brilliant found their way to this space drama&quot;. Reviewers have also drawn comparisons and parallels between &quot;Firefly&quot; and the anime media mix &quot;Outlaw Star&quot;.

Princess Weekes from &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; stated that she &quot;really enjoyed&quot; the series, but wrote that, &quot;it lacks Chinese actors, so if it&#x27;s going to be brought back, that&#x27;s a really easy fix.&quot; Writing for Syfy, Alyssa Fikse described the show as a &quot;problematic fave&quot;, calling the lack of Asian characters in the show &quot;negligent at best, racist at worst&quot;.

=== Fandom ===

&quot;Firefly&quot; generated a loyal base of fans during its three-month original broadcast run on Fox in late 2002. These fans, self-styled Browncoats, used online forums to organize and try to save the series from being canceled by Fox only three months after its debut. Their efforts included raising money for an ad in &quot;Variety&quot; magazine and a postcard writing campaign to UPN. While unsuccessful in finding a network that would continue the show, their support led to a release of the series on DVD in December 2003. A subsequent fan campaign raised over $14,000 in donations to have a purchased &quot;Firefly&quot; DVD set placed aboard 250 U.S. Navy ships by April 2004 for recreational viewing by their crews.

These and other continuing fan activities eventually persuaded Universal Studios to produce a feature film, &quot;Serenity&quot;. (The title of &quot;Serenity&quot; was chosen, according to Whedon, because Fox still owned the rights to the name &#x27;Firefly&#x27;). Numerous early screenings of rough film cuts were held for existing fans starting in May 2005 as an attempt to create a buzz to increase ticket sales when the final film cut was released widely on September 30, 2005. The film was not as commercially successful as fans had hoped, opening at number two and making only $40 million worldwide during its initial theatrical release.

On June 23, 2006, fans organized the first worldwide charity screenings of &quot;Serenity&quot; in 47 cities, dubbed as Can&#x27;t Stop the Serenity or CSTS, an homage to the movie&#x27;s tagline, &quot;Can&#x27;t stop the signal&quot;. The event raised over $65,000 for Whedon&#x27;s favorite charity, Equality Now. In 2007, $106,000 was raised; in 2008, $107,219; and in 2009, $137,331.

In July 2006 a fan-made documentary, &quot;Done the Impossible&quot;, was released. The documentary tells the story of the fans and how the show has affected them, and features interviews with Whedon and various cast members. Part of the DVD proceeds are donated to Equality Now.

NASA Browncoat astronaut Steven Swanson took the &quot;Firefly&quot; and &quot;Serenity&quot; DVDs with him on Space Shuttle Atlantis&#x27;s STS-117 mission in June 2007. The DVDs were added to the media collection on the International Space Station as entertainment for the station&#x27;s crews.

A fan-made, not-for-profit, unofficial sequel to &quot;Serenity&quot;, titled &quot;Browncoats: Redemption&quot;, premiered at Dragon*Con 2010 on September 4, 2010. According to the film&#x27;s creator and producer, Whedon gave &quot;his blessing&quot; to the project. The film was sold on DVD and Blu-ray at the film&#x27;s website, with all proceeds being distributed among five charities. The film was also screened at various science-fiction conventions across the United States, with admission receipts similarly being donated. All sales ended on September 1, 2011, one year after its premiere, with total revenues exceeding $115,000.

=== Cult status ===
In 2005, &quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine&#x27;s website held an internet poll to find &quot;The World&#x27;s Best Space Sci-Fi Ever&quot;. &quot;Firefly&quot; came in first place, with its cinematic follow-up &quot;Serenity&quot; in second. In 2012, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed the show at No. 11 in the &quot;25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years&quot;, commenting, &quot;as it often does, martyrdom has only enhanced its legend.&quot;

Brad Wright, co-creator of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; has said that the 200th episode of &quot;SG-1&quot; is &quot;a little kiss to &quot;Serenity&quot; and &quot;Firefly&quot;, which was possibly one of the best canceled series in history&quot;. In the episode, &quot;Martin Lloyd has come to the S.G.C. [Stargate Command] because even though &#x27;Wormhole X-Treme!&#x27; was canceled after three episodes, it did so well on DVD they&#x27;re making a feature [film]&quot;.

The follow-up film, &quot;Serenity&quot;, was voted the best science fiction movie of all time in an &quot;SFX&quot; magazine poll of 3,000 fans. &quot;Firefly&quot; was later ranked #25 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s Top Cult Shows Ever. The name for the Google beta app Google Wave was inspired by this TV series.

In an interview on February 17, 2011, with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Nathan Fillion joked that: &quot;If I got $300 million from the California Lottery, the first thing I would do is buy the rights to &quot;Firefly&quot;, make it on my own, and distribute it on the Internet&quot;. This quickly gave rise to a fan-run initiative to raising the funds to purchase the rights. On March 7, 2011, the organizers announced the closure of the project due to lack of endorsement from the creators, with $1 million pledged at the time it was shut down.

Joss Whedon, Tim Minear, and cast members Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk, Summer Glau, Adam Baldwin, and Sean Maher reunited at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con for a 10th-anniversary panel. Ten thousand people lined up to get into the panel, and the panel ended with the crowd giving the cast and crew a standing ovation.

A tenth anniversary special, &quot;Browncoats Unite&quot;, was shown on the Science Channel on November 11, 2012. The special featured Whedon, Minear, and several of the cast members, in a discussion on the series&#x27; history.

According to &quot;Reason&quot;″s Julian Sanchez, &quot;Firefly&quot;″s cult following &quot;seems to include a disproportionate number of libertarians&quot;. The story themes are often cautionary about too-powerful central authority and its capacity to do bad while being considered by the majority as good. The characters each exhibit traits that exemplify core libertarian values, such as the right to bear arms (Jayne, Zoe), legal prostitution (Inara), freedom of religion (Book), logic and reasoning (Simon), and anti-conscription (River). Joss Whedon notes this theme, saying &quot;Mal is, if not a Republican, certainly a libertarian, he&#x27;s certainly a less-government kinda guy. He&#x27;s the opposite of me in many ways.&quot;

=== Podcasts ===
&quot;The Signal&quot; is a &quot;Firefly&quot; and &quot;Serenity&quot;-focused podcast developed by fans of the Joss Whedon property. Hosted by Kari Haley and Les Howard, &quot;The Signal&quot; is a fan-driven podcast dedicated to Joss Whedon&#x27;s short-lived TV series &quot;Firefly&quot; (2002) and its film &quot;Serenity&quot; (2005). Initially created as guerrilla marketing to promote &quot;Serenity&quot;, the podcast features discussions about the franchise&#x27;s role-playing game, fan fiction as audio dramas, and interviews (e.g. with PJ Haarsma, Jane Espenson, and Marc Gunn). Haley and Howard described the podcast&#x27;s purpose as &quot;[doing] whatever we can to see that more new &quot;Firefly&quot; is created in any format.&quot;

In early 2006, Mur Lafferty described the show as &quot;PG-rated&quot;, about an hour long, and publishing an episode every two weeks. That December, &quot;The Signal&quot; released a compilation album of filk music that had previously featured on the podcast: &quot;Songs from the Black&quot;; the album featured music by Luke Ski, Lich King, and Greg Edmonson.

In 2006, &quot;The Signal&quot; received a People&#x27;s Choice Podcast Award in the categories of &quot;TV &amp; Film&quot; and &quot;Best Produced&quot;; it received the former again in 2008. &quot;The Signal&quot; was awarded the 2007 Parsec Award for &quot;Best Fan Podcast&quot;, and in the category of &quot;Best Speculative Fiction Fan or News Podcast (Specific)&quot;, it won the 2010 and 2012 Parsecs. Writing for Maximum Fun, Ian Brill praised &quot;The Signal&quot; as surprisingly professional with well-produced segments, though he unflatteringly compared Haley and Howard to Whedon&#x27;s character Xander Harris: &quot;They say mildly clever and cutesy things to each other and then sound tremendously satisfied with themselves while saying it.&quot;

=== Ratings ===
At the time the series was canceled by Fox, it averaged 4.7 million viewers and ranked 98th in Nielsen ratings.

=== In popular culture ===
The cancellation of &quot;Firefly&quot; is a running gag in the CBS sitcom, &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, which ran from 2007 to 2019. The character Sheldon Cooper is a fan of the show. When he and Leonard Hofstadter discuss their roommate agreement, they include a passage in which they dedicate Friday nights to watching &quot;Firefly&quot;, as Sheldon believes it will last for years (season 3, episode 22). Upon its cancellation, he brands Rupert Murdoch, the owner of Fox, a traitor. During the show&#x27;s second season, in episode 17 (&quot;The Terminator Decoupling&quot;), Summer Glau appears as herself, encountering Sheldon, Leonard, and their friends on a train to San Francisco. When Raj tries to hit on her, he says that although he is an astrophysicist, she was actually in space during the shooting of &quot;Firefly&quot;. Glau chides him for believing this, and Raj backtracks, saying, &quot;Those are crazy people!&quot; In season 8, episode 15, Raj and Leonard recognize Nathan Fillion in a café and insist on taking a selfie with him, though he denies being the &quot;Firefly&quot; star.

On the NBC comedy &quot;Community&quot;, the characters Troy and Abed are fans of the show. They have an agreement that if one of them dies, the other will stage it to look like a suicide caused by the cancellation of &quot;Firefly&quot;, in the hopes that it will bring the show back.

In the 2003 &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; miniseries/pilot, a ship resembling &quot;Serenity&quot; appears in the background of the scene with Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell). &quot;Serenity&quot; is one of several spaceships inserted as cameos into digital effects scenes by Zoic Studios, the company responsible for digital effects in both &quot;Firefly&quot; and &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;.

The television series &quot;Castle&quot;, where Fillion plays the lead character Richard Castle, has made ongoing homages to &quot;Firefly&quot;. Castle has props from &quot;Firefly&quot; as decorative items in his home, has dressed up as a &quot;space cowboy&quot; for Halloween (&quot;You wore that five years ago&quot;, cracked his daughter), speaks Chinese that he learned from &quot;a TV show [he] loved&quot;, and has made rapid &quot;two-by-two&quot; finger motions while wearing blue surgical gloves. He has been humorously asked if he has ever heard of a spa known as &quot;Serenity&quot;, and &quot;Firefly&quot; catchphrases such as &quot;shiny&quot;, &quot;special hell&quot;, and &quot;I was aiming for the head&quot; have been used as punchlines during various dramatic scenes in &quot;Castle&quot;. He has worked a murder case at a science fiction convention with suspects being the cast of a long-cancelled space opera that only ran for a season, and has had direct and incidental interaction with people portrayed by &quot;Firefly&quot; cast members.

&quot;Con Man&quot;, a 2015 comedy web series created by Tudyk and co-produced by Fillion, draws on the pair&#x27;s experiences as cult science fiction actors touring the convention circuit. Though it is not autobiographical, the show&#x27;s fictional &quot;Spectrum&quot; echoes &quot;Firefly&quot; and Tudyk&#x27;s and Fillion&#x27;s roles reflect their own &quot;Firefly&quot; roles. Staite, Torres, Glau, Maher, and Whedon made guest appearances. Maher played himself as a former &quot;Firefly&quot; actor.

== Media franchise ==
The popularity of the short-lived series served as the launching point for a media franchise within the &quot;Firefly&quot; universe, including the feature film &quot;Serenity&quot;, which addresses many plot points left unresolved by the series&#x27; cancellation.

Additionally, there are two comic-book mini-series, &quot;&quot; (3 issues, 104 pages, 2006), &quot;&quot; (3 issues, 80 pages, 2008) and a one-shot hardcover &quot;Serenity: The Shepherd&#x27;s Tale&quot; (56 pages, 2010), along with the one-shots &quot;Serenity: Downtime and The Other Half&quot; and &quot;Serenity: Float Out&quot; in which Whedon explored plot strands he had intended to explore further in the series. The comics are set, in plot terms, between the end of the TV series and the opening of the feature film. The two mini-series were later published in collected form as hardcover and paperback graphic novels. A six-issue series titled &quot;Serenity: Leaves on the Wind&quot; began in January 2014 and the series takes place after the events of the film. A six-issue series titled &quot;Serenity: No Power in the &#x27;Verse&quot; began in October 2016 and the series is set about 1.5 years after &quot;Leaves on the Wind&quot;. In July 2018, Boom! Studios announced that they had acquired the comic book and graphic novel publishing license to &quot;Firefly&quot; with plans to release new monthly comic book series, limited series, original graphic novels, and more.

In July 2014, the release of the video game &quot;Firefly Online&quot; was announced that planned to have the cast reprise their roles. Although never officially cancelled, there have been no updates about the game&#x27;s release since March 2016.

In January 2018, Titan Books announced that they would begin publishing original canon &quot;Firefly&quot; novels. Nine books have so far been released.

In January 2020, Fox&#x27;s entertainment president Michael Thorn said that a revival series had been considered, but decided that since &quot;The Orville&quot; was on the air it would not make sense for the network to have two space franchises at the same time.

<text>Johann Evangelist Haydn (December 23, 1743 – May 10, 1805) was a tenor singer of the classical era; the younger brother of the composers Joseph Haydn and Michael Haydn. He was often called &quot;Hansl&quot;, a diminutive form of &quot;Johann&quot;.

Johann was the eleventh child of Mathias Haydn and Anna Maria Koller Haydn (Joseph was second, and Michael sixth). His career training may have been mixed. According to Albert Christoph Dies, an early biographer of Joseph Haydn, Johann followed his older brothers in serving as a choirboy in St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral in Vienna. However, Rosemary Hughes indicates that Johann was also trained in the profession of his father Mathias, namely that of wheelwright.

Hughes describes Johann as &quot;delicate and quite incapable of carrying on his father&#x27;s business.&quot; In 1763, Johann&#x27;s father died, leaving a will that specified an early financial distribution to Johann, prior to the formal division of the estate; as Jones suggests, this indicates that he was not yet able to support himself. In 1765, after his stepmother had remarried, Johann left home and joined his brother Joseph, who by this time was employed in Eisenstadt as Kapellmeister to the Esterházy family. Joseph took his younger brother into his home and found him a position as a tenor in the Esterházys&#x27; church choir. Johann worked without pay, supported by his brother, for six years, after which he drew a small salary, which Joseph supplemented.

Johann was apparently not a very accomplished singer. The composer Antonio Salieri once remarked of a pupil that he &quot;sang through the nose like Hansl Haydn&quot;. Perhaps as a result, his services to the Esterházy family were limited to church music; he was not recruited to perform in any of the many operas directed by Joseph starting in the 1770s. Johann did some teaching and may have been pressed into service from time to time as an emergency music copyist.

It is possible that Johann was paid as a singer as a favor to Joseph; that Haydn&#x27;s employer at the time (Prince Nikolaus Esterházy) esteemed Haydn&#x27;s services enough to make such arrangements is suggested by a similar act later on, in which he kept on the payroll another mediocre singer, Haydn&#x27;s mistress Luigia Polzelli.

Johann briefly lost his job in 1775 when some &quot;minor infraction&quot; (Robbins Landon) brought upon him the wrath of Prince Nikolaus&#x27;s estates director, the short-tempered Peter Ludwig von Rahier. The position was restored at Joseph Haydn&#x27;s intervention. Johann was again unemployed from 1790 (when Prince Anton Esterházy succeeded Nikolaus and abolished most of the family&#x27;s musical establishment) until 1795 (when Anton&#x27;s successor Nikolaus II revived it). Nothing is known about what Johann did during this time. Following his reinstatement, he continued in the service of the Esterházy family for the remainder of his life, dying in Eisenstadt at the age of 63.

<text>Chris Barrie (born Christopher Jonathan Brown; 28 March 1960) is a British actor and comedian. He worked as a vocal impressionist on the ITV sketch show &quot;Spitting Image&quot; (1984–1996) and as Lara Croft&#x27;s butler Hillary in &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; (2001) and &quot;Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life&quot; (2003). Barrie starred as Arnold Rimmer in 13 series of the sci-fi space comedy &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; between 1988 and 2020, and as Gordon Brittas in seven series of the BBC leisure centre sitcom &quot;The Brittas Empire&quot; (1991–1997).

==Early life and career==
Barrie was born on 28 March 1960 in Hanover, Lower Saxony, West Germany, to a father who was serving in the British Army, and later attended Methodist College, a boarding school, in Belfast, Northern Ireland. After dropping out of his Combined Studies course at Brighton Polytechnic, he became a grave filler. He began his television career as a sports personality impersonator on &quot;The David Essex Showcase&quot; in 1982.

He adopted the surname &quot;Barrie&quot; as there was already an actor named Chris Brown on the Equity UK lists. He was a regular on &quot;Saturday Live&quot;, amongst performers like Fry and Laurie, Rik Mayall and Ben Elton. Barrie provided the voice of Ronald Reagan in the pop song &quot;Two Tribes&quot; by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, as well as various vocalizations for other tracks by FGTH and Art of Noise. He also appeared as an impressionist on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Carrott&#x27;s Lib&quot; between 1983 and 1984, and he starred in his own sketch show &quot;Pushing Up Daisies&quot; (re-titled &quot;Coming Next&quot; for the following series) from 1984 to 1985 alongside Hale and Pace and Carla Mendonça. In 1987, he appeared as a French Revolutionary in &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot; (episode &quot;Nob and Nobility&quot;) and did various parts in &quot;The Young Ones&quot; both as an actor and a voice-over.

==&quot;Red Dwarf&quot;==
Barrie played the character Arnold J. Rimmer in all twelve series of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, appearing in almost every episode of the series, absent only for a period during series 7. When an unsold pilot for an American version of the show was produced, Barrie was invited to reprise his role as Rimmer. He passed up the offer because of the constraint of the five-series contract.
He starred in the 2020 special &quot;Red Dwarf: The Promised Land&quot;, alongside the main cast of Craig Charles, Danny John-Jules and Robert Llewellyn.
In addition to starring in the TV series, Barrie also narrated the first two &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; books, &quot;Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers&quot; (1992) and &quot;Better Than Life&quot; (1995), including using his vocal talents to recreate the voices of the other characters, as they sound in the show.

==&quot;The Brittas Empire&quot;==
Barrie played Gordon Brittas, the title role in &quot;The Brittas Empire&quot;, a BBC sitcom running from January 1991 to February 1997 for seven series, with 52 episodes, including two Christmas specials. Brittas was the well-meaning but incompetent manager of Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre. Each episode featured a disastrous occurrence, which Brittas was sure he could sort out, oblivious to the fact he was usually its cause.

Barrie also appeared as Brittas in the stand alone fitness mini-series &quot;Get Fit with Brittas&quot; in 1997.

In 2014, Barrie reprised his role as Gordon Brittas in the music video for Little Mix&#x27;s version of &quot;Word Up!&quot;.

In 2017, the cast reunited for the reopening of Ringwood Leisure centre where a lot of the series was recorded.

==Roles in television and films==

Barrie&#x27;s TV work includes &quot;Britain&#x27;s Greatest Machines with Chris Barrie&quot;, screened on the National Geographic channel from 4 June 2009. Each of the four episodes features some of the most notable air, sea, and land vehicles and equipment of the 1930s, 1950s, 1960s, and 1980s, respectively. The second series of four episodes was transmitted in February 2010, with the 1910s, 1920s, 1940s, and early steam trains as the subjects of each episode.

Barrie has also hosted the television series &quot;Chris Barrie&#x27;s Massive Engines&quot; and &quot;Chris Barrie&#x27;s Massive Machines&quot; on the Discovery Channel, later shown on Channel 5 and released on DVD. The latest in this series &quot;Massive Speed with Chris Barrie&quot; was shown on Discovery Channel from November 2006. In 2006, he appeared as a regular team captain in the BBC Two quiz show &quot;Petrolheads&quot; and was the star of the British crime/comedy/drama film &quot;Back In Business&quot;, in which he played Tom Marks.
Between 2015 and 2018 he was the voice-over for Channel 5&#x27;s &quot;Car Crash TV&quot; and 2018–2019 &quot;Idiot TV&quot;.

<doc id="158097" wikidata="Q239910" url="?curid=158097" title="Shirley Jackson">
<text>Shirley Hardie Jackson (December 14, 1916 – August 8, 1965) was an American writer known primarily for her works of horror and mystery. Her writing career spanned over two decades, during which she composed six novels, two memoirs, and more than 200 short stories.

Born in San Francisco, California, Jackson attended Syracuse University in New York, where she became involved with the university&#x27;s literary magazine and met her future husband Stanley Edgar Hyman. After they graduated, the couple moved to New York City and began contributing to &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; with Jackson as a fiction writer and Hyman as a contributor to &quot;Talk of the Town&quot;. The couple settled in North Bennington, Vermont, in 1945, after the birth of their first child, when Hyman joined the faculty of Bennington College.

After publishing her debut novel, &quot;The Road Through the Wall&quot; (1948), a semi-autobiographical account of her childhood in California, Jackson gained significant public attention for her short story &quot;The Lottery&quot;, which presents the sinister underside of a bucolic American village. She continued to publish numerous short stories in literary journals and magazines throughout the 1950s, some of which were assembled and reissued in her 1953 memoir &quot;Life Among the Savages&quot;. In 1959, she published &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot;, a supernatural horror novel widely considered to be one of the best ghost stories ever written. Jackson&#x27;s final work, the 1962 novel &quot;We Have Always Lived in the Castle&quot;, is a Gothic mystery that has been described as her masterpiece.

By the 1960s, Jackson&#x27;s health began to deteriorate significantly, ultimately leading to her death due to a heart condition in 1965 at the age of 48.

==Early life==
Jackson was born December 14, 1916, in San Francisco, California, to Leslie Jackson and his wife Geraldine (née Bugby).

Jackson was raised in Burlingame, California, an affluent suburb of San Francisco, where her family resided in a two-story home located at 1609 Forest View Road. Her relationship with her mother was strained, as her parents had married young and Geraldine had been disappointed when she immediately became pregnant with Shirley, as she had been looking forward to &quot;spending time with her dashing husband&quot;. Jackson was often unable to fit in with other children and spent much of her time writing, much to her mother&#x27;s distress. Geraldine made no attempt to hide her favoritism towards her son, Barry, who explained his mother&#x27;s antagonism towards Shirley by saying, &quot;[Geraldine] was just a deeply conventional woman who was horrified by the idea that her daughter was not going to be deeply conventional.&quot; When Shirley was a teenager, her weight fluctuated, resulting in a lack of confidence that she would struggle with throughout her life.

She attended Burlingame High School, where she played violin in the school orchestra. During her senior year of high school, the Jackson family relocated to Rochester, New York, after which she attended Brighton High School, receiving her diploma in 1934. She then attended the nearby University of Rochester, where her parents felt they could maintain supervision over her studies. Jackson was unhappy in her classes there, and took a year-long hiatus from her studies before transferring to Syracuse University, where she flourished both creatively and socially. Here she received her bachelor&#x27;s degree in journalism. While a student at Syracuse, Jackson became involved with the campus literary magazine, through which she met her future husband, Stanley Edgar Hyman, who later became a noted literary critic. While attending Syracuse, the university&#x27;s literary magazine published Jackson&#x27;s first story, &quot;Janice&quot;, about a teenager&#x27;s suicide attempt.

==Ancestry==
Jackson was of English ancestry, and her mother Geraldine traced her family heritage to the Revolutionary War hero General Nathanael Greene. Jackson&#x27;s maternal great-grandfather, John Stephenson, had been a prominent lawyer in San Francisco—later a Superior Court Judge in Alaska—while her great-great grandfather was Samuel Charles Bugbee, an architect whose works included the homes of Leland Stanford and Charles Crocker and the Mendocino Presbyterian Church. Jackson said:

Jackson&#x27;s maternal grandmother, nicknamed &quot;Mimi&quot;, was a Christian Science practitioner who continued to practice spiritual healing on members of the family after her retirement. Jackson was known to critically assess such attempts, recounting a time when Mimi claimed to have broken her leg and healed it through prayer overnight, though she had really only lightly sprained her ankle. When Mimi died, Jackson told her daughter that she &quot;died of Christian Science.&quot; While she believed that religion could easily become a vehicle for harm, the religious influences from her childhood are clear in Jackson&#x27;s writing, which includes themes of mysticism, mental power, and witchcraft.

==Marriage==
After graduating, Jackson and Hyman married in 1940, and had brief sojourns in New York City and Westport, Connecticut, ultimately settling in North Bennington, Vermont, where Hyman had been hired as an instructor at Bennington College. Jackson began writing material as Hyman established himself as a critic. Jackson and Hyman were known for being colorful, generous hosts who surrounded themselves with literary talents, including Ralph Ellison. They were both enthusiastic readers whose personal library was estimated at 25,000 books. They had four children, Laurence (Laurie), Joanne (Jannie), Sarah (Sally), and Barry, who later achieved their own brand of literary fame as fictionalized versions of themselves in their mother&#x27;s short stories. In an era when women were not encouraged to work outside the home, Jackson became the chief breadwinner while also raising the couple&#x27;s children. &quot;She did work hard,&quot; her son Laurence said. &quot;She was always writing, or thinking about writing, and she did all the shopping and cooking, too. The meals were always on time. But she also loved to laugh and tell jokes. She was very buoyant that way.&quot; For examples of her wit, he refers readers to her many humorous cartoons, one of which depicts a husband cautioning a wife not to carry heavy things during pregnancy, but not offering to help.

According to Jackson&#x27;s biographers, her marriage was plagued by Hyman&#x27;s infidelities, notably with his students, and she reluctantly agreed to his proposition of maintaining an open relationship. Hyman also controlled their finances (meting out portions of her earnings to her as he saw fit), despite the fact that after the success of &quot;The Lottery&quot; and later work she earned far more than he did.

==Writing career==

===&quot;The Lottery&quot; and early publications===
In 1948, Jackson published her debut novel, &quot;The Road Through the Wall&quot;, which tells a semi-autobiographical account of her childhood growing up in Burlingame, California, in the 1920s. Jackson&#x27;s most famous story, &quot;The Lottery&quot;, first published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on June 26, 1948, established her reputation as a master of the horror tale. The story prompted over 300 letters from readers, many of them outraged at its conjuring of a dark aspect of human nature, characterized by, as Jackson put it, &quot;bewilderment, speculation, and old-fashioned abuse&quot;. In the July 22, 1948, issue of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Jackson offered the following in response to persistent queries from her readers about her intentions: &quot;Explaining just what I had hoped the story to say is very difficult. I suppose I hoped, by setting a particularly brutal ancient rite in the present and in my own village, to shock the story&#x27;s readers with a graphic dramatization of the pointless violence and general inhumanity in their own lives.&quot;

The critical reaction to the story was unequivocally positive; the story quickly became a standard in anthologies and was adapted for television in 1952. In 1949, &quot;The Lottery&quot; was published in a short story collection of Jackson&#x27;s titled &quot;The Lottery and Other Stories&quot;.

Jackson&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Hangsaman&quot; (1951), contained elements similar to the mysterious real-life December 1, 1946, disappearance of an 18-year-old Bennington College sophomore Paula Jean Welden. This event, which remains unsolved to this day, took place in the wooded wilderness of Glastenbury Mountain near Bennington in southern Vermont, where Jackson and her family were living at the time. The fictional college depicted in &quot;Hangsaman&quot; is based in part on Jackson&#x27;s experiences at Bennington College, as indicated by Jackson&#x27;s papers in the Library of Congress. The event also served as inspiration for her short story &quot;The Missing Girl&quot; (first published in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; in 1957, and posthumously in &quot;Just an Ordinary Day&quot; [1996]).

The following year, she published &quot;Life Among the Savages&quot;, a semi-autobiographical collection of short stories based on her own life with her four children, many of which had been published prior in popular magazines such as &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot; and &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;. Semi-fictionalized versions of her marriage and the experience of bringing up four children, these works are &quot;true-to-life funny-housewife stories&quot; of the type later popularized by such writers as Jean Kerr and Erma Bombeck during the 1950s and 1960s.

Reluctant to discuss her work with the public, Jackson wrote in Stanley J. Kunitz and Howard Haycraft&#x27;s &quot;Twentieth Century Authors&quot; (1955):
&quot;The persona that Jackson presented to the world was powerful, witty, even imposing,&quot; wrote Zoë Heller in &quot;The New Yorker.&quot; &quot;She could be sharp and aggressive with fey Bennington girls and salesclerks and people who interrupted her writing. Her letters are filled with tartly funny observations. Describing the bewildered response of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; readers to &#x27;The Lottery,&#x27; she notes, &#x27;The number of people who expected Mrs. Hutchinson to win a Bendix washing machine at the end would amaze you.&quot;

===&quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot; and other works===
In 1954, Jackson published &quot;The Bird&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1954), which detailed a woman with multiple personalities and her relationship with her psychiatrist. One of Jackson&#x27;s publishers, Roger Straus, deemed &quot;The Bird&#x27;s Nest&quot; &quot;a perfect novel&quot;, but the publishing house marketed it as a psychological horror story, which displeased her. Her following novel, &quot;The Sundial&quot;, was published four years later and concerned a family of wealthy eccentrics who believe they have been chosen to survive the end of the world. She later published two memoirs, &quot;Life Among the Savages&quot; and &quot;Raising Demons&quot;.

Jackson&#x27;s fifth novel, &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot; (1959), follows a group of individuals participating in a paranormal study at a reportedly haunted mansion. The novel, which interpolated supernatural phenomena with psychology, went on to become a critically esteemed example of the haunted house story, described by Joanne Harris as &quot;not only the best haunted-house story ever written, but also a quiet subversion of the ingénue trope in horror fiction, with a nod to Sartre&#x27;s &quot;Huis Clos&quot; with its toxic menage a trois&quot; and by Stephen King as one of the most important horror novels of the twentieth century. Also in 1959, Jackson published the one-act children&#x27;s musical &quot;The Bad Children&quot;, based on &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;.

===Declining health and death===
By the time &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot; had been published, Jackson suffered numerous health problems. She was a heavy smoker, resulting in chronic asthma. She also suffered from joint pain, exhaustion, and dizziness leading to fainting spells, which were attributed to a heart problem. Near the end of her life, Jackson also saw a psychiatrist for severe anxiety that had kept her housebound for extended periods of time, a problem worsened by a diagnosis of colitis, which made it physically difficult to travel even short distances from her home. To ease her anxiety and agoraphobia, the doctor prescribed barbiturates, which at that time were considered a safe, harmless drug. For many years, she also had periodic prescriptions for amphetamines for weight loss, which may have inadvertently aggravated her anxiety, leading to a cycle of prescription drug abuse using the two medications to counteract each other&#x27;s effects. Any of these factors, or a combination of all of them, may have contributed to her declining health. Jackson confided to friends that she felt patronized in her role as a &quot;faculty wife&quot; and ostracized by the townspeople of North Bennington. Her dislike of this situation led to her increasing abuse of alcohol in addition to tranquilizers and amphetamines.

Despite her failing health, Jackson continued to write and publish several works in the 1960s, including her final novel, &quot;We Have Always Lived in the Castle&quot; (1962), a Gothic mystery novel. It was named by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the &quot;Ten Best Novels&quot; of 1962. The following year, she published &quot;Nine Magic Wishes&quot;, an illustrated children&#x27;s novel about a child who encounters a magician who grants him numerous enchanting wishes. The psychological aspects of her illness responded well to therapy, and by 1964 she began to resume normal activities, including a round of speaking engagements at writers&#x27; conferences, as well as planning a new novel titled &quot;Come Along with Me,&quot; which was to be a major departure from the style and subject matter of her previous works.

In 1965, Jackson died in her sleep at her home in North Bennington, at the age of 48. Her death was attributed to a coronary occlusion due to arteriosclerosis or cardiac arrest. She was cremated, as was her wish.

===Posthumous publications===
In 1968, Jackson&#x27;s husband released a posthumous volume of her work, &quot;Come Along with Me&quot;, containing her unfinished last novel, as well as 14 previously uncollected short stories (among them &quot;Louisa, Please Come Home&quot;) and three lectures she gave at colleges or writers&#x27; conferences in her last years.

In 1996, a crate of unpublished stories was found in a barn behind Jackson&#x27;s house. A selection of those stories, along with previously uncollected stories from various magazines, were published in the 1996 volume &quot;Just an Ordinary Day&quot;. The title was taken from one of her stories for &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, &quot;One Ordinary Day, with Peanuts&quot;.

Jackson&#x27;s papers are available in the Library of Congress. In its August 5, 2013, issue &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published &quot;Paranoia&quot;, which the magazine said was discovered at the library. &quot;Let Me Tell You&quot;, a collection of stories and essays by Jackson (mostly unpublished) was released in 2015.

In December 2020, the short story &quot;Adventure on a Bad Night&quot; was published for the first time, appearing in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;.

==Adaptations==

==Legacy==

In 2007, the Shirley Jackson Awards were established with permission of Jackson&#x27;s estate. They are in recognition of her legacy in writing, and are awarded for outstanding achievement in the literature of psychological suspense, horror, and the dark fantastic. The awards are presented at Readercon.

In 2014, Susan Scarf Merrell published a well-received thriller, &quot;Shirley: A Novel&quot;, about Jackson, her husband, a fictional couple who move in with them, and a missing girl. In 2020, the novel was adapted into a feature film, &quot;Shirley&quot;, directed by Josephine Decker. Elisabeth Moss portrays Jackson and Michael Stuhlbarg costars as Stanley Edgar Hyman.

In 2016, journalist Ruth Franklin published &quot;Shirley Jackson: A Rather Haunted Life&quot;, a biography examining the influence of Jackson&#x27;s upbringing, marriage, and addictions upon her work, while positioning Jackson as a major figure in American literature and examiner of postwar American anxieties via &quot;domestic horror.&quot; Franklin&#x27;s biography would go on to receive the National Book Critics Circle Award for Biography, the Edgar Award for Critical/Biographical Work, and the Bram Stoker Award for Best Non-Fiction. Franklin also wrote the foreword for the 2021 publication &quot;Shirley Jackson: A Companion.&quot; This collection features comprehensive critical engagement with Jackson&#x27;s works, including those that have received less scholarly attention.

Since at least 2015, Jackson&#x27;s adopted home of North Bennington has honored her legacy by celebrating Shirley Jackson Day on June 27, the day the fictional story &quot;The Lottery&quot; took place.

Jackson has been cited as an influence on a diverse set of authors, including Neil Gaiman, Stephen King, Sarah Waters, Nigel Kneale, Claire Fuller, Joanne Harris, and Richard Matheson.

===Critical assessment===
Lenemaja Friedman&#x27;s &quot;Shirley Jackson&quot; (Twayne Publishers, 1975) was the first published survey of Jackson&#x27;s life and work. Judy Oppenheimer also covers Shirley Jackson&#x27;s life and career in &quot;Private Demons: The Life of Shirley Jackson&quot; (Putnam, 1988). S. T. Joshi&#x27;s &quot;The Modern Weird Tale&quot; (2001) offers a critical essay on Jackson&#x27;s work.

A comprehensive overview of Jackson&#x27;s short fiction is Joan Wylie Hall&#x27;s &quot;Shirley Jackson: A Study of the Short Fiction&quot; (Twayne Publishers, 1993). The only critical bibliography of Jackson&#x27;s work is Paul N. Reinsch&#x27;s &quot;A Critical Bibliography of Shirley Jackson, American Writer (1919–1965): Reviews, Criticism, Adaptations&quot; (Lewiston, New York: Edwin Mellen Press, 2001). Darryl Hattenhauer also provides a comprehensive survey of all of Jackson&#x27;s fiction in &quot;Shirley Jackson&#x27;s American Gothic&quot; (State University of New York Press, 2003). Bernice Murphy&#x27;s &quot;Shirley Jackson: Essays on the Literary Legacy&quot; (McFarland &amp; Company, 2005) is a collection of commentaries on Jackson&#x27;s work. Colin Hains&#x27;s &quot;Frightened by a Word: Shirley Jackson &amp; Lesbian Gothic&quot; (2007) explores the lesbian themes in Jackson&#x27;s major novels.

According to the post-feminist critic Elaine Showalter, Jackson&#x27;s work is the single most important mid-twentieth-century body of literary output yet to have its value reevaluated by critics. In a March 4, 2009, podcast distributed by the business publisher &quot;The Economist&quot;, Showalter also noted that Joyce Carol Oates had edited a collection of Jackson&#x27;s work called &quot;Shirley Jackson Novels and Stories&quot; that was published in the Library of America series.

Oates wrote of Jackson&#x27;s fiction: &quot;Characterized by the caprice and fatalism of fairy tales, the fiction of Shirley Jackson exerts a mordant, hypnotic spell.&quot;

Jackson&#x27;s husband wrote in his preface to a posthumous anthology of her work that &quot;she consistently refused to be interviewed, to explain or promote her work in any fashion, or to take public stands and be the pundit of the Sunday supplements. She believed that her books would speak for her clearly enough over the years&quot;. Hyman insisted that the dark visions found in Jackson&#x27;s work were not, as some critics claimed, the product of &quot;personal, even neurotic, fantasies&quot;, but, rather, comprised &quot;a sensitive and faithful anatomy&quot; of the Cold War era in which she lived, &quot;fitting symbols for [a] distressing world of the concentration camp and the Bomb&quot;. Jackson may even have taken pleasure in the subversive impact of her work, as indicated by Hyman&#x27;s statement that she &quot;was always proud that the Union of South Africa banned &#x27;The Lottery&#x27;, and she felt that &quot;they&quot; at least understood the story&quot;.

The 1980s witnessed considerable scholarly interest in Jackson&#x27;s work. Peter Kosenko, a Marxist critic, advanced an economic interpretation of &quot;The Lottery&quot; that focused on &quot;the inequitable stratification of the social order&quot;. Sue Veregge Lape argued in her Ph.D. thesis that feminist critics who did not consider Jackson to be a feminist played a significant role in her lack of earlier critical attention. In contrast, Jacob Appel has written that Jackson was an &quot;anti-regionalist writer&quot; whose criticism of New England proved unpalatable to the American literary establishment.

In 2009, critic Harold Bloom published an extensive study of Jackson&#x27;s work, challenging the notion that it was worthy of inclusion in the Western canon; Bloom wrote of &quot;The Lottery&quot;, specifically: &quot;Her art of narration [stays] on the surface, and could not depict individual identities. Even &#x27;The Lottery&#x27; wounds you once, and once only.&quot;

<text>Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1 (1964), was a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that districts in the United States House of Representatives must be approximately equal in population. Along with &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot; (1962) and &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; (1964), it was part of a series of Warren Court cases that applied the principle of &quot;one person, one vote&quot; to U.S. legislative bodies.

Article One of the United States Constitution requires members of the U.S. House of Representatives to be apportioned by population among the states, but it does not specify exactly how the representatives from each state should be elected. The case arose from a challenge to the unequal population of congressional districts in the state of Georgia.

In his majority opinion, which was joined by five other justices, Associate Justice Hugo Black held that Article One required that &quot;as nearly as practicable one man&#x27;s vote in a congressional election is to be worth as much as another&#x27;s.&quot; The decision had a major impact on representation in the House, as many states had districts of unequal population, often to the detriment of urban voters. The United States Senate was unaffected by the decision since the Constitution explicitly grants each state two senators representing the state at large.

==Decision==
Writing for the Court majority in &quot;Wesberry&quot;, Justice Black argued that a reading of the debates of the Constitutional Convention demonstrated conclusively that the Framers had meant, in using the phrase “by the People,” to guarantee equality of representation in the election of Members of the House of Representatives.

== Dissent ==
Writing in dissent, Justice Harlan argued that the statements cited by Justice Black had uniformly been in the context of the Great Compromise. Justice Harlan further argued that the Convention debates were clear to the effect that Article I, § 4, had vested exclusive control over state districting practices in Congress and that the Court action overrode a congressional decision not to require equally populated districts.

<text> () is a 15th-century manuscript that introduced the Korean script Hangul. The name of the manuscript was also the original name of the script.

King Sejong the Great commissioned the royal research institute Hall of Worthies to write the &quot;Hunminjeongeum&quot; to describe the writing system he had invented in 1443. The manuscript was then published in 1446.

&quot;Hunminjeongeum&quot; was intended to be a simpler alternative to the incumbent Chinese-based Hanja, in order to promote literacy among the general populace. It originally included 28 letters, but over time, four of those (ㆆ, ㆁ, ㅿ, ·) were abandoned, leading to the current 24 letters of Hangul.

Sejong the Great also commissioned the creation of a companion explanatory manuscript entitled &quot;Hunminjeongeum Haerye&quot;. In 1940, a copy of the &quot;Hunminjeongeum Haerye&quot; was discovered in Andong, Gyeongsang Province. An early copy of the document is in the Gansong Art Museum in Seoul, South Korea. In 1962, &quot;Hunminjeongeum Haerye&quot; was designated a National Treasure in South Korea and was registered by UNESCO in the Memory of the World Programme in 1997.

==History==
Before Hangul, the Korean alphabet, was created, Chinese characters were used to transcribe Korean words through systems such as &quot;idu&quot;, &quot;hyangchal&quot; and &quot;gugyeol&quot;. Since Chinese language and Korean language share few similarities, borrowing Chinese characters proved to be inefficient to reflect the spoken language. In addition, at the time when Sejong the Great was inventing Hangul the Ming dynasty had just come to power in China, which changed the pronunciation of Chinese characters, making it harder for Koreans to learn the new standard pronunciation to record their words. The illiteracy level also stayed high since reading and learning Chinese characters was restricted among the ordinary people. They were generally used in official documents by the ruling class. The ruling class took advantage of this and learning the Chinese characters became a symbol of power and privilege. In order to make written language more accessible for common people, Sejong the Great started creating Hangul secretly, since the ruling class would be appalled by the news.

Hangul was personally created by Sejong the Great, the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty, and revealed by him in 1443. Although it is widely assumed that Sejong the Great ordered the Hall of Worthies to invent Hangul, contemporary records such as the &quot;Veritable Records of King Sejong&quot; and Chŏng Inji&#x27;s preface to the &quot;Hunminjeongeum Haerye&quot; emphasize that he invented it himself. This is stated in Book 113 of The Annals of King Sejong (Sejongsillok) on the 9th month and the 28th year of reign of King Sejong and at the end of &quot;An Illustrated Explanation of Hunminjeongeum&quot; (; &quot;Hunminjeongeum Haerye&quot;). Afterward, King Sejong wrote the preface to the &quot;Hunminjeongeum&quot;, explaining the origin and purpose of Hangul and providing brief examples and explanations, and then tasked the Hall of Worthies to write detailed examples and explanations. The head of the Hall of Worthies, Chŏng Inji, was responsible for compiling the &quot;Hunminjeongeum&quot;. The &quot;Hunminjeongeum&quot; was published and promulgated to the public in 1446. The writing system is referred to as Hangul today but was originally named as &quot;Hunminjeongeum&quot; by King Sejong. &quot;Hunmin&quot; and &quot;Jeongeum&quot; are respective words that each indicate &quot;to teach the people&quot; and &quot;proper sounds.&quot; Together &quot;Hunminjeongeum&quot; means &quot;correct sounds for the instruction of the people.&quot;

==Versions and content==
There are three versions of &quot;Hunminjeongeum.&quot;

* &quot;Hunminjeongeum Yeui:&quot; Hanja version (&quot;Hunminjeongeum Sillok&quot; () is classified as &quot;Hunminjeongeum Yeui.&quot;) 
* &quot;Hunminjeongeum Haerye:&quot; An Illustrated Explanation of Hunminjeongeum (&quot;Hunminjeongeum Yeui&quot; + explanation: Haerye)
* &quot;Hunminjeongeum Eonhae:&quot; Hangul version of &quot;Hunminjeongeum Yeui&quot;

&quot;Hunminjeongeum Yeui&quot; is written in Classical Chinese/Hanja and contains a preface, the alphabet letters&quot;,&quot; and brief descriptions of their corresponding sounds. The Classical Chinese (Hanja) of the &quot;Hunminjeongeum&quot; has been partly translated into Middle Korean. This translation is found together with : an annotated Buddhist scripture and is called the &quot;Hunminjeongeum Eonhae&quot;.

The first paragraph of the document reveals Sejong the Great&#x27;s motivation for creating Hangul:

<text>Cuba Mark Gooding Jr. (born January 2, 1968) is an American actor. After his breakthrough role as Tre Styles in &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot; (1991), he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor playing a football star in &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; (1996). His other notable films include &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; (1992), &quot;Judgment Night&quot; (1993),&quot; Lightning Jack&quot; (1994), &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot; (1997), &quot;Men of Honor&quot; (2000), &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (2001), &quot;Snow Dogs &quot;(2002), &quot;Radio&quot; (2003), &quot;Norbit&quot; (2007), &quot;Linewatch&quot; (2008), and he played Dr. Ben Carson in the film &quot;Gifted Hands &quot;(2009). He played in &quot;Red Tails&quot; (2012), and &quot;The Butler&quot; (2013). He has done voice acting in &quot;Home on the Range&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Land Before Time XIII: The Wisdom of Friends&quot; (2007).

For his portrayal of O. J. Simpson in the FX drama series &quot;The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story&quot; (2016), he earned a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie. He also co-starred that year in the FX series &quot;American Horror Story: Roanoke&quot; (2016). 

Gooding made his Broadway debut playing Ludie Watts in the 2013 revival of the Horton Foote play &quot;The Trip to Bountiful&quot;. In 2018, he played Billy Flynn in the musical &quot;Chicago&quot; in both the West End and on Broadway.

== Early life and education ==
Gooding was born on January 2, 1968, in the Bronx, New York City. His mother, Shirley Sullivan, is a singer, and his father, Cuba Gooding Sr., was the lead vocalist of soul group The Main Ingredient. Gooding has three siblings: April, Omar, and Thomas. His paternal grandfather, Dudley MacDonald Gooding, was a native of Barbados. 

His family moved from New York to Los Angeles in 1972, after his father&#x27;s music group had their hit single &quot;Everybody Plays the Fool&quot;; two years later, the elder Gooding left the family. Gooding was raised by his mother and attended four different high schools: North Hollywood High School, Tustin High School, Apple Valley High School, and John F. Kennedy High School in Granada Hills in Los Angeles. Showing leadership, he served as class president in three of them. He had become a born-again Christian at the age of 13.

==Career==
===1984–1996: Early roles and &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; ===

Gooding&#x27;s first job as an entertainer was as a breakdancer, performing with singer Lionel Richie at the closing ceremonies of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. After high school, Gooding studied Japanese martial arts for three years before turning his focus toward acting. 

Early on, he landed guest starring roles on shows such as &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; (1987), &quot;Amen&quot; (1988) and &quot;MacGyver&quot; (1988, 1989 and 1990). He also had a small part in the popular comedy &quot;Coming to America&quot; (1988). 

Gooding&#x27;s first major role was the lead in John Singleton&#x27;s inner-city crime drama &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot; (1991), in which he played Tre Styles. The film was a box office surprise success and critical hit. It is now considered a modern classic. Gooding followed this success with supporting roles in major films such as &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; and &quot;Gladiator&quot; (both 1992), &quot;Judgment Night&quot; (1993), &quot;Lightning Jack&quot; (1994), and &quot;Outbreak&quot; (1995). He played Billy Roberts in the HBO film &quot;The Tuskegee Airmen&quot; (1995).

In 1996, Gooding reached a new level of prominence when he was cast as an arrogant yet charismatic football player in Cameron Crowe&#x27;s dramatic sports comedy &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; (1996), co-starring with Tom Cruise. The film was a major critical and commercial success and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture; Gooding won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. His exuberant &quot;Show me the money!&quot; line in the film became a nationwide catchphrase. His Oscar acceptance speech has often been cited for its enthusiasm.

===1997–2012: Established actor ===

In 1997, Gooding followed his breakout with a notable supporting role in the acclaimed Academy Award-winning comedy &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot; (1997). In the following years, his career was inconsistently successful. Some of his best-received performances include turns in films such as the mystical drama &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; (1998) and the US Naval drama &quot;Men of Honor&quot; (2000), in which he played the lead role and co-starred with Robert De Niro. Gooding also received attention for his roles in the epic &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (2001) as Doris Miller, the ensemble farce &quot;Rat Race&quot; (2001), musical dramedy &quot;The Fighting Temptations&quot; (2003), and the football drama &quot;Radio&quot; (2003), in which he played the title role. Additionally, though not well received critically, the family comedy &quot;Snow Dogs&quot; (2002) was a commercial success. In 2002, he was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Gooding starred in an online video game called &quot;The Quest For The Code&quot; which focuses on juvenile asthma management.

Other roles during this time include Theo Caulder in the psychological thriller &quot;Instinct&quot; (1999). He voiced Buck the Horse in the Disney animated film &quot;Home on the Range&quot; (2004). However, during this stage of his career, he appeared in a series of films that were not critically or commercially successful, such as &quot;Chill Factor&quot; (1999), &quot;Boat Trip&quot; (2002), &quot;Norbit&quot; (2007) and &quot;Daddy Day Camp&quot; (2007), all of which received extremely negative reviews and, except for &quot;Norbit&quot;, performed poorly at the box office. 

Since then, in contrast to earlier stages of his acting career, Gooding has appeared in more critically ignored, direct-to-DVD films than theatrical or television releases. A well-received performance as Ben Carson in the TNT film &quot;Gifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story&quot; (2009), and a small supporting role in Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;American Gangster&quot; (2007), both proved to be exceptions to this trend. 

Gooding&#x27;s next major film role was in the 2012 World War II film &quot;Red Tails&quot;, produced by George Lucas. In 2012, Gooding starred in a TV pilot for Fox called &quot;Guilty&quot;, which was directed by McG. Though it was well received in screenings, it was ultimately not picked up by the network. He appeared on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Chris Moyles&#x27; Quiz Night&quot; on August 5, 2011, closing the show in a duet, &quot;Bad Romance&quot;, with Lulu.

=== 2013–present: Broadway debut and TV roles ===
In 2013, Gooding had roles in several theatrical release films, including a well-received supporting performance in Lee Daniels&#x27;s &quot;The Butler&quot; and brief appearances in &quot;Don Jon&quot; and &quot;Machete Kills&quot;. 

He made his Broadway theatre debut alongside Cicely Tyson and Vanessa Williams in a Tony Award-nominated production of &quot;The Trip to Bountiful&quot;.

In 2014, he appeared as Civil Rights Movement attorney Fred Gray in the widely acclaimed historical drama &quot;Selma&quot;. He has since appeared more frequently in television productions, including performances as Samuel Fraunces in the miniseries &quot;The Book of Negroes&quot;, as a comedically embellished version of himself on &quot;Big Time in Hollywood, FL&quot;, and as O. J. Simpson in the anthology series &quot;American Crime Story: The People v. O. J. Simpson&quot;. 

Although his performance as &#x27;OJ&#x27; received mixed reviews, he received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie. Some reviewers criticized the nomination. In 2018, Gooding headlined the 21st anniversary revival of the musical &quot;Chicago&quot; at the Phoenix Theatre in the West End, playing Billy Flynn .

His directorial debut, &quot;Bayou Caviar&quot;, was released on October 5, 2018. On March 3, 2018, Gooding appeared as star guest announcer on the 100th episode of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Ant and Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot;.

==Personal life==
=== Marriage ===
In 1994, Gooding married his high school sweetheart, Sara Kapfer. They had three children together: Spencer Gooding, Piper Gooding, and Mason Gooding, who followed him into acting. 

Twenty years later, in 2014, Kapfer filed for legal separation from Gooding. Gooding filed for divorce in January 2017. 

=== Charity work ===
In 2006, Gooding earned the Public Leadership in Neurology Award from the American Academy of Neurology for his work raising awareness about Multiple Sclerosis.

=== Sexual misconduct allegations ===

On June 13, 2019, Gooding was booked on charges of misdemeanor forcible touching and sexual abuse in the third degree in New York City, relating to an incident in which he allegedly groped a woman at a bar in Times Square. On October 10, he was indicted on a separate, additional sexual abuse charge. As of August 2020, 30 women have accused Gooding of unwanted sexual touching.

Gooding was formally charged for three incidents, each resulting in misdemeanor charges of forcible touching and third-degree sexual abuse.

On August 19, 2020, a woman filed a lawsuit against Gooding, accusing him of raping her in 2013 in New York City. The two parties came to a settlement agreement on June 6, 2023. As a result of the settlement, Gooding will not face trial. Gooding&#x27;s lawyers insisted that he and the woman had had consensual sex, saying that the woman had bragged afterwards to others that she had sex with a celebrity.

On April 12, 2022, Gooding pleaded guilty to forcibly touching a woman at a New York nightclub in 2018, telling the judge he &quot;kissed the waitress on her lips&quot; without her consent. He also admitted to the two other alleged incidents of non-consensual contact, which took place in October 2018 and June 2019.

Gooding reached a plea deal with prosecutors that did not require time in jail. He was allowed to withdraw his misdemeanor plea and plead to the lesser violation of harassment on the condition that he continue counseling for six months.

On February 26, 2024, Gooding was mentioned in a sexual assault lawsuit brought against Sean Combs by music producer Rodney Jones. The lawsuit alleged that Gooding had &quot;groped and fondled [Jones] non-consensually.&quot; On March 26, 2024, Jones amended the lawsuit to include Gooding as a co-defendant.

<text>Haylie Katherine Duff (born February 19, 1985) is an American actress and singer. She is best known for her roles as Sandy Jameson in the television series &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, Amy Sanders in &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; and Summer Wheatly in &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot;. An avid food blogger, Duff had her own cooking show, &quot;The Real Girl&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, in 2014. She is the older sister of Hilary Duff.

==Early life==
The older sister of Hilary Duff, Haylie Duff was born in Houston. Duff&#x27;s mother, Susan Colleen Duff (née Cobb) is a film producer who was a co-executive producer of &quot;A Cinderella Story&quot; (2004), a producer of &quot;The Perfect Man&quot; (2005) and &quot;Material Girls&quot; (2006), and the manager of Hilary; she was previously a homemaker. Her father, Robert Erhard &quot;Bob&quot; Duff, a partner and owner in a chain of convenience stores with his father, John B. Duff, resides at the family home in Houston to maintain the family&#x27;s business. She began her acting career as an offshoot of her early dance training. Growing up in Texas, Duff began ballet at an early age. By the age of eight, Duff landed a role in the Houston Metropolitan Dance Company&#x27;s production of &quot;The Nutcracker Suite.&quot;

==Career==
===Acting===

Duff&#x27;s early career started by making guest appearances on made-for-television films such as &quot;True Women&quot; and on TV series such as &quot;The Amanda Show&quot;. In addition to guest-starring roles on &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;, &quot;Boston Public&quot;, and &quot;Third Watch&quot;, Duff became a familiar face starting in late 2002 as Amy Sanders on &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;. In 2004, Duff made a guest appearance on &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; as Katina Jones. After making guest appearances on television, Duff received her first role in a feature film when she was cast as Summer Wheatly in &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot;. The film earned her first Teen Choice Award win. She continued making guest appearances, which include &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot; and &quot;American Dreams&quot;. She also lent her voice talent to the Christmas animation film &quot;In Search of Santa&quot; which again, featured sister Hilary. In 2005, Duff joined the cast of the television series &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, playing Sandy Jameson, best friend to Simon&#x27;s girlfriend Rose.

In June 2006, Duff joined the Broadway cast of &quot;Hairspray&quot;, portraying mean girl Amber Von Tussle, and left the role in early October 2006.

Duff has also starred in &quot;Material Girls&quot; with sister Hilary, where she is credited as co-producer, with her mother and sister credited as producers. Following &quot;Material Girls&quot;, Duff appeared in various made-for-television or straight-to-DVD films including &quot;Nightmare&quot;, &quot;My Sexiest Year&quot;, &quot;Legacy&quot;, &quot;Backwoods&quot;, &quot;Love Takes Wing&quot;, &quot;Love Finds a Home&quot; and &quot;My Nanny&#x27;s Secret&quot;.

Between 2008 and 2015, Duff appeared in various films and TV roles, including; &quot;Fear Island&quot;, &quot;Tug&quot; and &quot;Slightly Single in L.A.&quot; She lent her voice to the animated film &quot;Foodfight!&quot;, but due to distribution issues, the film was delayed for years until it finally saw a release in 2012. Duff hosted the reality show &quot;Legally Blonde: The Musical – The Search for Elle Woods&quot;, which searched for an actress to take over the lead role in &quot;Legally Blonde: The Musical&quot; where she had been in the chorus. She was also listed as an executive producer of the series. Duff&#x27;s project was the film &quot;Badge of Honor&quot; in 2015.

===Music===

Duff has recorded numerous singles for various soundtracks with her sister, with most of them appearing on the Disneymania discs. Notable soundtracks include: &quot;In Search of Santa&quot;, &quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie&quot;, &quot;A Cinderella Story&quot;, and &quot;Material Girls&quot;. She was featured on rapper Kool G Rap&#x27;s album &quot;Half a Klip&quot;, providing the background vocals on the track &quot;On the Rise Again&quot; produced by DJ Premier. Duff also sang &quot;A Whatever Life&quot; for the &quot;Stuck in the Suburbs&quot; soundtrack and &quot;Sweetest Pain&quot; for the &quot;Raising Helen&quot; soundtrack. She is also featured on song &quot;Babysitting Is a Bum Deal&quot; on the album &quot;Family Guy: Live in Las Vegas&quot;, singing a duet with Seth MacFarlane as his character Stewie. In addition to singing, Duff has also written and co-written several songs for her sister Hilary&#x27;s first two studio albums, &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; and her self titled second album. She also contributed the whistling to Hilary’s song &quot;Sparks&quot; from her album &quot;Breathe In. Breathe Out.&quot;

After signing with Hollywood Records, Duff planned on releasing &quot;Screwed&quot; in August 2004 as her debut solo single. When Paris Hilton revealed she had also recorded a version for her debut album, Duff claimed that she had procured the rights from the songwriters prior and attempted to block her from releasing the song. Hilton&#x27;s version was leaked onto radio airplay before their management teams could settle the dispute, and Duff&#x27;s team decided not to pursue the case further. In 2008, Duff&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Walk the Walk&quot;, was scheduled to be released later in the year. The album included &quot;Holiday&quot; as its lead single, &quot;Walk the Walk&quot; as its title track, &quot;Faded&quot;, &quot;Crush&quot;, and &quot;Just a Minute&quot;; however, it was never released and Duff parted with Hollywood Records. The song &quot;Holiday&quot; was later re-recorded by Hilary Duff and released on her greatest hits album &quot;Best of Hilary Duff&quot;.

===Other ventures===
In 2012 she started her own blog called &quot;Real Girl&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, which was later picked up by the Cooking Channel and made into a show in 2014. In 2013, Duff released her first book called &quot;The Real Girl&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;. In 2017 Haylie started her own children&#x27;s fashion line called Little Moon Society.

==Personal life==

In 2009, Duff stated, &quot;I am a Christian, but I also don&#x27;t really see myself as a religious person. I see myself as more of a spiritual person. There are a lot of things that I do agree with in Christianity and things that I don&#x27;t agree with. I&#x27;m not a regular churchgoer, but I do think that I have my own beliefs that I feel strongly about.&quot;

In April 2014, Duff announced her engagement to Matt Rosenberg after a year and a half of dating. She and Rosenberg have two daughters.

It was written by scholars from the &quot;Jiphyeonjeon&quot; (Hall of Worthies), commissioned by King Sejong the Great. In addition to an introduction by Sejong (excerpted from the beginning of &quot;Hunminjeongeum&quot;) and a colophon by the scholar Chŏng Inji, it contains the following chapters:

# &quot;An Explanation of the Design of the Letters&quot; (制字解)
# &quot;An Explanation of the Initials&quot; (初聲解)
# &quot;An Explanation of the Medials&quot; (中聲解)
# &quot;An Explanation of the Finals&quot; (終聲解)
# &quot;An Explanation of the Combination of the Letters&quot; (合字解)
# &quot;Examples of the Uses of the Letters&quot; (用字例)

The original publication is 65 pages printed in Hanja with right-to-left vertical writing, as is the case for all the ancient Korean literature in regular script, except where Hangul are mentioned and illustrated. One original copy was made public in 1940 by Jeon Hyeongpil, an antique collector who acquired it from Lee Hangeol (1880–1950), whose family had possessed it for generations.

Another copy was reported to be found in 2008. It included detailed footnotes by scholars at the time.

Now kept in the Gansong Art Museum, it is South Korean National Treasure No. 70 and has been included in the UNESCO Memory of the World international register since October 1997.
