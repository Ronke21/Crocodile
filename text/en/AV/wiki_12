<text>In computing, codice_1 is a command to list computer files and directories in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It is specified by POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification.
It is available in the EFI shell, as a separate package for Microsoft Windows as part of the UnxUtils collection of native Win32 ports of common GNU Unix-like utilities,
or as part of ASCII&#x27;s &quot;MSX-DOS2 Tools&quot; for MSX-DOS version 2.

The numerical computing environments MATLAB and GNU Octave include an codice_1 
function with similar functionality.

In other environments, such as DOS, OS/2, and Microsoft Windows, similar functionality is provided by the codice_3 command.

== History ==
An codice_1 utility appeared in the first version of AT&amp;T UNIX, the name inherited from a similar command in Multics also named &#x27;ls&#x27;, short for the word &quot;list&quot;. is part of the X/Open Portability Guide since issue 2 of 1987. It was inherited into the first version of POSIX.1 and the Single Unix Specification.

== Behavior ==
Unix and Unix-like operating systems maintain the idea of a working directory. When invoked without arguments, codice_1 lists the files in the working directory. If a directory is specified as an argument, the files in that directory are listed; if a file is specified, that file is listed. Multiple directories and files may be specified.

In many Unix-like systems, names starting with a dot (codice_6) are hidden. Examples are codice_6, which refers to the working directory, and codice_8, which refers to its parent directory. Hidden names are not shown by default. With codice_9, all names, including all hidden names, are shown. Using codice_10 shows all names, including hidden names, except for codice_6 and codice_8. File names specified explicitly (for example codice_13) are always listed.

Without options, codice_1 displays names only.
The different implementations have different options, but common options include:
* codice_15 Long format, displaying Unix file types, permissions, number of hard links, owner, group, size, last-modified date-time and name. If the modified date is older than 6 months, the time is replaced with the year. Some implementations add additional flags to permissions. The file type can be one of 8 characters: codice_16, regular file; codice_17, directory; codice_18, symbolic (soft) link; codice_19, network files; codice_20, socket; codice_21, named pipe (FIFO); codice_22, character special file; codice_23, block special file.
* codice_24 Output sizes in human readable format (e.g., 1K (kilobytes), 234M (megabytes), 2G (gigabytes)). This option is not part of the POSIX standard, although implemented in several systems, e.g., GNU coreutils in 1997, FreeBSD 4.5 in 2002, and Solaris 9 in 2002.

Additional options controlling how items are displayed include:
* codice_25 Recursively list items in subdirectories.
* codice_26 Sort the list by modification time (default sort is alphabetically).
* codice_27 Sort the list by last access time.
* codice_28 Sort the list by last attribute (status) change time.
* codice_29 Reverse the order, for example most recent time last.
* codice_30 Show times down to the second and millisecond instead of just the minute.
* codice_31 One entry per line.
* codice_32 Stream format; list items across the page, separated by commas.
* codice_33 Include group but not owner.
* codice_34 Include owner but not group (when combined with codice_33 both group and owner are suppressed).
* codice_36 Show information about a directory or symbolic link, rather than the contents of a directory or the link&#x27;s target.
* codice_37 Append a &quot;/&quot; to directory names and a &quot;*&quot; to executable files.

It may be possible to highlight different types of items with different colors. This is an area where implementations differ:
* GNU codice_1 uses the codice_39 option; it checks the Unix file type, the file permissions and the file extension and uses its own database to control colors maintained using dircolors.
* FreeBSD codice_1 uses the codice_41 option; it checks only the Unix file type and file permissions and uses the termcap database
When the option to use color to indicate item types is selected, the output might look like:

<doc id="158687" wikidata="Q2351803" url="?curid=158687" title="Pre-Columbian transoceanic contact theories">
<text>Pre-Columbian transoceanic contact theories are speculative theories which propose that visits to the Americas, interactions with the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, or both, were made by people from elsewhere prior to Christopher Columbus&#x27;s first voyage to the Caribbean in 1492. Studies between 2004 and 2009 suggest the possibility that the earliest human migrations to the Americas may have been made by boat from Beringia and travel down the Pacific coast, contemporary with and possibly predating land migrations over the Beringia land bridge, which during the glacial period joined what today are Siberia and Alaska. Apart from Norse contact and settlement, whether transoceanic travel occurred during the historic period, resulting in pre-Columbian contact between the settled American peoples and voyagers from other continents, is vigorously debated.

Only a few cases of pre-Columbian contact are widely accepted by mainstream scientists and scholars. Yup&#x27;ik and Aleut peoples residing on both sides of the Bering Strait had frequent contact with each other, and European trade goods have been discovered in pre-Columbian archaeological sites in Alaska. Maritime explorations by Norse peoples from Scandinavia during the late 10th century led to the Norse colonization of Greenland and a base camp L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland, which preceded Columbus&#x27;s arrival in the Americas by some 500 years. Recent genetic studies have also suggested that some eastern Polynesian populations have admixture from coastal western South American peoples, with an estimated date of contact around 1200 CE.

Scientific and scholarly responses to other claims of post-prehistory, pre-Columbian transoceanic contact have varied. Some of these claims are examined in reputable peer-reviewed sources. Many others are based only on circumstantial or ambiguous interpretations of archaeological evidence, the discovery of alleged out-of-place artifacts, superficial cultural comparisons, comments in historical documents, or narrative accounts. These have been dismissed as fringe science, pseudoarchaeology, or pseudohistory.

== Claims of Polynesian contact ==
=== Human genetics ===
Between 2007 and 2009, geneticist Erik Thorsby and colleagues published two studies in &quot;Tissue Antigens&quot; that offer evidence of an Amerindian genetic contribution to human populations on Easter Island, determining that it was probably introduced before European discovery of the island. In 2014, geneticist Anna-Sapfo Malaspinas of the Center for GeoGenetics at the University of Copenhagen published a study in &quot;Current Biology&quot; that found human genetic evidence of contact between the populations of Easter Island and South America, dating to approximately 600 years ago (i.e. 1400 CE ± 100 years). In 2017, a comprehensive genomes study found &quot;no Native American admixture in pre- and post-European-contact individuals&quot;.

Two skulls suggested to belong to &quot;Botocudo&quot; people (a term used to refer to Native Americans who live in the interior of Brazil that speak Macro-Jê languages), were found in research published in 2013 to have been members of mtDNA haplogroup B4a1a1, which is normally found only among Polynesians and other subgroups of Austronesians. This was based on an analysis of 14 skulls. Two belonged to B4a1a1, while twelve belonged to subclades of mtDNA haplogroup C1 (common among Native Americans). The research team examined various scenarios, none of which they could say for certain were correct. They dismissed a scenario of direct contact in prehistory between Polynesia and Brazil as &quot;too unlikely to be seriously entertained.&quot; While B4a1a1 is also found among the Malagasy people of Madagascar (which experienced significant Austronesian settlement in prehistory), the authors described as &quot;fanciful&quot; suggestions that B4a1a1 among the Botocudo resulted from the African slave trade (which included Madagascar). A later review paper of Polynesian history suggested that it was &quot;more likely that these are the skulls of two people who died in Polynesia sometime early in the period of European voyaging, and whose graves were robbed by later visitors, and then mistakenly grouped in collections with the remains of Native Americans.&quot;

In 2020, a study in &quot;Nature&quot; found that populations in the Mangareva, Marquesas, and Palliser islands and Easter Island had genetic admixture from indigenous populations of South America, with the DNA of contemporary populations of Zenú people from the Pacific coast of Colombia being the closest match. The authors suggest that the genetic signatures were probably the result of a single ancient contact. They proposed that an initial admixture event between indigenous South Americans and Polynesians occurred in eastern Polynesia between 1150 and 1230 CE, with later admixture in Easter Island around 1380 CE, but suggested other possible contact scenarios—for example, Polynesian voyages to South America followed by Polynesian people&#x27;s returning to Polynesia with South American people, or carrying South American genetic heritage. Several scholars uninvolved in the study suggested that a contact event in South America was more likely. Further genetic analysis on Easter Island indigenous population showed about 10% of the genome to be of Native American origin.

=== Plant genetics ===
The genetics of several plant species has also been used to support pre-Columbian contact via the Pacific. For example, there is a genetically distinct sub-population of coconuts on the western coast of South America. This has been suggested to be evidence of introduction by Austronesian seafarers.

=== Sweet potato ===
The sweet potato, a food crop native to the Americas, was widespread in Polynesia by the time European explorers first reached the Pacific. Sweet potato has been radiocarbon-dated to 1000 CE in the Cook Islands. Current thinking is that it was brought to central Polynesia c. 700 CE and spread across Polynesia from there. It has been suggested that it was brought by Polynesians who had traveled across the Pacific to South America and back, or that South Americans brought it to Polynesia. It is also possible that the plant floated across the ocean after being discarded from the cargo of a boat. According to the &quot;tripartite hypothesis&quot;, phylogenetic analysis supports at least two separate introductions of sweet potatoes from South America into Polynesia, including one before and one after European contact.

Dutch linguists and specialists in Amerindian languages Willem Adelaar and Pieter Muysken have suggested that the word for sweet potato is shared by Polynesian languages and languages of South America. Proto-Polynesian *&quot;kumala&quot; (compare Easter Island , Hawaiian , Māori ; even though a proto-form is reconstructed above, apparent cognates outside Eastern Polynesian are either definitely borrowed from Eastern Polynesian languages or irregular, calling Proto-Polynesian status and age into question) may be connected with dialectal Quechua and Aymara &quot;k&#x27;umar ~ k&#x27;umara&quot;; most Quechua dialects actually use &quot;apichu&quot; instead, but &quot;comal&quot; was attested at extinct Cañari language on the coast of what is now Ecuador in 1582.

Adelaar and Muysken assert that the similarity in the word for sweet potato &quot;constitutes near proof of incidental contact between inhabitants of the Andean region and the South Pacific.&quot; The authors argue that the presence of the word for sweet potato suggests sporadic contact between Polynesia and South America, but not necessarily migrations.

=== &quot;Ageratum conyzoides&quot; ===
&quot;Ageratum conyzoides&quot;, also known as billygoat-weed, chick weed, goatweed, or whiteweed, is native to the tropical Americas, and was found in Hawaii by William Hillebrand in 1888 who considered it to have grown there before Captain Cook&#x27;s arrival in 1778. A legitimate native name (&quot;meie parari&quot; or &quot;mei rore&quot;) and established native medicinal usage and use as a scent and in leis have been offered as support for the pre-Cookian age.

=== Turmeric ===
Turmeric (&quot;Curcuma longa&quot;) originated in Asia, and there is linguistic and circumstantial evidence of the spread and use of turmeric by the Austronesian peoples into Oceania and Madagascar. Günter Tessmann in 1930 (300 years after European contact) reported that a species of &quot;Curcuma&quot; was grown by the Amahuaca tribe to the east of the Upper Ucayali River in Peru and was a dye-plant used for the painting of the body, with the nearby Witoto people using it as face paint in their ceremonial dances. David Sopher noted in 1950 that &quot;the evidence for a pre-European, transpacific introduction of the plant by man seems very strong indeed&quot;.

=== Physical anthropology ===

In December 2007, several human skulls were found in a museum in Concepción, Chile. These skulls originated on Mocha Island, an island which is located just off the coast of Chile on the Pacific Ocean, formerly inhabited by the Mapuche. Craniometric analysis of the skulls, according to Lisa Matisoo-Smith of the University of Otago and José Miguel Ramírez Aliaga of the Universidad de Valparaíso, suggests that the skulls have &quot;Polynesian features&quot; – such as a pentagonal shape when they are viewed from behind, and rocker jaws.

Rocker jaws have also been found at an excavation led José Miguel Ramírez in the coastal locality of Tunquén, Central Chile. The site of excavation corresponds to an area with pre-Hispanic tombs and shell middens (). A global review of rocker jaws among different populations show that while rocker jaws are not unique to Polynesians &quot;[t]he rarity of rocker jaw in South American natives supports&quot; the view of &quot;Polynesian voyagers who ventured to the west coast of South America&quot;.

=== Disputed evidence ===
==== Araucanian chickens ====
In 2007, evidence emerged which suggested the possibility of pre-Columbian contact between the Mapuche people (Araucanians) of south-central Chile and Polynesians. Bones of Araucana chickens found at El Arenal site in the Arauco Peninsula, an area inhabited by Mapuche, support a pre-Columbian introduction of landraces from the South Pacific islands to South America. The bones found in Chile were radiocarbon-dated to between 1304 and 1424, before the arrival of the Spanish. Chicken DNA sequences were matched to those of chickens in American Samoa and Tonga, and found to be dissimilar to those of European chickens.

However, this finding was challenged by a 2008 study which questioned its methodology and concluded that its conclusion is flawed, although the theory it posits may still be possible. Another study in 2014 reinforced that dismissal, and posited the crucial flaw in the initial research: &quot;The analysis of ancient and modern specimens reveals a unique Polynesian genetic signature&quot; and that &quot;a previously reported connection between pre-European South America and Polynesian chickens most likely resulted from contamination with modern DNA, and that this issue is likely to confound ancient DNA studies involving haplogroup E chicken sequences.&quot;

However, in a 2013 study, the original authors extended and elaborated their findings, concluding: 
A 2019 study of South American chickens &quot;revealed an unknown genetic component that is mostly present in the Easter Island population that is also present in local chicken populations from the South American Pacific fringe&quot;. The Easter Island chicken&#x27;s &quot;genetic proximity with the SA continental gamefowl can be explained by the fact that both populations were not crossed with cosmopolitan breeds and therefore remain closer to the ancestral population that originated them. &quot; The genetic proximity might also &quot;be indicative of a common origin of these two populations&quot;.

==== California canoes ====

Researchers including Kathryn Klar and Terry Jones have proposed a theory of contact between Hawaiians and the Chumash people of Southern California between 400 and 800 CE. The sewn-plank canoes crafted by the Chumash and neighboring Tongva are unique among the indigenous peoples of North America, but similar in design to larger canoes used by Polynesians and Melanesians for deep-sea voyages. &quot;Tomolo&#x27;o&quot;, the Chumash word for such a craft, may derive from , the Hawaiian term for the logs from which shipwrights carve planks to be sewn into canoes. The analogous Tongva term, , is unrelated. If it occurred, this contact left no genetic legacy in California or Hawaii. This theory has attracted limited media attention within California, but most archaeologists of the Tongva and Chumash cultures reject it on the grounds that the independent development of the sewn-plank canoe over several centuries is well-represented in the material record.

==== Clava hand-club and words for axes ====
Archaeological artefacts known as clava hand-clubs found in Araucanía and nearby areas of Argentina have a strong resemblance to the mere okewa found in New Zealand. The clava hand-clubs are also mentioned in the Spanish chronicles dating to the Conquest of Chile. According to Grete Mostny, clava hand-clubs &quot;appear to have arrived to the west coast of South America from the Pacific&quot;. Polynesian clubs from Chatham Islands are reportedly the most similar to those of Chile. The clava hand-club is one of various Polynesian-like Mapuche artifacts known.

Possible linguistic evidence for Austronesian-American contact is found in words for axes. On Easter Island, the word for a stone axe is &quot;&quot;; among the New Zealand Maori, the word &quot;toki&quot; denotes an adze. Similar words are found in the Americas: In the Mapuche language of Chile and Argentina, the word for a stone axe is &quot;toki&quot;; and further afield in Colombia, the Yurumanguí word for an axe is &quot;totoki&quot;. 

Stone adzes often had ceremonial value and were worn by Maori chiefs. The Mapuche word &quot;toki&quot; may also mean &quot;chief&quot; and thus may be related to the Quechua word &quot;toqe&quot; (&quot;militia chief&quot;) and the Aymara word &quot;toqueni&quot; (&quot;person of great judgement&quot;). In the view of Moulian et al. (2015) the possible South American links complicate matters regarding the meaning of the word &quot;toki&quot; because they are suggestive of Polynesian contact.

== Population Y ==
A 2015 study found some Indigenous American groups, particularly those in the Amazon, carry a small admixture (around 1-2% of the genome) related to groups in Southeast Asia and Australasia like Andamanese peoples, Indigenous Australians, Papuans and the Mamanwa people of the Philippines. This ancestry component has been dubbed &quot;Population Y&quot;. Some authors have suggested that this reflects a trans-Pacific migration, but scholars have suggested that this more likely reflects genetic heterogeneity in the initial founding population of Native Americans present in Beringia, only some of which carried the &quot;Population Y&quot; ancestry. It has also been noted that a 40,000 year old individual from Tianyuan Cave in northern China also carries this ancestry, making it more likely that this ancestry was the result of contact in Eurasia, prior to the arrival of the ancestors of Native Americans in Beringia.

== Claims of East Asian contact ==

=== Claims of contact with Ecuador ===
A 2013 genetic study suggested the possibility of contact between Ecuador and East Asia, that would have happened no earlier than 6,000 years ago (4000 BC) via either a trans-oceanic or a late-stage coastal migration that did not leave genetic imprints in North America. Further research did not support this but was rather &quot;a case of a rare founding lineage that has been lost elsewhere by drift.&quot;

=== Claims of Chinese contact ===

Some researchers have argued that the Olmec civilization came into existence with the help of Chinese refugees, particularly at the end of the Shang dynasty. In 1975, Betty Meggers of the Smithsonian Institution argued that the Olmec civilization originated around 1200 BCE due to Shang Chinese influences. In a 1996 book, Mike Xu, with the aid of Chen Hanping, claimed that celts from La Venta bear Chinese characters. These claims are unsupported by mainstream Mesoamerican researchers.

Other claims of early Chinese contact with North America have been made. In 1882, approximately 30 brass coins, perhaps strung together, were reportedly found in the area of the Cassiar Gold Rush, apparently near Dease Creek, an area which was dominated by Chinese gold miners. A contemporary account states:In the summer of 1882 a miner found on De Foe (Deorse?) creek, Cassiar district, Br. Columbia, thirty Chinese coins in the auriferous sand, twenty-five feet below the surface. They appeared to have been strung, but on taking them up the miner let them drop apart. The earth above and around them was as compact as any in the neighborhood. One of these coins I examined at the store of Chu Chong in Victoria. Neither in metal nor markings did it resemble the modern coins, but in its figures looked more like an Aztec calendar. So far as I can make out the markings, this is a Chinese chronological cycle of sixty years, invented by Emperor Huungti, 2637 BCE, and circulated in this form to make his people remember it.

Grant Keddie, curator of archeology at the Royal B.C. Museum, identified these as good luck temple tokens which were minted in the 19th century. He believed that claims that these were very old made them notorious and he wrote that &quot;The temple coins were shown to many people and different versions of stories pertaining to their discovery and age spread around the province to be put into print and changed frequently by many authors in the last 100 years.&quot;

A group of Chinese Buddhist missionaries led by Hui Shen before 500 CE claimed to have visited a location called Fusang. Although Chinese mapmakers placed this territory on the Asian coast, others have suggested as early as the 1800s that Fusang might have been in North America, due to perceived similarities between portions of the California coast and Fusang as depicted by Asian sources.

In his debunked pseudohistorical book &quot;1421: The Year China Discovered the World&quot;, British author Gavin Menzies claimed that the treasure fleets of Ming admiral Zheng He arrived in America in 1421. The consensus among professional historians is that Zheng He only reached the eastern coast of Africa, and they dismiss Menzies&#x27;s claims as entirely without evidence.

In 1973 and 1975, doughnut-shaped stones that resembled stone anchors which were used by Chinese fishermen were discovered off the coast of California. These stones (sometimes called the &quot;Palos Verdes stones&quot;) were initially thought to be up to 1,500 years old and therefore, they were thought to be proof of pre-Columbian contact by Chinese sailors. Later geological investigations showed that they were made of a local rock which is known as Monterey shale, and it is currently believed that they were used by Chinese settlers who fished off the coast during the 19th century.

=== Claims of Japanese contact ===

Archaeologist Emilio Estrada and co-workers wrote that pottery which was associated with the Valdivia culture of coastal Ecuador and dated to 3000–1500 BCE exhibited similarities to pottery which was produced during the Jōmon period in Japan, arguing that contact between the two cultures might explain the similarities. Chronological and other problems have led most archaeologists to dismiss this idea as implausible. The suggestion has been made that the resemblances (which are not complete) are simply due to the limited number of designs possible when incising clay.

Alaskan anthropologist Nancy Yaw Davis claims that the Zuni people of New Mexico exhibit linguistic and cultural similarities to the Japanese. The Zuni language is a linguistic isolate, and Davis contends that the culture appears to differ from that of the surrounding natives in terms of blood type, endemic disease, and religion. Davis speculates that Buddhist priests or restless peasants from Japan may have crossed the Pacific in the 13th century, traveled to the American Southwest, and influenced Zuni society.

In the 1890s, lawyer and politician James Wickersham argued that pre-Columbian contact between Japanese sailors and Native Americans was highly probable, given that from the early 17th century to the mid-19th century several dozen Japanese ships are known to have been carried from Asia to North America along the powerful Kuroshio Currents. Japanese ships landed at places between the Aleutian Islands in the north and Mexico in the south, carrying a total of 293 people in the 23 cases where head-counts were given in historical records. In most cases, the Japanese sailors gradually made their way home on merchant vessels. In 1834, a dismasted, rudderless Japanese ship was wrecked near Cape Flattery in the Pacific Northwest. Three survivors of the ship were enslaved by Makahs for a period before being rescued by members of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Another Japanese ship went ashore in about 1850 near the mouth of the Columbia River, Wickersham writes, and the sailors were assimilated into the local Native American population. While admitting there is no definitive proof of pre-Columbian contact between Japanese and North Americans, Wickersham thought it implausible that such contacts as outlined above would have started only after Europeans arrived in North America and began documenting them.

== Claims of Indian contact ==

In 1879, Alexander Cunningham wrote a description of the carvings on the Stupa of Bharhut in central India, dating from c. 200 BCE, among which he noted what appeared to be a depiction of a custard-apple (&quot;Annona squamosa&quot;). Cunningham was not initially aware that this plant, indigenous to the New World tropics, was introduced to India after Vasco da Gama&#x27;s discovery of the sea route in 1498, and the problem was pointed out to him. A 2009 study claimed to have found carbonized remains that date to 2000 BCE and appear to be those of custard-apple seeds.
Grafton Elliot Smith claimed that certain motifs present in the carvings on the Mayan stelae at Copán represented the Asian elephant, and wrote a book on the topic entitled &quot;Elephants and Ethnologists&quot; in 1924. Contemporary archaeologists suggested that the depictions were almost certainly based on the (indigenous) tapir, with the result that Smith&#x27;s suggestions have generally been dismissed by subsequent research.

Some objects depicted in carvings from Karnataka, dating from the 12th century, that resemble ears of maize (&quot;Zea mays&quot;—a crop native to the New World), were interpreted by Carl Johannessen in 1989 as evidence of pre-Columbian contact. These suggestions were dismissed by multiple Indian researchers based on several lines of evidence. The object has been claimed by some to instead represent a &quot;Muktaphala&quot;, an imaginary fruit bedecked with pearls.

== Claims of African and West Asian contact ==
=== Claims of African contact ===
Proposed claims for an African presence in Mesoamerica stem from attributes of the Olmec culture, the claimed transfer of African plants to the Americas, and interpretations of European and Arabic historical accounts.

The Olmec culture existed in what is now southern Mexico from roughly 1200 BCE to 400 BCE. The idea that the Olmecs are related to Africans was first suggested by José Melgar, who discovered the first colossal head at Hueyapan (now Tres Zapotes) in 1862. More recently, Ivan Van Sertima speculated an African influence on Mesoamerican culture in his book &quot;They Came Before Columbus&quot; (1976). His claims included the attribution of Mesoamerican pyramids, calendar technology, mummification, and mythology to the arrival of Africans by boat on currents running from Western Africa to the Americas. Heavily inspired by Leo Wiener (see below), Van Sertima suggested that the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl represented an African visitor. His conclusions have been severely criticized by mainstream academics and considered pseudoarchaeology.

Leo Wiener&#x27;s &quot;Africa and the Discovery of America&quot; suggests similarities between the Mandinka people of West Africa and native Mesoamerican religious symbols such as the winged serpent and the sun disk, or Quetzalcoatl, and words that have Mandé roots and share similar meanings across both cultures, such as &quot;kore&quot;, &quot;gadwal&quot;, and &quot;qubila&quot; (in Arabic) or &quot;kofila&quot; (in Mandinka).

Malian sources describe what some consider to be visits to the New World by a fleet from the Mali Empire in 1311, led by Abu Bakr II. According to the only known primary-source-based copy of Christopher Columbus&#x27;s journal (transcribed by Bartolomé de las Casas), the purpose of Columbus&#x27;s third voyage was to test both (1) the claims of King John II of Portugal that &quot;canoes had been found which set out from the coast of Guinea [West Africa] and sailed to the west with merchandise&quot; and (2) the claims of the native inhabitants of the Caribbean island of Hispaniola that &quot;there had come to Española from the south and south-east, a black people who have the tops of their spears made of a metal which they call &quot;guanin&quot;, of which he had sent samples to the Sovereigns to have them assayed, when it was found that of 32 parts, 18 were of gold, 6 of silver and 8 of copper&quot;.

Brazilian researcher Niede Guidon, who led the excavations of the Pedra Furada sites, &quot;said she believed that humans...might have come not overland from Asia but by boat from Africa&quot;, with the journey taking place 100,000 years ago, well before the accepted dates for the earliest human migrations that led to the prehistoric settlement of the Americas. Michael R. Waters, a geoarchaeologist at Texas A&amp;M University, noted the absence of genetic evidence in modern populations to support Guidon&#x27;s claim.

=== Claims of Arab contact ===
Early Chinese accounts of Muslim expeditions state that Muslim sailors reached a region called Mulan Pi (&quot;magnolia skin&quot;) (). Mulan Pi is mentioned in &quot;Lingwai Daida&quot; (1178) by Zhou Qufei and &quot;Zhufan Zhi&quot; (1225) by Chao Jukua, together referred to as the &quot;Sung Document&quot;. Mulan Pi is normally identified as Spain and Morocco of the Almoravid dynasty (Al-Murabitun), though some fringe theories hold that it is instead some part of the Americas.

One supporter of the interpretation of Mulan Pi as part of the Americas was historian Hui-lin Li in 1961, and while Joseph Needham was also open to the possibility, he doubted that Arab ships at the time would have been able to withstand a return journey over such a long distance across the Atlantic Ocean, pointing out that a return journey would have been impossible without knowledge of prevailing winds and currents.
According to Muslim historian Abu al-Hasan Ali al-Mas&#x27;udi (871–957), Khashkhash Ibn Saeed Ibn Aswad sailed over the Atlantic Ocean and discovered a previously unknown land (&quot;&quot;, ) in 889 and returned with a shipload of valuable treasures. The passage has been alternatively interpreted to imply that Ali al-Masudi regarded the story of Khashkhash to be a fanciful tale.

=== Claims of ancient Phoenician contact ===

In 1996, Mark McMenamin proposed that Phoenician sailors discovered the New World c. 350 BC. The Phoenician state of Carthage minted gold staters in 350 BC bearing a pattern in the reverse exergue of the coins, which McMenamin initially interpreted as a map of the Mediterranean with the Americas shown to the west across the Atlantic. McMenamin later demonstrated that these coins found in America were modern forgeries.

=== Claims of ancient Judaic contact ===

The Bat Creek inscription and Los Lunas Decalogue Stone have led some to suggest the possibility that Jewish seafarers may have traveled to America after they fled from the Roman Empire at the time of the Jewish–Roman Wars in the 1st and 2nd centuries CE.

However, American archaeologists Robert C. Mainfort Jr. and Mary L. Kwas argued in &quot;American Antiquity&quot; (2004) that the Bat Creek inscription was copied from an illustration in an 1870 Masonic reference book and introduced by the Smithsonian field assistant who found it during excavation activities.

As for the Decalogue Stone, there are mistakes which suggest that it was carved by one or more novices who either overlooked or misunderstood some details on a source Decalogue from which they copied it. Since there is no other evidence or archaeological context in the vicinity, it is most likely that the legend at the nearby university is true—that the stone was carved by two anthropology students whose signatures can be seen inscribed in the rock below the Decalogue, &quot;Eva and Hobe 3-13-30.&quot;

Scholar Cyrus H. Gordon believed that Phoenicians and other Semitic-speaking groups had crossed the Atlantic in antiquity, ultimately arriving in both North and South America. This opinion was based on his own work on the Bat Creek inscription. Similar ideas were also held by John Philip Cohane; Cohane even claimed that many geographical placenames in the United States have a Semitic origin.

== Claims of European contact ==
=== Solutrean hypothesis ===
The Solutrean hypothesis argues that Europeans migrated to the New World during the Paleolithic era, circa 16,000 to 13,000 BCE. This hypothesis proposes contact partly on the basis of perceived similarities between the flint tools of the Solutrean culture in modern-day France, Spain and Portugal (which thrived circa 20,000 to 15,000 BCE), and the Clovis culture of North America, which developed circa 9000 BCE.
The Solutrean hypothesis was proposed in the mid-1990s. It has little support amongst the scientific community, and genetic markers are inconsistent with the idea.

=== Claims of ancient Roman contact ===
Evidence of contacts with the civilizations of Classical Antiquity—primarily with the Roman Empire, but sometimes also with other contemporaneous cultures—have been based on isolated archaeological finds in American sites that originated in the Old World. For example, the Bay of Jars in Brazil has been yielding ancient clay storage jars that resemble Roman amphorae for over 150 years. It has been proposed that the origin of these jars is a Roman shipwreck, although it has also been suggested that they could be 15th- or 16th-century Spanish olive oil jars.

Archaeologist Romeo Hristov argues that a Roman ship, or the drifting of such a shipwreck to American shores, is a possible explanation for the alleged discovery of artifacts that are apparently ancient Roman in origin (such as the Tecaxic-Calixtlahuaca bearded head) in America. Hristov claims that the possibility of such an event has been made more likely by the discovery of evidence of travels by Romans to Tenerife and Lanzarote in the Canary Islands, and of a Roman settlement (from the 1st century BCE to the 4th century CE) on Lanzarote.
In 1950, an Italian botanist, Domenico Casella, suggested that a depiction of a pineapple (a fruit native to the New World tropics) was represented among wall paintings of Mediterranean fruits at Pompeii. According to Wilhelmina Feemster Jashemski, this interpretation has been challenged by other botanists, who identify it as a pine cone from the umbrella pine tree, which is native to the Mediterranean area. The leaves shown in the depiction (as with stone carvings from Nineveh) make the pine cone identification problematic.

Roman and other European coins have been found in the United States. Jeremiah Epstein, an American anthropologist, rejected the suggestion that these coins can be cited as evidence of Pre-Columbian contact between Europe and the Americas pointing out the lack of any pre-Columbian archaeological contexts relating to these finds, the lack of detail concerning the discoveries, and the possibility of forgery (at least two were clearly forgeries).

==== Tecaxic-Calixtlahuaca head ====

A small terracotta sculpture of a head, with a beard and European-like features, was found in 1933 in the Toluca Valley, southwest of Mexico City, in a burial offering under three intact floors of a pre-colonial building dated to between 1476 and 1510. The artifact has been studied by Roman art authority Bernard Andreae, director emeritus of the German Institute of Archaeology in Rome, Italy, and Austrian anthropologist Robert von Heine-Geldern, both of whom stated that the style of the artifact was compatible with small Roman sculptures of the 2nd century. If genuine and if not placed there after 1492 (the pottery found with it dates to between 1476 and 1510), the find provides evidence for at least a one-time contact between the Old and New Worlds.

According to Arizona State University&#x27;s Michael E. Smith, a leading Mesoamerican scholar named John Paddock used to tell his classes in the years before he died that the artifact was planted as a joke by Hugo Moedano, a student who originally worked on the site. Despite speaking with individuals who knew the original discoverer (García Payón), and Moedano, Smith says he has been unable to confirm or reject this claim. Though he remains skeptical, Smith concedes he cannot rule out the possibility that the head was a genuinely buried post-Classic offering at Calixtlahuaca.

=== 14th- and 15th-century European contact ===

Henry I Sinclair, Earl of Orkney and feudal baron of Roslin (c. 1345 – c. 1400), was a Scottish nobleman who is best known today from a modern legend which claims that he took part in explorations of Greenland and North America almost 100 years before Christopher Columbus&#x27;s voyages to the Americas. In 1784, he was identified by Johann Reinhold Forster as possibly being the Prince Zichmni who is described in letters which were allegedly written around 1400 by the Zeno brothers of Venice, in which they describe a voyage which they made throughout the North Atlantic under the command of Zichmni. According to &quot;The Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online&quot;, &quot;the Zeno affair remains one of the most preposterous and at the same time one of the most successful fabrications in the history of exploration.&quot;

Henry was the grandfather of William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness, the builder of Rosslyn Chapel near Edinburgh, Scotland. The authors Robert Lomas and Christopher Knight believe some carvings in the chapel were intended to represent ears of New World corn or maize, a crop unknown in Europe at the time of the chapel&#x27;s construction. Knight and Lomas view these carvings as evidence supporting the idea that Henry Sinclair traveled to the Americas well before Columbus. In their book they discuss meeting with the wife of the botanist Adrian Dyer and explain that Dyer&#x27;s wife told them that Dyer agreed that the image thought to be maize was accurate. In fact Dyer found only one identifiable plant among the botanical carvings and instead suggested that the &quot;maize&quot; and &quot;aloe&quot; were stylized wooden patterns, only coincidentally looking like real plants. Specialists in medieval architecture have variously interpreted the carvings as stylised depictions of wheat, strawberries, or lilies.

Henry Yule Oldham suggested that the Bianco world map depicted part of the coast of Brazil before 1448. This was immediately opposed by members of the Royal Geographical Society but later repeated by American and European historians. This was later refuted by Abel Fontoura da Costa, who proved that it actually depicted Santiago, the largest island of the Cape Verde archipelago.
Some have conjectured that Columbus was able to persuade the Catholic Monarchs of Castile and Aragon to support his planned voyage only because they were aware of some recent earlier voyage across the Atlantic. Some suggest that Columbus himself visited Canada or Greenland before 1492, because according to Bartolomé de las Casas he wrote he had sailed 100 leagues past an island he called Thule in 1477. Whether Columbus actually did this and what island he visited, if any, is uncertain. Columbus is thought to have visited Bristol in 1476. Bristol was also the port from which John Cabot sailed in 1497, crewed mostly by Bristol sailors. In a letter of late 1497 or early 1498, the English merchant John Day wrote to Columbus about Cabot&#x27;s discoveries, saying that land found by Cabot was &quot;discovered in the past by the men from Bristol who found &#x27;Brasil&#x27; as your lordship knows&quot;. There may be records of expeditions from Bristol to find the &quot;isle of Brazil&quot; in 1480 and 1481. Trade between Bristol and Iceland is well documented from the mid-15th century.

Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés records several such legends in his &quot;Historia general de las Indias&quot; of 1526, which includes biographical information on Columbus. He discusses the then-current story of a Spanish caravel that was swept off its course while on its way to England, and wound up in a foreign land populated by naked tribesmen. The crew gathered supplies and made its way back to Europe, but the trip took several months and the captain and most of the men died before reaching land. The caravel&#x27;s ship pilot, a man called Alonso Sánchez, and a few others made it to Portugal, but all were very ill. Columbus was a good friend of the pilot, and took him to be treated in his own house, and the pilot described the land they had seen and marked it on a map before dying. People in Oviedo&#x27;s time knew this story in several versions, though Oviedo himself regarded it as a myth.

In 1925, Soren Larsen wrote a book claiming that a joint Danish-Portuguese expedition landed in Newfoundland or Labrador in 1473 and again in 1476. Larsen claimed that Didrik Pining and Hans Pothorst served as captains, while João Vaz Corte-Real and the possibly mythical John Scolvus served as navigators, accompanied by Álvaro Martins. Nothing beyond circumstantial evidence has been found to support Larsen&#x27;s claims.

The historical record shows that Basque fishermen were present in Newfoundland and Labrador from at least 1517 onward (therefore predating all recorded European settlements in the region except those of the Norse). The Basques&#x27; fishing expeditions led to significant trade and cultural exchanges with Native Americans. A fringe theory suggests that Basque sailors first arrived in North America prior to Columbus&#x27; voyages to the New World (some sources suggest the late 14th century as a tentative date) but kept the destination a secret in order to avoid competition over the fishing resources of the North American coasts. There is no historical or archaeological evidence to support this claim.

=== Irish and Welsh legends ===
The legend of Saint Brendan, an Irish monk from what is now County Kerry, involves a fantastical journey into the Atlantic Ocean in search of Paradise in the 6th century. Since the discovery of the New World, various authors have tried to link the Brendan legend with an early discovery of America. In 1977, the voyage was successfully recreated by Tim Severin using a replica of an ancient Irish currach.

According to a British myth, Madoc was a prince from Wales who explored the Americas as early as 1170. While most scholars consider this legend to be untrue, it was used to bolster British claims in the Americas vis-à-vis those of Spain.
The &quot;Madoc story&quot; remained popular in later centuries, and a later development asserted that Madoc&#x27;s voyagers had intermarried with local Native Americans, and that their Welsh-speaking descendants still live somewhere in the United States. These &quot;Welsh Indians&quot; were credited with the construction of a number of landmarks throughout the Midwestern United States, and a number of white travelers were inspired to go look for them. The &quot;Madoc story&quot; has been the subject of much speculation in the context of possible pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact. No conclusive archaeological proof of such a man or his voyages has been found in the New or Old World; however, speculation abounds connecting him with certain sites, such as Devil&#x27;s Backbone, located on the Ohio River at Fourteen Mile Creek near Louisville, Kentucky.

At Fort Mountain State Park in Georgia, a plaque formerly mentioned a 19th-century interpretation of the ancient stone wall that gives the site its name. The plaque repeated a claim by Tennessee governor John Sevier that Cherokees believed &quot;a people called Welsh&quot; had built a fort on the mountain long ago to repel Indian attacks. The plaque has been changed, leaving no reference to Madoc or the Welsh.

Biologist and controversial amateur epigrapher Barry Fell claims that Irish Ogham writing has been found carved into stones in the Virginias. Linguist David H. Kelley has criticized some of Fell&#x27;s work but nonetheless argued that genuine Celtic Ogham inscriptions have in fact been discovered in America. However, others have raised serious doubts about these claims.

== Claims of transoceanic travel originating in the New World ==
=== Claims of Egyptian coca and tobacco ===

Traces of coca and nicotine which are found in some Egyptian mummies have led to speculation that Ancient Egyptians may have had contact with the New World. The initial discovery was made by a German toxicologist Svetlana Balabanova after examining the mummy of a priestess named Henut Taui. Follow-up tests on the hair shaft, which were performed in order to rule out the possibility of contamination, revealed the same results.

A television show reported that examinations of numerous Sudanese mummies which were also undertaken by Balabanova mirrored what was found in the mummy of Henut Taui. Balabanova suggested that the tobacco may be accounted for since it may have also been known in China and Europe, as indicated by analyses run on human remains from those respective regions. Balabanova proposed that such plants native to the general area may have developed independently, but have since gone extinct. Other explanations include fraud, though curator Alfred Grimm of the Egyptian Museum in Munich disputes this. Skeptical of Balabanova&#x27;s findings, Rosalie David, Keeper of Egyptology at the Manchester Museum, had similar tests performed on samples which were taken from the Manchester mummy collection and she reported that two of the tissue samples and one hair sample tested positive for the presence of nicotine.

However, mainstream scholars remain skeptical, and they do not see the results of these tests as proof of ancient contact between Africa and the Americas, especially because there may be possible Old World sources of cocaine and nicotine. Two attempts to replicate Balabanova&#x27;s findings of cocaine failed, suggesting &quot;that either Balabanova and her associates are misinterpreting their results or that the samples of mummies tested by them have been mysteriously exposed to cocaine&quot;.

A re-examination of the mummy of Ramesses II in the 1970s revealed the presence of fragments of tobacco leaves in its abdomen. This finding became a popular topic in fringe literature and the media and it was seen as proof of contact between Ancient Egypt and the New World. The investigator Maurice Bucaille noted that when the mummy was unwrapped in 1886 the abdomen was left open and &quot;it was no longer possible to attach any importance to the presence inside the abdominal cavity of whatever material was found there, since the material could have come from the surrounding environment.&quot; Following the renewed discussion of tobacco sparked by Balabanova&#x27;s research and its mention in a 2000 publication by Rosalie David, a study in the journal &quot;Antiquity&quot; suggested that reports of both tobacco and cocaine in mummies &quot;ignored their post-excavation histories&quot; and pointed out that the mummy of Ramesses II had been moved five times between 1883 and 1975.

=== Claims of travel in Roman times ===
Pomponius Mela writes, and is copied by Pliny the Elder, that Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer (died 59 BCE), proconsul in Gaul, received &quot;several Indians&quot; (&quot;Indi&quot;) who had been driven by a storm to the coasts of Germania as a present from a foreign king, listed by Mela, in different manuscripts, as &quot;rege Boorum/Boiorum/Botorum&quot; and usually identified in recent scholarship as king of the Boii, though Tausend (1999) argued that it might be corrupted name of the Goths; Pliny identifies the king as the ruler of the Suebi instead:

&quot;Ultra Caspium sinum quidnam esset, ambiguum aliquamdiu fuit, idemne Oceanus an tellus infesta frigoribus sine ambitu ac sine fine proiecta. Sed praeter physicos Homerumque qui universum orbem mari circumfusum esse dixerunt, Cornelius Nepos ut recentior, auctoritate sic certior; testem autem rei Quintum Metellum Celerem adicit, eumque ita rettulisse commemorat: cum Galliae pro consule praeesset, Indos quosdam a rege Boiorum dono sibi datos; unde in eas terras devenissent requirendo cognosse, vi tempestatium ex Indicis aequoribus abreptos, emensosque quae intererant, tandem in Germaniae litora exisse. Restat ergo pelagus, sed reliqua lateris eiusdem adsiduo gelu durantur et ideo deserta sunt.&quot;

For a long time it was doubtful what there was beyond the Caspian bay: whether the same Ocean, or a land infested with cold, spreading out without circumference and boundless. But, in addition to the natural Philosophers and Homer, who have said that the whole universe was surrounded by sea, Cornelius Nepos, as more recent in authority and hence more certain, is available. Moreover he adds Quintus Metellus Celer as a witness to the fact, and asserts that he related this account: that while he was in charge of the Gauls as proconsul, certain Indians were given to him by a king of the Boii as a gift; and that in inquiring whence they had arrived into these regions, he learned that, driven from Indian waters by the violence of tempests, they had passed over the seas which intervened and finally had come through onto the shores of Germany. Therefore, there remains the sea, but the remaining places of this same side are held in the grip of continual cold and hence are deserted.
Both Mela and Pliny listed this incident as evidence supporting the notion that all lands of the world, including northern parts of Europe and Asia, are surrounded by Oceanus, and that it is theoretically possible to sail from India to Europe through a northern passage.

Since Metellus Celer died just after his consulship, before he ever got to Transalpine Gaul (in the area of present-day southern France), the authors accepting the historicity of the incident either date it to 62 BCE, when Celer was governing Cisalpine Gaul (in the area of present-day northern Italy), or interpret texts of Mela and Pliny as garbled accounts of Celer&#x27;s encounter with some Indians at an earlier date, when he served as Pompey&#x27;s legate in Asia.

Richard Hennig suggested that the castaways mentioned by Mela and Pliny were possibly American Indians. Other interpretations of the incident were also proposed. Bengtson (1954), McLaughlin (2016) and Lerner (2020) argued that Celer might have encountered actual merchants from India, who reached Europe from Phasis on the Black Sea coast. Other authors interpret supposed Indians as misidentified speakers of Finno-Ugric languages originating from the areas east of the Bothnian Bay or Baltic Veneti. An article in the &quot;Journal of the American Geographical Society of New York&quot; published in 1891 suggests that the word &quot;Indos&quot; is so indefinite as to be subject to speculation, and that copyist errors may have changed &quot;Jernos&quot; (Irish) or &quot;Iberos&quot; (Spaniards) to Indos.

=== Icelander DNA finding ===
In 2010, Sigríður Sunna Ebenesersdóttir published a genetic study showing that over 350 living Icelanders carried mitochondrial DNA of a new type, C1e, belonging to the C1 clade which was until then known only from Native American and East Asian populations. Using the deCODE genetics database, Sigríður Sunna determined that the DNA entered the Icelandic population not later than 1700, and likely several centuries earlier. However Sigríður Sunna also states that &quot;while a Native American origin seems most likely for [this new haplogroup], an Asian or European origin cannot be ruled out&quot;.

In 2014, a study discovered a new mtDNA subclade C1f from the remains of three people found in north-western Russia and dated to 7,500 years ago. It has not been detected in modern populations. The study proposed the hypothesis that the sister C1e and C1f subclades had split early from the most recent common ancestor of the C1 clade and had evolved independently, and that subclade C1e had a northern European origin. Iceland was settled by the Vikings in the 9th century and they had raided heavily into western Russia, where the sister subclade C1f is now known to have resided. They proposed that both subclades were brought to Iceland through the Vikings, and that C1e went extinct on mainland northern Europe due to population turnover and its small representation, and subclade C1f went extinct completely.

=== Norse legends and sagas ===

In 1009, legends report that Norse explorer Thorfinn Karlsefni abducted two children from Markland, an area on the North American mainland where Norse explorers visited but did not settle. The two children were then taken to Greenland, where they were baptized and taught to speak Norse.

In 1420, Danish geographer Claudius Clavus Swart wrote that he personally had seen &quot;pygmies&quot; from Greenland who were caught by Norsemen in a small skin boat. Their boat was hung in Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim along with another, longer boat also taken from &quot;pygmies&quot;. Clavus Swart&#x27;s description fits the Inuit and two of their types of boats, the kayak and the umiak. Similarly, the Swedish clergyman Olaus Magnus wrote in 1505 that he saw in Oslo Cathedral two leather boats taken decades earlier. According to Olaus, the boats were captured from Greenland pirates by one of the Haakons, which would place the event in the 14th century.

In Ferdinand Columbus&#x27;s biography of his father Christopher, he says that in 1477 his father saw in Galway, Ireland, two dead bodies which had washed ashore in their boat. The bodies and boat were of exotic appearance, and have been suggested to have been Inuit who had drifted off course.

=== Claims of Inuit travel to the Old World ===
It has been suggested that the Norse took other indigenous peoples to Europe as slaves over the following centuries, because they are known to have taken Scottish and Irish slaves.

There is also evidence of Inuit coming to Europe under their own power or as captives after 1492. In Scotland, they were known as the Finn-men. A substantial body of Greenland Inuit folklore first collected in the 19th century told of journeys by boat to Akilineq, depicted as a rich country across the ocean.

=== Claims of Inca travel to Oceania ===
Peruvian historian José Antonio del Busto Duthurburu popularized the theory that Inca ruler Topa Inca Yupanqui may have led a maritime exploration voyage across the Pacific Ocean around 1465, eventually reaching French Polynesia and Rapa Nui (Easter Island). Different Spanish chroniclers of the 16th century recount stories told to them by Inca peoples, in which Yupanqui embarked on a sea voyage, eventually reaching two islands referred to as &quot;Nina Chumpi&quot; (&quot;fire belt&quot;) and &quot;Hawa Chumpi&quot; (&quot;outer belt&quot;, also spelled &quot;Avachumpi, Hahua chumpi&quot;). According to the stories, Yupanqui returned from the expedition bringing back with him black-skinned people, gold, a chair made of brass, and the skin of a horse or an animal similar to a horse. Del Busto speculated the &quot;black-skinned people&quot; may have been Melanesians, while the animal skin may have belonged to a Polynesian wild boar that was misidentified. Critics have pointed out that Yupanqui&#x27;s expedition—assuming it ever took place—could have reached the Galápagos Islands or some other part of the Americas instead of Oceania.

== Claims based on religious traditions or symbols ==
=== Claims of pre-Columbian contact with Christian voyagers ===
During the period of Spanish colonization of the Americas, several indigenous myths and works of art led a number of Spanish chroniclers and authors to suggest that Christian preachers may have visited Mesoamerica well before the Age of Discovery. Bernal Díaz del Castillo, for example, was intrigued by the presence of cross symbols in Maya hieroglyphs, which according to him suggested that other Christians may have arrived in ancient Mexico before the Spanish conquistadors. Fray Diego Durán, for his part, linked the legend of the Pre-Columbian god Quetzalcoatl (whom he describes as being chaste, penitent, and a miracle-worker) to the Biblical accounts of Christian apostles. Bartolomé de las Casas describes Quetzalcoatl as being fair-skinned, tall, and bearded (therefore suggesting an Old World origin), while Fray Juan de Torquemada credits him with bringing agriculture to the Americas. Modern scholarship has cast serious doubts on several of these claims, since agriculture was practiced in the Americas well before the emergence of Christianity in the Old World, and Maya crosses have been found to have a very different symbolism from that present in Christian religious traditions.

According to Pre-Columbian myth, Quetzalcoatl departed Mexico in ancient times by travelling east across the ocean, promising he would return. Some scholars have argued that Aztec emperor Moctezuma Xocoyotzin believed Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés (who arrived in what today is Mexico from the east) to be Quetzalcoatl, and his arrival to be a fulfilling of the myth&#x27;s prophecy, though others have disputed this claim. Fringe theories suggest that Quetzalcoatl may have been a Christian preacher from the Old World who lived among indigenous peoples of ancient Mexico, and eventually attempted to return home by sailing eastwards. Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora, for example, speculated that the Quetzalcoatl myth might have originated from a visit to the Americas by Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century CE. Later on, Fray Servando Teresa de Mier argued that the cloak with the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, which the Catholic Church claims was worn by Juan Diego, was instead brought to the Americas much earlier by Thomas, who used it as an instrument for evangelization.

Mexican historian Manuel Orozco y Berra conjectured that both the cross hieroglyphs and the Quetzalcoatl myth might have originated on a visit to Mesoamerica by a Catholic Norse missionary in medieval times. However, there is no archaeological or historical evidence to suggest that the Norse explorations ever made it as far as ancient Mexico or Central America. Other proposed identities for Quetzalcoatl (attributed to their proponents pursuing religious agendas) include St. Brendan or even Jesus Christ.

A popular thread of conspiracy theory originating with &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot; has it that the Templars used a fleet of 18 ships at La Rochelle to escape arrest in France. The fleet allegedly left laden with knights and treasures just before the issue of the warrant for the arrest of the Order in October 1307. This, in turn, was based on a single item of testimony from serving brother Jean de Châlon, who says he had &quot;heard people talking that [Gerard de Villiers had] put to sea with 18 galleys, and the brother Hugues de Chalon fled with the whole treasury of the brother Hugues de Pairaud.&quot; However, aside from being the sole source for this statement, the transcript indicates that it is hearsay, and this serving brother seems to be prone to making some of the wildest and most damning of claims about the Order, which have led some to doubt his credibility. What destination, if any, was reached by this fleet is uncertain. A fringe theory suggests the fleet may have made its way to the Americas, where the Knights Templar interacted with the aboriginal population. Helen Nicholson of Cardiff University has cast doubt on the existence of this voyage, arguing that the Knights Templar did not have ships capable of navigating the Atlantic Ocean.

=== Claims of ancient Jewish migration to the Americas ===

Since the first centuries of European colonization of the Americas and up until the 19th century, several European intellectuals and theologians tried to account for the presence of the Amerindian aboriginal peoples by connecting them to the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, who according to Biblical tradition, were deported following the conquest of the Israelite kingdom by the Neo-Assyrian Empire. In the past as well as in the present, these efforts were and still are being used to further the interests of religious groups, both Jewish and Christian, and they have also been used to justify European settlement of the Americas.

One of the first people to claim that the indigenous peoples of the Americas were descendants of the Lost Tribes was the Portuguese rabbi and writer Menasseh Ben Israel (1604-1657), who in his book &quot;The Hope of Israel&quot; argued that the discovery of the alleged long-lost Jews heralded the imminent coming of the Biblical Messiah. In 1650, a Norfolk preacher, Thomas Thorowgood, published &quot;Jewes in America or Probabilities that the Americans are of that Race&quot;, for the New England missionary society. Tudor Parfitt writes:The society was active in trying to convert the Indians but suspected that they might be Jews and realized they better be prepared for an arduous task. Thorowgood&#x27;s tract argued that the native population of North America were descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes.

In 1652 Sir Hamon L&#x27;Estrange, an English author writing on history and theology, published &quot;Americans no Jews, or improbabilities that the Americans are of that Race&quot; in response to the tract by Thorowgood. In response to L&#x27;Estrange, Thorowgood published a second edition of his book in 1660 with a revised title and included a foreword written by John Eliot, a Puritan missionary who had translated the Bible into an Indian language.

Elias Boudinot, a signatory to the U.S. Declaration of Independence, made similar claims in his 1816 book titled &quot;A Star in the West: A Humble Attempt to Discover the Long Lost Ten Tribes of Israel; Preparatory to Their Return to Their Beloved City, Jerusalem&quot;.

=== Latter Day Saint movement&#x27;s teachings ===
The Book of Mormon, a sacred text of the Latter Day Saint movement, states that some ancient inhabitants of the New World are descendants of Semitic peoples who sailed from the Old World. Mormon groups such as the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies attempt to study and expand on these ideas.

In a 1998 letter to the Institute for Religious Research, the National Geographic Society stated that &quot;Archaeologists and other scholars have long probed the hemisphere&#x27;s past and the society does not know of anything found so far that has substantiated the Book of Mormon.&quot;

Some LDS scholars hold the view that archaeological studies of the Book of Mormon&#x27;s claims are not meant to vindicate the literary narrative. For example, Terryl Givens, professor of English at the University of Richmond, points out that there is a lack of historical accuracy in the Book of Mormon in relation to modern archaeological knowledge.

In the 1950s, Professor M. Wells Jakeman popularized the belief that the Izapa Stela 5 represents the Book of Mormon prophets Lehi and Nephi&#x27;s tree of life vision and was a validation of the historicity of the claims of pre-Columbian settlement in the Americas. His interpretations of the carving and its connection to pre-Columbian contact have been disputed. Since that time, scholarship on the Book of Mormon has concentrated on cultural parallels rather than &quot;smoking gun&quot; sources.

<text>An antiemetic is a drug that is effective against vomiting and nausea. Antiemetics are typically used to treat motion sickness and the side effects of opioid analgesics, general anaesthetics, and chemotherapy directed against cancer. They may be used for severe cases of gastroenteritis, especially if the patient is dehydrated.

Some antiemetics previously thought to cause birth defects appear safe for use by pregnant women in the treatment of morning sickness and the more serious hyperemesis gravidarum.

==Types==
* 5-HT3 receptor antagonists block serotonin receptors in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. As such, they can be used to treat post-operative and cytotoxic drug nausea &amp; vomiting. However, they can also cause constipation, dry mouth, and fatigue.
** Dolasetron (Anzemet) can be administered in tablet form or in an injection.
** Granisetron (Kytril, Sancuso) can be administered in tablet (Kytril), oral solution (Kytril), injection (Kytril), or in a single transdermal patch to the upper arm (SANCUSO).
** Ondansetron (Zofran) is administered in an oral tablet form, orally dissolving tablet form, orally dissolving film, sublingual, or in an IV/IM injection.
** Tropisetron (Setrovel, Navoban) can be administered in oral capsules or in injection form.
** Palonosetron (Aloxi) can be administered in an injection or in oral capsules.
* Dopamine antagonists block dopamine receptors on the brainstem and gastrointestinal tract. They are used to treat nausea and vomiting associated with cancer, radiation sickness, opioids, cytotoxic drugs and general anaesthetics. Side effects include restlessness and tardive dyskinesia.
** Amisulpride (Barhemsys), administered by intravenous injection.
** Domperidone (Motilium)
** Droperidol
** Olanzapine (Zyprexa)
** Haloperidol (limited in usefulness by extra-pyramidal and sedative side-effects)
** Alizapride
** Prochlorperazine (Compazine, Stemzine, Buccastem, Stemetil, Phenotil)
** Chlorpromazine (Use limited by sedating properties)
** Metoclopramide
* NK1 receptor antagonist which block NK1, also known as substance P. They are typically only used in the context of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting.
** Aprepitant (Emend) is a commercially available NK1 receptor antagonist
** Casopitant is an investigational NK1 receptor antagonist
** Rolapitant (Varubi) another recently approved drug from this class
* Antihistamines (H1 histamine receptor antagonists) are effective in many conditions, including motion sickness, morning sickness in pregnancy, and to combat opioid nausea. H1 receptors in central areas include area postrema and vomiting center in the vestibular nucleus. Also, many of the antihistamines listed here also block muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. They are known to cause significant sedation.
** Cinnarizine (UK only)
** Cyclizine
** Diphenhydramine (Benadryl)
** Dimenhydrinate (Gravol, Dramamine)
** Doxylamine (Bonjesta, Unisom)
** Mirtazapine (Remeron) is an antidepressant that also has antiemetic effects. It is a potent histamine H1 receptor antagonist, Ki=1.6 nM, and also exhibits notable 5-HT3 antagonism.
** Meclizine (Bonine, Antivert)
** Promethazine (Pentazine, Phenergan, Promacot) can be administered via a rectal suppository, intravenous injection, oral tablet or oral suspension for adults and children over 2 years of age.
** Hydroxyzine (Vistaril)
* Cannabinoids are used in patients with cachexia, cytotoxic nausea, and vomiting, or who are unresponsive to other agents. These may cause changes in perception, dizziness, and loss of coordination.
** Cannabis, also known as medical marijuana in the United States, is a Schedule I drug.
** Nabilone
** Dronabinol (Marinol/Syndros) is a Schedule II drug in the U.S. when in an oral solution (Syndros), and Schedule III when in sesame oil and encapsulated in a soft gelatin capsule (Marinol).
** Some synthetic cannabinoids such as Nabilone (Cesamet) or the JWH series.
** Sativex is an oral spray containing THC and CBD. It is currently legal in Canada and a few countries in Europe and the US 
* Benzodiazepines (GABA receptor positive allosteric modulators)
** Midazolam (Versed) is given at the onset of anesthesia and has been shown in recent trials to be as effective as ondansetron, but most effective when used in combination with ondansetron.
** Lorazepam (Ativan) is said to be very good as an adjunct treatment for nausea along with first line medications such as Compazine. 
* Anticholinergics
** Hyoscine (also known as scopolamine)
** Atropine
* Steroids
** Dexamethasone (Decadron) is given in low dose at the onset of a general anesthetic as an effective antiemetic. It is also used in chemotherapy as a single drug as well as with other antiemetics such as 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and NK1 receptor antagonist, but the specific mechanism of action is not fully understood.
* Other
** Trimethobenzamide is thought to work on the CTZ
** Ginger contains 5-HT3 antagonists gingerols, shogaols, and galanolactone. Preliminary clinical data suggests ginger may be effective for treatment of nausea and/or vomiting in a number of settings.
** Emetrol is also claimed to be an effective antiemetic.
** Propofol is given intravenously. It has been used in an acute care setting in hospital as a rescue therapy for emesis.
** Muscimol is purported to have antiemetic activity.
** Ajwain is purported to be antiemetic. It is a popular spice in India, Ethiopia and Eritrea.

<text>Radical Faeries are a loosely affiliated worldwide network and countercultural movement blending queer consciousness and secular spirituality. Sharing various aspects with neopaganism, the movement also adopts elements from anarchism and environmentalism. Rejecting hetero-imitation, the Radical Faerie movement began during the 1970s sexual revolution among gay men in the United States. Gay activists Harry Hay, Mitch Walker, Don Kilhefner, and John Burnside organized the first Spiritual Conference for Radical Faeries in September 1979. 

The network subsequently evolved alongside queer rights expansions, engaging with eclectic constructs and rituals while challenging commercialized and patriarchal aspects of modern LGBTQ+ life. Faeries tend to be fiercely independent, anti-establishment, and community-focused. Contemporary Radical Faeries embody a wide range of genders, sexual orientations, and identities. 

==Philosophy and ritual==
Hay&#x27;s biographer Stuart Timmons described the Faeries as a &quot;mixture of a political alternative, a counter-culture, and a spirituality movement.&quot; Peter Hennan asserted that the Faeries contained elements of &quot;Marxism, feminism, paganism, Native American and New Age spirituality, anarchism, the mythopoetic men&#x27;s movement, radical individualism, the therapeutic culture of self-fulfillment and self-actualization, earth-based movements in support of sustainable communities, spiritual solemnity coupled with a camp sensibility, gay liberation and drag.&quot;

The Radical Faerie movement was a reaction against the social emptiness that many gay men felt was present both in the heterosexual establishment and the assimilationist gay community. As one Faerie commented, in his opinion mainstream gay culture was &quot;an oppressive parody of straight culture&quot;, taking place primarily in bars and not encouraging people to &quot;form bonds or care for each other&quot;. In contrast, the Faeries &quot;live their sexuality in a way that is very connected to the earth.&quot;
Faeries represent the first spiritual movement to be both &quot;gay centered and gay engendered&quot;, where gayness is central to the idea, rather than in addition to, or incidental to a pre-existing spiritual tradition. The Radical Faerie exploration of the &quot;gay spirit&quot; is central, and that it is itself the source of spirituality, wisdom, and initiation. Mitch Walker claims that &quot;because of its indigenous, gay-centered nature, the Radical Faerie movement pioneers a new seriousness about gayness, its depth and potential, thereby heralding a new stage in the meaning of Gay Liberation.&quot;

In keeping with hippie, neopagan, and ecofeminist trends of the time, gatherings were held out-of-doors in natural settings. To this end, distinct Radical Faerie communities have created sanctuaries that are &quot;close to the land&quot;.

==History==
===Foundation: 1978–79===

Hay was a veteran of gay rights activism, having been a longstanding activist in the Communist Party USA prior to becoming a founding member of the Mattachine Society in 1950. After being publicly exposed as a Marxist in 1953, Hay stepped down from the Society&#x27;s leadership, shortly before the other founders were forced to resign by more conservative members.

Kilhefner was a skilled community organizer and a main member of the Los Angeles branch of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF). He began hosting gay reading groups called, &quot;Gay Voices and Visions&quot; in 1975 at the new center Kilhefner founded, The Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center, later renamed The Los Angeles LGBT Center, where he served as its first executive director, and which is now the largest in the world.

Walker had written and published many works on gay mysticism, sexuality, depth psychology and liberation, including an article published in the Jungian journal Spring in 1976, The Double: An Archetypal Configuration, a book, &quot;Men Loving Men, A Gay Sex Guide and Consciousness Book”, published in 1977, and he was in the process of conjuring what was to become &quot;Visionary Love, A Spirit Book of Gay Mythology and Transmutational Faerie&quot;, published in 1980. Walker went on to spearhead a pioneering gay-centered psychologically minded grassroots movement through conducting hundreds of workshops, groups and work with many individuals.

The idea for a spiritual conference for gay consciousness exploration came out of Walker&#x27;s deeply inspired correspondence with Hay beginning in 1976 and culminating a year and a half later when Walker flew to the desert to visit him in early 1978. Timmons writes: &quot;Meeting Walker was a critical link in Harry&#x27;s development of a new kind of gay movement...Walker and Hay formed the &#x27;society of two&#x27; that grew into the Radical Faeries. The mythic, hidden aspects of gay identity that they had studied separately suddenly converged, with greatly increased current.&quot; After Hay and Walker were joined by Kilhefner in successfully presenting a workshop together in the Fall of 1978, &quot;Hay told Walker that with &#x27;this magnificent organizer,&#x27; Don Kilhefner, they were now a society of three. Their dreamed-of conference could now proceed.&quot;

Raised into an Amish Mennonite community, Kilhefner had studied at Howard University where he joined the anti-Vietnam War movement and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. After university, he spent time in Ethiopia with the Peace Corps before joining the Peace and Freedom Party and becoming a leading figure in the GLF from 1969 to 1971. As the GLF evolved into the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center, Kilhefner became its first executive director. As it grew, it sought the support of wealthy gay people to finance its social work and public relations, with Kilhefner becoming concerned at its increasingly assimilationist stance and taking a leave of absence in 1976. He proceeded to enter into a retreat run by Baba Ram Dass, where he got into an extended conversation with Hay in May 1978.

In 2019, forty years after the fact and into his eighties, Kilhefner claimed that the Radical Faerie movement came out of conversations between Harry and him alone beginning in 1973 about &quot;the course of the Gay Liberation movement and what was missing.&quot; Kilhefner went on to further claim that the &quot;intellectual and spiritual foundation came out of workshops [he] hosted in 1975-1981 called Gay Voices and Visions,&quot; while completely avoiding acknowledging Walker’s central role in the forming of that foundation within the Radical Faerie movement. Kilhefner&#x27;s claims directly contradict Timmons&#x27; more objective interviews with the principle players, interviews that occurred while things were actually unfolding, and who directly quoted Hay stating that it was he and Walker who initially formed the &quot;&#x27;society of two&#x27; that grew into the Radical Faeries.&quot;

In the autumn of 1978 therapist Betty Berzon invited Hay, Walker, Burnside and Kilhefner to lead a workshop on &quot;New Breakthroughs in the Nature of How We Perceive Gay Consciousness&quot; at the annual conference of the Gay Academic Union, held at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. This event convinced Hay and his partner John Burnside that they should leave their home in New Mexico and move to Los Angeles, where they settled into a 1920s house on the eastern edge of Hollywood. The four then decided to organize an outdoor conference at which they could discuss with other gay men ideas regarding gay consciousness and spirituality. Kilhefner identified an ideal location from an advert in &quot;The Advocate&quot;; the Sri Ram Ashram was a gay-friendly spiritual retreat in the desert near Benson, Arizona, owned by an American named Swami Bill. Hay, Walker, Burnside and Kilhefner visited to check its suitability, and although Hay disliked Bill and didn&#x27;t want to use the site, Kilhefner insisted.
Their conference, set for Labor Day 1979, was to be called the &quot;Spiritual Conference for Radical Fairies&quot;, with the term &quot;Radical Faerie&quot; having been coined by Hay. The term &quot;Radical&quot; was chosen to reflect both political extremity and the idea of &quot;root&quot; or &quot;essence&quot;, while the term &quot;Faerie&quot; was chosen in reference both to the immortal animistic spirits of European folklore and to the fact that &quot;fairy&quot; had become a pejorative slang term for gay men. Initially, Hay rejected the term &quot;movement&quot; when discussing the Radical Faeries, considering it to instead be a &quot;way of life&quot; for gay males, and he began referring to it as a &quot;not-movement&quot;. In organising the event, Hay handled the political issues, Burnside the logistics and mechanics, Kilhefner the budgetary and administrative side, and Walker was to be its spiritual leader. A flier, which Kilhefner claims to have written, advertising the event was released and proclaimed that gays had a place in the &quot;paradigm shift&quot; of the New Age, and quoted Mark Satin and Aleister Crowley alongside Hay; these fliers were sent out to gay and leftist bookstores as well as gay community centres and health food stores.

Around 220 men turned up to the event, despite the fact that the Ashram could only accommodate around 75. Hay gave a welcoming speech in which he outlined his ideas regarding Subject-SUBJECT consciousness, calling on those assembled to &quot;throw off the ugly green frogskin of hetero-imitation to find the shining Faerie prince beneath&quot;. Rather than being referred to as &quot;workshops&quot;, the events that took place were known as &quot;Faerie circles&quot;, and were on such varied subjects as massage, nutrition, local botany, healing energy, the politics of gay enspiritment, English country dancing, and auto-fellatio. Those assembled took part in spontaneous rituals, providing invocations to spirits and performing blessings and chants, with most participants discarding the majority of their clothes, instead wearing feathers, beads, and bells, and decorating themselves in rainbow makeup. Many reported feeling a change of consciousness during the event, which one person there described as &quot;a four day acid trip – without the acid!&quot;. On the final night of the gathering, they put together a performance of the Symmetricon, an invention of Burnside&#x27;s, while Hay gave a farewell speech.

===Growth, friction, and split: 1979–80===

After Hay and the others returned to Los Angeles, they received messages of thanks from various participants, many of whom asked when the next Faerie gathering would be. Hay decided to found a Faerie circle in Los Angeles that met at their house, which became known as &quot;Faerie Central&quot;, devoting half their time to serious discussion and the other half to recreation, in particular English circle dancing. As more joined the circle, they began meeting in West Hollywood&#x27;s First Presbyterian Church and then the olive grove atop the hill at Barnsdall Park; however they found it difficult to gain the same change of consciousness that had been present at the rural gathering. The group began to discuss what the Faerie movement was developing into; Hay encouraged them to embark on political activism, using Marxism and his Subject-SUBJECT consciousness theory as a framework for bringing about societal change. Others however wanted the movement to focus on spirituality and exploring the psyche, lambasting politics as part of &quot;the straight world&quot;. Another issue of contention was over what constituted a &quot;Faerie&quot;; Hay had an idealized image of what someone with &quot;gay consciousness&quot; thought and acted like, and turned away some prospective members of the Circle because he disagreed with their views. One prospective member, the gay theatre director John Callaghan, joined the circle in February 1980, but was soon ejected by Hay after he voiced concern about hostility toward heterosexuals among the group.

The second Faerie gathering took place in August 1980 in Estes Park near Boulder, Colorado. Twice as long and almost twice as large as the first, it became known as Faery Woodstock. It also exhibited an increasing influence from the U.S. Pagan movement, as Faeries incorporated elements from Evans&#x27; &quot;Witchcraft and the Gay Counterculture&quot; and Starhawk&#x27;s &quot;The Spiral Dance&quot; into their practices. At that gathering, Dennis Melba&#x27;son presented a shawl that he had created with a crocheted depiction of the Northwest European Iron Age deity Cernunnos on it; the shawl became an important symbol of the Faeries, and would be sent from gathering to gathering over subsequent decades. There, Hay publicly revealed the founding trio&#x27;s desire for the creation of a permanent residential Faerie community, where they could grow their own crops and thus live self-sustainably. This project would involve setting up a non-profit corporation to purchase property under a community land trust with tax-exempt status. They were partly inspired by a pre-existing gay collective in rural Tennessee, Short Mountain. The gathering was also attended by an increasing number of men from outside of America, particularly Canada, but also from Australia, Norway, France and Germany, many of whom returned to their countries of origin to establish Faerie communes, such as the Wellington Boot, Common Ground etc. in Australia.
There was some antagonism between Hay and Walker from the beginning of their venture, due to Walker&#x27;s concern about addressing unconscious power issues, &quot;the shadow,&quot; in his preferred Jungian psychological orientation. Walker saw analytical psychology as central to his world view and believed that it could be utilized to aid in the liberation of gay men, whereas Hay was suspicious and disdainful of it. As the Los Angeles Circle grew, Kilhefner also became annoyed with Hay over the latter&#x27;s tendency to dominate conversations both in and out of the Circle, as well as his proselytizing attitude. Kilhefner came to agree with Walker about the seriousness of Hay&#x27;s failure to address unconscious power issues. At the 1980 gathering, Walker, frustrated with Hay&#x27;s dominating personality, formed the &quot;Faerie Fascist Police&quot; on the outskirts of the camp to combat &quot;Faerie fascism&quot; and &quot;power-tripping&quot; within the Faeries. He specifically targeted Hay: &quot;I recruited people to spy on Harry and see when he was manipulating people, so we could undo his undermining of the scene.&quot;

At a winter 1980 gathering in southern Oregon designed to discuss acquiring land for a Faerie sanctuary, Walker brought his close friend, Chris Kilbourne, and two other members, Sai and David, brought Ion. Hay, Kilhefner and Burnside were outraged at being challenged with having a closed circle and acted as if Kilbourne and Ion did not exist, a terribly difficult situation for them, especially as ten people were holed-up in a small house in the pouring rain, for six days. Finally, Kilbourne couldn&#x27;t take the hypocrisy of the three leaders and confronted Harry about the power dynamics within the core circle. In the ensuing conflict, the core circle splintered. Plans for the land sanctuary stalled and a separate circle formed. The core circle made an attempt to reconcile, but at a meeting that came to be known as &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;, Kilhefner quit along with Walker, accusing Hay and Burnside of &quot;power tripping&quot;. Walker and Kilhefner formed a new Los Angeles-based gay spiritual and psychological group called Treeroots which promoted a form of grassroots gay consciousness and ceremonial magic, coupled with a Jungian psychological perspective to assist in the healing and liberation of gay men.

However, despite the division among its founders, the Radical Faerie movement continued to grow, largely as a result of its anti-authoritarian structure, with many participants being unaware of the conflict regarding disowned power agendas. Walker and Kilbourne also continued to be involved in Southern California gatherings for many years, and began offering workshops on the problem of the Gay Shadow, with titles such as &quot;Gay Soul-Making&quot; and &quot;Coming Out Inside&quot;, as well as on gay men&#x27;s dream analysis. These workshops stirred up controversy due to some participants&#x27; difficulty with their message of gay spirit as a sacred alchemical process involving confrontation with and transformation of insidious internalized homophobia. Kilhefner and Walker had formed Treeroots specifically to address such matters in a new organizational effort. Treeroots to this day continues to sponsor events. Kilhefner eventually resigned from Treeroots in 1994 because he disagreed with Walker&#x27;s insistence that the organizers honestly address their psychological issues with each other, while Kilhefner was adamant about keeping his issues private.

An effort to exclude Walker and Kilbourne from all Radical Faerie gatherings was controversially attempted in the early 1990s and, to this day, some anti-psychological individuals, now including Kilhefner as well, attempt to completely erase Walker from his pivotal role in the original conceptualizing and organizing efforts of the Radical Faeries, and also attempt to erase their own historical participation in those pro-psychological efforts. Hay himself continued to be welcomed at gatherings, coming to be seen as an in some peoples&#x27; eyes, and a patronized mascot in others.

In 1998, in an ironic reversal toward Walker&#x27;s position, Hay finally acknowledged in the gay paper Frontiers that his focus had shifted to &quot;concentrating on removing the self-loathing that most gay men find themselves born into,&quot; that most gay men are &quot;saturated with,&quot; and which is &quot;the big thing that&#x27;s facing us all at the present time.&quot;

===Since 1981===

The first Faerie gathering in Australia was held in January 1981, at Tony Newman&#x27;s Whole Earth Dream Farm near Ourimbah (established in 1974), inspired by the &quot;RFD&quot; reporting of the second Faerie gathering (in Colorado), and held in conjunction with Sydney&#x27;s Gay Men&#x27;s Rap, although this first gathering did not generate any ongoing Faerie activity. A subsequent and unconnected Faerie gathering was held on 9–12 April 1982, at Mandala, a gay spiritual commune established near Uki in Northern NSW in 1974 by David Johnstone. This second gathering included Faeries who had attended the second and third gatherings in the United States, and led to continued growth of the Radical Faeries in Australia, and repeated attempts to establish Faerie communes, such as Common Ground (Clarence River Valley), and eventually the ongoing commune Faerieland, near Nimbin, NSW.

Guided by Mica Kindman, Lloyd Fair, Cass Brayton, and Will Roscoe, the San Francisco Faerie Circle had formed a non-profit corporation under the name of NOMENUS (varyingly interpreted as &quot;No Men Us&quot;, &quot;No Menace&quot;, and &quot;No Menus&quot;), supported by Hay. They raised enough money to put a down payment on some land from a 1983 gathering in Napa, however decided against forming a self-sufficient community, instead choosing to purchase a smaller piece of land that could be stationed by a few caretakers and which could house regular gatherings. In 1987 they purchased Magdalene Farm – an 80-acre property near Grant&#x27;s Pass, Oregon – from George Jalbert, who had unsuccessfully hoped to establish his own rural gay commune there over the preceding decade.

Throughout the 1980s the Radical Faerie movement had spread out from the United States and had gatherings in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Italy, as well as Folleterre in France.

Black Leather Wings is an organization for spiritual gay leather folk affiliated with the Radical Faeries. The San Francisco South of Market Leather History Alley includes bronze boot prints that honor 28 people important to the local leather communities, including Mark Thompson, a co-founder of Black Leather Wings, and Alexis Sorel, a Black Leather Wings member.

==Sanctuaries and gatherings==
Rural land or urban buildings where Faeries come together to live a communal life are called sanctuaries, which may host gatherings from time to time.

Faerie sanctuaries adapt rural living and environmentally sustainable ways of using modern technologies as part of creative expression. Radical Faerie communities are sometimes inspired by secular pagan or secular spiritual practices, especially those that incorporate genderqueer sensibilities.

Sanctuaries and gatherings are generally open to all, though specific gatherings may focus on the particular spiritual experience of man-loving men co-creating temporary autonomous zones.

==Cultural influence==
Participants at the 1979 Faerie gathering helped establish the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence in San Francisco that same year.

In the late 1990s Faeries sustained the New York City Drag March, an activist event held the Friday before the corporate-sponsored NYC Pride March. The Drag March began in 1994 in response to attempts to ban leather and drag during festivities marking the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.

The &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; episode &quot;Stand Up for Ourselves&quot; features a storyline where the characters Emmett and Michael attend a rural gathering to discover their &quot;inner Faerie.&quot;

Faeries were a contributing influence to the 2006 John Cameron Mitchell film &quot;Shortbus&quot;, including the casting of performance artist Justin Vivian Bond.

Taylor Mac invokes &quot;Radical Faerie realness ritual&quot; during performances.

<doc id="158696" wikidata="Q1414221" url="?curid=158696" title="Roland TR-808">
<text>The Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer, commonly known as the 808, is a drum machine manufactured by Roland Corporation between 1980 and 1983. It was one of the first drum machines to allow users to program rhythms instead of using preset patterns. Unlike its nearest competitor at the time, the more expensive Linn LM-1, the 808 generates sounds using analog synthesis rather than by playing samples.

The 808 was a commercial failure, as electronic music had yet to become mainstream and many producers wanted more realistic drum sounds. After building approximately 12,000 units, Roland discontinued the 808 after its semiconductors became impossible to restock. It was succeeded by the TR-909 in 1983.

Over the course of the 1980s, the 808 attracted a cult following among underground musicians for its affordability on the used market, ease of use and idiosyncratic sounds, particularly its deep, booming bass drum. It became a cornerstone of the emerging electronic, dance and hip-hop genres, popularized by early hits such as &quot;Planet Rock&quot; by Afrika Bambaataa and the Soulsonic Force and &quot;Sexual Healing&quot; by Marvin Gaye.

The 808 was eventually used on more hit records than any other drum machine. Its popularity in hip-hop has made it one of the most influential inventions in popular music, comparable to the Fender Stratocaster&#x27;s impact on rock. Its sounds are included with music software and modern drum machines and it has inspired unlicensed recreations.

== Background ==
In the 1960s, drum machines were most often used to accompany home organs. They did not allow users to program rhythms, but instead offered preset patterns such as bossa nova. In 1969, the Hammond Organ Company hired the American musician and engineer Don Lewis to demonstrate its products, including an electronic organ with a built-in drum machine designed by the Japanese company Ace Tone. Lewis was known for performances using electronic instruments he had modified, decades before the popularization of instrument hacking via circuit bending. He made extensive modifications to the Ace Tone drum machine, creating his own rhythms and wiring it through his organ&#x27;s expression pedal to accent the percussion.

Lewis was approached by Ikutaro Kakehashi, the president and founder of Ace Tone, who wanted to know how he had achieved the sounds using the Ace Tone machine. In 1972, Kakehashi formed the Roland Corporation and hired Lewis to help design drum machines. By the late 1970s, microprocessors were appearing in instruments such as the Roland MC-8 Microcomposer, and Kakehashi realized they could be used to program drum machines. In 1978, Roland released the CompuRhythm CR-78, the first drum machine with which users could write, save and replay their own patterns.

== Development ==
With its next machine, the TR-808, Roland aimed to develop a drum machine for the professional market, expecting that it would mainly be used to create demos. The team was led by the chief engineer Tadao Kikumoto. Makoto Muroi was a chief engineer, Hiro Nakamura was responsible for designing the analog voice circuits that generate the sounds, and Hisanori Matsuoka was responsible for developing the software and engineering hardware.

Kakehashi and Lewis asked the team to ask produce an inexpensive machine that would play realistic drum sounds. Due to the cost of memory chips, instead of using pulse-code modulation to play samples of percussion, Kikumoto instead proposed a &quot;drum synthesizer&quot; which would generate sounds using analog synthesis. They aimed to allow users to program sequences and edit parameters such as tuning, decay and level. Kakehashi deliberately purchased faulty transistors to create the 808&#x27;s distinctive sizzling sound.

== Sounds and features ==
The 808 imitates acoustic percussion: the bass drum, snare, toms, conga, rimshot, claves, handclap, maraca, cowbell, cymbal and hi-hat (open and closed). Rather than playing samples, it generates sounds using analog synthesis; the TR in TR-808 stands for &quot;transistor rhythm&quot;. The sounds do not resemble real percussion, and have been described as &quot;clicky&quot;, &quot;robotic&quot;, &quot;spacey&quot;, &quot;toy-like&quot; and &quot;futuristic&quot;. &quot;Fact&quot; described them as a combination of synthesizer tones and white noise that resemble &quot;bursts coming from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop&quot; more than a real drum kit. In &quot;Music Technology&quot;, Tim Goodyer described the cowbell as &quot;clumsy, clonky and hopelessly underpitched&quot;.

The 808 is noted for its powerful bass drum sound, built from a sine oscillator, low-pass filter and voltage-controlled amplifier. The bass drum decay control allows users to lengthen the sound, creating uniquely low frequencies that flatten slightly over time, possibly not by design. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described the bass drum as the 808&#x27;s defining feature.

The 808 was the first drum machine with which users could program a percussion track from beginning to end, complete with breaks and rolls. Users can program up to 32 patterns using the step sequencer, chain up to 768 measures and place accents on individual beats. Users can also set the tempo and time signature, including unusual signatures such as  and . The 808 includes volume knobs for each voice, numerous audio outputs and a DIN sync port (a precursor to MIDI) to synchronize with other devices. Its three trigger outputs can synchronize with synthesizers and other equipment.

== Release ==
The 808 launched in 1980 with a list price of . Roland marketed it as an affordable alternative to the Linn LM-1, manufactured by Linn Electronics, which used samples of real drum kits. The 808 sounded simplistic and synthetic by comparison; electronic music had yet to become mainstream and many musicians and producers wanted realistic-sounding drum machines. According to many reports, one review dismissed the 808 as sounding like &quot;marching anteaters&quot;, though this likely referred to machines that predated it. &quot;Contemporary Keyboard&quot; wrote a positive review, predicting that it would become &quot;the standard for rhythm machines of the future&quot;. 

Despite some early adopters, the 808 was a commercial failure and fewer than 12,000 units were sold. Roland ended production in 1983 after semiconductor improvements made it impossible to restock the faulty transistors essential to its design.

== Use ==

Before its release, Roland rented an 808 to the Japanese group Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO), who used it at a 1980 performance of &quot;1000 Knives&quot; at the Budokan. In the same year, the YMO member Ryuichi Sakamoto used the 808 on his solo album &quot;B-2 Unit&quot;. Later in 1980, the 808 was used in an Indian disco album, &quot;Babla&#x27;s Disco Sensation&quot;, by Babla. 

In 1981, the 808 was featured on the YMO album &quot;BGM&quot; and the single &quot;Nobody Told Me&quot; by the Monitors. In 1982, the American R&amp;B artist Marvin Gaye released the first US hit single to feature the 808, &quot;Sexual Healing&quot;. Gaye was drawn to the 808 because he could use it to create music in isolation, without other musicians or producers.

Though the 808 was unsuccessful, it was eventually used on more hit records than any other drum machine and became one of the most influential inventions in popular music. By the time Roland discontinued it in 1983, it had become common on the used market, often selling for less than $100 (). Its ease of use, affordability and idiosyncratic sound earned it a cult following among underground musicians and producers, and it became a cornerstone of the developing electronic and hip-hop genres.

808 samples are common in music software, and it has inspired numerous unlicensed clones. &quot;Flavorwire&quot; wrote that the 808 is now so ubiquitous that &quot;its beats are almost a language of their own&quot;, with sounds recognizable even to listeners who do not know what drum machines are, and so &quot;you also notice when somebody messes with them or uses them in unusual contexts&quot;. In 2019, &quot;DJMag&quot; wrote that it was likely the most used drum machine of the preceding 40 years.

=== Hip-hop ===
The 808 has been described as hip-hop&#x27;s equivalent to the Fender Stratocaster guitar, which dramatically influenced the development of rock music. It was used by pioneering hip-hop acts including Run-DMC, LL Cool J and Public Enemy. The 808 bass drum, in particular, became so essential that Hank Shocklee of the Bomb Squad production group declared that &quot;it&#x27;s not hip-hop without that sound&quot;. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that the &quot;trembling feeling of [the 808 bass drum], booming down boulevards in Oakland, the Bronx and Detroit, are part of America&#x27;s cultural DNA&quot;. Even after the 808 fell out of use by East Coast hip-hop producers in the 1990s, it remained a staple of Southern hip-hop. 

The rapper Kanye West used the 808 on every track on his 2008 solo album &quot;808s &amp; Heartbreak&quot;, which &quot;Slate&quot; described as &quot;an explicit love letter to the device&quot;. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote in 2015 that the 808 was the bedrock of the modern &quot;urban-youth-culture soundtrack&quot;, particularly in trap music, and had influenced a new blend of dance and retro hip-hop that &quot;embraces and fetishizes ... street music from the past&quot;.

Artists pushed the limits of the 808&#x27;s limited pattern storage; according to &quot;Slate&quot;, &quot;Those eight-bar units became veritable playgrounds for invention and creativity.&quot; Artists manipulated the bass drum to produce new sounds, such as on the 1984 single &quot;Set it Off&quot;, in which the producer Strafe used it to imitate the sound of an underground nuclear test. The producer Rick Rubin popularized the technique of lengthening the bass drum decay and tuning it to different pitches to create basslines. The Beastie Boys used a reversed recording of an 808 on their 1986 track &quot;Paul Revere&quot;.

=== Electronic music ===
In 1982, Afrika Bambaataa and the Soulsonic Force released their single &quot;Planet Rock&quot;, which used the 808 to create &quot;strange, futuristic&quot; percussion that was popular in clubs. The track influenced the development of electronic and hip-hop music and subgenres including Miami bass and Detroit techno, and popularized the 808 as a &quot;fundamental element of futuristic sound&quot;. According to &quot;Slate&quot;, &quot;Planet Rock&quot; &quot;didn&#x27;t so much put the 808 on the map so much as reorient an entire world of post-disco dance music around it&quot;.

The British electronic group 808 State took its name from the 808 and used it extensively. 808 State&#x27;s Graham Massey said: &quot;The Roland gear began to be a kind of Esperanto in music. The whole world began to be less separated through this technology, and there was a classiness to it—you could transcend your provincial music with this equipment.&quot; With the rise of rave culture, a precursor to acid house, the 808 became a staple sound on British radio. In the early 90s, the Japanese composer Yuzo Koshiro incorporated samples of the 808 in his soundtracks for the &quot;Streets of Rage&quot; games.

=== Pop ===
The 808 was used extensively in pop. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that it triggered &quot;the big bang of pop&#x27;s great age of disruption, from 1983 to 1986&quot;, and that its &quot;defiantly inorganic timbres ... sketched out the domain of a new world of music&quot;. According to &quot;Slate&quot;, it was instrumental in pop music&#x27;s shift from conventional structure and harmonic progression to &quot;thinking in terms of &quot;sequences&quot;, discrete passages of sound and time to be repeated and revised &quot;ad infinitum&quot;&quot;.

The Argentine artist Charly García used the 808 for all percussion on his second album, &quot;Clics modernos&quot; (1983). In the 1984 Talking Heads concert film &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot;, the singer David Byrne performs &quot;Psycho Killer&quot; accompanied by an 808, stumbling against its &quot;gunshot&quot;-like sounds. The drummer and songwriter Phil Collins found the 808 useful for looping rhythms for long periods, as human drummers would be tempted to add variations and fills. Whitney Houston&#x27;s 1987 single &quot;I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)&quot; makes extensive use of the 808. 

Other artists who have used the 808 include Damon Albarn, Diplo, Fatboy Slim, David Guetta and New Order. It has been referenced in lyrics by artists including the Beastie Boys, Beck, Outkast, Kelis, TI, Lil Wayne, Britney Spears, Beyoncé, R Kelly and Robbie Williams. Its bass drum has been used as a metaphor for a heartbeat in songs by artists including Madonna, Rihanna and Kesha.

== Successors ==

The 808 was followed in 1983 by the TR-909, the first Roland drum machine to use samples. Like the 808, the 909 influenced popular music, including such genres as techno, house and acid.

808 samples were included in ReBirth RB-338, an early software synthesiser developed by Propellerhead Software. According to Andy Jones of &quot;MusicTech&quot;, ReBirth was &quot;especially incredible&quot; as the first software emulation of 808 sounds. It was retired in 2017 as Roland said it infringed on its intellectual property. Roland has included 808 samples in several drum machines, including its Grooveboxes in the 1990s. Its TR-8 and TR-8S drum machines, released in the 2010s, recreate the sounds electronically rather than through sample playback. 

In 2017, Roland released the TR-08, a miniaturized 808 featuring an LED display, MIDI and USB connections, expanded sequencer control and a built-in speaker. Roland released the first official software emulations of the 808 and 909 in 2018. In 2019, Behringer released a recreation of the 808, the Behringer RD-8 Rhythm Designer. Unlike Roland&#x27;s TR-08 and TR-8S, which use samples and virtual synthesis to recreate the 808 sounds, the RD-8 uses analog circuitry.

<text>Robert Duane Ballard (born June 30, 1942) is an American retired Navy officer and a professor of oceanography at the University of Rhode Island who is noted for his work in underwater archaeology (maritime archaeology and archaeology of shipwrecks) and marine geology. He is best known by the general public for the discoveries of the wrecks of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1985, the battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot; in 1989, and the aircraft carrier in 1998. He discovered the wreck of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;PT-109&quot; in 2002 and visited Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana, who saved its crew.

Ballard discovered hydrothermal vents, where life goes on powered by nutrient chemicals emitted by the vents rather than the sunlight that drives most life on Earth; he said &quot;finding hydrothermal vents beats the hell out of finding the Titanic&quot;, and his mother commented &quot;It&#x27;s too bad you found that rusty old boat... they&#x27;re only going to remember you for finding [it]&quot;. Ballard also established the JASON Project, and leads ocean exploration on the research vessel E/V &quot;Nautilus&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Robert Duane Ballard was born on June 30, 1942 in Wichita, Kansas. He had an older brother, Richard, and a younger sister, Nancy Ann. When Ballard was two years old, his family moved to southern California, where his father worked as a flight test engineer. He has attributed his early interest in underwater exploration to watching the 1954 film &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot;, an adaptation of Jules Verne&#x27;s 1870 novel. While he was a high school student, his father connected him with oceanographers at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and he participated in several short research expeditions. Ballard enrolled at University of California, Santa Barbara, and joined the Army Reserve Officer Training Corps.

Beginning in 1962, Ballard worked part-time with Andreas Rechnitzer&#x27;s Ocean Systems Group at North American Aviation, where his father was the chief engineer of North American&#x27;s Minuteman missile program. At North American, Ballard worked on its failed proposal to build the submersible &quot;Alvin&quot; for the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

In 1965, Ballard graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara, earning undergraduate degrees in chemistry and geology. While a student in Santa Barbara, California, he joined Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, and also completed the US Army&#x27;s ROTC program, giving him an Army officer&#x27;s commission in Army Intelligence. His first graduate degree (MS, 1966) was in geophysics from the University of Hawaiʻi&#x27;s Institute of Geophysics where he trained porpoises and whales. Subsequently, he returned to Andreas Rechnitzer&#x27;s Ocean Systems Group at North American Aviation.

Ballard was working towards a PhD in marine geology at the University of Southern California in 1967 when he was called to active duty. Upon his request, he was transferred from the Army into the US Navy as an oceanographer. The Navy assigned him as a liaison between the Office of Naval Research and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.

After leaving active duty and entering the Naval Reserve in 1970, Ballard continued working at Woods Hole persuading organizations and people, mostly scientists, to fund and use &quot;Alvin&quot; for undersea research. Four years later he received a PhD in marine geology and geophysics at the University of Rhode Island.

==Military career==
Ballard joined the United States Army Reserve in 1965 through the Reserve Officers Training program. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant and assigned to army intelligence. When called to active duty in 1967, he asked to fulfill his obligation in the United States Navy. His request was approved, and he was transferred to the Navy Reserve. After completing his active-duty obligation in 1970, he was returned to reserve status, where he remained for much of his military career, being called up only for mandatory training and special assignments. He retired from the Navy as a commander in 1995 after reaching the statutory service limit.

==Marine geology==
Ballard&#x27;s first dive in a submersible was in the &quot;Ben Franklin&quot; (PX-15) in 1969 off the coast of Florida during a Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution expedition. In the summer of 1970, he began a field mapping project of the Gulf of Maine for his doctoral dissertation. It used an air gun that sent sound waves underwater to determine the underlying structure of the ocean floor and the submersible &quot;Alvin&quot;, which was used to find and recover a sample from the bedrock.

Ballard was geologist diver in &quot;Alvin&quot; during Project FAMOUS, which explored the median rift valley of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in 1974.

During the summer of 1975, Ballard participated in a joint French-American expedition called Phere searching for hydrothermal vents over the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, but the expedition did not find any active vents.

On the Galapagos spreading center east of the islands a 1977 exploration by &quot;Alvin&quot; found deep-sea hydrothermal vents surrounded by communities of living organisms with energy derived by chemosynthesis. Ballard was a participating diver. While the discovery was of immense biological significance, the expedition&#x27;s scientists were all geologists, with no biologists, as it was thought certain there would be no life to study, let alone forms unknown to science.

The 1979 RISE project expedition on the East Pacific Rise west of Mexico at 21°N was aided by deep-towed still camera sleds that were able to take pictures of the ocean floor, making it easier to find hydrothermal vent locations. When &quot;Alvin&quot; inspected one of the sites the deep tow located, the scientists observed black &quot;smoke&quot; billowing out of the vents, something not observed at the Galápagos Rift.

Ballard and geophysicist Jean Francheteau went down in &quot;Alvin&quot; the day after the black smokers were first observed. They were able to take an accurate temperature reading of the active vent (the previous dive&#x27;s thermometer had melted) and recorded a temperature of .

They continued searching for more vents along the East Pacific Rise between 1980 and 1982.

==Marine archaeology==
While Ballard had been interested in the sea since an early age, his work at Woods Hole and his scuba diving experiences off Massachusetts spurred his interest in shipwrecks and their exploration. His work in the Navy involved developing small, unmanned submersibles that could be tethered to and controlled from a surface ship and were outfitted with lighting, cameras, and manipulator arms. As early as 1973, he saw this as a way of searching for the wreck of the &quot;Titanic&quot;. In 1977, he led his first expedition, which was unsuccessful.

===RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;===

In the summer of 1985, Ballard was aboard the French research ship &quot;Le Suroît&quot;, which was using the side scan sonar &quot;SAR&quot; to search for the &quot;Titanic&quot; wreck. When the French ship was recalled, he transferred onto a ship from Woods Hole, the R/V &quot;Knorr&quot;. Unbeknownst to some, this trip was financed by the U.S. Navy for secret reconnaissance of the wreckage of two Navy nuclear powered attack submarines, the USS &quot;Scorpion&quot; and the USS &quot;Thresher&quot;, which sank in the 1960s, and not for the &quot;Titanic&quot;. In 1982, Ballard had approached the Navy about his new deep sea underwater robot craft, the &quot;Argo&quot;, and his search for the &quot;Titanic&quot;. The Navy, while not interested in funding Ballard&#x27;s &quot;Titanic&quot; search on its own, ultimately concluded that &quot;Argo&quot; was their best chance to locate their missing submarines, and agreed to finance his expedition on the condition that he first investigated the two submarines, assessed the state of their nuclear reactors, and determined if their long submergence had cause any radioactive environmental impact. He was placed on temporary active duty in the Navy, in charge of finding and investigating the wrecks, after which he would be free to use any remaining time and resources to hunt for the &quot;Titanic&quot;.

After their missions for the Navy, &quot;Knorr&quot; arrived on site on August 22, 1985, and deployed &quot;Argo&quot;. When they searched for the two submarines, Ballard and his team discovered they had imploded from the immense pressure at depth. It littered thousands of pieces of debris all over the ocean floor. Following the large trail of debris led them directly to the remnants of both vessels and made them significantly easier to locate than if they were to search for the hulls directly. He already knew that the &quot;Titanic&quot; imploded from pressure, much like the two submarines, and concluded that it too must have left a scattered debris trail. Using that lesson, they had &quot;Argo&quot; sweep back and forth across the ocean floor looking for the &quot;Titanic&#x27;s&quot; debris trail. They took shifts monitoring the video feed from &quot;Argo&quot; as it searched the ocean floor two miles below.

In the early morning of September 1, 1985, observers noted anomalies on the smooth ocean floor. At first, it was pockmarks, like small craters from impacts. Eventually, debris was sighted as the rest of the team was awakened. Finally, a boiler was sighted, and soon after that, the hull was found.

Ballard&#x27;s team made a general search of the &quot;Titanic&#x27;s&quot; exterior, noting its condition. Most significantly, they confirmed that it had split in two and that the stern was in far worse shape than the bow. They did not have much time to explore, as others were waiting to take &quot;Knorr&quot; on other scientific pursuits, but his fame was now assured. He originally planned to keep the location secret to prevent anyone from claiming prizes. He considered the site a cemetery and refused to desecrate it by removing artifacts.

On July 12, 1986, Ballard and his team returned on board &quot;Atlantis II&quot; to make the first detailed study of the wreck. This time, he brought &quot;Alvin&quot;. It was accompanied by &quot;Jason Junior&quot;, a small remotely operated vehicle that could fit through small openings to see into the ship&#x27;s interior. Although the first dive (taking over two hours) encountered technical problems, subsequent ones were far more successful and produced a detailed photographic record of the wreck&#x27;s condition.

In 1988, Ballard published a book, &quot;Discovery Of The Titanic: Exploring The Greatest Of All Lost Ships&quot;, and he later recounted the specifics of the expedition for &quot;National Geographic&quot; in a video.

Many of the relics retrieved by various groups, not including Ballard, from RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; were owned by Premier Exhibitions which filed for bankruptcy in 2016. In late August 2018, the groups vying for ownership of the 5,500 relics included one by museums in England and Northern Ireland with assistance from filmmaker James Cameron and some financial support from National Geographic. Ballard told the news media that he favored this bid since it would ensure that the memorabilia would be permanently displayed in Belfast and in Greenwich. A decision as to the outcome was to be made by a United States district court judge.

===Other wrecks===
====&quot;Bismarck&quot;====
Ballard undertook an even more daunting task when he and his team searched off the coast of France for the German Battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot; in 1989, using an ocean-crawling robot. The 15,000 foot deep water in which it sank is 4,000 feet deeper than that where the &quot;Titanic&quot; sank. He attempted to determine whether it had been sunk by the British or was scuttled by its crew. Three weeks after the expedition however, personal tragedy struck him when his 21-year-old son, Todd, who had aided him in the search, was killed in a car accident.

Ballard later published a book about the quest, &quot;The Discovery of the Bismarck&quot; (1990) The discovery was also documented for National Geographic in a 1989 James Cameron video &quot;Search for the Battleship Bismarck&quot; which indicated that the ship had been damaged by torpedoes and shells from British ships. The actual cause of the sinking, however, was sabotage of the underwater valves by the onboard crew, according to Ballard, who said, &quot;we found a hull that appears whole and relatively undamaged by the descent and impact&quot;. Filmmaker Cameron, however, said that his crew&#x27;s examination of the wreckage indicated that the Bismarck would have sunk eventually even if it had not been scuttled.

====&quot;Lusitania&quot;====
In 1993, Ballard investigated the wreck of RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; off the Irish coast. It had been struck by a torpedo, whose explosion was followed by a second, much larger one. The wreck had been depth charged by the Royal Navy several years after the sinking and had also been damaged by other explorers, making a forensic analysis difficult. He found no evidence of boiler explosion and he speculated the ignition of coal dust inside the ship caused a &quot;massive, uncontrollable [second] explosion&quot;.

Others have questioned this hypothesis, some suggesting that the ship had been sabotaged by the British. Ballard found no evidence to support this claim. Some experts have indicated that it was, in fact, boiler explosions that caused the ship to sink so quickly, in a mere 18 minutes.

Ballard published a book about the discovery, &quot;Exploring the Lusitania: Probing the Mysteries of the Sinking that Changed History&quot;, also titled &quot;Robert Ballard&#x27;s Lusitania&quot; in some markets, with co-author Spencer Dunmore.

====Battle of Guadalcanal====
In 1992, Ballard and his team visited the sites of many wrecks of World War II in the Pacific. Doing so, he discovered the wreck of the IJN &quot;Kirishima&quot;. His book &quot;Lost Ships of Guadalcanal&quot; locates and photographs many of the vessels sunk at Ironbottom Sound, the strait between Guadalcanal Island and the Floridas in the Solomon Islands.

====USS &quot;Yorktown&quot;====
On May 19, 1998, Ballard found the wreck of &quot;Yorktown&quot;, sunk at the Battle of Midway. Found three miles (5 km) beneath the surface, it was photographed.

====&quot;PT-109&quot;====
In 2002, the National Geographic Society and Ballard fielded a ship with remote vehicles to the Solomon Islands. They succeeded in finding a torpedo tube and the forward section from the shipwreck of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;PT-109&quot; which was rammed in 1943 by the Japanese destroyer &quot;Amagiri&quot; off Ghizo Island. The visit also brought to light the identity of islanders Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana who had received little recognition for finding the shipwrecked crew after searching for days in their dugout canoe. A TV special and a book were produced, and Ballard spoke at the John F. Kennedy Library in 2005.

===Institute for Exploration===
In the 1990s Ballard founded the Institute for Exploration, which specializes in deep-sea archaeology and geology. It joined forces in 1999 with the Mystic Aquarium in Mystic, Connecticut. They are a part of the non-profit Sea Research Foundation, Inc.

===Center for Ocean Exploration and Archaeological Oceanography===
In 2003, Ballard started the Center for Ocean Exploration and Archaeological Oceanography, a research program at the University of Rhode Island&#x27;s Graduate School of Oceanography.

===Black Sea===
In 1976, Willard Bascom suggested that the deep, anoxic waters of the Black Sea might have preserved ships from antiquity because typical wood-devouring organisms could not survive there. At a depth of 150 m, it contains insufficient oxygen to support most familiar biological life forms.

Originally a land-locked freshwater lake, the Black Sea was flooded with salt water from the Mediterranean Sea during the Holocene. The influx of salt water essentially smothered the freshwater below it because a lack of internal motion and mixing meant that no fresh oxygen reached the deep waters, creating a meromictic body of water. The anoxic environment, which is hostile to many biological organisms that destroy wood in the oxygenated waters, provides an excellent testing site for deep-water archaeological surveys.

In a series of expeditions, a team of marine archaeologists led by Ballard identified what appeared to be ancient shorelines, freshwater snail shells, and drowned river valleys in roughly 300 feet (100 m) of water off the Black Sea coast of modern Turkey. Radiocarbon dating of freshwater mollusk remains indicated an age of about 7,000 years.

The team discovered three ancient wrecks west of the town of Sinop at depths of 100 m. Wreck A and Wreck C probably date to the late Roman period (2nd–4th century A.D.), while Wreck B probably dates to the Byzantine period (5th to 7th century A.D.).

To the east of Sinop, the team discovered a remarkably well-preserved wreck at a 320 m depth, in the Black Sea&#x27;s deep anoxic waters. The vessel&#x27;s entire hull and cargo are intact, buried in sediments. Its deck structures are also intact, including a mast rising 11 m into the water column. Radiocarbon dating of wood from the wreck provides a date of 410–520 A.D. It has been named &quot;Sinop D&quot; by the Ballard team.

In 2000, the team conducted an expedition that focused on exploration of the seabed about 15–30 km west of Sinop, and an additional deep-water survey east and north of the peninsula. Their project had several goals. They sought to discover whether human habitation sites could be identified on the ancient submerged landscape, they examined the sea-bed for shipwrecks (where they found Sinop A-D), to test the hypothesis that the anoxic waters below 200 m would protect shipwrecks from the expected biological attacks on organic components, and to seek data about an ancient trade route between Sinop and the Crimea indicated by terrestrial archaeological remains.

Although Sinop served as a primary trade center in the Black Sea, the wrecks were located west of the trade route predicted by the prevalence of Sinopian ceramics on the Crimean peninsula. On wrecks A-C, mounds of distinctive carrot-shaped shipping jars, called amphorae, were found. They were of a style associated with Sinop and retained much of their original stacking pattern on the sea floor. The jars may have carried a variety of archetypal Black Sea products such as olive oil, honey, wine, or fish sauce. The contents are unknown because no artifacts were recovered from these wreck sites in 2000.

The wreck provided the team with vast information about the technological changes and trade in the Black Sea during political, social, and economic transition through their study of the ship&#x27;s construction techniques. Studies show that in Sinop during the Byzantine era, they had developed long-distance trading as early as 4500 BC. Sea-trading on the Black Sea was most intense during the period of late antiquity, between the 2nd and 7th centuries AD. The examination of the four shipwrecks found by Ballard and his team provide the direct evidence for Black Sea maritime trade so well attested by the distribution of ceramics on land.

The video images of Shipwreck A show a wall of shipping jars standing about 2 m above the seabed. The amphorae highest on the mound had fallen over without displacing those still standing in the rows beneath them, and, likely, the ship settled upright on the seabed gradually being both buried in and filled with sediment as exposed wood was devoured by the larva or the shipworm.

Shipwreck B also consisted of a large pile of amphorae but several types are visible, as are multiple timbers protruding from within the mound and on it. In addition to the Sinop-style jars, several amphorae similar to examples excavated on the Yassiada Byzantine shipwreck and dating from the 5th to late 6th century AD are present.

Two discrete and mostly buried piles of carrot-shaped shipping jars comprise shipwreck C. The team&#x27;s visit to the site was short and was intended primarily to test survey methodology for deep-water procedures.

Shipwreck D provided the team with an unprecedented opportunity to document hull construction during a time of transition. When observing the sonar signature of Shipwreck D, a long, slender upright feature on the seabed, transformed itself into a wooden mast. Elements rarely present on shallower shipwreck sites are beautifully preserved 200 m below the surface. Disappointingly for ship scholars and historians of technology, there are few indications of how the planks of Sinop D are held together. There are no mortise and tenon fastenings and no sewing. Shipwreck D may be one of the earliest lateen-rigged ships to be studied by archaeologists. The angle of the mast and the lack of fittings on it suggest that a lateen sail is the most likely configuration for such a small vessel.

The Institute for Exploration Black Sea expeditions relied on remote sensing with side-scan sonar in shallow and deep water to identify potential archaeological sites examined by ROVs. The hypothesis that the anoxic waters of the Black Sea would allow extraordinary organic preservation is borne out by the discovery of Sinop D, the 1,500-year-old shipwreck with excellent preservation of features above the sediment layer.

According to a report in &quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine (May 4, 2002, p. 13), the researchers found an underwater delta south of the Bosporus. There was evidence of a strong flow of fresh water out of the Black Sea in the 8th millennium BC. Ballard&#x27;s research has contributed to the debate over the Black Sea deluge theory.

<doc id="158703" wikidata="Q313728" url="?curid=158703" title="Pheidippides">
<text>Pheidippides (, , ) or Philippides () is the central figure in the story that inspired the marathon race. Pheidippides is said to have run from Marathon to Athens to deliver news of the victory of the Battle of Marathon, and, according to Herodotus, to have run from Athens to Sparta. This latter feat also inspired two ultramarathon races, the Spartathlon and Authentic Pheidippides Run.

== Name ==
The name Philippides is reported by Pausanias, Plutarch, and Lucian, writers who had read this name in their versions of Herodotus, while in most of Herodotus&#x27;s manuscripts the form appears Pheidippides.

Other than Herodotus&#x27;s manuscripts, the form Pheidippides is only attested in Aristophanes&#x27;s &quot;The Clouds&quot; (423 BC). Many historians argue that Aristophanes willfully distorted the actual name so as not to use the name of the hero of Marathon in his play or as a play on words meaning &quot;save horses&quot;. However, given that the name Pheidippo is attested in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the existence of a Pheidippides cannot be excluded. Still, according to many, this form remains an error of the copyists of the manuscripts.

==Accounts==
The traditional story relates that Pheidippides (530–490 BC), an Athenian runner, or (translated as &#x27;day-runner&#x27;, &#x27;courier&#x27;, &#x27;professional-running courier&#x27; or &#x27;day-long runner&#x27;), was sent to Sparta to request help when the Persians landed at Marathon, Greece. He ran about in two days, and then ran back. He then ran the to the battlefield near Marathon and back to Athens to announce the Greek victory over Persia in the Battle of Marathon (490 BC) with the word ( &#x27;We win!&#x27;), as stated by Lucian (&#x27;hail, we are the winners&#x27;) and then collapsed and died.

===Sources===
====Herodotus====
The Greek historian Herodotus was the first person to write about an Athenian runner named Pheidippides participating in the First Persian War. His account is as follows:

According to Miller (2006), Herodotus, only 30–40 years removed from the events in question, based his account on eyewitnesses, so it seems altogether likely that Pheidippides was an actual historical figure. However, Miller also asserts that Herodotus did not ever mention a Marathon-to-Athens runner in any of his writings. Whether the story is true or not it has no connection with the Battle of Marathon itself, and Herodotus&#x27;s silence on the evidently dramatic incident of a herald running from Marathon to Athens suggests that no such event occurred.

====Later embellishments====
The first known written account of a run from Marathon to Athens occurs in the works of the Greek writer Plutarch (46–120 AD), in his essay &quot;On the Glory of Athens&quot;. Plutarch attributes the run to a herald called either or . Lucian, a century later, credits one &quot;Philippides&quot;. It seems likely that in the 500 years between Herodotus&#x27;s time and Plutarch&#x27;s, the story of Pheidippides had become muddled with that of the Battle of Marathon (in particular with the story of the Athenian forces making the march from Marathon to Athens in order to intercept the Persian ships headed there), and some fanciful writer had invented the story of the run from Marathon to Athens.

The first recorded account showing a courier running from Marathon to Athens to announce victory is from within Lucian&#x27;s prose on the first use of the word &quot;joy&quot; as a greeting in &quot;A Slip of the Tongue in Greeting&quot; (2nd century AD).

Most accounts incorrectly attribute Lucian&#x27;s story to Herodotus, who wrote the history of the Persian Wars in his &quot;Histories&quot; (composed about 440 BC). However, Magill and Moose (2003) suggest that the story is likely a &quot;romantic invention&quot;. They point out that Lucian is the only classical source with all the elements of the story known in modern culture as the &quot;Marathon story of Pheidippides&quot;: a messenger running from the fields of Marathon to announce victory, then dying on completion of his mission.

== Modern reception ==

Robert Browning &#x27;s 1879 poem &quot;Pheidippides&quot; retold the traditional story.

This poem inspired Baron Pierre de Coubertin and other founders of the modern Olympic Games to invent a running race of approximately called the marathon. In 1921, the length of marathons became standardized at .

Based on Herodotus&#x27;s account, British RAF Wing Commander John Foden and four other RAF officers travelled to Greece in 1982 on an official expedition to test whether it was possible to cover the nearly 250 kilometres (155 miles) in a day and a half (36 hours). Three runners were successful in completing the distance: John Scholtens (34h30m), John Foden (37h37m), and John McCarthy (39h00m). Since 1983, it has been an annual footrace from Athens to Sparta, known as the Spartathlon, celebrating Pheidippides&#x27;s run across of the Greek countryside.

Another run inspired by Herodotus&#x27;s account, the Authentic Pheidippides Run, makes a round trip from Athens to Sparta and back.

<text>An oil spill is the release of a liquid petroleum hydrocarbon into the environment, especially the marine ecosystem, due to human activity, and is a form of pollution. The term is usually given to marine oil spills, where oil is released into the ocean or coastal waters, but spills may also occur on land. Oil spills can result from the release of crude oil from tankers, offshore platforms, drilling rigs, and wells. They may also involve spills of refined petroleum products, such as gasoline and diesel fuel, as well as their by-products. Additionally, heavier fuels used by large ships, such as bunker fuel, or spills of any oily refuse or waste oil, contribute to such incidents. These spills can have severe environmental and economic consequences.

Oil spills penetrate into the structure of the plumage of birds and the fur of mammals, reducing its insulating ability, and making them more vulnerable to temperature fluctuations and much less buoyant in the water. Cleanup and recovery from an oil spill is difficult and depends upon many factors, including the type of oil spilled, the temperature of the water (affecting evaporation and biodegradation), and the types of shorelines and beaches involved. Spills may take weeks, months or even years to clean up.

Oil spills can have disastrous consequences for society; economically, environmentally, and socially. As a result, oil spill accidents have initiated intense media attention and political uproar, bringing many together in a political struggle concerning government response to oil spills and what actions can best prevent them from happening.

==Human impacts==
An oil spill represents an immediate negative effects on human health, including respiratory and reproductive problems as well as liver, and immune system damage. Oil spills causing future oil supply to decline also effects the everyday life of humans such as the potential closure of beaches, parks, fisheries and fire hazards. The Kuwaiti oil fires produced air pollution that caused respiratory distress. The &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; explosion killed eleven oil rig workers. The fire resulting from the Lac-Mégantic derailment killed 47 and destroyed half of the town&#x27;s centre.

Spilled oil can also contaminate drinking water supplies. For example, in 2013 two different oil spills contaminated water supplies for 300,000 in Miri, Malaysia; 80,000 people in Coca, Ecuador. In 2000, springs were contaminated by an oil spill in Clark County, Kentucky.

Contamination can have an economic impact on tourism and marine resource extraction industries. For example, the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; oil spill impacted beach tourism and fishing along the Gulf Coast, and the responsible parties were required to compensate economic victims.

==Environmental effects==


===Animals===
The threat posed to birds, fish, shellfish and crustaceans from spilled oil was known in England in the 1920s, largely through observations made in Yorkshire. The subject was also explored in a scientific paper produced by the National Academy of Sciences in the US in 1974 which considered impacts to fish, crustaceans and molluscs. The paper was limited to 100 copies and was described as a draft document, not to be cited.

In general, spilled oil can affect animals and plants in two ways: dirесt from the oil and from the response or cleanup process. Oil penetrates into the structure of the plumage of birds and the fur of mammals, reducing their insulating ability, and making them more vulnerable to temperature fluctuations and much less buoyant in the water.

Animals who rely on scent to find their babies or mothers cannot do so due to the strong scent of the oil. This causes a baby to be rejected and abandoned, leaving the babies to starve and eventually die. Oil can impair a bird&#x27;s ability to fly, preventing it from foraging or escaping from predators. As they preen, birds may ingest the oil coating their feathers, irritating the digestive tract, altering liver function, and causing kidney damage. Together with their diminished foraging capacity, this can rapidly result in dehydration and metabolic imbalance. Some birds exposed to petroleum also experience changes in their hormonal balance, including changes in their luteinizing protein. The majority of birds affected by oil spills die from complications without human intervention. Some studies have suggested that less than one percent of oil-soaked birds survive, even after cleaning, although the survival rate can also exceed ninety percent, as in the case of the &quot;MV Treasure&quot; oil spill. Oil spills and oil dumping events have been impacting sea birds since at least the 1920s and was understood to be a global problem in the 1930s.

Heavily furred exposed to oil spills are affected in similar ways. Oil coats the fur of sea otters and seals, reducing its insulating effect, and leading to fluctuations in body temperature and hypothermia. Oil can also blind an animal, leaving it defenseless. The ingestion of oil causes dehydration and impairs the digestive process. Animals can be poisoned, and may die from oil entering the lungs or liver.

===Air===
In addition, oil spills can also harm air quality. The chemicals in crude oil are mostly hydrocarbons that contains toxic chemicals such as benzenes, toluene, poly-aromatic hydrocarbons and oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. These chemicals can introduce adverse health effects when being inhaled into human body. In addition, these chemicals can be oxidized by oxidants in the atmosphere to form fine particulate matter after they evaporate into the atmosphere. These particulates can penetrate lungs and carry toxic chemicals into the human body.
Burning surface oil can also be a source for pollution such as soot particles. During the cleanup and recovery process, it will also generate air pollutants such as nitric oxides and ozone from ships. Lastly, bubble bursting can also be a generation pathway for particulate matter during an oil spill. During the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, significant air quality issues were found on the Gulf Coast, which is the downwind of DWH oil spill. Air quality monitoring data showed that criteria pollutants had exceeded the health-based standard in the coastal regions.

===Ecosystems, habitat===
The majority of oil from an oil spill remains in the environment, hence a spill from an operation in the ocean is different from an operation on tundra or wetland. Wetlands are considered one of the most sensitive habitats to oil spills and the most difficult to clean.

==Sources and rate of occurrence==
Oil spills can be caused by human error, natural disasters, technical failures or deliberate releases. It is estimated that 30–50% of all oil spills are directly or indirectly caused by human error, with approximately 20–40% of oil spills being attributed to equipment failure or malfunction. Causes of oil spills are further distinguished between deliberate releases, such as operational discharges or acts of war and accidental releases. Accidental oil spills are in the focus of the literature, although some of the largest oil spills ever recorded, the Gulf War Oil Spill (sea based) and Kuwaiti Oil Fires (land based) were deliberate acts of war. The academic study of sources and causes of oil spills identifies vulnerable points in oil transportation infrastructure and calculates the likelihood of oil spills happening. This can then guide prevention efforts and regulation policies

=== Natural seeps ===
Around 40–50% of all oil released into the oceans stems from natural seeps from seafloor rocks. This corresponds to approximately 600,000 tons annually on a global level. While natural seeps are the single largest source of oil spills, they are considered less problematic because ecosystems have adapted to such regular releases. For instance, on sites of natural oil seeps, ocean bacteria have evolved to digest oil molecules.

=== Oil tankers and vessels ===
Vessels can be the source of oil spills either through operational releases of oil or in the case of oil tanker accidents. As of 2007, operational discharges from vessels were estimated to account for 21% of oil releases from vessels. They occur as a consequence of failure to comply with regulations or arbitrary discharges of waste oil and water containing such oil residues. Such operational discharges are regulated through the MARPOL convention. Operational releases are frequent, but small in the amount of oil spilled per release, and are often not in the focus of attention regarding oil spills. There has been a steady decrease of operational discharges of oil, with an additional decrease of around 50% since the 1990s.

 accidental oil tank vessel spills accounted for approximately 8–13% of all oil spilled into the oceans. The main causes of oil tank vessel spills were collision (29%), grounding (22%), mishandling (14%) and sinking (12%), among others. Oil tanker spills are considered a major ecological threat due to the large amount of oil spilled per accident and the fact that major sea traffic routes are close to Large Marine Ecosystems. Around 90% of the world&#x27;s oil transportation is through oil tankers, and the absolute amount of seaborne oil trade is steadily increasing. However, there has been a reduction of the number of spills from oil tankers and of the amount of oil released per oil tanker spill. In 1992, MARPOL was amended and made it mandatory for large tankers (5,000 dwt and more) to be fitted with double hulls. This is considered to be a major reason for the reduction of oil tanker spills, alongside other innovations such as GPS, sectioning of vessels and sea lanes in narrow straits.

In 2023, the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation (ITOPF) documented a significant oil spill incident of over 700 tonnes and nine medium spills ranging between 7 and 700 tonnes. The major spill occurred in Asia involving heavy fuel oil, and the medium spills were scattered across Asia, Africa, Europe, and America, involving various oil types.

The total volume of oil released from these spills in 2023 was approximately 2,000 tonnes. This contributes to a trend of decreased oil spill volumes and frequencies over the decades. Comparatively, the 1970s averaged 79 significant spills per year, which drastically reduced to an average of about 6.3 per year in the 2010s, and has maintained a similar level in the current decade.

The reduction in oil spill volume has also been substantial over the years. For instance, the 1990s recorded 1,134,000 tonnes lost, mainly from 10 major spills. This figure decreased to 196,000 tonnes in the 2000s and 164,000 tonnes in the 2010s. In the early 2020s, approximately 28,000 tonnes have been lost, predominantly from major incidents.

=== Offshore oil platforms ===

Accidental spills from oil platforms nowadays account for approximately 3% of oil spills in the oceans. Prominent offshore oil platform spills typically occurred as a result of a blowout. They can go on for months until relief wells have been drilled, resulting in enormous amounts of oil leaked. Notable examples of such oil spills are Deepwater Horizon and Ixtoc I. While technologies for drilling in deep water have significantly improved in the past 30–40 years, oil companies move to drilling sites in more and more difficult places. This ambiguous development results in no clear trend regarding the frequency of offshore oil platform spills.

=== Pipelines ===
As of 2010, overall, there has been a substantial increase of pipeline oil spills in the past four decades. Prominent examples include oil spills of pipelines in the Niger Delta. Pipeline oil spills can be caused by trawling of fishing boats, natural disasters, pipe corrosion, construction defects, sabotage, or an attack, as with the Caño Limón-Coveñas pipeline in Colombia.

Pipelines as sources of oil spills are estimated to contribute 1% of oil pollution to the oceans. Reasons for this are underreporting, and many oil pipeline leaks occur on land with only fractions of that oil reaching the oceans.

=== Other sources ===
Recreational boats can spill oil into the ocean because of operational or human error and unpreparedness. The amounts are however small, and such oil spills are hard to track due to underreporting.

Oil can reach the oceans as oil and fuel from land-based sources. It is estimated that runoff oil and oil from rivers are responsible for 11% of oil pollution to the oceans. Such pollution can also be oil on roads from land vehicles, which is then flushed into the oceans during rainstorms. Purely land-based oil spills are different from maritime oil spills in that oil on land does not spread as quickly as in water, and effects thus remain local.

==Cleanup and recovery==


Cleanup and recovery from an oil spill is difficult and depends upon many factors, including the type of oil spilled, the temperature of the water (affecting evaporation and biodegradation), and the types of shorelines and beaches involved. Physical cleanups of oil spills are also very expensive. Until the 1960s, the best method for remediation consisted of putting straw on the spill and retrieving the oil-soaked straw manually. Chemical remediation is the norm as of the early 21st century, using compounds that can herd and thicken oil for physical recovery, disperse oil in the water, or facilitate burning the oil off. The future of oil cleanup technology is likely the use of microorganisms such as Fusobacteriota (formerly Fusobacteria), species demonstrate potential for future oil spill cleanup because of their ability to colonize and degrade oil slicks on the sea surface.

There are three kinds of oil-consuming bacteria. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and acid-producing bacteria are anaerobic, while general aerobic bacteria (GAB) are aerobic. These bacteria occur naturally and will act to remove oil from an ecosystem, and their biomass will tend to replace other populations in the food chain. The chemicals from the oil which dissolve in water, and hence are available to bacteria, are those in the water associated fraction of the oil.

Methods for cleaning up include:
* Bioremediation: use of microorganisms or biological agents to break down or remove oil; such as &quot;Alcanivorax&quot; bacteria or &quot;Methylocella silvestris&quot;.
* Bioremediation Accelerator: a binder molecule that moves hydrocarbons out of water and into gels, when combined with nutrients, encourages natural bioremediation. Oleophilic, hydrophobic chemical, containing no bacteria, which chemically and physically bonds to both soluble and insoluble hydrocarbons. The accelerator acts as a herding agent in water and on the surface, floating molecules such as phenol and BTEX to the surface of the water, forming gel-like agglomerations. Undetectable levels of hydrocarbons can be obtained in produced water and manageable water columns. By overspraying sheen with bioremediation accelerator, sheen is eliminated within minutes. Whether applied on land or on water, the nutrient-rich emulsion creates a bloom of local, indigenous, pre-existing, hydrocarbon-consuming bacteria. Those specific bacteria break down the hydrocarbons into water and carbon dioxide, with EPA tests showing 98% of alkanes biodegraded in 28 days; and aromatics being biodegraded 200 times faster than in nature they also sometimes use the hydrofireboom to clean the oil up by taking it away from most of the oil and burning it.

* Controlled burning can effectively reduce the amount of oil in water, if done properly. But it can only be done in low wind, and can cause air pollution.
* Dispersants can be used to dissipate oil slicks. A dispersant is either a non-surface active polymer or a surface-active substance added to a suspension, usually a colloid, to improve the separation of and to prevent settling or clumping. They may rapidly disperse large amounts of certain oil types from the sea surface by transferring it into the water column. They will cause the oil slick to break up and form water-soluble micelles that are rapidly diluted. The oil is then effectively spread throughout a larger volume of water than the surface from where the oil was dispersed. They can also delay the formation of persistent oil-in-water emulsions. However, laboratory experiments showed that dispersants increased toxic hydrocarbon levels in fish by a factor of up to 100 and may kill fish eggs. Dispersed oil droplets infiltrate into deeper water and can lethally contaminate coral. Research indicates that some dispersants are toxic to corals. A 2012 study found that Corexit dispersant had increased the toxicity of oil by up to 52 times. In 2019, the U.S. National Academies released a report analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of several response methods and tools.

* Watch and wait: in some cases, natural attenuation of oil may be most appropriate, due to the invasive nature of facilitated methods of remediation, particularly in ecologically sensitive areas such as wetlands.
* Dredging: for oils dispersed with detergents and other oils denser than water.
* Skimming: Requires calm waters at all times during the process.
* Solidifying: Solidifiers are composed of tiny, floating, dry ice pellets, and hydrophobic polymers that both adsorb and absorb. They clean up oil spills by changing the physical state of spilled oil from liquid to a solid, semi-solid or a rubber-like material that floats on water. Solidifiers are insoluble in water, therefore the removal of the solidified oil is easy and the oil will not leach out. Solidifiers have been proven to be relatively non-toxic to aquatic and wildlife and have been proven to suppress harmful vapors commonly associated with hydrocarbons such as benzene, xylene and naphtha. The reaction time for solidification of oil is controlled by the surface area or size of the polymer or dry pellets as well as the viscosity and thickness of the oil layer. Some solidifier product manufacturers claim the solidified oil can be thawed and used if frozen with dry ice or disposed of in landfills, recycled as an additive in asphalt or rubber products, or burned as a low ash fuel. A solidifier called C.I.Agent (manufactured by C.I.Agent Solutions of Louisville, Kentucky) is being used by BP in granular form, as well as in Marine and Sheen Booms at Dauphin Island and Fort Morgan, Alabama, to aid in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill cleanup.
* Vacuum and centrifuge: oil can be sucked up along with the water, and then a centrifuge can be used to separate the oil from the water – allowing a tanker to be filled with near pure oil. Usually, the water is returned to the sea, making the process more efficient, but allowing small amounts of oil to go back as well. This issue has hampered the use of centrifuges due to a United States regulation limiting the amount of oil in water returned to the sea.
* Beach Raking: coagulated oil that is left on the beach can be picked up by machinery.
Equipment used includes:
* Booms: large floating barriers that round up oil and lift the oil off the water
* Skimmers: skim the oil
* Sorbents: large absorbents that absorb oil and adsorb small droplets 
* Chemical and biological agents: helps to break down the oil
* Vacuums: remove oil from beaches and water surface
* Shovels and other road equipment: typically used to clean up oil on beaches

===Prevention===

* Secondary containment – methods to prevent releases of oil or hydrocarbons into the environment.
* Oil Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) program by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
* Double-hulling – build double hulls into vessels, which reduces the risk and severity of a spill in case of a collision or grounding. Existing single-hull vessels can also be rebuilt to have a double hull.
* Thick-hulled railroad transport tanks.

Spill response procedures should include elements such as; 
* A listing of appropriate protective clothing, safety equipment, and cleanup materials required for spill cleanup (gloves, respirators, etc.) and an explanation of their proper use; 
* Appropriate evacuation zones and procedures; 
* Availability of fire suppression equipment; 
* Disposal containers for spill cleanup materials; and 
* The first aid procedures that might be required.

===Research===
* Adaptation of the oil bee&#x27;s, e.g. &quot;Macropis fulvipes&#x27;&quot;, mechanism for harvesting flower oils has led to the biomimetic development of an additional oil spill recovery method. Oil bees have oleophilic properties in their hair-like protrusions that collect and store oil. This technique has been applied to textiles that can be used to remove oil from sea water.

==Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) mapping==
Environmental Sensitivity Indexes (ESI) are tools used to create Environmental Sensitivity Maps (ESM). ESM&#x27;s are pre-planning tools used to identify sensitive areas and resources prior to an oil spill event in order to set priorities for protection and plan clean-up strategies. It is to date the most commonly used mapping tool for sensitive area plotting. The ESI has three components: A shoreline type ranking system, a biological resources section, and a human-use resource category.

=== History and development ===
ESI is the most frequently used sensitivity mapping tool yet. It was first applied in 1979 in response to an oil-spill near Texas in the Gulf of Mexico. To this time, ESI maps were prepared merely days in advance of one&#x27;s arrival to an oil spill location. ESMs used to be atlases, maps consisting of thousands of pages that could solely work with spills in the oceans. In the past 3 decades, this product has been transformed into a versatile online tool. This conversion allows sensitivity indexing to become more adaptable and in 1995 by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) worked on the tool allowing ESI to extended maps to lakes, rivers, and estuary shoreline types. ESI maps have since become integral to  collecting, synthesizing, and producing data which have previously never been accessible in digital formats. Especially in the United States, the tool has made impressive advancements in developing tidal bay protection strategies, collecting seasonal information and generally in the modelling of sensitive areas. Together with Geographic Information System Mapping (GIS), ESI integrates their techniques to successfully geographically reference the three different types of resources.

=== Usage and application ===
The ESI depicts environmental stability, coastal resilience to maritime related catastrophes, and the configurations of a stress-response relationship between all things maritime. Created for ecological-related decision making, ESMs can accurately identify sensitive areas and habitats, clean-up responses, response measures and monitoring strategies for oil-spills. The maps allow experts from varying fields to come together and work efficiently during fast-paced response operations. 
The process of making an ESI atlas involves GIS technology. The steps involve, first zoning the area that is to be mapped, and secondly, a meeting with local and regional experts on the area and its resources. Following, all the shoreline types, biological, and human use resources need to be identified and their locations pinpointed. Once all this information is gathered, it then becomes digitized. In its digital format, classifications are set in place, tables are produced and local experts refine the product before it gets released.

ESI&#x27;s current most common use is within contingency planning. After the maps are calculated and produced, the most sensitive areas get picked out and authenticated. These areas then go through a scrutinization process throughout which methods of protection and resource assessments are obtained. This in-depth research is then put back into the ESMs to develop their accuracy and allowing for tactical information to be stored in them as well. The finished maps are then used for drills and trainings for clean-up efficiency. Trainings also often help to update the maps and tweak certain flaws that might have occurred in the previous steps.

=== ESI Categories ===

====Shoreline type====
Shoreline type is classified by rank depending on how easy the target site would be to clean up, how long the oil would persist, and how sensitive the shoreline is. The ranking system works on a 10-point scale where the higher the rank, the more sensitive a habitat or shore is. The coding system usually works in colour, where warm colours are used for the increasingly sensitive types and cooler colours are used for robust shores. For each navigable body of water, there is a feature classifying its sensitivity to oil. Shoreline type mapping codes a large range of ecological settings including estuarine, lacustrine, and riverine environments. Floating oil slicks put the shoreline at particular risk when they eventually come ashore, covering the substrate with oil. The differing substrates between shoreline types vary in their response to oiling, and influence the type of cleanup that will be required to effectively decontaminate the shoreline. Hence ESI shoreline ranking helps committees identify which clean-up techniques are approved or detrimental the natural environment. The exposure the shoreline has to wave energy and tides, substrate type, and slope of the shoreline are also taken into account—in addition to biological productivity and sensitivity. Mangroves and marshes tend to have higher ESI rankings due to the potentially long-lasting and damaging effects of both oil contamination and cleanup actions. Impermeable and exposed surfaces with high wave action are ranked lower due to the reflecting waves keeping oil from coming onshore, and the speed at which natural processes will remove the oil.

====Biological resources====
Within the biological resources, the ESI maps protected areas as well as those with bio-diverse importance. These are usually identified through the UNEP-WCMC Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool. There are varying types of coastal habitats and ecosystems and thus also many endangered species that need to be considered when looking at affected areas post oil spills. The habitats of plants and animals that may be at risk from oil spills are referred to as &quot;elements&quot; and are divided by functional group. Further classification divides each element into species groups with similar life histories and behaviors relative to their vulnerability to oil spills. There are eight element groups: birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, invertebrates, habitats and plants, wetlands, and marine mammals and terrestrial mammals. Element groups are further divided into sub-groups, for example, the ‘marine mammals’ element group is divided into dolphins, manatees, pinnipeds (seals, sea lions &amp; walruses), polar bears, sea otters and whales. Necessary when ranking and selecting species is their vulnerability to the oil spills themselves. This not only includes their reactions to such events but also their fragility, the scale of large clusters of animals, whether special life stages occur ashore, and whether any present species is threatened, endangered or rare. The way in which the biological resources are mapped is through symbols representing the species, and polygons and lines to map out the special extent of the species. The symbols also have the ability to identify the most vulnerable of a species life stages, such as the molting, nesting, hatching or migration patterns. This allows for more accurate response plans during those given periods. There is also a division for sub-tidal habitats which are equally important to coastal biodiversity including kelp, coral reefs and sea beds which are not commonly mapped within the shoreline ESI type.

====Human-use resources====
Human-use resources are also often referred to as socio-economic features, which map inanimate resources that have the potential to be directly impacted by oil pollution. Human-use resources that are mapped within the ESI will have socio-economic repercussions to an oil spill. These resources are divided into four major classifications: archaeological importance or cultural resource site, high-use recreational areas or shoreline access points, important protected management areas, and resource origins. Some examples include airports, diving sites, popular beach sites, marinas, hotels, factories, natural reserves or marine sanctuaries. When mapped, the human-use resources the need protecting must be certified by a local or regional policy maker. These resources are often extremely vulnerable to seasonal changes due to ex. fishing and tourism. For this category there are also a set of symbols available to demonstrate their importance on ESMs.

==Estimating the volume of a spill==
By observing the thickness of the film of oil and its appearance on the surface of the water, it is possible to estimate the quantity of oil spilled. If the surface area of the spill is also known, the total volume of the oil can be calculated.

Oil spill model systems are used by industry and government to assist in planning and emergency decision making. Of critical importance for the skill of the oil spill model prediction is the adequate description of the wind and current fields. There is a worldwide oil spill modelling (WOSM) program. Tracking the scope of an oil spill may also involve verifying that hydrocarbons collected during an ongoing spill are derived from the active spill or some other source. This can involve sophisticated analytical chemistry focused on finger printing an oil source based on the complex mixture of substances present. Largely, these will be various hydrocarbons, among the most useful being polyaromatic hydrocarbons. In addition, both oxygen and nitrogen heterocyclic hydrocarbons, such as parent and alkyl homologues of carbazole, quinoline, and pyridine, are present in many crude oils. As a result, these compounds have great potential to supplement the existing suite of hydrocarbons targets to fine-tune source tracking of petroleum spills. Such analysis can also be used to follow weathering and degradation of crude spills.

==Largest oil spills==

Crude oil and refined fuel spills from tanker ship accidents have damaged vulnerable ecosystems in Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, the Galapagos Islands, France, the Sundarbans and many other places. The quantity of oil spilled during accidents has ranged from a few hundred tons to several hundred thousand tons (e.g., Deepwater Horizon oil spill, &quot;Atlantic Empress&quot;, &quot;Amoco Cadiz&quot;), but volume is a limited measure of damage or impact. Smaller spills have already proven to have a great impact on ecosystems, such as the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill because of the remoteness of the site or the difficulty of an emergency environmental response.

Oil spills in the Niger Delta are among the worst on the planet and is often used as an example of ecocide. Between 1970 and 2000, there were over 7,000 spills. Between 1956 and 2006, up to 1.5 million tons of oil were spilled in the Niger Delta.

Oil spills at sea are generally much more damaging than those on land, since they can spread for hundreds of nautical miles in a thin oil slick which can cover beaches with a thin coating of oil. These can kill seabirds, mammals, shellfish and other organisms they coat. Oil spills on land are more readily containable if a makeshift earth dam can be rapidly bulldozed around the spill site before most of the oil escapes, and land animals can avoid the oil more easily.


== The economic impact of oil spills ==

Oil spills can have devastating environmental impacts; however, they often have equally detrimental economic consequences. These disasters do not only pose immediate threats to marine ecosystems, but also leave lasting impacts on local and regional economies. This section will explore the multifaceted economic repercussions of oil spills, specifically considering: the decline in tourism, the reduction in fishing, and the impact on port activity.

=== Decline in tourism ===
In the short term, an oil spill will prevent tourists from partaking in usual recreational activities such as swimming, boating, diving, and angling. As such, the area will witness a decline in tourism. This will negatively impact several industries. Firstly, the hotels, restaurants, and bars in the immediate vicinity will have significantly fewer customers. Local car park owners and shopkeepers will be affected too. Then, this decline in tourists will cause further damage to travel agencies, tour guides, and transport companies. The beaches will likely stay shut for several days whilst clean-up operations take place, and there may be disruption caused by an increase in clean-up vehicles. Overall, several businesses will be negatively impacted by the spill in the short term, which can lead to further long-term damage should companies be forced to reduce staff or shut down entirely.

Often, this process is intensified by disproportionate media attention. Usually, the affected area returns to normal relatively soon after an oil spill, as the clean-up process is fast. However, media stories will drive future tourists away, as they work to degrade the popular image of a destination with exaggerated stories of oil on beaches and deserted hotels. This aggravates the economic losses, as people continue to choose to travel elsewhere. Such a scenario is particularly damaging for regions which are very reliant on the tourism industry. For example, the Brazilian Northeast can be very vulnerable to drops in tourism, thus, they were badly impacted following a 2500 tonne crude oil spill from an unknown tanker in 2019.

Similarly, tourism in Ibiza was severely impacted in 2007. Just 20 tonnes of oil were spilled from the Don Pedro in July 2007, a relatively limited volume compared with other spills. Whilst this caused just a small amount of environmental damage, the economic damage was disproportionately large. Most beaches were reopened within a week, just a dozen seabirds were affected, and there were no reports of injured sea mammals. Nonetheless, 27 percent of hotels in Ibiza were negatively affected, with two thirds of these being seafront hotels. Thus, 32 claims were made by tourist firms, equating to approximately 1.5 million euros of compensation. This provides a clear example of an oil spill resulting in massive economic disaster. Furthermore, following the world&#x27;s largest oil spill, the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill in 2010, the U.S. Travel Association estimated 23 billion dollars’ worth of associated costs for affected tourist infrastructure.

=== Reduction in fishing ===
After the Deepwater Horizon crisis, the Gulf of Mexico suffered an estimated 1.9-billion-dollar loss in revenue from fishing. This is because fishing closures were imposed due to fears of the safety of seafood, there was also a decline in demand, as seafood restaurants and markets suffered such severe losses that many were forced to shut. Usually, the Gulf sees an average of 106,703 fishing trips per day, equating to 1 million metric tonnes of annual fishery landings. Therefore, the necessary fishing ban following the disaster was highly damaging. Similarly, following the sinking of the Prestige oil tanker near Galicia, Spain, in November 2002, 77,000 tonnes of crude oil were spilled into the ocean. This disaster has had severe economic consequences, alongside the environmental damage. Large zones were cordoned in which fishing was banned, with these bans lasting for more than eight months. This affected several groups, including fishermen, ship owners, and the companies who bought and sold the fish. Several compensatory actions were introduced, including tax benefits and aid. This resulted in expenses of approximately 113 million euros in an attempt to compensate for the halt in fishing activity. The examples of the Deepwater Horizon and the Prestige clearly illustrate the severe economic consequences when oil spills prevent commercial fishing.

Water pollution due to oil spills can be severe, often resulting in the death or injury of many sea creatures, including birds, sea mammals, fish, algae, and coral. The impact on fish caught in the spill has both immediate and longer-term impacts. Immediately, the fish are tainted with oil, and they cannot be used commercially due to safety reasons. Then, the oil can spread and sink below the water&#x27;s surface. If fish swallow the oil, they are also inconsumable due to the health risk posed to humans. Therefore, massive economic damage is caused to the fishing industry following an oil spill, as the stock is vastly reduced. Furthermore, the oil can cause damage to the equipment and boats of fishermen. Clean-up operations can also interrupt usual fishing routes, and sometimes fishing bans are imposed. This further illustrates the damaging economic effects of oil spills on commercial fishing, which is particularly detrimental for regions whose economy relies heavily on fishing.

=== The impact on port activity ===
Ports are major hubs for economic activity; thus, an oil spill in or near a port can have significant consequences. During and following a spill, all boats entering or leaving the port must be closely managed in order to prevent further spread. Furthermore, specialist cleaning contractors must be hired to effectively clean the various port structures. Oil spills are relatively regular occurrences in ports, as small spills often happen due to the large volume of boats, and these are not as well documented in the media as larger events are. However, these spills must still be dealt with, and they can still have damaging economic repercussions. Both the incident and the response require expensive and time-consuming management which is disruptive to port activity. Furthermore, special care must be taken during clean-up operations to ensure that the oil does not get stuck under the quayside, as this could act as a continual source of oil contamination. This can also be seen with sea defenses; should the oil penetrate deep into the structures, they may become a source of secondary pollution. Therefore, it is crucial for ports to manage and mitigate any oil spills, in order to limit the damage to ships and shipping operations. Otherwise, should large disruption occur, the economic damage can be extensive due to costly clean-up processes and delayed shipments.

=== Summary ===
The economic impact of oil spills on tourism, fishing, and ports is substantial and important to assess. Coordinated efforts are necessary to mitigate these impacts, including effective clean-up measures, public relations campaigns to restore the image of affected areas, and support for businesses and communities that must bear the economic downturn.

<text>is a Japanese guitarist. Other guitarists such as Luke Takamura and Sugizo have cited him as an influence.

==Career==
Watanabe learned guitar at the age of 12 from Sadanori Nakamure at the Yamaha Music School in Tokyo. He released his first album in 1971. In 1979, he formed a jazz rock band with some of Japan&#x27;s leading studio musicians, and recorded the album &quot;Kylyn&quot;. During that year, he toured with the pop band Yellow Magic Orchestra.

In the 1980s, he toured as guest soloist with Steps, the Brecker Brothers, and Word of Mouth, led by Jaco Pastorius. Watanabe created the jazz-rock/jazz-fusion band Mobo in 1983 with Mitsuru Sawamura (saxophone), Ichiko Hashimoto (piano), Gregg Lee (bass), Shuichi Murakami (drums), and Kiyohiko Senba.

During the eighties Watanabe released the jazz-rock albums &quot;To Chi Ka&quot; (1980), &quot;Mobo Club&quot; (1983), &quot;Mobo Splash&quot; (1985), and &quot;Spice of Life&quot; (1987). A DVD was issued from the tour which featured drummer Bill Bruford and bassist Jeff Berlin, who also played on the record.

In the 1990s Kazumi assembled an all-Japanese line-up called Resonance Vox (Vagabonde Suzuki on bass, Rikiya Higashihara on drums, Yahiro Tomohiro on percussion). This band has released several adventurous fusion albums.

On February 27, 2024, he collapsed at his home in Karuizawa and was transported by ambulance. On March 31 of the same year, as a result of scrutiny, it was reported on the official website that he was diagnosed with cerebral stem hemorrhage with impaired consciousness and that he was in hospitalized, and that he would cancel all artist activities scheduled for this year based on the doctor&#x27;s diagnosis and concentrate on treatment.

<doc id="158714" wikidata="Q1750535" url="?curid=158714" title="The Poisoned Chocolates Case">
<text>The Poisoned Chocolates Case (1929) is a detective novel by Anthony Berkeley set in 1920s London in which a group of armchair detectives, who have founded the &quot;Crimes Circle&quot;, formulate theories on a recent murder case Scotland Yard has been unable to solve. Each of the six members, including their president, Berkeley&#x27;s amateur sleuth Roger Sheringham, arrives at an altogether different solution as to the motive and the identity of the perpetrator, and also applies different methods of detection (basically deductive or inductive or a combination of both). Completely devoid of brutality but containing a lot of subtle, tongue-in-cheek humour instead, &quot;The Poisoned Chocolates Case&quot; is one of the classic whodunnits of the Golden Age of Detective Fiction. As at least six plausible explanations of what really happened are put forward one after the other, the reader—just like the members of the Crimes Circle themselves—is kept guessing right up to the final pages of the book.

==Plot introduction==
One of the most unusual, and possibly unique, features of the book is that, while it appears at first sight to be an expanded version of Berkeley&#x27;s short story &quot;The Avenging Chance&quot;, the eventual solution of the crime in the full-length novel is quite different from that in the short story. (In fact, the solution of &quot;The Avenging Chance&quot; is one of the suggested explanations in the novel which turns out to be false.)

==Plot summary==

===Case===
After arriving at his London club at 10:30 am precisely, which he has been doing every morning for many years, Sir Eustace Pennefather, a known womanizer whose divorce from his current wife is pending, receives a complimentary box of chocolates through the post. Disapproving of such modern marketing techniques, Sir Eustace is about to throw away the chocolates in disgust but changes his mind when he learns that Graham Bendix, another member of the club whom he hardly knows, has lost a bet with his wife Joan and now owes her a box of chocolates. Bendix takes the box home and, after lunch, tries out the new confectionery together with his wife. A few hours later Joan Bendix is dead, whereas her husband, who has eaten far fewer chocolates, is taken seriously ill and hospitalized (but later recovers). The police can establish a few facts beyond any doubt: that the parcel was posted the previous evening near The Strand; that the poison that was injected into each of the chocolates is nitrobenzene; and that the accompanying letter was typewritten on a piece of stationery from the manufacturers of the chocolates but not composed or sent by them.

Quite soon in the police investigations it becomes evident that the intended victim was Sir Eustace himself rather than the innocent Joan Bendix: no criminal could have predicted Sir Eustace giving away the box of chocolates to a man he hardly knew who just happened to be present when it was delivered. However, at a loss as to the further details of the crime, Scotland Yard conclude that the sender must have been some maniac or a fanatic trying to rid society of one of its most immoral members.

===Theories===
Worthy pillars of society including a barrister, a writer of detective novels, and a female author, the members of Roger Sheringham&#x27;s Crimes Circle go about individually solving the case. After a week has passed, they present their findings on consecutive nights to their colleagues. Not surprisingly, they come up with various suspects: Sir Eustace&#x27;s estranged wife; the father of a young lady whom Sir Eustace intended to marry after his divorce got through; one of Sir Eustace&#x27;s discarded mistresses; and some more. At the very end of the novel, however, there is no doubt as to the identity of the perpetrator.

<doc id="158715" wikidata="Q1572702" url="?curid=158715" title="Radiator">
<text>A radiator is a heat exchanger used to transfer thermal energy from one medium to another for the purpose of cooling and heating. The majority of radiators are constructed to function in cars, buildings, and electronics.

A radiator is always a source of heat to its environment, although this may be for either the purpose of heating an environment, or for cooling the fluid or coolant supplied to it, as for automotive engine cooling and HVAC dry cooling towers. Despite the name, most radiators transfer the bulk of their heat via convection instead of thermal radiation.

==History==
The Roman hypocaust is an early example of a type of radiator for building space heating. Franz San Galli, a Prussian-born Russian businessman living in St. Petersburg, is credited with inventing the heating radiator around 1855, having received a radiator patent in 1857, but American Joseph Nason and Scot Rory Gregor developed a primitive radiator in 1841 and received a number of U.S. patents for hot water and steam heating.

==Radiation and convection==

Heat transfer from a radiator occurs by two mechanisms: thermal radiation and convection into flowing air or liquid. Conduction is not normally a major source of heat transfer in radiators. A radiator may even transfer heat by phase change, for example, drying a pair of socks. In practice, the term &quot;radiator&quot; refers to any of a number of devices in which a liquid circulates through exposed pipes (often with fins or other means of increasing surface area). The term &quot;convector&quot; refers to a class of devices in which the source of heat is not directly exposed.

To increase the surface area available for heat exchange with the surroundings, a radiator will have multiple fins, in contact with the tube carrying liquid pumped through the radiator. Air (or other exterior fluid) in contact with the fins carries off heat. If air flow is obstructed by dirt or damage to the fins, that portion of the radiator is ineffective at heat transfer.

==Heating==
Radiators are commonly used to heat buildings on the European continent. In a radiative central heating system, hot water or sometimes steam is generated in a central boiler and circulated by pumps through radiators within the building, where this heat is transferred to the surroundings.

In some countries, portable radiators are common to heat a single room, as a safer alternative to space heater and fan heater.

== Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning ==

Radiators are used in dry cooling towers and closed-loop cooling towers for cooling buildings using liquid-cooled chillers for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) while keeping the chiller coolant isolated from the surroundings.

==Engine cooling==

Radiators are used for cooling internal combustion engines, mainly in automobiles but also in piston-engined aircraft, railway locomotives, motorcycles, stationary generating plants and other places where heat engines are used (watercrafts, having an unlimited supply of a relatively cool water outside, usually use the liquid-liquid heat exchangers instead).

To cool down the heat engine, a coolant is passed through the engine block, where it absorbs heat from the engine. The hot coolant is then fed into the inlet tank of the radiator (located either on the top of the radiator, or along one side), from which it is distributed across the radiator core through tubes to another tank on the opposite end of the radiator. As the coolant passes through the radiator tubes on its way to the opposite tank, it transfers much of its heat to the tubes which, in turn, transfer the heat to the fins that are lodged between each row of tubes. The fins then release the heat to the ambient air. Fins are used to greatly increase the contact surface of the tubes to the air, thus increasing the exchange efficiency. The cooled liquid is fed back to the engine, and the cycle repeats. Normally, the radiator does not reduce the temperature of the coolant back to ambient air temperature, but it is still sufficiently cooled to keep the engine from overheating.

This coolant is usually water-based, with the addition of glycols to prevent freezing and other additives to limit corrosion, erosion and cavitation. However, the coolant may also be an oil. The first engines used thermosiphons to circulate the coolant; today, however, all but the smallest engines use pumps.

Up to the 1980s, radiator cores were often made of copper (for fins) and brass (for tubes, headers, and side-plates, while tanks could also be made of brass or of plastic, often a polyamide). Starting in the 1970s, use of aluminium increased, eventually taking over the vast majority of vehicular radiator applications. The main inducements for aluminium are reduced weight and cost.

Since air has a lower heat capacity and density than liquid coolants, a fairly large volume flow rate (relative to the coolant&#x27;s) must be blown through the radiator core to capture the heat from the coolant. Radiators often have one or more fans that blow air through the radiator. To save fan power consumption in vehicles, radiators are often behind the grille at the front end of a vehicle. Ram air can give a portion or all of the necessary cooling air flow when the coolant temperature remains below the system&#x27;s designed maximum temperature, and the fan remains disengaged.

==Electronics and computers==
As electronic devices become smaller, the problem of dispersing waste heat becomes more difficult. Tiny radiators known as heat sinks are used to convey heat from the electronic components into a cooling air stream. Heatsinks do not use water, rather they conduct the heat from the source. High-performance heat sinks have copper to conduct better. Heat is transferred to the air by conduction and convection; a relatively small proportion of heat is transferred by radiation owing to the low temperature of semiconductor devices compared to their surroundings.

Radiators are also used in liquid cooling loops for rejecting heat.

==Spacecraft==

Radiators are found as components of some spacecraft. These radiators work by radiating heat energy away as light (generally infrared given the temperatures at which spacecraft try to operate) because in the vacuum of space neither convection nor conduction can work to transfer heat away. On the International Space Station, these can be seen clearly as large white panels attached to the main truss. They can be found on both crewed and uncrewed craft.

<doc id="158716" wikidata="Q4978729" url="?curid=158716" title="Bruiser Brody">
<text>Frank Donald Goodish (June 18, 1946 – July 17, 1988) was an American professional wrestler who earned his greatest fame under the ring name Bruiser Brody. He also worked as King Kong Brody, the Masked Marauder, and Red River Jack. Over the years Brody became synonymous with the hardcore wrestling brawling style that often saw one or more of the participants bleeding by the time the match was over. In his prime he worked as a &quot;special attraction&quot; wrestler in North America, making select appearances for various promotions such as World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW), World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), Central States Wrestling (CSW), Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF), and the American Wrestling Association (AWA) among other events. He worked regularly in Japan for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW).

Behind the scenes Brody was very protective of his &quot;in-ring&quot; image, hardly ever agreeing to lose matches and building a reputation of being volatile; he would on occasion intentionally hit or hurt opponents during a match contrary to the predetermined nature of professional wrestling. His in-ring work and wrestling persona earned him an induction in the professional wrestling hall of fame, St. Louis Wrestling Hall of Fame, Southern Wrestling Hall of Fame, Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame and the WWE Hall of Fame.

Brody died in 1988 from stab wounds suffered backstage in a shower during a wrestling event in Puerto Rico. The killer was José González, better known as Invader 1. A jury acquitted González of murder, ruling that González killed Brody in self-defense. Key witnesses to the killing did not give testimony at González&#x27; trial due to their summonses only being received after the trial had concluded. 

==Early life==
Goodish was an All-State football and basketball player at Warren High School, Michigan, and played football at West Texas A&amp;M University (then known as West Texas State) and with four teams over three seasons in the Texas Football League and Continental Football League.
He stood 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighed 251 lbs.

== Professional wrestling career ==

After attending West Texas A&amp;M and working as a sportswriter Goodish was trained to wrestle by Fritz Von Erich. He first wrestled in Dallas - Fort Worth and later Louisiana. As Bruiser Brody and King Kong Brody (the latter, a name he used in Midwestern promotions out of respect for Dick the Bruiser), Goodish competed as a freelancer in several companies including the Central States Wrestling (CSW), World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), Southwest Championship Wrestling (SCW), Windy City Wrestling, World Wrestling Council (WWC), Deep South Wrestling (DSW), Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF), American Wrestling Association (AWA), and World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW). In the States, he had numerous feuds with the likes of Kamala the Ugandan Giant, Abdullah the Butcher, and &quot;Crusher&quot; Jerry Blackwell. In Japan, he was in a tag team with Stan Hansen. Brody had a reputation for refusing to job to other wrestlers. He also competed under the moniker of Red River Jack in Texas, during an angle against Gary Hart&#x27;s men and Skandor Akbar&#x27;s Army in World Class Championship Wrestling. Brody also competed as the Masked Marauder at one time in the AWA. In 1976, he went to Vince J. McMahon&#x27;s WWWF where he challenged WWWF Champion Bruno Sammartino, but was unsuccessful in winning the championship. Brody also teamed with Big John Studd. It was also in the WWWF where he wrestled Invader 1 (José González), for whom he refused to sell.

In 1985, he had a very short stint with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) in a feud with Antonio Inoki and many of their matches ended in no contests or disqualifications. In 1987, Brody began working primarily for the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico after getting fired from New Japan. Brody continued his feud with Abdullah the Butcher, as well as engaging in a feud with Carlos Colon. He briefly returned to All Japan Pro Wrestling to win his last NWA International Heavyweight Championship. On April 15, 1988, the first attempt to form what became the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship was done when Brody faced off against NWA United National and PWF champion Genichiro Tenryu; the result was a double countout. Brody lost the title to Jumbo Tsuruta four days later. In WCCW in Texas he was actually a babyface, most often against Abdullah The Butcher. However against Abdullah in Montreal he was a heel managed by Floyd Creatchman. While there Tim &quot;Killer&quot; Brooks acted as his brother Buster Brody. Brody was in an ongoing feud with The Russian Brute who later went on to AWA fame with Manager Ox Baker. Due to his huge reputation in Japan promoter Shohei Baba had the match taped and later aired on Japanese TV.

In Florida he beat B. Brian Blair for the Florida State championship. Brody had an infamous cage match with Lex Luger in Florida on January 21, 1987. In the middle of the match, Brody stopped &quot;working&quot; and stood around. Luger and Bill Alfonso, the referee of the match, were puzzled and attempted to speak to Brody who did not respond. Luger and Alfonso decided to forgo the planned finish of the match and Alfonso disqualified Luger in a spot where Luger shoved Alfonso to the ground. After the match, Luger recalls asking Brody if he did anything wrong to upset him, to which Brody responded &quot;no&quot;, and Brody&#x27;s reasons for not working were not very clear, stating that &quot;the match just wasn&#x27;t working&quot;. In Larry Matysik&#x27;s book, &quot;Wrestling at the Chase&quot;, Matysik states that before the match Brody told him &quot;I&#x27;m not putting up with any of his bullshit&quot; and that Brody was upset that Luger would not sell for him. However, when watching the match, it is clear that Luger did sell for Brody. In a later shoot interview, Bill Alfonso said that there was a miscommunication issue on who would lead the match and there was no ill will ever between the two. Another scenario was that Brody was upset with the promoters over his paychecks (Brody had a contentious history with wrestling promoters for much of his career) and decided to embarrass the promotion by being uncooperative in the match. In 1987 he returned to the AWA where he fought Greg Gagne and Jerry Blackwell. Despite his reputation as being disagreeable with promoters he would aid any who needed a boost in ticket sales as he was guaranteed to bring in crowds. While working for WCCW in Texas he was the booker and produced their TV program.

== Personal life ==
Prior to his wrestling career, Goodish worked as a sportswriter in San Antonio, Texas. Goodish was married on June 4, 1968, to Nola Marie Neece; the marriage ended in divorce on October 12, 1970. Goodish&#x27;s second wife, New Zealander Barbara Smith, remained with him until his death in 1988. She has stated that while his wrestling persona was known for brutality and being uncontrollable, Brody was the complete opposite with his family. Brody and Smith lived in Texas. Together they had a son named Geoffrey Dean, born November 7, 1980.

== Death ==
On July 16, 1988, Brody was in the locker room before his scheduled match with Dan Spivey at Juan Ramón Loubriel Stadium in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, when José Huertas González, a fellow wrestler and booker, allegedly asked him to step into the shower area to discuss business. There was an argument between the two wrestlers and a scuffle ensued. Due to the dressing room layout, there were no witnesses to the altercation; however, two screams were heard, loud enough for the entire locker room to hear. Tony Atlas ran to the shower and saw Brody bent over and holding his stomach. Atlas then looked up at González and saw him holding a bloody knife.

Due to the heavy traffic outdoors and large crowd in the stadium, it took paramedics almost an hour to reach Brody. When the paramedics arrived, Atlas helped carry Brody downstairs to the waiting ambulance as, due to Brody&#x27;s size, paramedics were unable to lift him. He later died from his stab wounds. González claimed self-defense and testified in his own defense at trial in 1989. The prosecution witnesses living outside of Puerto Rico claimed they had not received their summons until after the trial had ended. The case was not dismissed for their absence, nor were they charged with contempt of the Puerto Rico court. González was acquitted of murder. The prosecution did not appeal.

Fellow wrestlers Dutch Mantel and Tony Atlas have said in a lengthy interview featured in Vice documentary series &quot;Dark Side of the Ring season 1 episode 3&quot; entitled &quot;The Killing of Bruiser Brody&quot; that in the 1970s, when Brody and González had wrestled each other, Brody had wrestled very roughly and beat up González. S. D. Jones claims after one such match González said to him &quot;one day I am gonna kill that man&quot;. Tony Atlas also said the local police were uninformed, and thought the killer was an angry wrestling fan gone berserk. Atlas also claims that he was the only witness to point out González to the authorities, so they could arrest him. In the same documentary, according to Atlas, Bruiser Brody was about to gain ownership in the wrestling company, even promising him &quot;&quot;you are going to see a lot of changes&quot;, implying that González might eventually be fired. Atlas recalls González, Víctor Quiñones, and Carlos Colón were having an urgent meeting in the locker room only moments prior to the tragic events, while Mantel said the meeting seemed &quot;strange&quot;. Shortly after, González called out Brody in the shower &quot;can I talk to you for a minute please&quot; then the stabbing ensued. Ultimately, the murder weapon has never been found, González aka &quot;Invader&quot; was acquitted in Puerto Rico for acting under self-defense, and Bruiser Brody&#x27;s widow Barbara Goodish told the reporters &quot;I know the attacker did it, from what I hear about it the whole court case was a sham&quot;&quot;. Vice producers for &quot;Dark Side of the Ring&quot; say they contacted González and Colón, but that both &quot;declined to be interviewed&quot;.

<doc id="158717" wikidata="Q1323473" url="?curid=158717" title="Ekpyrotic universe">
<text>The ekpyrotic universe () is a cosmological model of the early universe that explains the origin of the large-scale structure of the cosmos. The model has also been incorporated in the cyclic universe theory (or ekpyrotic cyclic universe theory), which proposes a complete cosmological history, both the past and future.

== Origins ==

The original ekpyrotic model was introduced by Justin Khoury, Burt Ovrut, Paul Steinhardt and Neil Turok in 2001.

Steinhardt created the name based on the Ancient Greek word ekpyrosis (ἐκπύρωσις, &quot;conflagration&quot;), which refers to a Stoic cosmological model in which the universe is caught in an eternal cycle of fiery birth, cooling and rebirth.

The theory addresses the fundamental question that remains unanswered by the Big Bang inflationary model, &quot;What happened before the Big Bang?&quot; The explanation, according to the ekpyrotic theory, is that the Big Bang was actually a big bounce, a transition from a previous epoch of contraction to the present epoch of expansion. The key events that shaped our universe occurred before the bounce, and, in a cyclic version, the universe bounces at regular intervals.

== Applications of the theory ==

The original ekpyrotic models relied on string theory, branes and extra dimensions, but most contemporary ekpyrotic and cyclic models use the same physical ingredients as inflationary models (quantum fields evolving in ordinary space-time). Like Big Bang cosmology, the ekpyrotic theory has accurately described essential features of our universe. It predicts a uniform, flat universe with patterns of hot spots and cold spots, in agreement with observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), observations confirmed to higher precision by the WMAP and Planck satellite experiments. Observation of a CMB has long been considered evidence of the Big Bang, but proponents of the ekpyrotic and cyclic theories contend that the CMB is also consistent with a Big Bounce as posited in those models. Other researchers argue that data from the Planck observations of the CMB &quot;significantly limit the viable parameter space of the ekpyrotic/cyclic scenarios.&quot; Primordial gravitational waves, if ever observed, may help scientists distinguish between various theories about the origin of the universe.

== Implications for cosmology ==

An advantage of ekpyrotic and cyclic models is that they do not produce a multiverse. This is important because when the effects of quantum fluctuations are properly included in the Big Bang inflationary model, they prevent the universe from achieving the uniformity and flatness that the cosmologists are trying to explain. Instead, inflated quantum fluctuations cause the universe to break up into patches with every conceivable combination of physical properties. Instead of making clear predictions, the Big Bang inflationary theory allows any outcome, so that the properties we observe may be viewed as random chance, resulting from the particular patch of the multiverse in which the Earth resides. Most regions of the multiverse would have very different properties.

Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg has suggested that if the multiverse is true, “the hope of finding a rational explanation for the precise values of quark masses and other constants of the standard model that we observe in our Big Bang is doomed, for their values would be an accident of the particular part of the multiverse in which we live.”

The idea that the properties of our universe are an accident and come from a theory that allows a multiverse of other possibilities is hard to reconcile with the fact that the universe is extraordinarily simple (uniform and flat) on large scales and that elementary particles appear to be described by simple symmetries and interactions. Also, the accidental concept cannot be falsified by an experiment since any future experiments can be viewed as yet other accidental aspects.

In ekpyrotic and cyclic models, smoothing and flattening occurs during a period of slow contraction, so quantum fluctuations are not inflated and cannot produce a multiverse. As a result, the ekpyrotic and cyclic models predict simple physical properties that are consistent with current experimental evidence without producing a multiverse.

<text>The Kazon () are a fictional alien race in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. Developed by &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; series&#x27; co-creators Rick Berman, Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor, the Kazon serve as the primary antagonists during the show&#x27;s first two seasons. They are represented as a nomadic species divided into eighteen separate sects, and characterized by their reliance on violence. A patriarchal society, the Kazon have a low opinion of women, and place pride in men becoming warriors and proving themselves in battle. The Kazon storylines frequently revolve around the attempts of Jal Culluh and his Kazon sect to steal technology from the USS &quot;Voyager&quot;, with the assistance of former &quot;Voyager&quot; ensign Seska. During the second season, the &quot;Voyager&quot; crew uncover more about the alien species&#x27; history and culture through a temporary truce. In their final major appearance, the Kazon successfully commandeer &quot;Voyager&quot;, but are eventually forced to surrender and retreat. The alien species have minor cameo appearances and references in the show&#x27;s subsequent seasons, and have also been included in &quot;Star Trek Online&quot; and novels set in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.

Inspired by gangs like the Crips and Bloods, the Kazon were seen by the show&#x27;s co-creators as an apt metaphor for the fears and anxieties surrounding cities and gangs during the seasons&#x27; broadcast. The Kazon were developed as one of three new alien species that could be expanded as recurring antagonists. The other two were the Vidiians and the Sikarians. Michael Westmore was the primary make-up supervisor involved in the creation of the Kazon&#x27;s appearance. Piller originally planned to cast young actors between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five exclusively, but decided to cast older and more experienced performers as they tested better during the audition process. &quot;Voyager&quot;″s writing team dedicated a large portion of season two to the development of the alien species, with Piller writing a paper on them that would be used for the development of the Kazon-centric episodes. The Kazon were removed from the series following the season three premiere as the co-creators felt that their continued presence would strain the credibility of &quot;Voyager&quot;″s journey home.

Critical response to the Kazon was generally negative. Some reviewers praised their ability to capture &quot;Voyager&quot; and maroon its crew on a desolate planet, while others felt they were poorly developed copies of Klingons and that the second season focused too much on them. The Kazon were included on several lists ranking the worst villains in &quot;Star Trek&quot; history, and were cited as an example of the racist implications in the franchise&#x27;s alien species. During her re-watching of the series, &quot;TrekToday&quot; Michelle Erica Green provided extensive criticism of the alien species, questioning the decision to feature them as the primary antagonists instead of the Vidiians, and Captain Kathryn Janeway&#x27;s refusal to share technology with them. The Kazon were also poorly received by the show&#x27;s cast members, who did not find them to be strong villains or compelling additions to the narrative.

== Appearances ==
===&quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;===
The Kazon appear as the principal antagonists for &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;″s first two seasons. Introduced in the series premiere &quot;Caretaker&quot;, they are shown as oppressors of the Ocampa, another alien race. The Ocampa Kes (Jennifer Lien) is first seen as a slave to the Kazon, and the Talaxian Neelix (Ethan Phillips) is revealed to have completed business deals with the alien species in the past. After seeing a display of the advanced technology on USS &quot;Voyager&quot;, specifically the replicator and transporter, the Kazon develop schemes to steal these machines and incorporate them into their own ships. Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) refuses to provide the hostile alien species with any information regarding &quot;Voyager&quot;″s technology because of her fear of upsetting the power dynamics in the Delta Quadrant and thus violating the Prime Directive. Over subsequent episodes, the crew of the Maquis cell led by Chakotay (Robert Beltran)—which had been pursued by &quot;Voyager&quot; into the Delta Quadrant—merge with &quot;Voyager&quot; Starfleet crew. In &quot;State of Flux&quot;, the &quot;Voyager&quot; crew encounter Jal Culluh (Anthony De Longis), a Kazon sect leader and the series&#x27; primary Kazon character. In this episode, &quot;Voyager&quot; ensign Seska (Martha Hackett) is revealed to be a Cardassian agent who had infiltrated Chakotay&#x27;s Maquis cell, subsequently objecting to the merging of crews, and Janeway&#x27;s refusal to violate the Prime Directive. Seska secretly funnels information to the Kazon in order to build an alliance with the alien species and expedite &quot;Voyager&quot;″s journey home. After being caught while attempting to deliver replicator technology to the Kazon, Seska leaves &quot;Voyager&quot; to join them and becomes Culluh&#x27;s lover and primary adviser.

During &quot;Initiations&quot;, Chakotay becomes entangled with Kar (Aron Eisenberg), a young Kazon attempting to complete a rite of passage, and tries to act as a mentor for him. In &quot;Maneuvers&quot;, Seska sets up a trap, resulting in the Kazon stealing a transporter module from &quot;Voyager&quot;. She advises Culluh to engineer the technology into the Kazon ships and use it to unite all Kazon sects with him as leader. Chakotay goes on a solo mission aiming to recover the technology, but is captured and tortured by Seska and Culluh. The &quot;Voyager&quot; crew rescue Chakotay, only to discover that Seska had extracted his DNA and used it to impregnate herself. Following this turn of events, Janeway attempts to form an alliance with the Kazon to secure safe passage through their area of space. During this process, the crew meet with the Trabe, an alien species who were persecuted by the Kazon following a violent feud. Janeway decides to ally with the Trabe and sets up a peace conference at the suggestion of Mabus (Charles O. Lucia), a Trabe leader. However, the &quot;Voyager&quot; crew discover that the Trabe mistreated the Kazon in the past and want to use the meeting as a trap to assassinate the Kazon leaders. Janeway stops the massacre from occurring, but relations between &quot;Voyager&quot;, the Kazon, and the other alien species in the Delta Quadrant are further strained as a result.

The Kazon make minor appearances in &quot;Threshold&quot;, &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, and &quot;Lifesigns&quot; as Seska helps them construct a plan to commandeer &quot;Voyager&quot;. In &quot;Investigations&quot;, Neelix notices that one of the ship&#x27;s crew is sending coded messages to the Kazon, and he uses his morning news program to track down the traitor. Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill) helps Neelix by exhibiting poor and aggressive behavior to set up an appearance that he is willing to sabotage &quot;Voyager&quot; to elicit contact from the traitor. Neelix discovers that Michael Jonas (Raphael Sbarge), a &quot;Voyager&quot; crewmember who was formerly part of Chakotay&#x27;s Marquis cell, is feeding Seska information regarding warp technology; Jonas is then killed in a fight with Neelix. The two-part episode &quot;Basics&quot; serves as the final major storyline for the Kazon in the series. Seska sends &quot;Voyager&quot; a distress call following the birth of her child and Culluh&#x27;s discovery that he was not the father. Chakotay convinces Janeway and the rest of the crew to rescue Seska and his son from the Kazon, but they discover it is a trap to ambush &quot;Voyager&quot;. The Kazon takes control of the starship and maroons its crew on a seemingly desolate planet; The Doctor (Robert Picardo) and the troubled crewman Lon Suder (Brad Dourif) are the only two crew members left on board &quot;Voyager&quot;. The Doctor reveals to a disappointed Seska that Culluh, not Chakotay, is the father of her child. The &quot;Voyager&quot; crew retake the ship after Suder sacrifices himself to sabotage its phaser weapon systems. Seska is killed by an exploding console in the ensuing fight, and Culluh takes his child and leaves with the rest of the Kazon.

Even though the Kazon are not prominent beyond &quot;Basics&quot;, they are referenced in subsequent seasons. In the fourth season, Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) reveals that the Borg never assimilate the Kazon, whom they refer to as species 329 and &quot;unworthy of assimilation&quot; due to a belief they would &quot;detract from perfection&quot;. A Kazon crew member was included on a holographic reconstruction of &quot;Voyager&quot; as a warship. The Kazon also appear in both &quot;Relativity&quot; and &quot;Shattered&quot;, which deal with time travel. In both episodes, characters visit the point at which Seska and the Kazon were in control of &quot;Voyager&quot;.

===Other appearances===
The Kazon are included in &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed by Cryptic Studios based on the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. In the game, which is set in the 25th century, 30 years after the events of &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;, the sect Kazon-Nistrim is classified as a rising power after a new leader took control away from Culluh. He is identified as &quot;hungry for power and eager to make a name for himself&quot; and &quot;more cunning and intelligent than most Kazon&quot;.

The Kazon also appear in novels based on the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, including &quot;Mosaic&quot; and &quot;Pathways&quot;, both written by &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; co-creator Jeri Taylor. In &quot;Mosaic&quot;, the Kazon launch an ambush against &quot;Voyager&quot; by drawing the crew into battle against a Kazon warship in a dense nebula. At the same time, Kazon warriors pursue an away team, led by Tuvok, which was tasked to explore a wilderness planet. The novel focuses on Janeway&#x27;s dilemma whether to help the away team or the ship&#x27;s crew, and is intercut with flashbacks to her childhood and training at Starfleet Academy. During the events of &quot;Pathways&quot;, Kes recounts her first encounters with the Kazon. The Kazon also appear in the mirror universe presented in Keith DeCandido&#x27;s short story &quot;The Mirror-Scale Serpent&quot;, published in the collection &quot;Obsidian Alliances&quot;. In this universe, &quot;Voyager&quot; was never stranded in the Delta Quadrant. Rather than being rescued by Neelix and &quot;Voyager&quot;″s crew, Kes uses her psionic powers to kill all of her Kazon captors.

In 1996, an action figure of a Kazon was released as part of a second wave of Playmates Toys&#x27; &quot;Star Trek&quot; merchandise. The same year, Applause produced a ceramic mug whose design was based on the face of a generic Kazon male. Several figures on Kazon spacecraft were released by Revell, such as those for the raider ship and torpedo. Revell included the raider ship figurine as a part of a three-piece set, along with ones for a Maquis ship and &quot;USS Voyager&quot;.

== Characteristics ==

=== History and politics ===
In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, prior to the arrival of &quot;Voyager&quot; in the Delta Quadrant, hostilities between the Trabe and the Kazon led to the Trabe keeping them subjugated. Violence between the Kazon was encouraged to limit the risk of them rising up against the Trabe. Before being conquered by the Trabe, the Kazon were the most advanced society in the quadrant. On stardate 2346, Jal Sankur united the sects into the Kazon Order or the Kazon Collective to overthrow the Trabe. The Kazon stole the Trabe&#x27;s technology and ships and, rather than settle on a new homeworld, became a nomadic species. After achieving independence from the Trabe, the Kazon continued to fight among themselves for control of resources and technology.

In &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, the Kazon are known under the collective title of the Kazon Order, but the species are also separated into various sections. While the official &quot;Star Trek&quot; website lists the Kazon as having eighteen sects, the episode &quot;Initiations&quot; represents the number of sects as highly unstable and changing every day. Only eight groups were named in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;: Kazon-Halik, Kazon-Ogla, Kazon-Oglamar, Kazon-Relora, Kazon-Nistrim, Kazon-Mostral, Kazon-Hobii, and Kazon-Pommar. The sects are portrayed as &quot;blood enemies&quot; who rarely make attempts at diplomacy or forge alliances. At the time that &quot;Voyager&quot; passed through Kazon-occupied space, the Kazon-Ogla and Kazon-Relora were the most powerful of the eight, controlling the most members and ships. A Kazon who does not belong to a sect is viewed as a &quot;Goven&quot; or an outcast. The title &quot;first maje&quot; is used to reference the leader of a sect. The political structure of the Kazon is built around &quot;political killings inside the sects as well as between sects&quot;, with peace perceived as an impossible construct.

=== Culture and technology ===
During &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, Kazon society was represented as patriarchal as males reacted negatively to orders from women. Kazon women are never shown on the series, and are only referenced through dialogue by the Kazon men. Young Kazon males are raised as warriors, undergoing a rite of passage ritual to earn their adult names. The honorific title &quot;Jal&quot; given to a young Kazon male marks their transition into adulthood; it is given either when the boy kills an enemy in battle or dies in battle. Those who fail this rite of passage are punished either by execution or public shaming. Fathers and sons are expected to have an emotionally distant relationship, with any signs of affection between them being considered shameful.

Scholars Christina Niculescu and Yonit Nemtzeanu analysed Kazon culture to explore political correctness and themes of racial prejudice in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. They determined that the Kazon are characterized as primitive/inferior, savage, and criminal, and argue that the Kazon&#x27;s appearance and behavior were designed to elicit a negative response from the audience. They described the Kazon&#x27;s clothing as resembling that of guerrilla warriors, and their hair and faces as &quot;wild&quot; and &quot;threatening&quot;. Though the Kazon are not shown as having a standing army, they are defined as a militaristic society. Niculescu and Nemtzeanu noted that the Kazon dialogue is marked by its frequent use of violent language. According to Seska, Kazon medicine is rudimentary and &quot;primitive&quot;. Even though the Kazon are the only classified species that the Borg refuse to assimilate, Janeway included in her reports that they are a &quot;tricky and dangerous foe&quot;.

In &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, the Kazon&#x27;s military focus is heavily contrasted with the humanistic United Federation of Planets. Through the resources taken from the Trabe, the Kazon possess energy weapons, primarily phasers and tractor beams, and deflector shields. They are unaware of transporters and replicators until their first meeting with &quot;Voyager&quot;″s crew. The Kazon are primarily shown using one of two types of spacecraft: raider ships and carrier vessels. The raider ships are considered minor threats by &quot;Voyager&quot;″s crew, but the carrier ships are viewed as more dangerous. Even though the Kazon&#x27;s weapons are inferior to those on &quot;Voyager&quot;, the Starfleet crew&#x27;s inability to resupply leaves them vulnerable to attacks. The Kazon vessels are visually represented as &quot;dark, strictly functional&quot; and without &quot;any of the embellishments known from the bright, slick Federation ships&quot;. The ships are adorned with only the skulls and trophies of conquered enemies. In &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;, players can use the Kazon heavy raider and have access to its bridge. The MMORPG&#x27;s official website promotes the craft&#x27;s greatest strength as &quot;its maneuverability and versatility&quot;. The site also mentions that the Kazon have improved their technology since their encounter with &quot;Voyager&quot; by scavenging more advanced materials from other species.

== Background ==

=== Concept and creation ===
Prior to the announcement of a new &quot;Star Trek&quot; incarnation, &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; co-creators Rick Berman, Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor conceived the basic concepts and characters during secret developmental meetings. The Kazon were originally created as a part of the show&#x27;s basic premise of &quot;Voyager&quot;″s crew being stranded in the Delta Quadrant. Berman, Piller, and Taylor reasoned that the characters would be traveling through an area of space controlled by a new alien race, serving as the show&#x27;s primary antagonists, and created the Kazon to fill this role.

The Kazon were inspired by Los Angeles gangs, and were referenced in a &quot;shorthand &#x27;Crips&#x27; and &#x27;Bloods&#x27; fashion&quot;. The idea for the Kazon as warrior sects, as opposed to a unified race, was introduced by Taylor, who drafted them as &quot;three gangs, with constantly shifting relationships and allegiances. Just as we think we have sorted it out, the balance shifts again.&quot; While discussing the Kazon&#x27;s original inspiration, Taylor viewed them as a way &quot;to address the tenor of our times and what [...] was happening in our cities and recognizing a source of danger and social unrest&quot;. Piller further described the premise for the Kazon as rooted in gang violence and warfare by clarifying: &quot;Our intention was to create a sort of disorganized anarchy, them-against-them as much as them-against-us.&quot;

In a meeting dated August 17, 1993, Taylor wrote a story outline for the pilot episode &quot;Caretaker&quot; and established the Kazon (then identified as the Crips) as a &quot;gang which, in conflict with two other gangs, competes for territory in this region of space&quot;. Taylor&#x27;s notes suggest that the show&#x27;s co-creators considered having the Crips reach a truce with the main characters, which would anger another one of the gangs (then titled the Blood) and lead to them being the primary antagonists. This idea was later dropped at a meeting on September 10 of the same year. In the first draft of the script for &quot;Caretaker&quot;, Piller named the alien species the &quot;Gazon&quot; and wrote the following description of them:

During the summer of 1994, &quot;Gazon&quot; was changed to &quot;Kazon&quot;, as it was feared that the name sounded too much like Gaza. The producers suggested this change to avoid stories involving the alien race being interpreted as political commentary on the conflicts in the Palestinian territories. According to the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager Technical Manual&quot;, the Kazon were originally planned to be split into only two factions (the &quot;Kazon-Sera&quot; and the &quot;Kazon-Ogla&quot;).

=== Design and casting ===
The Kazon&#x27;s design was formulated around the beginning of June 1994. The series&#x27; make-up supervisor Michael Westmore was heavily involved in the creation of the look for the Kazon. While describing the species&#x27; facial features, Westmore said he constructed a skin protrusion along the nose and front of the face to simulate &quot;a soft cockscomb, a rooster comb&quot; rather than &quot;the dinosaur bone-type of ridges&quot;. He said that there were very small visual differences between Kazon males and females, with the distinguishing characteristic being women having a more delicate physicality than the men. According to Westmore, the prosthetic make-up for the forehead was structured in a shape reminiscent of the Devil, while the ridges on the nose were inspired by a vulture&#x27;s neck. The nose designs were modified throughout the first two seasons with the addition of a nose tip and spikes protruding from the nostrils. The Kazon&#x27;s design was the subject of fan criticism following the series premiere, with one fan commenting: &quot;They look like they&#x27;re all having a bad hair day.&quot; When Anthony De Longis first saw the headdress worn as a part of Culluh&#x27;s costume, he joked that: &quot;Culluh must be the leader because he has the biggest head of hair.&quot;

Westmore said that he faced several challenges involving the make-up and masks during the filming of &quot;Caretaker&quot;. Because of the large number of Kazon present in the first episode, he hired additional make-up artists and mold makers to assist with getting all the actors into costume. According to supervising producer David Livingston, the process of applying the Kazon make-up took multiple hours. Since a majority of the scenes involving the Kazon were filmed at the El Mirage Lake, Livingston and the filming crew were assigned to help the actors feel comfortable in the heavy make-up and prosthetics despite the high temperatures.

Piller originally envisioned only casting actors between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five to simulate the connection between the Kazon and contemporary street gangs. He said that he wanted the casting choices to convey the alien species as &quot;young, angry people who never lived old enough to have the kind of experience and perspective on the world that, say, the Klingons and Romulans might have&quot;. He wanted to emphasize that the Kazon were &quot;much more emotional, short fused, and therefore had fewer expectations&quot; through the actors&#x27; performances. The roles, however, were filled by actors outside this age range, with Piller explaining that the decision was reached on the grounds that the &quot;older actors gave more polished performances&quot;. He later regretted the choice of more mature actors, as he felt this conflicted with the writers&#x27; concept of the species, making them appear too much like Klingons. The Kazon also received comparisons to the Cardassians and Wood Elves by Uproxx&#x27;s Donna Dickens.

=== Filming and development ===
In the first season, the Kazon were introduced as one of three new alien species that could be used as recurring antagonists; the other two were the Vidiians and the Sikarians. The Kazon and Vidiians would be featured in later episodes, while the appearance of the Sikarians was restricted to the episode &quot;Prime Factors&quot;. Westmore found the Kazon to be the most demanding species to design for &quot;Voyager&quot; first season, though, overall, he found the make-up and prosthetic work for &quot;Voyager&quot; easier than that required for &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. He explained this by comparing the relatively small number of Kazon who appeared in episodes outside of the pilot to the numerous aliens featured throughout &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. The Kazon&#x27;s design was modified during the filming of the first season. For example, for the second episode in which the Kazon appeared—&quot;State of Flux&quot;—Westmore removed the ear prosthetics, which had been created originally by hair designer Josée Normand to look like pigs&#x27; ears. The pig-ear prosthetics proved to be too cumbersome and heavy for the actors and stunt doubles, and its material was changed to a more light-weight sponge.

&quot;Voyager&quot;″s writing team devoted a larger amount of screen time in the show&#x27;s second season to develop Kazon culture and society. Piller described the season as &quot;a deep investigation of [the Kazon] that will turn them, I think, into perhaps one of the top five adversarial alien races in &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s history&quot;. Piller devised the Kazon&#x27;s story arc in the second season from his experiences working on the 1995 science fiction Western television show &quot;Legend&quot;. Taylor was uncertain about the renewed focus on the Kazon, and questioned if they were compelling antagonists. She described them as entirely Piller&#x27;s idea.

Executive story editor Kenneth Biller wrote a paper detailing the Kazon&#x27;s history and societal behavior, as well as their adversarial relationship with the Trabe. Biller compiled all of his ideas on paper to help the various writers create a cohesive narrative for the Kazon across the individual episodes. Developed for one of his episodes—&quot;Initiations&quot;—the notes were also used by Taylor for the creation of &quot;Alliances&quot;. Biller pointed to the character of Seska as a key narrative device for further exploring the alien species. For Biller, Seska &quot;allowed us to go behind the scenes with the Kazon&quot; and &quot;helped to define the Kazon for us&quot;. Nonetheless, Hackett interpreted Seska as having little loyalty to the Kazon, saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t think she gives a hoot about [them].&quot;

When discussing his hopes for fan reaction to the second season&#x27;s emphasis on the Kazon, Piller said: &quot;I&#x27;ll be curious to know what the audience&#x27;s perception is, if our investing in the Kazon this season worked.&quot; In response to fans&#x27; concerns that &quot;Voyager&quot; did not incorporate as many science fiction elements as previous &quot;Star Trek&quot; installments, he believed that the growing focus on the Kazon would serve as the solution. Piller believed the alien species accentuated the show&#x27;s futuristic storylines, explaining: &quot;There are a lot of people who don&#x27;t consider a lot [of the season&#x27;s episodes to be] science fiction.&quot; He followed this up by saying: &quot;But certainly you can make a case that facing the Kazon in battle is futurist storytelling.&quot; Taylor viewed the second season as focused on &quot;character-driven, introspective&quot; stories, with a majority of the &quot;action-adventure&quot; aspects being conducted through the appearances of the Kazon.

=== Abandonment ===
Following the end of the second season, Taylor decided to remove the Kazon as the series&#x27; primary antagonists, having found the effort to develop the alien species to be unsuccessful. She felt that they never grew into a compelling adversary, despite their appearances in multiple episodes. Taylor argued that the Kazon limited the potential of the series, saying: &quot;It created the curious implication that we are standing still in space, when our franchise is that we are going at incredible speeds toward the Alpha Quadrant – we keep running into the same people over and over again! It was just an oddity, and I don&#x27;t think the Kazon have served us well.&quot; While discussing their role in the future episodes, she explained that it was her &quot;intention to leave them behind and to find new and I hope more interesting aliens&quot;.

Even though Piller understood Taylor&#x27;s disappointment with the Kazon, he felt that &quot;it was important and valuable to create this adversary&quot;. Berman agreed with Taylor&#x27;s assessment of the Kazon and noted that they would be removed in the beginning of the third season. He also admitted that the writers made several mistakes and introduced inconsistencies while developing the Kazon. Believing that the large amount of space under the Kazon&#x27;s control was implausible, he argued that the number of times &quot;Voyager&quot; encountered the alien species would make their territory bigger than the United Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire. Producer Brannon Braga supported the Kazon&#x27;s removal, criticizing the species as &quot;half-baked Klingons&quot; and their constant inclusion in episodes as making the series have &quot;the feeling that we&#x27;re traveling in a big circle&quot;.

Despite the decision to eliminate the Kazon from future episodes, the writing team was uncertain if the season two finale and season three premiere would focus on them. Piller said that it was suggested that the episodes could serve as an introduction to a new alien species, but he supported the possibility that they act as a farewell to the Kazon storylines. He explained his decision by saying he &quot;felt we had built up this arc with them and it was a natural conclusion&quot;. The Kazon were replaced by storylines focusing on the Vidiians, the Borg, and the Hirogen.

== Response ==
=== Cast response ===
&quot;Voyager&quot;″s cast members had a negative response to the continued inclusion of the Kazon in the series and felt that their removal was the best course of action. Tim Russ commented that the frequent incorporation of the species would strain the credibility of the storylines as the crew would have to eventually leave Kazon-controlled space on their journey home. He also believed that the Kazon were failures as antagonists, perceiving them to be insufficiently imposing for the main characters and fans to take them seriously. Ethan Phillips agreed with Russ, suggesting that the Kazon&#x27;s presence should be reduced. Robert Picardo joked that the only interesting aspect of the species was their hairstyle, while Robert Beltran pointed to their lack of intelligence as the main factor preventing them from becoming strong villains. Kate Mulgrew suggested that the show incorporate a new and stronger antagonist, saying: &quot;We need [...] to encounter enemies of such ferocity, enemies who in fact are quite lethal and frightening. Enemies that you would watch and say, &#x27;Oh, boy, how are they going to get out of this one?&#x27; I don&#x27;t think the Kazon hit the bill.&quot; Mulgrew felt the crew&#x27;s mission to get home was a more compelling storyline than those related to the Kazon, whom she criticized as &quot;great big stupid giants&quot;.

=== Critical reception ===
The Kazon have received a negative response from television critics. In his 2005 book &quot;An Analytical Guide to Television&#x27;s Battlestar Galactica&quot;, literary critic John Kenneth Muir argued that the events of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; lost their urgency with the basing of the second season in Kazon space. He negatively compared &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; to science fiction television series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, writing that &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; could learn from how &quot;the &quot;Galactica&quot; must go on, ever forward, to their destination&quot;. The alien species was described as &quot;stereotypical macho space warriors&quot; by writer K. Stoddard Hayes, who was critical of the lack of developed Kazon characters. He explained this up by saying: &quot;No memorable Kazon characters emerge from two seasons of episodes featuring their different factions.&quot;

Critics have also doubted the effectiveness of Kazon as villains. Britt found the Kazon to be among &quot;the silliest, worst antagonists in Trek&#x27;s history&quot;. Juliette Harrison of the website &quot;Den of Geek!&quot; wrote that the writers were too focused on the Kazon and Seska storylines. Harrison called them &quot;sub-standard Klingon substitutes&quot; and praised the series&#x27; decision to replace them with the Borg. The Kazon, along with Seska, were placed at number two on a list by Io9&#x27;s Charlie Jane Anders profiling the 10 least threatening &quot;Star Trek&quot; villains. Anders explained that the Kazon were more frequently represented as irritating pests than a major obstacle to &quot;Voyager&quot;″s journey home. Charles Evans of &quot;FanSided&quot; questioned the Kazon&#x27;s desperation for water, since they could use their warp technology to gather it from other planets. Even though Evans described the Kazon as starting from a good premise, he did not find them to live up to their label as &quot;the most powerful race in their area of the Delta Quadrant&quot;.

&quot;TrekToday&quot; Michelle Erica Green provided extensive and primarily negative commentary on the Kazon story arc in the first two seasons while re-watching the series. The Kazon were negatively compared to the Klingons by Green, who described the Vidiians as a more suitable and compelling candidate to serve as the primary antagonists for the first two seasons. Green questioned Janeway&#x27;s resolve to never share &quot;Voyager&quot;″s technology with the Kazon, writing that the species was characterized as &quot;a spacefaring culture with warp drive&quot; so the crew would not be &quot;interfering with a primitive civilization&quot;. She argued that the Kazon&#x27;s attempts to steal a replicator and a transporter rather than offensive weapons lessened their impact as a threatening presence, suggesting that the possibility of relations with the Kazon did not &quot;seem much more heinous than dealing with the Klingons or Ferengi, who oppress women and minorities within their borders&quot;.

Despite negative critical reception of the Kazon, the scene in which they commandeer &quot;Voyager&quot; was praised by television commentators. Marc Buxton, of &quot;Den of Geek!&quot;, included the Kazon on his list of the 50 best alien life forms in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, for their &quot;advanced technology and a back-stabbing bloodthirst&quot; and success in trapping the &quot;Voyager&quot; crew on a hostile planet. Similarly, Tor.com&#x27;s Ryan Britt ranked the moment when the Kazon captured the ship as one of the seven most shocking instances in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

=== Racial and political analysis ===
The representation of the Kazon as antagonists has been criticized by genre commentators and academics as an example of racism in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. Christina Niculescu and Yonit Nemtzeanu were critical of the dark-skinned Kazon being treated as more aggressive than the more diplomatic, fair-skinned alien species. They determined that the representation of the Kazon was implicitly racist, writing that the species was shown as embodying negative stereotypes. Niculescu and Nemtzeanu followed this up by saying that the Kazon were written only to be &quot;criminals and savages&quot; and seen as &quot;primitive&quot;. In his 2016 &quot;The Politics of Star Trek&quot;, the political scientist George A. Gonzalez agreed the skin tone and hair style designed for the Kazon as carrying explicit racial connotations, and felt that it was made more apparent during their conflict with the lighter-skinned Ocampa. Zach of Bitch Media placed the Kazon as one example of &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s uneven treatment of race. He compared the Kazon to the Klingons and Ferengi, writing that &quot;aliens-of-color [are] used as proxies to represent the worst aspects of human behavior&quot;.

The Kazon have been interpreted as a sociopolitical commentary on developing countries. George A. Gonzalez presented the Kazon as a pessimistic feature of the Delta Quadrant, which he read as a metaphor for the developing world. Emphasizing the Kazon&#x27;s mistreatment of the Ocampa, plans to steal from &quot;Voyager&quot;″s more developed technology, and inability to form lasting alliances, Gonzalez describes the series as interpreting race relations in developing countries as &quot;inherently contentious and inevitably destabilizing&quot;. He concluded by saying that the Kazon storylines were in line with &quot;neoconservative biases/reasoning&quot;. For a 2015 retrospective review of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, MoviePilot&#x27;s David Trudel wrote that he was disappointed in the breakdown of the alliance between the Kazon and the Trabe in the episode &quot;Alliances&quot;. He felt that the series should have featured the formation of a new Federation starting with these two alien species. Some critics viewed the episode as &quot;the moment Trek died intellectually&quot;, though Trudel disagreed with this assessment as &quot;fairly dramatic&quot;. In 1996, &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Jon Pareles offered a less critical assessment of &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s development of alien species, describing them as enacting &quot;exaggerated human tendencies&quot;. Pareles identified the Kazon&#x27;s rebellion against their previous captors in particular as comparable to the political situations in Somalia or Rwanda at the time of his writing.

<doc id="158725" wikidata="Q1481366" url="?curid=158725" title="M11 motorway">
<text>The M11 is a motorway that runs north from the North Circular Road (A406) in South Woodford to the A14, northwest of Cambridge, England. Originally proposed as a trunk road as early as 1915, various plans were considered throughout the 1960s, with final construction being undertaken between 1975 and 1980. The motorway was opened in stages, with the first stage between junctions 7 and 8 opening in June 1975, and the completed motorway becoming fully operational in February 1980. Running from Woodford to Girton, the motorway provides direct access to Harlow, Cambridge and since 2002, greatly improved access to London Stansted Airport.

==Route==
The M11 starts in South Woodford in northeast London, just north of Redbridge Roundabout, crosses the North Circular (A406) at junction 4, it then heads NNE, passing east of Loughton and Theydon Bois as well as Epping Forest, meeting the M25 motorway at junction 6, and then veering approximately north, passing to the east of Harlow. The M11 gives access to Bishop&#x27;s Stortford and the motorway&#x27;s only service station via junction 8. This is followed immediately by the recently constructed junction 8A, which provides a free-flow link to the improved A120 that links to Stansted Airport. The M11 then traverses part of Cambridgeshire, meeting a spur for the A11 at junction 9, Stump Cross, and then finally ends at junction 14, the Girton Interchange, with the road continuing through the junction and becoming the A14, which continues the route on to Huntingdon and the north.

The motorway starts with two lanes southbound and three northbound; then, north of Woodford Bridge, both directions have three lanes, a layout that continues up to junction 8A, except for a brief two-lane section at junction 6, beneath the M25. From junction 8 the motorway has two lanes in both directions all the way to junction 14 where the motorway terminates. The motorway is illuminated at the southern terminus near junction 4, at junction 6 (the M25 interchange), and also at the approach to junction 8/8A (Stansted Airport/Bishop&#x27;s Stortford), and then at the northern terminus at junction 14, for the A14. All four of these sections use modern high-pressure sodium (SON) lighting. The older, yellow, low-pressure sodium (SOX) lighting originally used at junctions 4 and 6 was replaced in 2005. The M11 junctions 1, 2 and 3 do not exist; see the History section below for explanation.

==History==
===Planning===
Plans for an &#x27;Eastern Avenue&#x27; in London had been proposed as early as 1915, and the Eastern Avenue Extension was causing local concern in Leyton and Hackney during the late 1950s and early 1960s. It was opposed by a number of groups, including the Hackney Society and local residents as represented by their member of parliament in 1962.

By 1966, the Ministry of Transport was planning a longer road and for it to be partly motorway. The first version had a mid-south section, to follow a River Lea route, starting at Angel southwest of Dalston, heading northeast then north, taking land by the river in Walthamstow, Chingford and Waltham Cross, and meeting the built road alignment of today north of Harlow. The road from South Woodford to Islington would have been designated as the M12. The route was in planning stages with several options, with differences between the plans preferred by the Greater London Council and the Ministry of Transport – a different version called for this &#x27;Eastern Avenue&#x27; to run more east–west alongside the Regent&#x27;s Canal and the north side of Victoria Park, Hackney Wick, where it would have connected to the North Cross and East Cross Routes at the northeast corner of an inner ringway identified by the London Ringways plan.

There were three proposed routes from the inner to outer ringway (North Circular) at the base of the current M11 and it is unclear which one was favoured.

Under one scheme, south of South Woodford a connection would have been made with the western end of a proposed &quot;M12&quot; towards Colchester. These proposals also made the case for an M15 motorway for the Ringway 2, a major upgrade of the North Circular Road to typical motorway standard. When the southern end of the current M11 ended here, space was provided between the two carriageways to enable an offshoot of &#x27;the M12&#x27; to merge from the southwest: junctions 1, 2 and 3 were reserved for this additional inner London section. Part of the unbuilt route of a southern section of the M11 is seen from a sliproad from the North Circular to the M11 which travels over a bridge over bare land.

It was announced in March 1975 that from junction 8 (Bishops Stortford/Stansted exit) to the northern terminus, (thus including the Cambridge western bypass) would not be &quot;constructed to M1 standard&quot;. This was another way of stating that, following a change in government policy, this section would comprise two rather than three lanes in each direction.

===Additions===
The M11 Link Road, or more formally &#x27;A12 Hackney to M11 link road&#x27; (in fact leading to the North Circular) was constructed during the 1990s from Hackney Wick by Victoria Park to the Redbridge Roundabout—the interchange with the North Circular—and was opened in 1999. The route of this road, which followed a similar route to one of the initial proposals resulted in the protracted M11 link road protest between 1993 and 1995, one of a spate of major UK road protests under the Major ministry.

A new junction 7a was opened on 10 June 2022. The stated aims for this development are:
* Create a new east–west link, which will move traffic smoothly out of Harlow on to the M11
* Reduce congestion on the north–south links through Harlow and towards junction 7
* Create new public transport and sustainable travel opportunities 
* Provide new opportunities for housing and business developments.

===Abortive/suspended proposals===
====Junction 5====
An official plan to add north-facing connections at junction 5 in Debden, Loughton was abandoned in 1998.

====Junctions 6 to 8====

The Highways Agency tabled proposals to upgrade the M11, between junction 6 and 8, from three lanes plus hard shoulder to four each way with an estimated cost of £698 million given in 2007.
A number of public consultations were made throughout 2007 and although efforts were made to limit environmental damage the scheme would cause disruption and loss of habitat to three designated ecological areas and a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) at Gernon Bushes. Maps of the proposal and previously discounted options were published by the Highways Agency. Plans were abandoned in March 2009 when the Secretary of State for Transport announced that no changes would be made to this section of motorway before 2021.

===Construction===
The motorway was opened in stages. The stretch between junctions 7 and 8 opened in 1975, and that between junctions 4 and 7 in 1977. The stretch from junctions 8 to 9 opened in 1979; that between junctions 9 and 14 in 1980; and the full length becoming fully operational in February 1980.

Budgets were tight during the 1970s when the road was built, so the road surface was of unsurfaced concrete between junction 14 and a point approximately to the south of junction 7. South of this stretch, where the road runs on soft ground close to the River Roding, concrete was considered unsuitable owing to the looseness of the subsoil and the consequent risk of random cracking, so the surface here was of tarmac from the start.

==Services==
The motorway&#x27;s first, and only, service station, Birchanger Green Services at junction 8, opened in 1996. The services also serve the A120, a major high-speed dual-carriageway road, running from junction 8A to the eastern fringe of Braintree, it continues on to Colchester as a busy single-carriageway road.

There had been plans for a service station on the motorway as long ago as 1969, named Chigwell, between that village and Loughton, which led to the construction of spur roads and a restricted lorry park; during the London Olympics 2012 these were used as a works unit. The plans for a service station at this site were officially dropped in 1980.

==Operation==
From the late 1990s onward, the concrete surface that had greatly degraded was progressively replaced with standard layers of tarmac, and drainage improvements were implemented at the same time. This work was completed in June 2008.

Junction 8A for the A120 road and Stansted Airport opened in December 2002.

==Proposed developments==
By way of complementary plans for proposed expansion of Stansted Airport, the Highways Agency collaborated with BAA on improvements to transport access to the airport including two proposals for the M11, one of which has been deemed unnecessary, junctions 6–8, see above and the other of which, including spur road and junction additions may be approved by the government if Stansted expansion takes place.

===M11 and A120 interchange – Stansted generation 2 airport access===

A joint scheme involving works on junctions on the M11 and A120. This scheme was part of an aborted plan to add a second runway to Stansted Airport. It proposed changes to junction 8 of the M11 with the creation of junction 8B, linked to and situated just north of junction 8/8A and the creation of a new junction on the A120, to provide additional rapid access to the expanded airport. The scheme was given an estimated cost of £131million in May 2008. 

A number of public consultations and exhibitions were held throughout 2007. Findings from these showed that although the public had several concerns regarding environmental impact 57% of attendees agreed the scheme would be necessary if the Stansted Airport expansion proceeded. Following the public consultation, the preferred route was published on 5 March 2008 and the draft orders on 27 March 2008. A pre-public inquiry meeting took place on 10 November 2008, with a public inquiry due in April 2009. However, this was delayed until further notice following BAA&#x27;s appeal against the March 2009 ruling of the Competition Commission and the proposal lapsed when the application for a second runway was withdrawn by BAA in 2010.

==Incidents==

===Plane crash===
On 2 June 2002, a brake failure on an Aero L-39 Albatross landing at the Imperial War Museum Duxford caused the plane to run off the end of the runway and down an embankment onto the southbound carriageway of the motorway. The trainee pilot was killed when he ejected at ground level, but the instructor survived the accident and no vehicles on the motorway were involved. The main runway at Duxford had been shortened in 1977 from to when the motorway was built. More recently, even though Duxford already met all licensing requirements, the declared length was reduced to to increase safety further than existing measures.

===Snow storm===
In January 2003, thousands of motorists became stranded on &quot;White Friday&quot; for up to 20hours between junctions 7 and 9 during a snowstorm.

<text>Vivian Stanshall (born Victor Anthony Stanshall; 21 March 1943 – 5 March 1995) was an English singer-songwriter, musician, author, poet and wit, best known for his work with the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, for his exploration of the British upper classes in &quot;Sir Henry at Rawlinson End&quot; (as a radio series for John Peel, as an audio recording, as a book and as a film), and for acting as Master of Ceremonies on Mike Oldfield&#x27;s album &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Stanshall was born on 21 March 1943 at the Radcliffe Maternity Home Shillingford, Oxfordshire, son of Victor George Stanshall (1909–1990; born Vivian), at the time of his son&#x27;s birth an RAF corporal, later a company secretary, then company director (FCIS), and Eileen Monica Prudence (née Wadeson). He was christened Victor Anthony. He lived with his mother while his father served in the RAF during the Second World War. Stanshall described this early period as the happiest time of his childhood.

When the war ended his father returned, but the young Victor found him difficult and comparatively stern after having been alone with his mother. His father made him speak with a &quot;plummy&quot; accent for which he later became known. The family moved to the father&#x27;s hometown of Walthamstow, Essex, where Stanshall&#x27;s younger brother Mark was born in 1949. With six years between them, the brothers were never close. 

When he was 10, the Stanshall family moved to the Essex coastal town of Leigh-on-Sea. He attended Southend High School for Boys until 1959. Stanshall then studied at Walthamstow College of Art, where he met fellow students Ian Dury and Peter Greenaway.

As a young man, Stanshall (known as Vic) earned money doing various odd jobs at the Kursaal fun fair in nearby Southend-on-Sea. These included working as a bingo caller and spending the winter painting the fairground attractions. To set aside enough money to get through art school (his father having refused to fund this), Stanshall spent a year in the Merchant Navy. He said he was a very bad waiter, but became a great teller of tall tales.

Stanshall enrolled at the Central School of Art and Design in London. He joined fellow students in forming a band (including Rodney Slater, Roger Ruskin Spear and Neil Innes, who was studying art at Goldsmiths College). Innes said of their first meeting: &quot;We first met in a big Irish pub in South London, the New Cross Arms ... he was quite plump in those days, and he was wearing Billy Bunter check trousers, a Victorian frock coat, black coat tails, horrible little oval, violet-tinted pince-nez glasses, he had a euphonium under his arm, and large rubber false ears. And I thought, well, this is an interesting character.&quot; At about this time, Stanshall changed his first name to &#x27;Vivian&#x27;, the name his father had abandoned. This was not made his legal name until 1977. Those who knew him from his student days continued to call him &#x27;Vic&#x27;. Later friends and collaborators knew him as &#x27;Viv&#x27;.

== Bonzo years ==
The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band were named after a word game that Stanshall played with co-founder Slater, in which they cut up sentences and juxtaposed fragments to form new ones. &#x27;Bonzo Dog/Dada&#x27; was one result which they liked. The band initially performed under this name, but grew tired of explaining what Dada meant; hence they changed it to the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, &#x27;doo-dah&#x27; being a quaint expression that both Slater&#x27;s mother and Stanshall himself used to describe everyday objects. Later this name was shortened to The Bonzo Dog Band, or just The Bonzos.

Much of the band&#x27;s original repertoire was based on comedic re-workings of songs from the 1920s and 1930s, found on 78 records, bought for pennies from local flea markets.

For a while the band operated semi-professionally, playing local pubs and the college circuit. After acquiring a manager, they went full-time and were booked on the working men&#x27;s club circuit, mainly in the north of England. The band dominated their lives, as they frequently travelled to low-paying gigs in an old van crammed with any number of musical instruments, an assortment of props, and prop robots. In 1967, they appeared in the Beatles&#x27; television film &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, in which they played Stanshall&#x27;s &quot;Death Cab for Cutie&quot; during the strip club scene. The appearance led to a spot as the house band on &quot;Do Not Adjust Your Set&quot;, a weekly children&#x27;s television revue series that was also notable for early appearances by Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin, who later became half of Monty Python.

According to their manager/agent Gerry Bron, after a perhaps ill-advised agreement that the band should be left to their own artistic devices, Stanshall was allowed several weeks in a hired rehearsal space to write songs for the new Bonzo Dog Band album. When Bron arrived at the location to check the progress of these endeavours, he found that Stanshall had not written anything at all and had instead built a variety of hutches for his pet rabbits. Bron mentioned in a television documentary that this occurred in May 1968 in a hall in Acton, west London; the actual location is Askew Road Church Hall, at the start of Bassein Park Road in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush. The date would suggest that these were rehearsals for the album &quot;The Doughnut in Granny&#x27;s Greenhouse&quot;. During recordings for the album proper at Morgan Studios, Stanshall, wearing just a rabbit&#x27;s head and underpants, interviewed members of the public in Willesden High Road. On the album track &quot;We Are Normal&quot;, one interviewee can be heard to remark, &#x27;He&#x27;s got a head on him like a rabbit.&#x27;

Later in 1968, the Bonzos scored a surprise top-ten hit with &quot;I&#x27;m the Urban Spaceman&quot; co-produced by Paul McCartney and Gus Dudgeon under the alias &#x27;Apollo C. Vermouth&#x27;. Meanwhile the band toured incessantly and recorded a multitude of radio sessions for the BBC, alongside several albums. They also embarked upon two poorly organised but well-received tours of the United States. (Neil Innes remembers that the band were stopped by a local sheriff and asked if they were carrying any firearms or drugs. When they denied both, the officer asked how they were going to defend themselves. Stanshall piped up from the back of the minibus, &quot;With good manners!&quot;) It was during the particularly disastrously organised second tour that the Bonzos decided to break up, partly because of Stanshall&#x27;s growing stage fright – combined with his increasing use of valium to help combat this – but also because of anger with their management, after Spear&#x27;s wife suffered a miscarriage while he was away, and no-one informed him. The band subsequently decided to split whilst they were still friends. They played their last show in March 1970, at Loughborough University.

==After the Bonzos==
Stanshall formed a number of short-lived groups during 1970 alone, including biG GRunt (formed while the Bonzos were still on their farewell tour, and including fellow Bonzos Roger Ruskin Spear and Dennis Cowan, and with Anthony &#x27;Bubs&#x27; White on guitar), The Sean Head Showband (again featuring Cowan and White), Gargantuan Chums, and the slightly longer-lived Bonzo Dog Freaks, with Innes and the ever-faithful Cowan and White (this conglomerate was also known simply as &#x27;Freaks&#x27;). Early that year, biG GRunt recorded a well-received session for BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel, and shortly afterwards made a memorable appearance on BBC television. Despite this promising start, biG GRunt dissolved during their first UK tour when Stanshall became incapacitated by the onset of an anxiety disorder that caused a nervous breakdown and would continue to plague him for the rest of his life.

However, he soon recovered sufficiently to record and release, on the Liberty label, his first solo single &quot;Labio-Dental Fricative/Paper Round&quot;, credited to Vivian Stanshall and The Sean Head Showband (an oblique reference to Stanshall having shaved off all of his hair during his breakdown), and featuring Eric Clapton on guitar. Later in the year, his single version of Terry Stafford&#x27;s song &quot;Suspicion&quot;, credited to Vivian Stanshall and Gargantuan Chums and featuring Keith Moon and John Entwistle of the Who, was released. Featured on the B-side was &quot;Blind Date&quot;, the only officially released track by biG GRunt. (However, all of Stanshall&#x27;s backing bands of 1970 featured the same core personnel, so it could be argued that they were essentially the same band, masquerading under a variety of names.)

In early 1971, Stanshall reunited again with Innes, Cowan and White as &#x27;Freaks&#x27; to tour new material. In order to promote ticket sales, they were more often than not billed as &#x27;Bonzo Dog Freaks&#x27;. With Keith Moon guesting on drums, Freaks quickly recorded a BBC radio session for John Peel that featured solo numbers by Stanshall and Innes alongside tracks from &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Up And Be Friendly&quot;, the Bonzos&#x27; yet-to-be recorded contractual obligation/reunion album of 1972. The session is also notable for marking the first appearance in any medium of an episode of Stanshall&#x27;s magnum opus, Rawlinson End. Stanshall also found time during this period to be a founder member of the performance/poetry/music group Grimms, alongside Innes, The Scaffold and associated poets and musicians. Although Stanshall left Grimms before they made any recordings, he did continue to perform live with them on occasion.

Throughout this period, still suffering badly with anxiety and now drinking heavily to self-medicate, Stanshall nonetheless continued to write, record and tour with Freaks and Grimms (and briefly as guest touring frontman for The Temperance Seven in 1972). He was also a regular guest, broadcaster and presenter on numerous series on BBC radio.

Despite his ongoing personal difficulties, Stanshall&#x27;s humorous exploits continued unabated. His adventures with long-time drinking buddy Keith Moon (who would become Stanshall&#x27;s regular partner in crime for much of the 1970s after producing and appearing on Stanshall&#x27;s single &quot;Suspicion&quot;) were legendary. In one quite possibly apocryphal example, Stanshall visited a tailor&#x27;s shop where he admired a pair of trousers on display. Moon then arrived, posing as another customer, and admired the same trousers, demanding to buy them. When Stanshall protested, the two men fought and split the trousers in two, so that they ended up with one leg each; the tailor, understandably, became furious. Then, a one-legged actor – hired by Stanshall and Moon – arrived, saw the split trousers, and proclaimed: &quot;Ah! Just what I was looking for! I&#x27;ll buy them!&quot;

Thanks to his association with John Peel, in 1971 Stanshall was asked to fill in for the disc jockey while he was on a month&#x27;s holiday. The resulting short series, titled &quot;Vivian Stanshall&#x27;s Radio Flashes&quot;, was recorded under the supervision of Peel&#x27;s regular producer John Walters and broadcast on BBC Radio One on Saturday afternoons during August 1971. The series of four two-hour programmes were a mix of music and specially written and recorded comedic sketches. Of the original four episodes, only episodes 2, 3 and 4 remain in the BBC archives; these were re-broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra in 2014 and again in 2016. All four episodes and a Christmas 1971 compilation special have also circulated among collectors as low-quality, edited off-air recordings since the 1970s. Contributors to the sketches in &quot;Radio Flashes&quot; included Moon, Traffic&#x27;s Jim Capaldi and actress Chris Bowler. The sketches included a four-part serial adventure titled &quot;Breath From The Pit&quot;, featuring the surreal exploits of a Dick Barton or Bulldog Drummond-style gentleman adventurer, Colonel Knutt (played by Stanshall) and his working-class sidekick, the &#x27;likeable cheeky cockney, Lemmy&#x27;. This character was a thinly-veiled parody of the character of the same name from Charles Chilton&#x27;s &quot;Journey into Space&quot;, with Moon playing the role of Lemmy.

==&quot;Rawlinson End&quot;==
Stanshall had developed what many consider to be his seminal work, &quot;Rawlinson End&quot;, as a spoken word performance piece during the first few years of the 1970s, recording an early version as part of The Bonzo Dog Band&#x27;s reunion project &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Up And Be Friendly&quot;. Beginning in 1975, he expanded upon the concept as an episodic surrealist radio serial for BBC Radio 1&#x27;s John Peel slot, elaborating further upon the weird and wonderful adventures of the inebriated and blimpish Sir Henry Rawlinson, his wife, the distanced and ethereal Florrie, his &quot;unusual&quot; brother Hubert, loyal manservant Old Scrotum &#x27;the wrinkled retainer&#x27;, the rambling and unhygienic cook Mrs E.; and many other inhabitants of the crumbling Rawlinson End and its environs. Stanshall had been playing around with the Rawlinson characters for some time, and they were first referred to on the Bonzos&#x27; 1967 number, &quot;The Intro and the Outro&quot;: &#x27;Great to hear the Rawlinsons on trombone.&#x27;

In 1978, Stanshall released an album, &quot;Sir Henry at Rawlinson End&quot;, that reworked some material from the Peel sessions. This in turn was adapted into a film version in 1980, which was produced in a sepia-tinted black-and-white. It starred Trevor Howard as Sir Henry, and Stanshall as Hubert. Some of the film&#x27;s music was provided in collaboration with Stanshall&#x27;s friend Steve Winwood. A book of the same title – by Stanshall, illustrated with stills from the film – was published by Eel Pie Publishing in 1980. Nominally a film novelisation, it was distilled from the various versions and included considerable material that did not make it to the film. A projected second book, &quot;The Eating at Rawlinson End&quot;, was never completed.

A second Rawlinson album, &quot;Sir Henry at N&#x27;didi’s Kraal&quot; (1984), recounts Sir Henry&#x27;s disastrous African expedition, omitting the rest of the Rawlinson clan. At the time, Stanshall was living on &quot;The Searchlight&quot;, a houseboat that he had bought from Denny Laine and kept moored near Shepperton on the River Thames. He lived on &quot;The Searchlight&quot; from 1977 to 1983, and recorded and produced the second &#x27;Sir Henry&#x27; album on it during a period of debilitating physical illness. The album was disowned by Stanshall after its release, as he said it was both unfinished and unsatisfactory, and that the record label had rush-released it without his permission in an attempt to profit from his potentially imminent demise.

However, the noticeably superior BBC radio broadcasts continued sporadically until late 1991. In the same year, a temporarily rejuvenated Stanshall embarked upon a nationwide concert tour, titled &#x27;Rawlinson Dog Ends&#x27;, with support from former Bonzos and centred around a performance of new Rawlinson End material.

&#x27;Sir Henry&#x27; was last seen in a television commercial for Ruddles Real Ale (c. 1994), where he was portrayed by a cross-dressing Dawn French, presiding over a family banquet at a long table; shortly afterwards, Stanshall himself reprised the role of Hubert, reciting a poem loosely based on Edward Lear&#x27;s &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot;.

During this same period, Stanshall embarked upon the recording of a proposed new Rawlinson End album, but this activity was curtailed in its early stages by its creator&#x27;s untimely death in March 1995. After this, BBC Radio 4 retrieved some of the original Peel show recordings from the vaults for late-night repeat during Christmas 1996.

==1970s==
Stanshall regularly performed live with Grimms, as well as occasionally working with The Alberts and The Temperance Seven during the first few years of the decade. He was also a frequent contributor to BBC radio at this time, appearing weekly on &quot;Start The Week&quot; and &quot;Jack de Manio Precisely&quot;, and also on the BBC television satire series &quot;Up Sunday&quot;.

In 1973, Stanshall recorded tracks for the soundtrack album of the movie &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; backed by Moon, Ronnie Wood, Graham Bond and Jack Bruce, and collaborated on numerous musical projects, making a memorable appearance as the Master of Ceremonies on Mike Oldfield&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;. (He reprised the role for &quot;Tubular Bells II&quot; in 1992, but the final release featured Alan Rickman instead.) Stanshall made guest appearances on a number of other artists&#x27; recordings including John Entwistle&#x27;s &quot;Smash Your Head Against The Wall&quot; in 1971, Mike Hart&#x27;s &quot;Basher, Chalky, Pongo and Me&quot; in 1972, Pete Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Not Forgotten Association&quot; in 1973, and Robert Calvert&#x27;s 1974 concept album &quot;Captain Lockheed and the Starfighters&quot;.

In early 1974, Stanshall wrote, arranged, and quickly recorded his first solo album, &quot;Men Opening Umbrellas Ahead&quot;. A rather more serious work than many would have expected, its darkly comic lyrics detailed Stanshall&#x27;s alcoholism and troubled emotional state, laced with surreal poetic imagery and literary reference. Other lyrics included implicit references to other musicians and the music business, and a rather more explicit satire of the author&#x27;s relationship with his own penis. Musically, while certain tracks display Stanshall&#x27;s usual keen sense of rock and roll parody, most of the album has a &#x27;tribal&#x27; or &#x27;fusion&#x27; flavour. Prominently featuring the Nigerian musician Gasper Lawal and with many tracks infused with richly textured African percussion and chorus vocal stylings, the album (and its contemporary single &quot;Lakonga&quot;) can justifiably lay claim to being an early, unheralded example of a crossover between world music and rock music. Stanshall&#x27;s long-standing friends and colleagues Innes, White, Traffic&#x27;s Steve Winwood, Jim Capaldi, Ric Grech and Rebop Kwaku Baah, Doris Troy and Madeline Bell also made notable guest appearances. Deleted after its first pressing and out of print for many years, the album was finally re-released on CD in 2012.

The BBC documentary &quot;One Man&#x27;s Week&quot;, broadcast on 9 April 1975, documented a week in Stanshall&#x27;s life and included footage of him at The Manor recording studio during the sessions for &quot;Men Opening Umbrellas Ahead&quot;, where he played with White, Lawal, Mongezi Feza, and Derek (or Deryk) Quinn.

In 1975, Stanshall provided the narration for &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;, produced by Robin Lumley and Jack Lancaster and featuring, among others, Gary Moore, Manfred Mann, Phil Collins, Bill Bruford, Stéphane Grappelli, Alvin Lee, Cozy Powell, Brian Eno and Jon Hiseman. 1976 saw the release of his single &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, where the old Cliff Richard standard was delivered in the style of Boris Karloff.

In 1977, Stanshall and his companion, Pamela &#x27;Ki&#x27; Longfellow, moved into a houseboat, &quot;The Searchlight&quot;, moored on the Thames between Chertsey and Shepperton. During this period, Stanshall compiled and re-recorded material from his popular BBC Radio 1 broadcasts for Peel, which was released as &quot;Sir Henry at Rawlinson End&quot; in 1978. He also wrote the script for the film adaptation of the same name, later produced for Tony Stratton Smith&#x27;s Charisma Records company in 1980.

==1980s==
Following &#x27;Sir Henry&#x27;, Stanshall wrote the songs for his third album &quot;Teddy Boys Don&#x27;t Knit&quot; (1981), which included three songs about his family, and contributed a lyric to Winwood&#x27;s &quot;Arc of a Diver.&quot; He and Longfellow married in 1980, and together they wrote some of the songs they later used for a musical comedy, &quot;Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera&quot;.

In 1982, Stanshall provided a spoken word segment on &quot;Lovely Money&quot;, a single by The Damned.

After &quot;The Searchlight&quot; eventually sank, the Stanshalls lived and worked on &quot;The Thekla&quot;, a Baltic Trader, which Ki sailed 732 nautical miles (1,356 km) from Sunderland to be moored in the Bristol Docks. Ki had bought the vessel and converted her into a floating theatre called &#x27;The Old Profanity Showboat&#x27;. Stanshall joined her on it in 1983, when they opened the doors of the theatre. By this time, he was already suffering from alcohol and drug abuse, having become addicted to Valium while trying to control his anxiety.

In December 1985, The Old Profanity Showboat produced the debut of their work &quot;Stinkfoot, A Comic Opera&quot;. Stanshall wrote 27 original songs for the opera, sharing book and lyric writing with his wife. It has proved popular over the years, and was revived in London some years later, with Peter Moss as musical director. It was also produced in concert form in Bristol, in July 2010.

Having returned to London alone in 1986 while his wife recovered from an illness, Stanshall saw &quot;Stinkfoot&quot; briefly, but unsuccessfully, revived at the Bloomsbury Theatre. After this, he returned to the stage again, touring in a solo show, &#x27;Rawlinson Dog-Ends&#x27;, initially with support from musicians including Jack Bruce. When Bruce quit, over a lack of adequate rehearsals, Moss stepped in to provide bass.

==Marriage and family==
In 1968, Stanshall married fellow art student Monica Peiser, and their son Rupert was born that year. They divorced in 1975.

On 9 September 1980, Stanshall married Pamela &#x27;Ki&#x27; Longfellow, an American writer who had a daughter from an earlier relationship. The Stanshalls had a daughter, Silky, born on 16 August 1979, before they married; she was named after Silky Sullivan, a racehorse that was a childhood favourite of her mother. Stanshall celebrated Silky&#x27;s birth in &quot;The Tube&quot;, and his marriage to Ki in &quot;Bewilderbeeste&quot;, both songs being included on his album &quot;Teddy Boys Don&#x27;t Knit&quot;. He later gave his wife the name of &#x27;Ki&#x27; from a dream. Even though their comic opera &quot;Stinkfoot&quot; was a success in late 1985, Stanshall returned alone to London after the turn of the year, while Longfellow recuperated from an illness brought on by overwork and stress. The Stanshalls lived apart until his sudden death in March 1995.

Years later, Longfellow wrote &quot;The Illustrated Vivian Stanshall: A Fairytale of Grimm Art&quot;, detailing Stanshall&#x27;s life and work from 1977 to 1995.

==Memoirs==
In 1991, Stanshall made a 15-minute autobiographical piece called &quot;Vivian Stanshall: The Early Years&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;Crank&quot;, for BBC2&#x27;s &quot;The Late Show&quot;. He confessed to having been terrified of his father, who he said had always disapproved of him. His last television appearance, on &quot;The Late Show&quot;, was broadcast on 27 November that year.

A programme for BBC Radio 4, &quot;Vivian Stanshall: Essex Teenager to Renaissance Man&quot; (1994) included an interview with his mother. She insisted his father had loved him. Stanshall said on the same programme that his father had never shown it, not even on his deathbed.

==Death==
Stanshall was found dead on the morning of 6 March 1995, after an electrical fire had broken out as he slept in his top-floor flat in Muswell Hill, north London. His private funeral service was held at the Golders Green Crematorium, north London. A few days later his memorial service was held at St Patrick&#x27;s Church, Soho Square.

A memorial plaque was unveiled in the Poets&#x27; Corner at Golders Green Crematorium on 13 December 2015, opposite that of his friend Keith Moon, by his widow Ki and his daughter Silky. Others attending included actor Tony Slattery, singer Linda Thompson and actress Cherri Gilham. The cost of the plaque was met by many of his fans and friends via online crowdfunding.

==Legacy and honours==
Writing in &quot;The Independent&quot; after Stanshall&#x27;s death, Chris Welch wrote: &quot;Seen by some as a wild eccentric, and a powerful personality who could be both charming and intimidating, Stanshall was perhaps too large a figure even for the music business to handle. ... He needed a producer to channel his energies, but always wanted to remain his own boss, having suffered too many perceived indignities in his early experience of the music business.&quot; He was described by Neil Innes as &quot;a national treasure&quot;.

In 2001, Welch and Lucian Randall wrote a biography titled &quot;Ginger Geezer: The Life of Vivian Stanshall&quot;. In the same year, Jeremy Pascall and Stephen Fry produced a documentary about Stanshall for BBC Radio 4. Fry knew Stanshall quite well and, along with his personal thoughts, introduced a series of reminiscences. The show featured many clips from Stanshall&#x27;s work. The recording includes one of Stanshall&#x27;s last poems, titled &quot;With My Mouth Turned Down for the Night&quot;.

In 2003, Sea Urchin Editions published the script of the Stanshalls&#x27; &quot;Stinkfoot: An English Comic Opera&quot;, with an introduction by his widow, Ki.

On 22 December 2009, BBC Radio 4&#x27;s series &quot;Great Lives&quot; featured a programme on Stanshall, who had been nominated by Neil Innes, with Ki Longfellow as expert witness, hosted by Matthew Parris.

In June 2010, the 1978 album &quot;Sir Henry at Rawlinson End&quot; was re-imagined by Michael Livesley as a one-man show, in which he starred as the narrator and all the characters, backed by a six-piece band replicating the instrumentation of the original. The production won rave reviews, then premiered in London on 14 October 2011. It also drew praise from Innes and Adrian Edmondson, who were in the audience. On 25 March 2013, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of Stanshall&#x27;s birth, Livesley was joined by Innes, Rick Wakeman, Danny Thompson, Rodney Slater, Sam Spoons, Vernon Dudley Bowhay-Nowell, &#x27;Legs&#x27; Larry Smith and John Otway, to perform &quot;Sir Henry at Rawlinson End&quot; at the Bloomsbury Theatre. The event was organised by Livesley and Stanshall&#x27;s son Rupert.

On 11 October 2011, the &quot;Blackpool Comedy Carpet&quot;, a large public artwork by Gordon Young, was unveiled in Blackpool on the town&#x27;s seaside promenade. It is made of 300 slabs of granite that cover about 2200 square meters. Featuring catchphrases, jokes and names, it commemorates more than 1000 selected &quot;influential&quot; comics, most of whom have played Blackpool in the last hundred years. The project was commissioned by the Blackpool Council as part of its redevelopment plan, and it is one of the largest pieces of public art in the United Kingdom. Stanshall is represented in the work by two quotes and his name.

In 2012, Poppydisc Records reissued both a vinyl and CD version of Stanshall&#x27;s &quot;Men Opening Umbrellas Ahead&quot;, remastered with new liner notes from his widow and daughter.

On 26 January 2018, Longfellow&#x27;s biography/memoir/free-form art book detailing Stanshall&#x27;s life was published. Filled with Stanshall&#x27;s paintings, sketches, notes, letters, and private photographs, &quot;The Illustrated Vivian Stanshall, a Fairytale of Grimm Art&quot; (illustrated by the young illustrator and animator Ben Wickey) contains not only Longfellow&#x27;s impressions of the life and work of her husband of 18 years, but also the remembrances of many of his closest friends, as well as Vivian&#x27;s private journals.

In July 2023 Madfish Music released two posthumously completed albums by Stanshall: &quot;Dog Howl in Tune&quot;, a rock album originally intended as a follow-up to &quot;Teddy Boys Don&#x27;t Knit&quot;; and &quot;Rawlinson&#x27;s End&quot;, using the remaining tapes from Vivian&#x27;s archive. In the case of &quot;Rawlinson&#x27;s End&quot;, some of the narration and music was recorded by Stanshall, while the rest incorporates material from the existing BBC John Peel sessions, including some that was previously unbroadcast. The first was re-constructed and produced by Andy Frizell, the second by Michael Livesley.

<doc id="158740" wikidata="Q285028" url="?curid=158740" title="Exhaust gas recirculation">
<text>In internal combustion engines, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is a nitrogen oxide () emissions reduction technique used in petrol/gasoline, diesel engines and some hydrogen engines. EGR works by recirculating a portion of an engine&#x27;s exhaust gas back to the engine cylinders. The exhaust gas displaces atmospheric air and reduces in the combustion chamber. Reducing the amount of oxygen reduces the amount of fuel that can burn in the cylinder thereby reducing peak in-cylinder temperatures. The actual amount of recirculated exhaust gas varies with the engine operating parameters.

In the combustion cylinder, is produced by high-temperature mixtures of atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen, and this usually occurs at cylinder peak pressure. In a spark-ignition engine, an ancillary benefit of recirculating exhaust gases via an external EGR valve is an increase in efficiency, as charge dilution allows a larger throttle position and reduces associated pumping losses. Mazda&#x27;s turbocharged SkyActiv gasoline direct injection engine uses recirculated and cooled exhaust gases to reduce combustion chamber temperatures, thereby permitting the engine to run at higher boost levels before the air-fuel mixture must be enriched to prevent engine knocking.

In a gasoline engine, this inert exhaust displaces some amount of combustible charge in the cylinder, effectively reducing the quantity of charge available for combustion without affecting the air-fuel ratio. In a diesel engine, the exhaust gas replaces some of the excess oxygen in the pre-combustion mixture. Because forms primarily when a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen is subjected to high temperature, the lower combustion chamber temperatures caused by EGR reduces the amount of that the combustion process generates. Gases re-introduced from EGR systems will also contain near equilibrium concentrations of and CO; the small fraction initially within the combustion chamber inhibits the total net production of these and other pollutants when sampled on a time average. Chemical properties of different fuels limit how much EGR may be used. For example methanol is more tolerant to EGR than gasoline.

== History ==
The first EGR systems were crude; some were as simple as an orifice jet between the exhaust and intake tracts which admitted exhaust to the intake tract whenever the engine was running. Difficult starting, rough idling, reduced performance and lost fuel economy inevitably resulted. By 1973, an EGR valve controlled by manifold vacuum opened or closed to admit exhaust to the intake tract only under certain conditions. Control systems grew more sophisticated as automakers gained experience; Volkswagen&#x27;s &quot;Coolant Controlled Exhaust Gas Recirculation&quot; system of 1973 exemplified this evolution: a coolant temperature sensor blocked vacuum to the EGR valve until the engine reached normal operating temperature. This prevented driveability problems due to unnecessary exhaust induction; forms under elevated temperature conditions generally not present with a cold engine. Moreover, the EGR valve was controlled, in part, by vacuum drawn from the carburetor&#x27;s venturi, which allowed more precise constraint of EGR flow to only those engine load conditions under which is likely to form. Later, backpressure transducers were added to the EGR valve control to further tailor EGR flow to engine load conditions. Most modern engines now need exhaust gas recirculation to meet emissions standards. However, recent innovations have led to the development of engines that do not require them. The 3.6 Chrysler Pentastar engine is one example that does not require EGR.

==EGR==

The exhaust gas contains water vapor and carbon dioxide which both have lower heat capacity ratio than air. Adding exhaust gas therefore reduces pressure and temperature during the isentropic compression in the cylinder, thereby lowering the adiabatic flame temperature.

In a typical automotive spark-ignited (SI) engine, 5% to 15% of the exhaust gas is routed back to the intake as EGR. The maximum quantity is limited by the need of the mixture to sustain a continuous flame front during the combustion event; excessive EGR in poorly set up applications can cause misfires and partial burns. Although EGR does measurably slow combustion, this can largely be compensated for by advancing spark timing. The impact of EGR on engine efficiency largely depends on the specific engine design, and sometimes leads to a compromise between efficiency and emissions. In certain types of situations, a properly operating EGR can theoretically increase the efficiency of gasoline engines via several mechanisms:
* Reduced throttle losses. The addition of inert exhaust gas into the intake system means that for a given power output, the throttle plate must be opened further, resulting in increased inlet manifold pressure and reduced throttling losses.
* Reduced heat rejection. Lowered peak combustion temperatures not only reduces formation, it also reduces the loss of thermal energy to combustion chamber surfaces, leaving more available for conversion to mechanical work during the expansion stroke.
* Reduced chemical dissociation. The lower peak temperatures result in more of the released energy remaining as sensible energy near Top Dead Center (TDC), rather than being bound up (early in the expansion stroke) in the dissociation of combustion products. This effect is minor compared to the first two.

EGR is typically not employed at high loads because it would reduce peak power output. This is because it reduces the intake charge density. EGR is also omitted at idle (low-speed, zero load) because it would cause unstable combustion, resulting in rough idle.

Since the EGR system recirculates a portion of exhaust gases, over time the valve can become clogged with carbon deposits, which will prevent it from operating properly. Clogged EGR valves can sometimes be cleaned, but replacement is necessary if the valve is faulty.

== Diesel engines ==
Because diesel engines depend on the heat of compression to ignite their fuel, they are fundamentally different from spark-ignited engines. The physical process of diesel-fuel combustion is such that the most complete combustion occurs at the highest temperatures. Unfortunately, the production of nitrogen oxides () increases at high temperatures. The goal of EGR is thus to reduce production by reducing the combustion temperatures.

In modern diesel engines, the EGR gas is usually cooled with a heat exchanger to allow the introduction of a greater mass of recirculated gas. However, uncooled EGR designs do exist; these are often referred to as hot-gas recirculation (HGR). Cooled EGR components are exposed to repeated, rapid changes in temperatures, which can cause coolant leak and catastrophic engine failure.

Unlike spark-ignition engines, diesel engines are not limited by the need for a contiguous flamefront. Furthermore, since diesels always operate with excess air, they benefit (in terms of reduced output) from EGR rates as high as 50%. However, a 50% EGR rate is only suitable when the diesel engine is at idle, since this is when there is otherwise a large excess of air.

Because modern diesel engines often have a throttle, EGR can reduce the need for throttling, thereby eliminating this type of loss in the same way that it does for spark-ignited engines. In a naturally aspirated (i.e. nonturbocharged) engine, such a reduction in throttling also reduces the problem of engine oil being sucked past the piston rings into the cylinder and causing oil-derived carbon deposits there. (This benefit only applies to nonturbocharged engines.)

In diesel engines in particular, EGR systems come with serious drawbacks, one of which is a reduction in engine longevity. For example, because the EGR system routes exhaust gas directly back into the cylinder intake without any form of filtration, this exhaust gas contains carbon particulates. And, because these tiny particles are abrasive, the recirculation of this material back into the cylinder increases engine wear. This is so because these carbon particles will blow by the piston rings (causing piston-cylinder-interface wear in the process) and then end up in the crankcase oil, where they will cause further wear throughout the engine simply because their tiny size passes through typical oil filters. This enables them to be recirculated indefinitely (until the next oil change takes place).
Exhaust gas—which consists largely of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor—has a higher specific heat than air, so it still serves to lower peak combustion temperatures. However, adding EGR to a diesel reduces the specific heat ratio of the combustion gases in the power stroke. This reduces the amount of power that can be extracted by the piston, thereby reducing the thermodynamic efficiency.

EGR also tends to reduce the completeness of fuel combustion during the power stroke. This is plainly evident by the increase in particulate emissions that corresponds to an increase in EGR.

Particulate matter (mainly carbon and also known as soot) that is not burned in the power stroke represents wasted energy. Because of stricter regulations on particulate matter (PM), the soot-increasing effect of EGR required the introduction of further emission controls in order to compensate for the resulting PM emission increases. The most common soot-control device is a diesel particulate filter (DPF) installed downstream of the engine in the exhaust system. This captures soot but causes a reduction in fuel efficiency due to the back pressure created.

Diesel particulate filters come with their own set of very specific operational and maintenance requirements. Firstly, as the DPF captures the soot particles (which are made far more numerous due to the use of EGR), the DPF itself progressively becomes loaded with soot. This soot must then be burned off, either actively or passively.
At sufficiently high temperatures, the nitrogen dioxide component of emissions is the primary oxidizer of the soot caught in the DPF at normal operating temperatures. This process is known as passive regeneration, and it is only partially effective at burning off the captured soot. And, especially at high EGR rates, the effectiveness of passive regeneration is further reduced. This, in turn, necessitates periodic active regeneration of the DPF by burning diesel fuel directly in the oxidation catalyst in order to significantly increase exhaust-gas temperatures through the DPF to the point where PM is incinerated by the residual oxygen in the exhaust.

Because diesel fuel and engine oil both contain nonburnable (i.e. metallic and mineral) impurities, the incineration of soot (PM) in the DPF leaves behind a residue known as ash. For this reason, after repeated regeneration events, eventually the DPF must either be physically removed and cleaned in a special external process, or it must be replaced.

As noted earlier, the feeding of the low-oxygen exhaust gas into the diesel engine&#x27;s air intake engenders lower combustion temperatures, thereby reducing emissions of . By replacing some of the fresh air intake with inert gases EGR also allows the engine to reduce the amount of injected fuel without compromising ideal air-fuel mixture ratio, therefore reducing fuel consumption in low engine load situation (for ex. while the vehicle is coasting or cruising). Power is not reduced by EGR at any times, as EGR is not employed in high load engine situations. This allows engines to still deliver maximum power when needed, but lower fuel consumption despite large cylinder volume when partial load is sufficient to meet the power needs of the car and the driver.

EGR has nothing to do with oil vapor re-routing from a positive crankcase ventilation system (PCV) system, as the latter is only there to reduce oil vapor emissions, and can be present on engines with or without any EGR system. However, the tripartite mixture resulting from employing both EGR and PCV in an engine (i.e. exhaust gas, fresh air, and oil vapour) can cause the buildup of sticky tar in the intake manifold and valves. This mixture can also cause problems with components such as swirl flaps, where fitted. (These problems, which effectively take the form of an undesirable positive-feedback loop, will worsen as the engine ages. For example, as the piston rings progressively wear out, more crankcase oil will get into the exhaust stream. Simultaneously, more fuel and soot and combustion byproducts will gain access to the engine oil.)

The end result of this recirculation of both exhaust gas and crankcase oil vapour is again an increase in soot production, which however is effectively countered by the DPF, which collects these and in the end will burn those unburnt particles during regeneration, converting them into CO2 and water vapour emissions, that - unlike NOx gases - have no negative health effects.

Modern cooled EGR systems help reduce engine wear by using the waste heat recouped from the recirculated gases to help warm the coolant and hence the engine block faster to operating temperature. This also helps lower fuel consumption through reducing the time after cold starts during which the engine controller has to inject somewhat larger amounts of fuel into the cylinders to counter the effects of fuel vapor condensation on cylinder walls and lowered combustion effectiveness because of the engine block still being below ideal operating temperature. Lowering combustion temperatures also helps reducing the oxidization of engine oil, as the most significant factor affecting that is exposure of the oil to high temperatures.

Although engine manufacturers have refused to release details of the effect of EGR on fuel economy, the EPA regulations of 2002 that led to the introduction of cooled EGR were associated with a 3% drop in engine efficiency, thus bucking the trend of a 0.5% annual increase.

<doc id="158741" wikidata="Q1642768" url="?curid=158741" title="Power-to-weight ratio">
<text>Power-to-weight ratio (PWR, also called specific power, or power-to-mass ratio) is a calculation commonly applied to engines and mobile power sources to enable the comparison of one unit or design to another. Power-to-weight ratio is a measurement of actual performance of any engine or power source. It is also used as a measurement of performance of a vehicle as a whole, with the engine&#x27;s power output being divided by the weight (or mass) of the vehicle, to give a metric that is independent of the vehicle&#x27;s size. Power-to-weight is often quoted by manufacturers at the peak value, but the actual value may vary in use and variations will affect performance.

The inverse of power-to-weight, weight-to-power ratio (power loading) is a calculation commonly applied to aircraft, cars, and vehicles in general, to enable the comparison of one vehicle&#x27;s performance to another. Power-to-weight ratio is equal to thrust per unit mass multiplied by the velocity of any vehicle.
==Power-to-weight (specific power)==
The power-to-weight ratio (specific power) is defined as the power generated by the engine(s) divided by the mass. In this context, the term &quot;weight&quot; can be considered a misnomer, as it colloquially refers to mass. In a zero-gravity (weightless) environment, the power-to-weight ratio would not be considered infinite.

A typical turbocharged V8 diesel engine might have an engine power of and a mass of , giving it a power-to-weight ratio of 0.65 kW/kg (0.40 hp/lb).

Examples of high power-to-weight ratios can often be found in turbines. This is because of their ability to operate at very high speeds. For example, the Space Shuttle&#x27;s main engines used turbopumps (machines consisting of a pump driven by a turbine engine) to feed the propellants (liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen) into the engine&#x27;s combustion chamber. The original liquid hydrogen turbopump is similar in size to an automobile engine (weighing approximately ) and produces for a power-to-weight ratio of 153 kW/kg (93 hp/lb).

===Physical interpretation===
In classical mechanics, instantaneous power is the limiting value of the average work done per unit time as the time interval Δ&quot;t&quot; approaches zero (i.e. the derivative with respect to time of the work done).
:formula_1

The typically used metric unit of the power-to-weight ratio is formula_2 which equals formula_3. This fact allows one to express the power-to-weight ratio purely by SI base units. A vehicle&#x27;s power-to-weight ratio equals its acceleration times its velocity; so at twice the velocity, it experiences half the acceleration, all else being equal.

====Propulsive power====
If the work to be done is motion of a body with constant mass formula_4, whose center of mass is to be accelerated along a (possibly non-straight) line to a speed formula_5 and angle formula_6 with respect to the centre and radial of a gravitational field by an onboard powerplant, then the associated kinetic energy is

:formula_7

where:
:formula_4 is mass of the body
:formula_5 is speed of the center of mass of the body, changing with time.

The work–energy principle states that the work done to the object over a period of time is equal to the difference in its total energy over that period of time, so the rate at which work is done is equal to the rate of change of the kinetic energy (in the absence of potential energy changes).

The work done from time &quot;t&quot; to time &quot;t&quot; + Δ&quot;t&quot; along the path &quot;C&quot; is defined as the line integral formula_10, so the fundamental theorem of calculus has that power is given by formula_11.

where:
:formula_12 is acceleration of the center of mass of the body, changing with time.
:formula_13 is linear force – or thrust – applied upon the center of mass of the body, changing with time.
:formula_14 is velocity of the center of mass of the body, changing with time.
:formula_15 is torque applied upon the center of mass of the body, changing with time.
:formula_16 is angular velocity of the center of mass of the body, changing with time.

In propulsion, power is only delivered if the powerplant is in motion, and is transmitted to cause the body to be in motion. It is typically assumed here that mechanical transmission allows the powerplant to operate at peak output power. This assumption allows engine tuning to trade power band width and engine mass for transmission complexity and mass. Electric motors do not suffer from this tradeoff, instead trading their high torque for traction at low speed. The power advantage or power-to-weight ratio is then

:formula_17

where:
:formula_5 is linear speed of the center of mass of the body.

====Engine power====
The useful power of an engine with shaft power output can be calculated using a dynamometer to measure torque and rotational speed, with maximum power reached when torque multiplied by rotational speed is a maximum. For jet engines the useful power is equal to the flight speed of the aircraft multiplied by the force, known as net thrust, required to make it go at that speed. It is used when calculating propulsive efficiency.

==Examples==

===Engines===

====Heat engines and heat pumps====
Thermal energy is made up from molecular kinetic energy and latent phase energy. Heat engines are able to convert thermal energy in the form of a temperature gradient between a hot source and a cold sink into other desirable mechanical work. Heat pumps take mechanical work to regenerate thermal energy in a temperature gradient. Standard definitions should be used when interpreting how the propulsive power of a jet or rocket engine is transferred to its vehicle.

====Electric motors and electromotive generators====
An electric motor uses electrical energy to provide mechanical work, usually through the interaction of a magnetic field and current-carrying conductors. By the interaction of mechanical work on an electrical conductor in a magnetic field, electrical energy can be generated.

====Fluid engines and fluid pumps====
Fluids (liquid and gas) can be used to transmit and/or store energy using pressure and other fluid properties. Hydraulic (liquid) and pneumatic (gas) engines convert fluid pressure into other desirable mechanical or electrical work. Fluid pumps convert mechanical or electrical work into movement or pressure changes of a fluid, or storage in a pressure vessel.
====Thermoelectric generators and electrothermal actuators====
A variety of effects can be harnessed to produce thermoelectricity, thermionic emission, pyroelectricity and piezoelectricity. Electrical resistance and ferromagnetism of materials can be harnessed to generate thermoacoustic energy from an electric current.

===Electrochemical (galvanic) and electrostatic cell systems===

====(Closed cell) batteries====
All electrochemical cell batteries deliver a changing voltage as their chemistry changes from &quot;charged&quot; to &quot;discharged&quot;. A nominal output voltage and a cutoff voltage are typically specified for a battery by its manufacturer. The output voltage falls to the cutoff voltage when the battery becomes &quot;discharged&quot;. The nominal output voltage is always less than the open-circuit voltage produced when the battery is &quot;charged&quot;. The temperature of a battery can affect the power it can deliver, where lower temperatures reduce power. Total energy delivered from a single charge cycle is affected by both the battery temperature and the power it delivers. If the temperature lowers or the power demand increases, the total energy delivered at the point of &quot;discharge&quot; is also reduced.

Battery discharge profiles are often described in terms of a factor of battery capacity. For example, a battery with a nominal capacity quoted in ampere-hours (Ah) at a C/10 rated discharge current (derived in amperes) may safely provide a higher discharge current – and therefore higher power-to-weight ratio – but only with a lower energy capacity. Power-to-weight ratio for batteries is therefore less meaningful without reference to corresponding energy-to-weight ratio and cell temperature. This relationship is known as Peukert&#x27;s law.
====Electrostatic, electrolytic and electrochemical capacitors====
Capacitors store electric charge onto two electrodes separated by an electric field semi-insulating (dielectric) medium. Electrostatic capacitors feature planar electrodes onto which electric charge accumulates. Electrolytic capacitors use a liquid electrolyte as one of the electrodes and the electric double layer effect upon the surface of the dielectric-electrolyte boundary to increase the amount of charge stored per unit volume. Electric double-layer capacitors extend both electrodes with a nanoporous material such as activated carbon to significantly increase the surface area upon which electric charge can accumulate, reducing the dielectric medium to nanopores and a very thin high permittivity separator.

While capacitors tend not to be as temperature sensitive as batteries, they are significantly capacity constrained and without the strength of chemical bonds suffer from self-discharge. Power-to-weight ratio of capacitors is usually higher than batteries because charge transport units within the cell are smaller (electrons rather than ions), however energy-to-weight ratio is conversely usually lower.
====Fuel cell stacks and flow cell batteries====
Fuel cells and flow cells, although perhaps using similar chemistry to batteries, do not contain the energy storage medium or fuel. With a continuous flow of fuel and oxidant, available fuel cells and flow cells continue to convert the energy storage medium into electric energy and waste products. Fuel cells distinctly contain a fixed electrolyte whereas flow cells also require a continuous flow of electrolyte. Flow cells typically have the fuel dissolved in the electrolyte.

===Photovoltaics===
===Vehicles===
Power-to-weight ratios for vehicles are usually calculated using curb weight (for cars) or wet weight (for motorcycles), that is, excluding weight of the driver and any cargo. This could be slightly misleading, especially with regard to motorcycles, where the driver might weigh 1/3 to 1/2 as much as the vehicle itself. In the sport of competitive cycling athlete&#x27;s performance is increasingly being expressed in VAMs and thus as a power-to-weight ratio in W/kg. This can be measured through the use of a bicycle powermeter or calculated from measuring incline of a road climb and the rider&#x27;s time to ascend it.

====Locomotives====
A locomotive generally must be heavy in order to develop enough adhesion on the rails to start a train. As the coefficient of friction between steel wheels and rails seldom exceeds 0.25 in most cases, improving a locomotive&#x27;s power-to-weight ratio is often counterproductive. However, the choice of power transmission system, such as variable-frequency drive versus direct-current drive, may support a higher power-to-weight ratio by better managing propulsion power.
====Utility and practical vehicles====
Most vehicles are designed to meet passenger comfort and cargo carrying requirements. Vehicle designs trade off power-to-weight ratio to increase comfort, cargo space, fuel economy, emissions control, energy security and endurance. Reduced drag and lower rolling resistance in a vehicle design can facilitate increased cargo space without increase in the (zero cargo) power-to-weight ratio. This increases the role flexibility of the vehicle. Energy security considerations can trade off power (typically decreased) and weight (typically increased), and therefore power-to-weight ratio, for fuel flexibility or drive-train hybridisation. Some utility and practical vehicle variants such as hot hatches and sports-utility vehicles reconfigure power (typically increased) and weight to provide the perception of sports car like performance or for other psychological benefit.

=====Notable low ratio=====

=====Common power=====
=====Performance luxury, roadsters and mild sports=====
Increased engine performance is a consideration, but also other features associated with luxury vehicles. Longitudinal engines are common. Bodies vary from hot hatches, sedans (saloons), coupés, convertibles and roadsters. Mid-range dual-sport and cruiser motorcycles tend to have similar power-to-weight ratios.
====Sports vehicles====
Power-to-weight ratio is an important vehicle characteristic that affects the acceleration of sports vehicles.


====Early vehicles====
====Aircraft====
Propeller aircraft depend on high power-to-weight ratios to generate sufficient thrust to achieve sustained flight, and then for speed.
=====Thrust-to-weight ratio=====

Jet aircraft produce thrust directly.
===Human===
Power-to-weight ratio is important in cycling, since it determines acceleration and the speed during hill climbs. Since a cyclist&#x27;s power-to-weight output decreases with fatigue, it is normally discussed with relation to the length of time that he or she maintains that power. A professional cyclist can produce over 20 W/kg (0.012 hp/lb) as a five-second maximum.

<doc id="158743" wikidata="Q130936" url="?curid=158743" title="West Lothian question">
<text>The West Lothian question, also known as the English question, is a political issue in the United Kingdom. It concerns the question of whether members of Parliament (MPs) from Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales who sit in the House of Commons should be able to vote on matters that affect only England, while neither they nor MPs from England are able to vote on matters that have been devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Scottish Parliament and the Senedd (Welsh Parliament). The term &quot;West Lothian question&quot; was coined by Enoch Powell MP in 1977 after Tam Dalyell, the Labour MP for the Scottish constituency of West Lothian, raised the matter repeatedly in House of Commons debates on devolution.

In 2011 the UK Government set up the Commission on the consequences of devolution for the House of Commons, chaired by Sir William McKay, former Clerk of the House of Commons, to examine the question. The commission published a report in 2013 which proposed various procedural changes, including the recommendation that legislation which affects only England should require the support of a majority of MPs representing English constituencies. This recommendation was known as English votes for English laws. Following the election of a Conservative majority government in the 2015 general election, new parliamentary procedures and a Legislative Grand Committee were enacted to bring it into effect. The measures were subsequently abolished in 2021.

==Background==
The equivalent question was raised by the opponents of Irish Home Rule in defeating William Gladstone&#x27;s first (1886) and second (1893) home rule bills. Basil Williams enumerated four schemes which Gladstone proposed at various stages:
# Total exclusion of Irish members. 
# Inclusion of Irish members, in reduced numbers, for all purposes. 
# Inclusion of Irish members, in their full numbers, for certain specified purposes — the &quot;In and Out&quot; clause. 
# Inclusion of Irish members, in their full numbers, for all purposes — the &quot;Omnes Omnia&quot; (all people) clause.

The &quot;West Lothian question&quot; itself was first posed in 1977 during a British House of Commons debate about Scottish and Welsh devolution proposals. In the 14 November sitting, Tam Dalyell, the Labour MP for the Scottish constituency of West Lothian, asked,
For how long will English constituencies and English Honourable members tolerate ... at least 119 Honourable Members from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland exercising an important, and probably often decisive, effect on English politics while they themselves have no say in the same matters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland?

To illustrate his point, Dalyell chose the example of a member of Parliament for West Lothian who could vote on matters affecting the English town of Blackburn, Lancashire, but not on matters concerning Blackburn, West Lothian in his own constituency. The name &quot;West Lothian question&quot; was later coined by the Ulster Unionist MP Enoch Powell in a response to Dalyell&#x27;s speech, when he said &quot;We have finally grasped what the Honourable Member for West Lothian is getting at. Let us call it the West Lothian question.&quot; The question is more commonly assumed to refer to the anomaly that came into being in 1999, with Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland members at Westminster allowed to vote upon English matters, but MPs for English constituencies having no influence on affairs which were devolved to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Dalyell was a vocal opponent of Scottish devolution in the 1979 and 1997 plebiscites. A devolved Scottish Parliament was created in 1999 after a clear majority voted in favour of devolution in the second referendum.

===Legal status===
The Scottish Parliament was formed by statute, the Scotland Act 1998, and is thus a creation of Westminster. No sovereign status on the Scottish Parliament is conferred, and the act has not changed the status of the Westminster Parliament as the supreme legislature of Scotland, with Westminster retaining the ability to override, or veto, any decisions taken by the Scottish Parliament. The Westminster Parliament remains the sovereign body; powers are &quot;devolved&quot; rather than transferred to the Scottish Parliament. The ability of all Westminster MPs to vote on Scottish legislation has not been legally diminished by devolution, as made clear by Section 28(7) of the Scotland Act 1998, which states that the legislative powers of the Scottish Parliament do &quot;not affect the power of the Parliament of the United Kingdom to make laws for Scotland&quot;.

Legislation relating to &quot;reserved issues&quot; such as defence, national security, foreign policy and monetary and economic issues are voted on by all the MPs at Westminster to ensure consistency across the whole of the United Kingdom. The Scottish Parliament is not able to pass laws on these issues itself, as they were not devolved. The West Lothian question is not involved in this situation, as all parts of the Union have a say roughly proportional to their population and all are equally affected.

During devolution, a convention was created to manage the power of Westminster to legislate on matters within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament. This is known as the Sewel Convention, and the related Scottish parliamentary motions are now known as legislative consent motions (previously Sewel motions). These motions (of which there are around a dozen per year) allow MPs to vote on issues which, among other things, are within the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s legislative competence. The Sewel Convention states that the Westminster Parliament will not normally legislate on devolved matters in Scotland without first obtaining the consent of the Scottish Parliament.

==English votes for English laws (EVEL)==

During the 2000s a number of pieces of legislation which affected only or mainly England were passed by the UK Parliament, although the votes cast by MPs were such that the legislation would not have been passed if only the votes cast by MPs representing English constituencies had been counted. The opposition Conservative Party commissioned a report, &quot;Devolution, The West Lothian Question and the Future of the Union&quot;, which proposed some procedural changes restricting the participation of MPs representing non-English constituencies during the passage of bills relating only to England.

While the Conservatives were in government from 2010 to 2015 in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, they set up the McKay Commission to look into the question. The Commission proposed that bills in the House of Commons which affected England solely or differently should require a majority vote of MPs representing English constituencies. The Conservative manifesto for the 2015 general election included a proposal that England-only legislation should require approval from a Legislative Grand Committee prior to its Third Reading in the House of Commons. Having won a majority in that election, the Conservative government used a change in standing orders in October 2015 to give MPs representing English (or English and Welsh) constituencies a &quot;veto&quot; over laws affecting only England (or only England and Wales). Thus, a new law could no longer be imposed only on England by a majority of all MPs if a majority of English MPs were opposed. However, a proposed new law could still be vetoed by a majority of all MPs even if a majority of English MPs were in favour. The measures were abolished in 2021, with the government saying that they had &quot;added complexity and delay to the legislative process&quot; and that their removal would allow all MPs to be represented equally.

==Other possible answers to the question==
===Reversal of devolution===
Reversion of all devolved powers, and abolition of the devolved administrations. 
No voting member from one region would have power over another region, wherein the voting members of that other region do not have reciprocal rights; all regions would be treated equally.
===English devolution===
====English parliament or assembly====
The creation of a devolved English parliament or assembly, with full legislative powers, akin to the Scottish Parliament is seen by some as a solution to this problem, with full legislative powers also being conferred on the existing Welsh Parliament. The Westminster (United Kingdom) Parliament would continue to meet and legislate on matters of UK-wide competence such as Defence, Foreign Affairs and economic matters with the parliaments of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland legislating locally. In the early-20th-century context of Irish home rule, the equivalent option was dubbed Home Rule All Round.

Lord Falconer, the former Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, has stated that he believes that an English Parliament would &quot;dwarf all other institutions.&quot; Peter Hain, who campaigned for a Welsh Assembly, warned that creating an English parliament or trying to stop Scottish and Welsh MPs from voting on England-only matters would break up the Union. Chuka Umunna suggested in July 2015 that the Labour Party should support the creation of a separate English parliament, as part of a federal United Kingdom.

====Regional assemblies====
The Labour government of Tony Blair attempted to address part of the West Lothian question by introducing English regional assemblies with no legislative powers. Originally, it was planned that these would be directly elected. The London Assembly was the first of these, established following a referendum in 1998, in which public and media attention was focused principally on the post of Mayor of London. Ken Livingstone was the first directly elected mayor of London. He started his victory speech with &quot;As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted 14 years ago&quot;, making it clear he saw the London Assembly as a recreation of a similar London wide authority to that of the Greater London Council, which he had led before it was abolished in the 1980s.

Further progress was thwarted when a referendum in the North East rejected the proposal for an elected assembly in November 2004 leading to the shelving of similar proposals for other English regions. The Regional Development Agencies were all scrapped by March 2012 with their powers and functions being transferred either to local government or in the case of London, the Greater London Authority.

====Increased powers to English counties and cities====
Douglas Carswell and Daniel Hannan have proposed that all the powers currently devolved to the Scottish Parliament should also be devolved to the English counties and cities. This would mean that the situation of Scottish MPs voting on policy which only affected England would no longer arise, because parliament would no longer be responsible for areas of policy which affected only England. Therefore, parliament would have to choose to make policy either for the United Kingdom as a whole, or not at all.
Carswell and Hannan write: &quot;All the fields of policy currently within the purview of the Holyrood Parliament should be transferred to English counties and cities (thereby, incidentally, answering the west Lothian Question).&quot;

====Council of England====
In 2022, Labour proposed a body to be known as the &quot;Council of England&quot;, chaired by the prime minister, to bring together combined authority mayors, representatives of local government and other stakeholders. The Council of England would be complemented by a &quot;Council of the UK&quot; made up of the UK prime minister and the first ministers of the devolved governments and a &quot;Council of the Nations and Regions&quot; which would bring together the UK central government, devolved administrations, and representatives from the different parts of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The three bodies would be supported by their own intergovernmental secretariat.

In 2024, the new Labour government established a UK wide Council of the Nations and Regions and an England only Mayoral Council including ministers from the UK government, the Mayor of London and mayors of England&#x27;s combined authorities. Unlike the proposed &quot;Council of England&quot;, the Mayoral Council does not include representatives from local government in areas without a combined authority.

====English territorial office and secretary of state====
The Labour Party manifesto for the 2017 general election included a commitment to establish the post of a &quot;Minister for England&quot; within the Department of Communities and Local Government who would work alongside the existing secretaries of state for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

A 2022 report by the Electoral Reform Society suggested the establishment of an &quot;England Office&quot; to act as a representative for English regional and local government to the UK government and serve to coordinate between central and local government on English devolved matters. It also called for an &quot;English Leaders&#x27; Forum&quot; to bring together UK ministers with combined authority mayors, single local authority mayors and council leaders.

In a report titled &quot;Devolving English Government&quot; published in April 2023, to counter what they described as over-centralisation and a democratic deficit in England, the Institute for Government and the University of Cambridge&#x27;s Bennett Institute for Public Policy proposed the establishment of an &quot;Office for England&quot; led by a &quot;Secretary of State for England&quot; and the formation of an &quot;English Devolution Council&quot;. The Existing Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government would be split into a Department for Housing and Communities and an Office for England, which would take on responsibility for oversight of devolved and local governance in England. The Secretary of State for England would chair a cabinet committee for England including other secretaries of state from departments whose remits mainly apply to England only. The English Devolution Council would include the Mayor of London and existing combined authority mayors. An interim mechanism would be put in place for the participation of local leaders in areas of England without a combined authority. The role of the council would be to debate issues related to local and regional governance in England, to call ministers and experts to provide evidence and to advise the UK central Government on English affairs.

===Dissolution of the Union===
Another solution might be the dissolution of the United Kingdom leading to some or all of the countries of the United Kingdom (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales) becoming independent sovereign states. The Scottish National Party (SNP), which campaigns for Scottish independence, won an outright majority in the Scottish Parliament in the 2011 Scottish election. A referendum was held on 18 September 2014, with voters rejecting independence by 55% to 45%. In Wales, Welsh Nationalist party Plaid Cymru holds Welsh independence as a long-term aim, while Propel, formerly the Welsh National Party, more aggressively campaigns for independence. In Northern Ireland there are no mainstream political parties calling for an independent Northern Irish state, but parties calling for a united Ireland include Sinn Féin and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP).

===Reducing the number of Scottish MPs===

During the existence of the Parliament of Northern Ireland (1921–1972), the number of MPs elected from Northern Ireland to Westminster was below the standard ratio of MPs compared with the rest of the UK. During periods when the predominantly unionist MPs from Northern Ireland deprived Labour of working majorities, Conservatives supported the principle that &quot;every member of the House of Commons is equal to every other member of the House of Commons&quot;. Scotland traditionally enjoyed a greater number of MPs per head of population than the rest of the UK, but this advantage was reduced significantly at the 2005 UK general election. An argument against the idea of having a lower number of MPs, in return for more devolved powers, is that if the national parliament takes important decisions (such as waging war) then people should be fully represented.

<text>Lallans ( , ; a Modern Scots variant of the word &quot;lawlands&quot;, referring to the lowlands of Scotland), is a term that was traditionally used to refer to the Scots language as a whole. However, more recent interpretations assume it refers to the dialects of south and central Scotland, while &quot;Doric&quot;, a term once used to refer to Scots dialects in general, is now generally seen to refer to the Mid Northern Scots dialects spoken in the north-east of Scotland.

==Burns and Stevenson==
Both Robert Burns and Robert Louis Stevenson used it to refer to the Scots language as a whole.

They took nae pains their speech to balance,
Or rules to gie;
But spak their thoughts in plain, braid lallans,
Like you or me.
:—Robert Burns in &quot;Epistle To William Simson&quot;

&quot;What tongue does your auld bookie speak?&quot;
He&#x27;ll spier; an&#x27; I, his mou to steik:
&quot;No bein&#x27; fit to write in Greek,
I wrote in Lallan,
Dear to my heart as the peat reek,
Auld as Tantallon.
:—Robert Louis Stevenson in &quot;The Maker to Posterity&quot;

==Synthetic Scots==
The term &quot;Lallans&quot; was also used during the Scottish Renaissance of the early 20th century to refer to what Hugh MacDiarmid called &quot;synthetic Scots&quot;, i.e., a synthesis integrating, blending, and combining various forms of the Scots language, both vernacular and archaic. This was intended as a classical, standard Scots for a world-class literature.

Sydney Goodsir Smith in his 1951 essay &quot;A Short Introduction to Scottish Literature&quot; commented:

:&quot;“When MacDiarmid spoke of &#x27;Synthetic Scots&#x27;, he merely referred to another aspect of this necessary revolution; that we should forget the whole poverty-stricken &#x27;dialect&#x27; tradition that Burns and his predecessors had unconsciously been responsible for, and use again all the rich resources of the language as Dunbar and the Makars had used it, as had Burns and Fergusson, Scott, Galt, Stevenson, and George Douglas Brown. In fact to make a synthesis where for too long there had been &quot;disintegration&quot;.&quot;

However, the result was more often than not Scots words grafted on to a standard English grammatical structure somewhat removed from traditional spoken Scots, its main practitioners not being habitual Lowland Scots speakers themselves. &quot;In addition, the present century has seen the conscious creation of a &#x27;mainstream&#x27; variety of Scots — a standard literary variety... referred to as &#x27;synthetic Scots&#x27;, now generally goes under the name Lallans (=Lowlands)... In its grammar and spelling, it shows the marked influence of Standard English, more so than other Scots dialects.&quot;

MacDiarmid&#x27;s detractors often referred to it as &quot;plastic Scots&quot; — a word play on &quot;synthetic&quot; as in synthetic plastics — to emphasize its artificiality.

Roy Campbell, a South African poet of proudly Scottish descent and political opponent and critic of MacDiarmid since the Spanish Civil War, in later life poked fun at MacDiarmid&#x27;s use of Synthetic Scots in the poem &quot;Ska-hawtch Wha Hae! A Likkle wee poom i&#x27;th&#x27; Aulde Teashoppe Pidgin Brogue, Lallands or Butter-Scotch (Wi&#x27; apooligees to MockDiarmid)&quot;.
In a footnote explaining the poem, Campbell scholar Joseph Pearce wrote, &quot;MacDiarmid championed the use of Scots... in poetry, often employing traditional or regional parochialisms in artificial or dubious contexts.&quot;

Sydney Goodsir Smith, however, defended the literary use of the idiom in his &quot;Epistle to John Guthrie&quot;:

:&quot;We&#x27;ve come intil a gey queer time&quot;
:&quot;Whan scrievin Scots is near a crime,&quot;
:&quot;&#x27;There&#x27;s no one speaks like that&#x27;, they fleer,&quot;
:&quot;-But wha the deil spoke like King Lear?&quot;

==Magazines==
&quot;Lallans&quot; is the name of the magazine of the Scots Language Society.

In Ulster the neologism &quot;Ullans&quot; merging &quot;Ulster&quot; and &quot;Lallans&quot; is often used to refer to a revived literary variety of Ulster Scots. The magazine of the Ulster Scots Language Society is also named &quot;Ullans&quot;.

<doc id="158755" wikidata="Q2325048" url="?curid=158755" title="Stratified charge engine">
<text>A stratified charge engine describes a certain type of internal combustion engine, usually spark ignition (SI) engine that can be used in trucks, automobiles, portable and stationary equipment. The term &quot;stratified charge&quot; refers to the working fluids and fuel vapors entering the cylinder. Usually the fuel is injected into the cylinder or enters as a fuel rich vapor where a spark or other means are used to initiate ignition where the fuel rich zone interacts with the air to promote complete combustion. A stratified charge can allow for slightly higher compression ratios without &quot;knock,&quot; and leaner air/fuel ratio than in conventional internal combustion engines.

Conventionally, a four-stroke (petrol or gasoline) Otto cycle engine is fueled by drawing a mixture of air and fuel into the combustion chamber during the intake stroke. This produces a homogeneous charge: a homogeneous mixture of air and fuel, which is ignited by a spark plug at a predetermined moment near the top of the compression stroke.

In a homogeneous charge system, the air/fuel ratio is kept very close to stoichiometric, meaning it contains the exact amount of air necessary for complete combustion of the fuel. This gives stable combustion, but it places an upper limit on the engine&#x27;s efficiency: any attempt to improve fuel economy by running a much leaner mixture (less fuel or more air) with a homogeneous charge results in slower combustion and a higher engine temperature; this impacts on power and emissions, notably increasing nitrogen oxides or NOx.

In simple terms a stratified charge engine creates a richer mixture of fuel near the spark and a leaner mixture throughout the rest of the combustion chamber. The rich mixture ignites easily and in turn ignites the lean mixture throughout the rest of the chamber; ultimately allowing the engine to use a leaner mixture thus improving efficiency while ensuring complete combustion.

==Advantages==

===Higher compression ratio===
A higher mechanical compression ratio, or dynamic compression ratio with forced induction, can be used to improve thermodynamic efficiency. Because fuel is not injected into the combustion chamber until just before the combustion is required to begin, there is little risk of pre-ignition or engine knock.

===Leaner burn===

The engine can also run on a much leaner overall air/fuel ratio, using stratified charge, in which a small charge of a rich fuel mixture is ignited first and used to improve combustion of a larger charge of a lean fuel mixture.

==Disadvantages==
Disadvantages include: 
* Increased injector cost and complexity
* Higher fuel pressure requirements
* Increased NOx formation, due to the presence of extremely lean zones. These zones are not usually present in a gasoline engine, because the air and fuel is better mixed.

==Combustion management==
Combustion can be problematic if a lean mixture is present at the spark plug. However, fueling a petrol engine directly allows more fuel to be directed towards the spark-plug than elsewhere in the combustion-chamber. This results in a stratified charge: one in which the air/fuel ratio is not homogeneous throughout the combustion-chamber, but varies in a controlled (and potentially quite complex) way across the volume of the cylinder.

Charge stratification can also be achieved where there is no &#x27;in cylinder&#x27; stratification: the inlet mixture can be so lean that it is unable to be ignited by the limited energy provided by a conventional spark plug. This exceptionally lean mixture can, however, be ignited by the use of a conventional mixture strength of 12-15:1, in the case of a petrol fuelled engine, being fed into a small combustion chamber adjacent to and connected to the main lean-mixture chamber. The large flame front from this burning mixture is sufficient to combust the charge. It can be seen from this method of charge stratification that the lean charge is &#x27;burnt&#x27; and the engine utilising this form of stratification is no longer subject to &#x27; knock&#x27; or uncontrolled combustion. The fuel being burnt in the lean charge is therefore not &#x27;knock&#x27; or octane restricted. This type of stratification therefore can utilise a wide variety of fuels; the specific energy output being dependent only on the calorific value of the fuel.

A relatively rich air/fuel mixture is directed to the spark-plug using multi-hole injectors. This mixture is sparked, giving a strong, even and predictable flame-front. This in turn results in a high-quality combustion of the much weaker mixture elsewhere in the cylinder.

==Comparison with diesel engine==

It is worth comparing contemporary directly fueled petrol engines with direct-injection diesel engines. Petrol can burn faster than diesel fuel, allowing higher maximum engine speeds and thus greater maximum power for sporting engines. Diesel fuel, on the other hand, has a higher energy density, and in combination with higher combustion pressures can deliver very strong torque and high thermodynamic efficiency for more &quot;normal&quot; road vehicles.

This comparison of &#x27;burn&#x27; rates is a rather simplistic view. Although petrol and diesel engines appear similar in operation, the two types operate on entirely different principles. In earlier manufactured editions the external characteristics were obvious. Most petrol engines were carbureted, sucking the fuel/air mixture into the engine, while the diesel only sucked in air and the fuel was directly injected at high pressure into the cylinder. In the conventional four-stroke petrol engine the spark plug commences to ignite the mixture in the cylinder at up to forty degrees before top dead centre while the piston is still travelling up the bore. Within this movement of the piston up the bore, controlled combustion of the mixture takes place and the maximum pressure occurs just after top dead centre, with the pressure diminishing as the piston travels down the bore. i.e. the cylinder volume in relation to the cylinder pressure-time generation remains essentially constant over the combustion cycle. Diesel engine operation on the other hand inhales and compresses air only by the motion of the piston moving to top dead centre. At this point maximum cylinder pressure has been reached. The fuel is now injected into the cylinder and the fuel &#x27; burn&#x27; or expansion is started at this point by the high temperature of the, now compressed, air. As the fuel burns it expands exerting pressure on the piston, which in turn develops torque at the crankshaft. It can be seen that the diesel engine is operating at constant pressure. As the gas expands the piston is also moving down the cylinder. By this process the piston and subsequently the crank experiences a greater torque, which is also exerted over a longer time interval than its petrol equivalent.

== History ==

The principle of injecting fuel directly into the combustion chamber at the moment at which combustion is required to start was first invented by George Brayton in 1887, but it has been used to good effect in petrol engines for a long time. Brayton describes his invention as follows: &quot;I have discovered that heavy oils can be mechanically converted into a finely-divided condition within a firing portion of the cylinder, or in a communicating firing chamber.&quot; Another part reads &quot;I have for the first time, so far as my knowledge extends, regulated speed by variably controlling the direct discharge of liquid fuel into the combustion chamber or cylinder into a finely-divided condition highly favorable to immediate combustion&quot;. This was the first engine to use a lean burn system to regulate engine speed / output. In this manner the engine fired on every power stroke and speed / output was controlled solely by the quantity of fuel injected.

===Ricardo=== 
Harry Ricardo first began working with the idea of a lean burn &quot;stratified charge&quot; engine in the early 1900s. In the 1920s he made improvements on his earlier designs.

===Hesselman===

An early example of gasoline direct injection was the Hesselman engine invented by Swedish engineer Jonas Hesselman in 1925. Hesselman engines used the ultra lean burn principle and injected the fuel in the end of the compression stroke and then ignited it with a spark plug, it was often started on gasoline and then switched over to run on diesel or kerosene. The Texaco Controlled Combustion System (TCCS) was a multifuel system developed in the 1950s which closely resembled the Hesselman design. The TCCS was tested in UPS delivery vans and was found to have an overall increase in economy of about 35%.

===Honda===
Honda&#x27;s CVCC engine, released in the early 1970s models of Civic, then Accord and City later in the decade, is a form of stratified charge engine that had wide market acceptance for considerable time. The CVCC system had conventional inlet and exhaust valves and a third, supplementary, inlet valve that charged an area around the spark plug. The spark plug and CVCC inlet were isolated from the main cylinder by a perforated metal plate. At ignition a series of flame fronts shot into the very lean main charge, through the perforations, ensuring complete ignition. In the Honda City Turbo such engines produced a high power-to-weight ratio at engine speeds of 7,000 rpm and above.

===Jaguar===
Jaguar Cars in the 1980s developed the Jaguar V12 engine, H.E. (so called High Efficiency) version, which fit in the Jaguar XJ12 and Jaguar XJS models and used a stratified charge design called the &#x27;May Fireball&#x27; in order to reduce the engine&#x27;s very heavy fuel consumption..

===Vespa===
The Vespa ET2 scooter had a 50 cc two-stroke engine in which air was admitted through the transfer port and a rich fuel mixture was injected into the cylinder near the spark plug just before ignition. The injection system was purely mechanical, using a timed pumping cylinder and a non-return valve.
On its downward stroke it compresses the rich mixture to about 70 psi at which time the rising pressure raises a spring loaded poppet valve off its seat and the charge is squirted into the cylinder. There it is aimed at the spark plug area and ignited. The combustion pressure immediately shuts the spring-loaded poppet valve and from then on its (&quot;sic&quot;) just a &quot;regular&quot; stratified-charge ignition process with the flame front igniting those lean mixture areas in the cylinder. 
===Volkswagen===
Volkswagen currently uses stratified charge on its direct injection 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, 1.8 and 2.0 litres TFSI (Turbo fuel stratified injection) gasoline engines, in combination with turbocharging.

===Mercedes-Benz===

Mercedes-Benz has been employing stratified charge engines with its Blue DIRECT system.
With the stratified-charge application, the 3.0L V-6 will continue to employ direct fuel injection, but the injectors have been redesigned to spray under higher pressure later in the intake stroke, just before compression, and the fuel is shaped to arrive in certain areas within the cylinder to optimize combustion.
This strategy makes for an air-fuel mix within the chamber that is much leaner than with a conventional homogeneous-charge system that fills the chamber more uniformly before combustion.
==Research==
SAE International has published papers on experimental work with stratified charge engines.

== TFSI engines ==
Turbo fuel stratified injection (TFSI) is a trademark of the Volkswagen Group for a type of forced-aspiration (&quot;turbo&quot;) engine where the fuel is pressure-injected straight into the combustion chamber in such a way as to create a stratified charge. FSI direct injection technology increases the torque and power of spark-ignition engines, makes them as much as 15 percent more economical and reduces exhaust emissions.

===Advantages===
Some advantages of TFSI engines:
# Better fuel distribution and better fuel charge inside the combustion chamber
# During the injection process the fuel gets evaporated, cooling the cylinder chamber
# Cooling effect of the pressurized fuel allows for use of a lower octane fuel leading to a cost savings for the end user
# Higher compression ratios, which translates into more power
# Increased fuel combustion efficiency
# Higher power during pick-up of vehicle

===Disadvantages===
# Carbon build up behind the intake valves. Since fuel is directly injected inside the combustion chamber, it never gets a chance to wash any contaminants behind the valves. This results in excessive carbon build up over time, hindering performance. Some engines (like Toyota&#x27;s Dynamic Force engines) combine direct injection with traditional multi port fuel injection to ameliorate this problem.
# More expensive - much higher pressure fuel pumps are required to inject the fuel directly into the cylinder. This requires fuel pressures of up to 200 bar, much greater than a traditional multiport injection setup (see direct injection)

<text>A community network is a computer-based system that is intended to help support (usually geographical) communities by supporting, augmenting, and extending already existing social networks, by using networking technologies by, and for, a community.

Free-nets and civic networks indicate roughly the same range of online projects and services, usually focused on bulletin board systems and online information, but sometimes also providing a means of network access directly to the Internet or other networks; whereas community technology centers (CTCs) and telecentres generally indicate a physical facility to compensate for lack of access to information and communication technologies (ICTs).

==Function==
Community networks often provide web space, e-mail, and other services for free, without advertising. VillageSoup launched a distinct form of community networking in 1997. This form uses display ads and informational postings from fee-paying business and organization members to generate revenue critical to the support of professional journalists producing news for the community.

Community network organizations often engage in training and other services and sometimes are involved in policy work. The Seattle Community Network is a prominent example.

When one looks at the entries of community network directories or the papers and Web sites whose titles and names include &quot;community network&quot; or &quot;community networking&quot;, it is noticeable that a variety of practices exist. This diversity can be seen in the types of information and services offered, who operates the network, and the area covered.

The most extensive array of information services in a community network includes news from professional and amateur reporters, news and information from businesses and organizations; community events listings; weather forecasts; listings of governmental offices, businesses and organizations; and galleries of images of the place. Services include requesting alerts and RSS feeds; making reservations; searching for goods and services; purchasing images and auction items; and posting personal and commercial advertisements. A printed periodic publication is sometimes a service of the community network.

Some community networks limit themselves to functions such as facilitating communication among non-profit organizations.

Internet-based volunteer networks of blogs and groups have been formed in the internet social-networking field as well. The Alabama Charity Network, for example, provided another place for people to connect to fundraisers and charity information using internet-based social networking.

The entities in charge of planning and operating the community networks may be government offices, chambers of commerce, public libraries, non-profit organizations, for-profit entities or volunteer groups.
The primary goals of a community network may include providing a sustainable, trusted platform for an urban neighborhood, suburban village or exurban town or region to enhance a vital community and functioning democracy; closing of the digital divide across socio-economic lines; offering easier access to already existing information and services; promotion of local economic development and employment; strengthening of local identity; and/or revitalization, promotion, and/or maintenance of local communal ties.

The area identified with a community network could be a town, city, county, metropolitan neighborhood, state, and occasionally a region.

==Examples==
Though Community Memory existed in Berkeley, California in the 1970s and private bulletin board systems that welcomed the general public flourished during the late 1970s through the early 1990s, &quot;community networking&quot; as an intentional goal became popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Among the early systems were Big Sky Telegraph (Montana, USA) in 1988; Cleveland Free-Net (Ohio, USA) in 1986 and its similar free-nets in following years; the Public Electronic Network (PEN) in Santa Monica, California (USA) in 1989; and De Digital Stad (DDS) (nl) in Amsterdam (The Netherlands) in 1994.

Redbricks Intranet Collective (RIC) is a community network started in Manchester, UK in 1998.

<text>UFO were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. They became a transitional group between early hard rock and heavy metal and the new wave of British heavy metal. The band&#x27;s final lineup consisted of vocalist Phil Mogg, lead guitarist Vinnie Moore, rhythm guitarist and keyboardist Neil Carter, bass guitarist Rob De Luca, and drummer Andy Parker. They had gone through several line-up changes, leaving Mogg as the only constant member, and had disbanded three times (first between April 1983 and October 1984, second from 1989 to 1991 and third in 2024). The band&#x27;s classic line-up comprised Mogg, Parker, bassist Pete Way, keyboardist Paul Raymond and former Scorpions guitarist Michael Schenker. In May 2018, Mogg announced that he would retire from UFO after one last tour as a member of the band in 2019; however, their farewell tour was set to conclude in 2022 before it was cancelled, due to Mogg&#x27;s health issues. Mogg confirmed UFO&#x27;s third disbandment in April 2024.

Over a career spanning five decades, UFO had released 23 studio albums (including one album of cover songs), 14 live albums and 16 compilation albums. They achieved moderate success in the late 1970s and early 1980s with several albums and singles (including their 1979 live album &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;) in the UK and US Top 40 charts, and have sold over 20 million records worldwide. Some of their most-recognised songs include &quot;Doctor Doctor&quot;, &quot;Rock Bottom&quot;, &quot;Natural Thing&quot;, &quot;Lights Out&quot;, &quot;Too Hot to Handle&quot; and &quot;Only You Can Rock Me&quot;. UFO are considered one of the greatest classic hard rock acts, and often cited as one of the key influences on the 1980s and 1990s hard rock and heavy metal scenes. The band were ranked number 84 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;.

==History==
===Beginning (1968–1972)===

Lead singer Phil Mogg, guitarist Mick Bolton, bassist Pete Way and drummer Andy Parker formed the band in 1968. Originally calling themselves Hocus Pocus, the group changed their name to UFO. They signed to the Beacon Records label, headed by Antiguan-born Milton Samuel. Their first album, &quot;UFO 1&quot;, released in 1970, is a typical example of early hard rock; it includes a heavy version of the Eddie Cochran classic &quot;C&#x27;mon Everybody&quot;. Neither their first nor their second album, &quot;UFO 2: Flying&quot;, reached the charts, but the song &quot;Boogie For George&quot; from the first album reached No. 30 on the German singles chart, and &quot;Prince Kajuku&quot; from &quot;Flying&quot; reached No. 26. At this time UFO attracted little interest in Britain and America. Some of their early work was strongly influenced by space rock (their second album, featuring a 26-minute title track and a 19-minute-long track &quot;Star Storm&quot;, was subtitled &quot;One Hour Space Rock&quot;) that was modestly popular at the time, but the band soon realised the style was somewhat limited. They released the &quot;Live&quot; album, recorded at a concert in Tokyo, at the end of 1971. Mick Bolton left the group in January 1972 after arguments with Mogg and Parker, and UFO set out to find a guitarist who could provide the band with a more standard rock sound.

===International success (1973–1978)===
After brief trial runs with guitarists Larry Wallis (February–October 1972) and Bernie Marsden (who toured with UFO in Europe and recorded a pair of demos, &quot;Oh My&quot; and &quot;Sixteen&quot;) the band recruited Michael Schenker from the Scorpions in June 1973. Schenker was only 18 but already a well-respected guitarist. On a new label, Chrysalis Records, the revamped UFO recorded a non-LP single in 1973, &quot;Give Her the Gun&quot; and &quot;Sweet Little Thing&quot;, with producer Derek Lawrence. In 1974, under producer Leo Lyons (formerly of Ten Years After), UFO recorded &quot;Phenomenon&quot;, which highlighted the band&#x27;s harder-edged guitar sound. &quot;Phenomenon&quot; contains many fan favourites such as &quot;Doctor Doctor&quot; (later a minor hit single as a live track) and &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; (which was extended live to provide a showcase for Schenker). By the time of the &quot;Phenomenon&quot; tour, ex-Skid Row guitarist Paul &quot;Tonka&quot; Chapman joined the group, but he left in January 1975 to form Lone Star.

Two subsequent albums, &quot;Force It&quot; (July 1975) and &quot;No Heavy Petting&quot; (May 1976; recorded with ex-Heavy Metal Kids&#x27; Danny Peyronel, who served as a regular keyboardist as well as harmony vocalist and songwriter), and extensive touring brought UFO increased visibility with American audiences and increased their following in the UK. The song &quot;Belladonna&quot; from &quot;No Heavy Petting&quot; was popular in the USSR, owing to a cover version by Alexander Barykin.

In July 1976, the band recruited keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Paul Raymond from Savoy Brown to make 1977&#x27;s &quot;Lights Out&quot;. The album&#x27;s highlights include the songs &quot;Too Hot to Handle&quot;, &quot;Lights Out&quot;, and the seven-minute opus &quot;Love to Love&quot; among others. With &quot;Lights Out&quot;, the band received substantial critical acclaim, and the album saw them playing at arenas and theaters across the United States and Europe, opening for bands like Rush and AC/DC. With their new-found success, the band went back into the studio to record their next album &quot;Obsession&quot; (1978). While &quot;Obsession&quot; was not as successful as &quot;Lights Out&quot;, the band still maintained their arena status while touring for the album, playing with AC/DC and Rush again, and other bands like Blue Öyster Cult, Styx, Foghat, Jethro Tull, REO Speedwagon and Molly Hatchet; as part of the &quot;Obsession&quot; tour, UFO recorded the live album, &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;, which was released in January 1979. &quot;Strangers&quot; was a critical and commercial success, reaching Number 7 in the UK Albums Chart in February 1979, and a tour to support the live album followed, playing with bands like AC/DC, Kiss, Cheap Trick, Journey, Thin Lizzy, Nazareth and Judas Priest, and appearing at the California World Music Festival with Aerosmith, Van Halen, Toto and April Wine.

===Post-Schenker era and breaks (1978–1990)===
Tensions grew between Mogg and Schenker in the late 1970s, possibly owing to Schenker often leaving before or during shows. Soon after UFO&#x27;s show at the Keystone Palo Alto, on 29 October 1978, Schenker left the band. &quot;Obviously we were disappointed,&quot; recalled Pete Way. &quot;It&#x27;s not easy to promote an album without a guitarist. We were starting to draw a lot of people and the album was selling. But he&#x27;d also disappeared on the &quot;Lights Out&quot; tour, so nothing surprised us.&quot;

Schenker briefly returned to the Scorpions before forming his own Michael Schenker Group.

After Schenker&#x27;s exit, UFO rehired guitarist Paul Chapman, who brought unused track ideas from Lone Star&#x27;s drummer Dixie Lee. The band&#x27;s next LP – &quot;No Place to Run&quot;, released in January 1980 – was produced by former Beatles producer George Martin. It failed to match the success of its predecessors, though it fractionally missed the UK Top 10.

Paul Raymond left at the end of the &quot;No Place To Run&quot; tour. He was replaced by John Sloman from Lone Star on keyboards for a couple of months, then by former Wild Horses guitarist and keyboardist Neil Carter, who helped fill the void in the songwriting left by Schenker&#x27;s departure. Carter debuted with UFO on stage at the three-day Reading Festival on 23 August 1980, when the band played as the Saturday night headliner. 

At the beginning of the following year, UFO released the self-produced &quot;The Wild, the Willing and the Innocent&quot;, which had a lighter, contemporary pop rock sound. The album achieved mild success in the UK, reaching the UK Top 20, and the single &quot;Lonely Heart&quot; was released.

In February 1982, the band released &quot;Mechanix&quot;. It was successful in the UK, where it reached No. 8, the band&#x27;s highest ever placing. Later that year, founding member Pete Way left the band to form Fastway with Motörhead guitarist &quot;Fast&quot; Eddie Clarke and then his own band, Waysted. He was replaced by Talas bassist Billy Sheehan. UFO released &quot;Making Contact&quot; in 1983, but the album was a critical and commercial failure. Thus, that March, UFO decided to disband. The band played a UK farewell tour with Paul Gray (former bassist with Eddie and the Hot Rods and the Damned). However, there was a hint that this might not be permanent when UFO released a compilation album featuring songs by UFO (as well as other groups featuring ex-members of UFO) entitled &quot;Headstone&quot;, the sleeve of which showed a headstone, denoting UFO with their formation date but an incomplete end date.

This proved to be a short break; just short of two years later, in late 1984, Mogg assembled a new UFO line-up, featuring Paul Gray on bass again, ex-Diamond Head drummer Robbie France (replaced in 1985 by former Magnum drummer Jim Simpson), and Atomik Tommy M (Tommy McClendon), a former roadie who also wrote lyrics for Loudness, on guitar, with Paul Raymond rejoining shortly afterward, and released &quot;Misdemeanor&quot;. Raymond left again in 1986 and was replaced by David Jacobson, who along with Gray would leave in 1987, and Pete Way rejoined on bass. Before Gray&#x27;s departure, the band recorded the EP &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&quot; which was released in 1988. Despite the renewed activity of the band, neither release was financially successful and they officially disbanded again in 1989 after a string of guitarists replacing McClendon: Myke Gray of Jagged Edge in late 1987, former Starfighters guitarist Rik Sandford and Tony Glidewell in 1988, and finally in 1989 future Cold Sweat guitarist Erik Gamans.

===Reunion(s) (1991–2003)===
In 1991, Mogg and Way decided to put a new UFO line-up together with former Wild Horses members Clive Edwards on drums, Laurence Archer on guitar, and keyboardist Jem Davis joining the band and they released &quot;High Stakes &amp; Dangerous Men&quot;. While only released on a small independent label, &quot;High Stakes&quot; was enough to generate serious interest in a full-blown reunion. The following year, the classic late-1970s UFO line-up – Mogg, Schenker, Way, Raymond and Parker – reunited, and the resulting album was &quot;Walk on Water&quot; (1995). This line-up (barring Parker&#x27;s replacement by AC/DC&#x27;s Simon Wright on drums) went on a world tour. However, tensions arose again, and Schenker left the band only four shows into the tour, walking off stage mid-set in the very venue, the Keystone Palo Alto, where their October 1978 tour died. Thereafter, the other members again went their separate ways. However, Schenker returned to the fold in 1998, and the band embarked on another tour, with Parker again replaced by a new drummer. They played at the Astoria, Charing Cross Road, London in 1998.

Mogg and Way continued working together throughout this fluctuating band membership, releasing two albums under the Mogg/Way name in the late 1990s, &quot;Edge of the World&quot; and &quot;Chocolate Box&quot;.

In 2000, Schenker rejoined UFO again and the band released the double CD &quot;Covenant&quot; (with Aynsley Dunbar on drums), which contained a disc of new material and a disc of live classics. In 2002, the band recorded &quot;Sharks&quot;; shortly after &quot;Sharks&quot; was released, Schenker left the band yet again and was replaced with Vinnie Moore. and the official announcement was made in July 2003. In 2003, Michael Schenker and Pete Way released &quot;The Plot&quot; with drummer Jeff Martin.

===Vinnie Moore-era and return to chart success (2004–2017)===
In 2004, UFO released their 17th studio album &quot;You Are Here&quot; with their new permanent guitarist Vinnie Moore and Jason Bonham on drums (intermittently). UFO recorded their live set and released a double-DVD recording titled &quot;Showtime&quot; (2005) along with a double live CD on SPV in November 2005, mixing a number of re-recorded studio songs. In November 2005, Andy Parker returned to the band to play in the &quot;Piorno Rock Festival&quot; in Granada, Spain. UFO&#x27;s eighteenth studio album, titled &quot;The Monkey Puzzle&quot;, was released in 2006.

Andy Parker returned in early 2007, after recovering from leg surgery. On the 2008 tour, Pete Way was unable to get a work visa to enter the United States, Rob De Luca (Sebastian Bach&#x27;s band, Of Earth, Spread Eagle) filling in.

UFO released their 19th studio album, &quot;The Visitor&quot;, in June 2009, and followed with a tour of the UK, but without Pete Way, who was suffering from a medical condition. Bass tracks on &quot;The Visitor&quot; were played by Peter Pichl, and Pete Way was not credited as a band member on &quot;The Visitor&quot; cover, nor was any other bassist. However, the album saw UFO&#x27;s return to the UK Albums Chart for the first time in almost 15 years.

In July 2009, UFO released a six-CD live concert box set, containing recordings of six concerts between 1975 and 1982, as well as previously unreleased live songs.

On their 2011 tour, they were accompanied by Barry Sparks playing bass.

By December 2010, UFO had been working on a twentieth studio album, which was supposed to be released in June 2011. Titled &quot;Seven Deadly&quot;, was released on 27 February 2012, with Lars Lehmann on bass, to almost universally good reviews and a higher chart position than The Visitor also charting in Germany, Sweden, and the Billboard indie charts.

In 2011, former band members Danny Peyronel, Laurence Archer, and Clive Edwards teamed up with bassist Rocky Newton (ex-McAuley Schenker Group) to form a band entitled X-UFO. In live performances, X-UFO played sets of vintage UFO songs, later renamed House Of X to perform their own material. Their eponymous album was released on 24 October 2014.

In 2013, Paul Raymond revealed that a new UFO album was in the works, but there was &quot;no detailed talk of that yet.&quot; The album, titled &quot;A Conspiracy of Stars&quot;, was released on 23 February 2015.

On 10 September 2016, guitarist Vinnie Moore announced on Facebook that UFO were in the studio recording a covers album. The album, titled &quot;The Salentino Cuts&quot;, was released on 29 September 2017.

===50th anniversary tour and retirement (2018–present)===
In May 2018, vocalist Mogg announced that UFO&#x27;s 50th anniversary tour in 2019 would be his last one as the frontman of the band, who may also either split up or move on with a replacement for him. Mogg explained, &quot;This decision has been a long time coming. I&#x27;ve considered stepping down at the end of UFO&#x27;s previous two tours. I don&#x27;t want to call this a farewell tour as I hate that word, but next year&#x27;s gigs will represent my final tap-dancing appearances with the band.&quot; He added that &quot;the timing feels right&quot; for him to quit, and that &quot;there will be a final tour of the U.K. and we will also play some shows in selected other cities that the band has a strong connection with. But outside of the U.K. this won&#x27;t be a long tour.&quot; Despite earlier reports that Mogg had intended to leave the band in 2019, the band planned to resume their touring activities in 2022, which had been pushed back from a year earlier due to the COVID-19 pandemic. UFO&#x27;s last-ever show was intended to take place on 29 October 2022 in Athens, Greece, where the band performed its first show with current guitarist Vinnie Moore 18 years earlier. However, the show was cancelled.

Longtime keyboardist and guitarist Paul Raymond died from a heart attack on 13 April 2019 at the age of 73. Two weeks later, it was announced that Raymond&#x27;s initial replacement Neil Carter would be rejoining UFO for the remainder of the band&#x27;s final tour. Former guitarist Paul Chapman died on his 66th birthday on 9 June 2020. Chapman was followed two months later by original bassist Pete Way, who died from accident injuries at the age of 69.

In late August 2022, Mogg suffered a heart attack. On 1 September 2022 doctors pronounced a strict performance ban for Mogg, after having performed several detailed examinations in the previous days. This resulted in the farewell tour, which was set to occur across Europe in October 2022, being cancelled.

When asked in April 2024 by &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; about the future of UFO, Mogg said, &quot;I think it&#x27;s come to a conclusion. We did that last U.K. tour in 2019, just before COVID. So that was kind of the end of it and the time was right.&quot;

<text>The  (UQAM; ), is a French-language public research university based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is the largest constituent element of the system.

UQAM was founded on April 9, 1969, by the government of Quebec, through the merger of the , a fine arts school; the , a classical college; and a number of smaller schools. Although part of the UQ network, UQAM possesses a relative independence which allows it to choose its rector.

In the fall of 2018, the university welcomed some 40,738 students, including 3,859 international students from 95 countries, in a total of 310 distinct programs of study, managed by six faculties (Arts, Education, Communication, Political Science and Law, Science and Social science) and one school (Management). It offers Bachelors, Masters, and Doctoral degrees. It is one of Montreal&#x27;s two French-language universities, along with the , and only 1% of its student population is of English-speaking origin.

==History==
UQAM was created on April 9, 1969, by the Government of Quebec, following the merger of the École des beaux-arts de Montréal, the Collège Sainte-Marie and three colleges.

In mid 1970, construction on UQAM&#x27;s campus began in the Saint-Jacques neighbourhood. The old Saint-Jacques Cathedral was condemned and the worshipers were moved to the Chapel of Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes. The architect of the university, Dimitri Dimakopoulos, chose to respect the plans of John Ostell and Victor Bourgeau by deciding to graft the new construction around the wall of the nave of the church overlooking Saint Catherine Street and highlighting the bell tower and its gateway. These remains are classified as historic monuments by the Quebec government. The new campus of UQAM was inaugurated in September 1979.

Before the arrival of the Université du Québec à Montréal, access to higher education was limited for the French-speaking working classes. Thanks to the policy of admitting adults with relevant professional experience, the student population was able to broaden the student population to include social categories previously excluded from higher education, thus creating a climate of openness.

UQAM is the first Canadian university where faculty unionism is developing. The Université du Québec professors&#x27; union, which has been affiliated since its birth in 1970 with the Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN), has participated in the effort to democratize the functioning of university authorities.

In November 2006, UQAM underwent a major financial crisis. It was revealed that the former president, Roch Denis, was partially responsible for the financial mismanagement of the Science Complex and the Ilot Voyageur real estate projects. A recovery plan, required by the Ministry of Education, Sport and Leisure, is still in progress, raising significant challenges from groups of employees, students, lecturers and professors.

With the addition of the Télé-université in June 2005, UQAM, with a student population of close to 60,000, was the largest French-speaking university in the world. On 13 January 2012, it was announced that the TELUQ would again become a separate university from UQAM, but would remain in the Université du Québec system.

==Campus==

UQAM&#x27;s campus was designed by Dimitri Dimakopoulos and is located in downtown Montreal in the borough of Ville-Marie, with most of its buildings in the Quartier Latin neighbourhood near the Berri-UQAM Metro station and the newer Complexe des sciences Pierre-Dansereau near Place des Arts. The university is also involved in the troubled Îlot Voyageur project, a 13-storey student residence and intercity bus terminal, but has had to scale back its involvement due to financial problems. In September 2013, the university announced that it had acquired the National Film Board of Canada&#x27;s former CineRobotheque facility for its communications faculty.

The university provides training on its campus in Montreal and its four regional centres: UQAM Lanaudière in Terrebonne, UQAM Laval, UQAM Montérégie in Longueuil and UQAM Ouest-de-l&#x27;île.

A three part virtual exhibition was made to showcase the university&#x27;s history.

==Finances==
A commissioned report by PricewaterhouseCoopers has called for cost-cutting measures at UQAM to help the university out of a financial crisis, brought on by $100 million in construction cost overruns for its sciences centre and costs for Îlot Voyageur, which soared from $226 million to more than $400 million when the Quebec government pulled out of the project, citing unauthorized design changes. The Quebec government has said that unless UQAM cuts costs, the university&#x27;s total project-related debt could be $500 million by 2012.
The Îlot Voyageur has been bought back by the government of Quebec in November 2010, thus solving a painful financial problem for UQAM.

<text>A toucan crossing is the British term for a type of pedestrian crossing that also allows bicycles to be ridden across. Since &quot;two can&quot; cross together (both pedestrians and cyclists) the name “toucan” was chosen. In the United Kingdom toucan crossings are normally four metres (13 feet) wide, instead of the 2.8 metre (9 feet) width of any pelican crossing or puffin crossing.

There are two types of toucan crossing: on more recently installed ones, a &quot;green bicycle&quot; is displayed next to the &quot;green man&quot; when cyclists and pedestrians are permitted to cross. A red bicycle and red man are shown at other times; older crossings do not have a red bicycle – bicycles are permitted to cross at any time (if it is safe to do so).

Unlike the pelican crossing, before the lights for vehicles go back to green, a steady red and amber are displayed instead of the flashing amber. The pedestrian/cyclist signal lights may be on the near side of the crossing (like a puffin crossing), or on the opposite side of the road (like a pelican crossing). A related crossing type is the pegasus crossing for horse riders.

<text>Milton Byron Babbitt (May 10, 1916 – January 29, 2011) was an American composer, music theorist, mathematician, and teacher. He was a Pulitzer Prize and MacArthur Fellowship recipient, recognized for his serial and electronic music.

==Biography==
Babbitt was born in Philadelphia to Albert E. Babbitt and Sarah Potamkin, who were Jewish. He was raised in Jackson, Mississippi, and began studying the violin when he was four but soon switched to clarinet and saxophone. Early in his life he was attracted to jazz and theater music, and &quot;played in every pit-orchestra that came to town&quot;. Babbitt was making his own arrangements of popular songs by age 7, &quot;wrote a lot of pop tunes for school productions&quot;, and won a local songwriting contest when he was 13. A Jackson newspaper called Babbitt a &quot;whiz kid&quot; and noted &quot;that he had perfect pitch and could add up his family&#x27;s grocery bills in his head. In his teens he became a great fan of jazz cornet player Bix Beiderbecke&quot;.

Babbitt&#x27;s father was a mathematician, and Babbitt intended to study mathematics when he entered the University of Pennsylvania in 1931. But he soon transferred to New York University, where he studied music with Philip James and Marion Bauer. There he became interested in the music of the composers of the Second Viennese School and wrote articles on twelve-tone music, including the first description of combinatoriality and a serial &quot;time-point&quot; technique. Babbitt was a pioneer in integral serialism, organizing dynamics and rhythms to pitch serialism. He also emphasized the importance of composers pursuing composition in a research perspective rather than focusing on societal approval. After receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree from New York University College of Arts &amp; Science in 1935 with Phi Beta Kappa honors, he studied under Roger Sessions, first privately and then at Princeton University. He joined Princeton&#x27;s music faculty in 1938 and received one of Princeton&#x27;s first Master of Fine Arts degrees in 1942. During the Second World War, Babbitt divided his time between mathematical research in Washington, D.C. and Princeton, where he was a member of the mathematics faculty from 1943 to 1945.

In 1948, Babbitt returned to Princeton&#x27;s music faculty and in 1973 he joined the faculty of the Juilliard School. Among his more notable students are music theorists David Lewin and John Rahn, composers Bruce Adolphe, Michael Dellaira, Kenneth Fuchs, Laura Karpman, Paul Lansky, Donald Martino, John Melby, Kenneth Lampl, Tobias Picker, and James K. Randall, the theater composer Stephen Sondheim, composers and pianists Frederic Rzewski and Richard Aaker Trythall, and the jazz guitarist and composer Stanley Jordan.

In 1958, Babbitt achieved unsought notoriety through an article in the popular magazine &quot;High Fidelity&quot;. His title for the article was originally &quot;The Composer as Specialist&quot; (as it was later published several times) but, he said, &quot;The editor, without my knowledge and—therefore—my consent or assent, replaced my title by the more &#x27;provocative&#x27; one: &#x27;Who Cares if You Listen?&#x27;, a title which reflects little of the letter and nothing of the spirit of the article&quot;. In 1991, Babbitt said of the article&#x27;s lasting notoriety, &quot;For all that the true source of that offensively vulgar title has been revealed many times, in many ways, even—eventually—by the offending journal itself, I still am far more likely to be known as the author of &#x27;Who Cares if You Listen?&#x27; than as the composer of music to which you may or may not care to listen&quot;. In 2006, Babbitt told the &quot;Princeton Alumni Weekly&quot;, &quot;Now obviously, I care very deeply if you listen [...] if nobody listens and nobody cares, you&#x27;re not going to be writing music for very long&quot;.

Around 1960, Babbitt became interested in electronic music. RCA hired him as consultant composer to work with its RCA Mark II Synthesizer at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center (known since 1996 as the Columbia University Computer Music Center). In 1960, Babbitt was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in music composition. In 1961, he wrote &quot;Composition for Synthesizer&quot;, marking the beginning of a second period in his output. Babbitt was less interested in producing new timbres than in the rhythmic precision he could achieve with the synthesizer, a degree of precision previously unobtainable in performance. 

Through the 1960s and 1970s, Babbitt wrote both electronic music and music for conventional musical instruments, often combining the two. &quot;Philomel&quot; (1964), for example, is for soprano and a synthesized accompaniment (including the recorded and manipulated voice of Bethany Beardslee, for whom the piece was composed) stored on magnetic tape.

By the end of the 1970s, Babbitt was beginning his third creative period by shifting his focus away from electronic music, the genre that first gained for him public notice. Babbitt&#x27;s compositions are typically considered atonal, but it has also been shown that, especially in his third-period music, notes from his serial structures (all-partition arrays and superarrays) are sometimes arranged and coordinated to forge tonal chords, cadential phrases, simulated tonal voice-leading, and other tonal allusions, allowing for double meaning (serial and tonal), like many of his composition titles. This phenomenon of &quot;double meaning&quot; of notes (pitches) in the context of his double-meaning titles has been called &quot;portmantonality&quot;.

From 1985 until his death, Babbitt served as the Chairman of the BMI Student Composer Awards, the international competition for young classical composers. A resident of Princeton, New Jersey, he died there on January 29, 2011, aged 94.

Filmmaker Robert Hilferty&#x27;s &quot;Babbitt: Portrait of a Serial Composer&quot; broadly depicts Babbitt&#x27;s thinking, attitudes about his past and then-current work in footage largely from 1991–1992. The film was not completed and fully edited until 2010, and was presented on NPR online upon Babbitt&#x27;s death.

<text>The Université du Québec () is a system of ten provincially-run public universities in Quebec, Canada. Its headquarters are in Quebec City. The university coordinates 1400 programs for over 100,000 students. The government of Quebec founded the Université du Québec, a network of universities in several Quebec cities. In a similar fashion to other Canadian provinces, all universities in Quebec have since become public.

==History==
The Université du Québec system was established in 1968 by the National Assembly of Quebec largely in response to widespread student protests that had broken out in the autumn of that year. In an effort to extend education to more Quebecois students, the government had created a system of CEGEPs to create a facilitated pathway into university. However, Quebec did not have enough French-language universities to accommodate the new influx of students applying after completing CEGEP. Only 40% of CEGEP graduates could be accommodated by existing Francophone universities, and job prospects were poor for students who only had a certificate from a CEGEP. As a result, student protests began to spread across the province, with 23 CEGEPs, the Université de Montréal, and Université Laval being occupied by student protesters. Thousands of Francophone students took to the streets in protest, as others barricaded themselves inside their CEGEPs, refusing to leave until their demands were met.

Although the students&#x27; demands were often not met and individual protests proved largely unsuccessful, they had captured the attention of Quebec&#x27;s legislators. Partially as a result of this upheaval, Quebec&#x27;s government decided to pass a resolution which would create a new network of Francophone universities across the province of Quebec. With the province in the midst of the Quiet Revolution, secularism was becoming pertinent to Quebec society and to a new generation of youth who rejected Catholic domination over Quebecois society, and alternatives to the traditional, existing religious institutions were demanded. Five universities were established in 1969 and 1970 to assuage the influx of CEGEP students, and they were placed in cities across the province to allow equal educational opportunities in areas where access to higher education had traditionally been limited, such as Rimouski and Abitibi. In the 1970s, a sixth university would be added to the network, the Université du Québec en Outaouais in Gatineau. This network of universities was modeled on the American university systems that already existed at that time.

The component institutions are:

*the École de technologie supérieure (ETS), in Montreal;
*the École nationale d&#x27;administration publique (ENAP), based in Quebec City, with campuses in Montreal, Gatineau, Trois-Rivières, and Saguenay;
*the Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS), based in Quebec City and a campus in Montreal;
*the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi (UQAC), in Saguenay;
*the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), in Montreal;
*the Université du Québec à Rimouski (UQAR), in Rimouski;
*the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières (UQTR), in Trois-Rivières;
*the Université du Québec en Abitibi-Témiscamingue (UQAT), with campuses in Rouyn-Noranda, Val-d&#x27;Or, and other towns;
*the Université du Québec en Outaouais (UQO), in Gatineau with a campus in Saint-Jérôme.
*the Université TÉLUQ, distance education based in Quebec city

<doc id="158771" wikidata="Q2716810" url="?curid=158771" title="Force It">
<text>Force It is the fourth studio album by English rock band UFO, released in 1975. It was their first album to chart in the United States.

The album was produced by Ten Years After bass player Leo Lyons. Another Ten Years After member, Chick Churchill, played Fender Rhodes electric piano keyboard, the first use of that instrument on a UFO record.

The CD reissue was remastered at Sound Recording Technology in Cambridge in 1994.

==Album cover==
The somewhat controversial original album cover was designed by Hipgnosis, as were almost all other UFO album covers of the 1970s. The nudity on the cover verged on breaching decency standards and the sexes of the couple in the bathtub were not known for several years. The models were later revealed to be Genesis P-Orridge and Cosey Fanni Tutti, both later of the influential industrial band Throbbing Gristle. The artwork was softened for the initial US release, making the couple in the bathtub transparent. The cover is a pun – there are multiple taps (British English) or &quot;faucets&quot; (US English) in the picture, which is a play on the album&#x27;s title.

== Critical reception ==
Reviewing the LP in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;Heavy metal that&#x27;s not hard to take? What? Well, the whole first side moves to [sic] smartly you could almost mistake it for rock and roll.&quot; Eduardo Rivadavia, reviewer for AllMusic, wrote: &quot;One of the band&#x27;s best albums, Force It will not disappoint lovers of &#x27;70s English hard rock.&quot;

<doc id="158772" wikidata="Q485619" url="?curid=158772" title="Hanja">
<text>Hanja (; ), alternatively spelled Hancha, are Chinese characters used to write the Korean language. After characters were introduced to Korea to write Literary Chinese, they were adapted to write Korean as early as the Gojoseon period.

 () refers to Sino-Korean vocabulary, which can be written with Hanja, and () refers to Classical Chinese writing, although &quot;Hanja&quot; is also sometimes used to encompass both concepts. Because Hanja characters have never undergone any major reforms, they more closely resemble traditional Chinese and traditional Japanese characters, although the stroke orders for certain characters are slightly different. Such examples are the characters and , as well as and . Only a small number of Hanja characters were modified or are unique to Korean, with the rest being identical to the traditional Chinese characters. By contrast, many of the Chinese characters currently in use in mainland China, Malaysia and Singapore have been simplified, and contain fewer strokes than the corresponding Hanja characters.

Until the contemporary period, Korean documents, history, literature and records were written primarily in Literary Chinese using Hanja as its primary script. As early as 1446, King Sejong the Great promulgated Hangul (also known as Chosŏn&#x27;gŭl in North Korea) through the &quot;Hunminjeongeum.&quot; It did not come into widespread official use until the late 19th and early 20th century. Proficiency in Chinese characters is, therefore, necessary to study Korean history. Etymology of Sino-Korean words are reflected in Hanja.

Hanja were once used to write native Korean words, in a variety of systems collectively known as &quot;idu&quot;, but by the 20th century Koreans used hanja only for writing Sino-Korean words, while writing native vocabulary and loanwords from other languages in Hangul, a system known as mixed script. By the 21st century, even Sino-Korean words are usually written in the Hangul alphabet, with the corresponding Chinese character sometimes written next to it to prevent confusion if there are other characters or words with the same Hangul spelling. According to the &quot;Standard Korean Language Dictionary&quot; published by the National Institute of Korean Language (NIKL), approximately half (50%) of Korean words are Sino-Korean, mostly in academic fields (science, government, and society). Other dictionaries, such as the &quot;Urimal Keun Sajeon&quot;, claim this number might be as low as roughly 30%.

==History==
===Introduction of literary Chinese to Korea===
There is traditionally no accepted date for when literary Chinese () written in Chinese characters () entered Korea. Early Chinese dynastic histories, the only sources for very early Korea, do not mention a Korean writing system. During the 3rd century BC, Chinese migrations into the peninsula occurred due to war in northern China and the earliest archaeological evidence of Chinese writing appearing in Korea is dated to this period. A large number of inscribed knife money from pre-Lelang sites along the Yalu River have been found. A sword dated to 222 BC with Chinese engraving was unearthed in Pyongyang.

From 108 BC to 313 AD, the Han dynasty established the Four Commanderies of Han in northern Korea and institutionalized the Chinese language. According to the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, Goguryeo had &#x27; from the beginning of its existence, which starts in 37 BC. It also says that the king of Goguryeo composed a poem in 17 BC. The Gwanggaeto Stele, dated to 414, is the earliest securely dated relic bearing &#x27; inscriptions. &#x27; became commonplace in Goguryeo during the 5th and 6th centuries and according to the &quot;Book of Zhou&quot;, the Chinese classics were available in Goguryeo by the end of the 6th century. The &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; mentions written records in Baekje beginning in 375 and Goguryeo annals prior to 600. Japanese chronicles mention Baekje people as teachers of &#x27;. According to the &quot;Book of Liang&quot;, the people of Silla did not have writing in the first half of the 6th century but this may have been only referring to agreements and contracts, represented by notches on wood. The &quot;Bei Shi&quot;, covering the period 386–618, says that the writing, armour, and weapons in Silla were the same as those in China. The &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; says that records were kept in Silla starting in 545.

Some western writers claimed that knowledge of Chinese entered Korea with the spread of Buddhism, which occurred around the 4th century. Traditionally Buddhism is believed to have been introduced to Goguryeo in 372, Baekje in 384, and Silla in 527.

Another major factor in the adoption of &#x27; was the adoption of the , copied from the Chinese imperial examination, open to all freeborn men. Special schools were set up for the well-to-do and the nobility across Korea to train new scholar officials for civil service. Adopted by Silla and Goryeo, the &#x27; system was maintained by Goryeo until after the unification of Korea at the end of the nineteenth century. The scholarly elite began learning the &quot;hanja&quot; by memorising the &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot; (), &quot;Three Character Classic&quot; () and &quot;Hundred Family Surnames&quot; (). Passage of the &quot;&quot; required the thorough ability to read, interpret and compose passages of works such as the &quot;Analects&quot; (), &quot;Great Learning&quot; (), &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot; (), &quot;Mencius&quot; (), &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; (), &quot;Book of Documents&quot; (), &quot;Classic of Changes&quot; (), &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot; () and &quot;Book of Rites&quot; (). Other important works include &quot;the Art of War&quot; (), &quot;Selections of Refined Literature&quot; (), etc.

The Korean scholars were very proficient in literary Chinese. The craftsmen and scholars of Baekje were renowned in Japan, and were eagerly sought as teachers due to their proficiency in &#x27;. Korean scholars also composed all diplomatic records, government records, scientific writings, religious literature and much poetry in &#x27;, demonstrating that the Korean scholars were not just reading Chinese works but were actively composing their own. Well-known examples of Chinese-language literature in Korea include &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, &quot;Geumo Sinhwa&quot;, &quot;The Cloud Dream of the Nine&quot;, &quot;Akhak gwebeom&quot;, &quot;Hong Gildong jeon&quot; and &quot;Domundaejak&quot;.

===Adaptation of &quot;hanja&quot; to Korean===
The Chinese language, however, was quite different from the Korean language, consisting of terse, often monosyllabic words with a strictly analytic, SVO structure in stark contrast to the generally polysyllabic, very synthetic, SOV structure, with various grammatical endings that encoded person, levels of politeness and case found in Korean. Despite the adoption of literary Chinese as the written language, Chinese never replaced Korean as the spoken language, even amongst the scholars that had immersed themselves into its study.

The first attempts to make literary Chinese texts more accessible to Korean readers were &quot;&quot; passages written in Korean word order. This would later develop into the &quot;gugyeol&quot; () or &#x27;separated phrases,&#x27; system. Chinese texts were broken into meaningful blocks, and in the spaces were inserted &quot;hanja&quot; used to represent the sound of native Korean grammatical endings. As literary Chinese was very terse, leaving much to be understood from context, insertion of occasional verbs and grammatical markers helped to clarify the meaning. For instance, the &quot;hanja&quot; &quot; was used for its native Korean gloss whereas &quot; was used for its Sino-Korean pronunciation, and combined into &quot; and read (), &#x27;to do (and so).&#x27; In Chinese, however, the same characters are read in Mandarin as the expression , meaning &#x27;becoming a nun&#x27;. This is a typical example of Gugyeol words where the radical &quot; is read in Korean for its meaning (—&#x27;to do&#x27;), whereas the suffix &quot;, (meaning &#x27;nun&#x27;), is used phonetical. Special symbols were sometimes used to aid in the reordering of words in approximation of Korean grammar. It was similar to the () system developed in Japan to render Chinese texts. The system was not a translation of Chinese into Korean, but an attempt to make Korean speakers knowledgeable in &quot;hanja&quot; overcome the difficulties in interpreting Chinese texts. Although it was developed by scholars of the early Goryeo Kingdom (918–1392), was of particular importance during the Joseon period, extending into the first decade of the twentieth century, since all civil servants were required to be able to read, translate and interpret Confucian texts and commentaries.
The first attempt at transcribing Korean in &quot;hanja&quot; was the &quot;idu&quot; (), or &#x27;official reading,&#x27; system that began to appear after 500 AD. In this system, the &quot;hanja&quot; were chosen for their equivalent native Korean gloss. For example, the &quot;hanja&quot; &quot; signifies &#x27;no winter&#x27; or &#x27;not winter&#x27; and has the formal Sino-Korean pronunciation of &quot; , similar to Mandarin . Instead, it was read as &quot; which is the Middle Korean pronunciation of the characters&#x27; native gloss and is ancestor to modern &quot;, &#x27;do not&#x27; or &#x27;does not.&#x27; The various conventions were developed in the Goryeo period but were particularly associated with the &quot;jung-in&quot; (), the upper middle class of the early Joseon period.

A subset of &#x27; was known as &quot;hyangchal&quot; (), &#x27;village notes,&#x27; and was a form of &#x27; particularly associated with the &quot;hyangga&quot; () the old poetry compilations and some new creations preserved in the first half of the Goryeo period when its popularity began to wane. In the or &#x27;village letters&#x27; system, there was free choice in how a particular &quot;hanja&quot; was used. For example, to indicate the topic of Princess Seonhwa, a daughter of King Jinpyeong of Silla was recorded as &quot; in &quot;&quot; and was read as (), &quot;seonhwa gongju-nim-eun&quot; where &quot; is read in Sino-Korean, as it is a Sino-Korean name and the Sino-Korean term for &#x27;princess&#x27; was already adopted as a loan word. The &quot;hanja&quot; &#x27;,&#x27; however, were read according to their native pronunciation but was not used for its literal meaning signifying &#x27;the prince steals&#x27; but to the native postpositions &quot; , the honorific marker used after professions and titles, and &quot; , the topic marker. In mixed script, this would be rendered as &quot;.

Hanja were the sole means of writing Korean until King Sejong the Great invented and tried promoting Hangul in the 15th century. Even after the invention of Hangul, however, most Korean scholars continued to write in &#x27;, although Hangul did see considerable popular use. &#x27; and its &#x27; variant were mostly replaced by mixed-script writing with &quot;hangul&quot; although &#x27; was not officially discontinued until 1894 when reforms abolished its usage in administrative records of civil servants. Even with &quot;&quot;, most literature and official records were still recorded in literary Chinese until 1910.

=== Decline of Hanja ===

The Hangul-Hanja mixed script was a commonly used means of writing, and Hangul effectively replaced Hanja in official and scholarly writing only in the 20th century. Hangŭl exclusive writing has been used concurrently in Korea after the decline of literary Chinese. Mixed script could be commonly found in non-fiction writing, news papers, etc., until the enacting of President Park Chung Hee&#x27;s 5 Year Plan for Hangul Exclusivity () in 1968 banned the use and teaching of Hanja in public schools, as well as forbade its use in the military, with the goal of eliminating Hanja in writing by 1972 through legislative and executive means. However, due to public backlash, in 1972, Park&#x27;s government allowed for the teaching of Hanja in special classes but maintained a ban on Hanja use in textbooks and other learning materials outside of the classes. This reverse step, however, was optional so the availability of Hanja education was dependent on the school one went to.

Another reason for the decline is found in the Hangul typewriter, and the keyboard. The push for better Hangul typewriters mainly began in 1949, but as it was long before the Hanja ban, government institutions did not prefer typewriters altogether as they could not write in Hanja nor Mixed script. Kong Byung Wo&#x27;s notable &quot;Sebeolsik&quot; type first appeared in March 1949, jointly winning second place in the &quot;Joseon Balmyong Jangryohoe&quot;&#x27;s () Hangul type contest, and Kim Dong Hoon&#x27;s typewriter winning joint 3rd. During the 50s and 60s, alongside the Korean government&#x27;s support for typewriting, new Hangul typewriters were developed, distributed, and adopted. Hangul type with both horizontal writing and &quot;moa-sseugi&quot; (모아쓰기; the style of Hangul where Hangul consonants and vowels mix in together to form a full letter, which is the default style being used today) first appeared in the same period as government policy. With further adoption, during the 1970s, even when Hanja and mixed script were still used widely in society both as a writing system and as a style option, Koreans mostly gave up on mixed script at least in government documents and memorandums; The use of Hanja in type hindered the speed of writing and printing compared to only-Hangul usage, especially after the advent of the &quot;Sebeolsik layout&quot; ().

Park&#x27;s Hanja ban was not formally lifted until 1992 under the government of Kim Young-sam. In 1999, the government of Kim Dae-jung actively promoted Hanja by placing it on signs on the road, at bus stops, and in subways. In 1999, Han Mun was reintroduced as a school elective and in 2001 the Hanja Proficiency Test () was introduced. In 2005, an older law, the Law Concerning Hangul Exclusivity () was repealed as well. In 2013 all elementary schools in Seoul started teaching Hanja. However, the result is that Koreans who were educated in this period having never been formally educated in Hanja are unable to use them, and thus the use of Hanja has plummeted in orthography until the modern day. Where Hanja is now very rarely used and is almost only used for abbreviations in newspaper headlines (e.g. for China, for Korea, for the United States, for Japan, etc.), for clarification in text where a word might be confused for another due to homophones (e.g. () vs. ()), or for stylistic use such as the () used on Shin Ramyŏn packaging.

Since June 1949, Hanja has not officially been used in North Korea, and, in addition, most texts are now commonly written horizontally instead of vertically. Many words borrowed from Chinese have also been replaced in the North with native Korean words, due to the North&#x27;s policy of linguistic purism. Nevertheless, a large number of Chinese-borrowed words are still widely used in the North (although written in Hangul), and Hanja still appear in special contexts, such as recent North Korean dictionaries. The replacement has been less total in South Korea where, although usage has declined over time, some Hanja remain in common usage in some contexts.

==Character formation==
Each Hanja is composed of one of 214 radicals plus in most cases one or more additional elements. The vast majority of Hanja use the additional elements to indicate the sound of the character, but a few Hanja are purely pictographic, and some were formed in other ways.

The historical use of Hanja in Korea has had a change over time. Hanja became prominent in use by the elite class between the 3rd and 4th centuries by the Three Kingdoms. The use came from Chinese that migrated into Korea. With them they brought the writing system Hanja. Thus the hanja being used came from the characters already being used by the Chinese at the time.

Since Hanja was primarily used by the elite and scholars, it was hard for others to learn, thus much character development was limited. Scholars in the 4th century used this to study and write Confucian classics. Character formation is also coined to the form which was a Buddhist writing system for Chinese characters. This practice however was limited due to the opinion of Buddhism whether it was favorable at the time or not.

==&quot;Eumhun&quot;==
To aid in understanding the meaning of a character, or to describe it orally to distinguish it from other characters with the same pronunciation, character dictionaries and school textbooks refer to each character with a combination of its sound and a word indicating its meaning. This dual meaning-sound reading of a character is called (; from &#x27;sound&#x27; + &#x27;meaning,&#x27; &#x27;teaching&#x27;).

The word or words used to denote the meaning are often—though hardly always—words of native Korean (i.e., non-Chinese) origin, and are sometimes archaic words no longer commonly used.

==Education==
===South===
South Korean primary schools ceased the teaching of Hanja in elementary schools in the 1970s, although they are still taught as part of the mandatory curriculum in grade 6. They are taught in separate courses in South Korean high schools, separately from the normal Korean-language curriculum. Formal Hanja education begins in grade 7 (junior high school) and continues until graduation from senior high school in grade 12.

A total of 1,800 Hanja are taught: 900 for junior high, and 900 for senior high (starting in grade 10). Post-secondary Hanja education continues in some liberal-arts universities. The 1972 promulgation of basic Hanja for educational purposes changed on December 31, 2000, to replace 44 Hanja with 44 others.

South Korea&#x27;s Ministry of Education generally encourages all primary schools to offer Hanja classes. Officials said that learning Chinese characters could enhance students&#x27; Korean-language proficiency. Initially announced as a mandatory requirement, it is now considered optional.

===North===
Though North Korea rapidly abandoned the general use of Hanja soon after independence, the number of Hanja taught in primary and secondary schools is actually greater than the 1,800 taught in South Korea. Kim Il Sung had earlier called for a gradual elimination of the use of Hanja, but by the 1960s, he had reversed his stance; he was quoted as saying in 1966, &quot;While we should use as few Sinitic terms as possible, students must be exposed to the necessary Chinese characters and taught how to write them.&quot;

As a result, a Chinese-character textbook was designed for North Korean schools for use in grades 5–9, teaching 1,500 characters, with another 500 for high school students. College students are exposed to another 1,000, bringing the total to 3,000.

==Uses==
Because many different Hanja—and thus, many different words written using Hanja—often share the same sounds, two distinct Hanja words () may be spelled identically in the phonetic Hangul alphabet. Hanja&#x27;s language of origin, Chinese, has many homophones, and Hanja words became even more homophonic when they came into Korean, since Korean lacks a tonal system, which is how Chinese distinguishes many words that would otherwise be homophonic. For example, while , , and are all phonetically distinct in Mandarin (pronounced , , and respectively), they are all pronounced () in Korean. For this reason, Hanja are often used to clarify meaning, either on their own without the equivalent Hangul spelling or in parentheses after the Hangul spelling as a kind of gloss. Hanja are often also used as a form of shorthand in newspaper headlines, advertisements, and on signs, for example the banner at the funeral for the sailors lost in the sinking of ROKS Cheonan (PCC-772).

===Print media===

In South Korea, Hanja are used most frequently in ancient literature, legal documents, and scholarly monographs, where they often appear without the equivalent Hangul spelling. Usually, only those words with a specialized or ambiguous meaning are printed in Hanja. In mass-circulation books and magazines, Hanja are generally used rarely, and only to gloss words already spelled in Hangul when the meaning is ambiguous. Hanja are also often used in newspaper headlines as abbreviations or to eliminate ambiguity.

In formal publications, personal names are also usually glossed in Hanja in parentheses next to the Hangul. Aside from academic usage, Hanja are often used for advertising or decorative purposes in South Korea, and appear frequently in athletic events and cultural parades, packaging and labeling, dictionaries and atlases. For example, the Hanja ( or , meaning &#x27;spicy&#x27;) appears prominently on packages of Shin Ramyun noodles. In contrast, North Korea eliminated the use of Hanja even in academic publications by 1949 on the orders of Kim Il Sung, a situation that has since remained unchanged. 
===Dictionaries===
In modern Korean dictionaries, all entry words of Sino-Korean origin are printed in Hangul and listed in Hangul order, with the Hanja given in parentheses immediately following the entry word.

This practice helps to eliminate ambiguity, and it also serves as a sort of shorthand etymology, since the meaning of the Hanja and the fact that the word is composed of Hanja often help to illustrate the word&#x27;s origin.

As an example of how Hanja can help to clear up ambiguity, many homophones can be distinguished by using Hanja. An example is the word (), which may have meanings such as:

# : spiritual discipline
# : prisoner
# : &#x27;city of water&#x27; (e.g. Venice or Suzhou)
# : paddy rice
# : drain, rivers, path of surface water
# : tunnel
# : capital (city)
# : hand knife

Hanja dictionaries for specialist usage – () or () – are organized by radical (the traditional Chinese method of classifying characters).

===Personal names===
Korean personal names, including all Korean surnames and most Korean given names, are based on Hanja and are generally written in it, although some exceptions exist. On business cards, the use of Hanja is slowly fading away, with most older people displaying their names exclusively in Hanja while most of the younger generation using both Hangul and Hanja. Korean personal names usually consist of a one-character family name (, ) followed by a two-character given name (, ). There are a few two-character family names (e.g. , ), and the holders of such names—but not only them—tend to have one-syllable given names. Traditionally, the given name in turn consists of one character unique to the individual and one character shared by all people in a family of the same sex and generation (see Generation name).

During the Japanese administration of Korea (1910–1945), Koreans were forced to adopt Japanese-style names, including polysyllabic readings of the Hanja, but this practice was reversed by post-independence governments in Korea. Since the 1970s, some parents have given their children given names that are simply native Korean words. Popular ones include ()—meaning &#x27;sky&#x27;—and ()—meaning &#x27;morning dew&#x27;. Nevertheless, on official documents, people&#x27;s names are still recorded in both Hangul and in Hanja.

===Toponymy===
Due to standardization efforts during Goryeo and Joseon eras, native Korean placenames were converted to Hanja, and most names used today are Hanja-based. The most notable exception is the name of the capital, Seoul, a native Korean word meaning &#x27;capital&#x27; with no direct Hanja conversion; the Hanja () is sometimes used as a back-rendering. For example, disyllabic names of railway lines, freeways, and provinces are often formed by taking one character from each of the two locales&#x27; names; thus,
* The Gyeongbu () corridor connects Seoul (&quot;&quot;, ) and Busan (, );
* The Gyeongin () corridor connects Seoul and Incheon (, );
* The former Jeolla () Province took its name from the first characters in the city names Jeonju () and Naju () (&quot;Naju&quot; is originally &quot;Raju&quot;, but the initial &quot;r/l&quot; sound in South Korean is simplified to &quot;n&quot;).

Most atlases of Korea today are published in two versions: one in Hangul (sometimes with some English as well), and one in Hanja. Subway and railway station signs give the station&#x27;s name in Hangul, Hanja, and English, both to assist visitors (including Chinese or Japanese who may rely on the Hanja spellings) and to disambiguate the name.

===Academia===

Hanja are still required for certain disciplines in academia, such as Oriental Studies and other disciplines studying Chinese, Japanese or historic Korean literature and culture, since the vast majority of primary source text material are written in Hanzi, Kanji or Hanja.

===Art and culture===
For the traditional creative arts such as calligraphy and painting, a knowledge of Hanja is needed to write and understand the various scripts and inscriptions, as is the same in China and Japan. Many old songs and poems are written and based on Hanja characters.

On 9 September 2003, the celebration for the 55th anniversary of North Korea featured a float decorated with the scenario for welcoming Kim Il Sung, which including a banner with Kim Il Sung&#x27;s name written in Hanja.

===Popular usage===
Opinion surveys in South Korea regarding the issue of Hanja use have had mixed responses in the past. Hanja terms are also expressed through Hangul, the standard script in the Korean language. Hanja use within general Korean literature has declined since the 1980s because formal Hanja education in South Korea does not begin until the seventh year of schooling, due to changes in government policy during the time.

In 1956, one study found mixed-script Korean text (in which Sino-Korean nouns are written using Hanja, and other words using Hangul) were read faster than texts written purely in Hangul; however, by 1977, the situation had reversed. In 1988, 65% of one sample of people without a college education &quot;evinced no reading comprehension of any but the most common hanja&quot; when reading mixed-script passages.
==Gukja==

A small number of characters were invented by the Koreans themselves. These characters are called (). Most of them are for proper names (place-names and people&#x27;s names) but some refer to Korean-specific concepts and materials. They include (; ; &#x27;paddy field&#x27;), (; , &#x27;wardrobe&#x27;), (; , a character only used in given names), (; , a rare surname from Seongju), and (; , an old name referring to Kumgangsan).

Further examples include ( ), ( ), ( ), ( ), and ( ). See Korean gukja characters at Wiktionary for more examples.

Compare to the parallel development in Japan of , of which there are hundreds, many are rarely used. These were often developed for native Japanese plants and animals.

===Yakja===
Some Hanja characters have simplified forms () that can be seen in casual use. An example is , which is a cursive form of (meaning &#x27;nothing&#x27;).
==Pronunciation==
Each Hanja character is pronounced as a single syllable, corresponding to a single composite character in Hangul. The pronunciation of Hanja in Korean is by no means identical to the way they are pronounced in modern Chinese, particularly Mandarin, although some Chinese dialects and Korean share similar pronunciations for some characters. For example, &quot;print&quot; is in Mandarin Chinese and () in Korean, but it is pronounced in Shanghainese (a Wu Chinese dialect).

One difference is the loss of tone from standard Korean while most Chinese dialects retain tone. In other aspects, the pronunciation of Hanja is more conservative than most northern and central Chinese dialects, for example in the retention of labial consonant codas in characters with labial consonant onsets, such as the characters ( ) and ( ); labial codas existed in Middle Chinese but do not survive intact in most northern and central Chinese varieties today, and even in many southern Chinese varieties that still retain labial codas, including Cantonese and Hokkien, labial codas in characters with labial onsets are replaced by their dental counterparts.

Due to divergence in pronunciation since the time of borrowing, sometimes the pronunciation of a Hanja and its corresponding hanzi may differ considerably. For example, (&#x27;woman&#x27;) is in Mandarin Chinese and () in Korean. However, in most modern Korean dialects (especially South Korean ones), is pronounced as () when used in an initial position, due to a systematic elision of initial &quot;n&quot; when followed by &quot;y&quot; or &quot;i&quot;. Additionally, sometimes a Hanja-derived word will have altered pronunciation of a character to reflect Korean pronunciation shifts, for example, &#x27;quince&#x27; from , and &#x27;Paeonia suffruticosa&#x27; from .

There are some pronunciation correspondence between the onset, rhyme, and coda between Cantonese and Korean.

When learning how to write Hanja, students are taught to memorize the native Korean pronunciation for the Hanja&#x27;s meaning and the Sino-Korean pronunciations (the pronunciation based on the Chinese pronunciation of the characters) for each Hanja respectively so that students know what the syllable and meaning is for a particular Hanja. For example, the name for the Hanja is () in which () is the native Korean pronunciation for &#x27;water&#x27;, while () is the Sino-Korean pronunciation of the character. The naming of Hanja is similar to if &quot;water&quot;, &quot;horse&quot; and &quot;gold&quot; were named &quot;water-aqua&quot;, &quot;horse-equus&quot;, or &quot;gold-aurum&quot; based on a hybridization of both the English and the Latin names. Other examples include () for &#x27;person/people&#x27;, () for &#x27;big/large/great&#x27;, () for &#x27;small/little&#x27;, () for &#x27;underneath/below/low&#x27;, () for &#x27;father&#x27;, and () for &#x27;Han/Korea&#x27;.

<doc id="158773" wikidata="Q332717" url="?curid=158773" title="Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies">
<text>Ferdinand II (; ; ; 12 January 1810 – 22 May 1859) was King of the Two Sicilies from 1830 until his death in 1859.

==Family==
Ferdinand was born in Palermo to King Francis I of the Two Sicilies and his second wife Maria Isabella of Spain. His paternal grandparents were King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Queen Maria Carolina of Austria. His maternal grandparents were Charles IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma. Ferdinand I and Charles IV were brothers, both sons of Charles III of Spain and Maria Amalia of Saxony. His sister was Teresa Cristina of the Two Sicilies, Empress of Brazil, wife of the last Brazilian emperor Pedro II.

==Early reign==
In his early years, he was fairly popular. Progressives credited him with Liberal ideas and, in addition, his free and easy manners endeared him to the so-called &quot;lazzaroni&quot;, the lower classes of Neapolitan society.

On succeeding to the throne in 1830, he published an edict in which he promised to give his most anxious attention to the impartial administration of justice, to reform the finances, and to use every effort to heal the wounds which had afflicted the Kingdom for so many years. His goal, he said, was to govern his Kingdom in a way that would bring the greatest happiness to the greatest number of his subjects while respecting the rights of his fellow monarchs and those of the Roman Catholic Church.

The early years of his reign were comparatively peaceful: he cut taxes and expenditures, had the first railway in Italy built (between Naples and the royal palace at Portici), his fleet had the first steamship in the Italian Peninsula and he had telegraphic connections established between Naples and Palermo, Sicily.

However, in 1837, he violently suppressed Sicilian demonstrators demanding a constitution and maintained strict police surveillance in his domains. Liberal reformists, who were motivated by visions of a new society founded upon a modern constitution, continued to demand that the King grant a constitution and liberalize his rule.

==Revolutions of 1848==

In September 1847, violent riots inspired by Liberals broke out in Reggio Calabria and in Messina, which were put down by the military. On 12 January 1848 a rising in Palermo spread throughout the island and served as a spark for the Revolutions of 1848 all over Europe.

After similar revolutionary outbursts in Salerno, south of Naples, and in the Cilento region which were backed by the majority of the intelligentsia of the Kingdom, on 29 January 1848 King Ferdinand was forced to grant a constitution, using for a pattern the French Charter of 1830.

However a dispute arose as to the nature of the oath which should be taken by the members of the chamber of deputies. As an agreement could not be reached and the King refused to compromise, riots continued in the streets. Eventually, the King ordered the army to disperse the rioters by force and dissolved the national parliament on 13 March 1849. Although the constitution was never formally abrogated, the King resumed his rule as an absolute monarch.

During this period, Ferdinand showed his attachment to Pope Pius IX by granting him asylum at Gaeta. The Pope had been temporarily forced to flee from Rome following similar revolutionary disturbances.

In the meantime, Sicily declared independence under the leadership of Ruggero Settimo, who on 13 April 1848 pronounced the King deposed. In response, the King assembled an army of 20,000 men under the command of General Carlo Filangieri and dispatched it to Sicily. A naval flotilla sent to Sicilian waters bombarded the city of Messina with &quot;savage barbarity&quot; for eight hours after its defenders had already surrendered, killing many civilians and earning the King the nickname &quot;re bomba&quot; (&quot;The Bomb King&quot;).

After a campaign lasting close to nine months, Sicily&#x27;s Liberal regime was completely subdued on 15 May 1849.

==Later reign==
Between 1848 and 1851, the policies of King Ferdinand caused many to go into exile. Meanwhile, an estimated 2,000 suspected revolutionaries or dissidents were jailed.

After visiting Naples on private business in 1850, William Gladstone the British former government minister and future prime minister, began to support Neapolitan opponents of the Bourbon rulers: his &quot;support&quot; consisted of a couple of letters that he sent from Naples to Parliament in London, describing the &quot;awful conditions&quot; of the Kingdom of Southern Italy and claiming that &quot;it is the negation of God erected into a system of government&quot;. Gladstone&#x27;s letters provoked reactions of outrage in much of Europe and helped to cause the kingdom&#x27;s diplomatic isolation, which facilitated its subsequent invasion and annexation by the Savoyard Kingdom of Sardinia, and the foundation of modern unified Italy in 1861.

The British government, which had been the ally and protector of the Bourbon dynasty during the Napoleonic Wars, had already additional interests in limiting the independence of the kingdom. It had extensive business interests in Sicily and relied on Sicilian sulphur for certain industries. The King had endeavoured to limit British influence, which had begun to cause tension. As Ferdinand ignored the advice of the British and French governments, those powers recalled their ambassadors in 1856.

A soldier attempted to assassinate Ferdinand in 1856, and many believe that the infection he received from the soldier&#x27;s bayonet led to his ultimate demise. He died on 22 May 1859, shortly after the Second French Empire and the Kingdom of Sardinia had declared war against the Austrian Empire. This would later lead to the invasion of his Kingdom by Giuseppe Garibaldi and Italian unification in 1861.

<text>No Heavy Petting is the fifth studio album by English rock band UFO, released in 1976. It is the first UFO album to feature a full-time keyboard player as a member of the band, making this their first record as a five-piece band. While keyboardist Danny Peyronel only stayed in the band for this one album, he did co-write several tracks on the record.

In 1994, a CD including this album and &quot;Lights Out&quot; was released by BGO Records. Like many CDs in the UFO catalogue, it was remastered and reissued with bonus tracks in 2007.

&quot;No Heavy Petting&quot; was a rule posted in many public baths in England during the 1970s and 1980s.

==Track listing==


All previously unreleased studio tracks were recorded at Morgan Studios in January 1976 except &quot;All or Nothing&quot; on September 15, 1975 and mixed at Abbey Road Studios in June 2007.

<text>Q-switching, sometimes known as giant pulse formation or Q-spoiling, is a technique by which a laser can be made to produce a pulsed output beam. The technique allows the production of light pulses with extremely high (gigawatt) peak power, much higher than would be produced by the same laser if it were operating in a continuous wave (constant output) mode. Compared to modelocking, another technique for pulse generation with lasers, Q-switching leads to much lower pulse repetition rates, much higher pulse energies, and much longer pulse durations. The two techniques are sometimes applied together.

Q-switching was first proposed in 1958 by Gordon Gould, and independently discovered and demonstrated in 1961 or 1962 by R.W. Hellwarth and F.J. McClung at Hughes Research Laboratories using electrically switched Kerr cell shutters in a ruby laser. Optical nonlinearities such as Q-switching were fully explained by Nicolaas Bloembergen, who won the Nobel Prize in 1981 for this work.

==Principle of Q-switching==
Q-switching is achieved by putting some type of variable attenuator inside the laser&#x27;s optical resonator. When the attenuator is functioning, light which leaves the gain medium does not return, and lasing cannot begin. This attenuation inside the cavity corresponds to a decrease in the &quot;Q factor&quot; or &quot;quality factor&quot; of the optical resonator. A high Q factor corresponds to low resonator losses per roundtrip, and vice versa. The variable attenuator is commonly called a &quot;Q-switch&quot;, when used for this purpose.

Initially the laser medium is pumped while the Q-switch is set to prevent feedback of light into the gain medium (producing an optical resonator with low Q). This produces a population inversion, but laser operation cannot yet occur since there is no feedback from the resonator. Since the rate of stimulated emission is dependent on the amount of light entering the medium, the amount of energy stored in the gain medium increases as the medium is pumped. Due to losses from spontaneous emission and other processes, after a certain time the stored energy will reach some maximum level; the medium is said to be &quot;gain saturated&quot;. At this point, the Q-switch device is quickly changed from low to high Q, allowing feedback and the process of optical amplification by stimulated emission to begin. Because of the large amount of energy already stored in the gain medium, the intensity of light in the laser resonator builds up very quickly; this also causes the energy stored in the medium to be depleted almost as quickly. The net result is a short pulse of light output from the laser, known as a &quot;giant pulse&quot;, which may have a very high peak intensity.

There are two main types of Q-switching:

===Active Q-switching===
Here, the Q-switch is an externally controlled variable attenuator. This may be a mechanical device such as a shutter, chopper wheel, or spinning mirror/prism placed inside the cavity, or (more commonly) it may be some form of modulator such as an acousto–optic device, a magneto-optic effect device or an electro-optic device a Pockels cell or Kerr cell. The reduction of losses (increase of Q) is triggered by an external event, typically an electrical signal. The pulse repetition rate can therefore be externally controlled. Modulators generally allow a faster transition from low to high Q, and provide better control. An additional advantage of modulators is that the rejected light may be coupled out of the cavity and can be used for something else. Alternatively, when the modulator is in its low-Q state, an externally generated beam can be coupled &quot;into&quot; the cavity through the modulator. This can be used to &quot;seed&quot; the cavity with a beam that has desired characteristics (such as transverse mode or wavelength). When the Q is raised, lasing builds up from the initial seed, producing a Q-switched pulse that has characteristics inherited from the seed.

===Passive Q-switching===
In this case, the Q-switch is a saturable absorber, a material whose transmission increases when the intensity of light exceeds some threshold. The material may be an ion-doped crystal like Cr:YAG, which is used for Q-switching of Nd:YAG lasers, a bleachable dye, or a passive semiconductor device. Initially, the loss of the absorber is high, but still low enough to permit some lasing once a large amount of energy is stored in the gain medium. As the laser power increases, it saturates the absorber, i.e., rapidly reduces the resonator loss, so that the power can increase even faster. Ideally, this brings the absorber into a state with low losses to allow efficient extraction of the stored energy by the laser pulse. After the pulse, the absorber recovers to its high-loss state before the gain recovers, so that the next pulse is delayed until the energy in the gain medium is fully replenished. The pulse repetition rate can only indirectly be controlled, e.g. by varying the laser&#x27;s pump power and the amount of saturable absorber in the cavity. Direct control of the repetition rate can be achieved by using a pulsed pump source as well as passive Q-switching.

===Variants===
Jitter can be reduced by not reducing the Q by as much, so that a small amount of light can still circulate in the cavity. This provides a &quot;seed&quot; of light that can aid in the buildup of the next Q-switched pulse.

With cavity dumping, the cavity end mirrors are 100% reflective, so that no output beam is produced when the Q is high. Instead, the Q-switch is used to &quot;dump&quot; the beam out of the cavity after a time delay. The cavity Q goes from low to high to start the laser buildup, and then goes from high to low to &quot;dump&quot; the beam from the cavity all at once. This produces a shorter output pulse than regular Q-switching. Electro-optic modulators are normally used for this, since they can easily be made to function as a near-perfect beam &quot;switch&quot; to couple the beam out of the cavity. The modulator that dumps the beam may be the same modulator that Q-switches the cavity, or a second (possibly identical) modulator. A dumped cavity is more complicated to align than simple Q-switching, and may need a control loop to choose the best time at which to dump the beam from the cavity.

In regenerative amplification, an optical amplifier is placed inside a Q-switched cavity. Pulses of light from another laser (the &quot;master oscillator&quot;) are injected into the cavity by lowering the Q to allow the pulse to enter and then increasing the Q to confine the pulse to the cavity where it can be amplified by repeated passes through the gain medium. The pulse is then allowed to leave the cavity via another Q switch.

==Typical performance==
A typical Q-switched laser (e.g. a Nd:YAG laser) with a resonator length of e.g. 10 cm can produce light pulses of several tens of nanoseconds duration. Even when the average power is well below 1 W, the peak power can be many kilowatts. Large-scale laser systems can produce Q-switched pulses with energies of many joules and peak powers in the gigawatt region. On the other hand, passively Q-switched microchip lasers (with very short resonators) have generated pulses with durations far below one nanosecond and pulse repetition rates from hundreds of hertz to several megahertz (MHz)

==Applications==
Q-switched lasers are often used in applications which demand high laser intensities in nanosecond pulses, such as metal cutting or pulsed holography. Nonlinear optics often takes advantage of the high peak powers of these lasers, offering applications such as 3D optical data storage and 3D microfabrication. However, Q-switched lasers can also be used for measurement purposes, such as for distance measurements (range finding) by measuring the time it takes for the pulse to get to some target and the reflected light to get back to the sender. It can be also used in chemical dynamic study, e.g. temperature jump relaxation study.

Q-switched lasers are also used to remove tattoos by shattering ink pigments into particles that are cleared by the body&#x27;s lymphatic system. Full removal can take between six and twenty treatments depending on the amount and colour of ink, spaced at least a month apart, using different wavelengths for different coloured inks. Nd:YAG lasers are currently the most favoured lasers due to their high peak powers, high repetition rates and relatively low costs. In 2013 a picosecond laser was introduced based on clinical research which appears to show better clearance with difficult-to-remove colours such as green and light blue. Q-switched lasers can also be used to remove dark spots and fix other skin pigmentation issues.

<doc id="158780" wikidata="Q8510" url="?curid=158780" title="Helmand River">
<text>The Helmand river (Pashto/Dari: ; Ancient Greek: Ἐτύμανδρος, &quot;Etýmandros&quot;; Latin: &#x27;), also spelledHelmend, orHelmund,Hirmand, is the longest river in Afghanistan and the primary watershed for the endorheic Sistan Basin. It originates in the Sanglakh Range of the Hindu Kush mountains in the northeastern part of Maidan Wardak Province, where it is separated from the watershed of the Kabul River by the Unai Pass. The Helmand feeds into the Hamun Lake on the border of Afghanistan and Iran.

== Etymology ==
The name comes from the Avestan &quot;Haētumant&quot;, literally &quot;dammed, having a dam&quot;, which referred to the Helmand River and the irrigated areas around it. The word Haetumant is cognate with Sanskrit Setumatī meaning &quot;one which has a dam.&quot;

== Geography ==

The Helmand stretches for . It rises in the northeastern part of Maidan Wardak Province in the Hindu Kush mountains, about 40 km west of Kabul (), flowing southwestward through Daykundi Province and Uruzgan Province. After passing through the city of Lashkargah in Helmand Province, it enters the desert of Dasht-e Margo, and then flows to the Sistan marshes and the Hamun-i-Helmand lake region around Zabol at the Afghan-Iranian border (). A few smaller rivers such as Tarnak and Arghandab flow into Helmand.

This river, managed by the Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority, is used extensively for irrigation, although a buildup of mineral salts has decreased its usefulness in watering crops. For much of its length, the Helmand is free of salt. Its waters are essential for farmers in Afghanistan, but it feeds into the Hamun Lake and is also important to farmers in Iran&#x27;s southeastern Sistan and Baluchistan province.

A number of hydroelectric dams have created artificial reservoirs on some of the Afghanistan&#x27;s rivers including the Kajaki Dam on the Helmand River. The chief tributary of the Helmand river, the Arghandab River (confluence at ), also has a major dam, north of Kandahar.

==History==
The Helmand valley region is mentioned by name in the Avesta (&quot;Fargard&quot; 1:13) as the Aryan land of &quot;Haetumant&quot;, one of the early centres of the Zoroastrian faith in areas that are now Afghanistan. However, by the late first millennium BC and early first millennium AD, the preponderance of communities of Hindus and Buddhists in the Helmand and Kabul valleys led to Parthians referring to it as India. From 1758 to 1842, the Helmand formed the northern borders of the Brahui Khanate of Kalat.

<text>Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27; is a musical revue with a book by Murray Horwitz and Richard Maltby Jr., and music by various composers and lyricists as arranged and orchestrated by Luther Henderson. It is named after the song by Fats Waller (with Harry Brooks and Andy Razaf), &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;&quot;.

The musical is a tribute to the music of Fats Waller. It was a time when Manhattan nightclubs such as the Cotton Club and the Savoy Ballroom were the playgrounds of high society and Lenox Avenue dives were filled with piano players banging out the new beat known as swing. Five performers present an evening of rowdy, raunchy, and humorous songs that encapsulate the various moods of the era and reflect Waller&#x27;s view of life as a journey meant for pleasure and play.

==Productions==
&quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&quot; opened in the Manhattan Theatre Club&#x27;s East 73rd Street cabaret on February 8, 1978. The cast included Irene Cara, Nell Carter, André DeShields, Armelia McQueen, and Ken Page and was staged by Arthur Faria, now recognized as one of the original authors, stage managed by David Rosenak, and directed by Maltby. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer wrote: &quot;The show moves with the zing and sparkle of a Waller recording-filled with bright melodies and asides.&quot; Its reception was such that it was decided to develop it into a full-scale production.

The musical opened on Broadway at the Longacre Theatre on May 9, 1978, and transferred to the Plymouth Theatre and then to the Belasco Theatre and closed on February 21, 1982, after 1,604 performances and fourteen previews. Maltby was the director, with musical staging and choreography by Arthur Faria. The original cast featured Nell Carter, André DeShields, Armelia McQueen, Ken Page, and Charlayne Woodard. Luther Henderson, who adapted Waller&#x27;s music for the revue, appeared as the production&#x27;s original pianist. Replacements later in the run included Debbie Allen, Yvette Freeman, Adriane Lenox, and Alan Weeks. An original cast recording was released by RCA Victor.

The London West End production opened on March 22, 1979, at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre. DeShields and Woodard were joined by Evan Bell, Annie Joe Edwards, and Jozella Reed. It was revived in London in 1995 at the Tricycle Theatre and then the Lyric Theatre, with Debby Bishop, Dawn Hope, Melanie Marshall, Sean Palmer, and Ray Shell. A London revival cast recording was released by First Night.

On June 21, 1982, NBC broadcast the revue with the original Broadway cast.

A Broadway revival with the same director, choreographer, and cast as the original 1978 production opened on August 15, 1988, at the Ambassador Theatre, where it ran for 176 performances and eight previews. Frank Rich, in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote &quot;In their scrupulous re-creation of the Fats Waller show that first electrified Broadway a decade ago, the original cast and creators have conjured the same between-the-wars dream world as before... Though almost bereft of dialogue, this musical anthology expands beyond its form to become a resurrection of a great black artist&#x27;s soul. Perhaps the key to the musical&#x27;s approach, as conceived by the director Richard Maltby Jr., is its willingness to let Waller speak simply and eloquently for himself, through his art but without show-biz embroidery.&quot;

In 1995, a national tour directed and choreographed by Faria starred the Pointer Sisters, Eugene Barry-Hill, and Michael-Leon Wooley. Although it never reached Broadway as originally planned, a recording of highlights from the show was released by RCA.

Beginning in November 2008 and lasting until at least May 2009, season two &quot;American Idol&quot; contestants Frenchie Davis, Trenyce Cobbins and winner Ruben Studdard starred in the 30th anniversary national tour of the show.

<text>Obsession is the seventh studio album by English rock band UFO, released in 1978. This was the final studio album to feature Michael Schenker on lead guitar until he returned to the band in 1993. A single from the album, &quot;Only You Can Rock Me&quot; / &quot;Cherry&quot;, was also released in 1978. So too was the band&#x27;s first three-track EP &quot;Only You Can Rock Me&quot;, &quot;Cherry&quot; / &quot;Rock Bottom&quot;, reaching No. 50 in the UK. The album was recorded at an abandoned post office in Los Angeles.

EMI&#x27;s 2008 remastered edition includes three bonus live tracks, and also some writing credits are corrected. In 2024, Chrysalis released a deluxe edition on 2 CD&#x27;s and 3 LP&#x27;s. It features new remaster as well as an entire live show from Cleveland, remixed in 2024 for this release.

==Critical reception==
Reviewing the LP in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;I&#x27;ve admired their forward motion and facile riffs, so it&#x27;s my duty to report that they&#x27;ve degenerated into the usual exhibitionism. Theme song: &#x27;Lookin&#x27; Out for No. 1,&#x27; a turn of phrase that&#x27;s becoming as much of a watchword in late &#x27;70s rock as &#x27;get together&#x27; was in the late &#x27;60s.&quot;

<doc id="158783" wikidata="Q1964929" url="?curid=158783" title="Napier Sabre">
<text>The Napier Sabre is a British H-24-cylinder, liquid-cooled, sleeve valve, piston aero engine, designed by Major Frank Halford and built by D. Napier &amp; Son during World War II. The engine evolved to become one of the most powerful inline piston aircraft engines in the world, developing from in its earlier versions to in late-model prototypes.

The first operational aircraft to be powered by the Sabre were the Hawker Typhoon and Hawker Tempest; the first aircraft powered by the Sabre was the Napier-Heston Racer, which was designed to capture the world speed record. Other aircraft using the Sabre were early prototype and production variants of the Blackburn Firebrand, the Martin-Baker MB 3 prototype and a Hawker Fury prototype. The rapid introduction of jet engines after the war led to the quick demise of the Sabre, as there was less need for high power military piston aero engines and because Napier turned its attention to developing turboprop engines such as the Naiad and Eland.

==Design and development==
Prior to the Sabre, Napier had been working on large aero engines for some time. Its most famous was the Lion, which had been a very successful engine between the World Wars and in modified form had powered several of the Supermarine Schneider Trophy competitors in 1923 and 1927, as well as several land speed record cars. By the late 1920s, the Lion was no longer competitive and work started on replacements.

Napier followed the Lion with two H-block designs: the H-16 Rapier and the H-24 Dagger. The H-block has a compact layout, consisting of two horizontally opposed engines, one atop or beside the other. Since the cylinders are opposed, the motion in one is balanced by the motion on the opposing side, eliminating both first order and second order vibration. In these new designs, Napier chose air cooling but in service, the rear cylinders proved to be impossible to cool properly, which made the engines unreliable.

===Genesis===

During the 1930s, studies showed the need for engines capable of developing one horsepower per cubic inch of displacement (about 45 kW/litre). Such power output was needed to propel aircraft large enough to carry large fuel loads for long range flights. A typical large engine of the era, the Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 &quot;Twin Wasp&quot;, developed about from 1,830 cubic inches (30 litres), so an advance of some 50 per cent would be needed. This called for radical changes and while many companies tried to build such an engine, none succeeded.

In 1927, Harry Ricardo published a study on the concept of the sleeve valve engine. In it, he wrote that traditional poppet valve engines would be unlikely to produce much more than , a figure that many companies were eyeing for next generation engines. To pass this limit, the sleeve valve would have to be used, to increase volumetric efficiency, as well as to decrease the engine&#x27;s sensitivity to detonation, which was prevalent with the poor quality, low-octane fuels in use at the time. Halford had worked for Ricardo 1919–1922 at its London office and Halford&#x27;s 1923 office was in Ladbroke Grove, North Kensington, only a few miles from Ricardo, while Halford&#x27;s 1929 office was even closer (700 yards), and while in 1927 Ricardo started work with Bristol Engines on a line of sleeve-valve designs, Halford started work with Napier, using the Dagger as the basis. The layout of the H-block, with its inherent balance and the Sabre&#x27;s relatively short stroke, allowed it to run at a higher rate of rotation, to deliver more power from a smaller displacement, provided that good volumetric efficiency could be maintained (with better breathing), which sleeve valves could do.

The Napier company decided first to develop a large 24 cylinder liquid–cooled engine, capable of producing at least in late 1935. Although the company continued with the opposed H layout of the Dagger, this new design positioned the cylinder blocks horizontally and it was to use sleeve valves. All of the accessories were grouped conveniently above and below the cylinder blocks, rather than being at the front and rear of the engine, as in most contemporary designs.

The Air Ministry supported the Sabre programme with a development order in 1937 for two reasons: to provide an alternative engine if the Rolls-Royce Vulture and the Bristol Centaurus failed as the next generation of high power engines and to keep Napier in the aero-engine industry.
The first Sabre engines were ready for testing in January 1938, although they were limited to . By March, they were passing tests at and by June 1940, when the Sabre passed the Air Ministry&#x27;s 100-hour test, the first production versions were delivering from their 2,238 cubic inch (37 litre) displacements. By the end of the year, they were producing . The contemporary 1940 Rolls-Royce Merlin II was generating just over from a 1,647 cubic inch (27 litre) displacement.

===Production===

Problems arose as soon as mass production began. Prototype engines had been hand-assembled by Napier craftsmen and it proved to be difficult to adapt it to assembly-line production techniques. The sleeves often failed due to the way they were manufactured from chrome-molybdenum steel, leading to seized cylinders, which caused the loss of the sole prototype Martin-Baker MB 3. The Ministry of Aircraft Production was responsible for the development of the engine and arranged for sleeves to be machined by the Bristol Aeroplane Company from its Taurus engine forgings. These nitrided austenitic steel sleeves were the result of many years of intensive sleeve development, experience that Napier did not have. Air filters had to be fitted when a new sleeve problem appeared in 1944 when aircraft were operating from Normandy soil with its abrasive, gritty dust.

Quality control proved to be inadequate, engines were often delivered with improperly cleaned castings, broken piston rings and machine cuttings left inside the engine. Mechanics were overworked trying to keep the Sabres running and during cold weather they had to run them every two hours during the night so that the engine oil would not congeal and prevent the engine from starting the next day. These problems took too long to remedy and the engine gained a bad reputation. To make matters worse, mechanics and pilots unfamiliar with the different nature of the engine, tended to blame the Sabre for problems that were caused by not following correct procedures. This was exacerbated by the representatives of the competing Rolls-Royce company, which had its own agenda. In 1944, Rolls-Royce produced a similar design prototype called the Eagle.

Napier seemed complacent and tinkered with the design for better performance. In 1942, it started a series of projects to improve its high-altitude performance, with the addition of a three-speed, two-stage supercharger, when the basic engine was still not running reliably. In December 1942, the company was purchased by the English Electric Company, which ended the supercharger project immediately and devoted the whole company to solving the production problems, which was achieved quickly.

By 1944, the Sabre V was delivering consistently and the reputation of the engine started to improve. This was the last version to enter service, being used in the Hawker Typhoon and its derivative, the Hawker Tempest. Without the advanced supercharger, the engine&#x27;s performance over fell off rapidly and pilots flying Sabre-powered aircraft, were generally instructed to enter combat only below this altitude. At low altitude, both planes were formidable. As air superiority over Continental Europe was slowly gained, Typhoons were increasingly used as fighter-bombers, notably by the RAF Second Tactical Air Force. The Tempest became the principal destroyer of the V-1 flying bomb (Fieseler Fi 103), since it was the fastest of all the Allied fighters at low levels. Later, the Tempest destroyed about 20 Messerschmitt Me 262 jet aircraft.

Development continued and the later Sabre VII delivered with a new supercharger. By the end of World War II, there were several engines in the same power class. The Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major four-row, 28-cylinder radial produced at first and later types produced , but these required almost twice the displacement in order to do so, 4,360 cubic inches (71 litres).

<text>The spatha was a type of straight and long sword, measuring between , with a handle length of between , in use in the territory of the Roman Empire during the 1st to 6th centuries AD. Later swords, from the 7th to 10th centuries, like the Viking swords, are recognizable derivatives and sometimes subsumed under the term &quot;spatha&quot;.

The Roman &quot;spatha&quot; was used in war and in gladiatorial fights. The &quot;spatha&quot; of literature appears in the Roman Empire in the 1st century AD as a weapon used by presumably Celtic auxiliaries and gradually became a standard heavy infantry weapon by the 3rd century AD, relegating the &quot;gladius&quot; to use as a light infantry weapon. The &quot;spatha&quot; apparently replaced the &quot;gladius&quot; in the front ranks, giving the infantry more reach when thrusting. While the infantry version had a long point, versions carried by the cavalry had a rounded tip that prevented accidental stabbing of the cavalryman&#x27;s own foot or horse.

Archaeologically many instances of the &quot;spatha&quot; have been found in Britain and Germany. It was used extensively by Germanic warriors. It is unclear whether it came from the &quot;gladius&quot; or the longer Celtic swords, or whether it served as a model for the various arming swords and Viking swords of Europe. The &quot;spatha&quot; remained popular throughout the Migration Period. It evolved into the knightly sword of the High Middle Ages by the 12th century.

==Etymology==
The word comes from the Latin &quot;spatha&quot;, which derives from the Greek word &quot;&quot; (&quot;spáthē&quot;), meaning &quot;any broad blade, of wood or metal&quot; but also &quot;broad blade of a sword&quot;.

The Greek word was used in the middle archaic period for various types of Iron Age swords. The word does not appear in Homeric Greek, but it is mentioned in the works of Alcaeus of Mytilene (sixth century BC) and Theophrastus (fourth century BC).

It is likely that &quot;spatha&quot; is the romanization of the Doric Greek word σπάθα (&quot;spáthā&quot;). The word survives in Modern Greek as and . The Latin word became the French &quot;épée&quot;, Catalan and Occitan &quot;espasa&quot;, Portuguese and Spanish &quot;espada&quot;, Italian &quot;spada&quot;, Romanian &quot;spadă&quot; and Albanian &quot;shpata&quot;, all meaning &quot;sword&quot;. The English word &quot;spatula&quot; comes from Latin &quot;spat&quot;(&quot;h&quot;)&quot;ula&quot;, the diminutive of &quot;spatha&quot;. English spade, from Old English &quot;spadu&quot; or &quot;spædu&quot;, is the Germanic cognate, derived from a Common Germanic &quot;*spadō&quot;, ultimately from a Proto-Indo-European stem &quot;*sph2-dh-&quot;.

== Usage ==
During the Second Punic War, Celtic mercenaries introduced the &quot;spatha&quot; to the Roman army. The &quot;spatha&quot; was a weapon used by the cavalrymen, while the auxiliaries and legionaries of the infantry used the &quot;gladius&quot; instead. Eventually, the Roman infantry would adopt the &quot;spatha&quot; in the 2nd century. It was a very versatile sword, undergoing many changes from its origins in Gaul to its usage in the Roman military. The blade was 60 to 75 cm (24 to 30 inches) long.

== Forging ==
The pattern welding was used to strengthen the core of the blade. The appearance of the metal was enhanced due to inlay and contrasting metals. The sword also incorporated one or two forged fullers, thus making the &quot;spatha&quot; a strong and lightweight blade.

==History==

=== Roman Empire ===
The &quot;spatha&quot; was first introduced to the Romans by Celtic mercenaries during the Second Punic War. The Celts would have used weaponry and armor from their homeland, and one of the Celtic weapons would have been the &quot;spatha.&quot; Although many believe that the &quot;spatha&quot; was adopted by the Romans due to contact with Germania, this is not true.

The earlier &quot;gladius&quot; sword was gradually replaced by the &quot;spatha&quot; from the late 2nd to the 3rd century AD. From the early 3rd century, legionaries and cavalrymen began to wear their swords on the left side, perhaps because the &quot;scutum&quot; had been abandoned and the &quot;spatha&quot; had replaced the &quot;gladius&quot;.

In the imperial period, the Romans adopted the original Greek term, &quot;spáthē&quot; (σπάθη), as &quot;spatha&quot;, which still carried the general meaning of any object considered long and flat. &quot;Spatha&quot; appears, first in Pliny and then in Seneca, with different meanings: a spatula, a metal-working implement, a palm-leaf and so on. There is no hint of any native Roman sword called a &quot;spatha&quot;.

Referring to an actual sword, the term first appears in the pages of Tacitus with reference to an incident of the early empire. The British king, Caratacus, having rebelled, found himself trapped on a rocky hill, so that if he turned one way he encountered the &quot;gladii&quot; of the legionaries, and if the other, the &quot;spathae&quot; of the auxiliaries. There is no indication in Tacitus that they were cavalry.

The next mention of &quot;spathae&quot; is in the 5th century, by Vegetius, now as a weapon carried by infantry.

The &quot;spatha&quot; remained in use in the Byzantine Empire and its army. In the Byzantine court, &quot;spatharios&quot; (σπαθάριος), or &quot;bearer of the &quot;spatha&quot;&quot;, was a mid-level court title. Other variants deriving from it were &quot;protospatharios&quot;, &quot;spatharokandidatos&quot; and &quot;spatharokoubikoularios&quot;, the latter reserved for eunuchs. One of the more famous &quot;spatharokandidatoi&quot; was Harald Hardrada.

===Roman Iron Age===

The term &quot;Roman Iron Age&quot; refers approximately to the time of the Roman Empire in northern Europe, which was outside the jurisdiction of the empire, but, judging from the imported Roman artifacts, was influenced by Roman civilization. One source of artifacts from this period are the bogs of Schleswig, Holstein and Denmark. Objects were deliberately broken and thrown into the bogs in the belief that they could go with a deceased chief on his voyage to a better place.

A cache of 90 swords was found at Nydam Mose in Denmark in 1858. They were in the form of the &quot;spatha&quot; and therefore have been classified as &quot;Roman swords&quot;. They are dated to the 3rd to 4th centuries. Many connect the Nydam cache with the sword of Beowulf, who was supposed to be a contemporary.

===Migration period===

When Germanic tribes began to invade the Roman Empire during the 3rd and 4th centuries they would come into contact with the &quot;spatha&quot;. Surviving examples of these Germanic Iron Age swords have blades measuring between in length and in width. These single-handed weapons of war sport a tang long and have very little taper in their blades. They usually end in a rounded tip.

===Viking Age===
Perhaps the most recognisable descendants of the &quot;spathae&quot; were the Viking Age blades. These swords took on a much more acute distal taper and point. They had deep fullers running their length, yet still had single-handed hilts which sported a uniquely shaped pommel, flat at the grip side and roughly triangular early on, with the flat curving to fit the hand later. While the pattern of hilt and blade design of this type might readily be called a &quot;Viking sword&quot;, to do so would be to neglect the widespread popularity it enjoyed. All over continental Europe between the 8th and 10th centuries, this design and its variations could be found. Many of the best blades were of Frankish origin, given hilts in local centres. These blades had significantly better balance.

During Norman times, the blade&#x27;s length increased by around , and the hilt changed significantly. Instead of the Brazil-nut pommel, a thick disc-shaped pommel was attached &quot;on-edge&quot; to the bottom of the iron hilt. In addition the upper guard grew substantially from the near-absent design predating it. Also, the blades tended to taper slightly less than those found in the time of the Vikings.

Jan Petersen, in &quot;De Norske Vikingsverd&quot; (&quot;The Norwegian Viking Swords&quot;, 1919), introduced the most widely used classification of swords of the Viking Age, describing 26 types labelled A–Z. In 1927, R. E. M. Wheeler condensed Petersen&#x27;s typology into a simplified typology of nine groups, numbered I–IX.

===Norman swords===

The transition from the Viking Age &quot;spatha&quot;-inspired sword to the High Medieval knightly sword took place between the 10th and 11th centuries. The main development was the growth of the front handguard into a full cross-guard, and the reduction of the typical Viking Age lobated pommel into simpler brazil nut or disc shapes. The sword of Otto III, (total length 95.5 cm), preserved as a relic in Essen, is an example of the emerging arming sword, although it has been encrusted with decorations during the ensuing centuries.

<text>UFO 1 is the debut studio album by British rock band UFO. It was first released in the UK by Beacon Records in October 1970. The first US release was on Rare Earth Records in April 1971. Neither of these releases charted, but the album did become a success in Germany and Japan.

The album was reissued under the name &quot;Unidentified Flying Object&quot; with four of the five tracks from the band&#x27;s second album. This reissue shows a photo of the band from the 1980s on the cover.

The album was also reissued on the &quot;&quot; compilation album of 2004, along with all the other recordings made by the band with their original guitarist, Mick Bolton. It was also given a straight reissue under the name &quot;All The Hits &amp; More - The Early Days&quot; (XXX Media, Germany, 2011), with no additional tracks.

==Track listing==

* The title &quot;Boogie for George&quot; was shortened in &quot;Boogie&quot; on the CD reissue (1994, Repertoire Records).

<doc id="158788" wikidata="Q201479" url="?curid=158788" title="Carbonyl group">
<text>In organic chemistry, a carbonyl group is a functional group with the formula , composed of a carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom, and it is divalent at the C atom. It is common to several classes of organic compounds (such as aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acid), as part of many larger functional groups. A compound containing a carbonyl group is often referred to as a carbonyl compound.

The term carbonyl can also refer to carbon monoxide as a ligand in an inorganic or organometallic complex (a metal carbonyl, e.g. nickel carbonyl).

The remainder of this article concerns itself with the organic chemistry definition of carbonyl, such that carbon and oxygen share a double bond.

==Carbonyl compounds==

In organic chemistry, a carbonyl group characterizes the following types of compounds:


Other organic carbonyls are urea and the carbamates, the derivatives of acyl chlorides, chloroformates and phosgene, carbonate esters, thioesters, lactones, lactams, hydroxamates, and isocyanates. Examples of inorganic carbonyl compounds are carbon dioxide and carbonyl sulfide.

A special group of carbonyl compounds are dicarbonyl compounds, which can exhibit special properties.

==Structure and reactivity==
For organic compounds, the length of the C-O bond does not vary widely from 120 picometers. Inorganic carbonyls have shorter C-O distances: CO, 113; CO2, 116; and COCl2, 116 pm.

The carbonyl carbon is typically electrophilic. A qualitative order of electrophilicity is RCHO (aldehydes) &gt; R2CO (ketones) &gt; RCO2R&#x27; (esters) &gt; RCONH2 (amides). A variety of nucleophiles attack, breaking the carbon-oxygen double bond.

Interactions between carbonyl groups and other substituents were found in a study of collagen. Substituents can affect carbonyl groups by addition or subtraction of electron density by means of a sigma bond. Δ&quot;H&quot;σ values are much greater when the substituents on the carbonyl group are more electronegative than carbon.

The polarity of C=O bond also enhances the acidity of any adjacent C-H bonds. Due to the positive charge on carbon and the negative charge on oxygen, carbonyl groups are subject to additions and/or nucleophilic attacks. A variety of nucleophiles attack, breaking the carbon-oxygen double bond, and leading to addition-elimination reactions. Nucleophilic reactivity is often proportional to the basicity of the nucleophile and as nucleophilicity increases, the stability within a carbonyl compound decreases. The pKa values of acetaldehyde and acetone are 16.7 and 19 respectively,

==Spectroscopy==

* Infrared spectroscopy: the C=O double bond absorbs infrared light at wavenumbers between approximately 1600–1900 cm−1(5263 nm to 6250 nm). The exact location of the absorption is well understood with respect to the geometry of the molecule. This absorption is known as the &quot;carbonyl stretch&quot; when displayed on an infrared absorption spectrum. In addition, the ultraviolet-visible spectra of propanone in water gives an absorption of carbonyl at 257 nm.
* Nuclear magnetic resonance: the C=O double-bond exhibits different resonances depending on surrounding atoms, generally a downfield shift. The 13C NMR of a carbonyl carbon is in the range of 160–220 ppm.

<text>Choline is a cation with the chemical formula . Choline forms various salts, such as choline chloride and choline bitartrate. An essential nutrient for animals, it is a structural component of phospholipids and cell membranes.

Choline is used to synthesize acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in muscle control and numerous functions of the nervous system. Choline is involved in early development of the brain, gene expression, cell membrane signaling, and brain metabolism.

Although humans synthesize choline in the liver, the amount produced naturally is insufficient to meet cellular functions, requiring that some choline be obtained from foods or dietary supplements. Foods rich in choline include meats, poultry, eggs, and other animal-based products, cruciferous vegetables, beans, nuts, and whole grains. Choline is present in breast milk and is commonly added as an ingredient to baby foods.

==Chemistry==
Choline is a quaternary ammonium cation. The cholines are a family of water-soluble quaternary ammonium compounds. Choline is the parent compound of the cholines class, consisting of ethanolamine residue having three methyl groups attached to the same nitrogen atom. Choline hydroxide is known as choline base. It is hygroscopic and thus often encountered as a colorless viscous hydrated syrup that smells of trimethylamine (TMA). Aqueous solutions of choline are stable, but the compound slowly breaks down to ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycols, and TMA.

Choline chloride can be prepared by treating TMA with 2-chloroethanol:
Choline has historically been produced from natural sources, such as via hydrolysis of lecithin.

==Choline as a nutrient==
Choline is widespread in living beings. In most animals, choline phospholipids are necessary components in cell membranes, in the membranes of cell organelles, and in very low-density lipoproteins.

Choline is an essential nutrient for humans and many other animals. Humans are capable of some &quot;de novo&quot; synthesis of choline but require additional choline in the diet to maintain health. Dietary requirements can be met by choline by itself or in the form of choline phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine. Choline is not formally classified as a vitamin despite being an essential nutrient with an amino acid–like structure and metabolism.

Choline is required to produce acetylcholine – a neurotransmitter – and &quot;S&quot;-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a universal methyl donor. Upon methylation SAM is transformed into S-adenosyl homocysteine.

Symptomatic choline deficiency causes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and muscle damage. Excessive consumption of choline (greater than 7.5 grams per day) can cause low blood pressure, sweating, diarrhea, and fish-like body smell due to trimethylamine, which forms in the metabolism of choline. Rich dietary sources of choline and choline phospholipids include organ meats, egg yolks, dairy products, peanuts, certain beans, nuts and seeds. Vegetables with pasta and rice also contribute to choline intake in the American diet.

== Metabolism ==
=== Biosynthesis ===
In plants, the first step in &quot;de novo&quot; biosynthesis of choline is the decarboxylation of serine into ethanolamine, which is catalyzed by a serine decarboxylase. The synthesis of choline from ethanolamine may take place in three parallel pathways, where three consecutive &quot;N&quot;-methylation steps catalyzed by a methyl transferase are carried out on either the free-base, phospho-bases, or phosphatidyl-bases. The source of the methyl group is &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl--methionine and &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl--homocysteine is generated as a side product.

In humans and most other animals, de novo synthesis of choline proceeds via the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) pathway, but biosynthesis is not enough to meet human requirements. In the hepatic PEMT route, 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) receives 2 acyl groups from acyl-CoA forming a phosphatidic acid. It reacts with cytidine triphosphate to form cytidine diphosphate-diacylglycerol. Its hydroxyl group reacts with serine to form phosphatidylserine which decarboxylates to ethanolamine and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) forms. A PEMT enzyme moves three methyl groups from three &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl methionines (SAM) donors to the ethanolamine group of the phosphatidylethanolamine to form choline in the form of a phosphatidylcholine. Three &quot;S&quot;-adenosylhomocysteines (SAHs) are formed as a byproduct.

Choline can also be released from more complex precursors. For example, phosphatidylcholines (PC) can be hydrolyzed to choline (Chol) in most cell types. Choline can also be produced by the CDP-choline route, cytosolic choline kinases (CK) phosphorylate choline with ATP to phosphocholine (PChol). This happens in some cell types like liver and kidney. Choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferases (CPCT) transform PChol to CDP-choline (CDP-Chol) with cytidine triphosphate (CTP). CDP-choline and diglyceride are transformed to PC by diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase (CPT).

In humans, certain PEMT-enzyme mutations and estrogen deficiency (often due to menopause) increase the dietary need for choline. In rodents, 70% of phosphatidylcholines are formed via the PEMT route and only 30% via the CDP-choline route. In knockout mice, PEMT inactivation makes them completely dependent on dietary choline.

=== Absorption ===
In humans, choline is absorbed from the intestines via the SLC44A1 (CTL1) membrane protein via facilitated diffusion governed by the choline concentration gradient and the electrical potential across the enterocyte membranes. SLC44A1 has limited ability to transport choline: at high concentrations part of it is left unabsorbed. Absorbed choline leaves the enterocytes via the portal vein, passes the liver and enters systemic circulation. Gut microbes degrade the unabsorbed choline to trimethylamine, which is oxidized in the liver to trimethylamine &quot;N&quot;-oxide.

Phosphocholine and glycerophosphocholines are hydrolyzed via phospholipases to choline, which enters the portal vein. Due to their water solubility, some of them escape unchanged to the portal vein. Fat-soluble choline-containing compounds (phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins) are either hydrolyzed by phospholipases or enter the lymph incorporated into chylomicrons.

=== Transport ===
In humans, choline is transported as a free ion in blood. Choline–containing phospholipids and other substances, like glycerophosphocholines, are transported in blood lipoproteins. Blood plasma choline levels in healthy fasting adults is 7–20 micromoles per liter (μmol/L) and 10 μmol/L on average. Levels are regulated, but choline intake and deficiency alters these levels. Levels are elevated for about 3 hours after choline consumption. Phosphatidylcholine levels in the plasma of fasting adults is 1.5–2.5 mmol/L. Its consumption elevates the free choline levels for about 8–12 hours, but does not affect phosphatidylcholine levels significantly.

Choline is a water-soluble ion and thus requires transporters to pass through fat-soluble cell membranes. Three types of choline transporters are known:
* SLC5A7
* CTLs: CTL1 (SLC44A1), CTL2 (SLC44A2) and CTL4 (SLC44A4)
* OCTs: OCT1 (SLC22A1) and OCT2 (SLC22A2)

SLC5A7s are sodium- (Na+) and ATP-dependent transporters. They have high binding affinity for choline, transport it primarily to neurons and are indirectly associated with the acetylcholine production. Their deficient function causes hereditary weakness in the pulmonary and other muscles in humans via acetylcholine deficiency. In knockout mice, their dysfunction results easily in death with cyanosis and paralysis.

CTL1s have moderate affinity for choline and transport it in almost all tissues, including the intestines, liver, kidneys, placenta, and mitochondria. CTL1s supply choline for phosphatidylcholine and trimethylglycine production. CTL2s occur especially in the mitochondria in the tongue, kidneys, muscles, and heart. They are associated with the mitochondrial oxidation of choline to trimethylglycine. CTL1s and CTL2s are not associated with the acetylcholine production, but transport choline together via the blood–brain barrier. Only CTL2s occur on the brain side of the barrier. They also remove excess choline from the neurons back to blood. CTL1s occur only on the blood side of the barrier, but also on the membranes of astrocytes and neurons.

OCT1s and OCT2s are not associated with the acetylcholine production. They transport choline with low affinity. OCT1s transport choline primarily in the liver and kidneys while OCT2s transport choline in kidneys and the brain.

=== Storage ===
Choline is stored in the cell membranes and organelles as phospholipids, and inside cells as phosphatidylcholines and glycerophosphocholines.

=== Excretion ===
Even at choline doses of 2–8 g, little choline is excreted into urine in humans. Excretion happens via transporters that occur within kidneys (see transport). Trimethylglycine is demethylated in the liver and kidneys to dimethylglycine (tetrahydrofolate receives one of the methyl groups). Methylglycine forms, is excreted into urine, or is demethylated to glycine.

== Function ==
Choline and its derivatives have many biological functions. Notably choline serves as a precursor for other essential cell components and signaling molecules, such as phospholipids that form cell membranes, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and the osmoregulator trimethylglycine (betaine). Trimethylglycine in turn serves as a source of methyl groups by participating in the biosynthesis of &quot;S&quot;-adenosylmethionine.

=== Phospholipid precursor ===
Choline is transformed to diverse phospholipids, like phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins. These are found in all cell membranes and the membranes of most cell organelles. Phosphatidylcholines are structurally important part of the cell membranes. In humans, 40–50% of their phospholipids are phosphatidylcholines.

Choline phospholipids also form lipid rafts in the cell membranes along with cholesterol. The rafts are centers, for example for cholinergic receptors and receptor signal transduction enzymes.

Phosphatidylcholines are needed for the synthesis of VLDLs: 70–95% of their phospholipids are phosphatidylcholines in humans.

Choline is also needed for the synthesis of pulmonary surfactant, which is a mixture consisting mostly of phosphatidylcholines. The surfactant is responsible for lung elasticity, that is for lung tissue&#x27;s ability to contract and expand. For example, deficiency of phosphatidylcholines in the lung tissues has been linked to acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Phosphatidylcholines are excreted into bile and work together with bile acid salts as surfactants in it, thus helping with the intestinal absorption of lipids.

=== Acetylcholine synthesis ===
Choline is a precursor to acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays a necessary role in muscle contraction, memory and neural development. Nonetheless, there is little acetylcholine in the human body relative to other forms of choline. Neurons also store choline in the form of phospholipids to their cell membranes for the production of acetylcholine.

=== Source of trimethylglycine ===
In humans, choline is oxidized irreversibly in liver mitochondria to glycine betaine aldehyde by choline oxidases. This is oxidized by mitochondrial or cytosolic betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenases to trimethylglycine. Trimethylglycine is a necessary osmoregulator. It also works as a substrate for the BHMT-enzyme, which methylates homocysteine to methionine. This is a &quot;S&quot;-adenosylmethionine (SAM) precursor. SAM is a common reagent in biological methylation reactions. For example, it methylates guanidines of DNA and certain lysines of histones. Thus it is part of gene expression and epigenetic regulation. Choline deficiency thus leads to elevated homocysteine levels and decreased SAM levels in blood.

== Content in foods ==
Choline occurs in foods as a free cation and in the form of phospholipids, especially as phosphatidylcholines. Choline is highest in organ meats and egg yolks though it is found to a lesser degree in non-organ meats, grains, vegetables, fruit and dairy products. Cooking oils and other food fats have about 5 mg/100 g of total choline. In the United States, food labels express the amount of choline in a serving as a percentage of Daily Value (%DV) based on the Adequate Intake of 550 mg/day. 100% of the daily value means that a serving of food has 550 mg of choline. &quot;Total choline&quot; is defined as the sum of free choline and choline-containing phospholipids, without accounting for mass fraction.

Human breast milk is rich in choline. Exclusive breastfeeding corresponds to about 120 mg of choline per day for the baby. Increase in a mother&#x27;s choline intake raises the choline content of breast milk and low intake decreases it. Infant formulas may or may not contain enough choline. In the EU and the US, it is mandatory to add at least 7 mg of choline per 100 kilocalories (kcal) to every infant formula. In the EU, levels above 50 mg/100 kcal are not allowed.

Trimethylglycine is a functional metabolite of choline. It substitutes for choline nutritionally, but only partially. High amounts of trimethylglycine occur in wheat bran (1,339 mg/100 g), toasted wheat germ (1,240 mg/100 g) and spinach (600–645 mg/100 g), for example.

=== Daily values ===

The following table contains updated sources of choline to reflect the new Daily Value and the new Nutrition Facts and Supplement Facts Labels. It reflects data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service. FoodData Central, 2019.


==Dietary recommendations==
Insufficient data is available to establish an estimated average requirement (EAR) for choline, so the Food and Nutrition Board established adequate intakes (AIs). For adults, the AI for choline was set at 550 mg/day for men and 425 mg/day for women. These values have been shown to prevent hepatic alteration in men. However, the study used to derive these values did not evaluate whether less choline would be effective, as researchers only compared a choline-free diet to a diet containing 550 mg of choline per day. From this, the AIs for children and adolescents were extrapolated.

Recommendations are in milligrams per day (mg/day). The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommendations are general recommendations for the EU countries. The EFSA has not set any upper limits for intake. Individual EU countries may have more specific recommendations. The National Academy of Medicine (NAM) recommendations apply in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.

==Intake in populations==
Twelve surveys undertaken in 9 EU countries between 2000 and 2011 estimated choline intake of adults in these countries to be 269–468 milligrams per day. Intake was 269–444 mg/day in adult women and 332–468 mg/day in adult men. Intake was 75–127 mg/day in infants, 151–210 mg/day in 1- to 3-year-olds, 177–304 mg/day in 3- to 10-year-olds and 244–373 mg/day in 10- to 18-year-olds. The total choline intake mean estimate was 336 mg/day in pregnant adolescents and 356 mg/day in pregnant women.

A study based on the NHANES 2009–2012 survey estimated the choline intake to be too low in some US subpopulations. Intake was 315.2–318.8 mg/d in 2+ year olds between this time period. Out of 2+ year olds, only % of males and % of females exceeded the adequate intake (AI). AI was exceeded by % of 2- to 3-year-olds, % of 4- to 8-year-olds, % of 9- to 13-year-olds, % of 14–18 and % of 19+ year olds. Upper intake level was not exceeded in any subpopulations.

A 2013–2014 NHANES study of the US population found the choline intake of 2- to 19-year-olds to be  mg/day and  mg/day in adults 20 and over. Intake was  mg/d in men 20 and over and 278 mg/d in women 20 and over.

==Deficiency==
===Signs and symptoms===
Symptomatic choline deficiency is rare in humans. Most obtain sufficient amounts of it from the diet and are able to biosynthesize limited amounts of it via PEMT. Symptomatic deficiency is often caused by certain diseases or by other indirect causes. Severe deficiency causes muscle damage and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which may develop into cirrhosis.

Besides humans, fatty liver is also a typical sign of choline deficiency in other animals. Bleeding in the kidneys can also occur in some species. This is suspected to be due to deficiency of choline derived trimethylglycine, which functions as an osmoregulator.

===Causes and mechanisms===
Estrogen production is a relevant factor which predisposes individuals to deficiency along with low dietary choline intake. Estrogens activate phosphatidylcholine producing PEMT enzymes. Women before menopause have lower dietary need for choline than men due to women&#x27;s higher estrogen production. Without estrogen therapy, the choline needs of post-menopausal women are similar to men&#x27;s. Some single-nucleotide polymorphisms (genetic factors) affecting choline and folate metabolism are also relevant. Certain gut microbes also degrade choline more efficiently than others, so they are also relevant.

In deficiency, availability of phosphatidylcholines in the liver are decreased – these are needed for formation of VLDLs. Thus VLDL-mediated fatty acid transport out of the liver decreases leading to fat accumulation in the liver. Other simultaneously occurring mechanisms explaining the observed liver damage have also been suggested. For example, choline phospholipids are also needed in mitochondrial membranes. Their unavailability leads to the inability of mitochondrial membranes to maintain proper electrochemical gradient, which, among other things, is needed for degrading fatty acids via β-oxidation. Fat metabolism within liver therefore decreases.

==Excess intake==
Excessive doses of choline can have adverse effects. Daily 8–20 g doses of choline, for example, have been found to cause low blood pressure, nausea, diarrhea and fish-like body odor. The odor is due to trimethylamine (TMA) formed by the gut microbes from the unabsorbed choline (see trimethylaminuria).

The liver oxidizes TMA to trimethylamine &quot;N&quot;-oxide (TMAO). Elevated levels of TMA and TMAO in the body have been linked to increased risk of atherosclerosis and mortality. Thus, excessive choline intake has been hypothetized to increase these risks in addition to carnitine, which also is formed into TMA and TMAO by gut bacteria. However, choline intake has not been shown to increase the risk of dying from cardiovascular diseases. It is plausible that elevated TMA and TMAO levels are just a symptom of other underlying illnesses or genetic factors that predispose individuals for increased mortality. Such factors may have not been properly accounted for in certain studies observing TMA and TMAO level related mortality. Causality may be reverse or confounding and large choline intake might not increase mortality in humans. For example, kidney dysfunction predisposes for cardiovascular diseases, but can also decrease TMA and TMAO excretion.

==Health effects==
===Neural tube closure===
Low maternal intake of choline is associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects (NTDs). Higher maternal intake of choline is likely associated with better neurocognition/neurodevelopment in children. Choline and folate, interacting with vitamin B12, act as methyl donors to homocysteine to form methionine, which can then go on to form &quot;S&quot;-adenosylmethionine (SAM). SAM is the substrate for almost all methylation reactions in mammals. It has been suggested that disturbed methylation via SAM could be responsible for the relation between folate and NTDs. This may also apply to choline. Certain mutations that disturb choline metabolism increase the prevalence of NTDs in newborns, but the role of dietary choline deficiency remains unclear, 

===Cardiovascular diseases and cancer===
Choline deficiency can cause fatty liver, which increases cancer and cardiovascular disease risk. Choline deficiency also decreases SAM production, which partakes in DNA methylation – this decrease may also contribute to carcinogenesis. Thus, deficiency and its association with such diseases has been studied. However, observational studies of free populations have not convincingly shown an association between low choline intake and cardiovascular diseases or most cancers. Studies on prostate cancer have been contradictory.

===Cognition===
Studies observing the effect between higher choline intake and cognition have been conducted in human adults, with contradictory results. Similar studies on human infants and children have been contradictory and also limited.

==Perinatal development==
Both pregnancy and lactation increase demand for choline dramatically. This demand may be met by upregulation of PEMT via increasing estrogen levels to produce more choline &quot;de novo&quot;, but even with increased PEMT activity, the demand for choline is still so high that bodily stores are generally depleted. This is exemplified by the observation that &quot;Pemt −/−&quot; mice (mice lacking functional PEMT) will abort at 9–10 days unless fed supplemental choline.

While maternal stores of choline are depleted during pregnancy and lactation, the placenta accumulates choline by pumping choline against the concentration gradient into the tissue, where it is then stored in various forms, mostly as acetylcholine. Choline concentrations in amniotic fluid can be ten times higher than in maternal blood.

===Functions in the fetus===
Choline is in high demand during pregnancy as a substrate for building cellular membranes (rapid fetal and mother tissue expansion), increased need for one-carbon moieties (a substrate for methylation of DNA and other functions), raising choline stores in fetal and placental tissues, and for increased production of lipoproteins (proteins containing &quot;fat&quot; portions). In particular, there is interest in the impact of choline consumption on the brain. This stems from choline&#x27;s use as a material for making cellular membranes (particularly in making phosphatidylcholine). Human brain growth is most rapid during the third trimester of pregnancy and continues to be rapid to approximately five years of age. During this time, the demand is high for sphingomyelin, which is made from phosphatidylcholine (and thus from choline), because this material is used to myelinate (insulate) nerve fibers. Choline is also in demand for the production of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which can influence the structure and organization of brain regions, neurogenesis, myelination, and synapse formation. Acetylcholine is even present in the placenta and may help control cell proliferation and differentiation (increases in cell number and changes of multiuse cells into dedicated cellular functions) and parturition.

Choline uptake into the brain is controlled by a low-affinity transporter located at the blood–brain barrier. Transport occurs when arterial blood plasma choline concentrations increase above 14 μmol/L, which can occur during a spike in choline concentration after consuming choline-rich foods. Neurons, conversely, acquire choline by both high- and low-affinity transporters. Choline is stored as membrane-bound phosphatidylcholine, which can then be used for acetylcholine neurotransmitter synthesis later. Acetylcholine is formed as needed, travels across the synapse, and transmits the signal to the following neuron. Afterwards, acetylcholinesterase degrades it, and the free choline is taken up by a high-affinity transporter into the neuron again.

==Uses==
Choline chloride and choline bitartrate are used in dietary supplements. Bitartrate is used more often due to its lower hygroscopicity. Certain choline salts are used to supplement chicken, turkey and some other animal feeds. Some salts are also used as industrial chemicals: for example, in photolithography to remove photoresist. Choline theophyllinate and choline salicylate are used as medicines, as well as structural analogs, like methacholine and carbachol. Radiolabeled cholines, like 11C-choline, are used in medical imaging. Other commercially used salts include tricholine citrate and choline bicarbonate.

The most common forms of dietary choline supplements are shown in the following table:


==History==
===Discovery===
In 1849, Adolph Strecker was the first to isolate choline from pig bile. In 1852, L. Babo and M. Hirschbrunn extracted choline from white mustard seeds and named it &quot;sinkaline&quot;. In 1862, Strecker repeated his experiment with pig and ox bile, calling the substance &quot;choline&quot; for the first time after the Greek word for bile, &quot;chole&quot;, and identifying it with the chemical formula C5H13NO. In 1850, Theodore Nicolas Gobley extracted from the brains and roe of carps a substance he named &quot;lecithin&quot; after the Greek word for egg yolk, , showing in 1874 that it was a mixture of phosphatidylcholines.

In 1865, Oscar Liebreich isolated &quot;neurine&quot; from animal brains. The structural formulas of acetylcholine and Liebreich&#x27;s &quot;neurine&quot; were resolved by Adolf von Baeyer in 1867. Later that year &quot;neurine&quot; and sinkaline were shown to be the same substances as Strecker&#x27;s choline. Thus, Bayer was the first to resolve the structure of choline. The compound now known as neurine is unrelated to choline.

===Discovery as a nutrient===
In the early 1930s, Charles Best and colleagues noted that fatty liver in rats on a special diet and diabetic dogs could be prevented by feeding them lecithin, proving in 1932 that choline in lecithin was solely responsible for this preventive effect. In 1998, the US National Academy of Medicine reported their first recommendations for choline in the human diet.

<text>George Randolph Scott (January 23, 1898 – March 2, 1987) was an American film actor, whose Hollywood career spanned from 1928 to 1962. As a leading man for all but the first three years of his cinematic career, Scott appeared in dramas, comedies, musicals, adventures, war, horror and fantasy films, and Westerns. Out of his more than 100 film appearances, more than 60 of them were Westerns.

At , lanky and muscular, Scott displayed a Southern drawl that offset his limitations.

During the early 1950s, Scott was a consistent box-office draw. In the annual &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot; Top Ten Polls, his name appeared on the list for four consecutive years, from 1950 to 1953. Scott also appeared in Quigley&#x27;s &quot;Top Ten Money Makers Poll&quot;, from 1950 to 1953.
==Early years==
Scott was born January 23, 1898, in Orange County, Virginia, and reared in Charlotte, North Carolina, the second of six children born to parents of Scottish descent. His father was George Grant Scott, born in Franklin, Virginia, the first person licensed as a certified public accountant (CPA) in North Carolina. His mother was Lucille Crane Scott, born in Luray, Virginia, a member of a wealthy North Carolina family.

Because of his family&#x27;s financial status, Randolph was able to attend private schools, such as Woodberry Forest School. From an early age, Scott developed and displayed his athleticism, excelling in football, baseball, horse racing, and swimming.

===World War I===
In April 1917, the United States entered World War I. In July, Scott joined a unit of the North Carolina National Guard. He was trained as an artillery observer and earned promotion to corporal in October 1917 and sergeant in February 1918. In May 1918, Scott entered active duty at Fort Monroe, Virginia, as a member of the 2nd Trench Mortar Battalion. The battalion arrived in France in June 1918, and took part in combat with the U.S. IV Corps in the Toul sector and Thiaucourt zone. After the Armistice of November 11, 1918, ended the war, the 2nd TM Battalion took part in the post-war occupation of Germany as part of U.S. VI Corps.

Following the armistice, Scott enrolled in the artillery Officer Candidate School, which was located in Saumur. He received his commission as a second lieutenant of Field Artillery in May 1919 and departed for the United States soon afterwards. He arrived in New York City on June 6 and reported to Camp Mills, where he received his honorable discharge on June 13. Scott made use of his wartime experience in his acting career, including his training in horsemanship and the use of firearms.

===After World War I===
With his military career over Scott continued his education at Georgia Tech, where he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Order and set his sights on becoming an all-American football player. However a back injury prevented him from achieving this goal. Scott then transferred to the University of North Carolina, where he majored in textile engineering and manufacturing. He eventually dropped out and went to work as an accountant in the textile firm where his father, a CPA, was employed.

==Career==
===Stage and early film appearances===

====Early films====
Around 1927, Scott developed an interest in acting and decided to make his way to Los Angeles and seek a career in the motion picture industry. Scott&#x27;s father had become acquainted with Howard Hughes and provided a letter of introduction for his son to present to the eccentric millionaire film maker. Hughes responded by getting Scott a small part in a George O&#x27;Brien film called &quot;Sharp Shooters&quot; (1928). A print of the film survives in the UCLA Film and Television Archive.

In the next few years, Scott continued working as an extra and bit player in several films, including &quot;Weary River&quot; (1929) with Richard Barthelmess, &quot;The Far Call&quot; (1929), &quot;The Black Watch&quot; (1929) (directed by John Ford with John Wayne also uncredited) and uncredited as the Rider in &quot;The Virginian&quot; (1929) with Gary Cooper. Scott also served as Cooper&#x27;s dialect coach in this latter film.

Scott was also uncredited on &quot;Dynamite&quot; (1929) directed by Cecil B. DeMille, and Ford&#x27;s &quot;Born Reckless&quot; (1930).

===Stage===
On the advice of Cecil B. DeMille, Scott gained much-needed acting experience by performing in stage plays with the Pasadena Playhouse. His stage roles during this period include:

* A minister in &quot;Gentlemen Be Seated&quot;
* A butler in &quot;Nellie, the Beautiful Model&quot;
* Metellus Cimber in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;
* Hector Malone in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Man and Superman&quot;

Scott appeared in the play &quot;Under a Virginia Moon&quot; at the Vine Street Theatre in Hollywood in 1932. His performance garnered several screen test offers from the major movie studios. Scott eventually signed a seven-year contract with Paramount Pictures at a salary of US$400 per week ().

===Movie debut===
In between his Pasadena Playhouse days and Vine Street Theatre performance Scott made his film debut.

In 1931 Scott played his first leading role (with Sally Blane) in &quot;Women Men Marry&quot; (1931), a film, now apparently lost, made by a Poverty Row studio called Headline Pictures. A silent film by the same name from 1922, directed by Edward Dillon, has apparently been preserved, however, at Filmmuseum Amsterdam.

He followed that movie with a supporting part in a Warner Bros. production starring George Arliss, &quot;A Successful Calamity&quot; (1932).

===Paramount===
====Zane Grey apprenticeship====

Scott&#x27;s first role under his new Paramount contract was a small supporting part in a comedy called &quot;Sky Bride&quot; (1932) starring Richard Arlen and Jack Oakie.

Following that, however, Paramount cast him as the lead in &quot;Heritage of the Desert&quot; (1932), his first significant starring role and also the one that established him as a Western hero. As with &quot;Women Men Marry&quot;, Sally Blane was his leading lady. Henry Hathaway made his directorial debut with &quot;Heritage of the Desert&quot;. The film was popular and Scott would go on to make ten &quot;B&quot; Western films loosely based on the novels of Zane Grey.

Many of these Grey adaptations were remakes of earlier silent films or even retitled versions of more recent movies. In an effort to save on production costs, Paramount utilized stock footage from the silent version and even hired some of the same actors, such as Raymond Hatton and Noah Beery, to repeat their roles, meaning that sometimes their ages would vary eight or more years during the same scene. For the 1933 films &quot;The Thundering Herd&quot; and &quot;Man of the Forest&quot;, Scott&#x27;s hair was darkened and he sported a trim moustache so that he could easily be matched to footage of Jack Holt, the star of the silent versions.

In between his work in the Zane Grey Western series, Paramount cast Scott in several non-Western roles, such as &quot;the other man&quot; in &quot;Hot Saturday&quot; (1932), with Nancy Carroll and Cary Grant. Scott returned to Zane Grey Westerns with &quot;Wild Horse Mesa&quot; (1932), then was the romantic male lead in &quot;Hello, Everybody!&quot; (1933). &quot;The Thundering Herd&quot; (1933) was another Zane Grey Western with Hathaway, then he was in two horror movies, &quot;Murders in the Zoo&quot; (1933) with Lionel Atwill and &quot;Supernatural&quot; (1933) with Carole Lombard. After the Western &quot;Sunset Pass&quot; (1933), Paramount loaned Scott to Columbia, to play Bebe Daniels&#x27;s love interest in a minor romantic comedy called &quot;Cocktail Hour&quot; (1933).

Back at Paramount, Scott acted in the Westerns &quot;Man of the Forest&quot; (1933) and &quot;To the Last Man&quot; (1933), both with Hathaway from Zane Grey novels and featuring Noah Beery Sr. as the villain. Scott was loaned to Monogram Pictures for &quot;Broken Dreams&quot; (1933) then was back with Hathaway for &quot;The Last Round-Up&quot; (1934).

Scott did three more Zane Grey Westerns without Hathaway: &quot;Wagon Wheels&quot; (1934) directed by Charles Barton (a remake of 1931&#x27;s &quot;Fighting Caravans&quot; starring Gary Cooper), &quot;Home on the Range&quot; (1935) from Arthur Jacobson, and &quot;Rocky Mountain Mystery&quot; (1935) with Barton.

Film historian William K. Everson refers to the Zane Grey series as being &quot;uniformly good&quot;. He also writes:

The Zane Grey series films were a boon for Scott, as they provided him with &quot;an excellent training ground for both action and acting&quot;.

====RKO and &quot;A&quot; Films====
Paramount loaned Scott to RKO Radio Pictures to support Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers and Irene Dunne in &quot;Roberta&quot; (1935), a hugely popular adaptation of the Broadway musical. RKO liked Scott and kept him on for &quot;Village Tale&quot; (1935), directed by John Cromwell, and &quot;She&quot; (1935), an adaptation of the novel by H. Rider Haggard from the makers of &quot;King Kong&quot;.

Scott went back to Paramount for &quot;So Red the Rose&quot; (1935) with Margaret Sullavan, then was reunited with Astaire and Rogers at RKO in &quot;Follow the Fleet&quot; (1936). It was another big hit. Scott was in a car drama at Paramount, &quot;And Sudden Death&quot; (1936), directed by Barton, then was loaned to independent producer Edward Small, to play Hawkeye in another adventure classic, &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;, adapted from the 1826 novel by James Fenimore Cooper. A big hit, the film &quot;gave Scott his first unqualified &#x27;A&#x27; picture success as a lead.&quot;

At this point Paramount only put Scott in &quot;A&quot; films. He was a love interest for Mae West in &quot;Go West, Young Man&quot; (1936) and was reunited with Irene Dunne in a musical, &quot;High, Wide and Handsome&quot; (1937). This last film, a musical directed by Rouben Mamoulian, featured Scott in his &quot;most ambitious performance.&quot;

Scott went to 20th Century Fox to play the romantic male lead in a Shirley Temple film, &quot;Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm&quot; (1938). At Paramount he made a well budgeted Western &quot;The Texans&quot; (1938) with Joan Bennett then he starred in &quot;The Road to Reno&quot; (1938) at Universal.

One missed opportunity came about around this time. Due to his Southern background, Scott was considered for the role of Ashley Wilkes in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, but it was Leslie Howard who eventually got the part.

===20th Century Fox===
Scott&#x27;s contract with Paramount ended and he signed a deal with Fox. They put him in &quot;Jesse James&quot; (1939), a lavish highly romanticized account of the famous outlaw (Tyrone Power) and his brother Frank (Henry Fonda). Scott was billed fourth as a sympathetic marshal after the James brothers; it was his first film in color.

Scott was reunited with Temple in &quot;Susannah of the Mounties&quot; (1939), Temple&#x27;s last profitable film for Fox. The studio gave him the lead in &quot;Frontier Marshal&quot; (1939), playing Wyatt Earp, after which he went to Columbia to star in a medium budget action film, &quot;Coast Guard&quot; (1939). Back at Fox he was in a war movie, &quot;20,000 Men a Year&quot; (1939).

Scott went over to Warner Bros to make &quot;Virginia City&quot; (1940), billed third after Errol Flynn and Miriam Hopkins, playing Flynn&#x27;s antagonist, a Confederate officer – but a sympathetic one, and not the actual villain (which was played by Humphrey Bogart). There were frequent disputes between director Michael Curtiz, actors and producer Hal Wallis about script changes. But Curtiz recalled that Scott tried to stay out of those arguments: &quot;Randy Scott is a complete anachronism,&quot; said Curtiz. &quot;He&#x27;s a gentleman. And so far he&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve met in this business...&quot; According to Nott, Curtiz and Scott got along well both personally and creatively, with Scott giving one of the top performances in his career.

Scott went back to RKO to play the &quot;other man&quot; role in the Irene Dunne–Cary Grant romantic comedy &quot;My Favorite Wife&quot; (1940), a huge hit for RKO. For Universal, he starred with Kay Francis in &quot;When the Daltons Rode&quot; (1940). Back at Fox, Scott returned to Zane Grey country by co-starring with Robert Young in the Technicolor production &quot;Western Union&quot;, directed by Fritz Lang. Scott played a &quot;good bad man&quot; in this film and gave one of his finest performances. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote:

In 1941 Scott also co-starred with a young Gene Tierney in another Western, &quot;Belle Starr&quot;. followed by a spy film with Elisabeth Bergner, &quot;Paris Calling&quot; (1941).

===Universal===
Scott&#x27;s only role as a truly evil villain was in Universal&#x27;s &quot;The Spoilers&quot; (1942), an adaptation of Rex Beach&#x27;s 1905 tale of the Alaskan gold rush also starring Marlene Dietrich and John Wayne. The Dietrich-Scott-Wayne combination led to Universal casting the trio that same year in &quot;Pittsburgh&quot;, a war-time action-melodrama. Scott was billed above Wayne in both films but Wayne actually played the heroic leading man roles and enjoyed more screen time in each movie.

===World War II===
Shortly after the United States entered World War II, Scott attempted to obtain an officer&#x27;s commission in the Marines, but because of a back injury years earlier he was rejected. However, he did his part for the war effort by touring in a comedy act with Joe DeRita (who later became a member of the Three Stooges) for the Victory Committee showcases, and he also raised food for the government on a ranch that he owned.

In 1942 and 1943 Scott appeared in several war films, notably &quot;To the Shores of Tripoli&quot; (1942) at Fox, &quot;Bombardier&quot; (1943) at RKO, the Canadian warship drama &quot;Corvette K-225&quot; (1943) (produced by Howard Hawks), &quot;Gung Ho!&quot; at Universal and &quot;China Sky&quot; (1945) at RKO. He also made &quot;The Desperadoes&quot; (1943), Columbia Pictures&#x27; first feature in Technicolor. The film was produced by Harry Joe Brown, with whom Scott would form a business partnership several years later.

Scott was one of many Universal stars who made a cameo in &quot;Follow the Boys&quot; (1944). He was in a &quot;northern&quot; with Gypsy Rose Lee, &quot;Belle of the Yukon&quot; (1944), and made a swashbuckler film for producer Benedict Bogeaus alongside Charles Laughton, the cheaply made production &quot;Captain Kidd&quot; (1945).

Scott performed on two radio shows in 1945: &quot;Belle of the Yukon&quot; on &quot;Screen Guild Players&quot; and &quot;A Lady Takes a Chance&quot; for &quot;Old Gold Comedy Theatre&quot;. 

===Post–World War II career===
In 1946, after playing roles that had him wandering in and out of the saddle for many years, Scott appeared in &quot;Abilene Town&quot;, a UA release which cast him in what would become one of his classic images, the fearless lawman cleaning up a lawless town. The film &quot;cemented Scott&#x27;s position as a cowboy hero&quot; and from this point on all but two of his starring films would be Westerns. The Scott Westerns of the late 1940s would each be budgeted around US$1,000,000, equal to $ today. Scott mostly made Westerns for producers Nat Holt or Harry Joe Brown at Warner Bros, although he did make &quot;Albuquerque&quot; (1948) at Paramount.

&quot;The BFI Companion to the Western&quot; noted:In his earlier Westerns ... the Scott persona is debonair, easy-going, graceful, though with the necessary hint of steel. As he matures into his fifties his roles change. Increasingly Scott becomes the man who has seen it all, who has suffered pain, loss, and hardship, and who has now achieved (but at what cost?) a stoic calm proof against vicissitude.

====Non-Westerns====
Scott&#x27;s last non-Westerns were a mystery with Peggy Ann Garner at Fox, &quot;Home Sweet Homicide&quot; (1947), and a family drama for Bogeaus, &quot;Christmas Eve&quot; (1947). He also had a cameo in Warners&#x27; &quot;Starlift&quot; (1951).

====Nat Holt====
Scott did two Westerns for Nat Holt at RKO, &quot;Badman&#x27;s Territory&quot; (1946) and &quot;Trail Street&quot; (1947). He followed it with another pair for Holt at that studio, &quot;Return of the Bad Men&quot; (1948) at RKO and &quot;Canadian Pacific&quot; (1949), then they did &quot;Fighting Man of the Plains&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Cariboo Trail&quot; (1950) at Fox.

Scott also made &quot;Rage at Dawn&quot; in 1955 for Nat Holt, which was released by RKO starring Scott and Forrest Tucker, and featuring Denver Pyle, Edgar Buchanan, J. Carrol Naish and Myron Healey. It purports to tell the true story of the Reno Brothers, an outlaw gang which terrorized the American Midwest, particularly in the area around Seymour, Indiana, soon after the American Civil War.

====Harry Joe Brown====
Scott renewed his acquaintance with producer Harry Joe Brown at Columbia with &quot;Gunfighters&quot; (1947). They began producing many of Scott&#x27;s Westerns, including several that were shot in the two-color Cinecolor process. Their collaboration resulted in the film &quot;Coroner Creek&quot; (1948) with Scott as a vengeance-driven cowpoke who &quot;predates the Budd Boetticher/Burt Kennedy heroes by nearly a decade,&quot; and &quot;The Walking Hills&quot; (1949), a modern-day tale of gold hunters directed by John Sturges.

They followed it with &quot;The Doolins of Oklahoma&quot; (1949), &quot;The Nevadan&quot; (1950), &quot;Santa Fe&quot; (1951), &quot;Man in the Saddle&quot; (1951), &quot;Hangman&#x27;s Knot&quot; (1952), &quot;The Stranger Wore a Gun&quot; (1953) (shot in 3-D), &quot;Ten Wanted Men&quot; (1955), and &quot;A Lawless Street&quot; (1955) (with Angela Lansbury.)

====Warner Bros.====
Scott did &quot;Colt .45&quot; (1950) at Warner Bros. where his salary was US$100,000 per picture (equal to $ today). He stayed at the studio to do &quot;Sugarfoot&quot; (1951), &quot;Fort Worth&quot; (1951), &quot;Carson City&quot; (1952), &quot;The Man Behind the Gun&quot; (1953), &quot;Thunder Over the Plains&quot; (1953), &quot;Riding Shotgun&quot; (1954), &quot;Tall Man Riding&quot; (1955) Most of these were directed by Andre de Toth.
Also of interest is &quot;Shootout at Medicine Bend&quot; shot in 1955 but released in 1957, which was Scott&#x27;s last movie in black and white. The movie co-stars James Garner and Angie Dickinson.

====Boetticher and Kennedy films====
In 1955 screenwriter Burt Kennedy wrote the script &quot;Seven Men from Now&quot;, which was scheduled to be filmed by Batjac Productions with John Wayne as the film&#x27;s star and Budd Boetticher as director. However, Wayne was already committed to &quot;The Searchers&quot; with John Ford, and suggested Scott as his replacement. The resulting film, released in 1956, did not make a great impact at the time but is now regarded by many as one of Scott&#x27;s best, as well as the one that launched Scott and Boetticher into successful collaborations on seven films.

While each film is independent and there are no shared characters or settings, this set of films is often called the Ranown Cycle, for the production company run by Scott and Harry Joe Brown, which was involved in their production. Kennedy scripted four of them. In these films ...
Boetticher achieved works of great beauty, formally precise in structure and visually elegant, notably for their use of the distinctive landscape of the California Sierras. As the hero of these &quot;floating poker games&quot; (as Andrew Sarris calls them), Scott tempers their innately pessimistic view with quiet, stoical humour, as he pits his wits against such charming villains as Richard Boone in &quot;The Tall T&quot; and Claude Akins in &quot;Comanche Station&quot;.

After &quot;7th Cavalry&quot; (1956), Boetticher, Kennedy and Scott were reunited for their second film, &quot;The Tall T&quot; (1957), which co-starred Richard Boone. The third in the series was &quot;Decision at Sundown&quot; (1957), although that script was not written by Kennedy. The unofficial series continued with &quot;Buchanan Rides Alone&quot; (1958). &quot;Westbound&quot; (1959) is not considered part of the official cycle, although Boetticher directed it. However the last two, both written by Kennedy, were: &quot;Ride Lonesome&quot; (1959) and &quot;Comanche Station&quot; (1960)

====Last film: &quot;Ride the High Country&quot;====
In 1962 Scott made his final film appearance in &quot;Ride the High Country&quot;. It was directed by Sam Peckinpah and co-starred Joel McCrea, an actor who had a screen image similar to Scott&#x27;s and who also from the mid-1940s on devoted his career almost exclusively to Westerns.

Scott and McCrea&#x27;s farewell Western is characterized by a nostalgic sense of the passing of the Old West; a preoccupation with the emotionality of male bonding and of the experiential &quot;gap&quot; between the young and the old; and the fearful evocation, in the form of the Hammonds (the villains in the film), of these preoccupations transmuted into brutal and perverse forms.McCrea&#x27;s role in the film is slightly larger than Scott&#x27;s, although arguably less colorful, but Scott was billed above McCrea after the director tossed a coin over top billing that came up favoring Scott.

==Later years==
After &quot;Ride the High Country&quot;, Scott retired from film at the age of 64. A wealthy man, Scott had managed shrewd investments throughout his life, eventually accumulating a fortune worth a reputed $100 million, with holdings in real estate, gas, oil wells and securities.

He and his wife Patricia continued to live in Beverly Hills. During his retirement years, he remained friends with Fred Astaire, with whom he attended Dodgers games. An avid golfer with a putting green in his yard, Scott was a member of the Bel Air Country Club, Los Angeles Country Club and Eldorado Country Club in Indian Wells, California. He also became friends with the Reverend Billy Graham. Scott was described by his son Christopher as a deeply religious man. He was an Episcopalian and the Scott family were members of All Saints&#x27; Episcopal Church in Beverly Hills and St. Peter&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Scott owned and co-designed Cresta Verde golf course in Corona, California.

==Personal life==
Randolph Scott married twice. In 1936 he became the second husband of heiress Marion duPont, daughter of William du Pont Sr., and great-granddaughter of Éleuthère Irénée du Pont de Nemours, the founder of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company. Marion had previously married George Somerville, with Scott serving as best man at the wedding. The Scotts&#x27; marriage ended in divorce three years later. The union produced no children. Though divorced, she kept his last name nearly five decades until her death in 1983.

In 1944 Scott married the actress Patricia Stillman, who was 21 years his junior. In 1950 they adopted two children, Sandra and Christopher.

Although Scott achieved fame as a motion picture actor, he managed to keep a fairly low profile with his private life. Offscreen he was a good friend of Fred Astaire and Cary Grant. He met Grant on the set of &quot;Hot Saturday&quot; (1932), and shortly afterwards, they moved in together and shared a beach house in Malibu that became known as &quot;Bachelor Hall&quot;. They lived together off and on for 12 years; whether the relationship was romantic is a matter of biographical dispute. In 1944 Scott and Grant stopped living together, but they remained close for the rest of their lives.

Richard Blackwell, then an actor at RKO, Jerome Zerbe, a photographer who shot a series of publicity photographs of the couple in their home, and Scotty Bowers, a Hollywood pimp, all claimed to have slept with the pair. Blackwell wrote in his autobiography that Grant and Scott &quot;were deeply, madly in love, their devotion was complete.&quot; Biographer and friend of Grant&#x27;s, Bill Royce, claimed that in old age Grant confessed to him that he and Scott had been bisexual, and that their relationship was the first time he&#x27;d ever been in love, characterizing the memory as: &quot;Have you ever heard of gravity collapse?&quot;

Scott died of heart and lung ailments in 1987 at the age of 89 in Beverly Hills, California. He was interred at Elmwood Cemetery in Charlotte, North Carolina. He and his wife Patricia had been married for 43 years. She died in 2004 and is buried next to her husband. Their mid-century modern home was torn down in 2008. The Randolph Scott papers (which included photos, scrapbooks, notes, letters, articles and house plans) were left to the UCLA Library Special Collections.

==In popular culture==
Scott&#x27;s face reportedly was used as the model for the Oakland Raiders logo in 1960; the logo was re-designed in 1963. For more than 50 years, the iconic Raiders logo underwent only minor modifications and remained consistent with the original design.

He is caricatured in the Lucky Luke comic book album &quot;Le Vingtième de cavalerie&quot; (1965) as Colonel McStraggle.

Scott is the subject of a Rodney Dangerfield joke told on the 1981 NBC special &quot;The Stars Salute the President&quot;. In a veiled reference to Ronald Reagan (who was in attendance), Dangerfield muses how he is surprised he was invited to perform at the special, because he &quot;voted for Randolph Scott&quot; (both Reagan and Scott were actors in Westerns who later became involved in conservative politics).

==Awards==
In 1975, Scott was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States. He also received an In Memoriam Golden Boot Award for his work in Westerns.

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Scott has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6243 Hollywood Blvd. In 1999 a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.

==Politics==
Scott was an active Republican and a charter member of the Hollywood Republican Committee. In 1944, he attended the massive rally organized by David O. Selznick in the Los Angeles Coliseum in support of the Dewey-Bricker ticket as well as Governor Earl Warren of California, who would become Dewey&#x27;s running mate in 1948. The gathering drew 93,000, with Cecil B. DeMille as the master of ceremonies and short speeches by Hedda Hopper and Walt Disney. Among those in attendance were Ann Sothern, Ginger Rogers, Adolphe Menjou, and Gary Cooper. Scott also supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election and Ronald Reagan in the 1966 California gubernatorial election.

<doc id="158806" wikidata="Q189097" url="?curid=158806" title="Spanish peseta">
<text>The peseta (, ) was the currency of Spain between 1868 and 2002. Along with the French franc, it was also a &quot;de facto&quot; currency used in Andorra (which had no national currency with legal tender).

== Etymology ==

The name of the currency derives from &quot;peceta&quot;, a Catalan word meaning &quot;little piece,&quot; from of the Catalan word &quot;peça&quot; (lit. &quot;piece&quot;, &quot;coin&quot;). Its etymology has wrongly been attributed to the Spanish &quot;peso&quot;. The word &quot;peseta&quot; has been known as early as 1737 to colloquially refer to the coin worth 2 &quot;reales provincial&quot; or of a peso. Coins denominated in &quot;pesetas&quot; were briefly issued in 1808 in Barcelona under French occupation; see Catalan peseta.

== Symbol ==
Traditionally, there was never a single symbol or special character for the Spanish peseta. Common abbreviations were &quot;Pta&quot; (plural: &quot;Pts), &quot;Pt&quot;, and &quot;Ptas&quot;. A common way of representing amounts of pesetas in print was using superior letters: &quot;Pta&quot; and &quot;Pts&quot;.

Common Spanish models of mechanical typewriters had the expression &quot;Pts&quot; on a single type head, as a shorthand intended to fill a single type space () in tables instead of three ().

Later, Spanish models of IBM electric typewriters also included the same type in its repertoire.

When the first IBM PC was designed in 1980, it included a &quot;peseta symbol&quot; &quot;Pt&quot; in the ROM of the Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) and Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) video output cards&#x27; hardware, with the code number 158. This original character set chart later became the MS-DOS code page 437. Some spreadsheet software for PC under MS-DOS, as Lotus 1-2-3, employed this character as the peseta symbol in their Spanish editions. Subsequent international MS-DOS code pages, like code page 850 and others, deprecated this character in favour of some other national characters.

In order to guarantee the interchange with previous encodings such as code page 437, the international standard Unicode includes this character as U+20A7 PESETA SIGN in its Currency Symbols block. Other than that, the use of the &quot;peseta symbol&quot; standalone is extremely rare, and has been outdated since the adoption of the euro in Spain.

In the version 1.0 of Unicode the character ₧ U+20A7 PESETA SIGN had two reference glyphs: a &quot;Pts&quot; ligature glyph as in IBM code page 437 and an erroneous P with stroke. In Unicode 2.0 the reference glyph P with stroke was erroneously displayed as the only symbol for peseta and was later corrected to the Pts ligature and a separate character code was added for the peso sign.

==Subdivision==
The peseta was subdivided into 100 &quot;céntimos&quot; or, informally, 4 &quot;reales,&quot; which are the origin of the American quarter. The last coin of any value under one peseta was a 50 cts coin issued in 1980 to celebrate Spain&#x27;s hosting of the 1982 FIFA World Cup. The last 25-céntimo coin (or real) was dated 1959, the ten céntimos also dated 1959; both coins bore the portrait of Franco. The 1-céntimo coin was last minted in 1913 and featured King Alfonso XIII. The -céntimo coin was last minted in 1868 and featured Queen Isabel II.

== History ==

Currencies used in Spain before the peseta&#x27;s introduction in 1868 include:
* The &quot;maravedí&quot; from the 11th to 15th centuries.
* The original &quot;Spanish real&quot; (later, &quot;real nacional&quot;) introduced in the mid-14th century, which from 1497 was fixed at 34 maravedíes. Eight of these &quot;reales nacional&quot; were equal to the Spanish dollar, or &quot;peso&quot;, or &quot;duro&quot;.
* The &quot;real provincial&quot;, used only in Peninsular Spain and not its colonies, and valued at dollar.
* The &quot;real de vellón&quot;, another version of the &quot;real&quot; also exclusive to Peninsular Spain, issued prolifically in the 17th and 18th centuries, and valued much less than the above-mentioned &quot;reales&quot;. In 1737 it was finally fixed at th dollar. In 1850 it was divided decimally into 10 &quot;décimos&quot; or 100 &quot;céntimos&quot;.
* The short-lived &quot;silver escudo&quot; from 1864 to 1869, worth dollar and divided into 10 &quot;reales de vellón&quot; or 100 &quot;céntimos de escudo&quot;.

The peseta, previously not a monetary unit but a colloquial name for the coin worth of a peso, was formally introduced as a currency unit in 1868, at a time when Spain considered joining the Latin Monetary Union (LMU). Spain eventually decided not to formally join the LMU, although it did achieve alignment with the bloc. The Spanish Law of June 26, 1864 decreed that in preparation for joining the Latin Monetary Union (set up in 1865), the peseta became a subdivision of the Spanish peso with 1 &quot;peso duro&quot; = 5 &quot;pesetas&quot;. The peseta replaced all previous currencies denominated in &quot;silver escudos&quot; and &quot;reales de vellón&quot; at a rate of 5 &quot;pesetas&quot; = 1 &quot;peso duro&quot; = 2 &quot;silver escudos&quot; = 20 &quot;reales de vellón&quot;.

The peseta was equal to 4.5 grams of silver, or 0.290322 grams of gold, the standard used by all the currencies of the Latin Monetary Union. From 1873, only the gold standard applied.

In 1883 the peseta went off the gold standard and traded below parity with the gold French franc. However, as the free minting of silver was suspended to the general public, the peseta had a floating exchange rate between the value of the gold franc and the silver franc. The Spanish government captured all profits from minting &quot;duros&quot; (5-peseta coins) out of silver bought for less than Pts 5. While total issuance was limited to prevent the peseta from falling below the silver franc, the abundance of &quot;duros&quot; in circulation prevented the peseta from returning to par with the gold franc. Spain&#x27;s system where the silver &quot;duro&quot; trades at a premium above its metallic value due to relative scarcity is called the &quot;fiduciary standard&quot;.

The political turbulence of the early twentieth century (especially during the years after the World War I) caused the monetary union to break up, although it was not until 1927 that it officially ended.

During the Civil War (1936–1939), gold and silver coinage was withdrawn and copper-nickel coins were introduced. In 1959, Spain became part of the Bretton Woods System, pegging the peseta at a value of Pts 60 = US$1. In 1967, the peseta followed the devaluation of sterling, maintaining the exchange rate of Pts 168 = £1 stg. and establishing a new rate of Pts 70 = US$1.

High inflation was constant in Spain from the Civil War until the 1990s. After one century with the Pts 1,000 being the largest note, the Pts 5,000 note was introduced in 1976. A series of coins was issued to commemorate the 1982 FIFA World Cup held in Spain. All the fractional coinage was withdrawn in 1983; at the same time, Pts 2,000 and Pts 10,000 notes were introduced.

Pts 200 and Pts 500 notes were withdrawn in 1992 and replaced by coins, leaving Pts 1,000 as the smallest note. Coins ranged from Pta 1 to Pts 500. In that year, a series of coins commemorating 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona and Expo &#x27;92 in Seville were issued. Spain was hit heavily by the early 1990s recession and the peseta was devalued three times, the first of them being just after Black Wednesday, plummeting from Pts 100 to Pts 130 per US$1.

All Franco era coinage was withdrawn in 1997. The peseta linked its value with the euro coin on 1 January 1999, and hit rock bottom that year when Pts 200 were required to buy US$1. At the time Euro became a material coin, Pts 185.29 were needed to buy US$1, that is, 1.1743 euros.

The peseta was replaced by the euro in 2002, following the establishment of the euro in 1999. The exchange rate was €1 = Pts 166.386.

== Coins ==

From 1868 to 1982, a unique dating system for Spanish coins was employed. This would be adopted and sometimes abandoned intermittently during various times, and continued through to be used through the first years of Juan Carlos I&#x27;s reign. Although a common &quot;authorization date&quot; will be found on virtually all coins of this period on the obverse (front) of each coin, the actual date for many coins can be found inside a small six pointed star, typically on the reverse (back) of each coin, but sometimes the front. Therefore, the obverse date does not always reflect the actual date of mintage but rather a restriking of older obverse coin die designs. So, if the coin date shows 1959 up front but a tiny &quot;64&quot; is depicted in the six pointed star on the back, then the actual date of issue is in fact 1964 rather than the date depicted in front. This dating system would be abandoned in the early 1980s anticipating a one-by-one redesign of each coin denomination.

=== Decimal coinage of the monarchy ===

*No coins were issued by the short lived First Republic (1873–1874).

In 1869 and 1870, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 céntimos, and Pta 1, Pts 2, and Pts 5. The lowest four denominations were struck in copper (replaced by bronze from 1877), with the 20 cts, 50 cts, Pta 1 and Pts 2 struck in .835 silver and the Pts 5 struck in .900 silver. 5 cts and 10 cts coins were quickly nicknamed &quot;perra chica&quot; (small dog) and &quot;perra gorda&quot; (fat dog) respectively, as people then were unable to recognize the shape of the lion in them, mistaking it for a dog. The Pts 5 coin was nicknamed &quot;duro&quot; (hard), referencing the old &quot;peso duro&quot;. Pts 5 coins were called &quot;duros&quot; by every generation until the withdrawal of the peseta in 2002, and Spaniards would often informally account in that unit (e.g. using &#x27;20 duros&#x27; for Pts 100).

Gold Pts 25 coins were introduced in 1876, followed by Pts 10 in 1878. In 1889, Pts 20 coins were introduced, with production of the Pts 25 ceasing. In 1897, a single issue of gold Pts 100 was made. Production of gold coins ceased in 1904, followed by that of silver coins in 1910. The last bronze coins were issued in 1912.

Starting in 1906 a new series of 1 ctm and 2 cts coins were issued in bronze. Due to a number of economic issues these were the only two coins from this series.

Coin production resumed in 1925 with the introduction of cupronickel 25 cts. In 1926, a final issue of silver 50 cts was made, followed by the introduction of a holed version of the 25 cts in 1927.

=== The Second Republic and Civil War period ===

In 1934, the Second Spanish Republic issued its first coins in the denomination of 25 cts and 50 cts and Pta 1. The 25 cts and silver Pta 1 were the same size and composition as the earlier Royal issues, whilst the 50 cts was struck in copper. In 1937 a 5 cts coin was struck in iron and a new Pta 1 in brass. An iron 10 cts coin was also produced in 1938 but never issued into circulation, unknown whether due to its close resemblance to the  5cts or because the government of issue fell before it could be released. All of these replaced symbols and images related to the monarchy. The brass Pta 1 was sometimes nicknamed &quot;La Rubia&quot; (The Blonde), as it featured a woman&#x27;s face in a gold-coloured alloy.

=== Coins of the Nationalist State and World War II periods ===

The Nationalists issued their first official coins in 1937. These were holed 25 cts featuring a rising sun and a clutch of arrows. These coins were minted in Vienna. A smaller copper 25 cts followed in 1938. Following the end of the Civil War in 1939, the victorious Nationalist government introduced aluminium 5 cts and 10 cts in 1940 featuring a conquistador, followed by reduced size aluminium-bronze Pta 1 coins in 1944 featuring the state crest and national symbols.

During the Civil War, a number of local coinages were also issued by both Republican and Nationalist forces. In 1936, the following pieces were issued by the Nationalists:

The following issues were made by Republican forces in 1937:

=== Franco-era coinage ===

The first Pta 1 coins bearing the portrait of Francisco Franco were issued in 1947. Cupro-nickel Pts 5 followed in 1949. In 1949, holed cupro-nickel 50 cts were introduced, followed by aluminium-bronze Pts  in 1954, cupro-nickel Pts 25 and Pts 50 in 1958 and smaller aluminium 10 and 25 céntimos in 1959. Silver Pts 100 were issued between 1966 and 1969, with aluminium 50 céntimos introduced in 1967. In 1966 Franco&#x27;s profile was redesigned to depict a more recent representation of the dictator.

In the sport of 43-man squamish, developed in 1965 during the Francoist era and well before Spain&#x27;s transition to the euro, gameplay commences with the toss of &quot;a new Spanish peseta.&quot;

=== Restoration of democracy ===

When Juan Carlos became king, there were a few changes: the replacement of Franco&#x27;s portrait with that of Juan Carlos on the 50 cts and Pta 1 in 1975 and the addition of a cupro-nickel Pts 100 in 1976. 10 cts coins were discontinued. But there were bigger changes to each coin in 1982. Following this redesign the 50 cts was discontinued, and aluminium replaced aluminium bronze in the Pta 1. A Pts 2 coin was also introduced, featuring a map of Spain, though this denomination never became popular. More importantly, nickel-brass Pts 100 were introduced. The redesign centered around the 1982 FIFA World Cup and depicted football-related themes on the Pta 1, Pts 5, Pts 25, Pts 50, and Pts 100. Shortly afterwards, the large cupronickel Pts 100 was replaced by a smaller aluminium bronze coin, which also replaced the 100 ₧ banknote. A cupronickel Pts 10 was introduced in 1983, a denomination that had not been issued for many decades. This preceded a wholesale redesign in all circulating Spanish coins and abandonment of the &quot;star&quot; dating system. Cupronickel Pts 200 coins were introduced in 1986, followed by aluminium bronze Pts 500 in 1987.

In 1989 the biggest changes came. The size of the Pta 1 coin was significantly reduced. The Pts 2 coin was discontinued. Smaller aluminium bronze Pts 5 were introduced, and reduced aluminium bronze Pts 25 were also introduced which had a hole in the centre. Smaller Pts 50 coins were also issued the same year in cupronickel with the distinct Spanish flower shape that would eventually be used by many countries, most notably the 20-cent coin of the euro. At the same time, the Pts 200 coin was made larger and included an identifiable edge with incuse lettering. In 1999, a laser-etched hologram was added to the Pts 500 coin as a security feature to help discourage counterfeiting. During this period, all coins except the Pta 1 and Pts 500 went through a commemorative redesign each year, in a similar vein to the U.S. State commemorative quarters program, until they were discontinued in 2001 before the introduction of the euro common currency.

Until 19 June 2001, the following coins were minted by the Spanish Fábrica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre:

The Pts 50 coins issued between 1990 and 2000 were the first that featured the Spanish flower shape.
=== Spanish euro coins ===
Like all member nations, these coins come in denominations of 1, 2, and 5 cents in copper plated brass, 10, 20, and 50 cents in Nordic gold, and bimetallic 1 and 2 euros with a common reverse design. The obverse of the first three denominations feature Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, the 10, 20, and 50 cents depict Spanish poet-writer Miguel de Cervantes, and the 1 and 2 euros depict the effigy of King Juan Carlos I or King Felipe VI.

== Banknotes ==

In 1874, the Bank of Spain (&quot;Banco de España&quot; in Spanish) introduced notes for Pts 25, Pts 50, Pts 100, Pts 500 and Pts 1,000. Except for the Pts 250 notes only issued in 1878, the denominations produced by the Central Bank of Spain did not change until the Civil War, when both the Republicans and Nationalists issued Bank of Spain notes.

In 1936, the Republicans issued Pts 5 and Pts 10 notes. The Ministry of Finance (&quot;Ministerio de Hacienda&quot;) introduced notes for 50 cts, Pta 1 and Pts 2 in 1938, as well as issuing stamp money (consisting of postage or revenue stamps affixed to cardboard discs) in denominations of 5 cts, 10 cts, 15 cts, 20 cts, 25 cts, 30 cts, 40 cts, 45 cts, 50 cts and 60 cts.

The first Nationalist Bank of Spain issues were made in 1936, in denominations of Pts 5, Pts 10, Pts 25, Pts 50, Pts 100, Pts 500, and Pts 1,000. Pta 1 and Pts 2 notes were added in 1937. From the mid-1940s, denominations issued were Pta 1, Pts 5, Pts 25, Pts 50, Pts 100, Pts 500, and Pts 1,000. The Pta 1, Pts 5, Pts 25, and Pts 50 were all replaced by coins by the late 1950s.
In 1978, Pts 5,000 notes were introduced. The Pts 100 note was replaced by a coin in 1982, with Pts 1,000 notes introduced in 1983, Pts 200 in 1984 and Pts 10,000 in 1987. The Pts 200 and Pts 500 notes were replaced by coins in 1986 and 1987.

The final series of banknotes were introduced between 1982 and 1987 and remained legal tender until the introduction of the Euro.

The last banknotes series (1992) was:

== Andorran peseta ==

The Andorran peseta (ADP) (&quot;pesseta&quot; in Catalan) was pegged at 1:1 to the Spanish peseta. Following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War on 17 July 1936, the Andorran General Council issued Decree No. 112 of 19 December 1936, authorizing the issuance of paper money backed by Spanish banknotes.

There are two issues of Andorran pesetas, known as the Blue issues and the Brown issues. Both issues are dated 19 Desembre 1936 though the Brown issues were not issued until 19 December 1937. Both issues were withdrawn from circulation by 31 December 1938 and replaced with Spanish pesetas. None of the notes are signed.

All notes feature the coat of arms of Andorra on the front, along with text in Catalan indicating the value and issuer. On the back is the serial number and the issuing Decree in Catalan, in full on the Blue issues and in an abbreviated form on the Brown issues. Also on the back of the Brown issues is the coat of arms.
== Replacement by the euro ==

The peseta was replaced by the euro on 1 January 1999 on currency exchange boards. Euro coins and notes were introduced on 1 January 2002, and on 1 March 2002 the peseta lost its legal tender status in Spain, and also in Andorra. The conversion rate was €1 = Pts 166.386.

Peseta notes issued since 1939 and coins that were legal tender on 31 December 2001 remained exchangeable at any branch of the Spanish Central Bank until 30 June 2021. According to that entity, as of March 2011 pesetas to a value estimated at €1.7 billion had not been converted to euros.

<doc id="158814" wikidata="Q2078546" url="?curid=158814" title="Even Stevens">
<text>Even Stevens is an American comedy television series produced by Brookwell McNamara Entertainment that originally aired on Disney Channel from June 17, 2000, to June 2, 2003, airing a total of 65 episodes spanning three seasons. It follows the life of the Stevens, a family living in suburban Sacramento, California, mainly focusing on the clashing personalities of its two younger children, Ren and Louis.

The series was produced by Brookwell McNamara Entertainment. It is generally remembered for starring an adolescent Shia LaBeouf, before he achieved mainstream success as an actor. The show also features fast motion photography, which it employs in every episode.

The feature-length Disney Channel Original Movie based on the series, &quot;The Even Stevens Movie&quot;, premiered on June 13, 2003, and serves as the series finale. The show ended after reaching the 65-episode limit that Disney Channel had at the time.

==Premise==
The Stevens family live in Sacramento, California, where the two younger children in the family, Ren and Louis, who have opposing personalities, often clash.

==Episodes==

==Characters==

===Main===
* Louis Anthony Stevens (Shia LaBeouf) – Louis, the youngest Stevens sibling, is viewed as immature, rude, lazy, selfish, carefree, and extremely mischievous. He concocts elaborate schemes and inventions to make his life easier. His entire family is viewed as perfect next to him, which Louis resents. He is always pulling pranks with best friend Alan Twitty. His parents seem to favor his sister Ren and brother Donnie because of the great successes both have achieved, but his parents do love him dearly and try to defend him when possible. Louis tends to do &quot;gross&quot; things (weird faces, poor hygiene, picking nose, etc.), much to Ren’s annoyance. While he and Ren get on each other’s nerves all the time, Louis still cares for his sister and will sometimes help and support her. Tawny Dean becomes his girlfriend at the end of the series. His birthday is on June 27 (as shown in episode 33).
* Ren Stevens (Christy Carlson Romano) – An intelligent, well-behaved, perfectionist 8th-grader, Ren is the middle sibling and only daughter. She is the classic overachiever, constantly running for hall monitor and class president while trying to keep Louis&#x27;s schemes from becoming disasters and ruining her good-girl reputation. Despite her annoyance of Louis, Ren does care for her brother’s wellbeing and will often help him get out of trouble. She is the head newscaster for &quot;The Wombat Report&quot; and spent a few weeks on her school&#x27;s cheerleading squad. Ren is the editor of the school newspaper and the yearbook, a straight-A student, and Principal Wexler&#x27;s highly valued assistant. She destresses by singing karaoke. Despite her top-student ranking, Ren got sentenced to, and served, detention on at least one occasion. Ren&#x27;s favorite color is purple.
* Donnie Stevens (Nick Spano) – Ren and Louis&#x27; athletic big brother. Donnie is highly concerned with his appearance. His popularity, good looks, and superb athletic skills made him a heartthrob and legend at their school, even after his graduation. Although he excels in many sports, he&#x27;s an airhead and rarely knows what is going on.
* Steve Stevens (Tom Virtue) – A quirky lawyer and the patriarch of the Stevens family. He played college football for Michigan State University with the nickname &quot;Stiffie&quot; Stevens. He used to be a wrestler for his school.
* Eileen Stevens (Donna Pescow) – The matriarch of the Stevens family; a successful, no-nonsense, Jewish American state senator who launched a campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2002 and was narrowly defeated.
* Alan Twitty (A. J. Trauth) – Louis&#x27; closest best friend. Referred to as &quot;Twitty&quot; by his friends, he is similar to Louis but usually isn&#x27;t as extreme and often has to get Louis out of situations. He participates in sports such as basketball and baseball, plays guitar, and also cheers with girls. Twitty&#x27;s catch phrases are &quot;Dude&quot; and &quot;Sweet&quot;. When going undercover with Louis he goes by the name &quot;Lars Honeytoast.&quot;
* Tawny Dean (Margo Harshman) – Louis&#x27;s female best friend and eventually his girlfriend. At first, Tawny has no friends and is an outsider until she meets Louis. Tawny usually dresses in goth clothing, unlike her classmates, and refuses to conform to others&#x27; trivial pursuits. She is usually the voice of reason.
* Ruby Mendel (Lauren Frost) – Ren&#x27;s best friend who loves to gossip about crushes and dating couples. She once had a crush on Louis (while under the spell of a lucky penny), in the same episode that she had a crush on the boy band BBMak. Ruby&#x27;s in love with Tom Gribalski. Ruby speaks with a heavy Brooklyn accent.

===Recurring===
* Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Gribalski (Fred Meyers) – Louis&#x27; nerdy best friend. When Louis cooks up a scheme, Tom usually plays along with Ren Stevens. So, she can be his ex-girlfriend. Also, Tom speaks in a very scientific, philosophical, and intelligent manner. He is commonly the victim of many pranks by Louis and Twitty. He calls his mother by her name (Doris). In season 3, Doris is seen playing the piano when Tom auditions for SACCY, a performing arts school.
* Monique Taylor (Kenya Williams) – Ren&#x27;s other best friend. Monique is a perky cheerleader. Monique takes many things to extreme limits. She has a strong Southern accent.
* Nelson Minkler (Gary LeRoi Gray) – Ren&#x27;s childhood best friend who seems to be allergic to everything and overprotects himself when he&#x27;s outside. He is usually with Ren, and at times Donnie, but has spoken to Louis only once. He is fluent in French. Nelson was also Gray&#x27;s character&#x27;s name on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; as a child.
* Bernard &quot;Beans&quot; Aranguren (Steven Anthony Lawrence) – The Stevens&#x27; extremely annoying neighbor, who comes into their home uninvited, makes himself at home, and refuses to leave. His love for bacon is a recurring theme, and in &quot;Little Mr. Sacktown&quot; he visits a bacon shack. He eventually turns into a sidekick for Louis and Twitty&#x27;s schemes, usually double-crossing the two.
* Lawrence Anthony &quot;Larry&quot; Beale (Ty Hodges) – Ren&#x27;s nasty, equally-popular, charismatic, know-it-all rival in school. Larry hates Ren and always tries to destroy her reputation, but his schemes usually backfire. His favorite victim is Ren, but he occasionally tries to ruin Louis as well. Larry is secretly jealous of Ren and considers Louis a threat, but will never admit it. Larry is an Army brat. In the movie, he hinted he might even have romantic feelings for her, as he shows a bit of jealousy when it showed that Ren was sharing a kiss with an actor.
* Coach Terry Tugnut (Jim Wise) – The gym coach who is always tough on Louis but crazy about Donnie, Larry, and food. He loves to eat. Once he weighed over 300 lbs. He is frequently the victim of Louis&#x27; pranks. Coach Tugnut often serves as Wexler&#x27;s enforcer/sidekick. He is obsessed with dodgeball and with the three &quot;major points&quot; (arm, head, stomach). A running gag throughout the series is Coach Tugnut shouting, &quot;Stevens!&quot; when Louis causes trouble.
* Conrad Wexler (George Anthony Bell) – The principal of Lawrence Jr High. Principal Wexler favors Ren over the other students. They have had arguments, but they&#x27;re good friends. Ren is his student assistant, while Louis drives him crazy. He usually makes Ren do his dirty work.
* Carla and Marla (Lisa Foiles and Krysten Leigh Jones) – Two girls who look up to Ren. Carla and Marla are both on the newspaper staff with Ren and Ruby. After the episode &quot;Quest for Coolness&quot;, Carla and Marla are never seen or mentioned again.
* Bobby Deaver (Brandon Davis) – Ren&#x27;s middle-school boyfriend; he appeared in seven episodes. Ren broke up with Bobby when he was cheating on her by dating Mandy Sanchez, a rival of Ren&#x27;s. But, Louis convince her to be Tom Gribalski&#x27;s girlfriend.
* Ivan (Eric Jungmann) – Larry Beale&#x27;s yes-man sidekick in the first season, although he occasionally serves as a yes-man for other popular kids, such as Blake Thompson in the episode &quot;Louis in the Middle&quot;.

==Production==
The show was originally produced as a show called &quot;Spivey&#x27;s Kid Brother&quot;. A pilot was filmed in July 1999, and was later picked up by Disney Channel as &quot;Even Stevens&quot;. In the episode &quot;A Weak First Week&quot; (where the original pilot was repurposed as flashback sequences), Disney had to dub out the name &quot;Spivey&quot; to &quot;Stevens&quot;. In fact, in the gym class scene, a banner is visible in the background reading, &quot;Home of Spivey and the Wild Wombats.&quot;

In the theme song of the show, clay animations of Louis and Ren turn their remote controls into lightsabers, alluding to &quot;Star Wars&quot;, several years before Disney would purchase the franchise. Prior to this, Ren reads a TV guide with live-action photos of Christy Carlson Romano and Shia LaBeouf on the cover.

Lawrence Junior High is apparently a standard three-grade junior high school. Although the show lasted three seasons, the timeline of the show is only two school years, with Louis and his friends remaining in the 7th grade until some point after the middle of the second season. In several third-season episodes there are subtle references to an advance in the timeline that puts Ren and her friends in the 9th grade and Louis in the 8th grade. Ren finally graduates in &quot;The Even Stevens Movie&quot;.

Shia LaBeouf and Christy Carlson Romano are the only two actors to appear in all 65 episodes of the series.

In 2002, the musical episode &quot;Influenza: The Musical&quot; aired as part of the program&#x27;s second season, which was viewed favourably by the audience and network executives. Several cast members had backgrounds on Broadway as well as professional dance training. McNamara had done musical theatre in high school and directed the episode, while Brookwell cited the &quot;musical episode&quot; as a television convention. Brookwell stated that network executives were initially unsure that a musical episode would be successful and were uninterested in the subgenre, but the idea was ultimately approved. The success of the musical format led to the idea being adopted on Brookwell and McNamara&#x27;s other comedy series &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot;. It also inspired the development of the television film &quot;High School Musical&quot;, which then-president of Disney Channels Worldwide Gary Marsh said would not have been possible if not for the success of the &quot;Even Stevens&quot; episode.

The series was produced and distributed by Disney in North America, while Fireworks Entertainment distributes the series in all other territories.

==Broadcast==
The series reran on Disney Channel from June 2, 2003 to September 4, 2006. On July 7, 2007, Disney Channel aired eight episodes as part of their &quot;Sometimes You Win, Sometimes You Louis&quot; marathon, to coincide with the release of Shia LaBeouf&#x27;s film &quot;Transformers&quot;.

In 2006, Superstation WGN (now NewsNation) acquired the rights to &quot;Even Stevens&quot; and &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;. It aired on the channel from September 18, 2006 to September 12, 2008, during the week originally airing after each other on weekday afternoons before moving to the late night hours, when both shows&#x27; target audiences were generally not awake, with &quot;Stevens&quot; airing Tuesdays and Thursdays and &quot;Lizzie&quot; airing the rest of the week.

In 2009, &quot;Even Stevens&quot; began airing on Disney XD; it was removed from the channel in January 2010.

From 2015 to 2016, &quot;Even Stevens&quot; aired on Freeform for two hours after midnight on Wednesdays as part of the &quot;That&#x27;s So Throwback&quot; block. In the UK, on April 30, 2001, it was reported that the BBC had acquired terrestrial rights to air and re-air the show on CBBC with 21 episodes in 30 minute formats of the show being scheduled to first air later that same year, after having secured a deal with Fireworks Entertainment. All episodes of the show were eventually aired before being re- broadcast on CBBC until December 20, 2008 at 15:00pm. Sometime in 2009, CITV also acquired rights to the show and aired and re-aired the show until sometime in January 2013, taking it off schedule just one week before the rebrand of the channel that same year. The show currently is no longer airing on television.

The series released on November 12, 2019 with the launch of Disney+ in the United States. It is currently not available in all territories where the platform has launched due to different distribution rights in many countries.

<text>A transect is a path along which one counts and records occurrences of the objects of study (e.g. plants).

It requires an observer to move along a fixed path and to count occurrences along the path and, at the same time (in some procedures), obtain the distance of the object from the path. This results in an estimate of the area covered and an estimate of the way in which detectability increases from probability 0 (far from the path) towards 1 (near the path). Using the raw count and this probability function, one can arrive at an estimate of the actual density of objects.
The estimation of the abundance of populations (such as terrestrial mammal species) can be achieved using a number of different types of transect methods, such as strip transects, line transects, belt transects, point transects, gradsects and curved line transects.
