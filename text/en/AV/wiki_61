<text>The Malacca Sultanate (; Jawi script: ) was a Malay sultanate based in the modern-day state of Malacca, Malaysia. Conventional historical thesis marks as the founding year of the sultanate by King of Singapura, Parameswara, also known as Iskandar Shah, although earlier dates for its founding have been proposed. At the height of the sultanate&#x27;s power in the 15th century, its capital grew into one of the most important transshipment ports of its time, with territory covering much of the Malay Peninsula, the Riau Islands and a significant portion of the northern coast of Sumatra in present-day Indonesia.

As a bustling international trading port, Malacca emerged as a centre for Islamic learning and dissemination, and encouraged the development of the Malay language, literature and arts. It heralded the golden age of Malay sultanates in the archipelago, in which Classical Malay became the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of Maritime Southeast Asia and Jawi script became the primary medium for cultural, religious and intellectual exchange. It is through these intellectual, spiritual and cultural developments, that the Malaccan era witnessed the establishment of a Malay identity, the Malayisation of the region and the subsequent formation of the Malay world.

In 1511, the capital of Malacca fell to the Portuguese Empire, forcing the last Sultan, Mahmud Shah (), to retreat south, where his progenies established new ruling dynasties, Johor and Perak. The political and cultural legacy of the sultanate has endured for centuries, where Malacca has been held up as an example of Malay-Muslim civilisation to this day. It established systems of trade, diplomacy, and governance that persisted well into the 19th century, and introduced concepts such as —a distinctly Malay notion of sovereignty—that continues to shape contemporary understanding of Malay kingship.

==History==

===Early foundation===
The founding of Malacca is generally taken to be . The region was dominated by the Srivijaya empire centered on Palembang in Sumatra until it was weakened by the Chola Empire in the 11th century. By the end of the 13th century, the Javanese Singhasari followed by the Majapahit had become dominant.

According to the &quot;Malay Annals&quot;, a prince from Palembang named Seri Teri Buana who claimed to be a descendant of Alexander the Great and Rajendra Chola I, stayed on Bintan Island for several years before he set sail and landed on Temasek in 1299. The Orang Laut, known for their loyal services to Srivijaya, eventually made him king of a new kingdom called Singapura. In the 14th century, Singapura developed concurrently with the Pax Mongolica era and rose from a small trading outpost into a centre of international trade with strong ties to the Yuan dynasty.

In an effort to revive the fortune of Malayu in Sumatra, in the 1370s, a Malay ruler of Palembang sent an envoy to the court of the first emperor of the newly established Ming dynasty. He invited China to resume the tributary system, just like Srivijaya did centuries earlier. Learning of this diplomatic maneuver, King Hayam Wuruk of Majapahit sent an envoy to Nanking and convinced the emperor that Malayu was their vassal, and not an independent country. Subsequently, in 1377—a few years after the death of Gajah Mada, Majapahit sent a punitive naval attack against a rebellion in Palembang, which caused the diaspora of the Palembang princes and nobles.

By the second half of the 14th century, the Kingdom of Singapura grew wealthy. However, its success alarmed two regional powers at that time, Ayutthaya to the north and Majapahit to the south. As a result, the kingdom&#x27;s fortified capital was attacked by at least two major foreign invasions before it was finally sacked by either Ayutthaya or Majapahit in 1398. The last king of Singapura then fled to the west coast of the Malay Peninsula.

Malay and Portuguese sources give different accounts of the fall of Singapura and its last king. In Portuguese sources, he is referred to as Parameswara and originated in Palembang but usurped the throne of Singapura, but in Malay sources he is Iskandar Shah, a descendant Seri Teri Buana who became the fifth king of Singapura. Parameswara fled north to Muar, Ujong Tanah and Biawak Busuk before reaching a fishing village at the mouth of Bertam River (modern-day Malacca River). The village belonged to the Orang Laut who were left alone by Majapahit&#x27;s forces that not only sacked Singapura but also Langkasuka and Pasai. As a result, the village became a safe haven and in the 1370s it began to receive a growing number of refugees fleeing Majapahit&#x27;s attacks. By the time Parameswara reached Malacca in the early 1400s, the place was already cosmopolitan feel with Buddhists from the north, Hindus from Palembang and Muslims from Pasai.

Legend has it that Parameswara saw a mouse deer outwit his hunting dog into the water when he was resting under the Malacca tree. He thought this bode well, stating, &quot;this place is excellent, even the mouse deer is formidable; it is best that we establish a kingdom here&quot;. Tradition holds that he named the settlement after the tree he was leaning against while witnessing the portentous event. Today, the mouse deer is part of modern Malacca&#x27;s coat of arms. The name &quot;Malacca&quot; itself was derived from the fruit-bearing Melaka tree () scientifically termed as &quot;Phyllanthus emblica&quot;. Another theory to the origin of Malacca&#x27;s name is that it originated from Arab merchants, during the reign of Sultan Muhammad Shah (), who called the kingdom &quot;Malakat&quot; (Arabic for &quot;congregation of merchants&quot;) because it was home to many trading communities.

===Growth===
Following the establishment of his new city in Malacca, Parameswara began to develop the city and laid the foundation of a trade port. The Orang Laut, were employed to patrol the adjacent sea areas, to repel pirates, and to direct traders to Malacca. Within years, news about Malacca becoming a centre of trade and commerce began to spread across the eastern part of the world. In 1405, the Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty () sent his envoy headed by Yin Qing to Malacca. Yin Qing&#x27;s visit paved the way for the establishment of friendly relations between Malacca and China. Two years later, Admiral Zheng He made his first of six visits to Malacca. Zheng He called at Malacca and brought Parameswara with him on his return to China, a recognition of his position as ruler of Malacca. In exchange for regular tribute, the Chinese emperor offered Malacca protection from the constant threat of Siamese attack. Due to Chinese involvement, Malacca had grown as a key alternative to other important and established ports. Chinese merchants began calling at the port and pioneering foreign trading bases in Malacca. Other foreign traders, notably the Arabs, Indians, and Persians came to establish their trading bases and settle in Malacca, raising its population to 2,000. In 1411, Parameswara headed a royal party of 540 people and left for China with Admiral Zheng He to visit the Ming court. In 1414, the &quot;Ming Shilu&quot; mentions that the son of the first ruler of Malacca visited the Ming court to inform Yongle that his father had died.

There is uncertainty in the chronology of the early rulers of Malacca due to discrepancies contained in Malay, Chinese and Portuguese sources, such as the names, number of rulers and reign details:

Due to the differences, there are disagreements about the early rulers of Malacca. It is, however, generally accepted that the Parameswara of Portuguese and Chinese sources and Iskandar Shah of the &quot;Malay Annals&quot; were the same person, but a number of authors also accept the similarly named Megat Iskandar Shah as Parameswara&#x27;s son. During the reign of Megat Iskandar Shah (), the kingdom continued to prosper, the Sultan&#x27;s control spread from Kuala Linggi to Kuala Kesang, roughly corresponding to the modern state of Malacca. The period saw the diversification of economic sources of the kingdom with the discovery of two tin mining areas in the northern part of the city, sago palms in the orchards and nipah palms lining in the estuaries and beaches. To improve the defence mechanism of the city from potential aggressors, Megat Iskandar Shah ordered the construction of a wall surrounding the city with four guarded entrances. A fenced fortress was also built in the town centre where the state&#x27;s treasury and supply were stored. The growth of Malacca coincided with the rising power of Ayutthaya to the north. The growing ambitions of Ayutthaya against its neighbours and the Malay Peninsula had alarmed the ruler of Malacca. In a preemptive measure, the king headed a royal visit to China in 1418 to raise his concerns about the threat. Yongle responded in October 1419 by sending his envoy to warn the Siamese ruler. Relationship between China and Malacca were further strengthened by several envoys to China, led by the Malaccan princes, in 1420, 1421 and 1423.
Between 1424 and 1433, two more royal visits to China were made during the reign of the third ruler, Raja Tengah (), named Sri Maharaja in some sources. During Raja Tengah&#x27;s rule, it was said that an ulama called Saiyid Abdul Aziz came to Malacca to spread the teaching of Islam. The king together with his royal family, senior officials and the subjects of Malacca listened to his teachings. Shortly after, Raja Tengah adopted the Muslim name, Muhammad Shah and the title &quot;Sultan&quot; on the advice of the ulama. He began to Islamise his administration—customs, royal protocols, bureaucracy and commerce were made to conform to the principles of Islam. As Malacca became increasingly important as an international trading centre, the equitable regulation of trade was the key to continued prosperity—and the &quot;Undang-Undang Laut Melaka&quot; (Maritime Laws of Malacca), promulgated during the reign of Sultan Muhammad Shah, was an important facet of this. So too was the appointment of four &quot;Shahbandars&quot; for the different communities of the port. This accommodated foreign traders, who were also assigned their own enclaves in the city. In the 1430s, China had reversed its policy of maritime expansion. However, by then Malacca was strong enough militarily to defend itself. In spite of these developments, China maintained a continuous show of friendship, suggesting that it placed Malacca in high regard. In fact, although it was China&#x27;s practice to consider most foreign countries as vassal states – including Italy and Portugal – its relations with Malacca were characterised by mutual respect and friendship, such as that between two sovereign countries.

Muhammad Shah died in 1444 after reigning for twenty years and left behind two sons; Raja Kasim, the son of Tun Wati who in turn a daughter of a wealthy Indian merchant, and Raja Ibrahim, the son of the Princess of Rokan. He was succeeded by his younger son, Raja Ibrahim, who reigned as Sultan Abu Syahid Shah (). Abu Syahid was a weak ruler and his administration was largely controlled by Raja Rokan, a cousin of his mother who stayed in the court of Malacca during his reign. The situation prompted court officials to plan the assassination of Raja Rokan and to install Raja Kasim on the throne. Both the Sultan and Raja Rokan were eventually killed in the attack in 1446. Raja Kasim was then appointed as the fifth ruler of Malacca and reign as Sultan Muzaffar Shah (). The looming threat from the Siamese kingdom of Ayutthaya became a reality when it launched a land invasion of Malacca in 1446. Tun Perak, the chief of Klang brought his men to help Malacca in the battle against the Siamese, in which Malacca emerged victorious. His strong leadership qualities gained the attention of the Sultan, whose desire to see Malacca prosper made him appoint Tun Perak as the &quot;Bendahara&quot;. In 1456, during the reign of King Trailokanat, Ayutthaya launched another attack, this time by sea. When news about the attack reached Malacca, naval forces were immediately rallied and a defensive line was made near Batu Pahat. The forces were commanded by Tun Perak and assisted by Tun Hamzah, a warrior known as Datuk Bongkok. The two sides clashed in a fierce naval battle in which the more advanced Malaccan navy succeeded in driving off the Siamese, pursuing them to Singapura and forcing them to return home. Malacca&#x27;s victory in this battle gave it new confidence to devise strategies to extend its influence throughout the region. The defeat of Ayutthaya brought political stability to Malacca and enhanced its reputation in South East Asia.

=== Golden era ===
Malacca reached its height of glory between the mid to late 15th century up to before the Portuguese occupation. The reign of Sultan Muzaffar Shah saw the territorial incorporation of the region between Dindings and Johor, and was the first Malaccan ruler to impose authority over both the western and eastern ends of the Malay Peninsula. The kingdom controlled a section of global trade on a vital choke point; the narrow strait that today bears its name, the Strait of Malacca. Its port city had become the centre of regional and international trade, attracting regional traders as well as traders from major states such as the Chinese Ming dynasty, the Ryukyu Kingdom as well as Persians, Gujarats and Arabs.

The reign of Mansur Shah () witnessed a major expansion of the sultanate. Among the earliest territory ceded to the sultanate was Pahang, with its capital, Inderapura—a massive unexplored land with a large river and abundant source of gold which was ruled by Maharaja Dewa Sura, a relative of the King of Ligor. The Sultan dispatched a fleet of two hundred ships, led by Tun Perak and 19 Malaccan hulubalangs. On reaching Pahang, a battle broke out in which the Pahangites were decisively defeated and its entire royal court were captured. The Malaccan fleet returned home with Dewa Sura and his daughter, Wanang Seri who were handed over to Sultan Mansur Shah. The Sultan appointed Tun Hamzah to rule Pahang. A policy of rapprochement with Ligor was later initiated by Mansur Shah to ensure steady supplies of rice.

On his royal visit to Majapahit, Mansur Shah was also accompanied by these warriors. At that time, Majapahit was already declining and found itself unable to overcome the rising power of the Malaccan Sultanate. After a display of Malaccan military prowess in his court, the king of Majapahit, afraid of losing more territories, agreed to marry off his daughter, Raden Galuh Cendera Kirana to Sultan Mansur Shah and hand over control of Indragiri, Jambi, Tungkal and Siantan to Malacca. Mansur Shah was also able to vassalise Siak in Sumatra. Later in his reign, Pahang, Kampar and Indragiri rebelled but were eventually subdued.

The friendly relations between China and Malacca escalated during the reign of Sultan Mansur Shah. The Sultan sent an envoy headed by Tun Perpatih Putih to China, carrying a diplomatic letter from the Sultan to the Emperor. According to the &quot;Malay Annals&quot;, Tun Perpatih succeeded in impressing the Emperor of China with the fame and grandeur of Sultan Mansur Shah that the Emperor decreed that his daughter, Hang Li Po, should marry the Sultan. The &quot;Malay Annals&quot; further asserts that a senior minister of state and five hundred ladies in waiting accompanied the &quot;princess&quot; to Malacca. The Sultan built a palace for his new consort on a hill known ever afterwards as Bukit Cina (&quot;Chinese Hill&quot;). As trade flourished and Malacca became more prosperous, Mansur Shah ordered the construction of a large and beautiful palace at the foot of Malacca Hill. The royal palace reflected the wealth, prosperity and power of Malacca and embodied the excellence and distinct characteristics of Malay architecture.

The brief conflict between Malacca and Đại Việt during the reign of Lê Thánh Tông (), began shortly after the 1471 Vietnamese invasion of Champa, then already a Muslim kingdom. The Chinese government, without knowing about the event, sent a censor Ch&#x27;en Chun to Champa in 1474 to install the Champa King, but he discovered Vietnamese soldiers had taken over Champa and were blocking his entry. He proceeded to Malacca instead and its ruler sent back tribute to China. In 1469, Malaccan envoys on their return from China was attacked by the Vietnamese who castrated the young and enslaved them. In view of the Lê dynasty&#x27;s position as a protectorate to China, Malacca abstained from any act of retaliation. Instead, Malacca sent envoys to China in 1481 to report on the Vietnamese aggression and their invasion plan against Malacca, as well as to confront the Vietnamese envoys who happened to be present in the Ming court. However, the Chinese informed that since the incident was years old, they could do nothing about it, and the Chinese Emperor Chenghua sent a letter to the Vietnamese ruler reproaching him for the incident. The Emperor also granted permission for Malacca to retaliate with violent force should the Vietnamese attack, an event that never happened again. An unsubstantiated Chinese account reported that Lê Thánh Tông led 90,000 men on an invasion to Lan Sang but this force was chased away by a Malaccan army that beheaded 30,000 Đại Việt soldiers.
The expansionist policy of Mansur Shah was maintained throughout his reign when he later added Kampar and Siak to his realm. He also turned a number of states in the archipelago into his imperial dependencies. The ruler of such states would come to Malacca after their coronation to obtain the blessing of the Sultan of Malacca. Rulers who had been overthrown also came to Malacca requesting the Sultan&#x27;s aid in reclaiming their throne. One such examples was Sultan Zainal Abidin of Pasai who was toppled by his relatives. He fled to Malacca and pleaded with Sultan Mansur Shah to reinstall him as a ruler. Malacca armed forces were immediately sent to Pasai and defeated the usurpers. Although Pasai never came under the control of Malacca afterwards, the event greatly demonstrated the importance of Malacca and the mutual support it had established among leaders and states in the region. Sultan Mansur Shah died in 1477 whilst Malacca was at the peak of its splendour.

The prosperous era of Malacca continued under the rule of his son, Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah () and more foreign rulers within the region began paying homage to the Sultan of Malacca. Among them were a ruler from the Moluccas who were defeated by his enemies, a ruler of Rokan and a ruler named Tuan Telanai from Terengganu. Alauddin Riayat Shah placed a great importance in maintaining peace and order during his reign. He extended the conquests of his father to include the Riau-Lingga islands. He was succeeded by his son, Sultan Mahmud Shah () who was a teenage boy upon his accession. Hence Malacca was administered by Bendahara Tun Perak with the help of other senior officials. The town of Malacca continued to prosper with an influx of foreign traders after the appointment of Tun Mutahir as Bendahara. This was due to his efficient and wise administration and his ability to attract more foreign traders to Malacca. By about 1500, Malacca was at the height of its power and glory, this can be exemplified by Mahmud Shah&#x27;s rejection of the overlordship of both Ayutthaya and the declining Majapahit. Its city of Malacca was the chief centre of trade in Indian cloth, Chinese porcelain and silk and Malay spices, and the headquarters of Muslim activity in the Malay Archipelago. Malacca was still looking to expand its territory as late as 1506, when it conquered Kelantan. While the legendary Princess of Gunung Ledang was said to have lived during the reign of Mahmud Shah and was once wooed by the sultan himself.

===Portuguese invasion===
By the 15th century, Europe had developed an appetite for spices. At that time, the spice trade was virtually monopolised by Venetian merchants via a convoluted trade route through the Arabian Peninsula and India, which in turn linked to its source in the Maluku Islands via Malacca. Upon becoming king in 1481, John II of Portugal decided to break this chain and control the lucrative spice trade directly from its source. This led to the expansion of Portuguese sea exploration, pioneered by Vasco da Gama, into the east coasts of India that resulted in the establishment of Portuguese stronghold in Calicut.

Years later, during the reign of Manuel I, a fidalgo named Diogo Lopes de Sequeira was assigned to analyse trade potential in Madagascar and Malacca. He arrived in Malacca on 1 August 1509 carrying with him a letter from the King. His mission was to establish trade with Malacca. The Tamil Muslims who were now powerful in the Malaccan court and friendly with Tun Mutahir, the Bendahara, were hostile towards the Christian Portuguese. The Gujarati merchants who were also Muslims and had known the Portuguese in India, preached a holy war against &quot;the infidels&quot;. Because of the dissension between Mahmud Shah and Tun Mutahir, a plot was hatched to kill de Sequeira, imprison his men and capture the Portuguese fleet anchored off the Malacca River. The plot leaked out and de Sequeira managed to escape from Malacca in his ship, leaving behind several of his men who were taken captive.

In April 1511 Afonso de Albuquerque, who was the Portuguese expedition leader together with his armada, arrived in Malacca to sever its Islamic and Venetian trade. His intention was described in his own words when he arrived to Malacca:

The Portuguese launch their first attack on 25 July 1511, but this was met with failure. Albuquerque then launched another attack on 15 August 1511, which proved successful as Malacca was captured on that day. The Portuguese constructed a fortress called A Famosa using rocks and stones taken from Muslim graves, mosques, and other buildings. Several churches and convents, a bishop&#x27;s palace, and administrative buildings such as the governor&#x27;s palace were built. The Portuguese imposed higher taxes on Chinese traders and restricted their ownership of land. The news of the city&#x27;s capture reached the Ming dynasty of China; the Chinese were also displeased about the kidnapping of many Chinese children by the Portuguese in Tuen Mun. In retaliation for Portugal&#x27;s activity in Malacca, several Portuguese were later killed by the Chinese in the battles of Tunmen and Xicaowan in China.

==Aftermath (Post-1511)==

===Portuguese Malacca===
Following the 1511 conquest, the city of Malacca remained under Portuguese control for the next 130 years despite incessant attempts by the former rulers of Malacca and other regional powers to dislodge them (see Malay–Portuguese conflicts). Around the foothill on which the Sultan&#x27;s &quot;Istana&quot; (palace) once stood, the Portuguese built the stone fort known as A Famosa, completed in 1512. Malay graves, the mosque and other buildings were dismantled to obtain the stone that was used to build the fort. Despite numerous attacks, the fort was only breached once, when the Dutch and Johor defeated the Portuguese in 1641.

It soon became clear that Portuguese control of Malacca did not mean they controlled the Asian trade centred on it. Their rule in Malacca was marred with difficulties. They could not become self-sufficient and remained highly dependent on Asian suppliers, as had their Malay predecessors. They were short of both funds and manpower and the administration was hampered by organizational confusion and command overlap, corruption and inefficiency. Competition from other regional ports such as Johor which was founded by the exiled Sultan of Malacca, saw Asian traders bypass Malacca and the city began to decline as a trading port. Rather than achieving their ambition of dominating it, the Portuguese had fundamentally disrupted the organisation of the Asian trade network. The previously centralised port of exchange that policed the Strait of Malacca to maintain its safety for commercial traffic, was replaced with scattered trading network with multiple ports rivalling each other in the strait.

The efforts to propagate Christianity which was also one of the principal aims of Portuguese imperialism did not, meet with much success, primarily because Islam was already strongly entrenched among the local population.

===Chinese retaliation===
The Portuguese conquest of Malacca enraged the Zhengde Emperor of China when he received the envoys from the exiled Sultan Mahmud. The furious Chinese emperor responded with force, culminating in a period of persecution of Portuguese in China which lasted three decades.

Among the earliest victims were the Portuguese envoys led by Tomé Pires in 1516 that were greeted with great hostility and suspicion. The Chinese confiscated all of the Portuguese property and goods in the Pires&#x27; embassy&#x27;s possession. Many of the envoys were imprisoned, tortured and executed. Pires himself was said to be among those who died in the Chinese dungeons. Two successive Portuguese fleets bound for China in 1521 and 1522 were attacked and defeated in the first and second Battle of Tamao.

In response to Portuguese piracy and the illegal installation of bases in Fujian at Wuyu island, Yue harbour at Zhangzhou, Shuangyu island in Zhejiang, and Nan&#x27;ao island in Guangdong, the Imperial Chinese Right Deputy Commander Zhu Wan killed all the pirates and razed the Shuangyu Portuguese base, using force to prohibit trading with foreigners by sea. Moreover, Chinese traders boycotted Malacca after it fell under Portuguese control, with some Chinese in Java even assisting in Muslim attempts to invade the city.

Relations gradualy improved and aid was given against the Japanese Wokou pirates along China&#x27;s shores. By 1557 Ming China agreed to allow the Portuguese to settle at Macau in a new Portuguese trade colony. The Malay Sultanate of Johor also improved relations with the Portuguese.

===Successor of Malacca===
The exiled Sultan Mahmud Shah made several attempts to retake the capital but his efforts were fruitless. The Portuguese retaliated and forced the Sultan to flee to Pahang. Later, the Sultan sailed to Bintan and established his capital there. From the new base, the Sultan rallied the disarrayed Malay forces and organised several attacks and blockades against the Portuguese&#x27;s position. Frequent raids on Malacca caused the Portuguese severe hardship and helped convince the Portuguese that the exiled Sultan&#x27;s forces needed to be destroyed. A number of attempts were made to suppress the Malay forces but were unsuccessful, until 1526 when the Portuguese razed Bintan. The Sultan retreated to Kampar in Sumatra where he died two years later. He left behind two sons named Muzaffar Shah and Alauddin Riayat Shah II.

Muzaffar Shah was invited by the people in the north of the peninsula to become their ruler, establishing the Sultanate of Perak. Meanwhile, Mahmud Shah&#x27;s other son, Alauddin succeeded his father and established the Sultanate of Johor. Malacca was later conquered by the Dutch in a joint military campaign in January 1641. The Portuguese fortress, did not fall to the force of Dutch or Johorean arms as much as to famine and disease that decimated the surviving population. As a result of mutual agreement between the Dutch and Johor earlier in 1606, Malacca was handed over to the Dutch.

The fall of Malacca benefited other kingdoms such as Brunei whose ports became a new entrepôt as the kingdom emerged as a new center of trade in the Malay Archipelago, attracting many Muslim traders who fled from the Portuguese occupation after the ruler of Brunei&#x27;s conversion to Islam.

==Administration==

Malacca had a well-defined government with a set of laws. At the top of the sultanate&#x27;s hierarchy sat the Sultan who was an absolute monarch. The earlier Srivijayan concept of kingship in which the king&#x27;s right to rule was based on legitimate lineage still prevailed, and with the coming of Islam, it was reintroduced with the name &quot;daulat&quot; (sovereignty). Malacca&#x27;s legal codes identified four main state officials appointed by the Sultan.

Below the Sultan was a Bendahara, a position similar to that of a vizier, who acted as an advisor to the Sultan. It was the highest-ranking office that could be held by any common people in Malacca. The Bendahara was also responsible for ensuring cordial relations with foreign states. Malacca&#x27;s fifth Bendahara, Tun Perak, excelled in both war and diplomacy. Twice during the reign of Sultan Muzaffar Shah, Tun Perak successfully led Malaccan armed forces in repelling Siamese attacks on Malacca. When Sultan Mansur Shah ascended the throne, acting on Tun Perak&#x27;s advice, he agreed to dispatch a peace envoy to Siam. Tun Perak also advised the Sultan to marry the daughter of the King of Majapahit, Malacca&#x27;s traditional enemy.

Next to the Bendahara was a state treasurer, called the &quot;Penghulu bendahari&quot;. Next was the Temenggung which was comparable to a chief of public police and state security. After the Temenggung was the Laksamana. The Laksamana was the head of the navy and also the chief emissary of the Sultan. He ensured that the Malacca Strait was safe and enforced the &quot;Undang-Undang Laut Melaka&quot; (Maritime Laws of Malacca). Malacca&#x27;s most prominent Laksamana was Hang Tuah. At the bottom of this nobility structure were the four Shahbandars (&#x27;harbour masters&#x27;) for the different communities in the port—one focused exclusively on handling the affairs of the Gujarati traders; another was responsible for traders from Southern India, Bengal, Burma and Pasai; a third for traders from Maritime Southeast Asia; and fourth for traders from Annam, China and the Ryukyu Islands. Lesser titled state officials were also appointed. They were known as the &quot;Orang Besar&quot;. In addition, a governor called the &quot;Mandulika&quot; oversaw the administration of appanages and territories annexed by conquest.

The sultanate was governed with several sets of laws. The formal legal text of traditional Malacca consisted of the &quot;Undang-Undang Melaka&quot; (Laws of Malacca), variously called the &quot;Hukum Kanun Melaka&quot; and &quot;Risalat Hukum Kanun&quot;, and the &quot;Undang-Undang Laut Melaka&quot; (the Maritime Laws of Malacca&#x27;). The laws as written in the legal digests went through an evolutionary process. The legal rules that eventually evolved were shaped by three main influences, namely the early non-indigenous Hindu/Buddhist tradition, Islam and the indigenous &quot;adat&quot;.

==Islam and Malay culture==
Whether the first ruler of Malacca, Parameswara, converted to Islam is unknown as there is no evidence to suggest that he had. The 16th-century Portuguese writer Tomé Pires explicitly mentioned that Parameswara was succeeded by his son, Megat Iskandar Shah who only converted to Islam at age 72. On the other hand, the &quot;Malay Annals&quot; noted that it was during the reign of the third ruler Muhammad Shah (), that the ruling class and their subjects began accepting Islam. While there are differing views on when the Islamization of Malacca actually took place, it is generally agreed that Islam was firmly established during the reign of Muzaffar Shah ().

Islamisation in the region surrounding Malacca gradually intensified between the 15th and 16th centuries through study centres in Upeh, the district on the north bank of the Malacca River. Islam spread from Malacca to Jambi, Kampar, Bengkalis, Siak, Aru and the Karimun Islands in Sumatra, throughout much of the Malay Peninsula, Java and the Philippines. The &quot;Malay Annals&quot; mention that the courts of Malacca and Pasai posed theological questions and problems to one another. Of the so-called Wali Sanga responsible for spreading Islam on Java, at least two, Sunan Bonang and Sunan Kalijaga, are said to have studied in Malacca. Tomé Pires mentions in his &quot;Suma Oriental&quot; that the rulers of Kampar and Indragiri on the east coast of Sumatra converted to Islam as a result of Sultan Muzaffar Shah&#x27;s influence and went on to study the religion in Malacca. The &quot;Malay Annals&quot; also mentions a number of scholars who served at the Malacca royal court as teachers and counselors to the various sultans. Maulana Abu Bakar served in the court of Sultan Mansur Shah and introduced the &quot;Kitab Darul Manzum&quot;, a theological text translated from the work of an Arab scholar in Mecca. A scholar by the name of Maulana Kadi Sardar Johan served as a religious teacher to both Sultan Mahmud Shah and his son. In addition to &quot;Kitab Darul Manzum&quot;, the &quot;Malay Annals&quot; also mentions the &quot;Kitab al-luma&#x27; fi tasawwuf&quot; (&#x27;Book of Flashes&#x27;), a tenth-century treatise on Sufism by Abu Nasr al-Sarraj.

Certain elaborate ceremonies that blend Islamic traditions with local culture were also created in the Malacca Sultanate. One example was recorded during the reign of Muhammad Shah. A special ceremony was held that marked the celebration of the 27th night of Ramadan, the &quot;Laylat al-Qadr&quot;. It began with a daytime procession, led by the Temenggung on elephant-back, conveying the Sultan&#x27;s prayer mat to the mosque for Tarawih performed after the mandatory night prayers. On the following day the Sultan&#x27;s turban would be carried in procession to the mosque. Similar ceremonies accompanied the grand celebrations of both &quot;Hari Raya Aidilfitri&quot; and &quot;Hari Raya Aidiladha&quot;. Apparently Malaccan Malay society had become so infused with the Islamic worldview that on the eve of the fall of Malacca, warriors at the court requested copies of two Islamic heroic epics, the&quot; Hikayat Amir Hamzah&quot; and the &quot;Hikayat Muhammad Hanafiah&quot;, to inspire them in battle the next day.

The rise of Malacca as a centre of Islam had a number of implications. Firstly, Islam transformed the notion of kingship so that the Sultan was no longer viewed as divine, but as God&#x27;s &quot;Khalifah&quot;. Secondly, Islam was an important factor in enabling Malacca to foster good relations with other Islamic polities, including the Ottoman Empire, thereby attracting Muslim traders to Malacca. Thirdly, Islam brought many great transformation into Malaccan society and culture, and ultimately it became a definitive marker of a Malay identity. This identity was in turn enriched further through the standards set by Malacca in some important aspects of traditional Malay culture, notably in literature, architecture, culinary traditions, traditional dress, performing arts, martial arts, and royal court traditions. Over time, this common Malay cultural idiom came to characterise much of Maritime Southeast Asia through Malayisation.

==Trade==

Malacca developed from a small settlement to a cosmopolitan Entrepôt within the span of a century. This rapid progression was attributable to several factors, key among which were its strategic location along one of the world&#x27;s most important shipping lanes, the Strait of Malacca and the increasing demand for commodities from both the East and the West. Ships from the East bearing goods from China, the Ryukyu Islands, Java and the Maluku Islands would sail in by the northeast monsoon from December to January, while ships leaving for ports along Indian coastline, the Red Sea and East Africa would sail with the southwest monsoon.

There were other ports along the Strait of Malacca such as Kedah in the peninsula and Jambi and Palembang in Sumatra, yet none of them came close to challenging Malacca&#x27;s success as a centre of international trade. Malacca had an edge over these ports because its rulers created an environment that was safe and conducive for business. Chinese records of the mid-15th century stated that Malacca flourished as a centre for trade on account of its effective security measures. It also had a well-equipped and well-managed port. Among the facilities provided for merchants were warehouses, where they could safely house their goods as they awaited favourable trade winds, as well as elephants for transporting goods to the warehouses. To administer the cosmopolitan marketplace, the traders were grouped according to region and placed under one of four shahbandars.

Malacca had few domestic products with which to trade. It produced small amounts of tin and gold as well as dried fish, yet even the salt for preserving the fish had to be sourced from elsewhere in the region. Basic goods, including vegetables, cattle and fish, were supplied by Malacca&#x27;s trading partners. Rice, mainly for local consumption, was imported. Much of the mercantile activity in Malacca, therefore, relied on the flow of goods from other parts of the region. Among Malacca&#x27;s most crucial functions was its role as both a collection centre for cloves, nutmeg and mace from the Maluku Islands and a redistribution centre for cotton textiles from ports in Gujarat, the Coromandel Coast, Malabar Coast and Bengal. Other goods traded in Malacca included porcelain, silk and iron from China and natural products of the Malay Archipelago, such as camphor, sandalwood, spices, fish, fish roe and seaweed. From the coastal regions on both sides of Straint of Malacca came forest products; rattan, resin, roots and wax, and some gold and tin. These goods were then shipped to ports west of Malacca especially Gujarat.

Tin ingots were a trading currency unique to Malacca. Cast in the shape of a peck, each block weighs just over one pound. Ten blocks made up one unit called a &quot;small bundle&quot;, and 40 blocks made up one &quot;large bundle&quot;. Gold and silver coins were also issued by Malacca as a trading currency within the sultanate.

==Legacy==
The Malacca Sultanate heralded the golden age of the Malay world and became an important port in the far east during the 16th century. It became so rich that Tomé Pires said &quot;Whoever is lord of Malacca shall have his hands on the throat of Venice.&quot;. Within a span of a century, the sultanate left a lasting and important legacy, especially within Malay culture and the History of Malaysia. Malacca was the first Malay Muslim state that achieved the status of a regional maritime power. Despite the existence of earlier Muslim kingdoms such as Kedah, Samudra Pasai and Aru, which also possessed well-established ports, none of them came close in challenging Malacca&#x27;s success in expanding its territory and influence in the region. Malacca also contributed to the evolution of a common Malay culture based on Islam by incorporating native and Hindu-Buddhist ideas and layered them extensively with Islamic ideas and values. Through its traditions, laws, and royal rituals and customs, the Malaccan court set an example for later Muslim sultanates in the region to follow.

Malacca is important to the modern nation of Malaysia as it was the first centralised polity that consolidated the entire Malay Peninsula under its rule. Because of these roles, Malacca is considered by many to be the spiritual birthplace of Malaysia. After the Sultanate of Malacca fell to Portugal in 1511, Mahmud Shah retreated to Kampar, Sumatra, he left behind a prince named Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah II who went on to establish the Sultanate of Johor.

The Malacca Sultanate also emerged as the primary base in continuing the historic struggles of its predecessors, Singapura and Srivijaya, against their Java-based rivals. By the mid-15th century, Majapahit found itself unable to control the rising power of Malacca which had begun to gain effective control of the Strait of Malacca and expand its influence to Sumatra. As a major entrepôt, Malacca attracted Muslim traders from various part of the world and became a centre of Islam, spreading the religion throughout Maritime Southeast Asia. The expansion of Islam into the interior of Java in the 15th century led to the gradual decline of Majapahit, before it finally succumbed to the emerging local Muslim forces in the early 16th century. At the same time, the literary tradition of Malacca developed the Classical Malay that eventually became the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the region. The advent of Islam coupled with flourishing trade that used Malay as medium of communication, culminated in the domination of Malacca and other succeeding Malay-Muslim sultanates in Maritime Southeast Asia. As noted by certain scholars, the historic Malay-Javanese rivalry in the region, has persisted into modern times, and continues to shape the diplomatic relations between the Malay-centric Malaysia and the Java-based Indonesia.

<text>John Phillip Stamos ( ; born August 19, 1963) is an American actor and musician. He first gained recognition for his contract role as Blackie Parrish on the ABC television soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;, for which he was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series at the 10th Daytime Emmy Awards in 1983. He is known for his work in television, especially in his starring role as Jesse Katsopolis on the ABC sitcom &quot;Full House&quot;. Since the show&#x27;s finale in 1995, Stamos has appeared in numerous TV films and series.

From 2005 to 2009, Stamos had a starring role on the NBC medical drama &quot;ER&quot; as Dr. Tony Gates. After former Broadway stints in &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot; and &quot;Cabaret&quot;, Stamos began playing the role of Albert Peterson in the Broadway revival of &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;, which he starred in from October 2009 to January 2010. He then played Senator Joseph Cantwell in a Broadway revival of Gore Vidal&#x27;s play &quot;The Best Man&quot; from July to September 2012, replacing Eric McCormack.

From September 2015 to 2016, Stamos starred as the lead character in the Fox sitcom &quot;Grandfathered&quot;. He executive produced the Netflix series &quot;Fuller House&quot;, in which he reprised the role of Jesse Katsopolis. He also starred in &quot;Never Too Young to Die&quot; (1986), &quot;Born to Ride&quot; (1991), and as Dr. Nicky in the Lifetime/Netflix psychological thriller &quot;You&quot;.

==Early life==
John Stamos was born on August 19, 1963, in Cypress, California, to William &quot;Bill&quot; Stamos, a second-generation Greek-American restaurateur originating from the village of Kakouri in Arcadia and Loretta (née Phillips). His original family surname is Stamatopoulos ().

In his youth, Stamos worked for his father&#x27;s restaurants, and as a teenager, had a job flipping burgers in the Orange County area. He attended John F. Kennedy High School and played in the marching band there. At 15, he attended his first Beach Boys concert; a huge fan, he would later tour with the band. His parents were supportive of his aspiration to be an actor, and although he planned to enroll at Cypress College for the 1981 term, he skipped his first semester to focus on launching a career as an actor—with his father&#x27;s blessing. After just three weeks, he landed his first role on &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

==Acting career==

===1982–1986: Early career===
Stamos began his acting career with the role of Blackie Parrish on the soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; in late January 1982, for which he was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series at the 10th Daytime Emmy Awards in 1983. That April, he went on to the lead role in the short-lived CBS sitcom &quot;Dreams&quot;, in which he played Gino Minnelli, an aspiring musician in a band of the same name. Later, he was a series regular on the sitcom &quot;You Again?&quot; (1986) with Jack Klugman. In 1986, Stamos starred in his first film &quot;Never Too Young to Die&quot;, an action spy film also starring Kiss bassist Gene Simmons. Though intended to be a &quot;young James Bond&quot; film (and even starred former Bond actor George Lazenby as Drew Stargrove, the father of Stamos&#x27; character Lance Stargrove), the movie was a critical and commercial flop.

===1987–1995: &quot;Full House&quot;===
In the late 1980s, ABC&#x27;s &quot;Full House&quot; gradually became a hit, and the show solidified Stamos&#x27;s career. He asked that his character&#x27;s last name be changed from Cochran to Katsopolis to highlight his Greek heritage, according to show creator and executive producer Jeff Franklin. He played one of the show&#x27;s protagonists, Jesse, who lives with his brother-in-law, Danny Tanner (Bob Saget), whose deceased wife Pam Tanner (Christine Houser) was Jesse&#x27;s older sister. Danny&#x27;s best friend, Joey Gladstone (Dave Coulier), also lives in the house with them. The three help each other raise Danny&#x27;s three young daughters DJ (Candace Cameron), Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle Tanner (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen). Jesse is known to be the &quot;bad boy&quot; at first until he falls in love with and marries Rebecca Donaldson (Lori Loughlin) and has twin boys, Nicky and Alex Katsopolis (Blake and Dylan Tuomy-Wilhoit). In 1995, after eight seasons, the series came to an end. Stamos has since maintained close relationships with co-stars Bob Saget, Dave Coulier, Lori Loughlin, Jodie Sweetin, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Andrea Barber, and Candace Cameron Bure.

===1996–2009: Later career===
Stamos has appeared in numerous made-for-television films, stage productions, television series, and commercials. He had starring roles in the television series &quot;Thieves&quot; (2001) and &quot;Jake in Progress&quot; (2005). Both shows ran for several episodes before cancellation. In 2003, Stamos guest-starred on &quot;Friends&quot;, appearing in the season nine episode, &quot;The One with the Donor&quot;, playing Zack, a man who went to Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) and Monica Gellar (Courteney Cox)&#x27;s apartment for dinner, not knowing he was actually being interviewed to be a sperm donor. Stamos was a guest star in a first-season episode of MTV&#x27;s &quot;The Andy Milonakis Show&quot; (2005), playing himself. He took part in only one skit, which featured him in a tree, having rabies, and being put down by another character. In the A&amp;E television movie &quot;Wedding Wars&quot; (2006), he starred as Shel Grandy, a gay wedding planner. He stated that his performance reflected his support for same-sex marriages.

He has made several voice acting appearances such as in the MTV animated series &quot;Clone High&quot; in the 2003 episode, &quot;&quot;, where he played himself, and as the What&#x27;s Global Warming Penguin in Bob Saget&#x27;s 2007 parody film &quot;Farce of the Penguins&quot;. In 2005, Stamos guest-starred in two episodes in season 12 of &quot;ER&quot; as paramedic-turned-intern Tony Gates. In 2006, at the start of &quot;ER&quot; thirteenth season, he joined the cast as a series regular. In February 2008, Stamos appeared in the television adaptation of &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot;. In August 2008, he was the roastmaster for the &quot;Comedy Central Roast of Bob Saget&quot;.

===2010–present: &quot;Grandfathered&quot;, &quot;Fuller House,&quot; and other ventures===
On June 8, 2010, it was announced that Stamos would portray Carl Howell, a new love interest for Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), in season two of the television show &quot;Glee&quot;. In 2011, Stamos guest-starred on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; and was featured in a CollegeHumor video with Bob Saget. Stamos also guest-starred as himself on &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; as Charlie Harper (Charlie Sheen)&#x27;s old friend, who was interested in buying the house until he found out that the place was Charlie&#x27;s.

Since 2011, Stamos has appeared in a series of commercials for Dannon&#x27;s Greek yogurt brand Oikos; including his first Super Bowl commercial, which was aired during Super Bowl 2012. In February 2012, it was reported that Stamos would take on one of the lead roles on the new Fox drama &quot;Little Brother&quot;. The series was created by &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; writer Mike Royce, and centers around a man who finds out that he has a long-lost half-brother.

In March 2013, Stamos signed on in a recurring role on the USA Network drama &quot;Necessary Roughness&quot;, during season three. He played Connor McClane, the head of a sports and entertainment management company that is interested in hiring Dani Santino (Callie Thorne). Stamos was to play the lead role in ABC&#x27;s soap opera &quot;Members Only&quot;, but the network decided not to air the show.

In April 2015, Stamos announced on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; that the streaming service Netflix would be picking up &quot;Full House&quot; for a 13-episode sequel, titled &quot;Fuller House&quot;, to start airing on February 26, 2016. In September, he began leading the cast of the Fox sitcom &quot;Grandfathered&quot;, also starring Josh Peck, Christina Milian, and Paget Brewster. In 2016, Stamos appeared in the film &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2&quot;, and joined the Fox black comedy series &quot;Scream Queens&quot; in its second season, as series regular Dr. Brock Holt.

In 2018, Stamos starred in Lifetime&#x27;s television adaptation of &quot;You&quot; as Dr. Nicky, which premiered on September 9, 2018. On June 24, 2019, it was confirmed that Stamos would reprise his role as Dr. Nicky in the second season, by which point the series had been announced to move to Netflix. The second season was released on December 26, 2019.

==Music and theatre==
Stamos started learning drums when he was four, then began to take up playing the guitar, and started his own band called Destiny. The band had played concerts at some amusement parks and parties.

Stamos performed on an independently released 1994 album entitled &quot;Shades of Blue&quot; along with Lanny Cordola, Gary Griffin, Sandra Stephens, Tony Guerrero, and David Enos. &quot;Shades of Blue&quot; was re-released digitally through iTunes and other channels in 2010 after being long out-of-print. He appeared on Broadway as The Emcee in &quot;Cabaret&quot;, as Guido Contini in &quot;Nine&quot; and as J. Pierrepont Finch in &quot;How To Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;. Stamos performed the Billy Joel song &quot;Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)&quot; on the 2006 charity album &quot;Unexpected Dreams – Songs From the Stars&quot;.

On March 30, 2009, he announced that he would participate in the Broadway revival of &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;. Stamos won the 2009–10 Golden Icon Award for best actor in a musical for his performance in that production. Stamos was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on November 16, 2009. The star is located at 7021 Hollywood Blvd.

Stamos performed with John Fogerty on April 24, 2010, during one of the Tampa Bay Rays post-game concerts. Stamos rotated between the tambourine, drums, and bass guitar throughout the concert. In August 2011, Stamos performed in &quot;Hairspray&quot; at the Hollywood Bowl as Corny Collins, alongside an all-star cast.

On July 10, 2012, Stamos began performances on Broadway in Gore Vidal&#x27;s &quot;The Best Man&quot; as Senator Joseph Cantwell. Stamos reprised his role as Jesse Katsopolis for a &quot;Jesse and the Rippers&quot; reunion on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; on July 19, 2013. Played straight by host Fallon (who introduced the band as being from San Francisco and having a number one song in Japan), Stamos performed a medley of songs featured on &quot;Full House&quot; including &quot;Forever&quot; and the series&#x27; theme song &quot;Everywhere You Look&quot;. Bob Saget and Lori Loughlin also made cameos.

In 2014, Stamos directed the music video &quot;Let Yourself be Loved&quot; for the Nashville-based band Diamond Carter, featuring the band&#x27;s front-man Tyler Tuohy alongside actress Nicky Whelan. Stamos was also noted as a co-writer for the song, along with Michael Gigante, and the video was released on Yahoo Music on May 21, 2014.

===The Beach Boys===
Stamos has occasionally performed in concert with the Beach Boys, dating back to 1985, typically playing drums and various other percussion instruments. In 1988, he appeared in their video for &quot;Kokomo&quot;, in which he played conga drums and steel drums. In 1990, he played drums for them on the title track of the comedy &quot;Problem Child&quot; and also appeared in the song&#x27;s music video.

In 1992, he sang lead vocals on a new version of &quot;Forever&quot; for their album &quot;Summer in Paradise&quot;. The song was originally written and sung by Beach Boy Dennis Wilson and released in 1970. The song was also featured twice on &quot;Full House&quot;. The first was a recording sung at his character&#x27;s wedding, while the second was a recording sung for his character&#x27;s twin sons. The 1992 music video, titled &quot;Forever by Jesse and the Rippers,&quot; featured Stamos predominantly. However, three of The Beach Boys members are briefly shown singing harmonies with Stamos: Carl Wilson, Bruce Johnston, and Mike Love.

Other performances include:

*July 4, 1985, Ben Franklin Parkway in Philadelphia, in a large outdoor performance that featured guests like Jimmy Page, Joan Jett, Mr. T, Christopher Cross and the Oak Ridge Boys.
*March 30, 2010, on a season 8 episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, playing drums, congas, and guitar, also touring with them that spring, including an appearance at Fort Myers, Florida

Stamos is a big fan of Elvis Presley and has often referenced or paid homage to him in the show &quot;Full House&quot;. Stamos began dating model and actress Rebecca Romijn in 1994 after they met at a Victoria&#x27;s Secret fashion show in which she was modeling. Stamos and Romijn became engaged on Christmas Eve 1997, and they married on September 19, 1998, at the Beverly Hills Hotel. They announced their separation in April 2004. Stamos filed for divorce in August 2004, and it became final on March 1, 2005.

Since 2005, Stamos has been the national spokesperson for the Project Cuddle child-oriented charity.

On October 23, 2017, Stamos announced his engagement to model and actress Caitlin McHugh, who is 22 years his junior, after a year of dating. In December 2017, the couple announced they were expecting their first child, due in the spring of 2018. Stamos and McHugh married in February 2018. The couple&#x27;s son was born in April 2018.

<text>STMicroelectronics [[Naamloze vennootschap|NV]] (commonly referred to as ST or STMicro) is a European multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company. It is the largest of such companies in Europe. It was founded in 1987 from the merger of two state-owned semiconductor corporations: &quot;Thomson Semiconducteurs&quot; of France and &quot;SGS Microelettronica&quot; of Italy. The company is incorporated in the Netherlands and headquartered in Plan-les-Ouates, Switzerland. Its shares are traded on Euronext Paris, the Borsa Italiana and the New York Stock Exchange.

== History ==
ST was formed in 1987 by the merger of two government-owned semiconductor companies: Italian SGS Microelettronica (where SGS stands for &quot;Società Generale Semiconduttori&quot;, &quot;General Semiconductor Company&quot;), and French &quot;Thomson Semiconducteurs&quot;, the semiconductor arm of Thomson.

SGS Microelettronica originated in 1972 from a previous merger of two companies:
* ATES (Aquila Tubi e Semiconduttori), a vacuum tube and semiconductor maker headquartered in L&#x27;Aquila, the regional capital of the region of Abruzzo in Southern Italy, which in 1961 changed its name to Azienda Tecnica ed Elettronica del Sud and relocated its manufacturing plant in the Industrial Zone of Catania, in Sicily;
* Società Generale Semiconduttori (founded in 1957 by Italian engineer, politician, and industrialist Adriano Olivetti).

Thomson Semiconducteurs was created in 1982 by the French government&#x27;s widespread nationalization of industries following the election of François Mitterrand to the presidency. It included:
* the semiconductor activities of the French electronics company Thomson;
* in 1985 it bought Mostek, a US company founded in 1969 as a spin-off of Texas Instruments, from United Technologies;
* Silec, founded in 1977;
* Eurotechnique, founded in 1979 in Rousset, Bouches-du-Rhône as a joint-venture between Saint-Gobain of France and US-based National Semiconductor;
* EFCIS (Étude et la Fabrication de Circuits Intégrés Spéciaux), founded in 1972 at CEA-Leti;
* SESCOSEM, founded in 1969.

At the time of the merger of these two companies in 1987, the new corporation was named SGS-THOMSON and was led by chief executive officer Pasquale Pistorio. The company took its current name of STMicroelectronics in May 1998 following Thomson&#x27;s sale of its shares. After its creation ST was ranked 14th among the top 20 semiconductor suppliers with sales of around US$850 million. The company has participated in the consolidation of the semiconductor industry since its formation, with acquisitions including:
* In 1989, British company Inmos known for its transputer microprocessors from parent Thorn EMI;
* In 1994, Canada-based Nortel&#x27;s semiconductor activities;
* In 1999, UK-based VLSI-Vision CMOS Image Sensor research &amp; development company, a spin-out of Edinburgh University. Incorporated on 1 January 2000, the company became STMicroelectronics Imaging Division, currently part of the Analog MEMS and Sensors business group;
* In 2000, WaferScale Integration Inc. (WSI, Fremont, California), a vendor of EPROM and flash memory-based programmable system-chips;
* In 2002, Alcatel&#x27;s Microelectronics division, which along with the incorporation of smaller ventures such as UK company, Synad Ltd, helped the company expand into the Wireless-LAN market;
* In 2007, US-based Genesis Microchip. Genesis Microchip is known for their strength in video processing technology (Faroudja) and has design centres located in Santa Clara, California, Toronto, Taipei City and Bangalore.
On 8 December 1994, the company completed its initial public offering on the Paris and New York stock exchanges. Owner Thomson SA sold its stake in the company in 1998 when the company also listed on the Italian Bourse in Milan. In 2002, Motorola and TSMC joined ST and Philips in a new technology partnership. The Crolles 2 Alliance was created with a new 12&quot; wafer manufacturing facility located in Crolles, France. In 2005, chief executive officer Pasquale Pistorio was succeeded by Carlo Bozotti, who then headed the memory products division and had been with the company’s predecessor since 1977. By 2005, ST was ranked fifth, behind Intel, Samsung, Texas Instruments and Toshiba, but ahead of Infineon, Renesas, NEC, NXP Semiconductors and Freescale. The company was the largest European semiconductors supplier, ahead of Infineon and NXP.

Early in 2007, NXP Semiconductors (formerly Philips Semiconductors) and Freescale (formerly Motorola Semiconductors) decided to stop their participation in Crolles 2 Alliance. Under the terms of the agreement the Alliance came to an end on December 31, 2007. On May 22, 2007, ST and Intel created a joint venture in the memory application called Numonyx: this new company merged ST and Intel Flash Memory activities. Semiconductor market consolidation continued with ST and NXP announcing on April 10, 2008, the creation of a new joint venture of their mobile activities, with ST owning 80% of the new company and NXP 20%. This joint venture began on August 20, 2008. On February 10, 2009, ST Ericsson, a joint venture bringing together ST-NXP Wireless and Ericsson Mobile Platforms, was established.

ST Ericsson was a multinational manufacturer of wireless products and semiconductors, supplying to mobile device manufacturers. ST-Ericsson was a 50/50 joint venture of STMicroelectronics and Ericsson established on February 3, 2009, and dissolved on August 2, 2013. Headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, it was a fabless company, outsourcing semiconductor manufacturing to foundry companies.
In 2011, ST announced the creation of a joint lab with Sant&#x27;Anna School of Advanced Studies. The lab focuses on research and innovation in biorobotics, smart systems and microelectronics. Past collaborations with Sant&#x27;Anna School of Advanced Studies included DustBot, a platform that integrated self-navigating &quot;service robots&quot; for waste collection.

In 2015, the MEMS division of ST was ranked as the biggest European competitor of Silex Microsystems.

In 2018, chief executive Carlo Bozotti was succeeded by Jean-Marc Chery. In 2023, STMicroelectronics partnered with Synopsys to design a working chip on Microsoft Corp’s cloud, marking the first time AI software had been utilized for chip design.

In 2024, ST became the sixth shareholder of Quintauris, a joint company with the goal of standardizing RISC-V ecosystem.

== Shareholders ==
As of December 31, 2014, the shareholders were:
* 68.4% public (New York Stock Exchange, Euronext Paris, Borsa Italiana Milano);
* 4.1% treasury shares;
* 27.6% STMicroelectronics Holding B.V.:
** 50% FT1CI (Bpifrance 79.2% and French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) 20.8%; previously );
** 50% Ministry of Economy and Finance of Italy .

==Manufacturing facilities==
Unlike fabless semiconductor companies, STMicroelectronics owns and operates its own semiconductor wafer fabs. The company owned five 8-inch (200 mm) wafer fabs and 1 12-inch (300 mm) wafer fab in 2006. Most of the production is scaled at 0.18 μm, 0.13 μm, 90 nm and 65 nm (measurements of transistor gate length). STMicroelectronics also owns back-end plants, where silicon dies are assembled and bonded into plastic or ceramic packages.

Major sites include: 

===Grenoble, France===
Grenoble is one of the company&#x27;s most important R&amp;D centres, employing around 4,000 staff. The Polygone site employs 2,200 staff and is one of the historical bases of the company (ex SGS). All the historical wafer fab lines are now closed but the site hosts the headquarters of many divisions (marketing, design, industrialization) and a R&amp;D centre, focused on silicon and software design and fab process development.

The Crolles site hosts a and a fab and was originally built as a common R&amp;D centre for submicrometre technologies as part of the 1990 &quot;Grenoble 92&quot; partnership between SGS-Thomson and CNET, the R&amp;D center of French telecom company France Telecom.

The fab was inaugurated by French president Jacques Chirac, on 27 February 2003. It includes an R&amp;D centre which focuses on developing new nanometric technology processes for 90-nm to 32-nm scale using wafers and it was developed for &quot;The Crolles 2 Alliance&quot;. This alliance of STMicroelectronics, TSMC, NXP Semiconductors (formerly Philips semiconductor) and Freescale (formerly Motorola semiconductor) partnered in 2002 to develop the facility and to work together on process development. The technologies developed at the facility were also used by global semiconductor foundry TSMC of Taiwan, allowing TSMC to build the products developed in Crolles on behalf of the Alliance partners who required such foundry capacity.

===Rousset, France===
Employing around 3,000 staff, Rousset hosts several division headquarters including smartcards, microcontrollers, and EEPROM as well as several R&amp;D centers. Rousset also hosts an 8-inch (200-mm) fab, which was opened on May 15, 2000 by French prime minister Lionel Jospin.

The site opened in 1979 as a fab operated by Eurotechnique, a joint venture between Saint-Gobain of France and National Semiconductor of the US. Rousset was sold to Thomson-CSF in 1982 as part of the French government&#x27;s 1981–82 nationalization of several industries. As part of the nationalisation, a former Thomson plant in the center of Aix-en-Provence operating since the 1960s was closed and staff were transferred to the new Rousset site. The original fab was upgraded into and later fab in 1996. It is now being shut down. The site also has a &quot;Wafer Level Chip Scale Packaging&quot; accreditation for eSIM ICs.

In 1988, a small group of employees from the Thomson Rousset plant (including the director, Marc Lassus) founded a start-up company, Gemalto (formerly known as Gemplus), which became a leader in the smartcard industry.

===Tours, France===
Employing 1,500 staff, this site hosts a fab and R&amp;D centres.

===Milan, Italy===
Employing 6,000 staff, the Milan facilities match Grenoble in importance. Agrate Brianza employs around 4,000 staff and is a historical base of the company (ex SGS). The site has several fab lines (including a fab) and an R&amp;D center. Castelletto, employs 300 to 400 staff and hosts some divisions and R&amp;D centres.

=== Catania, Italy ===
The Catania plant in Sicily employs 5,000 staff and hosts several R&amp;D centers and divisions, focusing on flash memory technologies as well as two fabs. The plant was launched in 1961 by ATES to supply under licensing to RCA of the US and initially using germanium. The site&#x27;s two major wafer fabs are a fab, opened in April 1997 by then-Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, and a fab that has never been completed and which was transferred in its current state to &quot;Numonyx&quot; in 2008. A new manufacturing facility for silicon carbide (SiC) substrates of 150 mm should open here in 2023.

In October 2022, the EU supported STMicroelectronics for the construction of a silicon carbide wafer plant in Catania with €293 million through the Recovery and Resilience Facility to be completed in 2026, and in line with the European Chips Act.

===Caserta, Italy===
STmicro eSIM and SIM production facility for embedded form factor eSIM.

===Kirkop, Malta===
As of 2010, ST employed around 1,800 people in Kirkop, making it the largest private sector employer, and the country&#x27;s leading exporter.

===Singapore===
In 1970, SGS created its first assembly back-end plant in Singapore, in the area of Toa Payoh. Then in 1981, SGS decided to build a wafer
fab in Singapore. Converted up to fab, this is now an important wafer fab of the group. Ang Mo Kio also hosts some design centres. As of 2004, the site employed 6,000 staff.

===Tunis, Tunisia===
Application, design and support. about 110 employees.

===Bouskoura, Morocco===
Founded in 1979 as a radiofrequency products facility, the Bouskoura site now hosts back-end manufacturing activity, which includes chip testing and packaging. Since 2022 it also features a production line for silicon carbide products that primarily will be used in electric vehicles.

===Norrköping, Sweden===
The Norrköping plant is a wafer fab that, at the start of production in 2021, was the first to produce 200mm (8 in) Silicone Carbide wafers. The wafers are mostly used for SiC power devices.

<text>The National Rainbow Coalition (NARC) is a political party in Kenya. As an alliance, it was in power from 2002 and 2005 when it collapsed due to disagreements between members over a constitutional referendum.

==Formation==
In preparation of the 2002 elections, the National Alliance Party of Kenya (Formerly NAK now NAPK) allied itself with the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to form the National Alliance of Rainbow Coalition (NARC). On December 27, 2002, NARC won a landslide victory over KANU. NARC presidential candidate Mwai Kibaki got 62% of the votes in the presidential elections, against only 31% for the KANU candidate, Uhuru Kenyatta. On December 30, 2002, Mwai Kibaki was sworn in as the third President of Kenya.

==NARC government==
Despite its initial popularity, the NARC-led government has been troublesome. The friction between LDP and those loyal to Kibaki became apparent. After the Kenyan constitutional referendum in 2005, all LDP members were thrown out of the government. Subsequently, LDP became an opposition party, forming the Orange Democratic Movement, a coalition of opposition politicians. Later, NARC members loyal to Kibaki founded a new party, NARC–Kenya. Consequently, the original NARC was left in the hands of its chairperson Charity Ngilu who also served as the minister of health.

==2007 elections==
On 5 October 2007, Ngilu announced her support for the Orange Democratic Movement and its presidential candidate, Raila Odinga, in the December 2007 general election;. She initially said that she was remaining in the government, despite backing Kibaki&#x27;s main rival. However, her dismissal from the government by Kibaki was announced on October 6. While supporting ODM, Ngilu defended her parliamentary seat on NARC ticket. Under Ngilu, NARC won 3 seats in the new Kenyan parliament altogether.

==2013 elections==
After briefly running her own campaign, Ngilu initially opted to support Raila Odinga for the presidency in 2013, signing a coalition agreement involving NARC, ODM, Wiper Democratic Movement and FORD–Kenya, before walking out at the last minute to join the Jubilee Alliance.

<text>Finland Swedish or Fenno-Swedish (; ) is a variety of the Swedish language and a closely related group of Swedish dialects spoken in Finland by the Swedish-speaking population, commonly also referred to as Finland Swedes, as their first language.

For the most part, these dialects and the dialects spoken in Sweden are mutually intelligible, although some archaic dialects in Ostrobothnia are practically unintelligible to Swedish-speaking people in southern Finland (and in Sweden). Most Swedish-speaking Finns emphasize that Finland Swedish is not a separate language from the Swedish of Sweden. The Swedish dialects in Finland are considered varieties of Swedish, and the norm for written Standard Swedish is completely applicable also for Finland Swedish. Today, Swedish dialects are spoken in four different regions in Finland: Ostrobothnia, Åland, Southwest Finland and Uusimaa.

Swedish as spoken in Finland is regulated by the Swedish Department of the Institute for the Languages of Finland. This regulation includes the officially stated aim of keeping Finland Swedish close to the Swedish as spoken in Sweden and strongly phrased advice against loanwords and calques from Finnish, which are usually incomprehensible to Swedes.

In the spoken vernacular, especially among young people in Finnish-dominated areas, Finnish loanwords as well as calques from Finnish are frequently incorporated into Finland Swedish. There are also some words in Finland Swedish that would be considered slightly archaic in Sweden. Some government and public service terms that have been created in recent centuries also differ. The same is true of other new words, notably loanwords from English.

A common misconception among many Swedes is that Finland Swedish is simply Swedish spoken with a Finnish accent, something that can be a considerable source of frustration to most native Swedish-speakers in Finland. Any language adopts features, especially pronunciation habits, from dominant languages it comes in touch with, but many of the traits of Finland Swedish exist also in monolingual areas and some are in fact preserved features of Old Swedish, as with Scots in comparison with English or Afrikaans in comparison with Dutch.

==History==

Finland Swedish was a result of Swedish colonisation of Finland during the Northern Crusades in the 12th to 14th centuries. Colonisation focused on the Finnish archipelago and some of its coastal regions. This colonisation led to the beginning of the Swedish-speaking population of Finland.

From the 16th century, Swedish was the main language of jurisdiction, administration and higher education in Finland (which was then a part of Sweden), but the majority of the population in the Finnish inland spoke Finnish outside of these sectors of society, i.e. in normal, daily life. In 1809, when Finland was conquered by the Russian Empire and became an autonomous Grand Duchy, Swedish remained the only official language. In 1863, both Finnish and Swedish became official languages with equal status, and by the time of Finland&#x27;s independence in 1917, after a Finnicization campaign by the Fennoman movement, Finnish clearly dominated in government and society. See further: Finland&#x27;s language strife.

Finland has since then been a bilingual country with a Swedish-speaking minority (5.2% of mainland Finland&#x27;s population in December 2019) living mostly in the coastal areas of southern, south-western, and western Finland. During the 20th century, the urbanization following the Industrial Revolution has led to large majorities of Finnish speakers in all major cities. The capital Helsinki (in Swedish Helsingfors) became predominantly Finnish-speaking as recently as around 1900. A large and important part of the Swedish-speaking population nevertheless lives in the capital.

The autonomous island province of Åland is an exception, being monolingually Swedish-speaking according to international treaties. It is a matter of definition whether the Swedish dialects spoken on Åland are to be considered a kind of Finland Swedish or not. Most Swedish-speaking Finns and linguists consider them to be closer to some of the dialects spoken in nearby parts of Sweden.

== Official status ==
Swedish is one of the two official and national languages of the Republic of Finland, the other being Finnish. These two languages have formally equal status in nearly all legislation, though the status of Swedish in Finland has long been a subject of sociopolitical debate. The other minority languages (such as Sami) are regulated separately.

Finland Swedish is regulated by the Institute for the Languages of Finland. Official Swedish is not supposed to be very different from Swedish as found in Sweden. There are however e.g. words regarded as archaic in Sweden, but commonly used in Finland, and terms that differ from their counterparts in Sweden, often because of slight differences in the related legislation.

Bilingualism of municipalities is regulated by the Language Act of 2003. If the minority has increased into at least 3,000 persons or 8% of inhabitants, then the municipality must become bilingual. If the minority has fallen below 3,000 persons and 6% of inhabitants, then the municipality becomes monolingual, unless it decides to keep its bilingual status. At present, only one such municipality has done so, namely Lohja ( in Swedish). The status is reviewed once in a decade, and enacted by a government decree issued by the Finnish Council of State.

The country&#x27;s public broadcaster, Yle, provides two Swedish-language radio stations, Yle Vega and Yle X3M. The Swedish-language TV channel Yle Fem was merged with Yle Teema in 2017 to form Yle Teema &amp; Fem.

==Phonology==

With the exception of the dialects spoken in Ostrobothnia along the west coast, close to the Gulf of Bothnia (example: the dialect spoken in Närpes), Finland Swedish is not particularly different from Central Swedish. The phoneme is more centralized and pronounced like , quite similar to how many speakers of English pronounce (as in &quot;moon&quot;). That should be compared to the Central Swedish , which is very close to the short vowel and is more rounded.

The highly variable &quot;sj&quot; sound varies between and on the Finnish mainland, often close to &quot;sh&quot; in English &quot;shoe&quot;. In the Åland Islands, its realization is similar to the velar (and often labialized) pronunciations of nearby parts of Sweden. The historic &quot;k&quot; sound before front vowels and the &quot;tj&quot; sound, in modern Central Swedish a fricative , is an affricate or in all Finland Swedish dialects, close to &quot;ch&quot; in English &quot;chin&quot;, except for some Åland dialects, in which it is a simple fricative [ɕ].

The tonal word accent, which distinguishes some minimal pairs in most dialects of Swedish and Norwegian, is not present in Finland Swedish (except around the parish of Snappertuna, west of Helsinki). Hence, Central Swedish minimal pairs like (&quot;the duck&quot;) and (&quot;the spirit&quot;) are both pronounced in Finland.

Finland Swedish lacks the aspirated stops present in Central Standard Swedish, making the contrast between &quot;fortis&quot; and &quot;lenis&quot; stops one of voicing only. The retroflexion that occurs in many dialects when precedes a coronal consonant does not occur in certain pairs in Finland Swedish (e.g. , which is realized as in Standard Swedish but in Finland Swedish).

==Vocabulary==
Finland Swedish mostly has the same vocabulary as Swedish in Sweden, and there is a conscious effort to adopt neologisms from Sweden, to maintain cohesion between the two varieties. Nevertheless, there are differences, which generally fall into two categories: words now considered archaic in Sweden, and loanwords and calques from Finnish or independently borrowed from other languages (nowadays mostly English). There are also some terms differing because of differing legislation.

<doc id="162980" wikidata="Q5467891" url="?curid=162980" title="Ford Park Cemetery">
<text>Ford Park Cemetery is a cemetery in central Plymouth, England, established by the Plymouth, Stonehouse &amp; Devonport Cemetery Company in 1846 and opened in 1848. At the time it was outside the boundary of the Three Towns and was created to alleviate the overcrowding in the churchyards of the local parish churches. Its official name at the time of inception was The Plymouth, Devonport and Stonehouse Cemetery (renamed in 2000), although it is now seldom referred to by that title.

The cemetery was originally in size, but a further were added in 1875. It came into use during one of the largest outbreaks of cholera in the country and during its first year it saw over 400 burials related to that disease. During Victorian times it was the main cemetery for the Three Towns, and it is estimated that approximately a quarter of a million people are buried within its grounds. The older burial records have been deposited with the Plymouth and West Devon Record Office.

Among the more famous graves is that of the Reverend Robert Stephen Hawker, the author of &quot;The Song of the Western Men&quot;. As at November 2016 there are 769 war graves from the First World War, over 200 of which are in a dedicated naval plot; and 198 war graves of the Second World War (including an unidentified airman) are scattered throughout the site. A Victoria Cross (VC) recipient of the Crimean War, Captain Andrew Henry, Royal Artillery, is buried here, as is another VC recipient, of the Taiping Rebellion, Quartermaster George Hinckley, Royal Navy.

The Victorian chapel building designed by J. R. Hamilton and J. M. Medland is Grade II listed, as is the older burial area nearest the chapel including a large circular vault. Until one was severely damaged by enemy air attack during World War II, there was a second (identical) non-conformist chapel to the right of the unscathed Anglican building. Both are shown, together with the then abutting farmland and the playing fields of Plymouth College in a well known 1889 photograph now in the Francis Frith collection under the title &#x27;Plymouth, the cemetery 1889&#x27;. Along the north-east side is the connected but walled-off Plymouth Jewish Cemetery.

During the 1970s and 80s, poor management, a loss of revenue because few people were paying for the maintenance of plots, and the popularity of cremation, all led to the dilapidation of the site. In January 1988, seventeen-year-old Patricia Hicks was murdered in the overgrown cemetery. After the original cemetery company went into liquidation and after much public debate, in 2000 a trust was set up which reopened the cemetery, made dangerous structures safe, cleared the undergrowth, obtained renovation grants and created a walking trail around some of the graves of notable people. The older of the two chapels which is shown above right in a photograph of its unrestored state has now been fully restored and refurbished as a setting for all varieties of religious or secular funeral or memorial services and is also used for concerts and other events.

The cemetery is a member of the Association of Significant Cemeteries in Europe and the trust was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Award for Voluntary Service in 2005. As at 2009, there are further plans for numerous works to restore and improve various parts of the cemetery, aided by the Heritage Lottery Fund, including the renovation of the Anglican chapel, and provision of a memorial to the civilian dead of World War Two. It is estimated there are over 10,000 usable grave spaces remaining in the cemetery. The cemetery has rapidly become popular again as an attractive convenient and semi-rural setting close to the city centre and the densely populated but fashionable Victorian and Edwardian suburbs.

The City of Plymouth has two large early twentieth century municipal cemeteries at Weston Mill and Efford, each with chapels and now crematoria and the Drake Memorial Garden is near Elburton.

==Notable burials==
* Robert Hawker (1803–1875). the talented poet best known for the Song of the Western Men, better known as the Cornish Anthem &#x27;Trelawney&#x27;
* Mary Ann Hockaday – a Matron for 40 years at the South Devon and Cornwall Institution for the Blind
* Jimmy Peters (1879–1954). English Rugby Player, notable as the first black man to play rugby for England
* Mabel Ramsey (1878–1954). Plymouth&#x27;s first woman surgeon who was the first woman to be appointed Surgeon-Gynaecologist at Plymouth City Hospital.

<text>The 43rd Philippine Scout Infantry Regiment (43rd INF (PS)) was part of USAFFE&#x27;s Philippine Division, during World War II.

==History==
The 43d Infantry Regiment was formed in June 1917, at Fort Douglas, Utah. In April 1921, it became a Philippine Scout unit and joined the Philippine Division, on 22 October. In 1922, the unit was deactivated.

The 1st Battalion was reactivated on 1 April 1941, formed from troops transferred from the 45th Infantry Regiment (PS), and the 329 troops of the 1st Battalion served at Pettit Barracks and Camp John Hay. The 1st Battalion surrendered to the Japanese on 9 April 1942. However, elements of Troop C, 26th Cavalry, and Companies C and E, 43d Infantry, all isolated in Northern Luzon, became the core of guerrilla units which continued to resist until the end of the war.

Another account, from Louis Morton&#x27;s &quot;The Fall of the Philippines&quot;, place C and E companies on Mindanao where they staffed an infantry school and trained elements of the Philippine Army. These instructors were organized into a reserve force for Colonel William P. Morse&#x27;s 102nd Division (PA). They continue to serve in this role during the final defense of Mindanao town of Dalirig in the Cagayan Sector.

These companies, led by Major Allen Peck, &quot;made a brave stand&quot; in Dalirig on 9 May 1942 to cover the withdrawal of the Philippine Army 62d Infantry Regiment during their retreat from defenses near the Del Monte airfield. The Scouts stood their ground until they were surrounded on three sides by Japanese troops from the Kawamura Detachment. At that point they fell back before they were completely cut off by pursuing Japanese forces. These units were probably dispersed with the rest of the Dalirig force and were surrendered with the rest of General Sharp&#x27;s command on 10 May.

The unit was reorganized following the war but disbanded a year later.

<text>Camp John Hay is a mixed-used development which serves as a tourist destination and forest watershed reservation in Baguio, Philippines which was formerly a military base of the United States Armed Forces.

==History==

The United States 48th Infantry Unit under Captain Robert Rudd established Hill Station in the current site of Camp John Hay in 1900 during the Philippine-American war. The site is referred to the locals, the Ibalois, as &quot;Kafagway&quot; and is owned by Ibaloi leader Mateo Cariño. of the land was then designated as &quot;Camp John Hay&quot;, a military reservation for American soldiers, in October 1903 when US President Theodore Roosevelt signed a presidential order. American military personnel were given a place to refuge from the relative hotter temperature of the lowlands.

In December 1941, Japanese warplanes dropped 72 bombs over the main gate of the camp during the onset of World War II in the Philippines. Camp John Hay served as an internment camp of the Imperial Japanese forces as well as the headquarters of General Tomoyuki Yamashita during the Japanese occupation period. When the Japanese forces in the archipelago capitulated, Yamashita surrendered to the Allied forces at Camp John Hay, specifically at the High Commissioner&#x27;s residence which was later renamed as the Ambassador&#x27;s Residence.

After the war, Camp John Hay was converted into John Hay Air Base in 1955 and remained under the control of the Americans until it was officially turned over the Philippine government in 1991. The former military installation was made into a human resource development hub, and forest watershed reservation. The site became a tourist attraction.

On April 3, 2024, the Supreme Court En banc&#x27;s decision by Justice Japar Dimaampao upheld the arbitral ruling and ordered Camp John Hay Development Corp. to vacate a portion of the John Hay Special Economic Zone it leased from the Bases Conversion Development Authority. In G.R. Nos. 219421 and 241772 (BCDA v. CJH Development Corporation, et al.; CJH Development Corporation v. COA and BCDA), the High Tribunal lifted the injunction on eviction of Camp John Hay developer specifically mandating the return to BCDA of the 247-hectare leased property together with all improvements and the BCDA in turn must refund to CJH DevCo its total rent paid amounting to P1.4 billion.

In October 2024, the Supreme Court upheld with finality its April 3 arbitration award decision in favor of the BCDA, which nullified the John Hay development lease and ordered CJHDevco&#x27;s eviction.

On May 30, 2024, the Presidential Communications Group announced lawyer Marlo Ignacio Quadra as president and chief executive officer of the John Hay Management Corp. In October 2023, he was designated by the President as JHMC Board of Directors member.

<text>Rovaniemi ( , ; ; ; ) is a city in Finland and the regional capital of Lapland. It is located near the Arctic Circle in the northern interior of the country. The population of Rovaniemi is approximately , while the sub-region has a population of approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland, and the 12th most populous urban area in the country.
Rovaniemi is also the largest city in Europe by land area.

Rovaniemi is the administrative capital and commercial centre of Finland&#x27;s northernmost province, Lapland, and its southern part Peräpohjola. The city centre is situated about south of the Arctic Circle and is between the hills of Ounasvaara and Korkalovaara, at the confluence of the river Kemijoki and its tributary, the Ounasjoki. It is the second-largest city of Northern Finland after Oulu, and, together with the capital city Helsinki, it is one of Finland&#x27;s most significant tourist cities in terms of foreign tourism. In 2024, &quot;CNN&quot; listed Rovaniemi as &quot;one of the best places in the world to celebrate Christmas.&quot;

The city and the surrounding (Rural municipality of Rovaniemi) were consolidated into a single entity on 1 January 2006. Rovaniemi municipality has an approximate population of . The urban area of Rovaniemi has a population of 53,361, in an area of about . Rovaniemi is a monolingual Finnish-speaking municipality, and unusually for larger Finnish towns, it is also known by its Finnish name and spelling in the Swedish language.

The coat of arms of Rovaniemi was designed by Toivo Vuorela. Its explanation is &quot;in the green field, a silver pall with light-height upper branches; accompanied by a golden flame in the upper corner&quot;. It was approved on 15 August 1956 by the Rovaniemi Rural Municipal Council and confirmed on October 26 at the Ministry of the Interior as the coat of arms of the Rovaniemi Rural Council.

==Name==
The &quot;rova&quot; part in the name Rovaniemi has often been considered to be of Saami origin, as &#x27; in Northern Saami denotes a forested ridge or hill or the site of an old forest fire. The &quot;niemi&quot; part of the name means &quot;cape&quot;. The name of the town in the Saami languages spoken in Finland are , and &#x27; and .

==History==
Periodic clearance of new land for agriculture and the practice of slash-and-burn cultivation began around 750–530 BC. Artifacts found in the area suggest that an increasing number of travellers from Karelia in the east, Häme in the south and the Arctic Ocean coast in the north must have come there from 500 AD onwards. The Sami are indigenous to Sápmi.

Rovaniemi is first mentioned by name in official documents in 1453, existing as a set of small villages whose inhabitants earned their living mainly in agriculture and animal husbandry—with fishing and hunting the most important offshoots.

The exploitation of Lapland&#x27;s natural resources in the 1800s boosted Rovaniemi&#x27;s growth. Extensive logging sites and gold fever attracted thousands of people to Lapland. As the mining of natural resources was increased, Rovaniemi became the business centre of the province of Lapland.

The township decree was promulgated on 27 June 1928, as a result of which Rovaniemi seceded from the old rural municipality as its own market town on 1 January 1929.

===World War II===
During World War II, Finland signed the Moscow Armistice on 19 September 1944 and was required to expel forces of its former German ally. In the Lapland War retreating German forces utilised scorched earth tactics, and though initially German General Lothar Rendulic ordered only the public buildings in Rovaniemi to be destroyed, on 13 October 1944, the German army received orders to destroy all the buildings in Rovaniemi, only excluding hospitals and houses where inhabitants were present.

While the German rearguard was going about the destruction, an ammunition train in Rovaniemi station exploded and set fire to the wooden houses of the town. The German troops suffered many casualties, mainly from glass splinters. A Finnish commando unit claimed to have blown up the ammunition train and may well have been the primary cause of the town&#x27;s ruin. The cause was then unknown and assumed to be the deliberate intent of Rendulic. During these hostilities, 90% of all the buildings in Rovaniemi were destroyed. There is a German cemetery 19 km from Rovaniemi where soldiers killed fighting in Lapland during the war are buried.

Although there has been continuous human settlement in the Rovaniemi area since at least the Stone Age, few of the buildings date back before 1944, since most of the city was destroyed during World War II. When the city was rebuilt, it was designed with input by the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, who planned the city&#x27;s footprint in the shape of a reindeer&#x27;s head, with the city roads forming the antlers, and the local sports stadium as the reindeer&#x27;s eye.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Due to its location near the Arctic Circle, Rovaniemi has a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;) with short, pleasant summers, while the winters are long, cold and snowy. The city lies just south of the mean annual isotherm, but freezing in the soil is very limited even during the winter due to typical heavy snow cover. Its extreme northerly location combined with frequent overcast skies leads to very low levels of sunshine in the winter months; December averages just under six minutes of sunshine daily.

Winters are somewhat modified by marine air from the North Atlantic Current that ensures average temperatures are less extreme than expected for an inland area at such a northerly latitude. Nevertheless, Rovaniemi still has colder winters than areas at similar latitudes in Norway or Sweden.

On 26 April 2019, Rovaniemi recorded its warmest April day on record with .
The average annual temperature in Rovaniemi is . Snow stays on the ground 175 days a year on average. The lowest temperature ever recorded at the airport is , recorded on 28 January 1999. However, on the same day temperatures as cold as -47.5 C were recorded at nearby weather stations.
The highest temperature ever recorded is , recorded on 18 July 2018 at the railway station.

Despite the fact that Rovaniemi experiences polar day between 7 June and 6 July (30 days) it does not experience polar night. However, the sun barely gets above the horizon in the winter.

After winning the contest, a square called the Lordi&#x27;s Square (&quot;Lordin aukio&quot;) in the city center of Rovaniemi has been named after the band.

The video for the Nightwish single &quot;The Islander&quot; was filmed in Rovaniemi by Stobe Harju.
Rovaniemi used to have the northernmost location of any McDonald&#x27;s in the world from 1997 until the opening of a McDonald&#x27;s in Murmansk in 2013, 23 years after it first opened in that country. However, the title of the northernmost in the world returned to Rovaniemi in 2022, when in response to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, all Russian McDonald&#x27;s restaurants were closed, and rebranded to Vkusno i tochka. In January 2024, Rovaniemi once again lost the title of having the northernmost McDonald&#x27;s in the world as a new restaurant opened in Tromsø, Norway.

Rovaniemi appears as one location of Gavin Lyall&#x27;s 1963 book &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot;, a spy-thriller set in Lapland and the northern USSR.

Rovaniemi was featured in the first episode of &quot;The Reluctant Traveler&quot;.

Hallmark Media&#x27;s 2024 television film &quot;The Finnish Line&quot; features scenes shot in Santa Claus Village.

<text>A second language (L2) is a language spoken in addition to one&#x27;s first language (L1). A second language may be a neighbouring language, another language of the speaker&#x27;s home country, or a foreign language. A speaker&#x27;s dominant language, which is the language a speaker uses most or is most comfortable with, is not necessarily the speaker&#x27;s first language. For example, the Canadian census defines first language for its purposes as &quot;the first language learned in childhood and still spoken&quot;, recognizing that for some, the earliest language may be lost, a process known as language attrition. This can happen when young children start school or move to a new language environment.

==Second-language acquisition==

The distinction between acquiring and learning was made by Stephen Krashen as part of his Monitor Theory. According to Krashen, the &quot;acquisition&quot; of a language is a natural process; whereas &quot;learning&quot; a language is a conscious one. In the former, the student needs to partake in natural communicative situations. In the latter, error correction is present, as is the study of grammatical rules isolated from natural language. Not all educators in second language agree to this distinction; however, the study of how a second language is &quot;learned/acquired&quot; is referred to as &quot;second-language acquisition&quot; (SLA).

Research in SLA &quot;...focuses on the developing knowledge and use of a language by children and adults who already know at least one other language... [and] a knowledge of second-language acquisition may help educational policy makers set more realistic goals for programmes for both foreign language courses and the learning of the majority language by minority language children and adults.&quot;

SLA has been influenced by both linguistic and psychological theories. One of the dominant linguistic theories hypothesizes that a &quot;device&quot; or &quot;module&quot; of sorts in the brain contains innate knowledge. Many psychological theories, on the other hand, hypothesize that cognitive mechanisms, responsible for much of human learning, process language.

Other dominant theories and points of research include 2nd language acquisition studies (which examine if L1 findings can be transferred to L2 learning), verbal behaviour (the view that constructed linguistic stimuli can create a desired speech response), morpheme studies, behaviourism, error analysis, stages and order of acquisition, structuralism (approach that looks at how the basic units of language relate to each other according to their common characteristics), 1st language acquisition studies, contrastive analysis (approach where languages are examined in terms of differences and similarities) and inter-language (which describes the L2 learner&#x27;s language as a rule-governed, dynamic system). 
These theories have all influenced second-language teaching and pedagogy. There are many different methods of second-language teaching, many of which stem directly from a particular theory. Common methods are the grammar-translation method, the direct method, the audio-lingual method (clearly influenced by audio-lingual research and the behaviourist approach), the Silent Way, Suggestopedia, community language learning, the Total Physical Response method, and the communicative approach (highly influenced by Krashen&#x27;s theories). Some of these approaches are more popular than others, and are viewed to be more effective. Most language teachers do not use one singular style, but will use a mix in their teaching. This provides a more balanced approach to teaching and helps students of a variety of learning styles succeed.

===Effect of age===
The defining difference between a first language (L1) and a second language (L2) is the age the person learned the language. For example, linguist Eric Lenneberg used &quot;second language&quot; to mean a language consciously acquired or used by its speaker after puberty. In most cases, people never achieve the same level of fluency and comprehension in their second languages as in their first language. These views are closely associated with the critical period hypothesis.

In acquiring an L2, Hyltenstam found that around the age of six or seven seemed to be a cut-off point for bilinguals to achieve native-like proficiency. After that age, L2 learners could get &quot;near-native-like-ness&quot; but their language would, while consisting of few actual errors, have enough errors to set them apart from the L1 group. The inability of some subjects to achieve native-like proficiency must be seen in relation to the &quot;age of onset&quot; (AO). Later, Hyltenstam &amp; Abrahamsson modified their age cut-offs to argue that after childhood, in general, it becomes more and more difficult to acquire native-like-ness, but that there is no cut-off point in particular.

As we are learning more and more about the brain, there is a hypothesis that when a child is going through puberty, that is the time that accents &quot;start&quot;. Before a child goes through puberty, the chemical processes in the brain are more geared towards language and social communication. Whereas after puberty, the ability for learning a language without an accent has been rerouted to function in another area of the brain—most likely in the frontal lobe area promoting cognitive functions, or in the neural system of hormone allocated for reproduction and sexual organ growth.

As far as the relationship between age and eventual attainment in SLA is concerned, Krashen, Long, and Scarcella, say that people who encounter foreign language in early age, begin natural exposure to second languages and obtain better proficiency than those who learn the second language as an adult. However, when it comes to the relationship between age and rate SLA, &quot;Adults proceed through early stages of syntactic and morphological development faster than children (where time and exposure are held constant)&quot;. Also, &quot;older children acquire faster than younger children do (again, in early stages of morphological and syntactic development where time and exposure are held constant)&quot;. In other words, adults and older children are fast learners when it comes to the initial stage of foreign language education.

Gauthier and Genesee have done research which mainly focuses on the second language acquisition of internationally adopted children and results show that early experiences of one language of children can affect their ability to acquire a second language, and usually children learn their second language slower and weaker even during the critical period.

As for the fluency, it is better to do foreign language education at an early age, but being exposed to a foreign language since an early age causes a &quot;weak identification&quot;. Such issue leads to a &quot;double sense of national belonging,&quot; that makes one not sure of where they belong to because, according to Brian A. Jacob, multicultural education affects students&#x27; &quot;relations, attitudes, and behaviors&quot;. And as children learn more and more foreign languages, children start to adapt, and get absorbed into the foreign culture that they &quot;undertake to describe themselves in ways that engage with representations others have made&quot;. Due to such factors, learning foreign languages at an early age may incur one&#x27;s perspective of his or her native country.

===Similarities and differences between learned and native proficiency===
====Speed====
Acquiring a second language can be a lifelong learning process for many. Despite persistent efforts, most learners of a second language will never become fully &quot;native-like&quot; in it, although with practice considerable fluency can be achieved. However, children by around the age of 5 have more or less mastered their first language with the exception of vocabulary and a few grammatical structures, and the process is relatively very fast because language is a very complex skill. Moreover, if children start to learn a second language when they are seven years old or younger, they will also be fully fluent with their second language in a faster speed comparing to the speed of learning by adults who start to learn a second language later in their life.

====Correction====
In the first language, children do not respond to systematic correction. Furthermore, children who have limited input still acquire the first language, which is a significant difference between input and output. Children are exposed to a language environment of errors and lack of correction but they end up having the capacity to figure out the grammatical rules. Error correction does not seem to have a direct influence on learning a second language. Instruction may affect the rate of learning, but the stages remain the same. Adolescents and adults who know the rule are faster than those who do not.

In the learning of a second language the correction of errors remains a controversial topic with many differing schools of thought. Throughout the last century much advancement has been made in research on the correction of students&#x27; errors. In the 1950s and 60s, the viewpoint of the day was that all errors must be corrected at all costs. Little thought went to students&#x27; feelings or self-esteem in regards to this constant correction.

In the 1970s, Dulay and Burt&#x27;s studies showed that learners acquire grammar forms and structures in a pre-determined, inalterable order, and that teaching or correcting styles would not change that.

In 1977, Terrell&quot;s studies showing that there were more factors to be considered in the classroom than the cognitive processing of the students. He contested that the affective side of students and their self-esteem were equally important to the teaching process.

In the 1980s, the strict grammar and corrective approach of the 1950s became obsolete. Researchers asserted that correction was often unnecessary and that instead of furthering students&#x27; learning it was hindering them. The main concern at this time was relieving student stress and creating a warm environment for them. Stephen Krashen was a big proponent in this hands-off approach to error correction.

The 1990s brought back the familiar idea that explicit grammar instruction and error correction was indeed useful for the SLA process. At this time, more research started to be undertaken to determine exactly which kinds of corrections are the most useful for students. In 1998, Lyster concluded that &quot;recasts&quot;, the teacher repeating a student&#x27;s incorrect utterance with the correct version, are not always the most useful because students do not notice the correction. His studies in 2002 showed that students learn better when teachers help students recognize and correct their own errors. Mackey, Gas and McDonough had similar findings in 2000 and attributed the success of this method to the student&#x27;s active participation in the corrective processes.

====Depth of knowledge====
According to Noam Chomsky, children will bridge the gap between input and output by their innate grammar because the input (utterances they hear) is so poor but all children end up having complete knowledge of grammar. Chomsky calls it the Poverty of Stimulus. And second language learners can do this by applying the rules they learn to the sentence-construction, for example. So learners in both their native and second language have knowledge that goes beyond what they have received, so that people can make correct utterances (phrases, sentences, questions, etc) that they have never learned or heard before.

====Emotionality====
Bilingualism has been an advantage to today&#x27;s world and being bilingual gives the opportunity to understand and communicate with people with different cultural backgrounds. However, a study done by Optiz and Degner in 2012 shows that sequential bilinguals (i.e. learn their L2 after L1) often relate themselves to the emotions more when they perceive these emotions by their first language/native language/L1, but feel less emotional when by their second language even though they know the meaning of words clearly. The emotional distinction between L1 and L2 indicates that the &quot;effective valence&quot; of words is processed less immediate in L2 because of the delayed vocabulary/lexical access to these two languages.

====Success====
Success in language learning can be measured in two ways: likelihood and quality. First language learners &quot;will&quot; be successful in both measurements. It is inevitable that all people will learn a first language and with few exceptions, they will be fully successful. For second language learners, success is not guaranteed. For one, learners may become fossilized or &quot;stuck&quot; as it were with ungrammatical items. (Fossilization occurs when language errors become a permanent feature.) The difference between learners may be significant. As noted elsewhere, L2 learners rarely achieve complete &quot;native-like&quot; control of the second language.

For L2 pronunciation, there are two principles that have been put forth by Levis. The first is nativeness which means the speaker&#x27;s ability to approximately reach the speaking pattern of the second language of speakers; and the second, understanding, refers to the speaker&#x27;s ability to make themselves understood.
Being successful in learning a second language is often found to be challenging for some individuals. Research has been done to look into why some students are more successful than others. Stern, Rubin and Reiss are just a few of the researchers who have dedicated time to this subject. They have worked to determine what qualities make a &quot;good language learner&quot;. Some of their common findings are that a good language learner uses positive learning strategies, is an active learner who is constantly searching for meaning. Also a good language learner demonstrates a willingness to practice and use the language in real communication. He also monitors himself and his learning, has a strong drive to communicate, and has a good ear and good listening skills.

Özgür and Griffiths have designed an experiment in 2013 about the relationship between different motivations and second language acquisition. They looked at four types of motivations—intrinsic (inner feelings of learner), extrinsic (reward from outside), integrative (attitude towards learning), and instrumental (practical needs). According to the test results, the intrinsic part has been the main motivation for these student who learn English as their second language. However, students report themselves being strongly instrumentally motivated. In conclusion, learning a second language and being successful depend on every individual.

==Foreign language==


In pedagogy and sociolinguistics, a distinction is made between second language and foreign language, the latter is being learned for use in an area where that language is originally from another country and not spoken in the native country of the speakers. And in other words, foreign language is used from the perspective of countries; the second language is used from the perspective of individuals.

For example, English in countries such as India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, the Philippines, the Nordic countries and the Netherlands is considered a second language by many of its speakers, because they learn it young and use it regularly; indeed in parts of South Asia it is the official language of the courts, government and business. The same can be said for French in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, although French is not an official language in any of them. In practice, French is widely used in a variety of contexts in these countries, and signs are normally printed in both Arabic and French. A similar phenomenon exists in post-Soviet states such as Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, where Russian can be considered a second language, and there are large Russophone communities.

However, unlike in Hong Kong, English is considered a foreign language in China due to the lack of opportunities for use, such as historical links, media, conversation between people, and common vocabulary. Likewise, French would be considered a foreign language in Romania and Moldova, even though both French and Romanian are Romance languages, Romania&#x27;s historical links to France, and all being members of la Francophonie.

== Data ==
=== Weber&#x27;s report ===
George H. J. Weber, a Swiss businessman and independent scholar, founder of the Andaman Association and creator of the encyclopedic andaman.org Web site, made a report in December 1997 about the number of secondary speakers of the world&#x27;s leading languages. Weber used the Fischer Weltalmanach of 1986 as his primary and only source for the L2-speakers data, in preparing the data in the following table. These numbers are here compared with those referred to by Ethnologue, a popular source in the linguistics field. See below Table 1.
=== Later data ===

Collecting the number of second language speakers of every language is extremely difficult and even the best estimates contain guess work. The data below are from ethnologue.com as of June 2013.

<doc id="162997" wikidata="Q443797" url="?curid=162997" title="Joan Littlewood">
<text>Joan Maud Littlewood (6 October 1914 – 20 September 2002) was an English theatre director who trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and is best known for her work in developing the Theatre Workshop. She has been called &quot;The Mother of Modern Theatre&quot;. Her production of &quot;Oh, What a Lovely War!&quot; in 1963 was one of her more influential pieces.

Littlewood and her company lived and slept in the Theatre Royal while it was restored. Productions of &quot;The Alchemist&quot; and &quot;Richard II&quot;, the latter starring Harry H. Corbett in the title role, established the reputation of the company.

She also conceived and developed the concept of the Fun Palace in collaboration with architect Cedric Price, an experimental model of a participatory social environment that, although never realized, has become an important influence in the architecture of the 20th and 21st centuries.

&quot;Miss Littlewood&quot;, a musical written about Littlewood by Sam Kenyon, was performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2018.

==Early years==
Littlewood was born in Stockwell, London, and was educated at La Retraite Convent School in Clapham Park. She trained as an actress at RADA, but left after an unhappy start and moved to Manchester in 1934, where she met folksinger Jimmie Miller, who later became known as Ewan MacColl. After joining his troupe, Theatre of Action, Littlewood and Miller soon were married. After a brief move to London, they returned to Manchester and set up the Theatre Union in 1936.

==Career==
In 1941, Littlewood was banned from broadcasting on the BBC and her personnel file was marked by an MI5 officer as she was deemed a security risk. The ban was lifted two years later, when MI5 said she had broken off her association with the Communist Party. She was under surveillance by MI5 from 1939 until the 1950s.

In 1945, after the end of World War II, Littlewood, her husband the communist folk singer Ewan MacColl, and other Theatre Union members formed Theatre Workshop and registered it while staying at Ormesby Hall. The following eight years were spent touring. Shortly afterwards, when Gerry Raffles joined the troupe, MacColl and Littlewood divorced, though they still worked together for many years and Littlewood was godmother to MacColl&#x27;s two children. Littlewood and Raffles were life partners until his death in 1975.

In 1953, after an attempt to establish a permanent base in Glasgow, Theatre Workshop took up residence at the Theatre Royal in Stratford, east London, where it gained an international reputation, performing plays across Europe and in the Soviet Union. One of Littlewood&#x27;s most famous productions was the British première of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Mother Courage and Her Children&quot; (1955), which she directed and also starred in. Her production of &quot;Fings Ain&#x27;t Wot They Used T&#x27;Be&quot;, a musical about the London underworld, became a hit and ran from 1959 to 1962, transferring to the West End.

The works for which she is now best remembered are probably Shelagh Delaney&#x27;s &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; (1958), which gained critical acclaim, and the satirical musical &quot;Oh, What a Lovely War!&quot; (1963), her stage adaptation of a work for radio by Charles Chilton. Both were made into films. She received a Tony Award nomination for Best Direction of a Musical for &quot;Oh, What a Lovely War!&quot;, becoming the first woman nominated for the award. Theatre Workshop also championed the work of Irish playwright Brendan Behan.

==Later life and death==
After Raffles&#x27;s death in 1975, Littlewood left Theatre Workshop and stopped directing. After a time of drifting she settled in France and became the companion of Baron Philippe de Rothschild, the vintner and poet, and wrote his memoirs &quot;Milady Vine&quot;. In the mid-1980s, she commenced work on her 1994 autobiography, &quot;Joan&#x27;s Book&quot;.

Littlewood died in 2002 of natural causes at the age of 87 in the London flat of Peter Rankin.

== Portrayals ==

Littlewood was played by Zoë Wanamaker in the 2017 BBC Television drama &quot;Babs&quot;, about the life of Barbara Windsor.

<text>Dame Celia Elizabeth Johnson (18 December 1908 – 26 April 1982) was an English actress, whose career included stage, television and film. She is especially known for her roles in the films &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; (1942), &quot;This Happy Breed&quot; (1944), &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; (1945) and &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Paradise&quot; (1953). For &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;, she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. A six-time BAFTA Award nominee, she won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; (1969).

Johnson began her stage acting career in 1928, and subsequently achieved success in West End and Broadway productions. She continued performing in theatre for the rest of her life, though much of her later work was in television, including winning the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress for the BBC &quot;Play for Today&quot;, &quot;Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont&quot; (1973). She suffered a stroke in 1982 and died later the same day, aged 73.

==Early life and education==
Born in Richmond, Surrey, and nicknamed &quot;Betty&quot;, Johnson was the second daughter of John Robert Johnson and Ethel (née Griffiths) Johnson. Her first public performance was in 1916, when she played a role in a charity performance of &quot;King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid&quot; to raise funds for returned First World War soldiers.

She attended St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School in London from 1919 until 1926, and played the oboe in the school&#x27;s orchestra under Gustav Holst. She acted in school productions, but had no other acting experience, when she was accepted to study at Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1926, where she was in the same class as Margaretta Scott. She later spent a term in Paris, studying under Pierre Fresnay at the Comédie Française. She later recalled her choice of an acting career with the comment, &quot;I thought I&#x27;d rather like it. It was the only thing I was good at. And I thought it might be rather wicked.&quot;

==Career==
Her stage début, and first professional role, was as Sarah in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Major Barbara&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Huddersfield in 1928. She went to London the following year to take the place of Angela Baddeley in the part of Currita in &quot;A Hundred Years Old&quot;, which was performed at the Lyric Theatre in Hammersmith. In 1930 Johnson played in &quot;Cynara&quot; with Sir Gerald Du Maurier and Dame Gladys Cooper. She made her first trip to the United States the following year to star as Ophelia in a New York City production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

She returned to London, where she appeared in a number of minor productions, before establishing herself with a two-year run in &quot;The Wind and the Rain&quot; (1933–35). She married the journalist Peter Fleming in 1935, and in 1939 gave birth to their first child, a son. Her theatre career flourished with her portrayals of Elizabeth Bennet in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1940) and the second Mrs. de Winter in &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1940); the production of the latter was halted when the theatre was destroyed by a Luftwaffe bomb in September 1940.

During the Second World War Johnson lived with her widowed sister and sister-in-law, and helped care for their combined seven children. Unable to commit her time to the often lengthy run of a play, Johnson preferred the less time-consuming schedules of film and radio, which allowed her to devote time to her family and her work for the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Police Corps. She appeared in &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; (1942) and &quot;This Happy Breed&quot; (1944), both directed by David Lean and written by Noël Coward.

Lean and Coward sought Johnson for the next production, &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; (1945). She accepted the role with misgivings because of her family responsibilities, but was interested in the part, writing to her husband, &quot;There is no getting away from the fact that it is a very good part and one which I should love to play. I have found myself already planning how I should play bits and how I should say lines...&quot; A romantic drama about a conventional middle-class housewife who falls in love with a married doctor she meets in the refreshment room at a railway station, the film was well-received, and is now regarded as a classic. Johnson was awarded the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

After the war, Johnson concentrated on her family life, which included two daughters born in 1946 and 1947 and her occasional acting work was secondary for the following decade.

In 1957 she acted with Ralph Richardson in &quot;The Flowering Cherry&quot;. In 1958, she opened &quot;The Grass is Greener&quot;. As a member of Laurence Olivier&#x27;s National Theatre Company, Johnson appeared in the plays &quot;The Master Builder&quot; (1964) (with Olivier) and &quot;Hay Fever&quot; (1965), and later reprised her roles in the television productions.

==Awards==
For her role in &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; (1969), she received the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. She was created a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1958, &quot;for services to the theatre&quot;, and was raised to Dame Commander (DBE) in 1981.

==Personal life and death==
Johnson was married to Peter Fleming (who during the Second World War became a Lieutenant Colonel in the Special Operations Executive, and who was known as the author of travel literature such as &quot;Brazilian Adventure&quot; and non-fiction works including &quot;the Siege at Peking&quot;) from 1935 until Fleming&#x27;s death from a heart attack in 1971, while on a shooting expedition near Glencoe in Argyll, Scotland. He was the brother of the James Bond creator, Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve Commander, and MI6-SIS Information Research Division (IRD) spy Ian Fleming.

They had three children:
*Nicholas Peter Val Fleming (3 January 1939 – 9 May 1995), spent most of his life at the Fleming family home in Nettlebed, Oxfordshire, as a farmer. He was also a journalist, and the author of thriller novels published in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and a non-fiction historical work, &quot;August 1939&quot;. From his early twenties he lived with his partner Christopher Balfour, a merchant banker.
*Kate Fleming (born 1946), now Kate Grimond, is married to John Grimond (son of politician Jo Grimond), former foreign editor of the news magazine &quot;The Economist&quot;, now writer-at-large for the publication; the couple have three children. She is the author of &quot;Celia Johnson: A Biography&quot; (1991).
*Lucy Fleming (born Eve Lucinda Fleming, 15 May 1947), is an actress. In the 1970s she starred as Jenny in the BBC&#x27;s apocalyptic fiction series &quot;Survivors&quot;. She is married to the actor and writer Simon Williams.

Since the late 1990s, the two sisters, Kate Grimond and Lucy Fleming, have co-owned the Ian Fleming estate.

Johnson distanced herself from her acting career while her children were young, preferring to devote her attention to her family. She was described as a woman &quot;always ready to laugh&quot; and &quot;maternal in a light-hearted way&quot; and her daughter recalled that she was often torn between her desire to care for her family and her need to be involved in the &quot;mechanics&quot; of acting.

In 1982, she was touring with Sir Ralph Richardson in Angela Huth&#x27;s &quot;The Understanding&quot; and the play&#x27;s West End run had been announced. On one of her days off, she was at her home in Nettlebed, Oxfordshire, playing bridge with friends, when she collapsed from a stroke. She died a few hours later in her home. She left an estate worth £150,557.

==Legacy==
On 18 December 2008, to mark the centenary of her birth, a blue plaque was unveiled at her childhood home in Richmond. Among the guests at the ceremony were her daughters, Lucy Fleming and Kate Grimond. In &quot;The Times&quot;, Grimond noted that the &quot;tragedy of theatre&quot; is that even the best performances fade from memory, and that her mother&#x27;s current reputation rests almost entirely on her performance in &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;. Grimond noted that the advent of video allowed the film to be seen by a new audience, and that modern appraisals of the film had led to its being regarded as a classic.

<doc id="162999" wikidata="Q1537211" url="?curid=162999" title="Plesiochronous system">
<text>In telecommunications, a plesiochronous system is one where different parts of the system are almost, but not quite, perfectly synchronised. According to ITU-T standards, a pair of signals are plesiochronous if their significant instants occur at nominally the same rate, with any variation in rate being constrained within specified limits. A sender and receiver operate plesiosynchronously if they operate at the same nominal clock frequency but may have a slight clock frequency mismatch, which leads to a drifting phase. The mismatch between the two systems&#x27; clocks is known as the plesiochronous difference.

In general, plesiochronous systems behave similarly to synchronous systems, except they must employ some means in order to cope with &quot;sync slips&quot;, which will happen at intervals due to the plesiochronous nature of the system. The most common example of a plesiochronous system design is the plesiochronous digital hierarchy networking standard.

The asynchronous serial communication protocol is asynchronous on the byte level, but plesiochronous on the bit level. The receiver detects the start of a byte by detecting a transition that may occur at a random time after the preceding byte. The indefinite wait and lack of external synchronization signals makes byte detection asynchronous. Then the receiver samples at predefined intervals to determine the values of the bits in the byte; this is plesiochronous since it depends on the transmitter to transmit at roughly the same rate the receiver expects, without coordination of the rate while the bits are being transmitted.

The modern tendency in systems engineering is towards using systems that are either fundamentally asynchronous (such as Ethernet), or fundamentally synchronous (such as synchronous optical networking), and layering these where necessary, rather than using a mixture between the two in a single technology.

The term &quot;plesiochronous&quot; comes from the Greek πλησίος &quot;plesios&quot; (&quot;near&quot;) and χρόνος &quot;chrónos&quot; (&quot;time&quot;).

<doc id="163002" wikidata="Q36174" url="?curid=163002" title="Charles II of Spain">
<text>Charles II (6 November 1661 – 1 November 1700) was King of Spain from 1665 to 1700. The last monarch from the House of Habsburg, which had ruled Spain since 1516, he died without an heir, leading to the War of the Spanish Succession over his successor. 

For reasons still debated, Charles experienced lengthy periods of ill health throughout his life. This made the question of who would succeed him central to European diplomacy for much of his reign, one historian writing that &quot;from the day of his birth, they were waiting for his death&quot;. 

The two main candidates were the Austrian Habsburg Archduke Charles, and 16-year-old Philip of Anjou, grandson of Charles&#x27; half-sister Maria Theresa and Louis XIV of France. Shortly before his death in November 1700, Charles named Philip his heir, but the acquisition of an undivided Spanish Empire by either France or Austria threatened the European balance of power. Failure to resolve these issues through diplomacy resulted in the 1701 to 1714 War of the Spanish Succession.

==Birth and early years ==
Born 6 November 1661, Charles was the only surviving son of Philip IV of Spain and his second wife, his niece Mariana of Austria. Whilst marriage within the same extended family was then common, the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs were unusual in the extent to which they followed this practice. Of eleven marriages contracted by Spanish monarchs between 1450 and 1661, the vast majority contained some element of consanguinity, Philip and Mariana being one of two unions between uncle and niece. This policy may also have been driven by or &quot;blood purity&quot; statutes enacted in the early 16th century, which remained in use until the 1860s.

Inter-marriage accentuated the so-called &#x27;Habsburg jaw&#x27;, a physical characteristic common in both Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs. One contemporary reported this was so pronounced in Charles that he swallowed his food without thoroughly chewing, leading to frequent stomach problems. A 2019 study based on an analysis of Habsburg portraits concluded this feature was likely due to a recessive trait, but in the absence of genetic material such claims remain speculative.

The precise cause of Charles&#x27; ill-health remains disputed. Based on an analysis of contemporary accounts, some modern researchers argue they may have been due to one or more autosomal recessive disorders, others suggest an herpetic infection incurred as an infant, causing hydrocephalus. Consistent with either theory, neither his elder sister, Margaret Theresa of Spain, nor his niece, Maria Antonia, daughter of the marriage of Margaret Theresa of Spain to her maternal uncle Leopold I, had similar health issues. 

After his birth, he was entrusted to the royal governess Mariana Engracia Álvarez de Toledo Portugal y Alfonso-Pimentel. Under her careful supervision, he survived childhood attacks of measles, chickenpox, rubella and smallpox, any one of which was then potentially fatal. He also had rickets, which left him unable to walk unaided until he was four and to wear leg braces until the age of five. Suggestions that he was largely uneducated until his teens appear to be incorrect; Ramos del Manzano, a professor at the University of Salamanca and legal expert, was appointed his tutor when he was six. From the age of 12, he received lessons in music from Juan del Vado, and in mathematics by Jose Zaragoza, Professor at the Colegio Imperial de Madrid.

The extent of his physical and mental disabilities is hard to assess, since little is known for certain, and many claims either unproved or incorrect. While prone to illness, he was extremely active physically, and contemporaries reported he spent much of his time hunting. One often cited example of his alleged mental incapacity is the period he spent sleeping with his father&#x27;s disinterred body; this was in fact done under instructions from Mariana, whose doctors advised this would help him produce an heir. 

Although reputedly subject to bouts of depression, his participation in government and reports from his council and foreign observers such as the French ambassador Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Marquess of Torcy, indicate his mental capacities remained intact. A report from 1691 submitted by an envoy from the Sultan of Morocco, relates that he was received by Charles himself, who played a full part in the discussions. Costanzo Operti, a Savoyard diplomat who held regular audiences with Charles during the Nine Years&#x27; War, described him as affable and generous but shy and lacking self-confidence, characteristics noted by other foreign diplomats.

==Reign==
Since Charles was a legal minor when Philip died on 17 September 1665, Mariana was appointed Queen Regent by the Council of Castile. The Spanish Empire remained an enormous global confederation, but its economic supremacy was increasingly challenged by the Dutch Republic and England, and its position in Europe destabilised by the expansionist policies of Louis XIV of France. 

Her ability to respond effectively to the challenges facing the Empire was hampered by an ongoing power struggle with John Joseph of Austria, hereafter referred to as Don Juan, Charles&#x27;s older, illegitimate half-brother. In addition, enacting essential reforms was complicated since Spain was a personal union between the Crown of Castile and Crown of Aragon, each with very distinct political cultures and traditions. Infighting between those who ruled in Charles&#x27;s name during his regency did little to help, but it is debatable how far they can be held responsible for long-term trends predating his reign. The monarchy proved remarkably resilient, and when Charles died, remained largely intact.

However, government finances were in perpetual crisis, the Crown declaring bankruptcy nine times between 1557 and 1666, including 1647, 1652, 1662, and 1666. Following the policy established by her husband Philip, Mariana ruled through a &quot;&quot;, the first being her personal confessor and fellow Austrian, Juan Everardo Nithard. His most urgent task was to end the costly wars with France and Portugal, achieved in the 1668 treaties of Aix-la-Chapelle and Lisbon. Despite acknowledging their necessity, Don Juan forced Mariana to dismiss Nithard in February 1669, who replaced him with Fernando de Valenzuela. He was a member of the lower class, so his appointment was deeply resented by the &quot;Grandees&quot; who normally filled such positions.

In 1673, Spain was drawn into the Franco-Dutch War, placing additional strain on the economy, and Don Juan renewed efforts to remove Mariana as Regent. A month before Charles became a legal adult on 6 November 1675, he indicated his intention to take control of government, supported by his brother. When the Regency Council requested a two-year extension of their office on 4 November, Charles initially refused, but was later pressured into accepting. He was also forced to issue a Royal Decree ordering Don Juan to leave Madrid.

Don Juan finally gained control of the government in January 1678 and exiled Valenzuela to the Philippines. His first action was to make peace with France in the 1678 Treaties of Nijmegen, with Spain ceding Franche-Comté and areas of the Spanish Netherlands returned in 1668. Seeking to minimise future conflict between the two countries, in August 1679 Don Juan brokered a match between Charles and the 17-year-old Marie Louise of Orléans, eldest niece of Louis XIV and daughter of Philippe I, Duke of Orléans. Arranging the marriage was Don Juan&#x27;s last significant act; he died shortly before it took place in November 1679.

In February 1680, Juan Francisco de la Cerda, 8th Duke of Medinaceli became the new . He clashed with Marie-Louise over the alleged influence exerted over her by the French ambassador, Pierre de Villars, who was expelled from Madrid in 1681, badly affecting the relationship between the two. Medinaceli was further undermined by economic problems and the loss of Luxembourg following the 1683 War of the Reunions. In June 1684, he sought to bolster his support by appointing the Count of Oropesa as President of the Council of Castile, the second most powerful position in the state. However, continuing ill-health led him to resign in April 1685, with Oropesa taking over as de facto . He retained this position until 1690.

==Economy==
The so-called &quot;Little Ice Age&quot; of the 17th century was a period of crisis throughout Europe, leading to poor harvests and economic decline. Spain was especially affected, due in part to the parlous economic situation, particularly in Castile, where the population dropped from 6.5 million in 1600 to fewer than 5 million in 1680, whilst figures for Spain as a whole were 8.5 to 6.6 million. This was exacerbated by a series of wars with France and the need to defend the Empire, which were a constant drain on public expenditure. In 1663, Philip IV had converted state debt into government bonds, or &quot;juros&quot;, but high rates of interest meant taxes were often assigned to creditors years in advance to pay current liabilities. Although silver bullion imports from the Americas increased, the vast majority went to paying off foreign debtors.

The globalisation of the Spanish trading system meant outsiders often had the most to lose from its collapse. By the 1670s, the bulk of foreign trade was controlled by Dutch and English merchants, while the domestic economy relied on French labour and imported wheat. The Marqués de Varinas, a senior colonial official, observed in 1687 that the Empire continued to exist in its present form &quot;only because it enables the English, Dutch and French to exploit [it] more cheaply&quot;. 

In the 1680s, Spanish officials issued a series of drastic deflationary decrees, revaluing the coinage at 25% of its previous value. The immediate impact was the total disruption of commerce and collapse of financial credit; in response, debtors were given three months to repay government debts using the existing rate, later extended to six months. Having stabilised the position, in 1686 the coinage was readjusted to a more favourable rate and thereafter left unaltered.

==Succession conflict and death==
Marie Louise was blamed for Charles&#x27; failure to produce an heir, while primitive fertility treatments gave her severe intestinal problems. She died in February 1689, shortly after the outbreak of the Nine Years&#x27; War with France. On the basis of her recorded symptoms, modern doctors believe her illness was almost certainly appendicitis. A new wife was selected from a family famous for its fertility, Maria Anna of Neuburg, daughter of Philip William, Elector Palatine, and sister-in-law to Emperor Leopold. 

A proxy marriage took place in August 1689 before a formal ceremony in May 1690. Maria Anna also failed to produce an heir, almost certainly because Charles was by now physically incapable of doing so; his autopsy later revealed his sole remaining testicle was atrophied. His mother died on 16 May 1696, by which time Charles&#x27; health was clearly failing, making the succession increasingly urgent. Since the Crown of Spain passed according to cognatic primogeniture, it could be inherited through the female line. This enabled Charles&#x27; sisters Maria Theresa (1638–1683) and Margaret Theresa to pass their rights to the children of their marriages with Louis XIV and Emperor Leopold. However, to prevent a union between Spain and France, Maria Theresa had renounced her inheritance rights on her marriage; in return, Louis was promised a dowry of 500,000 gold écus, a huge sum that was never paid.

The Nine Years&#x27; War showed France could not achieve its objectives on its own; the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick was the result of mutual exhaustion and Louis&#x27;s search for allies in anticipation of a contest over the Spanish throne. Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor refused to sign since it left the issue unresolved; he reluctantly did so in October 1697, but viewed it as a pause in hostilities. In 1685, Leopold and Margaret&#x27;s daughter Maria Antonia married Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria; she died in 1692, leaving one surviving son, Joseph Ferdinand. In October 1698, France, England and the Dutch Republic attempted to impose a diplomatic solution to the Succession on Spain and Austria, by the Treaty of the Hague or First Partition Treaty. This made Joseph Ferdinand heir to the bulk of the Spanish monarchy, with France gaining the Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily and other concessions in Italy plus the modern Basque province of Gipuzkoa. Leopold&#x27;s younger son Archduke Charles became ruler of the Duchy of Milan, a possession considered vital to the security of Austria&#x27;s southern border.

The Spanish objected to their empire being divided by foreign powers without consultation, and on 14 November 1698, Charles II made Joseph Ferdinand heir to an independent and undivided Spanish monarchy. Maria Anna was appointed Regent during his minority, an announcement allegedly received by the Spanish councillors in silence. Joseph Ferdinand&#x27;s death in 1699 ended these arrangements. It also left Louis XIV&#x27;s eldest son, Louis, Grand Dauphin, heir to the Spanish throne, once again implying union between Spain and France. In March 1700, France, England and the Dutch agreed an alternative; Archduke Charles replaced Joseph Ferdinand, with Spanish possessions in Europe split between France, Savoy and Austria. Charles reacted by altering his will in favour of Archduke Charles, but once again stipulating an undivided and independent Spanish monarchy.

Most of the Castilian nobility disliked Maria Anna and her German courtiers and viewed a French candidate as more likely to ensure their independence. In September 1700, Charles became ill again; by 28 September he was no longer able to eat, and Luis Manuel Fernández de Portocarrero persuaded him to alter his will in favour of Louis XIV&#x27;s grandson, Philip of Anjou. He died on 1 November 1700, at age 38. The autopsy records his &quot;heart was the size of a peppercorn; his lungs corroded; his intestines rotten and gangrenous; he had a single testicle, black as coal, and his head was full of water.&quot; As suggested previously, the last of these symptoms is indicative of hydrocephalus, a disease often associated with childhood measles, one of many illnesses contracted by Charles.

Philip was proclaimed king of Spain on 16 November 1700, and the War of the Spanish Succession formally began on 9 July 1701.

==Legacy==
Charles&#x27; reign has traditionally been viewed as one of decline and decay, while in 1691, a foreign ambassador commented that &quot;it is incomprehensible how this monarchy survives&quot;. More recent studies argue &quot;both the myth of decline and an incapable king are simplistic and inexact&quot;. Despite their disastrous short-term impact, the financial measures taken by his advisors ended the chronic instability which had affected the Spanish currency throughout the 17th century, and helped drive sustainable economic growth. Many of the commercial and political policies initiated under Charles formed the basis for reforms enacted by his Bourbon successors.

His reign also saw the final political eclipse of the Spanish Inquisition, precipitated by its intervention in the succession crisis. When Charles changed his will in favour of Philip in 1700, the Inquisitor General Baltasar de Mendoza y Sandoval, an ally of Maria Anna, arrested his personal confessor Froilán Díaz on a charge of &#x27;bewitching&#x27; the King. When Díaz was found not guilty, Mendoza attempted to arrest those who voted for his acquittal, resulting in the establishment of a Council to investigate the Inquisition; although it survived until 1834, its influence had ended.

Though not as fond of the arts as his father, Charles employed artists such as the Italian painter Luca Giordano and Claudio Coello to decorate El Escorial. In 1690 the latter created one of the last and most significant examples of Spanish Baroque painting, &quot;Charles II adores the Holy Eucharist&quot;.

On 7 November 1693, a Royal Decree provided sanctuary in Spanish Florida for escaped slaves from the nearby colony of South Carolina. Despite its relative poverty, Spanish Florida provided protection from storms in the Gulf of Mexico for Spanish merchant shipping; the decree was intended to bolster its population while undermining the neighbouring colony, which claimed the Spanish capital of St Augustine. Formalised in 1733 by Philip, it led to the founding in 1738 of Santa Teresa de Mose, the first legally sanctioned free black town in the present-day United States.

The Caroline Islands and the town of Charleroi in modern Belgium were named after him in 1666 and 1686 respectively. Decrees were also issued in his name approving universities in South America that still exist. In Peru, they include San Cristóbal, established in 1680, and the National University; in Guatemala, the , the fourth-oldest university on the continent. Others include in 1688, now part of the Central University of Ecuador, and finally in 1694 the in Bogotá, Colombia.

<doc id="163003" wikidata="Q212457" url="?curid=163003" title="Louis I of Spain">
<text>Louis I (; 25 August 1707 – 31 August 1724) was King of Spain from 15 January 1724 until his death in August the same year. His reign is one of the shortest in history, lasting for just over seven months.

==Infante of Spain (1707–1709)==

Louis was born at Palacio del Buen Retiro, in Madrid as the eldest son of the reigning King Philip V of Spain and his wife Maria Luisa Gabriella of Savoy. He was named after his great-grandfather Louis XIV of France.

==Prince of Asturias (1709–1721)==

At birth he was the heir apparent but was not given the traditional title of &quot;Prince of Asturias&quot; until April 1709. In 1714, when Louis was seven, his mother died, leaving him and his brothers, &quot;Infante&quot; Philip and &quot;Infante&quot; Ferdinand. On 24 December 1714, Louis&#x27; father remarried to Elisabeth Farnese, the young heiress to the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza.

==Marriage (1722)==

As heir not only to the vast Spanish Empire, but also to a new dynasty, it was decided that Louis would take a wife as soon as possible. On 20 January 1722, at Lerma, he met and married his second cousin Louise Élisabeth d&#x27;Orléans, a daughter of Philippe, Duke of Orléans, cousin of Louis&#x27; father and then the Regent of France, who was two years his junior. He was fourteen and she was twelve. The dowry of this marriage was an enormous 4 million livres.

==King of Spain (1724)==

Louis ruled for a short period between the time his father Philip V abdicated in his favour (14 January 1724) and his death from smallpox, just over seven months. King Philip sent him a letter informing him of his decision. He calls his son a great king. Louis sent his father a humble reply, thanking him. Louis signed his letter as Prince of Asturias. His marital problems dominated during his reign. His father kept tabs on him from San Ildefonso. To counter his father&#x27;s influence, he surrounded himself with officials who had not served under Philip. His plans were to focus more on the American colonies rather than the lost Italian territories. On his death, his father returned to the throne, and reigned 22 more years until his own death in 1746. Louis was buried in the &quot;Cripta Real del Monasterio de El Escorial&quot; part of the El Escorial complex.

== Appearance and personality ==
Louis was tall and thin, with blond hair. He was considered unattractive and the similarity between him and his maternal grandfather, Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia, was notable. Apart from this, Louis had weak arms, which emphasized his delicacy.

Not much is known about Louis&#x27; personality. According to Vicente Bacallar, Marquis de San Felipe, he was &quot;extremely liberal, magnanimous and into making people to feel comfortable next to him&quot;. However, neither his liberty as king nor gentilism eclipsed his strong religiosity. Other contemporaries allegedly pointed out that Louis had inherited his father&#x27;s intelligence and charm and his mother&#x27;s morality and submission.

== Sexuality ==
Apart from these attributes, many have argued that Louis also inherited his father&#x27;s sexual appeal. He was reputedly bisexual, being initiated into such a practice by a servant, originally from Versailles. Historians believe that Lacotte, who was Louis&#x27; servant and who had a reputation of being a pedophile, was sent into the Spanish royal court to seduce the prince, whose impotence was known. W. Clarke writes: &quot;the Spanish heir was as into boys as girls during the parties that he had, playing erotic games with both sexes&quot;; a line about Louis&#x27; sexual life was sung across streets of Madrid: &quot;Fiery as his mother, lascivious as his father, flaming as his stepmother and onanist as a pedophile&quot;.

<doc id="163004" wikidata="Q961147" url="?curid=163004" title="René Daumal">
<text>René Daumal (; 16 March 1908 – 21 May 1944) was a French spiritual para-surrealist writer, critic and poet, best known for his posthumously published novel &quot;Mount Analogue&quot; (1952) as well as for being an early, outspoken practitioner of pataphysics.

==Biography==
Daumal was born in Boulzicourt, Ardennes, France. In his late teens his avant-garde poetry was published in France&#x27;s leading journals. As an adolescent, Daumal co-founded the art group &quot;Les Phrères Simplistes&quot; with the poets Roger Gilbert-Lecomte and Roger Vailland. They would later co-found the literary journal &quot;Le Grand Jeu&quot;, which published three issues between 1928 and 1930. Although courted by André Breton, the journal was founded as a counter to Surrealism and Dada; the Surrealists reacted to its publication with some hostility.

He is best known in the English-speaking world for two novels: &quot;A Night of Serious Drinking&quot;, and the allegorical novel &quot;Mount Analogue: A Novel of Symbolically Authentic Non-Euclidean Adventures in Mountain Climbing&quot;, both based upon his friendship with Alexander de Salzmann, a pupil of G. I. Gurdjieff.

Daumal was self-taught in the Sanskrit language and translated some of the Tripitaka Buddhist canon into the French language, as well as translating the literature of the Japanese Zen scholar D.T. Suzuki into French.

He married the Bulgarian émigré Vera Milanova, the former wife of the poet Hendrik Kramer; after Daumal&#x27;s death, she married the landscape architect Russell Page.

==Death==
Daumal&#x27;s sudden and premature death from tuberculosis on 21 May 1944 in Paris may have been hastened by youthful experiments with drugs and psychoactive chemicals, including carbon tetrachloride. He died leaving his novel &quot;Mount Analogue&quot; unfinished, having worked on it until the day of his death.

He is buried at Cimetière parisien de Pantin in Pantin, a municipality just outside Paris.

==Legacy==
The motion picture &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot; by Alejandro Jodorowsky is based largely on Daumal&#x27;s &quot;Mount Analogue&quot;.

<text>Genlock (generator locking) is a common technique where the video output of one source (or a specific reference signal from a signal generator) is used to synchronize other picture sources together. The aim in video applications is to ensure the coincidence of signals in time at a combining or switching point. When video instruments are synchronized in this way, they are said to be &quot;generator-locked&quot;, or &quot;genlocked&quot;.

== Possible problems ==

Video signals generated and output by generator-locked instruments are said to be . Syntonized video signals will be precisely frequency-locked, but because of delays caused by the unequal transmission path lengths, the synchronized signals will exhibit differing phases at various points in the television system. Modern video equipment such as production switchers that have multiple video inputs often include a variable delay on each input to compensate for the phase differences and time all the input signals to precise phase coincidence.

Where two or more video signals are combined or being switched between, the horizontal and vertical timing of the picture sources should be coincident with each other. If they are not, the picture will appear to jump when switching between the sources whilst the display device re-adjusts the horizontal and/or vertical scan to correctly reframe the image.

Where composite video is in use, the phase of the chrominance subcarrier of each source being combined or switched should also be coincident. This is to avoid changes in colour hue and/or saturation during a transition between sources.

== Scope ==

Generator locking can be used to synchronize as few as two isolated sources (e.g., a television camera and a videotape machine feeding a vision mixer (production switcher)), or in a wider facility where all the video sources are locked to a single synchronizing pulse generator (e.g., a fast-paced sporting event featuring multiple cameras and recording devices). Generator locking can also be used to ensure that multiple CRT monitors that appear in a movie are flicker-free. Generator locking is also used to synchronize two cameras for Stereoscopic 3D video recording.

In broadcast systems, an analog generator-lock signal usually consists of vertical and horizontal synchronizing pulses together with chrominance phase reference in the form of colorburst. No picture information is usually carried to avoid disturbing the timing signals, and the name &quot;reference&quot;, &quot;black and burst&quot;, &quot;color black&quot;, or &quot;black burst&quot; is usually given to such a signal. A composite colour video signal inherently carries the same reference signals and can be used as a generator-locking signal, albeit at the risk of being disturbed by out-of-specification picture signals.

Although some high-definition broadcast systems may use a standard-definition reference signal as a generator-locking reference signal, the use of tri-level synchronising pulses directly related to the frame and line rate is increasing within HD systems. A tri-level sync pulse is a signal that initially goes from 0 volts DC to a negative voltage, then a positive voltage, before returning to zero volts DC again. The voltage excursions are typically 300 mV either side of zero volts, and the duration each of the two excursions is the same as a particular number of digital picture samples.

== Connections ==

Most television studio and professional video cameras have dedicated generator-locking ports on the camera. If the camera is tethered with a triaxial cable or optical fibre cable, the analog generator-locking signal is used to lock the camera control unit, which in turn locks the camera head by means of information carried within a data channel transmitted along the cable. If the camera is an ENG-type camera, one without a triax/fibre connection or without a dockable head, the generator-locking signal is carried through a separate cable from the video.

== Variants ==

&quot;Natlock&quot; is a picture-source synchronizing system using audio tone signals to describe the timing discrepancies between composite video signals, while &quot;Icelock&quot; uses digital information conveyed in the vertical blanking interval of a composite video signal.

<text>A Night of Serious Drinking () is an allegorical novel, published 1938, by the French surrealist writer René Daumal. It was translated into English in 1979 by David Coward and E.A. Lovatt. In 2003 Overlook press published a new edition with an index and a scholarly introduction.

==Plot summary==
An unnamed narrator spends an evening getting drunk with a group of friends. As the party becomes intoxicated and exuberant, the narrator seemingly begins a journey that ranges from apparent paradises to hell. The fantastic world depicted in &quot;A Night of Serious Drinking&quot; is actually the ordinary world distorted and satirized. Various characters are termed Anthographers, Fabricators of useless objects, Scienters, Nibblists, Clarificators, and other absurd titles. Yet the inhabitants of these strange realms are only too familiar: scientists dissecting an animal in their laboratory, a wise man surrounded by his devotees, politicians, poets expounding their rhetoric. These characters perform humorous antics and intellectual games, which they consider to be attempts to find meaning.

In the second half of the book there is an early description of a linguistic strange loop (a set of verbal references which seem to repeat conceptually) which the character terms a &quot;Taglufon.&quot;

<doc id="163012" wikidata="Q182408" url="?curid=163012" title="Glenda Jackson">
<text>Glenda May Jackson (9 May 1936 – 15 June 2023) was an English actress and politician. Over the course of her distinguished career she received numerous accolades including two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, three Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and a Tony Award. A member of the Labour Party, she served continuously as a Member of Parliament (MP) for 23 years, first for Hampstead and Highgate from 1992 to 2010, and then, following boundary changes, for Hampstead and Kilburn from 2010 to 2015.

Jackson won the Academy Award for Best Actress twice, for the romance films &quot;Women in Love&quot; (1969) and &quot;A Touch of Class&quot; (1973), but she did not appear in person to collect either due to work commitments. She also won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; (1971). Her other notable films include &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; (1971), &quot;Hedda&quot; (1975), &quot;The Incredible Sarah&quot; (1976), &quot;House Calls&quot; (1978), &quot;Stevie&quot; (1978) and &quot;Hopscotch&quot; (1980). She won two Primetime Emmy Awards for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth I in the BBC series &quot;Elizabeth R&quot; (1971). She received both the BAFTA Award and International Emmy Award for her performance in &quot;Elizabeth Is Missing&quot; (2019).

She studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) and made her Broadway theatre debut in &quot;Marat/Sade&quot; (1966). She received five Laurence Olivier Award nominations for her West End theatre roles in &quot;Stevie&quot; (1977), &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; (1979), &quot;Rose&quot; (1980), &quot;Strange Interlude&quot; (1984) and &quot;King Lear&quot; (2016), the last being her first role after a 25-year absence from acting, which she reprised on Broadway in 2019. On Broadway, she won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for her role in the revival of Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;Three Tall Women&quot; (2018) and received nominations for her work in &quot;Marat/Sade&quot; (1966), &quot;Rose&quot; (1981), &quot;Strange Interlude&quot; (1985), and &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1988).

Jackson transitioned her career to politics from 1992 to 2015, and was elected MP for Hampstead and Highgate at the 1992 general election. She was a junior transport minister from 1997 to 1999 during the first Blair ministry; she later became critical of Tony Blair. After constituency boundary changes, she represented Hampstead and Kilburn from 2010. At the 2010 general election, her majority of 42 votes, confirmed after a recount, was the narrowest margin of victory in Great Britain. Jackson stood down at the 2015 general election and returned to acting.

==Early life and education==
Glenda May Jackson was born at 151 Market Street in Birkenhead, Cheshire, on 9 May 1936. Her mother named her after the Hollywood film star Glenda Farrell. Shortly after her birth, the family moved to Hoylake, also on the Wirral. Her family was very poor, and lived in a two-up two-down house with an outside toilet at 21 Lake Place. Her father Harry was a builder, while her mother Joan (née Pearce) worked in a local shop, pulled pints in a pub and was a domestic cleaner.

The eldest of four daughters, Jackson was educated at Holy Trinity Church of England and Cathcart Street primary schools, followed by West Kirby County Grammar School for Girls in nearby West Kirby. She performed in the Townswomen&#x27;s Guild drama group during her teens. Jackson made her first acting appearance in J. B. Priestley&#x27;s &quot;Mystery of Greenfingers&quot; in 1952 for the YMCA Players in Hoylake. She worked for two years in Boots the Chemists, before winning a scholarship in 1954 to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. Jackson moved to the capital to begin the course in early 1955.

==Acting career==

===1957–1968: Rise to prominence ===
In January 1957, Jackson made her professional stage debut in Ted Willis&#x27;s &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; at the Connaught Theatre in Worthing. This was followed by Terence Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;Separate Tables&quot;, while Jackson was still at RADA, and she began appearing in repertory theatre. She was also a stage manager at Crewe in repertory theatre.

From 1958 to 1961, Jackson went through a period of two and a half years in which she was unable to find acting work. She unsuccessfully auditioned for the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), and undertook what she later described as &quot;a series of soul-destroying jobs&quot;. This included waitressing at The 2i&#x27;s Coffee Bar, clerical work for a large City of London firm, answering phones for a theatrical agent, and a role at British Home Stores. She also worked as a Bluecoat at Butlin&#x27;s Pwllheli holiday resort on the Llŷn Peninsula in North West Wales, where her new husband and fellow actor Roy Hodges was a Redcoat. Jackson eventually returned to repertory theatre in Dundee, but worked in bars in between acting jobs.

Jackson made her film debut in a bit part in the kitchen sink drama &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; (1963). A member of the RSC for four years from 1963, she originally joined for director Peter Brook&#x27;s Theatre of Cruelty season, which included Peter Weiss&#x27;s &quot;Marat/Sade&quot; (1965), in which she played an inmate of an insane asylum portraying Charlotte Corday, the assassin of Jean-Paul Marat. The production ran on Broadway in 1965 and in Paris (Jackson also appeared in the 1967 film version). She appeared as Ophelia in Peter Hall&#x27;s production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; the same year. Critic Penelope Gilliatt thought Jackson was the only Ophelia she had seen who was ready to play the Prince himself.

The RSC&#x27;s staging at the Aldwych Theatre of &quot;US&quot; (1966), a protest play against the Vietnam War, also featured Jackson, and she appeared in its film version, &quot;Tell Me Lies&quot;. Later that year, she starred in the psychological drama &quot;Negatives&quot; (1968), which was not a huge financial success, but won her more good reviews.

===1969–1980: Breakthrough and acclaim ===
Jackson&#x27;s starring role in Ken Russell&#x27;s film adaptation of D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Women in Love&quot; (1969) led to her first Academy Award for Best Actress. Brian McFarlane, the main author of &quot;The Encyclopedia of British Film&quot;, wrote: &quot;Her blazing intelligence, sexual challenge and abrasiveness were at the service of a superbly written role in a film with a passion rare in the annals of British cinema.&quot; In the process of gaining funding for &quot;The Music Lovers&quot; (1970) from United Artists, Russell explained it as &quot;the story of a homosexual who marries a nymphomaniac&quot;, the couple being the composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (Richard Chamberlain) and Antonina Miliukova, played by Jackson. The film received mixed reviews in the US; the anonymous reviewer in &quot;Variety&quot; wrote of the two principals, &quot;Their performances are more dramatically bombastic than sympathetic, or sometimes even believable.&quot; &quot;The Music Lovers&quot; was a box-office success in Europe, reaching No. 1 in the UK&#x27;s weekly rankings in March 1971. It was the first of four films starring Jackson which topped the box-office charts in the UK. Jackson was initially interested in the role of Sister Jeanne in &quot;The Devils&quot; (1971), Russell&#x27;s next film, but turned it down after script rewrites and deciding that she did not wish to play a third neurotic character in a row.
Jackson had her head shaved to play Queen Elizabeth I in the BBC&#x27;s serial &quot;Elizabeth R&quot; (1971). After the series aired on PBS in the US, she received two Primetime Emmy Awards for her performance. She also played Queen Elizabeth in the film &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots;&quot; and gained an Academy Award nomination as well as a BAFTA Award for her role in John Schlesinger&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; (both 1971). In July, &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; topped the UK box-office charts for two weeks. That year, British exhibitors voted her the sixth most popular star at the British box office. Jackson&#x27;s popularity was such that 1971 saw her receive Best Film Actress awards from the Variety Club of Great Britain (who also rewarded her similarly in 1975 and 1978), the New York Film Critics and the US National Society of Film Critics. &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; was premièred in December 1971 in Los Angeles and was the 1972 Royal Film Performance in Britain, attended by the Queen Mother, Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon. The film reached No. 1 in the UK box-office charts in April that year, a position it held for five consecutive weeks. 

Jackson made the first of several appearances with Morecambe and Wise in their 1971 Christmas special. Appearing in a comedy sketch as Cleopatra for the BBC &quot;Morecambe and Wise Show&quot;, she delivered the line, &quot;All men are fools and what makes them so is having beauty like what I have got.&quot; Her later appearances included a song-and-dance routine (where she was pushed offstage by Eric), a period drama about Queen Victoria, and another musical routine (in their Thames Television series) where she was elevated ten feet in the air by a misbehaving swivel chair. Jackson and Wise also appeared in a 1981 information film for the Blood Transfusion Service.

Filmmaker Melvin Frank saw Jackson&#x27;s comedy skills in the &quot;Morecambe and Wise Show&quot; and offered her the lead female role in his romantic comedy &quot;A Touch of Class&quot; (1973), co-starring George Segal, which was a UK box-office No. 1 in June 1973. In February 1974, Jackson&#x27;s role in the film won her the Academy Award for Best Actress. She continued to work in the theatre, returning to the RSC for the lead in Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;. A later film version directed by Trevor Nunn was released as &quot;Hedda&quot; (1975), for which Jackson was nominated for an Oscar. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby wrote: &quot;This version of &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; is all Miss Jackson&#x27;s Hedda and, I must say, great fun to watch ... Miss Jackson&#x27;s technical virtuosity is particularly suited to a character like Hedda. Her command of her voice and her body, as well as the Jackson mannerisms, have the effect of separating the actress from the character in a very curious way.&quot; 

In 1978, she starred in the romantic comedy &quot;House Calls,&quot; co-starring Walter Matthau, with the film spending two weeks at No. 1 in the US box-office rankings. &quot;House Calls&quot; was the biggest box-office hit of her career in the United States. That year, she was awarded a CBE. In 1979, she reunited with her &quot;A Touch of Class&quot; colleagues Segal and Frank for the romantic comedy &quot;Lost and Found&quot;. Jackson and Matthau teamed again in the comedy &quot;Hopscotch&quot; (1980), which debuted at No. 1 in its opening weekend at the US box office, also spending its second week in the top spot.

===1980–1991: Established actor ===
For her 1980 appearance on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, Jackson told the producers she would perform any material they liked. In her appearance, she has a delusion that she is a pirate captain who takes over the Muppet Theatre as her ship. Fifteen years after the New York engagement of &quot;Marat/Sade&quot;, Jackson returned to Broadway in Andrew Davies&#x27;s &quot;Rose&quot; (1981) opposite Jessica Tandy; both actresses received Tony nominations for their roles. In September 1983, The Glenda Jackson Theatre in Birkenhead was named in her honour. The theatre was attached to Wirral Metropolitan College, but demolished in 2005 following the establishment of a purpose-built site for students.
In 1985, she played Nina Leeds in a revival of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Strange Interlude&quot; at the Nederlander Theatre in a production which had originated in London the previous year and ran for eight weeks. John Beaufort for &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; wrote: &quot;Bravura is the inevitable word for Miss Jackson&#x27;s display of feminine wiles and brilliant technique.&quot; Frank Rich in &quot;The New York Times&quot; thought Jackson, &quot;with her helmet of hair and gashed features&quot;, when Leeds is a young woman, &quot;looks like a cubist portrait of Louise Brooks&quot;, and later when the character has aged several decades, is &quot;mesmerizing as a Zelda Fitzgeraldesque neurotic, a rotting and spiteful middle-aged matron and, finally, a spent, sphinx-like widow happily embracing extinction.&quot; Herbert Wise directed the drama on television where it was first broadcast in the US as part of PBS&#x27;s &quot;American Playhouse&quot; in 1988.

In November 1984, Jackson appeared in the title role of Robert David MacDonald&#x27;s English translation of Racine&#x27;s &quot;Phèdre&quot;, titled &quot;Phedra&quot;, at The Old Vic. The play was designed and directed by Philip Prowse, and Robert Eddison played Theramenes. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s John Barber wrote of her performance, &quot;Wonderfully impressive ... The actress finds a voice as jagged and hoarse as her torment&quot;. Benedict Nightingale in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; was intrigued that Jackson did not go in for nobility, but played Racine&#x27;s feverish queen as if to say that &quot;being skewered in the guts by 
Cupid is an ugly, bitter, humiliating business&quot;. The costume which Prowse designed for Jackson&#x27;s performance is in the Victoria and Albert Museum, and iconic photographs of Jackson in the role can be found online.

In 1989, Jackson appeared in Ken Russell&#x27;s &quot;The Rainbow&quot;, playing Anna Brangwen, mother of Gudrun, the part for which she had won her first Academy Award twenty years earlier. The same year, she played Martha in a Los Angeles production of Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; at the Doolittle Theatre (now the Ricardo Montalbán Theatre). Directed by the playwright himself, this staging featured John Lithgow as George. Dan Sullivan in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that Jackson and Lithgow performed &quot;with the assurance of dedicated character assassins, not your hire-and-salary types&quot; with the actors being able to display their character&#x27;s capacity for antipathy. Albee was disappointed with this production, pointing to Jackson, who he thought &quot;had retreated back to the thing she can do very well, that ice cold performance. I don&#x27;t know whether she got scared, but in rehearsal she was being Martha, and the closer we got to opening the less Martha she was!&quot; She performed the lead role in Howard Barker&#x27;s &quot;Scenes from an Execution&quot; as Galactia, a sixteenth-century female Venetian artist, at the Almeida Theatre in 1990. It was an adaptation of Barker&#x27;s 1984 radio play in which Jackson had played the same role.

===2015–2023: Return to acting===

In 2015, Jackson returned to acting following a 23-year absence, having retired from politics. She took the lead role of Dide, the ancient matriarch, in &quot;Blood, Sex and Money&quot;, a radio drama series based on the &quot;Les Rougon-Macquart&quot; novel series by Émile Zola and aired on Radio 4 from November 2015 to October 2016. She returned to the stage at the end of 2016, playing the title role in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; at the Old Vic Theatre in London, in a production running from 25 October to 3 December. Jackson was nominated for Best Actress at the Olivier Awards for her role but ultimately lost out to Billie Piper. She won the Natasha Richardson Award for Best Actress at the 2017 Evening Standard Theatre Awards for her performance. Dominic Cavendish of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; wrote, &quot;Glenda Jackson is tremendous as King Lear. No ifs, no buts. In returning to the stage at the age of 80, 25 years after her last performance (as the Clytemnestra-like Christine in Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot; at the Glasgow Citizens), she has pulled off one of those 11th-hour feats of human endeavour that will surely be talked about for years to come by those who see it.&quot;

In 2018, Jackson returned to Broadway in a revival of Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;Three Tall Women&quot; acting alongside Laurie Metcalf and Allison Pill. The role earned her the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. Marilyn Stasio of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Watching Glenda Jackson in theatrical flight is like looking straight into the sun. Her expressive face registers her thoughts while guarding her feelings. But it&#x27;s the voice that really thrills. Deeply pitched and clarion clear, it&#x27;s the commanding voice of stern authority. Don&#x27;t mess with this household god or she&#x27;ll turn you to stone.&quot; Jackson returned to the title role of &quot;King Lear&quot; on Broadway in a production that opened in April 2019. Director Sam Gold described her portrayal of Lear in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;: &quot;She is going to go through something most people don&#x27;t go through. You&#x27;re all invited. Glenda Jackson is going to endure this, and you&#x27;re going to witness it.&quot; In 2019, after a 27-year absence, Jackson returned to television drama, portraying an elderly grandmother struggling with dementia in &quot;Elizabeth Is Missing&quot; on BBC One, based on the novel of the same name by Emma Healey, for which she won the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress and International Emmy Award for Best Actress. From February 2020 to January 2022, she starred in the lead role of Constance Sterling in the radio drama series &quot;Fault Lines: Money, Sex and Blood&quot; for Radio 4, another adaptation of &quot;Les Rougon-Macquart&quot;.

In February 2021, it was reported that Jackson would star with Michael Caine in &quot;The Great Escaper&quot;, a film telling the true story of Bernard Jordan&#x27;s escape from his care home to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings in France. Caine would play Jordan, with Jackson as his wife Rene. Caine and Jackson previously starred together in &quot;The Romantic Englishwoman&quot; (1975). Jackson had completed filming on &quot;The Great Escaper&quot; in September 2022; it was to be her last film. It was released on 6 October 2023. In July 2022, the British Film Institute celebrated her film and television career with a month-long retrospective season at the BFI Southbank in London. As well as screenings of her work, the programme included &quot;Glenda Jackson in Conversation&quot;, in which she was interviewed about her career live on stage by broadcaster John Wilson.

== Political career ==
Jackson joined the Labour Party in the early 1950s, at the age of 16. Her earlier campaigns were not party political. In 1978, she was one of the public figures who lent their name as a sponsor to the Anti-Nazi League. The same year, she appeared in a print advertisement for Oxfam. Jackson was on the executive of the National Association of Voluntary Hostels, and spoke at rallies for the housing charity Shelter. Human rights were also an area of interest, and she joined a demonstration outside the Indonesian Embassy to protest against the detention of political prisoners. She was involved in children&#x27;s charities, as president of the Toy Libraries Association and as a programme narrator for UNICEF. She also gave time and money to a home for emotionally disturbed children in Berkshire run by former actress Coral Atkins.

Jackson was a supporter of the National Abortion Campaign, and organised a benefit evening for them at the Cambridge Theatre, which raised over £3,000. She also supported Una Kroll&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Rights candidacy for Sutton and Cheam in the October 1974 United Kingdom general election. In addition, Jackson made several appearances on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Any Questions?&quot; debate programme during this period of her career. She had considered becoming a social worker, and in 1979 began a social science degree at the Open University, but dropped out a few months later after falling behind with her essays. Jackson appeared in a number of charity films, including a production on behalf of International Year of the Child, Voluntary Service Overseas, and Oxfam. Other such films featured her campaigning against polio and the arms trade.

=== Labour Party ===
Jackson&#x27;s name was linked to several parliamentary seats over the years; she was approached by a Constituency Labour Party (CLP) in Bristol to stand at the 1979 general election, but this did not materialise. An approach was also made to her about the possibility of being a candidate for the marginal Welsh seat of Bridgend at the 1983 general election, which she turned down to pursue a humanities degree at Thames Polytechnic. Though she was seen in the refectory at Thames a few times, she dropped out before starting the course. In that election, she supported Paul Boateng and Ian Wilson, Labour&#x27;s candidates for Hertfordshire West and Watford, respectively. She was also a member of the Arts for Labour group.

In 1986, Jackson visited Ethiopia as part of Oxfam&#x27;s efforts to help with the famine there, and in 1989 she approached Voluntary Service Overseas about the chance of working in Africa for a couple of years. She got involved in the African National Congress campaign against apartheid in South Africa, and in September 1988 chaired a United Nations committee on the cultural boycott. Jackson appeared in a party political broadcast for Labour in February 1987. In June, she was present at a campaign rally with the then Labour leader Neil Kinnock for the 1987 general election.

In December 1989, it was rumoured that Jackson had been approached by two branches of Leeds East CLP to succeed their Labour MP, Denis Healey. According to her biographer Chris Bryant, she turned down this opportunity. In late 1989, two members of Hampstead and Highgate CLP got in touch with Jackson about the possibility of standing there. Despite having never been to a Labour ward meeting, she won over the local party, and triumphed in the ballot, which took place on 28 March 1990. Jackson defeated three candidates who were all politically to her left: Kate Allen (Ken Livingstone&#x27;s partner and a Camden councillor), economic history lecturer Sarah Palmer (daughter of former Labour MP Arthur Palmer) and Maureen Robinson, a previous Mayor of Camden.

Jackson later stated that she felt Britain was being &quot;destroyed&quot; by the policies of the then prime minister of the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher, and the Conservative government, so that she was willing to do &quot;anything that was legal&quot; to oppose them. In November 1990, Thatcher stood down as prime minister and leader of the Conservative Party. On Thatcher&#x27;s death, Jackson protested Parliament&#x27;s tributes to that legacy. 

=== In Parliament ===
Jackson retired from acting in 1991 to devote herself to politics full-time as the prospective parliamentary candidate for Hampstead and Highgate. Although her party did not win the 1992 general election, as had been speculated, there was an above average swing to Labour in her constituency {with questions raised over the number of deceased persons voting}, and she gained the seat, narrowly beating the Conservative candidate Oliver Letwin, a former adviser to Thatcher. Jackson, whose campaign had been sponsored by the train drivers&#x27; union, ASLEF, was the first of Labour&#x27;s 1992 intake to join the front bench when she became shadow transport minister in July 1996.

Following Labour&#x27;s landslide victory in the 1997 general election, which saw her comfortably re-elected, she was appointed as a junior minister in the government of Tony Blair, with responsibility in the London Regional Transport. She resigned from the post in 1999 before an unsuccessful attempt to be nominated as the Labour candidate for the election of the first mayor of London in the 2000 London mayoral election. In the 2000 London Labour Party mayoral selection, she came a distant third behind Frank Dobson and Ken Livingstone, being eliminated in the first round of voting with 4.4% of the total. Jackson was once again re-elected to represent her constituency at the 2001 general election.

As a high-profile backbencher, Jackson became a regular critic of Blair over his plans to introduce higher education tuition fees in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. She also called for him to resign following the Judicial Enquiry by Lord Hutton in 2003 surrounding the reasons for going to war in Iraq and the death of government adviser David Kelly. At the subsequent 2005 general election, she held her seat, albeit with a reduced majority and a swing to the Conservatives, who had selected local councillor Piers Wauchope. By October 2005, her disagreements with Blair&#x27;s leadership swelled to a point where she threatened to challenge the prime minister as a stalking horse candidate in a leadership contest if he did not stand down within a reasonable amount of time. On 31 October 2006, Jackson was one of 12 Labour MPs to back Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party&#x27;s call for an inquiry into the Iraq War.

Her constituency boundaries changed for the 2010 general election. The Gospel Oak and Highgate wards became part of Holborn and St Pancras, and the new Hampstead and Kilburn constituency took in territory from Brent to include Brondesbury, Kilburn and Queens Park wards (from the old Brent East and Brent South seats). On 6 May 2010, Jackson was elected as the MP for the new Hampstead and Kilburn constituency by a margin of 42 votes over Conservative Chris Philp, with the Liberal Democrat candidate Edward Fordham less than a thousand votes behind them. She had the closest result in England, and the second smallest majority of any MP at the 2010 election. Jackson&#x27;s seat was marginal for most of her time in politics, with the 1997 election being the only occasion on which she received an absolute majority of votes cast in the constituency.

In June 2011, Jackson announced that, presuming the UK Parliament elected in 2010 lasted until 2015, she would not seek re-election. She stated: &quot;I will be almost 80 and by then it will be time for someone else to have a turn.&quot; The eventual election was held two days before her 79th birthday, 23 years after she had first entered the House of Commons. In April 2012, the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; reported that, in 2007–2008 she claimed £136,793 in allowances despite turning up for only 27 per cent of votes and speaking in just two debates, and that in 2011 she had to repay more than £8,000 in expenses she had wrongly claimed.

On 10 April 2013, Jackson delivered a speech in the House of Commons following the death of Margaret Thatcher, which subsequently went viral. She accused Thatcherism of treating &quot;vices as virtues&quot; and stated that, because of Thatcherism, the UK was susceptible to unprecedented unemployment rates and homelessness, chronically underfunded schools and public services, and the closure of mental hospitals. Another speech of Jackson&#x27;s went viral in June 2014 when she gave a scathing assessment of Iain Duncan Smith&#x27;s tenure as Work and Pensions Secretary, telling him that he was responsible for the &quot;destruction of the welfare state and the total and utter incompetence of his department&quot;.

=== Views ===
Jackson was a borderline socialist, and was generally considered to be a traditional leftist during her political career, often disagreeing with the dominant Blairite governing Third Way faction in the Labour Party; she rebelled against her party in parliamentary votes on a number of occasions. She was also opposed to the politics of Arthur Scargill and the Militant tendency that dominated the party&#x27;s battles in the 1980s. Jackson labelled Militant and Derek Hatton&#x27;s politics as &quot;self-indulgent crap&quot;, and she sent leader Neil Kinnock a congratulatory telegram after his high-profile 1985 Labour Party Conference speech, in which he criticised the activities of Militant and their allies. Jackson opposed the British monarchy, and was a republican. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Simon Hattenstone summed up Jackson&#x27;s views as &quot;traditional Labour, solidarity, feminism&quot;. Jackson had been an outspoken feminist, criticising the lack of gender equality for women.

In the 1992 Labour Party leadership election, Jackson supported the successful candidate, John Smith. In the 1994 leadership election, she backed Tony Blair, who won the contest and subsequently became prime minister. Jackson voiced her support for Blair&#x27;s successor Gordon Brown as prime minister in 2008. Brown appeared with Jackson on a campaign visit for the 2010 general election, with him describing her as &quot;a very close friend&quot;. In the 2010 leadership election, with Brown having stood down, Jackson voted for David Miliband, considered to be more of a political moderate than his younger brother, Ed Miliband, a figure on the party&#x27;s soft left who was ultimately elected as party leader. Following her departure from Parliament, the Labour Party elected Jeremy Corbyn as its leader. Jackson stated that she supported him &quot;as a person&quot;, and would have nominated him in the 2015 leadership election. She qualified her support, adding: &quot;Never in a million years would I have voted for him, though.&quot;

In the 1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, Jackson voted against Britain continuing in the European Economic Community. She subsequently changed her mind on the issue, and supported Britain remaining in the European Union in the 2016 Brexit referendum. Despite this, she disagreed with calls for a second vote, such as by People&#x27;s Vote. To this effect, she stated her admiration for the then prime minister Theresa May; when this subject matter was queried by the interviewer, &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Emma Brockes, Jackson responded: &quot;I&#x27;ve certainly admired her in the way she has handled herself over Brexit, yes! I do admire her for her tenacity, trying to deliver the referendum result to the people of our country, even though I disapproved of it.&quot;

Interviewed in July 2020, shortly after Keir Starmer had taken over as party leader from Corbyn, Jackson declared herself happy with him in the role. In July 2022, she commented on Starmer, saying: &quot;I just wish Keir would get someone to help him develop his voice.&quot; She called it &quot;one of his big drawbacks&quot;. That same month, she said that Parliament had not been welcoming to women when she was voted in during the 1992 general election.

==Personal life==
=== Marriage and relationships ===
In 1957, Jackson met Roy Hodges, a stage manager and fellow actor in their repertory theatre company. The pair soon embarked upon a relationship. Jackson and Hodges were married on 2 August 1958 at St Marylebone Register Office in London. Their son, Daniel Pearce Jackson Hodges, was born in 1969; Jackson was six months pregnant when filming on &quot;Women in Love&quot; was completed. Daniel is a former Labour Party adviser and commentator, who works as a newspaper columnist for &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;. When told by her son that he was going to write for a Conservative newspaper, Jackson replied, &quot;Well, I&#x27;ll have to emigrate!&quot;

Jackson&#x27;s marriage was running into difficulties by the early 1970s, and in 1975, she began an affair with Andy Phillips, the lighting director for the production of &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; in which she was starring at the time. Hodges sued Jackson for divorce on the grounds of her adultery with Phillips in November that year, and they were divorced in 1976. Jackson and Phillips were in an on-off relationship until 1981. It was reported in 2016 that she had been &quot;happily single for decades&quot;.

=== Interests ===
During the early years of her career, Jackson and her husband lived in Swiss Cottage, northwest London, an area she would later represent as an MP. In the late 1960s, the pair moved to Blackheath, southeast London. Later, she lived in a basement granny flat there, with her son, daughter-in-law and grandson upstairs. Jackson listed her interests in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; as cooking, gardening and reading Jane Austen.

===Death===
Jackson died at her Blackheath home on 15 June 2023, at the age of 87 following a brief illness. In tribute to Jackson, on the day of her death, the BBC broadcast a repeat of her interview with John Wilson first shown in an edition of &quot;This Cultural Life&quot; in October 2022, followed by the 2019 drama &quot;Elizabeth Is Missing&quot;.

<text>Henry Kenneth Alfred Russell (3 July 1927 – 27 November 2011) was a British film director, known for his pioneering work in television and film and for his flamboyant and controversial style. His films were mainly liberal adaptations of existing texts, or biographies, notably of composers of the Romantic era. Russell began directing for the BBC, where he made creative adaptations of composers&#x27; lives which were unusual for the time. He also directed many feature films independently and for studios.

Russell is best known for his Academy Award-winning romantic drama film &quot;Women in Love&quot; (1969); the historical drama horror film &quot;The Devils&quot; (1971); the musical fantasy film &quot;Tommy&quot; (1975), featuring the Who; and the science fiction horror film &quot;Altered States&quot; (1980). Russell also directed several films based on the lives of classical music composers, such as Elgar, Delius, Tchaikovsky, Mahler, and Liszt.

Film critic Mark Kermode, speaking in 2006, and attempting to sum up the director&#x27;s achievement, called Russell &quot;somebody who proved that British cinema didn&#x27;t have to be about kitchen-sink realism—it could be every bit as flamboyant as Fellini. Later in his life he turned to making low-budget experimental films such as &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Mouth&quot; and &quot;Revenge of the Elephant Man&quot;, and they are as edgy and &#x27;out there&#x27; as ever&quot;.

==Early life==
Russell was born in Southampton, Hampshire, England, on 3 July 1927, the elder of two sons of Ethel (née Smith) and Henry Russell, a shoeshop owner. His father was distant and took out his rage on his family, so Russell spent much of his time at the cinema with his mother, who was mentally ill. He cited the films &quot;Die Nibelungen&quot; and &quot;The Secret of the Loch&quot; as two early influences.

He was educated at private schools in Walthamstow and at Pangbourne College, and studied photography at Walthamstow Technical College (now part of the University of East London).

===Military service===
He harboured a childhood ambition to be a ballet dancer but instead joined the Royal Air Force and the British Merchant Navy as a teenager. On one occasion he was made to stand watch in the blazing sun for hours on end while crossing the Pacific Ocean, because his mentally ill captain feared an attack by Japanese midget submarines despite the Pacific War having ended. He moved into television work after short careers in dance and photography.

==Career==
===Photography===
In 1954 Russell started work as a local-interest freelance photographer. His series of documentary &#x27;Teddy Girl&#x27; photographs were published in &quot;Picture Post&quot; magazine in June 1955, and he continued to work as a freelance documentary photographer until 1959.

During this time, he started directing short films: &quot;Peepshow&quot; (1956), &quot;Knights on Bikes&quot; (1956), and &quot;Lourdes&quot; (1959). He received a lot of acclaim for his short &quot;Amelia and the Angel&quot; (1959), which helped secure him a job at the BBC.

===Documentaries===
Between 1959 and 1970, Russell directed arts documentaries for &quot;Monitor&quot; and &quot;Omnibus&quot;.

He made &quot;Poet&#x27;s London&quot; (1959, about John Betjeman), &quot;Portrait of a Goon&quot; (1959, about Spike Milligan), &quot;Gordon Jacob&quot; (1959), &quot;The Guitar Craze&quot; (1959), &quot;Variations on a Mechanical Theme&quot; (1959), &quot;Scottish Painters&quot; (1959), &quot;Marie Rambert Remembers&quot; (1960), &quot;The Strange World of Hieronymus Bosch&quot; (1960), &quot;The Miners&#x27; Picnic&quot; (1960), &quot;Architecture of Entertainment&quot; (1960), &quot;A House in Bayswater&quot; (1960), &quot;Shelagh Delaney&#x27;s Salford&quot; (1960), &quot;Cranks at Work&quot; (1960, about John Cranko), &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot; (1960), &quot;Journey Into a Lost World&quot; (1960), &quot;Lotte Lenya Sings Kurt Weill&quot; (1961), &quot;Old Battersea House&quot; (1961), &quot;Portrait of a Soviet Composer&quot; (1961), &quot;London Moods&quot; (1961), &quot;Antonio Gaudi&quot; (1961), &quot;Preservation Man&quot; (1962), &quot;Mr. Chesher&#x27;s Traction Engines&quot; (1962), &quot;The Lonely Shore&quot; (1962) and &quot;Watch the Birdie&quot; (1962).

Russell&#x27;s films began to get longer: &quot;Pop Goes the Easel&quot; (1962) and the much admired &quot;Elgar&quot; (1962) about Sir Edward Elgar. &quot;Elgar&quot; was the first time that a television arts programme (&quot;Monitor&quot;) was dedicated to one artistic figure, rather than having a magazine format. It was also the first time that re-enactments were used. Russell fought with the BBC over using actors to portray different ages of the same character, instead of the traditional photograph stills and documentary footage.

===Early features and rising fame===

Russell&#x27;s first feature film was &quot;French Dressing&quot; (1964), a comedy loosely based on Roger Vadim&#x27;s &quot;And God Created Woman&quot;; its critical and commercial failure led Russell to work further for the BBC. For television he made the 16-minute &quot;Lonely Shore&quot; (1964), the longer &quot;Bartok&quot; (1964) (about Béla Bartók), and &quot;The Dotty World of James Lloyd&quot; (1964). In 1964 he planned to make an adaptation of Anthony Burgess&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1962) starring the Rolling Stones, but abandoned the film after the British Board of Censors advised it would not approve it.

Russell had a noted critical success with the TV movie &quot;The Debussy Film&quot; (1965) starring Oliver Reed as Claude Debussy based on a script by Melvyn Bragg. Also well received was &quot;Always on Sunday&quot; (1965), written by Bragg, about Henri Rousseau.

Russell made &quot;Don&#x27;t Shoot the Composer&quot; (1966), a documentary about composer Georges Delerue. He produced and directed the highly praised &quot;Isadora Duncan, the Biggest Dancer in the World&quot; (1967), about Isadora Duncan with Vivian Pickles.

Russell&#x27;s television work prompted producer Harry Saltzman to hire him to direct a feature film, &quot;Billion Dollar Brain&quot; (1967), the third Harry Palmer movie starring Michael Caine. He wanted to follow it with a biopic of Vaslav Nijinsky but &quot;Brain&quot; was a commercial disappointment.

He returned to television for &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot; (1967) with Reed as Dante Gabriel Rossetti and &quot;Song of Summer&quot; (1968) about Frederick Delius and Eric Fenby. He once said that the best film he ever made was &quot;Song of Summer&quot;, and that he would not edit a single shot.

===&quot;Women in Love&quot;===
In 1969, Russell directed what is considered his &quot;signature film&quot;, &quot;Women In Love&quot;, an adaptation of D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s novel of the same name about two artist sisters living in post-World War I Britain. The film starred Glenda Jackson, Oliver Reed, Jennie Linden and Alan Bates. The film is notable for its nude wrestling scene, which broke the convention at the time that a mainstream movie could not show male genitalia. &quot;Women in Love&quot; connected with the sexual revolution and bohemian politics of the late 1960s. It received four Oscar nominations, including his only nomination for Best Director.

The film was BAFTA-nominated for the costume designs of Russell&#x27;s first wife, Shirley; they collaborated throughout the 1970s. The colour schemes of Luciana Arrighi&#x27;s art direction (also BAFTA-nominated) and Billy William&#x27;s cinematography, which Russell used for metaphorical effect, are also often referred to by film textbooks.

Russell returned to television with &quot;Dance of the Seven Veils&quot; (1970) which sought to portray Richard Strauss as a Nazi: one scene in particular showed a Jewish man being tortured while a group of SS men look on in delight, with Strauss&#x27;s music as the score. The Strauss family was so outraged by the film that they withdrew all music rights. The film was effectively banned from being screened until Strauss&#x27;s copyright expired in 2019. It was shown in February 2020 at the Keswick Film Festival.

===Three films in 1971===
He followed &quot;Women in Love&quot; with a string of innovative adult-themed films which were often as controversial as they were successful. &quot;The Music Lovers&quot; (1971), a biopic of Tchaikovsky, starred Richard Chamberlain as a flamboyant Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Glenda Jackson as his wife. The score was conducted by André Previn.

He followed it with &quot;The Devils&quot; (1971), a film so provocative that the production company, Warner Bros., refused to release it, unless cuts were made. Inspired by Aldous Huxley&#x27;s book &quot;The Devils of Loudun&quot; and using material from John Whiting&#x27;s play &quot;The Devils&quot;, it starred Oliver Reed as a priest who stands in the way of a corrupt church and state. Helped by publicity over the more sensational scenes, featuring sexuality among nuns, the film topped British box office receipts for eight weeks. In the United States, the film, which had already been cut for distribution in Britain, was further edited but never widely released theatrically in anything like its original state; the original, uncut version has only been shown in the U.S. at film festivals and art houses. In 2017, AMC Networks-owned horror film streaming service Shudder premiered the uncut version of the film for the first time on streaming.

British film critic Alexander Walker described the film as &quot;monstrously indecent&quot; in a television confrontation with Russell, leading the director to hit him with a rolled up copy of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, the newspaper for which Walker worked. The uncut version of the film remains censored.

Russell followed &quot;The Devils&quot; with a reworking of the period musical &quot;The Boy Friend&quot; (1971), for which he cast the model Twiggy, who won two Golden Globe Awards for her performance: one for Best Actress in a musical comedy, and one for the best newcomer. The film was heavily cut and shorn of two musical numbers for its American release; it was not a big success.

===The mid-1970s===
Russell wanted to make &quot;Little Sparrow&quot;, a film about Édith Piaf, or a biopic of King Ludwig of Bavaria, but neither was made. Instead, he himself provided most of the financing for &quot;Savage Messiah&quot; (1972). The film is a biopic of the painter and sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, who died fighting for France at age 23, in 1915, in the trenches of the Western Front during the First World War. The film stars Dorothy Tutin, Scott Antony, and Helen Mirren.

Russell announced a biopic of Sarah Bernhardt with Barbra Streisand but it was not made.

He worked with David Puttnam on &quot;Mahler&quot; (1974) starring Robert Powell as Gustav Mahler.

In 1975, Russell&#x27;s star-studded film version of the Who&#x27;s rock opera &quot;Tommy&quot; starring Roger Daltrey, Ann-Margret, Oliver Reed, Elton John, Tina Turner, Eric Clapton and Jack Nicholson, spent a record fourteen weeks at the No.1 spot.

Two months before &quot;Tommy&quot; was released (in March 1975), Russell started work on &quot;Lisztomania&quot; (1975), another vehicle for Roger Daltrey, and for the film scoring of progressive rock keyboardist Rick Wakeman. In the film, the music of Franz Liszt is stolen by Richard Wagner. Wagner&#x27;s operas then put forward the theme of the Superman. &quot;Tommy&quot; and &quot;Lisztomania&quot; were important in the rise of improved motion picture sound in the 1970s, as they were among the first films to be released with Dolby-encoded soundtracks. &quot;Lisztomania&quot;, tagged as &quot;the film that out-Tommys &#x27;Tommy&#x27;&quot;, topped the British box-office for two weeks in November 1975, when &quot;Tommy&quot; was still in the list of the week&#x27;s top five box-office hits.

Russell&#x27;s next film, the biopic &quot;Valentino&quot; (1977), starring Rudolf Nureyev as Rudolph Valentino, also topped the British box-office for two weeks, but was not a hit in America. After this he said &quot;nobody in Hollywood would give me even a B movie to direct.&quot;

===Return to television and &quot;Altered States&quot;===
Russell returned to television with &quot;William and Dorothy&quot; (1978) a look at the life of William Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy, and &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; (1978), about Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

Russell went to Hollywood to make &quot;Altered States&quot; (1980), a departure in both genre and tone, in that it is Russell&#x27;s only foray into science fiction. Working from Paddy Chayefsky&#x27;s screenplay (based upon his novel), Russell used his penchant for elaborate visual effects to translate Chayefsky&#x27;s hallucinatory story to the cinema, and took the opportunity to add his trademark religious and sexual imagery. The film had an innovative Oscar-nominated score by John Corigliano. The film enjoyed moderate financial success, and scored with critics who had otherwise dismissed Russell&#x27;s work. Roger Ebert, who had given &quot;The Devils&quot; &quot;zero stars&quot;, and had panned Russell&#x27;s early composer portraits (he did, however, give three stars to both &quot;Tommy&quot; and &quot;Lisztomania&quot;), gave it his highest rating for Russell&#x27;s work (three-and-a-half stars), praising it as &quot;one hell of a movie!&quot;

Although the film was a financial success, Russell had difficulty making his next film. One project, &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Secret&quot;, was about to start shooting when financing fell apart at the last minute. He was attached to do the film of &quot;Evita&quot; for over a year, but ultimately left the project when he refused to cast Elaine Paige in the lead. A biopic of Maria Callas with Sophia Loren also failed to get financing. However, Russell found himself artistically rejuvenated when offered the chance to direct some opera. He did &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;, &quot;Soldiers&quot; and &quot;Butterfly&quot;.

Russell&#x27;s next film after &quot;Altered States&quot; was &quot;The Planets&quot; (1983), about Gustav Holst&#x27;s orchestral suite of the same name. This 53-minute film was made specially for &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;, the weekly arts programme on the ITV network in Britain. It is a wordless collage that matches stock footage to each of the seven movements of the Holst suite. John Coulthart wrote &quot;familiar Russell obsessions appear: Nazis, naked women and the inevitable crucifixion.&quot; After essentially disappearing for decades, in 2016 the film was re-released on DVD by Arthaus Musik.

For &quot;The South Bank Show, Russell&quot; also made &quot;Vaughan Williams: A Symphonic Portrait&quot; (1984) about Ralph Vaughan Williams.

Russell returned to feature films with a sexual thriller, &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot; (1984), starring Anthony Perkins and Kathleen Turner for New World Pictures. It had moderate critical success and did not perform well at the box office, but was a big hit on video.

===Opera and music videos===
In the eighties, Russell directed a number of operatic productions. In 1985, he directed Gounod&#x27;s opera Faust, loosely based on Goethe&#x27;s play Faust. The production was staged at the Vienna State Opera, conducted by Erich Binder with Francisco Araiza, Ruggero Raimondi and Gabriela Beňačková in the main roles. In 1986, he directed a production of Arrigo Boito&#x27;s Mefistofele, also based on Goethe&#x27;s Faust: the production was staged at Teatro Margherita in Genoa, conducted by Edoardo Müller, with Ottavio Garaventa, Paata Burchuladze and Adriana Morelli in the main roles. He also directed successful productions of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot; and &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;. 

Russell set up a company, Sitting Duck, to make music videos. &quot;Videos are a magic new art form,&quot; he said. Among those he made were &quot;Nikita&quot; for Elton John and &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; for Andrew Lloyd Webber.

Russell had a legal fight with Bob Guccione over an aborted attempt to film &quot;Moll Flanders&quot;, which was dramatised in a movie, &quot;Your Honour, I Object!&quot; (1987).

===Vestron Pictures===
Russell directed &quot;Gothic&quot; (1986) with Gabriel Byrne, about the night Mary Shelley told the tale of Frankenstein. It was a hit on video for Vestron Pictures, who signed Russell to a three-picture contract.

Russell did one of the segments for &quot;Aria&quot; (1987), and for British TV made &quot;Ken Russell&#x27;s ABC of British Music&quot; (1988) and &quot;A British Picture&quot; (1989).

For the Vestron deal, he directed &quot;Salome&#x27;s Last Dance&quot; (1988), a loosely adapted esoteric tribute to Oscar Wilde&#x27;s controversial play &quot;Salome&quot;, which was banned on the 19th century London stage. The cult movie defines Russell&#x27;s adult themed romance with the &quot;Theatre of The Poor&quot; and was also notable for the screen presence of Imogen Millais-Scott as Salome.

He made another two pictures for Vestron: &quot;The Lair of the White Worm&quot; (1988) with Amanda Donohoe and Hugh Grant, based on a novella by Bram Stoker, and &quot;The Rainbow&quot; (1989), another D. H. Lawrence adaptation, which also happens to be the prequel to &quot;Women in Love&quot;. Glenda Jackson played the mother of her character in the previous film.

Russell directed the opera &quot;Mefistofele&quot; (1989).

===Later work===
In the 1990 film &quot;The Russia House&quot;, starring Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer, Russell made one of his first significant acting appearances, portraying Walter, an ambiguously gay British MI6 intelligence officer who discomfits his more strait-laced CIA counterparts. Russell thenceforth occasionally acted.

He directed a segment of &quot;Women and Men: Stories of Seduction&quot; (1990) and for TV did &quot;The Strange Affliction of Anton Bruckner&quot; (1991).

In 1991, Russell directed &quot;Whore&quot;. It was highly controversial and branded with an NC-17 rating for its sexual content. The MPAA and the theatre chains also refused to release posters or advertise a film called &quot;Whore&quot;, so for this purpose the film was re-titled &quot;If You Can&#x27;t Say It, Just See It&quot;. Russell protested his film being given such a rating when &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; got an R, on the grounds that his film showed the real hardships of being a prostitute, and the other glorified it.

The film &quot;Prisoner of Honor&quot; (1991) allowed Russell a further opportunity to explore his abiding interest in anti-Semitism through a factually-based account of the Dreyfus affair in the French Third Republic. The movie featured Richard Dreyfuss in the central role of Colonel Georges Picquart, the French Army investigator who exposed the army establishment&#x27;s framing of the Jewish officer Captain Alfred Dreyfus.

By the early 1990s, Russell had become a celebrity: his notoriety and persona attracted more attention than his recent work. He became largely reliant on his own finances to continue making films. Much of his work after 1990 was commissioned for television (e.g. his 1993 TV film &quot;The Mystery of Dr Martinu&quot;), and he contributed regularly to &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; including documentaries such as &quot;Classic Widows&quot; about the widows of four leading British composers; dance sections in these were choreographed by Amir Hosseinpour.

&quot;Prisoner of Honor&quot; (1991) was Russell&#x27;s final work with Oliver Reed. His final film with Glenda Jackson before she gave up acting for politics was &quot;The Secret Life of Arnold Bax&quot; (1992).

He directed &quot;Lady Chatterley&quot; (1993), &quot;The Mystery of Dr Martinu&quot; (1993), a version of &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1995), &quot;Alice in Russialand&quot; (1995), &quot;Mindbender&quot; (1995) (about Uri Geller), and an episode of &quot;Tales of Erotica&quot;.

In May 1995, he was honoured with a retrospective of his work presented in Hollywood by the American Cinematheque. Titled &quot;Shock Value&quot;, it included some of Russell&#x27;s most successful and controversial films and also several of his early BBC productions. Russell attended the festival and engaged in lengthy post-screening discussions of each film with audiences and moderator Martin Lewis, who had instigated and curated the retrospective.

Later films include &quot;Dogboys&quot; (1998), &quot;The Fall of the Louse of Usher&quot; (2002), and &quot;&quot; (2002).

Russell had a cameo in the 2006 film adaptation of Brian Aldiss&#x27;s novel &quot;Brothers of the Head&quot; by the directors of &quot;Lost in La Mancha&quot;. He also had a cameo in the 2006 film &quot;Colour Me Kubrick&quot;. He directed a segment for the horror anthology &quot;Trapped Ashes&quot; (2007), which also included segments directed by Sean S. Cunningham, Monte Hellman, and Joe Dante. Prior to his death in 2011 he was reputed to be in pre-production for two films: &quot;The Pearl of the Orient&quot; and &quot;Kings X&quot;.
Efforts such as &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Mouth&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Fall of the Louse of Usher&quot; (2002) have suffered from low production values (for example, being shot on video on Russell&#x27;s estate, often featuring Russell himself) and limited distribution.

In 2003 he was a member of the jury at the 25th Moscow International Film Festival. He also acted in &quot;Final Cut&quot;, an episode of the BBC Television series &quot;Waking the Dead&quot;, playing the role of an aging director of a notorious 1960s crime drama similar to &quot;Performance&quot;.

From 2004, Russell was visiting professor at the University of Wales, Newport Film School. One of his many tasks was to advise students on the making of their graduate films. He also presented the Finest Film Awards (for graduate filmmakers of Newport) in June 2005.

Russell was appointed visiting fellow at Southampton Solent University and later at the University of Southampton in April 2007, where he acted in a similar capacity to his role at the Newport Film School, until March 2008. His arrival was celebrated with a screening of the rare director&#x27;s cut of &quot;The Devils&quot; hosted by Mark Kermode.

He began production of his first full-length film in almost five years, &quot;Moll Flanders&quot;, an adaptation of Daniel Defoe&#x27;s novel, starring Lucinda Rhodes-Flaherty and Barry Humphries, but a finished film failed to materialise.

In 2007, Russell produced &quot;A Kitten for Hitler&quot;, a short film hosted by the Comedybox.tv website. Russell commented that &quot;Ten years ago, while working on &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;, Melvyn Bragg and I had a heated discussion on the pros and cons of film censorship. Broadly speaking, Melvyn was against it, while I, much to his surprise, was absolutely for it. He then dared me to write a script that I thought should be banned. I accepted the challenge and a month or so later sent him a short subject entitled &quot;A Kitten for Hitler&quot;. &#x27;Ken,&#x27; he said, &#x27;if ever you make this film and it is shown, you will be lynched.&#x27; &quot;

Russell joined the cast of the British reality television show &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; in January 2007, at the start of the series, but left voluntarily within a week after an altercation with fellow housemate Jade Goody. At the age of 79, he was then the oldest person to be a contestant on the programme.

Russell and his wife Elize &quot;Lisi&quot; Tribble were invited by New York film writer Shade Rupe on a six-week journey across North America, beginning with a Lifetime Achievement Award given by Mitch Davis at the Fantasia film festival on 20 July 2010, followed by a screening of Russell&#x27;s most notorious film, &quot;The Devils&quot;. The next day, a near complete 35mm print retrospective of Russell&#x27;s work at the Cinémathèque québécoise including &quot;Billion Dollar Brain&quot;, &quot;Women in Love&quot;, &quot;The Music Lovers&quot;, &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot;, &quot;The Rainbow&quot;, &quot;Whore&quot;, and many more found projection along with an exhibition of several of Russell&#x27;s photographs from the 1950s. The next stop was Russellmania! at the Lincoln Center, a nine-film overview of Russell&#x27;s work from &quot;Women in Love&quot; through &quot;Valentino&quot;, with Russell present at each evening screening for a nearly sold-out weeklong festival. On 30 July 2010, for the opening night, Russell was joined by Vanessa Redgrave for a 40th anniversary screening of &quot;The Devils&quot; and the next evening saw &quot;The Music Lovers&quot; and &quot;Women in Love&quot; projected with Russell in attendance. Tommy Tune joined Russell the next evening for &quot;The Boy Friend&quot; and followed the screening with a live stage dance number from the film.

The American Cinematheque in Los Angeles next hosted Russell at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica with screenings of &quot;The Devils&quot; and &quot;Altered States&quot; with Charles Haid and Stuart Baird in attendance, and &quot;Tommy&quot; and &quot;Lisztomania&quot; at the Egyptian the following evening. Director Mick Garris extended an invitation and Russell, Tribble, and Rupe joined the Masters of Horror for one of their rarified dinners. The tour wrapped up in Toronto at the Rue Morgue Festival of Fear and a packed screening of &quot;The Devils&quot; at the Bloor Cinema hosted by Richard Crouse.

In 2008, he made his New York directorial debut with the Off-Broadway production of &quot;Mindgame&quot; at the SoHo Playhouse produced by Monica Tidwell, a thriller by Anthony Horowitz and starring Keith Carradine, Lee Godart and Kathleen McNenny.

Towards the end of his life, Russell was planning a remake of the 1976 erotic musical comedy &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;.

==Personal life==
Russell converted to Roman Catholicism during the 1950s; he described &quot;The Devils&quot; as being the &quot;last nail in the coffin of my Catholic faith.&quot;

He was married four times. His first marriage, to costume designer Shirley Kingdon from 1956 to 1978, produced four sons and a daughter. He was married to Vivian Jolly from 1984 to 1991 (the wedding celebrant being Anthony Perkins, who had been ordained in the Universal Life Church); the couple had a son and daughter. He was married to the actress and former ballerina Hetty Baynes from 1992 to 1997; the couple had a son. His first three marriages ended in divorce. He married American actress and artist Elize &quot;Lisi&quot; Tribble in 2001, and the marriage lasted until his death.

==Death==
Ken Russell died on 27 November 2011 at the age of 84, having suffered a series of strokes; he was survived by his wife and eight children. Before his death, he left his entire estate to his wife.

==Writings==

Besides books on film-making and the British film industry, Russell also wrote &quot;A British Picture: An Autobiography&quot; (1989; published in the US as &quot;Altered States: The Autobiography of Ken Russell&quot;, 1991). He also published six novels, including four on the sex lives of composers – &quot;Beethoven Confidential&quot;, &quot;Brahms Gets Laid&quot;, &quot;Elgar: The Erotic Variations&quot;, and &quot;Delius: A Moment with Venus&quot;.

&quot;Mike and Gaby&#x27;s Space Gospel&quot; is a science-fiction rewriting of &quot;Genesis&quot;. His last novel, also science fiction and published in 2006, is called &quot;Violation&quot;. It is a very violent future-shock tale of an England where football has become the national religion.

At the time of his death, he had a column for &quot;The Times&quot; in the Film section of &quot;times 2&quot;.

==Selected filmography==
==Photography==
Before achieving success in the film industry, Russell was a stills photographer for a period. An exhibition displaying some of Russell&#x27;s work was on display during the summer of 2007 in central London&#x27;s Proud Galleries in The Strand, London. The exhibition, entitled &quot;Ken Russell&#x27;s Lost London Rediscovered: 1951–1957&quot;, included photos taken in and around London, with many of the pictures being taken in the Portobello Road area of London. An exhibition &quot;Ken Russell: Filmmaker, Photographer&quot; ran at several galleries in 2010.

==Music video==
In the late-1980s, Russell directed the music video for &quot;It&#x27;s All Coming Back to Me Now&quot;, a song written and produced by Jim Steinman for his Pandora&#x27;s Box project. The production featured a range of erotic imagery, including studded bras and spiked codpieces. He had also directed Elton John&#x27;s video for &quot;Nikita&quot; which featured a scene of John wearing the same boots he wore as the Pinball Wizard in the film adaptation of the Who&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot;.

==Cultural references==

Light-hearted references to Russell often allude to sexual and religious (frequently Catholic) images in his work.

In his 1973 novel &quot;The Honorary Consul&quot;, English novelist Graham Greene includes a passage in which a &quot;Conservative Member of Parliament had described the British entry [in the Mar del Plata Film Festival in Argentina] by some man named Russell as pornographic.&quot;

<text>Fleet Admiral Gial Ackbar is a fictional character from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. A member of the amphibious Mon Calamari species, Ackbar was the foremost military commander of the Rebel Alliance, and he led the attack against the second Death Star in &quot;Star Wars: Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), the final entry in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. Although his time in the film was brief, Ackbar became a prominent character in other &quot;Star Wars&quot; media, including novels, comic books, video games, and television shows, and later made appearances in the sequel trilogy films &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; (2015) and &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot; (2017), and the television series &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;.

With his distinctive salmon-colored skin, webbed hands, high-domed head, and large fish-like eyes, Ackbar was realized in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; through the use of either a half-body puppet or full-body costume, depending on the camera angle required. In all three films he was portrayed by puppeteer Timothy D. Rose, who originally played other characters, but requested to also play Ackbar after seeing his sculpt on a display stand. Ackbar was voiced by Erik Bauersfeld, who made up the voice on the spot after looking at a photograph of Ackbar. Bauersfeld voiced the character in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; and &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, but died before the filming of &quot;The Last Jedi&quot;, in which he was replaced by Tom Kane, who had voiced Ackbar in other works of &quot;Star Wars&quot; media.

Ackbar was originally planned to be more conventionally humanoid, but after &quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas decided to make him an alien, he allowed &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; director Richard Marquand to pick from various designs. Marquand picked a sketch by concept artist Nilo Rodis-Jamero, over the objections of other members of the film crew who thought the character looked too silly or ugly. Ackbar made his first appearance not in the film, but in a &quot;Star Wars&quot; newspaper comic strip that ran a few months before &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; was released. Lucas was not entirely pleased with the final result of the character in the film and felt it was a compromise. Ackbar&#x27;s first name, Gial, was not established until April 2012.

Ackbar had just 14 lines of dialogue in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, and his total screen time across all three film appearances totaled only three minutes and 30 seconds. Nevertheless, he is considered a fan favorite among &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters, and was ranked No. 16 in a 1998 list of the &quot;Top 20 &quot;Star Wars&quot; Characters&quot; in the magazine &quot;Star Wars Insider&quot;. His line &quot;It&#x27;s a trap!&quot; from &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; became one of the most famous, quoted and beloved lines from the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy, as well as a popular Internet meme.

==Character biography==
===Backstory===
Admiral Ackbar was best known for his appearance in the film &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, the final entry in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. However, before the May 1983 debut of that film, the character made his first chronological appearance in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; newspaper comic strip by Archie Goodwin and Al Williamson. Published by the &quot;Los Angeles Times Syndicate&quot;, the strip ran in newspapers across the United States from November 1982 to January 1983. In the comic, Ackbar was portrayed as the leader of the Mon Calamari, an alien species of fish-like, amphibious humanoids with salmon-colored skin, webbed hands, high-domed heads, and large fish-like eyes, and who can breathe both on land and underwater. They are allies of the Rebel Alliance in their conflict with the Galactic Empire. In the comic, which is set before the events of the film &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), Ackbar and his crew are stranded on the planet Daluuj after an Imperial attack, and they are rescued by Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Princess Leia Organa in the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;. Ackbar demonstrates his tactical abilities by agitating water monsters in a ploy to raise the sunken &quot;Falcon&quot; from a mud swamp.

Ackbar&#x27;s backstory was not explained in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, but has been established in &quot;Star Wars&quot; books and other media since the film was released. He is from the planet Mon Cala, a world almost entirely covered by water, where his species built giant floating cities. Ackbar is the leader of his home town, Coral Depths City, when forces from the Galactic Empire invade and nearly destroy the planet. Despite the Mon Calamari&#x27;s attempts to make peace, the Imperial forces destroy several of their cities, steal their technology, and enslave its population. Ackbar is one of the first to be enslaved, and becomes an interpreter and personal servant to Grand Moff Tarkin, a secondary antagonist from the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film. During this time, Ackbar learns much about both the Empire and military tactics in general, as well as about the Rebel Alliance and the Death Star, a moon-sized superweapon Tarkin is developing at the time. Ackbar takes detailed notes about what he observed with the hopes of eventually escaping back to his people and using the information against the Empire.

Ackbar is freed from captivity during a failed attempt by Rebel forces to capture Tarkin. He joins the Rebel Alliance, where the knowledge he obtained during his captivity made him indispensable. Ackbar returns to the Mon Calamari people and, after leading them through numerous conflicts, convinces them to formally support the Rebel cause, bringing with them the massive Mon Calamari cruisers that drastically improves the strength of the Rebel fleet. Starting with the rank of Commander, Ackbar helps design the B-wing, a powerful line of starfighters. This success prompts Rebel leader Mon Mothma to promote him to Admiral, news he reacts to heavily due to the weight of the responsibility. Following events in the film &quot;Star Wars&quot;, including the destruction of the Death Star, Ackbar helps the other Rebel leaders establish new bases of operation and manage a Rebel mobile task force in starships spread across the galaxy. He rises up the ranks until Mothma promotes him to commander of the entire Rebel fleet and head of military operations, as well as one of her top advisers.

===&quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;===

Admiral Ackbar was the first character not resemblant of a human shown in a leadership position in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films. In &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, when Rebel spies discover plans for a partially constructed second Death Star, Ackbar and Mon Mothma plan a surprise assault on the battle station as it orbits the forest moon of Endor. The attack, known as the Battle of Endor, involves General Han Solo leading a strike team on the moon&#x27;s surface to destroy the Death Star&#x27;s energy shield generator, while Ackbar and General Lando Calrissian lead a battle against the station itself. Ackbar personally leads the assault from his flagship, the Mon Calamari cruiser &quot;Home One&quot;. The attack does not go as planned, however, because Emperor Palpatine was expecting the assault and had in fact allowed the Death Star plans to fall into Rebel hands. On Palpatine&#x27;s order, Imperial forces launch a massive counterattack against the Rebel fleet with TIE starfighters and Star Destroyer capital ships, which leads Ackbar to realize that the fleet is heading into a trap. He initially calls for a tactical retreat, but Calrissian convinces him to move forward with the attack and give Solo&#x27;s team more time to destroy the energy shield. The Rebel forces suffer heavy casualties, but ultimately succeed in destroying the second Death Star and defeating the Empire.

===&quot;The Clone Wars&quot;===

Ackbar appeared in the first three episodes of the fourth season of the animated series &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;, which is set roughly 20 years before the events of the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film. In the show, Ackbar is a chief adviser of the Mon Cala king, Yos Kolina, and captain of the Mon Calamari royal guard, where he hones the abilities that later serve him as an Admiral. The fragile peace between Mon Cala&#x27;s two primary species, the Calamari and the Quarren, is disrupted after King Kolina is assassinated by Riff Tamson, an agent for the Confederacy of Independent Systems, also known as the Separatists, one of the primary antagonists of the series. Attempting to spark a civil war on the planet, the Separatists use Quarren insurgents to obstruct Mon Cala Prince Lee-Char&#x27;s succession to the throne, and Ackbar attempts to protect Lee-Char and rally the Mon Calamari people as a battle for the planet begins. The battle is lost, despite the assistance of the Jedi Ahsoka Tano, Anakin Skywalker, and Kit Fisto. Ackbar is captured, leaving Ahsoka and Lee-Char to fend for themselves. However, after learning that Tamson plans to install himself as the new king, the Quarren betrays the Separatists at Lee-Char&#x27;s public execution ceremony. Afterwards, Ackbar is freed and helps lead a counterassault to retake the planet. Tamson is killed by Lee-Char, who is crowned the new king.

Dave Filoni, supervising director on &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;, said he had planned on featuring Ackbar in the series since the second season due to the character&#x27;s relevance to the original trilogy, and because he was old enough in those films to have been alive when &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; was set. Keith Kellogg, animation supervisor for the series, said of the character: &quot;To see him as his younger self commanding an army in the field was really fun, and to be able to see him mentor Lee-Char was great.&quot;

===Sequel trilogy===
Admiral Ackbar appeared in the first two films of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; sequel trilogy, which were distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures after The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm in 2012. His character is retired from military service before the events of the films, but Leia Organa convinces him to come out of retirement to fight against the First Order, a military dictatorship that was formed from the remnants of the original Empire. He regains his prior rank of Admiral and serves as one of the leaders of the Resistance, a paramilitary organization led by Leia, who is now a General. Ackbar is in command of the Resistance fleet, with the Mon Calamari cruiser &quot;Raddus&quot; as his flagship. Ackbar is widely respected by the Resistance personnel as one of the few living commanders to have faced the Empire during the height of its power. In the first film, &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; (2015), Ackbar appears at the headquarters of the Resistance, and helps develop the plan to destroy the First Order&#x27;s new superweapon, Starkiller Base. He later monitors the successful attack against the weapon alongside Leia from the Resistance base on the planet D&#x27;Qar.

Members of the cast and crew were particularly excited to film a scene with Ackbar. Ben Rosenblatt, a co-producer with &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, said having Ackbar on the set was &quot;the moment that meant the most to me, personally&quot;, adding: &quot;Security has been so tight, we&#x27;re not allowed to take pictures or anything, but I had to take a picture of Ackbar on set and show it to my brothers because we loved Ackbar.&quot; Actor John Boyega, who portrayed Finn, said of performing with Ackbar: &quot;as a &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan, it doesn&#x27;t get any cooler than that.&quot; Gary Whitta, a writer who has worked on several &quot;Star Wars&quot; projects, said: &quot;When I went to the set of &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, the first thing I had to do was put on the Admiral Ackbar mask, and I did. It was a big deal, and I&#x27;ve always loved that character.&quot;

In the trilogy&#x27;s second film, &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot; (2017), Ackbar leads the Resistance as they evacuate their base on D&#x27;Qar, and orders the ships to jump to hyperspace to escape the First Order. The First Order fleet pursues the Resistance, sending Kylo Ren and other TIE fighters after the MC85 Star Cruiser &quot;Raddus&quot;, on which Ackbar and other senior Resistance leaders are aboard. First Order TIEs open fire on the main bridge of the &quot;Raddus&quot;, causing a massive explosion and blowing all occupants into the vacuum of space. Ackbar is killed, along with everyone else on the bridge except for Leia, who is saved by her use of the Force. Although Ackbar had no lines of dialogue during his death scene in the film, the comic book adaptation of &quot;The Last Jedi&quot; revealed that his last words were: &quot;Torpedoes inbound. It&#x27;s been an honor serving with you all.&quot; Whitta, who wrote the comic book adaptation, said he was saddened Ackbar died so quickly in the film, so he wanted to give him &quot;a little bit of a moment before he dies&quot;.

Ackbar&#x27;s total screen time across all three of his &quot;Star Wars&quot; film appearances totaled only three minutes and 30 seconds. He was originally planned to appear in &quot;Rogue One&quot; (2016), a standalone anthology film separate from the sequel trilogy. During the initial screenwriting process, he appeared leading a space fleet during the climactic space battle at the end of the film. However, he was removed in later script revisions and his part replaced by Admiral Raddus, who, in an homage to Ackbar, was also a member of the Mon Calamari species. Whitta, who co-wrote the story of the film, said he wanted Ackbar included, but since he was already featured in &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, the team behind &quot;Rogue One&quot; decided the character should not appear in two films released so closely together.

===&quot;Ahsoka&quot;===
Ackbar makes a non-speaking appearance at Hera Syndulla&#x27;s disciplinary hearing on Corusant.

===Other &quot;Star Wars&quot; media===
Although his role in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films was relatively brief, Admiral Ackbar became a prominent character in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe, which encompasses all licensed stories in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe outside of the nine main feature films, such as novels, comic books, video games, and television shows. With the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot; were rebranded as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014. As a result, Ackbar has two separate storylines and character histories outside of the feature films: one in the Legends canon encompassing all &quot;Star Wars&quot; media before April 2014, and one in the official Disney canon for all media after April 2014.

====&quot;Legends&quot; continuity====
Ackbar was a central character in &quot;Strike Force: Shantipole&quot;, an adventure book for use with the &quot;Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game&quot; released in June 1988 by West End Games. Set before the chronological events of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, the book portrayed Ackbar&#x27;s secret development of the B-wing starfighters and his efforts to recruit the Verpine, the alien species building the ships, into the Rebel Alliance. In the storyline, the B-wings are designed in a research facility on an asteroid named Shantipole, and the project is nearly compromised by an Imperial spy, forcing Ackbar and other characters to repel an Imperial attack and escape. Ackbar appears in &quot;Dark Empire&quot;, a six-issue comic book series that detailed the resurrection of Emperor Palpatine, as well as Luke Skywalker&#x27;s brief conversion to the dark side of the Force. In the comics, Ackbar and Mon Mothma attempts to lead the Rebel Alliance through the crisis, and Ackbar later organizes a response when his home world is attacked by the Empire&#x27;s new superweapons, the World Devastators.

In the &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels written between 1991 and 1998, following the events of the &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, Ackbar maintains a key position in the command hierarchy of the Rebel Alliance, as well as that of the New Republic, the government established to replace the Empire. He was a signatory on the formal declaration of the New Republic and one of nine individuals to join the New Republic Provisional Council, the initial governing body of this new form of government. Ackbar is part of the many mop-up operations that targets the Empire&#x27;s dwindling territories, including the defeat of Grand Admiral Peccati Syn during the liberation of the Wookiee planet Kashyyyk, and the defeat of Imperial warlord Zsinj. Before his death, Zsinj brainwashes several aliens and forces them to make assassination attempts against several high-profile Rebel leaders, including Ackbar.

Ackbar appeared in the &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot; trilogy of books written by Timothy Zahn and published from 1991 to 1993, which were widely credited with rejuvenating interest in &quot;Star Wars&quot; at the time. In those books, which are set five years after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, Ackbar is instrumental in working with Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia Organa, and Mon Mothma in reestablishing the New Republic and defeating Grand Admiral Thrawn, the new leader of the remaining forces of the Empire. In the second novel of the series, &quot;Dark Force Rising&quot;, Thrawn attempts to frame Ackbar for treason by placing stolen money into his personal accounts. Borsk Fey&#x27;lya, a political rival of Ackbar, exploits this and has him arrested and placed on trial, but Han Solo and Lando Calrissian obtain evidence that proves his innocence, and he is restored to his military position. Ackbar plans a raid against Thrawn on the planet Bilbringi, seeking to severely damage the Grand Admiral&#x27;s shipbuilding capability and steal Imperial technology. Thrawn learns of the raid and sets a trap for Ackbar and his forces, but the New Republic ultimately win the battle after Thrawn is assassinated by his own bodyguard.

Ackbar played a prominent supporting role in the &quot;Star Wars: X-wing&quot; series of novels, which detailed Ackbar leading the successful campaign to recapture the capital planet of Coruscant, among other events. This series also portrays the death of Ackbar&#x27;s niece, Jesmin Ackbar, a Rogue Squadron starfighter pilot who is killed in action. Ackbar played a supporting role in the &quot;Jedi Academy&quot; Trilogy, a set of novels by Kevin J. Anderson released in 1994 and set two years after the &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot; trilogy. In those novels, Ackbar&#x27;s personal starfighter crashes on the planet of Vortex in an incident that kills numerous innocent aliens and nearly kills Ackbar himself. In disgrace, he resigns from his post and retires to his home planet. It is later revealed that the crash was the result of Imperial sabotage, and Leia tries to persuade Ackbar to return to military service. During that time, Mon Calamari is attacked by Imperial Admiral Natasi Daala, one of the primary antagonists of the &quot;Jedi Academy&quot; trilogy. Ackbar leads the successful defense of his planet and defeats Daala, and later returns to his military post.

Ackbar retires from military service before the beginning of &quot;The New Jedi Order&quot; series of &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels, which were first published in 1999 and were set about 25 years after the original trilogy. However, even as his body begins to fail him due to his advanced age, he comes out of retirement when the Yuuzhan Vong attempt to conquer the galaxy in a bloody war that nearly destroys the New Republic. He appeared in the book &quot;Destiny&#x27;s Way&quot; (2002), and upon his return to military service, the message &quot;Ackbar is back!&quot; is transmitted to the entire Defense Force, inspired by a similar real-life transmission &quot;Winston is back!&quot; reportedly issued to the British fleet about Winston Churchill during World War II. In the book, Ackbar serves in a command post in the newly formed Galactic Alliance government, where he formulates strategies that result in a major victory against the Yuuzhan Vong, the Battle of Ebaq, ultimately helping turn the tide of the war. It is revealed in &quot;The Unifying Force&quot; (2003), the final novel of the &quot;New Jedi Order&quot; series, that Ackbar dies of old age shortly before the end of the war, after which he receives a grand memorial service. His death, which occurs 29 years after the events of the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, does not occur within the prose of the novel; rather, the characters are notified that his death occurred. A Galactic Alliance Star Destroyer is named in his honor; the &quot;Admiral Ackbar&quot; first appears in the novel &quot;The Unseen Queen&quot; (2005), set several years after the character&#x27;s death.

Ackbar has appeared in several &quot;Star Wars&quot; video games, starting with the 1993 LucasArts space simulation computer game &quot;Star Wars: X-Wing&quot;, in which he provided military briefings for the pilot character controlled by the player. Ackbar made an appearance in &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot;, an MMORPG developed by Sony Online Entertainment and first released in 2003. The game is set shortly after the events of the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, and Ackbar has a rank of Captain. Ackbar also appeared in the 2007 video game &quot;Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron&quot;, in which he was kidnapped by the bounty hunter Boba Fett and handed over to the Empire, who imprisoned him aboard an Imperial cruiser. In the game, the player is a member of Renegade Squadron, a military unit formed by Han Solo composed of pirates and smugglers, and the rescue of Ackbar is one of the game&#x27;s playable missions. Ackbar can be played as a hidden character in the Nintendo Wii version of the 2008 video game &quot;Star Wars: The Force Unleashed&quot; if the player entered the cheat code &quot;ITSATWAP&quot;.

====Official canon====
Admiral Ackbar appeared in &quot;Star Wars: Aftermath&quot;, a 2015 canon novel by Chuck Wendig set immediately after the events of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. During one passage, Ackbar made an impassioned speech, warning his fellow officials in the newly formed New Republic that while the Empire suffered a heavy loss with the death of Emperor Palpatine and the destruction of the Death Star II, the Empire was still a threat and the war was not yet over. In the novel, Ackbar participated in the New Republic&#x27;s efforts to seek out the remnants of the Empire hiding in the Outer Rim region of the galaxy, and he communicated with his colleague Wedge Antilles before Antilles&#x27; disappearance on the planet Akiva, where much of the book&#x27;s story was set.

Ackbar appeared in &quot;Aftermath&quot; two sequel books, &quot;Life Debt&quot; (2016) and &quot;Empire&#x27;s End&quot; (2017), also written by Wendig. In &quot;Life Debt&quot;, Ackbar led the successful assault against Kuat Drive Yards, a major starship manufacturer that had previously been supplying the Empire. In &quot;Empire&#x27;s End&quot;, Ackbar commanded the New Republic fleet during the Battle of Jakku, a decisive victory that resulted in the destruction of the Empire and the end of the Galactic Civil War. In an interview with &quot;USA Today&quot;, Wendig said Ackbar was his favorite established &quot;Star Wars&quot; character to write for in the novel: &quot;One of the great things about the universe is that we have all of these characters who get a small amount of screen time but who impact us in huge ways. .. Ackbar for me was always this amazing, grizzled war veteran, and getting to inhabit him and his voice for the new book made me pretty giddy.&quot;

Ackbar has a minor part in the novel &quot;Star Wars: Bloodline&quot; (2016) by Claudia Gray, which focused largely on Leia Organa prior to the events of &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;. The novel included the public disclosure that Organa is the daughter of Darth Vader, which nearly destroyed her reputation and led many to condemn her. Ackbar, however, sent her messages of support after the public revelation, an indication of his respect for her. In a storyline that crossed over between the comic book &quot;Star Wars: C-3PO&quot; and the Disney XD television series &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Resistance Rises&quot; (both released in 2016), it was established that Ackbar was captured by the First Order some time after his recruitment into the Resistance. In the story, the droid C-3PO obtained information that Ackbar had been imprisoned aboard an Imperial battlecruiser, and the droid worked with fellow Resistance operatives BB-8 and Poe Dameron to infiltrate the ship and rescue him from Captain Phasma.

Ackbar played a supporting role in the &quot;Burning Seas&quot; story arc from the comic book series &quot;Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith&quot;, which was released in 2018 but was set about one year after the events of &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, the final movie in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy. In the story arc, entitled &quot;Burning Seas&quot;, Ackbar was a commander and Chief of Security for Mon Cala King Lee-Char, and Darth Vader and his forces visited the planet to strengthen the Empire&#x27;s influence there. Ackbar set a trap for the Empire by luring their aerial landing platforms closer to the planet, then firing special undetectable missiles at them once they were in range. The victory proved temporary, however, as Grand Moff Tarkin escalated hostilities as a result and ultimate overtook the planet, resulting in King Lee-Char&#x27;s capture and eventual death.

Ackbar appeared briefly in the 2017 &quot;Star Wars Battlefront II&quot; video game developed by EA DICE. During the prologue of the story mode, in which Imperial agent and the game&#x27;s protagonist Iden Versio has infiltrated a Mon Calamari cruiser, a hologram of Ackbar discussing the Rebel Alliance&#x27;s plans to attack the second Death Star is briefly visible.

A Mon Calamari named Aftab Ackbar, Admiral Ackbar&#x27;s son, was created to appear as a minor character in &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019), the final film in the sequel trilogy. He was created as a result of early script conversations between &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot; co-writers J. J. Abrams and Chris Terrio, who provided the voice for the character. Terrio was a fan of Admiral Ackbar and said he &quot;went into mourning a bit&quot; when the character was killed. Prior to the film&#x27;s debut, Aftab first appeared in comic book miniseries &quot;Star Wars: Allegiance&quot; released in October 2019. The miniseries is set after the events of &quot;The Last Jedi&quot;, and features Leia Organa and her allies visit Mon Cala to seek allies and resources for the Resistance. Aftab assists her, and it is revealed that Admiral Ackbar was seldom present for Aftab&#x27;s childhood due to his military career, but Aftab studying all of his battle tactics and still felt a strong connection to his father. Aftab is a Colonel with the Resistance in &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, He appears in several scenes, including a Resistance meeting to discuss the resurrection of Emperor Palpatine, and the final space battle over Exegol, during which he pilots a B-wing starfighter.

==Characterization==
Ackbar is portrayed as a military genius, with a masterful grasp of warfare tactics and strategy, a forward-thinking vision, and a prowess for organizational, administrative, and technical details that make him a highly effective commander. Across all his appearances in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, he possesses tactical intelligence and strong leadership skills, and is widely admired and respected by his troops. Ackbar has a methodical style, and tends to be cautious and conservative, as demonstrated by his initial call for a tactical retreat during the Battle of Endor upon learning that it was a trap. He prefers to personally lead major assaults, fearlessly flying into the battlefield along with his soldiers. Ackbar is resourceful and uses outside-the-box methods to improve himself as an officer. For example, in the novel &quot;Aftermath&quot;, Ackbar practices with melee weapons against holograms of Imperial stormtroopers. Though he acknowledges that he is unlikely to face melee combat as a high-ranking officer, he engages in the practice because he feels staying proficient in fighting techniques helps him stay sharp, flexible, and ahead of his enemies. Ackbar also studies various forms of weaponry and fighting, and has strong design skills, made evident by his role in designing the B-wing starfighter.

Ackbar is also regularly portrayed as wise, with a noble personality and a quiet but firm temperament. Rising from humble beginnings, he is a peaceful being who is forced to learn war due to tyranny of the Empire, and never stops working for peace despite understanding the necessity of war. Despite his success as a warrior, his actions are usually shown to be tempered by justice, honor, and concern. In the &quot;Star Wars&quot; sequel trilogy and other media set around that time period, Ackbar is portrayed as more gruff in his older age, during which he commands officers many years or even decades younger than him, sometimes referring to them as &quot;fry&quot;. His dedication to his career and duty left little time for a personal life or romances, and as a result he does not have a family of his own, with the exception of two nieces.

==Concept and creation==
===Conception===

In the original script for &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, Ackbar&#x27;s appearance was more conventionally humanoid, with blue skin and more physically attractive; the second draft of the screenplay described him as a &quot;pale blue nonhuman&quot;. &quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas later decided he should be an alien creature instead, and gave the film&#x27;s director, Richard Marquand, the option to pick a look for Ackbar from a collection of about 50 alien designs, despite Marquand&#x27;s initial insistence that Lucas himself make the choice. Marquand picked a painting by concept artist Nilo Rodis-Jamero of an anonymous alien with no established backstory or personality.

Rodis-Jamero&#x27;s first Ackbar sketch was created in the fall of 1981, two years before &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; was released, and was known at the time simply as a &quot;Calamari man&quot;. The original image mostly resembled how Ackbar ended up in the final film, except with a larger chin, slightly more misshapen head, and a hunchback. The hunch was inspired by Industrial Light &amp; Magic technician Stuart Ziff, who regularly joked about his own slightly hunched posture. Marquand said he &quot;picked the most delicious, wonderful creature out of the whole lot, this big wonderful Calamari man with a red face and eyes on the side&quot;. Others working on the film opposed the choice, believing the character looked too silly or ugly and would be mocked, but Marquand insisted upon the choice and their objections were rejected. Marquand said of those concerns: &quot;I think it&#x27;s good to tell kids that good people aren&#x27;t necessarily good-looking people and that bad people aren&#x27;t necessarily ugly people.&quot;

Ackbar&#x27;s first name, Gial, was not established until the April 2012 release of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; reference book &quot;The Essential Guide to Warfare&quot;. Co-author Paul R. Urquhart told the website TheForce.net said the name was taken from Gial Gahan, a Mon Calamari Senator character who played a minor role in the &quot;Star Wars: Legacy&quot; comic book series. While the name Gial was established in material that has since been rebranded as part of the Legends canon, the first name is still considered part of the official canon, and has been re-confirmed as Ackbar&#x27;s name in canon reference books like &quot;Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need To Know&quot;, as well as other canon &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels.

===Costume and puppet===

Ackbar&#x27;s appearance in the film was created using a combination of either a half-body puppet or a full-body costume, depending on the camera angle required for the shot. The puppet and mask were created by the &quot;Monster Shop&quot; of Industrial Light &amp; Magic, the motion picture visual effects company founded by Lucas. In close-up scenes of Ackbar that required dialogue, puppeteer Timothy M. Rose sat inside the chest of the character and operated the head like a traditional hand puppet from below. Rose moved the mouth using his hand, while Mike Quinn operated the eyes via cables. The jumpsuit of that version of the costume was cut off at the waist, and each sleeves included additional access points where a puppeteer could insert his or her arm to control Ackbar&#x27;s hands.

For wider shots that showed Ackbar&#x27;s full body, Rose wore the mask and costume while Quinn operated the mouth via remote. Though most other Rebel officers in the &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; briefing room scene wore earth tones, Rodis-Jamero felt Ackbar&#x27;s costume should be more crisp and distinctive: &quot;He was an admiral. He was more military. His costume looks hard.&quot; Costume designer Aggie Guerard Rodgers helped create the Ackbar costume, for which Rose wore a beanbag-like piece around his belly to create Ackbar&#x27;s distinctive silhouette. Rose wore a white nylon jumpsuit over it, which had a pattern loosely based on ski jumpsuits used in costuming other background characters, as well as yellow striping down the side of the legs. The artificial fabric used on the jumpsuit made a distinct scratching sound whenever the actor walked, which Rodgers said was a nuisance for the film&#x27;s sound crew.

Over the jumpsuit, Rose wore a vest made of white felt, along with a white plastic utility belt, a rank badge on the left side of his chest, and a large collar to accommodate the unique profile of Ackbar&#x27;s head. The white boots Ackbar wears in the film are the same design as those worn by Imperial stormtroopers. A white helmet with an elongated back to accommodate Ackbar&#x27;s large oval-shaped head was featured in original character sketches and was created for Ackbar. However, it created too many complications with the operation of the puppet head, so it was worn by another Mon Calamari character instead. Edwina Pellikka, a textile artist who handled the breakdown and aging of costumes in the film, said she was unhappy with the final result of Ackbar&#x27;s costume. She later reflected that the all-white costume could have used more aging, saying: &quot;I had to airbrush it, which was done very fast and it does look kind of like it&#x27;s outlined. Not enough was done with that.&quot;

===Filming===
Ackbar has 14 lines of dialogue in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, and the character&#x27;s scenes took six weeks to shoot. Due to uncertainty whether the mouth about movement Ackbar puppet would look realistic while delivering dialogue, alternative scenes were shot with General Crix Madine, a human character portrayed by Dermot Crowley, delivering Ackbar&#x27;s most important lines, in case they had to be used instead. None of these shots ultimately had to be used in the final film. Occasionally, members of the film crew jokingly referred to the Ackbar character as &quot;Ernie Ackbar&quot;, and his name appeared that way on some of the film&#x27;s progress reports. When the inside of the costume became hot, visual effects artist Phil Tippett, who designed most of the film&#x27;s creatures, would use a hair dryer to blow cool air through the mouth of the Ackbar mask to keep Rose comfortable.

Although the character was created with the best available puppetry technology at the time, Lucas was not entirely pleased with the final result and felt it was a compromise. According to the book &quot;Star Wars Costumes: The Original Trilogy&quot;, published in 2014, the original masks used for the Ackbar costumes are &quot;in a fragile state today.&quot; During filming of the 2005 &quot;Star Wars&quot; film &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, Lucas was so impressed with the animatron mask used on the Mon Calamari character Meena Tills that he briefly considered reediting &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; and replacing footage of Admiral Ackbar with an improved mask. This ultimately never occurred.

==Portrayals==
===Timothy Rose===

Timothy Rose had been a puppeteer working on several projects for The Jim Henson Company (including &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;), when Jim Henson directed him and others from the company to work on &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. He was not originally hired to portray Admiral Ackbar, but instead to help build and operate the Sy Snootles puppet for the Max Rebo Band, which performs at the palace of the alien crime lord Jabba the Hutt. While backstage at the workshop where several alien puppets were stored, Rose saw Ackbar&#x27;s sculpt on a display stand and asked Phil Tippett if he could play the part. Tippett told him it was a background character, and Rose did not know Ackbar would play a major supporting role in the film. He only asked to portray him because he liked the look of the character, and said he was &quot;thinking he was going to be in the third row in a new cantina sequence or something&quot;. Rose was not required to audition for the part of Ackbar before being given the role.

Rose returned to portray Ackbar in &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; and &quot;The Last Jedi&quot;. Each day he was provided with pages from the script only for the specific scenes that were being shot, so he knew little about the final role Ackbar would play in the films until shooting took place. Rose was frustrated by the amount of secrecy on the set, which he felt prevented him and the other actors from having everything they needed to do their jobs as well as possible. Many of Ackbar&#x27;s scenes were cut from the first film, which Rose said was a disappointment to him &quot;after waiting 30 years to reprise Ackbar&quot;. After the character&#x27;s scenes in &quot;The Last Jedi&quot; were complete, the crew took footage of Rose in the Ackbar&#x27;s costume saying &quot;It&#x27;s a wrap&quot;, a reference to the character&#x27;s death and his famous &quot;It&#x27;s a trap&quot; line. That shot was featured in behind-the-scenes footage shown at the 2017 D23 Expo. Although intended as a joke, Rose found the gesture offensive and said he was &quot;in tears in the suit&quot;.

===Erik Bauersfeld===

The voice of Admiral Ackbar in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; was performed by Erik Bauersfeld, a radio dramatist who also voiced the alien character Bib Fortuna in the film, and had unsuccessfully auditioned to voice Yoda in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. He was cast after &quot;Star Wars&quot; sound designer Ben Burtt approached him in 1983, while Bauersfeld was producing a radio drama with Lucasfilm sound designer Randy Thom and suggested he audition for the part of Ackbar. The recording session took one hour, and Bauersfeld made up the voice on the spot after looking at a photograph of Ackbar, without having any other information about the character. According to Bauersfeld: &quot;I saw the face, and I knew what he must sound like.&quot;

Bauersfeld did not receive an on-screen credit for his roles as Ackbar and Bib Fortuna, and his association with the characters was unknown for years after the film was released. In a 1999 interview, Timothy Rose said he did not know who provided the voice, and thought it was possible that it was his own voice modified with a synthesizer. Eventually fans learned Bauersfeld played the parts and he began to receive multiple fan letters every week, which continued for the rest of his life. Bauersfeld said he appreciated the passion of fans and responded to every autograph request, but that he was not particularly knowledgeable about &quot;Star Wars&quot; himself; in 2011 interview, he said he had not seen &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; since it first came out, still had not seen the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, and had trouble imitating Ackbar&#x27;s voice because he could not remember what it sounded like.

Bauersfeld reprised the role in the 1993 computer game &quot;Star Wars: X-Wing&quot;. Film director J. J. Abrams requested that Bauersfeld once again play Ackbar in the 2015 film &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;. It was Bauersfeld&#x27;s final role before his death in April 2016.

===Other performers===

Bauersfield was replaced by Tom Kane in &quot;The Last Jedi&quot;. Kane has portrayed Ackbar in several other works of &quot;Star Wars&quot; media, including the 2004 and 2015 versions of &quot;Star Wars: Battlefront&quot;, the video game &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; (2016), and the Disney attraction Star Tours – The Adventures Continue. Voice actor Artt Butler, who was a fan of Ackbar ever since watching the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films as a child, portrayed the character in the television series &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;. Dave Filoni, supervising director for the series, said the staff debated whether the younger version of Ackbar would still have the same &quot;iconic voice&quot; as in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; or whether he would sound different on the show, but they ultimately went with a similar-sounding voice.

Breckin Meyer portrayed Ackbar in the &quot;Robot Chicken: Star Wars&quot; series, a &quot;Star Wars&quot;-themed version of the stop motion sketch comedy television series &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; on Adult Swim dedicated entirely to &quot;Star Wars&quot; parodies. Meyer, who also wrote for the series, called voicing Ackbar &quot;my favorite (experience) in the history of the world&quot;. Meyer said he tries to mimic Ackbar&#x27;s voice from &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; as best he can, but that the humor comes through because &quot;the actual voice is just funny&quot;. &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; co-creator Seth Green said of Meyer&#x27;s performance: &quot;When Breckin does Ackbar, it splits me every time. No matter what he says, it&#x27;s always funny.&quot;

==Cultural impact==
===Critical reception===

Despite his small role in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, Admiral Ackbar is considered a fan favorite among &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters. Dave Filoni, a Lucasfilm animation producer who has worked on several &quot;Star Wars&quot; television shows, said of the character: &quot;Ackbar has a crazy level of fame for the amount of time he&#x27;s spent onscreen. It&#x27;s the Boba Fett phenomenon, where you&#x27;ve got a character who doesn&#x27;t really do a lot, but is so beloved that it eventually spreads outside the realm of fandom.&quot; He was ranked No. 16 in a 1998 list of the &quot;Top 20 &quot;Star Wars&quot; Characters&quot; featured in the magazine &quot;Star Wars Insider&quot;. That same issue included a separate list ranking the characters based on an index that accounted for their popularity ranking in proportion to the number of lines they speak in the films, to &quot;take into consideration the amount of dialogue a character had to make an impression on fans&quot;. With only 14 lines in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, Ackbar ranked third on that list, behind only Boba Fett and Wedge Antilles. Ackbar was also ranked No. 12 in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; ranking of 66 characters from the franchise, No. 14 in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;″s ranking of 93 characters, and No. 21 on &quot;IGN&quot;″s list of the Top 25 &quot;Star Wars&quot; Heroes.

Scott Chernoff, a writer for &quot;Star Wars Insider&quot;, called Ackbar&#x27;s character &quot;one of the most visually striking and memorable characters introduced in the final installment of the saga&quot;. Chernoff added that Ackbar performer Timothy Rose was one of the most-requested subjects by readers for his magazine column interviewing &quot;Star Wars&quot; actors. &quot;The Independent&quot; writer Christopher Hooton called Ackbar &quot;easily the best character from the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; films&quot;. Jonathan Wilkins, editor at large for &quot;Star Wars Insider&quot;, called Ackbar &quot;an iconic figure in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, despite the fact that he had just a handful of lines in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. Steve Tilley of &quot;The Edmonton Sun&quot; wrote, &quot;He was so funny-looking yet somehow authoritative and almost regal, though, that he was impossible not to love.&quot; Rebecca Hawkes of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; credited Erik Bauersfeld in particular with &quot;bringing the much-loved Ackbar to life, imbuing the fish-eyed orange monster with a voice, a forceful personality, and a lasting cult appeal&quot;. During the 2000 United States presidential election, several websites were established jokingly proposing Admiral Ackbar as a write-in candidate for president.

===&quot;It&#x27;s a trap!&quot;===

Admiral Ackbar&#x27;s line, &quot;It&#x27;s a trap!&quot;, which he says during the Battle of Endor in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, became one of the most famous and beloved lines from the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. The line has become a popular Internet meme, with &quot;The Independent&quot; calling him &quot;perhaps the franchise&#x27;s most memed character&quot;. More than 1,000 fan videos have been created on the video-sharing website YouTube featuring or parodying Ackbar and that line of dialogue, including trap music and techno remixes built around it. The line did not appear in the original script for &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, and instead was first written as &quot;It&#x27;s a trick!&quot;, but it was changed in post-production after the filmmakers decided it was not as effective a line as they had originally hoped.

Erik Bauersfeld said of the line: &quot;The fans who write say they&#x27;ll never forget &#x27;It&#x27;s a trap!&#x27; I don&#x27;t even remember how I said it.&quot; &quot;International Business Times&quot; writer Amy West said the line has &quot;become somewhat cult-like in the eyes of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; fanbase&quot;. Ben Sherlock of Screen Rant called the line &quot;one of the most memorable quotes in the saga&#x27;s history, for reasons that are unknown yet somehow obvious, and it immortalized what could&#x27;ve been a forgettable character&quot;. Renaldo Matadeen of Comic Book Resources called the line &quot;a pop culture touchstone&quot;.

Footage of Ackbar reciting the line was featured on both Comedy Central comedy shows &quot;The Daily Show&quot; and &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; on February 11, 2010, alongside clips of various Republican Party politicians insisting a White House invitation by President Barack Obama was a trap. &quot;It&#x27;s a Trap!&quot;, the 2011 episode of the animated comedy series &quot;Family Guy&quot; spoofing &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, took its name from Ackbar&#x27;s famous line; Ackbar himself makes an appearance in the episode, portrayed by the character Klaus Heissler – a talking goldfish – from the animated series &quot;American Dad!&quot;. Additionally, a smartphone app was developed with the sole purpose of playing Ackbar&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a trap!&quot; line whenever the user pushes a button.

In 2018, the comic strip story in which Ackbar made his debut in 1982 was retroactively titled after the character&#x27;s famous line.

===Response to Ackbar&#x27;s death===
Several fans expressed disappointment with Ackbar&#x27;s sudden death in &quot;The Last Jedi&quot;, calling it abrupt and unceremonious. Fans particularly criticized that Ackbar was only featured in the background of the shot where he dies, with the camera focused primarily on Leia Organa, and that his death is mentioned only in passing by other characters later. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; writer Ben Sherlock wrote of Ackbar&#x27;s death: &quot;It was such a fleeting moment that many fans didn&#x27;t even realize it had happened. They looked down for one second to get a handful of popcorn, and when they looked back up, Ackbar was gone&quot;. Nate Jones of &quot;New York&quot; magazine&#x27;s website Vulture, called the death scene &quot;disrespectful&quot; and &quot;unfathomably rude&quot;, and that Ackbar &quot;deserved better than to go out in a throwaway moment&quot;.

Ackbar actors Tim Rose and Tom Kane also said they were disappointed with how the character&#x27;s death was handled. Rose hoped Ackbar would have a more substantial role in &quot;The Last Jedi&quot; than he had in the latter film, and was unhappy the character again received little screen time and was abruptly killed. Rose said: &quot;Each day I would come to work going, &#x27;Is today the day when Ackbar gets something a bit more involving?&#x27; And I looked at my script and I went, &#x27;Oh, Ackbar&#x27;s going out of the window. Well, that&#x27;s that then!&#x27;&quot;. Kane likewise thought the death scene was poorly handled, and believed Ackbar should have been given the larger role in &quot;The Last Jedi&quot; that went to Vice-Admiral Amilyn Holdo, a new character played by Laura Dern. &quot;The Last Jedi&quot; editor Bob Ducsay said he was also disappointed with how the scene was handled, saying it was &quot;slightly incidental&quot;, though he said the scene was intentionally designed that way and he did not come to have second thoughts about it until after watching the completed film. Gary Whitta, who co-wrote the story for the film &quot;Rogue One&quot; and wrote several other &quot;Star Wars&quot; projects, said he was saddened by how quickly Ackbar died.

Others defended the way Ackbar&#x27;s character was killed. Alex Leadbeater, features editor of the website &quot;Screen Rant&quot;, felt the scene was widely misunderstood by fans and served to advance the storyline, particularly to establish the ensuing conflict between Holdo and Resistance pilot Poe Dameron. Leadbeater wrote: &quot;Ackbar had no place in &quot;The Last Jedi&quot;″s narrative. ... You can argue he should have had a greater send off (but) it must be said that to do so would undercut the entire set piece.&quot; In &quot;The Last Jedi&quot; episode of the comedic animated webseries &quot;How It Should Have Ended&quot;, which parodies and reimagines aspects of popular films, Ackbar&#x27;s character survives the bridge attack after claiming he has to go to the bathroom at the time the bridge is shot, and he assumes control of the Resistance afterward.

===Cultural references===
The first Admiral Ackbar action figure was released in 1983, the same year as &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. In 1996, Ackbar was one of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters to receive its own Micro Machines mini-transforming playsets by Galoob. The toy line included miniature versions of the head of each character, which opened to reveal a small set from the film and a figurine of the character itself. The Ackbar playset was sold as part of a collection that also included an Boba Fett and a Gamorrean guard. A Lego figurine of Ackbar was created and released as part of multiple Lego &quot;Star Wars&quot; toy sets, including with the Lego &quot;Home One&quot; Calamari cruiser in 2009, the Lego A-Wing Starfighter in 2013, and the Lego Resistance Troop Transporter in 2015. Ackbar&#x27;s full-sized costume from &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; was featured in a 200-piece exhibition of &quot;Star Wars&quot; costumes, props, and other memorabilia at the Smithsonian Institution called &quot;Star Wars: The Magic of Myth&quot;. The exhibit opened at the Washington, D.C. museum complex in 1997 and later went on a national tour that lasted until 2002 and visited various museums, including the San Diego Museum of Art, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Toledo Museum of Art, and the Brooklyn Museum.

Ackbar has repeatedly appeared in the &quot;Robot Chicken: Star Wars&quot; series, most prominently featured in a sketch portraying a commercial for &quot;Admiral Ackbar Cereal&quot;, with Ackbar presenting the breakfast cereal to two children and declaring, &quot;Your tongues can&#x27;t repel flavor of that magnitude!&quot;, a spoof of his line from &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. Several additional Ackbar skits were conceived but never completed, including one in which he is a Costco greeter, and another in which he contracts gonorrhea from a stripper and is told by a doctor &quot;It&#x27;s the clap!&quot;, in reference to Ackbar&#x27;s famous line &quot;It&#x27;s a trap!&quot; The &quot;It&#x27;s a trap!&quot; line was also referenced on the television comedy show &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;. Ackbar was featured in a 2009 CollegeHumor video called &quot;Ackbar! The Star Wars Talk Show&quot;, where he played the host of a talk show similar to &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;. Morgan Phillips, an independent hip hop musician and disc jockey, included a song about the character called &quot;Admiral Ackbar Please&quot; on his album &quot;Star Wars Breakbeats&quot;.

In 2010, when the University of Mississippi began a process to find a new mascot to replace Colonel Reb, students Matthew Henry, Tyler Craft, Joseph Katool, and Ben McMurtray started a campaign to have Admiral Ackbar selected. Although their efforts started out as a joke, some students began to seriously push for the idea, while others strongly opposed it and felt it was an embarrassment for the university. Some students went so far as threatening to transfer out of the school if he was chosen, and some prospective parents said they would not let their children attend there. The campaign quickly went viral and received national news media attention. Lucasfilm ultimately declined to give the school the rights to use the character, and issued a tongue-in-cheek statement about the matter which read: &quot;The last time we checked in with Admiral Ackbar he was leading the Rebel Alliance Fleet on a critical mission so it will be difficult for him to show up for the games.&quot; A black bear was instead chosen as the new mascot.

<doc id="163026" wikidata="Q523926" url="?curid=163026" title="Royal Academy of Dramatic Art">
<text>The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, also known by its abbreviation RADA (), is a drama school in London, England, which provides vocational conservatoire training for theatre, film, television, and radio. It is based in Bloomsbury, Central London, close to the Senate House complex of the University of London, and is a founding member of the Federation of Drama Schools. 

RADA is one of the oldest drama schools in the United Kingdom, founded in 1904 by Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree. It moved to buildings on Gower Street in 1905. It was granted a royal charter in 1920 and a new theatre was built on Malet Street, behind the Gower Street buildings, which was opened in 1921 by Edward, Prince of Wales. It received its first government subsidy in 1924. RADA currently has five theatres and a cinema. The school&#x27;s principal industry partner is Warner Bros. Entertainment.

RADA offers a number of foundation, undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Its higher education awards are validated by King&#x27;s College London (KCL). The royal patron of the school is King Charles III, following the death of Queen Elizabeth II in 2022. The president is David Harewood, who succeeded Kenneth Branagh in February 2024, with Cynthia Erivo appointed vice president. The chairman is Marcus Ryder, who succeeded Sir Stephen Waley-Cohen in 2021. Its vice-chairman was Alan Rickman until his death in 2016. The current principal of the academy is Niamh Dowling, who succeeded Edward Kemp in 2022.

==History==

The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art was founded on 25 April 1904 by actor-manager Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree (the grandfather of actor Oliver Reed) at the West End&#x27;s Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre (now His Majesty&#x27;s) situated in Haymarket in the City of Westminster, London. In 1905, RADA moved to 62 Gower Street, and a managing council was set up to oversee the school. Its members included George Bernard Shaw, who later donated his royalties from his play &quot;Pygmalion&quot; to RADA and gave lectures to students at the school. In 1920, RADA was granted a royal charter and, in 1921, a new theatre was built on Malet Street behind the Gower Street buildings. Edward, Prince of Wales, opened the theatre. In 1923, Sir John Gielgud studied at RADA for a year. He later became president of the academy and its first honorary fellow. In 1924, RADA received its first government subsidy, a grant of £500. The Gower Street buildings were torn down in 1927 and replaced with a new building, financed by Bernard Shaw, who also left one-third of his royalties to the academy on his death in 1950. The academy has received other government funding at various times, including a £22.7 million grant from the Arts Council National Lottery Board in 1996, which was used to renovate its premises and rebuild the Jerwood Vanbrugh Theatre.
In 2000, the academy founded RADA Enterprises Ltd, now known as RADA Business, providing training programmes and coaching for organisations and individuals in communications and team building which use drama training techniques in a business context. The profits are fed back into the academy to help cover its costs. In 2001, RADA joined with the London Contemporary Dance School to create the UK&#x27;s first Conservatoire for Dance and Drama (CDD). RADA left the CDD in August 2019 to become an independent higher education provider. RADA is also a founder member of the Federation of Drama Schools, established in 2017.

In 2004, celebrity photographer Cambridge Jones was commissioned to create a body of work published as a book, &quot;Off Stage: 100 Portraits Celebrating the RADA Centenary&quot;, in 2005 to celebrate RADA&#x27;s centenary. The photographs include John Hurt, Alan Rickman, Sheila Hancock, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Ralph Fiennes, Edward Woodward, Sir Ian Holm, Richard Attenborough, Joan Collins, Tom Courtenay, Warren Mitchell, Imelda Staunton, June Whitfield, Richard Briers, Glenda Jackson, Juliet Stevenson, Jonathan Pryce, Kenneth Branagh, Ioan Gruffud, Susannah York and Timothy Spall.
In 2011, the Lir Academy was established in association with RADA at Trinity College Dublin, with the partnership of the Cathal Ryan Trust. Following RADA’s conservatoire-style, practical theatre training, the Lir Academy modelled its courses after the London-based school.

RADA has been registered with the Office for Students as a higher education institution since July 2018. The current principal of the academy, Niamh Dowling, succeeded Edward Kemp in 2022. The current president, David Harewood, succeeded Kenneth Branagh in February 2024, with Cynthia Erivo appointed vice president.

==Courses==

RADA&#x27;s higher education awards are validated by King&#x27;s College London (KCL) and its students graduate alongside members of the KCL Faculty of Arts &amp; Humanities. It is based in the Bloomsbury area of Central London, close to the Senate House complex of the University of London. It is a founder member of the Federation of Drama Schools.

RADA has expanded its course offering over the years. The school offers a three-year BA (Hons) in acting degree. The first stage management course was introduced in 1962 under the directorship of Dorothy Tenham, and today students on the technical theatre and stage management degree learn theatre production skills including lighting, sound, props, costume and make-up, stage management, production management and video design. In the 1990s it launched a programme of short courses for actors and theatre technicians from around the world, including a special course for students at the NYU Tisch School of the Arts.

Other courses include a one-year acting foundation course introduced in 2007; an MA in Text &amp; Performance, affiliated with Birkbeck, University of London, introduced in 2010; and an MA Theatre Lab course introduced in 2011.

==Campus==

RADA is based in the Bloomsbury area of Central London. The main RADA building where classes and rehearsals take place is on Gower Street (with a second entrance on Malet Street), with a second premise nearby in Chenies Street where RADA Studios is located. The Goodge Street and Euston Square underground stations are both within walking distance.

The Gower and Malet Street building was redeveloped in the late 1990s to designs by Bryan Avery, and incorporated the new theatres and linking the entrances on both streets.

===Theatres===
RADA has five theatres and a cinema. In the Malet Street building, the Jerwood Vanburgh Theatre is the largest performance space with a capacity of 194; the George Bernard Shaw Theatre is a black box theatre with a capacity of up to 70; and the Gielgud Theatre is an intimate studio theatre with a capacity of up to 50. In January 2012, RADA acquired the lease to the adjacent Drill Hall venue in Chenies Street and renamed it RADA Studios. The Drill Hall is a Grade II listed building with a long performing arts history, and was where Nijinsky rehearsed with Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes in 1911. This venue has a 200-seat space, the Studio Theatre, and a 50-seat space, the Club Theatre.

In April 2016, planning permission was granted for the redevelopment of the Chenies Street premises as part of the Richard Attenborough Campaign.

===Library===
The RADA library contains around 30,000 items. Works include around 10,000 plays; works of or about biography, costume, criticism, film, fine art, poetry, social history, stage design, technical theatre and theatre history; screenplays; and theatre periodicals. The collection was started in 1904 with donations from actors and writers of the time such as Sir Squire Bancroft, William Archer, Sir Arthur Wing Pinero and George Bernard Shaw.

===Other facilities===
Other facilities at RADA include acting studios, a scenic art workshop with paint frame, costume workrooms and costume store, dance and fight studios, design studios, wood and metal workshops, sound studios, rehearsal studios, and the RADA Foyer Bar, which includes a fully licensed bar, a café and a box office.

==Admissions==

RADA accepts up to 28 new students each year into its three-year BA (Hons) in Acting course, with a 50–50 split of male and female students. Admission into the three-year BA (Hons) in Acting course is based on suitability and successful audition, via the four-stage audition process, spanning several months. Auditions are held in London as well as in New York, Los Angeles, Dublin, and across the UK – in recent years this has included Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Chester, Leicester, Sheffield, Manchester, Newcastle and Plymouth. Free auditions are offered to any applicants with a household income of under £25,000.

RADA also teaches Technical Theatre &amp; Stage Management (TTSM) – a two-year foundation degree and with a further &#x27;completion&#x27; year to BA level which has to be separately applied for and which allows for specialisation in all theatre craft areas. The TTSM course admits up to 30 students a year with a 50–50 gender balance, with the option to interview in Manchester and Plymouth.

RADA’s postgraduate training currently comprises a MA Theatre Lab programme and a Postgraduate Diploma in Theatre Costume (both validated by King&#x27;s College London). RADA also jointly teaches an MA in Text and Performance with Birkbeck, University of London, where students on this course are enrolled at RADA as well as registered at Birkbeck. Both MA courses frequently collaborated according to their specialisms (i.e. directors on the Text &amp; Performance programme using actors from the Theatre Lab course). Rehearsals and performances for the programmes are done mostly in the Chenies Street and Malet Street buildings.

In addition, RADA offers a series of short courses, masterclasses and summer courses for a range of standards and ages. Previous attendees have included Allison Janney, Liev Schreiber, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Emma Watson. The Academy’s education, widening participation and outreach work includes two Youth Companies, schools&#x27; workshops, Access to Acting workshops for young disabled people, Shakespeare tours to secondary schools and the RADA Shakespeare Awards.

Undergraduate students are eligible for government student loans. RADA also has a scholarships and bursaries scheme, which offers financial assistance to students.

<text>Šabac (, ) is a city and the administrative centre of the Mačva District in western Serbia. The traditional centre of the fertile Mačva region, Šabac is located on the right banks of the river Sava. , the city proper has population of 51,163, while its administrative area comprises 105,432 inhabitants.

==Name==
The name &quot;Šabac&quot; was first mentioned in Ragusan documents dating to 1454. The origin of the city&#x27;s name is uncertain; it is possible its name comes from the name of the city&#x27;s main river, the Sava. The city is known by a variety of different names: &quot;Zaslon&quot; in medieval Serbian, &quot;Szabács&quot; in Hungarian, &quot;Böğürdelen&quot; in Turkish, and &quot;Schabatz&quot; in German.

==History==

Archaeological evidence attests to more permanent settlement in the area from the Neolithic. In the Middle Ages, a Slavic settlement named &quot;Zaslon&quot; existed at the current location of Šabac. The settlement was part of the Serbian Despotate until it fell to the Ottoman Empire in 1459.

In 1470, the Ottomans built the first fortress in the town and named it &quot;Beyerdelen&quot; (Böğürdelen, meaning &quot;side-striker&quot;). In 1476 the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus captured the fort; it remained under administration of the Kingdom of Hungary until 1521, when it was again captured by the Ottomans. Under Hungarian administration, the town was part of the Banate of Macsó, whereas under Ottoman administration it was firstly part of the Sanjak of Zvornik within the Province of Bosnia, and later part of the Sanjak of Smederevo. Šabac was the administrative centre of the nahiye of Šabac, a local Ottoman administrative unit. During the Ottoman period, Šabac was a typical oriental town with tiny streets, small shops and several mosques. The population was composed of both Muslims and Serbs, along with smaller numbers of Hungarians and Croats.

Until the 19th century, Šabac was mostly under Ottoman administration, but control of the town changed hands several times between the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburg monarchy during the Ottoman-Habsburg wars. The first period of Habsburg rule began in 1718, when Šabac was incorporated into the Habsburg Kingdom of Serbia. After the Treaty of Belgrade (1739), Šabac reverted to Ottoman control and, straddling the boundary between the two empires, it gained importance as a market town. A second period of Habsburg control of the area followed starting in 1789. The storming of the city was one of the early experiences of the renowned military leader Józef Poniatowski. Ottoman control over the area was restored a few years later.

Šabac became a site of importance in Serbian history in the First Serbian Uprising when, in 1806, Karađorđe led the Serbian insurgents into one of the first victories over the Ottoman army near the nearby village of Mišar. Until 1813, the town was part of Revolutionary Serbia. A brief period of restored Ottoman control followed, but after the Second Serbian Uprising in 1815, Šabac was included into the now-autonomous Principality of Serbia under the Obrenović dynasty. This first ruling family of modern Serbia left its mark on the town; &quot;knez&quot; Miloš Obrenović&#x27;s brother, the enlightened Jevrem Obrenović, built a personal residence and helped modernise the town: the period from 1820 to 1850 saw the establishment of a hospital, a pharmacy, a Serbian grammar school, a gymnasium, a theatre, and a musical society.

The Ottoman army evacuated the fort of Šabac in 1867, marking the end of the Ottoman presence in the area. The first newspaper in the Kingdom of Serbia was printed in Šabac in 1883, and the town was also the first in Serbia where women started visiting kafanas (pubs) on Sunday afternoons, as was customary for men.

The town prospered until the First World War, when it was occupied and devastated by the Austro-Hungarian army and had its population halved (from cca. 14,000 to 7,000) on the orders of Kasimir von Lütgendorf, despite the fact that the Royal Serbian Army evacuated the town without resistance. Lütgendorf later ordered three of his own soldiers to be publicly executed by bayonet in the town square for drunkenly discharging their rifles despite orders from his superior Karl Tersztyánszky von Nádas to stop, leading to him being court-martialed and convicted for murder after the war in 1920. World War I is also remembered for the battle on nearby Cer mountain where the Serbian army under general Stepa Stepanović won an early victory against Austria-Hungary in August 1914, the first Allied victory in the war. After the war, Šabac was decorated with the French War Cross with Palm (1920), the Czechoslovak War Cross (1925), and the Order of the Karađorđe&#x27;s Star with Swords (1934).

In 1918, the town became a part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia). From 1918 to 1922, it was the administrative seat of Podrinje District, from 1922 to 1929 the administrative seat of Podrinje Oblast, and from 1929 to 1941 it was a part of the Drina Banovina. An early milestone in the Yugoslav era of the town&#x27;s history was the opening of the Zorka chemical plant in 1938. The city&#x27;s renewal was interrupted by World War II and occupation by German troops (from 1941 to 1944). During the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia, Šabac was part of the area governed by the Military Administration in Serbia. Its population of 1,200 Jews were arrested and ended in the ill-fated Kladovo transport. During the Uprising in Serbia the united rebel forces of the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland, forces of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and Pećanac Chetniks attacked German garrison in Šabac in an event known as Attack on Šabac, but failed to capture the town. In the German and Croatian Ustaše retributions 1,130 civilians were executed, 21,500 imprisoned and most of the populated places in Mačva were completely burned down. Eventually, 7,000 inmates were killed. The city was liberated from occupation by the Yugoslav Partisans in 1944. After the war, it was included into People&#x27;s Republic of Serbia within the new socialist Yugoslavia. Since then, it grew into a modern industrial city with the aforementioned Zorka chemical plant and an expanded population. The 1970s saw the construction of the first modern sports hall. The swamp at the city&#x27;s outskirts, Benska Bara, was drained and turned into a residential neighborhood, and a new bridge was built over the Sava river. By 2010, the population of the city and its suburbs had risen to 75,000.

<text>The Hongwu Emperor (21 October 1328– 24 June 1398), also known by his temple name as the Emperor Taizu of Ming, personal name Zhu Yuanzhang, courtesy name Guorui, was the founding emperor of the Ming dynasty, reigning from 1368 to 1398.

In the mid-14th century, China was plagued by epidemics, famines, and peasant uprisings during the rule of the Mongol Yuan dynasty. Zhu Yuanzhang, orphaned during this time of chaos, joined a Buddhist monastery as a novice monk, where he occasionally begged for alms to sustain himself, gaining an understanding of the struggles faced by ordinary people, while harboring disdain for scholars who only gained knowledge from books. In 1352, he joined a rebel division, quickly distinguishing himself among the rebels and rising to lead his own army. In 1356, he conquered Nanjing and established it as his capital. He formed his own government, consisting of both generals and Confucian scholars, rejecting Mongol rule over China. He adopted the concept of country administration from them and implemented it in the territory he controlled, eventually expanding it to the entire country. He gradually defeated rival rebel leaders, with the decisive moment being his victory over Chen Youliang in the Battle of Lake Poyang in 1363. In 1364, he declared himself King of Wu. In 1367, however, he still acknowledged his formal subordination to the main Red Turban leader, Han Lin&#x27;er, who claimed to be the successor of the Song dynasty.

In early 1368, after successfully dominating southern and central China, Zhu chose to rename his state. He decided on the name &quot;Da Ming&quot;, which translates to &quot;Great Radiance&quot;, for his empire. Additionally, he designated Hongwu, meaning &quot;Vastly Martial&quot;, as the name of the era and the motto of his reign. In the following four-year war, he drove out the Mongol armies loyal to the Yuan dynasty and unified the country, but his attempt to conquer Mongolia ended in failure. During the thirty-year reign of the Hongwu Emperor, Ming China experienced significant growth and recovered from the effects of prolonged wars. The emperor had a strong understanding of the structure of society and believed in implementing reforms to improve institutions. This approach differed from the Confucian belief that the ruler&#x27;s moral example was the most important factor. Hongwu also prioritized the safety of his people and the loyalty of his subordinates, demonstrating pragmatism and caution in military affairs. He maintained a disciplined army and made efforts to minimize the impact of war on civilians.

Although the peak of his political system crumbled in a civil war shortly after his death, other results of Hongwu&#x27;s reforms, such as local and regional institutions for Ming state administration and self-government, as well as the financial and examination systems, proved to be resilient. The census, land registration and tax system, and the Weisuo military system all endured until the end of the dynasty. His descendants continued to rule over all of China until 1644, and the southern region for an additional seventeen years.

==Youth==
Zhu Yuanzhang, the future Hongwu Emperor, was born in 1328 in Zhongli () village, located in Haozhou (present-day Fengyang, Anhui). He was the youngest of four sons in a poor peasant family. He was given the name Zhu Chongba () at birth, but later used the name Zhu Xingzong () in adulthood. After joining the rebels, he went by the name Zhu Yuanzhang. His father, Zhu Wusi, lived in Nanjing but fled to the countryside to avoid tax collectors. His paternal grandfather was a gold miner, and his maternal grandfather was a fortune-teller and seer. In 1344, during a plague epidemic, Zhu Yuanzhang&#x27;s parents and two brothers died. He managed to survive by entering a local Buddhist monastery, which was later closed due to a lack of funds. 

For the next three years, Zhu wandered as a mendicant monk, becoming familiar with the landscape and people of eastern Henan and northern Anhui. He then returned to the monastery in 1348 and stayed for four years, during which he learned to read, write, and study the basics of Buddhism. In 1352, when the Mongol army burned down the monks&#x27; dwellings during the Red Turban Rebellion, Zhu joined one of the rebel divisions.

==As rebel==
The harsh taxation policies, famine, and catastrophic flooding in the Yellow River basin, caused by inadequate flood control measures, led to widespread opposition to the rule of the Mongol Yuan dynasty. This discontent was further fueled by the presence of Taoist and Buddhist secret societies and sects, with the most prominent being the White Lotus society. In 1351, a rebellion known as the Red Turban Rebellion erupted and quickly spread throughout northern China. 

Despite the initial disorganization of the Mongol troops, they were able to launch a counteroffensive and advance along the Grand Canal. In October 1352, the Mongols captured Xuzhou, causing the rebel commanders Peng Da and Zhao Yunyong to flee south to Haozhou.

In Haozhou, the Yuan dynasty&#x27;s power fell in the spring of 1352. Guo Zixing, Sun Deya (), and three other leaders, with the support of the local elite, organized the army and took control in order to establish order in the city and its surrounding areas. The arrival of Peng and Zhao was seen as a clear connection to the rebels in the eyes of the Yuan dynasty. Guo submitted to Peng, while his four colleagues submitted to Zhao.

On 15 April 1352, Zhu Yuanzhang arrived in the city. Despite starting as a rank-and-file fighter, his exceptional leadership, decisiveness, warrior skills, and intelligence quickly gained him significant authority. Not only was Zhu known for his intelligence, but also for his unattractive appearance. He swiftly recruited 24 companions, who would eventually become generals in the Ming army, from his acquaintances who had already joined the rebels, and became their leader. Thanks to his abilities, he rose to prominence quickly, leading a 700-man squad by the spring of 1353 and becoming Guo&#x27;s most trusted subordinate. Skilled in both military tactics and political maneuvering, he even married Guo&#x27;s adopted daughter, surnamed Ma. A strong relationship developed between Lady Ma and Zhu, which would later give her great influence at court as empress. Unlike other leaders of his time, Zhu had a small number of relatives who were appointed to important positions. In the unstable political climate, family ties were crucial for ensuring loyalty and reliability.

The rivalry between Peng and Zhao escalated into a full-blown conflict. Guo was initially captured, but was later freed by his sons and Zhu, which only increased his reliance on Zhu. After Peng&#x27;s death in 1353, Zhao emerged as the dominant leader in the region, leaving Guo and Zhu isolated. Zhao sent Guo to the east and Zhu with a small detachment to the south, hoping to divide them and be able to destroy them. However, contrary to Zhao&#x27;s expectations, Zhu successfully occupied several counties and bolstered his army to 20,000 soldiers. Guo moved with Zhao&#x27;s ten thousand men to join him.

==Regional ruler==
===Establishment in Nanjing (1355–1360)===

In the beginning of 1355, Zhu, Guo, and Zhang Shicheng, who was located further east, made the decision to leave the war-torn territories and cross the Yangtze River to the prosperous southern regions that had not yet been affected by the war. However, a dispute arose between Guo and Zhu over the city of Hezhou, situated on the banks of the Yangtze River. Zhu even formed an alliance with Sun Deya, Guo&#x27;s old enemy. Before the conflict could escalate, Guo died. Following this, the rebel Song emperor Han Lin&#x27;er appointed Guo&#x27;s eldest son, Guo Tianxu, as his successor. Guo&#x27;s brother-in-law, Zhang Tianyu, was chosen as the first deputy of the new commander, with Zhu as the second deputy. In order to cross the Yangtze River, the Hezhou rebels required a fleet, which they acquired in July 1355 when a group of rebels from Chao Lake arrived. They successfully crossed the river that same month. Zhu immediately defeated the local Yuan commander, Chen Esen, who then surrendered to him. In September 1355, during an attempt to conquer Jiqing (present-day Nanjing), Chen Esen betrayed Guo Tianxu. In the ensuing battles, Guo Tianxu, Zhang Tianyu and Chen Esen himself were killed.

In March 1356, Zhu once again marched on Jiqing. The new Mongol commander, Chen Zhaoxian (), who was the nephew and successor of Chen Esen, surrendered with 36,000 men. In April 1356, Zhu successfully entered the city. After conquering it, he renamed the city Yingtian, which means &quot;In response to Heaven&quot;. In May 1356, Han Lin&#x27;er appointed Zhu as the head of Jiangnan Province, one of the five provinces of the Song state. Guo&#x27;s remaining son was chosen as his deputy. Zhu soon accused Guo&#x27;s son of plotting against him and had him executed. This allowed Zhu to establish clear leadership and he immediately began to build his administration, but he could not fully trust the loyalty of his generals. Until the victory at Lake Poyang in 1363, there were instances of betrayal and defection to the enemy.

He was now in command of an army of 100,000 soldiers, which was divided into divisions or wings (; &quot;yi&quot;). In Nanjing itself, there were eight divisions and one per prefecture. From 1355 to 1357, he launched attacks against Zhang Shicheng in the direction of Suzhou and successfully occupied southern Jiangxi; after this, the border with Zhang&#x27;s state was fortified on both sides and remained stable until 1366. In Zhejiang, from 1358 to 1359, he controlled four impoverished inland prefectures, while Zhang Shicheng held control over four prosperous northern coastal prefectures, and Fang Guozhen occupied the eastern coast of the province.

In the summer of 1359, the Mongol warlord Chaghan Temur expelled Han Lin&#x27;er from Kaifeng. Han was left with only a few hundred soldiers, but as Chaghan Temur focused on conquering Shandong, Han&#x27;s group was able to survive in Anfeng, a prefectural city in the west of Anhui. After the retreat from Kaifeng, the Song government&#x27;s power weakened rapidly. Apart from Zhu Yuanzhang&#x27;s effectively independent Jiangnan, no Song province survived 1362. In 1361, Han Lin&#x27;er appointed Zhu as the Duke of Wu (&quot;Wu Guogong&quot;) and recognized his rule in all the territories he conquered, but Zhu feared the advance of the Yuan troops in the southern direction, all the way to Nanjing. As a result, he proposed cooperation with Chaghan Temur. After Chaghan Temur&#x27;s army was unable to make progress in Shandong and he was murdered in the summer of 1362, the threat from the Yuan side disappeared. As a result, Zhu rejected the Yuan government&#x27;s offer of the post of governor of Jiangxi province.

The ideology of the Red Turbans did not resonate with Zhu. Instead of trying to establish a new intellectual elite based on the Manichean-Buddhist beliefs of the White Lotus, he chose to collaborate with Confucian intellectuals. This shift in approach transformed him from a leader of a popular sectarian uprising to the leader of a political movement seeking traditional legitimacy. Nevertheless, he still relied on the support of his officers who shared his devotion to the teachings of the White Lotus.

In 1354, he began working with Li Shanchang, a landowner from Dingyuan County, the first county conquered by Zhu. Li Shanchang was responsible for running the civil administration, and as Zhu conquered more cities, he recruited more scholars to join his cause. After repeated requests from Zhu in 1360, a group of prominent scholars, led by Song Lian and Liu Ji, joined his service. These scholars, known as the Jinhua school, had a clear vision of a unified state governed by a small but efficient bureaucracy. They aimed to eliminate corruption, which was prevalent during the end of the Yuan dynasty. They believed that the state and its laws could be used to improve public morals and customs. While their motives may have differed from the emperor&#x27;s, they shared a desire to bring about change through a strong state and an active monarch.

As an independent ruler, Zhu advocated for moderation in tax collection. However, other rebel leaders and his own generals prioritized military needs and often confiscated grain from peasants to feed their soldiers or prevent it from falling into the hands of their enemies. In contrast, Zhu placed great importance on maintaining orderly government and promoting a peaceful life for the inhabitants of his territory. He achieved this by working closely with local elites and understanding the needs of the villagers, having grown up as the son of a poor peasant himself. Zhu&#x27;s principles also proved beneficial for the economy of the controlled territory. In 1361, he began minting coins, established a monopoly on the sale of salt and tea, and started collecting traditional customs duties in 1362. These measures resulted in an increase in tax revenues, which were crucial for funding successful military campaigns.

===Conquest of Han (1360–1365)===
In the beginning of 1360, Zhu controlled the southwestern part of Jiangsu, all of Anhui south of the Yangtze River, and the inland of Zhejiang. By 1393, these territories had a population of 7.8 million. The domain (known as the Kingdom of Wu since 1363), led by Zhang Shicheng, had comparable power with a larger population but worse organization. Chen Youlang&#x27;s state of Han had a similar situation. The state of Han, located west of Zhu&#x27;s territory, included the provinces of Jiangxi and Hubei. Zhang, based in Suzhou, controlled the lower reaches of the Yangtze, from the eastern borders of Zhu&#x27;s dominions to the sea. While Zhu, Zhang, and Chen divided up the Yangtze River Basin, the rest of southern and central China was largely under the control of &quot;one-province&quot; regimes. Fang Guozhen controlled the eastern Chinese coast, Ming Yuzhen ruled in Sichuan, and the trio of Yuan loyalists (Chen Youding, He Zhen, and Basalawarmi) controlled Fujian, Guangdong, and Yunnan. These provincial regimes were unable to threaten the &quot;big three&quot;, but were strong in defense.

The war between Zhu&#x27;s Jiangnan and Chen Youliang&#x27;s Han state from 1360 to 1363 had a devastating impact on the balance of power in the Yangtze River Basin. This conflict not only gave Zhu a significant advantage over other rivals, but also increased his prestige among his own people. The fighting began when the Han army attacked Nanjing in 1360, but they were quickly defeated by Zhu. In 1361, the war spread to the Han province of Jiangxi, which changed hands multiple times. By the following year, Zhu had gained control of the province.

In January 1363, Zhang Shicheng&#x27;s army launched a surprise attack on Anfeng, the residence of Song emperor Han Lin&#x27;er, resulting in the death of Liu Futong, the de facto leader of the regime. Despite being formally under the control of the Song government, Zhu offered his army to assist Han Lin&#x27;er, who was still highly respected among the troops. As a result, the powerless Han Lin&#x27;er was relocated to Chuzhou, located west of Nanjing on the opposite side of the Yangtze River. However, the army remained stationed in the north until August 1363.

The departure of Zhu&#x27;s main forces to the north presented Chen with an opportunity to turn the tide of the war. He quickly raised an army of 300,000, outnumbering Zhu&#x27;s remaining forces. Chen&#x27;s plan was to capture Nanchang and then rally the local leaders in Jiangxi to join his cause and attack Nanjing, but the Nanchang garrison, led by Deng Yu (), held out until early June 1363. In mid-August, Zhu&#x27;s army and fleet finally set out from Nanjing with approximately 100,000 soldiers. The two fleets clashed on Lake Poyang on 29 August 1363, engaging in a four-day battle that resulted in the defeat of the Han fleet and the death of Chen Youliang.

In 1364–1365, Zhu focused on conquering and absorbing the Han&#x27;s territories. Numerous Han prefectural and county commanders surrendered without resistance, and Huguang was pacified by General Xu Da by April 1365. By February 1365, Generals Chang Yuchun and Deng Yu had gained control over central and southern Jiangxi. This annexation of territories provided Zhu with a significant population advantage over its adversaries. The main threats to Zhu at this time were the Mongol warlord Köke Temür in northern China and Zhang Shicheng, who was based in Suzhou.

Expansion of the army with former Han troops required a reorganization of the military. Therefore, in 1364, Zhu implemented the &quot;Weisuo&quot; system, which involved the formation of guards (&quot;wei&quot;) comprising 5,600 soldiers. These guards were further divided into 5 battalions (&quot;qianhusuo&quot;) of 1,120 soldiers each, with 10 companies (&quot;baihusuo&quot;) in each battalion.

After 1364, the army was made up of 17 guards consisting of veterans who had previously served before 1363. The older veterans were demobilized, while the others were assigned to the garrison in Nanjing where they worked as peasants, using their production to provide food for the army. Additional soldiers, who were reliable but had shorter periods of service, were acquired during the conquest of southern Anhui and central Zhejiang. They were stationed in the former Han territory, with field armies concentrated in Nanchang and Wuchang, and garrisons scattered across Jiangxi and Huguang. The remaining soldiers, mostly former Han soldiers, were joined by some veterans in the field armies sent to fight against the state of Wu under the leadership of Generals Xu Da and Chang Yuchun.

===Conquest of Wu and proclamation of the Ming dynasty (1364–1368)===

After Chen Youliang&#x27;s defeat, Zhu took on the title of King of Wu (&quot;Wu wang&quot;) starting from the new year (4 February) of 1364, which was the same title used by Zhang Shicheng since October 1363. Despite this, he still acknowledged his subordinate status to emperor Han Lin&#x27;er and used the Song era of Longfeng as long as Han was alive, but he ran his own administration, following the model of the Yuan dynasty.

In 1365–67, Zhu conquered the Zhang&#x27;s state of Wu. Zhang attempted to attack in late 1364, before the enemy could exploit the potential of the newly conquered territories, but their offensive was repulsed in the spring of 1365. Before launching a final attack on the enemy&#x27;s heartland, the Suzhou region, Zhu and his generals decided to first &quot;cut off the wings&quot; of Wu by occupying the territory north of the Yangtze and the Wu part of Zhejiang. Xu Da was appointed as the supreme commander of the attacking troops, and the plan was executed with ease due to the attacking army&#x27;s superiority. The ten-month siege of Suzhou began in December 1366.

In January 1367, Han Lin&#x27;er drowned in the Yangtze River. As a result, Zhu&#x27;s state of Wu officially declared its independence. A year later, in 1368, Zhu Yuanzhang proclaimed himself emperor and changed the name of the state. He followed the Mongol tradition of elevating titles and named the empire &quot;Great Ming&quot; (&quot;Da Ming&quot;; ; &#x27;Great Radiance&#x27;). He also renamed the upcoming &quot;second year of the Wu era&quot; as the &quot;first year of the Hongwu era&quot; (; &#x27;vastly martial&#x27;).

==Unification of China==
In the autumn of 1367, Zhu&#x27;s troops launched an attack against Fang Guozhen. By December of that year, they had successfully taken control of the entire coast. In November 1367, Hu Mei&#x27;s army, along with the fleets of Tang He and Liao Yongzhong, began their journey south. By February 1368, they had easily conquered Fujian, and by April 1368, they had also taken control of Guangdong. In July 1368, with the reinforcement of Yang Jing&#x27;s army from Huguang, Guangxi province was also occupied.

At the same time as the southern campaign, Zhu sent a 250,000-strong army, led by Xu Da and Chang Yuchun, to conquer the North China Plain. By March 1368, both land and naval forces had successfully captured Shandong. In May, Henan was also occupied. A pause was taken for agricultural work, during which the emperor met with his generals in the captured city of Kaifeng to confirm plans for the campaign. In mid-August, the Ming army resumed its march and reached Dadu (present-day Beijing) in early September. They defeated the Mongol army outside the city and then occupied it, while the Yuan emperor Toghon Temür fled north to Shangdu. The city was renamed Beiping (Pacified North) by the Chinese. The campaign then continued with an attack on Shanxi.
In January 1369, the main army, led by Xu Da, captured Taiyuan, while Köke Temür retreated to Gansu. In the spring of 1369, Ming troops also began to occupy Shaanxi. The province was fully taken by September 1369, but border skirmishes with Köke Temür&#x27;s troops persisted until 1370.

In 1370, the Ming government launched a two-pronged attack on Mongolia. Generals Li Wenzhong and Feng Sheng led an attack from Beijing to the north, while Xu Da attacked from Xi&#x27;an against Köke Temür. In early May 1370, Köke Temür was defeated and fled to Karakorum. The Ming forces captured over 84,000 of his troops and continued to advance westward along the Yellow River. At the same time, Li&#x27;s forces advanced to Shangdu, where the Yuan emperor Toghon Temür retreated further north to Yingchang and died in May 1370. His twenty-three-year-old son Ayushiridara then assumed the imperial title. In June, Li conquered Yingchang and Ajushiridara fled, but his empress and son Maidilibala were captured along with more than 50,000 soldiers. The Mongolian ruler continued to flee until reaching Karakorum, where the remnants of Köke&#x27;s army had also retreated.

After successfully defeating the Mongols, the Ming government shifted its focus to the Xia state in Sichuan. Despite maintaining positive relations with the Ming, the local regime refused to submit. In response, General Fu Youde was ordered to lead an attack from the north in 1371. Simultaneously, Tang He and Liao Yongzhong advanced with a fleet up the Yangtze River. Although they initially faced resistance, they were able to push forward with the help of artillery and the enemy&#x27;s decision to send part of their defenders north against the second army&#x27;s successful advance. By September 1371, Sichuan had been conquered. This victory ensured stability in the southwestern border for the next ten years, until the pro-Mongol Yunnan was conquered in 1381-1382.

In 1372, the emperor launched a massive attack on Mongolia, with Xu Da leading a 150,000-strong army from Shanxi through the Gobi to Karakorum. In the west, Feng Sheng was assigned to conquer the western part of the Gansu Corridor with 50,000 cavalrymen, while Li Wenzhong was tasked with attacking eastern Mongolia and Manchuria with another 50,000 soldiers. Although Feng Sheng&#x27;s forces were able to successfully complete their mission, the central and eastern armies were ultimately defeated by the Mongols.

These failures in 1372 shattered the Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s dream of becoming the heir to the entire Yuan Empire, both in China and on the steppe. Furthermore, Japanese piracy increased and rebellions broke out in the provinces of Guangxi, Huguang, Sichuan, and Shaanxi. As a result, the Chinese forces in the north shifted their focus to defense, and two years later, they returned the captured prince Maidilibala to Mongolia.

==1370s: State-building==

===Goals and law===

The Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s public statements were filled with sympathy for the peasants and a deep distrust of the wealthy landowners and scholars. He often referred to himself as a villager from the right bank of the Huai River. His difficult upbringing never left his mind, and even as emperor, he held onto the ideal of a self-sufficient village life in peace, a dream that was unattainable in his youth. He made every effort to make this dream a reality for his subjects.

The ultimate goal of the Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s reforms was to achieve political stability for the state. All policies, institutions, and the social and economic structure of society were designed to serve this purpose. The chaos and foreign rule that led to the establishment of a new dynasty only reinforced his determination to maintain order.

The emperor was meticulous in his efforts to establish a new society after the fall of the Yuan dynasty. He was a dynamic and innovative legislator, constantly issuing, revising, and modifying laws throughout his reign, but these frequent changes sometimes sparked protests from officials.

The emperor&#x27;s legislation focused on four main themes. The first was a broad desire to restore order and morality in society. The second was the regulation of the bureaucracy, including disciplining followers and managing the government. The third was the removal of corrupt and unreliable officials. Finally, the emperor also sought to resist the natural decline that comes with time. As the patriarch of the family, he aimed to prevent the decay of society and the dynasty in the future, as well as any changes to his laws.

The compilation of the new code, known as the &quot;Great Ming Code&quot;, began in 1364. This code, which was heavily influenced by Confucian principles, was largely based on the old &quot;Tang Code&quot; of 653. The initial wording was agreed upon in 1367, and the final version was adopted in 1397. It remained unchanged until the fall of the empire, although additional provisions were later added.

===Capital city===

The capital of the empire was Nanjing (Southern Capital), which was known as Yingtian until 1368. In the 1360s and 1370s, the capital underwent extensive construction. A workforce of 200,000 individuals surrounded the city with walls that were almost 26 km long, making them the longest in the world at the time. Additionally, an imperial palace and government quarter were built. In 1368, the emperor resided in Kaifeng during the months of June–August and October–November, leading to the city being known as Beijing (Northern Capital).

In 1369, the Hongwu Emperor proposed a debate on the relocation of the capital. In August, his suggestion to move the capital to Fengyang (then known as Linhuai), the emperor&#x27;s hometown in northern Anhui, on the south bank of the Huai River, approximately 100 km north of Nanjing, was approved. Construction of the future capital, named Zhongdu (; &#x27;Central Capital&#x27;), began with grand plans. The area had been largely abandoned since the famine of the 1340s, so landless families from the south were resettled in Fengyang. In 1375, the emperor ultimately abandoned the idea of relocating the capital and the construction was halted.

===Central government===

Upon ascending to the throne, the Hongwu Emperor appointed his wife as empress and his eldest son, Zhu Biao, as his heir. He surrounded himself with a group of military and civilian figures, but the civil officials never attained the same level of prestige and influence as the military. In 1367, he granted the title of duke (&quot;gong&quot;) to three of his closest collaborators—generals Xu Da and Chang Yuchun, and official Li Shanchang. After the establishment of the Ming dynasty, he also bestowed ranks and titles upon a wider circle of loyal generals. These military leaders were chosen based on their abilities, but their positions were often inherited by their sons. As a result, the generals became the dominant ruling class, surpassing the bureaucracy in power and influence. The officials had little political autonomy and simply carried out the emperor&#x27;s orders and requests. This system mirrored the one established during the Yuan dynasty, with the ruling class of Mongols and Semu being replaced by families of distinguished military commanders. These families were often connected through kinship ties with each other and with the imperial family.

The administrative structure of the Ming dynasty was modeled after the Yuan model. The civil administration was led by the Central Secretariat, headed by two Grand Councilors who were informally known as Prime Ministers. This Secretariat was responsible for six ministries: Personnel, Revenue, Rites, War, Justice, and (Public) Works. The Censorate oversaw the administration, while the Chief Military Commission was in charge of the army, but under later emperors, the civil administration, which was the core of the government, became primarily focused on supporting the army financially and logistically. Initially, the provinces were under the control of the general, with the civil authorities also reporting to them. In the 1370s, the military&#x27;s influence decreased as ministers were appointed to leadership positions in the provinces. Regional military commanders were then responsible for managing the affairs of hereditary soldiers in the &quot;Weisuo&quot; system.

In the 1370s, the &quot;Weisuo&quot; system, which was introduced in 1364, became stabilized. Soldiers under this system were obligated hereditarily to serve, with each family required to provide one member for military service in each generation. The army was self-sufficient thanks to the production of these hereditary soldiers. By 1393, the empire&#x27;s armed forces consisted of 326 guards and 65 battalions, but after 1368, the army may have been larger than necessary, as the government feared the consequences of widespread demobilization.

In order to limit the influence of eunuchs in the palace, the emperor initially restricted their number to 100, but he later allowed their number to increase to 400, with the condition that they were not allowed to learn to read, write, or interfere in politics.

The state administration was reformed based on Confucian principles. In February 1371, the emperor made the decision to hold provincial and county examinations every three years, with the provincial examinations already taking place in March, but in 1377, he had already cancelled the civil service examinations due to their lack of connection to the quality of the graduates. Despite his support for Confucianism, the emperor had a deep distrust for the official class and did not hesitate to severely punish them for any wrongdoing. After the resumption of examinations in 1384, he even went as far as executing the chief examiner when it was revealed that he had only awarded the &quot;jinshi&quot; degree to applicants from the south.

There were fewer than 8,000 civil servants, with half of them in lower grades (eighth and ninth), not including the approximately 5,000 teachers in government schools. Unlike later years in the early Ming period, there were not enough candidates obtained through examinations, and positions were often filled based on recommendations and personal connections. The bureaucratic system was still in its early stages, and the introduction of examinations primarily had symbolic significance as a declaration of allegiance to Confucianism.

Only qualified Confucian-educated officials held management positions in the state administration, while routine tasks and paperwork were handled by rank-and-file employees and helpers from the local population. In fact, there were at least four times more of these employees than officials.

Salaries for officials and incomes for members of the imperial family were approximately one-fifth of what they had been under previous dynasties. Even officials were paid in paper money or forced to accept paintings, calligraphy, or pepper as payment. Additionally, officials and officers, as well as their families and relatives, were prohibited from trading or lending money. This restriction posed a significant challenge for lower-level officials, as they often struggled to make a living, especially if they were serving far from their secure relatives.

===Local government and taxation===
The villages were self-governing communities that resolved internal disputes without interference from officials, as the Hongwu Emperor did not recommend their presence in the countryside. These communities operated based on Confucian morality rather than laws. 

A census was conducted to record the population listed in the Yellow Registers, while the land, its quality, taxation, and ownership were recorded in fish-cale registries (named after their appearance). Regional tax captains (&quot;liangzhang&quot;; ), who were appointed by county authorities from wealthy families, were responsible for collecting taxes. In 1371, the &quot;lijia&quot; system of local self-government was introduced in the Yangtze River basin and gradually expanded throughout the empire. Regular state expenses, except for land tax, were covered through mandatory services and supplies from the population. In the &quot;lijia&quot; system, one &quot;jia&quot; always provided services, and after a year, it was replaced by another. This form of taxation was progressive, unlike the land tax. Large infrastructure projects, such as road and dam construction or canals, were funded through additional &quot;ad hoc&quot; requisitions.

Taxes were low, with a fixed amount for each region, intended for peasants to pay 3% of their harvest. These taxes were often collected in kind, with the population responsible for delivering goods to state warehouses, but the transportation of these goods, often over long distances of hundreds of kilometers, placed a heavy burden on taxpayers. The cost of transporting grain to Nanjing was three to four times higher than its price, and even six to seven times higher for supplies to the army on the northern border. The Ministry of Revenue was responsible for collecting taxes and benefits from peasants, while the Ministry of Works oversaw artisans. Artisans were required to work in state factories for three months every 2 to 5 years, depending on their profession. The Ministry of War kept records of hereditary soldiers and also collected taxes and benefits from them. As state income and expenditure were managed through orders for the population to deliver specific goods to designated locations, large warehouses were not necessary. However, officials were not always able to effectively direct supplies to the necessary places, leading to local supply crises.

===Society===

The Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s guiding principle was one of parsimony and simplicity. The emperor aimed to restore a simple agricultural economy, with other industries being seen as complementary. In order to maintain social cohesion and preserve the economic foundations of the state, the consumption of the wealthy and privileged was restricted. This was done out of fear that excessive displays of wealth would have destructive effects on society. The privileged were expected to exercise self-restraint, with the justification for this being rooted in Confucian morality. Material interests and selfishness were actively rejected. The Hongwu Emperor himself set an example by contenting himself with simple food and palace furnishings. He viewed the pursuit of comfort, luxury, and property as unacceptable self-centeredness and a sign of corruption. Some of his specific orders included the planting of vegetable gardens instead of flower gardens in his sons&#x27; palaces, a ban on keeping pet animals (such as tigers), and calls to replace them with useful animals like cows. Additionally, the cultivation of rice varieties suitable for the production of rice wine was prohibited. The government also regulated consumption, setting specific levels for food, clothing, housing, and transportation for each class of the population. This resulted in strict regulation of the entire lives of the subjects, including attempts to enforce standards of greetings and the style of written texts, restrictions on people&#x27;s choice of names, and bans on the use of symbols that reminded people of a monastic episode in the emperor&#x27;s life.

The emperor believed that providing every man with a field and every woman with a loom would alleviate the hardships faced by the people, but this ideal was not reflected in reality as the wealthy held a disproportionate amount of land and often found ways to avoid paying taxes. In fact, during the last years of the Yuan dynasty, the land tax yield dropped to zero. In response, the Hongwu Emperor confiscated land from the wealthy and redistributed it to the landless. Those who had abandoned their properties during the wars were not entitled to have them returned, but were instead given replacement plots of land on the condition that they personally worked on them. Those who occupied more land than they could cultivate were punished and had their land confiscated. While the Song emperor Taizu encouraged large landowners and stated that the wealthy are the gateway to prosperity for the entire country, the Hongwu Emperor sought to eliminate the wealthy. As a result of his reforms, there were very few large landowners left.

After ascending to the throne, he resettled 14,300 wealthy families from Zhejiang and the Yingtian area from their estates to Nanjing. He also confiscated the vast properties of Buddhist monasteries, which during the Yuan dynasty owned 3/5 of the land in Shandong province. As a result, 3,000 Buddhist and Taoist monasteries were abolished, and 214,000 Buddhist and 300,000 Taoist monks and nuns were returned to secular life. Additionally, monasteries were limited to one with a maximum of two monks in each county. To address the issue of landlessness, free land was allocated to peasants. In the north, peasants received 15 &quot;mu&quot; per field and 2 per garden, while in the south, they received 16 &quot;mu&quot;. Hereditary soldiers were given 50 &quot;mu&quot;.

In contrast to the attitude towards the wealthy, care for the poor was significantly increased (and by the 16th century, considered standard). The government ordered the establishment of shelters for beggars in each county, and rations of rice, wood, and cloth were guaranteed for other poor individuals. Additionally, octogenarians and older individuals were guaranteed meat and wine. These expenses were covered by the &quot;lijia&quot; system, which required wealthy families to contribute or face property confiscation.

===Agriculture===

There were no arable lands available, so farmers who fertilized uncultivated land were exempted from taxes for three years. The government also encouraged refugees and people from densely populated areas to resettle on vacant land in the north, providing various reliefs to resettlers. To increase the labor force, slavery was abolished (only members of the imperial family were allowed to own slaves), the number of monks was reduced, and the buying and selling of free people, including the acceptance of women, children, and concubines as collateral, was prohibited. The slave trade was also banned.

In addition to reclaiming abandoned land, measures were taken to restore irrigation systems. the Hongwu Emperor ordered local authorities to report any requests or comments from the population regarding the repair or construction of irrigation structures to the court. In 1394, the emperor issued a special decree for the Ministry of Works to maintain canals and dams in case of drought or heavy rains. He also sent graduates from state schools and technical specialists to oversee flood protection structures throughout the country. By the winter of 1395, a total of 40,987 dams and drainage canals had been constructed across the country.

===Currency===

Inflation at the end of the Yuan era caused paper money to be abandoned in favor of grain as the primary medium of exchange. In 1361, the Hongwu Emperor began minting coins, but the small amount produced did not have a significant economic impact. Instead, it served as a symbol of political independence. In the 1360s, the government lacked the power to control the economy, so it allowed old coins to circulate and left price determination to the market.

After China was reunified, there were difficulties in circulating coins, according to officials, due to insufficient quantities. To address this issue, the government proposed reducing the copper content by one-tenth to increase the number of coins, but the emperor rejected this idea and since mining could not keep up with demand, the government returned to paper currency (banknotes) in 1375. This was intended to serve as the main medium of exchange, with copper coins playing a secondary role. Similar to the Yuan dynasty, the government attempted to promote paper money by prohibiting the use of precious metals or other commodities in trade, but unlike in Yuan times, paper money was not convertible into silver. As a result, its value rapidly declined. In an attempt to stabilize the currency, the government manipulated the money supply, alternating between halting printing and minting and printing at full capacity. but this only led to an excessive amount of money being printed. For example, in 1390, the government&#x27;s income was 20 million &quot;guan&quot; in banknotes, but its expenses were 95 million, which was even higher in reality. This resulted in the value of banknotes dropping to 40% of their nominal value by 1394, causing merchants to turn to silver instead. In response, the government attempted to withdraw copper coins and once again banned the use of silver in commerce in 1397, but merchants continued to use silver as the measure of value, while banknotes became the means of payment.

The anti-silver policy can be seen as an attempt to weaken the influence of the wealthy in Jiangnan, who were previously supporters of Zhang Shicheng (in addition to confiscation, high taxes, and relocation).The possession of silver was viewed as granting excessive independence to its owners in the eyes of the emperor. Therefore, it is understandable why the exchange of banknotes for silver was prohibited.

===Trade===
The emperor&#x27;s distrust of the bureaucratic elite was accompanied by a disdainful attitude towards merchants. He viewed weakening the influence of the merchant class and large landowners as a top priority for his government. As part of this effort, he implemented high taxes in and around Suzhou, which was then the commercial and economic hub of China. Additionally, thousands of wealthy families were forcibly relocated to Nanjing and the southern bank of the Yangtze River. To prevent unauthorized business, traveling merchants were required to report their names and cargo to local agents and undergo monthly inspections by the authorities. They were also obligated to store their goods in government warehouses.
Merchants were greatly affected by restrictions on population mobility. Any journeys longer than 100 &quot;li&quot; (58 km) were strictly prohibited without official permission. In order to obtain this permission, merchants were required to carry a travel document that contained their personal information such as name, place of residence, name of village head (&quot;lizhang&quot;; ), age, height, occupation, and names of family members. Any discrepancies or irregularities in this document could result in the merchant being sent back home and facing punishment.

Merchants were subjected to inspections by soldiers along the route, at a ferry terminal, in the steet and in their shops. Inns were required to report their guests to the authorities, providing details such as travel destinations and transported goods. Merchants were also required to store their goods in state warehouses and were not allowed to engage in trading without a license. Even when a license was obtained, authorities would inspect the goods, destination, and price. Intermediaries, or brokers, were strictly prohibited. The government also set fixed prices for most goods, and failure to comply with these prices resulted in punishment. In addition, merchants risked having their goods confiscated and being subjected to flogging for selling poor quality goods.

The Ming dynasty was one of the few dynasties that took the concept of four occupations (in descending order: officials, peasants, artisans, merchants) seriously and consistently. Unlike peasants, merchants were excluded from civil service examinations. This exclusion also extended to rank-and-file employees of the authorities who dealt with financial matters, as they were seen as potential sources of corruption. As a result, they were not allowed to take examinations that could elevate them to the official class. Despite the government&#x27;s efforts, the population&#x27;s interest in trade remained strong. Contemporary authors believed that this was due to the fact that a successful trade trip could yield more profit than a year&#x27;s worth of work in the fields.

===Foreign relations===
The emperor&#x27;s strict control over the economy and society created significant challenges in his relationships with foreign countries. The government viewed trade as a corrupting influence and therefore prohibited private foreign trade. Under the Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s reign, a sea ban policy was implemented, which involved strict regulation of foreign relations and trade. Chinese citizens were forbidden from leaving the empire, and harsh punishments were imposed on both foreigners who entered the country and those who engaged in trade with them, including death and exile for their families. Additionally, the construction of ships with two or more masts was banned, existing ones were destroyed, and ports were blocked with stones and logs. Foreign goods were also destroyed, and the coast was heavily guarded. The emperor&#x27;s ultimate goal was to prevent any foreign trade from taking place, as expressed in the phrase &quot;not even a piece of wood should sail across the sea&quot;, but this ban on private foreign trade, without providing viable alternatives, only resulted in an increase in smuggling. The government attempted to combat this through the use of force, border control, and punishments, but these measures proved ineffective. Eventually, the Yongle Emperor responded by promoting trade within the tribute system.

Foreign relations played a crucial role in establishing the legitimacy of Ming rule. The surrounding states expressed their recognition of Ming&#x27;s authority and superiority by paying tribute. As part of this tribute system, foreign delegations were given Chinese goods of equivalent value. This was a way for the Ming government to regulate and restrict foreign trade.

In 1368, the emperor announced his accession to Korea, Đại Việt (present-day northern Vietnam), Champa, and Japan. The following year, tribute missions were sent by Korea, Đại Việt, and Champa, and in 1370, by the Javanese Majapahit. In 1371, Japan, Siam, Cambodia, and the Sumatran Kingdom of Melayu also sent tribute missions, followed by Ryukyu in 1372. From 1369 to 1397, the most frequent missions came from Korea, Ryukyu, Champa, Siam, and Đại Việt (20 times, 19 times, 18 times, and 14 times, respectively). Specialized offices were established to receive these missions, located in Ningbo, Quanzhou (in Fujian), and Guangzhou starting in 1370. However, four years later, these offices were abolished, resulting in a significant decrease in tributary trade. Nonetheless, it remained substantial, with the Siamese mission bringing 38 tons of aromatic substances in 1392 and the Javanese mission bringing almost 17 tons of pepper in 1382.

Before embarking on any conquests abroad, the Hongwu Emperor made it a priority to stabilize the government in China. As a result, he refused to assist Champa in their war against Đại Việt and instead reprimanded the Viets for their aggression. In 1372, after facing defeats in Mongolia, he cautioned future emperors against the pursuit of conquering glory and advised them to focus on defending China against &quot;northern barbarians&quot;. The Ming government recognized the Southern Court in Japan as legitimate, while viewing the Kyoto government as usurpers, but they only resorted to harsh correspondence and never resorted to using force. This was likely due to the memory of the failed Mongol invasion, which the Japanese were quick to remind them of.

==Changes in the 1380s==

The decade of 1371–1380 was a period of consolidation and stability, but in 1380, the emperor initiated a new wave of reforms, taking direct and personal control, while also intensifying the terror against the elite.

===The emperor&#x27;s sons===
According to the emperor&#x27;s decision, his sons, who were given the titles of princes (&quot;wang&quot;), were assigned military command on the border to protect the empire. Along with receiving Confucian education, which emphasized moral values, the emperor&#x27;s sons also learned about warfare. The emperor placed great importance on the education of his sons and entrusted it to scholars led by Song Lian and Kong Keren ().

The decision to place his sons in charge of the army was made in order to diminish the influence of the military nobility on the state. The emperor was highly concerned about potential conspiracies among the generals, and, as seen in the cases of Hu Weiyong and Lan Yu, a number of generals were executed. The emperor&#x27;s fears were not unfounded, as the threat of conspiracies among the generals was always present. He himself came to power through the betrayal of the heirs of Guo Zixing and later faced conspiracies from his subordinates.

The most capable military leaders among the princes were Zhu Di and Zhu Gang, later joined by Zhu Fu, Zhu Zhen, Zhu Zhi, and Zhu Bai. Among the literary-minded imperial princes, Zhu Su stood out for his works on Yuan court poetry and medicinal plants, while Zhu Quan was known for his lyrical dramas and encyclopedias on alchemy and pharmacy. Other princes, such as Zhu Zi, Zhu Tan, Zhu Chun, and Zhu Bai, were also comfortable in the company of scholars and skilled in the art of war. However, not all princes behaved properly, as seen in the cases of Zhu Shuang, Zhu Su, Zhu Fu, Zhu Zi, Zhu Tan, Zhu Gui, and the emperor&#x27;s great-nephew Zhu Shouqian, who were often reprimanded by the emperor for their behavior.

In 1370, the emperor appointed nine oldest sons (after the heir to the throne) as princes. Five more were appointed in 1378, and the remaining ten in 1391. Once they reached around twenty years of age, they were sent to their designated regions, with the first being sent in 1378. As they settled into their regions, their importance grew. The most influential of these princes were the second, third, and fourth sons—Zhu Shuang, Zhu Gang, and Zhu Di—who were based in Xi&#x27;an, Taiyuan, and Beijing respectively. They were responsible for commanding the armies on the northern frontier. Other members of the imperial family were not involved in the administration of the country, as there was a fear of repeating the dynastic disputes that were common during the Yuan dynasty.

===Reforms of the central government===
The structure of the civil administration, organized according to the Yuan model, partially distanced the emperor from direct exercise of power and did not satisfy him. In the early 1380s, he proceeded with a radical reorganization of the administrative apparatus, with the primary goal of centralization and increasing the ruler&#x27;s personal power.

In 1380, Grand Chancellor Hu Weiyong was imprisoned and executed on suspicion of participating in a conspiracy against the emperor. As a result, his position and entire office (Central Secretariat) were abolished. Furthermore, the emperor forbade its restoration permanently. Six ministries were then placed directly under the emperor&#x27;s control. The Censorate was also temporarily abolished, and the unitary Chief Military Commission governing the armed forces was divided into five Chief Military Commissions, each controlling a portion of the troops in the capital and a fifth of the regions. Additionally, twelve guards of the Imperial Guard in the capital were directly subordinate to the emperor. One of these guards, known as the Embroidered Uniform Guard, acted as the secret police. This resulted in the fragmentation of state authority and the government, which immediately eliminated the possibility of a coup d&#x27;état but weakened the government&#x27;s long-term ability to act. 

After the major purge of 1380, smaller processes followed, targeting several ministers and deputy ministers, as well as the emperor&#x27;s nephew Li Wenzhong and hundreds of less prominent individuals. The executions sparked a wave of protests from officials, who pointed to the demoralization of the state apparatus and the waste of human resources. The emperor did not punish the critics, but he also did not change his policies.

===Domestic and foreign policy===

In 1381, the &quot;lijia&quot; system was implemented throughout the country, and the Yellow Registers were introduced to revise the population records. Additionally, a census was conducted. As part of this system, tax collection was transferred to the &quot;li&quot;, resulting in the abolishment of regional tax captains in 1382, but they were reinstated three years later. Regional tax captains collected taxes from the heads of the &quot;li&quot; and delivered to state granaries. The &quot;li&quot; were responsible for covering expenses related to transportation, accounting, and supervision.

The campaign against large landowners also targeted the new Ming officials. In 1380, land ownership of ministers and officials was reviewed, followed by a similar review in 1381 for holders of noble titles, including members of the imperial family. These individuals were required to return their acquired lands to the state and were compensated with rice and silk. This resulted in a long-lasting fragmentation of land ownership. Even two centuries later, He Liangjun (; 1506–1573) observed that there were no large landowners in Suzhou, and no one owned more than ten times the amount of land as a small peasant.

In 1382, the emperor suffered a significant loss when Empress Ma died. That same year, the newly appointed head of the Court of Judicature and Revision criticized the emperor&#x27;s support of Buddhist monks, their privileges at court, and their position in the government. As a result, the emperor limited their influence. At the same time, there was a growing support for Confucianism, leading to the opening of Confucius temples throughout the empire. These temples had previously been closed in 1369, with the exception of one in Confucius&#x27; birthplace. This shift towards Confucianism also resulted in the renewal of civil service examinations in 1384, with only required knowledge of the &quot;Four Books and Five Classics&quot;. The promotion of Confucianism strengthened the emphasis on moral considerations in the management of the state, rather than solely focusing on economic factors.

The 1380s saw a significant increase in foreign policy activity. In 1380 and 1381, the northern border troops launched large-scale expeditions beyond the Great Wall. In 1381, the Ming army, led by Fu Youde, quickly conquered Yunnan, but suppressing local uprisings kept Fu Youde&#x27;s soldiers occupied for several more years. Additionally, a significant number of troops were needed to guard the coast against smugglers and pirates, delaying the offensive in the north until 1387. The campaign into Manchuria in 1387 was ultimately successful, but the commanding general, Feng Sheng, was replaced by Lan Yu. In the 1388 campaign, Lan Yu&#x27;s army of 200,000 decisively defeated the Mongols at the Songhua River and Buir Lake. The Chinese captured 73,000 Mongol warriors, including the Mongol crown prince and his younger brother. Mongol khan Tögüs Temür fled, but was assassinated the following year, leading to disputes over succession among his people. As a reward, Lan Yu was granted the title of duke, and six of his generals were made marquises. The campaign also resulted in the annexation of the Liaodong Peninsula.

==1390s: Succession crisis and death==

From 1390 onwards, the armies sent north of the Great Wall were commanded by the emperor&#x27;s sons, particularly Zhu Di, but also Zhu Shuang, Zhu Gang, and Zhu Fu. During this time, there was also a new wave of arrests that began in the early 1390s. In the autumn of 1391, Crown Prince Zhu Biao went on an inspection trip to Shaanxi, where he was supposed to assess the possibility of moving the capital to Xi&#x27;an, but upon his return, he fell ill and died in 1392. This sudden death of the heir to the throne caused instability in the power system. In response, the emperor appointed Zhu Biao&#x27;s son, Zhu Yunwen, as the new crown prince. In order to ensure a smooth transition of power to the young heir, the Hongwu Empetor initiated a massive new wave of purges in 1393, starting with the accusation and execution of General Lan Yu. These purges were aimed at dismantling the military nobility.

During the thirty years of the Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s rule, approximately 100,000 people were killed in political purges. The most notable of these purges occurred in 1390, when arrests and executions extended to the entire ruling class. It seems that the emperor realized that the military hereditary elite was not a reliable source of support for the throne and made the decision to eliminate them. In an attempt to address the issue of extreme wealth disparities, many landowners and merchants were unjustly executed under the false accusation of being associated with treacherous politicians.

However, the power vacuum that resulted was not filled by civil officials, but primarily by the emperor&#x27;s sons. Similar to the generals before them, they alternated between serving on the border with the army and holding audiences in the capital. This helped to stabilize the empire during the Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s lifetime, but after his death, a crisis arose due to the loyalty of the generals and officials being directed towards the emperor as an individual rather than the office.

The Hongwu Emperor fell seriously ill in December 1397 and again from 24 May 1398. On 22 June, his condition worsened and he died on 24 June 1398, after thirty years of reign. He was buried in the Xiao Mausoleum, located on the southern side of Purple Mountain, east of Nanjing.

==Assessment==

In traditional Chinese historiography, the Hongwu Emperor was revered as a typical founder of a dynasty. He is credited with bringing China out of the chaos of civil war and freeing it from foreign rule. His unification of the country and restoration of order in society laid the groundwork for a prosperous and thriving era under the new dynasty. In recognition of his achievements, he was given the posthumous name Taizu, meaning &quot;Grand Progenitor&quot;, by his successor. This same perspective was reflected in the official history of the Ming dynasty, known as the &quot;History of Ming&quot;, which was written during the Qing dynasty.

Modern historians, influenced by a strong aversion towards the dictators of the 20th century, an anti-monarchist mindset, and a tendency to psychoanalyze personalities, often place a heavy emphasis on the despotic nature of his regime and attribute it to paranoia, or more generally, to some form of mental illness. They primarily view him as a dictator whose irrational actions and paranoia have resulted in the loss of countless lives.

However, a more objective approach would be to examine the emperor within the context of his time and personal experiences. This perspective highlights the impact of his life experiences on his goals and the methods he employed to achieve them. His impoverished and unstable upbringing is considered a crucial period in which he developed his personal philosophy.

The Hongwu Emperor is widely regarded as one of the most influential and remarkable rulers in Chinese history, regardless of which aspect of his life is emphasized. His reforms had a lasting impact on the Chinese state and society for centuries to come. In order to establish a well-ordered and virtuous society, he adopted Zhu Xi&#x27;s version of Neo-Confucianism as the state ideology, which greatly contributed to its widespread adoption. The implementation of the civil service examination system and the subsequent indoctrination of the nation&#x27;s elite had a profound influence on the country&#x27;s character. 

The abolition of the grand chancellor&#x27;s office, equivalent to today&#x27;s prime minister, and the reform of central administrative bodies resulted in the loss of a strong representative for officials. This led to a significant increase in the ruler&#x27;s power and marked a departure from the Song and Yuan empires, where the emperor&#x27;s authority was limited. Instead, it established a more despotic rule that continued through the Qing dynasty. Alternatively, some argue that the unification of the country under a centralized state with an all-powerful emperor during the Ming dynasty was the culmination of a long process that began with the Qin and Han dynasties.

<doc id="163031" wikidata="Q504172" url="?curid=163031" title="Battle of Guadalete">
<text>The Battle of Guadalete was the first major battle of the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, fought in 711 at an unidentified location in what is now southern Spain between the Visigoths under their king, Roderic, and the invading forces of the Umayyad Caliphate, composed mainly of Berbers and some Arabs under the commander Tariq ibn Ziyad. The battle was significant as the culmination of a series of Berber attacks and the beginning of al-Andalus. Roderic was killed in the battle, along with many members of the Visigothic nobility, opening the way for the capture of the Visigothic capital of Toledo.

==Sources==
The primary source for the battle is the &quot;Mozarabic Chronicle&quot;, which was written shortly after 754, probably in the vicinity of Toledo. The Latin &quot;Chronicle&quot; was written by a Mozarab Christian. The only other Latin Christian source written within a century of the battle is the &quot;Historia Langobardorum&quot; of Paul the Deacon. Paul was neither Visigothic nor Hispanic, but was writing probably in Montecassino between 787 and 796, where many Visigothic monks had taken refuge. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; of 741 is a near-contemporary Hispanic source, but it contains no original material pertaining to the battle. Several later Latin Christian sources contain descriptive accounts of the battle that have sometimes been trusted by historians, most notably the &quot;Chronicle of Alfonso III&quot;, written by Alfonso III of Asturias in the late ninth century. The high medieval accounts, such as that of Lucas de Tuy, are generally untrustworthy, containing much legend and invention.

Besides the Latin Christian sources are several Arabic-language sources, widely used by historians but increasingly coming under heavy criticism. None of them predates the mid-ninth century. The earliest, the &quot;Futūh Miṣr&quot; of Ibn ʿAbd al-Ḥakam (c.803–871), was composed in Egypt. This account, more rich in detail than the &quot;Mozarabic Chronicle&quot;, is at odds with not only the later Latin histories, but also the later Arabic ones: the anonymous compilation called the &quot;Akhbar Majmu&#x27;ah&quot;, the late tenth-century work of Ibn al-Qūṭiyya (&quot;the son [i.e. descendant] of the Goth [i.e. Wittiza]&quot;), the eleventh-century historian Ibn Hayyān, the thirteenth-century &quot;Complete History&quot; of Ibn al-Athir, the fourteenth-century history of Ibn Khaldūn, or the early modern work of al-Maqqarī. The &quot;Akhbar Majmu&#x27;ah&quot; in particular was upheld by Claudio Sánchez-Albornoz as a genuine eighth-century work surviving only in later copies, but this view has since been refuted. The French Orientalist Évariste Lévi-Provençal, on the other hand, advocated Ibn Hayyān as the supreme Muslim historian of the era (and of the battle).

Among modern Anglo-American historians, Roger Collins, R. A. Fletcher, E. A. Thompson, and Kenneth Baxter Wolf are sceptical of the Arabic sources and rely more on the &quot;Mozarabic Chronicle&quot;. Historians Thomas F. Glick and Bernard S. Bachrach are less sceptical. Collins in particular rejects a syncretistic approach incorporating information from all the available sources.

==Background==
Though the reign of Roderic is traditionally dated to 710–711, a literal reading of the &quot;Mozarabic Chronicle&quot; of 754 indicates 711–712. Roderic did not rule unopposed, however. The nature of his accession on the death of Wittiza from natural causes or through his assassination is not clear from the sources. It is possible that Roderic was probably the &quot;dux&quot; (duke) of Baetica before coming to the throne. Archaeological evidence and two surviving lists of kings show that one Achila II ruled in the northeast of the kingdom at this time, but his relationship to Roderic is unknown. Probably they were rivals who never actually came into open conflict, due to the shortness of Roderic&#x27;s reign and his preoccupation with Muslim raids. Even with Roderic&#x27;s sphere of influence (the southwest) and his capital Toledo, he was not unopposed after his &quot;usurpation&quot; (the &quot;Mozarabic Chronicle&quot; calls it an &quot;invasion&quot;).

The battle of Guadalete was not an isolated Berber attack but followed a series of raids across the Straits of Gibraltar from North Africa which had resulted in the sack of several south Iberian towns. Berber forces had probably been harassing the peninsula by sea since the conquest of Tangiers in 705–706. Some later Arabic and Christian sources present an earlier raid by a certain Ṭārif in 710 and one, the &quot;Ad Sebastianum&quot; recension of the &quot;Chronicle of Alfonso III&quot;, refers to an Arab attack incited by Erwig during the reign of Wamba (672–680). Two reasonably large armies may have been in the south for a year before the decisive battle was fought. These were led by Ṭāriq ibn Ziyad and others under the overall command of Mūsā ibn Nuṣayr. Most of the Arabic and Berber accounts agree that Ṭāriq was a Berber military leader from northern Africa. Ignacio Olagüe, in &quot;The Islamic Revolution in the West&quot;, argues that Ṭāriq was a Goth and the nominal governor of Tingitania. Others have argued that Ṭāriq was Jewish, Persian, or Turkic.

According to all sources, the earliest being Paul the Deacon, Ṭāriq left from Ceuta (Septem) and landed at the Rock of Calpe, the later Gibraltar, which Arabic sources derive from &quot;Jebel Tariq&quot;, &quot;Rock of Ṭāriq&quot;. A legend first recorded by al-Idrīsī has it that Ṭāriq burned his boats after landing to prevent his army from deserting. From Gibraltar he moved to conquer the region of Algeciras and then followed the Roman road that led to Seville. According to Ibn ʿAbd al-Ḥakam, writing around 860, Ṭāriq, commander of the Berber garrison of Tangiers, crossed the straits with ships supplied by a certain Count Julian (Arabic &quot;Ilyan&quot;), lord of Ceuta and &quot;Alchadra&quot; (Algeciras), and landed near Cartagena, which he captured and made his headquarters.

According to the &quot;Mozarabic Chronicle&quot;, Mūsā crossed the &quot;Gaditanum fretum&quot; (Strait of Cádiz) with a large force in 711 and remained in Hispania for fifteen months, but it is unclear from the sources if he came before or after the battle of Guadalete, which was fought by the forces of his subordinates. During his time in the peninsula it was racked by civil war (&quot;intestino furore confligeratur&quot;, &quot;internal frenzy&quot;, to the Mozarabic chronicler), cities were razed, and many people were slaughtered in the general destruction.

According to al-Maqqarī, Roderic was fighting the Basques when he was recalled to the south to deal with an invasion. There is also the record of a Byzantine attack on southern Iberia that was repulsed by Theudimer some years before the fall of the Visigothic kingdom. This has led to theories that the Berber attacks may have been related to the Byzantine operation, and that perhaps the Arabs were originally useful allies in a Byzantine attempt to reconquer the lost province of Spania.

The author of the late Asturian &quot;Chronica Prophetica&quot; (883) dates the first invasion of Spain to &quot;the Ides of November in the year 752 era&quot;, that is, 11 November 714. He also identified two invasions, the first by an Abu Zubra and the second, a year later, by Ṭāriq; probably he has divided the historical figure Ṭāriq ibn Ziyad into two persons.

==Date and place==
The date of the battle is traditionally 711, though this is not the date given by the &quot;Mozarabic Chronicle&quot;. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; dates it to 712 and places it before the conquest of Toledo, which it attributes to Mūsā in 711. If this discrepancy is solved by preferring the chronicler&#x27;s order to his dating, then the battle occurred in 712 and the fall of Toledo later that same year. Later Arabic accounts give an exact date of 25 or 26 July. A more rough dating is between 19 and 23 July. According to David Levering Lewis, the battle took place on 19 July 711. Preceding the battle was an entire week of inconclusive skirmishes near the lake La Janda, in the plain stretching from the Río Barbate to the Río Guadalete.

According to ʿAbd al-Ḥakam, Ṭāriq was marching from Cartagena to Córdoba—after defeating a Gothic army that tried to stop him—when he met Roderic in battle near &quot;Shedunya&quot;, probably modern Medina Sidonia. The later Arab accounts, most of them generating from al-Ḥakam&#x27;s, also place the battle near Medina Sidonia, &quot;near the lake&quot; or &quot;Wadilakka&quot; (river Lakka), often identified as the Guadalete river, La Janda lake, stream of &quot;Beca&quot;, or the Barbate river (that is, their associated valleys). The earliest Christian source, and the nearest source in time to the events, says that it took place near the unidentified &quot;Transductine promontories&quot; (&quot;Transductinis promonturiis&quot;). Thomas Hodgkin, probably following Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada, placed the battle at Jerez de la Frontera. Joaquín Vallvé, studying toponymy, puts the engagement on the banks of the Guadarranque, which he says might derive from &quot;Wad al-Rinq&quot; (Roderic&#x27;s river).

It has recently been argued that the battle took place in a field bordering the Almodóvar River, in Province of Cádiz.

==Clash==
The armies that met in battle on the day that decided the fate of the Gothic kingdom in Spain are not reliably described in the surviving records. Glick surmises that the Muslim army was predominantly Berber cavalry under Berber leadership. The Arabic sources traditionally give Roderic 100,000 troops, gathered during his return to the south after confronting the Basques. This number is outrageously high; it complements the figure of 187,000 for the Muslims provided by the &quot;Ad Sebastianum&quot; version of the &quot;Chronicle of Alfonso III&quot;. Ṭāriq is said to have landed with 7,000 horsemen and requested 5,000 more from Mūsā. There could thus have been as many as 12,000 Muslim fighters at the battle. One modern estimate, disregarding the primary source claims, suggest a quarter of the 7,500 reported in one of them; this would be approximately 2,000. The Visigothic forces were &quot;probably not much larger&quot;, and the Visigothic kingdom was, unlike Francia to its north, not organised for war. A small number of elite clans (perhaps around twenty five), their warrior followings, the king and his personal following, and the forces that could be raised from the royal fisc constituted the troops upon which Roderic could draw. 

The defeat of the Visigothic army followed on the flight of the king&#x27;s opponents, who had only accompanied the host &quot;in rivalry&quot;, &quot;deceitfully&quot;, and &quot;out of ambition to rule&quot; says the Mozarabic chronicler. The story of Sisibert abandoning Roderic with the right wing of the host is a legend. Estimating Visigothic forces at 33,000, David Lewis recounts how the Muslim army engaged in a series of violent hit and run attacks, while the Visigothic lines maneuvered &quot;en masse&quot;. A cavalry wing that had secretly pledged to rebel against Roderic stood aside, giving the enemy an opening. Ṭāriq&#x27;s cavalry, the &quot;mujaffafa&quot;, forming as much as a third of the total force and armored in coats of light mail and identifiable by a turban over a metal cap, exploited the opening and charged into the Visigothic infantry, soon followed by the infantry. The Christian army was routed and the king slain in the final hours of battle. The engagement was a bloodbath: Visigothic losses were extremely high, and the Muslims lost as many as 3,000 men, or a quarter of their force. 

It is possible that his enemies intended to abandon Roderic on the field, to be defeated and killed by the Muslims. Whatever the case, their plan failed, for they too were largely slain. By another text from the &quot;Mozarabic Chronicle&quot; the treachery can be placed at Roderic&#x27;s feet. He &quot;lost his kingdom together with his &quot;patria&quot; with the killing of his rivals&quot;. This unclear passage could indicate that Roderic had killed his rivals and weakened his army, ensuring defeat, or that his rivals too died in the battle or its retreat. The chronicler may be blaming the defeat on factionalism. The &quot;Chronicle of Alfonso III&quot;, in both its versions, blames the anonymous &quot;sons of Wittiza&quot; for conspiring against Roderic. Oppa, Wittiza&#x27;s historical brother, was found in Toledo, possibly as king-elect, by Mūsā when he took the city. This Oppa may have had a part to play in the opposition to Roderic, but certainly not his nephews, who would have been too young to participate in power politics in 711. The metropolitan of Toledo, Sindered, fled the city at the coming of the Muslims, and remained for the rest of his life an exile in Rome. The author of the &quot;Mozarabic Chronicle&quot; caustically notes that he was &quot;an hireling, and not the shepherd&quot; (quoting Jesus, &quot;Gospel of John&quot; 10:12). The Gothic nobleman Theudimer made an alliance with the conquerors to preserve his own rule of his territory. Within a decade all of the peninsula save the tiny Kingdom of Asturias and the mountain-dwelling Basques was under Muslims dominion and they had advanced beyond the Pyrenees as well.

==Cause of Muslim victory==
The later Arabic historians universally credit their religion for the victory. Al-Maqqarī, in &quot;The Breath of Perfumes&quot;, places in the mouth of Ṭāriq a morale-boosting address to his soldiers on the eve of battle, which closes with this exhortation to kill Roderic:
According to later traditions, Iberian Jews, progressively disenfranchised under the rule of Christian monarchs and bishops, provided fighters to augment the Moorish forces. Kaula al-Yahudi distinguished himself in the battle at the head of a mixed contingent of Jews and Berbers, according to the compiler of the &quot;Akhbar Majmu&#x27;ah&quot;. In the aftermath of victory, the Jews reputedly took several cities and were even commissioned to garrison Seville, Córdoba, and Toledo itself. Thompson remarks that &quot;whatever the reason for the [Goths&#x27;] persecution [of the Jews], it may have contributed to the utter destruction of those who initiated and enforced it.&quot; Despite all this, the participation of Jews on the side of the Muslims is not recorded in the &quot;Mozarabic Chronicle&quot;.

The traditional explanation for the rapid fall of the Visigothic kingdom has been decadence. The late ninth-century &quot;Chronica Prophetica&quot; indeed blames the Goths&#x27; defeat on their lack of penance for their sins: &quot;The city of Toledo, victor of all peoples, succumbed as a victim to the triumphant Ishmaelites, and deserved to be subjected to them. Thus Spain was ruined for its disgusting sins, in the 380th year of the Goths.&quot; This is not accepted by specialists today, though it still exerts heavy influence through tertiary accounts, especially in Spanish-language historiography.

==Legend==
Among the legends which have accrued to the history of the battle, the most prominent is that of Count Julian, who, in revenge for the impregnation of his daughter Florinda (the later &quot;Cava Rumía&quot; or &quot;Doña Cava&quot;) by Roderic while the young woman was being raised at the palace school, supposedly lent Ṭāriq the necessary ships to launch an invasion. That the Arabs already possessed sufficient naval forces in the western Mediterranean is attested by their activities against the Balearic Islands. While the impregnation (and the name of his daughter) are universally disregarded, the Count Julian of the Arabic histories has been identified with a Berber Catholic named Urban who appears in the &quot;Mozarabic Chronicle&quot;. This Urban accompanied Mūsā across the straits. Urban may be the Julian of legend, but more likely Julian is the legend of Urban. According to one interpretation of the Urban-Julian legend, he was a Byzantine governor of Ceuta who joined with the Arabs to raid the southern coasts of Iberia in 710 with Ṭārif. Glick has suggested that Ṭārif is an invention designed to explain the etymology of Tarifa, the ancient &quot;Julia Traducta&quot;, of which &quot;Julian&quot; was probably the (unnamed) Gothic count (&quot;comes julianus&quot;).

The &quot;sons of Wittiza&quot; that figure so prominently in later Christian sources, are likewise unhistorical. Wittiza, who is praised by the &quot;Mozarabic Chronicle&quot;, is almost universally vilified in subsequent works, beginning with the &quot;Chronicle of Moissac&quot; around 818. The outrageousness of the accusations is proportional to the chronological distance of the narrative. Thus, Lucas de Tuy, writing in the late thirteenth century, portrays a monster, while Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada, rectifying the disparate accounts, shows Wittiza commencing his reign with promise and evolving into a tyrant. The Monk of Silos around 1115 recorded that the sons of Wittiza fled from Roderic to Julian and enlisted his aid.

Among the other legends surrounding the battle is that of Roderic&#x27;s arrival at the field in a chariot drawn by eight white mules. 

There are other legends concerning the conquest, such as the legends of the sealed chamber in Toledo (&quot;la maison fermée de Tolède&quot;) and the table (or carpet, depending on the translation) of Solomon that ʿAbd al-Ḥakam alleges was also discovered in Toledo. There was indeed a table that was captured by Tariq ibn Ziyad from Almeida, and transported by Musa ibn Nusair to Damascus. Tariq broke one leg, and kept it, making a replacement leg for the table. When both Tariq and Musa reached the Caliph in Damascus (either Al-Walid, or Sulayman) each claimed that they were the one who captured it. Tariq showed the original leg as proof that he did, causing the Caliph to impose hefty fines on Musa. While several Muslim chroniclers say that it was indeed a table of Solomon, others refute this claim, and attribute it to lay people attributing fantastical objects and deeds to Solomon. These include Ibn Hayyan, the polymath Al-Biruni and Al-Himyari. All mention that it was made from endowments to churches by kings and wealthy 

Roderic&#x27;s golden sandal was allegedly recovered from the Guadalete river. The nineteenth-century American military history writer Henry Coppée penned a history of the conquest which incorporates and retells many of the legends.

<text>Dina Merrill (born Nedenia Marjorie Hutton; December 29, 1923 – May 22, 2017) was an American actress. She had more than a hundred film and television credits from the late 1950s until 2000s. She married three times.

==Early life==
Merrill was born in New York City on December 29, 1923, but for many years, her date of birth was given as December 9, 1925. She was the only child of Post Cereals heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post and her second husband, Wall Street stockbroker Edward Francis Hutton, founder of E. F. Hutton &amp; Co. Merrill had two older half-sisters, Adelaide Brevoort Close (July 26, 1908 – December 31, 1998) and Eleanor Post Hutton (December 3, 1909 – November 27, 2006), by her mother&#x27;s first marriage to Edward Bennett Close, grandfather of actress Glenn Close. Merrill was also first cousin—and first cousin once removed, respectively—to heiress Barbara Hutton and her son Lance Reventlow.

Merrill graduated from Miss Porter&#x27;s School, then attended George Washington University in Washington, DC for one term, but then enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City. She studied acting at HB Studio under Uta Hagen.

==Acting career==
On advice from her half-sister&#x27;s (then) husband, she adopted the stage name Dina Merrill, borrowing from Charles E. Merrill, a famous stockbroker like her father. Merrill made her debut on the stage in the play &quot;The Mermaid Singing&quot; in 1945.

During the late 1950s and 1960s, Merrill was believed to have been marketed as a replacement for Grace Kelly, and in 1959, she was proclaimed &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s new Grace Kelly&quot;.

Merrill&#x27;s film credits included &quot;Desk Set&quot; (1957), &quot;A Nice Little Bank That Should Be Robbed&quot; (1958), &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up the Ship&quot; (1959), &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot; (1959, with Cary Grant, who had been married to her cousin, Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton), &quot;The Sundowners&quot; (1960), &quot;Butterfield 8&quot; (1960), &quot;The Young Savages&quot; (1961), &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot; (1963), &quot;I&#x27;ll Take Sweden&quot; (1965), &quot;The Greatest&quot; (1977), &quot;A Wedding&quot; (1978), &quot;Just Tell Me What You Want&quot; (1980), &quot;Anna to the Infinite Power&quot; (1983), &quot;Twisted&quot; (1986), &quot;Caddyshack II&quot; (1988), &quot;Fear&quot; (1990), &quot;True Colors&quot; (1991), &quot;The Player&quot; (1992), &quot;Suture&quot; (1993), and &quot;Shade&quot; (2003). She also appeared in made-for-TV movies, such as &quot;Seven in Darkness&quot; (1969), &quot;The Lonely Profession&quot; (1969), &quot;Family Flight&quot; (1972), and &quot;The Tenth Month&quot; (1979).
Merrill appeared in numerous television series in the 1960s, such as playing the villain Calamity Jan in two 1968 episodes of &quot;Batman&quot; with then-husband Cliff Robertson. She also made guest appearances on two &quot;Bonanza&quot; episodes as Susannah Clauson, &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; episode &quot;Bonfire&quot; (1962), &quot;The Investigators&quot;, &quot;The Bold Ones&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot; (1964), &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;; &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;; &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;; &quot;Roseanne&quot;, and &quot;The Nanny&quot;, as Maxwell Sheffield&#x27;s disapproving and distant British mother. In 1971, Merrill appeared as Laura Duff in &quot;The Men from Shiloh&quot; (rebranded name for the TV Western &quot;The Virginian&quot;) in the episode titled &quot;The Angus Killer&quot;.

Her stage credits include the 1983 Broadway revival of the Rodgers and Hart musical &quot;On Your Toes&quot;, starring Russian prima ballerina Natalia Makarova. In 1991, she appeared in the rotating cast of the off-Broadway staged reading of &quot;Wit &amp; Wisdom&quot;.
In 1991, Merrill and her third husband Ted Hartley merged their company Pavilion Communications with RKO to form RKO Pictures, which owns the intellectual property of the RKO Radio Pictures movie studio.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Merrill was a recurring guest on several network television game and panel shows, including &quot;Match Game&quot;, &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot;, and &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;.

==Board memberships==
Merrill was a presidential appointee to the board of trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a trustee of the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center, and a vice president of the New York City Mission Society. In 1980, Merrill joined the board of directors of her father&#x27;s E. F. Hutton &amp; Co., continuing on the board and the compensation committee of Lehman Brothers when it acquired Hutton, for over 18 years.

==Personal life and death==

Merrill was married three times. In 1946, she wed Stanley M. Rumbough Jr., an heir to the Colgate-Palmolive toothpaste fortune and entrepreneur. They had three children, Nedenia Colgate Rumbough; David Post Rumbough; and Stanley Rumbough III, before divorcing in 1966. Later that year, she wed actor Cliff Robertson, with whom she had a daughter, Heather Robertson. The couple divorced in 1986.

In 1989, she married producer Ted Hartley, and they remained married until her death.

On May 22, 2017, Merrill died at her home in East Hampton, New York at age 93. She had been suffering from Lewy Body Dementia.

Two of Merrill&#x27;s four children predeceased her. David died in a boating accident a few weeks before his 24th birthday, and Heather died from ovarian cancer at the age of 38.

==Honors==
Merrill received the Women&#x27;s International Center (WIC) Living Legacy Award, in 1994, and a lifetime achievement award from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in April 2005.

<text>International draughts (also called international checkers or Polish draughts) is a strategy board game for two players, one of the variants of draughts. The gameboard comprises 10×10 squares in alternating dark and light colours, of which only the 50 dark squares are used. Each player has 20 pieces, light for one player and dark for the other, at opposite sides of the board. In conventional diagrams, the board is displayed with the light pieces at the bottom; in this orientation, the lower-left corner square must be dark.

==History==
According to Dutch draughts historian Arie van der Stoep, it is unknown where the 10×10 square draughts board first came into use. In the Netherlands, the board was probably used from 1550, and the number of pieces was extended to 2×20 between 1650 and 1700. The name &quot;Polish draughts&quot; was probably following a Dutch convention of the time that &quot;unnatural&quot; ideas were considered &quot;Polish&quot;.

==Rules==
The general rule is that all moves and captures are made diagonally. All references to squares refer to the dark squares only. The main differences from English draughts are: the size of the board (10×10), pieces can also capture backward (not only forward), the long-range moving and capturing capability of kings known as flying, and the requirement that the maximum number of men be captured whenever a player has capturing options.

===Starting position===
* The game is played on a board with 10×10 squares, alternatingly dark and light. The lower-leftmost square should be dark.
* Each player has 20 pieces. In the starting position (see illustration) the pieces are placed on the first four rows closest to the players. This leaves two central rows empty.

===Moves and captures===

* The player with the light pieces moves first. Then turns alternate.
* Ordinary pieces move one square diagonally forward to an unoccupied square.
* Enemy pieces can and must be captured by jumping over the enemy piece, two squares forward or backward to an unoccupied square immediately beyond. If a jump is possible it must be done, even if doing so incurs a disadvantage.
** Multiple successive jumps forward or backward in a single turn can and must be made if after each jump there is an unoccupied square immediately beyond the enemy piece. It is compulsory to jump over as many pieces as possible. One must play with the piece that can make the maximum number of captures.
** A jumped piece is removed from the board at the end of the turn. (So for a multi-jump move, jumped pieces are not removed during the move, they are removed only after the entire multi-jump move is complete.) 
** The same piece may not be jumped more than once.

===Crowning===
* A piece is &quot;crowned&quot; if it stops on the far edge of the board at the end of its turn. When it reaches the edge but have the opportunity to jump backwards, he must do so, and is not crowned. Another piece is placed on top of it to mark it. Crowned pieces, sometimes called &quot;kings&quot;, can move freely multiple steps in any direction and may jump over and hence capture an opponent piece some distance away and choose where to stop afterwards, but must still capture the maximum number of pieces possible.

===Winning and draws===
* A player with no valid move remaining loses. This occurs if the player has no pieces left, or if all the player&#x27;s pieces are obstructed from moving by opponent pieces.
* A game is a draw if neither opponent has the possibility to win the game.
* The game is considered a draw when the same position repeats itself for the third time (not necessarily consecutive), with the same player having the move each time.
* A king-versus-king endgame is automatically declared a draw, as is any other position proven to be a draw.

These are extra rules accommodated in some tournaments and may vary:
* If, during 25 moves, there were only king movements, without piece movements or jumps, the game is considered a draw.
* If there are only three kings, two kings and a piece, or a king and two pieces against a king, the game will be considered a draw after the two players have each played 16 turns.
* Before a proposal for a draw can be made, at least 40 moves must have been made by each player.

==Notation==

Each of the fifty dark squares has a number (1 through 50). Number 46 is at the left corner seen from the player with the light pieces. Number 5 is at the left corner seen from the player with the dark pieces.

==Sport==
The first world championship was held in international draughts in 1894. It was won by Frenchman Isidore Weiss, who held the title for eighteen years with seven world championship titles. Then, for nearly sixty years, the title was held by representatives from either France or the Netherlands, including Herman Hoogland, Stanislas Bizot, Marius Fabre, Ben Springer, Maurice Raichenbach, Pierre Ghestem, and Piet Roozenburg. In 1956, the hegemony of the French and the Dutch was broken: the champion was Canadian Marcel Deslauriers. In 1958, the USSR&#x27;s Iser Kuperman became the world champion, beginning the era of Soviet domination in international draughts, a feat which would mirror their domination at chess around this time.

The official status of the world championships are held under the auspices of the World Draughts Federation (FMJD) since 1948. In 1998, the first World Championship was held in the format of the blitz. The first Women&#x27;s World Championship was held in 1973. The first women&#x27;s champion was Elena Mikhailovskaya from the Soviet Union. A World Junior Championship has been contested since 1971; the first winner was Nicholay Mischansky.

In addition to the World Championships, there is also a European Championships since 1965 (men) and 2000 (women).

The World Draughts Federation maintains a ranking. , the men&#x27;s list is headed by Alexander Georgiev from Russia, and the women&#x27;s list is headed by Natalia Sadowska from Poland.

==Computers==
Computer draughts programs have been improving every year. First draughts programs were written in the mid-1970s. The first computer draughts tournament took place in 1987. In 1993, computer draughts program Truus ranked about 40th in the world. In 2003 computer draughts program Buggy beat world number 8 Samb. In 2005, the 10-time world champion and 2005 World champion, Alexei Chizhov, commented that he could not beat the computer, but he also would not lose to the computer. In 2010, the 9 piece endgame database was built.

===Schwarzman beat Maximus (2012)===
Alexander Schwarzman beat computer program Maximus on April 14, 2012. Schwarzman won game 2 in the 6-game match. The other 5 games were draws. Schwarzman was world champion in 1998, 2007, and 2009. Jan-Jaap van Horssen of the Netherlands wrote Maximus. Maximus used a six-piece endgame database. The computer was an Intel core i7-3930K at 3.2 GHz 32 gigabytes memory; it had six cores with hyperthreading. The average search depth was 24.5 ply. The average number of moves evaluated per second was 23,357,000. The average search time was 3 minutes and 52.98 seconds.

<doc id="163036" wikidata="Q381285" url="?curid=163036" title="Ralph Richardson">
<text>Sir Ralph David Richardson (19 December 1902 – 10 October 1983) was an English actor who, with John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier, was one of the trinity of male actors who dominated the British stage for much of the 20th century. He worked in films throughout most of his career, and played more than sixty cinema roles. From an artistic but not theatrical background, Richardson had no thought of a stage career until a production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; in Brighton inspired him to become an actor. He learned his craft in the 1920s with a touring company and later the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. In 1931 he joined the Old Vic, playing mostly Shakespearean roles. He led the company the following season, succeeding Gielgud, who had taught him much about stage technique. After he left the company, a series of leading roles took him to stardom in the West End and on Broadway.

In the 1940s, together with Olivier and John Burrell, Richardson was the co-director of the Old Vic company. There, his most celebrated roles included Peer Gynt and Falstaff. He and Olivier led the company to Europe and Broadway in 1945 and 1946, before their success provoked resentment among the governing board of the Old Vic, leading to their dismissal from the company in 1947. In the 1950s, in the West End and occasionally on tour, Richardson played in modern and classic works including &quot;The Heiress&quot;, &quot;Home at Seven&quot;, and &quot;Three Sisters&quot;. He continued on stage and in films until shortly before his sudden death at the age of eighty. He was celebrated in later years for his work with Peter Hall&#x27;s National Theatre and his frequent stage partnership with Gielgud. He was not known for his portrayal of the great tragic roles in the classics, preferring character parts in old and new plays.

Richardson&#x27;s film career began as an extra in 1931. He was soon cast in leading roles in British and American films including &quot;Things to Come&quot; (1936), &quot;The Fallen Idol&quot; (1948), &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot; (1962) and &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1965). He received nominations and awards in the UK, Europe and the US for his stage and screen work from 1948 until his death. Richardson was twice nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, first for &quot;The Heiress&quot; (1949) and again (posthumously) for his final film, &quot;&quot; (1984).

Throughout his career, and increasingly in later years, Richardson was known for his eccentric behaviour on and off stage. He was often seen as detached from conventional ways of looking at the world, and his acting was regularly described as poetic or magical.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Richardson was born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, the third son and youngest child of Arthur Richardson and his wife Lydia () on 19 December 1902. The couple had met while both were in Paris, studying with the painter William-Adolphe Bouguereau. Arthur Richardson had been senior art master at Cheltenham Ladies&#x27; College from 1893.

In 1907 the family split up; there was no divorce or formal separation, but the two elder boys, Christopher and Ambrose, remained with their father and Lydia left them, taking Ralph with her. The ostensible cause of the couple&#x27;s separation was a row over Lydia&#x27;s choice of wallpaper for her husband&#x27;s study. According to John Miller&#x27;s biography, whatever underlying causes there may have been are unknown. An earlier biographer, Garry O&#x27;Connor, speculates that Arthur Richardson might have been having an extramarital affair. There does not seem to have been a religious element, although Arthur was a dedicated Quaker, whose first two sons were brought up in that faith, whereas Lydia was a devout convert to Roman Catholicism, in which she raised Ralph. Mother and son had a variety of homes, the first of which was a bungalow converted from two railway carriages in Shoreham-by-Sea on the south coast of England.

Lydia wanted Richardson to become a priest. In Brighton he served as an altar boy, which he enjoyed, but when sent at about fifteen to the nearby Xaverian College, a seminary for trainee priests, he ran away. As a pupil at a series of schools he was uninterested in most subjects and was an indifferent scholar. His Latin was poor, and during church services he would improvise parts of the Latin responses, developing a talent for invention when memory failed that proved useful in his later career.
In 1919, aged sixteen, Richardson took a post as office boy with the Brighton branch of the Liverpool Victoria insurance company. The pay, ten shillings a week, was attractive, but office life was not; he lacked concentration, frequently posting documents to the wrong people as well as engaging in pranks that alarmed his superiors. His paternal grandmother died and left him £500, which, he later said, transformed his life. He resigned from the office post, just in time to avoid being dismissed, and enrolled at the Brighton School of Art. His studies there convinced him that he lacked creativity, and that his drawing skills were not good enough.

Richardson left the art school in 1920, and considered how else he might make a career. He briefly thought of pharmacy and then of journalism, abandoning each when he learned how much study the former required and how difficult mastering shorthand for the latter would be. He was still unsure what to do, when he saw Sir Frank Benson as Hamlet in a touring production. He was thrilled, and felt at once that he must become an actor.

Buttressed by what was left of the legacy from his grandmother, Richardson determined to learn to act. He paid a local theatrical manager, Frank R. Growcott, ten shillings a week to take him as a member of his company and to teach him the craft of an actor. He made his stage debut in December 1920 with Growcott&#x27;s St Nicholas Players at the St Nicholas Hall, Brighton, a converted bacon factory. He played a gendarme in an adaptation of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; and was soon entrusted with larger parts, including Banquo in &quot;Macbeth&quot; and Malvolio in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;.

===Early career===

The heyday of the touring actor-manager was nearing its end but some companies still flourished. As well as Benson&#x27;s, there were those of Sir John Martin-Harvey, Ben Greet, and, only slightly less prestigious, Charles Doran. Richardson wrote to all four managers: the first two did not reply; Greet saw him but had no vacancy; Doran engaged him, at a wage of £3 a week. Richardson made his first appearance as a professional actor at the Marina Theatre, Lowestoft, in August 1921, as Lorenzo in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. He remained with Doran&#x27;s company for most of the next two years, gradually gaining more important roles, including Banquo in &quot;Macbeth&quot; and Mark Antony in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;.

Doran&#x27;s company specialised in the classics, principally Shakespeare. After two years of period costumes Richardson felt the urge to act in a modern work. He left Doran in 1923 and toured in a new play, &quot;Outward Bound&quot; by Sutton Vane. He returned to the classics in August 1924, in Nigel Playfair&#x27;s touring production of &quot;The Way of the World&quot;, playing Fainall. While on that tour he married Muriel Hewitt, a young member of Doran&#x27;s company, known to him as &quot;Kit&quot;. To his great happiness, the two were able to work together for most of 1925, both being engaged by Sir Barry Jackson of the Birmingham Repertory Theatre for a touring production of &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Wife&quot;. From December of that year they were members of the main repertory company in Birmingham. Through Jackson&#x27;s chief director, the veteran taskmaster H. K. Ayliff, Richardson &quot;absorbed the influence of older contemporaries like Gerald du Maurier, Charles Hawtrey and Mrs Patrick Campbell.&quot; Hewitt was seen as a rising star but Richardson&#x27;s talents were not yet so apparent; he was allotted supporting roles such as Lane in &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; and Albert Prossor in &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot;.

Richardson made his London debut in July 1926 as the stranger in &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot; in a Sunday-night performance at the Scala Theatre, with a cast including Percy Walsh, John Laurie and D. A. Clarke-Smith. He then toured for three months in Eden Phillpotts&#x27;s comedy &quot;Devonshire Cream&quot; with Jackson&#x27;s company led by Cedric Hardwicke.

When Phillpotts&#x27;s next comedy, &quot;Yellow Sands&quot;, was to be mounted at the Haymarket Theatre in the West End, Richardson and his wife were both cast in good roles. The play opened in November 1926 and ran until September 1928; with 610 performances it was the longest London run of Richardson&#x27;s entire career. During the run Muriel Hewitt began to show early symptoms of encephalitis lethargica, a progressive and ultimately fatal illness.
Richardson left the run of &quot;Yellow Sands&quot; in March 1928 and rejoined Ayliff, playing Pygmalion in &quot;Back to Methuselah&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre; also in the cast was a former colleague from the Birmingham Repertory, Laurence Olivier. The critics began to notice Richardson and he gained some favourable reviews. As Tranio in Ayliff&#x27;s modern-dress production of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, Richardson played the character as a breezy cockney, winning praise for turning a usually dreary role into something richly entertaining. For the rest of 1928 he appeared in what Miller describes as several unremarkable modern plays. For much of 1929 he toured South Africa in Gerald Lawrence&#x27;s company in three period costume plays, including &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;, in which he played Joseph Surface. The sole venture into musical comedy of his career was in &quot;Silver Wings&quot; in the West End and on tour. It was not a personal triumph; the director&#x27;s final injunction to the company was, &quot;For God&#x27;s sake don&#x27;t let Richardson sing&quot;. In May 1930 Richardson was given the role of Roderigo in &quot;Othello&quot; in what seemed likely to be a prestigious production, with Paul Robeson in the title role. The biographer Ronald Hayman writes that though a fine singer, &quot;Robeson had no ear for blank verse&quot; and even Peggy Ashcroft&#x27;s superb performance as Desdemona was not enough to save the production from failure. Ashcroft&#x27;s notices were laudatory, while Richardson&#x27;s were mixed; they admired each other and worked together frequently during the next four decades.

In 1930 Richardson, with some misgivings, accepted an invitation to join The Old Vic company. The theatre, in an unfashionable location south of the Thames, had offered inexpensive tickets for opera and drama under its proprietor Lilian Baylis since 1912. Its profile had been raised considerably by Baylis&#x27;s producer, Harcourt Williams, who in 1929 persuaded the young West End star John Gielgud to lead the drama company. For the following season Williams wanted Richardson to join, with a view to succeeding Gielgud from 1931 to 1932. Richardson agreed, though he was not sure of his own suitability for a mainly Shakespearean repertoire, and was not enthusiastic about working with Gielgud: &quot;I found his clothes extravagant, I found his conversation flippant. He was the New Young Man of his time and I didn&#x27;t like him.&quot;

The first production of the season was &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, with Gielgud as Hotspur and Richardson as Prince Hal; the latter was thought by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; &quot;vivacious, but a figure of modern comedy rather than Shakespeare.&quot; Richardson&#x27;s notices, and the relationship of the two leading men, improved markedly when Gielgud, who was playing Prospero, helped Richardson with his performance as Caliban in &quot;The Tempest&quot;:

The friendship and professional association lasted until the end of Richardson&#x27;s life. Gielgud wrote in 1983, &quot;Besides cherishing our long years of work together in the theatre, where he was such an inspiring and generous partner, I grew to love him in private life as a great gentleman, a rare spirit, fair and balanced, devotedly loyal and tolerant and, as a companion, bursting with vitality, curiosity and humour.&quot; Among Richardson&#x27;s other parts in his first Old Vic season, Enobarbus in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; gained particularly good notices. &quot;The Morning Post&quot; commented that it placed him in the first rank of Shakespearean actors. At the beginning of 1931 Baylis re-opened Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre with a production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; starring Gielgud as Malvolio and Richardson as Sir Toby Belch. W. A. Darlington in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote of Richardson&#x27;s &quot;ripe, rich and mellow Sir Toby, [which] I would go many miles to see again.&quot;

During the summer break between the Old Vic 1930–31 and 1931–32 seasons, Richardson played at the Malvern Festival, under the direction of his old Birmingham director, Ayliff. Salaries at the Old Vic and the Festival were not large, and Richardson was glad of a job as an extra in the 1931 film &quot;Dreyfus&quot;. As his wife&#x27;s condition worsened he needed to pay for more and more nursing; she was looked after in a succession of hospitals and care homes.

Succeeding Gielgud as leading man at the Old Vic, Richardson had a varied season, in which there were conspicuous successes interspersed with critical failures. James Agate was not convinced by him as the domineering Petruchio in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;; in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; the whole cast received tepid reviews. In &quot;Othello&quot; Richardson divided the critics. He emphasised the plausible charm of the murderous Iago to a degree that Agate thought &quot;very good Richardson, but indifferent Shakespeare&quot;, whereas &quot;The Times&quot; said, &quot;He never stalked or hissed like a plain villain, and, in fact, we have seldom seen a man smile and smile and be a villain so adequately.&quot; His biggest success of the season was as Bottom in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Both Agate and Darlington commented on how the actor transformed the character from the bumbling workman to the magically changed creature on whom Titania dotes. Agate wrote that most of those who had played the part hitherto &quot;seem to have thought Bottom, with the ass&#x27;s head on, was the same Bottom, only funnier. Shakespeare says he was &#x27;translated&#x27;, and Mr Richardson translated him.&quot; With Sybil Thorndike as a guest star and Richardson as Ralph, &quot;The Knight of the Burning Pestle&quot; was a hit with audiences and critics, as was a revival of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, with Edith Evans as Viola and Richardson again playing Sir Toby, finishing the season to renewed praise.

===West End and Broadway===

Richardson returned to the Malvern Festival in August 1932. He was in four plays, the last of which, Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Too True to Be Good&quot;, transferred to the New Theatre in London the following month. The play was not liked by audiences and ran for only forty-seven performances, but Richardson, in Agate&#x27;s phrase, &quot;ran away with the piece&quot;, and established himself as a West End star. In 1933 he had his first speaking part in a film, playing the villain, Nigel Hartley, in &quot;The Ghoul&quot;, which starred Cedric Hardwicke and Boris Karloff. The following year he was cast in his first starring role in a film, as the hero in &quot;The Return of Bulldog Drummond&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; commented, &quot;Mr Ralph Richardson makes Drummond as brave and stupid on the screen as he is in print.&quot;

Over the next two years Richardson appeared in six plays in London ranging from &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (as Mr Darling and Captain Hook) to &quot;Cornelius&quot;, an allegorical play written for and dedicated to him by J.B.Priestley. &quot;Cornelius&quot; ran for two months; this was less than expected, and left Richardson with a gap in engagements in the second half of 1935. He filled it by accepting an invitation from Katharine Cornell and Guthrie McClintic to play Mercutio in their production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; on a US tour and on Broadway. Romeo was played by Maurice Evans and Juliet by Cornell. Richardson&#x27;s performance greatly impressed American critics, and Cornell invited him to return to New York to co-star with her in &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, though nothing came of this.

In 1936, London Films released &quot;Things to Come&quot;, in which Richardson played the swaggering warlord &quot;The Boss&quot;. His performance parodied the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini so effectively that the film was immediately banned in Italy. The producer was Alexander Korda; the two men formed a long and mutually beneficial friendship. Richardson later said of Korda, &quot;Though not so very much older than I am, I regarded him in a way as a father, and to me he was as generous as a prince.&quot; In May 1936 Richardson and Olivier jointly directed and starred in a new piece by Priestley, &quot;Bees on the Boatdeck&quot;. Both actors won excellent notices, but the play, an allegory of Britain&#x27;s decline, did not attract the public. It closed after four weeks, the last in a succession of West End productions in which Richardson appeared to much acclaim but which were box-office failures. In August of the same year he finally had a long-running star part, the title role in Barré Lyndon&#x27;s comedy thriller, &quot;The Amazing Dr Clitterhouse&quot;, which played for 492 performances, closing in October 1937.

After a short run in &quot;The Silent Knight&quot;, described by Miller as &quot;a Hungarian fantasy in rhymed verse set in the fifteenth century&quot;, Richardson returned to the Old Vic for the 1937–38 season, playing Bottom once again and switching parts in &quot;Othello&quot;, playing the title role, with Olivier as Iago. The director, Tyrone Guthrie, wanted to experiment with the theory that Iago&#x27;s villainy is driven by suppressed homosexual love for Othello. Olivier was willing to co-operate, but Richardson was not; audiences and most critics failed to spot the supposed motivation of Olivier&#x27;s Iago, and Richardson&#x27;s Othello seemed underpowered. O&#x27;Connor believes that Richardson did not succeed with Othello or Macbeth because of the characters&#x27; single-minded &quot;blind driving passion – too extreme, too inhuman&quot;, which was incomprehensible and alien to him. It was for the same reason, in O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s view, that he never attempted the title roles in &quot;Hamlet&quot; or &quot;King Lear&quot;.

Richardson made his television debut in January 1939, reprising his 1936 stage role of the chief engineer in &quot;Bees on the Boatdeck&quot;. His last stage part in the 1930s was Robert Johnson, an Everyman figure, in Priestley&#x27;s &quot;Johnson Over Jordan&quot; directed by Basil Dean. It was an experimental piece, using music (by Benjamin Britten) and dance as well as dialogue, and was another production in which Richardson was widely praised but that did not prosper at the box-office. After it closed, in May 1939, he did not act on stage for more than five years.

====Second World War====
At the outbreak of war Richardson joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as a sub-lieutenant pilot. He had taken flying lessons during the 1930s and had logged 200 hours of flying time, but, though a notoriously reckless driver, he admitted to being a timid pilot. He counted himself lucky to have been accepted, but the Fleet Air Arm was short of pilots. He rose to the rank of lieutenant-commander. His work was mostly routine administration, probably because of &quot;the large number of planes which seemed to fall to pieces under his control&quot;, through which he acquired the nickname &quot;Pranger&quot; Richardson. He served at several bases in the south of England, and in April 1941, at the Royal Naval Air Station, Lee-on-Solent, he was able to welcome Olivier, newly commissioned as a temporary sub-lieutenant. Olivier rapidly eclipsed Richardson&#x27;s record for pranging.

In 1942, on his way to visit his wife at the cottage where she was cared for by a devoted couple, Richardson crashed his motor-bike and was in hospital for several weeks. Kit was at that point mobile enough to visit him, but later in the year her condition worsened and in October she died. He was intensely lonely, though the camaraderie of naval life was some comfort. In 1944 he married again. His second wife was the actress Meriel Forbes, a member of the Forbes-Robertson theatrical family. The marriage brought him lifelong happiness and a son, Charles (1945–98), who became a television stage manager.

During the war Richardson compered occasional morale-boosting shows at the Royal Albert Hall and elsewhere, and made one short film and three full-length ones, including &quot;The Silver Fleet&quot;, in which he played a Dutch Resistance hero, and &quot;The Volunteer&quot;, a propaganda film in which he appeared as himself.

Throughout the war Guthrie had striven to keep the Old Vic company going, even after German bombing in 1942 left the theatre a near-ruin. A small troupe toured the provinces, with Sybil Thorndike at its head. By 1944, with the tide of the war turning, Guthrie felt it time to re-establish the company in a London base, and invited Richardson to head it. Richardson made two stipulations: first, as he was unwilling to seek his own release from the forces, the governing board of the Old Vic should explain to the authorities why it should be granted; secondly, that he should share the acting and management in a triumvirate. Initially he proposed Gielgud and Olivier as his colleagues, but the former declined, saying, &quot;It would be a disaster, you would have to spend your whole time as referee between Larry and me.&quot; It was finally agreed that the third member would be the stage director John Burrell. The Old Vic governors approached the Royal Navy to secure the release of Richardson and Olivier; the Sea Lords consented, with, as Olivier put it, &quot;a speediness and lack of reluctance which was positively hurtful.&quot;

===Old Vic, 1944–47===

The triumvirate secured the New Theatre for their first season and recruited a company. Thorndike was joined by, among others, Harcourt Williams, Joyce Redman and Margaret Leighton. It was agreed to open with a repertory of four plays: &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;, &quot;Richard III&quot; and &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;. Richardson&#x27;s roles were Peer, Bluntschli, Richmond and Vanya; Olivier played the Button Moulder, Sergius, Richard and Astrov. The first three productions met with acclaim from reviewers and audiences; &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; had a mixed reception. &quot;The Times&quot; thought Olivier&#x27;s Astrov &quot;a most distinguished portrait&quot; and Richardson&#x27;s Vanya &quot;the perfect compound of absurdity and pathos&quot;. Agate, on the other hand, commented, Floored for life, sir, and jolly miserable&#x27; is what &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; takes three acts to say. And I just cannot believe in Mr Richardson wallowing in misery: his voice is the wrong colour.&quot; In 1945 the company toured Germany, where they were seen by many thousands of Allied servicemen; they also appeared at the Comédie-Française theatre in Paris, the first foreign company to be given that honour. The critic Harold Hobson wrote that Richardson and Olivier quickly &quot;made the Old Vic the most famous theatre in the Anglo-Saxon world.&quot;
The second season, in 1945, featured two double-bills. The first consisted of &quot;Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2&quot;. Olivier played the warrior Hotspur in the first and the doddering Justice Shallow in the second. He received good notices, but by general consent the production belonged to Richardson as Falstaff. Agate wrote, &quot;He had everything the part wants – the exuberance, the mischief, the gusto... Here is something better than virtuosity in character-acting – the spirit of the part shining through the actor.&quot; As a teenager, the director Peter Hall saw the production; he said fifty years later, &quot;Of the performances I&#x27;ve seen in my life I&#x27;m gladdest I saw that.&quot; In the second double bill it was Olivier who dominated, in the title roles of &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; and &quot;The Critic&quot;. Richardson took the supporting role of Tiresias in the first, and the silent, cameo part of Lord Burleigh in the second. After the London season the company played both the double-bills and &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; in a six-week season on Broadway.

The third, and final, season under the triumvirate was in 1946–47. Olivier played King Lear, and Richardson, Cyrano de Bergerac. Olivier would have preferred the roles to be cast the other way about, but Richardson did not wish to attempt Lear. Richardson&#x27;s other roles in the season were Inspector Goole in &quot;An Inspector Calls&quot;, Face in &quot;The Alchemist&quot; and John of Gaunt in &quot;Richard II&quot;, which he directed, with Alec Guinness in the title role.

During the run of &quot;Cyrano&quot;, Richardson was knighted in the 1947 New Year Honours, to Olivier&#x27;s undisguised envy. The younger man received the accolade six months later, by which time the days of the triumvirate were numbered. The high profile of the two star actors did not endear them to the new chairman of the Old Vic governors, Lord Esher. He had ambitions to be the first head of the National Theatre and had no intention of letting actors run it. He was encouraged by Guthrie, who, having instigated the appointment of Richardson and Olivier, had come to resent their knighthoods and international fame. Esher terminated their contracts while both were out of the country, and they and Burrell were said to have &quot;resigned&quot;.

Looking back in 1971, Bernard Levin wrote that the Old Vic company of 1944 to 1947 &quot;was probably the most illustrious that has ever been assembled in this country&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; said that the triumvirate&#x27;s years were the greatest in the Old Vic&#x27;s history; as &quot;The Guardian&quot; put it, &quot;the governors summarily sacked them in the interests of a more mediocre company spirit&quot;.

===International fame===

For Richardson, parting company with the Old Vic brought the advantage of being free, for the first time, to earn substantial pay. The company&#x27;s highest salary had been £40 a week. After his final Old Vic season he made two films in quick succession for Korda. The first, &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;, with Vivien Leigh, was an expensive failure, although Richardson&#x27;s notices in the role of Karenin were excellent. The second, &quot;The Fallen Idol&quot;, had notable commercial and critical success, and won awards in Europe and America. It remained one of Richardson&#x27;s favourites of his films. In Miller&#x27;s words, &quot;Carol Reed&#x27;s sensitive direction drew faultless performances not just from Ralph as Baines (the butler and mistakenly suspected murderer), but also from Michèle Morgan as his mistress, Sonia Dresdel as his cold-hearted wife, and especially from Bobby Henrey as the distraught boy, Philippe.&quot;

Richardson had gained a national reputation as a great actor while at the Old Vic; films gave him the opportunity to reach an international audience. Unlike some of his theatre colleagues, he was never condescending about film work. He admitted that film could be &quot;a cage for an actor, but a cage in which they sometimes put a little gold&quot;, but he did not regard filming as merely a means of subsidising his much less profitable stage work. He said, &quot;I&#x27;ve never been one of those chaps who scoff at films. I think they&#x27;re a marvellous medium, and are to the stage what engravings are to painting. The theatre may give you big chances, but the cinema teaches you the details of craftsmanship.&quot; &quot;The Fallen Idol&quot; was followed by Richardson&#x27;s first Hollywood part. He played Dr Sloper, the overprotective father of Olivia de Havilland in &quot;The Heiress&quot;, based on Henry James&#x27;s novel &quot;Washington Square&quot;. The film did not prosper at the box-office despite good reviews, an Academy Award for Best Actress for Havilland, and nominations for the director (William Wyler) and Richardson.
&quot;The Heiress&quot; had been a Broadway play before it was a film. Richardson so liked his part that he decided to play it in the West End, with Ashcroft as Sloper&#x27;s daughter Catherine. The piece was to open in February 1949 at Richardson&#x27;s favourite theatre, the Haymarket. Rehearsals were chaotic. Burrell, whom Richardson had asked to direct, was not up to the task – possibly, Miller speculates, because of nervous exhaustion from the recent traumas at the Old Vic. With only a week to go before the first performance, the producer, Binkie Beaumont, asked him to stand down, and Gielgud was recruited in his place. Matters improved astonishingly; the production was a complete success and ran in London for 644 performances.

After one long run in &quot;The Heiress&quot;, Richardson appeared in another, R.C.Sherriff&#x27;s &quot;Home at Seven&quot;, in 1950. He played an amnesiac bank clerk who fears he may have committed murder. He later recreated the part in a radio broadcast, and in a film version, which was his sole venture into direction for the screen. Once he had played himself into a role in a long run, Richardson felt able to work during the daytime in films, and made two others in the early 1950s beside the film of the Sherriff piece: &quot;Outcast of the Islands&quot;, directed by Carol Reed, and David Lean&#x27;s &quot;The Sound Barrier&quot;, released in 1951 and 1952 respectively. For the latter he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor. With his characteristic liking for switching between modern roles and the classics, his next stage part was Colonel Vershinin in &quot;Three Sisters&quot; in 1951. He headed a strong cast, with Renée Asherson, Margaret Leighton and Celia Johnson as the sisters, but reviewers found the production weakly directed, and some felt that Richardson failed to disguise his positive personality when playing the ineffectual Vershinin. He did not attempt Chekhov again for more than a quarter of a century.
In 1952 Richardson appeared at the Stratford-upon-Avon Festival at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre (forerunner of the Royal Shakespeare Company). His return to Shakespeare for the first time since his Old Vic days was keenly anticipated, but turned out to be a serious disappointment. He had poor reviews for his Prospero in &quot;The Tempest&quot;, judged too prosaic. In the second production of the festival his Macbeth, directed by Gielgud, was generally considered a failure. He was thought unconvincingly villainous; the influential young critic Kenneth Tynan professed himself &quot;unmoved to the point of paralysis&quot;, though blaming the director more than the star. Richardson&#x27;s third and final role in the Stratford season, Volpone in Ben Jonson&#x27;s play, received much better, but not ecstatic, notices. He did not play at Stratford again.

Back in the West End, Richardson was in another Sherriff play, &quot;The White Carnation&quot;, in 1953, and in November of the same year he and Gielgud starred together in N.C.Hunter&#x27;s &quot;A Day by the Sea&quot;, which ran at the Haymarket for 386 performances. During this period, Richardson played Dr Watson in an American/BBC radio co-production of Sherlock Holmes stories, with Gielgud as Holmes and Orson Welles as the evil Professor Moriarty. These recordings were later released commercially on disc.

In late 1954 and early 1955 Richardson and his wife toured Australia together with Sybil Thorndike and her husband, Lewis Casson, playing Terence Rattigan&#x27;s plays &quot;The Sleeping Prince&quot; and &quot;Separate Tables&quot;. The following year he worked with Olivier again, playing Buckingham to Olivier&#x27;s Richard in the 1955 film of &quot;Richard III&quot;. Olivier, who directed, was exasperated at his old friend&#x27;s insistence on playing the role sympathetically.

Richardson turned down the role of Estragon in Peter Hall&#x27;s premiere of the English language version of Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; in 1955, and later reproached himself for missing the chance to be in &quot;the greatest play of my generation&quot;. He had consulted Gielgud, who dismissed the piece as rubbish, and even after discussing the play with the author, Richardson could not understand the play or the character. Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; in his 1956 return to the Old Vic was well received, as was his Broadway appearance in &quot;The Waltz of the Toreadors&quot; for which he was nominated for a Tony Award in 1957. He concluded the 1950s with two contrasting West End successes, Robert Bolt&#x27;s &quot;Flowering Cherry&quot;, and Graham Greene&#x27;s &quot;The Complaisant Lover&quot;. The former, a sad piece about a failed and deluded insurance manager, ran for 435 performances in 1957–58; Richardson co-starred with three leading ladies in succession: Celia Johnson, Wendy Hiller and his wife. Greene&#x27;s comedy was a surprise hit, running for 402 performances from June 1959. Throughout rehearsals the cast treated the love-triangle theme as one of despair, and were astonished to find themselves playing to continual laughter. During the run, Richardson worked by day on another Greene work, the film &quot;Our Man in Havana&quot;. Alec Guinness, who played the main role, noted &quot;the object-lesson in upstaging in the last scene between Richardson and Noël Coward&quot;, faithfully captured by the director, Carol Reed.

===1960s===
Richardson began the 1960s with a failure. Enid Bagnold&#x27;s play &quot;The Last Joke&quot; was savaged by the critics (&quot;a meaningless jumble of pretentious whimsy&quot; was one description). His only reason for playing in the piece was the chance of acting with Gielgud, but both men quickly regretted their involvement. Richardson then went to the US to appear in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot;, alongside Katharine Hepburn. Lumet later recalled how little guidance Richardson needed. Once, the director went into lengthy detail about the playing of a scene, and when he had finished, Richardson said, &quot;Ah, I think I know what you want – a little more flute and a little less cello&quot;. After that, Lumet was sparing with suggestions. Richardson was jointly awarded the Cannes Film Festival&#x27;s Best Actor prize with his co-stars Jason Robards Jr and Dean Stockwell.

Richardson&#x27;s next stage role was in a starry revival of &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;, as Sir Peter Teazle, directed by Gielgud in 1962. The production was taken on a North American tour, in which Gielgud joined the cast as, he said, &quot;the oldest Joseph Surface in the business&quot;. A revival of &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot; in 1963 was judged by the critic Sheridan Morley to have been a high-point of the actor&#x27;s work in the 1960s. Richardson joined a British Council tour of South Africa and Europe the following year; he played Bottom again, and Shylock in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;.
For his next four stage productions, Richardson was at the Haymarket. &quot;Father Carving a Statue&quot; (1964) by Graham Greene was short-lived. He had a more reliable vehicle in Shaw&#x27;s &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot; (1966) in which he played the philosopher-waiter William, and in the same year he had a great success as Sir Anthony Absolute in &quot;The Rivals&quot;. The critic David Benedictus wrote of Richardson&#x27;s performance, &quot;he is choleric and gouty certainly, the script demands that he shall be, but his most engaging quality, his love for his son in spite of himself, shines through every line.&quot; In 1967 he again played Shylock; this was the last time he acted in a Shakespeare play on stage. His performance won critical praise, but the rest of the cast were less well received.

Interspersed with his stage plays, Richardson made thirteen cinema films during the decade. On screen he played historical figures including Sir Edward Carson (&quot;Oscar Wilde&quot;, 1960), W.E.Gladstone (&quot;Khartoum&quot;, 1966) and Sir Edward Grey (&quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot;, 1969). He was scrupulous about historical accuracy in his portrayals, and researched eras and characters in great detail before filming. Occasionally his precision was greater than directors wished, as when, in &quot;Khartoum&quot;, he insisted on wearing a small black finger-stall because the real Gladstone had worn one following an injury. After a role playing a disabled tycoon and Sean Connery&#x27;s uncle in &quot;Woman of Straw&quot;, in 1965 he played Alexander Gromeko in Lean&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, an exceptionally successful film at the box office, which, together with &quot;The Wrong Box&quot; and &quot;Khartoum&quot;, earned him a BAFTA nomination for best leading actor in 1966. Other film roles from this period included Lord Fortnum (&quot;The Bed Sitting Room&quot;, 1969) and Leclerc (&quot;The Looking Glass War&quot;, 1970). The casts of &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; and &quot;Khartoum&quot; included Olivier, but he and Richardson did not appear in the same scenes, and never met during the filming. Olivier was by now running the National Theatre, temporarily based at the Old Vic, but showed little desire to recruit his former colleague for any of the company&#x27;s productions.

In 1964 Richardson was the voice of General Haig in the twenty-six-part BBC documentary series &quot;The Great War&quot;. In 1967 he played Lord Emsworth on BBC television in dramatisations of PGWodehouse&#x27;s Blandings Castle stories, with his wife playing Emsworth&#x27;s bossy sister Constance, and Stanley Holloway as the butler, Beach. He was nervous about acting in a television series: &quot;I&#x27;m sixty-four and that&#x27;s a bit old to be taking on a new medium.&quot; The performances divided critical opinion. &quot;The Times&quot; thought the stars &quot;a sheer delight... situation comedy is joy in their hands&quot;. The reviewers in &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot; thought the three too theatrical to be effective on the small screen. For television he recorded studio versions of two plays in which he had appeared on stage: &quot;Johnson Over Jordan&quot; (1965) and &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; (1968).

During the decade, Richardson made numerous sound recordings. For the Caedmon Audio label he re-created his role as &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; opposite Anna Massey as Roxane, and played the title role in a complete recording of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, with a cast that included Anthony Quayle as Brutus, John Mills as Cassius and Alan Bates as Antony. Other Caedmon recordings were &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; and &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;. Richardson also recorded some English Romantic poetry, including &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; and poems by Keats and Shelley for the label. For Decca Records Richardson recorded the narration for Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;, and for RCA the superscriptions for Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;Sinfonia antartica&quot; – both with the London Symphony Orchestra, the Prokofiev conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent and the Vaughan Williams by André Previn.

Richardson&#x27;s last stage role of the decade was in 1969, as Dr Rance in &quot;What the Butler Saw&quot; by Joe Orton. It was a conspicuous failure. The public hated the play and made the fact vociferously clear at the first night.

===1970–74===
In 1970 Richardson was with Gielgud at the Royal Court in David Storey&#x27;s &quot;Home&quot;. The play is set in the gardens of a nursing home for mental patients, though this is not clear at first. The two elderly men converse in a desultory way, are joined and briefly enlivened by two more extrovert female patients, are slightly scared by another male patient, and are then left together, conversing even more emptily. The &quot;Punch&quot; critic, Jeremy Kingston wrote:

The play transferred to the West End and then to Broadway. In &quot;The New York Times&quot; Clive Barnes wrote, &quot;The two men, bleakly examining the little nothingness of their lives, are John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson giving two of the greatest performances of two careers that have been among the glories of the English-speaking theater.&quot; The original cast recorded the play for television in 1972.

Back at the Royal Court in 1971 Richardson starred in John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;West of Suez&quot;, after which, in July 1972, he surprised many by joining Peggy Ashcroft in a drawing-room comedy, &quot;Lloyd George Knew My Father&quot; by William Douglas-Home. Some critics felt the play was too slight for its two stars, but Harold Hobson thought Richardson found unsuspected depths in the character of the ostensibly phlegmatic General Boothroyd. The play was a hit with the public, and when Ashcroft left after four months, Celia Johnson took over until May 1973, when Richardson handed over to Andrew Cruickshank in the West End. Richardson afterwards toured the play in Australia and Canada with his wife as co-star. An Australian critic wrote, &quot;The play is a vehicle for Sir Ralph... but the real driver is Lady Richardson.&quot;

Richardson&#x27;s film roles of the early 1970s ranged from the bogus medium Mr Benton in &quot;Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?&quot; (1971), the Crypt Keeper in &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; (1972) and dual roles in Lindsay Anderson&#x27;s &quot;O Lucky Man&quot; to the Caterpillar in &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1972) and Dr Rank in Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; (1973). The last of these was released at the same time as an American film of the same play, starring Jane Fonda; the timing detracted from the impact of both versions, but Richardson&#x27;s performance won good reviews. In &quot;The Observer&quot;, George Melly wrote, &quot;As for Sir Ralph as Dr Rank, he grows from the ageing elegant cynic of his first appearance (it&#x27;s even a pleasure to watch him remove his top hat) to become the heroic dying stoic of his final exit without in any way forcing the pace.&quot; In 1973 Richardson received a BAFTA nomination for his performance of George IV in &quot;Lady Caroline Lamb&quot;, in which Olivier appeared as Wellington.

===1975–1983===

Peter Hall, having succeeded Olivier as director of the National Theatre, was determined to attract Ashcroft, Gielgud and Richardson into the company. In 1975 he successfully offered Richardson the title role in Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;John Gabriel Borkman&quot;, with Ashcroft and Wendy Hiller in the two main female roles. The production was one of the early successes of Hall&#x27;s initially difficult tenure. The critic Michael Billington wrote that Hall had done the impossible in reconciling the contradictory aspects of the play and that &quot;Richardson&#x27;s Borkman is both moral monster and self-made superman; and the performance is full of a strange, unearthly music that belongs to this actor alone.&quot;
Richardson continued his long stage association with Gielgud in Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; (1975) directed by Hall at the National. Gielgud played Spooner, a down-at-heel sponger and opportunist, and Richardson was Hirst, a prosperous but isolated and vulnerable author. There is both comedy and pain in the piece: the critic Michael Coveney called their performance &quot;the funniest double-act in town&quot;, but Peter Hall said of Richardson, &quot;I do not think any other actor could fill Hirst with such a sense of loneliness and creativity as Ralph does. The production was a critical and box-office success, and played at the Old Vic, in the West End, at the Lyttelton Theatre in the new National Theatre complex, on Broadway and on television, over a period of three years.

After &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, Richardson once again turned to light comedy by Douglas-Home, from whom he commissioned &quot;The Kingfisher&quot;. A story of an old love affair rekindled, it opened with Celia Johnson as the female lead. It ran for six months, and would have lasted much longer had Johnson not withdrawn, leaving Richardson unwilling to rehearse the piece with anyone else. He returned to the National, and to Chekhov, in 1978 as the aged retainer Firs in &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;. The notices for the production were mixed; those for Richardson&#x27;s next West End play were uniformly dreadful. This was &quot;Alice&#x27;s Boys&quot;, a spy and murder piece generally agreed to be preposterous. A legend, possibly apocryphal, grew that during the short run Richardson walked to the front of the stage one night and asked, &quot;Is there a doctor in the house?&quot; A doctor stood up, and Richardson sadly said to him, &quot;Doctor, isn&#x27;t this a terrible play?&quot;

After this débâcle the rest of Richardson&#x27;s stage career was at the National, with one late exception. He played Lord Touchwood in &quot;The Double Dealer&quot; (1978), the Master in &quot;The Fruits of Enlightenment&quot; (1979), Old Ekdal in &quot;The Wild Duck&quot; (1979) and Kitchen in Storey&#x27;s &quot;Early Days&quot;, specially written for him. The last toured in North America after the London run. His final West End play was &quot;The Understanding&quot; (1982), a gentle comedy of late-flowering love. Celia Johnson was cast as his co-star, but died suddenly just before the first night. Joan Greenwood stepped into the breach, but the momentum of the production had gone, and it closed after eight weeks.

Films in which Richardson appeared in the later 1970s and early 1980s include &quot;Rollerball&quot; (1975), &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; (1977), &quot;Dragonslayer&quot; (1981) in which he played a wizard and &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (1981) in which he played the Supreme Being. In 1983 he was seen as Pfordten in Tony Palmer&#x27;s &quot;Wagner&quot;; this was a film of enormous length, starring Richard Burton as Richard Wagner and was noted at the time, and subsequently, for the cameo roles of three conspiratorial courtiers, played by Gielgud, Olivier and Richardson – the only film in which the three played scenes together. For television, Richardson played Simeon in &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (1977), made studio recordings of &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; (1978) and &quot;Early Days&quot; (1982), and was a guest in the 1981 Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show. His last radio broadcast was in 1982 in a documentary programme about Little Tich, whom he had watched at the Brighton Hippodrome before the First World War.
In &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot;, a television remake of the 1957 film, he played the barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts, co-starring Deborah Kerr and Diana Rigg. In the United States, it was shown on the CBS network in December 1982. Richardson&#x27;s last two films were released after his death: &quot;Give My Regards to Broad Street&quot;, with Paul McCartney, and &quot;&quot;, a retelling of the Tarzan story. In the last, Richardson played the stern old Lord Greystoke, rejuvenated in his latter days by his lost grandson, reclaimed from the wild; he was posthumously nominated for an Academy Award. The film bears the superscription, &quot;Dedicated to Ralph Richardson 1902–1983 – In Loving Memory&quot;

Richardson&#x27;s final stage role was Don Alberto in &quot;Inner Voices&quot; by Eduardo De Filippo at the National in 1983. The direction was criticised by reviewers, but Richardson&#x27;s performance won high praise. He played an old man who denounces the next-door family for murder and then realises he dreamt it but cannot persuade the police that he was wrong. Both &quot;Punch&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; found his performance &quot;mesmerising&quot;. After the London run the piece was scheduled to go on tour in October. Just before that, Richardson suffered a series of strokes, from which he died on 10 October, at the age of eighty. All the theatres in London dimmed their lights in tribute; the funeral Mass was at Richardson&#x27;s favourite church, the Church of Our Lady of the Assumption and St Gregory, in Soho; he was buried in Highgate Cemetery; and the following month there was a memorial service in Westminster Abbey.

==Character and reputation==
As a man, Richardson was on the one hand deeply private and on the other flamboyantly unconventional. Frank Muir said of him, &quot;It&#x27;s the Ralphdom of Ralph that one has to cling to; he wasn&#x27;t really quite like other people.&quot; In Coveney&#x27;s phrase, &quot;His oddness was ever startling and never hardened into mere eccentricity.&quot; Richardson would introduce colleagues to his ferrets by name, ride at high speed on his powerful motor-bike in his seventies, have a parrot flying round his study eating his pencils, or take a pet mouse out for a stroll, but behind such unorthodox behaviour there was a closely guarded self who remained an enigma to even his closest colleagues. Tynan wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that Richardson &quot;made me feel that I have known this man all my life and that I have never met anyone who more adroitly buttonholed me while keeping me firmly at arm&#x27;s length.&quot;

Richardson was not known for his political views. He reportedly voted for Winston Churchill&#x27;s Conservative party in 1945, but there is little other mention of party politics in the biographies. Having been a devoted Roman Catholic as a boy, he became disillusioned with religion as a young man, but drifted back to faith: &quot;I came to a kind of feeling I could touch a live wire through prayer&quot;. He retained his early love of painting, and listed it and tennis in his &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; entry as his recreations.

Peter Hall said of Richardson, &quot;I think he was the greatest actor I have ever worked with.&quot; The director David Ayliff, son of Richardson&#x27;s and Olivier&#x27;s mentor, said, &quot;Ralph was a natural actor, he couldn&#x27;t stop being a perfect actor; Olivier did it through sheer hard work and determination.&quot; Comparing the two, Hobson said that Olivier always made the audience feel inferior, and Richardson always made them feel superior. The actor Edward Hardwicke agreed, saying that audiences were in awe of Olivier, &quot;whereas Ralph would always make you feel sympathy... you wanted to give him a big hug. But they were both giants.&quot;

Richardson thought himself temperamentally unsuited to the great tragic roles, and most reviewers agreed, but to critics of several generations he was peerless in classic comedies. Kenneth Tynan judged any Falstaff against Richardson&#x27;s, which he considered &quot;matchless&quot;, and Gielgud judged &quot;definitive&quot;. Richardson, though hardly ever satisfied with his own performances, evidently believed he had done well as Falstaff. Hall and others tried hard to get him to play the part again, but referring to it he said, &quot;Those things I&#x27;ve done in which I&#x27;ve succeeded a little bit, I&#x27;d hate to do again.&quot;
A leading actor of a younger generation, Albert Finney, has said that Richardson was not really an actor at all, but a magician. Miller, who interviewed many of Richardson&#x27;s colleagues for his 1995 biography, notes that when talking about Richardson&#x27;s acting, &quot;magical&quot; was a word many of them used. &quot;The Guardian&quot; judged Richardson &quot;indisputably our most poetic actor&quot;. For &quot;The Times&quot;, he &quot;was ideally equipped to make an ordinary character seem extraordinary or an extraordinary one seem ordinary&quot;. He himself touched on this dichotomy in his variously reported comments that acting was &quot;merely the art of keeping a large group of people from coughing&quot; or, alternatively, &quot;dreaming to order&quot;.

Tynan, who could be brutally critical when he thought Richardson miscast, nevertheless thought there was something godlike about him, &quot;should you imagine the Almighty to be a whimsical, enigmatic magician, capable of fearful blunders, sometimes inexplicably ferocious, at other times dazzling in his innocence and benignity&quot;. Harold Hobson wrote, &quot;Sir Ralph is an actor who, whatever his failure in heroic parts, however short of tragic grandeur his Othello or his Macbeth may have fallen, has nevertheless, in unromantic tweeds and provincial hats, received a revelation. There are more graceful players than he upon the stage; there is none who has been so touched by Grace.&quot;

<text>EF Hutton was an American stock brokerage firm founded in 1904 by Edward Francis Hutton and his brother, Franklyn Laws Hutton. Later, it was led by well-known Wall Street trader Gerald M. Loeb. Under their leadership, EF Hutton became the second largest brokerage firm in the United States.

== History ==
=== Founding through the 1970s ===
E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. was founded in San Francisco in 1904 by namesake Edward Francis Hutton and his brother, Franklyn Laws Hutton. EF Hutton was one of the first brokerages to open offices in California. In 1906, two years after the firm was founded, its offices were destroyed in the San Francisco earthquake of 1906. In 1924, famed Wall Street trader Gerald M. Loeb joined the firm, ultimately rising to chairman. The firm developed a nationwide retail brokerage network to market its debt and equity securities. It also operated seasonal offices in Palm Beach, Florida (winter) and Saratoga Springs, New York (summer) to cater to its customers. Morrie Cohen opened Hutton&#x27;s first one-man office on Maui in December 1969.

Hutton, an entrepreneur who later also became chairman of the General Foods Corporation and for years wrote a newspaper column, led the firm until his death in 1962. In 1970, Robert M. Fomon was appointed Hutton&#x27;s Chief Executive Officer. In or around 1972, the firm hired Carole Brookins, making her one of the few women stockbrokers on the Chicago futures exchange floors at the time. Despite the failure or takeover of many of its peers in the 1960s and 1970s, Hutton retained its independence under Fomon&#x27;s leadership. By the early 1980s, the original E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. had become the principal component of what grew into a group of companies owned by E.F. Hutton Group Inc., listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Other subsidiaries of that Delaware-chartered holding company were E.F. Hutton Trust Company (now &quot;Smith Barney Corporate Trust Company&quot; and owned by Citigroup), E.F. Hutton Life Insurance Company, and E.F. Hutton Bank. The Hutton companies also managed many mutual funds and other investment vehicles, some of which were separately incorporated and/or registered, and participated actively in corporate mergers and public offerings of securities. In 1976, Western Union partnered with E. F. Hutton &amp; Co.

=== 1980s check scandal ===
In 1980, several Hutton branches began writing checks which were greater than the cash they had on hand at the bank, then making a deposit in another bank equal to the amount it wrote at the first bank. This strategy, known as &quot;chaining&quot;, is a form of check kiting. &quot;Chaining&quot; gave Hutton the use of money in both accounts until the checks cleared. In effect, Hutton was giving itself a free loan that also did not carry any interest. Thomas Morley, who was in charge of getting the firm to better manage its cash, wrote a memo to Hutton&#x27;s president, George Ball, saying that this practice netted one branch an extra $30,000 per month. Ball sent the memo out across Hutton&#x27;s network of regional sales managers, with the note, &quot;A point well remembered—and acted on.&quot; Over the years, Hutton shuffled money in this manner between 400 banks (mostly small rural banks), gaining the use of an estimated $250 million a day without paying a penny in interest. Whenever something was amiss, Hutton questioned the bank&#x27;s procedures.

The scheme worked for almost three years until officials at the Genesee County Bank in Leroy, New York, discovered that the large deposits made by Hutton&#x27;s four-person office there were far more than the office&#x27;s banking requirements. They also discovered that the checks Hutton was using to make the deposits were drawn on two Pennsylvania banks. When Genesee officials learned that Hutton did not have enough money in the Pennsylvania bank accounts to cover the checks, they stopped honoring Hutton checks. One of the banks involved, United Penn Bank (now part of Citizens Financial Group), asked the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to investigate. In 1984, the matter was forwarded to the United States Attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, who opened a federal criminal probe.

Hutton retained Tom Curnin, a respected defense attorney who was inclined to fight the government. However, in February 1985, Curnin discovered a memo from a Hutton regional vice president for the Washington, D.C., area which stated that his offices drew on &quot;bogus deposits&quot;. The memo—tantamount to a smoking gun—led Curnin to change tactics and begin negotiations for a plea agreement. In the spring of 1985, Curnin told Hutton&#x27;s board that it faced two choices: plead guilty to a massive list of felonies or face a trial that would likely see three senior Hutton executives convicted and drive Hutton out of business. Curnin advised settling with the government to avoid years of bad publicity.

On May 2, Hutton agreed to plead guilty to 2,000 counts of mail and wire fraud, as well as pay a $2 million fine plus $750,000 for the cost of the investigation. This is equivalent to approximately $ and $, respectively, in . Hutton also agreed to pay $8 million in restitution—the estimated extra income earned from the fraud. This is equivalent to approximately $ in . In return, Curnin wrung two major concessions. First, no Hutton executives would be prosecuted (even though the government determined that 25 senior officers masterminded the scheme). Second, the Securities and Exchange Commission allowed Hutton to stay in business; offenses of this magnitude usually result in an individual or firm being permanently barred from the securities industry.

An internal review conducted by former Attorney General Griffin Bell concluded that the scam occurred due to inadequate internal controls. For example, no one admitted to being Morley&#x27;s immediate supervisor. However, a wide perception that Hutton had not been punished enough (for example, &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ William Safire claimed that the $2.75 million fine amounted to &quot;putting a parking ticket on the Brink&#x27;s getaway car&quot;), led several customers to pull their accounts with Hutton, and many of the firm&#x27;s star performers fled to other firms. Several public agencies also took their business elsewhere. Although Fomon was not implicated in the scandal, the board fired him in 1987.

=== 1987 market crash and 1990s mergers ===
In early 1987, an internal probe revealed that brokers at an office in Providence, Rhode Island, laundered money for the Patriarca crime family. Although Hutton reported the investigation to the SEC, it was not enough to stop prosecutors from all but announcing that Hutton would be indicted.

In a case of especially bad timing, this came only a week before the 1987 stock market crash. By the end of November, Hutton had lost $76 million, largely due to massive trading losses and margin calls that its customers could not meet. It also had its commercial paper rating cut from A-2 to A-3, effectively losing $1.3 million in financing. Hutton was now weeks—perhaps days, according to some board members—from collapse. On December 3, Hutton agreed to a merger with Shearson Lehman/American Express. The merger took effect in 1988, and the merged firm was named Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc.

It later emerged that Hutton had faced massive cash shorts as early as 1985, and the firm&#x27;s management had tried to put it up for sale as early as 1986.

Following the merger, dozens of Hutton brokers left the firm to join competitors. At the same time, the combined firm suffered dwindling business from individual investors as its focus was shifted to large corporate transactions. The Hutton brand was used until 1990, when American Express abandoned the name and the business was renamed Shearson Lehman Brothers. Joe Plumeri became the President &amp; Managing Partner of Shearson Lehman Brothers in 1990.

In 1992, Shearson sold The Boston Company, an asset management group, to Mellon Financial. In December 1988, the Boston Company had disclosed that it had overreported its earnings by $30 million.

In 1993, American Express sold its brokerage and asset management business—the Shearson and Hutton parts of Shearson Lehman Hutton—to Primerica for 1 billion dollars. Primerica merged them with Smith Barney (which it had bought in 1987) to form Smith Barney Shearson, later shortened back to simply Smith Barney. As a result of several mergers throughout the 1990s, the remains of the original E.F. Hutton became part of Citigroup, and later Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, a joint venture between Morgan Stanley and Citigroup.

=== Revival as EFH Group ===

As a result of the Subprime mortgage crisis, Citigroup was forced to sell assets. A group of E.F. Hutton alumni reportedly bought the E.F. Hutton brand for an undisclosed amount. In 2012, a group of EF Hutton alumni led by Frank Campanale announced plans to launch a new financial advisory firm under the name E.F. Hutton &amp; Company, but Campanale left in October 2013 to become chairman and chief executive of Lebenthal Wealth Advisors LLC and the effort was abandoned.

In 2014, a new group, led by Christopher Daniels, who had started his career at EF Hutton&#x27;s investment bank, re-launched as EFH Group Inc.  Daniels had been president of Ascend, a structured finance firm, and before that, he had worked for Raymond James in capital markets. EFH Group changed the brand’s stylization from E.F. Hutton to EF Hutton.

Stanley Hutton Rumbough, grandson of Edward Francis Hutton the founder of EF Hutton, served as non-executive Chairman of the Board . EFH Group went public In November 2014, via a reverse merger with OTC-traded Twentyfour/seven Ventures, Inc. and was renamed EF Hutton America, Inc. trading under the stock symbol HUTN. In 2016 the company headquarters were relocated to One Main Street in Springfield, Ohio., and in October, 2017 the firm name was changed to HUTN, Inc.

HUTN aimed to apply the power of social media platforms and technology to deliver an improved, customer-centric approach to financial services. It embarked on an ambitious software and platform development program but was under-capitalized.  By late 2018 it had accumulated $14 million dollars worth of debt and had pledged its office building and the rights to the EF Hutton brand as collateral.

CEO Christopher Daniels, who was also the majority shareholder with over 92% of the voting rights resigned in April, 2019 after several attempted debt restructurings were unsuccessful due to the magnitude of the company&#x27;s debts and the over-leveraged position of its assets.  HUTN &quot;ceased normal operations&quot; and the board agreed to accept a loan from its chairman Stanley Hutton Rumbough to provide interim funding to the company as it began the process of dissolution and wind-down.

=== 2021 revival ===
The EF Hutton name was once again revived in 2021 as EF Hutton Group, the rebranding for Kingswood Capital Markets, an affiliate of Kingswood Holdings Ltd. and Benchmark Investments LLC. The investment bank acquired the EF Hutton name because of the “incredible legacy of this powerhouse firm that was once synonymous with Wall Street,” said Chief Executive Officer Joseph T. Rallo and President David W. Boral.

Unlike the Campanale and Daniels start-up efforts, the new EF Hutton Group is already a successful firm. Since its founding in May 2020, the former Kingswood Capital Markets has experienced significant growth, raising over $2 billion in capital for its clients in the first 8 months of 2021, and over $3 billion in the last twelve months.

The EF Hutton Group management team also plans to launch a series of SPACs under the EF Hutton brand.  The first EF Hutton SPAC, led by CEO Ben Piggott and co-presidents Rallo and Boral, is set to raise about $150 million and will target the U.S. consumer technology sector. Stanley Hutton Rumbough, grandson of Edward Francis Hutton, has the option to invest in and join the board of the firm’s first four special purpose acquisition companies, according to people with knowledge of the matter. EF Hutton’s blank-check companies are yet to publicly file paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

== Early life and background ==
Mohammed Aamir Hussain Khan was born on 14 March 1965 in Bombay to Tahir Hussain, a film producer, and Zeenat Hussain. He is the second of four siblings; he has a younger brother—Faisal Khan—and two sisters, Farhat and Nikhat Khan.

His family has roots from Herat in Afghanistan; Khan&#x27;s paternal grandfather was a schoolteacher from a Pashtun zamindar background while his paternal grandmother was an Arab tracing her roots to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia and a niece of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. Khan has expressed his wish to make a movie about Maulana Azad. Najma Heptulla, the 16th Governor of Manipur and the grand-niece of Maulana Azad, is Khan&#x27;s cousin.

Several of his relatives were members of the Hindi film industry, including his late paternal uncle, producer-director Nasir Hussain. Nasir&#x27;s son Mansoor Khan is a director who has cast Aamir in most of his movies while Nasir&#x27;s grandson through his daughter, Imran Khan, is a former Hindi film actor. Through his mother, Khan is a nephew of the Fazli brothers, who have been filmmakers in both India and Pakistan.

As a child actor, he appeared on screen in two minor roles. At the age of eight, he appeared in &quot;Yaadon Ki Baaraat&quot; (1973), which was the first masala film in Bollywood. The following year, he portrayed the younger version of Mahendra Sandhu&#x27;s character in &quot;Madhosh&quot;. Khan attended J.B. Petit School for his pre-primary education, later switching to St. Anne&#x27;s High School, Bandra, until the eighth grade, and completed his ninth and tenth grades at Bombay Scottish School, Mahim. He played tennis in state level championships and became a state-level champion. He professed he was &quot;much more into sports than studies&quot;. He completed his twelfth grade at Mumbai&#x27;s Narsee Monjee College, and described his childhood as &quot;tough&quot; due to the financial problems his father had, as his film productions were mostly unsuccessful. He said, &quot;There would be at least 30 calls a day from creditors calling for their money,&quot; and that he was always at risk of being expelled from school for non-payment of fees.

At the age of sixteen, Khan got involved in the experimental process of making a 40-minute silent film, &quot;Paranoia&quot;, which was directed by his school friend Aditya Bhattacharya. The film was funded by filmmaker Shriram Lagoo, an acquaintance of Bhattacharya, who provided them with a few thousand rupees. His parents did not want him to make films and wished that he would instead pursue a &quot;steady&quot; career as an engineer or doctor; for that reason, the shooting schedule of &quot;Paranoia&quot; was kept secret. In the film, he played the lead role alongside actors Neena Gupta and Victor Banerjee while simultaneously assisting Bhattacharya. He said that the experience encouraged him to pursue a career in film.

Khan subsequently joined a theatre group called Avantar, where he worked backstage for over a year. He made his stage debut with a small role in the company&#x27;s Gujarati play, &quot;Kesar Bina&quot;, at Prithvi Theatre. He went on to act in two of their Hindi plays, and one English play, which was titled &quot;Clearing House&quot;. After completing high school, Khan decided to discontinue studying, and work instead as an assistant director to Hussain on the Hindi films &quot;Manzil Manzil&quot; and &quot;Zabardast&quot;.

In 2007, he lost a custody battle for his younger brother Faisal to their father, Tahir Hussain, who died on 2 February 2010.

As a practising Muslim, he along with his mother Zeenat, performed Hajj, an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and a mandatory religious duty for Muslims, in 2013.

== Acting career ==
=== 1984–1989: Debut and career challenges ===
In addition to assisting Hussain, he acted in documentaries directed by the students of the Film and Television Institute of India. Director Ketan Mehta noticed Khan in those films, and offered him a role in the low-budget experimental film &quot;Holi&quot;. Featuring an ensemble cast of newcomers, &quot;Holi&quot; was based on a play by Mahesh Elkunchwar, and dealt with the practice of ragging in India. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that the film was &quot;melodramatic&quot; but &quot;very decently and exuberantly performed by the nonprofessional actors&quot;. Khan played a rowdy college student, an &quot;insignificant&quot; role that was described by CNN-IBN as &quot;lack[ing] in finesse&quot;.

&quot;Holi&quot; failed to attract a broad audience, but Hussain and his son Mansoor cast him as the leading man in Mansoor&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak&quot; (1988) opposite Juhi Chawla. The film is a tale of unrequited love and parental opposition, with Aamir Khan portraying Raj, a &quot;clean-cut, wholesome boy-next-door&quot;. It became a major commercial success, and catapulted both Khan and Chawla to stardom. It received seven Filmfare Awards including a Best Male Debut trophy for him.

, a crime thriller from Bhattacharya that was filmed before the production of &quot;Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak&quot;, was released in 1989. Despite a poor reception at the box office, the film was critically acclaimed. Khan was awarded a National Film Award – Special Jury Award / Special Mention for his performances in both &quot;Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak&quot; and . Later that year, he reunited with Chawla for the romantic comedy &quot;Love Love Love&quot;, a commercial failure.

=== 1990–2004: Rise to prominence and hiatus ===

Khan had five releases in 1990. He found no success in &quot;Awwal Number&quot;, &quot;Deewana Mujh Sa Nahin&quot; and &quot;Jawani Zindabad&quot;. However, Tahir Hussain&#x27;s fantasy drama &quot;Tum Mere Ho&quot; again co-starring Chawla was a box office hit and Indra Kumar&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Dil&quot; opposite Madhuri Dixit emerged a blockbuster as well as the highest-earning film of 1990. This was followed by a leading role alongside Pooja Bhatt in Mahesh Bhatt&#x27;s &quot;Dil Hai Ke Manta Nahin&quot;, a remake of the American film &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, which was a semi-hit.

He appeared in several other films in the early 1990s, including &quot;Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar&quot; (1992), &quot;Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke&quot; (1993) (for which he also wrote the screenplay), and &quot;Rangeela&quot; (1995). Most of these films were successful critically and commercially. Other successes include (1994); at the time of its release, the movie was reviewed unfavorably by critics, but over the years has gained cult status. In 1993, Khan also appeared in Yash Chopra&#x27;s action drama film &quot;Parampara&quot;. Despite having an ensemble cast that included Sunil Dutt, Vinod Khanna, Raveena Tandon, and Saif Ali Khan, the film failed to find a wide audience and became a critical and commercial failure. Khan was also cast in &quot;Time Machine&quot;; however, due to financial constraints, the film was shelved and remained unreleased.

He continued to act in just one or two films a year, which was an unusual trait for a mainstream Hindi cinema actor. His only release in 1996 was the Dharmesh Darshan-directed mega blockbuster &quot;Raja Hindustani&quot;, in which he was paired opposite Karisma Kapoor. The film earned him his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor after seven previous nominations, and went on to become the biggest hit of the year, as well as the third-highest grossing Indian film of the 1990s. Adjusted for inflation, &quot;Raja Hindustani&quot; is the fourth highest-grossing film in India since the 1990s. In 1997, he acted in &quot;Ishq&quot;, which proved to be another blockbuster for him. The following year, Khan appeared in Vikram Bhatt&#x27;s action thriller &quot;Ghulam&quot;, for which he also did playback singing. The film received positive response from reviewers and went on to become a hit at the box office.

John Mathew Matthan&#x27;s &quot;Sarfarosh&quot;, Khan&#x27;s first film in 1999, was also a commercially successful venture. The film and Khan were highly appreciated by movie critics, as was his role in Deepa Mehta&#x27;s Canadian-Indian art house film &quot;Earth&quot; (1998). &quot;Earth&quot; was internationally acclaimed by critics such as Roger Ebert for Khan&#x27;s portrayal of Dil Nawaz (&quot;Ice Candy Man&quot;). His first release for the 2000s, &quot;Mela&quot;, in which he acted alongside his brother Faisal, was both a box office and critical failure.

In 2001, he produced and starred in &quot;Lagaan&quot;, and received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film at the 74th Academy Awards. The film also received critical acclaim at several international film festivals, in addition to winning numerous Indian awards such as a National Film Award. Khan also won his second Filmare Award for Best Actor.

&quot;Lagaan&quot; success was followed by &quot;Dil Chahta Hai&quot; later that year. The film was written and directed by then-debutant Farhan Akhtar, and won the 2001 Filmfare Award for Best Film (Critics). He then took a four-year break from Bollywood after his divorce from Reena Dutta.

=== 2005–2017: Comeback and global success ===
Khan made a comeback in 2005 as the lead in Ketan Mehta&#x27;s &quot;Mangal Pandey: The Rising&quot;, which was screened at the Cannes Film Festival.

Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra&#x27;s &quot;Rang De Basanti&quot; was Khan&#x27;s first film in 2006. His performance was critically acclaimed, earning him a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor and various nominations for &quot;Best Actor&quot;. The film went on to become one of the highest-grossing films of the year, and was selected as India&#x27;s official entry to the Oscars. Although the film was not shortlisted as a nominee for the Oscar, it received a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language at the BAFTA Awards in England. In Khan&#x27;s next movie, &quot;Fanaa&quot; (2006), he played a Kashmiri insurgent terrorist, his second antagonistic role after &quot;Earth&quot;, the role offered him creative possibilities to try something different.

His 2007 film, , was also produced by him and marked his directorial debut. The film, which was the second release from Aamir Khan Productions, opened to positive responses from critics and audiences. His performance was well-received, though he was particularly applauded for his directing. He received the Filmfare Awards for Best Director and Best Film of 2007, as well as the National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare. The film won other awards, including the 2008 Zee Cine Awards and 4th Apsara Film &amp; Television Producers Guild Awards. The film was initially acclaimed as India&#x27;s official entry for the 2009 Academy Awards Best Foreign Film.

In May 2012, it was the first Indian film to be officially released on YouTube. The film won six Filmfare Awards (including Best Film and Best Director), ten Star Screen Awards, eight IIFA Awards, and three National Film Awards. Overseas, it won the Grand Prize at Japan&#x27;s Videoyasan Awards, and was nominated for Best Outstanding Foreign Language Film at the Japan Academy Awards and Best Foreign Film at China&#x27;s Beijing International Film Festival.

Aamir Khan has been credited with opening up the Chinese markets for Indian films. His father Tahir Hussain previously had success in China with &quot;Caravan&quot;, but Indian films declined in the country afterwards, until he opened up the Chinese market for Indian films in the early 21st century. &quot;Lagaan&quot; became the first Indian film to have a nationwide release there. When &quot;3 Idiots&quot; released in China, the country was only the 15th largest film market partly due to China&#x27;s widespread pirate DVD distribution at the time, which introduced the film to most Chinese audiences, becoming a cult hit in the country. It became China&#x27;s 12th favourite film of all time, according to ratings on Chinese film review site Douban, with only one domestic Chinese film (&quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;) ranked higher. As a result, he gained a large growing Chinese fanbase. After &quot;3 Idiots&quot; went viral, several of his other films, such as &quot;Taare Zameen Par&quot; and &quot;Ghajini&quot; also gained a cult following. By 2013, China grew to become the world&#x27;s second largest film market (after the United States), contributing to Khan&#x27;s box office success with &quot;Dhoom 3&quot; (2013), &quot;PK&quot; (2014), and &quot;Dangal&quot; (2016).

In 2016, he produced and starred in &quot;Dangal&quot;, and was cast as wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat. He played him at different ages, from 20 to 60 years old; he weighed 98 kg to portray the older Phogat before losing weight to play the younger version. The film received positive reviews from critics and emerged as the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time domestically, surpassing &quot;PK&quot;, making it the fifth time he had achieved this feat. &quot;Dangal&quot; also became an overseas blockbuster success in China, where it was the 16th highest-grossing film of all time, the 8th highest-grossing foreign film, and the highest-grossing non-Hollywood foreign film. Worldwide, it became the fifth highest-grossing non-English language film of all time, and gave him one of the highest salaries for a non-Hollywood actor at $42 million. &quot;Dangal&quot; has also been watched over 350million times on Chinese streaming platforms.

== In the media ==

In a 2009 interview, Aamir Khan stated that he tends to take an independent approach to the world of filmmaking, noting that he does not &quot;do different things; I try to do it in a different manner. I think every person should follow his/her dream and try and make it possible to create an ability to achieve it backed by its practicality.&quot; He also said that he is more interested in the process of filmmaking than in the result: &quot;For me, the process is more important, more joyful. I would like to have my entire concentration on the process right from the first step.&quot;

Aamir Khan has a reputation for avoiding award ceremonies and not accepting any popular Indian film awards. Although he has been nominated many times, Khan has not attended any Indian film award ceremonies and has stated that &quot;Indian film awards lack credibility&quot;. When asked about the selection procedure and authenticity of popular Indian film awards, he replied, &quot;Fact is that I have no objections to film awards. I just feel that if I don&#x27;t value a particular film award, then I won&#x27;t attend it either. Apart from the National Film Awards, I don&#x27;t see any other award ceremony that I should give value to. My personal experience about these award ceremonies is that I don&#x27;t trust them. I have no faith in them so I would prefer to stay away.&quot;

In 2007, he was invited to have a wax imitation of himself put on display at Madame Tussauds in London. Khan declined, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s not important to me ... people will see my films if they want to. Also, I cannot deal with so many things, I have bandwidth only for that much.&quot; He also endorsed brands including Coca-Cola, Godrej, Titan Watches, Tata Sky, Toyota Innova, Samsung, Monaco Biscuits, and Snapdeal.

In April 2013, he was among Time magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 Most Influential People in the World. Khan was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; Asia edition in the September 2012 issue with the title &quot;Khan&#x27;s Quest&quot; – &quot;He is breaking the Bollywood mold by tackling India&#x27;s social evils. Can an actor change a nation?&quot; In addition to being highly popular in India, he is also highly popular overseas, particularly in China, the second largest movie market. He is the most followed Indian national on Chinese social media site Sina Weibo, above Indian prime minister Narendra Modi. Khan is also popular in Turkey, Hong Kong, and Singapore, among many other countries.

In February 2015, Aamir Khan stated his views on a popular online comedy group All India Bakchod for its celebrity roast episode. He said, &quot;I completely believe in freedom of speech, no issues. But we have to understand that we all have a certain responsibility. When I heard what was being described to me I felt it was a violent event.&quot; He further said violence is not just physical but it has verbal aspects to it. He called the roast a shameless act, and even called out his friends from the film industry—Karan, Ranveer, and Arjun.

In Indian media, he is often referred to as &quot;Mr. Perfectionist&quot; for his dedication to his work. In Chinese media, he is often referred to as a &quot;national treasure of India&quot; or &quot;conscience of India&quot;, due to much of his work tackling various social issues that are pervasive in Indian society, some of which are also relevant to Chinese society, in a way that domestic Chinese films often do not portray. His work is highly regarded in China, with films such as &quot;Taare Zameen Par&quot; (2007), &quot;3 Idiots&quot; (2009) and &quot;Dangal&quot; (2016), as well as his television show &quot;Satyamev Jayate&quot; (20122014), being some of the highest-rated productions on Douban. In China, Khan is known for being associated with quality cinema and committed to social causes, and is often seen as an activist-actor. In the past, Chinese media used to refer to him as &quot;India&#x27;s Andy Lau&quot;, but as Khan gained more familiarity with mainstream Chinese audiences, younger fans have often referred to him by the moniker &quot;Uncle Aamir&quot; or &quot;Mishu&quot;. He has become a household name in China, where he is currently the most famous Indian. His book &quot;I&#x27;ll Do it My Way&quot; is commonly found in bookstores across China, while Chinese retailers sell merchandise ranging from &quot;Uncle Aamir&quot; smartphone cases to &quot;Dhoom 3&quot;-style black hats. His effect in China has drawn comparisons with previous Indian cultural icons in the country, including the Bengali writer Rabindranath Tagore, and actors Raj Kapoor and Nargis.

In April 2006, Aamir Khan participated in the demonstrations put up by the Narmada Bachao Andolan committee after the Gujarat government&#x27;s decision to raise the height of the Narmada dam. He was quoted to support adivasis (tribes), who might be displaced from their homes. Later he faced protests and a partial ban on his film &quot;Fanaa&quot;, but the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, supported him by saying, &quot;Everyone has the freedom of expression. If someone says something on a particular subject, that doesn&#x27;t mean you should start protesting.&quot; Aamir also lent his support to the Janlokpal Bill Movement led by Anna Hazare in August 2011.

He has been supporting common causes; when asked about views on the entertainment tax in the 2012 budget, Khan said, &quot;I don&#x27;t want any reduction in that, all I expect is focus on education and nutrition.&quot; He quit the GOI&#x27;s copyrights panels in February 2010 after facing sharp differences with other members. During the promotion of &quot;3 Idiots&quot;, he journeyed to diverse parts of India, mostly to small towns, noting that &quot;filmmakers from Mumbai don&#x27;t understand small-town India&quot;. This experience of reaching out to &quot;regional India&quot; was extended in &quot;Satyamev Jayate&quot;. On 16 July 2012, Khan met the prime minister and the minister for social justice and empowerment, and discussed the plight of manual scavengers and sought eradication of manual scavenging in the country.

On 30 November 2011, he was appointed national brand ambassador of UNICEF to promote child nutrition. He is part of the government-organised IEC campaign to raise awareness about malnutrition. He is also known for supporting causes such as feminism and improved education in India, which are themes in several of his films. His crossover success in China has been described as a form of Indian soft power, helping to improve China–India relations, despite political tensions between the two nations (such as Doklam and the Maldives), with Khan stating he wants to help &quot;improve India-China ties&quot;. Due to Khan being a household name in China, he has been considered to be India&#x27;s brand ambassador to China by the Indian commerce ministry, which may contribute to reducing the trade deficit with China.

In 2016, Aamir Khan came up with the Maharashtra government to make the state drought-free in the next five years. He has been doing &quot;shramdaan&quot; for the last 3 years. He asked people to come to join him in this cause and become a Jal Mitra by doing &quot;shramdaan&quot;. While explaining to journalists, Khan said, &quot;the reason why popular TV show Satyamev Jayate did not go on air was not because of Court&#x27;s verdict, but because all the producers, directors and talents working on this show were busy in this water project. For us, the water conservation project in the State is the most important initiative.&quot; He is a co-founder of Paani Foundation with Rao. The foundation is a non-profit, non-governmental organisation which is active in the area of drought prevention and watershed management in the Maharashtra, India.

In October 2014, he was appointed as the UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for South Asia.

== Personal life ==

Aamir Khan married Reena Dutta, who had a small part in &quot;Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak&quot;, on 18 April 1986. They have two children: a son named Junaid and a daughter, Ira. Dutta was involved briefly in his career when she worked as a producer for &quot;Lagaan&quot;. In December 2002, he filed for divorce and Dutta took custody of both children.

On 28 December 2005, he married Kiran Rao, who had been an assistant director to Gowariker on the set of &quot;Lagaan&quot;. On 5 December 2011, they announced the birth of their son, Azad Rao Khan, through a surrogate mother. In July 2021, the couple announced their separation and stated they would raise their son Azad together.

His former wife Rao is a Hindu. In March 2015, he stated that he quit non-vegetarian food and adopted a vegan lifestyle after being inspired by her.

Before pursuing a full-time acting career, Aamir Khan was an avid tennis player. He played professionally in state level championships in the 1980s and became a state level tennis champion prior to entering a full-time acting career. In 2014, he participated in an exhibition match for the International Premier Tennis League, playing doubles with grand slam winners Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, as well as Sania Mirza.

His children have also ventured into the entertainment industry. In September 2019, Ira announced on social media that she would be directing a theatrical production, her first, a version of Euripides&#x27; &quot;Medea.&quot; Veteran actress Sarika, ex-wife of Kamal Haasan, and her daughter Akshara Haasan produced the play, and Khan&#x27;s sister Farhat Dutta had painted a poster for its promotion. His elder son Junaid made his acting debut in the Hindi film &quot;Maharaj&quot;.

== Political controversies ==
=== Gujarat (2006) ===

In 2006, Aamir Khan lent his support to the Narmada Bachao Andolan movement, led by activist Medha Patkar, in their actions against raising the height of the Sardar Sarovar Dam. While promoting his film &quot;Fanaa&quot; in Gujarat, he made some comments regarding the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi&#x27;s handling of the Narmada Dam and the necessity to rehabilitate the displaced villagers. These comments were met with outrage from the BJP, with the government of Gujarat demanding an apology from Khan. He refused to apologise, saying &quot;I am saying exactly what the Supreme Court has said. I only asked for rehabilitation of poor farmers. I never spoke against the construction of the dam. I will not apologise for my comments on the issue.&quot; An unofficial ban of &quot;Fanaa&quot; was put in place for the entire state of Gujarat. Protests occurred against the film and Khan, which included burning posters of him. As a result, several multiplex owners stated that they could not provide security to customers, and all theatre owners in Gujarat refused to screen the film.

=== Comments on intolerance (2013–2016) ===

In November 2015, Aamir Khan expressed the feelings that he and Rao had about rising intolerance in India at an event in New Delhi hosted by &quot;The Indian Express&quot; newspaper in response to political events in India that included violent attacks against Muslims and intellectuals, and the absence of swift or strong condemnation from the country&#x27;s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Modi government. He remarked that Rao, fearing for her family, suggested to &quot;move out of India&quot;.

BJP responded with online campaigns through its social media cell to intimidate Khan. The ensuing political controversy was referred to as the &quot;intolerance row&quot; in the Indian media, and started a debate on social media. Khan faced intense backlash for his comments, with certain sections of society branding him &quot;anti-national&quot;, while others voiced their agreement about his concerns and supported him.

Much of the backlash against him, an Indian Muslim with a Hindu wife, came from Hindu nationalist groups. The far-right political party Shiv Sena sharply criticised Khan&#x27;s statement, labelling it &quot;the language of treachery&quot;, and the BJP condemned the incident as a &quot;Moral Offence&quot;. In the wake of the controversy, burning of posters took place in Ludhiana by Shiv Sena. Punjab&#x27;s Shiv Sena chief Rajeev Tandon also made a violent threat, offering a reward to anyone who slaps Khan. As a result, the Khans were given additional police protection. Khan responded to the backlash and threats by stating, &quot;it saddens me to say you are only proving my point&quot;.

In response to the backlash, he received support from a number of celebrities and public figures, including Indian National Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Hrithik Roshan, Shah Rukh Khan, Mamata Banerjee, Rajkumar Hirani, Kabir Khan, Farah Khan, A. R. Rahman, and Priyanka Chopra. On the other hand, some criticised Khan&#x27;s remark about intolerance, including Shatrughan Sinha, Anupam Kher, Raveena Tandon, and Vivek Oberoi.

He later stated that he was not leaving the country. A lawsuit was filed against Khan and Rao at Jaunpur in ACJM II court. Khan was dropped as brand ambassador of the government&#x27;s official Incredible India tourism campaign. A company that Khan was endorsing, Snapdeal, faced backlash from Khan&#x27;s critics for being associated with him, before the company distanced themselves from his comments.

Aamir Khan later clarified his comments in January 2016, saying that he never said India was intolerant or that he thought about leaving the country, saying he was &quot;born in India and will die in India&quot;. He said that his comments were taken out of context and the media was responsible for it to some extent. Despite this, he continued to face backlash later in the year, with calls for protests and boycotts against &quot;Dangal&quot;. In October 2016, the Vishva Hindu Parishad called for protests against the film. Following its release in December 2016, #BoycottDangal trended on Twitter, and BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya called for protests against the film. Despite calls to boycott the film, &quot;Dangal&quot; turned out to be a massive hit, grossing more than in India.

== Awards and honours ==

Khan won 9 Filmfare Awards, out of 32 nominations, including the Best Actor award for &quot;Raja Hindustani&quot; (1996), &quot;Lagaan&quot; (2001), and &quot;Dangal&quot; (2016); the Best Actor (Critics) award for &quot;Rang De Basanti&quot; (2006); the Best Film award for &quot;Lagaan&quot;, (2007), and &quot;Dangal&quot;; and the Best Director award for &quot;Taare Zameen Par&quot;. He won four National Film Awards: as an actor in &quot;Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak&quot; (1988) and (1989), as producer of &quot;Lagaan&quot; and &quot;Madness in the Desert&quot; (2004), and as director and producer of &quot;Taare Zameen Par&quot;.

&quot;Lagaan&quot; earned an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film at the 74th Academy Awards in 2002. He commented on losing at the Oscars: &quot;Certainly we were disappointed. But the thing that really kept us in our spirits was that the entire country was behind us&quot;. &quot;Taare Zameen Par&quot; was also India&#x27;s submission to the Oscars, but was not nominated. Another Khan production, &quot;Peepli Live&quot; (2010), was India&#x27;s submission to the Oscars, while &quot;Dhobi Ghat&quot; (2011) was longlisted for the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language; neither were nominated. In 2017, &quot;Dangal&quot; won him the inaugural Best Asian Film award at Australia&#x27;s 7th AACTA Awards, as well as Movie of the Year and Top Foreign Actor from China&#x27;s Douban Film Awards, and it was an award nominee for the 68th Berlin International Film Festival.

Khan has received honorary accolades, including the India&#x27;s Padma Shri in 2003 and Padma Bhushan in 2010, and an Honorary Doctorate by the Maulana Azad National Urdu University for his contributions to the Indian cinema and entertainment industry. In 2011, he accepted an invitation from the Berlin Film Festival to be on the jury, after having turned it down three times since 2008. In 2012, he appeared on the &quot;Time&quot; 100 list of most influential people in the world. In 2017, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences invited Khan to be a member, and he received an award for &quot;National Treasure of India&quot; from China.

Khan is known for refusing to attend, or accept awards from, Indian film ceremonies. This has led to controversy, notably at the 2017 National Film Awards, where he was snubbed from Best Actor for &quot;Dangal&quot;. Committee member Priyadarshan explained that they did not want to award him because of his refusal to attend. Despite avoiding Indian ceremonies, he made an exception for the 2002 Academy Awards, so &quot;Lagaan&quot; could reach a wider audience, but did not care much about the award.

In December 2024, Khan was honoured at the opening night of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Red Sea Film Festival.

<text>Laura Riding Jackson (born Laura Reichenthal; January 16, 1901 – September 2, 1991), best known as Laura Riding, was an American poet, critic, novelist, essayist and short story writer.

==Early life and education==
She was born in New York City to Nathaniel Reichenthal, a Jewish immigrant from Galicia, and Sadie (née Edersheim), and educated at Cornell University. She met historian Louis R. Gottschalk, then a graduate assistant at Cornell, and they married in 1920. 

==Career==
She began to write poetry, publishing first (1923–26) under the name Laura Riding Gottschalk. She became associated with the Fugitives through Allen Tate, and they published her poems in &quot;The Fugitive&quot; magazine. They awarded her the Nashville Prize in 1924. Her marriage with Gottschalk ended in divorce in 1925, at the end of which year she went to England at the invitation of Robert Graves and his wife Nancy Nicholson. She would remain in Europe for nearly fourteen years.

The excitement stirred by Laura Riding&#x27;s poems is hinted at in Sonia Raiziss&#x27; later description: &quot;When &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1922–1925) flashed down the new sky of American poetry, it left a brilliant scatter of names: Ransom, Tate, Warren, Riding, Crane... Among them, the inner circle and those tangent to it as contributors, there was no one quite like Laura Riding.&quot; (&quot;An Appreciation,&quot; &quot;Chelsea 12&quot; 1962, 28.) Riding&#x27;s first collection of poetry, &quot;The Close Chaplet&quot;, was published in 1926, and during the following year she assumed the surname Riding. By this time the originality of her poetry was becoming ever more evident: generally she favoured a distinctive form of free verse over conventional metres. She, Robert Graves and Nancy Nicholson lived in London until Riding&#x27;s suicide attempt in 1929. It is generally agreed that this episode was a major cause of the break-up of Graves&#x27;s first marriage: the whole affair caused a famous literary scandal.

When Riding met the Irish poet, Geoffrey Phibbs, in 1929, she invited him to join the household that already contained herself, Graves, and Graves&#x27;s wife, Nancy. Phibbs agreed, but after a few months changed his mind and returned to his wife, referring to Riding as &quot;a virago&quot; in a letter to his friend Thomas MacGreevy. When they failed to effect a reconciliation, he rejoined the household but rejected Laura and moved in with Nancy. This was one of the catalysts for the incident of 27 April 1929, when Riding jumped from a fourth-floor window (or, according to Timothy Sandefur, 2019, “a second-storey window”) at the lodgings she shared with Graves, at the height of an argument involving Graves, Phibbs and Nancy Graves; having failed to stop her, Graves also jumped (from a lower floor), but was unharmed, whilst Riding sustained life-threatening injuries.

Following the break-up with Nancy, until the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Riding and Graves lived in Deià, Majorca, where they were visited by writers and artists including James Reeves, Norman Cameron, John Aldridge, Len Lye, Jacob Bronowski and Honor Wyatt. The house is now a museum.

Riding and Graves were highly productive from the start of their association, though after they moved to Majorca they became even more so. While still in London they had set up (1927) the Seizin Press, collaborated on &quot;A Survey of Modernist Poetry&quot; (1927) (which inspired William Empson to write &quot;Seven Types of Ambiguity&quot; and was in some respects the seed of the New Criticism), &quot;A Pamphlet Against Anthologies&quot; (1928) and other works. &quot;Progress of Stories&quot; (1935) would later be highly esteemed by, among others, John Ashbery and Harry Mathews. In Majorca, the Seizin Press was enlarged to become a publishing imprint, producing &quot;inter alia&quot; the substantial hardbound critical magazine &quot;Epilogue&quot; (1935–1938), edited by Riding with Graves as associate editor.

Graves and Riding left Majorca in 1936, at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. Between 1936 and 1939, Riding and Graves lived in England, France and Switzerland. Throughout their association both steadily produced volumes of major poetry, culminating for each with a &quot;Collected Poems&quot; in 1938. In 1939, they moved to the United States and took lodging in New Hope, Pennsylvania. Their changing relationship is described by Elizabeth Friedmann in &quot;A Mannered Grace&quot;, by Richard Perceval Graves in &quot;Robert Graves: 1927–1940, The Years with Laura&quot; and by T. S. Matthews in &quot;Jacks or Better&quot; (1977; UK edition published as &quot;Under the Influence&quot;, 1979) and also was the basis for Miranda Seymour&#x27;s novel &quot;The Summer of &#x27;39&quot; (1998). In 1939 Riding and Graves parted and in 1941 she married Schuyler B. Jackson, eventually settling in Wabasso, Florida, where she lived quietly and simply until her death in 1991, Schuyler having died in 1968. The vernacular cracker house in which they lived has been renovated and preserved by the Laura Riding Jackson Foundation at the Vero Beach campus of Indian River State College.

According to Graves&#x27; biographer Richard Perceval Graves, Riding played a crucial role in the development of Graves&#x27; thoughts when writing his book &quot;The White Goddess&quot;, despite the fact the two were estranged at that point. Riding Jackson later said, &quot;As to the ‘White Goddess’ identity: the White Goddess theme was a spiritually, literarily and scholastically fraudulent improvisation by Robert Graves into the ornate pretentious framework of which he stuffed stolen substance of my writings, and my thought generally, on poetry, woman, cosmic actualities and the history of religious conceptions.&quot; She had already written to the Editor of the &quot;Minnesota Review&quot;, in 1967, about how Graves had used her as a source: &quot;In my thinking, the categorically separated functions termed intellectual, moral, spiritual, emotional, were brought into union, into joint immediacy; other conceptions put the sun and moon in their right rational places as emblems of poetic emotionalism, and lengthened the perspective of Origin back from the skimpy historical heavens of masculine divinity through a spacious dominion of religious symbolism, pre-sided over, for the sake of poetic justice, by a thing I called mother-god.&quot;

===Renunciation of poetry===
In about 1941, Riding renounced poetry, but it was fifteen to twenty years before she felt able to begin explaining her reasons and exploring her unfolding findings. She withdrew from public literary life, working with Schuyler Jackson on a dictionary (published posthumously in 1997) that would lead them into an exploration of the foundations of meaning and language. In April 1962, she read &quot;Introduction for a Broadcast&quot; for the BBC Third Programme, her first formal statement of her reasons for renouncing poetry (there had been a brief reference book entry in 1955). An expanded version of the piece was published that year in the New York magazine &quot;Chelsea&quot;, which also published &quot;Further on Poetry&quot; in 1964, writings on the theme of women-and-men in 1965 and 1974 and in 1967, &quot;The Telling&quot;.

===Later writings===
The 62 numbered passages of &quot;The Telling&quot;, a &quot;personal evangel&quot;, formed the &quot;core part&quot; of a book of the same title, thought by some to be her most important book alongside &quot;Collected Poems&quot;. Writings and publications continued to flow throughout the sixties, seventies and eighties, as Laura (Riding) Jackson (her authorial name from 1963 onwards) explored what she regarded as the truth-potential of language, free from the artificial restrictions of poetic art. &quot;My faith in poetry was at heart a faith in language as the elementary wisdom,&quot; she had written in 1976 (&quot;The Road To, In, And Away From, Poetry&quot;, &quot;Reader&quot; 251). Her later writings attest to what she regarded as the truth-potential contained in language and in the human mind. She might be regarded as a spiritual teacher whose unusually high valuation of language, led her to choose literature as the locus of her work. Two issues of &quot;Chelsea&quot; were given over to new writings by her, &quot;It Has Taken Long&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Sufficient Difference&quot; (2001).

She was awarded the Bollingen Prize in 1991.

She died of cardiac arrest on September 2, 1991.

== Reception and legacy ==
Publication of her work has continued since her death in 1991, including &quot;First Awakenings&quot; (early poems, 1992), &quot;Rational Meaning: A New Foundation for the Definition of Words&quot; (1997), &quot;The Poems of Laura Riding, A Newly Revised Edition of the 1938/1980 Collection&quot; (2001), &quot;Under the Mind&#x27;s Watch&quot; (2004), &quot;The Failure of Poetry, The Promise of Language&quot; (2007), and &quot;On the Continuing of the Continuing&quot; (2008). Trent Editions published a number of her works, beginning with the two-volume edition of her literary memoirs, &quot;The Person I Am&quot; (2011), following which four early collections of her poetry were edited and re-published with lengthy introductions: &quot;The Close Chaplet&quot; (1926), &quot;Love as Love, Death as Death&quot; (1928), &quot;Poet: A Lying Word&quot; (1933), and &quot;Poems: A Joking Word&quot; (1930). Ugly Duckling Presse has also re-published some of her work.

Paul Auster in the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; called her &quot;an important force of the international avant-garde&quot;.

Her poems also had many detractors, such as John Gould Fletcher, William Carlos Williams, Virginia Woolf, Louise Bogan, Dorothy L. Sayers and Dudley Fitts.

Her works have been translated to French, German, Spanish, Danish, Polish, Portuguese and Norwegian (by Terje Dragseth).

<text>Guthrum (, – c. 890) was King of East Anglia in the late 9th century. Originally a native of Denmark, he was one of the leaders of the &quot;Great Summer Army&quot; that arrived in Reading during April 871 to join forces with the Great Heathen Army, whose intentions were to conquer the kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England. The combined armies were successful in conquering the kingdoms of East Anglia, Northumbria, and parts of Mercia, and overran Alfred the Great&#x27;s Wessex, but were ultimately defeated by Alfred at the Battle of Edington in 878. The Danes retreated to their stronghold, where Alfred laid siege and eventually Guthrum surrendered.

Under the terms of his surrender, Guthrum was obliged to be baptised as a Christian to endorse the agreement and then leave Wessex. The subsequent Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum set out the boundaries between Alfred and Guthrum&#x27;s territories, as well as agreements on peaceful trade and the &quot;weregild&quot; value of its people. This treaty is seen as the foundation of the Danelaw. Guthrum ruled East Anglia under his baptismal name of Æthelstan until his death.

==Background==
Viking raids began in England in the late 8th century. The first one probably took place in either 787 or 789. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; for 787 says that:
Small-scale raiding of the English kingdoms continued on and off until 865, when a much larger army landed in East Anglia with the intention of invading and conquering. This initial army was reinforced in 871 by the Great Summer Army ().

==The Great Army==
Guthrum, a nephew of Horik II of Denmark and a failed candidate for a share of the Danish throne, was one of the leaders of the Great Summer Army, which in April 871 joined forces with the &quot;Great Danish Army&quot; based at Reading. The combined army had several military engagements with the West Saxons before wintering in London in 871–872. Coins minted in London during this period bear the name Halfdan, identifying him as its leader.

In the autumn of 872, the Great Army returned to Northumbria to quell a revolt against its puppet-regent Ecgberht I of Northumbria. The Army overwintered at Torksey, and was then reported as being in the Repton district a year later. It conquered Mercia in 874, with Burgred of Mercia being deposed and replaced by a Danish puppet-regent, Ceolwulf.

Following this victory, the Great Army split in two – one half under Halfdan heading north to fight against the Picts and Britons of Strathclyde, and the other half under Guthrum heading south to continue fighting against Wessex.

==Surprise attack==

On Epiphany, 6 January 878, Guthrum made a surprise nighttime attack on Alfred and his court at Chippenham. It being an important feast day in the Christian liturgical year, the Saxons were presumably taken by surprise—indeed it is possible that Wulfhere, Ealdorman of Wiltshire, allowed the attack through either negligence or intent, for, on Alfred&#x27;s return to power later in 878, Wulfhere and his wife were stripped of their lands.

Alfred fled the attack with a few retainers and took shelter in the marshes of Somerset, staying in the small village of Athelney. Over the next few months, according to the &quot;Anglo Saxon Chronicle&quot;, he built up his force and waged a guerrilla war against Guthrum:

After a few months, Alfred called his loyal men to Egbert&#x27;s Stone, and from there they travelled to Edington to fight the invaders.

==Defeat by Alfred==

In 878, Alfred the Great defeated the Viking Army at the Battle of Edington. Guthrum subsequently retreated with the remnants of his army to their &quot;stronghold&quot;; Alfred pursued and besieged him for fourteen days. Guthrum eventually gave in, and a truce was negotiated. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records the terms of the surrender:

==Conversion to Christianity and peace==
Under the terms of his surrender, Guthrum was obliged to be baptised in the Christian faith and then with his army leave Wessex. This agreement is known as the Treaty of Wedmore. Another treaty soon followed that set out the boundaries between Alfred and Guthrum&#x27;s territories as well as agreements on peaceful trade, and the &quot;weregild&quot; value of its people. This is known as the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum.

Guthrum returned to East Anglia, and although there are records of Viking raiding parties in the 880s, Guthrum ceased to be a threat and ruled for more than ten years as a Christian king for his Saxon vassals and simultaneously as a Norse king for his Viking ones. He had coins minted that bore his baptismal name of 
Æthelstan. On his death in 890, the &quot;Annals of St Neots&quot;, a chronicle compiled at Bury St Edmunds in the 12th century, recorded that Guthrum was buried at Hadleigh, Suffolk.
==In popular culture==
Guthrum appears or is mentioned in several works of fiction, including:

*G. K. Chesterton&#x27;s poem &quot;The Ballad of the White Horse&quot;.
*C. Walter Hodges&#x27; juvenile historical novels &quot;The Namesake&quot; and &quot;The Marsh King&quot;.
*The first three volumes of &quot;The Saxon Stories&quot;, a series of historical novels by Bernard Cornwell: &quot;The Last Kingdom&quot;, &quot;The Pale Horseman&quot;, and &quot;The Lords of the North&quot;.

On screen, he has been portrayed by Brian Blessed in episode 4 (&quot;King Alfred&quot;) of &quot;Churchill&#x27;s People&quot;; by Michael York in the 1969 film &quot;Alfred the Great&quot;; and by Thomas W. Gabrielsson in the BBC and Netflix original television series &quot;The Last Kingdom&quot;.

Guthrum appears in a number of video games that are set during the Viking Age. He is the leader of the &quot;East Engle&quot; faction in the 2018 strategy video game &quot;Total War Saga: Thrones of Britannia&quot;. He is an ally of the Norse &quot;drengr&quot; Eivor in the 2020 video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Valhalla,&quot; as well as a playable character in the game&#x27;s Discovery Tour mode. He also appears in the 2012 grand strategy game &quot;Crusader Kings II&quot; as an unlanded, unplayable character (named &quot;Guttorm&quot;) in the 867 start date at the court of Þorfinn, the ruler of Vermaland in modern-day Sweden.

It is implied that the &quot;Vikings&quot; character Hvitserk would be the same as the historical Guthrum (despite a previous character having this name) after he is baptized as Athelstan and made a “Saxon prince” by King Alfred.
