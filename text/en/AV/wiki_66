<text>Hiram King &quot;Hank&quot; Williams (September 17, 1923 – January 1, 1953) was an American singer-songwriter. He is regarded as one of the most significant and influential American singers and songwriters of the 20th century. Williams recorded 55 singles that reached the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country &amp; Western Best Sellers chart, five of which were released posthumously, and 12 of which reached No.1.

Born and raised in Alabama, Williams learned guitar from African-American blues musician Rufus Payne. Both Payne and Roy Acuff significantly influenced his musical style. After winning an amateur talent contest, Williams began his professional career in Montgomery in the late 1930s playing on local radio stations and at area venues such as school houses, movie theaters, and bars. He formed the Drifting Cowboys backup band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career. Because his alcoholism made him unreliable, he was fired and rehired several times by radio station WSFA, and had trouble replacing several of his band members who were drafted during World War II.

In 1944, Williams married Audrey Sheppard, who competed with his mother to control his career. After recording &quot;Never Again&quot; and &quot;Honky Tonkin&#x27; with Sterling Records, he signed a contract with MGM Records. He released the hit single &quot;Move It On Over&quot; in 1947 and joined the &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; radio program. The next year he released a cover of &quot;Lovesick Blues&quot;, which quickly reached number one on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country &amp; Western singles chart and propelled him to stardom on the Grand Ole Opry. Although unable to read or notate music to any significant degree, he wrote such iconic hits as &quot;Your Cheatin&#x27; Heart&quot;, &quot;Hey, Good Lookin&#x27;, and &quot;I&#x27;m So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot;. In 1952, Audrey divorced him and he married Billie Jean Jones. He was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcoholism.

Years of back pain, alcoholism, and prescription drug abuse severely compromised Williams&#x27;s health, and at the age of 29, Williams suffered from heart failure and died unexpectedly in the back seat of a car near Oak Hill, West Virginia, en route to a concert in Canton, Ohio, on New Year&#x27;s Day 1953. Despite his relatively brief career, he is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century, especially in country music. Many artists have covered his songs and he has influenced Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, and the Rolling Stones, among others. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1961, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, the Native American Music Awards Hall of Fame in 1999, and gained a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2010, he was posthumously awarded a Pulitzer Prize Special Citation for his &quot;craftsmanship as a songwriter who expressed universal feelings with poignant simplicity and played a pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life.&quot;

==Early life==
Williams was born on September 17, 1923, in the rural community of Mount Olive in Butler County, Alabama. He was the third child of Jessie Lillybelle &quot;Lillie&quot; (née Skipper; 1898–1955) and Elonzo Huble &quot;Lon&quot; Williams (1891–1970). Williams was of English ancestry and Welsh ancestry. Elonzo&#x27;s family came from south and central Alabama, and his father fought during the American Civil War, first on the Confederate side, and then with the Union after he was captured. Elonzo was a railroad engineer for the W. T. Smith lumber company and was drafted during World War I, serving from July 1918 to June 1919. He suffered severe injuries after falling from a truck, breaking his collarbone, and receiving a severe blow to the head.

The Williams&#x27; first child, Ernest Huble Williams, died two days after his birth on July 5, 1921. A daughter, Irene, was born a year later. Williams was named after Hiram I of the Book of Kings. His name was misspelled as &quot;Hiriam&quot; on his birth certificate, which was prepared and signed when he was 10 years old. Williams was born with spina bifida occulta, a birth defect of the spinal column that caused him lifelong pain and became a major factor in his later alcohol and drug abuse. At the age of three, Williams sat with his mother as she played the organ at the Mount Olive Baptist Church. Lillie also joined singing the hymns that influenced the singer&#x27;s later compositions. Williams received his first musical instrument, a harmonica, at the age of six. As a child, he was nicknamed &quot;Harm&quot; by his family and &quot;Herky&quot; or &quot;Skeets&quot; by his friends.

Williams&#x27;s father frequently relocated for work, and as a result the family lived in several southern Alabama towns. In 1930, when Williams was seven years old, Elonzo began experiencing facial paralysis. After being evaluated at a Veterans Affairs clinic in Pensacola, Florida, doctors determined that he had a brain aneurysm, and Elonzo was sent to the VA Medical Center in Alexandria, Louisiana. He remained hospitalized for eight years and was mostly absent throughout Williams&#x27;s childhood. From that point on, Lillie assumed responsibility for the family.

In the fall of 1933, Williams was sent to live with his aunt and uncle, Walter and Alice McNeil, in Fountain, Alabama. Their daughter, Opal, went in exchange to live with Lillie to attend school in Georgiana, Alabama. Williams learned to play basic guitar chords from his aunt and listened to music that was played at dances and in area churches. The following year, the Williams family moved to Greenville, Alabama, where Lillie opened a boarding house next to the local cotton gin. The family later returned with Opal McNeil to Georgiana, where Lillie took several side jobs to support the family despite the bleak economic climate of the Great Depression. She worked in a cannery and served as a night-shift nurse in the local hospital. Their first house burned down, and the family lost their possessions. They moved to Rose Street on the other side of town, into a house which Williams&#x27;s mother soon turned into another boarding house. The house had a small garden in which they grew diverse crops that Williams and his sister Irene sold around Georgiana. At a chance meeting in Georgiana, Williams&#x27;s sister Irene met U.S. Representative J. Lister Hill while Hill was campaigning across Alabama. She told Hill that her mother was interested in talking to him about her problems. With Hill&#x27;s help, the family began collecting Elonzo&#x27;s disability pension. Despite his medical condition, the family managed fairly well financially throughout the Great Depression.

There are several versions of how Williams got his first guitar. While several prominent Georgiana residents later claimed to have bought it for him, his mother said she bought it for him and that she arranged for his first lessons. Williams told Ralph Gleason, who at the time was writing a weekly music column in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, &quot;When I was about eight years old, I got my first git-tar. A second-hand $3.50 git-tar my mother bought me.&quot; Gawky and shy, Williams attached himself to an old black man, Rufus &quot;Tee-Tot&quot; Payne, a street performer whom Williams followed around town. Payne gave Williams guitar lessons in exchange for money or meals prepared by Lillie. Payne&#x27;s basic musical style was blues; he repeatedly stressed the importance of maintaining good rhythm and time, and he added the showmanship of stoops, bows, laughs and cries to his performances. Later on, Williams recorded &quot;My Bucket&#x27;s Got a Hole in It&quot;, one of the songs Payne had taught him. Williams was also influenced by country acts such as Roy Acuff. In 1937, Williams got into a fight with his physical education teacher about exercises the coach wanted him to do. His mother subsequently demanded that the school board terminate the coach; when they refused, the family moved to Montgomery, Alabama. Payne and Williams lost touch, though Payne also eventually moved to Montgomery, where he died in poverty in 1939. Williams later credited him as the provider of the only musical training he ever had.

==Career==
===1930s===
In July 1937, the Williams and McNeils opened a boarding house on South Perry Street in downtown Montgomery. It was at this time that Williams decided to change his name informally from Hiram to Hank. During the same year, he participated in a talent show at the Empire Theater and won the first prize of US$15 () singing his first original song &quot;WPA Blues&quot;. Williams wrote the lyrics and used the tune of Riley Puckett&#x27;s &quot;Dissatisfied&quot;.

He never learned to read music; instead he based his compositions in storytelling and personal experience.
After school and on weekends, Williams sang and played his Silvertone guitar on the sidewalk in front of the WSFA radio studio. His recent win at the Empire Theater and the street performances caught the attention of WSFA producers who occasionally invited him to perform on air with Dad Crysel&#x27;s band.

In August 1938, Elonzo Williams was temporarily released from the hospital. He showed up unannounced at the family&#x27;s home in Montgomery. Lillie was unwilling to let him reclaim his position as the head of the household. Elonzo stayed to celebrate his son&#x27;s birthday in September before he returned to the medical center in Louisiana.

Williams&#x27;s successful radio appearances fueled his entry into a music career, and he started his own band for show dates, the Drifting Cowboys. The original members were guitarist Braxton Schuffert, fiddler Freddie Beach, and upright bass player and comedian Smith &quot;Hezzy&quot; Adair. Originally billed as &quot;Hank and Hezzy and the Drifting Cowboys&quot;, they frequently appeared as fill-ins at the local dancehall, Thigpen&#x27;s Log Cabin, just out of Georgiana. The band traveled throughout central and southern Alabama performing in clubs and at private gatherings. Lillie Williams became the Drifting Cowboys&#x27; manager. Williams dropped out of school in October 1939 so that he and the Drifting Cowboys could work full-time. Lillie Williams began booking show dates, negotiating prices and driving them to some of their shows. Now free to travel without deference to Williams&#x27;s schooling, the band could tour as far away as western Georgia and the Florida Panhandle. The band started playing in theaters before the screening of films and later they played in honky-tonks. Williams&#x27;s alcohol use started to become a problem during the tours; on occasion he spent a large part of the show revenues on alcohol. Meanwhile, between tour schedules, Williams returned to Montgomery to host his radio show.

===1940s===

The American entry into World War II in 1941 marked the beginning of hard times for Williams. While he was medically disqualified from military service after falling from a bull during a rodeo in Texas and suffering a back injury, his band members were all drafted to serve. Many of their replacements quit the band due to Williams&#x27;s worsening alcoholism, and in August 1942 WSFA fired him for &quot;habitual drunkenness&quot;. Backstage during one of his concerts, Williams met Roy Acuff, who warned him of the dangers of alcohol, saying, &quot;You&#x27;ve got a million-dollar voice, son, but a ten-cent brain.&quot;

He started a job as a shipfitter&#x27;s helper for the Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company at Mobile in 1942, working there off and on for about a year and a half during the war. He also worked briefly at Kaiser Shipyards in Portland, Oregon, apparently lured by the free tickets, free accommodations, free training, and good wages offered by the company. In 1943, Williams met Audrey Sheppard at a medicine show in Banks, Alabama. According to Sheppard, she and Williams lived in a hotel in Mobile while they worked together at the shipyard for a short while. Sheppard told Williams that she wanted to help him regain his radio show, and that they should move to Montgomery and start a band. The couple were married in 1944 at a Texaco gas station in Andalusia, Alabama, by a justice of the peace. The marriage was technically invalid, since Sheppard&#x27;s divorce from her previous husband did not comply with the legally required 60-day reconciliation period.

In 1945, back in Montgomery, Williams returned to WSFA radio. He attempted to expand his repertoire by writing original songs, and he published his first songbook, &quot;Original Songs of Hank Williams&quot;, containing &quot;I&#x27;m Not Coming Home Anymore&quot; and several more original songs, nine in all, including one not written by him, &quot;A Tramp on the Street&quot;. With Williams beginning to be recognized as a songwriter, Sheppard became his manager and occasionally sang and substituted on guitar when a band member did not make the show.

On September 14, 1946, Williams auditioned for Nashville&#x27;s Grand Ole Opry at the recommendation of Ernest Tubb, but was rejected. After the failure of his audition, Williams and Audrey attempted to interest the recently formed music publishing firm Acuff-Rose Music. They approached Fred Rose, the president of the company, during one of his daily ping-pong games at WSM radio studios. Audrey asked Rose if her husband could sing a song for him at that moment, Rose agreed, and perceived that Williams had much promise as a songwriter. Rose signed Williams to a six-song contract, and leveraged this deal to sign Williams with Sterling Records. On December 11, 1946, in his first recording session, Williams recorded &quot;Wealth Won&#x27;t Save Your Soul&quot;, &quot;Calling You&quot;, &quot;Never Again (Will I Knock on Your Door)&quot;, and &quot;When God Comes and Gathers His Jewels&quot;, which was misprinted as &quot;When God Comes and &quot;Fathers&quot; His Jewels&quot;. The Sterling releases of Williams&#x27;s songs became successful, and Rose decided to find a larger label for future releases. The producer then approached the newly formed recording division of the Loews Corporation, MGM Records.
Williams signed with MGM Records in 1947 and released &quot;Move It on Over&quot;, which became a country hit. In 1948, he moved to Shreveport, Louisiana, and joined the &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot;, a radio show broadcast on KWKH that brought him into living rooms all over the Southeastern United States, appearing in weekend shows. As part of the arrangement, Williams got a program on the station and bookings through the &quot;Hayride&quot; artist service to perform across western Louisiana and eastern Texas, always returning on Saturdays for the show&#x27;s weekly broadcast. After a few more moderate hits, in 1949 he released his version of the 1922 Cliff Friend and Irving Mills song &quot;Lovesick Blues&quot;, made popular by Rex Griffin. Williams&#x27;s version was a hit; the song stayed at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts for four consecutive months. Following the success of the releases of &quot;Lovesick Blues&quot; and &quot;Wedding Bells&quot;, Williams signed a management contract with Oscar Davis. Davis then booked the singer on a &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; package show, and he later negotiated Williams&#x27;s induction into the musical troupe.

On June 11, 1949, Williams made his debut at the Grand Ole Opry, where he received six encores. He brought together Bob McNett (guitar), Hillous Butrum (bass), Jerry Rivers (fiddle) and Don Helms (steel guitar) to form the most famous version of the Drifting Cowboys. That year Audrey Williams gave birth to Randall Hank Williams (Hank Williams Jr.). During 1949, he joined the Grand Ole Opry&#x27;s first European tour, performing in military bases in Germany and Austria. Williams had five songs that ranked in the top five &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles that year including: &quot;Wedding Bells&quot;, &quot;Mind Your Own Business&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Change (Or I&#x27;m Gonna Leave)&quot;, &quot;My Bucket&#x27;s Got a Hole in It&quot;, and &quot;Lovesick Blues&quot;, which reached No. 1.

===1950s===
By 1950, Williams earned an estimated $1,000 per show (). That year, he began recording as &quot;Luke the Drifter&quot; for his moral-themed songs, many of which are recitations rather than singing. Fred Rose had been concerned how it would affect the jukebox operators who serviced the machines at the honky-tonks where William&#x27;s songs were most commonly played if a customer punched a &quot;Hank Williams&quot; selection on a jukebox and heard a sermon rather than the music expected. It was he who requested that Hank use a pseudonym for these recitations to avoid leading people astray. Although the real identity of Luke the Drifter was supposed to be unknown, Williams often performed part of the recorded material on stage. Most of the material was written by Williams himself, although Fred Rose wrote at least one piece, and others, according to his son Wesley, were collaborations between Williams, Rose, and himself. The songs depicted Luke the Drifter traveling around from place to place, narrating stories of different characters and philosophizing about relationships gone awry, injustice in society, and death. Performances of the compositions included only Williams&#x27;s voice, an organ, a bass fiddle, and Helms&#x27; steel guitar.

Around this time Williams released more hit songs, such as &quot;My Son Calls Another Man Daddy&quot;, &quot;Why Should We Try Anymore&quot;, &quot;Long Gone Lonesome Blues&quot;, &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Love Me&quot;, and &quot;I Just Don&#x27;t Like This Kind of Livin&#x27;&quot;. In 1951, &quot;Dear John&quot; became a hit, but it was the B-side, &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot;, that became one of his most recognized songs. A pop cover version by Tony Bennett released the same year stayed on the charts for 27 weeks, peaking at number one.
Williams&#x27;s career reached a peak in the late summer of 1951 with his Hadacol tour of the U.S. with Bob Hope and other actors. On the weekend after the tour ended, Williams was photographed backstage at the Grand Ole Opry signing a motion picture deal with MGM. In October, Williams recorded a demo, &quot;There&#x27;s a Tear in My Beer&quot; for a friend, &quot;Big Bill Lister&quot;, who had recorded &quot;Beer Drinking Blues&quot;, a beer drinking song that sold well, and needed another one. The session was recorded by the head of A&amp;R for Capitol Records, Ken Nelson. Afterwards Lister stored the demo acetate, with no markings, in a box of records kept at his house, and then when he moved, in his yard under a tarp for several years. He eventually gave the acetate to Hank Williams, Jr., who had a hit with it and an accompanying video which depicted the son playing with his father in an overdubbed dream sequence. The following month, MGM Records released Williams&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Hank Williams Sings&quot;. On November 14, 1951, Williams drove with Bill Lister and the Drifting Cowboys to New York where he appeared on television for the first time with Perry Como on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Perry Como Show&quot;. There he sang &quot;Hey Good Lookin&#x27;&quot;, and the next week Como opened the show wearing a cowboy hat and singing the same song, with apologies to Williams.

On May 21, 1951, Williams was admitted to North Louisiana Sanitarium in Shreveport for treatment of his alcoholism and his back problem, and was released on May 24. In November of the same year, he fell trying to leap across a gully on a squirrel hunting trip with his fiddler Jerry Rivers in Franklin, Tennessee. The fall aggravated his congenital spinal condition, and on December 13, 1951, he underwent a spinal fusion at Vanderbilt University Hospital. He was discharged against medical advice on Christmas Eve wearing a back brace and consuming more painkillers, to the detriment of his already compromised health.

In the spring of 1952, Williams flew to New York City twice with his band and a Grand Ole Opry troupe to appear on two episodes of the nationally broadcast &quot;The Kate Smith Evening Hour&quot;. On March 26, he performed &quot;Hey Good Lookin&#x27;&quot; and joined the rest of the cast in singing &quot;I Saw the Light&quot;. On April 23, he performed &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot; and sang a truncated &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help It (If I&#x27;m Still in Love with You)&quot; with Anita Carter, and later joined the cast in singing &quot;Glory Bound Train&quot;. During the same year, Williams had a brief extramarital affair with dancer Bobbie Jett, resulting in the birth of their daughter, Jett Williams.

In June 1952, he recorded &quot;Jambalaya (On the Bayou)&quot;, &quot;Window Shopping&quot;, &quot;Settin&#x27; the Woods on Fire&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Get Out of This World Alive&quot;. Audrey Williams divorced him that year; the next day he recorded &quot;You Win Again&quot; and &quot;I Won&#x27;t Be Home No More&quot;. Around this time, he met Billie Jean Jones, a girlfriend of country singer Faron Young, at the Grand Ole Opry. As a girl, Jones had lived down the street from Williams when he was with the Louisiana Hayride, and now Williams began to visit her frequently in Shreveport, causing him to miss many Grand Ole Opry appearances.

On August 11, 1952, Williams was dismissed from the Grand Ole Opry for habitual drunkenness and missing shows. He returned to Shreveport to perform on KWKH and WBAM shows and in the &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot;, for which he toured again. His performances were acclaimed when he was sober, but despite the efforts of his work associates to get him to shows sober, his abuse of alcohol resulted in occasions when he did not appear or his performances were poor. In October 1952 he married Billie Jean Jones.

During his last recording session on September 23, 1952, Williams recorded &quot;Kaw-Liga&quot;, along with &quot;Your Cheatin&#x27; Heart&quot;, &quot;Take These Chains from My Heart&quot;, and &quot;I Could Never Be Ashamed of You&quot;. By the end of 1952, Williams started to have heart problems. He met Horace &quot;Toby&quot; Marshall in Oklahoma City, who said that he was a doctor. Marshall had been previously convicted for forgery, and had been paroled and released from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in 1951. Among other fake titles, he said that he was a Doctor of Science. He purchased the DSC title for $25 from the &quot;Chicago School of Applied Science&quot;; in the diploma, he requested that the DSc be spelled out as &quot;Doctor of Science and Psychology&quot;. Under the name of Dr. C. W. Lemon he prescribed Williams with amphetamines, Seconal, chloral hydrate, and morphine, which made his heart problems worse. The final concert of his 1952 tour was held in Austin, Texas, at the Skyline Club on December 19. Williams&#x27;s last known public performance took place in Montgomery, on December 21, where he sang at a benefit held by the local chapter of the American Federation of Musicians for a radio announcer who had polio.

==Personal life==

On December 15, 1944, Williams married Audrey Sheppard. It was her second marriage and his first. Their son, Randall Hank Williams (now known as Hank Williams Jr.), was born on May 26, 1949. The marriage was always turbulent and rapidly disintegrated, and Williams developed serious problems with alcohol, morphine, and other painkillers prescribed for him to ease the severe back pain caused by his spina bifida occulta. The couple divorced on May 29, 1952.

In June 1952, Williams moved into a house on the corner of Natchez Trace and Westwood Avenue in Nashville, sharing it with singer Ray Price. Price left soon after due to Williams&#x27;s alcoholism. Following an unsuccessful tour of California and several stints in a sanitorium, Williams moved to his mother&#x27;s boardinghouse by September. A relationship with a woman named Bobbie Jett during this period resulted in a daughter, Jett Williams, who was born five days after Williams died.
His mother adopted Jett, who became a ward of the state after her grandmother&#x27;s death. She was adopted and raised by an unrelated couple and did not learn that she was Williams&#x27;s daughter until the early 1980s.

On October 18, 1952, Williams and Billie Jean Jones were married by a justice of the peace in Minden, Louisiana. The next day, two public marriage ceremonies were held at the New Orleans Civic Auditorium, where 14,000 seats were sold for each. After Williams&#x27;s death, a judge ruled that the wedding was not legal because Jones&#x27; divorce had not become final until 11 days after she married Williams. His first wife and his mother were the driving forces behind having the marriage declared invalid, and they pursued the matter for years.

A man named Lewis Fitzgerald (born 1943) claimed to be Williams&#x27;s illegitimate son; he was the son of Marie McNeil, Williams&#x27;s cousin. Fitzgerald was interviewed, and he suggested that Lillie Williams operated a brothel at her boarding house in Montgomery. A friend of the family denied his claims, but singer Billy Walker claimed that Williams mentioned to him the presence of men in the house who were led upstairs.

==Death==

Williams was scheduled to perform at the Municipal Auditorium in Charleston, West Virginia, on New Years Eve, December 31, 1952. Advance ticket sales totaled $3,000. That day, Williams could not fly because of a snow storm in the Montgomery area; he hired a college student, Charles Carr, to drive him to the concerts. On December 30, Williams and Carr stopped at the Redmont Hotel in Birmingham, Alabama. The following morning, they continued to Fort Payne, and then to Knoxville, Tennessee. Williams and his driver then took a flight to Charleston, but the plane returned to Knoxville due to bad weather. Back in Knoxville, the two arrived at the Andrew Johnson Hotel, and Carr requested a doctor for Williams, who was affected by the combination of the chloral hydrate and alcohol he had consumed on the way to Knoxville. Dr. P. H. Cardwell injected Williams with two shots of vitamin B12 that also contained a quarter-grain of morphine. Carr and Williams checked out of the hotel, but the porters had to carry Williams to the car. Carr later mentioned that Williams had severe hiccups, while the porters said that he had made a coughing sound twice. Carr spoke with Toby Marshall on the phone, who informed him on behalf of the tour&#x27;s promoter, A.V. Bamford, that the show in Charleston was cancelled and he ordered him instead to drive Williams to Canton, Ohio, for a New Year&#x27;s Day concert there.
Around midnight on January 1, 1953, the two crossed the Tennessee state line and arrived in Bristol, Virginia. Carr stopped at a small all-night restaurant and asked for a relief driver from a local taxi company, as he felt exhausted after driving for 20 hours. Driver Don Surface left the restaurant with Carr and Williams. They drove on until they stopped for fuel and coffee at a gas station in Oak Hill, West Virginia, where they realized that Williams had been dead for so long that rigor mortis had already set in. The station&#x27;s owner called the local police chief. Dr. Ivan Malinin performed the autopsy at the Tyree Funeral House. He found hemorrhages in the heart and neck and pronounced the cause of death as &quot;acute rt. ventricular dilation&quot;. He also wrote that Williams had been severely beaten and kicked in the groin recently (during a fight in a Montgomery bar a few days earlier), and local magistrate Virgil F. Lyons ordered an inquest into Williams&#x27;s death concerning a welt that was visible on his head. That evening in Canton, when Williams&#x27;s death was announced to the gathered crowd, a few people started laughing because they thought it was a joke. Akron deejay Cliff Rodgers assured the crowd that it was no joke and that Hank Williams was indeed dead. When Hawkshaw Hawkins and other performers started singing Williams&#x27;s song &quot;I Saw the Light&quot; as a tribute to him, the crowd began to sing along.

On January 2, Williams&#x27;s body was transported to Montgomery, Alabama, where it was placed in a silver casket that was displayed at his mother&#x27;s boarding house for two days. His funeral took place on January 4 at the Montgomery Auditorium, with his casket placed on the flower-covered stage. Mourners came to Montgomery from all over the South, and beyond. An estimated 15,000 to 25,000 people were outside the auditorium, and inside were 2,750, with the balcony set aside for about 200 black mourners. Hundreds passed by the casket. Backed by the Drifting Cowboys, Roy Acuff, Ernest Tubb and Red Foley performed &quot;I Saw the Light&quot;, &quot;Beyond the Sunset&quot; and &quot;Peace in the Valley&quot;. Williams&#x27;s remains are interred at the Oakwood Annex in Montgomery.

In late January 1953, MGM Records told &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine that the label had to reduce their planned releases for the month from 12 records to 6 to satisfy the demand for Williams&#x27;s music. The label estimated that the amount of back orders of his records, and those by other artists would cover the production of their Bloomfield, New Jersey, pressing plant until April 1953. Meanwhile, MGM Records received 3,000 direct requests for pictures of the singer, that combined with the requests from the distributors made the company outsource their printing and shipment. According to Acuff-Rose Music, the sales from the two Williams song folios jumped from their average of 700 per week to 5,000 in three weeks.

Williams&#x27;s final single, released in November 1952 while he was still alive, was titled &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Get Out of This World Alive&quot;. His song &quot;Your Cheatin&#x27; Heart&quot; was written and recorded in September 1952, but released in late January 1953 after his death. The song, backed by &quot;Kaw-Liga&quot;, was No. 1 on the country charts for six weeks. &quot;Take These Chains From My Heart&quot; was released in April 1953 and reached No. 1 on the country charts. Released in July, &quot;I Won&#x27;t Be Home No More&quot; went to No. 4. Meanwhile, &quot;Weary Blues From Waitin&#x27;&quot; reached No. 7.

==Legacy==
The Country Music Hall of Fame stressed that Williams &quot;set the agenda for contemporary country songcraft&quot; and the &quot;standard by which success is measured in country music&quot;. &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; considers him &quot;country music&#x27;s first superstar&quot; and an &quot;immensely talented songwriter and an impassioned vocalist&quot;. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame praised the &quot;straightforward approach&quot; of Williams&#x27;s songs, which they deemed &quot;brutally honest&quot; and written in the &quot;language of the everyman&quot;. To AllMusic, Williams &quot;established the rules for all the country performers who followed him and, in the process, much of popular music&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; TV critic, Ken Tucker, wrote: &quot;despite being a pop-culture titan and rightly dubbed &quot;father of country music&quot;, Hank Williams was possibly the least likable — least warm and sympathetic — figure in modern music. Reeking of self-pity, he wrote and sang some of the greatest woe-is-me music of the century [...] Brimming with an anger that regularly spilled over into misogyny, Williams was also a master of spite&quot;. Hank Williams, Jr. wrote in his autobiography: &quot;To hear the tributes, one would think that the entire city [Nashville] took turns kissing Daddy while he was still alive. [...] While he was alive, he was despised and envied; after he died, he was some kind of saint.&quot;

Alabama governor Gordon Persons officially proclaimed September 21 &quot;Hank Williams Day&quot;. The first celebration, in 1954, featured the unveiling of a monument at the Cramton Bowl that was later placed at the gravesite of Williams. The ceremony featured Ferlin Husky interpreting &quot;I Saw the Light&quot;. Williams had 11 number one country hits in his career (&quot;Lovesick Blues&quot;, &quot;Long Gone Lonesome Blues&quot;, &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Love Me&quot;, &quot;Moanin&#x27; the Blues&quot;, &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot;, &quot;Hey, Good Lookin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Jambalaya (On the Bayou)&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Get Out of This World Alive&quot;, &quot;Kaw-Liga&quot;, &quot;Your Cheatin&#x27; Heart&quot;, and &quot;Take These Chains from My Heart&quot;), as well as many other top 10 hits.

Many artists of the 1950s and 1960s, including Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Bob Dylan, George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Jerry Lee Lewis, Merle Haggard, Gene Vincent, and Ricky Nelson and Conway Twitty were influenced by Williams.

When &quot;Downbeat&quot; magazine took a poll the year after Williams&#x27;s death, he was voted the most popular country and Western performer of all time. On February 8, 1960, Williams&#x27;s star was placed at 6400 Hollywood Boulevard on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1961, and into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame in 1985.

In 1964, the biographical film &quot;Your Cheatin&#x27; Heart&quot; starring George Hamilton as Williams was released. The American Truckers Benevolent Association, a national organization of CB truck drivers, voted &quot;Your Cheatin&#x27; Heart&quot; as their favorite record of all time in the fourth annual Truck Drivers&#x27; Country Music Awards, in 1978. In 1987, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame under the category &quot;Early Influence&quot;, and he was given the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He was ranked second in CMT&#x27;s 40 Greatest Men of Country Music in 2003, behind only Johnny Cash who recorded the song &quot;The Night Hank Williams Came To Town&quot;. His son, Hank Jr., was ranked on the same list. Canadian singer Sneezy Waters performed as Williams in the stage play &quot;Hank Williams: The Show He Never Gave&quot;. A 1980 movie adaptation also starring Waters was produced for television.

In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked him number 74 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2005, the BBC documentary series &quot;Arena&quot; featured an episode on Williams.

In 2010, Williams&#x27;s 1949 MGM number one hit, &quot;Lovesick Blues&quot;, was inducted into the Recording Academy Grammy Hall of Fame. The same year, &quot;Hank Williams: The Complete Mother&#x27;s Best Recordings ...Plus!&quot; was honored with a Grammy nomination for Best Historical Album. In 1999, Williams was inducted into the Native American Music Hall of Fame. On April 12, 2010, the Pulitzer Prize Board awarded Williams a posthumous special citation that paid tribute to his &quot;craftsmanship as a songwriter who expressed universal feelings with poignant simplicity and played a pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life&quot;.
Several of Williams&#x27;s descendants became musicians: son Hank Williams Jr., daughter Jett Williams, grandsons Hank Williams III and Sam Williams, and granddaughters Hilary Williams and Holly Williams are also country musicians. In July 2020, his granddaughter Katherine (Hank Jr.&#x27;s daughter) died in a car crash at the age of 27. His great-grandson Coleman Finchum, son of Hank Williams III, released his debut single credited to IV and the Strange Band in 2021. Meanwhile, Lewis Fitzgerald&#x27;s son Ricky billed himself as Hank Williams IV following his father&#x27;s claim of being Williams&#x27;s son.

According to reportage in the Los Angeles Times, on his road trips Williams carried a brown leather briefcase containing notebooks in which he wrote musings, lines and verses of song lyrics, as well as jottings on whatever had been handy. After he died, the cache of sixty-six unpublished songs in four notebooks was stored in a fireproof vault at the Nashville offices of his publishing firm, Acuff-Rose Publications. The vault was moved in 2002 to the offices of Sony ATV Music when it acquired Acuff-Rose.

After the 2001 tribute album, &quot;Hank Williams: Timeless&quot; won a Grammy Award for country album of the year, there was heightened interest in similar projects. A&amp;R executive Mary Martin, one of the producers of &quot;Timeless&quot;, was consulted about other means of drawing attention to material from the Williams archive. She said that Bob Dylan was given the first opportunity to perform 12 songs for a CD compilation. Dylan approached Williams&#x27;s granddaughter Holly Williams at a show where he gave her a sheaf of song lyrics he wanted her to read. She later said that although Dylan had said nothing about them at first, she recognized them immediately as her grandfather&#x27;s work. He then said he had been asked to possibly cut an entire album, or that he might have other artists perform them. She heard nothing more about it for two years until Mary Martin revived the project and she got a phone call from her publishing company saying it was time for her to pick up some samples of the available material.

Consequently, several other musicians got involved in the project, their main task being to create music that suited the lyrics. Dylan chose a song called &quot;The Love That Faded&quot; and fashioned a &quot;honky-tonk waltz through heartache&quot;, while Holly Williams combed through the songs and songs fragments and chose one called &quot;Blue Is My Heart&quot;, which had only eight lines. She wrote two more and added a bridge. The completed album, named &quot;The Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams&quot;, included the contributions of Bob Dylan and Holly Williams, as well as recordings by Alan Jackson, Jack White, Jakob Dylan, Lucinda Williams, Norah Jones, Vince Gill, Rodney Crowell, Patty Loveless, Levon Helm, Sheryl Crow, and Merle Haggard. The album was released on October 4, 2011.

Material recorded by Williams, originally intended for radio broadcasts to be played when he was on tour or for its distribution to radio stations nationwide, resurfaced over the years. In 1993, a double-disc set of recordings of Williams for the &quot;Health &amp; Happiness Show&quot; was released. Broadcast in 1949, the shows were recorded for the promotion of Hadacol. The set was re-released on &quot;Hank Williams: The Legend Begins&quot; in 2011. The album included the unreleased songs &quot;Fan It&quot; and &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot;, recorded by Williams at age 15; the homemade recordings of him singing &quot;Freight Train Blues&quot;, &quot;New San Antonio Rose&quot;, &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot; and &quot;Greenback Dollar&quot; at age 18; and a recording for the 1951 March of Dimes.

In May 2014, further radio recordings by Williams were released. These were recordings of &quot;The Garden Spot Programs, 1950&quot;, a series of publicity segments for plant nursery Naughton Farms originally aired in 1950. The recordings were found by collector George Gimarc at radio station KSIB in Creston, Iowa. Gimarc contacted Williams&#x27;s daughter Jett, and Colin Escott, a music historian and biographer of Williams. The material was restored and remastered by Michael Graves and released by Omnivore Recordings. The release won a Grammy Award for Best Historical Album.

Williams was portrayed by English actor Tom Hiddleston in the 2016 biopic &quot;I Saw the Light&quot;, based on Colin Escott&#x27;s 1994 book &quot;Hank Williams: The Biography&quot;. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Williams at No. 30 on their list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time. For the 100th anniversary of his birth, the Hank Williams Museum organized a three-day event in Montgomery that consisted of a series of concerts at the Davis Theater at Troy University and a wreath-laying ceremony at Williams&#x27;s graveside as the closing event. At the ceremony, September 17, 2023, was proclaimed Hank Williams Day. Meanwhile, in Nashville, the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum organized a concert featuring artists including Rodney Crowell and Williams&#x27;s grandchildren Holly, Hillary, and Sam among others. On the anniversary, &quot;Billboard&quot; commented that Williams was a &quot;breakthrough songwriter&quot; who &quot;remains a mythological figure&quot;.

===Lawsuits over the estate===
Williams died without leaving a will. In May 1953, Audrey Williams filed a lawsuit in Nashville against MGM Records and Acuff-Rose. The suit demanded that both of the publishing companies continue to pay her half of the royalties from Hank Williams&#x27;s records. Williams had an agreement giving his first wife half of the royalties, but allegedly there was no clarification that the deal was valid after his death. Because Williams left no will, the disposition of the remaining 50 percent was considered uncertain; those involved included Williams&#x27;s second wife, Billie Jean Horton and Williams&#x27;s mother and sister.

At the time of his death, Williams&#x27;s estate was estimated to be US$13,329.25 () between cash, a cashier&#x27;s check and his possessions. Lilly Williams considered the legality of Billie Jean&#x27;s marriage to her son doubtful and she filed for the control of the estate. Billie Jean&#x27;s lawyer argued that although she married Williams ten days before the finalization of her divorce to Harrison Eshlimar, Louisiana law considered the union legal since she married &quot;in good faith&quot;.

Doubtful of the legality of the marriage in Tennessee and Alabama, Lilly Williams and her lawyers made several offers to settle out of court with Billie Jean that reached a final of US$30,000. On August 19, 1953, Billie Jean signed an agreement accepting the money. It required that she stopped making appearances billing herself as &quot;Mrs. Hank Williams&quot;, to reveal the location of Williams&#x27;s Tennessee Walking Horse, and the return of a saddle and three suitcases that belonged to him. With the agreement, Lilly became the legal guardian of the estate on behalf of Hank Williams, Jr.

Soon after giving birth, Bobbie Jett left her and Williams&#x27;s daughter at Lilly&#x27;s boardinghouse. Williams&#x27;s mother expressed to the Montgomery County Department of Public Welfare in January 1953 her intention to adopt the child. While Irene Williams opposed the adoption, Williams&#x27;s mother was granted the custody over the child she renamed &quot;Cathy&quot;. However, upon Lilly&#x27;s death in 1955, Irene Williams assumed control of the estate. She became thus the legal guardian of Williams&#x27;s son, while refusing to adopt Cathy. Irene made an attempt to contact the girl&#x27;s mother, Bobbie Jett, who was at the time married and lived in California. Jett refused to take the child since her husband did not know of the existence of her daughter with Williams. Cathy was then put up for adoption and granted money from the estate of Lilly Williams, to be paid at the age of 21.

In 1963, Wesley Rose contacted Irene regarding the copyright renewals with Acuff-Rose: Rose offered US$25,000 (), which Irene accepted to prevent Williams&#x27;s daughter from making a claim in the future. In 1966, an Alabama judge determined that the guardianship of Williams&#x27;s estate belonged to Irene Williams, and he confirmed the validity of the copyright renewal deal. Cathy&#x27;s adoptive parents were contacted by a lawyer, but they refused to contest the ruling of the court. In 1967, Hank Williams, Jr. was declared the only heir to the estate by a second judge. In 1969, the guardianship of the estate was transferred to lawyer Robert Stewart after Irene was arrested and sentenced to a jail term for possession of cocaine by a Texas court. Hank Williams, Jr. reached legal adulthood in 1970.

On October 22, 1975, a federal judge in Atlanta, Georgia, ruled that Billie Jean Horton was Williams&#x27;s common-law wife, and that part of the copyright renewals of the songs belonged to her. At the age of 21, Cathy learned that Hank Williams was her biological father. In 1981, she found her half-siblings in California, and she learned of a 1952 contract between her biological parents that recognized her as Williams&#x27;s daughter. She also learned that the court decisions of the 1960s ignored her existence. After a decision by the Supreme Court of Alabama in 1989, she was recognized as an heir of the estate of Williams. She later changed her name to Jett Williams.

====WSM&#x27;s &quot;Mother&#x27;s Best Flour&quot;====
In 1951, Williams hosted a 15-minute show for &quot;Mother&#x27;s Best Flour&quot; on WSM radio. Due to Williams&#x27;s tour schedules, some of the shows were previously recorded to be played in his absence. During the mid-1960s, WSM staff photographer Les Leverett rescued acetates that were thrown away by the station. At a later point, the recordings were duplicated. In the 1980s, he shared the acetates with Williams&#x27;s former band member Jerry Rivers. A decade later, Leverett made a deal with former Drifting Cowboy Hillous Brutum, who did not appear on the recordings, for a commercial release of the copies.

The Legacy Entertainment Group, based in Brentwood, Tennessee, was sued by PolyGram and the heirs of Williams to block the release in 1997. While the original acetates of the shows made their way to the possession of Jett Williams, the lawyer of Legacy Entertainment Group claimed that they belonged to the label and he made an attempt to prevent the heirs of Williams to work on their own release of the recordings. Leverett then told &quot;The Tennessean&quot; that the original acetates did not belong to Butrum, and that the two of them made a deal to share the profits of the planned Legacy Entertainment Group release. The Universal Music Group, the parent company of Polygram, then claimed ownership of the shows.

In January 2006, the Tennessee Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling stating that Williams&#x27;s heirs—son, Hank Williams Jr, and daughter, Jett Williams—have the sole rights to sell his recordings. In 2008, Time-Life released &quot;Unreleased Recordings&quot;, a selection of numbers pertaining to the &quot;Mother&#x27;s Best Flour&quot; shows. In 2010, the company released a 15-CD box-set containing all of the recordings remastered by sound engineer Joe Palmaccio entitled &quot;The Complete Mothers&#x27; Best Recordings... Plus!&quot;.

<doc id="163417" wikidata="Q206015" url="?curid=163417" title="The Rite of Spring">
<text>The Rite of Spring () is a ballet and orchestral concert work by the Russian composer Igor Stravinsky. It was written for the 1913 Paris season of Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes company; the original choreography was by Vaslav Nijinsky with stage designs and costumes by Nicholas Roerich. When first performed at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées on 29 May 1913, the avant-garde nature of the music and choreography caused a sensation. Many have called the first-night reaction a &quot;riot&quot; or &quot;near-riot&quot;, though this wording did not come about until reviews of later performances in 1924, over a decade later. Although designed as a work for the stage, with specific passages accompanying characters and action, the music achieved equal if not greater recognition as a concert piece and is widely considered to be one of the most influential musical works of the 20th century.

Stravinsky was a young, virtually unknown composer when Diaghilev recruited him to create works for the Ballets Russes. &quot;Le Sacre du printemps&quot; was the third such major project, after the acclaimed &quot;Firebird&quot; (1910) and &quot;Petrushka&quot; (1911). The concept behind &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, developed by Roerich from Stravinsky&#x27;s outline idea, is suggested by its subtitle, &quot;Pictures of Pagan Russia in Two Parts&quot;; the scenario depicts various primitive rituals celebrating the advent of spring, after which a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death. After a mixed critical reception for its original run and a short London tour, the ballet was not performed again until the 1920s, when a version choreographed by Léonide Massine replaced Nijinsky&#x27;s original, which saw only eight performances. Massine&#x27;s was the forerunner of many innovative productions directed by the world&#x27;s leading choreographers, gaining the work worldwide acceptance. In the 1980s, Nijinsky&#x27;s original choreography, long believed lost, was reconstructed by the Joffrey Ballet in Los Angeles.

Stravinsky&#x27;s score contains many novel features for its time, including experiments in tonality, metre, rhythm, stress and dissonance. Analysts have noted in the score a significant grounding in Russian folk music, a relationship Stravinsky tended to deny. Regarded as among the first modernist works, the music influenced many of the 20th-century&#x27;s leading composers and is one of the most recorded works in the classical repertoire.

== Background ==
Igor Stravinsky was the son of Fyodor Stravinsky, the principal bass singer at the Imperial Opera, Saint Petersburg, and Anna, née Kholodovskaya, a competent amateur singer and pianist from an old-established Russian family. Fyodor&#x27;s association with many of the leading figures in Russian music, including Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin and Mussorgsky, meant that Igor grew up in an intensely musical home. In 1901 Stravinsky began to study law at Saint Petersburg University while taking private lessons in harmony and counterpoint. Stravinsky worked under the guidance of Rimsky-Korsakov, having impressed him with some of his early compositional efforts. By the time of his mentor&#x27;s death in 1908, Stravinsky had produced several works, among them a Piano Sonata in F minor (1903–04), a Symphony in E major (1907), which he catalogued as &quot;Opus 1&quot;, and a short orchestral piece, &quot;Feu d&#x27;artifice&quot; (&quot;Fireworks&quot;, composed in 1908).
In 1909 &quot;Feu d&#x27;artifice&quot; was performed at a concert in Saint Petersburg. Among those in the audience was the impresario Sergei Diaghilev, who at that time was planning to introduce Russian music and art to western audiences. Like Stravinsky, Diaghilev had initially studied law, but had gravitated via journalism into the theatrical world. In 1907 he began his theatrical career by presenting five concerts in Paris; in the following year he introduced Mussorgsky&#x27;s opera &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;. In 1909, still in Paris, he launched the Ballets Russes, initially with Borodin&#x27;s Polovtsian Dances from &quot;Prince Igor&quot; and Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Scheherazade&quot;. To present these works Diaghilev recruited the choreographer Michel Fokine, the designer Léon Bakst and the dancer Vaslav Nijinsky. Diaghilev&#x27;s intention, however, was to produce new works in a distinctively 20th-century style, and he was looking for fresh compositional talent. Having heard &quot;Feu d&#x27;artifice&quot; he approached Stravinsky, initially with a request for help in orchestrating music by Chopin to create new arrangements for the ballet &quot;Les Sylphides&quot;. Stravinsky worked on the opening Nocturne in A-flat major and the closing Grande valse brillante; his reward was a much bigger commission, to write the music for a new ballet, &quot;The Firebird&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;oiseau de feu&quot;) for the 1910 season.

Stravinsky worked through the winter of 1909–10, in close association with Fokine who was choreographing &quot;The Firebird&quot;. During this period Stravinsky made the acquaintance of Nijinsky who, although not dancing in the ballet, was a keen observer of its development. Stravinsky was uncomplimentary when recording his first impressions of the dancer, observing that he seemed immature and gauche for his age (he was 21). On the other hand, Stravinsky found Diaghilev an inspiration, &quot;the very essence of a great personality&quot;. &quot;The Firebird&quot; was premiered on 25 June 1910, with Tamara Karsavina in the main role, and was a great public success. This ensured that the Diaghilev–Stravinsky collaboration would continue, in the first instance with &quot;Petrushka&quot; (1911) and then &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;.

== Synopsis and structure ==
In a note to the conductor Serge Koussevitzky in February 1914, Stravinsky described &quot;Le Sacre du printemps&quot; as &quot;a musical-choreographic work, [representing] pagan Russia ... unified by a single idea: the mystery and great surge of the creative power of Spring&quot;. In his analysis of &quot;The Rite&quot;, Pieter van den Toorn writes that the work lacks a specific plot or narrative, and should be considered as a succession of choreographed episodes.

The French titles are given in the form as written in the four-part piano score published in 1913. There have been numerous variants of the English translations; those shown are from the 1967 edition of the score.

== Creation ==
=== Conception ===

Lawrence Morton, in a study of the origins of &quot;The Rite&quot;, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky&#x27;s collection &quot;Yar&quot;. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is &quot;Yarila&quot; which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: &quot;The likeness is too close to be coincidental&quot;. Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of &quot;The Rite&quot;. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: &quot;One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of &quot;L&#x27;Oiseau de Feu&quot; in Saint Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the &quot;Sacre du printemps&quot;.&quot;

By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev&#x27;s 1909 production of the &quot;Polovtsian Dances&quot;. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, &quot;The Great Sacrifice&quot; (Russian: &quot;Velikaia zhertva&quot;); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet &quot;Petrushka&quot;.

In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev&#x27;s magazine &quot;World of Art&quot;. Here, over several days, Stravinsky and Roerich finalised the structure of the ballet. Thomas F. Kelly, in his history of the &quot;Rite&quot; premiere, suggests that the two-part pagan scenario that emerged was primarily devised by Roerich. Stravinsky later explained to Nikolai Findeyzen, the editor of the &quot;Russian Musical Gazette&quot;, that the first part of the work would be called &quot;The Kiss of the Earth&quot;, and would consist of games and ritual dances interrupted by a procession of sages, culminating in a frenzied dance as the people embraced the spring. Part Two, &quot;The Sacrifice&quot;, would have a darker aspect; secret night games of maidens, leading to the choice of one for sacrifice and her eventual dance to the death before the sages. The original working title was changed to &quot;Holy Spring&quot; (Russian:&quot; Vesna sviashchennaia&quot;), but the work became generally known by the French translation &quot;Le Sacre du printemps&quot;, or its English equivalent &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, with the subtitle &quot;Pictures of Pagan Russia&quot;.

=== Composition ===

Stravinsky&#x27;s sketchbooks show that after returning to his home at Ustilug in Ukraine in September 1911, he worked on two movements, the &quot;Augurs of Spring&quot; and the &quot;Spring Rounds&quot;. In October he left Ustilug for Clarens in Switzerland, where in a tiny and sparsely-furnished room—an closet, with only a muted upright piano, a table and two chairs—he worked throughout the 1911–12 winter on the score. By March 1912, according to the sketchbook chronology, Stravinsky had completed Part I and had drafted much of Part II. He also prepared a two-hand piano version, subsequently lost, which he may have used to demonstrate the work to Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes conductor Pierre Monteux in April 1912. He also made a four-hand piano arrangement which became the first published version of &quot;Le Sacre&quot;; he and the composer Claude Debussy played the first half of this together, in June 1912.

Following Diaghilev&#x27;s decision to delay the premiere until 1913, Stravinsky put &quot;The Rite&quot; aside during the summer of 1912. He enjoyed the Paris season, and accompanied Diaghilev to the Bayreuth Festival to attend a performance of &quot;Parsifal&quot;. Stravinsky resumed work on &quot;The Rite&quot; in the autumn; the sketchbooks indicate that he had finished the outline of the final sacrificial dance on 17 November 1912. During the remaining months of winter he worked on the full orchestral score, which he signed and dated as &quot;completed in Clarens, March 8, 1913&quot;. He showed the manuscript to Maurice Ravel, who was enthusiastic and predicted, in a letter to a friend, that the first performance of &quot;Le Sacre&quot; would be as important as the 1902 premiere of Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;. After the orchestral rehearsals began in late March, Monteux drew the composer&#x27;s attention to several passages which were causing problems: inaudible horns, a flute solo drowned out by brass and strings, and multiple problems with the balance among instruments in the brass section during fortissimo episodes. Stravinsky amended these passages, and as late as April was still revising and rewriting the final bars of the &quot;Sacrificial Dance&quot;. Revision of the score did not end with the version prepared for the 1913 premiere; rather, Stravinsky continued to make changes for the next 30 years or more. According to Van den Toorn, &quot;[n]o other work of Stravinsky&#x27;s underwent such a series of post-premiere revisions&quot;.

Stravinsky acknowledged that the work&#x27;s opening bassoon melody was derived from an anthology of Lithuanian folk songs, but maintained that this was his only borrowing from such sources; if other elements sounded like aboriginal folk music, he said, it was due to &quot;some unconscious &#x27;folk&#x27; memory&quot;. However, Morton has identified several more melodies in Part I as having their origins in the Lithuanian collection. More recently Richard Taruskin discovered in the score an adapted tune from one of Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;One Hundred Russian National Songs&quot;. Taruskin notes the paradox whereby &quot;The Rite&quot;, generally acknowledged as the most revolutionary of the composer&#x27;s early works, is in fact rooted in the traditions of Russian music.

=== Realisation ===

Taruskin has listed a number of sources that Roerich consulted when creating his designs. Among these are the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, a 12th-century compendium of early pagan customs, and Alexander Afanasyev&#x27;s study of peasant folklore and pagan prehistory. The Princess Tenisheva&#x27;s collection of costumes was an early source of inspiration. When the designs were complete, Stravinsky expressed delight and declared them &quot;a real miracle&quot;.

Stravinsky&#x27;s relationship with his other main collaborator, Nijinsky, was more complicated. Diaghilev had decided that
Nijinsky&#x27;s genius as a dancer would translate into the role of choreographer and ballet master; he was not dissuaded when Nijinsky&#x27;s first attempt at choreography, Debussy&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot;, caused controversy and near-scandal because of the dancer&#x27;s novel stylised movements and his overtly sexual gesture at the work&#x27;s end. It is apparent from contemporary correspondence that, at least initially, Stravinsky viewed Nijinsky&#x27;s talents as a choreographer with approval; a letter he sent to Findeyzen praises the dancer&#x27;s &quot;passionate zeal and complete self-effacement&quot;. However, in his 1936 memoirs Stravinsky writes that the decision to employ Nijinsky in this role filled him with apprehension; although he admired Nijinsky as a dancer he had no confidence in him as a choreographer: &quot;the poor boy knew nothing of music. He could neither read it nor play any instrument&quot;. Later still, Stravinsky would ridicule Nijinsky&#x27;s dancing maidens as &quot;knock-kneed and long-braided Lolitas&quot;.

Stravinsky&#x27;s autobiographical account refers to many &quot;painful incidents&quot; between the choreographer and the dancers during the rehearsal period. By the beginning of 1913, when Nijinsky was badly behind schedule, Stravinsky was warned by Diaghilev that &quot;unless you come here immediately ... the &quot;Sacre&quot; will not take place&quot;. The problems were slowly overcome, and when the final rehearsals were held in May 1913, the dancers appeared to have mastered the work&#x27;s difficulties. Even the Ballets Russes&#x27;s sceptical stage director, Serge Grigoriev, was full of praise for the originality and dynamism of Nijinsky&#x27;s choreography.

The conductor Pierre Monteux had worked with Diaghilev since 1911 and had been in charge of the orchestra at the premiere of &quot;Petrushka&quot;. Monteux&#x27;s first reaction to &quot;The Rite&quot;, after hearing Stravinsky play a piano version, was to leave the room and find a quiet corner. He drew Diaghilev aside and said he would never conduct music like that; Diaghilev managed to change his mind. Although he would perform his duties with conscientious professionalism, he never came to enjoy the work; nearly fifty years after the premiere he told enquirers that he detested it. In old age he said to Sir Thomas Beecham&#x27;s biographer Charles Reid: &quot;I did not like &quot;Le Sacre&quot; then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now&quot;. On 30 March Monteux informed Stravinsky of modifications he thought were necessary to the score, all of which the composer implemented. The orchestra, drawn mainly from the Concerts Colonne in Paris, comprised 99 players, much larger than normally employed at the theatre, and had difficulty fitting into the orchestra pit.

After the first part of the ballet received two full orchestral rehearsals in March, Monteux and the company departed to perform in Monte Carlo. Rehearsals resumed when they returned; the unusually large number of rehearsals—seventeen solely orchestral and five with the dancers—were fit into the fortnight before the opening, after Stravinsky&#x27;s arrival in Paris on 13 May. The music contained so many unusual note combinations that Monteux had to ask the musicians to stop interrupting when they thought they had found mistakes in the score, saying he would tell them if something was played incorrectly. According to Doris Monteux, &quot;The musicians thought it absolutely crazy&quot;. At one point—a climactic brass fortissimo—the orchestra broke into nervous laughter at the sound, causing Stravinsky to intervene angrily.

The role of the sacrificial victim was to have been danced by Nijinsky&#x27;s sister, Bronislava Nijinska; when she became pregnant during rehearsals, she was replaced by the then relatively unknown Maria Piltz.

== Performance history and reception ==
=== Premiere ===

Paris&#x27;s Théâtre des Champs-Élysées was a new structure, which had opened on 2 April 1913 with a programme celebrating the works of many of the leading composers of the day. The theatre&#x27;s manager, Gabriel Astruc, was determined to house the 1913 Ballets Russes season, and paid Diaghilev the large sum of 25,000 francs per performance, double what he had paid the previous year. The programme for 29 May 1913, as well as the Stravinsky premiere, included &quot;Les Sylphides&quot;, Weber&#x27;s &quot;Le Spectre de la Rose&quot; and Borodin&#x27;s &quot;Polovtsian Dances&quot;. Ticket sales for the evening, ticket prices being doubled for a premiere, amounted to 35,000 francs. A dress rehearsal was held in the presence of members of the press and assorted invited guests. According to Stravinsky, all went peacefully. However, the critic of &quot;L&#x27;Écho de Paris&quot;, Adolphe Boschot, foresaw possible trouble; he wondered how the public would receive the work, and suggested that they might react badly if they thought they were being mocked.

On the evening of 29 May, Gustav Linor reported, &quot;Never ... has the hall been so full, or so resplendent; the stairways and the corridors were crowded with spectators eager to see and to hear&quot;. The evening began with &quot;Les Sylphides&quot;, in which Nijinsky and Karsavina danced the main roles. &quot;Le Sacre&quot; followed. Some eyewitnesses and commentators said that the disturbances in the audience began during the Introduction, and grew noisier when the curtain rose on the stamping dancers in &quot;Augurs of Spring&quot;. But Taruskin asserts, &quot;it was not Stravinsky&#x27;s music that did the shocking. It was the ugly earthbound lurching and stomping devised by Vaslav Nijinsky.&quot; Marie Rambert, who was working as an assistant to Nijinsky, recalled later that it was soon impossible to hear the music on the stage. In his autobiography, Stravinsky writes that the derisive laughter that greeted the first bars of the Introduction disgusted him, and that he left the auditorium to watch the rest of the performance from the stage wings. The demonstrations, he says, grew into &quot;a terrific uproar&quot; which, along with the on-stage noises, drowned out the voice of Nijinsky who was shouting the step numbers to the dancers. Two years after the premiere the journalist and photographer Carl Van Vechten claimed in his book &quot;Music After the Great War&quot; that the person behind him became carried away with excitement, and &quot;began to beat rhythmically on top of my head with his fists&quot;. In 1916, in a letter not published until 2013, Van Vechten admitted he had actually attended the second night, among other changes of fact.
At that time, a Parisian ballet audience typically consisted of two diverse groups: the wealthy and fashionable set, who would be expecting to see a traditional performance with beautiful music, and a &quot;Bohemian&quot; group who, the poet-philosopher Jean Cocteau asserted, would &quot;acclaim, right or wrong, anything that is new because of their hatred of the boxes&quot;. Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions began attacking each other, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra: &quot;Everything available was tossed in our direction, but we continued to play on&quot;. Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected—possibly with the intervention of the police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. The unrest receded significantly during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz&#x27;s rendering of the final &quot;Sacrificial Dance&quot; was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening&#x27;s programme continued.

Among the more hostile press reviews was that of &quot;Le Figaro&quot;″s critic Henri Quittard, who called the work &quot;a laborious and puerile barbarity&quot; and added &quot;We are sorry to see an artist such as M. Stravinsky involve himself in this disconcerting adventure&quot;. On the other hand, Gustav Linor, writing in the leading theatrical magazine &quot;Comœdia&quot;, thought the performance was superb, especially that of Maria Piltz; the disturbances, while deplorable, were merely &quot;a rowdy debate&quot; between two ill-mannered factions. Emile Raudin, of &quot;Les Marges&quot;, who had barely heard the music, wrote: &quot;Couldn&#x27;t we ask M. Astruc ... to set aside one performance for well-intentioned spectators? ... We could at least propose to evict the female element&quot;. The composer Alfredo Casella thought that the demonstrations were aimed at Nijinsky&#x27;s choreography rather than at the music, a view shared by the critic Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi, who wrote: &quot;The idea was excellent, but was not successfully carried out&quot;. Calvocoressi failed to observe any direct hostility to the composer—unlike, he said, the premiere of Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; in 1902. Of later reports that the veteran composer Camille Saint-Saëns had stormed out of the premiere, Stravinsky observed that this was impossible; Saint-Saëns did not attend. Stravinsky also rejected Cocteau&#x27;s story that, after the performance, Stravinsky, Nijinsky, Diaghilev and Cocteau himself took a cab to the Bois de Boulogne where a tearful Diaghilev recited poems by Pushkin. Stravinsky merely recalled a celebratory dinner with Diaghilev and Nijinsky, at which the impresario expressed his entire satisfaction with the outcome. To Maximilien Steinberg, a former fellow-pupil under Rimsky-Korsakov, Stravinsky wrote that Nijinsky&#x27;s choreography had been &quot;incomparable: with the exception of a few places, everything was as I wanted it&quot;.

=== Initial run and early revivals ===
The premiere was followed by five further performances of &quot;Le Sacre du printemps&quot; at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, the last on 13 June. Although these occasions were relatively peaceful, something of the mood of the first night remained; the composer Giacomo Puccini, who attended the second performance on 2 June, described the choreography as ridiculous and the music cacophonous—&quot;the work of a madman. The public hissed, laughed—and applauded&quot;. Stravinsky, confined to his bed by typhoid fever, did not join the company when it went to London for four performances at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Reviewing the London production, &quot;The Times&quot; critic was impressed how different elements of the work came together to form a coherent whole, but was less enthusiastic about the music itself, opining that Stravinsky had entirely sacrificed melody and harmony for rhythm: &quot;If M. Stravinsky had wished to be really primitive, he would have been wise to ... score his ballet for nothing but drums&quot;. The ballet historian Cyril Beaumont commented on the &quot;slow, uncouth movements&quot; of the dancers, finding these &quot;in complete opposition to the traditions of classical ballet&quot;.
After the opening Paris run and the London performances, events conspired to prevent further stagings of the ballet. Nijinsky&#x27;s choreography, which Kelly describes as &quot;so striking, so outrageous, so frail as to its preservation&quot;, did not appear again until attempts were made to reconstruct it in the 1980s. On 19 September 1913 Nijinsky married Romola de Pulszky while the Ballets Russes was on tour without Diaghilev in South America. When Diaghilev found out he was distraught and furious that his lover had married, and dismissed Nijinsky. Diaghilev was then obliged to re-hire Fokine, who had resigned in 1912 because Nijinsky had been asked to choreograph &quot;Faune&quot;. Fokine made it a condition of his re-employment that none of Nijinsky&#x27;s choreography would be performed. In a letter to the art critic and historian Alexandre Benois, Stravinsky wrote, &quot;[T]he possibility has gone for some time of seeing anything valuable in the field of dance and, still more important, of again seeing this offspring of mine&quot;.

With the disruption following the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 and the dispersal of many artistes, Diaghilev was ready to re-engage Nijinsky as both dancer and choreographer, but Nijinsky had been placed under house arrest in Hungary as an enemy Russian citizen. Diaghilev negotiated his release in 1916 for a tour in the United States, but the dancer&#x27;s mental health steadily declined and he took no further part in professional ballet after 1917. In 1920, when Diaghilev decided to revive &quot;The Rite&quot;, he found that no one now remembered the choreography. After spending most of the war years in Switzerland, and becoming a permanent exile from his homeland after the 1917 Russian Revolution, Stravinsky resumed his partnership with Diaghilev when the war ended. In December 1920 Ernest Ansermet conducted a new production in Paris, choreographed by Léonide Massine, with the Nicholas Roerich designs retained; the lead dancer was Lydia Sokolova. In his memoirs, Stravinsky is equivocal about the Massine production; the young choreographer, he writes, showed &quot;unquestionable talent&quot;, but there was something &quot;forced and artificial&quot; in his choreography, which lacked the necessary organic relationship with the music. Sokolova, in her later account, recalled some of the tensions surrounding the production, with Stravinsky, &quot;wearing an expression that would have frightened a hundred Chosen Virgins, pranc[ing] up and down the centre aisle&quot; while Ansermet rehearsed the orchestra.

=== Later choreographies ===
The ballet was first shown in the United States on 11 April 1930, when Massine&#x27;s 1920 version was performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra in Philadelphia under Leopold Stokowski, with Martha Graham dancing the role of the Chosen One. The production moved to New York, where Massine was relieved to find the audiences receptive, a sign, he thought, that New Yorkers were finally beginning to take ballet seriously. The first American-designed production, in 1937, was that of the modern dance exponent Lester Horton, whose version replaced the original pagan Russian setting with a Wild West background and the use of Native American dances.
In 1944 Massine began a new collaboration with Roerich, who before his death in 1947 completed a number of sketches for a new production which Massine brought to fruition at La Scala in Milan in 1948. This heralded a number of significant post-war European productions. Mary Wigman in Berlin (1957) followed Horton in highlighting the erotic aspects of virgin sacrifice, as did Maurice Béjart in Brussels (1959). Béjart&#x27;s representation replaced the culminating sacrifice with a depiction of what the critic Robert Johnson describes as &quot;ceremonial coitus&quot;. The Royal Ballet&#x27;s 1962 production, choreographed by Kenneth MacMillan and designed by Sidney Nolan, was first performed on 3 May and was a critical triumph. It has remained in the company&#x27;s repertoire for more than 50 years; after its revival in May 2011 &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;″s critic Mark Monahan called it one of the Royal Ballet&#x27;s greatest achievements. Moscow first saw &quot;The Rite&quot; in 1965, in a version choreographed for the Bolshoi Ballet by Natalia Kasatkina and Vladimir Vasiliev. This production was shown in Leningrad four years later, at the Maly Opera Theatre, and introduced a storyline that provided the Chosen One with a lover who wreaks vengeance on the elders after the sacrifice. Johnson describes the production as &quot;a product of state atheism ... Soviet propaganda at its best&quot;.
In 1975 modern dance choreographer Pina Bausch, who transformed the Ballett der Wuppertaler Bühnen to Tanztheater Wuppertal, caused a stir in the dance world with her stark depiction, played out on an earth-covered stage, in which the Chosen One is sacrificed to gratify the misogyny of the surrounding men. At the end, according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Luke Jennings, &quot;the cast is sweat-streaked, filthy and audibly panting&quot;. Part of this dance appears in the film &quot;Pina&quot;. Bausch&#x27;s version had also been danced by two ballet companies, the Paris Opera Ballet and English National Ballet. In America, in 1980, Paul Taylor used Stravinsky&#x27;s four-hand piano version of the score as the background for a scenario based on child murder and gangster film images. In February 1984 Martha Graham, in her 90th year, resumed her association with &quot;The Rite&quot; by choreographing a new production at New York State Theater. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic declared the performance &quot;a triumph ... totally elemental, as primal in expression of basic emotion as any tribal ceremony, as hauntingly staged in its deliberate bleakness as it is rich in implication&quot;.

On 30 September 1987, the Joffrey Ballet performed in Los Angeles &quot;The Rite&quot; based on a reconstruction of Nijinsky&#x27;s 1913 choreography, until then thought lost beyond recall. The performance resulted from years of research, primarily by Millicent Hodson, who pieced the choreography together from the original prompt books, contemporary sketches and photographs, and the recollections of Marie Rambert and other survivors. Hodson&#x27;s version has since been performed by the Kirov Ballet, at the Mariinsky Theatre in 2003 and later that year at Covent Garden. In its 2012–13 season the Joffrey Ballet gave centennial performances at numerous venues, including the University of Texas on 5–6 March 2013, the University of Massachusetts on 14 March 2013, and with the Cleveland Orchestra on 17–18 August 2013.

The music publishers Boosey &amp; Hawkes have estimated that since its premiere, the ballet has been the subject of at least 150 productions, many of which have become classics and have been performed worldwide. Among the more radical interpretations is Glen Tetley&#x27;s 1974 version, in which the Chosen One is a young male. More recently there have been solo dance versions devised by Molissa Fenley and Javier de Frutos and a punk rock interpretation from Michael Clark. The 2004 film &quot;Rhythm Is It!&quot; documents a project by conductor Simon Rattle with the Berlin Philharmonic and choreographer Royston Maldoom to stage a performance of the ballet with a cast of 250 children recruited from Berlin&#x27;s public schools, from 25 countries. In &quot;Rites&quot; (2008), by The Australian Ballet in conjunction with Bangarra Dance Theatre, Aboriginal perceptions of the elements of earth, air, fire and water are featured.

=== Concert performances ===
On 18 February 1914 &quot;The Rite&quot; received its first concert performance (the music without the ballet), in Saint Petersburg under Serge Koussevitzky. On 5 April that year, Stravinsky experienced for himself the popular success of &quot;Le Sacre&quot; as a concert work, at the Casino de Paris. After the performance, again under Monteux, the composer was carried in triumph from the hall on the shoulders of his admirers. &quot;The Rite&quot; had its first British concert performance on 7 June 1921, at the Queen&#x27;s Hall in London under Eugene Goossens. Its American premiere occurred on 3 March 1922, when Stokowski included it in a Philadelphia Orchestra programme. Goossens was also responsible for introducing &quot;The Rite&quot; to Australia on 23 August 1946 at the Sydney Town Hall, as guest conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.

Stravinsky first conducted the work in 1926, in a concert given by the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam; two years later he brought it to the Salle Pleyel in Paris for two performances under his baton. Of these occasions he later wrote that &quot;thanks to the experience I had gained with all kinds of orchestras ... I had reached a point where I could obtain exactly what I wanted, as I wanted it&quot;. Commentators have broadly agreed that the work has had a greater impact in the concert hall than it has on the stage; many of Stravinsky&#x27;s revisions to the music were made with the concert hall rather than the theatre in mind. The work has become a staple in the repertoires of all the leading orchestras, and has been cited by Leonard Bernstein as &quot;the most important piece of music of the 20th century&quot;.

In 1963, 50 years after the premiere, Monteux (then aged 88) agreed to conduct a commemorative performance at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall. According to Isaiah Berlin, a close friend of the composer, Stravinsky informed him that he had no intention of hearing his music being &quot;murdered by that frightful butcher&quot;. Instead he arranged tickets for that particular evening&#x27;s performance of Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, at Covent Garden. Under pressure from his friends, Stravinsky was persuaded to leave the opera after the first act. He arrived at the Albert Hall just as the performance of &quot;The Rite&quot; was ending; composer and conductor shared a warm embrace in front of the unaware, wildly cheering audience. Monteux&#x27;s biographer John Canarina provides a different slant on this occasion, recording that by the end of the evening Stravinsky had asserted that &quot;Monteux, almost alone among conductors, never cheapened &quot;Rite&quot; or looked for his own glory in it, and he continued to play it all his life with the greatest fidelity&quot;.

== Music ==
=== General character ===
Commentators have often described &quot;The Rite&quot;″s music in vivid terms; Paul Rosenfeld, in 1920, wrote of it &quot;pound[ing] with the rhythm of engines, whirls and spirals like screws and fly-wheels, grinds and shrieks like laboring metal&quot;. In a more recent analysis, &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Donal Henahan refers to &quot;great crunching, snarling chords from the brass and thundering thumps from the timpani&quot;. The composer Julius Harrison acknowledged the uniqueness of the work negatively: it demonstrated Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;abhorrence of everything for which music has stood these many centuries ... all human endeavour and progress are being swept aside to make room for hideous sounds&quot;.

In &quot;The Firebird&quot;, Stravinsky had begun to experiment with bitonality (the use of two different keys simultaneously). He took this technique further in &quot;Petrushka&quot;, but reserved its full effect for &quot;The Rite&quot; where, as the analyst E.W. White explains, he &quot;pushed [it] to its logical conclusion&quot;. White also observes the music&#x27;s complex metrical character, with combinations of duple and triple time in which a strong irregular beat is emphasised by powerful percussion. The music critic Alex Ross has described the irregular process whereby Stravinsky adapted and absorbed traditional Russian folk material into the score. He &quot;proceeded to pulverize them into motivic bits, pile them up in layers, and reassemble them in cubistic collages and montages&quot;.

The duration of the work is about 35 minutes.

=== Instrumentation ===
The score calls for a large orchestra consisting of the following instruments:

Woodwinds
:1 piccolo
:3 flutes (third doubling second piccolo)
:1 alto flute
:4 oboes (fourth doubling second cor anglais)
:1 cor anglais
:3 clarinets in B and A (third doubling second bass clarinet)
:1 clarinet in E and D
:1 bass clarinet
:4 bassoons (fourth doubling second contrabassoon)
:1 contrabassoon

Brass
:8 horns (seventh and eighth doubling tenor Wagner tubas)
:1 piccolo trumpet in D
:4 trumpets in C (fourth doubling bass trumpet in E)
:3 trombones
:2 bass tubas
Percussion
:5 timpani (requiring two players)
:bass drum
:tam-tam
:triangle
:tambourine
:cymbals
:antique cymbals in A and B
:güiro
Strings
:violins I, II
:violas
:cellos
:double basses
Despite the large orchestra, much of the score is written chamber-fashion, with individual instruments and small groups having distinct roles.

=== Part I: The Adoration of the Earth ===

The opening melody is played by a solo bassoon in a very high register, which renders the instrument almost unidentifiable; gradually other woodwind instruments are sounded and are eventually joined by strings. The sound builds up before stopping suddenly, Hill says, &quot;just as it is bursting ecstatically into bloom&quot;. There is then a reiteration of the opening bassoon solo, now played a semitone lower.
The first dance, &quot;Augurs of Spring&quot;, is characterised by a repetitive stamping chord in the horns and strings, based on E dominant 7 superimposed on an F major triad, F, A, and C. White suggests that this bitonal combination, which Stravinsky considered the focal point of the entire work, was devised on the piano, since the constituent chords are comfortable fits for the hands on a keyboard. The rhythm of the stamping is disturbed by Stravinsky&#x27;s constant shifting of the accent, on and off the beat, before the dance ends in a collapse, as if from exhaustion. Alex Ross has summed up the pattern (italics = rhythmic accents) as follows:
&lt;poem style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
one two three four five six seven eight
one &quot;two&quot; three &quot;four&quot; five six seven eight
one &quot;two&quot; three four &quot;five&quot; six seven eight
&quot;one&quot; two three four five &quot;six&quot; seven eight&lt;/poem&gt;

According to Roger Nichols &quot;At first sight there seems no pattern in the distribution of accents to the stamping chords. Taking the initial quaver of bar 1 as a natural accent we have for the first outburst the following groups of quavers: 9, 2, 6, 3, 4, 5, 3. However, these apparently random numbers make sense when split into two groups:
&lt;poem style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
9 6 4 3
2 3 5&lt;/poem&gt;

Clearly the top line is decreasing, the bottom line increasing, and by respectively decreasing and increasing amounts ...Whether Stravinsky worked them out like this we shall probably never know. But the way two different rhythmic &#x27;orders&#x27; interfere with each other to produced apparent chaos is... a typically Stravinskyan notion.&quot;

The &quot;Ritual of Abduction&quot; which follows is described by Hill as &quot;the most terrifying of musical hunts&quot;. It concludes in a series of flute trills that usher in the &quot;Spring Rounds&quot;, in which a slow and laborious theme gradually rises to a dissonant fortissimo, a &quot;ghastly caricature&quot; of the episode&#x27;s main tune.

Brass and percussion predominate as the &quot;Ritual of the Rival Tribes&quot; begins. A tune emerges on tenor and bass tubas, leading after much repetition to the entry of the Sage&#x27;s procession. The music then comes to a virtual halt, &quot;bleached free of colour&quot; (Hill), as the Sage blesses the earth. The &quot;Dance of the Earth&quot; then begins, bringing Part I to a close in a series of phrases of the utmost vigour which are abruptly terminated in what Hill describes as a &quot;blunt, brutal amputation&quot;.

=== Part II: The Sacrifice ===
Part II has a greater cohesion than its predecessor. Hill describes the music as following an arc stretching from the beginning of the Introduction to the conclusion of the final dance. Woodwind and muted trumpets are prominent throughout the Introduction, which ends with a number of rising cadences on strings and flutes. The transition into the &quot;Mystic Circles&quot; is almost imperceptible; the main theme of the section has been prefigured in the Introduction. A loud repeated chord, which Berger likens to a call to order, announces the moment for choosing the sacrificial victim. The &quot;Glorification of the Chosen One&quot; is brief and violent; in the &quot;Evocation of the Ancestors&quot; that follows, short phrases are interspersed with drum rolls. The &quot;Ritual Action of the Ancestors&quot; begins quietly, but slowly builds to a series of climaxes before subsiding suddenly into the quiet phrases that began the episode.
The final transition introduces the &quot;Sacrificial Dance&quot;. This is written as a more disciplined ritual than the extravagant dance that ended Part I, though it contains some wild moments, with the large percussion section of the orchestra given full voice. Stravinsky had difficulties with this section, especially with the final bars that conclude the work. The abrupt ending displeased several critics, one of whom wrote that the music &quot;suddenly falls over on its side&quot;. Stravinsky himself referred to the final chord disparagingly as &quot;a noise&quot;, but in his various attempts to amend or rewrite the section, was unable to produce a more acceptable solution.

== Influence and adaptations ==
The music historian Donald Jay Grout has written: &quot;&quot;The Sacre&quot; is undoubtedly the most famous composition of the early 20th century ... it had the effect of an explosion that so scattered the elements of musical language that they could never again be put together as before&quot;. The academic and critic Jan Smaczny, echoing Bernstein, calls it one of the 20th century&#x27;s most influential compositions, providing &quot;endless stimulation for performers and listeners&quot;. Taruskin writes that &quot;one of the marks of The Rite&#x27;s unique status is the number of books that have been devoted to it—certainly a greater number than have been devoted to any other ballet, possibly to any other individual musical composition ...&quot; According to Kelly the 1913 premiere might be considered &quot;the most important single moment in the history of 20th-century music&quot;, and its repercussions continue to reverberate in the 21st century. Ross has described &quot;The Rite&quot; as a prophetic work, presaging the &quot;second avant-garde&quot; era in classical composition—music of the body rather than of the mind, in which &quot;[m]elodies would follow the patterns of speech; rhythms would match the energy of dance ... sonorities would have the hardness of life as it is really lived&quot;. The work is regarded as among the first examples of modernism in music.

Among 20th-century composers most influenced by &quot;The Rite&quot; is Stravinsky&#x27;s near contemporary, Edgard Varèse, who had attended the 1913 premiere. Varèse, according to Ross, was particularly drawn to the &quot;cruel harmonies and stimulating rhythms&quot; of &quot;The Rite&quot;, which he employed to full effect in his concert work &quot;Amériques&quot; (1921), scored for a massive orchestra with added sound effects including a lion&#x27;s roar and a wailing siren. Aaron Copland, to whom Stravinsky was a particular inspiration in the former&#x27;s student days, considered &quot;The Rite&quot; a masterpiece that had created &quot;the decade of the displaced accent and the polytonal chord&quot;. Copland adopted Stravinsky&#x27;s technique of composing in small sections which he then shuffled and rearranged, rather than working through from beginning to end. Ross cites the music of Copland&#x27;s ballet &quot;Billy the Kid&quot; as coming directly from the &quot;Spring Rounds&quot; section of &quot;The Rite&quot;. For Olivier Messiaen &quot;The Rite&quot; was of special significance; he constantly analysed and expounded on the work, which gave him an enduring model for rhythmic drive and assembly of material. Stravinsky was sceptical about over-intellectual analysis of the work. &quot;The man has found reasons for every note and that the clarinet line in page 3 is the inverted counterpoint of the horn in page 19. I never thought about that&quot;, he allegedly replied to Michel Legrand when asked about Pierre Boulez&#x27;s take on the matter.

After the premiere the writer Léon Vallas opined that Stravinsky had written music 30 years ahead of its time, suitable to be heard in 1940. Coincidentally, it was in that year that Walt Disney released &quot;Fantasia&quot;, an animated feature film using music from &quot;The Rite&quot; and other classical compositions, conducted by Stokowski. The &quot;Rite&quot; segment of the film depicted the Earth&#x27;s prehistory, with the creation of life, leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs as the finale. Among those impressed by the film was Gunther Schuller, later a composer, conductor and jazz scholar. The &quot;Rite of Spring&quot; sequence, he says, overwhelmed him and determined his future career in music: &quot;I hope [Stravinsky] appreciated that hundreds—perhaps thousands—of musicians were turned onto &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; ... through &quot;Fantasia&quot;, musicians who might otherwise never have heard the work, or at least not until many years later&quot;. In later life Stravinsky claimed distaste for the adaptation, though as Ross remarks, he said nothing critical at the time; according to Ross, the composer Paul Hindemith observed that &quot;Igor appears to love it&quot;.

== Recordings ==

Before the first gramophone disc recordings of &quot;The Rite&quot; were issued in 1929, Stravinsky had helped to produce a pianola version of the work for the London branch of the Aeolian Company. He also created a much more comprehensive arrangement for the Pleyela, manufactured by the French piano company Pleyel, with whom he signed two contracts in April and May 1921, under which many of his early works were reproduced on this medium. The Pleyela version of &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; was issued in 1921; the British pianolist Rex Lawson first recorded the work in this form in 1990.

In 1929 Stravinsky and Monteux vied with each other to conduct the first orchestral gramophone recording of &quot;The Rite&quot;. While Stravinsky led L&#x27;Orchestre des Concerts Straram in a recording for the Columbia label, at the same time Monteux was recording it for the HMV label. Stokowski&#x27;s version followed in 1930. Stravinsky made two more recordings, in 1940 and 1960. According to the critic Edward Greenfield, Stravinsky was not technically a great conductor but, Greenfield says, in the 1960 recording with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra the composer inspired a performance with &quot;extraordinary thrust and resilience&quot;. In conversations with Robert Craft, Stravinsky reviewed several recordings of &quot;The Rite&quot; made in the 1960s. He thought Herbert von Karajan&#x27;s 1963 recording with the Berlin Philharmonic, was good, but &quot;the performance is ... too polished, a pet savage rather than a real one&quot;. Stravinsky thought that Pierre Boulez, with the Orchestre National de France (1963), was &quot;less good than I had hoped ... very bad tempi and some tasteless alterations&quot;. He praised a 1962 recording by The Moscow State Symphony Orchestra for making the music sound Russian, &quot;which is just right&quot;, but Stravinsky&#x27;s concluding judgement was that none of these three performances was worth preserving.

As of 2013 there were well over 100 different recordings of &quot;The Rite&quot; commercially available, and many more held in library sound archives. It has become one of the most recorded of all 20th century musical works.

== Editions ==

The first published score was the four-hand piano arrangement (Edition Russe de Musique, RV196), dated 1913. Publication of the full orchestral score was prevented by the outbreak of war in August 1914. After the revival of the work in 1920 Stravinsky, who had not heard the music for seven years, made numerous revisions to the score, which was finally published in 1921 (Edition Russe de Musique, RV 197/197b. large and pocket scores).

In 1922 Ansermet, who was preparing to perform the work in Berlin, sent to Stravinsky a list of errors he had found in the published score. In 1926, as part of his preparation for that year&#x27;s performance with the Concertgebouw Orchestra, Stravinsky rewrote the &quot;Evocation of the Ancestors&quot; section and made substantial changes to the &quot;Sacrificial Dance&quot;. The extent of these revisions, together with Ansermet&#x27;s recommendations, convinced Stravinsky that a new edition was necessary, and this appeared in large and pocket form in 1929. It did not, however, incorporate all of Ansermet&#x27;s amendments and, confusingly, bore the date and RV code of the 1921 edition, making the new edition hard to identify.

Stravinsky continued to revise the work, and in 1943 rewrote the &quot;Sacrificial Dance&quot;. In 1948 Boosey &amp; Hawkes issued a corrected version of the 1929 score (B&amp;H 16333), although Stravinsky&#x27;s substantial 1943 amendment of the &quot;Sacrificial Dance&quot; was not incorporated into the new version and remained unperformed, to the composer&#x27;s disappointment. He considered it &quot;much easier to play ... and superior in balance and sonority&quot; to the earlier versions. A less musical motive for the revisions and corrected editions was copyright law. The composer had left Galaxy Music Corporation (agents for Editions Russe de la Musique, the original publisher) for Associated Music Publishers at the time, and orchestras would be reluctant to pay a second rental charge from two publishers to match the full work and the revised Sacrificial Dance; moreover, the revised dance could only be published in America. The 1948 score provided copyright protection to the work in America, where it had lapsed, but Boosey (who acquired the Editions Russe catalogue) did not have the rights to the revised finale.

The 1929 score as revised in 1948 forms the basis of most modern performances of &quot;The Rite.&quot; Boosey &amp; Hawkes reissued their 1948 edition in 1965, and produced a newly engraved edition (B&amp;H 19441) in 1967. The firm also issued an unmodified reprint of the 1913 piano reduction in 1952 (B&amp;H 17271) and a revised piano version, incorporating the 1929 revisions, in 1967.

The Paul Sacher Foundation, in association with Boosey &amp; Hawkes, announced in May 2013, as part of &quot;The Rite&quot;″s centenary celebrations, their intention to publish the 1913 autograph score, as used in early performances. After being kept in Russia for decades, the autograph score was acquired by Boosey &amp; Hawkes in 1947. The firm presented the score to Stravinsky in 1962, on his 80th birthday. After the composer&#x27;s death in 1971 the manuscript was acquired by the Paul Sacher Foundation. As well as the autograph score, they have published the manuscript piano four-hands score.

In 2000, Kalmus Music Publishers brought out an edition where former Philadelphia Orchestra librarian Clint Nieweg made over 21,000 corrections to the score and parts. Since then a published errata list added some 310 more corrections. Then in 2021, Serenissima Music published a newer Nieweg edition, incorporating 2,200 more corrections based on Stravinsky&#x27;s autograph manuscript score, superseding the older 2000 edition.

<text>Amazon parrots are parrots in the genus Amazona. They are medium-sized, short-tailed parrots native to the Americas, with their range extending from South America to Mexico and the Caribbean. &quot;Amazona&quot; is one of the 92 genera of parrots that make up the order Psittaciformes and is in the family Psittacidae, one of three families of true parrots. It contains about thirty species. Most amazons are predominantly green, with accenting colors that depend on the species, and they can be quite vivid. They feed primarily on seeds, nuts, and fruits, supplemented by leafy matter.

Many amazons have the ability to mimic human speech and other sounds. Partly because of this, they are popular as pets or companion parrots, and a small industry has developed in breeding parrots in captivity for this market. This popularity has led to many parrots being taken from the wild to the extent that some species have become threatened. The United States and the European Union have made the capture of wild parrots for the pet trade illegal in an attempt to help protect wild populations. Feral populations of amazons can be found in different parts of the world, including in South Africa, Europe, and major cities in the Americas.

== Taxonomy ==


The genus &quot;Amazona&quot; was introduced by the French naturalist René Lesson in 1830. The type species was subsequently designated as the mealy amazon (&quot;Amazona farinosa&quot;) by the Italian zoologist Tommaso Salvadori in 1891. The genus name is a Latinized version of the name &quot;Amazone&quot; given to them in the 18th century by the Comte de Buffon, who believed they were native to Amazonian jungles.

&quot;Amazona&quot; contains about thirty species of parrots, such as the Cuban amazon, festive amazon, and red-necked amazon. The taxonomy of the yellow-crowned amazon (&quot;Amazona ochrocephala&quot; complex) is disputed, with some authorities only listing a single species (&quot;A. ochrocephala&quot;), while others split it into as many as three species (&quot;A. ochrocephala&quot;, &quot;A. auropalliata&quot; and &quot;A. oratrix&quot;). The split is primarily based on differences related to extension of yellow to the plumage and the colour of bill and legs. Phylogenetic analyses of mtDNA do not support the traditional split.

A 2017 study published by ornithologists Tony Silva, Antonio Guzmán, Adam D. Urantówka and Paweł Mackiewicz proposed a new species from the Yucatán Peninsula area in Mexico called the blue-winged amazon (&quot;Amazona gomezgarzai&quot;). However, subsequent studies question its validity, indicating that these organisms possibly had an artificial hybrid origin.

The yellow-faced parrot (&quot;Alipiopsitta xanthops&quot;) was traditionally placed within this genus, but recent research has shown that it is more closely related to the short-tailed parrot and species in the genus &quot;Pionus&quot;, resulting in it being transferred to the monotypic genus &quot;Alipiopsitta&quot;.

===Extinct hypothetical species===
Populations of amazon parrots that lived on the Caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe are now extinct. It is not known if they were distinct species or subspecies, or if they originated from parrots introduced to the islands by humans, so they are regarded as hypothetical extinct species. No evidence of them remains, and their taxonomy may never be established. Populations of several parrot species were described mainly in the unscientific writings of early travelers, and subsequently scientifically described by several naturalists (to have their names linked to the species that they were proposing) mainly in the 20th century, with no more evidence than the earlier observations and without specimens. An illustration of a specimen termed &quot;George Edwards&#x27; parrot&quot; has sometimes been considered a possibly distinct, extinct species, but it may also have been a yellow-billed or Cuban amazon with aberrant colouration.

* Guadeloupe amazon, &quot;Amazona violacea&quot;. Originally called &quot;Psittacus violaceus&quot; by J.F. Gmelin in 1789.

== Description ==
Most amazon parrots are predominantly green, with contrasting colors on parts of the body such as the crown, face and flight feathers; these colours vary by species. They are medium- to large-sized parrots, measuring between long, and have short, rounded tails and wings. They are heavy-billed, and have a distinct notch on the upper mandible and a prominent naked cere with setae on it. Male and female amazon parrots are roughly the same size, though males can be larger at times - most amazon parrots do not show sexual dimorphism, exceptions being the white-fronted amazon, Yucatan amazon and the turquoise-fronted amazon, the latter species being sexually dimorphic when viewed in the ultraviolet spectrum, invisible to humans. They can weigh from 190g to more than 565g. The average body temperature of an amazon parrot is 41.8 degrees Celsius, or 107.1 degrees Fahrenheit. Their heart rates range from 340 to 600 beats per minute, with 15-45 breaths per minute.

==Distribution and habitat==
Amazon parrots are native to the Neotropical Americas, ranging from South America to Mexico, and the Caribbean. Outside of their native habitats, more than 14 species of amazon parrots have been observed. In Italy, there are two reproductive populations of &quot;Amazona&quot;, dating back to their introduction in 1991 to the city of Genoa. The birds are present in Germany, but their status is unclear. They are also found in Spain, where the most common parrot present is the turquoise-fronted amazon. Portugal, California (where the birds were largely introduced during the 20th century), Puerto Rico, South Africa, and the Netherlands have also reported sightings of &quot;Amazona&quot; parrots. More than 12 species of amazon parrots can be found in the US state of Florida, mostly around the city of Miami. Feral populations are also present in São Paulo, Porto Alegre, Buenos Aires, and Río Cuarto within South America.

Amazon parrots mostly inhabit forests such as scrub forests, palm groves and rainforests, but some prefer drier areas such as savannas. Vinaceous-breasted amazons are thought to prefer parana pine trees, and have been shown to prefer forest fragments or isolated trees, while Tucumán amazons nest at higher elevations than other amazon parrots, mostly in &quot;Blepharocalyx&quot; trees, within the cloud-forest. Yellow-headed amazons nest in the canopy of tall trees, mostly in &quot;Astronium graveolens&quot; and &quot;Enterolobium cyclocarpum&quot;.

== Behavior ==
===Breeding===
The exact breeding age of wild birds is not precisely known. For captive-bred birds, the average breeding age is around four years, with some larger groups like yellow-crowned amazons requiring six years. Captive birds as old as 30 years have laid eggs. Amazon parrots average 5 weeks for nest initiation, with most successful nestings averaging 2.2 fledglings. Amazon parrots mostly breed during late winter and spring, as they are seasonal breeders. This may happen due to seasonal food availability or a lower chance of flooding, as the period is generally dry. West Indian amazon parrots tend to breed earlier than Mexican amazon parrots, with Mexican amazon parrots having their peak at March to April while West Indian amazon parrots peak in March.

Captive birds are likelier to be less fertile. A variety of hypotheses to explain the phenomenon have been proposed - Low (1995) suggests that this is because amazon parrots have shorter breeding seasons, while Hagen (1994) suggests that this is because male and female parrots may not be ready for breeding at the same times.

===Feeding===
Amazon parrots feed primarily on seeds, nuts, fruits, berries, buds, nectar, and flowers, supplemented by leafy matter. Their beaks enable them to crack nut shells with ease, and they hold their food with a foot. In captivity, the birds enjoy vegetables such as squash, boiled potato, peas, beans, and carrots. Mainland amazon parrots forage and then feed their young twice a day (usually one hour after sunrise and one and a half hours before sunset), while West Indian amazon parrots do so 4-5 times. Hypotheses proposed for why this is include the nutritional value of food in the region as well as temperature stress. During the downtime before foraging expeditions in the afternoon, amazon parrots spend their time preening themselves and their mates.

===Communication and sociality===
Amazon parrots mostly communicate vocally. Species such as orange-winged amazons have nine different recorded vocalizations used in different situations. However, patterns of gestural communication have been observed with the birds, thought to be used to avoid predators. In general, amazon parrots are very social birds in their foraging, roosting, and nesting. Most amazon parrots travel in large groups and have clumped nesting, but the four species in the Lesser Antilles are less social. Theories for why this is include the lack of predation risk. In captivity, amazon parrots are known for their ability to talk- learning to communicate by mimicking speech and other sounds of human origin. They also appear to have an affinity for human music and singing.

Extensive studies of vocal behavior in wild yellow-naped amazons show the presence of vocal dialects, in which the repertoire of calls that parrots vocalize change at discrete geographic boundaries, similar to how humans have different languages or dialects. Dialects are stable over long periods of time and are meaningful to the parrots; they are less responsive to calls that are not their own dialect.
== Conservation status ==
As of June 2020, 58% (18 out of 31) of species were listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as threatened or extinct in the wild. The most common threats are habitat loss, persecution, the pet trade, and the introduction of other species. The Puerto Rican amazon is critically endangered. 15 species are on Appendix 1 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, while 16 are on Appendix 2. In the case of illegal smuggling of amazon parrots, some smugglers bleach the heads of green-headed parrots to make them look yellow and sell them off as young amazon parrots, which can cause dermatitis. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the United States Department of Agriculture sometimes confiscate and quarantine parrots for Newcastle disease and then auction them off.

The Puerto Rican parrot in particular, as a critically endangered species, has seen considerable conservation efforts, including but not limited to changes in land management, legal protection, research, and increasing nesting success. However, these efforts were significantly hindered by natural events such as Hurricane Hugo, which affected the Luquillo forest in which most Puerto Rican parrots were living.

Within the rest of the West Indies, the four species of amazon parrots in the Lesser Antilles have seen successful attempts at increasing their population. In the Greater Antilles, the population of amazon parrots has been stable. The Cuban amazon has seen greatly successful conservation efforts and as a result has experienced a large increase in its population.

==Aviculture==

Low (2005) describes adaptability and joyfulness as the special positive attributes of the genus from an avicultural perspective. The yellow-headed amazon, yellow-naped amazon, and turquoise-fronted amazon are some of the species which are commonly kept as pets. They can live for 30 to 50 years, with one report of a yellow-crowned amazon living for 56 years in captivity. However, some amazons can have hormonally-induced aggressiveness and attack their owners, which has led to owners seeking behavior modification for their parrots. On the other hand, unlike many other amazon species, the lilacine amazon and mealy amazon are said to possess gentle, easy-going and affectionate temperaments. To maintain health and happiness, pet parrots require much more training than domesticated animals such as dogs or even cats. They require understanding, manipulative toys, and rewards for good pet-like behavior, or they can develop quite aggressive behaviors (particularly male birds), which can be clearly observed through the bird&#x27;s body language - pinning the eyes, flaring the tail, raising the head and neck feathers and engaging in a &quot;macho strut&quot;. They have a strong, innate need to chew; thus, they require safe, destructible toys. One of the main problems amazon parrots face in captivity is obesity, which can be avoided with the correct diet and exercise. Within captivity, it is recommended to feed amazon parrots a variety of food, mostly consisting of pelleted food. Seeds should never be used as a whole diet and should be used as part of a balanced diet, balanced with food such as fresh fruit (except avocado, which is toxic to parrots) and vegetables, with nuts and seed provided only in moderation. Amazon parrots should also be given opportunities to forage for food instead of simply being given it, as they are motivated to forage even when an easier alternative is available.

Amazon parrots should be given a dark and quiet sleeping area. It is recommended to give the bird either downtime and naps or to keep them in total darkness for 12 hours so they can rest. Parrots also need to be bathed or sprayed with water once every week to allow for bathing behaviors.

===Trade===
Amazon parrots are traded and exploited as pets. Archeological evidence shows that the parrot trade has existed in South America since pre-Columbian times, with mummified parrots (including amazon species) being found in the Atacama Desert region of Chile. The most traded species of amazons are blue-fronted amazons and yellow-crowned/yellow-headed amazons. A 1992 ban on wild bird trade by the US led to a sharp drop in the trade and a diversion of 66% of it to the European Union, and a further EU ban on the trade in 2005 led to another drop. Between 1980 and 2013, 372,988 amazon parrots were traded. Some illegal trade still occurs between Mexico and the United States.

<text>The League of Corinth, also referred to as the Hellenic League (, &quot;koinòn tõn Hellḗnōn&quot;; or simply , &quot;the Héllēnes&quot;), was a federation of Greek states created by Philip II in 338–337 BC. The League was created in order to unify Greek military forces under Macedonian leadership (hegemony) in their combined conquest of the Persian Achaemenid Empire.

King Philip was initially urged by Isocrates in 346 BC to unify Greece against the Persians. After the Battle of Chaeronea, the League of Corinth was formed and controlled by Philip. Alexander utilized his father&#x27;s league when planning his pan-Hellenic invasion of Asia to expand Macedon and take revenge on the Persian Empire. During the Hellenistic period, some Antigonid rulers of Macedon shortly revived the league, also known as the &#x27;Hellenic Alliance&#x27;.

The title &#x27;League of Corinth&#x27; was invented by modern historians because the first council of the League took place in Corinth, albeit the Greek word &quot;synedrion&quot; is better translated as &quot;congress&quot; or &quot;conference&quot; rather than &quot;league&quot;. The adjective Hellenic derives from &quot;Hellenikos&quot; meaning &quot;pertaining to Greece and Greeks&quot;. The organization was the first time in history that the Greek city-states (with the notable exception of Sparta, which would join only later under Alexander&#x27;s terms) would unify under a single political entity.

== Background ==

From the mid-fourth century BC, the system of city-states (&quot;poleis&quot;) was gradually challenged by the ideas of pan-Hellenic unity, forwarded by some writers and orators, including Isocrates, who urged king Philip (in Isocrates&#x27; &quot;Philippus&quot; oration) to unify Greek powers against the Persians. Pan-Hellenic unity was only achieved with the rise of Macedon. Following his victory at the Battle of Chaeronea (337 BC), Philip was able to impose a settlement upon southern Greece, which all states accepted, with the exception of Sparta. Philip had no intention of besieging any city, nor indeed of conquering it, but rather he wanted the southern Greeks as his allies for his planned campaign against the Persians. In the months after the battle, he moved around Greece making peace with the states that opposed him, dealing with the Spartans, and installing garrisons. In mid 337 BC, he seems to have camped near Corinth and began the work to establish a league of the city-states, which would guarantee peace in Greece and provide Philip with military assistance against Persia. The principal terms of the concord were that all members became allied to each other, and to Macedon, and that all members were guaranteed freedom from attack, freedom of navigation, and freedom from interference in internal affairs. The council then declared war on Persia and voted Philip as &quot;strategos&quot; for the forthcoming campaign.

==Organization==
The League was governed by the Hegemon (leader) (&quot;strategos autokrator&quot; in a military context), the council (&quot;Synedrion&quot;), and the judges (&quot;Dikastai&quot;). Delegates of the member-states (&quot;Synedroi&quot;) were responsible for administering the common affairs of the League. They were summoned and presided over by a committee of presiding officers (&quot;Proedroi&quot;), chosen by lot in time of peace, and by the Hegemon in time of war. Decrees of the league were issued in Corinth, Athens, Delphi, Olympia and Pydna. The League maintained an army levied from member states in approximate proportion to their size, while Philip established Hellenic garrisons (commanded by phrourarchs, or garrison commanders) in Corinth, Thebes, Pydna and Ambracia.

==Treaty of the Common Peace==
All members states of the League of Corinth were listed in the oath they sworn under the &#x27;Treaty of the Common Peace&#x27; (&quot;Koine Eirene&quot;). The peace was watched over by a Macedonian garrison positioned at the heights of the Acrocorinth and Chalcis, as well as at the Cadmea of Thebes. (A fragmentary inscription of the oath was found in Athens)

===Translation===
==Alexandrian campaigns==
The decision for the destruction of Thebes as transgressor of the above oath was taken by the council of the League of Corinth by a large majority. Beyond the violation of the oath, the council judged that the Thebans were thus finally punished for their betrayal of the Greeks during the Persian Wars. The League is mentioned by Arrian (I, 16, 7), after the Battle of Granicus (334 BC). Alexander sent 300 panoplies to the temple of Pallas Athena in Athens, with the following inscription. 

Also, Diodorus Siculus (Βίβλος ΙΖ’ 48.[6]) mentions the council&#x27;s decision in 333 BC, after the Battle of Issus, to send ambassadors to Alexander that will bring the &quot;Excellence of Greece&quot; (Golden Wreath). During 331 BC after the Battle of Megalopolis, Sparta appealed to Alexander for terms, to which he agreed on condition that the Lacedaemonians now joined the League of Corinth. During the Asiatic campaign, Antipater was appointed deputy hegemon of the League while Alexander personally recommended that the Athenians turn their attention to things; in case something happened to him, Athens would take over the power in Greece.

==Aftermath==
The League was dissolved after the Lamian War in 322 BC. Following the victory of Demetrius I Poliorcetes at the Battle of Salamis in 306 BC, his father, Antigonus I Monophthalmus, assumed the title of &quot;Basileus&quot; (&quot;King&quot; of Alexander&#x27;s Empire) by the assembled armies and gained control over the Aegean, the eastern Mediterranean, and most of the Middle East. While Antigonus and Demetrius attempted to recreate Philip II&#x27;s Hellenic league with themselves as dual hegemons, a revived coalition of the diadochi; Cassander, Ptolemy I Soter, Seleucus I Nicator, and Lysimachus decisively defeated them at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC, in which Antigonus I was killed.

Antigonus III Doson (r. 229 – 221 BC) revived the Hellenic League, this time better known as the &#x27;Hellenic Alliance&#x27;, in 224 BC placing himself as the president. The league functioned as an alliance (&quot;symmachia&quot;) of existing Greek federations under Macedonian hegemony. This alliance consisted not of &quot;poleis&quot;, but rather of larger regional entities, like the Achaeans, Thessalians, Boeotians, Epirotes etc. These federations maintained internal autonomy, but were interdependent with respect to foreign policy. Antigonus&#x27; league expanded Antigonid rule in southern Greece recovering Arcadia in 224 BC and defeating king Cleomenes III of Sparta at the Battle of Sellasia in 222 BC. Doson managed to restore internal stability in Macedon and reestablish its position as the dominant power in Hellenistic Greece.

<doc id="163426" wikidata="Q138340" url="?curid=163426" title="Kaiser">
<text>Kaiser ( ; ) is the title historically used by German and Austrian emperors. In German, the title in principle applies to rulers anywhere in the world above the rank of king (). In English, the word &quot;kaiser&quot; is mainly applied to the emperors of the unified German Empire (1871–1918) and the emperors of the Austrian Empire (1804–1918). During the First World War, anti-German sentiment was at its zenith; the term &quot;kaiser&quot;—especially as applied to Wilhelm II, German Emperor—thus gained considerable negative connotations in English-speaking countries.

Especially in Central Europe, between northern Italy and southern Poland, between western Austria and western Ukraine and in Bavaria, Emperor Franz Joseph I is still associated with (the emperor) today. As a result of his long reign from 1848 to 1916 and the associated Golden Age before the First World War, this title often has still a very high historical respect in this geographical area.

==Etymology and language usage==
Similarly to the Slavic title &quot;tsar&quot;, &quot;kaiser&quot; is directly derived from the Roman emperors&#x27; title of &quot;Caesar&quot;, which in turn is derived from the personal name of the Julii Caesares, a branch of the &quot;gens&quot; (clan) Julia, to which Gaius Julius Caesar, the forebear of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, belonged. It has been suggested, on the grounds of an anecdote reported in e.g. Suetonius (&quot;Divus Julius&quot; 79.2), that Caesar himself once used his cognomen by way of a title; but this is ultimately unlikely.

Although the British monarchs styled &quot;Emperor of India&quot; were also called &quot;Kaisar-i-Hind&quot; in Hindi and Urdu, this word, although ultimately sharing the same Latin origin, is derived from the Persian &quot;Kaysar&quot;, not the German .

 (Weather of the emperor) is a colloquial expression and means in German &quot;Sunny weather&quot; with a deep blue, cloudless sky. According to Duden, this proverb goes back to the mostly bright sunshine on 18 August, the birthday of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. Kaiserschmarrn (Emperor&#x27;s Mess) is a lightly sweetened pancake that takes its name also from Franz Joseph I. Also with the Austrian (&quot;Kaiser roll&quot;), (&quot;Kaiser meat&quot;) or (&quot;Kaiser soup&quot;) the word &quot;kaiser&quot; is supposed to denote the ultimate highest increase, the best of its kind. &quot;Kaiserjäger&quot; and &quot;Kaiserschützen&quot; were special elite units of the Imperial and Royal (k.u.k.) Austro-Hungarian Armed Forces, especially expressed by the part of the name Kaiser.

 is the nickname of both Franz Beckenbauer, a German footballer active in the 1960s and 1970s who captained West Germany to the 1974 World Cup title, and of the Austrian ski racer and 1976 Olympic champion Franz Klammer - both in an allusion to the Austrian Kaiser Franz I.

== German history and antecedents of the title ==
The Holy Roman Emperors called themselves &quot;Kaiser&quot;, combining the imperial title with that of &quot;King of the Romans&quot; (assumed by the designated heir before the imperial coronation); they saw their rule as a continuation of that of the Roman Emperors and used the title derived from the title &quot;Caesar&quot; to reflect their supposed heritage. From 1452 to 1806, except for the years 1742–1745, only members of the Habsburg family were &quot;Holy Roman Emperors&quot;.

In 1806, the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved, but the title of &quot;kaiser&quot; was retained by the House of Habsburg, the head of which, beginning in 1804, bore the title of Kaiser of Austria. After 1273, the Habsburgs provided most of Holy Roman Kings or Emperors, so they saw themselves as legitimate heirs to the title they adopted. Despite Habsburg ambitions, however, the Austrian Empire could no longer claim to rule over most of Germany, although they did rule over large areas of lands inhabited by non-Germans in addition to Austria. According to the historian Friedrich Heer, the Austrian Habsburg emperor remained an &quot;auctoritas&quot; of a special kind. He was &quot;the grandson of the Caesars&quot;, he remained the patron of the holy church, but without excluding other religions. In this tradition, the Austrian emperor saw himself as the protector of his peoples, minorities and all religious communities. In this regard, minorities in the Habsburg Monarchy, but also the Jews on the one hand and the Muslims on the other hand were particularly loyal to the emperor (German: &quot;kaisertreu&quot;).

In 1867 the Austrian Empire was divided into the state of Austria-Hungary (the so-called Danube Monarchy), with Franz Joseph I, like his successor Karl I, being Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary. As a result of this centuries-long uninterrupted tradition, today family members of the Habsburgs are often referred to as Imperial Highnesses (German: Kaiserliche Hoheit) and, for example, the members of the Imperial and Royal Order of Saint George as Imperial Knights. There were four kaisers of the Austrian Empire who all belonged to the Habsburg dynasty. They had an official list of crowns, titles, and dignities (Grand title of the emperor of Austria). 

The kaisers of the Austrian Empire (1804–1918) were:
* Franz I (1804–1835);
* Ferdinand I (1835–1848);
* Franz Joseph I (1848–1916);
* Karl I (1916–1918).

Karl von Habsburg is currently the head of the House of Habsburg.

With the unification of Germany (aside from Austria) in 1871, there was some debate about the exact title for the monarch of those German territories (such as free imperial cities, principalities, duchies, and kingdoms) that agreed to unify under the leadership of Prussia, thereby forming the new German Empire. The first kaiser himself preferred either (&quot;Emperor of Germany&quot;). In the end, his chancellor Bismarck&#x27;s choice (&quot;German Emperor&quot;) was adopted as it simply connoted that the new emperor, hearkening from Prussia, was a German, but did not imply that this new emperor had dominion over all German territories, especially since the Austrian kaiser would have been offended as Austria, inhabited by Germans, was still considered part of the German lands. There were only three kaisers of the (second) German Empire. All of them belonged to the Hohenzollern dynasty, which, as kings of Prussia, and had been &quot;de facto&quot; leaders of lesser Germany (Germany excluding Austria).

The kaisers of the German Empire (1871–1918) were:
* Wilhelm I (1871–1888);
* Friedrich III (9 March – 15 June 1888), who ruled for 99 days;
* Wilhelm II (1888–1918), during whose reign the monarchy in Germany ended near the end of World War I.

Georg Friedrich Ferdinand, Prince of Prussia, is currently head of the House of Hohenzollern, which was the former ruling dynasty of the German Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia.

<doc id="163427" wikidata="Q212418" url="?curid=163427" title="Rōnin">
<text>In feudal Japan (1185–1868), a rōnin ( ; , , &#x27;drifter&#x27; or &#x27;wandering man&#x27;, ) was a samurai who had no lord or master and in some cases, had also severed all links with his family or clan. A samurai became a &quot;rōnin&quot; upon the death of his master, or after the loss of his master&#x27;s favor or legal privilege.

In modern Japanese, the term is usually used to describe a salaryman who is unemployed or a secondary school graduate who has not yet been admitted to university.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;rōnin&quot; is usually translated to &#x27;drifter&#x27; or &#x27;wanderer&#x27;; however, per kanji, means &quot;wave&quot; as on the water, as well as &quot;unrestrained, dissolute&quot;, while means &quot;person&quot;. It is an idiomatic expression for &#x27;vagrant&#x27; or &#x27;wanderer&#x27;, someone who does not belong to one place. The term originated in the Nara and Heian periods, when it referred to a serf who had fled or deserted his master&#x27;s land. It later came to be used for a samurai who had no master. In medieval times, the ronin were depicted as the shadows of samurai, master-less and not honorable. 

==Status==
According to the &quot;Bushido Shoshinshu&quot; (the &quot;Code of the Warrior&quot;), a samurai was supposed to commit &quot;seppuku&quot; (also &quot;harakiri&quot;, &quot;belly cutting&quot;, a form of ritual suicide) upon the loss of his master. One who chose not to honor the code was &quot;on his own&quot; and was meant to suffer great shame. The undesirability of &quot;rōnin&quot; status was mainly a discrimination imposed by other samurai and by &quot;daimyō&quot;, the feudal lords.

Like other samurai, &quot;rōnin&quot; wore two swords. &quot;Rōnin&quot; used a variety of other weapons as well. Some &quot;rōnin&quot;—usually those who lacked money—would carry a &quot;bō&quot; (staff around ) or &quot;jō&quot; (smaller staff or walking stick around ) or a &quot;yumi&quot; (bow). Most weapons would reflect the &quot;ryū&quot; (martial arts school) from which they came if they were students.

During the Edo period, with the shogunate&#x27;s rigid class system and laws, the number of &quot;rōnin&quot; greatly increased; confiscation of fiefs during the rule of the third Tokugawa shōgun Iemitsu resulted in an especially large increase of their number. During previous ages, samurai were able to move between masters and even between occupations. They could also marry between classes. However, during the Edo period, samurai were restricted, and were—above all—forbidden to become employed by another master without their previous master&#x27;s permission.

Because the former samurai could not legally take up a new trade, or because of pride were loath to do so, many &quot;rōnin&quot; looked for other ways to make a living with their swords. Those &quot;rōnin&quot; who desired steady, legal employment became mercenaries that guarded trade caravans, or bodyguards for wealthy merchants. Many other &quot;rōnin&quot; became criminals, operating as bandits and highwaymen, or joining organized crime in towns and cities. &quot;Rōnin&quot; were known to operate or serve as hired muscle for gangs that ran gambling rings, brothels, protection rackets, and similar activities. Many were petty thieves and muggers. The criminal segment gave the &quot;rōnin&quot; of the Edo period a persistent reputation of disgrace, with an image of thugs, bullies, cutthroats, and wandering vagrants. After the abolition of the Samurai, some of the ronin continued with their thuggery and their mercenary work and activities, such as participating in the infamous assassination of Korean Empress Myeongseong of the Joseon Dynasty in 1895, the Eulmi Incident.

== History ==

Until the Sengoku period, peasants accounted for the majority of &quot;daimyō&quot; armies, so they accounted for the majority of ronin.

Especially in the Sengoku period, &quot;daimyō&quot; needed additional fighting men, and even if a master had perished, his &quot;rōnin&quot; was able to serve new lords. In contrast to the later Edo period, the bond between the lord and the vassal was loose, and some vassals who were dissatisfied with their treatment left their masters and sought new lords. Many warriors served a succession of masters, and some even became &quot;daimyō&quot;. As an example, Tōdō Takatora served ten lords. Additionally, the division of the population into classes had not yet taken place, so it was possible to change one&#x27;s occupation from warrior to merchant or farmer, or the reverse. Saitō Dōsan was one merchant who rose through the warrior ranks to become a &quot;daimyō&quot;.

As Toyotomi Hideyoshi unified progressively more significant parts of the country, &quot;daimyō&quot; found it unnecessary to recruit new soldiers. The Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 resulted in the confiscation or reduction of the fiefs of large numbers of &quot;daimyō&quot; on the losing side; consequently, many samurai became &quot;rōnin&quot;. As many as a hundred thousand &quot;rōnin&quot; joined forces with Toyotomi Hideyori and fought at the Siege of Osaka. In the ensuing years of peace, there was less need to maintain expensive standing armies, and many surviving &quot;rōnin&quot; turned to farms or became townspeople. A few, such as Yamada Nagamasa, sought adventure overseas as mercenaries. Still, the majority lived in poverty as &quot;rōnin&quot;. Their number approached half a million under the third Tokugawa shōgun Iemitsu.

Initially, the shogunate viewed them as dangerous and banished them from the cities or restricted the quarters where they could live. They also prohibited serving new masters. As &quot;rōnin&quot; found fewer options, they joined in the Keian Uprising of 1651. This forced the shogunate to rethink its policy. It relaxed restrictions on &quot;daimyō&quot; inheritance, resulting in fewer confiscations of fiefs, and it permitted &quot;rōnin&quot; to join new masters.

Not having the status or power of employed samurai, &quot;rōnin&quot; were often disreputable and festive, the group targeted humiliation or satire. It was undesirable to be a &quot;rōnin&quot;, as it meant being without a stipend or land. As an indication of the shame felt by samurai who became &quot;rōnin&quot;, Lord Redesdale recorded that a &quot;rōnin&quot; killed himself at the graves of the forty-seven &quot;rōnin&quot;. He left a note saying that he had tried to enter the service of the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Chōshū Domain but was refused. He killed himself, wanting to serve no other master and hating being a &quot;rōnin&quot;. On the other hand, the famous 18th-century writer Kyokutei Bakin renounced his allegiance to Matsudaira Nobunari, in whose service Bakin&#x27;s samurai father had spent his life. Bakin voluntarily became a &quot;rōnin&quot;, and eventually spent his time writing books (many of them about samurai) and engaging in festivities.

In the 19th century, Emperor Meiji abolished the Samurai class and any status the ronin had died with them.

<doc id="163428" wikidata="Q4673593" url="?curid=163428" title="Acheiropodia">
<text>Acheiropodia, also known as Horn Kolb syndrome, is a genetic condition that affects limb development, resulting in shortened arms and legs and absent hands and feet on both sides of the body at birth. Specifically, individuals are born missing the epiphysis typically found at the end of the humerus bone of the upper arm, the diaphysis which makes up the long section of the tibia bone of the shin, the radius and ulna bones which make up the lower arm, the fibula bone of the shin, and all hand and foot bones. It was first discovered and is prevalent almost exclusively in Brazil.

==Signs and symptoms==
== Discovery and Prevalence ==

Acheiropodia was first described in Brazil in 1929 and the variations in expression (the range in severity and type of signs and symptoms experienced by patients), namely the presence or absence of digits on upper limbs or the Bohomeletz bone (a small, elongated bone located at the upper limb tips, parallel to the humerus and suggested to be what would have developed into the ulna), were further documented in 1930. It was noted that the presence of one or more digits on upper limbs was consistently associated with the absence of the Bohomeletz bone, and when the Bohomeletz bone was attached, digits were absent from the residual limbs. Acheiropodia cases have been described in Turkey, Argentina, Ireland, and the United States. It was estimated that there were 3 cases of acheiropodia for every 10 million people.

==Genetics==

Acheiropodia results from a change in the DNA sequence of the &quot;C7rof2&quot; gene. Genes code for proteins. When this altered gene is copied for its protein instructions, the resulting instructions are processed differently from the unaltered instructions. This effectively cuts out one of the protein-coding segments called exon 4, which is needed for the final protein. The absence of this segment causes the reading of protein instructions to stop prematurely. This leads to a shorter, non-functional protein.

The &quot;C7rof2&quot; gene is the human equivalent of the mouse gene &quot;LMBR1&quot;, which encodes an essential protein for limb development. When there is no functional protein present, limb development does not occur correctly, and individuals are born with acheiropodia. However, all individuals have two sets of chromosomes and thus two copies of the &quot;C7orf2&quot; gene. The non-functional protein resulting from one altered gene does not interfere with the functional copy of the protein, so acheiropodia only occurs in those who have this rare change in both copies of &quot;C7orf2&quot;. This makes it an autosomal-recessive condition, meaning that individuals will only be affected by acheiropodia if both parents carry one copy of the altered gene without experiencing symptoms, resulting in the inheritance of one acheiropodia gene copy from each parent.
The &quot;C7rof2&quot; DNA sequence is very stable and changes occur rarely, partly explaining the rarity of this condition. Since the rare gene copy is unlikely to be found in parents from two unrelated families, acheiropodia is often caused by consanguineous marriages in which genetically related individuals have children together.

==Molecular Mechanism==

In Acheiropodia, 12,000 letters of DNA are removed, eliminating three CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites. CTCF sites are where CTCF proteins bind. CTCF proteins help organize the genome by forming a topologically associating domain (TAD). TADs are regions of the genome where specific genes and regulatory elements, like enhancers, are grouped together in close physical proximity. The genome is dynamic and spatial organization influences which proteins are produced in the cell. To produce a protein, genes need the help of other genomic regions to become active. These regulatory regions need to be near genes to enable physical interactions and control of protein production. TADs enable frequent interactions of DNA elements within each group, thus assisting with regulating gene expression, an essential developmental process. When the three CTCF sites are present, they help an enhancer called ZRS (zone of polarizing activity regulatory sequence), which is found in intron 5 of the &quot;LMBR1&quot; gene, interact with the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) promoter. SHH is an important protein in limb development. When the ZRS enhancer can interact with the SHH promoter, there is increased expression of the SHH protein. However, in the case of acheiropodia, the 3 CTCF sites are missing, which prevents ZRS from interacting with the SHH promoter. This results in decreased SHH protein production for limb development.

==Diagnosis==
The rarity and subsequent lack of information on acheiropodia makes prenatal diagnosis difficult. Diagnosis depends on prenatal ultrasound screening, with a failure to visualize bones at the ends of fetal limbs. Due to variable expressivity (range in severity and types of signs and symptoms experienced by patients) of the C7rof2 gene, acheiropodia presents differently among affected individuals, adding to the difficulty of diagnosis. Fingers are sometimes present, and a small bone at the tip of the shortened limb (the Bohomoletz bone) may or may not be present.

Acheiropodia has been diagnosed at as early as 16 weeks post-conception, although research on similar conditions suggests it may be diagnosed even earlier. If ultrasound screening indicates possible acheiropodia, further (more invasive) testing may be performed, including genetic analysis of either an amniotic fluid sample or placenta (chorionic villus) sample to confirm diagnosis. In the case of fetal death or termination, autopsy findings may conclude in a diagnosis.

== Treatment ==
Even with early prenatal diagnosis, due to its genetic basis acheiropodia cannot currently be prevented or cured. However, once a child is born with acheiropodia, prosthetics could improve their quality of life. Surgery may be considered on a case-by-case basis to optimize prosthetic fitting. Prosthetic fitting should occur before 2 years of age to minimize the risk of rejection. Ideally, fitting should begin around the 6-9 month mark, when healthy infants typically begin using their hands and feet to stand and handle objects. Even without prosthetics, many children with limb loss learn to functionally use their residual limbs and may prefer not to use prostheses so that they can maintain proprioception (i.e. sense of the body&#x27;s position and motion) and sensory feedback that would otherwise be reduced. Some children may adapt with compensatory skills that are more effective than prostheses. A multidisciplinary approach may best treat the medical, psychological, and developmental challenges that may occur in infants missing all four limbs.

==Challenges with Studying==

Acheiropodia has proven to be challenging for researchers to study. Mice often serve as a model system to study human disease due to their similar physiology and genetics. However, it was previously observed that when the 12,000 letters of DNA in the mouse equivalent of the &quot;C7rof2&quot; human gene were removed, limbs developed normally. The discrepancy in whether acheiropodia was present is likely due to differences in chromosomal interaction regulation, influenced by the location and orientation of the CTCF sites, among other factors, which may or may not be conserved between mice and humans.

Additionally, given the rarity of the condition there is a limited pool of affected patients who could participate in future research. The ethical implications with studying a gene expressed early in embryonic development, like the SHH gene, means that it can be difficult to obtain tissues for analysis.

<doc id="163430" wikidata="Q332347" url="?curid=163430" title="John Profumo">
<text>John Dennis Profumo ( ; 30 January 1915 – 9 March 2006) was a British politician whose career ended in 1963 after a sexual relationship with the 19-year-old model Christine Keeler in 1961. The scandal, which became known as the Profumo affair, led to his resignation from the Conservative government of Harold Macmillan.

After his resignation Profumo worked as a volunteer at Toynbee Hall, a charity in East London, and became its chief fundraiser. These charitable activities helped to restore his reputation and he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1975.

== Early life and career ==
Profumo was born in Kensington, London, the son of Albert Profumo, a diplomat and barrister of Italian ancestry, who died in 1940. He attended Harrow School and Brasenose College, Oxford. Whilst at Oxford Profumo was a member of the Bullingdon Club.
In 1933, &quot;Jack&quot; Profumo began a long-term relationship with a German student, Gisela Klein, who later became a model and subsequently worked for German intelligence in Paris, and eventually married an American called Edward Winegard. Secret Service papers state Profumo also wrote to Winegard while he was an MP.

On 1 July 1939, Profumo was commissioned into the Royal Armoured Corps as a second lieutenant. He had previously been a member of the Officer Training Corps and a Cadet Sergeant while at Harrow. He served in North Africa with the Northamptonshire Yeomanry as a Captain (acting major), where he was mentioned in dispatches. He landed in Normandy on D-Day and was engaged in the subsequent fierce fighting to secure that region of France. His final rank in the British Army was brigadier.

On 21 December 1944, Major (temporary Lieutenant Colonel) Profumo was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE, Military Division) &quot;in recognition of gallant and distinguished service in Italy&quot;, specifically, for his service on Field Marshal Sir Harold Alexander&#x27;s staff commanding the 15th Army Group. In November 1947, Acting Colonel Profumo was awarded the Bronze Star Medal by the United States &quot;in recognition of distinguished services in the cause of the Allies&quot;.

== Political career ==
In 1940, while still serving in the Army, Profumo was elected to the House of Commons as a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Kettering in Northamptonshire at a by-election on 3 March.

Shortly afterwards he voted against the Chamberlain government in the debate following the British defeat at Narvik in Norway. This defiance on Profumo&#x27;s part enraged the Chief Whip, David Margesson, who said to him &quot;I can tell you this, you utterly contemptible little shit. On every morning that you wake up for the rest of your life you will be ashamed of what you did last night.&quot; Profumo later remarked that Margesson &quot;couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong&quot;.

Profumo was then the youngest MP and, by the time of his death, he had become the last surviving former member of the 1940 House of Commons. At the 1945 election, Profumo was defeated at Kettering by the Labour candidate, Dick Mitchison. Later in 1945, he was chief of staff to the British Mission to Japan. In 1950, he left the Army and, at the general election in February 1950, he was elected for Stratford-on-Avon in Warwickshire, a safe Conservative seat.

Profumo was a well-connected politician with a good war record and, despite Margesson&#x27;s aforementioned outburst, was highly regarded in the Conservative Party. Those qualities helped him to rise steadily through the ranks of the Conservative government elected in 1951. He was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Civil Aviation in November 1952, Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation in November 1953, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies in January 1957, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office in November 1958, and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs in January 1959. In July 1960, he was appointed Secretary of State for War (outside of the Cabinet) and was sworn of the Privy Council. In 1954, he married the actress Valerie Hobson.

== The Profumo affair ==
In July 1961, at a party at Cliveden, home of Viscount Astor, John Profumo met Christine Keeler, a 19-year-old model with whom he began a sexual relationship. The exact length of the affair between Profumo and Keeler is disputed, ending either in August 1961 after Profumo was warned by the security services of the possible dangers of mixing with the Ward circle, or continuing with decreasing fervour until December 1961. Since Keeler had also had sexual relations with Yevgeny Ivanov, the senior naval attaché at the Soviet Embassy, the matter took on a national-security dimension.

In December 1962, a shooting incident in London involving two other men who were involved with Keeler led the press to investigate her, and reporters soon learned of her affairs with Profumo and Ivanov. But the British tradition of respecting the private lives of British politicians, for fear of libel actions, was maintained until March 1963, when the Labour MP George Wigg, claiming to be motivated by the national-security aspects of the case, and taking advantage of Parliamentary privilege, which gave him immunity from any possible legal action, referred in the House of Commons to the rumours linking Profumo with Keeler. Profumo then made a personal statement in which he admitted he knew Keeler but denied there was any &quot;impropriety&quot; in their relationship and threatened to sue if newspapers asserted otherwise.

Profumo&#x27;s statement did not prevent newspapers publishing stories about Keeler, and it soon became apparent to Macmillan that Profumo&#x27;s position was untenable. On 5 June 1963, Profumo was forced to admit that he had lied to the House in March when he denied an affair with Keeler, which at that time was an unforgivable offence in British politics. Profumo resigned from office and from the Privy Council, and applied for and was appointed to the role of steward of the Chiltern Hundreds to give up his Commons seat. Before making his public confession, Profumo confessed the affair to his wife, who stood by him. It was never shown that his relationship with Keeler had led to any breach of national security. The scandal rocked the Conservative government, and was generally held to have been among the causes of its defeat by Labour at the 1964 election. Macmillan had already gone by then, having resigned in October 1963 on health grounds to be succeeded by Alec Douglas-Home.

Profumo maintained complete public silence about the matter for the rest of his life, even when the 1989 film &quot;Scandal&quot;—in which he was played by Ian McKellen—and the publication of Keeler&#x27;s memoirs revived public interest in the affair.

Profumo was portrayed by Daniel Flynn in Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s stage musical &quot;Stephen Ward&quot;, which opened at the Aldwych Theatre on 19 December 2013.

He was portrayed by Ben Miles in the 2019/2020 BBC drama &quot;The Trial of Christine Keeler&quot; and by Tim Steed in the Netflix series &quot;The Crown&quot;, where the Profumo Affair is part of the plot for season 2, episode 10 – &quot;Mystery Man&quot;.

== Later life ==

Shortly after his resignation, Profumo was invited to work at Toynbee Hall as a volunteer by Walter Birmingham, who was a warden there. Toynbee Hall is a charity based in the East End of London, and Profumo continued to work there for the rest of his life, becoming Toynbee Hall&#x27;s chief fundraiser, and using his political skills and contacts to raise large sums of money. All this work was done as a volunteer, since Profumo was able to live on his inherited wealth.

His wife, the actress Valerie Hobson, also devoted herself to charity until her death in 1998.

In the eyes of some, Profumo&#x27;s charity work redeemed his reputation. His friend, social reform campaigner Lord Longford, said he &quot;felt more admiration [for Profumo] than [for] all the men I&#x27;ve known in my lifetime&quot;.

Profumo was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE, Civil Division) in the 1975 Birthday Honours, and received the honour at a Buckingham Palace ceremony from Queen Elizabeth II, signalling his return to respectability. In 1995, former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher invited him to her 70th birthday dinner, where he sat next to the Queen. He appeared only occasionally in public, particularly in his last years when he used a wheelchair. His last appearance was at the memorial service for Sir Edward Heath on 8 November 2005.

==Death and tributes==
On 7 March 2006, Profumo suffered a stroke and was admitted to London&#x27;s Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. He died two days later surrounded by his family, at the age of 91. After his death, many commentators said that he should be remembered as much for his contribution to society after his fall from political grace as for the scandal of 1963 which caused that fall. He was cremated at Mortlake Crematorium; his ashes were buried next to those of his wife at the family vault in front of St Peter&#x27;s Church in Hersham.

<text>Babette Louisa Valerie Hobson (14 April 1917 – 13 November 1998) was a British actress whose film career spanned the 1930s to the early 1950s. Her second husband was John Profumo, a British government minister who became the subject of the Profumo affair in 1963.

==Early years==
Hobson was born at Sandy Bay, Larne, County Antrim, in Ulster, Ireland, to Robert Gordon Hobson, who was a Commander in the Royal Navy, and Violette née Willoughby.

Before she was 11 years old, Hobson had begun to study acting and dancing at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts.

==Career==
In 1935, aged 18, Hobson appeared as Baroness Frankenstein in &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; with Boris Karloff and Colin Clive. She played opposite Henry Hull that same year in &quot;Werewolf of London&quot;, the first Hollywood werewolf film. The latter half of the 1940s saw Hobson in perhaps her two most memorable roles: as the adult Estella in David Lean&#x27;s (1908-1991) adaptation of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1946), and as the refined and virtuous Edith D&#x27;Ascoyne in the black comedy &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; (1949).

Hobson&#x27;s last starring role was in the original London production of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s musical play &quot;The King and I&quot;, which opened at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, on 8 October 1953. She played Mrs. Anna Leonowens opposite Herbert Lom&#x27;s King. The show ran for 926 performances.

==Personal life and death==
In 1952, Hobson divorced her first husband, film producer Anthony Havelock-Allan. In 1954, she married Brigadier John Profumo, a Member of Parliament (MP), giving up acting shortly afterwards. Profumo was a prominent politician of Italian descent.

After Profumo&#x27;s ministerial career ended in disgrace in 1963, following revelations he had lied to the House of Commons about his affair with Christine Keeler, Hobson stood by him, and they worked together for charity for the remainder of her life, although she did miss their more public personas.

Hobson&#x27;s eldest son, Simon Anthony Clerveaux Havelock-Allan, was born in May 1944 with Down&#x27;s Syndrome, and died in January 1991. Her middle child, Mark Havelock-Allan, was born on 4 April 1951 and became a judge. Her youngest child is the author David Profumo, who wrote &quot;Bringing the House Down: A Family Memoir&quot; (2006) about the scandal. In it, he writes that his parents told him nothing of the scandal and he learned of it from another boy at school.

Hobson died in 1998, aged 81. After her death, her body was cremated at Mortlake Crematorium in accordance with her wishes. Half of her ashes were interred in the family vault in Hersham, and the rest were scattered on 1 January 1999 by her sons David Profumo and Mark Havelock-Allan, near the family&#x27;s farm in Scotland.

==In popular culture==
Hobson was portrayed by Deborah Grant in the film &quot;Scandal&quot; (1989); by Joanna Riding in Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s stage musical &quot;Stephen Ward the Musical&quot;, which opened at the Aldwych Theatre on 19 December 2013; and by Emilia Fox in the BBC miniseries &quot;The Trial of Christine Keeler&quot; in 2019.

<text>Christine Margaret Keeler (22 February 1942 – 4 December 2017) was an English model and showgirl. Her meeting at a dance club with society osteopath Stephen Ward drew her into fashionable circles. At the height of the Cold War, she became sexually involved with a married British government minister, John Profumo, as well as with a Soviet naval attaché, Yevgeny Ivanov. A shooting incident involving a third lover caused the press to investigate her, revealing that her affairs could be threatening national security. In the House of Commons, Profumo denied any improper conduct but later admitted to having lied.

This incident discredited the Conservative government of Harold Macmillan in 1963, in what became known as the Profumo affair. Keeler was alleged to have been a prostitute, which was not a criminal offence. Ward was, however, found guilty of being her pimp; a trial was instigated after the embarrassment caused to the government. The trial has since been considered a miscarriage of justice and a charade orchestrated by the establishment to protect itself.

== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
Keeler was born in Uxbridge, Middlesex. Her father, Colin Sean Keeler (later known as Colin King, 1921–1976), abandoned the family in 1945. She was brought up by her mother, Julie Ellen (, 1923–2012), and stepfather, Edward Huish, in a house made from two converted railway carriages in the Berkshire village of Wraysbury. In 1951, at the age of 9, Keeler was sent to a holiday home in Littlehampton because the school health inspector said that she was suffering from malnutrition. She was sexually abused as a teenager both by her stepfather and his friends, for whom she babysat.

At the age of 15, she found work as a model at a dress shop in London&#x27;s Soho. At age 17, she gave birth to a son after an affair with a United States Air Force sergeant; the child was born prematurely on 17 April 1959 and survived just six days.

That summer, Keeler left Wraysbury, staying briefly in Slough with a friend before heading for London. She initially worked as a waitress at a restaurant on Baker Street, where she met Maureen O&#x27;Connor, who worked at Murray&#x27;s Cabaret Club in Soho. O&#x27;Connor introduced Keeler to the owner, Percy Murray, who hired her almost immediately as a topless showgirl.

At Murray&#x27;s, she met Stephen Ward, an osteopath and artist. His practice and art brought considerable social success, and he made many influential friends. The two soon lived together with the outward appearance of being a couple, but, according to her, it was a platonic, non-sexual relationship. In her autobiography, , Keeler maintained that Ward was working as a double agent, having contact with both senior members of MI5 and the KGB, and was passing UK state secrets to the latter.

=== Profumo affair ===

On the weekend of 8–9 July 1961, Ward introduced Keeler to John Profumo, the Secretary of State for War, at a pool party at Cliveden, the Buckinghamshire mansion owned by the 3rd Viscount Astor. Profumo began a brief affair with Keeler, the exact length of which is disputed. It either ended in August 1961, after the security services warned Profumo of the possible dangers of mixing with the Ward circle, or it continued with decreasing fervour until December 1961. Among Ward&#x27;s other friends, whom Profumo briefly met, was the Soviet naval attaché and GRU officer, Yevgeny Ivanov. According to Keeler, she and Ivanov had a short sexual relationship.

After her relationship with Profumo ended, Keeler was sexually involved with several partners, including Jamaican jazz singer Lucky Gordon and Antiguan jazz promoter Johnny Edgecombe. There was considerable jealousy between the two men; in one quarrel on 27 October 1962, Edgecombe slashed Gordon&#x27;s face with a knife. When Keeler ended the relationship with Edgecombe in December 1962, Edgecombe turned up at Ward&#x27;s house in Wimpole Mews on 14 December, where she was temporarily seeking refuge, and fired five shots at the building. His arrest and subsequent trial brought Keeler to public attention and provided the impetus for a national scandal to develop. After initially denying any impropriety with Keeler, Profumo eventually confessed and resigned from the government and Parliament, causing great embarrassment to his government colleagues, who had previously supported him. These events, in the summer of 1963, brought Keeler notoriety; &quot;The Economist&quot; gave the headline &quot;The Prime Minister&#x27;s Crisis&quot; alongside a picture of Keeler, with no further explanation.

=== Morley portrait ===

At the height of the Profumo affair in 1963, Keeler sat for a photographic portrait by Lewis Morley. The photoshoot, at a studio on the first floor of Peter Cook&#x27;s Establishment Club, with Morley was to promote a proposed film, &quot;The Keeler Affair&quot;, that was never released in the United Kingdom. Keeler was reluctant to pose in the nude, but the film producers insisted. Morley persuaded Keeler to sit astride a plywood chair so that, while technically nude, the back of the chair would obscure most of her body. Keeler told cartoon historian Tim Benson in 2007 that she was not nude and was wearing knickers during the entire photoshoot.

The photo propelled Arne Jacobsen&#x27;s Model 3107 chair to prominence, even though the chair used was an imitation of the Model 3107, with a hand-hold aperture crudely cut out of the back to avoid copyright infringement. The particular chair used is in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The differences in the designs of the chairs are readily apparent in a side-by-side photograph.

=== Trials ===
On 18 April 1963, Keeler was attacked at a friend&#x27;s home. She accused Gordon, who was arrested and charged. At his trial, which began on 5 June, he maintained that his innocence would be established by two witnesses who, the police told the court, could not be found. On 7 June, principally on the evidence of Keeler, Gordon was found guilty and sentenced to three years imprisonment. By this time, Ward was facing trial on vice charges, and Keeler was again a main prosecution witness.

Ward&#x27;s trial, which ran 22–31 July 1963, has been characterised as &quot;an act of political revenge&quot; for the embarrassment caused to the government. He was accused of living off immoral earnings earned through Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies based on the small contributions to household expenses or loan repayments the two had made to Ward while living with him. Ward&#x27;s professional earnings as an osteopath were a substantial £5,500 a year (£ in ) at the time these small payments were made. After a hostile summing-up from the trial judge, Ward was convicted, but took an overdose of barbiturates and died before the jury returned its verdict and sentence could be passed. In the closing days of Ward&#x27;s trial, Gordon&#x27;s assault conviction was overturned by the Court of Appeal when his missing witnesses were found and testified that the evidence given by Keeler was substantially false. In December 1963, Keeler pleaded guilty to charges of perjury before Sir Anthony Hawke, the Recorder of London, and was sentenced to nine months imprisonment, serving six months in prison. Her cellmate while in prison was Elizabeth Crowley, the wife of East End bank robber William Crowley, the maternal grandparents of Labour MP Wes Streeting.

=== Later life ===
After her release from prison in 1964, Keeler had two brief marriages, to James Edward Levermore (22 October 1965; dissolved 1966) and Anthony Sydney Platt (18 February 1971; separated 1972; divorced 27 May 1977). There was a child from each union, the elder being primarily raised by Keeler&#x27;s mother, Julie.

Keeler mainly lived alone in the last couple of decades of her life. Most of the considerable amount of money that she made from newspaper stories was dissipated by lawyers. She said that during the 1970s, &quot;I was not living, I was surviving&quot;. She published several accounts of her life, in one of which she claimed that she became pregnant as a result of her relationship with Profumo and subsequently had an abortion. Her portrait by Ward was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery, London, in 1984.

In 1988, Keeler was featured in Bryan Ferry&#x27;s promotional video for the single &quot;Kiss and Tell&quot; (originally released on Ferry&#x27;s seventh solo album, &quot;Bête Noire&quot;, in 1987) with Mandy Rice-Davies; this was meant to draw more attention to the song&#x27;s theme. In June 1988 she made an extended appearance on Channel 4 discussion programme &quot;After Dark&quot;.

===Death===
On 5 December 2017, Keeler&#x27;s son, Seymour Platt, announced that she had died, aged 75, the previous night at the Princess Royal University Hospital in Farnborough, London. She had been ill for some months, suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Her funeral took place on 16 December at the West London Crematorium in Kensal Green Cemetery.

== In popular culture ==
Yvonne Buckingham portrayed Keeler in a 1963 film variously titled &quot;The Christine Keeler Story&quot;, &quot;The Keeler Affair&quot;, and &quot;The Christine Keeler Affair&quot;; Keeler herself introduced the film in its opening sequence and read the cast list in voiceover at the end.

In the 1989 film about the Profumo affair, &quot;Scandal&quot;, actress Joanne Whalley portrayed Keeler.

In Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s stage musical &quot;Stephen Ward&quot;, which opened at the Aldwych Theatre in 2013, Keeler was portrayed by Charlotte Spencer.

Keeler is portrayed by Gala Gordon during the second season of the Netflix drama series &quot;The Crown&quot; in 2017.

Keeler is portrayed by Sophie Cookson in &quot;The Trial of Christine Keeler&quot;, a six-part television series screened on BBC One from 2019 to 2020.

Funded by the Arts Council England and Arts Council of Wales, a touring exhibition called &quot;Dear Christine&quot; opened in Newcastle upon Tyne in June 2019 and toured to Swansea in October 2019, finishing at Arthouse1 in London in February 2020. The culmination of a four-year project by artist/curator Fionn Wilson to reclaim and re-frame Keeler, it features work from twenty women artists &quot;in order to put a female perspective on a narrative that has mostly been led by men&quot;. The exhibition has been described by journalist and writer Julie Burchill as &quot;a thing of beauty without cruelty&quot;. Critic and writer Ian McKay wrote: &quot;In several important ways, &quot;Dear Christine&quot;, the exhibition, seeks with some noble intent to ... rescue Christine&#x27;s image and experience and reprocess it, rescuing it from the newspaper front-page-Keeler that is etched into the collective consciousness&quot;. The exhibition also featured in the &quot;Morning Star&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and the &quot;International Times&quot;.

In &quot;Wales Arts Review&quot;, writer Craig Austin interviewed Fionn Wilson who says:

The exhibition catalogue includes writing by Amanda Coe, screenwriter and executive producer of &quot;The Trial of Christine Keeler&quot;; Keeler&#x27;s son Seymour Platt; art historian Kalliopi Minioudaki; and artist and art critic Bo Gorzelak Pedersen.

In the summer of 1963, &quot;Christine&quot;, a pop single by Joyce Blair (released under the pseudonym &quot;Miss X&quot;), which parodied Keeler&#x27;s involvement with Profumo, reached No. 37 in the UK Singles Chart despite being banned from airplay by the BBC due to its subject matter. The single had also been banned by Radio Luxembourg.

In 1964, the Jamaican ska band The Skatalites released the song &quot;Christine Keeler&quot; on the album Ska Authentic.

In 1979, the British post-punk band Glaxo Babies released the 7-inch single &quot;Christine Keeler&quot; addressing Keeler and the Profumo affair.

Keeler is mentioned in the song &quot;Piano Lessons&quot; from the 1999 album &quot;Stupid Dream&quot; by Porcupine Tree. Her affair with Profumo is referenced obliquely as &quot;British politician sex&quot; in Billy Joel&#x27;s song &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Start the Fire&quot; from the 1989 album &quot;Storm Front&quot;. Keeler is referenced in the song &quot;Post World War Two Blues&quot; from the 1973 album &quot;Past, Present and Future&quot; by Al Stewart.

The &quot;Celebrities&#x27; Nightmares&quot; article in MAD#84 features President John F. Kennedy in terror of Keeler settling in Washington, DC, and attracted to Kennedy&#x27;s Cabinet. (The magazine, dated January 1964, hit news-stands just a week before Kennedy was assassinated.)

<doc id="163435" wikidata="Q3403950" url="?curid=163435" title="Mandy Rice-Davies">
<text>Marilyn Foreman (21 October 1944 – 18 December 2014), better known as Mandy Rice-Davies, was a Welsh model and showgirl best known for her association with Christine Keeler and her role in the Profumo affair, which discredited the Conservative government of British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in 1963.

==Early life==
Rice-Davies was born near Llanelli, Wales, and, during her childhood, moved to Solihull, Warwickshire. Her father was a policeman before becoming a technologist for Dunlop Rubber, and her mother was a former actress. She attended Sharmans Cross Secondary Modern School. As a teenager she worked at Woods Farm in Shirley assisting with the horse yard there. She appeared older than her age and at 15 she got a Saturday job as a clothes model at the Marshall &amp; Snelgrove department store in Birmingham. At 16 she went to London as Miss Austin at the Earls Court Motor Show.

==Profumo scandal==
At Murray&#x27;s Cabaret Club she met Christine Keeler, who introduced her to her friend, the well-connected osteopath Stephen Ward, and to an ex-lover, the slum landlord Peter Rachman. Rice-Davies became Rachman&#x27;s mistress and was set up in the house in which he had previously kept Keeler, 1 Bryanston Mews West, Marylebone. Rice-Davies often visited Keeler at the house she shared with Ward at Wimpole Mews, Marylebone, and, after Keeler had moved elsewhere, lived there herself, between September and December 1962. On 14 December 1962, while Keeler was visiting Rice-Davies at Wimpole Mews, one of Keeler&#x27;s boyfriends, John Edgecombe, attempted to enter and fired a gun several times at the door. His trial brought attention to the girls&#x27; involvement with Ward&#x27;s social set, and intimacy with many powerful people, including Viscount Astor at whose home of Cliveden Keeler met the War Minister John Profumo. Profumo&#x27;s brief relationship with Keeler was the centre of the affair that caused him to resign from the government in June 1963, though Rice-Davies herself never met him.
===&quot;Well he would, wouldn&#x27;t he?&quot;===

Stephen Ward was found guilty of living on the earnings of prostitution, from money obtained from Rice-Davies and Keeler among others, at a trial instigated after the embarrassment caused to the government.

While being cross-examined at Ward&#x27;s trial, when James Burge, the defence counsel, pointed out that Lord Astor denied an affair or even having met her, she dispatched this swiftly with pert humour, &quot;Well he would, wouldn&#x27;t he?&quot; Often misquoted in other contexts as: &quot;Well he would say that, wouldn&#x27;t he?&quot;, by 1979, this phrase had entered the third edition of the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Quotations&quot;, and is occasionally referred to with the abbreviation MRDA (&quot;Mandy Rice-Davies applies&quot;).

==Later life==
A &quot;Private Eye&quot; cover at the time of Profumo had a photograph of &quot;the lovely&quot; Rice-Davies with the caption (without any headline or other identification), &quot;Do you mind? If it wasn&#x27;t for me – you couldn&#x27;t have cared less about Rachman&quot;. Rice-Davies released a 45 EP on the Ember label (EMB EP 4537) in May 1964 entitled &quot;Introducing Mandy&quot;, which included cover versions of songs such as &quot;All I Do Is Dream of You&quot; and &quot;You Got What It Takes&quot;.

Rice-Davies traded on the notoriety the trial brought her, comparing herself to Nelson&#x27;s mistress, Lady Hamilton. In 1965 she was an associate of pre-fame David Bowie, attending his rehearsals and live performances. In 1966 she married an Israeli businessman, Rafi Shauli and moved to Israel. The couple had one daughter together and Rice-Davies converted to Judaism. She also opened nightclubs and restaurants in Tel Aviv. They were called Mandy&#x27;s, Mandy&#x27;s Candies and Mandy&#x27;s Singing Bamboo.
In 1980, with Shirley Flack, Rice-Davies wrote her autobiography, &quot;Mandy&quot;. A year later she appeared in the Tom Stoppard play, &quot;Dirty Linen and New-Found-Land&quot;. In 1989, she wrote a novel entitled &quot;The Scarlet Thread&quot;. The Ottoman Empire provided the backdrop and the novel was described as a stirring wartime saga in the spirit of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Subsequently, journalist Libby Purves, who had met Rice-Davies when &quot;Mandy&quot; was published, invited her to join a female re-creation on the River Thames of Jerome K. Jerome&#x27;s comic novel &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot;. This expedition was commissioned by Alan Coren for the magazine &quot;Punch&quot;, the other members of the party being cartoonist Merrily Harpur and a toy Alsatian to represent Montmorency, the dog in the original story. Purves recounted how she &quot;immediately spotted that this Rice-Davies was a woman to go up the Amazon with&quot; and, among other things, that &quot;only Mandy&#x27;s foxy charm saved us from being evicted from a lock for being drunk on pink Champagne.&quot;

Rice-Davies appeared in a number of television and film productions, including &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; and episode 6 of the first series of &quot;Chance in a Million&quot;. Her film career included roles in &quot;Nana, the True Key of Pleasure&quot; (1982), &quot;Black Venus&quot; (1983), and &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; (1986) as the mother of Colin whose father was played by Ray Davies from The Kinks. In the 1989 film &quot;Scandal&quot;, about the Profumo affair, Bridget Fonda portrayed Rice-Davies alongside Joanne Whalley as Keeler.

She was closely involved in the development of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s musical &quot;Stephen Ward&quot; about Ward&#x27;s involvement in the Profumo affair, in which she was portrayed by Charlotte Blackledge. The musical opened on 19 December 2013 at the Aldwych Theatre. On Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Midweek&quot; on 5 February 2014, Rice-Davies said of Stephen Ward, &quot;I didn&#x27;t fall for him, but I did have an affair with him.&quot; She once described her life as &quot;one slow descent into respectability&quot;.

==Illness and death==
Rice-Davies died from lung cancer, aged 70, on 18 December 2014 in London.

==In popular culture==
Rice-Davies is played by Bridget Fonda in &quot;Scandal&quot;, a 1989 film about the Profumo affair.

She is portrayed by Ellie Bamber in &quot;The Trial of Christine Keeler&quot;, a 2019–2020 six-part BBC One television series.

<doc id="163437" wikidata="Q1419980" url="?curid=163437" title="Sleuth (1972 film)">
<text>Sleuth is a 1972 mystery thriller film directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and starring Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. The screenplay by playwright Anthony Shaffer was based on his 1970 Tony Award-winning play. Both Olivier and Caine were nominated for Academy Awards for their performances. This was Mankiewicz&#x27;s final film. Critics gave the film overwhelmingly positive reviews.

==Plot==
Andrew Wyke, a crime fiction author, lives in a country manor house filled with elaborate games and automata. He invites his wife&#x27;s lover, Milo Tindle, the owner of two hair salons, to his home and says he would like Milo to take his wife, Marguerite, off his hands so he can be with his more desirable mistress, Téa. To provide Milo the means to support the high-maintenance Marguerite, Andrew suggests that Milo steal valuable jewellery from the house, with Andrew recouping his losses through an insurance claim. Milo agrees, and Andrew leads him through an elaborate scheme to fake a robbery. At the conclusion, Andrew pulls a gun on Milo and reveals that the bogus theft was a ruse to frame Milo as a burglar so he can kill him. Berating Milo&#x27;s profession as a hairdresser and background as the &quot;un-English&quot; son of an Italian immigrant, Andrew cannot accept that his wife left him for such an &quot;unworthy&quot; rival. He puts the gun to Milo&#x27;s head; there is a gunshot, and the screen cuts to black.

A few days later, Inspector Doppler arrives to investigate Milo&#x27;s disappearance. Andrew purports to know nothing, but as the inspector collates incriminating clues, Andrew breaks down and explains the burglary hoax. He insists that he only pretended to shoot Milo using a blank cartridge and that his rival left humiliated but unharmed. After finding evidence supporting a murder, Doppler arrests Andrew. As Andrew is about to be taken to the station, Doppler reveals himself as a disguised Milo, seeking revenge on Andrew.

The score is seemingly evened, though Andrew pretends he saw through Milo&#x27;s disguise while expressing admiration for Milo having been a worthy opponent. Milo expresses that Andrew has not experienced the level of humiliation of his own imminent death. He announces that they will play another game involving a real murder. Milo says he fatally strangled Andrew&#x27;s mistress, Téa, and has planted incriminating evidence throughout Andrew&#x27;s house and the police will arrive soon. Andrew phones Téa, only to learn from her flatmate, Joyce, that Téa is dead. Andrew frantically searches the house for the planted evidence. He finds the last item just as Milo says the police are arriving. Andrew pleads with Milo to stall them while he composes himself. Milo then reveals that he faked Téa&#x27;s death with Joyce and Téa&#x27;s assistance as payback for the games of humiliation Andrew has inflicted on Téa. Andrew is further humiliated when Milo reveals that Téa informed him that Andrew is practically impotent and has not had relations with her in over a year.

As Milo prepares to leave, he continues humiliating Andrew. Andrew threatens to shoot him to stop him from bragging about his humiliation to anyone else. However, Milo says he really did report Andrew&#x27;s burglary setup and assault to the police, who now would not believe Andrew&#x27;s concocted story of mistakenly killing a burglar. Pushed too far, Andrew disbelieves Milo and shoots and mortally wounds him. The police arrive outside, and Andrew locks himself inside the house. As Milo lies dying, he tells Andrew to tell the police that &quot;it was just a bloody game&quot;; he then presses the automata control box, leaving Andrew surrounded by his activated electronic toys as police pound on the door.

==Cast==

* Laurence Olivier as Andrew Wyke
* Michael Caine as Milo Tindle

The production team intended to reveal as little about the movie as possible so as to make the conclusion a complete surprise to the audience. For this reason, the opening credits list fictional people playing roles that do not exist. They are Alec Cawthorne as Inspector Doppler, John Matthews as Detective Sergeant Tarrant, Eve Channing (named after the characters Eve Harrington and Margo Channing from Mankiewicz&#x27;s 1950 film &quot;All About Eve&quot;) as Marguerite Wyke, and Teddy Martin as Police Constable Higgs. Vincent Canby&#x27;s review for &quot;The New York Times&quot; also listed fictitious actress Karen Minfort-Jones as playing Andrew&#x27;s mistress Teya.

==Production==


Shaffer was initially reluctant to sell the film rights to the play, fearful it would undercut the success of the stage version. When he finally did relent, he hoped the film would retain the services of Anthony Quayle, who had essayed the role of Wyke in London and on Broadway. Alan Bates was Shaffer&#x27;s pick for the part of Milo Tindle. In the end, director Mankiewicz opted for Olivier and Caine.

When they met, Caine asked Olivier how he should address him. Olivier told him that it should be as &quot;Lord Olivier&quot;, and added that now that that was settled he could call him &quot;Larry&quot;. According to Shaffer, Olivier stated that when filming began he looked upon Caine as an assistant, but that by the end of filming he regarded him as a full partner. According to Stephen Sondheim (who Shaffer had partly taken for inspiration for the original play when it came to his penchant for playing games), when he met Olivier sometime after the production had finished shooting, Olivier had said he based his performance on Sondheim.

The likeness of actress Joanne Woodward was used for the painting of Marguerite Wyke.

Much of the story revolves around the theme of crime fiction, as written by John Dickson Carr (St John Lord Merridew = Sir Henry Merrivale), on whom Olivier&#x27;s physical appearance is modelled, and Agatha Christie, whose photo is included on Wyke&#x27;s wall, and how it relates to real-life criminal investigations. Class conflict is also raised between Wyke, who has the trappings of an English country gentleman, compared to Tindle, the son of an immigrant from a poor area of London.

Bristol Myers Squibb (Palomar Pictures International) owns the rights to &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot; (1972) and &quot;Sleuth&quot; (1972).&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/2001/video-programming&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
&quot;Sleuth&quot; opened at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on December 10, 1972 and at the Bruin Theatre in Los Angeles on December 13, 1972. After 8 days of release, it had grossed $70,781 from the 2 theatres. After the film was released in South Africa Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine performed in a stage version of Sleuth at a theatre in Johannesburg.

==Reception and legacy==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 89% based on reviews from 28 critics.

The film was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier), Best Director and Best Music, Original Dramatic Score. Olivier won the New York Film Critics award for Best Actor as a compromise selection after the voters became deadlocked in a choice between Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in &quot;The Godfather&quot; after Stacy Keach in &quot;Fat City&quot; won a plurality in initial voting and rules were changed requiring a majority. Shaffer received an Edgar Award for his screenplay.

The film was the second to have practically its entire cast (Caine and Olivier) nominated for Academy Awards after &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; in 1966 and the first where exactly all of the actors in the film were nominated. (&quot;Virginia Woolf&quot; featured uncredited bit parts by actors playing the roadhouse manager and waitress.) This feat has been repeated only by &quot;Give &#x27;em Hell, Harry!&quot; (1975), in which James Whitmore is the sole credited actor.

Critics Roger Ebert, Janet Maslin, Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and several film historians have all noted similarities between &quot;Sleuth&quot; and Caine&#x27;s 1982 film &quot;Deathtrap&quot;. &quot;SCTV&quot; episode 121 featured Dave Thomas playing Michael Caine, arguing that the two films were different because the library appeared on different sides of the set.

===Accolades===
==Deleted footage==
While questioning Wyke, Doppler points out that the clown costume that Tindle was wearing when he was shot is missing, though the clown&#x27;s mask is later found and put on the head of the plastic skeleton in the cellar. He is probably implying that Tindle was buried with it.

In the trailer for the film, there are the scenes with Doppler laying out the evidence against Wyke as shown in the movie. They include him pulling open the shower curtains in one of the bathrooms and exposing the clown&#x27;s jacket, dripping wet and apparently with bloodstains on it. This scene was not included in the final film.

==Preservation==
The Academy Film Archive preserved &quot;Sleuth&quot; in 2012.

==2007 film==

In September 2006 Kenneth Branagh announced at the Venice Film Festival his new film of the play, with the screenplay by Nobel laureate Harold Pinter. Caine starred in this adaptation, this time in the role of Wyke, and Jude Law played Tindle as a struggling actor. Production was completed in March 2007 and the film was released in the UK on 23 November 2007. The remake did not use any of the dialogue in Shaffer&#x27;s original script and was considered unsuccessful in comparison with the original.

<text>Ronin is a 1998 American action thriller film directed by John Frankenheimer and written by John David Zeik and David Mamet, under the pseudonym Richard Weisz. It stars an ensemble cast consisting of Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Natascha McElhone, Stellan Skarsgård, Sean Bean, and Jonathan Pryce. The film is about a team of former special operatives hired to steal a mysterious, heavily guarded briefcase while navigating a maze of shifting loyalties. The film was praised for its realistic car chases in Nice and Paris.

Frankenheimer signed to direct Zeik&#x27;s screenplay, which Mamet rewrote to expand De Niro&#x27;s role and develop plot details, in 1997. The film was photographed by Robert Fraisse in his native France from November 3, 1997, to March 3, 1998. Professional racing car drivers coordinated and performed the vehicle stunts, and Elia Cmiral scored the film, his first for a major studio.

&quot;Ronin&quot; premiered at the 1998 Venice Film Festival before its general release on September 25. Critics were generally positive about the film&#x27;s action, casting, and technical aspects, while the plot attracted criticism. The film underperformed at the box office, grossing $70.7 million on a $55 million budget. &quot;Ronin&quot;, Frankenheimer&#x27;s last well-received feature film, was considered to be a return to form for the director. Film critic and historian Stephen Prince called the film Frankenheimer&#x27;s &quot;end-of-career masterpiece&quot;. The car chases, which were favorably compared with those in &quot;Bullitt&quot; and &quot;The French Connection&quot;, were included on several media outlets&#x27; lists as among the best depicted on film.

== Plot ==
At a bistro in Montmartre, IRA operative Deirdre meets with two Americans, Sam and Larry, and a Frenchman, Vincent. She takes them to a warehouse where the Englishman Spence and the German Gregor are waiting. Conversations between the men show that they are all ex-government agents or ex-military-turned-mercenary. Deirdre briefs the group on their mission: to attack a heavily armed convoy and steal a large, metallic briefcase. Its contents are never revealed. The team&#x27;s first task before the main mission is to acquire weapons; this turns into a setup. Although the team survives and they get the weapons, Spence is exposed as a fraud by Sam. He is dismissed by Deirdre and the others continue the mission. As the team prepares, Deirdre meets with her handler, Seamus O&#x27;Rourke, who tells her that the Russian mafia is bidding for the case and that the team must intervene so that they don&#x27;t get it. During a stakeout, Sam and Deirdre act on their mutual attraction.

Deirdre&#x27;s team successfully ambushes the convoy at La Turbie and pursues the survivors to Nice. During the gunfight, Gregor steals the case and disappears. He negotiates selling it to the Russians, but his contact attempts to betray him. Gregor kills the contact, then has Mikhi — the Russian Mafioso in charge of the deal — agree to another meeting. The team tracks Gregor through one of Sam&#x27;s old CIA contacts and corners him in the Arles Amphitheatre during his meeting with two of Mikhi&#x27;s men. Sam chases Gregor; Gregor flees but is caught by Seamus. Deirdre and Vincent confront the two Russian hoods, causing a shootout. Sam arrives to help, killing one, but catches a ricochet from the other when Vincent knocks away the henchman&#x27;s gun in order to kill him. Seamus kills Larry and escapes with a reluctant Deirdre and the captured Gregor. Vincent takes Sam to a villa owned by his friend, Jean-Pierre. After removing the bullet and letting Sam recuperate, Jean-Pierre compares Sam&#x27;s situation to the tale of the 47 Ronin. Vincent asks Jean-Pierre to help them find Gregor and the Irish operatives.

In Paris, Gregor is persuaded through violent interrogation to give the case back to Seamus and Deirdre. After retrieving it from a post office, they are pursued by Sam and Vincent in a high-speed chase. Vincent shoots out their tire, sending their car off an overpass which is under construction. Gregor escapes with the case while road workers rescue Deirdre and Seamus from the burning vehicle. Doubtful of where to go next, Sam and Vincent decide to track down the Russians after discovering that the decoy case Gregor used in his theft of the original is used for carrying ice skates; one of Jean-Pierre&#x27;s contacts informs them that the Russians are involved with figure-skater (and Mikhi&#x27;s girlfriend) Natacha Kirilova, who is appearing at Le Zénith.

During Natacha&#x27;s performance, Mikhi meets with Gregor, who says a sniper in the arena will shoot Natacha if Mikhi betrays him. Mikhi surprises Gregor by letting Natacha be killed by the sniper after Mikhi kills Gregor and takes the case. Amid the ensuing chaos from Natacha&#x27;s shooting, Sam and Vincent leave the arena just in time to see Seamus kill Mikhi and steal the case. Sam and Vincent split up; Vincent pursues Seamus, but is wounded in a gunfight. Sam finds Deirdre waiting in a getaway car; he convinces her to leave after explaining that he is after Seamus, not the case. As she drives away, Seamus is forced to return to the arena as Sam gives chase. Seamus ambushes Sam, but is shot dead by Vincent before Seamus can kill Sam.

Sam and Vincent have coffee in the bistro where they first met. A radio broadcast announces that a peace agreement between Sinn Féin and the British government has been reached, partially as a result of Seamus&#x27;s death. Sam keeps glancing at the door as patrons enter, but Vincent convinces Sam that Deirdre will not be coming back. They shake hands and part ways, but not before Vincent asks what was in the case. Sam replies that he doesn&#x27;t remember. Sam drives off with his CIA contact as Vincent pays the bill and leaves.

== Cast ==


In addition, Féodor Atkine plays Mikhi, the Russian who is buying the case, while East German Olympic and World Champion figure skater Katarina Witt has an extended cameo as Natacha Kirilova, a Russian Olympic and World Champion figure skater.

== Production ==
In July 1997, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Frankenheimer had signed to direct &quot;Ronin&quot;, making it his fifth picture for United Artists. Frankenheimer told the magazine he chose the project because it had a &quot;very good script&quot; and was &quot;the kind of movie I&#x27;d love to go see ... What I like is, it&#x27;s a character-driven action picture, and I have done those before, with &quot;Black Sunday&quot; and &quot;French Connection II&quot;. It&#x27;s not one of these CGI pictures, it&#x27;s a film about people. It&#x27;s not bigger than life, which I don&#x27;t relate to that much.&quot; He also saw it as an opportunity to apply his broad knowledge and understanding of France, especially Paris, in which he resided for many years. He added, &quot;I would not have been able to do the film nearly as well anywhere else&quot;. His films &quot;The Train&quot; (1964), &quot;Grand Prix&quot; (1966), &quot;Impossible Object&quot; (1973), and &quot;French Connection II&quot; (1975) were shot in France.

Many of &quot;Ronin&quot;″s principal crew members had worked with Frankenheimer on television films; editor Tony Gibbs on &quot;George Wallace&quot;, set designer Michael Z. Hanan on &quot;George Wallace&quot; and &quot;The Burning Season&quot; (1994), and costume designer May Routh on &quot;Andersonville&quot; (1996). Frankenheimer chose French cinematographer Robert Fraisse to help him achieve the look and style he wanted for the film. Fraisse impressed Frankenheimer with his work on the police thriller &quot;Citizen X&quot; (1995), which persuaded the director Fraisse could handle the more-than-2,000 setups he planned for &quot;Ronin&quot;. Frank Mancuso Jr. served as the film&#x27;s producer.

According to Frankenheimer, French authorities helped him circumvent a strict Paris ordinance that prohibited film productions from firing guns in the city. This was enacted because many civilians had been complaining about the gunfire noise produced by film shoots. Additional factors influenced the decision; officials&#x27; desire for an American action film like &quot;Ronin&quot;, few of which had been filmed there since the law was passed, to be filmed in Paris and the desire to boost France&#x27;s reputation as a filming location.

=== Screenplay ===
Writer John David Zeik, a newcomer to film, conceived the idea for &quot;Ronin&quot; after reading James Clavell&#x27;s novel &quot;Shōgun&quot; at the age of 15. It gave him background information on &quot;rōnin&quot; (masterless samurai), which he incorporated into a screenplay years later. On choosing France as the story&#x27;s key location, Zeik said: &quot;Many years later in Nice, the location of one of the key set pieces of the story, I stared into the sun and saw the silhouettes of five heavily armed Gendarmes crossing the Promenade des Anglais. That image made me realize that I wanted to set the film in France.&quot;

Accounts differ as to the screenplay&#x27;s authorship. According to Zeik&#x27;s attorney, Playwright David Mamet was brought in shortly before production to expand De Niro&#x27;s role and add a female love interest. Although Mamet rewrote several scenes, his contributions were minor according to Zeik&#x27;s account. Frankenheimer said Mamet&#x27;s contributions were more significant: &quot;The credits should read: &#x27;Story by J.D. Zeik, screenplay by David Mamet&#x27;. We didn&#x27;t shoot a line of Zeik&#x27;s script.&quot; Frankenheimer later retracted this in a September 1998 open letter published in &quot;Variety&quot;, writing that &quot;J.D. Zeik is unequivocally entitled to the first position screenwriting credit as well as the sole story credit he was awarded by the WGA ... [He] deserves recognition for his significant contribution to this film, and I am proud to have worked with him&quot;. When he learned he would have to share credit with Zeik, Mamet insisted on being credited with the pseudonym Richard Weisz because he had earlier decided to attach his name only to projects for which he was the sole writer.

=== Filming and cinematography ===
&quot;Ronin&quot; was produced on a budget of $55 million. Principal photography lasted 78 days, beginning on November 3, 1997, in an abandoned workshop at Aubervilliers. Scenes at Porte des Lilas and the historic Arles Amphitheatre were filmed that November; the crew then filmed at the Hotel Majestic in Cannes, La Turbie, and Villefranche. Production was suspended for Christmas on December 19 and resumed on January 5, 1998, at Épinay, where the crew built two interior sets on sound stages; one for the bistro in Montmartre and another for the rural farmhouse, both of which also have exterior location shots. The climactic scene with a panicked crowd at Le Zénith required about 2,000 extras, who were supervised by French casting director Margot Capelier. Filming concluded at La Défense on March 3, 1998.

Because there were no second unit director and camera operator to film the action scenes, Frankenheimer and cinematographer Robert Fraisse supervised them for an additional 30 days after the main unit finished filming. The first major car-chase scene was shot in La Turbie and Nice; the rest were filmed in areas of Paris including La Défense and the Pont du Garigliano. Scenes set in a road tunnel were filmed at night because it was impossible to block tunnel traffic during the day. The freeway chase, in which the actors dodge oncoming vehicles, was filmed in four hours on a closed road.

Frankenheimer&#x27;s affinity for deep depth of field led him to shoot the film entirely with wide-angle lenses ranging in focal length from 18 to 35 mm using the Super 35 format, both of which allow more of the scene to be included in each shot as well as the freedom to reframe the movie for Full Screen presentation. The director also avoided bright primary colors to preserve a first-generation-of-film quality. He advised the actors and extras not to wear bright colors and had the film processed with Deluxe&#x27;s Color Contrast Enhancement (CCE), &quot;a silver-retention method of processing film that deepens blacks, reduces color, and heightens the visible appearance of film grain&quot;. Fraisse said he used a variety of cameras, including Panaflexes for dialogue scenes and Arriflex 435s and 35-IIIs for the car chases, to facilitate Frankenheimer&#x27;s demands. Steadicam, a camera stabilizer used for half of the shoot, was operated by the director&#x27;s longtime collaborator David Crone. According to Frankenheimer, 2,200 shots were filmed.

=== Stunts ===
Frankenheimer avoided using special effects in the car-chase scenes, previsualizing them with storyboards and used the same camera mounts as those used on &quot;Grand Prix&quot;. The actors were placed inside the cars while being driven at up to , by Formula One driver Jean-Pierre Jarier, and high-performance drivers Jean-Claude Lagniez and Michel Neugarten. The actors had enrolled at a high-performance driving school before production began. According to Lagniez, the car-stunt coordinator, it was a priority not to cheat the speed by adjusting the frame rate; he said, &quot;When you do, it affects the lighting. It is different at 20 frames than at 24 frames.&quot; However, Fraisse said: &quot;Sometimes, but not very often, we did shoot at 22 frames per second, or 21.&quot; Point-of-view shots from cameras mounted below the cars&#x27; front fender were used to deliver a heightened sense of speed.

For the final chase scene, which used 300 stunt drivers, the production team bought four BMW 535is and five Peugeot 406s; one of each was cut in half and towed by a Mercedes-Benz 500 E while the actors were inside them. Right-hand drive versions of the cars were also purchased; a dummy steering wheel was installed on the left side while the stunt drivers drove the speeding vehicles. The final chase had very little music because Frankenheimer thought music and sound effects do not blend well. Sound engineer Mike Le Mare recorded all of the film&#x27;s cars on a racetrack, mixing them later in post-production.

Frankenheimer refused to film the gunfights in slow motion, believing onscreen violence should be depicted in real time. Mick Gould, the film&#x27;s technical advisor and a former instructor in the advanced training wings of the Special Air Service, trained the cast in weapons-handling and guerilla military tactics. The physical stunts were coordinated by Joe Dunne.

=== Alternative endings ===
Frankenheimer filmed two additional versions of the film&#x27;s ending. In the first, Deirdre (McElhone) waits on the stairs next to the bistro and considers joining Sam (De Niro) and Vincent (Reno). Deciding against it, she walks up the stairs. As she gets into her car, IRA men drag her into a van and call her a traitor; it is implied that she is later killed. Sam and Vincent, unaware of Deidre&#x27;s abduction, finish their conversation and depart. Although Frankenheimer said the test audience &quot;hated&quot; the ending because they did not want to see Deirdre die, he thought it &quot;really worked&quot;. In the second ending, Deirdre walks to her car after Sam and Vincent leave the bistro; this ending was also rejected because it verged on being &quot;too Hollywood&quot;, hinting at a sequel. Frankenheimer yielded to the test audience&#x27;s response with a compromise ending; he said, &quot;with the tremendous investment MGM/UA had in this movie, you have to kind of listen to the audience&quot;.

=== Music ===
Jerry Goldsmith was originally commissioned to compose the score for &quot;Ronin&quot; but left the project. MGM executive vice-president for music Michael Sandoval assembled an A-list to replace Goldsmith. From Sandoval&#x27;s three choices, Frankenheimer hired Czech composer Elia Cmíral, who said he &quot;was far away from being even a &#x27;B&#x27; composer at that time&quot;. Cmíral attended a private screening of the film&#x27;s final version and considered its main theme, which at Frankenheimer&#x27;s behest would incorporate qualities of &quot;sadness, loneliness, and heroism&quot;. To achieve this, Cmíral performed with the duduk, an ancient, double-reed woodwind flute that originated in Armenia. Cmíral sent a demonstration to Frankenheimer, who &quot;loved&quot; it, and was signed as the film&#x27;s composer. Cmíral&#x27;s piece &quot;Ronin Theme&quot; was used for the opening scenes.

Cmíral&#x27;s score for &quot;Ronin&quot;, his first for a major film studio, was recorded in seven weeks at CTS Studio in London. It was orchestrated and conducted by Nick Ingman, edited by Mike Flicker, and recorded and mixed by John Whynot. Varèse Sarabande released the soundtrack album on compact disc in September 1998. For AllMusic, Jason Ankeny rated the album 4.5 out of 5 and called it a &quot;profoundly visceral listening experience, illustrating an expert grasp of pacing and atmosphere&quot;.

&quot;Ronin&quot; had its world premiere at the 1998 Venice Film Festival on September 12, before a wide release on September 25. &quot;Ronin&quot; fared moderately well at the box office; it was the second-highest-grossing film in the United States during its opening weekend, grossing $16.7 million behind the action-comedy &quot;Rush Hour&quot;″s $26.7 million, at 2,643 locations. The film dropped to fifth place on its second weekend and to seventh on its third, grossing $7.2 million and $4.7 million, respectively, at 2,487 locations. It dropped further until its sixth weekend, when it grossed $1.1 million (13th place) at 1,341 locations. The film ended its theatrical run with a gross of $41.6 million in the U.S. and Canada, and $70.7 million worldwide. &quot;Ronin&quot; was 1998&#x27;s 11th-highest-grossing R-rated film.

=== Critical response ===
Critical reception to &quot;Ronin&quot; was favorable; critics praised its ensemble cast, with many singling out Robert De Niro. Todd McCarthy in &quot;Variety&quot; credited De Niro with sustaining the film but a reviewer from the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; disagreed. The film&#x27;s action scenes, particularly the car chases, were generally praised; Janet Maslin in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called them &quot;nothing short of sensational&quot;. These scenes were criticized by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; for their length and by McCarthy for their excessive jump cuts. Robert Fraisse&#x27;s cinematography was routinely praised; Michael Wilmington in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called it superficially attractive and entertaining. Although the plot was criticized by the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; as dull and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as derivative, Wilmington called it a &quot;familiar but taut tale&quot;. Some reviewers singled out the espionage scene in which De Niro and Natascha McElhone pose as tourists and photograph their targets at a Cannes hotel as one of the film&#x27;s best.

Critics also evaluated Frankenheimer because the broad acclaim he received with the political thriller &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (1962) established him as a director. Many said he was influenced by the works of fellow filmmaker and close friend Jean-Pierre Melville, particularly Melville&#x27;s neo-noir film &quot;Le Samouraï&quot; (1967), but McCarthy wrote that &quot;Ronin&quot; lacks Melville&#x27;s &quot;world-weary, existential ennui&quot;. The film was considered to be a return to form for Frankenheimer, whose Emmy Awards for the television films &quot;Against the Wall&quot; (1994), &quot;The Burning Season&quot;, &quot;Andersonville&quot; and &quot;George Wallace&quot; had resurrected his career, after it lost momentum during the 1970s and 1980s due to the director&#x27;s alcohol addiction. &quot;Ronin&quot; was Frankenheimer&#x27;s last well-received feature film; Wilmington called it the director&#x27;s best theatrical film in decades despite lacking &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; &quot;blazing invention&quot;, and Stephen Prince called the film his &quot;end-of-career masterpiece&quot;. Prince wrote:

With &quot;Ronin&quot;, Frankenheimer vindicated his cinematic talents and aesthetic preferences. The film is stylistically bonded with the principles of his work as found in the earliest and best period of his career. Its aesthetic of realism places it with &quot;Grand Prix&quot;, &quot;The Train&quot;, and &quot;The Gypsy Moths&quot;, and its minimalist conception of character and narrative detail bonds it to those productions as well. Frankenheimer had not lost his touch as a filmmaker, far from it. &quot;Ronin&quot; is smart, sharp, and witty, and it shows a greater facility for visual storytelling than most films made today, by younger directors, can muster.

== Post-release ==
=== Home media ===
In February 1999, MGM Home Entertainment released &quot;Ronin&quot; as a double-sided DVD that contained versions in widescreen and full screen formats, and Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. The DVD also contains the alternative ending and an audio commentary by John Frankenheimer, who discusses the film&#x27;s production history. MGM released a special edition DVD of the film in October 2004 and a two-disc collector&#x27;s edition in May 2006, both of which have additional cast and crew interviews.

It was released on Blu-ray with its theatrical trailer in February 2009. In August 2017, Arrow Video released a special edition Blu-ray with a 4K resolution restoration from the original camera negative that was supervised and approved by cinematographer Robert Fraisse. Arrow&#x27;s Blu-ray also includes archival bonus features that originally appeared on the MGM special edition DVD, together with Fraisse talking about his early cinematography career and his involvement with &quot;Ronin&quot;.

=== Cinematic analysis ===
The film&#x27;s title was derived from the Japanese legend of &quot;rōnin&quot;, samurai whose was killed and left them with no one to serve, and roamed the countryside as mercenaries and bandits to regain a sense of purpose. In Frankenheimer&#x27;s film, the &quot;rōnin&quot; are former intelligence operatives who are unemployed at the end of the Cold War; devoid of purpose, they become highly-paid mercenaries. Michael Lonsdale&#x27;s character elaborates on the analogy in an anecdote about the forty-seven &quot;rōnin&quot; told with miniatures, comparing the film&#x27;s characters to the 18th-century &quot;rōnin&quot; of Japan. In his essay, &quot;Action and Abstraction in &quot;Ronin&quot;&quot;, Stephen Prince wrote that the &quot;rōnin&quot; metaphor explores themes of &quot;service, honor, and obligation to complex ways by showing that service may entail betrayal and that honor may be measured according to disparate terms&quot;. According to Stephen B. Armstrong, &quot;Arguably Frankenheimer uses this story to highlight and contrast the moral and social weakness that characterize the band of &quot;rōnin&quot; in his film&quot;.

The film features a MacGuffin plot device in the form of a briefcase, the contents of which are important but unknown. &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Roger Ebert wrote that its content is identical to that of the equally-mysterious case in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994), also a MacGuffin. Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called &quot;Ronin&quot; an homage to &quot;The French Connection&quot; (1971), &quot;The Parallax View&quot; (1974), and &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; (1975); thriller films known for their lack of visual effects. Maitland McDonagh of &quot;TV Guide&quot; also compared the film to &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; (1973) and noted similarities between &quot;Ronin&quot;″s opening scene and that of Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; (1992), in which a group of professional killers who have not met before assemble. According to Armstrong, the film&#x27;s plot observes the conventions of heist films.

Frankenheimer employed a hyperrealistic aesthetic in his films &quot;to make them look realer than real, because reality by itself can be very boring&quot;, and saw them as having a tinge of semi-documentary. He credited Gillo Pontecorvo&#x27;s &quot;The Battle of Algiers&quot; (1966), a film he considered flawless and more influential than any other he had seen, with inspiring this style. According to Prince, &quot;Frankenheimer&#x27;s success at working in this realist style, avoiding special effects trickery, places the car chase in &quot;Ronin&quot; in the same rarefied class as the celebrated chase in &quot;Bullitt&quot; (1968)&quot;. The director credited the Russian film &quot;The Cranes Are Flying&quot; (1957) with inspiring invisible cuts in &quot;Ronin&quot;. On the film&#x27;s DVD audio commentary, Frankenheimer notes a wipe during the opening scenes made by two extras walking across the frame, which becomes a tracking shot of Jean Reno entering the bistro. His intention for the cut was to conceal the fact that the bistro&#x27;s interior was a set; its exterior was filmed on location.

<text>The Ruling Class is a 1972 British black comedy film. It is an adaptation of Peter Barnes&#x27; satirical 1968 stage play &quot;The Ruling Class,&quot; which tells the story of a paranoid schizophrenic British nobleman (played by Peter O&#x27;Toole) who inherits a peerage. The film co-stars Alastair Sim, William Mervyn, Coral Browne, Harry Andrews, Carolyn Seymour, James Villiers and Arthur Lowe. It was produced by Jules Buck and directed by Peter Medak.

The film has been described as a &quot;commercial failure ... [that] has since become a cult classic&quot;; Peter O&#x27;Toole described it as &quot;a comedy with tragic relief&quot;.

==Plot==
Following the death from accidental asphyxiation of Ralph Gurney, 13th Earl of Gurney, Jack Gurney becomes the 14th Earl of Gurney. Jack, a paranoid schizophrenic, thinks he is Jesus Christ and shocks his family and friends with his talk of returning to the world to bring it love and charity, not to mention his penchant for breaking out into song and dance routines and sleeping upright on a cross. When faced with unpalatable facts (such as his identity as the 14th Earl), Jack puts them in his &quot;galvanized pressure cooker&quot; and they disappear. His unscrupulous uncle, Sir Charles, marries him to his mistress, Grace, in hopes of producing an heir and putting his nephew in an institution; the plan fails, however, when Grace falls in love with Jack. Jack gains another ally in Sir Charles&#x27; wife, Lady Claire, who hates her husband and befriends Jack just to spite him. She also begins sleeping with Jack&#x27;s psychiatrist, Dr. Herder, to persuade him to cure Jack quickly.

Herder attempts to cure him through intensive psychotherapy, to no avail; Jack so thoroughly believes that he is the &quot;God of Love&quot; that he dismisses any suggestion to the contrary as insane. The night his wife goes into labour, Herder makes a last effort at curing Jack; he introduces Jack to McKyle, a patient who also believes himself to be Christ – or as the patient puts it, &quot;The High Voltage Messiah&quot; – who subjects an unwitting Jack to electroshock therapy. The plan works, and as Grace is delivered of a healthy baby boy, Jack proclaims &quot;I&#x27;m Jack, I&#x27;m Jack&quot;. His family takes this to mean that he has returned to his senses, but in reality he now believes himself to be Jack the Ripper.

Sir Charles sends for a court-appointed psychiatrist to evaluate Jack, confident that his nephew will be sent to an asylum for life. He is once again thwarted when the psychiatrist discovers that Jack was a fellow Old Etonian, bonds with him and declares him sane.

Jack murders Lady Claire in a fit of rage when the ageing woman tries to seduce him. He frames the Communist family butler, Tucker, for the murder. Sir Charles suffers a debilitating stroke shortly afterward, and Dr. Herder has a nervous breakdown upon realizing what Jack has done. Jack assumes his place in the House of Lords with a fiery speech in favour of capital and corporal punishment. His colleagues applaud wildly, completely unaware the speech is the ranting of a lunatic. When seen through his eyes, his colleagues – singing &quot;Onward, Christian Soldiers&quot; – appear to be rotting corpses. Their enthusiasm contrasts with the unfavourable reaction when Jack believed he was Christ. That night, he murders Grace for expressing her love for him. Her terrified scream is matched by the sound of a baby cooing &quot;I&#x27;m Jack, I&#x27;m Jack&quot;, suggesting that their son – the heir presumptive – has inherited Jack&#x27;s madness.

==Production==
O&#x27;Toole held the rights to Barnes&#x27;s play; Peter Medak approached O&#x27;Toole repeatedly about exercising those rights. According to Medak, the project got started one night that he and O&#x27;Toole were returning from the theatre, which &quot;meant stopping at every pub between Soho and Hampstead, and it didn&#x27;t matter if it was after closing hour because he would knock on the door and just say &#x27;Peter&#x27;s here,&#x27; and every door opened for him&quot;. Later on, at O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s apartment, the deeply inebriated actor phoned his manager and said, &quot;I&#x27;m with the crazy Hungarian and I know I&#x27;m drunk but I give you 24 hours to set this movie up.&quot; The next day, Medak received a call from United Artists and a deal was put together to shoot &quot;The Ruling Class&quot;.

Peter Barnes adapted the screenplay from his 1968 original, with few major changes. Filmed at the sprawling estate of Harlaxton Manor, with the interiors reconstructed on sound stages, the production cost $1.4 million, with O&#x27;Toole working for free (he was instead paid a great deal for the big-budget &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;, released by the same studio later the same year).

&quot;The Ruling Class&quot; was the official British entry at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival.

==Reception==
The film divided critics. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;fantastic fun&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;brilliantly caustic&quot;, but the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;snail-slow, shrill and gesticulating&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; said it was a &quot;sledgehammer satire&quot;.
Jay Cocks called the screenplay a &quot;snarling, overwrought and somewhat parochial satire on aristocracy and privileged morality&quot;; he called the film &quot;wretchedly photographed...as if it were shot under floodlights&quot;. In contrast Cocks praised the performances by Lowe, Mervyn, Browne, Alastair Sim and James Villiers, but reserved most of his praise for O&#x27;Toole, saying his performance is of &quot;such intensity that it may trouble sleep as surely as it will haunt memory. All actors can play insanity; few play it well. O&#x27;Toole begins where other actors stop, with the unfocused gaze, the abrupt bursts of frenzied high spirits and precipitous depressions. Funny, disturbing, finally devastating, O&#x27;Toole finds his way into the workings of madness, revealing the anger and consuming anguish at the source.&quot; John Simon described The Ruling Class as a &quot;delightful satire&quot;.

Despite mixed critical reaction to the film, O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s performance was universally praised and garnered numerous prestigious awards and prizes, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Reportedly, when United Artists, its North American distributor, told producer Jules Buck that it would be cutting the film extensively for US release, Buck punched the company&#x27;s London representative and bought the film back. Avco Embassy then bought the distribution rights and cut the film&#x27;s 154-minute running time by six minutes.

The film was banned by the South African Publications Control Board.

In a review nearly 30 years after &quot;The Ruling Class&quot; was first released, Ian Christie said the film is &quot;unashamedly theatrical, and it emerges from a particularly interesting period in English culture when theatre and cinema together were mining a rich vein of flamboyant self-analysis. Many stage works of this period cry out for filmic extension—in fact, Medak had just filmed a very different play that mingled fantasy and reality by a writer often bracketed with Barnes, Peter Nichols’ &quot;A Day in the Death of Joe Egg&quot;. But what makes &quot;The Ruling Class&quot; exceptional (and difficult for some) are its outrageous mixing of genres and its sheer ambition. Not only are there allusions to Shakespeare and Marlowe, but also to Wilde and Whitehall farce; to the gentility of Ealing Studios, with a plot that distantly evokes that other great black comedy &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot;, and to Hammer&#x27;s gore-fests.&quot;

== Awards and nominations ==
*1972 National Board of Review of Motion Pictures - Won NBR Award (Best Actor) - Peter O&#x27;Toole
*1972 Cannes Film Festival - Nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or
*1973 Academy Awards - Nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor - Peter O&#x27;Toole
*1973 Golden Globe Awards - Nominated for the Golden Globe for Best English Language Foreign Film

==Subsequent history==
In 1974, following an earlier-than-normal TV screening of the film on BBC Television that broke a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement allowing a &#x27;window&#x27; of theatrical distribution before any TV screening, the UK&#x27;s Cinematograph Exhibitors&#x27; Association (the theatrical distributors&#x27; association) recommended its members blacklist all future movies produced by Jules Buck.

Embassy Pictures re-released the film in May 1983.

<doc id="163444" wikidata="Q204936" url="?curid=163444" title="Kate Greenaway">
<text>Catherine Greenaway (17 March 18466 November 1901) was an English Victorian artist and writer, known for her 
children&#x27;s book illustrations. She received her education in graphic design and art between 1858 and 1871 from the Finsbury School of Art, the South Kensington School of Art, the Heatherley School of Art, and the Slade School of Fine Art. She began her career designing for the burgeoning greetings card market, producing Christmas and Valentine&#x27;s cards. In 1879 wood-block engraver and printer Edmund Evans printed &quot;Under the Window&quot;, an instant best-seller, which established her reputation. Her collaboration with Evans continued throughout the 1880s and 1890s.

The depictions of children in imaginary 18th-century costumes in a Queen Anne style were extremely popular in England and internationally, sparking the Kate Greenaway style. Within a few years of the publication of &quot;Under the Window&quot; Greenaway&#x27;s work was imitated in England, Germany, and the United States.

==Childhood==
Kate Greenaway was born in Hoxton, London, the second of four children, to a working-class family. Her mother, Elizabeth, was a dress maker and her father, John, an engraver who gave up steady employment with Ebenezer Landells&#x27; engraving firm to strike out on his own. When Greenaway was very young, he accepted a commission to provide the engraved illustrations to a new edition of Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;, sending his young family away to relatives in the countryside to give himself solitude while producing the engravings. Kate&#x27;s earliest memories are of Rolleston, Nottinghamshire, which affected her deeply. It was a place she returned to frequently in her childhood. According to children&#x27;s literature scholar Humphrey Carpenter, the period was to Greenaway &quot;crucial ... she felt it to be her real home, a country of the mind that she could always reimagine&quot;. After returning to grimy London streets Rolleston became a place to visit in her mind and constantly embellish.

The publisher who commissioned John Greenaway&#x27;s work went bankrupt, leaving the family without an income. When Elizabeth Greenaway returned from Rolleston with the children, the family moved to Islington, where she opened a children&#x27;s dress shop that attracted well-to-do clients. 
The family lived in the flat above the shop, and young Kate, often left to her own devices to explore, spent many hours in the enclosed courtyard garden, later writing about it in her unfinished autobiography as a place filled with &quot;richness of colour and depth of shade.&quot;

John Greenaway provided for his mother and two sisters as well as for his own family. He took piecemeal engraving jobs, usually for weekly publications, such as &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;. He frequently worked on the wood carving throughout the night in front of the fire. Kate enjoyed watching him, and through his work was exposed to illustrations by John Leech, John Gilbert, and Kenny Meadows.

As a young child Greenaway&#x27;s parents taught her at home; later she was sent to various dame schools; she was an avid reader of chapbook versions of fairy tales – her favourites were &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot;, and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; – as well as illustrated editions of Shakespeare, writing later that children &quot;often don’t care a bit about the books people think they will and I think they often like grown-up books – at least I did.&quot; Her father&#x27;s engravings exposed her to weekly news stories, some of which were quite grisly, such as the series of his illustrations for the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; in 1856 about murderer William Palmer.

==Education and early work==

In 1857, at age 12, she began night classes at nearby Finsbury School, a local branch of South Kensington School of Art participating in National Course of Art Training in the decorative arts. Night courses, open only to women, were offered in drawing, porcelain painting, wood engraving, and lithography. She enrolled full-time a year later. The curriculum, devised by Henry Cole, was meant to train artisans in designing decorative wallpaper, tiles, and carpets. It emphasised strict adherence to copying geometric and botanical elements without creativity. There were four stages of courses, which she completed in 1864 before going to the Royal Female School of Art.

The headmaster at the Royal Female School of Art was Richard Burchett, whom Elizabeth Thompson described as a &quot;bearded, velvet-skull-capped and cold-searching-eyed man.&quot; Greenaway was quite shy and thought of herself as plain and unattractive compared to the other students. Yet she became friends with the much more popular Thompson, with whom she shared a studio. The two young women worked diligently in their studio to perfect their skills. At this point she was allowed to draw human figures, at first from plaster casts and then from models dressed in historical or ornamental costumes, skills she applied during the summers in Rolleston. However, she was unable to fully master human anatomy; frustrated that nude models were not permitted in the women&#x27;s classes, she enrolled in night classes at Heatherley School of Fine Art where she met Edward Burne-Jones, Edward Poynter, and Walter Crane.
In 1871 she enrolled in the Slade School of Fine Art, where Poynter was head master. Determined to break from Henry Cole&#x27;s rigid curriculum, he exhorted students to become more expressive and creative, concepts alien to Greenaway whose long early years of training consisted solely of copying and work with geometric designs. She struggled at Heatherley and once again was frustrated that women were segregated from men in the life class.

While she was still in school, Greenaway received commissions for children&#x27;s book illustrations. The first came in 1867 for a frontispiece for &quot;Infant Amusements&quot;, setting a path towards specialization in children&#x27;s books. Her reputation was built on the awards she had won while completing the National Art Courses, and buttressed with early exhibitions. She exhibited a set of fairy watercolours in 1868, which she sold to W. J. Loftie, publisher of &quot;People&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. He set them to verse and printed them in his magazine. A year later Frederick Warne &amp; Co purchased six illustrations for a toy book edition of &quot;Diamonds and Toads&quot;, printed by Joseph Martin Kronheim, which took a year to complete. In 1871 Gall &amp; Inglis published an edition of Madame d&#x27;Aulnoy&#x27;s fairy tales, which she illustrated. That year she continued with her classes and earned more than 70 pounds.

She was aware that the work she produced was overly gaudy, in part because she lacked technical knowledge of the Chromoxylography process. To gain a better understanding of the colour process, she made frequent visits to the National Gallery, where she studied masters such as Jan van Eyck, whose Arnolfini Portrait she especially liked. At that time, she gained access to the manuscript room at the British Museum, where she studied illuminated manuscripts.

==Freelance years==
The new, popular and lucrative card market coincided with the end of Greenaway&#x27;s formal training. Greetings cards first appeared in the 1840s, and by the 1860s the market had exploded. Card maker Marcus Ward &amp; Co hired Greenaway in 1871 on a freelance basis. With its reputation for high quality work, the Belfast firm was one of the pre-eminent card printers of the Victorian era. Her designs sold well and they said of her work that “her special talent was in the direction of costume figures and dainty colours.” Her cards sold well, and early Valentines sold 25,000 copies in weeks.

==&quot;Under the Window&quot;==
Her first book, &quot;Under the Window&quot; (1879), a collection of simple, perfectly idyllic verses about children, was a bestseller.

==Later years and death==
In the 1880s, the most popular designers of bookplates were Greenaway, along with Crane and Aubrey Beardsley. Their work exhibited intricate art nouveau elements with flowing vines and floral patterns.

Greenaway was elected to membership of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours in 1889. She exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. She lived in an Arts and Crafts style house she commissioned from Richard Norman Shaw in Frognal, London, although she spent summers in Rolleston.

Greenaway died of breast cancer in 1901, at the age of 55. She is buried in Hampstead Cemetery, London.

==Style==
Greenaway&#x27;s paintings were reproduced by chromoxylography, by which the colours were printed from hand-engraved wood blocks by the firm of Edmund Evans. Through the 1880s and 1890s, her only rivals in popularity in children&#x27;s book illustration were Walter Crane and Randolph Caldecott.

&quot;Kate Greenaway&quot; children, all of them girls and boys too young to be put in trousers, were dressed in her own versions of late 18th century and Regency fashions: smock-frocks and skeleton suits for boys, high-waisted pinafores and dresses with mobcaps and straw bonnets for girls. The influence of children&#x27;s clothes in portraits by British painter John Hoppner (1758–1810) may have provided her some inspiration. Liberty of London adapted Kate Greenaway&#x27;s drawings as designs for actual children&#x27;s clothes. A full generation of mothers in the liberal-minded &quot;artistic&quot; British circles who called themselves The Souls and embraced the Arts and Crafts movement dressed their daughters in Kate Greenaway pantaloons and bonnets in the 1880s and 1890s. The style was often used by painter Maude Goodman in her depictions of children.

==Legacy==
The Kate Greenaway Medal, established in her honour in 1955, is awarded annually by the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals in the UK to an illustrator of children&#x27;s books.

<doc id="163447" wikidata="Q471824" url="?curid=163447" title="Leon Spinks">
<text>Leon Spinks (July 11, 1953 – February 5, 2021) was an American professional boxer who competed from 1977 to 1995. In only his eighth professional fight, he won the undisputed heavyweight championship in 1978 after defeating Muhammad Ali in a split decision, in what is considered one of the biggest upsets in boxing history. Spinks was later stripped of the WBC title for facing Ali in an unapproved rematch seven months later, which he lost by a unanimous decision.

Besides being heavyweight champion and his characteristic gap-toothed grin (due to losing two and later all four of his front teeth), Spinks gained notoriety for the disaster which befell his career following his loss to Ali. However, he did challenge once more for the WBC heavyweight title in 1981 (losing to Larry Holmes by TKO in the third round), and the WBA cruiserweight title in 1986 (losing to Dwight Muhammad Qawi by TKO in the sixth round).

As an amateur, Spinks won numerous medals in the light heavyweight division. The first was bronze at the inaugural 1974 World Championships, followed by silver at the 1975 Pan American Games, and gold at the 1976 Summer Olympics; the latter alongside his brother Michael Spinks, who won middleweight gold. Leon served in the United States Marine Corps from 1973 to 1976, rising to the rank of corporal. He was stationed at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina and was on the Marine Corps Boxing Team.

Spinks also had a brief career as a professional wrestler from 1986, 1990 to 1993. He mainly worked for Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) and holding the FMW Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship in 1992.

==Amateur career==
Spinks won three consecutive national AAU light heavyweight championships from 1974 to 1976, the first of which came against future champion Michael Dokes. He was serving in the Marine Corps at the time.

===Olympic results===
Spinks won the light heavyweight gold medal at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. He defeated Abdel Latif Fatihi, Anatoliy Klimanov, Ottomar Sachse, and Janusz Gortat en route to the final, where he defeated Sixto Soria to win the gold.

Spinks finished his amateur career with a record of 178–7 with 133 knockouts.

==Professional career==
Spinks debuted professionally on January 15, 1977, in Las Vegas, Nevada, beating Bob Smith by knockout in five rounds. His next fight was in Liverpool, England, where he beat Peter Freeman by a first-round knockout. Later, he saw an improvement in opposition quality, when he fought Pedro Agosto of Puerto Rico and knocked him out in round one. He then fought Scott LeDoux to a draw and defeated Italian champion Alfio Righetti in a decision.

===Spinks vs. Ali===

At the time a lower-ranked contender, he made history on February 15, 1978, by decisively beating Muhammad Ali on a 15-round split decision, that was in actuality fairly one-sided, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Spinks won the world heavyweight title in his eighth professional fight, the shortest span in history. The aging Ali had expected an easy fight, but he was out-boxed by Spinks, who did not tire throughout the bout and had Ali ready to fall in the last seconds of the fight. It was one of the few occasions when Ali left the ring with a bruised and puffy face.

The victory over Ali was the peak of Spinks&#x27;s career. He was the only man to take a title from Muhammad Ali in the ring, as Ali&#x27;s other losses were non-title contests or bouts where Ali was the challenger. Spinks&#x27;s gap-toothed grin was featured on the cover of the February 19, 1978 issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

However, Spinks was stripped of his world title by the WBC for refusing to defend it against Ken Norton, instead agreeing to a return bout against Ali to defend his WBA crown. The title, stripped from Spinks, was then awarded to Norton.

===Rematch===

His second match with Ali, at the Louisiana Superdome on September 15, 1978, went badly for Spinks. A now-in-shape Ali—with better, sharper tactics—rarely lost control, winning back his title by a unanimous fifteen-round decision. Ali regained the title, becoming the first three-time lineal heavyweight champion. Spinks was never given a rematch; Ali retired after the fight (although he came out of retirement a few years later to fight Larry Holmes and Trevor Berbick).

===Career development===


Spinks&#x27;s next fight, his only one in 1979, was at Monte Carlo, where he was knocked out in the first round by future WBA world heavyweight champion Gerrie Coetzee. In the following fight, Spinks defeated former world title challenger and European title holder Alfredo Evangelista by a knockout in round 5. He then fought to a draw in with Eddie López, scored a knockout over Kevin Isaac in May, and, in October, beat the WBC&#x27;s top-ranked challenger, Bernardo Mercado, by a knockout in round nine on the undercard of Muhammad Ali vs. Larry Holmes.

His strong performance against Mercado earned Spinks a title match against Larry Holmes. In Spinks&#x27;s only fight in 1981, on June 12 and what would be his last opportunity to win the heavyweight title, he took multiple punches without responding in the third round and the referee stopped the fight.

===Move to cruiserweight===
It was Spinks&#x27;s last heavyweight bout for years, as he began boxing in the cruiserweight division. He beat contender Ivy Brown by a decision in ten rounds, and gained a decision against former and future title challenger Jesse Burnett in twelve rounds.

Spinks was due to face the World Cruiserweight number one David Pearce, but the fight was called off on 24 hours notice after the fighters had both weighed in, due to the BBBoC stance on Pearce fighting abroad in the newly formed Cruiserweight division.

When his brother Michael Spinks defeated Larry Holmes in a controversial upset for the IBF heavyweight championship in 1985, they became the only brothers to have held world heavyweight championships. They kept the distinction until the Klitschko brothers became champions two decades later.

In the 1980s Leon Spinks competed in several boxer vs. wrestler matches in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), including losing by submission to Antonio Inoki. In 1986 Spinks earned his last championship opportunity, fighting Dwight Muhammad Qawi for the WBA cruiserweight championship. Qawi had been defeated by Michael Spinks three years earlier for his WBC light heavyweight championship. However, Leon lost by TKO in the sixth round.

Spinks boxed for another eight years with mixed results. In 1994 he lost a bout by KO to John Carlo, the first time a former heavyweight champion had lost to a boxer making his pro debut (promoter Charles Farrell later admitted to falsifying Carlo&#x27;s record in order to get the fight sanctioned by the District of Columbia). Spinks retired at age 42, after losing an 8-round decision to Fred Houpe in 1995, who was coming off a seventeen-year hiatus.

==Professional wrestling career==
On October 9, 1986, Spinks lost to Japanese legend Antonio Inoki in a mixed martial arts fight for New Japan Pro Wrestling. Spinks made an appearance for the United States Wrestling Association on June 25, 1990, where he lost to Jerry Lawler by disqualification.

In 1991, Spinks made his debut in Japan for Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) teaming with fellow boxer Rufus Blackborn. He later teamed with Dr. Luther in 1992. On March 25, 1992, he defeated Tarzan Goto for the FMW Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship. He would drop the title to Atsushi Onita on May 24, 1992. In 1993, he feuded with Terry Funk and retired from wrestling later that year.

==Life after boxing==
During the 1990s, Spinks worked for Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling, winning its world title in 1992, making him only the second man (after Primo Carnera) to hold titles in both boxing and wrestling. In the late 1990s, Spinks was a headliner on year-round, touring autograph shows. In 2005 Spinks was living in Columbus, Nebraska, working as a janitor at a YMCA and at a McDonald&#x27;s.

In 2009, Spinks was featured as part of the 2009 documentary &quot;Facing Ali&quot;, in which notable former opponents of Ali speak about how fighting Ali changed their lives.

Spinks lived later in his life in Las Vegas, Nevada. He told a reporter his life was &quot;comfortable&quot;, and that he kept a low profile.

In August 2017, Leon was inducted into the Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame along with his brother, Michael.

==Personal life and health==
Spinks was born and raised in St. Louis.

Leon&#x27;s son, Cory Spinks, held the undisputed welterweight title, and was the IBF junior middleweight champion twice.

In 1990, Leon&#x27;s other son, Leon Calvin, was shot to death in East St. Louis as he was driving home from his girlfriend&#x27;s house. Calvin was an aspiring light heavyweight pro boxer with a record of 2–0, with the two pro bouts occurring only a month before he died. Leon&#x27;s grandson and Calvin&#x27;s son, Leon Spinks III, is an aspiring light heavyweight southpaw boxer with a pro record of 11–3–1 with seven knockouts, his last outing being a six-round draw with Robbie Cannon in October 2017.

Spinks perceptibly slurred his words after his active boxing days, and was diagnosed in 2012 with shrinkage in his brain, which doctors said was likely caused by the accumulated punches that he took during his career. In 2011, Spinks and his wife Brenda moved to Las Vegas. Spinks was hospitalized twice in 2014 in a Las Vegas hospital for surgery due to abdominal problems, from which he recovered.

In 2019, it was revealed that Spinks was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer. He died at a hospital in Henderson, Nevada on February 5, 2021, at age 67.

<text>Paul Edward Winfield (May 22, 1939 – March 7, 2004) was an American actor. He was known for his portrayal of a Louisiana sharecropper who struggles to support his family during the Great Depression in the landmark film &quot;Sounder&quot; (1972), which earned him an Academy Award nomination. He portrayed Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1978 television miniseries &quot;King&quot;, for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award. Winfield was also known for his roles in &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;, &quot;The Terminator, L.A. Law,&quot; and 24 episodes of the sitcom &quot;227&quot;. He received four Emmy nominations overall, winning in 1995 for his 1994 guest role in &quot;Picket Fences&quot;.

==Early years==
Winfield was the son of Lois Beatrice Edwards, a single mother who was a union organizer in the garment industry. Although published obituaries stated he was born May 22, 1941 in Los Angeles, some sources indicate he was born May 22, 1939 in Dallas, Texas. His stepfather from the age of eight was Clarence Winfield, a city trash collector and construction worker. Winfield graduated from Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles. From there, he attended the University of Portland, 1957–59; Stanford University, 1959; Los Angeles City College, 1959–63; University of California, Los Angeles, 1962–64; University of Hawaii, 1965 and the University of California, Santa Barbara, 1970–71, but did not earn a degree from any of them.

==Career==
A lifetime member of The Actors Studio, Winfield carved out a diverse career in film, television, theater and voiceovers by taking groundbreaking roles at a time when black actors were rarely even cast. He first appeared in the 1965 &quot;Perry Mason&quot; episode &quot;The Case of the Runaway Racer&quot; as Mitch, a race car mechanic. His first major feature film role was in the 1969 film &quot;The Lost Man&quot; starring Sidney Poitier. Winfield became well known to TV audiences when he appeared in several seasons of the groundbreaking television series &quot;Julia&quot; opposite Diahann Carroll. The show, filmed during a high point of racial tension in the U.S., was unique in featuring a black female as the central character. Winfield also starred as Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1978 miniseries &quot;King&quot;.

In 1973, Winfield was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for the 1972 film &quot;Sounder&quot;,; his co-star, Cicely Tyson, was nominated for Best Actress. Prior to their nominations and Diana Ross&#x27;s for &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot; the same year, only three other black Americans – Dorothy Dandridge, Sidney Poitier and James Earl Jones – had ever been nominated for a leading role. Winfield also appeared in a different role in the 2003 Disney-produced TV remake of &quot;Sounder&quot; directed by Kevin Hooks, his co-star from the original. Winfield played &quot;Jim the Slave&quot; in &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; (1974), a musical based on the Mark Twain novel. Winfield would recall later in his career that as a young actor he had played one of the leads in a local repertory production of &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; in whiteface - at the time, a black actor playing the role would have been unthinkable. Winfield also starred in several miniseries, including &quot;Scarlett&quot;, and two based on the works of novelist Alex Haley: &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.
Winfield gained a new segment of fans for his brief but memorable roles in several science fiction television series and films. He portrayed Starfleet starship Captain Terrell, an unwilling minion of the villain Khan, in &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,&quot; and Lieutenant Ed Traxler, a friendly but crusty cop partnered with Lance Henriksen in &quot;The Terminator&quot;. In 1996, he was in the &#x27;name&#x27; ensemble cast in Tim Burton&#x27;s comic homage to 1950s science fiction &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot;, playing the complacently self-satisfied Lt. General Casey. On the small screen, he appeared in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Darmok&quot; as Dathon, an alien captain who communicates in allegories. He appeared in the second season &quot;Babylon 5&quot; episode &quot;Gropos&quot; as General Richard Franklin, the father of regular character Dr. Stephen Franklin, and on the fairy tale sitcom &quot;The Charmings&quot; as The Evil Queen&#x27;s wisecracking Magic Mirror. He also portrayed Julian Barlow in the last two seasons of the TV series &quot;227&quot;.

Winfield also took on roles as homosexual characters in the films &quot;Mike&#x27;s Murder&quot; in 1984 and the 1998 film &quot;Relax...It&#x27;s Just Sex&quot;. He found success off-camera due to his unique voice. He provided voices for &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;The Magic School Bus&quot;, &quot;Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child&quot;, &quot;Gargoyles&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;, &quot;K10C&quot;, and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, voicing the Don King parody Lucius Sweet. In his voiceover career, Winfield is perhaps best known as narrator of the A&amp;E true crime series &quot;City Confidential&quot; from 1998 until his death in 2004.

Throughout his career, Winfield frequently managed to perform in the theater. &quot;Checkmates&quot; (1988), his only Broadway production, co-starred Ruby Dee and was also the Broadway debut of Denzel Washington. Winfield appeared in productions at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles and The Shakespeare Theatre in Washington, D.C. He was nominated for an Emmy Award for &quot;King&quot; and &quot;&quot;. In 1995, Winfield won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for his appearance as Judge Harold Nance in the CBS drama &quot;Picket Fences&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Winfield was gay, but remained discreet about it in the public eye. Prior to realizing his sexuality, he was in a relationship with his &quot;Sounder&quot; co-star Cicely Tyson. His partner of 30 years, architect Charles Gillan Jr., died of bone cancer on March 5, 2002.

Winfield long battled obesity and diabetes. On March 7, 2004, he died of a heart attack at Queen of Angels – Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles. Winfield and Gillan are interred together at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Los Angeles.

<doc id="163451" wikidata="Q1166180" url="?curid=163451" title="Julia (1977 film)">
<text>Julia is a 1977 American drama film directed by Fred Zinnemann and written by Alvin Sargent. It is based on a chapter from Lillian Hellman&#x27;s 1973 book &quot;Pentimento&quot; about the author&#x27;s relationship with a lifelong friend, Julia, who fought against the Nazis in the years prior to World War II. The film stars Jane Fonda as Hellman and Vanessa Redgrave as Julia. It co-stars Jason Robards, Hal Holbrook, Rosemary Murphy, Maximilian Schell, and Meryl Streep (in her film debut).

&quot;Julia&quot; released theatrically on October 2, 1977 by 20th Century Fox. The film received positive reviews from critics, grossed $20.7 million against its $7 million budget, and received a leading 11 nominations at the 50th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (for Zinnemann) and Best Actress (for Fonda), and won three awards: Best Supporting Actor (for Robards), Best Supporting Actress (for Redgrave) and Best Adapted Screenplay. At the 35th Golden Globe Awards, the film received a leading seven nominations, including for Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director and Best Supporting Actor (for both Robards and Schell), with Fonda and Redgrave winning for Best Actress - Drama and Best Supporting Actress respectively. It also received a leading 10 nominations at the 32nd British Academy Film Awards, including Best Direction and Best Actor in a Supporting Role (for Robards), and won four awards, including Best Film and Best Actress (for Fonda).

==Plot==
The young Lillian Hellman and her friend Julia, daughter of a wealthy family being brought up by her grandparents in the United States, enjoy a childhood together and a very close friendship in late adolescence. Later, while medical student Julia attends the University of Oxford and the University of Vienna and studies with such luminaries as Sigmund Freud, Lillian, a struggling writer, suffers through revisions of her play with her mentor and lover, famed author Dashiell Hammett, at a beach house.

Julia&#x27;s university in Vienna is overrun by Nazi thugs, and she is severely injured trying to protect others. Lillian receives word of Julia&#x27;s condition and rushes to Vienna to be with her. Julia is taken away for &quot;treatment&quot;, and Lillian is unable to find her again since the hospital denies any knowledge of her being treated there. She remains in Europe to try to find Julia but is unsuccessful.

Later, during the Nazi era, Lillian has become a celebrated playwright and is invited to a writers&#x27; conference in the USSR. Julia, having taken on the battle against Nazism, enlists Lillian &quot;en route&quot; to smuggle money into Germany to assist the anti-Nazi cause. It is a dangerous mission, especially for a Jewish intellectual on her way to Russia.

Lillian departs for the USSR via Berlin, and the movements of her person, and the placement of her possessions (a hat and a box of candy), are carefully guided by colleagues of Julia through border crossings and inspections. In Berlin, Lillian is told to go to a cafe, where she finds Julia. They speak only briefly. Julia divulges that the &quot;treatment&quot; she received in the hospital in Vienna was the amputation of her leg. Julia tells her that the money she has brought will save 500 to 1,000 people, many of them Jews. Lillian also learns that Julia has a daughter, Lilly, who is living with a baker in Alsace. After Lilian leaves Julia in the cafe and boards the train to Moscow, a man tells her to avoid passing through Germany again after she leaves the USSR.

When Lillian reaches Moscow, the atmosphere is gloomy and oppressive. She receives word that Julia is dead. Returning to London, she is told that Julia has been killed in the Frankfurt apartment of a friend by Nazi agents, although the details of her death are shrouded in secrecy. Lillian unsuccessfully looks for Julia&#x27;s daughter in Alsace. She returns to the United States and is reunited with Dashiell Hammett. She is haunted by Julia&#x27;s memories and is distraught at not finding Julia&#x27;s toddler. She is shocked that Julia&#x27;s family pretends not to remember Lillian as Julia&#x27;s friend, clearly wanting to excise from their memory a granddaughter who refused to conform at a time when conformity caused the murder of many innocent people.

The film ends with an image of Lillian Hellman many years later seated in a boat alone, fishing. She reveals in voiceover that she continued to live with Hammett for another thirty years and outlived him.

==Cast==


The film marked the film debut of Meryl Streep and Lisa Pelikan.

==Production==
&quot;Julia&quot; was shot on location in England and France. Although Lillian Hellman claimed the story was based on true events that occurred early in her life, the filmmakers later came to believe that most of it was fictionalized. Director Fred Zinnemann would later comment, &quot;Lillian Hellman in her own mind owned half the Spanish Civil War, while Hemingway owned the other half. She would portray herself in situations that were not true. An extremely talented, brilliant writer, but she was a phony character, I&#x27;m sorry to say. My relations with her were very guarded and ended in pure hatred.&quot;

The film was based on the &quot;Julia&quot; chapter of Hellman&#x27;s memoir &quot;Pentimento&quot;. On June 30, 1976, as the film was going into production, Hellman wrote about the screenplay to its producer:

In a 1979 television interview with Dick Cavett, author Mary McCarthy, long Hellman&#x27;s political adversary and the object of her negative literary judgment, said of Hellman that &quot;every word she writes is a lie, including &#x27;and&#x27; and &#x27;the&#x27;.&quot; Hellman responded by filing a US$2,500,000 defamation suit against McCarthy, interviewer Dick Cavett, and PBS. McCarthy produced evidence she said proved that Hellman had lied in some accounts of her life. Cavett said he sympathized more with McCarthy than Hellman in the lawsuit, but &quot;everybody lost&quot; as a result of it. Norman Mailer attempted unsuccessfully to mediate the dispute through an open letter he published in the &quot;New York Times&quot;. At the time of her death in 1984, Hellman was still in litigation with McCarthy; her executors dropped the suit.

In 1983, New York psychiatrist Muriel Gardiner became involved in the libel suit between McCarthy and Hellman. She claimed to be the model for the character named Julia in &quot;Pentimento&quot;, and in the movie &quot;Julia&quot; based on a chapter of that book. Hellman, who never met Gardiner, said that &quot;Julia&quot; was somebody else.

Gardiner wrote that, while she never met Hellman, she had often heard about her from her friend Wolf Schwabacher, who was Hellman&#x27;s lawyer. By Gardiner&#x27;s account, Schwabacher had visited Gardiner in Vienna. After Muriel Gardiner and Joseph Buttinger moved into their house at Brookdale Farm in Pennington, New Jersey in 1940, they divided the house in two. They rented half of it to Wolf and Ethel Schwabacher for more than ten years.

Many people believe that Hellmann based her story on Gardiner&#x27;s life. Gardiner&#x27;s editor cited the unlikelihood that there were two millionaire American women who were medical students in Vienna in the late 1930s.

==Reception==
&quot;Julia&quot; holds a 73% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The consensus summarizes: &quot;&quot;Julia&quot; is a handsomely crafted and stirringly performed meditation on friendship and political activism, although its tasteful formalism often undercuts the multifaceted passion of these historical figures.&quot; On Metacritic, the film earned a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on 10 reviews, signifying &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; gave it a positive review, praising Jane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave as being &quot;dynamite together on the screen&quot;, Richard Roth&#x27;s production as &quot;handsome and tasteful&quot;, as well as the period costumes and production design. Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat of &quot;Spirituality &amp; Practice&quot; described the film as &quot;extraordinary&quot;, writing: &quot;&quot;Julia&quot; gives us a genuine and affecting portrait of a friendship between two women who confirm each other and strengthen their bonds over the years.&quot;

The film received some criticism as failing to adequately portray the friendship between the two leads. Roger Ebert called the film a &quot;fascinating story&quot;, but felt the film suffered from being told by Lillian Hellman&#x27;s point of view. &quot;The film never really establishes a relationship between the two women,&quot; he wrote. &quot;It&#x27;s awkward, the way the film has to suspend itself between Julia – its ostensible subject – and Lillian Hellman, its real subject.&quot; He gave it two and a half out of four stars.

John Simon said of &quot;Julia&quot; &quot;Very little of what happens in the film is intrinsically interesting.&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot; gave it three out of five stars and declared it &quot;Beautifully crafted, nominated for 11 Academy Awards, a big hit at the box office--and a dramatic dud ... If you like red nail polish, faux-cynicism, painfully brave smiles and European train stations, &quot;Julia&quot; may be your kind of cocktail.&quot;

The film earned $7.5 million in North American rentals.

==Awards and nominations==
After Redgrave was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the Jewish Defense League objected to her nomination because she had narrated and helped fund a documentary entitled &quot;The Palestinian&quot;, which supported a Palestinian state. They also picketed the Oscar ceremony.

<doc id="163452" wikidata="Q3769219" url="?curid=163452" title="Julia (1968 TV series)">
<text>Julia is an American television sitcom and the second weekly series to star an African-American woman in a non-stereotypical role. Previous television series featured African-American lead characters, but the characters were usually servants. The show starred actress and singer Diahann Carroll, and ran for 86 episodes on NBC from September 17, 1968, to March 23, 1971. The series was produced by Savannah Productions, Inc., Hanncarr Productions, Inc., and 20th Century-Fox Television.

During pre-production, the proposed series title was &quot;Mama&#x27;s Man&quot;. The series was among the few situation comedies in the late 1960s that did not use a laugh track; however, 20th Century-Fox Television added one when the series was reissued for syndication and cable rebroadcasts in the late 1980s.

&quot;Julia&quot; was among the first acquisitions made by ASPiRE for its inaugural season in 2012.

== Synopsis ==

In &quot;Julia&quot;, Carroll played widowed single mother, Julia Baker (her husband, Army Capt. Baker, an O-1 Bird Dog artillery spotter pilot had been shot down in Vietnam), who was a nurse in a doctor&#x27;s office at a large aerospace company. The doctor, Morton Chegley, was played by Lloyd Nolan, and Julia&#x27;s romantic interests by Paul Winfield and Fred Williamson. Julia&#x27;s son, Corey (Marc Copage) was approximately six to nine years old during the series run. He had barely known his father before he died. Corey&#x27;s best friend was Earl J. Waggedorn, whom Corey almost always addressed and referred to precisely by his full name, though other characters (particularly his mother) would refer to him simply as Earl. The Waggedorns lived downstairs in the same apartment building, with father, police officer Leonard (Hank Brandt), stay-at-home mother Marie (Betty Beaird), and two sons, Earl and an infant whose first name is never revealed.

The first two seasons included nurse Hannah Yarby (Lurene Tuttle), who left to be married at the beginning of the third season, just as the clinic&#x27;s manager, Brockmeyer, ordered downsizing — and removal of minorities from employment. (Chegley let Yarby go but kept Julia in defiance of the manager&#x27;s edict. She was also kept after Chegley reminded Brockmeyer that such a move was a violation of the Civil Rights Act, which was just five years old at that point.) The second and third season included Richard (Richard Steele), a boy some one or two years older than Corey. Chegley&#x27;s uncle, Dr. Norton Chegley (also played by Lloyd Nolan), made three appearances. The series&#x27; first episode was filmed in October 1967, a year before the pilot was picked up.

== Controversy ==
Although &quot;Julia&quot; is remembered today as groundbreaking, during its original run the series was derided by many critics for being apolitical and unrealistic. In 1968, Diahann Carroll remarked: &quot;At the moment we&#x27;re presenting the white Negro. And he has very little Negroness.&quot; The &quot;Saturday Review&#x27;s&quot; Robert Lewis Shayon wrote that Julia&#x27;s &quot;plush, suburban setting&quot; was &quot;a far, far cry from the bitter realities of Negro life in the urban ghetto, the pit of America&#x27;s explosion potential.&quot; Gil Scott-Heron&#x27;s &quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&quot; refers to Julia in the same breath as Bullwinkle, implying that the character was something of a cartoon. &quot;Ebony&quot; published a somewhat more supportive assessment of the program: &quot;As a slice of Black America, &quot;Julia&quot; does not explode on the TV screen with the impact of a ghetto riot. It is not that kind of show. Since the networks have had a rash of shows dealing with the nation&#x27;s racial problems, the light-hearted &quot;Julia&quot; provides welcome relief, if, indeed, relief is even acceptable in these troubled times.&quot; The series also came under criticism from African-American viewers for its depiction of a fatherless Black family due to the father&#x27;s death in American military service. Excluding a Black male lead, it was argued, &quot;rendered the series safer&quot; and &quot;less likely to grapple with issues that might upset white viewers.&quot;

== Nielsen ratings ==
== Cancellation ==
&quot;Julia&quot; received good ratings the first two seasons but dropped out of the top 30 most-watched shows during season 3. In 1971, the series was canceled, reportedly because of Carroll&#x27;s and series creator and executive producer Hal Kanter&#x27;s desire to work on other projects. Kanter created and produced the short-lived &quot;The Jimmy Stewart Show&quot; for NBC the following season.

<doc id="163454" wikidata="Q771605" url="?curid=163454" title="Save the Tiger">
<text>Save the Tiger is a 1973 American drama film about moral conflict in contemporary America directed by John G. Avildsen, and starring Jack Lemmon, Jack Gilford, Laurie Heineman, Thayer David, Lara Parker, and Liv Lindeland. The screenplay was written years prior by Steve Shagan, who novelized his screenplay in 1971 while trying to sell the script to a studio. The film was made through a co-production deal between Lemmon&#x27;s Jalem Productions, Shagan&#x27;s Cirandinha Productions, and Martin Ransohoff&#x27;s Filmways.

Lemmon won the 1974 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Harry Stoner (making him the first of six actors to win Oscars for both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor), an executive in the garment industry who struggles with the complexity of modern life versus the simplicity of his youth.

==Plot==
Harry Stoner lives in high style in a Beverly Hills mansion with a Spanish-speaking maid. Traumatized by combat in WWII, and overwhelmed by his business and life pressures, he is obsessed with his baseball-loving youth. Awakening in a scream for the second time that week, and acting out pre-war Brooklyn Dodgers baseball games in the bedroom − including a wild pitching windup he nostalgically recalls − he is urged by his wife, Janet, to call a Dr. Frankfurter for a hypnosis session. He&#x27;s explained to her that every morning he wakes up costs him $200 − what with the mortgage, daughter&#x27;s Swiss school, pool cleaner, tree surgeon, etc. − and that they have to somehow finance a new line of female fashion at work, after doing &quot;ballet with the books&quot; the previous year to stay afloat (triggering a possible audit).

Driving to the office in his new Lincoln Continental, he picks up a free-spirited young hitchhiker on Sunset Strip − Myra, last of the flower-power hippies. She asks him if he wants to &quot;ball&quot;; he thanks her for asking but declines because he&#x27;s late to work.

Stoner co-owns a financially struggling Los Angeles apparel company, Capri Casuals. He and his partner, Phil Greene, have kept it from collapsing by fraudulent accounting and are possibly facing an audit. Today is the day of their big fashion show for their out-of-town buyers and Stoner and Greene argue intensely about what to do to pay for the new fashion line. The bank will only give them 50% on sales and they will need another like amount within 60 days.

Dismissing all legal ways to come up with the money, while asking Greene if he really wants to be out on the street looking for a job at his age, Stoner poses the possibility of torching their Long Beach factory for the insurance payout. An important client arrives by trains from Ohio, expecting service by a local prostitute, Margo, which Stoner has arranged for him in the past. The client suffers an arterial occlusion while cavorting with her and a French-speaking assistant, and is taken by ambulance for emergency treatment with heart specialists. Still shaky from dealing with his client&#x27;s medical emergency, Stoner takes the stage at the premiere of his company&#x27;s new line, only to be overcome by war memories as he imagines seeing injured soldiers in the audience. Explaining that the Capri in his company name is the island in Italy where he was treated for his war injuries in a barely coherent ramble, he&#x27;s saved by the event&#x27;s emcee. The line is a success with buyers but all express concern about Stoner. Sid Fivush, a financier with the mob, offers emergency financing backstage at 200%.

Stoner and Greene furtively meet the arsonist Charlie Robbins in the balcony of a blue movie theater, passing him an envelope containing a $2,500 cash retainer and keys and address for the factory he is to burn down. He will check out the property that evening and they&#x27;ll meet again at the theater the next morning. On the way out of the theater Stoner is asked to sign a petition to save the world&#x27;s tigers. Stoner ends the day picking up Myra again, who is still hitchhiking, and spending the night with her where she&#x27;s house sitting. Again he refuses sex and his behavior, including an incoherent rant, causes Myra concern.

At their meeting the next day Robbins informs them their warehouse is too far out of compliance on fire safety regulations, the insurance company would never pay out on a fire. The only way would be for him to start the fire in another business on the ground floor, owned by someone Stoner and Greene know, and funnel the flames into their second-floor space above. Stoner agrees to this without Greene, whom he asks Robbins to forget completely if things go wrong.

Stoner comes upon boys playing baseball in a field. The ball is hit to his left field fence. He enters the field to return it and winds up dramatically to pitch, sending the ball far over the backstop. The kids ask him why he did that. &quot;So you could see it one time,&quot; Stoner replies, remaining on the field with a smile on his face. A kid looks at him and shouts, &quot;You can&#x27;t play with us, Mister!&quot;

==Cast==
==Production==
The movie was written by Steve Shagan and directed by John G. Avildsen. Lemmon was determined to make the movie, despite its limited commercial prospects, and so he waived his usual salary and worked for scale. The movie was filmed in sequence after three weeks of rehearsal in Los Angeles. There is also a novel version of &quot;Save the Tiger&quot;, by Shagan: the title comes from a campaign to save tigers from extinction for which Stoner signs a petition.

==Reception==
The movie failed financially at the box office, but critics and viewers who saw it liked the performance of Lemmon as Stoner. Critic John Simon wrote &quot;Save the Tiger&quot; &#x27;is a film with good, serious intentions, and thus a somewhat touching failure&#x27;.

&quot;New York Times&quot; critic Vincent Canby called it &quot;not a very good movie but it&#x27;s a rather brave one, a serious-minded examination of some of the least interesting aspects of the failed American dream&quot;.

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 86% based on 28 reviews, and an average rating of 7.2/10. The consensus summarizes: &quot;Jack Lemmon&#x27;s outstanding performance helps &quot;Save the Tiger&quot; grab early &#x27;70s American anxiety firmly by the tail&quot;.

<doc id="163456" wikidata="Q570567" url="?curid=163456" title="Last Tango in Paris">
<text>Last Tango in Paris (; ) is a 1972 erotic drama film directed by Bernardo Bertolucci. The film stars Marlon Brando, Maria Schneider and Jean-Pierre Léaud, and portrays a recently widowed American who begins an anonymous sexual relationship with a young Parisian woman.

The film premiered at the New York Film Festival on 14 October 1972 and grossed $36 million in its U.S. theatrical release, making it the seventh highest-grossing film of 1973. The film&#x27;s raw portrayal of rape and emotional turmoil led to international controversy and drew various levels of government censorship in different jurisdictions. Upon release in the United States, the MPAA gave the film an X rating. United Artists Classics released an R-rated cut in 1981. In 1997, after the film became part of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer library, the film was reclassified as NC-17.

== Plot ==
Paul, a middle-aged American hotel owner mourning the suicide of his wife Rosa, meets a young, engaged Parisian woman named Jeanne at an apartment that both are interested in renting. Paul takes the apartment after they begin an anonymous sexual relationship there. He insists that they not share any personal information, even given names, much to Jeanne&#x27;s dismay. At one point in their relationship, he rapes her. Despite this, she tells him that she tries to leave him, but can&#x27;t bring herself to do it. The affair of Paul and Jeanne continues for some time until Paul decides to leave Jeanne, after which she arrives at the apartment and finds that he has packed up and left without warning.

After attending his wife&#x27;s viewing, Paul meets Jeanne on the street and says he wants to renew the relationship. He tells her of the recent tragedy of his wife. As he tells his life story, they walk into a tango bar, where he continues telling her about himself. The loss of anonymity disillusions Jeanne about their relationship. She tells Paul she does not want to see him again. Paul, not wanting to let Jeanne go, chases her through the streets of Paris. While running, she continually yells at him to go away and tells him that their relationship is over. Despite her threats to call the police, he chases her all the way back to her building where she is living with her mother and forces his way into her apartment. He mocks her for running away from him, followed by him saying he loves her and wants to know her name.

Jeanne takes a gun from a drawer. She tells Paul her name and shoots him. Paul staggers out onto the balcony, mortally wounded, and collapses. As Paul dies, Jeanne, dazed, mutters to herself that he was just a stranger who tried to rape her and she did not know who he was, as if in a rehearsal preparing herself for questioning by the police.

== Production ==

Bernardo Bertolucci developed the film from his sexual fantasies: &quot;He once dreamed of seeing a beautiful nameless woman on the street and having sex with her without ever knowing who she was.&quot; The screenplay was by Bertolucci, Franco Arcalli, and Agnès Varda (additional dialogue). It was later adapted as a novel by Robert Alley. The film was directed by Bertolucci with cinematography by Vittorio Storaro.

Bertolucci originally intended to cast Dominique Sanda, who developed the idea with him, and Jean-Louis Trintignant. Trintignant refused and, when Brando accepted, Sanda was pregnant and decided not to do the film. Brando received a percentage of the gross for the film and was estimated to have earned $3 million.

Maria Schneider stated in 2001 that her role in the original script was intended to be played by a boy.

An art lover, Bertolucci drew inspiration from the works of the Irish-born British artist Francis Bacon for the opening sequence of cast and crew credits. According to American artist Andy Warhol, &quot;Last Tango&quot; was based on Warhol&#x27;s own &quot;Blue Movie&quot; film released a few years earlier in 1969.

=== Rape scene ===
The film contains a scene in which Paul anally rapes Jeanne using butter as a lubricant. While the rape is simulated, Schneider has said the scene still had a tremendously negative effect on her. In a 2006 interview, Schneider said that the scene was not in the script and that &quot;when they told me, I had a burst of anger. Woo! I threw everything. And nobody can force someone to do something not in the script. But I didn&#x27;t know that. I was too young.&quot; In 2007, Schneider recounted feelings of sexual humiliation pertaining to the rape scene:

In 2011, Bertolucci denied that he &quot;stole her youth&quot; (she was 19 at the time of filming), and commented, &quot;The girl wasn&#x27;t mature enough to understand what was going on.&quot; Schneider remained friends with Brando until his death in 2004, but never made up with Bertolucci. She also claimed that Brando and Bertolucci &quot;made a fortune&quot; from the film while she made very little money.

Schneider died in 2011. In February 2013, Bertolucci spoke about the film&#x27;s effect on Schneider in an interview on the Dutch television show &quot;College Tour&quot;, saying that although the rape scene was in the script, the detail of using butter as a lubricant was improvised the day of shooting and Schneider did not know about the use of the butter beforehand. Bertolucci said that &quot;I feel guilty, but I don&#x27;t regret it.&quot; In September 2013, Bertolucci spoke again about the scene at a retrospective at the Cinémathèque Française, claiming that the scene was in the script but the use of butter was not. Bertolucci said that he and Brando &quot;decided not to say anything to Maria to get a more realistic response&quot;.

In November 2016, a slightly different version of the 2013 &quot;College Tour&quot; interview was uploaded to YouTube by the Spanish non-profit &quot;El Mundo de Alycia&quot; on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, accompanied by a statement concluding that the scene &quot;abused [Schneider] psychologically and, who knows if also, physically...&quot; This gained attention when &quot;Yahoo! Movies&quot; writer Tom Butler wrote an article about it, prompting several celebrities to condemn the film and Bertolucci, and a number of newspapers picked up on the story, reporting that Bertolucci had confessed to Schneider being raped on set, prompting Bertolucci to release a statement, clarifying that a simulation and not an actual intercourse took place.

Bertolucci also shot a scene which showed Brando&#x27;s genitals, but in 1973 explained, &quot;I had so identified myself with Brando that I cut it out of shame for myself. To show him naked would have been like showing me naked.&quot; Schneider declared in an interview that &quot;Marlon said he felt raped and manipulated by it and he was 48. And he was Marlon Brando!&quot; Like Schneider, Brando confirmed that the sex was simulated. Brando refused to speak to Bertolucci for 15 years after the production was completed. Bertolucci said:

=== Francis Bacon influence ===
The film&#x27;s opening credits include two paintings by Francis Bacon: &quot;Double Portrait of Lucian Freud and Frank Auerbach&quot; and &quot;Study for a Portrait of Isabel Rawsthorne&quot;. The hues used in the film were inspired by the paintings of Bacon. During pre-production, Bertolucci frequently visited an exhibit of Bacon&#x27;s paintings at the Grand Palais in Paris; he said that the light and colour in Bacon&#x27;s paintings reminded him of Paris in the winter, when

the lights of the stores are on, and there is a very beautiful contrast between the leaden gray of the wintry sky and the warmth of the show windows...the light in the paintings was the major source of inspiration for the style we were looking for.

Bacon&#x27;s painting style often depicted human skin like raw meat and the painter&#x27;s inspiration included meat hanging in a butcher shops window and human skin diseases.

Cinematographer Vittorio Storaro had previously worked with Bertolucci on &quot;The Conformist&quot; and often used an azure hue in the film. Storaro later told a reporter that

after &quot;The Conformist&quot; I had a moment of crisis; I was asking myself: what can come after azure?...I did not have the slightest idea that an orange film could be born. We needed another kind of emotion...It was the case of &quot;Last Tango&quot;.

For &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;, Bertolucci and Storaro took inspiration from Bacon&#x27;s paintings by using &quot;rich oranges, light and cool grays, icy whites, and occasional reds combine[d] with Bertolucci&#x27;s own tasteful choices of soft browns, blond browns, and delicate whites with bluish and pink shadings&quot;.

Bertolucci took Marlon Brando to the Bacon exhibit and told Brando that he &quot;wanted him to compare himself with Bacon&#x27;s human figures because I felt that, like them, Marlon&#x27;s face and body were characterized by a strange and infernal plasticity. I wanted Paul to be like the figures that obsessively return in Bacon: faces eaten by something coming from the inside.&quot;

=== Brando&#x27;s lines ===
As was his practice in previous films, Brando refused to memorize his lines for many of the scenes. Instead, he wrote his lines on cue cards and posted them around the set, leaving Bertolucci with the problem of keeping them out of the picture frame. During his long monologue over the body of his wife, for example, Brando&#x27;s dramatic lifting of his eyes upward is not spontaneous dramatic acting but a search for his next cue card. Brando asked Bertolucci if he could &quot;write lines on Maria&#x27;s rear end&quot;, which the director rejected.

== Soundtrack ==
The film score was composed by Gato Barbieri, arranged and conducted by Oliver Nelson, and the soundtrack album was released on the United Artists label. AllMusic&#x27;s Richie Unterberger noted &quot;Although some of the smoky sax solos get a little uncomfortably close to 1970s fusion cliché, Gato Barbieri&#x27;s score to Bertolucci&#x27;s 1972 classic is an overall triumph. Suspenseful jazz, melancholy orchestration, and actual tangos fit the film&#x27;s air of erotic longing, melancholy despair, and doomed fate&quot;. The soundtrack includes &quot;Six Penny Ride&quot; by Trevor Duncan (1924-2005).

== Reception ==
The film premiered as the closing film at the New York Film Festival on 14 October 1972, with high demand and enormous public controversy. The film did not have any press screenings due to concerns that the film was being shown against Italian law after the Italian censors had not passed the film. The lack of screenings increased demand for the film with some offering $100 to buy a ticket.

The film opened in late 1972 in France, where filmgoers stood in two-hour queues for the first month of its run at the seven cinemas where it was screened. It gained unanimous positive reviews in every major French publication. To circumvent Spanish state censorship, thousands of Spaniards travelled hundreds of kilometers to reach French cinemas in Biarritz and Perpignan where &quot;Tango&quot; was playing. Following that, it was released in the United States, Great Britain, and other venues.

The film generated considerable controversy because of its subject and graphic portrayal of sex. Schneider provided frank interviews in the wake of &quot;Tango&quot;″s controversy, claiming she had slept with 50 men and 20 women, that she was &quot;bisexual completely&quot;, and that she had used heroin, cocaine, and marijuana. She also said of Bertolucci, &quot;He&#x27;s quite clever and more free and very young. Everybody was digging what he was doing, and we were all very close.&quot;

During the publicity for the film&#x27;s release, Bertolucci said Schneider developed an &quot;Oedipal [sic] fixation with Brando&quot;. Schneider said Brando sent her flowers after they first met, and &quot;from then on he was like a daddy&quot;. In a later interview, Schneider denied this, saying, &quot;Brando tried to be very paternalistic with me, but it really wasn&#x27;t any father-daughter relationship.&quot; However, in 2007, she said that &quot;for me, he was more like a father figure and I a daughter.&quot;

In Italy, the film was released on 15 December 1972, grossing an unprecedented $100,000 in six days. One week later, however, police seized all copies on the order of a prosecutor, who defined the film as &quot;self-serving pornography&quot;, and its director was put on trial for &quot;obscenity&quot;. Following first degree and appeal trials, the fate of the film was sealed on 26 January 1976 by the Italian Supreme Court, which sentenced all copies to be destroyed (though some were preserved by the National Film Library). Bertolucci was served with a four-month suspended sentence in prison and had his civil rights revoked for five years, depriving him of voting rights. It grossed 7 billion lire ($3.9 million) in its initial release in Italy. It was re-released in 1987 where it grossed an additional 5 billion lire ($2.7 million). In 2000, it was listed as the second-highest grossing Italian film in Italy adjusted for inflation.

=== Response in United States ===
The film opened February 1, 1973 at the Trans-Lux East in New York City with a $5 ticket price and advance sales of $100,000, grossing $41,280 in its first week. The media frenzy surrounding the film generated intense popular interest as well as moral condemnation, and the film was featured in cover stories in both &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazines. &quot;Playboy&quot; published a photo spread of Brando and Schneider &quot;cavorting in the nude&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; wrote,

The &quot;Village Voice&quot; reported walkouts by board members and &quot;vomiting by well-dressed wives&quot;. Columnist William F. Buckley and ABC&#x27;s Harry Reasoner denounced the film as &quot;pornography disguised as art&quot;.

After local government officials failed to ban the film in Montclair, New Jersey, theatergoers had to push through a mob of 200 outraged residents, who hurled epithets like &quot;perverts&quot; and &quot;homos&quot; at the attendees. Later, a bomb threat temporarily halted the showing. The New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women denounced the film as a tool of &quot;male domination&quot;.

The film&#x27;s scandal centred mostly on an anal rape scene, featuring Paul&#x27;s use of butter as a lubricant. According to Schneider, the scene was not in the original script, but was Brando&#x27;s idea. Other critics focused on when the character Paul asks Jeanne to insert her fingers in his anus, then asks her to prove her devotion to him by, among other things, having sex with a pig. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film&#x27;s sexual content as the artistic expression of the &quot;era of Norman Mailer and Germaine Greer&quot; and was upset about the high ticket price.

Film critic Pauline Kael endorsed the film, writing that &quot;&quot;Tango&quot; has altered the face of an art form. This is a movie people will be arguing about for as long as there are movies.&quot; She called it &quot;the most powerfully erotic movie ever made, and it may turn out to be the most liberating movie ever made.&quot; United Artists reprinted the whole of Kael&#x27;s rave as a double-page advertisement in the Sunday &quot;New York Times&quot;. Kael&#x27;s review of &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; is regarded as the most influential piece of her career.

Many feminist film critics disliked the film. In a 1974 review in &quot;Jump Cut&quot;, E. Ann Kaplan criticized it for featuring &quot;a one-sided relationship seen mostly through Paul&#x27;s eyes.&quot; In &quot;Women and Their Sexuality in the New Film,&quot; (1974) one of the first explicitly feminist books on film, Joan Mellen complains about a similar issue, that Jeanne constantly gives way to Paul, &quot;the man who is made more interesting in every way.&quot; However, a few did enjoy it, such as Molly Haskell, who responded to feminist criticism in &quot;From Reverence to Rape: The Treatment of Women in the Movies&quot; (1974) by noting that women more than men seemed to respond to the film, and that female sexual fantasies can include &quot;rape, sadism, submission, liberation, and anonymous sex.&quot;

The American critic Roger Ebert repeatedly described Kael&#x27;s review as &quot;the most famous movie review ever published&quot;, and he added the film to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; collection. American director Robert Altman expressed unqualified praise: &quot;I walked out of the screening and said to myself, &#x27;How dare I make another film?&#x27; My personal and artistic life will never be the same.&quot;

Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected 44 reviews and gave the film an approval rating of 82%, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Naturalistic but evocative, &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; is a vivid exploration of pain, love, and sex featuring a typically towering Marlon Brando performance.&quot; 

In 2004, director Martin Scorsese compared this &quot;towering Brando performance&quot; to the actor&#x27;s turn as Terry Malloy in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954) and noted that &quot;[w]hen you watch his work in ... &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;, you&#x27;re watching the purest poetry imaginable, in dynamic motion&quot;.

Ethan Hawke considered Brando&#x27;s work a seminal moment in the movement of performance. Praising both the star and the director of the film, Hawke told Richard Linklater and Louis Black that, &quot;Brando upped [&quot;On the Waterfront&quot;] with &quot;Last Tango&quot;.&quot; Pauline Kael, in her aforementioned review, had echoed the same sentiments by saying, &quot;On the screen Brando is our genius as [Norman] Mailer is our genius in literature … Paul feels so &#x27;real&#x27; and the character is brought so close that a new dimension in screen acting has been reached.&quot;

Richard Brody of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; praised the personal nature of Brando&#x27;s role, commenting in his review of &quot;Listen to Me Marlon&quot; (2015) that, &quot;When Brando said what he himself had to say, it was indeed of a unique value. That&#x27;s why the best of Brando is when he&#x27;s closest to himself, as in ... Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;, from 1972. It isn&#x27;t only his words that are better than those of the screenwriters; his persona, his character, is greater than those that are scripted.&quot; In 2019, actor Brad Pitt said the film from the past he&#x27;d most like to have starred in is &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;, &quot;Brando. That one hurts.&quot; &quot;Premiere&quot; had named Brando&#x27;s performance the 27th-greatest film performance of all time in April 2006.

The film was given a nationwide release on February 7, 1973, and grossed $36 million in the United States and Canada, the seventh highest-grossing film of 1973.

=== Other international responses ===
British censors reduced the duration of the sodomy sequence before permitting the film to be released in the United Kingdom, though it is not cut in later releases. Mary Whitehouse, a Christian morality campaigner, expressed outrage that the film had been certified &quot;X&quot; rather than banned outright, and Labour MP Maurice Edelman denounced the classification as &quot;a licence to degrade&quot;.

The film was censored in Spain during the Franco regime and was not released until December 1977. Chile banned the film entirely for nearly thirty years under its military government, and the film was similarly suppressed in Portugal, until the Carnation Revolution in 1974, when its première became an example of the freedom democracy allows. The same happened in Brazil during the period of military dictatorship when the film was censored, until it was finally released in 1979. Other countries that banned it include Argentina, South Korea, Singapore, and Venezuela.

In Australia, the film was released uncut with an R certificate by the Australian Classification Board on 1 February 1973. It received a VHS release by Warner Home Video with the same classification on 1 January 1987, forbidding sale or hire to anyone under the age of 18.

In Canada, the film was banned by the Nova Scotia Board of Censors, leading to the landmark 1978 Supreme Court of Canada split decision in &quot;Nova Scotia (Board of Censors) v McNeil&quot;, which upheld the provinces&#x27; right to censor films.

=== Legacy ===
&quot;Being Maria&quot;, a film based on Maria Schneider&#x27;s experiences working on &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;, was released in 2024, having its premiere at the 77th Cannes Film Festival. The film was directed by Jessica Palud and adapted from Vanessa Schneider&#x27;s 2018 memoir &quot;My Cousin Maria Schneider&quot;.

Also released in 2024, the biopic &quot;Waltzing with Brando&quot; depicts the period between 1969 and 1974 in which Brando was preparing to star in &quot;The Godfather&quot; and &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;.

=== Cinémathèque française screening controversy ===
In December 2024, a planned screening of &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; at the Parisian theater Cinémathèque française was cancelled after women&#x27;s rights groups protested the showing due to the film&#x27;s infamous rape scene. French actress Judith Godrèche also protested the theater&#x27;s decision to show the film without context given to the rape scene, writing on Instagram: &quot;It’s time to wake up, dear Cinémathèque, and restore humanity to a 19-year-old actor by behaving humanely.&quot; The cinema&#x27;s director, Frédéric Bonnaud, stated that the decision to pull the film was because &quot;We are a cinema, not a fortress. We cannot take risks with the safety of our staff and audience,&quot; and stated that &quot;Violent individuals were beginning to make threats and holding this screening and debate posed an entirely disproportionate risk.&quot; His statements led to further criticism from feminist groups, who accused him as posing as a victim, and stating he should have instead apologized for wanting to screen the film to begin with. The 50/50 Collective, another women&#x27;s rights group, had called on the Cinématheque to provide &quot;thoughtful and respectful&quot; place for Schneider’s testimony and experience alongside the screening. Other feminists stated they would have approved of the screening had a discussion been had after the screening and a note handed to the viewers describing the non-consensual background of the scene.

=== Accolades ===
In 2002, the film ranked #48 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Passions.

<text>The Last Detail is a 1973 American comedy-drama film directed by Hal Ashby, from a screenplay by Robert Towne, based on the 1970 novel by Darryl Ponicsan. The film stars Jack Nicholson, Otis Young, Randy Quaid, Clifton James, and Carol Kane. It follows two career sailors assigned to escort a young emotionally withdrawn junior sailor from their Virginia base to Portsmouth Naval Prison in New Hampshire.

&quot;The Last Detail&quot; was theatrically released in the United States by Columbia Pictures on December 12, 1973. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances of Nicholson and Quaid, as well as Towne&#x27;s screenplay. It was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards, three Academy Awards, and four British Academy Film Awards (winning two).

==Plot==
In Norfolk, Virginia, Navy lifers Signalman First Class Billy &quot;Badass&quot; Buddusky and Gunner&#x27;s Mate First Class Richard &quot;Mule&quot; Mulhall are assigned a shore patrol detail escorting 18-year-old seaman Larry Meadows to Portsmouth Naval Prison near Kittery, Maine. Meadows has been court-martialed, dishonorably discharged, and sentenced to eight years in the brig for attempted robbery of $40 from a charity donation box, which happened to be run by the wife of the Norfolk Naval Base Commander.

Badass and Mule are given one week to accompany Meadows to the brig. Despite their initial resentment of the detail and Meadows&#x27; habit of stealing, they come to like the young man, who is timid, naive, and resigned to his fate. Out of sympathy for what they feel is Meadows&#x27; unjust sentence and wanting to show him a good time, the pair make stops along their route to provide &quot;bon-voyage&quot; adventures for the young man.

The group&#x27;s activities include bar-hopping, brawling with Marines, and other misadventures. They stay overnight at a hotel, drinking and watching TV after missing their train. Badass teaches Meadows some flag semaphore signals and tries to get the young prisoner to stick up for himself by provoking him into a fight, but is unsuccessful. The following morning, they take a detour to Camden, New Jersey to see Meadows&#x27; mother, but she is not home. Meadows is embarrassed and ashamed after the three enter the house and find it in a state of disarray with empty liquor bottles lying around.

In New York City, the men encounter a group of chanting Nichiren Buddhists who teach Meadows how to pray. One of the Buddhists invites the trio to a house party, where she offers to help Meadows flee his imprisonment and find refuge in Canada. Meadows declines, reasoning he does not want to cause trouble for his &quot;best friends&quot;. Badass tries to seduce a woman at the party by talking about the romance of the sea, but she shows little interest. Mule makes awkward conversation about serving in the Navy with the liberal party guests.

In Boston, Badass and Mule take Meadows to a brothel so he can lose his virginity. When alone with a young prostitute, Meadows immediately ejaculates, but Mule and Badass pay for Meadows to have a second chance. While waiting, Badass and Mule make conversation about their lives outside of the Navy. Badass reveals a previous marriage dissolved because his wife wanted him to be a TV repairman. Mule has not married and is still supporting his mother. The next morning, Meadows tells the two men that despite the prostitute&#x27;s profession, he thinks she might have had romantic feelings for him.

Just as they are about to leave for Portsmouth, Meadows makes a final request for a picnic. The senior sailors buy some hot dogs and attempt a frigid barbecue in the snow at a local park, where Badass confides in Mule about his concern for Meadows and the potential abuse that he will face in prison. Meadows suddenly bolts in a last-ditch effort to run away but falls down and is caught by the two men, who subdue and pummel him.

Badass and Mule take Meadows to the brig, where he is marched off to be processed without a word. The young duty officer, a Marine first lieutenant wearing an Annapolis ring, notices Meadows&#x27; injuries and berates Badass and Mule. The sailors are asked if Meadows tried to resist or fight, which they deny. The officer gives them a hard time, noticing that their orders were never signed by the master-at-arms in Norfolk, and claiming that as far the Navy is concerned, the orders are still in Norfolk. The officer says the pair are in deep trouble but relents when they demand to speak to his boss, the Executive Officer. On the way out, Badass admonishes the officer for forgetting to keep his copy of the paperwork. With the detail complete, the pair stride away from the prison complaining about the officer&#x27;s incompetence. Both hope their orders will have come through when they get back to Norfolk.

Producer Gerry Ayres had bought the rights to Darryl Ponicsan&#x27;s novel in 1969. After returning from the set of &quot;Drive, He Said&quot;, Robert Towne began adapting the novel. The screenwriter tailored the script for close friends Jack Nicholson and Rupert Crosse. In adapting the novel, Towne removed Buddusky&#x27;s &quot;closet intellectualism and his beautiful wife&quot;. The screenwriter also changed the ending so that Buddusky lives instead of dying as he does in the book. Ayres convinced Columbia Pictures to produce the film based on his consultant&#x27;s credit on &quot;Bonnie &amp; Clyde&quot; but had difficulty getting it made because of the studio&#x27;s concern about the bad language in Towne&#x27;s script. Peter Guber recalled, &quot;The first seven minutes, there were 342 &#x27;fucks&#x27;&quot;. The head of Columbia asked Towne to reduce the number of curse words to which the writer responded, &quot;This is the way people talk when they&#x27;re powerless to act; they bitch&quot;. Towne refused to tone down the language and the project remained in limbo until Nicholson, by then a bankable star, got involved.

Ayres sent the script to Robert Altman and then Hal Ashby. Ayres remembers, &quot;I thought that this was a picture that required a skewed perspective, and that&#x27;s what Hal had&quot;. Ashby was coming off the disappointing commercial and critical failure of &quot;Harold and Maude&quot; and was in pre-production on &quot;Three Cornered Circle&quot; at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer when Jack Nicholson told him about &quot;The Last Detail&quot;, his upcoming film at Columbia. The director had been sent the script in the fall of 1971, with a reader&#x27;s report calling it &quot;lengthy and unimaginative&quot;, but he personally found it very appealing.

He wanted to do it but it conflicted with his schedule for &quot;Three Cornered Circle&quot;. Ashby pulled out of his deal with MGM, and Nicholson suggested that they team up on &quot;Last Detail&quot;. Columbia did not like Ashby because he had a reputation of distrusting authority and made little effort to communicate with executives. The $2.3 million budget was low enough for him to get approved.

===Casting===
Nicholson was set to play Buddusky; additional casting focused mainly on the roles of Mule and Meadows. Bud Cort met with Ashby and begged to play Meadows, but the director felt that he was not right for the role. Robert Englund also auditioned for the role of Meadows. Casting director Lynn Stalmaster gave Ashby a final selection of actors, and the two that stood out were Randy Quaid and John Travolta. As originally written, the character of Meadows was a &quot;helpless little guy&quot;, but Ashby wanted to cast Quaid, who was 6&#x27;4&quot;. He had offbeat and vulnerable qualities that Ashby wanted. Towne remembers thinking, &quot;There&#x27;s a real poignancy to this huge guy&#x27;s helplessness that&#x27;s great. I thought it was a fantastic choice, and I&#x27;d never thought of it.&quot; Rupert Crosse was cast as Mule. Gilda Radner was cast in her first screen role, speaking one line as a member of Nichiren Shoshu. Director Hal Ashby also appears in a brief cameo in the New York bar scene as the bearded man observing Buddusky&#x27;s dart game.

===Pre-production===
The project stalled for 18 months while Nicholson made &quot;The King of Marvin Gardens&quot;. Guber told Ayres that he could get Burt Reynolds, Jim Brown, and David Cassidy and a new writer, and he would approve production immediately. Ayres rejected this proposal, and the studio agreed to wait because they were afraid that the producer would take the film to another studio. Ashby and Ayres read navy publications and interviewed current and ex-servicemen who helped them correct minor errors in the script. The director wanted to shoot on location at the naval base in Norfolk, Virginia, and the brig at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, but was unable to get permission from the United States Navy. However, the Canadian Navy was willing to cooperate and in mid-August 1972, Ashby and his casting director Stalmaster traveled to Toronto, Ontario to look at a naval base and meet with actors. The base suited their needs and Ashby met Carol Kane, whom he would cast in a small role. Opening scenes of the film were not shot at a Canadian Naval Base, but rather at CFB Borden, a major training base for the Canadian Air Force &amp; Army.

Ashby was busted for possession of marijuana while scouting locations in Canada. This almost changed the studio&#x27;s mind about backing the project, but the director&#x27;s drug bust was not widely reported and Nicholson remained fiercely loyal to him, which was a deciding factor. Just as the film was about to go into production, Crosse was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Ashby postponed principal photography for a week to allow Crosse to deal with the news and decide if he still wanted to do the film. The actor decided not to do the film, and Ashby and Stalmaster scrambled to find a replacement. They cast Otis Young.

===Principal photography===
Ashby decided to shoot the film chronologically in order to help the inexperienced Quaid and recently cast Young ease into their characters. With the exception of Toronto doubling as Norfolk, the production shot on location, making the same journey as the three main characters. Early on, Quaid was very nervous and wanted to make a good impression. Ashby kept a close eye on the actor but allowed him to develop into the role. Haskell Wexler was supposed to shoot &quot;The Last Detail&quot;, but he could not get a union card for an East Coast production. Ashby asked Nestor Almendros and Gordon Willis but they were both unavailable.

The script originally called for the three sailors to cavort on the steps of the Supreme Court. But Chief Justice Warren E. Burger denied permission, reportedly in retaliation for Nicholson&#x27;s public criticism of Richard Nixon, who appointed Burger to his position.

Ashby promoted Michael Chapman, his camera operator on &quot;The Landlord&quot;, to director of photography. They worked together to create a specific look for the film that involved using natural light to create a realistic, documentary style. Ashby let Nicholson look through the camera&#x27;s viewfinder as a shot was being set up so he knew the parameters of a given scene and how much freedom he had within the frame. The actor said, &quot;Hal is the first director to let me go, to let me find my own level&quot;.

===Post-production===
The day after principal photography was completed, Ashby had his editor send what he had cut together so far. Ashby was shocked at the results and fired the editor, becoming afraid he would have to edit the film himself. Ayres recommended bringing in Robert C. Jones, one of the fastest editors in the business, who had been nominated for an Academy Award for &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot;. Jones put the film back into rushes and six weeks later had a first cut ready that ran four hours. Ashby was very impressed with his abilities and trusted him completely. Jones cut the film with Ashby at the filmmaker&#x27;s home. The process took an unusually long time, as the director agonized over all the footage he had shot. Ashby would ignore phone calls from Columbia, and eventually executives higher and higher up the corporate ladder tried to contact him. Ashby was in London, meeting with Peter Sellers about doing &quot;Being There&quot; when he received a phone call from Jones, who told him that Columbia was fed up with the time it was taking for the film to be assembled. The head of the studio&#x27;s editing department called Jones to say that a representative was coming to take the film. Jones refused to give up the film, and Ashby called the studio and managed to calm down the officials. Towne occasionally visited Ashby&#x27;s house to check in and did not like the pacing of the film. According to Towne, Ashby &quot;left his dramatizing to the editing room, and the effect was a thinning out of the script&quot;. During the editing process, Columbia hated the jump cuts Ashby employed. The studio was also concerned about the number of expletives. It needed a commercial hit as they were in major financial trouble. By August 1973, the final cut of &quot;The Last Detail&quot; was completed and submitted to the MPAA, which gave it an R rating.

Columbia was still not happy with the film and asked for 26 lines to be cut that had the word &quot;fuck&quot; in them. The theatrical release of &quot;The Last Detail&quot; was delayed for six months while Columbia fought over the profanity issue. The film contained 65 uses of &quot;fuck&quot; overall and at the time of its release, broke the record for most uses of the word in a motion picture. Ashby persuaded Columbia to let him preview the film to see how the public would react. It was shown in San Francisco, and the screening was a huge success.

==Release==
===Box office===
Ayres persuaded Columbia to submit &quot;The Last Detail&quot; to the Cannes Film Festival. After Nicholson won Best Actor there, the studio finally gave the film a theatrical release. The film opened at the Bruin Theater in Westwood, Los Angeles for a special 11-day Academy Award qualifying engagement where it grossed $46,369. A wide release was planned for the spring of 1974. The film was not a box office success, despite Oscar nominations for Nicholson, Quaid, and Towne by the time of the wide opening. The film would go on to earn $5 million in rentals at the North American box office.

===Home media===
It was initially released on VHS and Betamax videocassettes, and Laserdisc and Capacitance Electronic Disc (CED) Videodiscs, then later on DVD. Sony Pictures released &quot;The Last Detail&quot; on DVD in the United States on December 14, 1999. It was first made available on Blu-ray disc as a limited edition by boutique label Twilight Time in the United States on January 19, 2016 with two special features, an isolated score track and a theatrical trailer. The film was released in the UK by Powerhouse Films initially as a limited dual format edition set on February 27, 2017. Supplemental features include two cuts of the movie, original trailer; promotional materials; new interview with director of photography Michael Chapman; and a booklet.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The film received very positive reviews. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby said Nicholson&#x27;s performance was &quot;by far the best thing he&#x27;s ever done&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; magazine also praised Nicholson, saying he was &quot;outstanding at the head of a superb cast&quot;. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film four stars out of four, writing that Nicholson &quot;continues his impressive string of performances&quot; and that the screenplay &quot;is both funny and wise. It captures all the silliness, stupidity, and veiled warmth of men in groups.&quot; He ranked it second (behind &quot;Day for Night&quot;) on his list of the best films of the year. Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;a superior piece of film-making whose superlative acting, corrosive joking and dead-accurate feeling for time and milieu may well transcend its messages of hopelessness and innocence lost. But it is a downer, ferociously so.&quot;

In contrast, Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote in a generally negative review that &quot;it&#x27;s conceivable that this trim, foreshortened adaptation would have worked, if only the direction had been sharper. Unfortunately, Ashby has directed as if he were a novice, unsure of camera placement and lighting and undecided about what pace the story needs and what feelings it should evoke.&quot;
Andrew Sarris, however, praised Ashby&#x27;s &quot;sensitive, precise direction&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Richard Schickel wrote: &quot;There is an unpretentious realism in Towne&#x27;s script, and director Ashby handles his camera with a simplicity reminiscent of the way American directors treated lower-depths material in the &#x27;30s&quot;.

It was shown as part of the Cannes Classics section of the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. Paul Tatara largely credited Towne&#x27;s &quot;profane, heartbreaking script&quot; for the film&#x27;s &quot;small details, colorful language, and utterly believable character development, which cumulatively pack a real emotional wallop.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
&quot;The Last Detail&quot; was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival and Nicholson was awarded Best Actor. It was also nominated for three Academy Awards – Jack Nicholson for Best Actor, Randy Quaid for Best Supporting Actor, and Robert Towne for Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, with none of them winning. In addition, &quot;The Last Detail&quot; was nominated for two Golden Globes Awards – Nicholson for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama and Quaid for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture. Nicholson also won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role in the film. Nicholson won the Best Actor awards from the National Society of Film Critics and the New York Film Critics Circle. However, he was disappointed that he failed to win an Oscar for his performance. &quot;I like the idea of winning at Cannes with &quot;The Last Detail&quot;, but not getting our own Academy Award hurt real bad. I did it in that movie, that was my best role&quot;.

==Unofficial sequel==

In 2006, filmmaker Richard Linklater expressed an interest in adapting &quot;Last Flag Flying&quot;, a sequel to &quot;The Last Detail&quot;, into a film. In the novel, Buddusky runs a bar and is reunited with Larry Meadows after his son is killed in the Iraq War. Linklater&#x27;s adaptation, which he co-wrote with Ponicsan, was released in November 2017 and stars Bryan Cranston, Laurence Fishburne, and Steve Carell.

<doc id="163458" wikidata="Q1546341" url="?curid=163458" title="Silk Stalkings">
<text>Silk Stalkings is an American crime drama television series that premiered on CBS on November 7, 1991, as part of the network&#x27;s late-night &quot;Crimetime After Primetime&quot; programming package. Broadcast for two seasons until CBS ended the &quot;Crimetime&quot; experiment in June 1993, the remaining six seasons ran exclusively on USA Network until the series finale on April 18, 1999. The show was creator Stephen J. Cannell&#x27;s longest-running series. Its title is a wordplay on &quot;silk stockings&quot;.

The series portrays the daily lives of two detectives who solve sexually-based crimes of passion (&quot;silk stalkings&quot;) among the ultra-rich of Palm Beach, Florida. Most episodes were shot in San Diego, California, while some were filmed in Scottsdale, Arizona.

==Synopsis==
===Chris and Rita===
From 1991 to 1995, the lead characters were played by Rob Estes and Mitzi Kapture, as detectives Christopher Lorenzo and Rita Lee Lance, respectively. The story lines were told in a partially first-person perspective focusing on Lance, who would speak in voiceovers throughout the episodes. Early in the series, Ben Vereen played Rita&#x27;s boss, Captain Hutchinson (&quot;Hutch&quot;). Vereen was compelled to retire from the show during the second season due to an off-screen accident, but he returned for a few guest appearances. His successor was Lt. Hudson, played by Robert Gossett, who stayed on until the third season. Chris and Rita&#x27;s new boss, who would stay with the show for its duration, was Charlie Brill as Captain Harry Lipschitz. Brill went on to appear in the most episodes of any actor, 129, ahead of Kapture&#x27;s 101 and Estes&#x27; 100. He was promoted to the opening credits starting with season six (none of the previous captains in the series had achieved this).

Brill&#x27;s real-life wife Mitzi McCall played Lipschitz&#x27;s free-spirited wife Frannie on the series, and the two provided some occasional comic relief amid the dramatic tension of the story lines. They also appeared in the second season playing completely different characters. Working prominently with Lorenzo and Lance was assistant district attorney George Donovan (William Anton). Various recurring characters came and went, notably Dennis Paladino as mob boss Donnie &quot;Dogs&quot; DiBarto (DiBelco in his first appearance); John Byner as Cotton Dunn, a cunning but likable con artist; Scott Atkins as Officer Perry, a rookie cop; Kim Morgan Greene as Melissa Cassidy, a late-night radio talk-show host, sex therapist, and old flame of Chris&#x27;s; Danny Gans as Roger, a coroner who frequently (and unsuccessfully) tried to get Rita to go out with him; Marie Marshall as Solange, a local photographer with a faux French accent who crossed paths with Chris and Rita in the second season; and Lucy Lin, who played forensic expert Dr. Noriko Weinstein. Actress Freda Foh Shen took over Lin&#x27;s role in later episodes. In the first season, Rita was shown to suffer from occasionally intense headaches, which were caused by a blood bubble in her brain. Rita opted not to have surgery to fix this because it was deemed too high-risk. However, as the series went on, this condition was gradually phased out of the plot and was never mentioned again. In the second episode of the first season, &quot;Going to Babylon&quot;, it was revealed that Rita&#x27;s real name is Rita Lee Fontana. Her father, Donald was a wealthy businessman who lost his fortune in a series of bad business dealings involving a corrupt fellow businessman when she was six years old. Donald fell into a state of severe depression and alcoholism which eventually culminated in him committing suicide. Rita was adopted by Don and Sue Lance and she took their name in gratitude for the kindness and love they showed her growing up. Rita and Chris would go on to arrest the man responsible for her father&#x27;s bankruptcy in that same episode.

Estes and Kapture were equal co-stars. The opening credits alternated, one week showing Estes first and then Kapture, the following week showing Kapture first and then Estes. The opening montage of quick cuts had &quot;teasers&quot; that suggested the sexy and violent subject matter of the show, but were not taken from any of the show&#x27;s actual episodes. According to Stephen Cannell, in a DVD extra, they were developed initially as a promotion, filmed and assembled by Ralph Hemecker in a single day of filming, and featuring a leggy blonde actress/model whom Cannell said was named Avalon Jones. In the first two episodes of the series, Kapture was shown first, and then Estes; they alternated after that, except for Kapture&#x27;s final episode, in which she (and not Estes) appeared in the opening montage, followed by the two new co-stars.

Two off-screen events in the summer of 1995 were pivotal to the show and were worked into the story line. Both actors were ready to leave the series, Estes to pursue other acting opportunities and Kapture to take time off for her first child.

Estes had first flirted with departure at the end of the third season (spring of 1994). The season ended in a cliffhanger episode, &quot;Dark Heart&quot;, with Chris being shot by an obsessed woman, played by Crystal Chappell. Chris was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance as the closing credits rolled. After negotiations, Estes decided to renew his contract, and the fourth season (fall 1994) began with Chris&#x27; recovery from his near-fatal wounds in a two-part episode, &quot;Natural Selection&quot;, that was later released on VHS as a two-hour film.

In the fifth season (fall 1995), Chris and Rita&#x27;s mutual attraction finally moved from friendship to love in a two-part episode in November, called &quot;Partners&quot;. Nick Kokotakis, as detective Michael Price, was introduced during that episode. Rita, who was promoted to lieutenant, was soon confirmed to be pregnant (as was Kapture in real life), and Chris and Rita were married in an early December episode titled &quot;Till Death Do Us Part&quot;. The next week&#x27;s episode, &quot;The Last Kiss Goodnight&quot;, ended with Chris being shot and killed in the line of duty.

Kapture appeared in one more episode, &quot;Dead Asleep&quot;. This episode&#x27;s credits featured Kapture but not Estes (for the only time in the series), as well as Kokotakis and Tyler Layton, who was introduced in the previous episode as Chris&#x27;s new partner, detective Holly Rawlins. Most of the episode, which began with Rita, Harry and Frannie Lipschitz, Price, Rawlins, and Donovan at Chris&#x27; burial, was spent focusing on Michael and Holly&#x27;s first case. At the end of the show, the grief-stricken Rita spends one final scene talking to Chris at his gravesite and saying goodbye to Lipschitz, and leaves the force for parts unknown.

===Tom and Cassy===
With Estes and Kapture gone from the show, Kokotakis and Layton took over the lead roles. Fans of the show did not embrace the new characters, and they were replaced after that half-season by Chris Potter and Janet Gunn. Gunn, who starred in the Crimetime After Primetime series &quot;Dark Justice&quot; as Kelly Cochrane in 1992 and &#x27;93, previously played a secretary arrested for murder in season 3.

Unlike the transition that was played out between Chris and Rita and Michael and Holly, no on-screen explanation was given for Michael and Holly&#x27;s departure, and fans of the series sometimes refer to them as the &quot;lost cast&quot;. ADA George Donovan was also written out of the series at the end of season five, leaving Harry and Frannie Lipschitz as the lone holdovers from the Lance and Lorenzo episodes.

The detectives moved into an upgraded precinct in season seven.

The romantic chemistry between Potter and Gunn&#x27;s characters, Tom Ryan and Cassandra St. John, respectively (who, according to the story line, had been married to and divorced from one another before their arrival on the series), revived interest in the show and it rebounded in the ratings. After three additional seasons, USA cancelled the series in 1999. The final episode of the final season, in spring 1999, placing Tom&#x27;s career and relationship with Cassy on the rocks, was a cliffhanger with no resolution.

<doc id="163459" wikidata="Q657079" url="?curid=163459" title="Serpico">
<text>Serpico is a 1973 American biographical crime drama film directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Al Pacino in the title role. The screenplay was adapted by Waldo Salt and Norman Wexler from the book written by Peter Maas, with the assistance of its subject Frank Serpico. The story details Serpico&#x27;s struggle with corruption within the New York City Police Department during his eleven years of service, and his work as a whistleblower that led to the investigation by the Knapp Commission.

Producer Dino De Laurentiis purchased the rights from Maas. Agent Martin Bregman joined the film as co-producer. Bregman suggested Pacino for the main part, and John G. Avildsen was hired to direct the film. Pacino met with Serpico to prepare for the role early in the summer of 1973. After Avildsen was dismissed, Lumet was hired as his replacement. On a short notice, he selected the shooting locations and organized the scenes; the production was filmed in July and August.

On its release, &quot;Serpico&quot; became a critical and commercial success. At the same time, the film drew criticism from police officers. It received nominations at the Academy Awards and BAFTA Awards. Pacino earned the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, while Salt and Wexler received the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

== Plot ==
NYPD Officer Frank Serpico is rushed to the hospital, having been shot in the face. Chief Sidney Green fears that Serpico was shot by another cop. So Serpico&#x27;s story is shown in a flashback.

Serpico graduates from the police academy with big ideas for improving the police force&#x27;s community relations. He dresses like an actual civilian instead of wearing the department&#x27;s standard plainclothes dress, which is easily recognizable. While he is chasing a burglar, other officers fail to recognize him as one of their own and shoot at him. He realizes that deviating from protocols can be dangerous.

Serpico reports an attempted bribe to a high-ranking investigator, who chuckles and advises him to keep the money. Serpico soon learns that corruption is rampant in his police department. Forced to accompany officers as they collect payoffs from criminals and small businesses, Serpico refuses to accept his share of the money. He makes several attempts to alert superiors to the corruption but is rebuffed every time. Other officers learn that he is reporting them, and he begins to fear for his life.

Serpico and his well-connected friend Blair go to the mayor&#x27;s assistant, who promises a real investigation and support but is stymied by political pressure. Ostracized, frustrated and fearful, Serpico sinks into depression, which ruins his relationship with his girlfriend. He begins brutalizing well-connected suspects who had been bribing other officers and thought themselves protected. Finally, Serpico informs Captain McClain that he has reported his experiences to oversight agencies outside the police force. Furious, McClain tells the other officers.

Blair uses his connections to arrange a personal interview with the district attorney, who tells Serpico that if he testifies to a grand jury, a major investigation will follow. The DA limits his questions and prevents Serpico from revealing the ubiquity of corruption in the police force. Serpico and Blair take their story to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. After his allegations are printed, his superiors retaliate by assigning him to a dangerous narcotics squad in Brooklyn.

During a raid on a drug trafficker&#x27;s apartment, Serpico&#x27;s partners hold back at a critical moment, and Serpico gets shot in the face. After a long, painful recovery, he testifies before the Knapp Commission, a government inquiry into NYPD corruption.

Frank Serpico resigned from the NYPD on June 15, 1972, was awarded the NYPD Medal of Honor for &quot;conspicuous bravery in action&quot;, and moved to Switzerland.

== Cast ==
In addition, F. Murray Abraham appears in an uncredited role as the team lead of Serpico&#x27;s four-man unit, setting up Serpico to be shot in the face at a drug bust. Judd Hirsch appears as one of the cops in the hospital, also uncredited.

==Background ==
After Frank Serpico recovered from being shot, he helped Peter Maas write &quot;Serpico&quot;. Detective David Durk, who also appeared in front of the Knapp Commission, planned to sell the rights of their story for a film adaptation. Early negotiations included Paul Newman in the role of Durk, and Robert Redford as Serpico. Serpico distanced himself from the project, as he felt that he would be merely portrayed as a sidekick. Script writer John Gregory Dunne turned down the project, for he felt that &quot;there was no story&quot;. Director Sam Peckinpah, as well as Newman and Redford, left the project.

After the success of several of his films in the 1960s, and the first years of the 1970s, producer Dino De Laurentiis decided to move from Italy to the United States. The change in financing laws further regulated the Italian film industry, and the producer settled in New York City. Following their collaboration on &quot;The Valachi Papers&quot;, De Laurentiis purchased the rights to Maas&#x27;s book. Maas received US$400,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) and participation in the film, while the rights for his work were secured before the March 1973 publication of the book. Initially, De Laurentiis found resistance to the project from Paramount Pictures. The studio considered that &quot;enough cop movies&quot; had been made. In turn, De Laurentiis was supported by Charles Bluhdorn, president of Gulf+Western, who wanted the film to be made. De Laurentiis later declared that &quot;no American producer would have had the courage&quot; to depict police corruption in a motion picture.

Maas&#x27;s agent Sam Cohn was approached by agent Martin Bregman. Bregman expressed his interest to produce the film after reading an article in &quot;New York&quot; magazine about the book. Bregman proposed one of his signed actors, Al Pacino, to play the lead. Waldo Salt was chosen to write the screenplay adaptation. The first draft did not impress Maas, De Laurentiis nor Bregman. Bregman felt that the result was &quot;very political&quot;, and that the story did not reflect what the producers desired to portray in the film. Bregman and Maas directed Salt to the parts of the book that they envisioned to be reflected on the screenplay. The second draft was considered to be a substantial improvement by the production team. Bregman took the treatment to Pacino, who initially did not find the film interesting. Salt visited Pacino with the re-worked script that convinced him to consider the part. A meeting with Serpico, Maas and Pacino was arranged for the actor to meet the subject of the film. After meeting him, Pacino was fully convinced to accept the part. John G. Avildsen was chosen to direct the film.
Salt&#x27;s work did not satisfy Avildsen, who threatened to leave the project unless he could bring Norman Wexler to write the screenplay. They had previously worked together in Avildsen&#x27;s &quot;Joe&quot;. Both traveled to Switzerland to visit Serpico at home and work the details. Time to work on the production was constricted due to Pacino&#x27;s commitment to &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;. Further disagreement arose between Avildsen and Bregman regarding the script and the selection of the filming locations. In response to resistance to his plans, Avildsen threatened Bregman of quitting multiple times. An aggravated Bregman called for a meeting with the production team to cause the director to quit in front of witnesses.

Avildsen had insisted on a meeting with Bregman and De Laurentiis to shoot a scene in the real home of Serpico&#x27;s parents for authenticity. The producers felt that the structure could not accommodate the production team and equipment efficiently. The escalating tension on the meeting resulted in De Laurentiis firing Avildsen, and the director quit in return. Avildsen&#x27;s account for the reason of his dismissal was that he refused to cast Bregman&#x27;s then-girlfriend (and later wife) Cornelia Sharpe as Leslie. Avildsen would later declare that he should have treated the situation &quot;with more finesse&quot;. Sidney Lumet was hired to complete the job for his reputation as an effective director under a tight schedule.

Pacino was shortly distracted from the project by an offer to play the lead in &quot;Lenny&quot;, but ultimately he turned it down. To prepare for &quot;Serpico&quot;, he rode with police officers for a night, but he decided that it was not enough. A method actor, he felt that he needed to spend time with Serpico. Pacino and Serpico met several times in Montauk, New York, where the actor rented a house for the summer. Pacino was moved by Serpico&#x27;s conviction to reform the NYPD, and became more committed to the project. In character, Pacino often walked through areas of the city that were considered dangerous at the time. While waiting in traffic, he attempted to arrest a truck driver, for he was enraged by the exhaust fumes. He was refused service at a Manhattan restaurant for the appearance that he kept for the film.

==Production==
Sidney Lumet organized the 107 speaking parts that took place in 104 different locations. The longest scenes took up two-and-a-half pages of the screenplay, while the average was one page.

A budget of $3.3 million (equivalent to $ million in ) was assigned. Two weeks of rehearsals were held. Pacino had learned Salt&#x27;s screenplay, and he agreed with Lumet that Wexler&#x27;s revised version improved the structure, but that the dialogue was impoverished. Lumet allowed the actors to improvise certain dialogues, and he also allowed their creative input for the scenes. The cast selected dialogues from both scripts as the filming progressed. Although he already had a good knowledge of New York locations, Lumet considered the work &quot;physically brutal, and emotionally tough&quot;.

The principal photography on &quot;Serpico&quot; began in early July 1973. The film was planned to be released before Christmas, with four-and-a-half months for the crew to complete the movie. Filming took place in July and August. The story of the film encompassed 11 years, from 1960 through 1971.
To accommodate the scenes around Pacino&#x27;s facial hair, the film was shot in reverse. Pacino started with long beard and hair. He was shaved to a mustache, and eventually, his hair was cut and he was clean-shaven for the beginning of the film. Lumet decided each day if Pacino was to be further shaven, and the crew prepared fake beards in case they were required. Winter conditions were simulated, as the team had to defoliate trees and cut shrubs. Special makeup was used to absorb the sweat, and to keep the actors&#x27; skin dry. The cast wore winter coats, and their skin was made to look bluish, while their breath had to be visible.

The director followed Serpico&#x27;s desire for the winter to look &quot;cold and heavy&quot;, and the summer &quot;idyllic and hazy&quot;. The team had difficulty to find locations suitable for the scenes set in the 1960s, since graffiti did not become common until 1970. Lumet shot up to 35 different setups daily. The team had to move three times a day on average. Each location had to be cleared of cars that did not belong to the particular period, and extras could not feature long hair nor non-period wardrobe. Hairdressers were present with the crew. Multiple locations in the city including Harlem, the South Bronx, Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn and Astoria, Queens, were used. Lewisohn Stadium was featured shortly before its demolition. The party scene was shot at Sidney Kingsley&#x27;s Fifth Avenue loft. The NYPD cooperated with the director and allowed him to film in four active police stations.

Serpico&#x27;s apartment had to be built by the crew. It featured a fixed ceiling and movable walls. As with Serpico&#x27;s original apartment, it was located in Greenwich Village. Through lighting, Lumet and cinematographer Arthur Ornitz chose to maintain a &quot;warm look&quot; on the location. Different techniques were used to reflect moods, and the changes of the years through which the character went.

Lumet focused on portraying Serpico&#x27;s struggle to balance his work and personal life, and his increased isolation and alienation, as his efforts produced slow results. The director decided to portray him &quot;darker and darker&quot;. As the film progressed, the cast costumes became darker in color, until the courtroom scene in which all the actors wore dark tones. Lumet told Charles Champlin, &quot;I was trying to negate color, to make a picture in color that was not colorful.&quot; Meanwhile, he wanted Serpico&#x27;s fellow officers to be &quot;men with charm, who were all the more evil for being human and understandable&quot;. Lumet finished shooting the film in 51 days, on budget.

The film is edited by Dede Allen. Allen received the scenes from Lumet directly after they were shot. She had a limit of 48 hours to finish her work for its delivery to the sound department. Lumet did not want to add a score to the picture, but he decided that he would do it before De Laurentiis commissioned one. He learned that Mikis Theodorakis was released from prison in Greece. He was able to locate him in Paris, as the composer quickly left his country of origin. Theodorakis accepted Lumet&#x27;s offer, and flew to New York City the next day. He met with the director, who played the movie for him the day of his arrival. Theodorakis agreed that it should not have a soundtrack, but he offered a composition of his to add to the film. Theodorakis had arranged a tour of the United States with a Greek orchestra and told Lumet that he could not be present for the spotting session. Lumet offered the help of Bob James, who would sit with the director for the spotting. To inform of the progress of the sessions and possible changes on the arrangements, James flew to the cities where Theodorakis appeared to work the details.

==Release==
The film was released on December 5, 1973, in New York and on December 18 in Los Angeles. The opening week in New York garnered $123,000. &quot;Serpico&quot; was released nationwide on February 6, 1974. The film was a critical and commercial success. It grossed $29.8 million in the United States and Canada, generating $14.6 million in theatrical rentals. It earned theatrical rentals worldwide of $23.4 million.

Serpico attended the premiere of the film, but he did not finish watching it. Serpico felt &quot;distant&quot; from the results. In an interview with Pauline Kael for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, he concluded that it &quot;didn&#x27;t give a sense of the frustration you feel when you&#x27;re not able to do anything&quot;.

According to Lumet&#x27;s account, he met Serpico shortly before the production. The director asked him to stay clear of the set, to not make Pacino &quot;self-conscious&quot; regarding his portrayal. Serpico watched the film in its entirety for the first time in 2010. In a later interview, he declared that Lumet barred him from the set after he interrupted the shooting of a scene that in real life &quot;never happened&quot;. Serpico also criticized the dismissal of Avildsen by the production team. Serpico and Avildsen remained friends, and shared a property on Long Island for three years in the 1980s.

New York City Police Commissioner Michael Codd stated that the film &quot;tends to imply that Serpico was the only honest cop in the whole department&quot;. Detective Durk was not pleased with &quot;Serpico&quot;. Durk, who was depicted in the character of Bob Blair, felt that the movie would deter other policemen to denounce corruption. In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he considered the movie to be unfair to honest police officers. Durk stated that the end of the film conveyed that &quot;the cost of honesty is martyrdom&quot;, and Serpico&#x27;s departure for Switzerland showed him &quot;wounded and frustrated&quot;.

Meanwhile, Bronx district attorney Burton B. Roberts declared that it &quot;bears absolutely no relationship to the truth&quot;. Lumet defended his artistic license on the portrayal of the story, as he felt he desired to make a film that &quot;people believed in&quot;. Bregman dismissed the critics, as he felt that the real names were not relevant for viewers in cities outside New York. Maas dismissed Durk&#x27;s claims regarding honest policemen and asked, &quot;Where were they?&quot;

==Critical reception==
===Premiere reception===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that the film was &quot;galvanizing&quot; for Pacino&#x27;s performance and the &quot;tremendous intensity&quot; of Lumet&#x27;s direction. The publication also considered the film &quot;disquieting&quot; for its use of fictional names, as the reviewer felt that it diminished the role of Durk. Meanwhile, it called Theodorakis&#x27;s soundtrack &quot;redundant and dumb&quot;.

The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; delivered a favorable review of the film. It rated it four stars out of five, and called it &quot;a triumph of intelligence, compassion and style&quot;. A follow-up critique by the publication deemed Pacino&#x27;s acting a &quot;masterful performance&quot;, as the reviewer remarked that &quot;he walks like a cop. He talks like a cop. He even seems to think as a cop.&quot; The review also praised Lumet and his &quot;talent for achieving social realism&quot;.

&quot;The Record&quot; considered it &quot;one of the finest films of the year&quot;. Although it felt that the portrayal of Serpico was &quot;too righteous and obsessive&quot;, the review favored Pacino, but felt that his performance was &quot;sometimes a little too intense&quot;. It praised the photography of New York City as authentic, and credited Ornitz and Allen&#x27;s work for it.

&quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote a mixed review. It criticized the focus of the film on Serpico, and the minor role that the screenplay writers gave to the character that represented Durk. The reviewer considered that Serpico was &quot;worth seeing&quot; for Pacino&#x27;s performance.

&quot;Variety&quot; deemed Pacino&#x27;s acting &quot;outstanding&quot;, and Lumet&#x27;s a combination of &quot;gritty action and thought-provoking comment&quot;.

For &quot;Newhouse News Services&quot;, it was an &quot;exciting movie&quot;, but the review remarked that it was &quot;weakened&quot; by its focus on Serpico. The news agency attributed the minimization of the other characters to avoid &quot;possible lawsuits&quot;.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; acclaimed &quot;Serpico&quot;. Charles Champlin called Pacino &quot;one of the handful of genuine star actors in American films&quot;. Salt and Wexler&#x27;s screenplay was hailed as &quot;almost documentary reality&quot;, and its treatment of the main character &quot;a complex and evolving portrait&quot;. The reviewer also remarked that the romances and break-ups were presented with &quot;unhackneyed honesty&quot;. The contributions of the supporting cast were well noted. Champlin felt that Allen&#x27;s work was considered to be &quot;high on the list&quot; for an Academy Award nomination, and deemed Theodorakis&#x27;s music &quot;effective&quot;.

===Wide release reception===
Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, noting its treatment of corruption as its &quot;principal strength and weakness&quot;, and adding that &quot;Serpico&quot; &quot;loses the perspective&quot; that &quot;corruption ... begins and ends with individuals making active and passive decisions&quot;.

&quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; celebrated the film&#x27;s critique of police corruption, despite its &quot;embellishments and omissions&quot; on the story. Pacino&#x27;s performance was called &quot;riveting&quot;, and the piece praised the &quot;sharply individualized characterizations&quot; by Tony Roberts, Jack Kehoe, John Randolph, Biff McGuire, Barbara Eda-Young and Cornelia Sharpe.

Meanwhile, also for &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, investigative journalist Greg Walter lamented its portrayal of police officers as &quot;snarling, insipid ass(es)&quot;. Walter felt that Maas&#x27;s book was &quot;coldly objective&quot;, but that the director&#x27;s work delivered characters that were &quot;one-dimensional caricatures&quot;.

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; welcomed Lumet&#x27;s &quot;melodramatic efficiency&quot;. The publication considered the story &quot;heavily repetitious&quot;, but favored its &quot;quick pace&quot;. It regarded Ornitz&#x27;s camerawork as &quot;the right documentary look&quot;, while it lamented Theodorakis&#x27;s score as &quot;disruptive&quot; and &quot;out of character&quot;.

&quot;Esquire&quot; further criticized Theodorakis, as the reviewer opined that his &quot;composing voice ought to be silenced&quot;. Meanwhile, the piece praised Allen&#x27;s work.
The &quot;Miami Herald&quot; hailed the use of &quot;street talk&quot; instead of the &quot;language of actors and actresses&quot; by Salt, Wexler and Maas. It praised Lumet and Ornitz&#x27;s photography that &quot;generate the smells, sounds and styles of the city&quot;. It considered Pacino&#x27;s acting &quot;predictably excellent&quot;, and it favored Theodorakis&#x27;s music.

The &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; suggested that &quot;Serpico&quot; would be a breakthrough role for Pacino as an actor, and called his work &quot;fascinating&quot;. The newspaper defined the film as an &quot;encouraging morality tale&quot;.

Meanwhile, &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; observed Pacino&#x27;s acting to be &quot;a brilliant, solidly thought out performance&quot;. The publication added that the supporting cast&#x27;s contributions &quot;never satisfactorily fleshed out&quot;. Regarding Lumet, the reviewer felt that he directed the film with &quot;skill and vigor&quot;.

&quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; attributed the commercial success of the film to Pacino&#x27;s acting, and to the film&#x27;s depiction of &quot;hard, cold, grit and grime reality&quot;.

For &quot;The Evening Sun&quot; reviewer, Lou Cedrone expressed his doubts about Durk&#x27;s &quot;gratis talk of defamation of the police image&quot;. Cedrone considered that Durk &quot;comes off very nicely&quot; on the film, and defended Lumet&#x27;s choice to &quot;emphasize the action rather than the definition&quot;. Meanwhile, it viewed the use of &quot;Neapolitan&quot; music as &quot;foolish perhaps, but not touching&quot;. It declared Pacino&#x27;s contribution &quot;a magnificent performance&quot;.

The &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; found &quot;Serpico&quot; to be &quot;meticulously crafted, intelligently written, unflinchingly honest&quot;. The publication noted the &quot;fidelity&quot; with which the director captured New York, and that the city &quot;becomes more than just a background&quot;. It summed Pacino&#x27;s acting as &quot;naturalistic, flawlessly convincing&quot;.

&quot;The&quot; &quot;Honolulu Advertiser&quot; attributed Pacino&#x27;s &quot;brilliant portrayal&quot; to turn an &quot;ordinary cop movie&quot; into &quot;extraordinary&quot;. The review favored Lumet, the writers and the supporting cast.

The &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot; highlighted realism in producing a &quot;fascinating film&quot;.

The &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; celebrated Pacino&#x27;s &quot;towering performance&quot;. Roberts&#x27;s performance was noted as a &quot;standout&quot;. Sharpe and Eda Young&#x27;s appearances as Serpico&#x27;s love interests were deemed to be &quot;played with restrained excellence&quot;. The newspaper opined that the film was &quot;15 minutes too long&quot;, but that viewers would not &quot;realize the length until you&#x27;re outside looking at your watch&quot;.

The &quot;Kansas City Star&quot; detailed the criticism that the film received from police officers, and Serpico&#x27;s discontent with the production. The piece noted that despite the fictional additions, &quot;Serpico&quot; was a &quot;superrealistic dramatization&quot;. Meanwhile, Wexler and Salt were praised for the authentic use of profanity in the dialogues.

&quot;The Times&quot; in Shreveport, Louisiana, opened its review applauding Serpico&#x27;s denunciation of police corruption, while it pointed out that the film &quot;exceeds (the) expectations&quot; of the viewers for it to be &quot;powerfully dramatic&quot;. Lumet&#x27;s &quot;accurate eye for surroundings&quot; was remarked, and the reviewer hailed Pacino and the supporting cast.

===Later reviews===
Rotten Tomatoes rated it 93% &quot;Fresh&quot;, with an average score of 8.1/10, based on reviews from 55 critics. The consensus reads: &quot;An engrossing, immediate depiction of early &#x27;70s New York, &quot;Serpico&quot; is elevated by Al Pacino&#x27;s ferocious performance.&quot; On the review aggregator Metacritic, the movie garnered a score of 87 out of 100, based on 7 reviews from mainstream critics. The result indicated &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

AllMovie gave &quot;Serpico&quot; five stars out of five. The review described the situation in the United States following the Watergate scandal, and how the &quot;bureaucratic depravity touched a cultural nerve&quot;. It welcomed the film&#x27;s &quot;documentary-style realism&quot;.

&quot;The A.V. Club&quot; received it positively; the reviewer felt that &quot;Serpico&quot; expressed &quot;artful, character-driven slices of life&quot;.

In its later review, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; declared that the &quot;Watergate-era time capsule of hippie fashions&quot; that the film presented &quot;ought to look pretty dated&quot;, but that the story &quot;feels depressingly relevant&quot;.

A 2023 article found that &quot;the movie, like the life of its hero, remains a clear public good&quot;. The article commented that a film about a cop facing impossible, potentially fatal, obstacles for simply doing his job on the level &quot;feels impossible in the Hollywood of today&quot;.

==Legacy==
On September 21, 1975, &quot;Serpico&quot; premiered on television on &quot;The ABC Sunday Night Movie&quot;.

It was released on VHS in 1991, and on DVD in 2002. The film was made available on Blu-ray in 2013. Masters of Cinema released &quot;Serpico&quot; in the United Kingdom on Blu-ray in 2014. It contains three video documentaries about the film, a photo gallery with an audio commentary by Lumet, and a forty-four page booklet.

A television series based on Maas&#x27;s book and the motion picture was broadcast on NBC between September 1976 and January 1977, with David Birney as Serpico. Fourteen episodes were broadcast, but the fifteenth was not aired. The series was preceded by the pilot film &quot;Serpico: The Deadly Game&quot;, which was broadcast in April 1976.

In a 2004 &quot;Corner Gas&quot; episode &quot;The Taxman&quot;, local cops Davis and Karen talk about the film, and Karen tries to rent it at the video store. In the 2007 episode of &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; &quot;Bums: Making a Mess All Over the City&quot;, Charlie imitates Pacino’s performance after the gang buys an out-of-commission police car. The film is referenced in a 2016 episode of &quot;El ministerio del tiempo&quot; as the reason for the nickname of one of its main characters, &quot;Pacino&quot;. Among other police films, &quot;Serpico&quot; influenced the Hong Kong action cinema.

<text>Arthur William Matthew Carney (November 4, 1918 – November 9, 2003) was an American actor and comedian. A recipient of an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and six Primetime Emmy Awards, he was best known for his role as Ed Norton on the sitcom &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; (1955–1956).

His film roles include &quot;Harry and Tonto&quot; (1974), &quot;The Late Show&quot; (1977), &quot;House Calls&quot; (1978), &quot;Going in Style&quot; (1979), &quot;Firestarter&quot;, &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; (both 1984), &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; (1993), and the &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot;.

==Early life==
Carney, the youngest of six sons (his brothers were Jack, Ned, Robert, Fred, and Phil), was born in Mount Vernon, New York, the son of Helen (née Farrell) and Edward Michael Carney, a newspaperman and publicist. His family was Irish American and Catholic. He attended A.B. Davis High School.

Carney was drafted into the United States Army in 1943 as an infantryman and machine gun crewman during World War II. During the Battle of Normandy serving in the 28th Infantry Division, he was wounded in the leg by shrapnel and walked with a limp for the rest of his life. As a result of the injury, his right leg was ¾-inch (2 cm) shorter than his left. Carney was awarded a Purple Heart, the American Campaign Medal, the European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal, and was discharged as a private in 1945.

==Career==
===Radio===
Carney was a comic singer with the Horace Heidt orchestra, which was heard often on radio during the 1930s, notably on the hugely successful &quot;Pot o&#x27; Gold&quot;, the first big-money giveaway show in 1939–1941. Carney&#x27;s film career began with an uncredited role in &quot;Pot o&#x27; Gold&quot; (1941), the radio program&#x27;s spin-off feature film, playing a member of Heidt&#x27;s band. Carney, a gifted mimic, worked steadily in radio during the 1940s, playing character roles and impersonating celebrities such as President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill. He can be seen impersonating Roosevelt in a 1937 promotional film for Stewart-Warner refrigerators that is preserved by the Library of Congress. as well as during a 1966 appearance as a Mystery Guest on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot;. In 1941, he was the house comic on the big band remote series &quot;Matinee at Meadowbrook&quot;.

One of his radio roles during the 1940s was the first Red Lantern on &quot;Land of the Lost&quot;. In 1943 he played Billy Oldham on &quot;Joe and Ethel Turp&quot;, based on Damon Runyon stories. He appeared on &quot;The Henry Morgan Show&quot; in 1946–47. He impersonated Roosevelt on &quot;The March of Time&quot; and Dwight D. Eisenhower on &quot;Living 1948&quot;. In 1950–51 he played Montague&#x27;s father on &quot;The Magnificent Montague&quot;. He was a supporting player on &quot;Casey, Crime Photographer&quot; and &quot;Gang Busters&quot;.
===Television===
On both the radio and television versions of &quot;The Morey Amsterdam Show&quot; (1948–50), Carney&#x27;s character Charlie the doorman became known for his catchphrase, &quot;Ya know what I mean?&quot;.

In 1950, Jackie Gleason was starring in the New York–based comedy-variety series &quot;Cavalcade of Stars&quot; and played many different characters. Gleason&#x27;s regular characters included Charlie Bratten, a lunchroom loudmouth who insisted on spoiling a neighboring patron&#x27;s meal. Carney, established in New York as a reliable actor, played Bratten&#x27;s mild-mannered victim, Clem Finch. Gleason and Carney developed a good working chemistry, and Gleason recruited Carney to appear in other sketches, including the domestic-comedy skits featuring &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;. Carney gained lifelong fame for his portrayal of sewer worker Ed Norton, opposite Jackie Gleason&#x27;s bus driver, Ralph Kramden. The success of these skits resulted in the famous situation comedy &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; and the &quot;Honeymooners&quot; revivals that followed. He was nominated for seven Emmy Awards and won six.

Between his stints with Gleason, Carney worked steadily as a character actor and occasionally in musical-variety. He guest-starred on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Henry Morgan&#x27;s Great Talent Hunt&quot; (1951), &quot;The Dinah Shore Chevy Show&quot;, and many others, including as a mystery guest four times on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, dressed as Ed Norton for his first appearance. Carney also had his own NBC television variety show from 1959 to 1960.

In 1958, he starred in an ABC children&#x27;s television special &quot;Art Carney Meets Peter and the Wolf&quot;, which featured the Bil Baird Marionettes. It combined an original story with a marionette presentation of Serge Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;. Some of Prokofiev&#x27;s other music was given lyrics written by Ogden Nash. The special was a success and was repeated twice.

Carney starred in a Christmas episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;The Night of the Meek&quot;, playing a dramatic turn as an alcoholic department store Santa Claus who later becomes the real thing. In 1964, he guest-starred in the episode &quot;Smelling Like a Rose&quot; along with Hal March and Tina Louise in the CBS drama &quot;Mr. Broadway&quot;, starring Craig Stevens. In the season two opening episodes 35 and 36 of the &quot;Batman&quot; television series, titled &quot;Shoot a Crooked Arrow&quot; and &quot;Walk the Straight and Narrow&quot; (1966), Carney performed as the newly introduced villain &quot;The Archer&quot;. In 1967, he was originally cast as Geppetto for the Hallmark adaption of Pinocchio, but illness prevented him from appearing when taping time arrived. He was later replaced by Burl Ives.

In 1970, Carney appeared as Skeet in &quot;The Men from Shiloh&quot; (the rebranded name of &quot;The Virginian&quot;) in the episode titled &quot;With Love, Bullets and Valentines.&quot; In the early 1970s, Carney sang and danced on several episodes of &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;, took part in the Dean Martin Celebrity Roast of his old co-star Jackie Gleason, and appeared as both Santa Claus and his wannabe kidnapper Cosmo Scam in the 1970 Muppets TV special &quot;The Great Santa Claus Switch&quot;. He was also a guest star on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; in January 1971.

He starred as Police Chief Paul Lanigan in the 1976 television film &quot;Lanigan&#x27;s Rabbi&quot;, and in the short-lived series of the same name that aired in 1977 as part of the &quot;NBC Sunday Mystery Movie&quot; lineup.

In 1978, Carney appeared in &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot;, a television film that was linked to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film series. In it, he played Trader Saun Dann, a member of the Rebel Alliance who helped Chewbacca and his family evade an Imperial blockade. The same year, he appeared as the father of Ringo Starr&#x27;s alter ego &quot;Ognir Rrats&quot; in the made for television special &quot;Ringo&quot;. Carney appeared on an episode of &quot;Alice&quot;.

In 1980, he starred in the TV film &quot;&quot;. In 1984, he portrayed Santa Claus in the holiday television film &quot;The Night They Saved Christmas&quot;.

Among his final television roles were a series of commercials for Coca-Cola in which he played a man enjoying a day out with his grandson played by actor Brian Bonsall, including a famous Christmas commercial based around the famous Rockefeler Center Christmas tree in New York.

===Recordings===
Carney recorded prolifically in the 1950s for Columbia Records. Two of his hits were &quot;The Song of the Sewer&quot;, sung in character as Norton, and &quot;&#x27;Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot;, a spoken-word record in which Carney, accompanied only by a jazz drummer, recited the famous Yuletide poem in syncopation. Some of Carney&#x27;s recordings were comedy-novelty songs, but most were silly songs intended especially for children.

He also narrated a version of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; for Golden Records, with Mitch Miller and his chorus performing four of the songs from the 1939 film version.

===Films===
Carney won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his 1974 performance as Harry Coombes, an elderly man going on the road with his pet cat, in &quot;Harry and Tonto&quot;. Other nominees that year were Albert Finney, Dustin Hoffman, Jack Nicholson, and Al Pacino. It was presented to him at the 47th Academy Awards on April 8, 1975, by actress Glenda Jackson, with whom Carney went on to co-star in the comedy &quot;House Calls&quot; in 1978. Carney also won a Golden Globe award for his performance in &quot;Harry and Tonto&quot;.

In demand in Hollywood after that, Carney then appeared in &quot;W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings&quot; (as a deranged preacher), &quot;The Late Show&quot; (as an aging detective), &quot;House Calls&quot; (as a senile chief surgeon), &quot;Movie Movie&quot; (in multiple roles), and &quot;Going in Style&quot; (as a bored senior citizen who joins in on bank robberies). Later films included &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot;, the crime drama &quot;The Naked Face&quot;, and the sci-fi thriller &quot;Firestarter&quot;.

In 1981, he portrayed Harry R. Truman, an 83-year-old lodge owner in the semi-fictional account of events leading to the eruption of Mount St. Helens in &quot;St. Helens&quot;.

In 1990, he co-starred in a movie called, “Where Pigeons Go to Die” with Michael Landon. He played the role of a grandfather who taught his grandson little life lessons that would follow him for the rest of his life. 

His final film role was in the 1993 action comedy film &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;.
===Broadway===
Carney made his Broadway debut in 1957 as the lead in &quot;The Rope Dancers&quot; with Siobhán McKenna, a drama by Morton Wishengrad. His subsequent Broadway appearances included his portrayal in 1965–1967 of Felix Unger in &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; (opposite Walter Matthau and then Jack Klugman as Oscar). In 1969 he was nominated for a Tony Award for his performance in Brian Friel&#x27;s &quot;Lovers&quot;. In 1961–1962, Carney played Frank Michaelson in an English comedy by Phoebe and Henry Ephron titled &quot;Take Her, She&#x27;s Mine&quot; with Phyllis Thaxter as his co-star in the Biltmore Theatre in New York; the character was played by James Stewart in the 1963 film version.
==Personal life ==
Carney was married three times to two women. In 1940, he married his high school sweetheart Jean Myers, with whom he had three children, Eileen, Brian and Paul, before divorcing in 1965. In 1966, Carney married production assistant Barbara Isaac; they divorced in 1977. After his divorce from Isaac, he reunited with Myers, and they remarried in 1980 and remained together until his death. His grandson is Connecticut state representative Devin Carney and his great-nephew is musician and actor Reeve Carney. 

According to Carney, he was an alcoholic by his late teens. His stage partner, comedian Ollie O&#x27;Toole, &quot;would order gin and grapefruit juice for us in the morning and, gee, it was great.&quot; Carney later used barbiturates, amphetamines, and alcohol substitutes. To battle his addiction, which he said ran in the family, he tried psychotherapy and joined Alcoholics Anonymous. He finally found success with Antabuse and quit drinking during the filming of &quot;Harry and Tonto.&quot;

Carney died at a care home in Chester, Connecticut, on November 9, 2003, five days after his 85th birthday. He is interred at Riverside Cemetery in Old Saybrook, Connecticut. Jean Carney died on October 31, 2012, at the age of 93.

<text>Harry and Tonto is a 1974 American road comedy-drama directed by Paul Mazursky and written by Mazursky &amp; Josh Greenfeld. The film follows a man named Harry who decides to travel cross-country with his pet cat, Tonto. Art Carney won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as Harry.

==Plot==
Harry Coombes is an elderly widower and retired teacher who is evicted from his Upper West Side apartment in New York City because his building is going to be razed to build a parking lot. He initially stays with his eldest son Burt&#x27;s family in the suburbs, but eventually chooses to travel cross-country with his pet cat Tonto.

Initially planning to fly to Chicago, Harry has a problem with airport security checking his cat carrier. He instead boards a long-distance bus. He gets off in the countryside, annoying the driver, so Tonto can urinate, and is left there. He buys a 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air from a used car salesman, although his driver&#x27;s license is expired. During his episodic journey, he befriends a Bible-quoting hitchhiker and underage runaway Ginger, with whom he visits an old sweetheart in a retirement home; she only half-remembers him. He visits his daughter, a bookstore owner in Chicago, with whom he shares a prickly but mutually admiring relationship. Harry&#x27;s shy grandson (who was supposed to take him back to New York) and Ginger end up going off to a commune in Colorado together in Harry&#x27;s car, with his blessing, so he and Tonto are on their own again.

Continuing west, Harry accepts a ride with a health-food salesman, makes the acquaintance of an attractive hooker on his way to Las Vegas, and spends a night in jail with a friendly Native American. He eventually arrives in Los Angeles, where he stays with his youngest son Eddie, a financially strapped real-estate salesman, before finding a place of his own with Tonto.

After Tonto dies, Harry is living alone, making new friends, enjoying the climate. He sees a young cat who looks exactly like Tonto, and follows it to the beach, where a child is building a sand castle.

==Cast==

Also appearing toward the end of the film as Celia is Sally Marr, mother of Lenny Bruce.

==Production==
Mazursky had James Cagney in mind for the role of Harry, but the actor turned the part down, as did Laurence Olivier and Cary Grant. Mazursky then saw Art Carney in a play and approached him. Carney initially declined as well, in part because he was about fifteen years younger than Harry, but he eventually agreed. Cast as an elderly man, Carney, born in 1918, was actually only 13 years older than the actors who played his sons, Larry Hagman and Phil Bruns, and 14 years older than Ellen Burstyn, who played his daughter. Thanks to the makeup of Emmy winning artist Bob O&#x27;Bradovich, Carney was effectively transformed into the elderly Harry.

At the time, Carney noted that prior to his work in &quot;Harry and Tonto&quot;, he &quot;never liked cats&quot; but said he wound up getting along well with the cat in the film. Mazursky was offered the primary cat of the two who played Tonto by the animal wrangler, but had to decline because his wife had become allergic to them.

The woman who played the cab driver, Muriel Beerman, was in actuality a part-time taxi driver who had driven Mazursky to the casting office one day. Very talkative, Mazursky had her leave the meter running and her audition for him for the part.

==Reception==
Nora Sayre of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film had been &quot;directed at far too slow a pace, which means that the comic possibilities and the social comment have been diminished. The muted style robs the picture of the point it&#x27;s meant to make: that imaginative energy transcends the generations.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;pleasant, if commercially unexciting,&quot; with an &quot;excellent&quot; performance by Carney. Roger Ebert gave the film 4 stars out of 4, praising Carney for a performance that was &quot;totally original, all his own, and worthy of the Academy Award it received.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; awarded 3.5 out of 4 stars, calling it &quot;an extremely funny movie without a single gag or a Bob Hope punch line. Rather, it&#x27;s crammed full of believable people who say the kind of screwball things that make your head spin and smile.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the film as &quot;eventful, sentimental, enjoyable and firmly optimistic.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;an unusually mellow and affectionate film comedy, but it might be wise to recommend it with a slight note of caution. It&#x27;s what&#x27;s known as a &#x27;good little picture.&#x27;&quot; In &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot;, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that the film &quot;presumes to say something smart and &#x27;sophisticated&#x27; about everything from urban renewal to Carlos Castaneda&#x27;s medicinal lore, along with a continuous lesson about growing old gracefully that is dished out at every opportunity; yet it winds up telling us virtually nothing at all.&quot;

The film holds a score of 88% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 32 reviews, with an average grade of 7.3 out of 10; critics&#x27; consensus stating that: &quot;Making his sorely belated debut in a big-screen leading role, Art Carney brings &quot;Harry and Tonto&quot; brilliantly to life.&quot;

<text>Lionel Bart (1 August 1930 – 3 April 1999) was an English writer and composer of pop music and musicals. He wrote Tommy Steele&#x27;s &quot;Rock with the Caveman&quot; and was the sole creator of the musical &quot;Oliver!&quot; (1960). With &quot;Oliver!&quot; and his work alongside theatre director Joan Littlewood at Theatre Royal, Stratford East, he played an instrumental role in the 1960s birth of the British musical theatre scene after an era when American musicals had dominated the West End.

Best known for creating the book, music and lyrics for &quot;Oliver!&quot;, Bart was described by Andrew Lloyd Webber as &quot;the father of the modern British musical&quot;. In 1963 he won the Tony Award for Best Original Score for &quot;Oliver!&quot;, and the 1968 film version of the musical won a total of 6 Academy Awards including the Academy Award for Best Picture.

Some of his other songs include the theme song to the James Bond film &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;, and the songs &quot;Living Doll&quot; by Cliff Richard, &quot;Far Away&quot; by Shirley Bassey, &quot;Do You Mind?&quot; (recorded by both Anthony Newley and Andy Williams), &quot;Big Time&quot; (a 1961 cover by Jack Jones of his show tune from &quot;Fings Ain&#x27;t Wot They Used T&#x27;Be&quot;), &quot;Easy Going Me&quot; by Adam Faith, &quot;Always You And Me&quot; by Russ Conway, and several songs recorded by Tommy Steele (&quot;A Handful of Songs&quot;, &quot;Butterfingers&quot; and &quot;Little White Bull&quot;). By the mid 1960s he was as well known for his outlandish lifestyle, his celebrity friends, his excesses and his parties, as he was for his work.

==Early life==
He was born Lionel Begleiter, the youngest of seven surviving children of Galician Jews, Yetta (née Darumstundler) and Morris Begleiter, a master tailor. He grew up in Stepney; his father worked in the area as a tailor in a garden shed. The family had escaped the pogroms against Jews by Ukrainian cossacks in Galicia.

As a young man he was an accomplished painter. When Bart was aged six, a teacher told his parents that he was a musical genius. His parents gave him an old violin, but he did not apply himself and the lessons stopped.

==Songwriting==

He started his songwriting career in amateur theatre, first at The International Youth Centre in 1952 where he and a friend wrote a revue together called &quot;IYC Revue 52&quot;. The following year the pair auditioned for a production of the Leonard Irwin play &quot;The Wages of Eve&quot; at London&#x27;s Unity Theatre. Shortly afterward Bart began composing songs for Unity Theatre productions, contributing material (including the title song) to its 1953 revue &quot;Turn It Up&quot;, and songs for its 1953 pantomime, an agitprop version of &quot;Cinderella&quot;. While at the Unity he was talent-spotted by Joan Littlewood, and so joined Theatre Workshop. He also wrote comedy songs for the Sunday lunchtime BBC radio programme &quot;The Billy Cotton Band Show&quot;.

He first gained widespread recognition through his pop songwriting, penning numerous hits for the stable of young male singers promoted by artist manager and music publisher Larry Parnes. Bart&#x27;s pop output in this period includes the hits &quot;Living Doll&quot; (written for Cliff Richard) and &quot;Rock with the Caveman&quot;, &quot;Handful of Songs&quot;, &quot;Butterfingers&quot; and &quot;Little White Bull&quot; (all for Tommy Steele). During this period, Steele and Mike Pratt were his songwriting partners. He won three Ivor Novello Awards in 1957, a further four in 1958, and two in 1960. He wrote the theme song for the 1963 James Bond film &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;, and worked with John Barry again on the score to the 1964 film &quot;Man in the Middle&quot;. His other hits include &quot;Do You Mind&quot;, recorded by both Andy Williams and Anthony Newley, whose recording reached number one on the UK charts on 30 March 1960 and was the 100th song to do so, &quot;Big Time&quot; (a 1961 cover by Jack Jones of his show tune from &quot;Fings Ain&#x27;t Wot They Used T&#x27;Be&quot;), &quot;Easy Going Me&quot; (Adam Faith), and &quot;Always You and Me&quot; (with Russ Conway).

Bart was also responsible for the discovery of two of Parnes&#x27; biggest stars. It was on his recommendation that Parnes went to see singer Tommy Hicks, whom he signed and renamed Tommy Steele, and Bart also suggested that Parnes see singer Reg Smith, who was then performing at the Condor Club. Although Parnes missed his performance, he went round to Smith&#x27;s house and signed him up on the basis of Bart&#x27;s recommendation. Smith went on to score a number of UK hits under his new stage name Marty Wilde.

Twenty-seven years after it became a number one hit for Cliff Richard, &quot;Living Doll&quot; was re-recorded by The Young Ones and Richard for Comic Relief, and spent another three weeks at number one.

==Musical theatre==
Bart&#x27;s first professional musical was 1959&#x27;s &quot;Lock Up Your Daughters&quot;, based on the 18th-century play &quot;Rape upon Rape&quot; by Henry Fielding. Following that, &quot;Fings Ain&#x27;t Wot They Used T&#x27;Be&quot;, produced by Joan Littlewood&#x27;s Theatre Workshop, was noted for encouraging the use of authentic Cockney accents on the London stage and bringing an end to censorship of British theatre. &quot;Oliver!&quot; (1960), based on Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, was a major success. The music for &quot;Oliver!&quot; was transcribed by Eric Rogers, who wrote and composed 21 scores for the &quot;Carry On&quot; films. Bart hummed the melodies and Rogers wrote the notes on his behalf as Bart could not read or write music.

In 1968 &quot;Oliver!&quot; was made into a movie starring Ron Moody, Oliver Reed and Shani Wallis that won several Oscars, including best film. It is estimated that around this time Bart was earning 16 pounds a minute from &quot;Oliver!&quot;

Bart&#x27;s next two musicals, &quot;Blitz!&quot; (1962) (from which came the song &quot;Far Away&quot;, a hit for Shirley Bassey) and &quot;Maggie May&quot; (1964) had successful and respectable West End runs (&quot;Blitz!&quot;, at the time London&#x27;s most expensive musical ever, had a run of 568 performances), but &quot;Twang!!&quot; (1965), a musical based on the Robin Hood legend, was a flop and &quot;La Strada&quot; (1969), which opened on Broadway after the removal of most of Bart&#x27;s songs, closed after only one performance. By this time Bart was taking LSD and other drugs and was drinking heavily.

Bart used his personal finances to try to rescue his last two productions, selling his past and future rights to his work, including &quot;Oliver!&quot; which he sold to the entertainer Max Bygraves for £350 (Bygraves later sold them on for £250,000) to realise capital to finance the shows; Bart later estimated that this action lost him over £1 million. By 1972, Bart was bankrupt with debts of £73,000. A twenty-year period of depression and alcoholism ensued. He eventually stopped drinking, although the years of substance abuse seriously damaged his health, leaving him with diabetes and impaired liver function.

He wrote &quot;Next Year in Jerusalem&quot; in 1975–1976, but it was not staged until 2021 in a virtual performance of the Jewish Music Institute featuring Maureen Lipman. In May 1977, an autobiographical musical called &quot;Lionel!&quot; opened in the West End at the New London Theatre. It was loosely based on Bart&#x27;s early life as a child prodigy. Bart added some new songs for the show. The cast included Clarke Peters, Marion Montgomery and Adrienne Posta. The role of Lionel was shared by a young Todd Carty and Chris Nieto. The show closed after six weeks.

== Later life ==
Bart continued writing songs and themes for films, but his only real success in his later years was &quot;Happy Endings&quot;, a song he wrote for a 1989 Abbey National advertising campaign, which featured Bart playing the piano and singing to children.

He received a special Ivor Novello Award for life achievement in 1986. In 1987, encouraged by long-time friend Barry Humphries, he travelled to Australia to attend the opening of a new production of &quot;Blitz!&quot;, which was then revived in London&#x27;s West End in 1990 by the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the London blitz. In April 1991, he appeared on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. Cameron Mackintosh, who owned half the rights to &quot;Oliver!&quot;, revived the musical at the London Palladium in 1994 in a version featuring rewrites by Bart. Mackintosh gave Bart a share of the production royalties. At the peak of his career, Bart was romantically linked in the media with singers Judy Garland and Alma Cogan, though he was homosexual. His sexual preferences were known to friends and colleagues, but he did not announce them publicly until a few years before his death.

Bart died at the Hammersmith Hospital in West London on 3 April 1999, of liver cancer. A memorial bench is dedicated to him in Kew Gardens.

A workshop of a musical based on Bart&#x27;s life and using his songs, &quot;It&#x27;s a Fine Life&quot;, was staged in 2006 at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, Hornchurch. A later version titled &quot;More!&quot; was presented in concert at Theatre Royal Stratford East in 2015 featuring Neil McDermott as Bart, Jessica Hynes as Joan Littlewood and Sonny Jay as Charlene, with an appearance by 1960s pop-star Grazina Frame, who was an original cast member in Bart&#x27;s &quot;Blitz!&quot;.

<text>The U.S. state of Ohio is home to a number of public and private institutions of higher learning. Prior to statehood, the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 included a provision to establish an institution of higher education in what became Ohio. American Western University was chartered in 1802 as a result, but never opened. Two years later, the new Ohio General Assembly chartered Ohio University, which opened for classes in 1809, followed by Miami University, which was chartered in 1809 and opened in 1824. In northern Ohio, Western Reserve College (now Case Western Reserve University) was established in 1826.

<text>François Charles Mauriac (; ; 11 October 1885 – 1 September 1970) was a French novelist, dramatist, critic, poet, and journalist, a member of the&quot; Académie française&quot; (from 1933), and laureate of the Nobel Prize in Literature (1952). He was awarded the Grand Cross of the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; in 1958.

==Biography==
François Charles Mauriac was born in Bordeaux, France. He studied literature at the University of Bordeaux, graduating in 1905, after which he moved to Paris to prepare for postgraduate study at the École des Chartes.

On 1 June 1933, he was elected a member of the &quot;Académie française&quot;, succeeding Eugène Brieux.

A former Action française supporter, he turned to the left during the Spanish Civil War, criticizing the Catholic Church for its support of Franco. After the fall of France to the Axis during the Second World War, he briefly supported the collaborationist régime of Marshal Pétain, but joined the Resistance as early as December 1941. He was the only member of the Académie française to publish a Resistance text with the Editions de Minuit.

Mauriac had a bitter dispute with Albert Camus immediately following the Liberation of France. At that time, Camus edited the Resistance paper &quot;Combat&quot; (thereafter an overt daily, until 1947), while Mauriac wrote a column for &quot;Le Figaro&quot;. Camus said newly liberated France should purge all Nazi collaborator elements, but Mauriac warned that such disputes should be set aside in the interests of national reconciliation. Mauriac also doubted that justice would be impartial or dispassionate, given the emotional turmoil of the Liberation. Despite having been viciously criticised by Robert Brasillach, he campaigned against his execution.

Mauriac also had a bitter public dispute with Roger Peyrefitte, who criticised the Vatican in books such as &quot;Les Clés de saint Pierre&quot; (1953). Mauriac threatened to resign from the paper he was working with at the time (&quot;L&#x27;Express&quot;) if they did not stop carrying advertisements for Peyrefitte&#x27;s books. The quarrel was exacerbated by the release of the film adaptation of Peyrefitte&#x27;s &quot;Les Amitiés Particulières&quot;, and culminated in a virulent open letter by Peyrefitte in which he accused Mauriac of homosexual tendencies and called him a Tartuffe, hypocrite.

Mauriac was opposed to French rule in Vietnam, and strongly condemned the use of torture by the French army in Algeria.

In 1952, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for the deep spiritual insight and the artistic intensity with which he has in his novels penetrated the drama of human life&quot;. He was awarded the Grand Cross of the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; in 1958. He published a series of personal memoirs and a biography of Charles de Gaulle.
Mauriac&#x27;s complete works were published in twelve volumes between 1950 and 1956. He encouraged Elie Wiesel to write about his experiences as a Jewish teenager during the Holocaust, and wrote the foreword to Elie Wiesel&#x27;s book &quot;Night&quot;.

He was the father of writer Claude Mauriac and grandfather of Anne Wiazemsky, a French actress and author who worked with and married French director Jean-Luc Godard.

François Mauriac died in Paris on 1 September 1970, and was interred in the Cimetière de Vemars, Val d&#x27;Oise, France.

<doc id="163467" wikidata="Q925855" url="?curid=163467" title="The Sunshine Boys">
<text>The Sunshine Boys is an original two-act play written by Neil Simon that premiered December 20, 1972, on Broadway starring Jack Albertson as Willie Clark and Sam Levene as Al Lewis and later adapted for film and television.

==Plot==
The play&#x27;s protagonists are Al Lewis and Willie Clark. Lewis and Clark were once a successful vaudevillian comedy duo known as the Sunshine Boys. During the later years of their 43-year run, animosity between the partners grew to the point where they ceased to speak with each other. Eleven years prior to the events of the play, Al retired from show business, leaving Willie struggling to keep his career afloat.

Willie, now an old man struggling with memory loss, reluctantly accepts an offer from his nephew Ben, a talent agent, to reunite with Al for a CBS special on the history of comedy. Willie and Al meet in Willie&#x27;s apartment to rehearse their classic doctor and tax collector sketch. The reunion gets off to a bad start, with the two getting into heated arguments over various aspects of the performance. However, thanks to the urging of Al&#x27;s daughter, the two decide to go through with the performance.

Willie and Al&#x27;s dress rehearsal at CBS&#x27; studio is derailed by Al&#x27;s aggressive habit of poking Willie&#x27;s chest with his index finger and spitting at him every time he says a word that has a &quot;T&quot; in it. One of the running gags in “The Sunshine Boys” involves Willie&#x27;s resentment over having been constantly poked in the chest by his partner&#x27;s all‐too‐emphatic forefinger in the course of their countless routines on stage. Willie cries, “I had a black and blue hole in my chest. He gave me the finger for 43 years!” As Al walks off the stage in regret, Willie has a heart attack as a result of his agitated state.

Two weeks later, Willie is recovering under the care of a nurse. Upon Ben&#x27;s recommendation, he decides to move into an actors&#x27; retirement home in New Jersey. Al, concerned about Willie&#x27;s well-being, makes a visit. When the two talk, it is revealed that Al will be moving into the same home as Willie.

Neil Simon was inspired by two venerable vaudeville teams. The longevity of &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot; was inspired by Smith and Dale who, unlike their theatrical counterparts, were inseparable lifelong friends. The undercurrent of backstage hostility between &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot; was inspired by the team of Gallagher and Shean, who were successful professionally but argumentative personally. Other sources say this is based on Weber and Fields.

==Theatre productions==

Produced by Emanuel Azenberg and directed by Alan Arkin, the original 1972 Broadway cast starred Sam Levene as Al Lewis and Jack Albertson as Willie Clark, the vaudevillian comedy duo known as the Sunshine Boys; the play co-starred Lewis J. Stadlen as Ben, Willie Clark&#x27;s nephew.

When Sam Levene and Jack Albertson departed the Broadway production to star in the first U.S. National company, they were replaced by Lou Jacobi as Al Lewis on February 12, 1974, and Jack Gilford as Willie Clark on October 30, 1973. Jacobi performed the role of Al Lewis for 72 performances. Sam Levene, the original star, is credited with performing the role of Al Lewis 466 times in the original Broadway production before headlining the first U.S. national tour.

Tony Award nominations went to Simon (Best Play), Albertson (Best Actor in a Play) and Arkin (Best Direction of a Play), and Albertson won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Performance (and was nominated for a Tony as well). Al Hirschfeld memorialized the legendary starring performances of Jack Albertson as Willie Clark and Sam Levene as Al Lewis, the original Broadway stars of &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot;, by creating an iconic caricature for &quot;The New York Times&quot; on December 13, 1972. Titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Poke With The Finger&quot; the caricature references the finger poke running gag and Willie Clark&#x27;s resentment over having been constantly and aggressively poked during the show and for 43 years by Al Lewis played by Sam Levene.

The 1972 production of &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; marked the beginning of Neil Simon&#x27;s long association with producer Emanuel Azenberg, who produced all of Simon&#x27;s original Broadway plays and musicals that followed.

Clive Barnes, &quot;The New York Times&quot; chief theatre critic, reviewed the original Broadway production on December 21, 1972, stating: &quot;&quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; is probably Mr. Simon&#x27;s best play yet. It deals with a subject very dear to the playwright&#x27;s heart—vaudeville. Willie Clark is an almost retired vaudeville comedian. His heart is willing, but his lines are failing. His agent is his nephew—long‐suffering and much‐loving. But even a potato‐chip commercial has not gone well, and any actor who cannot crunch potato chips has got to be on his way out.&quot;

Regarding the original Broadway stars, Barnes stated: &quot;Jack Albertson as the heart stricken comic never puts a line wrong. He is always pathetic but never enough to make you cry. Lovely. His acerbic partner, Sam Levene, is as tough as vintage chewing gum, and yet with a sort of credible lovability.&quot;

Jack Albertson and Sam Levene won unanimous rave notices for their legendary starring performances in the original Broadway production of &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; even though before &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; went into rehearsal Albertson and Levene were strangers. Director Alan Arkin recalled in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Now they work as collaboratively as did Smith and Dale, the legendary team on which “The Sunshine Boys” is partly based.&quot; Arkin said &quot;Jack (Albertson) and Sam (Levene) would have these terrific yelling matches&quot;. &quot;It used to scare hell out of everybody until we realized that it meant nothing. They were mock battles, completely without anger. They&#x27;re consummate professionals.” Albertson interjected: &quot;There is a “chemical” between the two&quot;. “He knows what I think; and I know what he thinks,” Albertson told &quot;The New York Times&quot;. “Sam and I have the same thing in the play. If one of us blows a line, the other covers. Frankly, I blow more lines than Sam does.” The two pros were able to cover lines as they each knew the play, not just their roles. New York Post Theatre Critic Richard Watts Jr. observed &quot;Jack Albertson and Sam Levene offer the best team acting since Gielgud and Richardson in Home&quot;.

The play was revived on Broadway at the Lyceum Theatre, opening on December 8, 1997, and closing on June 28, 1998, after 230 performances. Directed by John Tillinger, the cast starred Jack Klugman as Willie Clark and Tony Randall as Al Lewis.

A West End production of the play, starring Danny DeVito (in his West End debut)) and Richard Griffiths, opened on May 17, 2012, and played a limited 12-week season until July 28.

Griffiths was later replaced by DeVito’s “Taxi” co-star, Judd Hirsch. In a 2013 review of the Hirsch/Devito cast at the Ahmanson Theatre, Myron Meisel observed: &quot;It’s been more than 40 years since &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; first graced Broadway (with the still unimprovable Jack Albertson and Sam Levene), nearly as long in the tooth as the &quot;Smith and Dale&quot; sketch “Dr. Kronkheit and His Only Living Patient” was when this show was new. Simon fashioned a new, improved update on the routine for his fictional team of Lewis &amp; Clark (Hirsch &amp; DeVito), and his knowledgeable ear for what was then vintage and is now antique humor allows him to bring these anachronistic stylings into a then-contemporary comic setting without compromising the integrity of their original zingy ballsiness&quot;.

==Adaptations==

===American versions===
;The 1975 feature film : Stars George Burns as Lewis and Walter Matthau as Clark. Burns won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance.

;1977 TV pilot : Stars Lionel Stander as Lewis and Red Buttons as Clark. The pilot was not picked up for a series, but was broadcast by NBC on June 9, 1977.

;The 1996 TV movie : Stars Woody Allen as Lewis and Peter Falk as Clark. Neil Simon adapted his play for Hallmark Entertainment. Directed by John Erman, it was not broadcast until December 28, 1997. Other performers include Michael McKean, Liev Schreiber, Edie Falco, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Whoopi Goldberg in supporting roles. Simon&#x27;s teleplay updated the setting and made the two comedians the product of the early days of television, the medium in which the playwright got his start. Unlike the film adaptation, although they are portrayed as cantankerous, their animosity was not as severe as Matthau&#x27;s and Burns&#x27; characters&#x27; bad relationship.

<text>William Frederic Marquat (March 17, 1894 – May 29, 1960) was a major general in the US Army. Prior to his service in the military, Marquat was a reporter for &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;. Prior to the Japanese invasion of 1941, Marquat served with the Office of the Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines, as the chief engineering advisor.

==Early life==
Marquat was born on March 17, 1894, in St. Louis, Missouri to William and Sara (Layden) Marquat. He moved to the state of Washington and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Washington National Guard Coast Artillery Corps in October 1916. Marquat was called to federal service for World War I in July 1917 and served as a temporary captain from October 1918 to July 1919.

=== History ===
Following the restoration of the capital of the Republic of Korea to its president and before the Seoul area was free of enemy activity, General Marquat, completely disregarding his own safety, toured the region by vehicle to obtain first-hand information vital to planning effective anti-aircraft installations necessary to forestall surprise enemy air attacks. Later, in anticipation of increased enemy air activity, General Marquat traveled over terrain harassed by sniper fire and endangered by land mines to inspect anti-aircraft installations. His personal concern for his troops, aggressive actions in ground surveillance, and presence in the forward areas inspired his units to a high degree of efficiency and contributed materially to the United Nations effort in Korea. General Marquat&#x27;s inspirational courage and his unfaltering devotion to duty as a leader upholds the highest traditions of the military service.

<doc id="163478" wikidata="Q518710" url="?curid=163478" title="The Man in the Glass Booth">
<text>The Man in the Glass Booth is a 1975 American drama film directed by Arthur Hiller. The film was produced and released as part of the American Film Theatre, which adapted theatrical works for a subscription cinema series. The screenplay was adapted from Robert Shaw&#x27;s 1967 novel and stage play, both of the same name. The novel was the second in a trilogy of novels, preceded by &quot;The Flag&quot; (1965), and followed by &quot;A Card from Morocco&quot; (1969).

The plot was inspired by the kidnapping and trial of the German Nazi SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; (lieutenant colonel) Adolf Eichmann, who was one of the major organizers of the Holocaust.

== Plot ==
Arthur Goldman is Jewish and a Nazi death camp survivor. Now a rich industrialist, he lives in luxury in a Manhattan high-rise. He banters with his assistant Charlie, often shocking him with his outrageousness and irreverence about aspects of Jewish life. One day, Israeli Mossad agents kidnap Goldman and take him to Israel for trial on charges of being a Nazi war criminal. Goldman&#x27;s trial forces his accusers to face not only his presumed guilt, but theirs as well.

At the end, it appears that Goldman is neither a Nazi nor a war criminal after all; he falsified the dental records which the Israelis used to identify him to bring about the trial. When the deception is revealed by the Israeli prosecutor, Goldman is left standing in the trial court&#x27;s bulletproof glass box, a broken man. The stress shatters his mental health and he becomes catatonic. He then relives in his mind a Nazi firing squad execution and dies as those in the courtroom whisper the Jewish prayer, (&quot;Hear, O Israel: The LORD is our God, the LORD is one&quot;).

==Cast==
==Development==
While &quot;The Man in the Glass Booth&quot; was being developed for the screen, Shaw disapproved of the screenplay and had his name removed from the credits. Shaw viewed the completed film before its release and asked to have his name reinstated. In 2002, director Arthur Hiller related Shaw&#x27;s objection to the screenplay and his change of heart,

When we decided that we needed more emotions in the film and leaned it towards that, we tried, obviously, to be honest to Robert Shaw, to keep that intellectual game-playing, but to create more of an emotional environment. And Robert Shaw became very disturbed. He did not like the idea and indeed, if you will watch the film, you will see that his name does not appear in the credits, nor does it even say, &quot;based on the play, &quot;The Man in the Glass Booth&quot;&quot; because he wouldn&#x27;t let us do it. He just didn&#x27;t like the idea until he saw the film. Then he phoned Eddie Anhalt, the screenwriter, and congratulated him because he thought it was—just kept the tone he wanted and did it so well. And he phoned Mort Abrahams the Executive Producer to see if he could get his name put on the final credits. But it was too late to restore his name, all the prints were all made.

== Production ==
The film was shot for $1 million, with 10 days of rehearsals and 23 days of filming in the summer of 1974. The exteriors of Goldman&#x27;s penthouse were filmed atop the Crown Building in New York City, where the roof of the building was dressed to look like a balcony and garden. Interiors were filmed at the 20th Century Fox Studios in Century City, California.

== Awards and honors ==
Maximilian Schell was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama for his performance. Edward Anhalt was nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Drama Adapted from Another Medium for his screenplay.

== Reception ==
Roger Ebert wrote &quot;Arthur Hiller&#x27;s film for the AFT is a very good one, although it suffers from one basic problem. By its very nature, film tends to be a realistic medium, photographing the outsides of real world. Robert Shaw&#x27;s play, even as adapted and made somewhat more realistic by Edward Anhalt, is nevertheless a symbolic and mannered one&quot;. Raymond Benson wrote in 2009, &quot;The film is a riveting, first-rate drama featuring an Oscar-nominated, tour-de-force performance by Schell&quot;.

==Home video==
The film was released as a region 1 DVD in 2003 and again in 2008. A Blu-ray version was released in the US in 2017.

<doc id="163479" wikidata="Q445438" url="?curid=163479" title="Christopher Cross">
<text>Christopher Cross (born Christopher Charles Geppert; May 3, 1951) is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist.
He won five Grammy Awards for his eponymous debut album released in 1979. The singles &quot;Sailing&quot; (1979), and &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Theme (Best That You Can Do)&quot; (from the 1981 film &quot;Arthur&quot;) peaked at number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Sailing&quot; earned three Grammys in 1980, while &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Theme&quot; won in 1982 the Oscar for Best Original Song (with co-composers Burt Bacharach, Carole Bayer Sager, and Peter Allen).

==Personal life==
A self-described &quot;army brat&quot;, Cross is the son of a U.S. Army pediatrician stationed at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington, D.C., in the mid-1950s, acting as physician for President Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s grandchildren. He attended Alamo Heights High School in San Antonio and graduated in 1969. He was involved in football and track and field.
Cross was married to Roseanne Harrison from 1973 until the couple divorced in 1982. His 1988 marriage to Jan Bunch ended in a 2007 divorce. He has two children, Madison and Rain.

On April 3, 2020, Cross confirmed through his Facebook page that he had tested positive for the COVID-19 virus, and was ill, but was recovering. Cross later reported on Twitter that he had lost the use of his legs, but his doctors told him he should fully recover. Physicians told him his illness triggered an episode of Guillain–Barré syndrome that caused the nerves in his legs to stop functioning properly. By October 2020, he was able to walk with a cane, but said his memory and speech had been affected.
In 2021 and 2022 he played his 40th anniversary concert tour, which had originally been planned for 2020.

He is Catholic. 

==Career==
===Early musical career===
Geppert, bassist Andy Salmon, and keyboardist Rob Meurer met in San Antonio when they were still teens. Geppert and Salmon became bandmates in Flash, with Geppert on guitar. Together, they formed Christopher Cross as a band and moved to Austin, where they added drummer Tommy Taylor. There, they played covers for cash while recording demo versions of original songs at Austin&#x27;s Odyssey Sound, which later became Pecan Street Studio, which they shipped to record labels. Though they considered themselves a band, Warner Bros. signed Christopher Cross as a solo artist in early 1979.

Although best known for his vocals and songwriting, Cross is also a skilled guitarist. Donald Fagen and Walter Becker of Steely Dan invited Cross to play on their albums, but Cross declined. Cross also substituted for Ritchie Blackmore during a Deep Purple concert in 1970 when Blackmore fell ill.

Cross was the original owner of fellow Austin guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan’s legendary “Number One” 1962/1963 hybrid Fender Stratocaster. Vaughan purchased the guitar at Ray Hennig’s Heart of Texas Music in Austin in 1974, only one day after Cross had traded the guitar for a Gibson Les Paul.

===First album and immediate success===
Cross released his self-titled debut album, &quot;Christopher Cross&quot;, on December 20, 1979. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top 20 hits from this album included &quot;Ride Like the Wind&quot; (featuring backing vocals by Michael McDonald), &quot;Sailing&quot;, &quot;Never Be the Same&quot; and &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be Mine&quot; (featuring backing vocals by Nicolette Larson). &quot;Ride Like the Wind&quot; hit number two on the U.S. Hot 100, while &quot;Sailing&quot; topped the chart for one week. &quot;Never Be The Same&quot; went number one on the Adult Contemporary chart. Cross, the album, and the song &quot;Sailing&quot; were nominated for six Grammy Awards in 1980 and won five. Cross was the first artist in Grammy history to win all four general field awards in a single ceremony, bringing home Record of the Year (&quot;Sailing&quot;), Album of the Year (&quot;Christopher Cross&quot;), Song of the Year (&quot;Sailing&quot;) and Best New Artist at the 23rd Annual Grammy Awards. This feat was not replicated for 39 years, until Billie Eilish won all four awards at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020. In addition, &quot;Sailing&quot; won for Best Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s). &quot;Christopher Cross&quot; has been certified platinum five times in the U.S., selling over 5 million copies.

Later in 1981, Cross released &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Theme (Best That You Can Do)&quot;, co-written by Burt Bacharach, Carole Bayer Sager and Peter Allen, which was the main theme for the 1981 film &quot;Arthur&quot;. The song won the Oscar for Best Original Song in 1981, and was nominated for three Grammys, but did not win. In the U.S., it reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and on the Hot Adult Contemporary charts in October 1981, remaining at the top of the Hot 100 for three weeks while it also was a top-ten hit in several other countries. The song became the second and last American number-one hit by Christopher Cross.

===Second album===
Cross&#x27;s second album, &quot;Another Page&quot; (1983), produced &quot;All Right&quot;, &quot;No Time for Talk&quot;, and &quot;Think of Laura&quot;. &quot;All Right&quot; was used by CBS Sports for its highlights montage following the 1983 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament, while &quot;Think of Laura&quot; is used as a reference to characters on the soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;. Against his wishes ABC used his song in this context; however, he has stated that he wrote &quot;Think of Laura&quot; not in reference to the television characters, but to celebrate the life of Denison University college student Laura Carter who was killed when she was struck by a stray bullet. Cross has stated on his social media platforms that he felt it was inappropriate for ABC/General Hospital to use the song against his wishes and those of Carter&#x27;s family. &quot;Another Page&quot; sold well, getting Gold certification. He also co-wrote and sang the song &quot;A Chance For Heaven&quot; for the 1984 Summer Olympic Games.

===1980s===
After 1984, Cross&#x27;s commercial success faded. As music television channel MTV grew to dominate the mainstream music scene in the United States, Cross&#x27;s style of music proved to be a bad fit for the network, and Cross&#x27;s brand of adult contemporary music declined in popularity.

Cross&#x27;s next two albums, 1985&#x27;s &quot;Every Turn of the World&quot; and 1988&#x27;s &quot;Back of My Mind&quot; did not produce any top 40 hits or reach Gold or Platinum status.

He did, however, place the song &quot;Swept Away&quot; in the TV show &quot;Growing Pains&quot;. It was used during a video montage while Kirk Cameron&#x27;s character Mike fell in love with a local girl while vacationing with the family in Hawaii.

===1990s===
Cross made three more albums in the 1990s, and although some of his releases gained critical response, he was not able to attract the mass audience he once enjoyed. After his decline in fame in the mid to late 1980s, he toured and opened for various acts during the 1990s.

===2000s===

The year 2002 saw the release of the &quot;Very Best of...&quot; album, and in 2007 he completed a Christmas album titled &quot;A Christopher Cross Christmas&quot;. In 2008, Cross recorded a new acoustic album of his hits titled &quot;The Cafe Carlyle Sessions&quot;.

===2010s===
In 2011, Cross released a new studio album titled &quot;Doctor Faith&quot;.

In 2013, he released &quot;A Night in Paris&quot;, a 2-CD live album he recorded and filmed in April 2012 at the Theatre Le Trianon in Paris, France.

The song &quot;Ride Like the Wind&quot; was featured on the &quot;Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues&quot; original movie soundtrack, released in 2013.

In September 2014, he released &quot;Secret Ladder&quot;, followed in November 2017 by &quot;Take Me as I Am&quot;.

In 2017, he played a concert in his hometown, at the Tobin Center, San Antonio, Texas. 

In late 2019, Cross toured with Todd Rundgren, Jason Scheff, Micky Dolenz and Joey Molland of Badfinger in celebration of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;White Album&quot; on the &quot;It Was Fifty Years Ago Today – A Tribute to the Beatles&#x27; White Album&quot;. Cross performed &quot;Sailing&quot; and &quot;Ride Like the Wind&quot;.

===2020s===
During 2021–2022, Cross played in his 40th anniversary tour which had been rescheduled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Freedonia==

In 2018, he joined with other musicians in Austin to form the band Freedonia.

With Freedonia, he has released two full length albums: &quot;Freedonia&quot; (2018) and &quot;Firefly&quot; (2019) 
and an EP titled &quot;Bring Back The Dinosaurs&quot; (2021).

==Flamingo==
One common feature of Cross&#x27;s album covers is the appearance of a flamingo. According to Cross, there is no meaning behind this other than the painting chosen for his first album cover featured the bird, which has been used as a motif ever since.

<doc id="163481" wikidata="Q1325374" url="?curid=163481" title="Yoshiyuki Tomino">
<text>is a Japanese anime director, screenwriter, songwriter and novelist best known for creating the &quot;Gundam&quot; anime franchise.

== Early life and family ==
Tomino was born on November 5, 1941, in Odawara, Kanagawa Prefecture, to an old family of regional landowners in Ōjima (in present-day Kōtō, Tokyo). His grandfather Kiheiji Tomino was the mayor of Ōjima and statutory auditor of Ōtsuka Rubber Works. His father Kihei Tomino was an employee at Japan Processed Fabrics, and his mother Sachiko was the daughter of town councillor and celluloid toy manufacturer Sakichi Tanaka. His uncle Kiheiji Tomino was a member of the Tokyo Prefectural Council.

Tomino&#x27;s father Kihei aspired to become a photographer and studied art at the Nihon University. Kihei worked as a chemical engineer at the Odawara Arsenal developing pressurized suits for the Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter plane during the Pacific War. Inspired by his father, Tomino dreamed of working in aerospace engineering, and later in engineering or mechanics. However, after failing the entrance exam to a technical high school, he was forced to switch to the humanities. He spent his senior year of high school studying the basics of story writing and practiced writing novels. He graduated from Sōyō High School.

Fascinated by the postwar influx of American science fiction films, he entered the film department of Nihon University College of Art.

==Career==
Tomino joined Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s company, Mushi Productions, on March 2, 1964, where he was originally a part of the production department and worked as a production assistant. One of Tomino&#x27;s seniors was Hiroshi Wakao (later founder and CEO of Shaft), who had joined the company three months earlier; and it was Wakao who taught Tomino how to do jobs like collecting cut bags, filling out progress charts, and how to speak with the animators. Soon after, Tomino began drawing storyboards and writing screenplays for &quot;Astro Boy&quot;. He later became one of the most important members of the anime studio Sunrise, going on to direct numerous anime through the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Tomino is perhaps best known for his transformation of the &quot;Super Robot&quot; mecha anime genre into the &quot;Real Robot&quot; genre with 1979&#x27;s &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;, the first in the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise. He has also won numerous awards, including the &quot;Best Director&quot; award at the 2006 Tokyo International Anime Fair (for the 2005 film &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam: Heirs to the Stars&quot;). Two anime series directed by Tomino (&quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; in 1979–
80 and &quot;Space Runaway Ideon&quot; in 1980) won the Animage Anime Grand Prix award.

Tomino is known for using numerous pseudonyms for miscellaneous staffing roles that he performs in his works, including and , which are used to credit himself for screenplays and storyboards he creates, , which he uses to credit himself for theme song lyrics he writes. Tomino has collaborated (as Iogi) with artists such as Yoko Kanno, Asei Kobayashi, MIO and Neil Sedaka.

Tomino is noted for directing several well-known anime series throughout his career, such as his most notable work, the &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; series, beginning in 1979, and which was later followed onto numerous sequels, spinoffs and merchandising franchises, &quot;Aura Battler Dunbine&quot;, &quot;Brave Raideen&quot; (in which he directed the first 26 episodes), and numerous others. His newer work includes &quot;Brain Powerd&quot; (1998), &quot;Turn A Gundam&quot; (1999), &quot;Overman King Gainer&quot; (2002) and most recently, &quot;Gundam Reconguista in G&quot; (2014).

===1970s===
Tomino made his directorial debut with 1972&#x27;s . This show, loosely based on Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s manga &quot;Blue Triton&quot;, showed a different perspective than the traditional &quot;good vs. evil&quot; show. The star, Triton, a 10-year-old boy, is the last survivor of the Tritons, a tribe from Atlantis that was wiped out by the supposedly evil Poseidons. However the viewers learn later on that the story was not so black and white after all.

In 1975, Tomino worked on &quot;Brave Raideen&quot;, his first mecha work, in which he directed the first 26 episodes. &quot;Raideen&quot; was renowned and influential in its innovative portrayal of a giant machine of mysterious and mystical origins, and has gone on to inspire numerous other directors and series, including Yutaka Izubuchi&#x27;s 2002 series, &quot;RahXephon&quot;. Tomino also later worked on 1977&#x27;s &quot;Voltes V&quot;.

In 1977, Tomino directed &quot;Zambot 3&quot;. Certain sources cite this series as the origin of a nickname used by some anime fans, , due to the high number of character deaths (although Tomino had directed and worked in a number of series in which the vast majority of the protagonists survive).

In 1978, Tomino conceived, wrote and directed the successful Super Robot series &quot;Daitarn 3&quot;, which featured an unusual mix of spy adventure, drama, sci-fi and irony. The series introduced many &quot;pastiche&quot; elements which became popular in the Eighties. The lead character, Haran Banjo, is considered one of the most multi-layered and fascinating anime characters in history.

In 1979, Tomino directed and wrote &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;, which was highly influential in transforming the Super Robot mecha genre into the Real Robot genre. Mark Simmons discusses the impact of &quot;Gundam&quot; in his book, &quot;Gundam Official Guide&quot;:
In an interview published in &quot;Animerica&quot; magazine, Tomino discusses what he was trying to accomplish with &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;:
Although the last quarter of the show&#x27;s original script was canceled and it had to be completed in 43 episodes, its popularity grew after three compilation movies were released in 1981 and 1982. &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; was followed by numerous sequels, spin-offs and merchandising franchises, becoming one of the longest-running and most influential, popular anime series in history, being chosen as No. 1 on TV Asahi&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Anime&quot; listing in 2005.

===1980s===
In 1980, Tomino directed &quot;Space Runaway Ideon&quot;, a series which like &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; was cancelled on its initial run, but featured movie versions later on. The series is known for its darker story elements. Tomino followed up with a more light-hearted series called &quot;Xabungle&quot;, but the darker nature of &quot;Ideon&quot; continued with 1983&#x27;s &quot;Aura Battler Dunbine&quot;.

In 1984, Tomino released &quot;Heavy Metal L-Gaim&quot;. The following year, Tomino directed the first sequel to 1979&#x27;s &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;, &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot;. Tomino&#x27;s involvement in the following Gundam series, 1986&#x27;s &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ&quot; created an upbeat, comedic theme whereas the earlier Gundam&#x27;s are of a darker theme. In 1988, Tomino concluded the saga begun in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; with the &quot;Gundam&quot; motion picture &quot;Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot;.

===1990s and 2000s===

Tomino directed an additional Gundam motion picture, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam F91&quot; in 1991. This movie, which took place 30 years after &quot;Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot;, re-launched the Gundam saga in a new direction by featuring a completely new cast.

In 1993, Tomino directed his next Gundam series, &quot;Victory Gundam&quot;, which (like &quot;F91&quot; before) attempted to relaunch the Gundam saga with a completely new cast.

In 1996, Tomino wrote and directed &quot;Garzey&#x27;s Wing&quot;, and in 1998 wrote and directed &quot;Brain Powerd&quot;. In 1999, he returned to Gundam with &quot;Turn A Gundam&quot; and in 2002, directed two compilations movies for it entitled &quot;Turn A Gundam I: Earth Light&quot; and &quot;Turn A Gundam II: Moonlight Butterfly&quot;. Also in 2002, he directed &quot;Overman King Gainer&quot;, and in 2005, Tomino directed 3 compilation movies summarizing the events of 1985&#x27;s &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot;. His next major original work in the 2000s was the 6-episode OVA &quot;The Wings of Rean&quot;, which first premiered on the Internet across Bandai Channel, the broadcast beginning from December 12, 2005, with the final episode starting on August 18, 2006. Also in 2006, Tomino made a special cameo appearance in Shinji Higuchi&#x27;s tokusatsu film &quot;Sinking of Japan&quot;.

At the 2009 CESA Developers Conference, Tomino used his keynote speech to criticize the gaming industry, citing that video games &quot;bringing no productivity at all&quot; and that &quot;consoles are just consuming electricity&quot;, while stressing that game developers need to focus more on quality content rather than advanced technology, comparing it to the modern animation industry. His surprising remarks have sparked mass discussions online.

After working on the CGI short &quot;Ring of Gundam&quot; for Gundam&#x27;s 30th anniversary in 2009, Tomino returned to the franchise again for its 35th anniversary in 2014 in a new work in which he wrote and directed, &quot;Gundam Reconguista in G&quot;.

The Anime Tourism Association, founded in 2016, has Tomino serving as its president.

Tomino was present at Gundam Factory Yokohama for the opening ceremony of the 18-meter &quot;life-size&quot; moving statue of Gundam in Yokohama.

He went on to study at Yale College, but he had to quit playing American Football after severely injuring his knees. After giving up football, he turned to the Yale Dramatic Society and began acting. While at Yale, he was a member of Skull and Bones, and was among the founders of the Yale radio station (the student-run WOCD-AM, later renamed WYBC-AM). Whitmore planned on becoming a lawyer and graduated with a major in government from Yale University.

After further training he was assigned to the 4th Marine Division on Saipan in July 1944. While at Tinian, he contracted amoebic dysentery and was hospitalized. Following his hospitalization, he served guard duty at the Panama Canal Zone until his discharge in March 1946.

== Career ==
=== Film and television ===
Whitmore appeared on Broadway in the role of the sergeant in &quot;Command Decision.&quot; His first major picture for MGM was &quot;Battleground,&quot; in a role that was turned down by Spencer Tracy. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for this role, and won the Golden Globe Award as Best Performance by an Actor In A Supporting Role. Other major films included &quot;Angels in the Outfield,&quot; &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot;, &quot;The Next Voice You Hear&quot;, &quot;Above and Beyond&quot;, &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot;, &quot;Them!&quot;, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, &quot;Black Like Me&quot;, &quot;Guns of the Magnificent Seven&quot;, &quot;Tora!

Whitmore appeared during the 1950s on many television anthology series.

Other roles followed on &quot;Jane Wyman Presents the Fireside Theater&quot;, &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;, &quot;Kraft Theatre&quot;, &quot;Studio One in Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Matinee Theatre&quot;, and the &quot;Ford Television Theatre.&quot; In 1958, he carried the lead in &quot;The Gabe Carswell Story&quot; of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, with Ward Bond.(S1 E18 which aired 1/14/1958).
In 1963, Whitmore played Captain William Benteen in &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;On Thursday We Leave for Home&quot;. Whitmore also appeared in &quot;Route 66&quot; on January 18, 1963, as Ralph Vincent in “A Gift for a Warrior.” He appeared twice in &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot;. In 1965, Whitmore guest-starred as Col. Paul &quot;Pappy&quot; Hartley in Season 1, Episode 32 &quot;The Hero&quot; and as Col. Harry Connelly in 1966 Season 3, Episode 12 &quot;The Ace&quot;. He also appeared in an episode of &quot;Combat!&quot; titled &quot;The Cassock&quot;, as a German officer masquerading as a Catholic priest. In 1967, he guest-starred as a security guard in &quot;The Invaders&quot; episode, &quot;Quantity: Unknown&quot;. That same year, Whitmore also appeared on an episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Custer&quot; starring Wayne Maunder in the title role.

In 1968, he appeared as head of the Simian Assembly in the &quot;Planet of the Apes.&quot; In 1969, he played the leading character of Professor Woodruff in the TV series &quot;My Friend Tony,&quot; produced by NBC. Whitmore also made several memorable appearances on the classic ABC Western &quot;The Big Valley&quot; starring Barbara Stanwyck, and the classic NBC Western &quot;The Virginian&quot; starring James Drury, during the second half of the 1960s.

From 1972 to 1973, Whitmore played Dr. Vincent Campanelli in the short-lived ABC medical sitcom &quot;Temperatures Rising&quot;.

Whitmore appeared as General Oliver O. Howard in the 1975 television film &quot;I Will Fight No More Forever&quot;, based on the 1877 conflict between the United States Army and the Nez Percé tribe, led by Chief Joseph. In 1979, Whitmore hosted a talk show of 22 episodes called simply &quot;Comeback.&quot; One of those segments focuses on the helicopter inventor Igor Sikorsky. In 1980 he starred as Borski, a therapist treating imprisoned sex-offenders, in the made-for-television movie &quot;Rage!&quot; directed by William A. Graham. In 1980, Whitmore appeared as Jake Reeves the terminally ill father of coach Reeves in a two episode arc of the television series &quot;White Shadow.&quot; In 1986, Whitmore voiced Mark Twain in the first claymation feature film &quot;The Adventures of Mark Twain&quot;.

In 1994, Whitmore appeared in the role of prison librarian Brooks Hatlen in the critically acclaimed and Academy Award-nominated Frank Darabont film &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman; Whitmore received much praise for his poignant portrayal of Brooks, the old con and his performance won him a legion of new fans. Two years later, he co-starred in the 1997 horror/sci-fi film &quot;The Relic.&quot; In 1999, he played Raymond Oz in two episodes of &quot;The Practice,&quot; earning an Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.

In 2002, Whitmore played the role of the grandfather in the Disney Channel original film &quot;A Ring of Endless Light&quot;.

In 2003, Whitmore appeared as Josh Brolin&#x27;s father on the short-lived NBC drama series &quot;Mister Sterling&quot;, for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award.

In April 2007, he made his last screen appearance in a &quot;&quot; episode titled &quot;Ending Happy&quot; as Milton, an elderly man.

=== Theatre work ===
&quot;Whitmore often said he found acting in films and television boring because of the long waits between scenes; his passion was for the theater, and he continued to act on stage throughout his long career.&quot; Whitmore first ventured into acting at Yale University – severe knee injuries sidelined him from football, so he turned to the Yale Dramatic Society. After serving in the Marines he toured the South Pacific in a USO tour, then returned to America, where he studied acting for six months at the American Theatre Wing in New York and the Actors Studio. Afterward, he was hired by a summer stock company in Peterborough, New Hampshire – The Peterborough Players. In 1947 he was selected to appear in a production of &quot;All My Sons&quot;, representing the U.S. at the World Youth Festival in Prague.

His first play on Broadway – &quot;Command Decision&quot; – in which Whitmore played the part of Tech Sergeant Harold Evans, was the smash hit of 1947, and Whitmore received a non-competitive Special Tony Award for &quot;Best Newcomer of the Season&quot;. Whitmore continued to be active in the theatre for all of his career, performing on Broadway, at Ford&#x27;s Theatre in Washington DC, and on tour. He later won the title &quot;King of the One Man Show&quot; after appearing in the solo vehicles &quot;Will Rogers&#x27; USA&quot; (1970) (repeating the role for TV in 1972); as Harry Truman in &quot;Give &#x27;em Hell, Harry!&quot; (1975) (repeating the role in the film version, for which he was nominated for an Oscar); and as Theodore Roosevelt in &quot;Bully&quot; (1977), although the latter production did not repeat the success of the first two.

&quot;Whitmore, who was an early student at the Actors Studio in New York in the late &#x27;40s, taught an acting workshop after moving to Hollywood. Among his students in the early &#x27;50s was young James Dean, whom Whitmore advised to go to New York. &#x27;I owe a lot to Whitmore,&#x27; Dean told &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine in 1955. &#x27;One thing he said helped more than anything. He told me I didn&#x27;t know the difference between acting as a soft job and acting as a difficult art.&#x27;&quot; Whitmore often returned to New Hampshire to the Peterborough Players, where he got his start in summer stock – in 2008 he played the stage manager in &quot;Our Town.&quot; Each year the Peterborough Players award the &quot;James Whitmore Award&quot; to an excellent intern at the theatre.

== Personal life ==
 Whitmore married his first wife, Nancy Mygatt, in 1947. The couple had three sons before their divorce in 1971. The eldest son, James III, found success as a television actor and director under the name James Whitmore Jr. The second son, Stephen, became the public spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department. The youngest son, Daniel, was a Forest Service Snow Ranger and firefighter before he launched his own construction company. In 1979, Whitmore and Mygatt remarried, but they divorced again after two years.

Whitmore was married to actress Audra Lindley from 1972 until 1979. He co-starred in several stage performances with her both during and after their marriage. These included &quot;Elba&quot; (a play by Vaughn McBride about an elderly couple who escape from their nursing home); William Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Handy Dandy&quot; (he as a conservative judge, she as a liberal nun); and Tom Cole&#x27;s &quot;About Time&quot; (in which they played characters identified simply as the Old Man and the Old Woman).

In 2001, he married actress and author Noreen Nash. Whitmore is the grandfather of &quot;&quot; contestant Matty Whitmore. In 2010, James Whitmore Jr., and his two children (grandchildren of James Whitmore), actress-director Aliah Whitmore and artist-production designer Jacob Whitmore, formed the theatre group Whitmore Eclectic. They perform in Los Angeles, California.

In his later years, Whitmore spent his summers in Peterborough, New Hampshire, performing with the Peterborough Players.

A Democrat, he supported the campaign of Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election. Although he was not always politically active, in 2007, Whitmore generated some publicity with his endorsement of Barack Obama for U.S. President. In January 2008, Whitmore appeared in television commercials for the First Freedom First campaign, which advocates preserving &quot;the separation of church and state&quot; and protecting religious liberty.

According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;An avid flower and vegetable gardener, Whitmore was also known to TV viewers as the longtime commercial pitchman for Miracle-Gro garden products.&quot;

He had a cat called Monkey, whose playful photos are preserved in LIFE photo collection in New York.

== Death ==
Whitmore was diagnosed with lung cancer in November 2008. He died from the disease at the age of 87 on February 6, 2009, at his Malibu, California home.

<text>Give &#x27;em Hell, Harry! is a biographical play and 1975 film, written by playwright Samuel Gallu. Both the play and film are a one-man show about former President of the United States Harry S. Truman. &quot;Give &#x27;em Hell, Harry!&quot; stars James Whitmore, and was directed by Steve Binder and Peter H. Hunt.

==Title origin==
The title comes from an incident that took place during the 1948 presidential election campaign. In Bremerton, Washington, Truman delivered a speech attacking the Republicans. During the speech, a supporter yelled out, &quot;Give &#x27;em Hell, Harry!&quot; Truman replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t give them Hell. I just tell the truth about them, and they think it&#x27;s Hell.&quot; Subsequently, &quot;Give &#x27;em Hell, Harry!&quot; became a lifetime slogan for Truman supporters.

==History==
The play previewed in Hershey, Pennsylvania, followed by its official opening at Ford&#x27;s Theatre in Washington, D. C. Its April 17, 1975, premiere was hosted by Truman&#x27;s daughter Margaret, and attended by President Gerald Ford. The play then went on to a six-city tour, during which it was videotaped for film on the stage of the Moore Theatre in Seattle, using a live editing process called &quot;Theatrovision&quot;. It was also recorded and released by United Artists Records.

Although the play has been regularly revived, it did not make its New York debut until July 2008 at St. Luke&#x27;s Theatre. Clifton Truman Daniel portrayed his grandfather in the title role in several performances in 2023.

==Accolades==
&quot;Give &#x27;em Hell, Harry!&quot; is only the third film to have its entire credited cast (Whitmore) nominated for an Oscar, the first two being &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; in 1966, for which almost all members excluding the extras were nominated, and &quot;Sleuth&quot; in 1972.

<doc id="163486" wikidata="Q1086616" url="?curid=163486" title="Christopher Cross (album)">
<text>Christopher Cross is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Christopher Cross, released on December 27, 1979, by Warner Bros. Records. Produced by Michael Omartian and recorded in mid-1979, the album was one of the first in popular music to be digitally recorded, utilizing the 3M Digital Recording System.

Cited as one of the most influential soft rock albums of the late 1970s and early 1980s, it won five Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist, with Cross becoming the first artist to win the four major categories in the same year — a feat not replicated until Billie Eilish in 2020.

== Reception ==
According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the album was &quot;a huge hit and widely acclaimed, at least among industry professionals (critics didn&#x27;t give it a second listen), leading to multi-platinum success and Grammys.&quot; In his retrospective review for AllMusic, Erlewine says that while its success as a soft rock album has little cachet with most listeners, it &quot;remains one of the best mainstream albums of its time&quot; because of consistent song quality and Cross&#x27;s skillful musicianship: &quot;Yes, he does favor sentimentality and can be very sweet on the ballads, but his melodicism is rich and construction tight, so there&#x27;s a sturdy foundation for the classy professional gloss provided by his studio pros and friends, including indelible backing vocals by Michael McDonald.&quot;

In retrospective appraisals, &quot;Christopher Cross&quot; is regarded as a key release of yacht rock music. For &quot;Spin&quot; in 2009, Chuck Eddy lists it among the genre&#x27;s eight essential albums. &quot;Vinyl Me, Please&quot; magazine&#x27;s Timothy Malcolm includes it in his 2017 list of the 10 best yacht rock albums, explaining that, &quot;It’s actually a sonic outlier for the yacht rock genre, heavy on acoustic guitar and strings. But its message fits the genre (a fool searching for inner peace), and yeah, it’s still undeniably smooth.&quot; For The Vinyl District&#x27;s online publication in 2018, Michael H. Little calls it the genre&#x27;s best album as well as one of its smoothest, crediting it for making Cross &quot;the face of soft rock&quot;.

<text>Giancarlo Giannini (; born 1 August 1942) is an Italian actor and voice actor. He won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor for his performance in &quot;Love and Anarchy&quot; (1973) and received an Academy Award nomination for &quot;Seven Beauties&quot; (1975). He is also a four-time recipient of the David di Donatello Award for Best Actor.

Giannini began his career on stage, starring in Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s productions of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. After appearing predominantly on television throughout the early 1960s, he had his first lead role in a film in &quot;Rita the Mosquito&quot; (1965), the first of many collaborations with filmmaker Lina Wertmüller. He rose to international stardom through Wertmüller&#x27;s &quot;The Seduction of Mimi&quot; (1972), &quot;Love and Anarchy&quot; (1973), &quot;Swept Away&quot; (1974), culminating in his Oscar-nominated turn in &quot;Seven Beauties&quot; (1975).

His other films include &quot;The Innocent&quot; (1976), &quot;Lili Marleen&quot; (1980), &quot;New York Stories&quot; (1990), &quot;A Walk in the Clouds&quot; (1995), &quot;Hannibal&quot; (2001), &quot;Man on Fire&quot; (2004), and the James Bond films &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (2006) and &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; (2008). He is also a dubbing artist, contributing voice work to the Italian-language versions of dozens of films since the 1960s. He has been the official Italian dubber of Al Pacino since 1975, and has also dubbed Jack Nicholson, Michael Douglas, and Helmut Berger.

== Early life ==
Giannini was born in La Spezia and he spent most of his childhood in the settlement of Pitelli. In 1952, Giannini and his family moved to Naples where he received a diploma in electronic engineering at the Alessandro Volta Technological State Technical Institute. During his teen years, he moved to Rome and studied at the Accademia Nazionale di Arte Drammatica Silvio D&#x27;Amico.

== Acting career ==

=== Stage ===
Giannini made his stage debut at the age of 18, opposite Lilla Brignone in &quot;In memoria di una signora amica&quot;, directed by Giuseppe Patroni Griffi. His breakthrough came when he was cast by Franco Zeffirelli in a production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; which played at The Old Vic.

=== Film and television ===

Giannini made his film debut in a small part in &quot;I criminali della metropoli&quot; in 1965.

<text>Seven Beauties (, &quot;Pasqualino Sevenbeauties&quot;) is a 1975 historical black comedy drama Italian film written and directed by Lina Wertmüller and starring Giancarlo Giannini, Fernando Rey, and Shirley Stoler.

Written by Wertmüller, the film is about an Italian everyman who deserts the army during World War II, is captured by the Germans and sent to a prison camp, where he does anything he can to survive. Through flashbacks, we learn about his seven unattractive sisters, his accidental murder of one sister&#x27;s lover, his imprisonment in an insane asylum—where he rapes a patient—and his volunteering to be a soldier to escape confinement.

For her work on the film, Wertmüller became the first woman nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director. The film received three other Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Foreign Language Film. It also received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Foreign Film.

The production design and costume design are by Wertmüller&#x27;s husband, Enrico Job.

==Plot==
The picaresque story follows its protagonist, Pasqualino (Giannini), a dandy and small-time hood in Naples in Fascist and World War II-era Italy.

To defend his family&#x27;s honor, Pasqualino kills a pimp who had turned his sister into a prostitute. To dispose of the victim&#x27;s body, he dismembers it and places the parts in suitcases. Caught by the police, he confesses to the murder, but successfully pleads insanity and is sentenced to 12 years in a psychiatric ward. Desperate to get out, he volunteers for the Italian Army. With an Italian comrade, he eventually deserts the army, but they are captured and sent to a German concentration camp.

Pasqualino attempts to survive the camp by providing sexual favors to the female commandant (Stoler). His plan succeeds, but the commandant puts Pasqualino in charge of his barracks as a kapo. He is told he must select six men from his barracks to be killed to prevent all from being killed. Pasqualino ends up executing his former Army comrade, and is responsible for the death of another fellow prisoner, a Spanish anarchist.

At the war&#x27;s end, upon his return to Naples, Pasqualino discovers that his seven sisters, his fiancée, and even his mother have all survived by becoming prostitutes. Unfazed, he insists on marrying his fiancée as soon as possible.

==Cast==
* Giancarlo Giannini as Pasqualino Frafuso, a.k.a. Settebellezze
* Fernando Rey as Pedro, the anarchist prisoner
* Shirley Stoler as the prison camp commandant
* Elena Fiore as Concettina, a sister
* Piero Di Iorio as Francesco, Pasqualino&#x27;s comrade

* Ermelinda De Felice as Pasqualino&#x27;s mother
* Bianca D&#x27;Origlia as the psychiatrist

==Production==
===Casting===
Giannini starred in three other films Wertmüller made during this period: &quot;The Seduction of Mimi&quot; (1972), &quot;Love and Anarchy&quot; (1973), and &quot;Swept Away&quot; (1974).

===Filming locations===
&quot;Seven Beauties&quot; was filmed on location in Naples, Campania, Italy.

===Opening sequence===
In the opening sequence of &quot;Seven Beauties&quot;, spoken over World War II archival footage showing the destruction of cities and men, Wertmüller defines the object of her critique—a &quot;particular petty bourgeois social type&quot;.
==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film&#x27;s subject is survival. At the time of its release, it was controversial for its graphic depiction of Nazi concentration camps. In his 1976 essay &quot;Surviving&quot;, Bruno Bettelheim, while admiring the film&#x27;s artistry, severely criticized its depiction of the experience of concentration camp survivors. Bettelheim&#x27;s own views about concentration camps have likewise been critiqued.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 67% based reviews from 21 critics, and an average rating of 8/10. In April 2019, a restored version of the film was selected to be shown in the Cannes Classics section at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival.

<doc id="163494" wikidata="Q1347946" url="?curid=163494" title="Equus (play)">
<text>Equus is a 1973 play by Peter Shaffer, about a child psychiatrist who attempts to treat a young man who has a pathological religious fascination with horses.

Shaffer was inspired to write &quot;Equus&quot; when he heard of a crime involving a 17-year-old boy who blinded six horses in a small town in northern England. He set out to construct a fictional account of what might have caused the incident, without knowing any of the details of the crime, and to evoke the same &quot;air of mystery&quot; and &quot;numinous&quot; qualities as his 1964 play &quot;The Royal Hunt of the Sun&quot; but in a more modern setting. The narrative of the play follows Dr. Martin Dysart&#x27;s attempts to understand the cause of the boy&#x27;s (Alan Strang) actions while wrestling with his own sense of purpose and the nature of his work.

The original stage production ran at the National Theatre in London from 1973 to 1975, directed by John Dexter. Alec McCowen played Dysart, and Peter Firth played Alan Strang. The first Broadway production starred Anthony Hopkins as Dysart (later played by Richard Burton, Leonard Nimoy, and Anthony Perkins) and Peter Firth as Alan. When Firth left for Broadway, Dai Bradley took over the role of Alan in the London production, playing opposite Michael Jayston as Dr. Dysart. Tom Hulce later replaced Firth during the Broadway run. The Broadway production ran for 1,209 performances. Marian Seldes appeared in every single performance of the Broadway run, first in the role of Hesther and then as Dora. Shaffer would later adapt the play for a 1977 film of the same name directed by Sidney Lumet.

The narrative centres on religious and ritual sacrifice themes, as well as the manner in which Strang constructs a personal theology involving the horses and the godhead &quot;Equus&quot;. Alan sees the horses as representative of God and confuses his adoration of his &quot;God&quot; with sexual attraction. Also important is Shaffer&#x27;s examination of the conflict between personal values and satisfaction and societal mores, expectations, and institutions, and between Apollonian and Dionysian values and systems.

== Plot summary ==

===Act 1===

Martin Dysart is a psychiatrist working in a psychiatric hospital. He begins with a monologue in which he outlines the case of 17-year-old Alan Strang, who has blinded six horses. He divulges his feeling that his occupation is not all that he wishes it to be and his dissatisfaction and disappointment with his life. Dysart finds that the supply of troubled young people for him to &quot;adjust&quot; back into &quot;normal&quot; living is never-ending, but he doubts the value of treating these youths, since they will simply return to a dull, normal life that lacks any commitment or &quot;worship&quot;. He comments that while Strang&#x27;s crime was extreme, just such extremity is needed to break free from the chains of existence.

A court magistrate, Hesther Saloman, visits Dysart, believing that he has the skills to help Alan come to terms with what he did. At the hospital, Dysart struggles to engage with Alan, who at first responds to questioning by singing TV advertising jingles.

Dysart reveals a dream he has had, in a Homeric Grecian setting, in which he is a public official presiding over a mass ritual sacrifice. One after another, he slices open the abdomens of hundreds of children and pulls out their entrails. He becomes disgusted with what he is doing, but fears being murdered in the same manner if discovered as a &quot;non-believer&quot; by the other priests, and so continues. Eventually the other priests become aware of his misgivings and grab the knife from his hand, at which point he awakens from the dream.

Dysart interviews Alan&#x27;s parents. He learns that, from an early age, Alan has been receiving conflicting views on religion from his parents. Alan&#x27;s mother, Dora, is a devout Christian who has read to him daily from the Bible, but this practice has antagonized Alan&#x27;s father Frank, a non-believer.

Slowly, Dysart makes contact with Alan by playing a game where each of them asks a question, which must be answered honestly.

Dysart learns that Frank, concerned that Alan was taking far too much interest in the more violent aspects of the Bible, destroyed a violent picture of the crucifixion of Jesus that Alan had hung at the foot of his bed. Alan then replaced the picture with one of a horse, with large, staring eyes.

Alan reveals to Dysart that, during his youth, his attraction to horses came about by way of his mother&#x27;s Biblical tales, a horse story that she had read to him, Western films, and his grandfather&#x27;s interest in horses and riding. Alan&#x27;s sexual education began with his mother, who told him that he could find true love and contentment by way of religious devotion and marriage. During this time, Alan also began to develop a sexual attraction to horses, desiring to pet their coats, feel their muscular bodies, and smell their sweat. Alan reveals to Dysart that he had first encountered a horse at age six, on the beach. A rider approached him, and took him up on the horse. Alan was visibly excited, but his parents found him and Frank pulled him violently off the horse; the horse rider scoffed at Frank and rode off.

Dysart hypnotizes Alan, during which he reveals elements of his dream about human sacrifice. He begins to jog Alan&#x27;s memory by filling in blanks and asking questions. Alan reveals that he wants to help captive horses by removing the bit, which enslaves them.

After turning 17, Alan took a job working in a shop selling electrical goods, where he met Jill Mason, an outgoing and free-spirited young woman who works for a local stable owner. She visited the shop wanting to purchase blades for horse-clippers, which piqued Alan&#x27;s interest. Jill suggested that Alan work for Harry Dalton, the owner of the stables, to which Alan agreed.

Dysart meets with Dalton, who tells him that he first held Alan to be a model worker, since he kept the stables immaculately clean and groomed the horses, including one named Nugget. Through Dysart&#x27;s questioning, it becomes clear that Alan is erotically fixated on Nugget (or &quot;Equus&quot;) and secretly takes him for midnight rides, bareback and naked. Alan envisions himself as a king astride the godhead Equus, both destroying their enemies.

===Act 2===

Dysart gives Alan a placebo &quot;truth pill&quot;. Revealing a tryst with Jill, Alan begins to re-enact the event:

Jill, who has taken an interest in Alan, asks him to take her to an adult movie theater. While there, they run into Frank. Alan is traumatized, particularly when he realizes that his father is lying to justify his presence in the theatre; however, this allows Alan to realize that sex is a natural thing for all men, even his father. Alan walks Jill home after they leave and she convinces Alan to come to the stables with her.

Once there, Jill seduces Alan and the two undress and attempt to have sex. However, Alan hesitates when he hears the horses making noises in the stables beneath, and he is unable to get an erection. Jill tries to ask Alan what the problem is, but he shouts at her to leave. After Jill dresses and walks out of the stables, the still-nude Alan begs the horses for forgiveness.

&quot;Mine!...You&#x27;re mine!...I am yours and you are mine!&quot; cries Equus through Dysart&#x27;s voice, but then he becomes threatening: &quot;The Lord thy God is a jealous God,&quot; Equus/Dysart seethes, &quot;He sees you, he sees you forever and ever, Alan. He sees you!...He sees you!&quot; Alan screams, &quot;God seest!&quot; and then says &quot;No more. No more, Equus!&quot; Alan then uses a steel spike to blind the six horses in the stable, whose eyes have &quot;seen&quot; his very soul.

In the final scene, Dysart delivers a monologue questioning the fundamentals of his practice and whether his methods will help Alan, as the effect of his treatment will make him &quot;normal&quot;, but at the cost of his humanity.

== Original Broadway production ==
The play opened on Broadway at the Plymouth Theatre on 24 October 1974, ending on 11 September 1976. It then opened at the Helen Hayes Theatre on 5 October 1976, ending on 2 October 1977, for a total of 1,209 performances.

== Film adaptation ==

Shaffer adapted the play for a 1977 film starring Richard Burton, Peter Firth, Eileen Atkins, Colin Blakely, Joan Plowright, and Jenny Agutter, directed by Sidney Lumet. Unlike stage productions, where the horses are portrayed by human actors, often muscular men wearing tribal-style masks, Lumet did not believe this could adequately be done in a film version &quot;because the reality he [Alan] was being watched he was going to create the dilemma within him.&quot;

Comparing the film to the play, English professor James M. Welsh felt using real horses in the film was understandable, but argued the outdoor scenes infringed on the &quot;abstract theatrical design&quot; that gave the play its creativity. Welsh also felt the explicit depiction of the blinding was &quot;potentially repulsive&quot; and that &quot;much of the spirit of the play is lost as a consequence.&quot;

== Revivals ==
The first Midwest U.S. production of &quot;Equus&quot; opened March 1978 in Lansing, Michigan, at Boarshead Theatre. Directed by John Peakes, it featured Richard Thomsen as Dysart, David Kropp as Alan, Carmen Decker as Dora, and Lisa Hodge as Jill. Local controversy over the nude scene was largely mitigated by casting a married couple as Jill and Alan. This production went on to win Boarshead Theatre&#x27;s annual awards for Best Production and Best Supporting Actor (Kropp).

The Lovegrove Alley Theatre of Baltimore staged a production of &quot;Equus&quot; in 1979. The production starred a pre-Broadway Charles S. Dutton in the role of Dysart. Director Brad Mays did double duty in the role of Alan Strang. Lauren Raher played Jill Mason, and her real-life mother Rhona Raher portrayed Dora, Alan&#x27;s mother.
West End producers David Pugh and Dafydd Rogers revived &quot;Equus&quot; in 2007, starring Richard Griffiths, Daniel Radcliffe, and Joanna Christie in the leading roles. The production was directed by Thea Sharrock, and opened in February 2007 at the Gielgud Theatre. The production attracted press attention since both Radcliffe and Griffiths had starred in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series (as Harry Potter and Vernon Dursley, respectively). In particular, the casting of seventeen-year-old Radcliffe triggered some controversy since the role of Alan Strang required him to appear nude onstage. Radcliffe insisted that the nude scene was not &quot;gratuitous&quot;, and that he should portray the character and the scene as called for by the script. This revival was subsequently transferred to Broadway, running at the Broadhurst Theatre through 8 February 2009. Radcliffe and Griffiths reprised their roles, and Thea Sharrock returned as director. The cast also included Kate Mulgrew, Anna Camp, Carolyn McCormick, Lorenzo Pisoni, T. Ryder Smith, Graeme Malcolm, and Sandra Shipley, with Collin Baja, Tyrone Jackson, Spencer Liff, Adesola Osakalumi, and Marc Spaulding. Radcliffe was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Play.

The first illustrated edition of the play text was produced as a large-format artist&#x27;s book by the Old Stile Press, with images and an afterword by the British artist Clive Hicks-Jenkins, in 2009.

City Lights Theater Company of San Jose, California revived &quot;Equus&quot; in March 2011. This production, featuring actors Sean Gilvary as Alan Strang and Steve Lambert as Martin Dysart, received rave reviews. The &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; labelled Gilvary and Lambert as &quot;haunting,&quot; stating Gilvary &quot;...exposing emotions and epidermis, rides bareback in every sense. He gradually manages to make a rather unattractive young creature seem not only sympathetic but redeemable while retaining his hostility and humanity.&quot; &quot;StarkInsider&quot; rated the production 4.5 out of 5 stars, calling Lambert &quot;superb&quot; and having a &quot;pitch-perfect performance,&quot; while calling Gilvary &quot;dazzling&quot; and having &quot;a preternatural ability to inhabit the very soul of his character. Like the troubled teen that he portrays, both he and Strang possess a passion for something that is an inseparable part of their personality.&quot; This production received a Standout Classic Production Award by Silicon Valley Small Theatre Awards.

&quot;Equus&quot; was revived in Houston for a limited run in July 2014 at Frenetic Theater. The production was largely funded by donations on Kickstarter and was well received by critics and audiences alike. &quot;Broadway World&quot; called the production &quot;dark, daunting and sensual&quot; and commending its &quot;stellar cast&quot;. &quot;Houston Press&quot; said it was &quot;astonishingly good... a must see&quot; while Culturemap listed the show as one of the &quot;hottest&quot; of the year.

<doc id="163500" wikidata="Q249782" url="?curid=163500" title="A Special Day">
<text>A Special Day () is a 1977 period drama film directed and co-written by Ettore Scola, produced by Carlo Ponti, and starring Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. Set in Rome in 1938, its narrative follows a housewife (Loren) and her neighbor (Mastroianni) who stay home the day Adolf Hitler visits Benito Mussolini. 

Themes addressed in the film include gender roles, fascism, and the persecution of homosexuals under the Mussolini regime.

An Italian-Canadian co-production, the film premiered at the 1977 Cannes Film Festival. It earned several accolades and nominations, including David di Donatello Awards for Best Director (Scola) and Best Actress (Loren), a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film, and two Oscar nominations, for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actor (Mastroianni). 

In 2008, the film was included on the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage’s 100 Italian films to be saved, a list of 100 films that &quot;have changed the collective memory of the country between 1942 and 1978.&quot;

==Plot==

On 4 May 1938, the day Hitler visits Mussolini in Rome, Antonietta, a naïve, sentimental and overworked homemaker, stays home doing her usual domestic tasks, while her fascist husband, Emanuele, and their six spoiled children take to the streets to follow a parade. The building is empty, except for the caretaker Pauletta, and a neighbor across the complex, a charming man named Gabriele. He is a radio broadcaster who has been dismissed from his job and is about to be deported to Sardinia because of his homosexuality and alleged anti-fascist stance. 

After the family&#x27;s myna escapes from their apartment and flies outside Gabriele&#x27;s window, Antonietta shows up at his door, asking to be let in to reach the bird. Gabriele has been interrupted from attempting suicide, but helps rescue the myna by offering it food, and is amused by the episode. Antonietta is surprised by his demeanor and, unaware of his sexual orientation, flirts and dances the rumba with him.

Despite their differences, they warm to each other. Pauletta warns Antonietta that Gabriele is an anti-fascist, which Antonietta finds despicable. Gabriele eventually opens up, confessing he was fired because he is a homosexual. Antonietta confides in him her troubles with her arrogant and unfaithful husband; who, she says, has shown a preference for an educated woman. 

Throughout their interaction and conversation, each realize that the other is oppressed by social and governmental conditioning and come to form a new impression than the one they first drew from one another. As a result, they have sex, but for different reasons. Gabriele explains that this changes nothing; as does Antonietta. (However, later, when her son reminds his mother of all the newspaper clippings she will have from the parade for her album collection, Antonietta&#x27;s face reveals a look of slight indifference.) Soon after their intimate encounter, Antonietta&#x27;s family comes back home and Gabriele is arrested. 

At the end, Antonietta sits near the window and starts reading a book Gabriele has given to her (&quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;). She watches as her lover leaves the complex, escorted by fascist policemen, before turning off the light and retiring to bed: Her husband is waiting there for her in order to beget their seventh child, whom he wants to name Adolfo.

==Cast==
== Themes ==
Much of the film&#x27;s themes revolve around gender roles and the model of masculinity under fascist Italy. Antonietta is the &quot;donna madre&quot;, a mother figure who meets her feminine responsibilities in the regime by having six children, boasting one more will secure her the government bonus established for large families in 1933. The Fascist regime equates homosexuality with depopulation, and thus, Gabriele is suspected of treason. The bachelor tax of 1926 was a measure against this, and Gabriele has to pay it. While the stay-at-home mother and homosexual neighbor would seem to be an improbable pairing, both are minimized by the regime, and find comfort and some sympathy in each other. At the end of the film, domestic life will continue as usual, but &quot;inner resistance&quot; to Fascism has been awakened.

==Production==

Maurizio Costanzo, Ruggero Maccari and Ettore Scola wrote the screenplay, after Maccari had learned about an incident in Fascist Italy in which homosexuals were arrested and taken to Sardinia. Particularly, the story of broadcaster Nunzio Filogamo was an inspiration to the story, as Filogamo always had to carry a certificate stating he was not homosexual.

The actors selected for the roles defied type casting, as Marcello Mastroianni was often seen in previous roles as &quot;the prototype of the Italian Latin lover,&quot; and Sophia Loren was perceived as a sexy Italian celebrity. Along with &quot;Il bell&#x27;Antonio&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Talk About It&quot;, this is one of Mastroianni&#x27;s roles critiquing the Italian masculine figure as the incompetent character falling behind an evolving society.

Due to the abundance of news coverage of Hitler&#x27;s visit to Rome in 1938, the filmmakers had plenty of footage to write a screenplay around. The public service film &quot;The Führer&#x27;s Trip to Italy&quot; was especially mined for footage. Faced with a lack of funding from Italian producers, the filmmakers persuaded investors in Canada to support the project. Canafox, a company based in Montreal, co-produced.

A number of unusual cinematic techniques are used in this film. A long take scene introduces Antonietta and her family: the camera enters through the kitchen window and moves into the rooms. Deep focus is utilized in a scene in which the camera is in Antonietta&#x27;s room with her in the frame, and through a distant window Gabriele can simultaneously be seen moving in his house in the same frame. In post production cinematic color grading was applied to the film to give it muted sepia tones throughout.

==Release==
The film screened at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1977. It also played in New York City in September 1977.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film received praise from critics in Italy and throughout Europe on its release. &quot;A Special Day&quot; has an approval rating of 100% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 10 reviews, and an average rating of 8/10.

Vincent Canby, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, appreciated the film&#x27;s humor and humanity. The &quot;New York&quot; review states that while the celebrity of Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni would draw audiences in, they were too glamorous to play their characters, and thus, the film did not work.

In 2008, it was featured on the list of the 100 Italian films to be saved, chosen by a jury of film experts for preservation. In 2015, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; critic Deborah Young praised it as &quot;one of the most telling films ever made about Italian Fascism,&quot; which &quot;suggests a path that cuts through mass-think ideologies, one that anyone can follow with a little human solidarity and courage.&quot; Writing for the LGBT-oriented &quot;Out&quot;, Armond White said the film demonstrated empathy before falling into the mawkish, and Mastroianni was great. Mike D&#x27;Angelo of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave it a B−, saying the film became more powerful through its runtime, although there is less of a story. D&#x27;Angelo felt it was positive the sex between the protagonists is not claimed to convert Gabriele to heterosexuality.

===Awards and nominations===
The film competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or in the 1977 Cannes Film Festival, and while its bid was supported by a few festival co-ordinators, juror Roberto Rossellini successfully lobbied for &quot;Padre Padrone&quot; instead. At the 2014 Venice Film Festival, it won the award for Best Restored Film.

== Restoration ==
After a restoration by Cineteca Nazionale di Roma and Surf Film, the film was placed in the Venice Classics section in the 2014 Venice Film Festival. 

== Home media ==
In Region 1, The Criterion Collection released the film on Blu-ray on 13 October 2015.

==Stage adaptation==
An English-language stage adaptation, titled &quot;Working on a Special Day&quot;, had its U.S. Premiere in 2013 in an Off-Broadway production from Por Piedad Teatro and The Play Company. Mexican theatre artists Ana Graham and Antonio Vega co-directed and performed the roles of Antonietta and Gabriele, respectively.

<text>Andrei Nikolayevich Tupolev (; – 23 December 1972) was a Russian and later Soviet aeronautical engineer known for his pioneering aircraft designs as the director of the Tupolev Design Bureau.

Tupolev was an early pioneer of aeronautics in Russia and served as a protégé of Nikolay Zhukovsky. Tupolev designed or oversaw the design of more than 100 types of civilian and military aircraft in the Soviet Union over 50 years, some of which set 78 world records. Tupolev produced many notable designs such as the Tu-2, Tu-16, Tu-95, and Tu-104, and the reverse engineered Tu-4.

Tupolev was highly honoured in the Soviet Union and awarded various titles and honours including the Hero of Socialist Labor three times, Order of Lenin eight times, Order of the Red Banner of Labour two times, made an academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1953, and a Colonel-General of the Soviet Air Force in 1968. Tupolev was also honoured outside the Soviet Union as an honorary member of the British Royal Aeronautical Society and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in recognition of his work. In 2018, Vnukovo International Airport was formally renamed to Vnukovo Andrei Tupolev International Airport in his honour.

==Early life==


Andrei Nikolayevich Tupolev was born on in Pustomazovo (), a village near the city of Kimry in Tver Governorate, Russian Empire, the sixth of seven children born to his Russian parents. Tupolev&#x27;s father, Nikolai Ivanovich Tupolev (1842-1911), was a native of Surgut, who worked as a notary for the governorate. Nikolai had studied law at St. Petersburg University, but was expelled after the assassination of Alexander II for his ties to revolutionaries despite not being involved in their actions. Tupolev&#x27;s mother, Anna Vasilievna (née Lisitsyna) (1850-1928) was born in Torzhok in the family of a judicial investigator, and graduated from the Mariinsky Gymnasium in Tver. Anna&#x27;s parents purchased the small estate in Pustomazovo where Tupolev was born. After first being educated at home, Tupolev studied at the Gymnasium in Tver and finished in 1908. Tupolev then applied for courses at two Russian universities: Imperial Moscow Technical School (IMTU ) and the Emperor Nicholas II Moscow State University of Railway Engineering. Tupolev was accepted at both, but ultimately chose to attend at IMTU.

In 1909, Tupolev began studying aerodynamics under the Russian aviation pioneer Nikolay Zhukovsky, and volunteered for the Aeronautical workshop (&quot;Kruzhok&quot;) headed by Zhukovsky. In 1910, together with his workshop friends, Tupolev built and test piloted his first glider. During his workshop days, Tupolev also built a wind tunnel which led to the formation of an aerodynamic laboratory at IMTU. In 1911, Tupolev was accused of taking part in revolutionary activities, including demonstrations and distribution of subversive literature, and was arrested. Tupolev was later released on condition that he return to his family home in Pustomazovo. Tupolev was only allowed to return to IMTU in 1914, studying during World War I and the Russian Revolution. Tupolev completed his studies in 1918 and was awarded the degree of Engineer-Mechanic when he presented his thesis on the development of seaplanes. By 1920, the IMTU had been renamed the Moscow Higher Technical School (MVTU) and Tupolev was teaching a course there on the basics of aerodynamic calculations.

==Aircraft design==
===Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute===
Tupolev was a leading figure of the Moscow-based Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI; ) from 1929 until his death in 1972. The Central Design Office or TsKB () based there produced bombers for the Soviet Air Force and some airliners, which in the years before World War II and especially in his 1930s-era designs, were based partially on the all-metal aircraft design concepts pioneered by Hugo Junkers. In 1925, Tupolev designed a twin-engine bomber, the TB-1, which was considered one of the most advanced designs of the time. By 1934, Tupolev had led the design bureau that designed the largest aircraft flying in the world at the time, the 63-meter wingspan, eight-engined &quot;Maksim Gorki&quot;, again built with the Junkers metal structure airframe concepts. In 1937, an improved version of the earlier TB-1, the four-engined TB-3, made a landing at the North Pole. As the number of qualified aircraft designers increased, Tupolev set up his own office, producing a number of designs designated with the prefix ANT () from his initials.

===&quot;Sharashka&quot;===
However, on 21 October 1937, Tupolev was arrested together with Vladimir Petlyakov and the entire directorate of the TsAGI and EDO during the Great Purge on trumped up charges of sabotage, espionage and of aiding the Russian Fascist Party. Many of his colleagues were executed but Tupolev himself was imprisoned. In 1939, Tupolev was moved from a prison to an NKVD &quot;sharashka&quot; for aircraft designers in Bolshevo near Moscow, where many surviving ex-TsAGI people had already been sent to work. The &quot;sharashka&quot; soon moved to Moscow and was dubbed &quot;Tupolevka&quot; after Tupolev, its most prominent inmate. In 1940, Tupolev was tried and convicted with a ten-year sentence, and during this time he developed the Tupolev Tu-2 which would become one of the most important aircraft of World War II. Tupolev was released in July 1941 around the time of the German invasion of the Soviet Union to &quot;conduct important defence work&quot; but was not fully rehabilitated by the Soviet state until 1955, two years after Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death.

===Post-war===
Tupolev headed the B-4 project, as it was initially designated, to reverse engineer the American Boeing B-29 Superfortress strategic bomber, which had been the first aircraft to deliver a nuclear weapon. The Soviet Union had repeatedly asked for B-29s through the World War II Lend Lease program but these requests were all denied by the US. Tupolev succeeded in the complex task of re-engineering the design with Soviet engines, weapons, equipment and airfoil sections, while using available metric sheetmetal which required a nearly complete redesign as the original had been built to imperial measurements, while new alloys also had to be brought into production. They used four B-29s which had come down in Soviet controlled territory as references, after having sustained light damage while bombing Japan in 1945. Tupolev&#x27;s own design for the role had been ignored in the interest of getting the new long range bomber into service as rapidly as possible to respond to the multiple illegal American overflights, mostly with Martin PBM-5 Mariners that had already begun, and the overt threat of nuclear attack. Tupolev had several examples of the resulting Tu-4 flying in time for the 1947 May Day parade.

By the time of his rehabilitation on 9 April 1955, Tupolev had designed and was about to start testing his unique turboprop strategic bomber, the Tu-95. In the following years, Tupolev overcame competition from Vladimir Myasishchev and his M-4 series of jet-powered strategic bombers, to get the Tu-16 design into service. This was in part thanks to Tupolev&#x27;s close rapport with Nikita Khrushchev, the new leader of the Soviet Union who had denounced Stalin&#x27;s terror, of which Tupolev had been a victim. At about the same time, Tupolev introduced into service the Tu-104, the world&#x27;s second operational production jet airliner.

==Later years and death==
After Khruschev&#x27;s removal from office in late 1964 and the rise of Leonid Brezhnev, the ageing Tupolev gradually lost positions at the centres of Soviet power to rivals in the aircraft industry. The prestigious Tu-144 programme enjoyed top level support until 1973, as did the important Tu-154 airliner, but the favored position the Tupolev Design Bureau enjoyed through Tupolev&#x27;s personal political connections was largely eclipsed by the Ilyushin aircraft manufacturing and design company. To his contemporaries, Tupolev was known as a witty but crude master of obscene vocabulary who invariably and energetically insisted on fast and adequate technical fixes at the expense of scholastic ideal solutions. A hallmark of Tupolev was to get an aeroplane into service very rapidly, then began an often interminable process of improving the shortcomings of the &quot;quick and dirty&quot; initial design. To his competitors among the Soviet aircraft design community, he was known above all as politically astute; a shrewd and unforgiving rival.

Tupolev died on 23 December 1972 and was buried in Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.

===Memorials===
Various streets in cities across the Eastern Bloc were named in honour of Tupolev, as well as one in Western Europe, the &quot;Tupolevlaan&quot; near Amsterdam Airport Schiphol.

In 1973, the Kazan Aviation Institute was named after Tupolev, and a monument of him was erected in Kazan in a public square at the intersection of Dekabristov, Gagarin and Korolev Streets. In 1979, a bust of Tupolev was erected at a public square in Kimry, near his birthplace Pustomazovo which no longer exists. Another memorial to Tupolev was erected in the estimated location of Pustomazovo in the present-day Ustinovo, north of Kimry in Kimrsky District, Tver Oblast. The local high school in Ustinovo was renamed after Tupolev and a memorial plaque was installed. In 1988, the Soviet Union issued a postage stamp dedicated to Tupolev. The 1979 biographical film &quot;Poema o kryl&#x27;yakh&quot; (Поэма о крыльях) directed by Daniil Khrabrovitsky is about the life and works of Tupolev and Igor Sikorsky, the Russian-American aviation pioneer. Prospekt Tupoleva, the main avenue in the Aviatsionny microdistrict of Domodedovo located next to Domodedovo Airport, was named after Tupolev. A memorial mural of Tupolev was painted on the side of the 20 Prospekt Tupoleva apartment building. In 2018, Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow was formally renamed to Vnukovo Andrei Tupolev International Airport.

On December 1, 2022, in honor of the 100th anniversary of aircraft designer Andrei Tupolev, his first monument was opened in Moscow. He appeared next to the building of the design bureau on the embankment of Academician Tupolev in the square of the same name. The sculpture is made of bronze and represents the figure of an aircraft designer and the outline of a Tu-144 taking off.

==Personal life==
Tupolev was married to Yuliya Nikolaevna Tupoleva (née Zheltyakova) until her death in 1962. Tupolev&#x27;s daughter Yuliya (1920–2011) was a doctor who was awarded the title of Honored Doctor of the Russian Federation. Tupolev&#x27;s son Alexei (1925-2001) was a successful pioneering aircraft designer who designed the Tupolev Tu-144 supersonic passenger jet, and helped design the Buran space shuttle and the Tu-2000 long-range heavy bomber.

Tupolev was never a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union despite his status and being elected to several deputy positions.

<text>Walla Walla University is a private Adventist university in College Place, Washington. The university has five campuses throughout the Pacific Northwest. It was founded in 1892 and is affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

The university has an annual enrollment of around 1,700 students. It is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities and is also denominationally accredited. Walla Walla University offers more than 100 areas of study including preprofessional degrees and four graduate programs.

== History ==
In 1887, W.W. Prescott became the first education secretary of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. He noticed that Seventh-day Adventist schools were opening all over the place without a plan for long-term success, and decided to encourage these new Adventist schools to consolidate into larger, regional institutions that would stand a better chance of survival. In 1890, Prescott visited the Pacific Northwest and asked the three Adventist schools there to merge; and after overcoming local opposition, the Adventist schools in Coquille, Portland, and Milton, all in Oregon, agreed to merge. A committee chose to place the new school on forty acres of land located just west of Walla Walla, Washington that were donated for the school. The new school opened on December 7, 1892, named Walla Walla College, and Prescott was named the first president. However, Prescott was also president of two other institutions at the time, so Edward A. Sutherland, the principal, took over running the school&#x27;s day-to-day activities and eventually became the second president of the college.

On the first day, Walla Walla College offered all education from elementary up to the first two years of college; total enrollment was 101, with six teachers. All classes were run out of the four-storey tall administration building, deliberately built tall so that it could be seen from the city of Walla Walla. Sutherland focused on following the counsels of Adventist prophetess Ellen G. White as closely as possible, and under his direction the school became the first to offer an exclusively vegetarian diet. Likewise, he emphasized manual labour for the students. Initially school finances were shaky, but the manual labour of the students eventually provided sufficient income to stabilize the school&#x27;s finances. The school&#x27;s first graduation was held in 1896; three students graduated.

The school quickly celebrated a number of important milestones. In 1895, the school became the first Adventist institution to allow a brass ensemble to play during church services. In 1899, the first college bakery opened. In 1901, Walla Walla College was incorporated. In 1905, Marion E. Cady became the school&#x27;s eighth president, and under his leadership the school expanded its college course offerings to a full four-year college program; by 1909, the college celebrated its first baccalaureate graduate. Cady also stabilized the school&#x27;s finances, which resulted in the college paying off its debt in 1909. However, in 1910 the school suffered the first of many fires, when the power plant burned down. In 1911, Ernest Kellogg took over as president, and under his leadership the academic program of the college was further strengthened; elementary and high school classes were moved to separate buildings, and the school received accreditation from the University of Washington in 1913 for its high school; in that same year, enrollment reached 400 students. Kellogg designed the school&#x27;s seal, and under Kellogg, the first yearbook was published, the first student newspaper was published, the student association was founded, and the alumni association was created. The first school gym opened when Kellogg retired in 1917; the current cafeteria building is named after him.

In 1919, a fire destroyed the top floor of the school&#x27;s administration building. In the 1920s, Walla Walla College pursued accreditation for its college program, receiving accreditation for the first two years of its college program and also winning accreditation for its teacher training program. However, the college met opposition from the church over its pursuit of accreditation, and suspended its application. During this time period, OPS and AGA (dorm clubs) were founded, the Johnson Music Conservatory was built, and a fire burned down the women&#x27;s dorm. In the 1930s, Walla Walla College again pursued accreditation, and by 1935 it received accreditation for its full college program; in this same year, the high school separated from the college and became Walla Walla Valley Academy, leaving the school strictly a college. By this time, Walla Walla College was the largest Seventh-day Adventist college in the world. Walla Walla went through further conflicts with Adventist authorities, which reached an apex in 1938, when several theology professors were fired because they were considered heterodox. President William Martin Landeen resigned.

In 1939, the Columbia Auditorium opened, a popular performing arts venue. In the 1940s, a number of important developments helped found some of Walla Walla&#x27;s most popular programs. An airfield was built in 1942 which led to the start of Walla Walla&#x27;s aviation program. In 1944, the present library building was completed, and in 1947 the present boys dorm was built. In 1945, the village that had grown up to support the college was incorporated as the city of College Place, Washington. In 1947, the university opened up the first school of engineering in the Seventh-day Adventist church, and the first physical education program started around the same time. Also in 1947, the school opened its first satellite campus, when it began its school of nursing at the Portland Sanitarium, today Adventist Health Portland. In 1948, the college&#x27;s first master&#x27;s program was offered in Biology, and a master&#x27;s degree in Education began two years later. A second satellite campus was opened in 1954 at Rosario Beach in Anacortes, Washington, for the marine biology program. Enrollment more than doubled in the post-war years, reaching 1,300 by 1950.

Growth slowed in the 1960s. A church was built in 1962, the present-day University Church. The college radio station, KGTS, began broadcasting in 1963, as the first FM-radio station in the Walla Walla Valley. Several buildings were built towards the end of the decade. The college also began to liberalize its rules, allowing its female students more freedom in how they dressed, and also hired its first full-time black professor. In 1971, the university&#x27;s engineering school was granted accreditation.

In the 1970s, the college ran into financial difficulties; a number of college industries were closed, sold, or privatized. A fire damaged the women&#x27;s dorm, and in 1978 a fire destroyed the Columbia Auditorium. Enrollment reached 2,000 by the middle of the decade. In the 1980s, WWC established an endowment fund in 1987. Also in 1987, a graduate program in social work began.

In 2007, the school was renamed Walla Walla University. Today enrollment fluctuates just under 2,000 students who are served by over 200 faculty and staff, across the university&#x27;s five campuses.

== Academics ==
Walla Walla University is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities, and also by the Adventist Accrediting Association. Some of WWU&#x27;s schools and departments are also accredited by agencies specific to their field. WWU has authorization from both the state of Washington and the state of Oregon.

WWU offers pre-professional programs, Associate degrees, Bachelor&#x27;s degrees, and Master&#x27;s degrees. The largest undergraduate programs are the nursing, engineering, business, biology, and education schools.

Walla Walla University is administratively divided into six schools and several departments: Business, Education and Psychology, Engineering, Nursing, Social Work, and Theology.

=== Other programs ===
Walla Walla University&#x27;s Department of Biological Sciences is one of its most popular programs. It operates the Rosario Beach Marine Campus. It is the university&#x27;s oldest master&#x27;s degree program.

== Campuses ==
Walla Walla University has five campuses. They are located in Washington, Oregon, and Montana.

===College Place Main Campus===
The first campus of Walla Walla University remains its central campus. Located outside of Walla Walla, Washington, the campus was initially 40 acres before being expanded to the present-day 83 acres, in addition to 592 total acres in the local area. The city of College Place, Washington sprung up shortly after the founding of the campus in 1892 to support the students and workers of the university. Nearly the entire undergraduate program of Walla Walla University is located on this campus, and the graduate program in education is also located on this campus. The oldest building on campus is Village Hall, built in 1920 as the university church. The campus includes Martin Airfield, opened in 1942 for the aviation department.

===Portland nursing campus===
The School of Nursing operates a campus in Portland, Oregon adjacent to Adventist Health Portland, where third and fourth-year nursing students complete their practicum. Opened in 1947, the campus includes a small dormitory for nursing students, named Hansen Hall.

===Rosario Beach Marine Laboratory===
The department of Biology operates a 40-acre campus on Rosario Beach, next to Anacortes, Washington. The campus operates during the summer, offering courses in biology and marine biology. The campus also supports courses in scuba diving. The campus was purchased in 1954.

===Montana campuses===
The school of social work and sociology operates two campuses in Montana, at Missoula and Billings, in support of its graduate program in social work. The Missoula campus opened in 1997, and the Billings campus opened in 2001.

== Student government ==
The &quot;Associated Students of Walla Walla University&quot; (ASWWU) was founded in 1914 as the Collegiate Association. They have published the school yearbook, &quot;Mountain Ash&quot;, beginning in 1915 as the Western Collegian, and since 1917 under its current title. They have published the school newspaper, &quot;The Collegian&quot;, published under that title since 1916. ASWWU has also published the school directory, &quot;The Mask&quot;, since 1954.

== Athletics ==
The Walla Walla athletic teams are called the Wolves. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Cascade Collegiate Conference (CCC) since the 2015–16 academic year. The Wolves previously competed as an NAIA Independent within the Association of Independent Institutions (AII) from 2008–09 to 2014–15, and in the Pacific Northwest College Conference (PNCC) from 1994–95 to 1999–2000. They also were a member in the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA) from 2004–05 to 2012–13; and in the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA) from 1997–98 to 2007–08.

Walla Walla competes in eight intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf and soccer; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf and volleyball.

===Club sports===
Unofficially, Walla Walla was affiliated with a men&#x27;s ice hockey team, called the Wolfpack.

== Campus Ministries ==

The Chaplain&#x27;s Office of the university includes departments of Campus Ministries and Student Missions.

===Student Missions===
The modern Walla Walla University Student Missions program began in 1960 when they sent out their first student missionaries overseas. Today, Walla Walla University sends out between 50 and 90 student missionaries (SMs) each year, to locations around the world. Some Seventh-day Adventist schools in Micronesia are staffed by Walla Walla University student missionaries.

<text>Mary Aline Siepmann CBE (24 June 191230 December 2002), known by the pen name Mary Wesley, was an English novelist. During her career, she was one of Britain&#x27;s most successful novelists, selling three million copies of her books, including ten bestsellers in the last twenty years of her life.

==Biography==
===Birth and family===
Mary Aline Mynors Farmar was born in Englefield Green, Surrey, the third child of Colonel Harold Mynors Farmar, CMG, DSO, of Orchards, Bicknoller, Somerset, and his wife Violet Hyacinth, née Dalby, granddaughter of Sir William Bartlett Dalby. As a child, she had a succession of 16 foreign governesses. When she asked her mother why they kept on leaving, her mother reportedly told her: &quot;Because none of them like you, darling.&quot;

Wesley had a lifelong complicated relationship with her family and especially with her mother, who had a sharp tongue. Following the death of her father in 1961, her mother said: &quot;I&#x27;m not going to let that lingering death happen to me. When the time comes I&#x27;m going to crawl to the Solent and swim out.&quot; Wesley replied with feeling: &quot;I&#x27;ll help you&quot;.

Her family did not approve of her books. Her brother called what she wrote &quot;filth&quot; and her sister, with whom she was no longer on speaking terms, strongly objected to &quot;The Camomile Lawn&quot;, claiming that some of the characters were based on their parents. Wesley identified the appalling grandparents in &quot;Harnessing Peacocks&quot;, who bully the pregnant Hebe, as the nearest she came to a portrait of her own parents in old age.

===Adult life===
Lewis Clive fell in love with Wesley and asked her to marry him. In &quot;The Camomile Lawn&quot;, the character Oliver Ansty is a fictionalised version of Clive.

Wesley&#x27;s first husband was Charles Swinfen Eady, 2nd Baron Swinfen, with whom she had a son, Roger Swinfen Eady, 3rd Baron Swinfen; although her son Toby Eady, born in 1941, was initially known as the son of Lord Swinfen, Wesley subsequently admitted his father to be the Czech political scientist Heinz Otto Ziegler. Toby Eady was eventually the literary agent of her biographer Patrick Marnham. She next married Eric Siepmann and with him had a third son, William Siepmann.

In 1970 Wesley was left impoverished by the death of Siepmann, and it was only then that she became an author, turning to writing as a way to restore her finances.

===Final years===
Only in the last year of her life did she agree to have her biography written. She cooperated fully with Patrick Marnham, on the condition that nothing would be published before her death. She provided her reminiscences from her sick bed, and commented: &quot;Have you any idea of the pleasure of lying in bed for six months, talking about yourself to a very intelligent man? My deepest regret was that I was too old and ill to take him into bed with me.&quot; The authorised biography (published in 2006) is entitled &quot;Wild Mary&quot;, a reference both to her childhood nickname and to her sex life as a young woman, when she had many lovers. The biography holds nothing back. As Wesley stated: &quot;It was a flighty generation... [W]e had been brought up so repressed. War freed us. We felt if we didn&#x27;t do it now, we might never get another chance.&quot; &quot;It got to the state where one woke up in the morning, reached across the pillow and thought, &#x27;Let&#x27;s see. Who is it this time?&#x27;&quot;

But Wesley finally did get tired of her wartime lifestyle, realizing that her way of life had become too excessive: &quot;too many lovers, too much to drink...I was on my way to become a very nasty person&quot;. When her son Toby Eady read the book, he was so amazed at how much he did not know about his mother that he did not speak to anyone for a week.

Late in life Wesley ordered her own coffin from a local craftswoman and asked it be finished in red Chinese lacquer. She kept it as a coffee table for some time in her sitting room. She suggested that she be photographed sitting up in it for a feature in the magazine &quot;Country Living,&quot; but the idea was politely declined.

She was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1995 New Year Honours, for services to literature. Due to her association with the town Wesley was chosen in 2007 to appear on the 1 Totnes pound note.

===Death===
Wesley died from cancer on 30 December 2002, aged 90, at her home in Totnes, Devon and was buried beside her second husband in the graveyard of Buckfast Abbey.

==Writing style and themes==
Her take on life reveals a sharp and critical eye which neatly dissects the idiosyncrasies of genteel England with humour, compassion and irony, detailing in particular sexual and emotional values. Her style has been described as &quot;arsenic without the old lace&quot;. Others have described it as &quot;Jane Austen plus sex&quot;, a description Wesley herself thought ridiculous. As a woman who was liberated before her time Mary Wesley challenged social assumptions about the old, confessed to bad behaviour and recommended sex. In doing so she smashed the stereotype of the disapproving, judgmental, past-it, old person. This delighted the old and intrigued the young.

In Wesley&#x27;s books there are some references to her own life, although she denied that her novels were autobiographical. Her books usually take place in or around the everlasting house, the idyllic refuge, recalling her time with Siepmann, living in a remote cottage in the West Country. Other recurring themes such as the dysfunctional family, the uncertain paternity, the affirmation of illegitimacy, can also be linked to her own life. In addition, thanks to her flighty youth, sex would become her trademark in her books though she wrote about what went on in the head rather than a user&#x27;s manual. Incest also plays a part in several of her novels, but Wesley never mentioned this as a feature of her own life. She may however have gained her insight from her years working as a Samaritan.

==Career and bibliography==

===Novels===
She wrote three children&#x27;s books, &quot;Speaking Terms&quot; and &quot;The Sixth Seal&quot; (both 1969) and &quot;Haphazard House&quot; (1983), before publishing adult fiction. Since her first adult novel was published only in 1983, when she was 71, she may be regarded as a late bloomer. The publication of &quot;Jumping the Queue&quot; in 1983 was the beginning of an intensely creative period of Wesley&#x27;s life. From 1982 to 1991, she wrote and delivered seven novels. While she aged from 70 to 79 she still showed the focus and drive of a young person.

Her best-known book, &quot;The Camomile Lawn&quot;, set in the West Penwith area near St Buryan, although filmed on the Roseland Peninsula in Cornwall, was turned into a television series, and is an account of the intertwining lives of three families in rural England during World War II. After &quot;The Camomile Lawn&quot; (1984) came &quot;Harnessing Peacocks&quot; (1985 and as a TV film in 1992), &quot;The Vacillations of Poppy Carew&quot; (1986 and filmed in 1995), &quot;Not That Sort of Girl&quot; (1987), &quot;Second Fiddle&quot; (1988), &quot;A Sensible Life&quot; (1990), &quot;A Dubious Legacy&quot; (1992), &quot;An Imaginative Experience&quot; (1994) and &quot;Part of the Furniture&quot; (1997). A book about the West Country with photographer Kim Sayer, &quot;Part of the Scenery&quot;, was published in 2001. Asked why she had stopped writing fiction at the age of 84, she replied: &quot;If you haven&#x27;t got anything to say, don&#x27;t say it.&quot;

In March 2024, it was announced Wesley&#x27;s literary estate had been acquired by the London-headquartered company, International Literary Properties (ILP), for an undisclosed sum.

<doc id="163519" wikidata="Q935427" url="?curid=163519" title="John T. Scopes">
<text>John Thomas Scopes (August 3, 1900 – October 21, 1970) was a teacher in Dayton, Tennessee, who was charged on May 5, 1925, with violating Tennessee&#x27;s Butler Act, which prohibited the teaching of human evolution in Tennessee schools. He was tried in a case known as the Scopes Trial, and was found guilty and fined $100 ().

==Early life==
Scopes was born in 1900 to Thomas Scopes and Mary Alva Brown, who lived on a farm in Paducah, Kentucky. John was their fifth child and only son. The family relocated to Danville, Illinois when he was a teenager. In 1917, he relocated to Salem, Illinois, where he was a member of the class of 1919 at Salem Community High School.

He attended the University of Illinois briefly, then quit for health reasons. He earned a degree at the University of Kentucky in 1924, with a major in law and a minor in geology.

Scopes relocated to Dayton, Tennessee where he became the Rhea County High School football coach, and occasionally served as a substitute teacher.

==Trial==
Scopes&#x27; involvement with the Scopes Trial occurred after the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) announced that it would finance a test case challenging the constitutionality of the Butler Act if it could find a Tennessee teacher who was willing to act as a defendant.

A group of businessmen in Dayton, Tennessee, especially engineer and geologist George Rappleyea, considered this an opportunity to get publicity for their town, and Rappleyea spoke with Scopes, stating that while the Butler Act prohibited the teaching of human evolution, the state required teachers to use the assigned textbook, George William Hunter&#x27;s &quot;Civic Biology&quot; (1914), which included a chapter concerning evolution. Rappleyea argued that teachers were thus essentially required to violate the law. When asked about a test case, Scopes was initially reluctant to get involved. After some discussion he told the group gathered in Robinson&#x27;s Drugstore, &quot;If you can prove that I&#x27;ve taught evolution and that I can qualify as a defendant, then I&#x27;ll be willing to stand trial&quot;.

By the time the trial had begun, the defense team included Clarence Darrow, Dudley Field Malone, John Neal, Arthur Garfield Hays and Frank McElwee. The prosecution team, directed by politician Tom Stewart, included brothers Herbert Hicks and Sue K. Hicks, Wallace Haggard, father and son pairings Ben and J. Gordon McKenzie, and William Jennings Bryan and William Jennings Bryan Jr. The elder Bryan had spoken at Scopes&#x27; high school commencement, and remembered the defendant was laughing while he was giving the address to the graduating class six years earlier.

The case ended on July 21, 1925, with a verdict of guilty, and Scopes was fined $100 (). The case was appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court. In a 3–1 decision written by Chief Justice Grafton Green, the Butler Act was held to be constitutional, but the court overturned Scopes&#x27;s conviction because the judge had set the fine instead of the jury. The Butler Act remained in effect until May 18, 1967, when it was repealed by the Tennessee legislature.

Scopes may have been innocent of the crime with which his name is associated. After the trial, he admitted to reporter William Kinsey Hutchinson &quot;I didn&#x27;t violate the law,&quot; explaining that he had skipped the evolution lesson and that his lawyers had coached his students to testify; the Dayton businessmen had assumed that he had violated the law. Hutchinson did not file his story until after the Scopes appeal was decided in 1927.

In 1955, the trial was fictionalized as a play titled &quot;Inherit The Wind&quot; featuring Paul Muni as a character based on Clarence Darrow and Ed Begley as a character based on William Jennings Bryan. In 1960, a movie version of the play featured Spencer Tracy as the Darrow character and Fredric March as the Bryan character.

Both the play and the movie change the facts substantially. For example, the character of Bertram Cates is shown being arrested in class, put in jail, burned in effigy by frenzied, mean-spirited, and ignorant townspeople, and taunted by a preacher. The character of Matthew Harrison Brady, an almost comical fanatic, dramatically dies of a &quot;busted belly&quot; while attempting to deliver his summation in a chaotic courtroom. None of these incidents happened in Dayton, Tennessee during the trial.

==Life after the trial==

The results of the Scopes Trial affected Scopes professionally and personally. His public image was mocked by animation, cartoons and other media during the succeeding years. Scopes himself largely shunned publicity.

During September 1925, he enrolled in the graduate school of the University of Chicago to finish his studies of geology. Evidence of harassment by the press was mentioned by Frank Thorne: &quot;You may be interested to know that Mr. John T. Scopes of anti-evolution trial fame expects to take up the study of geology as a graduate student of Chicago this fall…Please do what you can to protect him from the importunities of Chicago reporters….He is a modest and unassuming young chap, and has been subjected to a great deal more limelight than he likes.&quot; A year later, the Tennessee Supreme Court decision of 1926 prompted the press to pursue Scopes again. During this time, he wrote to Thorne, &quot;I am tired of fooling with them&quot;.  It is evident that the media&#x27;s attention was affecting Scopes emotionally.

Even worse, the Great Depression affected his career.  After his graduation, he was &quot;barred&quot; from career opportunities in Tennessee, forcing him and his wife to relocate to his childhood home in Kentucky in about 1930.

Having failed in education, Scopes attempted to build a political career and he began an unsuccessful bid as a candidate of the Socialist Party for the U.S. House of Representatives for Kentucky&#x27;s only at-large congressional campaign, during 1932. Eventually Scopes worked as an oil expert for the United Production Corporation, later known as the United Gas Corporation. There, he first worked in Beeville, Texas, then, he worked in the company&#x27;s Houston office until 1940, and later, he worked in Shreveport, Louisiana, where he stayed until his death. United Gas merged into what was Pennzoil during 1968.

Scopes attended the 1960 premiere of &quot;Inherit The Wind&quot; and he also participated in the celebration of John T. Scopes Day.

Scopes and the story of his trial were featured in an episode of the television game show &quot;To Tell The Truth&quot; on October 10, 1960.

In June 1967, Scopes wrote &quot;Center of the Storm: Memoirs of John T. Scopes&quot;. The Butler Act was repealed that same year.

==Personal life and death==
Scopes married Mildred Elizabeth Scopes (née Walker) (1905–1990). Together they had two sons: John Thomas Jr. and William Clement &quot;Bill&quot;.

He died of cancer on October 21, 1970, in Shreveport, Louisiana at the age of 70.

<text>Cecil Adams, affectionately known to readers and fans and sometimes refers to himself as Uncle Cecil or Uncle Cece, is the pseudonymous author of &quot;The Straight Dope&quot;, a popular question and answer column published in the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; from 2 February 1973 to 2018. The true identity of Adams, whether a single individual or a group of authors, has remained secret. &quot;The Chicago Reader&quot;″s 1986 trademark filing for the name &quot;Cecil Adams&quot; states that &quot;Cecil Adams does not identify any particular individual but was devised as a fanciful name.&quot; As of 2008, Ed Zotti was the editor of the column. The column was syndicated in 31 newspapers in the United States and Canada and has been continued as a website. The aim of the column, and now the website, is to spread general knowledge and everyday rational thinking, using a very strong and characteristically quirky sense of humor - some of it self-deprecating.

Billed as the &quot;World&#x27;s Smartest Human&quot;, Adams responded to often unusual inquiries with a high degree of humor (often directed against the questioner, sometimes sardonically), and at times carried out exhaustive research into obscure and arcane issues, urban legends, and the like. On more than one occasion, Adams was forced to retract or modify an answer when confronted by &quot;the Teeming Millions&quot; (Adams&#x27; term for his readers), often claiming overwork and staff shortages. On rare occasions, Adams made appearances on the Straight Dope&#x27;s Message Board.

On June 27, 2018, Adams announced that the &quot;Straight Dope&quot; column would be ending after 45 years and over 3,400 columns. On January 13, 2023, it was announced that Cecil Adams would again be writing a column on The Straight Dope Message Board. The first column, which appeared on the same day, was titled, &quot;Is longtermism the world’s most dangerous belief system?&quot;

== Personal details ==
Adams states that he has &quot;never been photographed&quot;, and while there is at least one photo captioned with his name, the image is of Ed Zotti, who fulfilled Adams&#x27;s publicity engagements. Previous editors include Mike Lenehan and Dave Kehr. In his columns, Adams has revealed a few details of his purported personal life, including the existence of a Mrs. Adams (the FAQ section on his website states that chance references to &quot;Mrs. Adams&quot; may refer to his mother), that he has a brother-in-law, and that he has either children or dwarves as helpers. He has a brother. He is an accomplished traveler, and currently resides in Chicago&#x27;s 47th Ward. He is also left-handed and may be balding and colorblind. He mentions having taken a class with Northwestern University English professor Bergen Evans, mentions once working as an electrician&#x27;s apprentice, and a railroad machinist&#x27;s helper. He also mentions attending a Catholic school. He is of Irish descent, and relaxes with Pink Floyd and Baileys.

==Published works==
Adams has published five collections of his &quot;The Straight Dope&quot; columns:

* &quot;The Straight Dope&quot; (1984)
* &quot;More of the Straight Dope&quot; (1988)
* &quot;Return of the Straight Dope &quot;(1994)
* &quot;Triumph of the Straight Dope&quot; (1994)
* &quot;The Straight Dope Tells All&quot; (1998)

Zotti has also published a children&#x27;s collection in &quot;The Straight Dope&quot; style entitled &quot;Know It All&quot;. Adams&#x27; columns are archived at the Straight Dope website. In 1996, the A&amp;E Network briefly aired a show hosted by comedian Mike Lukas based on the column, also called &quot;The Straight Dope&quot;. Over 600 articles have been posted to the site&#x27;s online archive; some of these contain multiple questions and answers. Also included with the columns are quirky illustrations. Slug Signorino was the regular illustrator for &quot;The Straight Dope&quot; for forty-two years. In his illustrations, Cecil Adams is often depicted as a large turkey wearing a mortar board or, occasionally, as a man in underwear with a paper bag over his head.
