<text>The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNS), often called the Portsmouth Navy Yard, is a United States Navy shipyard on Seavey&#x27;s Island in Kittery, Maine, bordering Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The naval yard lies along the southern boundary of Maine on the Piscataqua River.

Founded on June 12, 1800, PNS is the U.S. Navy&#x27;s oldest continuously operating shipyard. Today, most of its work concerns the overhaul, repair, and modernization of submarines.

As of November 2021, the shipyard employed more than 6,500 federal employees. As well, some of the work is performed by private corporations (e.g., Delphinius Engineering of Eddystone, Pennsylvania; Oceaneering International of Chesapeake, Virginia; Orbis Sibro of Mount Pleasant, South Carolina; and Q.E.D. Systems Inc. of Virginia Beach, Virginia).

==History==

The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard was established on June 12, 1800, during the administration of President John Adams. It sits on a cluster of conjoined islands called Seavey&#x27;s Island in the Piscataqua River, whose swift tidal current prevents ice from blocking navigation to the Atlantic Ocean.

The area has a long tradition of shipbuilding. Since colonial settlement, New Hampshire and Maine forests provided lumber for wooden boat construction. , considered the first British warship built in the Thirteen Colonies, was commissioned here in 1696. During the Revolution, the was built in 1776 on Badger&#x27;s Island in Kittery, and became the first vessel to fly an American flag into battle. &quot;Raleigh&quot; has been depicted on the Seal of New Hampshire since 1784, even though she was captured and served in the British Navy. Other warships followed, including launched in 1777; Commanded by Captain John Paul Jones, it became the first U. S. Navy vessel to receive an official salute at sea from a foreign power. The 36-gun frigate , one of the first six frigates of the United States Navy, was built at the shipyard from 1795 to 1799.

In the 1790s, Navy Secretary Benjamin Stoddert decided to build the first federal shipyard. He put it where a proven workforce had access to abundant raw materials: Fernald&#x27;s Island, for which the government paid $5,500. To protect the new installation, old Fort William and Mary at the mouth of Portsmouth Harbor was rebuilt and renamed Fort Constitution.

Commodore Isaac Hull was the first naval officer to command the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard; he led it from 1800 until 1802, and again in 1812 during the War of 1812. The yard&#x27;s first product was the 74-gun ship of the line , supervised by local master shipbuilder William Badger and launched in 1814. Barracks were built in 1820, with Marine barracks added in 1827. A hospital was established in 1834. Architect Alexander Parris was appointed chief engineer for the base. In 1838, the Franklin Shiphouse was completed: long, wide, and measuring from floor to center of its ridgepole. It carried 130 tons of slate on a gambrel roof. It was lengthened in 1854 to accommodate (from which it took its name); the largest wooden warship built at the yard, it required a decade to finish. The structure was considered one of the largest shiphouses in the country until it burned at 5 a.m. on March 10, 1936. Perhaps the most famous vessel ever overhauled at the yard was , also called &quot;Old Ironsides,&quot; in 1855. On November 2, 1842, Commodore John Drake Sloat responded to a request by Navy Secretary Abel P. Upshur for information about wages and working hours at the shipyard. Sloat said the &quot;time of work is from sunrise until sunset, except when the sun rises before 7 o&#x27;clock or sets after 6 when they commence work at 7 and quit at 6 o clock, not exceeding 10 hours labor at any season of the year.&quot; He added that wages &quot;are always fluctuating according to the demand for mechanics&quot;.
Prisoners of war from the Spanish–American War were encamped in 1898 on the grounds of the base. In 1905, construction began on the Portsmouth Naval Prison, a military prison dubbed &quot;The Castle&quot; because of its resemblance to a crenellated castle. It was the principal prison for the Navy and Marine Corps, as well as housing for many German U-boat crews after capture, until it closed in 1974. Also in 1905, the Portsmouth Navy Yard hosted the Treaty of Portsmouth which ended the Russo-Japanese War. For arranging the peace conference, President Theodore Roosevelt won the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize. Delegates met in the General Stores Building, now the Administration Building (called Building 86). In 2005, a summer-long series of events marked the 100th anniversary of the signing of the treaty, including a visit by a Navy destroyer, a parade, and a re-enactment of the arrival of diplomats from the two nations.
During World War I, the shipyard began constructing submarines, with being the first ever built by a U. S. navy yard. Meanwhile, the base continued to overhaul and repair surface vessels. Consequently, the workforce grew to nearly 5,000 civilians. It grew to almost 25,000 civilians in World War II when over 70 submarines were constructed at the yard, with a record of 4 launched in a single day. When the war ended, the shipyard became the Navy&#x27;s center for submarine design and development. In 1953, revolutionized submarine design around the world with its teardrop hull and round cross-section. It is now a museum and tourist attraction in Portsmouth. , the first nuclear-powered submarine built at the base, was launched in 1957. The last submarine built here was , launched in 1969. Today the shipyard provides overhaul, refueling, and modernization work.

In 1965, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara ordered the closure of 95 military bases which included the Portsmouth Naval Yard, but Portsmouth received a ten-year extension before the order to close was ultimately rescinded by President Richard Nixon in 1971.

In the early years of submarine construction, the wood from lignum vitae tree logs was used for propeller shaft bearings. A small pond at Portsmouth, near the Naval Prison, was used to keep the lignum vitae logs submerged in water in order to prevent the wood from cracking. Although the use of wood was discontinued as construction techniques improved, many of the logs were still present during the construction of between 1963 and 1967.

The 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission placed the yard on a list for base closures, effective by 2008. Employees organized the Save Our Shipyard campaign to influence the committee to reverse its decision. On 24 August 2005, the base was taken off the list and continues operating under its motto, &quot;From Sails to Atoms.&quot;

The shipyard earned the Meritorious Unit Commendation in 2005. The MUC recognized the shipyard for meritorious service from September 11, 2001, to August 30, 2004. Portsmouth Naval Shipyard accomplishments achieved during that period included completion of six major submarine availabilities early, exceeding Net Operation Results financial goals, reducing injuries by more than 50 percent, and exceeding the Secretary of Defense&#x27;s Fiscal Year 2006 Stretch Goal for lost workday compensation rates two years early.

In addition to the Navy presence, the United States Army New England Recruiting Battalion moved to PNSY in June 2010 from the closed Naval Air Station Brunswick. The United States Coast Guard uses the Portsmouth Navy Yard as the home port for the medium-endurance cutters , , and .

PNS is undergoing substantial construction and infrastructure upgrades. In fiscal 2020, Navy contracts were issued to renovate the communications building, build a super flood basin and extend crane rails in Dry Dock 1, upgrade crane rails in Dry Dock 2, renovate Building 2, and implement sundry waterfront projects.

The summer of 2021 saw an uptick in construction contracts issued for Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, including purchase and installation of three 12,000-gallon-per-minute dewatering pumps for the Dry Dock 1 extension, ongoing construction of the Dry Dock 2 complex, commencement of construction on the Virginia-class submarine waterfront support facility (Building 178), and a $1.73 billion contract for building a dry dock for maintenance and upgrade of Virginia-class submarines.

== Superfund site ==
In 1994, the shipyard was placed on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency National Priorities List (NPL) for environmental investigations/restorations under CERCLA (Superfund) after an investigation found groundwater, soil and sediment contamination with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs), metals and benzene. In 2024, the EPA removed the shipyard from the National Priorities List of contaminated Superfund. The removal followed 30 years of extensive remediation at the 278-acre shipyard, including the removal of contaminated soil, sediment and other hazardous materials.

==Boundary dispute==

New Hampshire laid claim to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard until the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the case in 2001, asserting judicial estoppel. Had it been found to belong to New Hampshire, base employees (and their spouses regardless of whether they themselves worked in Maine) from that state would no longer be required to pay Maine income tax. Despite the court&#x27;s ruling, New Hampshire&#x27;s 2006 Session House Joint Resolution 1 reaffirmed its sovereignty assertion over Seavey&#x27;s Island and the base.

== Safety concerns ==
A CDC / NIOSH study released in 2005 examined the cases of 115 employees at the shipyard who had died of leukemia between 1952 and 1992. The results suggested that leukemia mortality risk increased with increasing cumulative occupational ionizing radiation dose among PNS workers.

<text>The Norfolk Naval Shipyard, often called the Norfolk Navy Yard and abbreviated as NNSY, is a U.S. Navy facility in Portsmouth, Virginia, for building, remodeling and repairing the Navy&#x27;s ships. It is the oldest and largest industrial facility that belongs to the U.S. Navy as well as the most comprehensive. Located on the Elizabeth River, the yard is just a short distance upriver from its mouth at Hampton Roads.

It was established as Gosport Shipyard in 1767. Destroyed during the American Revolutionary War, it was rebuilt and became home to the first operational drydock in the United States in the 1830s. Changing hands during the American Civil War, it served the Confederate States Navy until it was again destroyed in 1862, when it was given its current name. The shipyard was again rebuilt, and has continued operation through the present day.

==History==

===British control===
The Gosport Shipyard was founded on November 1, 1767, by Andrew Sprowle on the western shore of the Elizabeth River in Norfolk County in the Virginia colony. This shipyard became a prosperous naval and merchant facility for the British Crown. In 1775, at the beginning of the American Revolution, Sprowle stayed loyal to the Crown which confiscated all of his properties, including the shipyard. Following Governor Dunmore&#x27;s retreat from Portsmouth in May 1776, Sprowle was exiled along with other Royalists to Gwynn&#x27;s Island (now Mathews County, Virginia), where he died 29 May 1776 and was buried in an unmarked grave. In 1779, while the newly formed Commonwealth of Virginia was operating the shipyard, it was burned by British troops.

===American control===
In 1794, United States Congress passed &quot;An Act to Provide a Naval Armament,&quot; allowing the Federal Government to lease the Gosport Shipyard from Virginia. In 1799 the keel of , one of the first six frigates authorized by Congress, was laid, making her the first ship built in Gosport for the U.S. Navy.

The federal government purchased the shipyard from Virginia in 1801 for $12,000. This tract of land measured and now makes up the northeastern corner of the current shipyard. In 1827, construction began on the first of what would be the first two dry docks in the United States. The first one was completed three weeks ahead of similar projects in both Boston and South America, making it the first functional dry dock in the Americas. Dry Dock One, as it is referred to today, is still operational and is listed as historical landmark in Portsmouth, Virginia. Officer&#x27;s Quarters A, B, and C were built about 1837. Additional land on the eastern side of the Elizabeth River was purchased in 1845.

The shipyard and neighboring towns suffered from a severe yellow fever epidemic in 1855, which killed about a quarter of the population, including James Chisholm, whose account was published shortly after his death in the epidemic.

=== Enslaved labor===
Enslaved labor was extensively utilized in the Norfolk Navy Yard from its foundation until the Civil War. An example of such use is found in Norfolk Navy Yard Commandant, Commodore John Cassin&#x27;s John Cassin (naval officer) 29 April 1818 letter to the Secretary of the Navy, Benjamin W. Crowninshield. Cassin began his letter, by stating as justification &quot;Finding it absolutely impossible to do the labor required in this Yard, without taking in some black men in consequence of the white men sporting with their time in the manner they do, leaving the yard, since the month of April come in, there has Sixty four men, laborers left the yard, some gone to Old Point to work where greater wages is given and others gone to sea... I have therefore taken in twenty four blacks for the purpose of discharging &amp; loading such vessels as may be ordered and cleaning the frigate Constitution&#x27;s hold.&quot; Some idea of the human scale can be found in this excerpt from a letter of Commodore Lewis Warrington dated 12 October 1831 to the Board of Navy Commissioners (BNC). Warrington&#x27;s letter to the BNC was in response to various petitions by white workers to curtail or end enslaved labor on the Dry Dock. His letter attempts both to reassure the BNC in light of Nat Turner&#x27;s Rebellion which occurred on 22 August 1831 and to serve as a reply to the Dry Dock&#x27;s stonemasons who had quit their positions and accused the project chief engineer, Loammi Baldwin Jr., of the unfair hiring of enslaved labor in their stead.

There are about two hundred and forty six blacks employed in the Yard and Dock altogether; of whom one hundred and thirty six are in the former and one hundred ten in the latter – We shall in the Course of this day or tomorrow discharge twenty which will leave but one hundred and twenty six on our roll – The evil of employing blacks, if it be one, is in a fair and rapid course of diminution, as our whole number, after the timber now in the water is stowed, will not exceed sixty; and those employed at the Dock will be discharged from time to time, as their services can be dispensed with – when it is finished, there will be no occasion for the employment of any.

 Despite such promises, enslaved labor continued, and, as of October 1832, Baldwin reported of the 261 men employed on the Dry Dock, 78 of whom, were enslaved black laborers or 30% of the Dry Dock workforce. Opposition to enslaved labor was never able to effectively challenge the status quo and suggestions or recommendations to end the practice met fierce resistance. One such effort in 1839, was countered by a petition signed by 34 shipyard slaveholders, pleading with the Secretary of the Navy to continue it less they suffer economic harm. Their successful petition was endorsed by Commodore Lewis Warrington. Warrington noted: &quot;I beg leave to state, that no slave employed in this yard, is owned by a commissioned officer, but that many are owned by the Master Mechanicks &amp; workmen of the yard&quot;. He added; “I beg leave to state, that no slave is allowed to perform any mechanical work in the yard, all such being necessarily reserved for the whites; this keeping up the proper distinction between the white men &amp; slave”. In 1846 Commodore Jesse Wilkerson felt the need to confirm the continuation of slave hiring to the Secretary of the Navy George Bancroft, “that a majority of them [blacks] are negro slaves, and that a large portion of those employed in the Ordinary for many years, have been of that description, but by what authority I am unable to say as nothing can be found in the records of my office on the subject – These men have been examined by the Surgeon of the Yard and regularly Shipped [enlisted] for twelve months&quot; 

 George Teamoh (1818–1883) as a young enslaved laborer and ship caulker worked at Norfolk Navy Yard in the 1830s and 1840s and later wrote of this unrequited toil: &quot;The government had patronized, and given encouragement to slavery to a greater extent than the great majority of the country has been aware. It had in its service hundreds if not thousands of slaves employed on government works.&quot; As late &quot;as 1848 almost one third of the 300 workers at the Gosport (Norfolk) Navy Yard were hired slaves.&quot;

===American Civil War===

In 1861, Virginia joined the Confederate States of America. Fearing that the Confederacy would take control of the facility, the shipyard commander Charles Stewart McCauley ordered the burning of the shipyard on 21 April 1861. The Confederate forces did, in fact, take over the shipyard, and did so without armed conflict through an elaborate ruse orchestrated by civilian railroad builder William Mahone (then President of the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad and soon to become a famous Confederate officer). He bluffed the Federal troops into abandoning the shipyard in Portsmouth by running a single passenger train into Norfolk with great noise and whistle-blowing, then much more quietly, sending it back west, and then returning the same train again, creating the illusion of large numbers of arriving troops to the Federals listening in Portsmouth across the Elizabeth River (and just barely out of sight). The capture of the shipyard allowed a tremendous amount of war material to fall into Confederate hands. 1,195 heavy guns were taken for the defense of the Confederacy, and employed in many areas from Hampton Roads all the way to Fort Donelson Tennessee, Port Hudson, and Fort DeRussy, Louisiana. The Union forces withdrew to Fort Monroe across Hampton Roads, which was the only land in the area which remained under Union control.

In early 1862, the Confederate ironclad warship was rebuilt using the burned-out hulk of . In the haste to abandon the shipyard, &quot;Merrimack&quot; had only been destroyed above the waterline, and an innovative armored superstructure was built upon the remaining portion. &quot;Virginia&quot;, which was still called &quot;Merrimack&quot; by Union forces and in many historical accounts, sank , , and engaged the Union ironclad in the famous Battle of Hampton Roads during the Union blockade of Hampton Roads. The Confederates burned the shipyard again when they left in May 1862.

Following its recapture of Norfolk and Portsmouth (and the shipyard) by the Union forces, the name of the shipyard was changed to Norfolk after the county in which it was located, outside the city limits of Portsmouth at the time. This choice of name was probably to minimize any confusion with the pre-existing Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, near Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

===Modern shipyard===
From the Reconstruction Era until 1917, the shipyard was used both for ship repair and construction and for ship stationing; the current major naval base for the region, Naval Station Norfolk, did not yet exist. As such, the then Norfolk Navy Yard served as the official Homeport for ships stationed in the Hampton Roads region.

No major expansion occurred at the facility until World War I when it was expanded to accommodate 11,000 employees and their families. The shipyard was again expanded in World War II, doubling its physical size, and greatly expanding its productive capacity. During its peak, from 1940 to 1945, 43,000 personnel were employed and 6,850 vessels were repaired.

After World War II, the shipyard shifted from being a ship construction facility to an overhaul and repair facility. Work on the , was suspended in 1950. Its last two ships, and her sister ship, , wooden minesweepers, were christened on March 28, 1953, during the Korean War.

Currently, the shipyard is composed of several noncontiguous areas totaling . Norfolk Naval Shipyard provides repair and modernization services for every type of ship that the U.S. Navy has in service, which includes amphibious vessels, submarines, guided-missile cruisers, and supercarriers, although in recent years the shipyard has primarily focused on nuclear ships and nuclear support ships. The Norfolk yard is one of the few facilities on the East Coast capable of dry docking nuclear aircraft carriers. Another facility capable of drydocking such carriers is Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII), located on the other side of Hampton Roads in Newport News, which is the only U.S. shipyard that currently builds and refuels nuclear aircraft carriers.

<text>Michael Arne (c. 174014 January 1786) was an English composer, harpsichordist, organist, singer, and actor. He was the son of the composer Thomas Arne and the soprano Cecilia Young, a member of the famous Young family of musicians of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Like his father, Arne worked primarily as a composer of stage music and vocal art song, contributing little to other genres of music. He wrote several songs for London&#x27;s pleasure gardens, the most famous of which is &quot;Lass with the Delicate Air&quot; (1762). A moderately prolific composer, Arne wrote nine operas and collaborated on at least 15 others. His most successful opera, &quot;Cymon&quot; (1767), enjoyed several revivals during his lifetime and into the early nineteenth century.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===

Michael Arne was born most likely in 1740 in the Covent Garden area of London. Music historian Charles Burney, a close friend of the Arne family, indicates that he was Thomas Arne&#x27;s natural son but there is some speculation among modern scholars that he may have been adopted. There is no record for Michael Arne at St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden, where most of the Arne family were christened. His father, Thomas Arne, was the most important English theatrical composer of the eighteenth century and is considered the catalyst for the revival of English opera in the early 1730s. His mother, Cecilia Young, was one of the greatest English sopranos of the century and part of the famous Young family of musicians. Both Michael&#x27;s grandfather, Charles Young, and his great-uncle, Anthony Young, were well known organists and minor composers. His Aunt Isabella was a successful soprano and the wife of composer John Frederick Lampe. His other aunt, Esther Young, was a contralto and the wife of music publisher Charles Jones. His cousins, Isabella, Elizabeth, and Polly, were all successful singers in their own right.

After 1745 Michael spent the majority of his childhood in the care of his aunt and celebrated actress Susannah Maria Cibber due to his mother&#x27;s frequent illnesses and his father&#x27;s busy career. It is likely that he received his earliest musical training from his aunt. It was also under her mentorship that he made his stage début as the Page in Thomas Otway’s tragedy &quot;The Orphan&quot; in the late 1740s. He began his musical career as a singer appearing in Francesco Onofrio Manfredini’s concert on 20 February 1750. This was followed by several singing appearances at the Vauxhall Gardens in the summer of 1750 where his father was the resident composer. However, Michael&#x27;s career as a vocalist and actor was not prolonged for much longer. Charles Burney wrote that Michael&#x27;s father &quot;tried to make him a singer, but he was naturally idle and not very quick. However, he acquired a powerful hand on the harpsichord&quot;. Michael&#x27;s obvious lack of enthusiasm for singing prevailed and he focused primarily on music composition and organ and harpsichord performance after the summer of 1750. On 5 February 1751 he gave his first solo organ concert, which featured one of his father&#x27;s organ concertos; he went on to be the principal exponent of his father&#x27;s organ works for the next thirty years. Arne also showed an early talent as a composer, and his first collection of vocal art songs entitled &quot;The Floweret&quot; was published in 1750. The collection included the Scottish-style song &quot;The Highland Laddie&quot;, which became popular and as late as 1775 was adapted by Thomas Linley the elder in &quot;The Duenna&quot;.

===Mid-life and career===

During the 1750s and 1760s, Arne worked as an organist and harpsichordist and composer to the theatres and pleasure gardens of London. He married in the 1750s to a now unknown woman who died only a few years into their marriage. From 1756 onwards he composed a considerable amount of music for the stage, much in the same vein as his father. He wrote several successful operas, a significant amount of incidental music for plays, and published several song collections. Several of his songs were written for performance in London&#x27;s pleasure gardens. One of his best-known songs is &quot;Lass with the Delicate Air&quot;, which premiered in 1762. In 1764 he collaborated with Jonathan Battishill in setting Richard Rolt’s &quot;Almena&quot;, which was a theatrical flop but praised for its fine music. The previous year he had met soprano Elizabeth Wright after hearing her perform at Ranelagh Gardens. The two became romantically involved and married in 1766. The following year Elizabeth sang the title role in his opera &quot;Cymon&quot;. The work used a libretto by David Garrick and was the greatest success of his career. Arne&#x27;s wife sang in several more of his stage works as well as other productions in leading roles at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane throughout the 1760s.

In 1766 Arne built a laboratory at Chelsea in order to pursue his interest in alchemy. His hobby quickly turned into an obsession, and he was soon suffering financially due to the expenses of this pursuit. These financial problems caused a considerable amount of stress and tension in his marriage, and Arne ended up in debtor&#x27;s prison in early 1769. Elizabeth died on 1 May 1769 while he was in prison, and Charles Burney blamed Arne for his wife&#x27;s early death due to the overwork and stress he had subjected her to. Somewhat humbled, Arne abandoned his pursuit of alchemy and by the early 1770s was financially stable again.

===Later life and career===

Up until this point Arne had spent his entire career working in London. However, in 1771–1772 he traveled to Germany, touring the country in a series of concerts with his pupil Ann Venables. He notably conducted the German premiere of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; in Hamburg on 21 May 1772. After returning to England in the Fall of 1772 he married Miss Venables. He also spent some time working in Dublin, Ireland in 1775–1776. His opera &quot;The Maid of the Vale&quot; premiered at the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin on 12 February 1775, and in December 1776 he was engaged by Thomas Ryder to produce &quot;Cymon&quot; in Dublin. Both productions featured his wife in leading roles and she became a highly popular attraction to the Dublin community.

While in Ireland, Arne began to pursue alchemy once more and he took a house at Clontarf in the hopes of discovering the philosopher&#x27;s stone. His pursuits again led him into debt, and he was arrested and confined to a Dublin sponging-house. While there he was assisted by the father of Michael Kelly, later a famous tenor, who provided him with a piano in return for young Kelly&#x27;s daily lesson. In this way Arne was able to teach students and thereby earn money to pay off his creditors.

The Arnes returned to London in 1777, and Michael was engaged as composer at Covent Garden for several seasons. In 1781 he was notably hired to provide a harpsichord accompaniment for &quot;Eidophusikon&quot;, a display of moving pictures. In 1784–1785 he worked at the Haymarket Theatre as the director and conductor of the Lenten Oratorios. Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1778, Michael inherited the majority of his father&#x27;s assets, which included a number of unpublished manuscripts. Included among these were several organ concertos written in 1750s, and in 1784 Michael announced his intention to publish them. However, Michael died in poverty without having done so, leaving his wife destitute. The organ concertos were preserved and later published in 1787 by John Groombridge.

Michael Arne had a daughter Sarah who was a leading singer at Drury Lane from 1795 to 1800. It is uncertain as to whether she was a daughter from his second or third marriage. Records also indicate that he had a daughter known as Jemima who nursed him while he was ill at the end of his life. It is possible that Jemima and Sarah may be the same person, or that they are indeed two different people.

==Works==
Arne was a moderately prolific composer. He wrote nine operas, collaborated on at least 15 others, wrote a small amount of incidental music for plays, and published seven song collections. He also wrote a small amount of music for the harpsichord and organ, some of which was published in 1761. Like his father, Arne wrote in the popular galante style of the day and utilized both rudiments of English folk music and Italian opera in his compositions. The following is a complete list of his stage works and published works.

<doc id="162338" wikidata="Q840405" url="?curid=162338" title="The Offspring (album)">
<text>The Offspring is the debut studio album by American rock band the Offspring, released on June 15, 1989, by Nemesis Records. After being out of print for years, the album was re-released by Nitro and Epitaph Records in 1995 with a different album cover. Both the re-releases on the two respective labels are nearly identical. The Offspring has rarely played any songs from this album live since the Ignition tour finished in 1994.

==Background and history==
After recording a demo tape in 1988, the Offspring began preparations for their first full-length album. They recorded it in March 1989 at South Coast Recording in Santa Ana, California, with Thom Wilson producing. During the sessions, the band re-recorded their early songs &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Waiting&quot; and &quot;Blackball&quot;, which both originally appeared on the band&#x27;s 1986 single &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Waiting&quot;.

The album was released on June 15, 1989, in limited numbers by Nemesis Records, only in 12&quot; vinyl and cassette format. When it was released, the album initially sold 5,000 copies and it took the band two and a half years to sell them all. The album&#x27;s closing track &quot;Kill the President&quot; was met with a great deal of controversy and as a result, one of the copies was destroyed by Wally George at his show &quot;Hot Seat&quot; in 1992, thus leaving only 4,999 copies left. This song was removed from the reissues after 2001. Some copies also have the Cargo Records logo next to the Nemesis logo on the back cover. To support the album, The Offspring embarked on a six-week national tour, but Noodles was stabbed during a performance at the Hollywood anti-nuclear benefit. Following the small success of &quot;The Offspring&quot;, the band signed with Epitaph Records in 1991.

&quot;Beheaded&quot; is the only song of the album that is still played live on special occasions and has been played at least 46 times as of August 2023. The Offspring has rarely played any songs from the rest of the album.

For a long time, it had been incorrectly assumed that there were three distinct recordings of &quot;Hey Joe&quot; due to the song being erroneously credited as &quot;previously unreleased&quot; when it was re-released officially in 1996.

==Reception==
&quot;The Offspring&quot; received mixed reviews. AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated that &quot;The Offspring&quot; &quot;is a rawer, harder-edged collection than their breakthrough set, &quot;Smash&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it&#x27;s a better record&quot;, and that it &quot;lacks the metal guitar crunch that dominated &quot;Smash&quot;.&quot;.

&quot;The Offspring&quot; did not initially reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart or become a commercial success. However, when the album was reissued in 1995, it reached a peak position of number 85 on the Dutch Chart for three weeks.

==Reissues==
&quot;The Offspring&quot; was reissued several times, with formats in different countries, and with different labels (see the table below). The album was reissued on CD (and again on vinyl and cassette) in 1995, a year after the Offspring&#x27;s commercial success with its third studio album &quot;Smash&quot;. This version is nearly identical to the one released on Nemesis. It features a different artwork instead of the controversial &quot;Guitar Alien&quot; front cover artwork, designed by Marc Rude. The album was reissued once again on Nitro in 2001, with &quot;Kill the President&quot; omitted; according to frontman Dexter Holland, it was removed to prevent legal pressure falling upon the band and Nitro. Coinciding with Record Store Day, &quot;The Offspring&quot; was reissued in 2017 on blue translucent vinyl; like the 2001 reissue, it does not include &quot;Kill the President&quot;.

==Album covers==
Two covers of this album exist. The original version features an image of a man&#x27;s body exploding as the xenomorph from the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise holding a Fender Stratocaster emerges from his chest. There is a report, which remains unconfirmed, that the album was banned from retail stores due to the &quot;grotesque&quot; cover.

The 1995 re-release shows a different image which features a blurry black-and-white picture of a person&#x27;s face. It was later admitted that the band and their studio never really liked the original cover and the re-release gave them an opportunity to change it. The reissue art was done by Mackie Osbourne.

The shadows on the back cover of the 1995 reissue also appear on the cover of the &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Waiting&quot; single.

<doc id="162344" wikidata="Q726153" url="?curid=162344" title="Epitaph Records">
<text>Epitaph Records is an American independent record label owned by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz. A large portion of the record label, known as Hellcat Records, is owned by Tim Armstrong, frontman of the punk rock band Rancid. Several sister labels also exist, such as ANTI-, Burning Heart Records, Hellcat Records, and Heart &amp; Skull Records that have signed other types of bands.

==History==

===Early years (1980s)===
Brett Gurewitz formed Epitaph Records as a vehicle for releases by his band Bad Religion. The name had been taken from the King Crimson Cold War protest song &quot;Epitaph&quot; from which the lyrics &quot;Confusion will be my epitaph.&quot; had struck a chord with Brett and Greg when they were young. Its first release for the label was Bad Religion&#x27;s 1981 self-titled EP, followed by their debut &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot;, which was also the label&#x27;s first full-length release. Also released during this period was &quot;Peace thru Vandalism&quot;, an EP by the Vandals, who were the first band besides Bad Religion to sign to Epitaph. Two more Bad Religion releases followed – &quot;Into the Unknown&quot; and the EP &quot;Back to the Known&quot; – before their temporary split. After Gurewitz had cleaned up his drug issues, both Epitaph and Bad Religion were revived in 1987. In the following year, Epitaph released its first record as a proper label, which was L7&#x27;s self-titled album, and it was distributed by Chameleon. Also in 1988, Bad Religion released &quot;Suffer&quot;, which was both released and distributed by Epitaph.

In 1989, Gurewitz signed NOFX to Epitaph. They released their debut for the label, &quot;S&amp;M Airlines&quot;, that same year, featuring the video for its title track and the cover of Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;, which featured guest vocals by Gurewitz and Greg Graffin, also a member of Bad Religion. This was followed by Bad Religion&#x27;s next two albums – &quot;No Control&quot; and &quot;Against the Grain&quot; – which sold 60,000 and 100,000 copies respectively.

===Breakthrough success (1990s)===
By 1993, more punk acts had signed to Epitaph, and the label relocated to new offices in Silver Lake, Los Angeles.

Although Bad Religion was the founding band of Epitaph, releasing their early records through the label, they switched over to Atlantic in 1993, with &quot;Recipe for Hate&quot; being their first record outside of the label. Brett Gurewitz is thought to have left Bad Religion as a result of internal disputes, but actually left the band in 1994 so he could run Epitaph full-time.

===Change in style (2000s)===
In 2001, Brett Gurewitz returned to Bad Religion, and the band returned to Epitaph Records, releasing seven more albums, the latest being &quot;Age of Unreason&quot; (2019).

In mid-2005 Epitaph was added to the official list of RIAA members along with several other high-profile independent labels. The reason for the listing is not clear, but one source points to an agreement for internet P2P distribution. Another source claims label management joined RIAA to get certified sales awards (i.e., official &quot;Gold&quot; or &quot;Platinum&quot; record status) for releases. This sparked some controversy as some feel they should no longer be labeled independent if they are a member of the RIAA. However, the only source that has actually been used for these claims of membership is the official RIAA membership list, which has been disputed. As of this writing, not only is Epitaph listed as an official member but Lookout! Records is once again listed, after being falsely listed before. In addition, Fat Wreck Chords has released statements denying their own involvement in the RIAA, condemning the organization.

===Recent years (2010s)===
Epitaph signed Weezer in 2010, the label releasing &quot;Hurley&quot; later that year. The label signed Social Distortion in the same year. Epitaph signed Australian punk band Dangerous! in 2011 and released album &quot;Teenage Rampage&quot;. Epitaph had also signed the Canadian punk rock band Propagandhi. The label has also been more active in signing bands from the emo revival including The Menzingers, Joyce Manor, Pianos Become the Teeth, Defeater, the World Is a Beautiful Place &amp; I Am No Longer Afraid to Die, and Touché Amoré.

==Sales certifications==
Epitaph has issued two albums that have been certified as platinum or multi-platinum, for sales of over 1 million units, by the Recording Industry Association of America: &quot;Smash&quot; by the Offspring, which has been certified six-times platinum, and &quot;...And Out Come the Wolves&quot; by Rancid, which has been certified platinum.

Seven albums released by the label, or its subsidiaries Hellcat and ANTI-, have been certified gold for sales of 500,000 copies: &quot;Ignition&quot; by the Offspring, &quot;Punk in Drublic&quot; by NOFX, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; by Rancid, &quot;&quot; by Tom Waits, &quot;The Drug in Me Is You&quot; and &quot;Popular Monster&quot; by Falling in Reverse, &quot;The Warrior&#x27;s Code&quot; by Dropkick Murphys and &quot;Sempiternal&quot; by Bring Me the Horizon.

<text>David Ashworth Gates (born December 11, 1940) is a retired American singer-songwriter, guitarist, musician and producer, frontman and co-lead singer (with Jimmy Griffin) of the group Bread, which reached the top of the musical charts in Europe and North America on several occasions in the 1970s. The band was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame.

==Life and early career==
Originally from Tulsa, Oklahoma, Gates was surrounded by music from infancy, as the son of Clarence Gates, a band director, and Wanda Rollins, a piano teacher. He became proficient in piano, violin, bass and guitar by the time he enrolled in Tulsa&#x27;s Will Rogers High School. Gates formed his first band, The Accents, with other high school musicians which included a piano player, Claude Russell Bridges, who later in life changed his name to Leon Russell. During a concert in 1957, the Accents backed Chuck Berry. In 1957, David Gates and the Accents released the 45 &quot;Jo-Baby&quot; / &quot;Lovin&#x27; at Night&quot; on Robbins record label. The A-side was written for his sweetheart, Jo Rita, whom he married in 1959 while enrolled at the University of Oklahoma studying law and pre-med. At Oklahoma he became a member of Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity.

In 1961, he and his family moved to Los Angeles, where Gates continued writing songs, and he worked as a music copyist, as a studio musician, and as a producer for many artists – including Pat Boone. Success soon followed. His composition &quot;Popsicles and Icicles&quot; hit No. 3 on the US Hot 100 for The Murmaids in January 1964. The Monkees recorded another of his songs, &quot;Saturday&#x27;s Child&quot;. By the end of the 1960s, he had worked with many leading artists, including Elvis Presley, The Walker Brothers, Bobby Darin, Merle Haggard, The Ventures, Duane Eddy and Brian Wilson. In 1965, Gates arranged the Glenn Yarbrough hit, &quot;Baby the Rain Must Fall&quot;. In 1966, he produced two singles on A&amp;M Records for Captain Beefheart and The Magic Band.

Gates scored his first motion picture &quot;Journey to Shiloh&quot; in 1967.

In the meantime, Gates had been releasing singles of his own on several labels in the early 1960s. On Mala Records, he released &quot;There&#x27;s a Heaven&quot; / &quot;She Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ll Be My Baby&quot; / &quot;What&#x27;s This I Hear&quot;, &quot;The Happiest Man Alive&quot; / &quot;A Road That Leads to Love&quot;, and &quot;Jo Baby&quot; / &quot;Teardrops in My Heart&quot;. On Planetary, he released &quot;Little Miss Stuck Up&quot; / &quot;The Brighter Side&quot;, and &quot;Let You Go&quot; / &quot;Once upon a Time&quot; under the pseudonym of &quot;Del Ashley&quot; in 1965. On Del-Fi, he released &quot;No One Really Loves a Clown&quot; / &quot;You Had It Comin&#x27; to Ya&quot;. He also released a single under the name of &quot;The Manchesters&quot; in 1965 on the Vee-Jay label.

==Bread and fame==

In 1967, Gates produced and arranged the debut album for a band called The Pleasure Fair, of which Robb Royer was a member. A little over a year later, Gates and Royer got together with Jimmy Griffin to form Bread. The group was signed by the Elektra record company, where it would remain for the eight years of its existence. Elektra released Bread&#x27;s first album, &quot;Bread&quot;, in 1969, which peaked at No. 127 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The first single, &quot;Dismal Day&quot;, written by Gates, was released in June 1969 but did not sell well.

Bread&#x27;s second album, &quot;On the Waters&quot; (the title a wordplay on Ecclesiastes 11:1; &quot;&quot;Cast thy bread upon the waters&quot;: for thou shalt find it after many days.&quot;), with a new drummer, Mike Botts, was released in 1970, and became a breakout success. It contained the No. 1 single &quot;Make It with You&quot; and was the first of seven consecutive Bread albums to go gold in the US. Bread&#x27;s next three albums, &quot;Manna&quot; (1971), &quot;Baby I&#x27;m-a Want You&quot; (1972) (featuring Larry Knechtel as a new member of the band, replacing Royer) and &quot;Guitar Man&quot; (1972) were also successful, with more chart singles and gold records. From 1970 to 1973, Bread charted 11 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and all were written and sung by Gates. That caused some antagonism between Gates and Griffin, who was also a significant contributor to Bread&#x27;s albums as a singer and songwriter. Bread disbanded in 1973. Their last concert was performed at the Salt Palace in Salt Lake City, Utah on May 19, 1973.

Gates recorded and produced his solo album &quot;First&quot; in 1973. The single &quot;Clouds&quot;, an edited version of the album track &quot;Suite Clouds and Rain&quot;, peaked at No. 47 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart, and No. 3 on the Adult Contemporary chart. The full album version was played extensively by Radio Caroline presenter Samantha Dubois at the end of her early morning radio programme, and became her closing theme. A second single, &quot;Sail Around the World&quot;, reached No. 50 on the singles chart and No. 11 on the Adult Contemporary chart. The album reached No. 107 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. In 1975, Gates released the album &quot;Never Let Her Go&quot;. The title track was released as a single, and reached No. 29 on the Hot 100 chart and No. 3 on the Adult Contemporary chart. The album itself reached No. 102 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Bread reunited in 1976 for one album, &quot;Lost Without Your Love&quot;, released late that year. The title track—again written and sung by Gates—reached No. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. At the end of 1977, Gates released what would be his most successful single as a solo artist, &quot;Goodbye Girl&quot;, from the 1977 film The Goodbye Girl. It peaked at No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1978. To capitalize on that success, Gates put an album together in June 1978 that featured material from his first two solo albums mixed with some new material. It yielded another hit single, &quot;Took the Last Train&quot;, which reached No. 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 but the album itself made it only to No. 165 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In 1978, Gates and Bread guest starred on an episode of &quot;The Hardy Boys Mysteries&quot;.

Botts and Knechtel from Bread, along with Warren Ham, brother Bill Ham and bassist David Miner, continued to record and tour with Gates. In late 1978, they toured billing themselves as &quot;David Gates &amp; Bread&quot;, which brought a lawsuit from Griffin, who was still co-owner of the Bread trademark, and an injunction against the use of the name Bread. By the end of 1978, the &quot;Bread&quot; moniker had been dropped and they continued on as &quot;David Gates and His Band&quot;. The dispute was not resolved until 1984.

Gates released the albums &quot;Falling in Love Again&quot; (featuring &quot;Where Does the Loving Go&quot;), which peaked at No. 46 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1979, and &quot;Take Me Now&quot;, which peaked at No. 62, in 1981. He recorded a duet with Melissa Manchester, &quot;Wish We Were Heroes&quot;, included in her 1982 album &quot;Hey Ricky&quot;. Gates was less active in music during the remainder of the 1980s. He concentrated on operating a cattle ranch in the Fall River Valley of Northern California, located on land he purchased in the 1970s. He returned to music in 1994, when he released &quot;Love Is Always Seventeen&quot;, his first new album in thirteen years.

Gates and Griffin put aside their differences, and reunited for a final Bread tour in 1996–97 with Botts and Knechtel. With the deaths of three of the other principal members of Bread, Gates is the sole surviving band member from their heyday, although Royer still successfully works in Nashville.

&quot;The David Gates Songbook&quot;, containing earlier hit singles and new material, was released in 2002. Engelbert Humperdinck included &quot;Baby I&#x27;m-a Want You&quot; on his 1972 album &quot;In Time&quot; and &quot;If&quot; on his 2003 album &quot;Definition of Love&quot;. Frank Sinatra covered &quot;If&quot; in a live performance at Madison Square Garden on October 12, 1974, which was recorded by Reprise. Gates&#x27;s songs have been recorded by many artists, including Telly Savalas, who had a UK No. 1 hit with &quot;If&quot; in 1975; Vesta Williams, who made a rendition of &quot;Make It with You&quot; in 1988; the band CAKE, which covered &quot;The Guitar Man&quot; in 2004; Ray Parker Jr., who also recorded &quot;The Guitar Man&quot; in 2006; and Boy George, who took &quot;Everything I Own&quot; to No. 1 on the UK chart, when he covered the Ken Boothe reggae version of Gates&#x27;s song, which itself had been a UK No. 1 in 1974. Jack Jones recorded a Bread tribute album, &quot;Bread Winners&quot; (1972) including the Gates&#x27; standard, &quot;If&quot;, which has long been a staple of Jones&#x27; live performances.

==Personal life==
According to a 1996 article in &quot;People&quot;, Gates has remained married to high school sweetheart Jo Rita since 1959. Together they raised four children: three lawyers and a cardiothoracic surgeon. Gates, who studied the cattle ranching business while touring with Bread, purchased a cattle ranch financed by royalties he earned during his time with the band. He lives happily with his wife in Mount Vernon, Washington, enjoying his retirement.

<text>Microvilli (: microvillus) are microscopic cellular membrane protrusions that increase the surface area for diffusion and minimize any increase in volume, and are involved in a wide variety of functions, including absorption, secretion, cellular adhesion, and mechanotransduction.

==Structure==
Microvilli are covered in plasma membrane, which encloses cytoplasm and microfilaments. Though these are cellular extensions, there are little or no cellular organelles present in the microvilli.

Each microvillus has a dense bundle of cross-linked actin filaments, which serves as its structural core. 20 to 30 tightly bundled actin filaments are cross-linked by bundling proteins fimbrin (or plastin-1), villin and espin to form the core of the microvilli.

In the enterocyte microvillus, the structural core is attached to the plasma membrane along its length by lateral arms made of myosin 1a and Ca2+ binding protein calmodulin. Myosin 1a functions through a binding site for filamentous actin on one end and a lipid binding domain on the other. The plus ends of the actin filaments are located at the tip of the microvillus and are capped, possibly by capZ proteins, while the minus ends are anchored in the terminal web composed of a complicated set of proteins including spectrin and myosin II.

The space between microvilli at a cell&#x27;s surface is called the intermicrovillous space. Intermicrovillous space increases with contractile activity of myosin II and tropomyosin, and decreases when contraction ceases.

== Locations ==
Thousands of microvilli form a structure called the brush border that is found on the apical surface of some epithelial cells, such as the small intestines. (Microvilli should not be confused with intestinal villi, which are made of many cells. Each of these cells has many microvilli.)
Microvilli are observed on the plasma surface of eggs, aiding in the anchoring of sperm cells that have penetrated the extracellular coat of egg cells. Clustering of elongated microtubules around a sperm allows for it to be drawn closer and held firmly so fusion can occur. They are large objects that increase surface area for absorption.

Microvilli are also of importance on the cell surface of white blood cells, as they aid in the migration of white blood cells.

== Relationship to cell ==
Microvilli are formed as cell extensions from the plasma membrane surface.

Actin filaments, present in the cytosol, are most abundant near the cell surface. These filaments are thought to determine the shape and movement of the plasma membrane.

The nucleation of actin fibers occurs as a response to external stimuli, allowing a cell to alter its shape to suit a particular situation.

This could account for the uniformity of the microvilli, which are observed to be of equal length and diameter. This nucleation process occurs from the minus end, allowing rapid growth from the plus end.

Though the length and composition of microvilli is consistent within a certain group of homogenous cells, it can differ slightly in a different part of the same organism.

For example, the microvilli in the small and large intestines in mice are slightly different in length and amount of surface coat covering.

==Function==
Microvilli function as the primary surface of nutrient absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Because of this vital function, the microvillar membrane is packed with enzymes that aid in the breakdown of complex nutrients into simpler compounds that are more easily absorbed. For example, enzymes that digest carbohydrates called glycosidases are present at high concentrations on the surface of enterocyte microvilli. Thus, microvilli not only increase the cellular surface area for absorption, they also increase the number of digestive enzymes that can be present on the cell surface. Microvilli are also present on immune cells, allowing the immune cells to sense features on the surface of pathogens and other antigen-presenting cells.

===Glycocalyx===
The microvilli are covered with glycocalyx, consisting of peripheral glycoproteins that can attach themselves to a plasma membrane via transmembrane proteins.

This layer may be used to aid binding of substances needed for uptake, to adhere nutrients or as protection against harmful elements.

It can be another location for functional enzymes to be localized.

==Clinical significance==
===Destruction===
The destruction of microvilli can occur in certain diseases because of the rearrangement of cytoskeleton in host cell. 
This is seen in infections caused by EPEC subgroup &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, in celiac disease, and microvillus inclusion disease (an inherited disease characterized by defective microvilli and presence of cytoplasmic inclusions of the cell membrane other than the apical surface).

The destruction of microvilli can actually be beneficial sometimes, as in the case of elimination of microvilli on white blood cells which can be used to combat auto immune diseases.

Congenital lack of microvilli in the intestinal tract causes microvillus atrophy, a rare, usually fatal condition found in new-born babies.

<doc id="162353" wikidata="Q3282117" url="?curid=162353" title="Don't Let's Start">
<text>&quot;Don&#x27;t Let&#x27;s Start&quot; is a song by the alternative rock band They Might Be Giants, from their 1986 eponymous debut album. It was the first single released from the album, released as a maxi-single. The single peaked at number 94 on the Australian ARIA singles chart in 1988. It was re-released by Elektra in 1990 after the success of the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Flood&quot;.

==Lyrical content==
The lyrics of &quot;Don&#x27;t Let&#x27;s Start&quot; include a number of dark, pointed statements, such as &quot;everybody dies frustrated and sad, and that is beautiful.&quot; John Linnell has repeatedly insisted that some of the song&#x27;s lyrical twists, though pondered extensively by fans, were constructed to complement the melody and were not necessarily meaningful. Asked about the origin of the song&#x27;s obscure lyrics, Linnell replied &quot;where did it come from? I made it up.&quot;

==Music video==
A music video was produced for the song, and it found some success at that time on MTV. It was included on MTV&#x27;s 1999 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Music Videos Ever Made&quot; at #89. The video was directed by Adam Bernstein and was filmed inside the New York State Pavilion in Flushing Meadows Park, the site of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The band is featured wearing tall hats which, according to John Flansburgh on Tumblr, consist of &quot;a large piece of semi-rigid cardstock (cut in a little arc) covered with a light bolt of red velvet fabric from a fabric store.&quot; The video also features large cardboard cutouts of the face of William Allen White. His face also appears on the &quot;Don&#x27;t Let&#x27;s Start&quot; CD single, and it has frequently been used in other contexts associated with They Might Be Giants.

<doc id="162364" wikidata="Q155691" url="?curid=162364" title="Paul-Henri Spaak">
<text>Paul-Henri Charles Spaak (; 25 January 1899 – 31 July 1972) was an influential Belgian Socialist politician, diplomat and statesman who thrice served as the prime minister of Belgium and later as the second secretary general of NATO. Along with Robert Schuman, Alcide De Gasperi and Konrad Adenauer, he was a leader in the formation of the institutions that evolved into the European Union.

A member of the influential Spaak family, he served briefly in World War I before he was captured, and rose to prominence after the war as a tennis player and lawyer, becoming famous for his high-profile defence of an Italian student accused of attempting to assassinate Italy&#x27;s crown prince in 1929. A convinced socialist, Spaak entered politics in 1932 for the Belgian Workers&#x27; Party (later the Belgian Socialist Party) and gained his first ministerial portfolio in the government of Paul Van Zeeland in 1935. He became the prime minister in 1938 and held the position until 1939. During World War II, he served as foreign minister in the London-based Belgian government in exile under Hubert Pierlot, where he negotiated the foundation of the Benelux Customs Union with the governments of the Netherlands and Luxembourg. After the war, he twice regained the premiership, first for under a month in March 1946 and again between 1947 and 1949. He held various further Belgian ministerial portfolios until 1966. He was Belgium&#x27;s foreign minister for 18 years between 1939 and 1966.

Spaak, a convinced supporter of multilateralism, became internationally famous for his support of international cooperation, in which he hoped to include geopolitical enemies of Belgium and NATO such as the Soviet Union and its satellite states. In 1945, he was chosen to chair the first session of the General Assembly of the new United Nations. A long-running supporter of European integration, Spaak had been an early advocate of customs union and had negotiated the Benelux agreement in 1944. He served as the first President of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe between 1949 and 1950 and became the first President of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) between 1952 and 1954. In 1955, he was appointed to the so-called Spaak Committee studying the possibility of a common market within Europe and played an influential role in preparing the 1957 Treaty of Rome which established the European Economic Community (EEC). He received the Charlemagne Prize the same year. Between 1957 and 1961, he served as the second secretary general of NATO, becoming the only secretary general to have previously served as prime minister until Anders Fogh Rasmussen in 2009.

Retiring from Belgian politics in 1966, Spaak died in 1972. He remains an influential figure in European politics and his name is carried, among other things, by a charitable foundation, one of the buildings of the European Parliament, and a method of negotiation.

== Personal background and life ==
Paul-Henri Spaak was born on 25 January 1899 in Schaerbeek, Belgium, to the distinguished Belgian family Spaak, of a branch that immigrated to Belgium in the 17th century, originally from Bohuslän in Sweden. His maternal grandfather, Paul Janson, was an important member of the Liberal Party. His mother, Marie Janson, was a socialist, and the first woman to enter the Belgian Senate, and his father, Paul Spaak, was a poet and playwright. Other noted members of his family included his uncle, Paul-Émile Janson, who served as Prime Minister of Belgium from 1937 to 1938, and his niece, Catherine Spaak, a movie star, singer and television presenter.

Paul-Henri Spaak and his wife Marguerite Malevez were married in 1921 and had three children: diplomat Fernand Spaak (1923–1981), Marie Marguerite Spaak (1926–2000, later married British diplomat Michael Palliser), and Antoinette Spaak (1928–2020), the first Belgian woman to lead a political party, the Democratic Front of Francophones. In 1943 Malevez was arrested by the Gestapo as a member of a resistance movement and imprisoned for a few weeks in Saint-Gilles Prison in Brussels. After his wife&#x27;s death on 14 August 1964, he married 56-year-old Antwerp-born divorcee and longtime friend Simonne Rikkers Hottlet Dear on 23 April 1965. His brother was the screenwriter Charles Spaak. One of his granddaughters is the journalist and novelist Isabelle Spaak, and one of his grandsons is the artist Anthony Palliser.

During the 1940s, during his time in New York with the United Nations, he also had an affair with the American fashion designer Pauline Fairfax Potter (1908–1976).

His son Fernand served in 1981 as chief of staff for Gaston Thorn, president of the European Commission, until he became the victim of his wife&#x27;s murder–suicide on 18 July 1981.

==Early life and education==
During World War I, Spaak attempted to join the Belgian Army but was captured by the Germans and spent the next two years in a German prisoner of war camp. At the end of the war, Spaak was released from captivity and entered the Université Libre de Bruxelles, where he studied law. During the same period, Spaak was also a tennis star, and played for the Belgian team in the 1922 Davis Cup.

After receiving his law degree, Spaak practised law in Brussels, where he &quot;excelled in defending Communists charged with conspiring against the security of the realm&quot;, and others including Fernando de Rosa, an anarchist Italian student who attempted to kill Crown Prince Umberto of Italy during a state visit by the prince to Brussels.

== Post-World War I Belgian politics ==
He became a member of the Socialist Belgian Labour Party in 1920. He was elected deputy in 1932. In 1935, he entered the cabinet of Paul Van Zeeland as Minister of Transport. In February 1936 he became Minister of Foreign Affairs, serving first under Van Zeeland and then under his uncle, Paul-Émile Janson. From May 1938 to February 1939 he was Prime Minister for the first time. In 1938, he allowed Herman Van Breda to smuggle the legacy of Edmund Husserl out of Nazi Germany to Belgium through the Belgian Embassy in Berlin.

In social policy, a number of progressive reforms were realised during Spaak&#x27;s first premiership. An Act of June 1938 &quot;increased the functions of the National Society for Cheap Houses and Dwellings and empowered it, under State guarantee, to contract a loan of 350 million francs,&quot; while a Royal Decree of July 1938 laid down the rules for applying the provisions of a Holidays with Pay Act passed in 1936 to agricultural, horticultural and forestry undertakings. An Act of 20 August 1938 amended and supplemented the 1936 Holidays with Pay Act by extending its coverage to all undertakings, whatever their number of wage earners, as well as to home workers. The Act also removed a previous requirement in which a wage earner had to work for at least a year with the same employer in order to earn an annual holiday. The old-age, invalidity, and survivors&#x27; insurance program for miners was modified by an act passed on 8 July 1938, which increased the benefits available to invalids, the elderly, and widows who already received pensions while also significantly expanding the requirements for the granting of invalidity pensions. 

An Order of 25 August 1938 prohibited the use of so-called motor spirit &quot;for greasing, cleaning (hands) etc.,&quot; while a Royal Order of 27 August 1938 fixed normal weekly hours of actual work in the ship-repairing industry in Antwerp at 42 hours &quot;distributed over the seven days of the week.&quot; 

A Royal Order of 27 December 1938 extended the scope of an eight-hour Act passed in June 1921 to cover technical staff employed in cinemas, and a Royal Order of 22 December 1938 amended the entries in the second column of the schedule (list of occupations) which was now brought into conformity with Convention No. 42, and added &quot;in the case of pneumoconiosis, sand-blasting processes in iron and steel foundries.

When he was Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1936 to 1940, Spaak adhered to the political independence of Belgium and carried on the long-standing Belgian policy of neutrality, with no formal military cooperation with France or the United Kingdom and no open hostility to the Germans. On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and France. In disarray and with almost all of the country occupied, the Belgian Army — by the command of King Leopold III — surrendered on May 18, leading to a constitutional conflict with part of the government (including Spaak), which wanted to continue military operations together with France. The rump of the Belgian government regrouped in Limoges and Bordeaux and stayed close to the French, who surrendered on 22 June. 

Again conflict arose in the Belgian government between those who wanted to stay in France (and maybe return to Belgium) — among these Spaak and Belgian Prime Minister Hubert Pierlot — and others who wanted to leave for London and to continue the war effort further. Minister Marcel-Henri Jaspar — done with the quarrelling — left on June 24 for London and tried to form a new government and obtain recognition from the British. For this, he was thrown out of the government at once by Pierlot and Spaak. 

After the repeal of diplomatic status by the French, Spaak finally went to Britain. Travelling in difficult circumstances with Pierlot through Spain and Portugal, partially even in the false bottom of a truck, they arrived in London in October 1940.

==Post-World War II domestic policies==
After the war, he was Minister of Foreign Affairs under the subsequent ministers Achille Van Acker and Camille Huysmans. He was twice appointed Prime Minister as well, first from 13 to 31 March 1946, the shortest government in Belgian history, and again from March 1947 to August 1949. During his last government, two important pieces of housing legislation were enacted. The De Taeye Act of 1948 organised fiscal rebates, credit facilities, and premiums for social dwellings built either on private or public initiative, while the Brunfaut Act of 1949 established a central budgeting organisation for governmental social housing policy, shifted the financial burden of infrastructural works to the state, and organised the financing of the two National Housing Societies. Under a law of 16th of June 1947 holiday duration was tripled for under 18 year olds, and doubled for those between the ages of 18 and 21. Holiday pay was also doubled for the first week by the law of August the 10th 1947.

A bill on war damage, agreed upon in October 1947, stipulated that owners of homes damaged by the war and took the initiative to restore them were entitled to compensation. In 1948, voting rights for women were introduced. An Act providing for the establishment of works councils was promulgated in September 1948, while a school building fund was set up that same year &quot;to supply the material needs of secondary education.&quot; Also in 1948, the multilateral school was introduced.

Various measures were also introduced to improve working conditions in mines. A decree of September 1947 introduced the compulsory establishment of mine safety services and safety and health committees in all mines, while another Decree issued that same month revised and expanded the provisions related to hygiene installations, medical examination, rescue, and first aid. Order of the regent regulating the use of explosives in undertakings other than mines and underground quarries dated 31 March 1949 “ deals with the loading, priming, tamping, firing and signalling of shots and policing of the area; certain special types of shotfiring such as firing in a confined space or underwater; incomplete explosions and misfires; liquid air or liquid oxygen explosives and the use of detonating fuses; supervision of the use of explosives; the reporting of accidents and incidents.” Automatic indexation of 95% of wages was provided from 1948 onwards, while women were provided with access to the magistracy from 1948 onwards.

In December 1948, an Act was passed that replaced the National Society for War Orphans with the National Society for Orphans, Widows and Ascendants of War Victims. Various measures were also introduced to improve working conditions in the mining industry. From June 1947 onward, all young workers under the age of 18 became entitled to three weeks&#x27; annual paid leave, while workers between the ages of 18 and 21 became entitled to at least a fortnight. In September 1947, Orders were promulgated providing for the supervision of health and hygiene in mines, surface mines and quarries. In June 1948, legislation was introduced that doubled holiday remuneration for workers, and in August 1948 a law was passed that introduced nonconfessional moral instruction in secondary education. Company and sector-based joint committees were alsoestablished by a social law, with work councils in big companies needing to be consulted whenever economic issues with a social impact were tackled.

==Foreign policies==
He was again foreign minister from April 1954 to June 1958 in the cabinet of Achille Van Acker and from April 1961 to March 1966 in the cabinets of Théo Lefèvre and Pierre Harmel. Although his political base was in the Socialist Party, he disagreed with its policies on several critical points, including Atlanticism, recognition of Franco&#x27;s Spain, and the language issue inside Belgium. During Spaak&#x27;s final term as Belgium&#x27;s Foreign Minister, he presided over Belgium granting independence to Burundi following the assassination of Prince Louis Rwagasore, the country&#x27;s first elected prime minister. Despite allegations of Belgian involvement in Rwagasore&#x27;s murder, Spaak appealed to Belgian King Baudouin not to grant Rwagasore&#x27;s convicted murderer a pardon.

=== UN ===
Spaak gained international prominence in 1945 when he was elected chairman of the first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. During the third session of the UN General Assembly in 1948 in Paris, Spaak apostrophized the delegation of the Soviet Union with the famous words: &quot;peur de vous&quot; (fear of you).

=== Europe ===

Spaak became a staunch supporter of regional cooperation and collective security after 1944. While still in exile in London, he promoted the creation of a customs union uniting Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg (see Benelux). In 1948 he helped organize a Congress that met in The Hague and pressed hard for the creation of the Council of Europe. In August 1949, at its first session, he was elected President of the Council of Europe&#x27;s Consultative Assembly, where he helped develop a network of intergovernmental contacts in many fields, and did his best to encourage further steps towards a political body to unite Europe. However, after three years of patient cajoling at the Council of Europe, Spaak came to understand that the organization was not ready to move towards the united Europe that he dreamed of, and in December 1951 - after the Assembly rejected a proposal to set up a European &quot;political authority&quot; - he resigned, declaring his great regret at this missed opportunity. But he continued to press for European integration as head of the European Movement, and it was not long before he returned to the fray, in a new and more promising forum: from 1952 to 1953, he presided over the Common Assembly of the European Coal and Steel Community, the body which was eventually to grow into the European Union.

But, as Spaak had shrewdly foreseen, tying the coal and steel industries of France and Germany together - at that time the two industries necessary to make war - was just the first step. His next goal was to expand the concept far beyond these two industries into a much wider economic body, which could in turn form the embryo of a political union. In 1955, the Messina Conference of European leaders appointed him as chairman of a preparatory committee (Spaak Committee) charged with the preparation of a report on the creation of a common European market. The so-called &quot;Spaak Report &quot; formed the cornerstone of the Intergovernmental Conference on the Common Market and Euratom at Val Duchesse in 1956 and led to the signature, on 25 March 1957, of the Treaties of Rome establishing a European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). Paul-Henri Spaak signed the treaty for Belgium, together with Jean Charles Snoy et d&#x27;Oppuers. It was a crowning achievement of decades of patient work, and his role in the creation of the EEC earned Spaak a place among the founding fathers of the European Union.

===NATO===
In 1956, he was chosen by the Council of NATO to succeed Lord Ismay as secretary general. He held this office from 1957 until 1961, when he was succeeded by Dirk Stikker. He feuded constantly with French president Charles de Gaulle. He publicly attacked de Gaulle, blaming him for unjustly and unwisely blocking NATO&#x27;s progress and stalling efforts toward European and Atlantic integration. De Gaulle was uncompromising on issues related to national sovereignty, mistrusted the United States and considered Britain to be an American puppet; he insisted on developing French nuclear capabilities. Although Spaak used every diplomatic method at his disposal, his opinion mattered little to the main players in NATO. When, in 1962, France, under de Gaulle, attempted to block both British entry to the European Communities and undermine their supranational foundation with the Fouchet Plan, Spaak working with Joseph Luns of the Netherlands rebuffed the idea. He was a staunch defender of the independence of the European Commission. &quot;Europe of tomorrow must be a supranational Europe,&quot; he declared. In honour of his work for Europe, the first building of the European Parliament in Brussels was named after him. When France withdrew from an active role in NATO in 1966, he was instrumental in the selection of Brussels as the new headquarters.

On 21 February 1961, Spaak was presented with the Medal of Freedom by US President John F. Kennedy.

== Retirement and death ==
Paul-Henri Spaak retired from politics in 1966. He was member of the Royal Belgian Academy of French Language and Literature. In 1969, he published his memoirs in two volumes titled &quot;Combats inachevés&quot; (&quot;The Continuing Battle&quot;, literally, &quot;unfinished fights&quot;). 

Spaak died aged 73, of kidney failure on 31 July 1972, in his home in Braine-l&#x27;Alleud near Brussels, and was buried in Braine-l&#x27;Alleud.

== Legacy ==
Paul-Henri Spaak, nicknamed &quot;Mr. Europe&quot;, was the main motive for one of the most recent and famous gold commemorative coins: the Belgian 3 pioneers of the European unification commemorative coin, minted in 2002. The obverse side shows a portrait with the names Robert Schuman, Paul-Henri Spaak and Konrad Adenauer, the three unifiers of Europe.

In the election for &quot;De Grootste Belg&quot; (The Greatest Belgian) Spaak ended on the 40th place in the Flemish version and on the 11th place in the Walloon version.

<doc id="162365" wikidata="Q2143151" url="?curid=162365" title="Sol Plaatje">
<text>Solomon Tshekisho Plaatje (9 October 1876 – 19 June 1932) was a South African intellectual, journalist, linguist, politician, translator and writer. Plaatje was a founding member and first General Secretary of the South African Native National Congress (SANNC), which became the African National Congress (ANC). The Sol Plaatje Local Municipality, which includes the city of Kimberley, is named after him, as is the Sol Plaatje University in that city, which opened its doors in 2014.

== Early life ==

Plaatje was born in Doornfontein near Boshof, Orange Free State (now Free State Province, South Africa), the sixth of eight sons. His grandfather&#x27;s name was Selogilwe Mogodi (1836-1881) but his employer, the Boer farmer Groenewald, nicknamed him Plaatje (&#x27;Picture&#x27;) in 1856 and the family started using this as a surname. His parents Johannes and Martha were members of the Tswana nation. They were Christians and worked for missionaries at mission stations in South Africa. When Solomon was four, the family moved to Pniel near Kimberley in the Cape Colony to work for a German missionary, Ernst Westphal (the grandfather of the linguist Ernst Westphal) and his wife Wilhelmine. There he received a mission-education. When he outpaced fellow learners he was given additional private tuition by Mrs. Westphal, who also taught him to play the piano and violin and gave him singing lessons. In February 1892, aged 15, he became a pupil-teacher, a post he held for two years.

After leaving school, he moved to Kimberley in 1894 where he became a telegraph messenger for the Post Office. He subsequently passed the clerical examination (the highest in the colony) with higher marks than any other candidate in Dutch and typing (reported by Neil Parsons in his foreword to &quot;Native Life in South Africa, Before and Since the European War and the Boer Rebellion&quot;). At that time, the Cape Colony had qualified franchise for all men 21 or over, the qualification being that they be able to read and write English or Dutch and earn over 50 pounds a year. Thus, when he turned 21 in 1897, he was able to vote, a right he would later lose when the Cape Colony was merged with other Southern African colonies into the Union of South Africa.

Shortly thereafter, he became a court interpreter for the British colonial authorities in Mafeking when the settlement was under siege and kept a diary of his experiences which were published posthumously.

After the Second Boer War ended, he was optimistic that the British government would ensure that all males in South Africa would continue to be granted qualified franchise, but they instead handed over the majority of political power to the new South African government, which restricted voting rights to white South Africans only. Plaatje criticised the British government for this decision in an unpublished 1909 manuscript entitled &quot;Sekgoma – the Black Dreyfus.&quot;

== Career ==

As an activist and politician, he spent much of his life in the struggle for the enfranchisement and liberation of African people. He was a founder member and first General Secretary of the South African Native National Congress (SANNC), which became the African National Congress (ANC) ten years later in 1922. As a member of an SANNC deputation, he traveled to England to protest against the Natives Land Act, 1913, and later to Canada and the United States where he met Marcus Garvey and W. E. B. Du Bois.

While he grew up speaking the Tswana language, Plaatje would become a polyglot. Fluent in at least seven languages, he worked as a court interpreter during the Siege of Mafeking, and translated works of William Shakespeare into Tswana. His talent for language would lead to a career in journalism and writing. He was editor and part-owner of &quot;Kuranta ya Becoana&quot; (&quot;Bechuana Gazette&quot;) in Mahikeng, and in Kimberley &quot;Tsala ya Becoana&quot; (&quot;Bechuana Friend&quot;) and &quot;Tsala ya Batho&quot; (&quot;The Friend of the People&quot;).

Plaatje was the first black South African to write a novel in English – &quot;Mhudi&quot;. He wrote the novel in 1919, but it was only published in 1930 (in 1928 the Zulu writer R. R. R. Dhlomo published an English-language novel, entitled &quot;An African Tragedy&quot;, at the missionary Lovedale Press, in Alice; this makes Dhlomo&#x27;s novel the first published black South African novel in English, even though Plaatje&#x27;s &quot;Mhudi&quot; had been written first). He also wrote &quot;Native Life in South Africa&quot;, which Neil Parsons describes as &quot;one of the most remarkable books on Africa by one of the continent&#x27;s most remarkable writers&quot;, and &quot;Boer War Diary&quot; that was first published 40 years after his death.

== Performing ==
Plaatje made three visits to Britain. There he met many people of similar views. One was the cinema and theatrical impresario George Lattimore who in 1923 was promoting with Pathé, &quot;Cradle of the World&quot;, the &quot;most marvellous and thrilling travel film ever screened&quot;. In a letter to the pan-Africanist W. E. B. Du Bois, Lattimore reported that he was having a &quot;successful run&quot; at the Philharmonic Hall in London. The show, which had the character of a revue, included live music and singing. Plaatje was recruited by Lattimore to take the role of an African tribesman.

Importantly, according to the SOAS University of London, this short-lived acting reflects a period of Plaatje&#x27;s life where he was &quot;desperately in need of money&quot;. Considering &quot;Cradle of the World&quot; and its simplistic depictions of indigenous culture, it is likely that Plaatje only would have participated if he desperately needed too. Plaatje, descended from the BaRong people of the Tswana-speaking nation; but was born and raised in a Lutheran Mission within the Orange Free State.

His recording of &quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot; with Sylvia Colenso at the piano is believed to be the earliest extant recording of what would become the national anthem of South Africa.

== Personal life ==

Plaatje was a committed Christian, and organised a fellowship group called the Christian Brotherhood at Kimberley. He was married to Elizabeth Lilith M&#x27;belle. They had six children – Frederick York St Leger, Halley, Richard, Violet, Olive and Johannes Gutenberg.

Plaatje&#x27;s &quot;Native Life&quot; by some scholars has containing a described as paternalistic attiude towards women. One such chapter is &#x27;Our Indebtedness to white women&#x27;, which reflects notions of domesticity prevalent at the time. Nonetheless, challenging this view is The British Newspaper Archive&#x27;s digitalisation of &#x27;The International Woman Suffrage News&#x27;.

In July 1923, a &#x27;Sol Plaatje, Esq&#x27; donated 4 shillings and 3 pence towards for the international suffragette cause. Notably, 1923 was a particularly bad time financially, yet Plaatje made this donation. While it is not clear why he made this donation, it does raise a few important questions regarding the tone in which &quot;Our Indebtedness to White Women&quot; forms.

What is clear is that white Women played various but important roles in his life. Firstly, Mrs Wilhelmine Westphal, who, upon her husband&#x27;s increasing role in the Mission&#x27;s governance, took a larger role in young Plaatje&#x27;s tutoring. Secondly, Georgiana Solomon and Jane Cobden, interceded on Plaatje&#x27;s behalf within the So-called Aborigines&#x27; Protection Society, to try and win him an audience, which triggered their expulsion. Thirdly, when he was writing &quot;Native Life&quot;, Landlady Alice Timerberlake did not chase the cash-strapped Plaatje for rent, allowing him to prioritise raising funds to publish &quot;Native Life&quot;. Returning back to Plaatje&#x27;s donation, Mrs G. M. Solomon appears on the same donation sheet.

Plaatje died of pneumonia at Pimville, Johannesburg on 19 June 1932 aged 55, and was buried in Kimberley. Over a thousand people attended the funeral.

== Recognition and legacy ==

Decades passed before Plaatje began to receive the recognition he deserved. &quot;Much of what he strove for came to nought,&quot; writes his biographer Brian Willan; &quot;his political career was gradually forgotten, his manuscripts were lost or destroyed, his published books largely unread. His novel &quot;Mhudi&quot; formed part of no literary tradition, and was long regarded as little more than a curiosity.&quot;

<text>The following is a list of heads of state of North Korea since its foundation in 1948.

== History ==
For most of its existence, North Korea has not specified a formal head of state. The 1948 constitution did not define a head of state, but with regard to political functions usually performed by the head of state, the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly (SPA) could be considered one. Kim Il Sung was, at the time, as Premier, merely the head of government but not of state. As his position grew more stable, he wanted to be recognized as the head of state instead. Foreign admirers first started calling him such, and in the 1972 constitution his position was formalized as the President of the republic.

After Kim Il Sung died in 1994, the presidency and hence the position of head of state was left vacant. While the late leader was titled the Eternal President of North Korea, the actual office of the President was written out of the constitution in 1998 making the head of state undefined again. His son and successor, Kim Jong Il, kept official titles given to him by the late president and never formally became the head of state. During this period, the president of the presidium of the SPA exercised many of the functions normally granted to a head of state, such as receiving ambassadors. Titles used by Kim Jong Un have constitutionally defined him as the Supreme Leader, but not formal head of state. However, amendments to the DPRK constitution in 2019 have granted the chairman of the State Affairs Commission (later renamed to president of the State Affairs), a title held by Kim, the status of representing the state and receiving and appointing ambassadors, effectively making him the head of state.

<doc id="162371" wikidata="Q352725" url="?curid=162371" title="Richard Brinsley Sheridan">
<text>Richard Brinsley Butler Sheridan (30 October 17517 July 1816) was an Anglo-Irish playwright, writer and Whig politician who sat in the British House of Commons from 1780 to 1812, representing the constituencies of Stafford, Westminster and Ilchester. The owner of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in London, he wrote several prominent plays such as &quot;The Rivals&quot; (1775), &quot;The Duenna&quot; (1775), &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; (1777) and &quot;A Trip to Scarborough&quot; (1777). He served as Treasurer of the Navy from 1806 to 1807. Sheridan died in 1816 and was buried at Poets&#x27; Corner in Westminster Abbey. His plays remain a central part of the Western canon and are regularly performed around the world.

==Early life==

Sheridan was born in 1751 in Dublin, Ireland, where his family had a house on the then fashionable Dorset Street. His mother, Frances Sheridan, was an Anglo-Irish playwright and novelist. She had two plays produced in London in the early 1760s, though she is best known for her novel &quot;The Memoirs of Miss Sidney Biddulph&quot; (1761). His Irish father, Thomas Sheridan, was for a while an actor-manager at the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin, but following his move to England in 1758, he gave up acting and wrote several books on the subject of education, especially the standardisation of the English language in education. His elder brother was Charles Francis Sheridan. His paternal grandfather was The Rev. Thomas Sheridan from County Cavan, who was a close friend of Jonathan Swift.

While his family was in Dublin, Richard attended the English Grammar School in Grafton Street. In 1758, when he was seven years old, the Sheridans moved permanently to England.

He was a pupil at Harrow School from 1762 to 1768. At the end of his 1768 school year, his father employed a private tutor, Lewis Ker, to direct his studies in his father&#x27;s house in London, while Domenico Angelo instructed him in fencing and horsemanship.

In 1772, aged 20 or 21, Sheridan fought two duels with Captain Thomas Mathews, who had written a newspaper article defaming the character of Elizabeth Ann Linley, whom Sheridan intended to marry. In the first duel, they agreed to fight in Hyde Park, but finding it too crowded they went first to the Hercules Pillars tavern (on the site where Apsley House now stands at Hyde Park Corner) and then on to the Castle Tavern in Henrietta Street, Covent Garden. Far from its romantic image, the duel was short and bloodless. Mathews lost his sword and, according to Sheridan, was forced to &#x27;beg for his life&#x27; and sign a retraction of the article. The apology was made public and Mathews, infuriated by the publicity the duel had received, refused to accept his defeat as final and challenged Sheridan to another duel. Sheridan was not obliged to accept this challenge but could have become a social pariah if he had not. The second duel, fought in July 1772 at Kingsdown near Bath, was a much more ferocious affair. This time both men broke their swords but carried on fighting in a &#x27;desperate struggle for life and honour&#x27;. Both were wounded, Sheridan dangerously, and he had to be &#x27;borne from the field with a portion of his antagonist&#x27;s weapon sticking through an ear, his breast-bone touched, his whole body covered with wounds and blood, and his face nearly beaten to jelly with the hilt of Mathews&#x27; sword&#x27;. Mathews escaped in a post chaise. Eight days after the bloody affair the &quot;Bath Chronicle&quot; was able to announce that Sheridan was out of danger.

Later that year, Elizabeth and the 21-year-old Richard eloped and set up house in London on a lavish scale. Sheridan had little money and no immediate prospects of any, other than his wife&#x27;s dowry. The young couple entered the fashionable world and apparently held up their end in entertaining. Sheridan was a patron of Margaret Cuyler and she was his presumed mistress. As his protégée she appeared at Drury Lane in January 1777, despite being a poor actress.

==Literary career==

In 1775 Sheridan&#x27;s first play, &quot;The Rivals&quot;, was produced at London&#x27;s Covent Garden Theatre. It was a failure on its first night, and John Lee&#x27;s performance as Sir Lucius O&#x27;Trigger was criticised for rendering the character &quot;ridiculous and disgusting&quot;. Sheridan rewrote the play and presented it again a few days later, with Laurence Clinch replacing Lee in the role. In its reworked form it was a huge success, immediately establishing the young playwright&#x27;s reputation and the favour of fashionable London. It went on to become a standard of English literature.

Shortly after the success of &quot;The Rivals&quot;, Sheridan and his father-in-law Thomas Linley the Elder, a successful composer, produced the opera &quot;The Duenna&quot;. This piece, warmly received, played for seventy-five performances.

His most famous play, &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;, premiered at Drury Lane on 8 May 1777. It is considered one of the greatest comedies of manners in English. It was followed by &quot;The Critic&quot; (1779), an updating of the satirical Restoration play &quot;The Rehearsal&quot;.

Having quickly made his name and fortune, in 1776 Sheridan bought David Garrick&#x27;s share in the Drury Lane patent, and in 1778 the remaining share; his later plays were all produced there. In 1778 Sheridan wrote &quot;The Camp&quot;, which commented on the ongoing threat of a French invasion of Britain. The same year Sheridan&#x27;s brother-in-law Thomas Linley, a young composer who worked with him at Drury Lane Theatre, died in a boating accident. Sheridan had a rivalry with his fellow playwright Richard Cumberland and included a parody of Cumberland in his play &quot;The Critic&quot;. On 24 February 1809 (despite the much vaunted fire safety precautions of 1794) the theatre burned down. On being encountered drinking a glass of wine in the street while watching the fire, Sheridan was famously reported to have said, &quot;A man may surely be allowed to take a glass of wine by his own fireside.&quot; Sheridan was the manager of the theatre for many years, and later became sole owner with no managerial role.

==Political career==

In 1780, Sheridan entered the House of Commons as the ally of Charles James Fox on the side of the American Colonials in the political debate of that year. He is said to have paid the burgesses of Stafford five guineas apiece to allow him to represent them. As a consequence, his first speech in Parliament was a defence against the charge of bribery.

In 1787 Sheridan demanded the impeachment of Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General of India. His speech in the House of Commons was described by Edmund Burke, Charles James Fox, and William Pitt as the greatest ever delivered in ancient or modern times.

In Commons, Sheridan was known as an engaging, and often entertaining orator. His speeches at the Hastings impeachment were later published as a 59-page booklet. In 1793, during the debates on the Aliens Act designed to prevent French Revolutionary spies and saboteurs from flooding into the country, Edmund Burke made a speech in which he claimed there were thousands of French agents in Britain ready to use weapons against the authorities. To dramatically emphasise his point he threw down a knife onto the floor of the House of Commons. Sheridan shouted, &quot;Where&#x27;s the fork?&quot;, which led to much of the house collapsing in laughter.

In April 1798 he appeared at the trial in Maidstone of United Irishmen accused of treasonable conspiracy with the French. Along with Charles James Fox, Lord Moira and other radical Whig grandees, he testified on behalf of Arthur O&#x27;Connor. O&#x27;Connor was acquitted. His companion, Father James Coigly was hanged.

During the invasion scare of 1803 Sheridan penned an &#x27;Address to the People&#x27;:

THEY, by a strange Frenzy driven, fight for Power, for Plunder, and extended Rule—WE, for our Country, our Altars, and our Homes.—THEY follow an ADVENTURER, whom they fear—and obey a Power which they &quot;hate&quot;—WE serve a &quot;Monarch&quot; whom we love—a God whom we adore...They call on us to barter all of Good we have inherited and proved, for the desperate Chance of Something better which they &quot;promise&quot;.—Be our plain Answer this: The Throne WE honour is the PEOPLE&#x27;S CHOICE—the Laws we reverence are our brave Fathers&#x27; Legacy—the Faith we follow teaches us to live in bonds of Charity with all Mankind, and die with Hope of Bliss beyond the Grave. Tell your &quot;Invaders&quot; this; and tell them too, we seek no Change; and, least of all, such Change as &quot;they&quot; would bring us.

He held the posts of Receiver-General of the Duchy of Cornwall (1804–1807) and Treasurer of the Navy (1806–1807). Sheridan was noted for his close political relationship with the Prince of Wales, leading a faction of his supporters in the Commons. By 1805 when the Prince was cooling on his previous support of Catholic Emancipation Sheridan, George Tierney and others announced their own opposition to it.

When, after 32 years in Parliament, he lost re-election in 1812, his creditors closed in on him and his last years were harassed by debt and disappointment. On hearing of his debts, the American Congress offered Sheridan £20,000 in recognition of his efforts to prevent the American War of Independence. He refused the offer.

==Death and commemoration==
In December 1815 Sheridan became ill and was largely confined to bed. He died in poverty. However, dukes, earls, lords, viscounts, the Lord Mayor of London, and other notables attended his funeral, and he was buried in the Poets&#x27; Corner of Westminster Abbey.

In 1825 the Irish writer Thomas Moore published a sympathetic two-volume biography, &quot;Memoirs of the Life of Richard Brinsley Sheridan&quot;, which became a major influence on subsequent perceptions. A Royal Society of Arts blue plaque was unveiled in 1881 to commemorate Sheridan at 14 Savile Row in Mayfair. Another plaque is in Stafford.

==Family life==

He was twice married. He and his first wife Elizabeth had a son:

*Thomas (Tom) Sheridan, who married Caroline Henrietta Callander, daughter of Col. Sir James Campbell of Craigforth, Stirling, and Ardkinglas Argyll, and was the father of Helen Blackwood, Baroness Dufferin and Claneboye, Caroline Norton and Georgiana Seymour, Duchess of Somerset
Elizabeth also had a daughter, Mary, born 30 March 1792 but fathered by her lover, Lord Edward FitzGerald. After Elizabeth&#x27;s death, Sheridan fulfilled his promise to look after Thomas and FitzGerald&#x27;s baby daughter. A nurse was employed to care for the child at his Wanstead home. The baby had a series of fits one evening in October 1793, when she was 18 months old, dying before a doctor could attend. She was interred beside her mother at Wells Cathedral.

In 1795, Richard B. Sheridan married Esther Jane Ogle (1776–1817), daughter of the Dean of Winchester. They had at least one child: Charles Brinsley Sheridan (1796–1843). At one time Sheridan owned Downe House, Richmond Hill in London.

==Affairs==
Sheridan was a womanizer. He had recorded affairs with Frances Crewe, Lady Crewe (he dedicated his 1777 play The School for Scandal to her), and a disastrous affair with Harriet Spencer, beginning in 1789. Sheridan&#x27;s affair with Harriet was disastrous for her, as the worst-case scenario actually happened: her abusive husband Viscount Duncannon walked in on Harriet and Sheridan having intercourse. Violently enraged, Duncannon immediately wanted to divorce Harriet. Divorce in the 18th century was social ruin for women, and Harriet narrowly escaped such calamity only when Duncannon&#x27;s father William Ponsonby, 2nd Earl of Bessborough and the powerful Cavendish clan sided with Harriet, making divorcing her social suicide.

Whilst attempting to win back his wife Eliza, one of multiple similar occasions, he conceived a child with a governess named Caroline Townsend in 1789. Sheridan&#x27;s friends, Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire and Henrietta Ponsonby, Countess of Bessborough helped him arrange for Caroline to go abroad to deliver, and adopted the baby, whom they named Fanny Mortimer. Fanny &quot;grew up at Devonshire House as a sort of foundling, inhabiting a nether world between the servants&#x27; quarters and the nursery. After Georgiana died in 1806, Harriet sent Fanny to private school and eventually saw her marry quite well. Fanny always suspected that either Harriet or Georgiana was her mother and never quite recovered from learning that her true mother was a mere governess.&quot;

==Character==
To his contemporaries, Sheridan was as known for his dazzling wit, lively humour, and political acuity as for his duplicitousness, vindictive nastiness, and general profligacy. Sheridan was a social-climber who had no qualms about backstabbing friends to maintain his social status amongst actual aristocrats and to gain power in Whig society. Perhaps the best summary of Sheridan&#x27;s character was by Sir Gilbert Elliot, Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto who observed to his wife: &quot;He employs a great deal of art, with a great deal of pain, to gratify, not the proper passion in such affairs, but vanity; and he deals in the most intricate plotting and under plotting, like a Spanish play.&quot; By 1789, Sheridan&#x27;s two-faced cunning made him despised by most of Whig society.

Like most of the Ton (le bon ton), Sheridan drank heavily and was a gambling addict, gambling most nights with money he did not have. Whilst most of his fellow gambling addicts attempted to pay their creditors, Sheridan pointedly never paid his debts, as he believed paying his creditors &quot;only encourages them.&quot;

Sheridan&#x27;s behaviour towards women in particular was dishonourable. A rake and professional storyteller, he was a gifted apologiser and made promises to his wives and lovers he knew he would never keep. Sheridan sexually harassed and assaulted women. An example of this is his sexual harassment and then assault of Lady Webster, later known as Lady Holland, Elizabeth Fox, Baroness Holland. After falsely accusing her of having an affair with a man she &quot;did not care for in the least&quot;, he threatened to ruin her by telling society of her imaginary affair. When Lady Webster did not submit to his advances, he retaliated by later assaulting her in her home. Lady Webster herself recorded the assault: &quot;...when I defied [his] threat he took another most extraordinary method – I was told one day that a servant had brought a message which he would deliver to no one but myself, and before I could order him to be admitted, in entered Sheridan, wrapped up in a great watchcoat, and after my servant had quitted the room he rushed up to me and with a ferociousness quite frightful bit my cheek so violently that the blood ran on down my neck – I had just enough sense to ring the bell and he withdrew.&quot;

By 1802, Sheridan&#x27;s despicable behaviour took an even more sinister turn, and he began harassing one of his few remaining friends, Harriet Spencer, Henrietta Ponsonby, Countess of Bessborough. In 1805, Sheridan had escalated his harassment of Harriet to anonymously sending her threatening letters; as they had been longtime friends and former lovers, Harriet quickly deduced the author&#x27;s identity as Sheridan&#x27;s from his handwriting. Sheridan accosted Harriet in public and made a scene any chance he could, reproaching her for not loving him enough and declaring his undying love for her. Despite his cruelty towards her, Harriet was kind to him on his deathbed in 1816. In return, Sheridan grasped her hand hard and told her he would haunt her after his death. Harriet, petrified, asked why, having persecuted her all his life, he was determined to continue his persecution after death. &quot;Because I am resolved you shall remember me.&quot; After enduring a few more minutes of his terror, Harriet fled the room. Three days later, Richard Brinsley Sheridan died alone.

==Adaptations and cultural references==

*Sheridan is played by Barry Stanton in the film &quot;The Madness of King George&quot; (1994). In &quot;The Duchess&quot; (2008), a film based on the life of Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, Sheridan is played by Aidan McArdle and &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; is performed in the movie. 
* Chris Humphreys has used the character of Jack Absolute from &quot;The Rivals&quot; as a basis for his books &quot;The Blooding of Jack Absolute&quot;, &quot;Absolute Honour&quot; and &quot;Jack Absolute&quot;. These are published under the name C. C. Humphreys.
* Sheridan was a village in Toronto Township, Ontario, named for R. B. Sheridan. Its name was later used by a neighbourhood, Sheridan Homelands, which is now part of the City of Mississauga. Sheridan was shortlisted as the name of the newly incorporated city in 1974, which lies just west of the province&#x27;s capital city of Toronto.
*In Jules Verne&#x27;s novel &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;, the protagonist, Phileas Fogg, is said to live at &quot;No. 7 Savile Row, Burlington Gardens, the house in which Sheridan died in 1814.&quot; While Sheridan did indeed live in Savile Row, he lived at No. 14 rather than at No. 7 (and he died in 1816, not in 1814 as claimed in the book).

<text>Clonaid is an American-based human cloning organization, registered as a company in the Bahamas. Founded in 1997, it has philosophical ties with the UFO religion Raëlism, which sees cloning as the first step in achieving immortality. On December 27, 2002, Clonaid&#x27;s chief executive, Brigitte Boisselier, claimed that a baby clone, named Eve, was born. Media coverage of the claim sparked serious criticism and ethical debate that lasted more than a year. Florida attorney Bernard Siegel tried to appoint a special guardian for Eve and threatened to sue Clonaid, because he was afraid that the child might be treated like a lab rat. Siegel, who heard the company&#x27;s actual name was not Clonaid, decided that the Clonaid project was a sham. Bioethicist Clara Alto condemned Clonaid for premature human experimentation and noted the high incidence of malformations and thousands of fetal deaths in animal cloning.

==Company founding==
On May 31, 1997, an issue of the popular science magazine &quot;New Scientist&quot; said that the International Raëlian Movement was starting a company to fund the research and development of human cloning. This alarmed bioethicists who were opposed to such plans. They warned lawmakers against failing to regulate human cloning. At the time, European countries such as Britain had banned human cloning, but the United States had merely a moratorium on the use of federal funds for human cloning research. U.S. President Bill Clinton requested that private companies pass their own moratorium. Claude Vorilhon, the founder of Raëlism, was opposed to this move and denied that the technology used to clone was inherently dangerous.

On June 15, 1998, Brigitte Boisselier said the headquarters of Clonaid was located in Las Vegas and that Clonaid did not have enough funds for human cloning research. On December 19, 1998, a &quot;New Scientist&quot; article said the cost of Clonaid cloning services would be $200,000, much lower than the $2.3 million that researchers at Texas A&amp;M University planned to use for cloning a dog named Missy. Mainstream scientists said it was unlikely that Clonaid would be able to clone anything in the near future. Although the project&#x27;s ultimate objective was human cloning, Boisselier said that pet cloning would help finance the operations.

===Premise===
On June 9, 1997, Clonaid stated its intention to offer homosexual and/or infertile couples the chance to have a genetically identical child and take a step toward immortality. According to an Internet announcement, the Raëlian leader and a group of investors founded a company in the Bahamas and called it &quot;Valiant Venture Ltd.&quot;, whose project mission was named Clonaid. Valiant Venture expected to have one million potential customers.

Claude Vorilhon held a meeting in a Montreal hotel on September 21, 2000, where he announced that a wealthy American couple was willing to fund the Clonaid project. The first pending clone, according to Vorilhon at the time, was the couple&#x27;s 10-month-old girl, who had died due to a medical mistake. He said that the couple was willing to pay $1,500,000 to clone their deceased daughter, but the wife was not willing to be the surrogate mother. Jamie Grifo, a fertility specialist at the New York University School of Medicine, and Nobel laureate Paul Berg of Stanford University said that Vorilhon was providing a false hope that the child was going to be the same one. Boisselier revealed the roles of four scientists she says were involved—&quot;a biochemist, a geneticist, a cell fusion expert and a French medical doctor&quot;—but without revealing their identity. She did not identify the wealthy American couple.

===Responses by scientists===
According to cloning specialist and physiologist George Seidel of Colorado State University, cloning a human being would not be difficult if many people donated their eggs or offered their wombs for implantation of clone embryos. Lee Silver, a molecular biologist from Princeton University, noted the advantages that Raëlians had, as a pro-cloning religious group, in finding willing surrogates. A biotechnology company called Advanced Cell Technology had cloned human embryo cells for medical purposes, and its CEO Michael D. West said that the directions for cloning a human being were available in published scientific literature. Experts knowledgeable of the scientific advances in the field have noted that human reproductive chemistry is better understood than that of most animals. For this reason, they thought that a higher rate of success was possible in human cloning compared with animal cloning. Brigitte Boisselier anticipated that the work could begin on the preserved cells as soon as October, but there was no evidence that Clonaid had medical knowledge necessary for its success. There was no evidence that the Clonaid claim was more than a publicity stunt. No verification or evidence proving that a successful clone has been made.

==Year before the alleged clone baby claim==
In the spring of 2001, the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations inspected Clonaid&#x27;s lab in the small city of Nitro in West Virginia. It was located inside a rented room within a former high school. Staff scientists reviewed the lab&#x27;s research documentation and found them inadequate, the work of a graduate student extracting ovum from cow ovaries from a slaughterhouse. The FDA said that the equipment in lab was state-of-the-art and had been bought by Mark Hunt, a former West Virginia state legislator, who wanted to clone his 10-month-old son, Andrew, who died in 1999 due to congenital heart disease. Following investigation of the West Virginia lab, Mark Hunt made an agreement with the FDA-OCI to not clone his dead son within the United States.

In March 2001, Boisselier said that a woman would be pregnant with a cloned fetus in April. She said that cells had reached the blastocyst stage, but she refused to speak of any specific implantation or pregnancy associated with them. According to a &quot;CNN&quot; article that November, the Clonaid laboratory was outside the United States. Clonaid claimed that it had developed human cloned embryos before Advanced Cell Technology was able to do the same. &quot;CNN&quot; could not confirm the unpublished work. Due to Clonaid&#x27;s association with Raëlians and the lack of evidence for cloning, authorities remained skeptical as to whether Clonaid could clone anything at all.

==Alleged clone baby Eve==
On Friday, December 27, 2002, Boisselier, a Raëlian bishop and CEO of Clonaid, announced at a press conference in Hollywood, Florida that Clonaid had successfully performed the first human reproductive cloning. Boisselier said that the mother delivered Eve by Caesarean section somewhere outside the United States and that both were healthy. Dr. Boisselier did not present the mother or child, or DNA samples that would allow for confirmation of her claim at the press conference. It has subsequently become apparent that she announced the birth before genetic testing to evaluate whether the child in question is actually a clone: Dr. Boisselier was therefore stating her belief that her procedure had resulted in a clone, not announcing results showing that the child was a clone.

Shortly after the announcement, Korean prosecutors raided the offices of Clonaid&#x27;s Korean branch, BioFusion Tech. In the process, the prosecutors removed records from homes and offices while barring two representatives of BioFusion Tech from leaving the country. An official company statement revealed that three Korean women applied to become surrogate mothers. Officials of BioFusion Tech told the prosecutors that 10 Korean women wanted to clone themselves and have filled out applications.

The Food and Drug Administration stated its intention to investigate Clonaid to see if it had done anything illegal. The FDA contended that its regulations forbid human cloning without prior agency permission. However, some members of the United States Congress believed that the jurisdiction of the FDA on human cloning matters was shaky and decided to push Congress to explicitly ban human cloning.

===Responses by politicians and ethicists===
US President George W. Bush said that human cloning was &quot;deeply troubling&quot; to most Americans. Kansas Republican Sam Brownback said that Congress should ban all human cloning, while some Democrats were worried that Clonaid&#x27;s announcement would lead to the banning of therapeutic cloning. FDA biotechnology chief Dr. Phil Noguchi warned that the human cloning, even if it worked, risked transferring sexually transmitted diseases to the newly born child. The White House was also critical of the claims.

Panos Zavos, a former professor of the University of Kentucky, at the time had plans to create human clone embryos, but he stated to the effect that Clonaid&#x27;s claims were without merit and that Eve did not exist. Severino Antinori, who had worked with Zavos on the development of human clone embryos, was critical of Klondyke&#x27;s announcement, and said of it that, &quot;An announcement of this type has no scientific corroboration and risks creating confusion.&quot; Robert Lanza of Advanced Cell Technologies said that Clonaid has no record of accomplishment for cloning anything, but he said that if Clonaid actually succeeded, there would be public unrest that may lead to the banning of therapeutic cloning, which has the capacity to cure millions of patients. The Vatican said that the claims expressed a mentality that was brutal and lacked ethical consideration. The Christian Coalition of America urged a human cloning ban and saw the alleged clone baby as an &quot;aberration&quot;.

University of Wisconsin–Madison bioethicist Alta Charo said that even in other ape-like mammals, the risk for miscarriage, birth defects, and life problems remains high. Arthur Caplan, the director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, expressed concerns that many dead and sick children could result from the cloning of human beings.

===Request for a temporary guardian===
Clonaid spokeswoman Nadine Gary claimed that Eve went home with her mother on December 30, 2002, but Florida attorney Bernard Siegel filed a petition as a private citizen in the Broward County Circuit Court requesting that a temporary guardian be appointed for the purported cloned child. Two local attorneys, Barry Wax and Jonathan Schwartz were retained to represent Clonaid in the matter. As the court case played out over the next month, Dr. Boisselier testified under oath that there was a cloned child born outside of the U.S. living in Israel. However, Clonaid did not present demonstrative evidence that the child really existed. Boisselier said that Eve would travel to the United States that day for DNA tests. She said that a pediatrician saw Eve and her mother in good condition, but she refused to mention the location of the surrogate birth, the testing lab, or the biological mother&#x27;s home, which she wanted to reveal at a later time. The mother was said to be 31 years old with an infertile husband.

Siegel subpoenaed Thomas Kaenzig, a vice president of Clonaid, to appear on a civil proceeding set to occur on January 22, 2003. Siegel&#x27;s office sent summonses to Thomas Kaenzig and &quot;Jane Doe&quot;, the purported mother of Eve. Siegel hoped that the action would coax those involved to provide some answers. He believed the child, if she existed, needed an appointed guardian and would need extensive medical treatment which he doubted Clonaid could offer. He wanted the court to make a decision on how to best protect her. However, Clonaid prevented scientists from meeting the purported child and mother.

===Request for a DNA verification test===
Michael Guillen, a former &quot;ABC News&quot; science editor, made an agreement with Boisselier for him to choose independent experts to test for a DNA match. Clonaid refused to identify the independent experts, because if revealed too soon, others could track the baby from the testing place into the mother&#x27;s house. Clonaid said the parents had the final say on whether they want to test the baby and that a Dutch lesbian couple would be the parents of the next cloned baby. Boisselier said she would hand over the evidence to show that a clone had been born but was concerned that the details of Clonaid&#x27;s cloning procedure might leak out. The next day, Vorilhon claimed that the baby was healthy. He said those who are against cloning for ethical reasons would be dismayed if the clone baby was in good condition.

Thomas Kaenzig refused to testify in a court hearing, but Florida judge John Frusciante Sr., father of musician John Frusciante, was able to convince Kaenzig through a telephone call to reveal some of the details. Kaenzig testified that Clonaid left him ignorant of the cloning project and that it was not even a corporation. The judge summoned Kaenzig and Brigitte Boisselier to a Florida court and warned the two that they would be condemned if they did not show there on January 29, 2003. As the court case played out, Boisselier testified under oath that she saw videos of a cloned child born in Israel.

Michael Guillen was disappointed when he discovered that Clonaid withdrew their offer to provide the tests. The company said that before the tests were done, the parents wanted to be sure that their baby would not be sent away, but Florida attorney Bernard Siegel asked that a guardian for Eve be appointed and threatened the company with a lawsuit. Guillen, who remained skeptical, said it would be unwise to dismiss the Clonaid project without proper confirmation.

==Claims of further human clones==
The day after Boisselier made her announcement, she added that four more human clones were to be born within a few weeks, Boisselier claimed that Clonaid had a list of couples who were ready to have a cloned child. and that 20 more implantations of human clones were on the way after the first 10 which happened in the previous year. She said that other companies have used cloning procedures with different specifics that lead to their high failure rate. Boisselier argued that failed attempts at human cloning would be like those of &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilization where early miscarriages occurred more frequently than abortions. Nevertheless, she said that if &quot;deformities or abnormalities&quot; were detected in a cloned fetus, the fetus would be aborted.

Raëlian spokesman Bart Overvliet claimed that another cloned baby was born to a Dutch lesbian couple in the Netherlands the previous day and that the mother and baby were in good health. A Dutch Raëlian spokeswoman could not comment on any further details about the mother, but Boisselier said that the mother gave birth to her own clone. An official from the Dutch Health Ministry told &quot;Reuters&quot; that the Netherlands forbade human cloning but not the birth of baby clones. On January 5, 2003, Brigitte Boisselier said to the BBC that her medical team produced hundreds of human clone embryos before proceeding to ten implantations, two of which led to births. The head of the UK Roslin Institute was critical of the assertion, &quot;Clonaid [has] no track record but claim[s] to have cloned hundreds of embryos – it just doesn&#x27;t ring true.&quot;

A Raëlian spokeswoman from Japan claimed that a baby boy, cloned from a comatose two-year-old of a Japanese couple, was born the previous day. Boisselier said that a surrogate participated since the biological mother was 41 and more likely to have a miscarriage. Scientists knew that many cloned animals suffer arthritis and ailments with the lungs and liver, and they were concerned that too many unanswered questions surround the prospect of cloning of humans safely. Clonaid set up press conferences in which they described their method of cloning, but they did not give any details. However, they did say that the third cloning was different in that it did not involve a mother&#x27;s egg, but the surrogate&#x27;s egg with the injection of the boy&#x27;s DNA.

According to Boisselier, Mark and Tracy Hunt, who were seeking to clone their dead son, invested $500,000 in the former Clonaid lab in West Virginia and its equipment, which the Food and Drug Administration shut down. The Clonaid CEO proposed a cloning lab on Brazilian Island for creating the next generation of clone babies. Clonaid claimed that five baby clones were born between December 26, 2002, and February 4, 2003, which had developed normally.

In late July 2002, Clonaid&#x27;s branch in South Korea, BioFusion Tech, said a woman became pregnant with a human clone. However, in the week of September 27, 2002, South Korea&#x27;s Ministry of Health and Welfare announced that it would ban human cloning and sentence violators to a 10-year prison term.

In February 2004, Clonaid claimed that a sixth clone baby was born in Australia. Additionally, it claimed to have produced human embryos in South Korea. The small number of companies that have access to cloning technology has resulted skepticism by cloning experts in Korea, who accused Clonaid of defaming the now debunked stem cell work of Doctor Hwang Woo-suk. By March 2004, Clonaid claimed that eight extra baby clones had been brought to term for a total of thirteen baby clones.

In September 2018, rapper Kid Buu claimed he was a human clone produced by Clonaid. However, this is commonly perceived as a publicity stunt.

==Embryonic cell fusion machine==

Besides offering cloning services, Clonaid has developed one product, an &quot;embryonic cell fusion device&quot; called the &quot;RMX 2010&quot;.

&quot;CNN Money&quot; has listed the RMX 2010 as the fourth &quot;Dumbest Moment in Business 2003&quot;, stating &quot;Clonaid sells the RMX 2010, a $9,220 contraption that ... well, nobody&#x27;s quite sure what it does. To help clarify the matter, Clonaid lends one to a British science museum—under strict orders not to open it to find out what&#x27;s inside.&quot;

==Additional skepticism==
Scientists interviewed about the announcement expressed skepticism regarding both the authenticity and the ethics of Clonaid&#x27;s procedures. These included Lord Robert Winston, head of the IVF research team at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Hospital, and Tanja Dominko of the Oregon Regional Primate Center&#x27;s monkey cloning project. Scientists with experience in animal cloning have encountered low rates of success per implantation, where cloned fetuses are often malformed and dead before birth. Regardless, people continue to be surprised that Clonaid appears to have overcome those problems; either Clonaid has been extremely lucky in discovering a superior method of cloning, or the company is making false claims.

Clonaid charges up to $200,000 for its &quot;cloning&quot; services. Clonaid has not shown verifiable evidence of any human cloning, despite claims that they would do this within days of their initial announcement. They claim that the parents of the first cloned child had second thoughts about submitting their child to scientific tests after attorney Bernard Siegel filed suit.

<text>Infibulation is the ritual removal of the vulva and its suturing, a practice found mainly in northeastern Africa, particularly in Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and Sudan. The World Health Organization refers to the procedure as Type III female genital mutilation. 

The term can also refer to the entirely different practice of placing a clasp through the foreskin in men; for more information see the article Fibula (penile).

==Female==
The World Health Organization refers to female infibulation as Type III female genital mutilation. Often called &quot;pharaonic circumcision&quot; (or &quot;farooni&quot;) in countries where it is practiced. It refers to the removal of the inner and outer labia and the suturing of the vulva. It is usually accompanied by the removal of the clitoral glans. The practice is concentrated in Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan. During a 2014 survey in Sudan, over 80 percent of those who had experienced any form of FGM had been sewn closed.

The procedure leaves a wall of skin and flesh across the vagina and the rest of the pubic area. By inserting a twig or similar object before the wound heals, a small hole is created for the passage of urine and menstrual blood. The legs are bound together for two to four weeks to allow healing.

The vagina is usually penetrated at the time of a woman&#x27;s marriage by her husband&#x27;s penis, or by cutting the tissue with a knife. The vagina is opened further for childbirth and usually closed again afterwards, a process known as defibulation (or deinfibulation) and reinfibulation. Infibulation can cause chronic pain and infection, organ damage, prolonged micturition, urinary incontinence, inability to get pregnant, difficulty giving birth, obstetric fistula, and fatal bleeding.

==Male==
Infibulation also referred to placing a clasp through the male foreskin. In ancient Greece, male athletes, singers and other public performers used a clasp or string to close the foreskin and draw the penis over to one side, a practice known as &quot;kynodesmē&quot; (literally &quot;dog tie&quot;). Many &quot;kynodesmē&quot; are depicted on vases, almost exclusively confined to symposiasts and komasts, who are as a general rule older (or at least mature) men. In Rome, a fibula was often a type of ring used similarly to a kynodesme.

&quot;Kynodesmē&quot; was seen as a sign of restraint and abstinence, but was also related to concerns of modesty; in artistic representations, it was regarded as obscene and offensive to show a long penis and the glans penis in particular. Tying up the penis with a string was a way of avoiding what was seen as the shameful and dishonorable spectacle of an exposed glans penis, something associated with those without repute, such as slaves and barbarians. It therefore conveyed the moral worth and modesty of the subject.

<text>Sidney Clopton Lanier (February 3, 1842 – September 7, 1881) was an American musician, poet and author. He served in the Confederate States Army as a private, worked on a blockade-running ship for which he was imprisoned (resulting in his catching tuberculosis), taught, worked at a hotel where he gave musical performances, was a church organist, and worked as a lawyer. As a poet he sometimes used dialects. Many of his poems are written in heightened, but often archaic, American English. He became a flautist and sold poems to publications. He eventually became a professor of literature at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and is known for his adaptation of musical meter to poetry. Many schools, other structures and two lakes are named for him, and he became hailed in the South as the &quot;poet of the Confederacy&quot;. A 1972 US postage stamp honored him as an &quot;American poet&quot;.

==Biography==
Sidney Clopton Lanier was born February 3, 1842, in Macon, Georgia, to parents Robert Sampson Lanier and Mary Jane Anderson. On his father&#x27;s side he was descended of French Huguenots. His middle name, &quot;Clopton&quot;, was in honor of David Clopton, a former classmate of his father&#x27;s. He began playing the flute at an early age, and his love of that musical instrument continued throughout his life. He attended Oglethorpe University, which at the time was near Milledgeville, Georgia, and he was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. He graduated first in his class shortly before the outbreak of the American Civil War. He returned to Oglethorpe the next year, as a tutor, and befriended Milton Harlow Northrup, a New York native, who was a conductor at the school.

During the war, he served in the Confederate signal corps, primarily in the tidewater region of Virginia. Later, he and his brother Clifford served as pilots aboard English blockade runners, and Lanier&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Lucy&quot;, was captured by the USS &quot;Santiago de Cuba&quot;, on November 3, 1864. He was incarcerated in a military prison at Point Lookout in Maryland, where he contracted tuberculosis (generally known as &quot;consumption&quot; at the time). He suffered greatly from this disease, then incurable and usually fatal, for the rest of his life.
Shortly after the war, he taught school briefly, then moved to Montgomery, Alabama, where he worked as a night clerk at the Exchange Hotel (a hotel partly owned by his grandfather; his brother Clifford also worked there and became a part owner after the war), and also performed as a musician. He was the regular organist at the First Presbyterian Church in nearby Prattville. He wrote his only novel, &quot;Tiger Lilies&quot; (1867), while in Alabama.

This novel was partly autobiographical, describing a stay in 1860 at his grandfather&#x27;s Montvale Springs resort hotel near Knoxville, Tennessee. In 1867, he moved to Prattville, at that time a small town just north of Montgomery, where he taught at a small school. He married Mary Day of Macon in 1867 and moved back to his hometown, where he began working in his father&#x27;s law office.

After passing the Georgia bar, Lanier practiced as a lawyer for several years. During this period he wrote a number of lesser poems, using the &quot;cracker&quot; and &quot;negro&quot; dialects of his day, about poor white and black farmers in the Reconstruction South. He traveled extensively through southern and eastern portions of the United States in search of a cure for his tuberculosis.

While on one such journey in Texas, he rediscovered his native and untutored talent for the flute and decided to travel to the northeast in hopes of finding employment as a musician in an orchestra. Unable to find work in New York City, Philadelphia, or Boston, he signed on to play flute for the Peabody Orchestra in Baltimore, Maryland, shortly after its organization. He taught himself musical notation and quickly rose to the position of first flautist. He was famous in his day for his performances of a personal composition for the flute called &quot;Black Birds&quot;, which mimics the song of that species.

In an effort to support Mary and their three sons, he also wrote poetry for magazines. His most famous poems were &quot;Corn&quot; (1875), &quot;The Symphony&quot; (1875), &quot;Centennial Meditation&quot; (1876), &quot;The Song of the Chattahoochee&quot; (1877), &quot;The Marshes of Glynn&quot;, (1878) &quot;A Sunrise Song&quot; (1881), and &quot;Evening Song&quot; (1884). These poems are generally considered his greatest works, and have been set to music by many composers, including Charles Tomlinson Griffes and Grace W. Root. &quot;The Marshes of Glynn&quot; and &quot;A Sunrise Song&quot; are part of an unfinished set of lyrical nature poems known as the &quot;Hymns of the Marshes&quot;, which describe the vast, open salt marshes of Glynn County on the coast of Georgia. (The longest bridge in Georgia is in Glynn County and is named for Lanier.)

===Later life===
Later in his short 39-year life, he became a student, lecturer, and, finally, a faculty member at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, specializing in the works of the English novelists, Shakespeare, the Elizabethan sonneteers, Chaucer, and the Old English poets. He published a series of lectures entitled &quot;The English Novel&quot; (published posthumously in 1883) and a book entitled &quot;The Science of English Verse&quot; (1880), in which he developed a novel theory exploring the connections between musical notation and meter in poetry.

Lanier finally succumbed to complications caused by his tuberculosis on September 7, 1881, while convalescing with his family near Lynn, North Carolina. He was 39. He is buried in Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore.

==Writing style and literary theory==
With his theory connecting musical notation with poetic meter, and also being described as a deft metrical technical, in his own words &#x27;daring with his poem &#x27;Special Pleading&#x27; to give myself such freedom as I desired, in my own style&#x27; and also by developing a unique style of poetry written in logaoedic dactyls, which was strongly influenced by the works of his beloved Anglo-Saxon poets. He wrote several of his greatest poems in this meter, including &quot;Revenge of Hamish&quot; (1878), &quot;The Marshes of Glynn&quot; and &quot;Sunrise&quot;. In Lanier&#x27;s hands, the logaoedic dactylic meter led to a free-form, almost prose-like style of poetry that was greatly admired by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Bayard Taylor, Charlotte Cushman, and other leading poets and critics of the day. The &quot;sprung verse&quot; metric developed by Gerard Manley Hopkins at about the same time superficially resembles Lanier&#x27;s practice but shows no influence (and there is no evidence that they knew each other or that either of them had read any of the other&#x27;s works).

Lanier also published essays on other literary and musical topics. He edited a notable series of four abridgements, published by Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons, of literary works about knightly combat and chivalry in modernized language more appealing to the boys of his day:
*&quot;The Boy&#x27;s Froissart&quot; (1879), a retelling of Jean Froissart&#x27;s &quot;Froissart&#x27;s Chronicles&quot;, which tell of adventure, battle and custom in medieval &quot;England, France, Spain, etc.&quot;
*&quot;The Boy&#x27;s King Arthur&quot; (1880), based on Sir Thomas Malory&#x27;s compilation of the legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.
*&quot;The Boy&#x27;s Mabinogion&quot; (1881), based on the early Welsh legends of King Arthur, as retold in the &quot;Red Book of Hergest&quot;.
*&quot;The Boy&#x27;s Percy&quot; (published posthumously in 1882), consisting of old ballads of war, adventure and love based on Bishop Thomas Percy&#x27;s &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&quot;.

He also wrote two travelogues that were widely read at the time, entitled &quot;Florida: Its Scenery, Climate and History&quot; (1875) and &quot;Sketches of India&quot; (1876) (although he never visited India).

==Legacy and honors==
The Sidney Lanier Cottage in Macon, Georgia, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The square stone Four Southern Poets Monument, located between 7th and 8th Streets in Augusta, lists Lanier as one of Georgia&#x27;s four great poets, all of whom were in the Confederate military. The southeastern side bears this inscription: &quot;To Sidney Lanier 1842–1880. The Catholic man who hath mightily won God out of knowledge and good out of infinite pain and sight out of blindness and purity out of a stain.&quot; The other poets on the monument are James Ryder Randall, Fr. Abram Ryan, and Paul Hayne.

Baltimore honored Lanier with a large and elaborate bronze and granite sculptural monument, created by Hans K. Schuler and located on the campus of the Johns Hopkins University. In addition to the monument at Johns Hopkins, Lanier was also later memorialized on the campus of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. Upon the construction of the iconic Duke Chapel between 1930 and 1935 on the university&#x27;s West Campus, a statue of Lanier was included alongside two fellow prominent Southerners, Thomas Jefferson and Robert E. Lee. This statue, which appears to show a Lanier older than the 39 years he actually lived, is situated on the right side of the portico leading into the chapel narthex. It is prominently featured on the cover of the 2010 autobiographical memoir &quot;Hannah&#x27;s Child&quot;, by Stanley Hauerwas, a Methodist theologian teaching at Duke Divinity School.

The United Daughters of the Confederacy worked successfully to enhance Lanier&#x27;s legacy.

Lanier&#x27;s poem &quot;The Marshes of Glynn&quot; is the inspiration for a cantata by the same name that was created by the modern English composer Andrew Downes to celebrate the Royal Opening of the Adrian Boult Hall in Birmingham, England, in 1986.

Piers Anthony used Lanier, his life, and his poetry in his science-fiction novel &quot;Macroscope&quot; (1969). He quotes from &quot;The Marshes of Glynn&quot; and other references appear throughout the novel.

In 1980, Yugoslav rock band Lutajuća Srca recorded the song &quot;Večernja pesma&quot;, featuring lyrics from Lanier&#x27;s &quot;An Evening Poem&quot; in Serbo-Croatian, the song becoming a minor hit for the band.

<text>Paul-Émile (Paul Emil) Janson (30 May 1872 – 3 March 1944) was a francophone Belgian liberal politician and the prime minister from 1937 to 1938. During the German occupation, he was arrested as a political prisoner and died in a German concentration camp in 1944.

==Biography==
Born in Brussels, Janson was the son of liberal statesman Paul Janson (died 1913). He studied law at the Free University of Brussels (now split into the Université Libre de Bruxelles and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel), practised as a lawyer, and also taught at the university.

===Political career===
Janson was elected as a liberal to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives in 1910. He was not re-elected in 1912, but he was again elected in 1914. He held various minister posts including War (1920), Justice (1927–1931; 1932–1934; 1939, 1940) and minister without portfolio (1940–1944). He was made an honorary Minister of State in 1931.

He served as the 30th Prime Minister of Belgium in 1937–1938. In the early part of the Second World War, Janson served as Foreign minister, and as minister without portfolio, in the government of Hubert Pierlot. He remained in France when the government in exile moved to London. In 1943 he was detained by the occupying German forces and incarcerated in the Buchenwald concentration camp. He died there in 1944.

His sister Marie Janson was the first woman to be elected to the Chamber of Representatives in 1921 and the mother of Paul-Henri Spaak, Janson&#x27;s nephew and the man who directly succeeded him as Prime Minister in 1938.

<text>Thorstein Bunde Veblen (; July 30, 1857 – August 3, 1929) was an American economist and sociologist who, during his lifetime, emerged as a well-known critic of capitalism.

In his best-known book, &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; (1899), Veblen coined the concepts of &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot; and &quot;conspicuous leisure&quot;. Veblen laid the foundation for the perspective of institutional economics. Contemporary economists still theorize Veblen&#x27;s distinction between &quot;institutions&quot; and &quot;technology&quot;, known as the Veblenian dichotomy.

As a leading intellectual of the Progressive Era in the US, Veblen attacked production for profit. His emphasis on conspicuous consumption greatly influenced economists who engaged in non-Marxist critiques of fascism, capitalism, and technological determinism.

==Biography==
===Early life and family background===

Veblen was born on July 30, 1857, in Cato, Wisconsin, to Norwegian-American immigrant parents, Thomas Veblen and Kari Bunde. He was the sixth of twelve children.

His parents had emigrated from Valdres, Norway to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on September 16, 1847, with few funds and no knowledge of English. They migrated to Milwaukee via Drammen, Hamburg and Quebec. The trip took four and a half months. Despite their limited circumstances as immigrants, Thomas Veblen&#x27;s knowledge in carpentry and construction, paired with his wife&#x27;s supportive perseverance, allowed them to establish a family farm in Rice County, Minnesota, where they moved in 1864. (The Veblen farmstead, located near the town of Nerstrand, became a National Historic Landmark in 1981.) Kari Bunde was not formally trained as a physician, but she frequently provided medical treatment to surrounding areas.

Veblen began his schooling at age five. Although Norwegian was his first language, he learned English from neighbors and at school. His parents also learned to speak English fluently, though they continued to read predominantly Norwegian literature with and around their family on the farmstead. The family farm eventually grew more prosperous, allowing Veblen&#x27;s parents to provide their children with formal education. Unlike most immigrant children of the time, Veblen and all of his siblings received training in lower schools and went on to receive higher education at nearby Carleton College. Veblen&#x27;s sister, Emily, was reputedly the first daughter of Norwegian immigrants to graduate from an American college. The eldest Veblen child, Andrew Veblen, ultimately became a professor of physics at Iowa State University and the father of one of America&#x27;s leading mathematicians, Oswald Veblen of Princeton University.

Several commentators saw Veblen&#x27;s ethnic-Norwegian background and his relative &quot;isolation from American society&quot; in Minnesota as essential to the understanding of his writings. Harvard University sociologist David Riesman maintained that Veblen&#x27;s background as a child of immigrants meant that Veblen was alienated from his parents&#x27; original culture, but that his &quot;living in a Norwegian society within America&quot; made him unable to &quot;assimilate and accept the available forms of Americanism&quot; completely. According to Stanford University historian George M. Fredrickson (1959), the &quot;Norwegian society&quot; that Veblen lived in (Minnesota) was so &quot;isolated&quot; that when he left it &quot;he was, in a sense, emigrating to America.&quot;

===Education===
At age 17, in 1874, Veblen was sent to attend nearby Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota. Early in his schooling he demonstrated both the bitterness and the sense of humor that would characterize his later works. Veblen studied economics and philosophy under the guidance of the young John Bates Clark (1847–1938), who went on to become a leader in the new field of neoclassical economics. Clark influenced Veblen greatly, and as Clark initiated him into the formal study of economics, Veblen came to recognize the nature and limitations of hypothetical economics that would begin to shape his theories. Veblen later developed an interest in the social sciences, taking courses within the fields of philosophy, natural history, and classical philology. Within the realm of philosophy, the works of Herbert Spencer (1820–1903) were of greatest interest to him, inspiring several preconceptions of socio-economics. In contrast, his studies in natural history and classical philology shaped his formal use of the disciplines of science and language respectively.

After Veblen graduated from Carleton in 1880, he traveled east to study philosophy at Johns Hopkins University. While at Johns Hopkins he studied under Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914). When he failed to obtain a scholarship there he moved on to Yale University, where he found economic support for his studies, obtaining a Doctor of Philosophy in 1884, with a major in philosophy and a minor in social studies. His dissertation was titled &quot;Ethical Grounds of a Doctrine of Retribution.&quot; At Yale, he studied under renowned academics such as philosopher Noah Porter (1811–1892) and sociologist William Graham Sumner (1840–1910).

===Marriages===
The two primary relationships that Veblen had were with his two wives. Despite a reputation to the contrary, there is little evidence that he had sexual liaisons with other women.

During his time at Carleton College, Veblen met his first wife, Ellen Rolfe, the niece of the college president. They married in 1888. While some scholars have blamed alleged womanizing tendencies for the couple&#x27;s numerous separations and eventual divorce in 1911, others have speculated that the relationship&#x27;s demise was rooted in Ellen&#x27;s inability to bear children. Following her death in 1926, it was revealed that she had asked for her autopsy to be sent to Veblen, her ex-husband. The autopsy showed that Ellen&#x27;s reproductive organs had not developed normally, and she had been unable to bear children. A book written by Veblen&#x27;s stepdaughter asserted that &quot;this explained her disinterest in a normal wifely relationship with Thorstein&quot; and that he &quot;treated her more like a sister, a loving sister, than a wife&quot;.

Veblen married Ann Bradley Bevans, a former student, in 1914 and became stepfather to her two daughters, Becky and Ann. For the most part, it appears that they had a happy marriage. Ann was described by her daughter as a suffragette, a socialist, and a staunch advocate of unions and workers&#x27; rights. A year after he married Ann, they were expecting a child together, but the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. Veblen never had any children of his own.

===Later life===
After his wife Ann&#x27;s premature death in 1920, Veblen became active in the care of his stepdaughters. Becky went with him when he moved to California, looked after him there, and was with him at his death in August 1929. Prior to his death, Veblen had earned a comparatively high salary from the New School. Since he lived frugally, Veblen invested his money in California raisin vineyards and the stock market. However, after returning to northern California, Veblen lost the money he had invested and lived in a house on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park (that once belonged to his first wife). Earning $500 to $600 a year from royalties and a yearly sum of $500 sent by a former Chicago student, he lived there until his death in 1929.

==Academic career==
After graduation from Yale in 1884, Veblen was essentially unemployed for seven years. Despite having strong letters of recommendation, he was unable to obtain a university position. It is possible that his dissertation research on &quot;Ethical Grounds of a Doctrine of Retribution&quot; (1884) was considered undesirable. However, this possibility can no longer be meaningfully evaluated because Veblen&#x27;s dissertation has been missing from Yale since 1935. Apparently the only scholar who ever studied the dissertation was Joseph Dorfman, for his 1934 book &quot;Thorstein Veblen and His America&quot;. Dorfman says only that the dissertation, advised by evolutionary sociologist William Graham Sumner, studies such evolutionary thought as that of Herbert Spencer, as well as the moral philosophy of Immanuel Kant. Also in 1884, Veblen wrote the first English-language study of Kant&#x27;s third Critique, his ‘Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Judgment&quot;’ published in the July 1884 issue of the Journal of Speculative Philosophy. Some historians have also speculated that this failure to obtain employment was partially due to prejudice against Norwegians, while others attribute this to the fact that most universities and administrators considered him insufficiently educated in Christianity. Most academics at the time held divinity degrees, which Veblen did not have. Also, it did not help that Veblen openly identified as an agnostic, which was highly uncommon for the time. As a result, Veblen returned to his family farm, a stay during which he had claimed to be recovering from malaria. He spent those years recovering and reading voraciously. It is suspected that these difficulties in beginning his academic career later inspired portions of his book &quot;The Higher Learning in America&quot; (1918), in which he claimed that true academic values were sacrificed by universities in favor of their own self-interest and profitability.

In 1891, Veblen left the farm to return to graduate school to study economics at Cornell University under the guidance of economics professor James Laurence Laughlin. With the help of Professor Laughlin, who was moving to the University of Chicago, Veblen became a fellow at that university in 1892. Throughout his stay, he did much of the editorial work associated with the &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot;, one of the many academic journals created during this time at the University of Chicago. Veblen used the journal as an outlet for his writings. His writings also began to appear in other journals, such as the &quot;American Journal of Sociology&quot;, another journal at the university. While he was mostly a marginal figure at the University of Chicago, Veblen taught several classes there.

In 1899, Veblen published his first and best-known book, titled &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot;. This did not immediately improve Veblen&#x27;s position at the University of Chicago. He requested a raise after the completion of his first book, but this was denied.

Veblen&#x27;s students at Chicago considered his teaching &quot;dreadful&quot;. Stanford students considered his teaching style &quot;boring&quot;, but this was more excused than some of Veblen&#x27;s personal affairs. He offended Victorian sentiments with extramarital affairs while at the University of Chicago. At Stanford in 1909, Veblen was ridiculed again for being a womanizer and an unfaithful husband. As a result, he was forced to resign from his position, which made it very difficult for him to find another academic position. One story claims that he was fired from Stanford after Jane Stanford sent him a telegram from Paris, having disapproved of Veblen&#x27;s support of Chinese workers in California. (The fact that Jane Stanford was already dead by 1905, while Veblen appointed in 1906, casts doubt on this story.)

With the help of Herbert J. Davenport, a friend who was the head of the economics department at the University of Missouri, Veblen accepted a position there in 1911. Veblen, however, did not enjoy his stay at Missouri. This was in part due to his position as a lecturer being of lower rank than his previous positions and for lower pay. Veblen also strongly disliked Columbia, Missouri, the town where the university was located. Although he may not have enjoyed his stay at Missouri, in 1914 he did publish another of his best-known books, &quot;The Instincts of Worksmanship and the State of the Industrial Arts&quot; (1914). After World War I began, Veblen published &quot;Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution&quot; (1915). He considered warfare a threat to economic productivity and contrasted the authoritarian politics of Germany with the democratic tradition of Britain, noting that industrialization in Germany had not produced a progressive political culture.

By 1917, Veblen moved to Washington, D.C. to work with a group that had been commissioned by President Woodrow Wilson to analyze possible peace settlements for World War I, culminating in his book &quot;An Inquiry into the Nature of Peace and the Terms of Its Perpetuation&quot; (1917). This marked a series of distinct changes in his career path. Following that, Veblen worked for the United States Food Administration for a period of time. Shortly thereafter, Veblen moved to New York City to work as an editor for a magazine, &quot;The Dial&quot;. Within the next year, the magazine shifted its orientation and he lost his editorial position.

In the meantime, Veblen had made contacts with several other academics, such as Charles A. Beard, James Harvey Robinson, and John Dewey. The group of university professors and intellectuals eventually founded The New School for Social Research. Known today as The New School, in 1919 it emerged from American modernism, progressivism, and the democratic education movement. The group was open to students and aimed for a &quot;an unbiased understanding of the existing order, its genesis, growth, and present working&quot;. From 1919 to 1926, Veblen continued to write and maintain a role in The New School&#x27;s development. During this time, he wrote &quot;The Engineers and the Price System&quot;. In it, Veblen proposed a soviet of engineers. According to Yngve Ramstad, the view that engineers, not workers, would overthrow capitalism was a &quot;novel view&quot;. Veblen invited Guido Marx to the New School to teach and to help organize a movement of engineers with others such as Morris Cooke; Henry Gantt, who had died shortly before; and Howard Scott. Cooke and Gantt were followers of Frederick Winslow Taylor&#x27;s scientific management theory. Scott, who listed Veblen as being on the temporary organizing committee of the Technical Alliance, perhaps without consulting Veblen or other listed members, later helped found the technocracy movement.

==Influences on Veblen==
American pragmatism distrusted the notion of the absolute, and instead recognized the notion of free will. Rather than God&#x27;s divine intervention taking control of the happenings of the universe, pragmatism believed that people, using their free will, shape the institutions of society. Veblen also recognized this as an element of causes and effects, upon which he based many of his theories. This pragmatist belief was pertinent to the shaping of Veblen&#x27;s critique of natural law and the establishment of his evolutionary economics, which recognized the purpose of man throughout. The skepticism of the German Historical School regarding laissez-faire economics was also adopted by Veblen.

From 1896 to 1926, he spent summers at his study cabin on Washington Island in Wisconsin. On the island he learned Icelandic, which allowed him to write articles accepted by an Icelandic newspaper and translate the &quot;Laxdæla saga&quot; into English.

==Contributions to social theory==
===Institutional economics===
Thorstein Veblen laid the foundation for the perspective of institutional economics with his criticism of traditional static economic theory. As much as Veblen was an economist, he was also a sociologist who rejected his contemporaries who looked at the economy as an autonomous, stable, and static entity. Veblen disagreed with his peers, as he strongly believed that the economy was significantly embedded in social institutions. Rather than separating economics from the social sciences, Veblen viewed the relationships between the economy and social and cultural phenomena. Generally speaking, the study of institutional economics viewed economic institutions as the broader process of cultural development. While economic institutionalism never transformed into a major school of economic thought, it allowed economists to explore economic problems from a perspective that incorporated social and cultural phenomena. It also allowed economists to view the economy as an evolving entity of bounded rationale.

===Pecuniary emulation===
Pecuniary emulation refers to the tendency of individuals to compete through the display of wealth and status symbols, rather than through productive or useful activities. Colloquially known as Keeping Up with the Joneses, this can take the form of luxury goods and services or the adoption of a luxury lifestyle. In &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot;, Veblen argues how emulation is at the basis of ownership. He says that individuals wish to emulate others, especially if they are of a higher social or pecuniary standing, so they initially begin acquiring the luxury goods that others have acquired. Eventually, the act of conspicuous consumption becomes the symbol of status, rather than the individual. This pecuniary emulation drives consumers to spend more on displays of wealth and status symbols, as opposed to more useful commodities. This cycle of constant emulation promotes materialism, demotes other forms of fulfillment, and negatively impacts the consumer&#x27;s decision-making process within the market.

===Conspicuous consumption===

In his most famous work, &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot;, Veblen writes critically of the leisure class for its role in fostering wasteful consumption, or conspicuous waste. In this first work Veblen coined the term &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot;, which he defined as spending more money on goods than they are worth.

The term originated during the Second Industrial Revolution when a &quot;nouveau riche&quot; social class emerged as a result of the accumulation of capital wealth. He explains that members of the leisure class, often associated with business, are those who also engage in conspicuous consumption to impress the rest of society through the manifestation of their social power and prestige, be it real or perceived. In other words, social status, Veblen explained, becomes earned and displayed by patterns of consumption rather than what the individual makes financially. Subsequently, people in other social classes are influenced by this behavior and, as Veblen argued, strive to emulate the leisure class. What results from this behavior, is a society characterized by the waste of time and money. Unlike other sociological works of the time, &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; focused on consumption, rather than production.

===Fabricating consumers===
In his documentary film &quot;Requiem for the American Dream&quot;, Noam Chomsky quoted Veblen&#x27;s coinage of the phrase &quot;Fabricating consumers&quot;, and its role in controlling the attitudes of people:

===Conspicuous leisure===

&quot;Conspicuous leisure&quot;, or the non-productive use of time for the sake of displaying social status, is used by Veblen as the primary indicator of the leisure class. To engage in conspicuous leisure is to openly display one&#x27;s wealth and status, as productive work signified the absence of pecuniary strength and was seen as a mark of weakness. As the leisure class increased their exemption from productive work, that very exemption became honorific and actual participation in productive work became a sign of inferiority. Conspicuous leisure worked very well to designate social status in rural areas, but urbanization made it so that conspicuous leisure was no longer a sufficient means to display pecuniary strength. Urban life requires more obvious displays of status, wealth, and power, which is where conspicuous consumption becomes prominent.

===Leisure class===
In &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot;, Veblen writes critically of conspicuous consumption and its function in social-class consumerism and social stratification. Reflecting historically, he traces said economic behaviors back to the beginnings of the division of labor, or during tribal times. Upon the start of a division of labor, high-status individuals within the community practiced hunting and war, notably less labor-intensive and less economically productive work. Low-status individuals, on the other hand, practiced activities recognized as more economically productive and more labor-intensive, such as farming and cooking. High-status individuals, as Veblen explains, could instead afford to live their lives leisurely (hence their title as the leisure class), engaging in symbolic economic participation, rather than practical economic participation. These individuals could engage in conspicuous leisure for extended periods of time, simply following pursuits that evoked a higher social status. Rather than participating in conspicuous consumption, the leisure class lived lives of conspicuous leisure as a marker of high status. The leisure class protected and reproduced their social status and control within the tribe through, for example, their participation in war-time activities, which while they were rarely needed, still rendered their lower social class counterparts dependent upon them. During modern industrial times, Veblen described the leisure class as those exempt from industrial labor. Instead, he explains, the leisure class participated in intellectual or artistic endeavors to display their freedom from the economic need to participate in economically productive manual labor. In essence, not having to perform labor-intensive activities did not mark higher social status, but rather, higher social status meant that one would not have to perform such duties.

====Assessment of the rich====
Veblen expanded upon Adam Smith&#x27;s assessment of the rich, stating that &quot;[t]he leisure class used charitable activities as one of the ultimate benchmarks of the highest standard of living.&quot; Veblen insinuates that the way to convince those who have money to share is to have them receive something in return. Behavioral economics also reveals that rewards and incentives are very important aspects of every-day decision making. When the rich shift their mindset from feeling as though they are forced to give their hard-earned money to feeling pride and honor from giving to charitable organizations there is benefit for every party involved. In &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; (1899), Veblen referred to communities without a leisure class as &quot;non-predatory communities,&quot; and stated that &quot;[t]he accumulation of wealth at the upper end of the pecuniary scale implies privation at the lower end of the scale.&quot; Veblen believed that inequality was natural, and that it gave housewives something to focus their energy on. The members of the leisure class planning events and parties did not actually help anyone in the long run, according to Veblen.

===Theory of business enterprise===
The central problem for Veblen was the friction between &quot;business&quot; and &quot;industry&quot;.

Veblen identified &quot;business&quot; as the owners and leaders whose primary goal was the profits of their companies but who, in an effort to keep profits high, often made efforts to limit production. By obstructing the operation of the industrial system in that way, &quot;business&quot; negatively affected society as a whole (through higher rates of unemployment, for example). With that said, Veblen identified business leaders as the source of many problems in society, which he felt should be led by people such as engineers, who understood the industrial system and its operation, while also having an interest in the general welfare of society at large.

===Trained incapacity===
In sociology, trained incapacity is &quot;that state of affairs in which one&#x27;s abilities function as inadequacies or blind spots.&quot; It means that people&#x27;s past experiences can lead to wrong decisions when circumstances change.

Veblen coined this phrase in 1914, in &quot;The Instinct of Workmanship and the Industrial Arts&quot;. Essayist Kenneth Burke expanded upon the theory of trained incapacity later on, first in his book &quot;Permanence and Change&quot; (1935) and again in two later works.

==Veblen&#x27;s economics and politics==
Veblen and other American institutionalists were indebted to the German Historical School, especially Gustav von Schmoller, for the emphasis on historical fact, their empiricism and especially a broad, evolutionary framework of study. Veblen admired Schmoller, but criticized some other leaders of the German school because of their over-reliance on descriptions, long displays of numerical data, and narratives of industrial development that rested on no underlying economic theory. Veblen tried to use the same approach with his own theory added.

Veblen developed a 20th-century evolutionary economics based upon Darwinian principles and new ideas emerging from anthropology, sociology, and psychology. Unlike the neoclassical economics that emerged at the same time, Veblen described economic behavior as socially determined and saw economic organization as a process of ongoing evolution. Veblen rejected any theory based on individual action or any theory highlighting any factor of an inner personal motivation. He considered such theories to be &quot;unscientific&quot;. This evolution was driven by the human instincts of emulation, predation, workmanship, parental bent, and idle curiosity. Veblen wanted economists to grasp the effects of social and cultural change on economic changes. In &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot;, the instincts of emulation and predation play a major role. People, rich and poor alike, attempt to impress others and seek to gain advantage through what Veblen termed &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot; and the ability to engage in &quot;conspicuous leisure.&quot; In this work Veblen argued that consumption is used as a way to gain and signal status. Through &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot; often came &quot;conspicuous waste,&quot; which Veblen detested. He further spoke of a &quot;predatory phase&quot; of culture in the sense of the predatory attitude having become the habitual spiritual attitude of the individual.

===Political theories===
Politically, Veblen was sympathetic to state ownership. Scholars disagree about the extent to which Veblen&#x27;s views are compatible with Marxism, socialism, or anarchism.

===Veblenian dichotomy===
The Veblenian dichotomy is a concept that Veblen first suggested in &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; (1899), and made fully into an analytical principle in &quot;The Theory of Business Enterprise&quot; (1904). To Veblen, institutions determine how technologies are used. Some institutions are more &quot;ceremonial&quot; than others. A project for Veblen&#x27;s idealized economist is to identify institutions that are too wasteful and pursue institutional &quot;adjustment&quot; to make instituted uses of technology more &quot;instrumental&quot;.

Veblen defines &quot;ceremonial&quot; as related to the past, supportive of &quot;tribal legends&quot; or traditional conserving attitudes and conduct; while the &quot;instrumental&quot; orients itself toward the technological imperative, judging value by the ability to control future consequences.

The theory suggests that, although every society depends on tools and skills to support the life process, every society also appears to have a &quot;ceremonial&quot; stratified structure of status that runs contrary to the needs of the &quot;instrumental&quot; (technological) aspects of group life. The Veblen Dichotomy is still very relevant today and can be applied to thinking around digital transformation.

===Publications on &quot;The Blond Race&quot; and &quot;Aryan Culture&quot;===
Historiographical debates continue over Veblen&#x27;s commissioned 1913 writings on &quot;the blond race&quot; and &quot;the Aryan culture&quot; in the context of cultural and social anthropology. Mendelian concepts shaped both his praise of cultural anthropology and critique of social anthropology, as well as his contrasts between Mendelian and Darwinian ideas in antediluvian racial typologies such as &quot;dolicho-blond&quot; and &quot;brachycephalic brunet.&quot; Historians argue that Veblen preferred melting pot ideas as well as his own approach to monoculturalism and cultural evolution in cultural anthropology. Many, if not most, of these historical studies, as well as scholarly appraisals of his 1915–19 articles on Japanese industrial expansion and the distinct politics of the Jews, maintain strict distinctions between Veblen&#x27;s renunciation of &quot;invidious&quot; scientific racism and Veblen&#x27;s eurocentric assumptions, if any.

==Legacy==
Veblen is regarded as one of the co-founders of the American school of institutional economics, alongside John R. Commons and Wesley Clair Mitchell. Economists who adhere to this school organize themselves in the Association for Institutional Economics (AFIT). The Association for Evolutionary Economics (AFEE) gives an annual Veblen-Commons award for work in Institutional Economics and publishes the &quot;Journal of Economic Issues&quot;. Some unaligned practitioners include theorists of the concept of &quot;differential accumulation.&quot;

Veblen&#x27;s work has remained relevant for more reasons than the phrase &quot;conspicuous consumption.&quot; His evolutionary approach to the study of economic systems is again gaining traction and his model of recurring conflict between the existing order and new ways can be of value in understanding the new global economy. In this sense some authors have recently compared the Gilded Age, studied by Veblen, with the New Gilded Age and the contemporary processes of refeudalization, arguing for a new global leisure class and distinctive luxury consumption.

Veblen has been cited in the writings of feminist economists. Veblen believed that women have no endowments and that the behavior of women instead reflects the social norms of their time and place. Veblen theorized that women in the industrial age remained victims of their &quot;barbarian status&quot;. That has, in hindsight, made Veblen a forerunner of modern feminism.

Veblen&#x27;s work has also often been cited in American literary works. He is featured in &quot;The Big Money&quot; by John Dos Passos, and mentioned in Carson McCullers&#x27; &quot;The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter&quot; and Sinclair Lewis&#x27; &quot;Main Street&quot;. One of Veblen&#x27;s PhD students was George W. Stocking Sr., a pioneer in the emerging field of industrial organization economics. Another was Canadian academic and author Stephen Leacock, who went on to become the head of Department of Economics and Political Science at McGill University in Montreal. The influence of &quot;Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; can be seen in Leacock&#x27;s 1914 satire, &quot;Arcadian Adventures with the Idle Rich&quot;.

To this day, Veblen is little known in Norway. President Bill Clinton honored Veblen as a great American thinker when he addressed King Harald V of Norway.
Veblen goods are named for him, based on his work in &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot;.

<text>Rin Tin Tin or Rin-Tin-Tin (September 10, 1918 – August 10, 1932) was a male German Shepherd born in Flirey, France, who became an international star in motion pictures. He was rescued from a World War I battlefield by an American soldier, Lee Duncan, who nicknamed him &quot;Rinty&quot;. Duncan trained Rin Tin Tin and obtained silent film work for the dog. Rin Tin Tin was an immediate box-office success and went on to appear in 27 Hollywood films, gaining worldwide fame. Along with the earlier canine film star Strongheart, Rin Tin Tin was responsible for greatly increasing the popularity of German Shepherd dogs as family pets. The immense profitability of his films contributed to the success of Warner Bros. studios and helped advance the career of Darryl F. Zanuck from screenwriter to producer and studio executive.

After the dog&#x27;s only appearance in color (the 1929 musical revue &quot;The Show of Shows&quot;, in which he barks an introduction to a musical pageant), Warner Bros. dispensed with the services of both Rin Tin Tin and Lee Duncan. The studio was intent on promoting its &quot;all-talking&quot; stars, and silent-film personality Rin Tin Tin obviously couldn&#x27;t speak. Undaunted, Duncan sought further film work and signed with independent producer Nat Levine, who starred Rin Tin Tin in serials and feature films. 

After Rin Tin Tin died in 1932, the name was given to several related German Shepherd dogs featured in fictional stories on film, radio, and television. Rin Tin Tin Jr. appeared in some serialized films, but was not as talented as his father. Rin Tin Tin III, said to be Rin Tin Tin&#x27;s grandson, but probably only distantly related, helped promote the military use of dogs during World War II. Rin Tin Tin III also appeared in a film with child actor Robert Blake in 1947.

Duncan groomed Rin Tin Tin IV for the 1950s television series &quot;The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin&quot;, produced by Bert Leonard. However, the dog performed poorly in a screen test and was replaced in the TV show by trainer Frank Barnes&#x27;s dogs, primarily one named Flame Jr., called JR, with the public led to believe otherwise. Instead of shooting episodes, Rin Tin Tin IV stayed at home in Riverside, California. The TV show &quot;Rin Tin Tin&quot; was nominated for a PATSY Award in both 1958 and 1959 but did not win.

After Duncan died in 1960, the screen property of Rin Tin Tin passed to his business partner Bert Leonard, who worked on further adaptations such as the 1988–1993 Canadian-made TV show &quot;Katts and Dog&quot;, which was called &quot;Rin Tin Tin: K-9 Cop&quot; in the US and &quot;Rintintin Junior&quot; in France. Following Leonard&#x27;s death in 2006, his lawyer James Tierney made the 2007 children&#x27;s film &quot;Finding Rin Tin Tin&quot;, an American–Bulgarian production based on Duncan&#x27;s discovery of the dog in France. Meanwhile, a Rin Tin Tin memorabilia collection was being amassed by Texas resident Jannettia Propps Brodsgaard, who had purchased several direct descendant dogs from Duncan beginning with Rinty Tin Tin Brodsgaard in 1957. Brodsgaard bred the dogs to keep the bloodline. Brodsgaard&#x27;s granddaughter, Daphne Hereford, continued to build on the tradition and bloodline of Rin Tin Tin from 1988 to 2011; she was the first to trademark the name Rin Tin Tin, in 1993, and she bought the domain names rintintin.com and rintintin.net to establish a website. Hereford opened a short-lived Rin Tin Tin museum in Latexo, Texas and passed the tradition to her daughter, Dorothy Yanchak, in 2011. The dog Rin Tin Tin XII, owned by Yanchak, takes part in public events to represent the Rin Tin Tin legacy.

==Origins==

Following advances made by American forces during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, Corporal Lee Duncan, an armourer of the U.S. Army Air Service, was sent forward on September 15, 1918, to the small French village of Flirey to see if it would make a suitable flying field for his unit, the 135th Aero Squadron. The area had been subjected to aerial bombing and artillery fire, and Duncan found a severely damaged kennel which had once supplied the Imperial German Army with German Shepherd dogs. The only dogs left alive in the kennel were a starving mother with a litter of five nursing puppies, their eyes still shut because they were less than a week old. Duncan rescued the dogs and brought them back to his unit.

When the puppies were weaned, he gave the mother to an officer and three of the litter to other soldiers, but he kept one puppy of each sex. He felt that these two dogs were symbols of his good luck. He dubbed them Rin Tin Tin and Nanette after a pair of good luck charms called Rintintin and Nénette that French children often gave to the American soldiers (the soldiers were usually told that Rintintin and Nénette were lucky lovers who had survived a bombing attack, but the original dolls had been designed by Francisque Poulbot before the war in late 1913 to look like Paris street urchins. Contrary to linguistic clues and popular usage, Poulbot said that Rintintin was the girl doll.). Duncan sensed that Nanette was the more intelligent of the two puppies.

In July 1919, Duncan sneaked the dogs aboard a ship taking him back to the US at the end of the war. When he got to Long Island, New York, for re-entry processing, he put his dogs in the care of a Hempstead breeder named Mrs. Leo Wanner, who trained police dogs. Nanette was diagnosed with pneumonia; as a replacement, the breeder gave Duncan another female German Shepherd puppy. Duncan travelled to California by rail with his dogs. While Duncan was travelling by train, Nanette died in Hempstead. As a memorial, Duncan named his new puppy Nanette II, but he called her Nanette. Duncan, Rin Tin Tin, and Nanette II settled at his home in Los Angeles. Rin Tin Tin was a dark sable color and had very dark eyes. Nanette II was much lighter in color.

An athletic silent film actor named Eugene Pallette was one of Duncan&#x27;s friends. The two men enjoyed the outdoors; they took the dogs to the Sierras, where Pallette liked to hunt, while Duncan taught Rin Tin Tin various tricks. Duncan thought that his dog might win a few awards at dog shows and thus be a valuable source of puppies bred with Nanette for sale. In 1922, Duncan was a founding member of the Shepherd Dog Club of California, based in Los Angeles. At the club&#x27;s first show, Rin Tin Tin showed his agility but also demonstrated an aggressive temper, growling, barking, and snapping. It was a very poor performance, but the worst moment came afterward when Duncan was walking home. A heavy bundle of newspapers was thrown from a delivery truck and landed on the dog, breaking his left front leg. Duncan had the injured limb set in plaster and he nursed the dog back to health for nine months.

Ten months after the fracture, the leg was healed and Rin Tin Tin was entered in a show for German Shepherd dogs in Los Angeles. Rin Tin Tin had learned to leap great heights. At the dog show while making a winning leap, he was filmed by Duncan&#x27;s acquaintance Charley Jones, who had just developed a slow-motion camera. Seeing his dog being filmed, Duncan became convinced Rin Tin Tin could become the next Strongheart, a successful German Shepherd film dog that lived in his own full-sized stucco bungalow with its own street address in the Hollywood Hills, separate from the mansion of his owners, who lived a street away next to Roy Rogers. Duncan later wrote, &quot;I was so excited over the film idea that I found myself thinking of it night and day.&quot;

==Career==

Duncan walked his dog up and down Poverty Row, talking to anyone in a position to put Rin Tin Tin in film, however modest the role. The dog&#x27;s first break came when he was asked to replace a camera-shy wolf in &quot;The Man from Hell&#x27;s River&quot; (1922) featuring Wallace Beery. The wolf was not performing properly for the director, but under the guidance of Duncan&#x27;s voice commands, Rin Tin Tin was very easy to work with. When the film was completed, the dog was billed as &quot;Rin Tan&quot;. Rin Tin Tin would be cast as a wolf or wolf-hybrid many times in his career because it was much more convenient for filmmakers to work with a trained dog. In another 1922 film titled &quot;My Dad&quot;, Rin Tin Tin picked up a small part as a household dog. The credits read: &quot;Rin Tin Tin – Played by himself&quot;.

Rin Tin Tin&#x27;s first starring role was in &quot;Where the North Begins&quot; (1923), in which he played alongside silent screen actress Claire Adams. This film was a huge success and has often been credited with saving Warner Bros. from bankruptcy. It was followed by 24 more screen appearances by Rin Tin Tin. Each of these films was very popular, making such a profit for Warner Bros. that Rin Tin Tin was called &quot;the mortgage lifter&quot; by studio insiders. A young screenwriter named Darryl F. Zanuck was involved in creating stories for Rin Tin Tin; the success of the films raised him to the position of film producer. In New York City, Mayor Jimmy Walker gave Rin Tin Tin a key to the city.

Rin Tin Tin was much sought after and was signed for endorsement deals. Dog food makers Ken-L Ration, Ken-L-Biskit, and Pup-E-Crumbles all featured him in their advertisements. Warner Bros. fielded fan letters by the thousands, sending back a glossy portrait signed with a paw print and a message written by Duncan: &quot;Most faithfully, Rin Tin Tin.&quot; In the 1920s, Rin Tin Tin&#x27;s success for Warner Bros. inspired several imitations from other studios looking to cash in on his popularity, notably RKO&#x27;s Ace the Wonder Dog, also a German Shepherd. Around the world, Rin Tin Tin was extremely popular because as a dog he was equally well understood by all viewers. At the time, silent films were easily adapted for various countries by simply changing the language of the intertitles. Rin Tin Tin&#x27;s films were widely distributed. Film historian Jan-Christopher Horak wrote that by 1927, Rin Tin Tin was the most popular actor with the very sophisticated film audience in Berlin. &quot;He is a human dog,&quot; one fan wrote, &quot;human in the real big sense of the word.&quot;

A Hollywood legend holds it that at the first Academy Awards in 1929, Rin Tin Tin was voted Best Actor, but that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, wishing to appear more serious and thus determined to have a human actor win the award, removed Rin Tin Tin as a choice and re-ran the vote, leading to German actor Emil Jannings winning the award. Author Susan Orlean stated this story as fact in her 2011 book &quot;Rin Tin Tin: The Life and the Legend&quot;. However, former Academy head Bruce Davis has described the story as an urban legend, attributing its origins to a joke ballot circulated the previous year by Zanuck, who wanted to mock the concept of the Academy Awards. Davis consulted the original 1928 ballots, which are kept in storage at the Academy&#x27;s Margaret Herrick Library, and confirmed that no one voted for Rin Tin Tin (although Jack L. Warner did, as a joke, include the dog on his nomination ballot); as well, since the ballots that year were signed rather than secret, Davis ascertained that Zanuck did not even vote for that year&#x27;s awards.

Although primarily a star of silent films, Rin Tin Tin did appear in four sound features, including the 12-part Mascot Studios chapter-play &quot;The Lightning Warrior&quot; (1931), co-starring with Frankie Darro. In these films, vocal commands would have been picked up by the microphones, so Duncan likely guided Rin Tin Tin by hand signals. Rin Tin Tin and the rest of the crew filmed much of the outdoor action footage for &quot;The Lightning Warrior&quot; on the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, Los Angeles, known for its huge sandstone boulders and widely recognized as the most heavily filmed outdoor shooting location in the history of the movies.

Rin Tin Tin and Nanette II produced at least 48 puppies; Duncan kept two of them, selling the rest or giving them as gifts. Greta Garbo, W.K. Kellogg, and Jean Harlow each owned one of Rin Tin Tin&#x27;s descendants.

==Death and accolades==


On August 10, 1932, Rin Tin Tin died at Duncan&#x27;s home on Club View Drive in Los Angeles. Duncan wrote about the death in his unpublished memoir. He heard Rin Tin Tin bark in a peculiar fashion so he went to see what was wrong. He found the dog lying on the ground, moments away from death. Newspapers across the nation carried obituaries. Magazine articles were written about his life, and a special Movietone News feature was shown to movie audiences. In the press, aspects of the death were fabricated in various ways, such as Rin Tin Tin dying on the set of the film &quot;Pride of the Legion&quot; (where Rin Tin Tin Jr. was working), dying at night, or dying at home on the front lawn in the arms of actress Jean Harlow, who lived on the same street. In a private ceremony, Duncan buried Rin Tin Tin in a bronze casket in his own backyard with a plain wooden cross to mark the location. Duncan was suffering the financial effects of the Great Depression and could not afford a finer burial, nor even his own expensive house. He sold his house and quietly arranged to have the dog&#x27;s body returned to his country of birth for reburial in the Cimetière des Chiens et Autres Animaux Domestiques, the pet cemetery in the Parisian suburb of Asnières-sur-Seine.

In the United States, his death set off a national response. Regular programming was interrupted by a news bulletin. An hour-long program about Rin Tin Tin played the next day. In a ceremony on February 8, 1960, Rin Tin Tin was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1627 Vine Street.

==Filmography 1922–1931==

==Successors==

===Rin Tin Tin Jr.===

Rin Tin Tin Jr. was sired by Rin Tin Tin, and his mother was Champion Asta of Linwood, also owned by Lee Duncan. Junior appeared in several films in the 1930s. He starred with Rex the Wild Horse in the Mascot Pictures serials &quot;The Law of the Wild&quot; (1934) and &quot;The Adventures of Rex and Rinty&quot; (1935). He voiced the part of Rinty in the radio shows produced during that era as well.

Rin Tin Tin Jr. died in December 1941 of pneumonia.

====Filmography 1932–1939====
===Rin Tin Tin III===
Rin Tin Tin III starred alongside a young Robert Blake in 1947&#x27;s &quot;The Return of Rin Tin Tin&quot; but is primarily credited with assisting Duncan in the training of more than 5,000 dogs for the World War II war effort at Camp Hahn, California.

====Filmography 1947====
==Radio==
Between 1930 and 1955, Rin Tin Tin was cast in three different radio series, beginning April 5, 1930, with &quot;The Wonder Dog&quot;, in which the original Rin Tin Tin performed some of the sound effects until his death in 1932. (Most of the dog noises were performed live on radio by a young Bob Barker.) This 15-minute program was broadcast Saturdays on the Blue Network at 8:15 pm until March 1931, when it moved to Thursdays. Storylines were often highly unlikely, with Rin Tin Tin saving a group of space-exploring scientists from giant Martians in one episode.

In September 1930, the title changed from &quot;The Wonder Dog&quot; to &quot;Rin Tin Tin&quot;. Don Ameche and Junior McLain starred in the series, which ended June 8, 1933. With Ken-L Ration as a sponsor, the series continued on CBS from October 5, 1933, until May 20, 1934, airing Sundays at 7:45 pm.

The final radio series was broadcast on Mutual from January 2, 1955, to December 25, 1955, a 30-minute program heard Sunday evenings. Sponsored by Shredded Wheat and Milk-Bone for The National Biscuit Company, the series featured Rin Tin Tin&#x27;s adventures with the 101st Cavalry in the same manner as the concurrent TV show, &quot;The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin&quot;. The radio show also starred Lee Aaker (1943–2021) as Rusty, James Brown (1920–1992) as Lieutenant Ripley &quot;Rip&quot; Masters, and Joe Sawyer (1906–1982) as Sergeant Biff O&#x27;Hara.

==Television==

&quot;The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin&quot;, an ABC television series, ran from October 1954 to May 1959. Duncan&#x27;s Rin Tin Tin IV was nominally the lead dog, but nearly all of the screen work was performed by a dog named Flame Jr., nicknamed J.R., owned by trainer Frank Barnes. Other dogs that sometimes played TV&#x27;s Rin Tin Tin included Barnes&#x27;s dog Blaze and Duncan&#x27;s dog Hey You from the Rin Tin Tin bloodline. Hey You had suffered an eye injury during his youth; he was used as a stunt dog and for fight scenes. TV&#x27;s Rin Tin Tin was far lighter in color than the original sable-colored dog of silent film.

==Legacy==
Lee Duncan died on September 20, 1960, without ever having trademarked the name &quot;Rin Tin Tin&quot;. The tradition continued in Texas with Jannettia Brodsgaard Propps, who had purchased several direct descendant dogs from Duncan. Her granddaughter, Daphne Hereford, continued the lineage and the legacy of Rin Tin Tin following her grandmother&#x27;s death on December 17, 1988. Hereford passed the tradition to her daughter, Dorothy Yanchak, in July 2011. The current Rin Tin Tin is twelfth in line from the original silent film star and makes personal appearances across the country to promote responsible pet ownership. Rin Tin Tin was the recipient of the 2011 American Humane Association Legacy award, accepted by a twelfth-generation Rin Tin Tin legacy dog in October 2011 at the first annual Hero Dog Awards in Beverly Hills. Mickey Rooney narrated a memorial tribute film about Rin Tin Tin. The next year, Rin Tin Tin was honored by the Academy of Arts and Sciences in a special program, &quot;Hollywood Dogs: From Rin Tin Tin to Uggie&quot;, on June 6, 2012, at the Samuel Goldwyn Theatre. The career of contemporary film dog Uggie (2002–2015) was compared to Rin Tin Tin&#x27;s silent-era career.

==In literature and the arts==
In 1976, a film loosely based on Rin Tin Tin&#x27;s debut was produced: &quot;Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood&quot;. Producer David V. Picker offered a fee to Herbert B. Leonard, but Leonard objected to the premise of a film ridiculing the famous dog. Leonard sued the filmmakers for infringement on the Rin Tin Tin legacy and lost.

Originally co-produced by Leonard, the 1988–93 Canadian TV series &quot;Katts and Dog&quot; featured the adventures of a police officer and his canine partner. The series was titled &quot;Rin Tin Tin: K9 Cop&quot; for its American showings; in France it was presented as &quot;Rintintin Junior&quot;. Leonard was funded by the Christian Broadcasting Network, whose founder, televangelist Pat Robertson, had been enthusiastic for the idea. Leonard was criticized by his fellow producers for staying with his new wife in Los Angeles rather than helping with the show on location in Canada. Partway through the first season, Robertson said that some of his viewers were deeply concerned that the plot involved a widowed mother who was living unmarried in the same house with the brother of her late husband. Robertson recommended the mother character be killed off to stop the complaints, but Leonard protested such a change. After Leonard quit the show, the problematic character was killed off. Though separated from the show, Leonard continued to receive a fee for the screen rights to Rin Tin Tin.

In 2007, a children&#x27;s film was produced—&quot;Finding Rin Tin Tin&quot;—based on the story of Lee Duncan finding Rin Tin Tin on a battlefield in France and making a star of him in Hollywood. The film was the subject of a lawsuit brought in October 2008 by Daphne Hereford, who asked a federal court in Houston, Texas, to protect her rights to the Rin Tin Tin trademark. The judge ruled in favor of the filmmakers, declaring the use of the name in the film to be fair use.

A fictionalized account of Lee Duncan finding and raising Rin Tin Tin is a major part of the novel &quot;Sunnyside&quot; by Glen David Gold. 

Rin Tin Tin has been featured as a character in many works of fiction, including a children&#x27;s book in which Rin Tin Tin and the other animal characters are able to talk to one another but are unable to talk to humans.

Rin Tin Tin finds mention in Anne Frank&#x27;s diary in her second entry on June 14, 1942. Frank wishes she had a dog like Rin Tin Tin. She also wrote about the 1924 Rin Tin Tin silent film &quot;The Lighthouse by the Sea&quot;, which she and her school friends watched together in her house for her birthday party. According to her, the movie was a big hit with her friends.

The Hank Williams Jr song &quot;Attitude Adjustment&quot; includes the line, &quot;Now some sticks to the head, and some kicks to the shin, and several bites by Rin Tin Tin, and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get into that jail.&quot; 

The Clash&#x27;s 1981 song &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; referenced the dog - &quot;Plato the Greek or Rin Tin Tin/ who&#x27;s more famous to the Billion Millions?&quot;.

In &quot;The Simpsons&quot;″ season 14 episode &quot;Old Yeller-Belly&quot;, Rin Tin Tin is referred to as the &quot;first openly gay dog in Hollywood.&quot;

The Finnish pop rock band Leevi and the Leavings has a song called &quot;Rin Tin Tin&quot; on their album &quot;Häntä koipien välissä&quot; (1988).

<text>Paul Guillaume, Viscount van Zeeland (11 November 1893 – 22 September 1973) was a Belgian lawyer, economist, Catholic politician and statesman.

==Biography==
van Zeeland was born in Soignies. He was a professor of law and later director of the Institute of Economic Science at the Catholic University of Leuven (Leuven), and vice-governor of the National Bank of Belgium.

In March 1935, he became the Prime Minister of a government of national unity (a coalition comprising the three major parties: Catholics, Liberals and Socialists). Given decree powers, he abated a national economic crisis by devaluing the currency and implementing expansive budgetary policies.

van Zeeland&#x27;s government resigned in the spring of 1936 due to the agitation of Rexism, a Belgian fascist movement. On 24 May 1936, general elections were held. The Labour party won 70 of 202 seats (minus 3), Zeeland&#x27;s Catholic Party 61 seats (minus 18) and the new Rexists 21 seats. Van Zeeland continued as Prime Minister leading a government of national unity, composed of the three major parties (Catholics, Socialists and Liberals).

On 2 June 1936, a wildcat strike among dockworkers in the Port of Antwerp broke out and quickly spread to other industrial regions without the endorsement of the country&#x27;s major trades unions. It was characterised by the new tactic of workplace occupations. The Belgian strike was unusual in uniting socialist and Catholic trade union federations in support. van Zeeland agreed to convene a &quot;National Labour Conference&quot; (&quot;Conférence Nationale du Travail&quot;) on 17 June 1936 to bring together trade union and company representatives. It brokered a compromise agreement including the introduction of a legal minimum wage, six days&#x27; paid holidays, and a maximum 40-hour working week for workers in particular industrial occupations. The strike formally ended on 2 July 1936.

After proclaiming martial law, his second government suppressed the Rexists. It introduced measures against unemployment, which helped ease the political tensions. Also during his second term, Belgium gave up its military alliance with France and reverted to its traditional policy of neutrality, now dubbed a &quot;policy of independence&quot;.

In spring 1937, Rexist leader Léon Degrelle accused van Zeeland of having received money from the Belgian Nation Bank. van Zeeland denied this, but a commission found out he had received 330.000 bfr. He resigned as Prime Minister on 23 November, and the king named Paul-Emile Janson as his successor.

In 1939, van Zeeland became president of the &quot;Committee on Refugees&quot;, established in London, and was made High Commissioner for repatriating displaced Belgians in 1944. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1942. In 1946, he was one of the founders of the European League for Economic Cooperation.

After the war, van Zeeland served as Minister of Foreign Affairs in several Catholic governments between 1949 and 1954 and as economic advisor to the Belgian government and to the council of ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. He was Honorary Secretary General of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg meeting. In 1956, he finally retired from politics and became chairman of the Banque Belge d&#x27;Afrique.

In 2013, to the consternation of his family, it was discovered that he had founded a Panamanian offshore company in 1946.

<doc id="162399" wikidata="Q474101" url="?curid=162399" title="Amorica">
<text>Amorica (stylized as amorica.) is the third studio album by U.S. rock band The Black Crowes. Spawned from the band&#x27;s unreleased &quot;Tall&quot; album sessions, &quot;Amorica&quot; was released on November 1, 1994, on American Recordings. &quot;Amorica&quot; reached gold status in the United States, shipping 500,000 copies.

The album cover notably featured a close-up photo of the pelvic region of a woman wearing a United States flag bikini bottom with pubic hair showing at the top. The photo was taken from the cover of the July 1976 issue of &quot;Hustler&quot; magazine. The album with this cover was subsequently banned from chain stores like Walmart and Kmart, resulting in the cover being censored with a solid black background displaying only the garment.

Other songs recorded during the &quot;Amorica&quot; sessions were &quot;Feathers,&quot; &quot;Tied Up and Swallowed&quot; and &quot;Chevrolet&quot; (a Taj Mahal cover), which were later released as B-sides, bonus tracks or on compilation albums.

==Reception==
&quot;The Crowes haven&#x27;t ceased their cocky pillaging of the universal jukebox – echoes of the Stones and Led Zep abound,&quot; wrote &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Paul Evans, who awarded the album three and a half stars. &quot;But in joining the mix with offbeat kicks (Latino rhythms, wah-wah guitar, strange vocal treatments), they sound remarkably fresh.&quot;

In July 2014, &quot;Guitar World&quot; chose &quot;Amorica&quot; as one of &quot;50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot;, placing it at 50th place.

These methods can be used to measure the mechanical properties of single polymer molecules or proteins, or individual chemical bonds. The name &quot;force spectroscopy&quot;, although widely used in the scientific community, is somewhat misleading, because there is no true matter-radiation interaction.

Techniques that can be used to perform force spectroscopy include atomic force microscopy, optical tweezers, magnetic tweezers, acoustic force spectroscopy, microneedles, and biomembranes.

Force spectroscopy measures the behavior of a molecule under stretching or torsional mechanical force. In this way a great deal has been learned in recent years about the mechanochemical coupling in the enzymes responsible for muscle contraction, transport in the cell, energy generation (F1-ATPase), DNA replication and transcription (polymerases), DNA unknotting and unwinding (topoisomerases and helicases).

As a single-molecule technique, as opposed to typical ensemble spectroscopies, it allows a researcher to determine properties of the particular molecule under study. In particular, rare events such as conformational change, which are masked in an ensemble, may be observed.

==Experimental techniques==

There are many ways to accurately manipulate single molecules. Prominent among these are optical or magnetic tweezers, atomic-force-microscope (AFM) cantilevers and acoustic force spectroscopy. In all of these techniques, a biomolecule, such as protein or DNA, or some other biopolymer has one end bound to a surface or micrometre-sized bead and the other to a force sensor. The force sensor is usually a micrometre-sized bead or a cantilever, whose displacement can be measured to determine the force.

===Atomic force microscope cantilevers===
Molecules adsorbed on a surface are picked up by a 
microscopic tip (nanometres wide) that is located on the end of an elastic cantilever. In a more sophisticated version of this experiment (Chemical Force Microscopy) the tips are covalently functionalized with the molecules of interest. A piezoelectric controller then pulls up the cantilever. If some force is acting on the elastic cantilever (for example because some molecule is being stretched between the surface and the tip), this will deflect upward (repulsive force) or downward (attractive force). According to Hooke&#x27;s law, this deflection will be proportional to the force acting on the cantilever. Deflection is measured by the position of a laser beam reflected by the cantilever. This kind of set-up can measure forces as low as 10 pN (10−11 N), the fundamental resolution limit is given by the cantilever&#x27;s thermal noise.

The so-called force curve is the graph of force (or more precisely, of cantilever deflection) versus the piezoelectric position on the Z axis. An ideal Hookean spring, for example, would display a straight diagonal force curve.
Typically, the force curves observed in the force spectroscopy experiments consist of a contact (diagonal) region where the probe contacts the sample surface, and a non-contact region where the probe is off the sample surface. When the restoring force of the cantilever exceeds tip-sample adhesion force the probe jumps out of contact, and the magnitude of this jump is often used as a measure of adhesion force or rupture force. In general the rupture of a tip-surface bond is a stochastic process; therefore reliable quantification of the adhesion force requires taking multiple individual force curves. The histogram of the adhesion forces obtained in these multiple measurements provides the main data output for force spectroscopy measurement.

In biophysics, single-molecule force spectroscopy can be used to study the energy landscape underlying the interaction between two bio-molecules, like proteins. Here, one binding partner can be attached to a cantilever tip via a flexible linker molecule (PEG chain), while the other one is immobilized on a substrate surface. In a typical approach, the cantilever is repeatedly approached and retracted from the sample at a constant speed. In some cases, binding between the two partners will occur, which will become visible in the force curve, as the use of a flexible linker gives rise to a characteristic curve shape (see Worm-like chain model) distinct from adhesion. The collected rupture forces can then be analysed as a function of the bond loading rate. The resulting graph of the average rupture force as a function of the loading rate is called the &quot;force spectrum&quot; and forms the basic dataset for &quot;dynamic force spectroscopy&quot;.

In the ideal case of a single sharp energy barrier for the tip-sample interactions the dynamic force spectrum will show a linear increase of the rupture force as function of a logarithm of the loading rate, as described by a model proposed by Bell et al. Here, the slope of the rupture force spectrum is equal to the formula_1, where formula_2 is the distance from the energy minimum to the transition state. So far, a number of theoretical models exist describing the relationship between loading rate and rupture force, based upon different assumptions and predicting distinct curve shapes.

For example, Ma X.,Gosai A. et al., utilized dynamic force spectroscopy along with molecular dynamics simulations to find out the binding force between thrombin, a blood coagulation protein, and its DNA aptamer.

=== Acoustic force spectroscopy ===
A recently developed technique, acoustic force spectroscopy (AFS), allows the force manipulation of hundreds of single-molecules and single-cells in parallel, providing high experimental throughput. In this technique, a piezo element resonantly excites planar acoustic waves over a microfluidic chip. The generated acoustic waves are capable of exerting forces on microspheres with different density than the surrounding medium. Biomolecules, such as DNA, RNA or proteins, can be individually tethered between the microspheres and a surface and then probed by the acoustic forces exerted by the piezo sensor. With AFS devices it is possible to apply forces ranging from 0 to several hundreds of picoNewtons on hundreds of microspheres and obtain force-extension curves or histograms of rupture forces of many individual events in parallel.

This technique is mostly utilized to study DNA-bindings protein. For example, AFS was used to examine bacterial transcription with presence of antibacterial agents. Viral proteins also can be studied by AFS, for instance this technique was used to explore DNA compaction along with other single-molecule approaches.

Cells also can be manipulated by the acoustic forces directly, or by using microspheres as handles. 

===Optical tweezers===
Another technique that has been gaining ground for single molecule experiments is the use of optical tweezers for applying mechanical forces on molecules. A strongly focused laser beam has the ability to catch and hold particles (of dielectric material) in a size range from nanometers to micrometers. The trapping action of optical tweezers results from the dipole or optical gradient force on the dielectric sphere. The technique of using a focused laser beam as an atom trap was first applied in 1984 at Bell laboratories. Until then experiments had been carried out using oppositely directed lasers as a means to trap particles. Later experiments, at the same project at Bell laboratories and others since, showed damage-free manipulation on cells using an infrared laser. Thus, the ground was made for biological experiments with optical trapping.

Each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, AFM cantilevers, can measure angstrom-scale, millisecond events and forces larger than 10 pN. While glass microfibers cannot achieve such fine spatial and temporal resolution, they can measure piconewton forces. Optical tweezers allow the measurement of piconewton forces and nanometer displacements which is an ideal range for many biological experiments. Magnetic tweezers can measure femtonewton forces, and additionally they can also be used to apply torsion. AFS devices allow the statistical analysis of the mechanical properties of biological systems by applying picoNewton forces to hundreds of individual particles in parallel, with sub-millisecond response time.

==Applications==

Common applications of force spectroscopy are measurements of polymer elasticity, especially biopolymers such as RNA and DNA. Another biophysical application of polymer force spectroscopy is on protein unfolding. Modular proteins can be adsorbed to a gold or (more rarely) mica surface and then stretched. The sequential unfolding of modules is observed as a very characteristic sawtooth pattern of the force vs elongation graph; every tooth corresponds to the unfolding of a single protein module (apart from the last that is generally the detachment of the protein molecule from the tip). Much information about protein elasticity and protein unfolding can be obtained by this technique. Many proteins in the living cell must face mechanical stress.

Moreover, force spectroscopy can be used to investigate the enzymatic activity of proteins involved in DNA replication, transcription, organization and repair. This is achieved by measuring the position of a bead attached to a DNA-protein complex stalled on a DNA tether that has one end attached to a surface, while keeping the force constant. This technique has been used, for example, to study transcription elongation inhibition by Klebsidin and Acinetodin.

The other main application of force spectroscopy is the study of mechanical resistance of chemical bonds. In this case, generally the tip is functionalized with a ligand that binds to another molecule bound to the surface. The tip is pushed on the surface, allowing for contact between the two molecules, and then retracted until the newly formed bond breaks up. The force at which the bond breaks up is measured. Since mechanical breaking is a kinetic, stochastic process, the breaking force is not an absolute parameter, but it is a function of both temperature and pulling speed. Low temperatures and high pulling speeds correspond to higher breaking forces. By careful analysis of the breaking force at various pulling speeds, it is possible to map the energy landscape of the chemical bond under mechanical force. This is leading to interesting results in the study of antibody-antigen, protein-protein, protein-living cell interaction and catch bonds.

Recently this technique has been used in cell biology to measure the aggregative stochastic forces created by motor proteins that influence the motion of particles within the cytoplasm. In this way, force spectrum microscopy may be used better to understand the many cellular processes that require the motion of particles within cytoplasm.

<doc id="162401" wikidata="Q1130936" url="?curid=162401" title="Power chord">
<text>A power chord , also called a fifth chord, is a colloquial name for a chord on guitar, especially on electric guitar, that consists of the root note and the fifth, as well as possibly octaves of those notes. Power chords are commonly played with an amp with intentionally added distortion or overdrive effects. Power chords are a key element of many styles of rock, especially heavy metal and punk rock.

==Analysis==
When two or more notes are played through a distortion process that non-linearly transforms the audio signal, additional partials are generated at the sums and differences of the frequencies of the harmonics of those notes (intermodulation distortion). When a typical chord containing such intervals (for example, a major or minor chord) is played through distortion, the number of different frequencies generated, and the complex ratios between them, can make the resulting sound messy and indistinct. This effect is accentuated as most guitars are tuned based on equal temperament, with the result that minor thirds are narrower, and major thirds wider, than they would be in just intonation.

However, in a &quot;power chord&quot;, the ratio between the frequencies of the root and fifth are very close to the just interval 3:2. When played through distortion, the intermodulation leads to the production of partials closely related in frequency to the harmonics of the original two notes, producing a more coherent sound. The intermodulation makes the spectrum of the sound expand in both directions, and with enough distortion, a new fundamental frequency component appears an octave lower than the root note of the chord played without distortion, giving a richer, more bassy and more subjectively &quot;powerful&quot; sound than the undistorted signal. Even when played without distortion, the simple ratios between the harmonics in the notes of a power chord can give a stark and powerful sound, owing to the resultant tone (combination tone) effect. Power chords also have the advantage of being relatively easy to play , allowing fast chord changes and easy incorporation into melodies and riffs.

==Terminology==
Theorists are divided on whether a power chord can be considered a &quot;chord&quot; in the traditional sense, with some requiring a &quot;chord&quot; to contain a minimum of three degrees of the scale. When the same interval is found in traditional and classical music, it would not usually be called a &quot;chord&quot;, and may be considered a dyad (separated by an interval). However, the term is accepted as a pop and rock music term, most strongly associated with the overdriven electric guitar styles of hard rock, heavy metal, punk rock, and similar genres. The use of the term &quot;power chord&quot; has, to some extent, spilled over into the vocabulary of other instrumentalists, such as keyboard and synthesizer players.

Power chords are most commonly notated &quot;5&quot; or &quot;(no 3)&quot;. For example, &quot;C5&quot; or &quot;C(no 3)&quot; refer to playing the root (C) and fifth (G). These can be inverted, so that the G is played below the C (making an interval of a fourth). They can also be played with octave doublings of the root or fifth note, which makes a sound that is subjectively higher pitched with less power in the low frequencies, but still retains the character of a power chord.

Another notation is ind, designating the chord as &quot;indeterminate&quot;. This refers to the fact that a power chord is neither major nor minor, as there is no third present. This gives the power chord a chameleon-like property; if played where a major chord might be expected, it can sound like a major chord, but when played where a minor chord might be expected, it can sound minor.

==History==

The first written instance of a power chord for guitar in the 20th century is to be found in the &quot;Preludes&quot; of Heitor Villa-Lobos, a Brazilian composer of the early twentieth century. Although classical guitar composer Francisco Tárrega used it before him, modern musicians use Villa-Lobos&#x27;s version to this day. Power chords&#x27; use in rock music can be traced back to commercial recordings in the 1950s. Robert Palmer pointed to electric blues guitarists Willie Johnson and Pat Hare, both of whom played for Sun Records in the early 1950s, as the true originators of the power chord, citing as evidence Johnson&#x27;s playing on Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s &quot;How Many More Years&quot; (recorded 1951) and Hare&#x27;s playing on James Cotton&#x27;s &quot;Cotton Crop Blues&quot; (recorded 1954). Scotty Moore opened Elvis Presley&#x27;s 1957 hit &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; with power chords. The &quot;power chord&quot; as known to modern electric guitarists was popularized first by Link Wray, who built on the distorted electric guitar sound of early records and by tearing the speaker cone in his 1958 instrumental &quot;Rumble.&quot;

A later hit song built around power chords was &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; by the Kinks, released in 1964. This song&#x27;s riffs exhibit fast power-chord changes. The Who&#x27;s guitarist, Pete Townshend, performed power chords with a theatrical windmill-strum, for example in &quot;My Generation&quot;. On King Crimson&#x27;s &quot;Red&quot; album, Robert Fripp thrashed with power chords. Power chords are important in many forms of punk rock music, popularized in the genre by Ramones guitarist Johnny Ramone. Many punk guitarists used only power chords in their songs, most notably Billie Joe Armstrong and Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein.

==Techniques==
Power chords are often performed within a single octave, as this results in the closest matching of overtones. Octave doubling is sometimes done in power chords. Power chords are often pitched in a middle register.

Shown above are four examples of an F5 chord. The letter names above the chords only indicate which different voicing is being used, and should not be conflated with the chord names typically used in popular music (e.g., C Major, B minor, etc.) A common voicing is the 1–5 perfect fifth (A), to which the octave can be added, 1-5-1 (B). A perfect fourth 5-1 (C) is also a power chord, as it implies the &quot;missing&quot; lower 1 pitch. Either or both of the pitches may be doubled an octave above or below (D is 5-1-5-1), which leads to another common variation, 5-1-5 (not shown).

===Spider chords===
The spider chord is a guitar technique popularized during the 1980s thrash metal scene. Regarded as being popularized and named by Dave Mustaine of Megadeth, it is used to reduce string noise when playing (mostly chromatic) riffs that require chords across several strings. The chord or technique is used in the songs &quot;Wake Up Dead&quot;, &quot;Holy Wars...The Punishment Due&quot;, and &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;.

As seen in the above tab, the two power chords may be played in succession without shifting, making it easier and quicker, and thus avoiding string noise. The normal fingering would be formula_1 for both chords, requiring a simultaneous shift and string change. Note that the two power chords are a major third apart: if the first chord is the tonic the second is the minor submediant. The spider chord fingering also allows access to a major seventh chord without the third:
The spider chord requires the player to use all four fingers of the fretting hand, thus its name. This technique then allows one to run down the neck playing either of the two chords.

==Fingering==

Perhaps the most common implementation is 1-5-1&#x27;, that is, the root note, a note a fifth above the root, and a note an octave above the root. When the strings are a fourth apart, especially the lower four strings in standard tuning, the lowest note is played with some fret on some string and the higher two notes are two frets higher on the next two strings. Using standard tuning, notes on the first or second string must be played one fret higher than this. (A bare fifth without octave doubling is the same, except that the highest of the three strings, in brackets below, is not played. A bare fifth with the bass note on the second string has the same fingering as one on the fifth or sixth string.)

 D||----(5)----(7)-----7------9------5------7-------------------|
 A||-----5------7------5------7---------------------------------|
 E||-----3------5-----------------------------------------------|

An inverted barre fifth, i.e. a barre fourth, can be played with one finger, as in the example below, from the riff in &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; by Deep Purple:

 G5/D Bb5/F C5/G G5/D Bb5/F Db5/Ab C5/G

 |-----------------------|---------------------||
 |------3—-5--3—--0------|--------------------*||
 |---5—-3--5-—3---0------|--------------------*||
 |---5-------------------|---------------------||

Another implementation used is 5-1&#x27;-5&#x27;, that is, a note a fourth below the root, the root note, and a note a fifth above the root. (This is sometimes called a &quot;fourth chord&quot;, but usually the second note is taken as the root, although it&#x27;s not the lowest one.) When the strings are a fourth apart, the lower two notes are played with some fret on some two strings and the highest note is two frets higher on the next string. Of course, using standard tuning, notes on the first or second string must be played one fret higher.

<text>A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a typically conical volcano built up by many alternating layers (strata) of hardened lava and tephra. Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile with a summit crater and explosive eruptions. Some have collapsed summit craters called calderas. The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and solidifies before spreading far, due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having high to intermediate levels of silica (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of less viscous mafic magma. Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but can travel as far as 8 km (5 mi).

The term &quot;composite volcano&quot; is used because strata are usually mixed and uneven instead of neat layers. They are among the most common types of volcanoes; more than 700 stratovolcanoes have erupted lava during the Holocene Epoch (the last 11,700 years), and many older, now extinct, stratovolcanoes erupted lava as far back as Archean times. Stratovolcanoes are typically found in subduction zones but they also occur in other geological settings. Two examples of stratovolcanoes famous for catastrophic eruptions are Krakatoa in Indonesia (which erupted in 1883 claiming 36,000 lives) and Mount Vesuvius in Italy (which erupted in 79 A.D killing an estimated 2,000 people). In modern times, Mount St. Helens (1980) in Washington State, US, and Mount Pinatubo (1991) in the Philippines have erupted catastrophically, but with fewer deaths.

The existence of stratovolcanoes on other bodies of the Solar System has not been conclusively demonstrated. Zephyria Tholus is one of two mountains in the Aeolis region of Mars that have been proposed as possible stratovolcanoes.

==Distribution==
Stratovolcanoes are common at subduction zones, forming chains and clusters along plate tectonic boundaries where an oceanic crust plate is drawn under a continental crust plate (continental arc volcanism, e.g. Cascade Range, Andes, Campania) or another oceanic crust plate (island arc volcanism, e.g. Japan, Philippines, Aleutian Islands).

Stratovolcanoes also occur in some other geological settings, for example as a result of intraplate volcanism on oceanic islands far from plate boundaries. Examples are Teide in the Canary Islands, and Pico do Fogo in Cape Verde. 
Stratovolcanoes have formed in continental rifts. Examples in the East African Rift are Ol Doinyo Lengai in Tanzania, and Longonot in Kenya.

==Formation==
Subduction zone volcanoes form when hydrous minerals are pulled down into the mantle on the slab. These hydrous minerals, such as chlorite and serpentine, release their water into the mantle which decreases its melting point by 60 to 100 °C. The release of water from hydrated minerals is termed &quot;dewatering&quot;, and occurs at specific pressures and temperatures for each mineral, as the plate descends to greater depths. This allows the mantle to partially melt and generate magma. This is called flux melting. The magma then rises through the crust, incorporating silica-rich crustal rock, leading to a final intermediate composition. When the magma nears the top surface, it pools in a magma chamber within the crust below the stratovolcano.

The processes that trigger the final eruption remain a question for further research. Possible mechanisms include:

* Magma differentiation, in which the lightest, most silica-rich magma and volatiles such as water, halogens, and sulfur dioxide accumulate in the uppermost part of the magma chamber. This can dramatically increase pressures.
* Fractional crystallization of the magma. When anhydrous minerals such as feldspar crystallize out of the magma, this concentrates volatiles in the remaining liquid, which can lead to a second boiling that causes a gas phase (carbon dioxide or water) to separate from the liquid magma and raise magma chamber pressures.
* Injection of fresh magma into the magma chamber, which mixes and heats the cooler magma already present. This could force volatiles out of solution and lower the density of the cooler magma, both of which increase pressure. There is considerable evidence for magma mixing just before many eruptions, including magnesium-rich olivine crystals in freshly erupted silicic lava that show no reaction rim. This is possible only if the lava erupted immediately after mixing since olivine rapidly reacts with silicic magma to form a rim of pyroxene.
* Progressive melting of the surrounding country rock.

These internal triggers may be modified by external triggers such as sector collapse, earthquakes, or interactions with groundwater. Some of these triggers operate only under limited conditions. For example, sector collapse (where part of the flank of a volcano collapses in a massive landslide) can only trigger the eruption of a very shallow magma chamber. Magma differentiation and thermal expansion also are ineffective as triggers for eruptions from deep magma chambers.

==Hazards==


In recorded history, explosive eruptions at subduction zone (convergent-boundary) volcanoes have posed the greatest hazard to civilizations. Subduction-zone stratovolcanoes, such as Mount St. Helens, Mount Etna and Mount Pinatubo, typically erupt with explosive force because the magma is too viscous to allow easy escape of volcanic gases. As a consequence, the tremendous internal pressures of the trapped volcanic gases remain and intermingle in the pasty magma. Following the breaching of the vent and the opening of the crater, the magma degasses explosively. The magma and gases blast out with high speed and full force.

Since 1600 CE, nearly 300,000 people have been killed by volcanic eruptions. Most deaths were caused by pyroclastic flows and lahars, deadly hazards that often accompany explosive eruptions of subduction-zone stratovolcanoes. Pyroclastic flows are swift, avalanche-like, ground-sweeping, incandescent mixtures of hot volcanic debris, fine ash, fragmented lava, and superheated gases that can travel at speeds over . Around 30,000 people were killed by pyroclastic flows during the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée on the island of Martinique in the Caribbean. During March and April 1982, El Chichón in the State of Chiapas in southeastern Mexico, erupted 3 times, causing the worst volcanic disaster in that country&#x27;s history and killied more than 2,000 people in pyroclastic flows.

Two Decade Volcanoes that erupted in 1991 provide examples of stratovolcano hazards. On 15 June, Mount Pinatubo erupted and caused an ash cloud to shoot 40 km (25 mi) into the air. It produced large pyroclastic surges and lahar floods that caused a lot of damage to the surrounding area. Mount Pinatubo, located in Central Luzon just 90 km (56 mi) west-northwest of Manila, had been dormant for six centuries before the 1991 eruption. This eruption was one of the 2nd largest in the 20th century. It produced a large volcanic ash cloud that affected global temperatures, lowering them in areas as much as .5 °C. The volcanic ash cloud consisted of 22 million tons of SO2 which combined with water droplets to create sulfuric acid. In 1991 Japan&#x27;s Mount Unzen also erupted, after 200 years of inactivity. It&#x27;s located on the island of Kyushu about 40 km (25 mi) east of Nagasaki. Beginning in June, a newly formed lava dome repeatedly collapsed. This generated a pyroclastic flow that flowed down the mountain&#x27;s slopes at speeds as high as 200 km/h (120 mph). The 1991 eruption of Mount Unzen was one of the worst volcanic disasters in Japan&#x27;s history, once killing more than 15,000 people in 1792.

The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD is the most famous example of a hazardous stratovolcano eruption. It completely smothered the nearby ancient cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum with thick deposits of pyroclastic surges and pumice ranging from 6–7 meters deep. Pompeii had 10,000–20,000 inhabitants at the time of eruption. Mount Vesuvius is recognized as one of the most dangerous of the world&#x27;s volcanoes, due to its capacity for powerful explosive eruptions coupled with the high population density of the surrounding Metropolitan Naples area (totaling about 3.6 million inhabitants).

===Ash===

In addition to potentially affecting the climate, volcanic ash clouds from explosive eruptions pose a serious hazard to aviation. Volcanic ash clouds consist of silt- or sand-sized pieces of rock, mineral, volcanic glass. Volcanic ash grains are jagged, abrasive, and don&#x27;t dissolve in water. For example, during the 1982 eruption of Galunggung in Java, British Airways Flight 9 flew into the ash cloud, causing it to sustain temporary engine failure and structural damage. Although no crashes have happened due to ash, more than 60, mostly commercial aircraft, have been damaged. Some of these incidents resulted in emergency landings. Ashfalls are a threat to health when inhaled and are also a threat to property. A square yard of a 4-inch thick volcanic ash layer can weigh 120–200 pounds and can get twice as heavy when wet. Wet ash also poses a risk to electronics due to its conductive nature. Dense clouds of hot volcanic ash can be expelled due to the collapse of an eruptive column, or laterally due to the partial collapse of a volcanic edifice or lava dome during explosive eruptions. These clouds are known as pyroclastic surges and in addition to volcanic ash, they contain hot lava, pumice, rock, and volcanic gas. Pyroclastic surges flow at speeds over 50 mph and are at temperatures between 200 °C – 700 °C. These surges can cause major damage to property and people in their path.

===Lava===

Lava flows from stratovolcanoes are generally not a significant threat to humans or animals because the highly viscous lava moves slowly enough for everyone to evacuate. Most deaths attributed to lava are due to related causes such as explosions and asphyxiation from toxic gas. Lava flows can bury homes and farms in thick volcanic rock which greatly reduces property value. However, not all stratovolcanoes erupt viscous and sticky lava. Nyiragongo, near Lake Kivu in central Africa, is very dangerous because its magma has an unusually low silica content, making it much less viscous than other stratovolcanoes. Low viscosity lava can generate massive lava fountains, while lava of thicker viscosity can solidify within the vent, creating a volcanic plug. Volcanic plugs can trap volcanic gas and create pressure in the magma chamber, resulting in violent eruptions. Lava is typically between 700 and 1,200 °C (1,300–2,200 °F).

===Volcanic bombs===
Volcanic bombs are masses of unconsolidated rock and lava that are ejected during an eruption. Volcanic bombs are classified as larger than 64mm (2.5 inches). Anything from 2 to 64mm is classified as lapilli. When erupted, volcanic bombs are still molten and partially cool and solidify on their descent. They can form ribbon or oval shapes that can also flatten on impact with the ground. Volcanic bombs are associated with Strombolian and Vulcanian eruptions and basaltic lava. Ejection velocities ranging from 200 to 400 m/s have been recorded causing volcanic bombs to be destructive.

===Lahar===
Lahars (from a Javanese term for volcanic mudflows) are a mixture of volcanic debris and water. Lahars can result from heavy rainfall during or before the eruption or interaction with ice and snow. Meltwater mixes with volcanic debris causing a fast moving mudflow. Lahars are typically about 60% sediment and 40% water. Depending on the abundance of volcanic debris the lahar can be fluid or thick like concrete. Lahars have the strength and speed to flatten structures and cause great bodily harm, gaining speeds up to dozens of kilometers per hour. In the 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia, Pyroclastic surges melted snow and ice atop the 5,321 m (17,457 ft) high Andean volcano. The ensuing lahar killed 25,000 people and flooded the city of Armero and nearby settlements.

=== Volcanic gas ===

As a volcano forms, several different gases mix with magma in the volcanic chamber. During an eruption the gases are then released into the atmosphere which can lead to toxic human exposure. The most abundant of these gases is H2O (water) followed by CO2 (carbon dioxide), SO2 (sulfur dioxide), H2S (hydrogen sulfide), and HF (hydrogen fluoride). If at concentrations of more than 3% in the air, when breathed in CO2 can cause dizziness and difficulty breathing. At more than 15% concentration CO2 causes death. CO2 can settle into depressions in the land, leading to deadly, odorless pockets of gas. SO2 classified as a respiratory, skin, and eye irritant if come into contact with. It is known for its pungent egg smell and role in ozone depletion and has the potential to cause acid rain downwind of an eruption. H2S has an even stronger odor than SO2 as well as being even more toxic. Exposure for less than an hour at concentrations of over 500 ppm causes death. HF and similar species can coat ash particles and once deposited can poison soil and water. Gases are also emitted during volcanic degassing, which is a passive release of gas during periods of dormancy.

==Eruptions that affected global climate==

As per the above examples, while eruptions like Mount Unzen have caused deaths and local damage, the impact of the June 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo was seen globally. The eruptive columns reached heights of 40 km and dumped 17 megatons of SO2 into the lower stratosphere. The aerosols that formed from the sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and other gases dispersed around the world. The SO2 in this cloud combined with water (both of volcanic and atmospheric origin) and formed sulfuric acid, blocking a portion of the sunlight from reaching the troposphere. This caused the global temperature to decrease by about 0.4 °C (0.72 °F) from 1992 to 1993. These aerosols caused the ozone layer to reach the lowest concentrations recorded at that time. An eruption the size of Mount Pinatubo affected the weather for a few years; with warmer winters and cooler summers observed.

A similar phenomenon occurred in the April 1815, the eruption of Mount Tambora on Sumbawa island in Indonesia. This eruption is recognized as the most powerful eruption in recorded history. Its eruption cloud lowered global temperatures as much as 0.4 to 0.7 °C. In the year following the eruption, most of the Northern Hemisphere experienced cooler temperatures during the summer. In the northern hemisphere, 1816 was known as the &quot;Year Without a Summer&quot;. The eruption caused crop failures, food shortages, and floods that killed over 100,000 people across Europe, Asia, and North America.

<text>Oglethorpe University is a private liberal arts college in Brookhaven, Georgia, United States. It was chartered in 1835 and named in honor of General James Edward Oglethorpe, founder of the Colony of Georgia.

==History==

Oglethorpe University was chartered in 1834 in Midway (now known as Hardwick), Georgia just south of Milledgeville, then the state capital. The school was built and, at that time, governed by the Presbyterian Church, making it one of the South&#x27;s earliest denominational institutions. The American Civil War led to the school&#x27;s closing in 1862.

The college followed the relocation of the capital to Atlanta. In 1870, it began holding classes at the present site of Atlanta City Hall. Plagued by financial difficulties, the school closed its doors for a second time in 1872.

Oglethorpe College was re-chartered as a non-denominational institution in 1913 by Thornwell Jacobs, whose grandfather Ferdinand Jacobs had served on the faculty of Old Oglethorpe. In 1915, the cornerstone to the new campus was laid at its present location on Peachtree Road in Brookhaven. The cornerstone-laying ceremony took place at North Avenue Presbyterian Church. Jacobs would serve as president for nearly 30 years.

In the early 1940s Oglethorpe University had a medical school. Under the direction of John Bernard, the university was given several elephants for research that were discovered to have been poisoned at a Ringling Brothers Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus event nearby. After the students finished dissecting the animals they were buried under what is known today as the Philip Weltner Library.

In 1936, William Randolph Hearst gifted to the university, and in 1948 he made a donation of $100,000; the university administration building was subsequently named in honor of Hearst&#x27;s mother, Phoebe Hearst.

Oglethorpe University became Oglethorpe College in 1965, and reclaimed the designation &quot;university&quot; in 1972. Oglethorpe&#x27;s campus buildings were built in a Gothic revival architecture style. This area of the campus is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

==Academics==
The college is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

==Coat of arms==
Oglethorpe&#x27;s collegiate coat-of-arms is emblazoned with three boars&#x27; heads and the Latin inscription &quot;Nescit Cedere,&quot; meaning &quot;He does not know how to give up.&quot;

==Campus==
The Conant Performing Arts Center, completed in 1997, served as the seasonal home of Georgia Shakespeare until fall 2014.
The Oglethorpe University Museum of Art opened in 1984 and is located on the top floor of the Philip Weltner Library. The two galleries, the South and Skylight, and gift shop cover 7,000 square feet. Bringing in thousands of visitors each year, the museum has become an important point of interest in Atlanta&#x27;s art community.

In 1994, Lupton Hall, Phoebe Hearst Hall, Lowry Hall and Hermance Stadium were added to the National Register of Historic Places. In addition, a historic district including part or all of the campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Other academic buildings include Goslin Hall, primarily used for science courses, and J. Mack Robinson Hall, primarily used for Communication and Art classes.

Oglethorpe University is home to the Crypt of Civilization, the first and most complete time capsule ever created, according to the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;. Scheduled to be opened in AD 8113, it is located in the basement of Phoebe Hearst Hall. Oglethorpe University is also home to the International Time Capsule Society, a of time capsule projects worldwide.

The Turner Lynch Campus Center opened in the fall of 2013. The IW &quot;Ike&quot; Cousins Center for Science and Innovation (an expansion of a building constructed in 1970) opened in 2019. In addition to science facilities, it houses the Q. William Hammack Jr. School of Business.

From its opening in 1990 until 2003, the Seigakuin Atlanta International School was located on the property of Oglethorpe University, in a former public school building. Also from 1974 to 1981, Georgia Japanese Language School was located on campus before it moved to another property.

==Study abroad==
Oglethorpe University promotes the concept of international education and travel as an essential component of an academic education. Oglethorpe University Students Abroad sponsors trips for-credit, short-term, partnerships and agreements. Oglethorpe University offers a selection of opportunities in four divisions: International Exchange Partnerships, Independent Study Abroad-Non Partnerships, Short Term Trips, and Associate Student Programs for Special Study Abroad.

For foreign students wishing to study in the United States, Education First, an International Study Abroad Organization, opened its Atlanta Language Center on the Oglethorpe University Campus in the fall 2012.

==Greek life==
As of 2014, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; noted that 11% of men at Oglethorpe belonged to fraternities, while 13% of women belonged to sororities.

==Events and traditions==
===Oglethorpe Day===
In early February, the college hosts events to celebrate the anniversary of James Oglethorpe&#x27;s founding of the colony of Georgia. The annual &quot;Petrels of Fire&quot; race, an homage to Trinity College&#x27;s Great Court Run portrayed in the movie &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, features students attempting to run the perimeter of the Academic Quad before the Lupton Hall belltower finishes its noon chimes.

===Boar&#x27;s Head===

Held on the first Friday of December, this event is modeled after the Boar&#x27;s Head Gaudy of Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, Boar&#x27;s Head is the traditional start to the Christmas season at Oglethorpe. Festivities include a concert featuring the University Singers, student organizations and performers from the community, as well as the lighting of the college&#x27;s Christmas tree. Newly initiated members of Omicron Delta Kappa receive recognition and, as a rite of initiation, kiss the ceremonial boar&#x27;s head.

==Athletics==

Oglethorpe University teams compete as a member of the Southern Athletic Association (SAA) at the NCAA Division III level and are known as the Stormy Petrels. The Stormy Petrels were a member of the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference (SCAC) until 2012. Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, tennis and track &amp; field; women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, tennis, track &amp; field, and volleyball.

The most successful athletic program is its men&#x27;s golf team. Oglethorpe won the NCAA Division III Men&#x27;s Golf Championships in 2009 and again in 2012. They qualified for 18 straight NCAA tournaments from 2000–2017, and earned their 14th top 10 finish at the event in 2019.

Former Major League Soccer player Jon Akin is the head men&#x27;s soccer coach at Oglethorpe University. In 2014, men&#x27;s assistant coach Ryan Roushandel signed with the Atlanta Silverbacks to play soccer professionally while maintaining his duties with the program at Oglethorpe.

In 2011, the men&#x27;s soccer program won its first conference championship in school history with a 1–0 victory over Centre College. This win sent them to the NCAA Division III Men&#x27;s Soccer Championship, also a first in school history for the program. Later on in the spring of 2013, Mark Lavery, an alumnus and All-American member of the 2011 team signed with the Atlanta Silverbacks, a professional soccer team in the North American Soccer League (NASL). Lavery became the first Oglethorpe graduate to play soccer professionally.

In the fall of 2013, the men&#x27;s soccer team won its second conference championship in school history with a 3–1 victory over Millsaps College. They compiled an 11–3–3 record over the season. The team did not receive a bid into the NCAA national tournament because the Southern Athletic Association was in its second phase of a new-conference transition stage.The men&#x27;s soccer team won the SAA championship for the second time in 2017 and advanced to the second round of the NCAA tournament, losing to host Washington and Lee University in a penalty shootout after beating North Carolina Wesleyan College in the first round. They finished first in SAA regular season play each season from 2015 to 2018.

The women&#x27;s basketball program earned four straight bids to the NCAA Division III Women&#x27;s Basketball Championship from 2006-2009, culminating in trips to the national semifinals in 2008 and the round of 16 in 2009. They also won the program&#x27;s only SCAC championship in 2009.

More recently, the program saw a resurgence with back-to-back trips to the national tournament in 2018 and 2019, and an SAA championship in 2018. The team advanced to the second round of the NCAA tournament in 2019, beating The University of Chicago in the opening round before falling to host Transylvania University in the second round.

===Mascot===
Thornwell Jacobs chose an unusual mascot to represent Oglethorpe&#x27;s athletic teams: the Stormy Petrel. According to popular legend, James Oglethorpe had observed the Wilson&#x27;s storm petrel during his voyage to the New World and admired the diminutive seabird for its hardiness and courage during stormy weather. In March 2002, ESPN&#x27;s David Lloyd named the Stormy Petrel as one of the most memorable college mascot names of all time, second only to the Banana Slugs of UC Santa Cruz.

<doc id="162410" wikidata="Q220563" url="?curid=162410" title="United Nations Secretariat">
<text>The United Nations Secretariat is one of the six principal organs of the United Nations (UN), The secretariat is the UN&#x27;s executive arm. The secretariat has an important role in setting the agenda for the deliberative and decision-making bodies of the UN (i.e., the General Assembly, Economic and Social Council, and Security Council), and the implementation of the decision of these bodies. The secretary-general, who is appointed by the General Assembly, is the head of the secretariat.

The mandate of the secretariat is a wide one. Dag Hammarskjöld, the UN&#x27;s second secretary-general, described its power as follows: &quot;The United Nations is what member nations made it, but within the limits set by government action and government cooperation, much depends on what the secretariat makes it. It has creative capacity. It can introduce new ideas. It can, in proper forms, take initiatives. It can put before member governments findings which will influence their actions&quot;. 

The United Nations Department of Political Affairs, which has a role analogous to a ministry of foreign affairs, is a part of the secretariat. So is the Department of Peace Operations. The secretariat is the main source of economic and political analysis for the General Assembly and Security Council; it administers operations initiated by UN&#x27;s deliberative organs, operates political missions, prepares assessments that precede peacekeeping operations, appoints the heads of peacekeeping operations, conducts surveys and research, communicates with non-state actors such as media and non-government organizations, and is responsible for publishing all of the treaties and international agreements.

== Secretary-general ==
The UN secretary-general&#x27;s duties include helping resolve international disputes, administering peacekeeping operations, organizing international conferences, gathering information on the implementation of Security Council decisions, and consulting with member governments regarding various initiatives. Key secretariat offices in this area include the Office of the Coordinator of Humanitarian Affairs and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. The secretary-general may bring to the attention of the Security Council any matter that, in his or her opinion, may threaten international peace and security. The current secretary-general of the UN is António Guterres.

== Organization==
The secretariat is divided into offices and departments. The hierarchy within each is as follows:
:Office: a minimum of 20 high level professionals under the supervision of a D-2 staff member (division head), or in few cases an assistant secretary-general or under secretary-general
:Division: a minimum of 15 high level professionals under the supervision of a D-2 staff member (division head)
:Service: a minimum of 8 high level professionals under the supervision of a D-1 (general administrator) staff member
:Section: a minimum of 4 professionals under the supervisions of a P-4 (8–12 years experience) or a P-5 (13–17 years experience) staff member
:Unit: a minimum of 4 positions under the supervision of a chief

== Staffing ==

As at 31 December 2022, there are 36,791 staff in the UN Secretariat from more than 190 nationalities and working across 474 duty stations. 
Eligibility for employment is based on a competitive application process, and there are opportunities across a variety of positions, from internships to mid-level roles and senior leadership appointments. Qualifications for membership include &quot;the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity&quot;, according to the UN Charter. Staff-members are appointed by the secretary-general alone and are assigned to the organs of the UN. Staff members are appointed on a temporary or permanent basis, under the discretion of the secretary-general. During staff recruitment, geographical representation is an especially prominent selection factor in order for the UN workforce to accurately reflect the scope of member states present in the UN. The charter states that staff members are responsible &quot;only to the organization&quot; and are prohibited from any action or influence that would suggest affiliation with a government or organization outside the UN.

Headquartered in New York, the secretariat functions through duty stations in Addis Ababa, Bangkok, Beirut, Geneva, Nairobi, Santiago and Vienna, in addition to offices all over the world.

One study finds the following factors play a role in the selection of staff for the secretariat: a desire to achieve a minimum number of officials from each state; population size; and lo assessment of dues. The most overrepresented states in the secretariat are small, rich democracies. The Nordic states stand out, in particular, when it comes to overrepresentation.

== Status of women in the secretariat==
Representation of women in the UN, particularly at managerial and decision-making positions at the D-1 level and above, has been a UN General Assembly concern and goal since 1970.
&lt;ref name=&quot;A/RES/45/239&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1984, the UN Secretariat, in order to achieve early gender equality, issued several five-year &quot;action plans&quot;, including strategic plans, to improve the status of women in the secretariat.&lt;ref name=&quot;40/258. 18 December 1985&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These plans, however, did not have the desired impact, and progress in achieving gender parity remained slow.

In December 1994, the UN General Assembly&#x27;s &quot;disappointment&quot; that its gender equality target were not met urged the secretary-general to prioritize the recruitment and promotion of women to reach to 50/50 representation in D1 and above posts by 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;ST/SGB/282&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;A/RES/49/167 - 23/dec&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In Feb 2004, gender parity target for the secretariat was once again revised to 2015. In 2009, despite the plans, and General Assembly resolutions, the representation of women in the UN secretariat remained well below parity at 29.2 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;A /65/334&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Representation of women at decision making levels ===
The representation of women in the UN secretariat, at the D1 level, in 2000, was 30.3 percent. Instead of increasing, in the next decade, the representation of women in the secretariat decreased to 26.7 percent. In December 2011, the representation of women in the secretariat at the D1 level was 27.4 percent, an increase of .6 percent over a two-year period.&lt;ref name=&quot;A /67/347&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the current rate of progress, it is estimated that gender parity at the D-1 to higher levels will not be achieved until after 102 years. At the D2 level, the representation of women in 2011 was 24.4 percent.

===Special measures for the achievement of gender equality===

To ensure that the gender equality target mandated by the General Assembly is met, the secretariat, in September 1999, promulgated an administrative instruction (AI) on &quot;Special Measures for the Achievement of Gender Equality&quot; (ST/AI/1999/9)&lt;ref name=&quot;ST /AI/1999/9-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Gender Equality A/I echoes the goals of, and is in conformity with, the mandate of Articles 8 and 101 of the Charter of the United Nations, and Article 4 paragraph 1 of the &quot;Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)&quot;.

On 4 September 2012, in his annual reports to the General Assembly, titled &quot;Improvement of the Status of Women in the United Nations System&quot;, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated that the aim of the special measures was to ensure &quot;gender balance in recruitment and promotion&quot;. and that special measures would remain in effect until the &quot;goal of gender parity is achieved&quot;, and sustained for a period of time.&quot; The secretary-general, in his recommendations to the General Assembly, noted that the &quot; United Nations Secretariat, pursuant to the decision of the Policy Committee chaired by the Secretary-General&quot; is to &quot;ensure the effective implementation of special measures for gender equality. These measures include mandatory selection of equally or better-qualified women candidates…&quot;

== Reforms ==
Since its creation, the secretariat has undergone extensive reforms. On 21 March 2005, Secretary-General Kofi Annan proposed several reforms for the secretariat. He announced his intentions to appoint a scientific adviser, create a peacebuilding support office, establish a cabinet-style decision-making mechanism, and strengthen the mediation function. He also asked the General Assembly to appropriate funds for a one-time staff buyout; to work with him in revising budgetary and human resources rules; to grant the secretary-general more managerial authority and flexibility; to strengthen the Office of Internal Oversight Services; and &quot;to review all mandates older than five years to see whether the activities concerned are still genuinely needed or whether the resources assigned to them can be reallocated in response to new and emerging challenges&quot;.

<text>Société des Automobiles Alpine SAS, commonly known as Alpine (, ), is a French manufacturer of sports cars and racing cars established in 1955. The Alpine car marque was created in 1954.

Jean Rédélé, the founder of Alpine, was originally a Dieppe garage proprietor who began to achieve success in motorsport with one of the few French cars that were produced just after the Second World War, the Renault 4CV. The company has been closely related to Renault through its history, and was bought by it in 1973.

The Alpine competition department merged into Renault Sport in 1976 and the production of Alpine-badged models ceased in 1995. The Alpine brand was relaunched with the 2017 introduction of the new Alpine A110. In January 2021, as part of a company revamp, Renault announced that Renault Sport was again merged into Alpine to form an Alpine business unit.

In 2024, Alpine started producing electric vehicles by rolling out the Alpine A290. As part of its global expansion, Alpine in 2023 announced plans to enter the North American market in 2027 with a mid-size electric crossover and a large electric SUV.

== History ==

=== Early days ===

Using Renault 4CVs, Jean Rédélé gained class wins in a number of major events, including the Mille Miglia and Coupe des Alpes. As his experience with the 4CV grew, he incorporated many modifications, including special five-speed gearboxes replacing the original three-speed unit. To provide a lighter car, he built a number of special versions with lightweight aluminium bodies, driving them at Le Mans and Sebring with some success in the early 1950s.

Encouraged by the development of these cars and subsequent customer demand, he created the Alpine brand in 1954. It was named &quot;Alpine&quot; after his &quot;Coupe des Alpes&quot; successes. He did not realise that in England the previous year, Sunbeam had introduced a sports coupe derived from the Sunbeam Talbot, named the &quot;Sunbeam Alpine&quot;. This naming issue caused problems for Alpine throughout its history.
In 1955, Rédélé worked with the carrosserie Chappe et Gessalin. They were amongst the pioneers of auto glassfibre construction and produced a small coupe, based on 4CV mechanicals, called the Alpine A106. The A106 achieved a number of successes through the 1950s and was joined by a low and stylish cabriolet. Styling for the car was contracted to the Italian designer Giovanni Michelotti. Under the glassfibre body was a very stiff chassis based on a central tubular backbone which was to be the hallmark of all Alpines.

Alpine then took the Michelotti cabriolet design and developed a 2+2 closed coupe (or &#x27;berlinette&#x27;) body for it: this became the Alpine A108, now featuring the Dauphine Gordini 845 cc engine, which on later models was bored out to give a capacity of 904 cc or (subsequently) 998 cc. The A108 was built between 1958 and 1963.

=== 1960s ===

In 1962, the A108 began to be produced also in Brazil, by Willys-Overland, being renamed the Willys Interlagos (berlineta, coupé and convertible).

By now the car&#x27;s mechanicals were beginning to show their age in Europe. Alpine was already working closely with Renault and when the Renault R8 saloon was introduced in 1962, Alpine redeveloped their chassis and made a number of minor body changes to allow the use of R8 mechanicals.

This new car was the A110 Berlinette Tour de France, named after a successful run with the Alpine A108 in the 1962 event. Starting with a 956 cc engine of , the same chassis and body developed with relatively minor changes over the years to the stage where, by 1974, the little cars were handling 1800 cc engines developing +. With a competition weight for the car of around , the performance was excellent.

Alpine achieved increasing success in rallying, and by 1968 had been allocated the whole Renault competition budget. This close collaboration with Renault allowed Alpines to be sold and maintained in France by normal Renault dealerships. Real top level success started in 1968 with outright wins in the &quot;Coupe des Alpes&quot; and other international events. By this time the competition cars were fitted with 1440 cc engines derived from the Renault R8 Gordini. Competition successes became numerous, helped by the fact that Alpine was the first company fully to exploit the competitions homologation rules.

=== 1970s ===
In 1971, Alpines finished first, second and fourth in the Monte Carlo rally, using cars with engines derived from the Renault 16. In 1973, the newer A110 1800 finished first, second, third, and fifth and went on to win the World Rally Championship outright, beating Porsche, Lancia and Ford. During this time, production of the Alpine A110 increased and manufacturing deals were struck for A110s and A108s with factories in a number of other countries including Spain, Mexico, Brazil and Bulgaria.

With 1973 came the international petrol crisis, which had profound effects on many specialist car manufacturers worldwide. From a total Alpine production of 1421 in 1972, the numbers of cars sold dropped to 957 in 1974 and the company was bailed out via a takeover by Renault. Alpine&#x27;s problems had been compounded by the need for them to develop a replacement for the A110, and launch the car alongside drastically increasing European petrol prices.
Through the 1970s, Alpine continued to campaign the A110, and later the Alpine A310 replacement car. However, to compete with Alpine&#x27;s success, other manufacturers developed increasingly special cars, notably the Lancia Stratos which was based closely on the A110&#x27;s size and rear-engined concept, though incorporating a Ferrari engine. Alpine&#x27;s own cars, still based on the 1962 design and using a surprising number of production parts, became increasingly uncompetitive. In 1974 Alpine built a series of factory racing Renault 17 Gordinis (one driven by Jean-Luc Thérier) that won the Press on Regardless World Rally Championship round in Michigan, US.

Having achieved the rally championship, and with Renault money now fully behind them, Alpine had set their sights on a new target. The next aim was to win at Le Mans. Renault had also taken over the Gordini tuning firm and merged the two to form Renault Sport. A number of increasingly successful sports racing cars appeared, culminating in the 1978 Le Mans win with the Renault Alpine A442B. This was fitted with a turbo-charged engine; Alpine had been the first company to run in and win an international rally with a turbo car as far back as 1972, when Thérier took a specially modified A110 to victory on the &quot;Critérium des Cévennes&quot;.

1971 also saw Alpine begin construction of open-wheel racing cars. Initially in Formula Three, they were building Formula Two cars within a year as well. However, without a competitive Renault Formula Two engine available, the F2 cars could neither be known as Renaults nor Alpines while powered by Ford-Cosworth and BMW engines and were labelled Elf 2 and later Elf 2J. A Renault 2.0 litre engine arrived in time for Jean-Pierre Jabouille to win the European Formula 2 Championship in 1976. By this time, Alpine with Jabouille driving had built a Formula One car as a testing mule which lead directly to their entry into the Formula One World Championship in 1977. A second European Formula 2 championship followed with René Arnoux in 1977 with the customer Martini team, before Alpine sold the F2 operation to Willi Kauhsen to concentrate on the Le Mans and Formula One programs.

=== 1980s ===
Alpine Renault continued to develop their range of models all through the 1980s. The A310 was the next modern interpretation of the A110. The Alpine A310 was a sports car with a rear-mounted engine and was initially powered by a four-cylinder 1.6 L sourced Renault 17 TS/Gordini engine. In 1976 the A310 was restyled by Robert Opron and fitted with the more powerful and newly developed V6 PRV engine. The 2.6 L motor was modified by Alpine with a four-speed manual gearbox. Later they would use a Five-speed manual gearbox and with the group 4 model get a higher tune with more cubic capacity and 3 twin barrel Weber carburetors.

After the A310, Alpine transformed into the new Renault Alpine GTA range, produced from plastic and polyester components, commencing with normally aspirated PRV V6 engines. In 1985 the V6 turbo was introduced to complete the range. This car was faster and more powerful than the normally aspirated version. In 1986 polyester parts were cut for the first time by robot using a high pressure (3500 bar) water jet, in diameter at three times the speed of sound. In the same year the American specification V6 turbo was developed.

In 1987 the installation of anti-pollution systems allowed the V6 turbo to be distributed to Switzerland, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. 1989 saw the launch of the limited edition GTA &quot;Mille Miles&quot; to celebrate Alpine&#x27;s 35th anniversary. Production was limited to 100 cars, all fitted with ABS braking, polished wheels, special leather interior and paintwork. This version was not available in right hand drive.

=== 1990s ===
1990 saw the launch of the special edition wide-bodied GTA &quot;Le Mans&quot;. Otherwise mechanically identical to the V6 Turbo, the engine was fitted with a catalytic converter and power was reduced to . This model was available in the UK and right hand drive versions carried a numbered plaque on the dashboard. The Le Mans is the most collectable and valuable GTA derivative, since only 325 were made (299 LHD and 26 RHD). These were available from Renault dealers in the UK, and the country&#x27;s motoring press are belatedly recognising the GTA series as the &#x27;great unsung supercar of the 1980s&#x27;.

The Alpine A610 was launched in 1991. It was re-styled inside and out but was still recognisable as a GTA derivative. The chassis structure was extensively reworked but the central box principal remained the same. The front was completely re-designed the interior was also greatly improved. Air-conditioning and power steering were fitted as standard. The total production run for A610s derivatives was 818 vehicles 67 right hand drive and 751 left hand drive. After production of the A610 ended, the Alpine factory in Dieppe produced the Renault Sport Spider and a new era was to begin.

The last Alpine, an A610, rolled off the Dieppe line on 7 April 1995, with Renault abandoning the Alpine name. This was always a problem in the UK market. Alpines could not be sold in the UK under their own name because Sunbeam owned the trade mark (because of the mid-50s Sunbeam Alpine Mk I). In the 1970s, for example, Dieppe were building modified Renault 5s for the worldwide market. The rest of the world knew them as R5 Alpines but in the UK they had to be renamed to R5 Gordini. After numerous company takeovers, the multinational Stellantis own the British &quot;Alpine&quot; trademark as of January 2021.

The Alpine factory in Dieppe continued to expand; in the 1980s they built the special R5 Turbo cars, following the rear engine formula they had always used. They built all Clio Williams and RenaultSport Spiders. The factory put its Alpine badges on the early batches of the mid-engine Clio series one Clio V6. The Clio Series 2 was also assembled there with more recent RenaultSport Clio 172 and RenaultSport Clio 182s.

Between 1989 and 1995, a projected new Alpine named the A710 &quot;Berlinette 2&quot;, was designed and two prototypes were built. The A710 used the 2-litre, 150 horsepower engine from the Renault Clio Williams mounted in an aluminium chassis. Renault&#x27;s marketing department stated that the car would need to be less basic and include more modern features such as electric windows and air conditioning. Subsequently, the project was deemed too costly (600 million francs), and as adding more modern equipment and interior would compromise the price and performances, the project was cancelled. Despite its cancellation, the engine and aluminium chassis from the A710 were later used on the Renault Sport Spider.

In 1999, Renault partnered with Lotus to develop the Z11 Berlinette, an art-deco design study investigating the return of the Alpine brand. The car was scheduled to be revealed at the 2001 Geneva Motor Show alongside the Koleos concept (codenamed Z10) and the Talisman concept (Z12), but the project was ultimately shelved and the Z11 was not shown.

=== 21st century: relaunch of the Alpine marque ===

In 2005, Renault was reportedly developing a new Alpine car, codenamed project W16. The concept was a small, mid engine 2+2 SUV based around the design of the Renault Wind concept car. The project never came to fruition.

In October 2007, Renault&#x27;s marketing boss Patrick Blain revealed there were plans for several sports cars in Renault&#x27;s future line up, but stressed that the first model would not arrive until after 2010. Blain confirmed that Renault was unlikely to use a new name for its future sports car and would probably use the Alpine name to brand it. Blain described it as being a &quot;radical sports car&quot; and not just a sports version of a regular model. The new Alpine sports car was to have a version of the Premium Midship platform from the Nissan 350Z and would be classed to compete with the Mazda MX-5. In February 2009, Renault confirmed that plans to revive the Alpine brand had been frozen as a direct result of the 2008–2009 global financial crisis and recession.

It was later revealed that Renault had been working on a prototype around 2007, named the Renault W19. The car featured many design cues from the A110 of the 1960s and was based around the drivetrain and chassis of the Nissan 350Z. The project was later cancelled, speculated to be due in part to the arrival of the Nissan GT-R, alongside the global financial crisis of 2008. The 2017 Alpine A110 heavily resembles this concept, however, despite featuring a mid engine layout.

In France, there is a large network of Alpine enthusiasts clubs. Clubs exist in many countries including the UK, USA, Australia, and Japan.
In March 2012 Renault bought the Alpine name to use in the UK. In May 2012, images of a new Renault Alpine concept titled as Renault Alpine A110-50 were leaked prior to its debut in Monaco. Its styling was based on the Renault DeZir presented in 2010.
In November 2012, Renault and Caterham Cars announced the purchasing by the latter of a 50% stake in the Renault&#x27;s wholly owned subsidiary Société des Automobiles Alpine to create a joint venture (Société des Automobiles Alpine Caterham or SAAC) owned equally by both parts, with the aim of developing affordable sport cars under the Alpine (for Renault) and Caterham (for Caterham Cars) brands, which would be available in 2016. In this partnership, Caterham acquired 50% ownership of the Renault&#x27;s Dieppe assembly plant assets. On 10 June 2014, Renault announced it would be repurchasing the stake from Caterham Cars in SAAC, renaming it Société des Automobiles Alpine. During 2015, two new Alpine concepts were introduced: the Alpine Celebration, unveiled at the Le Mans race weekend, and the CGI-created Alpine Vision Gran Turismo. In February 2016, at an event held in Monte Carlo, Groupe Renault&#x27;s chief Carlos Ghosn unveiled the Alpine Vision showcar (a model close to the planned production Alpine) and announced a 2017 relaunch for the Alpine brand. The Vision was later presented at the 86th Geneva Motor Show by Alpine.
The production version reused the A110 name and the first official pictures were revealed on 28 February 2017 prior to the unveiling at the 87th Geneva Motor show.

On 10 December 2020, Alpine and MV Agusta announced that they would make a special edition of the MV Agusta Superveloce influenced by the Alpine A110 called the Superveloce 800 Alpine, there would be approximately 110 models made.

In January 2021, Alpine said it would absorb the Renault Sport entities (Renault Sport Cars and Renault Sport Racing), merging them with the existing Alpine operations to form a new Alpine business unit. The company also said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Lotus Cars to co-develop an electric successor for the A110. In May 2021, Les Ulis-based Renault Sport Cars was officially renamed Alpine Cars and turned into the main development hub for Alpine as well as the whole Renault group sports cars.

In mid-2023, Alpine announced its plans for global expansion, including entering the U.S. market by 2027. The brand will introduce a mid-size electric crossover and a large electric SUV as the first vehicles in its North American lineup. Discussions have been initiated with AutoNation to establish a dealership network in the country, with these new electric vehicles being developed specifically to meet the preferences of American consumers.

==Operations==
===Dieppe plant===
The first assembly plant for Alpine was at a small workshop owned by Rédélé on the Pasteur avenue in Dieppe. In 1969, to cope with increasing demand, the assembly was moved to a larger facility on de Bréauté avenue, its present location.

The Dieppe plant has 3.8 hectares of covered buildings. , it had 386 employees.

The plant is semi-automatised, with high worker input (before the launch of the 2017 A110, vehicles were almost completely hand-built) and focused on low-volume, high quality assembly. It can produce an average of 15 A110s per day. The plant press neither steel nor aluminium (the A110s are mostly built on prefabricated alloy panels). The plant has not a welding section, as the A110 chassis and bodywork are riveted and glued on a special assembly line and moved to a low-temperature coating plant (able to paint both the alloy and plastic elements) and then to a sanding robot (to remove imperfections) and wiping robot (to clean the vehicle). Final assembly is made on a single line, with logistics teams preparing beforehand the vehicle&#x27;s components to travel along the line with it. Cockpits are assembled and put on by the side and pre-assembled powertrains are put on the rear. Apart from low-volume cars, the Dieppe plant also assembles racing cars (as the Clio Rally4, a rallying car based on the fifth-generation Renault Clio), co-develops racing cars, produces and sells parts for racing cars, and tunes engines.

From the late 1970s, Alpine&#x27;s Dieppe plant produced Renault Sport models and, after the discontinuation of the Alpine brand in 1995, it became its main focus. Renault Sport models produced over time by Alpine include: Renault 5 Turbo, Renault Sport Spider, Clio Renault Sport, Mégane Renault Sport. The last Renault Sport model produced by Dieppe aimed at the mainstream market was the fourth-generation Clio Renault Sport, which was put out of production at the site in 2018. Between 2015 and 2016, the plant also assembled the Bolloré Bluecar.

===Alpine Racing===

Alpine Racing is the Alpine&#x27;s motorsport division. It is made up of the Alpine subsidiaries Alpine Racing Limited (an Enstone-based operation) and Alpine Racing SAS (Viry-Châtillon) mainly for running the company Formula One programme and a partnership with Signatech for other programmes.

The Alpine competition department had various racing programmes from the early 1960s onwards. At the end of 1976, the department was merged with Gordini to form Renault Sport. Some Alpine racing activities continued after that, including a 1978 Le Mans 24 overall victory with the Renault Alpine A442, partnering its parent Renault.

In 2013, as part of the promotional activities for the launching of Alpine roadcars, Alpine partnered with Signatech to enter a Nissan-powered, Oreca-built prototype into the European Le Mans Series championship&#x27;s LMP2 class, re-establishing Alpine-badged racing activities. Signatech-Alpine won the team championship. They returned for the 2014 season. In 2015, the Signatech-Alpine combination entered into the World Endurance Championship (WEC)&#x27;s LMP2 class, achieving the 2016 and 2019-2020 championships and winning three Le Mans 24 races. Through its partnership with Signatech, Alpine also launched GT4&#x27;s touring car and rallying programmes for its A110.

In September 2020, Groupe Renault announced it would rename its existing Formula One team as Alpine F1 Team, while Renault would remain as the engine marque. In January 2021, the Alpine company said it would absorb all existing Renault Sport racing activities besides Formula One.

In March 2021, Alpine presented the Alpine Endurance Team, a WEC&#x27;s top class team managed by Signatech and using a &quot;grandfathered&quot; Rebellion R13. In October 2021, Alpine said it would enter two WEC prototypes built on the LMDh rules from 2024 onwards, with the running side managed again by Signatech. Oreca was announced as the chassis main developer and builder (assisted by Alpine Racing&#x27;s Enstone operation) and the engine development side would be carried out by Alpine Racing&#x27;s Viry-Châtillon base.

==Alpines outside France==

=== Brazil ===
The Alpine 108 was produced in Brazil from 1962 to 1966, under license by Willys-Overland do Brasil, branded &quot;Willys Interlagos&quot;. It was the first Brazilian sports car.

<text>Bad English was an American/British hard rock supergroup formed in 1987. It reunited Journey keyboardist Jonathan Cain with singer John Waite and bassist Ricky Phillips, his former bandmates in the Babys, along with Journey guitarist Neal Schon and drummer Deen Castronovo. The band is known for their hit single &quot;When I See You Smile&quot;, which peaked at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in November 1989.

== History ==
The members decided on a name for the band while playing pool. John Waite missed a shot and Jonathan Cain made a comment on how bad his &quot;&quot; was (referring to the spin a player puts on the cue ball), and the band decided to use the phrase.

Jonathan Cain and guitarist Neal Schon, members of the successful rock band Journey, formed Bad English with Waite after Journey disbanded. They were joined by Ricky Phillips, who had played bass for the Babys on two albums with Waite and Cain, and drummer Deen Castronovo.

=== First album ===
The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Bad English&quot;, was a big seller. It contained three top-40 hit singles: the number one hit &quot;When I See You Smile&quot;, the top 10 hit &quot;Price of Love&quot;, and &quot;Possession&quot;.

The album&#x27;s first single, however, was &quot;Forget Me Not&quot;. It stalled outside the top 40 at number 45, but the single peaked at number 2 on the Mainstream Rock chart. The second single, &quot;When I See You Smile&quot;, was their biggest hit, peaking at number 1 on the Hot 100. The song is also notable for being one of only two songs (the other being &quot;Don&#x27;t Walk Away&quot;) to be entirely written by an outside writer without help from at least one member of the band. &quot;Best of What I Got&quot; was released as a promotional single to Rock Radio, where the tune cracked the top 10.

From March to June 1990, the band toured across the US with Whitesnake in support of the album.

=== Second album ===
The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Backlash&quot;, came and went without any fanfare. The only single, &quot;Straight to Your Heart&quot;, missed the top 40, peaking at number 42. Ricky Phillips writes on his website that the group had parted company before the second album had been mixed. Both Phillips and guitarist Neal Schon expressed frustration with the &quot;pop&quot; side of the band&#x27;s music and wanted a harder edge. In the end, it proved to be the band&#x27;s undoing as everyone left to pursue other projects.

=== Breakup ===
In later interviews, Waite revealed that although he loved playing to stadium-sized audiences, he was uncomfortable with the corporate rock image that he felt the band had presented. He returned to working as a solo artist. Schon and Castronovo joined the fledgling rock band Hardline in 1991; however, both would leave the group not long after the release of its debut album, with Schon pursuing other projects and Castronovo joining Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s band. In the mid-1990s, Schon rejoined Cain, who had released two solo albums in the interim, in a reformed Journey. Castronovo also joined Journey in 1998, eventually leaving in 2015. He later became a member of the Dead Daisies and Revolution Saints before returning to Journey in 2021. Meanwhile, Phillips returned to session work, recording with artists such as Coverdale/Page, Bobby Kimball and Eddie Money before joining Styx in the early 2000s.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Best of What I Got&quot;, from the band&#x27;s first album, is featured during the credits to the 1989 movie &quot;Tango &amp; Cash&quot; starring Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell.

== Band members ==
* John Waite – lead vocals, rhythm guitar
* Neal Schon – lead guitar, backing vocals
* Jonathan Cain – keyboards, piano, rhythm guitar, backing vocals
* Ricky Phillips – bass, backing vocals
* Deen Castronovo – drums, percussion, backing vocals

<text>Charles Deutsch (1911–1980) was a French aerodynamics engineer and automobile maker, founder of the brand &quot;DB&quot; with René Bonnet, and later of the &quot;CD&quot;.

==Early history==
Deutsch was born at Champigny-sur-Marne on 6 September 1911. His father was a cartwright who had also expanded into manufacturing automobile bodies on a small scale in the early 1900s. The young Deutsch proceeded to learn his father&#x27;s business from the ground up, a knowledge set complemented by a degree from the prestigious École Polytechnique. Deutsch senior died in 1929, leaving the eighteen-year-old Charles in charge of the business while also pursuing his studies. This proved unfeasible, and in 1932 he sold the business to a René Bonnet, while continuing to live upstairs and maintaining a day-to-day involvement in the &quot;charronnerie-carrosserie&quot;.

Charles Deutsch himself states that he was only fourteen when he designed his first car, which was built in his father&#x27;s shop. After a promised ride for Bonnet in the 1936 French Grand Prix failed to materialize, Deutsch and Bonnet proceeded to design their own car - using Citroën parts - which they competed with some success. This was D.B. 1, which gave rise to the DB company which lasted until 1961. After the breakup of the company, Deutsch proceeded to build a small number of lightweight, aerodynamic, front-wheel drive sports cars under the CD (sometimes referred to as CD-Panhard, since they depended on Panhard engines). Together with Jean Bertin, Deutsch also worked on solving the Facellia&#x27;s cooling problems as well as on a more powerful twin-carburetted version.

In 1935 Deutsch began working for the &quot;Ponts et Chaussées&quot;, the French highway and bridge authority. He continued working full-time as a civil engineer, becoming chief engineer in 1951, while also running a competition car company and raising a family. In 1966 Deutsch retired from the &quot;Ponts et Chaussées&quot; and proceeded to dedicate his entire time to his engineering firm.

==Career==

Educated at the École Polytechnique, Deutsch was a pioneer in the field of aerodynamics, and founded the Sera-CD vehicle engineering Research and Development Company (Société d’Etudes et de Réalisations Automobiles - Charles Deutsch). He used the ground-effect on race cars ten years before Chaparral and his #53 entry from &quot;Automobiles Deutsch et Bonnet&quot; won the &quot;Index of Performance&quot; trophy at the 1961 24 Hours of Le Mans. The Alpine M64 which won the Index of Thermal Performance at the 1964 Le Mans also had bodywork designed by Deutsch.

Deutsch served as President of the Société des ingénieurs de l&#x27;automobile from 1971 until 1975, followed by holding the presidency of FISITA, the International Federation of Automotive Engineering Societies, until 1978. He was also the director of the 24 Hours of Le Mans (from 1969 until 1980) and of the Grand Prix of Monaco. French aerodynamics engineer Robert Choulet (École Centrale Paris) is Deutsch&#x27;s most famous disciple.

Although Deutsch died in 1980, Sera-CD continues research and development to this day, from light to heavy vehicles using conventional and hybrid propulsion technology. On 23 April 2007 it was acquired by Sogeclair.

<doc id="162415" wikidata="Q81066" url="?curid=162415" title="Secretary-General of the United Nations">
<text>The secretary-general of the United Nations (UNSG or UNSECGEN) is the chief administrative officer of the United Nations and head of the United Nations Secretariat, one of the six principal organs of the United Nations.

The role of the secretary-general and of the secretariat is laid out by Chapter XV (Articles 97 to 101) of the United Nations Charter. However, the office&#x27;s qualifications, selection process and tenure are open to interpretation; they have been established by custom.

==Selection and term of office==

The secretary-general is appointed by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council. As the recommendation must come from the Security Council, any of the five permanent members of the council can veto a nomination. Most secretaries-general are compromise candidates from middle powers and have little prior fame.

Unofficial qualifications for the job have been set by precedent in previous selections. The appointee may not be a citizen of any of the Security Council&#x27;s five permanent members. The General Assembly resolution 51/241 in 1997 stated that, in the appointment of &quot;the best candidate&quot;, due regard should be given to regional (continental) rotation of the appointee&#x27;s national origin and to gender equality, although no woman has yet served as secretary-general. All appointees to date have been career diplomats.

The length of the term is discretionary, but all secretaries-general since 1971 have been appointed to five-year terms. Every secretary-general since 1961 has been re-selected for a second term, with the exception of Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who was vetoed by the United States in the 1996 selection. While the position does not have a formal term limit, incumbent secretary-generals have avoided seeking a third term since the 1981 selection, when China cast a record 16 vetoes against a third term for Kurt Waldheim.

The selection process is opaque and is often compared to a papal conclave. Since 1981, the Security Council has voted in secret in a series of straw polls; it then submits the winning candidate to the General Assembly for ratification. No candidate has ever been rejected by the General Assembly, and only once, in 1950, has a candidate been voted upon despite a UNSC veto.

In 2016, the General Assembly and the Security Council sought nominations and conducted public debates for the first time. However, the Security Council voted in private and followed the same process as previous selections, leading the president of the General Assembly to complain that it &quot;does not live up to the expectations of the membership and the new standard of openness and transparency&quot;.

==Powers and duties==
The UN Charter designates the secretary-general as the &quot;chief administrative officer&quot; of the UN, and gives the secretary-general the power to make employment decisions about Secretariat staff. The Charter also empowers the secretary-general to inform the Security Council of &quot;any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security&quot;, and allows the secretary-general to perform &quot;such other functions as are entrusted&quot; by other United Nations organs. These provisions have been interpreted as providing broad leeway for officeholders to serve a variety of roles as suited to their preferences, skill set, or circumstances. The UN describes the role of the secretary-general as combining the functions and responsibilities of an advocate, diplomat, civil servant, and chief executive officer.

The secretary-general&#x27;s routine duties include overseeing the activities and duties of the secretariat; attending sessions with United Nations bodies; consulting with world leaders, government officials, and other stakeholders; and travelling the world to engage with global constituents and bring attention to certain international issues. The secretary-general publishes an annual report on the work of the UN, which includes an assessment of its activities and an outline future priorities. The secretary-general is also the chairman of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB), a body composed of the heads of all UN funds, programmes, and specialised agencies, which meets twice a year to discuss substantive and management issues facing the United Nations System.

Many of the secretary-general&#x27;s powers are informal and left open to individual interpretation; some appointees have opted for more activist roles, while others have been more technocratic or administrative. The secretary-general is often reliant upon the use of their &quot;good offices&quot;, described as &quot;steps taken publicly and in private, drawing upon his independence, impartiality and integrity, to prevent international disputes from arising, escalating or spreading&quot;. Consequently, observers have variably described the office as the &quot;world&#x27;s most visible bully pulpit&quot; or as the &quot;world&#x27;s moderator&quot;. Examples include Dag Hammarskjöld&#x27;s promotion of an armistice between the warring parties of Arab-Israel conflict, Javier Perez de Cuellar&#x27;s negotiation of a ceasefire in the Iran-Iraq War, and U Thant&#x27;s role in deescalating the Cuban Missile Crisis.

==Residence==
The official residence of the secretary-general is a townhouse at 3 Sutton Place, Manhattan, in New York City, United States. The townhouse was built for Anne Morgan in 1921 and donated to the United Nations in 1972.

<doc id="162417" wikidata="Q530921" url="?curid=162417" title="Naunton Wayne">
<text>Naunton Wayne (born Henry Wayne Davies, 22 June 1901 – 17 November 1970), was a Welsh character actor, born in Pontypridd, Glamorgan, Wales. He was educated at Clifton College. His name was changed by deed poll in 1933.

==Stage actor==
His first London stage roles were in &quot;Streamline&quot; at the Palace in 1934 and in &quot;1066 and All That&quot; at the Strand in 1935 (where he provided comic continuity for other performers). His first full role was as Norman Weldon in &quot;Wise Tomorrow&quot; at The Lyric in 1937. He played Mortimer Brewster in &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; at the Strand for four years. He was a leading member of The Stage Golfing Society.

In 1949, he starred in Young Wives&#x27; Tale, at the Savoy Theatre.

From November 1956 he appeared in the long-running farce &quot;The Bride and the Bachelor&quot; at the Duchess Theatre.

==Film actor==
He became best known for his role as a supporting character, Caldicott, in the 1938 film version of &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot;, a role he repeated in three further films, alongside Basil Radford as his equally cricket-obsessed friend, Charters. The two would go on to appear in other films together, often playing similar characters. Their other joint credits include &quot;Night Train to Munich&quot; (1940), &quot;Crook&#x27;s Tour&quot; (1941), &quot;Millions Like Us&quot; (1943), &quot;Dead of Night&quot; (1945), &quot;Quartet&quot; (1948), &quot;It&#x27;s Not Cricket&quot; (1949), and &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; (1949).

Wayne also appeared alone in other films including the Ealing comedy &quot;The Titfield Thunderbolt&quot; (1953) and &quot;Obsession&quot; (1949).

==Personal life==
Wayne married Gladys Dove, a concert pianist, in 1927 and they had two sons, Peter and John.

==Death==
Wayne died in Tolworth, in the county of Surrey on 17 November 1970, at the age of 69.

<doc id="162418" wikidata="Q3401584" url="?curid=162418" title="Simon Weston">
<text>Simon Weston (born 8 August 1961) is a Welsh veteran of the British Army who is known for his charity work and recovery from severe burn injuries suffered during the Falklands War.

==Early life==
Weston was born at Caerphilly District Miners Hospital in Caerphilly. He was brought up by his mother, Pauline and adoptive father, &quot;Lofty&quot;. His biological father David Weston served in the Royal Air Force alongside his mother. Simon lived in Singapore and at RAF Hospital Nocton Hall in Lincolnshire before returning to Nelson at the age of around six or seven. He has one elder sister, Helen, and three stepbrothers. At the age of 14, Weston was given a police caution when he was caught as a passenger in a car stolen by his older friends.

He joined the Welsh Guards in 1978 at the age of 16 at the insistence of his
mother, after he &quot;got into bother&quot;. He served in Berlin, Northern Ireland and Kenya before being deployed to the Falkland Islands.

==Falklands War==
On 8 June 1982, Weston was embarked with other members of his regiment in in Port Pleasant near Fitzroy, just off the Falkland Islands. &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; was bombed and set on fire by Argentine Skyhawk fighters during the Bluff Cove Air Attacks. The ship was carrying ammunition as well as phosphorus bombs and thousands of gallons of diesel and petrol. Out of his platoon of 30 men, 22 were killed. The Welsh Guards lost a total of 48 men killed and 97 wounded aboard the &quot;Sir Galahad&quot;.

Weston survived with 46% burns, following which his face was barely recognisable: He said:
==Recovery==
Weston endured years of reconstructive surgery, including over 96 major operations or surgical procedures. Skin from his shoulders was used to make eyelids, and skin grafts also repaired healing contraction to his nose. He suffered psychological trauma, drinking heavily and becoming suicidal, and admits his behaviour during this time was &quot;terrible&quot;. He credits his mother with helping him to overcome this, in particular her act of reuniting him with his old regiment. The men of his regiment refused to mollycoddle him (especially Glen White, who ran the Welsh Guards rugby side), which forced him to &quot;face up to the unavoidable and to be positive about everything including especially my future&quot;.

==Television and media==
Weston has made regular contributions to radio programmes and appeared on television, especially within Wales. He has been the subject of several BBC documentaries and presented his own radio show &quot;Face for the Radio&quot; for BBC Radio Wales. He has been interviewed on many occasions for television news programmes and documentaries recounting his experiences, including appearances on 14 June 2007, the 25th anniversary of the Falklands War ending. He has also appeared on programmes such as &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; (appearing on 7 February 1990; aged still only 28, Weston was one of the show&#x27;s youngest-ever guests) and later &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; He was featured in a £7 million advertising campaign launched in 2000 aimed at boosting recruitment into the police force.

He has written best-selling autobiographies as well as a series of novels. In 2003 he announced that he had been in talks over plans to make a film about his life.

==Charity work==
In 1986, Weston undertook his first goodwill tour, to Australia, at the request of the Guards Association of Australasia. The resulting donations to children&#x27;s burns units made him begin to feel useful again.

Weston became patron of a number of charities that support people living with disfigurements. He is the Lead Ambassador for medical research charity, The Scar Free Foundation, which funds research into scar free healing. He also set up a national youth charity, Weston Spirit, in 1988 with Paul Oginsky and Ben Harrison, shortly after moving to Liverpool. However, in 2008, the charity suffered from financial difficulties and had to be shut down.

Weston is also a patron of the LMS-Patriot Project. The Project is constructing a new replica LMS Patriot Class steam locomotive, number 5551 The Unknown Warrior. On 10 November 2018 in a ceremony at Crewe Heritage Centre he unveiled the locomotives new crest which would be carried above the locomotives nameplates (the previous one being the Royal British Legion crest which the RBL later asked to be removed from the engine).

==Political activism==
Weston has campaigned in support of troops and veterans and against politicians&#x27; alleged failure to support them adequately. He has spoken out against defence budget cuts and British troops allegedly being supplied with inadequate equipment, and about the lack of support, health care and adequate compensation for veterans. On 12 March 2007 he appeared on ITV News, giving his opinion on the care of British soldiers in hospital. On 4 March 2008, he appeared alongside Conservative leader David Cameron as he announced the formation of a commission to investigate ways to help restore the &quot;military covenant&quot;, which Cameron called &quot;well and truly broken&quot;. It was intended that Weston would take a non-partisan, advisory role to the commission (headed by Frederick Forsyth), with his work taking a particular focus to the treatment of veterans and the compensation paid out to injured service personnel.

It is stated that Weston is a critic of the Iraq War, believing Tony Blair&#x27;s arguments for the invasion were invalid. In February 2003, in the run-up to the war, he spoke out about &quot;politicians with so many different agendas, spin and bluff and throwing smoke in the air and I have to say even lies... so often that we are not sure what we are actually listening to now&quot;.

Weston also spoke to the ethical committee at London&#x27;s Royal Free Hospital in 2006 to support the case for authorising full face transplants, even though he had previously been against the idea.

In 2008, Weston criticised the then French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, for failing to attend a war ceremony. Weston said, &quot;He should have got it right&quot;, &quot;We in Wales have lost and sacrificed as much as anybody for different causes&quot;. Showing his support for the British monarchy, Weston added, &quot;Not for a second would Charles have disrespected the event. He has always acted with a great deal of reverence for the occasion.&quot;

In February 2012 Weston was caught up in an angry exchange with actor Sean Penn, who said it was improper for Prince William to be deployed to the Falklands. Weston was reported as saying, &quot;Sean Penn does not know what he is talking about and, frankly, he should shut up. His [Penn&#x27;s] views are irrelevant and it only serves to fuel the fire of the Argentinians and get them more pumped up.&quot;

In 2012, Weston decided to stand for the post of elected Police and Crime Commissioner for the South Wales Police. As part of the nomination process, he had to disclose the police caution he had received as a child and whether this caution disbarred him from standing became a matter of public debate. He withdrew from the process, citing this controversy and the perceived politicisation of the post (some sources hold that a caution for a juvenile should not be grounds for disqualification). During a BBC radio interview on the subject of the disclosure of cautions to juveniles, Weston pointed out that he has never sought to hide the caution.

==Personal life==
Weston is married to Lucy, with whom he has three children: James, Stuart and Caitlin. They met in Liverpool when she was working for his charity, Weston Spirit. They were engaged on 8 June 1989, exactly seven years after the attack on the &quot;Sir Galahad&quot;. They married on 12 May 1990 and now live in Cardiff.

Weston has met and become friends with First Lieutenant Carlos Cachon, the Argentine pilot who dropped the bomb which caused his injuries. He was criticised for this by families of those who fought in the Falklands War, which he dismissed by saying &quot;I don&#x27;t have a problem with other people criticising me for things I do, as long as people understand why I did them. Then I don&#x27;t have a problem to walk away and say &#x27;you&#x27;re entitled to your opinions&#x27;.&quot;

<text>John Wilkes (17 October 1725 – 26 December 1797) was an English radical journalist and politician, as well as a magistrate, essayist and soldier. He was first elected a Member of Parliament in 1757. In the Middlesex election dispute, he fought for the right of his votersrather than the House of Commonsto determine their representatives. In 1768, angry protests of his supporters were suppressed in the Massacre of St George&#x27;s Fields. In 1771, he was instrumental in obliging the government to concede the right of printers to publish accounts of parliamentary debates. In 1776, he introduced the first bill for parliamentary reform in the British Parliament.

During the American War of Independence, he was a supporter of the rebels, adding further to his popularity with American Whigs. However, in 1780 he commanded militia forces which helped put down the Gordon Riots, damaging his popularity with many radicals. This marked a turning point, leading him to embrace increasingly conservative policies which caused dissatisfaction among the radical low-to-middle income landowners. This was instrumental in the loss of his Middlesex parliamentary seat in the 1790 general election. At the age of 65, Wilkes retired from politics and took no part in the social reforms following the French Revolution, such as Catholic Emancipation in the 1790s. During his life, he earned a reputation as a libertine.

==Early life and character==
Born in the Clerkenwell neighborhood of central London, John Wilkes was the third child of distiller Israel Wilkes Jr. and Sarah Wilkes, &quot;née&quot; Heaton. His siblings included: eldest sister Sarah Wilkes, born 1721; elder brother Israel Wilkes III (1722–1805); younger brother Heaton Wilkes (1727–1803); younger sister Mary Hayley, &quot;née&quot; Wilkes (1728–1808); and youngest sister Ann Wilkes (1736–1750), who died from smallpox at the age of 14.

John Wilkes was educated initially at an academy in Hertford; this was followed by private tutoring and finally a stint at the University of Leiden in the Dutch Republic. There he met Andrew Baxter, a Presbyterian clergyman who greatly influenced Wilkes&#x27; views on religion. Although Wilkes remained in the Church of England throughout his life, he had a deep sympathy for non-conformist Protestants and was an advocate of religious tolerance from an early age. Wilkes was also beginning to develop a deep patriotism for his country. During the Jacobite rebellion of 1745, he rushed home to London to join a Loyal Association and readied to defend the capital. Once the rebellion had ended after the Battle of Culloden, Wilkes returned to the Netherlands to complete his studies.

In 1747, he married Mary Meade (1715–1784) and came into possession of an estate and income in Buckinghamshire. They had one child, Mary (known as Polly), to whom John was utterly devoted for the rest of his life. Wilkes and Mary, however, separated in 1756, a separation that became permanent. Wilkes never married again, but he gained a reputation as a rake. He was known to have fathered two other children, John Henry Smith and Harriet Wilkes.

Wilkes was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1749 and appointed High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire in 1754. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Berwick in the 1754 parliamentary elections but was elected for Aylesbury in 1757 and again in 1761. Elections took place at St Mary the Virgin&#x27;s Church, Aylesbury where he held a manorial pew. He lived at the Prebendal House, Parsons Fee, Aylesbury.

He was a member of the Knights of St Francis of Wycombe, also known as the Hellfire Club or the &quot;Medmenham Monks&quot;, and was the instigator of a prank that may have hastened its dissolution. The club had many distinguished members, including John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich and Sir Francis Dashwood. Wilkes reportedly brought a mandrill, dressed in a cape and horns and his natural features made even more striking with daubs of phosphorus, into the rituals performed at the club, producing considerable mayhem among the inebriated initiates.

Wilkes was notoriously ugly, being called the ugliest man in England at the time. He possessed an unsightly squint and protruding jaw, but he had a charm that carried all before it. He boasted that it &quot;took him only half an hour to talk away his face&quot;, though the duration required changed on the several occasions Wilkes repeated the claim. He also declared that &quot;a month&#x27;s start of his rival on account of his face&quot; would secure him the conquest in any love affair.

He was well known for his verbal wit and his snappy responses to insults. For instance, when told by a constituent that he would rather vote for the devil, Wilkes responded: &quot;Naturally.&quot; He then added: &quot;And if your friend decides against standing, can I count on your vote?&quot;

In an exchange with John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, where the latter exclaimed, &quot;Sir, I do not know whether you will die on the gallows or of the pox,&quot; Wilkes is reported to have replied, &quot;That depends, my lord, on whether I embrace your lordship&#x27;s principles or your mistress.&quot; Fred R. Shapiro, in &quot;The Yale Book of Quotations&quot; (2006), disputes the attribution based on a claim that it first appeared in a book published in 1935, but it is ascribed to Wilkes in Henry Brougham&#x27;s &quot;Historical Sketches&quot; (1844), related from Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk, who claims to have been present, as well as in Charles Marsh&#x27;s &quot;Clubs of London&quot; (1828). Brougham notes the exchange had in France previously been ascribed to Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau and Cardinal Jean-Sifrein Maury.

==Radical journalism==

Wilkes began his parliamentary career as a follower of William Pitt the Elder and enthusiastically supported Britain&#x27;s involvement in the Seven Years War of 1756–1763. When the Scottish John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, came to head the government in 1762, Wilkes started a radical weekly publication, &quot;The North Briton&quot;, to attack him, using an anti-Scots tone. Typical of Wilkes, the title made satirical reference to the pro-government newspaper, &quot;The Briton&quot;, with &quot;North Briton&quot; referring to Scotland. Wilkes became particularly incensed by what he regarded as Bute&#x27;s betrayal in agreeing to overly generous peace terms with France to end the war.

On 5 October 1762, Wilkes fought a duel with William Talbot, 1st Earl Talbot. Talbot was the Lord Steward and a follower of Bute; he challenged Wilkes to a pistol duel after being ridiculed in issue 12 of &quot;The North Briton&quot;. The encounter took place at Bagshot – at night to avoid attracting judicial attention. At a range of eight yards, Talbot and Wilkes both fired their pistols but neither was hit. Somewhat reconciled, they then went to a nearby inn and shared a bottle of claret. When the affair later became widely known, some viewed it as comical, and a satirical print made fun of the duelists. Some commentators even denounced the duel as a stunt, stage-managed to enhance the reputations of both men.

Wilkes faced a charge of seditious libel over attacks on George III&#x27;s speech endorsing the Paris Peace Treaty of 1763 at the opening of Parliament on 23 April 1763. Wilkes was highly critical of the King&#x27;s speech, which was recognised as having been written by Bute . He attacked it in an article of issue 45 of &quot;The North Briton&quot;. The issue number in which Wilkes published his critical editorial was appropriate because the number 45 was synonymous with the Jacobite Rising of 1745, commonly known as &quot;The &#x27;45&quot;. Popular perception associated Bute – Scottish, and politically controversial as an adviser to the King – with Jacobitism, a perception which Wilkes played on.

The King felt personally insulted and ordered the issuing of general warrants for the arrest of Wilkes and the publishers on 30 April 1763. Forty-nine people, including Wilkes, were arrested, but general warrants were unpopular and Wilkes gained considerable popular support as he asserted their unconstitutionality. At his court hearing he claimed that parliamentary privilege protected him, as an MP, from arrest on a charge of libel. Chief Justice Pratt ruled that parliamentary privilege did indeed protect him and he was soon restored to his seat. Wilkes sued his arresters for trespass. As a result of this episode, people were chanting, &quot;Wilkes, Liberty and Number 45&quot;, referring to the newspaper. Parliament swiftly voted in a measure that removed protection of MPs from arrest for the writing and publishing of seditious libel.

Bute had resigned (8 April 1763), but Wilkes opposed Bute&#x27;s successor as chief advisor to the King, George Grenville, just as strenuously. On 16 November 1763, Samuel Martin, a supporter of George III, challenged Wilkes to a duel. Martin shot Wilkes in the belly.

==Outlaw==

Wilkes and Thomas Potter wrote a pornographic poem dedicated to the courtesan Fanny Murray entitled &quot;An Essay on Woman&quot; as a parody of Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;An Essay on Man&quot;.

Wilkes&#x27;s political enemies, foremost among them John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, who was also a member of the Hellfire Club, obtained the parody. Sandwich had a personal vendetta against Wilkes that stemmed in large part from embarrassment caused by a prank of Wilkes involving the Earl at one of the Hellfire Club&#x27;s meetings; he was delighted at the chance for revenge. Wilkes had frightened Sandwich during a seance put on by the club. Sandwich read the poem to the House of Lords in an effort to denounce Wilkes&#x27;s moral behaviour, despite the hypocrisy of his action. The Lords declared the poem obscene and blasphemous, and it caused a great scandal. The House of Lords moved to expel Wilkes again; he fled to Paris before any expulsion or trial. He was tried and found guilty &quot;in absentia&quot; of obscene libel and seditious libel, and was declared an outlaw on 19 January 1764.

Wilkes hoped for a change in power to remove the charges, but this did not come to pass. As his French creditors began to pressure him, in 1768 he had little choice but to return to England. He returned intending to stand as a Member of Parliament on an anti-government ticket; the government did not issue warrants for his immediate arrest as it did not want to inflame popular support.

Wilkes stood in the City of London and came in bottom of the poll of seven candidates, possibly due to his late entry into the race for the position. He was quickly elected as a Radical Member of Parliament for Middlesex, where most of his support was located. He surrendered himself to the King&#x27;s Bench in April. On waiving his parliamentary privilege to immunity, he was sentenced by Judge Joseph Yates to two years and fined £1,000; the Lords&#x27; sentence of outlawry was overturned.

When Wilkes was imprisoned in the King&#x27;s Bench Prison on 10 May 1768, his supporters gathered nearby on St George&#x27;s Fields, London, chanting &quot;No liberty, no King.&quot; Troops opened fire on the unarmed men, killing several of them and wounding fifteen, an incident that came to be known as the Massacre of St George&#x27;s Fields. The Irish playwright Hugh Kelly, a prominent supporter of the government, defended the right of the army to use force against rioters, which drew the anger of Wilkes&#x27; supporters and they began a riot at the Drury Lane Theatre during the performance of Kelly&#x27;s new play &quot;A Word to the Wise&quot;, forcing it to be abandoned.

==Middlesex election dispute==
Parliament expelled Wilkes in February 1769, on the grounds that he was an outlaw when returned. His Middlesex constituents re-elected him in the same month with the support of John Wheble, editor of the &quot;Middlesex Journal&quot;, only to see him expelled again and re-elected in March. In April, after his expulsion and another re-election, Parliament declared his opponent, Henry Luttrell, the winner.

Wilkes was said to hold his supporters in contempt during the election campaign. EP Thompson, in his celebrated 1963 text &quot;The Making of the English Working Class&quot; wrote: “‘Do you suppose’ it is said that he asked his opponent, Colonel Luttrell, while watching the cheering throngs on the hustings, ‘that there are more fools or rogues in that assembly?’”

In defiance, Wilkes became an Alderman of London in 1769, using his supporters&#x27; group, the Society for the Supporters of the Bill of Rights,
for his campaign. Wilkes eventually succeeded in convincing Parliament to expunge the resolution barring him from sitting. While in Parliament, he condemned Government policy towards the American colonies. In addition, he introduced one of the earliest radical Bills to Parliament, although it failed to gain passage. On his release from prison in March 1770, Wilkes was appointed a sheriff in London, and in 1771 the law on publicity of the parliamentary discussions was voted in Parliament, of which Wilkes was a great defender and who authorised the literal reproduction of the interventions of the Parliament.

==Later life==

In 1774 he became Lord Mayor of London; he was simultaneously Master of the Joiners&#x27; Company, where he changed the motto from &quot;GOD GRANNTE US TO USE JUSTICE WITHE MERCYE&quot; to &quot;JOIN LOYALTY AND LIBERTY&quot;, a political slogan associated with Wilkes. That year Wilkes was re-elected to Parliament, again representing Middlesex. He was one of those opposed to war with the American colonies. He was also a supporter of the Association Movement and of religious tolerance. His key success was to protect the freedom of the press by gaining passage of a bill to remove the power of general warrants and to end Parliament&#x27;s ability to punish political reports of debates. In 1779 he was elected to the position of Chamberlain of the City of London, a post of great responsibility which he was to hold until his death in 1797.

After 1780, his popularity declined as he was popularly perceived as less radical. During the uprising known as the Gordon Riots, Wilkes was in charge of the soldiers defending the Bank of England from the attacking mobs. It was under his orders that troops fired into the crowds of rioters. The working classes who had previously seen Wilkes as a &quot;man of the people&quot;, then criticised him as a hypocrite; his middle-class support was scared off by the violent action. The Gordon Riots nearly extinguished his popularity.

While he was returned for the county seat of Middlesex in 1784, he found so little support that by 1790, he withdrew early in the election. The French Revolution of 1789 had proved extremely divisive in England, and Wilkes had been against it due to the violent murders in France. His position was different from that of many radicals of the time and was a view more associated with conservative figures, including expressed indifference as to Catholic Emancipation. Edmund Burke, who had also supported American Independence, made a similar switch.

Wilkes worked in his final years as a magistrate, campaigning for more moderate punishment for disobedient household servants.

Between 1788 and 1797 he occupied a property named &quot;Villakin&quot; in Sandown, Isle of Wight. The site is marked by a blue plaque.
He was a member of the Oddfellows and today, a statue in his memory stands at Fetter Lane EC4.

Wilkes died at his home at 30 Grosvenor Square, Westminster, London on 26 December 1797. The cause of death was a wasting disease known at the time as marasmus. His body was buried in a vault in Grosvenor Chapel, South Audley Street, London on 4 January 1798.

==Influence==
Wilkes was at one point a hero to radicals in Britain and North America, and the slogan &quot;Wilkes and Liberty&quot; was heard on both sides of the Atlantic.

A radical contemporary Irish politician Charles Lucas, who sat for Dublin City in the Irish Parliament, was known as the &quot;Irish Wilkes&quot;. The Dutch politician Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol (1741–1784), who advocated American independence and criticised the &quot;Stadtholder&quot; regime, was inspired by Wilkes.

British colonists in the American colonies closely followed Wilkes&#x27;s career. His struggles convinced many colonists that the British constitution was being subverted by a corrupt ministry, an idea that contributed to the coming of the American Revolution. Wilkes was widely admired in the American colonies as a political journalist, a radical politician, and a fighter for liberty. He greatly influenced the revolutionaries who fought for American independence and played a role in establishing the right to freedom of the press in the United States. In reaction, after the Revolution, representatives included provisions in the new American constitution to prevent Congress from rejecting any legally elected member and to proscribe general warrants for arrest.

John Wilkes&#x27;s brother Israel Wilkes (1722–1805) was the grandfather of U.S. Naval Admiral Charles Wilkes.

<text>Robert Choulet (born 28 February 1935) is a French aerodynamics engineer influential in race car dynamics.

==Career==
A disciple of aerodynamics pioneer Charles Deutsch, Choulet worked for Deutsch&#x27;s Société d&#x27;Études et de Réalisations Automobiles (SERA-CD ) from 1963 to 1967. During this period, he worked on the aerodynamics of the CD cars.

He then joined Matra in 1968. One of his first projects was the Matra M640 Le Mans 24 Hours car. Following that, he returned to SERA-CD and was involved in designing the famous Porsche 917 especially the LH version, and the Can-Am cars that followed. He later was influential in designing the Alfa Romeo 33TT12.

From 1976 to 1980, Choulet worked with the Ligier Formula One team, being involved in the design of the JS5, JS7, JS9, JS11 and JS11/15 models.

SERA and Choulet also worked with the Alfa Romeo sports car team in 1977 and on Alfa&#x27;s Formula One car in 1979.

Choulet created the Aérodyne company in 1983 working on such different cars as Formula Ford Rondeau and Audi Quattro for rally racing. He then worked for many years for Peugeot. He was also influential in the Group C Peugeot 905 programme (notably the Ev1bis and Ev 2 &quot;Supercopter&quot; with radical aerodynamic solutions) as well as for Jordan Formula One team and the rally cars Peugeot 206 and Citroën Xsara WRC.

In the 2000s, he became involved with Panasonic Toyota Racing and has been a consultant for Toyota Motorsport GmbH (TMG) in Cologne since 2011.

Born at Acton Green, London to a working-class family (his father a staunchly left-wing tram driver), Owen made his first film appearance in 1945, but did not achieve lasting fame until 1973, when he took the co-starring role of William &quot;Compo&quot; Simmonite in the long-running British sitcom &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;. Compo is a scruffy working-class pensioner, often exploited by the bossy characters played by Michael Bates, Brian Wilde, Michael Aldridge and Frank Thornton for dirty jobs, stunts and escapades, while their indomitably docile friend Norman Clegg, played by Peter Sallis, follows and watches with a smirk. He wore a woollen hat and spent much of his time lusting after dowdy housewife Nora Batty. The series, starting in 1973 and finishing in 2010, became the world&#x27;s longest-running comedy series. Owen became an icon, a darling of its audience and central to its success and episodes for 26 years, until his death.

Owen served in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps during World War II, where he was injured in an explosion during a battle training course. His first screen role was in the 1941 short &quot;Tank Patrol&quot;, produced by the Ministry of Information.

During the 1960s, Owen had a successful second career as a songwriter, with compositions including the hit &quot;Marianne&quot;, recorded by Cliff Richard. At this time he also collaborated with songwriter Tony Russell on the musical &quot;The Matchgirls&quot; about the London matchgirls strike of 1888. Owen also recorded a novelty song with Kathy Staff in 1983 called &quot;Nora Batty&#x27;s Stockings&quot;.

He was &quot;a spry, dry little gnome of a Ko-Ko&quot; for Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera in their 1962 Christmas season &quot;Mikado&quot;, &quot;skimpering through the piece and playing conventional comic tricks&quot;. He co-starred as Spike Milligan&#x27;s straight man in the West End hit &quot;Son of Oblomov&quot; in 1964.

Owen was a regular in the early &quot;Carry On&quot; films – &quot;Sergeant&quot; (1958), &quot;Nurse&quot; (1959), &quot;Regardless&quot; (1961) and &quot;Cabby&quot; (1963) and also featured in several Lindsay Anderson films including &quot;O Lucky Man!&quot; (1973) and &quot;In Celebration&quot; (1974). On TV had had regular roles playing Fred Cuddell in 13 episodes of &quot;Taxi!&quot; (1963); Sergeant Sam Short in 13 episodes of &quot;Copper&#x27;s End&quot; (1971), George Edwards in 4 episodes of Emergency-Ward 10 and George Chambers (Thelma&#x27;s father) in 4 episodes of Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?. He also had a cameo appearance in &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; as Lunt, Charles Ryder&#x27;s scout during his days at the University of Oxford.

== Personal life ==
Owen was a staunch socialist and supporter of the Labour Party. Peter Sallis described Owen as being &quot;slightly to the left of Lenin&quot; and claimed that Owen&#x27;s left-wing views contrasted so much with the right-wing opinions of Michael Bates that &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; was almost not made because of their arguments. Owen was a founding member of the Keep Sunday Special campaign group, and president of Arts for Labour, a campaign group of performers linked to the Labour Party. He was appointed an MBE in 1977.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1980 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews in Trafalgar Square.
== Illness and death ==
While filming the &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; French special for the millennium of 2000, Owen fell ill but insisted on continuing despite being in pain; when he got back to England, he was confirmed as having pancreatic and bowel cancer.

He continued working right up to his death from pancreatic cancer in Westminster, London, on 12 July 1999. Owen is buried in the churchyard of St John&#x27;s Parish Church, Upperthong, near his beloved town of Holmfirth in Yorkshire, the home of &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;. His co-star Peter Sallis was buried next to him after his death aged 96 in June 2017.

<text>James Henry Miller (25 January 1915 – 22 October 1989), better known by his stage name Ewan MacColl, was a British folk singer-songwriter, folk song collector, labour activist and actor. Born in England to Scottish parents, he is known as one of the instigators of the 1960s folk revival as well as for writing such songs as &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; and &quot;Dirty Old Town&quot;.

MacColl collected hundreds of traditional folk songs, including the version of &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot; later popularised by Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and released dozens of albums with A.L. Lloyd, Peggy Seeger and others, mostly of traditional folk songs. He also wrote many left-wing political songs, remaining a steadfast communist throughout his life and actively engaging in political activism.

==Early life and early career==
MacColl was born as James Henry Miller at 4 Andrew Street, in Broughton, Salford, England, on 25 January 1915 to Scottish parents, William Miller and Betsy (née Henry), both socialists. William Miller was an iron moulder and trade unionist who had moved to Salford with his wife, a charwoman, to look for work after being blacklisted in almost every foundry in Scotland. Betsy Miller knew many traditional folk songs such as &quot;Lord Randall&quot; and &quot;My Bonnie Laddie&#x27;s Lang A-growing&quot;, of which her son later created written and audio recordings; he later recorded an album of traditional songs with her.

James Miller was the youngest and only surviving child in the family of three sons and one daughter (one of each sex was stillborn and one son died at the age of four). They lived amongst a group of Scots and Jimmy was brought up in an atmosphere of fierce political debate interspersed with the large repertoire of songs and stories his parents had brought from Scotland. He was educated at Grecian Street School, Salford, England. He left school in 1930 after an elementary education, during the Great Depression and, joining the ranks of the unemployed, began a lifelong programme of self-education whilst keeping warm in Manchester Central Library. During this period he found intermittent work in a number of jobs and also made money as a street singer.

He joined the Young Communist League and a socialist amateur theatre troupe, the Clarion Players. He began his career as a writer helping produce and contributing humorous verse and skits to some of the Communist Party&#x27;s factory papers. He was an activist in the unemployed workers&#x27; campaigns and the mass trespasses of the early 1930s. One of his best-known songs, &quot;The Manchester Rambler&quot;, was written just before the pivotal mass trespass of Kinder Scout. He was responsible for publicity in the planning of the trespass.

In 1932 the British intelligence service, MI5, opened a file on MacColl, after local police asserted that he was &quot;a communist with very extreme views&quot; who needed &quot;special attention&quot;. For a time the Special Branch kept a watch on the Manchester home that he shared with his first wife, Joan Littlewood. MI5 caused some of MacColl&#x27;s songs to be rejected by the BBC, and prevented the employment of Littlewood as a BBC children&#x27;s programme presenter (see: &quot;Christmas tree&quot; files).

==Personal life==
He was married three times: to theatre director Joan Littlewood (1914–2002) from 1934 to 1948; to Jean Mary Newlove (1923–2017) from 1949 to 1974, with whom he had two children, a son Hamish (1950–2024), and a daughter, the singer-songwriter Kirsty MacColl (1959–2000); and to American folksinger Peggy Seeger (b. 1935) from 1977 until his death in 1989, with whom he had three children, Neill, Calum, and Kitty. He collaborated with Littlewood in the theatre, and with Seeger in folk music.

==Acting career==
In 1931, with other unemployed members of the Clarion Players he formed an agit-prop theatre group, the &quot;Red Megaphones&quot;. During 1934 they changed the name to &quot;Theatre of Action&quot; and not long after were introduced to a young actress recently moved up from London. This was Joan Littlewood who became MacColl&#x27;s wife and work partner. In 1936, after a failed attempt to move to London, the couple returned to Manchester, and formed the Theatre Union. In 1940 a performance of &quot;The Last Edition&quot; – a &#x27;living newspaper&#x27; – was halted by the police and MacColl and Littlewood were bound over for two years for breach of the peace. The necessities of wartime brought an end to Theatre Union. MacColl enlisted in the British Army during July 1940, but deserted in December. Why he did so, and why he was not prosecuted after the war, remain a mystery. In an interview in June 1987, he said that he was expelled for &quot;anti-fascist activity&quot;. Allan Moore and Giovanni Vacca wrote that MacColl had been subject to &quot;Special Observation&quot; whilst in the King&#x27;s Regiment, owing to his political views, and that the records show that, rather than being discharged, he was declared a deserter on 18 December 1940.

In 1946, members of Theatre Union and others formed Theatre Workshop and spent the next few years touring, mostly in the north of England. In 1945, Miller changed his name to Ewan MacColl (influenced by the Lallans movement in Scotland).

In the Theatre Union roles had been shared, but now, in Theatre Workshop, they were more formalised. Littlewood was the sole producer and MacColl the dramaturge, art director and resident dramatist. The techniques that had been developed in the Theatre Union now were refined, producing the distinctive form of theatre that was the hallmark of Joan Littlewood&#x27;s Theatre Workshop, as the troupe was later known. They were an impoverished travelling troupe, but were making a name for themselves.

==Music==
=== Traditional music ===
During this period MacColl&#x27;s enthusiasm for folk music grew. Inspired by the example of Alan Lomax, who had arrived in Britain and Ireland in 1950, and had done extensive fieldwork there, MacColl also began to collect and perform traditional ballads. His long involvement with Topic Records started in 1950 with his release of a single, &quot;The Asphalter&#x27;s Song&quot;, on that label. When, in 1953 Theatre Workshop decided to move to Stratford, London, MacColl, who had opposed that move, left the company and changed the focus of his career from acting and playwriting to singing and composing folk and topical songs.

In 1947, MacColl visited a retired lead-miner named Mark Anderson (1874–1953) in Middleton-in-Teesdale, County Durham, England, who performed to him a song called &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;; MacColl recorded the lyrics and melody in a book of Teesdale folk songs, and later included it on his and Peggy Seeger&#x27;s &quot;The Singing Island&quot; (1960). Martin Carthy learnt the song from MacColl&#x27;s book, before teaching it to Paul Simon; Simon &amp; Garfunkel released the song as &quot;Scarborough Fair/Canticle&quot; on their album &quot;Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme&quot;, popularising the obscure and unique folk tune. Ewan MacColl, a decade after collecting the song, released his own version accompanied by Peggy Seeger on guitar in 1957 on the LP &quot;Matching Songs of the British Isles and America&quot; and an a capella rendition another decade later on &quot;The Long Harvest&quot; (1967).

Over the years MacColl recorded and produced upwards of a hundred albums, many with English folk song collector and singer A. L. Lloyd. The pair released an ambitious series of eight LP albums of some 70 of the 305 Child Ballads. MacColl produced a number of LPs with Irish singer songwriter Dominic Behan, a brother of Irish playwright Brendan Behan.

In 1956, MacColl caused a scandal when he fell in love with 21-year-old Peggy Seeger, who had come to Britain to transcribe the music for Alan Lomax&#x27;s anthology &quot;Folk Songs of North America&quot; (published in 1961). At the time MacColl, who was twenty years older than Peggy, was still married to his second wife.

=== Singer-songwriter ===
Seeger and MacColl recorded several albums of searing political commentary songs. MacColl himself wrote over 300 songs, some of which have been recorded by artists (in addition to those mentioned above) such as Planxty, the Dubliners, Dick Gaughan, Phil Ochs, the Clancy Brothers, Elvis Presley, Weddings Parties Anything, The Pogues and Johnny Cash. In 2001, &quot;The Essential Ewan MacColl Songbook&quot; was published, which includes the words and music to 200 of his songs. Dick Gaughan, Dave Burland and Tony Capstick collaborated in &quot;The Songs of Ewan MacColl&quot; (1978; 1985).

Many of MacColl&#x27;s best-known songs were written for the theatre. For example, he wrote &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; very quickly at the request of Seeger, who needed it for use in a play she was appearing in. He taught it to her by long-distance telephone while she was on tour in the United States (from where MacColl had been barred because of his Communist past). Seeger said that MacColl used to send her tapes to listen to whilst they were apart and that the song was on one of them. This song, which was recorded by Roberta Flack for her debut album, &quot;First Take&quot;, issued by Atlantic records in June 1969, became a No. 1 hit in 1972 and won MacColl a Grammy Award for Song of the Year, while Flack received a Grammy Award for Record of the Year.

In 1959, MacColl began releasing LP albums on Folkways Records, including several collaborative albums with Peggy Seeger. His song &quot;Dirty Old Town&quot;, inspired by his home town of Salford in Lancashire, was written for the play &quot;Landscape with Chimneys&quot; (1949) produced by Joan Littlewood and Theatre Workshop. It went on to become a folk-revival staple and was recorded by the Spinners (1964), Donovan (1964), Roger Whittaker (1968), Julie Felix (1968), the Dubliners (1968), Rod Stewart (1969), the Clancy Brothers (1970), the Pogues (1985), the Mountain Goats (2002), Simple Minds (2003), Ted Leo and the Pharmacists (2003), Frank Black (2006) and Bettye LaVette (2012).

MacColl&#x27;s song &quot;The Shoals of Herring&quot;, based on the life of Norfolk fisherman and folk singer Sam Larner was recorded by the Dubliners, the Clancy Brothers, the Corries and more. Other popular songs written and performed by MacColl include &quot;The Manchester Rambler&quot;, &quot;The Moving-On Song&quot; and &quot;The Joy of Living&quot;.

Ewan has a short biography of his work in the accompanying book of the Topic Records 70-year anniversary boxed set &quot;Three Score and Ten&quot;. Five of his recordings, three of them solo, appear in the boxed set:
* on CD #4: 
** track 2, &quot;Come All Ye Fisher Lads&quot;, with the Fisher Family, from their album &quot;The Fisher Family&quot;.
* on CD #5: 
**track 4, &quot;Go Down You Murderers&quot;, from &quot;Chorus from the Gallows&quot;
* on CD #6:
**track 9, &quot;To the Begging I Will Go&quot;, from &quot;Manchester Angel&quot;
**track 14, &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot;, with Brian Daly, from the single &quot;Sixteen Tons/The Swan Necked Valve&quot; 
** track 18, &quot;Dirty Old Town&quot;, from the single &quot;Dirty Old Town/Sheffield Apprentice&quot;.

===Political songs===
MacColl was one of the main composers of British protest songs during the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s. In the early 1950s he penned &quot;The Ballad of Ho Chi Minh&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of Stalin&quot; for the British Communist Party.

&lt;poem&gt;
Joe Stalin was a mighty man and a mighty man was he
He led the Soviet people on the road to victory.
&lt;/poem&gt;

When asked about the song in a 1985 interview, he said that it was &quot;a very good song&quot; and that &quot;it dealt with some of the positive things that Stalin did&quot;. In 1992, after his death, Peggy Seeger included it as an annex in her &quot;Essential Ewan MacColl Songbook&quot;, saying that she had originally planned to exclude the song on the grounds that Ewan would not have wanted it included, but decided to include it as an example of his work in his early career. The B-side of the record, &quot;Sovietland (Land of Freedom)&quot; was not included in the songbook.

MacColl sang and composed numerous protest and topical songs for the nuclear disarmament movement, for example &quot;Against the Atom Bomb&quot;, &quot;The Vandals&quot;, &quot;Nightmare&quot;, and &quot;Nuclear Means Jobs&quot;.

MacColl dedicated an entire album to the lifestyle of Gypsies in his 1964 album &quot;The Travelling People&quot;. Many of the songs spoke against the prejudice against Roma Gypsies, although some also contained derogatory remarks about &quot;tinkers&quot;, which is a word for Irish Travellers.

He wrote &quot;The Ballad of Tim Evans&quot; (also known as &quot;Go Down You Murderer&quot;) a song protesting against capital punishment, based on an infamous murder case in which an innocent man, Timothy Evans, was condemned and executed, before the real culprit was discovered.

MacColl was very active during the miners&#x27; strike of 1984–85 in distributing free cassettes of songs supportive of the National Union of Mineworkers, entitled &quot;Daddy, what did you do in the strike?&quot; The title song was unusually aggressive in its language towards the strikebreakers. This collection was only released on cassette and remaining copies are rare, but some of the less aggressive songs have featured on other compilations. At MacColl&#x27;s 70th birthday party, he was presented by Arthur Scargill with a miner&#x27;s lamp to show appreciation for his support.

In his last interview in August 1988, MacColl stated that he still believed in a socialist revolution and that the communist parties of the west had become too moderate. He stated that he had been a member of the Communist Party but left because he felt that the Soviet Union was &quot;not communist or socialist enough&quot;.

==Radio==
MacColl had been a radio actor since 1933. By the late 1930s he was writing scripts as well. In 1957 producer Charles Parker asked MacColl to collaborate in the creation of a feature programme about the heroic death of train driver John Axon. Normal procedure would have been to use the recorded field interviews only as source for writing the script. MacColl produced a script that incorporated the actual voices and so created a new form that they called the radio ballad.

Between 1957 and 1964, eight of these were broadcast by the BBC, all created by the team of MacColl and Parker together with Peggy Seeger who handled musical direction, conducted a great many field interviews, and wrote songs, either together with MacColl or alone. MacColl wrote the scripts and songs, as well as, with the others, collecting the field recordings which were the heart of the productions.

==Teaching and theatre==
In 1965 Ewan and Peggy formed the Critics Group from a number of young followers, with Charles Parker in attendance, frequently recording the group&#x27;s weekly sessions at MacColl and Seeger&#x27;s home. The initial aim of improving musical skills soon broadened to performing at political events, the Singers&#x27; Club where MacColl, Seeger and Lloyd were featured artists and theatre productions. Members who became performing folk singers in their own right included Frankie Armstrong, John Faulkner, Sandra Kerr, Dennis Turner, Terry Yarnell, Bob Blair, Jim Carroll, Brian Pearson and Jack Warshaw. Other members, including Michael Rosen, joined primarily for theatre productions, the Festival of Fools, a political review of the previous year.

As the theatre group&#x27;s importance grew, members more interested in singing left. The productions ran until the winter of 1972–73. Members&#x27; differences with MacColl&#x27;s vision of a full-time touring company led to the group&#x27;s breakup. The offshoot group became Combine Theatre, with a club of their own mixing traditional and original folksongs and theatrical performances based on contemporary events, into the 1980s.

==Death and legacy==
After many years of poor health (in 1979 he suffered the first of many heart attacks), MacColl died on 22 October 1989, in the Brompton Hospital, in London, after complications following heart surgery. His autobiography &quot;Journeyman&quot; was published the following year. The lifetime archive of his work with Peggy Seeger and others was passed on to Ruskin College in Oxford.

There is a plaque dedicated to MacColl in Russell Square in London. The inscription includes: &quot;Presented by his communist friends 25.1.1990 ... Folk Laureate – Singer – Dramatist – Marxist ... in recognition of strength and singleness of purpose of this fighter for Peace and Socialism&quot;. In 1991 he was awarded a posthumous honorary degree by the University of Salford.

His daughter from his second marriage, Kirsty MacColl, followed him into a musical career, albeit in a different genre. She died in a boating accident in Mexico in 2000. His son with Peggy Seeger, Neill MacColl, is the long-standing guitarist for Mancunian musician David Gray. His grandson Jamie MacColl has also developed a musical career of his own with the band Bombay Bicycle Club.

<text>Mind uploading is a speculative process of whole brain emulation in which a brain scan is used to completely emulate the mental state of the individual in a digital computer. The computer would then run a simulation of the brain&#x27;s information processing, such that it would respond in essentially the same way as the original brain and experience having a sentient conscious mind.

Substantial mainstream research in related areas is being conducted in neuroscience and computer science, including animal brain mapping and simulation, development of faster supercomputers, virtual reality, brain–computer interfaces, connectomics, and information extraction from dynamically functioning brains. According to supporters, many of the tools and ideas needed to achieve mind uploading already exist or are under active development; however, they will admit that others are, as yet, very speculative, but say they are still in the realm of engineering possibility.

Mind uploading may potentially be accomplished by either of two methods: copy-and-upload or copy-and-delete by gradual replacement of neurons (which can be considered as a gradual destructive uploading), until the original organic brain no longer exists and a computer program emulating the brain takes control of the body. In the case of the former method, mind uploading would be achieved by scanning and mapping the salient features of a biological brain, and then by storing and copying that information state into a computer system or another computational device. The biological brain may not survive the copying process or may be deliberately destroyed during it in some variants of uploading. The simulated mind could be within a virtual reality or simulated world, supported by an anatomic 3D body simulation model. Alternatively, the simulated mind could reside in a computer inside—or either connected to or remotely controlled by—a (not necessarily humanoid) robot, biological, or cybernetic body.

Among some futurists and within part of transhumanist movement, mind uploading is treated as an important proposed life extension or immortality technology (known as &quot;digital immortality&quot;). Some believe mind uploading is humanity&#x27;s current best option for preserving the identity of the species, as opposed to cryonics. Another aim of mind uploading is to provide a permanent backup to our &quot;mind-file&quot;, to enable interstellar space travel, and a means for human culture to survive a global disaster by making a functional copy of a human society in a computing device. Whole-brain emulation is discussed by some futurists as a &quot;logical endpoint&quot; of the topical computational neuroscience and neuroinformatics fields, both about brain simulation for medical research purposes. It is discussed in artificial intelligence research publications as an approach to strong AI (artificial general intelligence) and to at least weak superintelligence. Another approach is seed AI, which would not be based on existing brains. Computer-based intelligence such as an upload could think much faster than a biological human even if it were no more intelligent. A large-scale society of uploads might, according to futurists, give rise to a technological singularity, meaning a sudden time constant decrease in the exponential development of technology. Mind uploading is a central conceptual feature of numerous science fiction novels, films, and games.

==Overview==
Many neuroscientists believe that the human mind is largely an emergent property of the information processing of its neuronal network.

Neuroscientists have stated that important functions performed by the mind, such as learning, memory, and consciousness, are due to purely physical and electrochemical processes in the brain and are governed by applicable laws. For example, Christof Koch and Giulio Tononi wrote in &quot;IEEE Spectrum&quot;:

Eminent computer scientists and neuroscientists have predicted that advanced computers will be capable of thought and even attain consciousness, including Koch and Tononi, Douglas Hofstadter, Jeff Hawkins, Marvin Minsky, Randal A. Koene, and Rodolfo Llinás.

Many theorists have presented models of the brain and have established a range of estimates of the amount of computing power needed for partial and complete simulations. Using these models, some have estimated that uploading may become possible within decades if trends such as Moore&#x27;s law continue. As of December 2022, this kind of technology is almost entirely theoretical.

== Theoretical benefits and applications ==
=== &quot;Immortality&quot; or backup ===
In theory, if the information and processes of the mind can be disassociated from the biological body, they are no longer tied to the individual limits and lifespan of that body. Furthermore, information within a brain could be partly or wholly copied or transferred to one or more other substrates (including digital storage or another brain), thereby—from a purely mechanistic perspective—reducing or eliminating &quot;mortality risk&quot; of such information. This general proposal was discussed in 1971 by biogerontologist George M. Martin of the University of Washington. This questions the concept of identity. From the perspective of the biological brain, the simulated brain may just be a copy, even if it is conscious and has an indistinguishable character. As such, the original biological being, before the uploading, might consider the digital twin to be a new and independent being rather than the future self.

=== Space exploration ===
An &quot;uploaded astronaut&quot; could be used instead of a &quot;live&quot; astronaut in human spaceflight, avoiding the perils of zero gravity, the vacuum of space, and cosmic radiation to the human body. It would allow for the use of smaller spacecraft, such as the proposed StarChip, and it would enable virtually unlimited interstellar travel distances.

=== Mind editing ===
While some researchers believe editing human brains to be physically possible in theory, for example by performing neurosurgery with nanobots, it would require particularly advanced technology. Editing an uploaded mind would be much easier, as long as the exact edits to be made are known. This would facilitate cognitive enhancement and the precise control of the well-being, motivations or personality of the emulated beings.

=== Speed ===
Although the number of neuronal connections in the human brain is very significant (around 100 trillions), the frequency of activation of biological neurons is limited to around 200 Hz, whereas electronic hardware can easily operate at multiple GHz. With sufficient hardware parallelism, a simulated brain could thus in theory be made to run faster than a biological brain. Uploaded beings may therefore not only be more efficient, but also supposedly have a faster rate of subjective experience than biological brains (e.g. experiencing an hour of lifetime in a single second of real time).

== Relevant technologies and techniques ==
The focus of mind uploading, in the case of copy-and-transfer, is on data acquisition, rather than data maintenance of the brain. A set of approaches known as loosely coupled off-loading (LCOL) may be used in the attempt to characterize and copy the mental contents of a brain. The LCOL approach may take advantage of self-reports, life-logs and video recordings that can be analyzed by artificial intelligence. A bottom-up approach may focus on the specific resolution and morphology of neurons, the spike times of neurons, the times at which neurons produce action potential responses.

===Computational complexity===
Advocates of mind uploading point to Moore&#x27;s law to support the notion that the necessary computing power is expected to become available within a few decades. However, the actual computational requirements for running an uploaded human mind are very difficult to quantify, potentially rendering such an argument specious.

Regardless of the techniques used to capture or recreate the function of a human mind, the processing demands are likely to be immense, due to the large number of neurons in the human brain along with the considerable complexity of each neuron.

Required computational capacity strongly depends on the chosen level of simulation model scale:
=== Scanning and mapping scale of an individual ===
When modelling and simulating the brain of a specific individual, a brain map or connectivity database showing the connections between the neurons must be extracted from an anatomic model of the brain. For whole brain simulation, this network map should show the connectivity of the whole nervous system, including the spinal cord, sensory receptors, and muscle cells. Destructive scanning of a small sample of tissue from a mouse brain including synaptic details is possible as of 2010.

However, if short-term memory and working memory include prolonged or repeated firing of neurons, as well as intra-neural dynamic processes, the electrical and chemical signal state of the synapses and neurons may be hard to extract. The uploaded mind may then perceive a memory loss of the events and mental processes immediately before the time of brain scanning.

A full brain map has been estimated to occupy less than 2 x 1016 bytes (20,000 TB) and would store the addresses of the connected neurons, the synapse type and the synapse &quot;weight&quot; for each of the brains&#x27; 1015 synapses. However, the biological complexities of true brain function (e.g. the epigenetic states of neurons, protein components with multiple functional states, etc.) may preclude an accurate prediction of the volume of binary data required to faithfully represent a functioning human mind.

===Serial sectioning===
A possible method for mind uploading is serial sectioning, in which the brain tissue and perhaps other parts of the nervous system are frozen and then scanned and analyzed layer by layer, which for frozen samples at nano-scale requires a cryo-ultramicrotome, thus capturing the structure of the neurons and their interconnections. The exposed surface of frozen nerve tissue would be scanned and recorded, and then the surface layer of tissue removed. While this would be a very slow and labor-intensive process, research is underway to automate the collection and microscopy of serial sections. The scans would then be analyzed, and a model of the neural net recreated in the system into which the mind was being uploaded.

There are uncertainties with this approach using current microscopy techniques. If it is possible to replicate neuron function from its visible structure alone, then the resolution afforded by a scanning electron microscope would suffice for such a technique. However, as the function of brain tissue is partially determined by molecular events (particularly at synapses, but also at other places on the neuron&#x27;s cell membrane), this may not suffice for capturing and simulating neuron functions. It may be possible to extend the techniques of serial sectioning and to capture the internal molecular makeup of neurons, through the use of sophisticated immunohistochemistry staining methods that could then be read via confocal laser scanning microscopy. However, as the physiological genesis of &#x27;mind&#x27; is not currently known, this method may not be able to access all of the necessary biochemical information to recreate a human brain with sufficient fidelity.

=== Brain imaging ===


It may be possible to create functional 3D maps of the brain activity, using advanced neuroimaging technology, such as functional MRI (fMRI, for mapping change in blood flow), magnetoencephalography (MEG, for mapping of electrical currents), or combinations of multiple methods, to build a detailed three-dimensional model of the brain using non-invasive and non-destructive methods. Today, fMRI is often combined with MEG for creating functional maps of human cortex during more complex cognitive tasks, as the methods complement each other. Even though current imaging technology lacks the spatial resolution needed to gather the information needed for such a scan, important recent and future developments are predicted to substantially improve both spatial and temporal resolutions of existing technologies.

=== Brain simulation ===
Ongoing work in the field of brain simulation includes partial and whole simulations of some animals. For example, the &quot;C. elegans&quot; roundworm, &quot;Drosophila&quot; fruit fly, and mouse have all been simulated to various degrees.

The Blue Brain Project, initiated by the Brain and Mind Institute of the &quot;École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne&quot; in Switzerland, is an attempt to create a synthetic brain by reverse-engineering mammalian brain circuitry, in order to accelerate experimental research on the brain. In 2009, after a successful simulation of part of a rat brain, the director Henry Markram claimed that &quot;A detailed, functional artificial human brain can be built within the next 10 years&quot;. In 2013, Markram became the director of the new decade-long Human Brain Project. But less than two years into it, the project was recognized to be mismanaged and its claims overblown, and Markram was asked to step down.

== Issues ==
=== Philosophical issues ===
The main philosophical problem faced by &quot;mind uploading&quot; or mind copying is the hard problem of consciousness: the difficulty of explaining how a physical entity such as a human can have qualia, phenomenal consciousness, or subjective experience. Many philosophical responses to the hard problem entail that mind uploading is fundamentally or practically impossible, while others are compatible with at least some formulations of mind uploading. Many proponents of mind uploading defend the possibility of mind uploading by recourse to physicalism, which includes the philosophical belief that consciousness is an emergent feature that arises from large neural network high-level patterns of organization, which could be realized in other processing devices. Mind uploading relies on the idea that the human mind (the &quot;self&quot; and the long-term memory) reduces to the current neural network paths and the weights of synapses in the brain. In contrast, many dualistic and idealistic accounts seek to avoid the hard problem of consciousness by explaining it in terms of immaterial (and presumably inaccessible) substances like soul, which would pose a fundamental or at least practical challenge to the feasibility of artificial consciousness in general.

Assuming physicalism is true, the mind can be defined as the information state of the brain, so it is immaterial only in the same sense as the information content of a data file, or the state of software residing in a computer&#x27;s memory. In this case, data specifying the information state of the neural network could be captured and copied as a &quot;computer file&quot; from the brain and re-implemented into a different physical form. This is not to deny that minds are richly adapted to their substrates. An analogy to mind uploading is to copy the information state of a computer program from the memory of the computer on which it is executing to another computer and then continue its execution on the second computer. The second computer may perhaps have different hardware architecture, but it emulates the hardware of the first computer.

These philosophical issues have a long history. In 1775, Thomas Reid wrote: “I would be glad to know... whether when my brain has lost its original structure, and when some hundred years after the same materials are fabricated so curiously as to become an intelligent being, whether, I say that being will be me; or, if, two or three such beings should be formed out of my brain; whether they will all be me, and consequently one and the same intelligent being.” Although the name of &quot;the hard problem of consciousness&quot; was coined in 1994, debate surrounding the problem itself is ancient. Augustine of Hippo argued against physicalist &quot;Academians&quot; in the 5th century, writing that consciousness cannot be an illusion because only a conscious being can be deceived or experience an illusion. René Descartes, the founder of mind-body dualism, made a similar objection in the 17th century, coining the popular phrase &quot;Je pense, donc je suis&quot; (&quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;). Although physicalism is known to have been proposed in ancient times, Thomas Huxley was among the first to describe mental experience as merely an epiphenomenon of interactions within the brain, having no causal power of its own and being entirely downstream from the brain&#x27;s activity.

A considerable portion of transhumanists and singularitarians place great hope in the belief that they may become immortal, by creating one or many non-biological functional copies of their brains, thereby leaving their &quot;biological shell&quot;. However, the philosopher and transhumanist Susan Schneider claims that at best, uploading would create a copy of the original person&#x27;s mind. Schneider agrees that consciousness has a computational basis, but this does not mean we can upload and survive. According to her views, &quot;uploading&quot; would probably result in the death of the original person&#x27;s brain, while only outside observers can maintain the illusion of the original person still being alive. For it is implausible to think that one&#x27;s consciousness would leave one&#x27;s brain and travel to a remote location; ordinary physical objects do not behave this way. Ordinary objects (rocks, tables, etc.) are not simultaneously here, and elsewhere. At best, a copy of the original mind is created. Neural correlates of consciousness, a sub-branch of neuroscience, states that consciousness may be thought of as a state-dependent property of some undefined complex, adaptive, and highly interconnected biological system.

Others have argued against such conclusions. For example, Buddhist transhumanist James Hughes has pointed out that this consideration only goes so far: if one believes the self is an illusion, worries about survival are not reasons to avoid uploading, and Keith Wiley has presented an argument wherein all resulting minds of an uploading procedure are granted equal primacy in their claim to the original identity, such that survival of the self is determined retroactively from a strictly subjective position. Some have also asserted that consciousness is a part of an extra-biological system that is yet to be discovered; therefore it cannot be fully understood under the present constraints of neurobiology. Without the transference of consciousness, true mind-upload or perpetual immortality cannot be practically achieved.

Another potential consequence of mind uploading is that the decision to &quot;upload&quot; may then create a mindless symbol manipulator instead of a conscious mind (see philosophical zombie). If a computer could process sensory inputs to generate the same outputs that a human mind does (speech, muscle movements, etc.) without necessarily having any experience of consciousness, then it may be impossible to determine whether the uploaded mind is truly conscious, and not merely an automaton that externally behaves the way a human would. Thought experiments like the Chinese room raise fundamental questions about mind uploading: If an upload displays behaviors that are highly indicative of consciousness, or even verbally insists that it is conscious, does that prove it is conscious? There might also be an absolute upper limit in processing speed, above which consciousness cannot be sustained. The subjectivity of consciousness precludes a definitive answer to this question.

Numerous scientists, including Ray Kurzweil, believe that whether a separate entity is conscious is impossible to know with confidence, since consciousness is inherently subjective (see also: solipsism). Regardless, some scientists believe consciousness is the consequence of computational processes which are substrate-neutral. Still other scientists, prominent among them Roger Penrose, believe consciousness may emerge from some form of quantum computation that is dependent on the organic substrate (see quantum mind).

In light of uncertainty about whether mind uploads are conscious, Sandberg proposes a cautious approach: 

=== Ethical and legal implications ===
The process of developing emulation technology raises ethical issues related to animal welfare and artificial consciousness. The neuroscience required to develop brain emulation would require animal experimentation, first on invertebrates and then on small mammals before moving on to humans. Sometimes the animals would just need to be euthanized in order to extract, slice, and scan their brains, but sometimes behavioral and &quot;in vivo&quot; measures would be required, which might cause pain to living animals.

In addition, the resulting animal emulations themselves might suffer, depending on one&#x27;s views about consciousness. Bancroft argues for the plausibility of consciousness in brain simulations on the basis of the &quot;fading qualia&quot; thought experiment of David Chalmers. He then concludes: “If, as I argue above, a sufficiently detailed computational simulation of the brain is potentially operationally equivalent to an organic brain, it follows that we must consider extending protections against suffering to simulations.” Chalmers himself has argued that such virtual realities would be genuine realities. However, if mind uploading occurs and the uploads are not conscious, there may be a significant opportunity cost. In the book &quot;&quot;, Nick Bostrom expresses concern that we could build a &quot;Disneyland without children.&quot;

It might help reduce emulation suffering to develop virtual equivalents of anaesthesia, as well as to omit processing related to pain and/or consciousness. However, some experiments might require a fully functioning and suffering animal emulation. Animals might also suffer by accident due to flaws and lack of insight into what parts of their brains are suffering. Questions also arise regarding the moral status of partial brain emulations, as well as creating neuromorphic emulations that draw inspiration from biological brains but are built somewhat differently.

Brain emulations could be erased by computer viruses or malware, without the need to destroy the underlying hardware. This may make assassination easier than for physical humans. The attacker might take the computing power for its own use.

Many questions arise regarding the legal personhood of emulations. Would they be given the rights of biological humans? If a person makes an emulated copy of themselves and then dies, does the emulation inherit their property and official positions? Could the emulation ask to &quot;pull the plug&quot; when its biological version was terminally ill or in a coma? Would it help to treat emulations as adolescents for a few years so that the biological creator would maintain temporary control? Would criminal emulations receive the death penalty, or would they be given forced data modification as a form of &quot;rehabilitation&quot;? Could an upload have marriage and child-care rights?

If simulated minds would come true and if they were assigned rights of their own, it may be difficult to ensure the protection of &quot;digital human rights&quot;. For example, social science researchers might be tempted to secretly expose simulated minds, or whole isolated societies of simulated minds, to controlled experiments in which many copies of the same minds are exposed (serially or simultaneously) to different test conditions.

Research led by cognitive scientist Michael Laakasuo has shown that attitudes towards mind uploading are predicted by an individual&#x27;s belief in an afterlife; the existence of mind uploading technology may threaten religious and spiritual notions of immortality and divinity.

=== Political and economic implications ===
Emulations might be preceded by a technological arms race driven by first-strike advantages. Their emergence and existence may lead to increased risk of war, including inequality, power struggles, strong loyalty and willingness to die among emulations, and new forms of racism, xenophobia, and religious prejudice. If emulations run much faster than humans, there might not be enough time for human leaders to make wise decisions or negotiate. It is possible that humans would react violently against the growing power of emulations, especially if that depresses human wages. Emulations may not trust each other, and even well-intentioned defensive measures might be interpreted as offense.

The book &quot;The Age of Em&quot; by Robin Hanson poses many hypotheses on the nature of a society of mind uploads, including that the most common minds would be copies of adults with personalities conducive to long hours of productive specialized work.

=== Emulation timelines and AI risk ===
Kenneth D. Miller, a professor of neuroscience at Columbia University and a co-director of the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, raised doubts about the practicality of mind uploading. His major argument is that reconstructing neurons and their connections is in itself a formidable task, but it is far from being sufficient. Operation of the brain depends on the dynamics of electrical and biochemical signal exchange between neurons; therefore, capturing them in a single &quot;frozen&quot; state may prove insufficient. In addition, the nature of these signals may require modeling at the molecular level and beyond. Therefore, while not rejecting the idea in principle, Miller believes that the complexity of the &quot;absolute&quot; duplication of an individual mind is insurmountable for the nearest hundreds of years.

There are very few feasible technologies that humans have refrained from developing. The neuroscience and computer-hardware technologies that may make brain emulation possible are widely desired for other reasons, and logically their development will continue into the future. We may also have brain emulations for a brief but significant period on the way to non-emulation based human-level AI. Assuming that emulation technology will arrive, a question becomes whether we should accelerate or slow its advance.

Arguments for speeding up brain-emulation research:
* If neuroscience is the bottleneck on brain emulation rather than computing power, emulation advances may be more erratic and unpredictable based on when new scientific discoveries happen. Limited computing power would mean the first emulations would run slower and so would be easier to adapt to, and there would be more time for the technology to transition through society.
* Improvements in manufacturing, 3D printing, and nanotechnology may accelerate hardware production, which could increase the &quot;computing overhang&quot; from excess hardware relative to neuroscience.
* If one AI-development group had a lead in emulation technology, it would have more subjective time to win an arms race to build the first superhuman AI. Because it would be less rushed, it would have more freedom to consider AI risks.

Arguments for slowing brain-emulation research:
* Greater investment in brain emulation and associated cognitive science might enhance the ability of artificial intelligence (AI) researchers to create &quot;neuromorphic&quot; (brain-inspired) algorithms, such as neural networks, reinforcement learning, and hierarchical perception. This could accelerate risks from uncontrolled AI. Participants at a 2011 AI workshop estimated an 85% probability that neuromorphic AI would arrive before brain emulation. This was based on the idea that brain emulation would require understanding of the workings and functions of the different brain components, along with the technological know-how to emulate neurons. To counter this idea, reverse engineering the Microsoft Windows code base is already hard, so reverse engineering the brain would likely be much harder. By a very narrow margin, the participants on balance leaned toward the view that accelerating brain emulation would increase expected AI risk.
* Waiting might give society more time to think about the consequences of brain emulation and develop institutions to improve cooperation.

Emulation research would also accelerate neuroscience as a whole, which might accelerate medical advances, cognitive enhancement, lie detectors, and capability for psychological manipulation.

Emulations might be easier to control than &quot;de novo&quot; AI because:

# Human abilities, behavioral tendencies, and vulnerabilities are more thoroughly understood, thus control measures might be more intuitive and easier to plan.
# Emulations could more easily inherit human motivations.
# Emulations are harder to manipulate than &quot;de novo&quot; AI, because brains are messy and complicated; this could reduce risks of their rapid takeoff. Also, emulations may be bulkier and require more hardware than AI, which would also slow the speed of a transition. Unlike AI, an emulation would not be able to rapidly expand beyond the size of a human brain. Emulations running at digital speeds would have less intelligence differential vis-à-vis AI and so might more easily control AI.
As counterpoint to these considerations, Bostrom notes some downsides:
# Even if we better understand human behavior, the &quot;evolution&quot; of emulation behavior under self-improvement might be much less predictable than the evolution of safe &quot;de novo&quot; AI under self-improvement.
# Emulations may not inherit all human motivations. Perhaps they would inherit our darker motivations or would behave abnormally in the unfamiliar environment of cyberspace.
# Even if there is a slow takeoff toward emulations, there would still be a second transition to &quot;de novo&quot; AI later on. Two intelligence explosions may mean more total risk.

Because of the postulated difficulties that a whole brain emulation-generated superintelligence would pose for the control problem, computer scientist Stuart J. Russell in his book &quot;Human Compatible&quot; rejects creating one, simply calling it &quot;so obviously a bad idea&quot;.

== Advocates ==
In 1979, Hans Moravec (1979) described and endorsed mind uploading using a brain surgeon. Moravec used a similar description in 1988, calling it &quot;transmigration&quot;.

Ray Kurzweil, director of engineering at Google, has long predicted that people will be able to &quot;upload&quot; their entire brains to computers and become &quot;digitally immortal&quot; by 2045. Kurzweil made this claim for many years, e.g. during his speech in 2013 at the Global Futures 2045 International Congress in New York, which claims to subscribe to a similar set of beliefs. Mind uploading has also been advocated by a number of researchers in neuroscience and artificial intelligence, such as Marvin Minsky. In 1993, Joe Strout created a small web site called the Mind Uploading Home Page, and began advocating the idea in cryonics circles and elsewhere on the net. That site has not been actively updated in recent years, but it has spawned other sites including MindUploading.org, run by Randal A. Koene, who also moderates a mailing list on the topic. These advocates see mind uploading as a medical procedure which could eventually save countless lives.

Many transhumanists look forward to the development and deployment of mind uploading technology, with transhumanists such as Nick Bostrom predicting that it will become possible within the 21st century due to technological trends such as Moore&#x27;s law.

Michio Kaku, in collaboration with Science, hosted a documentary, &quot;Sci Fi Science: Physics of the Impossible&quot;, based on his book &quot;Physics of the Impossible&quot;. Episode four, titled &quot;How to Teleport&quot;, mentions that mind uploading via techniques such as quantum entanglement and whole brain emulation using an advanced MRI machine may enable people to be transported vast distances at near light-speed.

The book &quot;Beyond Humanity: CyberEvolution and Future Minds&quot; by Gregory S. Paul &amp; Earl D. Cox, is about the eventual (and, to the authors, almost inevitable) evolution of computers into sentient beings, but also deals with human mind transfer. Richard Doyle&#x27;s &quot;Wetwares: Experiments in PostVital Living&quot; deals extensively with uploading from the perspective of distributed embodiment, arguing for example that humans are currently part of the &quot;artificial life phenotype&quot;. Doyle&#x27;s vision reverses the polarity on uploading, with artificial life forms such as uploads actively seeking out biological embodiment as part of their reproductive strategy.

== In fiction ==

Mind uploading—transferring an individual&#x27;s personality to a computer—appears in several works of science fiction. It is distinct from the concept of transferring a consciousness from one human body to another. It is sometimes applied to a single person and other times to an entire society. Recurring themes in these stories include whether the computerized mind is truly conscious, and if so, whether identity is preserved. It is a common feature of the cyberpunk subgenre, sometimes taking the form of digital immortality.

<text>Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano (LAB), internationally known as LAB Bolivian Airlines, was the flag carrier and principal airline of Bolivia from 1925 until it ceased operations in 2010. It was replaced by Boliviana de Aviación, the new flag carrier. It was the second oldest airline in South America after Avianca, and among the oldest airlines in the world. It operated scheduled domestic and international services to destinations in the Americas together with a transatlantic route to Madrid in Spain. It was headquartered in Cochabamba, having its main domestic hub at the city&#x27;s Jorge Wilstermann International Airport, and international hubs at Viru Viru International Airport in Santa Cruz and El Alto International Airport in La Paz.

The airline was founded on 15 September 1925 by a consortium of German-Bolivian residents and began commercial flights on 23 September between Cochabamba and Santa Cruz using a Junkers F 13.

==History==
===Origins ===

Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano (LAB) was founded by German immigrants in August 1925. On 24 September 1925, the airline launched its services between Cochabamba and Santa Cruz using a single Junkers F13 aircraft.

In July 1930, Lloyd Aéreo began to serve international routes, with scheduled flights between La Paz, where it was based then, and Corumbá, Brazil. On the grounds of a co-operation agreement with Syndicato Condor, an airline catering for the German minority in Brazil, LAB passengers could connect in Corumbá on a flight to Rio de Janeiro, and vice versa. Over the following years, more destinations in Brazil were added, so that Lloyd Aéreo became the second largest airline in South America at that time, only surpassed by Avianca from Colombia. In 1932, the Bolivian government seized all of LAB&#x27;s planes and staff, so that they could be dispatched for military use during the Chaco War with Paraguay.

===Bolivian national airline===

In May 1941, LAB was taken over by the government of Bolivia as the country&#x27;s national airline and Panagra was granted a contract to administer it. In March 1960, Panagra held a 20% interest in LAB and the government of Bolivia was the major shareholder. At this time, Edmundo Gonzalez was the president of the airline and the fleet consisted of seven DC-3s, one DC-4 and six Boeing B-17s. With the Lockheed L-188 Electra joining the fleet in September 1968, LAB was in the position to offer non-stop international flights. A further improvement in comfort and travel times was achieved when Lloyd Aéreo acquired its first jet aircraft (of the Boeing 727 type) in 1970, allowing for the inauguration of flights to Central America and the United States.

At March 1990, the airline had 1,700 employees and was 99.98% owned by the government. By this time the network, which consisted of 21 domestic destinations and 15 international ones (Arica, Asunción, Belo Horizonte, Buenos Aires, Caracas, Cuzco, Lima, Manaus, Miami, Montevideo, Panama, Rio de Janeiro, Salta, Santiago and São Paulo), was served with two Boeing 707-320C, three Boeing 727-200s, two Boeing 727-100s, one Fokker F27-600 and one Fokker F27-200.

===Financial difficulties and demise===

From 1994 onwards, Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano was encountering rising financial difficulties. As a consequence, the Bolivian government prepared the privatization of the airline and began to negotiate with potential buyers. On 19 October 1995, Brazilian airline VASP acquired 50 percent of the LAB shares. In an effort to cut costs, VASP aimed at a full merger of the two airlines, with a similar livery and a joint frequent flyer program as initial steps. , 49% and 48.3% of the shares were held by VASP and the Bolivian government, respectively. In 2001, VASP sold its shares in LAB back to Bolivian investors, though, due to the ongoing monetary constraints. On the other hand, in 2004, LAB was awarded shares in Ecuatoriana de Aviación, the national airline of Ecuador at that time, as a compensation for outstanding debts, which led to a codeshare agreement between the two airlines.

From 2006, Lloyd Aéreo had to cut flights because it was in bad financial shape; leased long-haul aircraft (a random mix of Airbus A310, Boeing 757, Boeing 767 or Lockheed L-1011 TriStar at that time) could not be paid for anymore. On 30 March 2007, it was decided by the Bolivian government to shut down Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano, which meant that effective on 1 April, all flight operations were suspended. In October of the same year, Boliviana de Aviación was established as new national airline of Bolivia. LAB operated a limited number of charter flights during late 2007 and early 2008, on behalf of AeroSur, but has since fully gone out of business, with its airline license officially been revoked in 2010.

==Destinations==
===During the 1930s===
At that time, Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano offered mostly domestic flights, each of which with several stopovers (which was normal at a time where the range of airlines was very limited compared to today&#x27;s situation). The route network had two hubs: In Cochabamba, the headquarters of the airline, and in Santa Cruz de la Sierra. Scheduled services were offered to the following destinations:
;Bolivia
*Cachuela Esperanza
*Camiri
*Charagua
*Cobija
*Cochabamba (hub)
*Guajará-Mirim
*Lagunillas
*La Paz
*Magdalena
*Oruro
*Potosí

*Puerto Suárez
*Riberalta
*Roboré
*San José de Chiquitos
*Santa Ana del Yacuma
*Santa Cruz de la Sierra (hub)
*Sucre
*Tarija
*Todos Santos
*Trinidad
*Vallegrande
*Villamontes
*Yacuíba

;Brazil
*Corumbá

In Corumba, passengers could connect on Syndicato Condor flights to destinations within Brazil and even to Europe. Similarly, in La Paz, connecting flights to the Peruvian towns of Arequipa and Lima were offered in co-operation with Deutsche Lufthansa Peru. Like LAB, these airlines were aiming at the German minorities in the respective countries.

===During the 1960s===
By then, Santa Cruz had replaced Cochabamba as the largest hub for Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano (now flag carrier of Bolivia), with another one having been opened at Trinidad Airport, and international routes being offered from La Paz Airport. The domestic network had grown to extensive size, covering most airports in the country (still relying on multiple-stopover flights). More international routes had been added, with LAB now also offering flights to Chile, Argentina and Peru. The following destinations were served on a scheduled basis in 1964, using Douglas DC-3, DC-6 or Boeing B-17G (the latter being military cargo aircraft converted from a bomber, which could also accommodate passengers).

===During the 1970s===
During the 1970s, LAB&#x27;s President Mario Patino Ayoroa developed the company&#x27;s routes and made it an international player. The international network saw further expansion, most notably with the launch of scheduled flights to the United States.

=== During the 1980s ===

At that time, the LAB network had been consolidated, appearing more or less in the shape it would retain until the 2000s. The largest Bolivian cities were linked with destinations all over South America, as well as in the United States (international flights usually had several stopovers). International flights as well as hub-to-hub flights were operated using Boeing 727 aircraft, whilst the Fokker F-27 and the similar Fairchild F-27 were deployed on the domestic network. From 1990, Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano moved its main hub in Santa Cruz de la Sierra from El Trompillo Airport to Viru Viru International Airport.

==Fleet==

Over the years of its existence, Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano operated the following aircraft types:

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 21 August 1944, an LAB Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar (registered CB-25) was destroyed in a fire at La Paz Airport.
*On 29 May 1947, an LAB Douglas C-47 Skytrain (registered CB-32) crashed near Trinidad.
*On 10 August 1949, an LAB Curtiss-Wright C-46 Commando (registered CB-37) crashed near Rurrenabaque. In September of the same year, a Lodestar (registered CB-26) was damaged beyond repair in a shooting during the Bolivian National Revolution.
*In 1950, two LAB C-46s crashed: CB-51 near Cochabamba on 24 April, and its sister aircraft CB-38 on 2 October near La Laguna Lake.
*On 1 January 1951, an LAB C-47 (registered CB-31) was damaged beyond repair in a crash-landing at La Paz Airport.
*On 3 November 1953, a Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano Douglas DC-3 (registered CP-600) crashed into a mountain near Potosí, killing the 25 passengers and 3 crew members on board. The aircraft had been on a scheduled domestic flight from Camiri to Sucre.
*On 5 September 1955, two LAB aircraft collided mid-air over Cochabamba: A DC-3 (registered CP-572) on a scheduled passenger flight, and a Boeing B-17G (CP-597) on a cargo flight. The Boeing crashed, killing all three crew members. The DC-3 managed to perform an emergency landing.
*On 25 August 1956, a cargo-configured Lloyd Aéreo DC-3 (registered CP-506) crash-landed at La Paz Airport, killing two out of the three people on board.
*On 26 September 1956, the first hijacking of a commercial flight with political purposes was of the Lloyd Aereo Boliviano on 26 September 1956. The airplane (DC-4), carried 47 prisoners. They were being transported from Santa Cruz, Bolivia to the town of El Alto, in La Paz. There, a political group was waiting to take them to a concentration camp located in Carahuara de Carangas, Oruro. The 47 prisoners gained control of the aircraft in mid-flight and rerouted the airplane to Tartagal, Argentina. Two of the 47 prisoners took control of the aircraft controls and received instructions to again reroute to Salta, Argentina as the airfield in Tartagal was not big enough for the DC-4. They did and moments later arrived safely to the city of Salta. They told the government of the injustice they were submitted to, and received political asylum.
*On 18 March 1957, another DC-3 (registered CP-535), which had been on a passenger flight from Cochabamba to Oruro, crashed into a mountain near Sayari. All 16 passengers and 3 crew members died.
*On 31 December 1959, all 11 occupants of an LAB C-47 (registered CP-584) died when the aircraft crashed shortly after take-off from an airfield near San José de Chiquitos.
*On 5 February 1960, a Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano Douglas DC-4 (registered CP-604), that had been on a scheduled passenger flight from Cochabamba to La Paz, crashed shortly after take-off into Laguna Huañacota, a mountain lake, following an engine fire. All 55 passengers and 4 crew members lost their lives (a two-year-old girl could be saved, but later died in hospital).
*On 21 August 1962, an LAB C-47 (registered CP-536) crashed near Cochabamba Airport during a post-maintenance test flight, killing four out of the five people on board.
*On 15 March 1963 at approximately 13:55 local time, Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano Flight 915 from Arica, Chile to La Paz, that was operated by a Douglas DC-6 (registered CP-707) on this day, crashed into Mount Chachakumani, killing all 36 passengers and three crew members. At the time of the accident, there were poor visibility conditions due to bad weather.
*On 4 February 1964, an LAB C-47 aircraft (registered CP-568) crashed shortly after departing Yacuiba Airport, killing two out of the 29 people on board.
*On 3 August 1966, an LAB C-46 (registered CP-730) that had been on a cargo flight from Riberalta to Cochabamba crashed into a mountain range of the Andes, killing all three people on board. The accident likely occurred because of a navigational error of the pilot, who had chosen a wrong flight path and subsequently had flown at the wrong altitude.
*On 19 April 1968, an LAB DC-3 (registered CP-734) crashed shortly after take-off from an airstrip at Trinidad. Even though the aircraft was damaged beyond repair, there were no fatalities.
*On 26 September 1969 at around 15:10 local time, an LAB DC-6 (registered CP-968) carrying 69 passengers and 5 crew members on a scheduled flight from Santa Cruz de la Sierra to La Paz crashed into Mount Choquetanga 176 kilometres away from the destination airport. There were no survivors when the wreckage was found after three days. Seventeen Bolivian football players had been amongst the passengers.
*On 16 December 1971, an LAB passenger flight from Sucre to La Paz was hijacked and demanded to be diverted to Chile. The aircraft landed at Cochabamba Airport instead, police forces stormed the plane and arrested the perpetrator. In the ensuing shooting, one crew member and one passenger were killed.
*On 13 October 1976 at 13:32 local time, a Boeing 707 freighter aircraft (registered N730JP) that had been chartered by LAB to operate a cargo flight from Santa Cruz de la Sierra to Miami crashed directly after take-off from El Trompillo Airport into a housing area and a crowded football pitch, killing the three crew members as well as 88 people on the ground, making it the deadliest air disaster in Bolivia to date. The accident had likely occurred because the pilots had not selected the correct amount of thrust, so that the aircraft did not gain sufficient height.
*On 23 January 1980, a LAB Fairchild F-27J (registered CP-1175) ran off a taxiway whilst being on ground at Santa Ana del Yacuma Airport and went into a ditch, during which the fuel tank was ruptured by debris from the propeller. In the ensuing fire, the aircraft was destroyed, but all 15 passengers and the three crew members could be saved.
*On 2 June 1980, a Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano F-27J (registered CP-1117) crashed into a hill whilst approaching Yacuiba Airport, killing the 10 passengers and three crew members on board.
*On 16 March 1984, another F-27M (registered CP-862) crashed, this time in a jungle somewhere between Trinidad and San Borja, claiming the lives of the 20 passengers and three crew.
*On 23 January 1985, a passenger detonated a bomb in a lavatory on board an LAB flight from La Paz to Santa Cruz de la Sierra, killing him. The aircraft involved, a Boeing 727-200 registered CP-1276, was substantially damaged but could safely be landed. There were no fatalities among the other 119 passengers and seven crew members.
*On 31 August 1991, an LAB Boeing 707 (registered CP-1365) was destroyed in a hangar fire at Dothan Regional Airport in the United States.
*On 22 December 1994, a Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano Fokker F27 Friendship (registered CP-2165) overran the runway at Guayaramerín Airport following a rejected takeoff and crashed into trees. All 36 passengers and four crew members survived the accident. The planned destination of the scheduled domestic flight had been San Joaquín.
*On 9 January 2001 at 17:20 local time, the left main landing gear of an LAB Boeing 727-200 (registered CP-2323) collapsed while taxiing at Buenos Aires Ezeiza Airport prior to a scheduled flight to Santa Cruz de la Sierra. Investigator found that the accident, by which none of the 138 passengers and 8 crew members were injured but left the aircraft damaged beyond repair, happened because of corrosion damage.

<text>The Queensboro Bridge, officially the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge, is a cantilever bridge over the East River in New York City. Completed in 1909, it connects the Long Island City neighborhood in the borough of Queens with the East Midtown and Upper East Side neighborhoods in Manhattan, passing over Roosevelt Island. Because the western end of the bridge connects to 59th Street in Manhattan, it is also called the 59th Street Bridge. The bridge consists of five steel spans measuring long; including approaches, its total length is .

The Queensboro Bridge carries New York State Route 25 (NY 25), which terminates at the bridge&#x27;s western end in Manhattan. The bridge has two levels: an upper level with a pair of two-lane roadways, and a lower level with five vehicular lanes and a walkway/bike lane. The western leg of the Queensboro Bridge is flanked on its northern side by the Roosevelt Island Tramway. The bridge is one of four vehicular bridges directly connecting Manhattan Island and Long Island, along with the Williamsburg, Manhattan, and Brooklyn bridges to the south. It lies along the courses of the New York City Marathon and the Five Boro Bike Tour.

Serious proposals for a bridge linking Manhattan to Long Island City were first made as early as 1838, but various 19th-century plans to erect such a bridge, including two proposals by Queens doctor Thomas Rainey, never came to fruition. After the creation of the City of Greater New York in 1898, plans for a city-operated bridge were finalized in 1901. The bridge opened for public use on March 30, 1909, and was initially used by pedestrians, horse-drawn and motor vehicles, elevated trains, and trolleys. Elevated service ceased in 1942, followed by trolley service in 1957. The upper-level roadways were built in the early 1930s and the late 1950s. Designated as a New York City landmark in 1973, the bridge was renovated extensively from the late 1970s to the 1990s. The bridge was officially renamed in 2011 in honor of former New York City mayor Ed Koch, and another renovation occurred in the early 2020s.

== Name ==
The Queensboro Bridge was originally named for the borough of Queens and was the third bridge across the East River to be named after a New York City borough, after the Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan Bridge. By the late 20th century, the Queensboro Bridge was also known as the 59th Street Bridge because its Manhattan end is located between 59th and 60th streets. This name caused controversy among Queens residents who felt that the 59th Street Bridge name did not honor the borough of Queens.

In December 2010, mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that the bridge would be renamed in honor of former mayor Ed Koch; the bridge had been renovated extensively in the 1980s, when he was mayor. The &quot;Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge&quot; name was formalized on March 23, 2011. The renaming was unpopular among Queens residents and business leaders; &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that Queens residents found the renaming disrespectful to their borough. The general public continued to call it the Queensboro Bridge years after the renaming. New York City Council member Peter Vallone Jr. of Queens proposed removing Koch&#x27;s name from the bridge in 2013.

== Description ==

The Queensboro Bridge is a two-level double cantilever bridge, with separate cantilevered spans over channels on each side of Roosevelt Island joined by a fixed central truss. In all, it has five steel truss spans, as well as approach viaducts on either side. The total length of the five spans, between the anchorages on the Manhattan and Queens sides, are approximately , of which are above water. In addition, there is a approach viaduct in Manhattan and a approach viaduct in Queens, connecting the anchorages on either side to street level. This brings the bridge&#x27;s total length to . The bridge carries New York State Route 25, which ends at the span&#x27;s western terminus.

=== Spans ===
The lengths of the steel spans are as follows, from the westernmost span to the easternmost:
The bridge was intended to carry a dead load of . Each span includes two parallel lines of trusses, one each on the north and south sides of the bridge; the centers of these trusses are spaced apart. The bottom chord of each set of trusses is composed of box girders, while the top chord is composed of eyebars measuring deep. The trusses range in height from between the bottom and top chords; the steel towers atop each pier measure tall. Unlike other large bridges, the trusses are not suspended; instead, the spans are directly connected to each other. In addition, there are transverse floor beams, which protrude from the trusses on either side of the deck. Atop the bridge&#x27;s topmost chords were originally galvanized steel ropes, which acted as handrails for bridge painters. Five hand-operated scaffolds were also placed on the bridge.

The spans are cantilevered from steel towers that rise above four central piers. Each cantilevered section measures long. The two spans above the East River&#x27;s channels are composed of cantilever arms, which extend outward from the towers on either side of the channel. Each pair of cantilever arms meets at a set of bents above the middle of each channel. The bents allowed the cantilever arms to move horizontally due to temperature changes, and it allowed structural loads to be distributed between the two arms. The bridge uses nickel-steel bars that were intended to be 40 to 50 percent stronger than regular structural-steel bars of the same weight. The beams could withstand loads of up to each, while the nickel-steel eyebars were intended to withstand loads of up to . The decks themselves were designed to carry as much as .

The steel spans between the anchorages weigh a total of and have a maximum grade of 3.41 percent. The spans were intended to be at least above mean high water; the bridge reaches a maximum height of or above high mean water. Until it was surpassed by the Quebec Bridge in 1917, the span between Manhattan and Roosevelt Island was the longest cantilever in North America; it was also the second-longest worldwide, after the Forth Bridge in Scotland.

====Levels====
The upper level is wide. The upper level originally contained two pedestrian walkways and two elevated railway tracks, which connected a spur of the IRT Second Avenue elevated line in Manhattan to the Queensboro Plaza station in Queens. There were also provisions for two additional tracks between the trusses (taking up the space occupied by the walkways), as well as walkways cantilevered outside the trusses. , the upper level has four lanes of automobile traffic, consisting of a pair of two-lane roadways. Although both roadways end at Thomson Avenue in Queens, they diverge in Manhattan. The two northern lanes, normally used by westbound traffic, lead to 62nd and 63rd Streets. The two southern lanes, normally used by eastbound traffic, lead to 57th and 58th Streets. The southern roadway is used as a westbound high-occupancy vehicle lane during morning rush hours, when all eastbound traffic uses the lower level.

The lower level is wide and is divided into three sections: a northern, central, and southern roadway. The center roadway is wide and was originally composed of a general-purpose road in the middle, flanked by a pair of trolley tracks. The northern and southern lower-level roadways each had one additional trolley track, for a total of four trolley tracks. The central roadway originally had a wood block pavement. , the lower level has five vehicular lanes: two in each direction within the center roadway and one eastbound lane on the southern roadway. The northern lower-level roadway was converted into a permanent pedestrian walk and bicycle path in September 2000.

==== Piers ====
The five spans are supported by six piers; the westernmost and easternmost piers act as anchorages. Each of the piers consists of two columns supported by an elliptical arch measuring wide. The piers each measure across at their bases (including the arched openings). They range from tall, with the piers on Roosevelt Island being the tallest. The foundations of the Roosevelt Island piers are shallow, since there is bedrock just below the surface of the island. By comparison, the piers in Manhattan and Queens extend over deep.

The piers are faced with Maine granite and are attached to a backing made of concrete and Mohawk Valley limestone. In total, workers used of limestone, of concrete, and of granite to build the bridges. Above the piers rise the bridge&#x27;s towers, which contain domed decorations and Art Nouveau-inspired spires. The towers extend above the bridge&#x27;s lower chords. The tops of the towers are made of 225 granite blocks, which were part of the original design but not added until 1937. The spires were removed at some point in the 20th century after deteriorating.

The two anchorages, one each at the Manhattan and Queens ends, are about inland of the shore. Each anchorage was built with spiral staircases and elevators. The anchorage in Manhattan is between First Avenue and York Avenue, while the Queens anchorage is near Vernon Boulevard. The anchorages are topped by small rooms with arched openings.

===Approaches===
The approaches on both sides of the bridge are composed of stiffened steel frames, but the Manhattan approach is the only one that is ornately decorated. The Queens approach consists of a series of elevated concrete-and-steel ramps, which were never formally decorated.

==== Manhattan approach ====
The Manhattan approach to the bridge is supported on a series of Guastavino tile vaults. The vaults are composed of three layers of tiles, which support themselves and measure thick in total. A layer of glazing and small lights were installed in 1918. The space under the Manhattan approach measures across. It is divided into a series of tiled vaults measuring across. As the bridge ascends to the east, the floor slopes down and the ceiling slopes up; as such, the ceiling measures high at its highest point. The Guastavino tiles cover the steel superstructure of the approach ramp.

Originally, the vaults were intended as storage space. From the bridge&#x27;s 1909 opening, the space under the Manhattan approach was used as a food market. The food market was renovated in 1933 and was later converted to a sign shop and garage. By the 1970s, the space under the Manhattan approach was used by the Department of Highways. New York City Center&#x27;s Cinematheque leased space under the Queensboro Bridge in 1973, although the Cinematheque never opened due to a lack of money. A developer proposed the open-air Bridgemarket under the bridge in 1976, which local residents significantly opposed, and Bridgemarket was not approved until 1996. Bridgemarket, covering , opened in 1999 at a cost of $24 million. The store operated until the end of 2015. In February 2020, it was announced that Trader Joe&#x27;s was planning to open a supermarket in this space, which opened in December 2021.

There is a massive bronze lamppost at the end of the Manhattan approach, near the intersection of Second Avenue and 59th Street. Formerly, there was a second lamppost near 60th Street. Both lampposts consisted of thick piers, which were topped by four stanchions (each with a globe-shaped lamp) and a larger spherical lamp in the center. Each lamppost had five tiers of decorations, and the sides of each lamppost were inscribed with the names of four of the city&#x27;s five boroughs. The lampposts were both removed in 1974 when the Roosevelt Island Tramway was developed, but the 59th Street lamppost was restored two years later. Parts of the other lamppost were found in a Queens warehouse in 2012 and rededicated on Roosevelt Island in 2015.

=== Use during races ===
The Queensboro Bridge has been part of the New York City Marathon course since 1976, when the marathon course traversed all five boroughs for the first time. During the marathon, which happens every November, runners cross the Queensboro Bridge westbound toward Manhattan, then pass under the bridge at First Avenue. The bridge is approximately from the beginning of the course on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. The deck of the bridge was initially covered with carpeting for the 1976 marathon; the carpeting was not used after 1977, when the bridge was repaved. The bridge is also part of the course of the Five Boro Bike Tour, which occurs every April; contestants traverse the bridge eastbound toward Queens. , the Five Boro Bike Tour uses the northern upper-level roadway.

== Development ==

=== Planning ===
Prior to the construction of the Queensboro Bridge, two ferries connected modern-day Manhattan and Queens, neither of which were near the modern-day bridge. One such ferry connected Borden Avenue in Hunters Point, Queens, to 34th Street in Kips Bay, Manhattan, while the other ferry connected Astoria Boulevard in Astoria, Queens, with 92nd Street on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side. Benjamin Henry Latrobe first proposed a masonry bridge between Manhattan and Queens in 1804. &quot;The Family Magazine&quot; published an article in 1833, suggesting a bridge between Manhattan and Queens over Roosevelt Island (which then was known as Blackwell&#x27;s Island). An architect named R. Graves proposed a three-span suspension bridge linking Manhattan to Long Island City. Queens, in the late 1830s. John A. Roebling, who would later design the Brooklyn Bridge, proposed suspension bridges at the site in 1847 and 1856.

==== Rainey attempts ====
An attempt to finance a fixed East River crossing was made in 1867 by wealthy Long Island City residents, who established the &quot;New-York and Long Island Bridge Company&quot; to erect the crossing. This group was led by Thomas Rainey, a doctor from Astoria. The crossing would have connected 77th Street in Manhattan and 34th Avenue in Queens, passing over the center of Blackwell&#x27;s Island. The New-York and Long Island Bridge Company appointed commissioners for the proposed bridge in 1875 and hosted an architectural design competition for the bridge in 1876. A cantilever design by Charles Macdonald and the Delaware Bridge Company was selected in early 1877, but no action had been taken by 1878, a year after the plans were approved. Media sources reported in May 1881 that work was to commence shortly, and a cofferdam for one of the bridge&#x27;s piers was installed that month. By the time the United States Congress approved plans for the bridge in 1887, Rainey&#x27;s bridge had been relocated southward. A state justice found in 1890 that the bridge&#x27;s charter was invalid. Nonetheless, Rainey&#x27;s efforts to build the bridge made his name &quot;a household word in western Long Island&quot;.By the 1890s, Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) president Austin Corbin had merged Rainey&#x27;s plan and a competing plan. Rainey resubmitted plans for the bridge in early 1890. The state legislature gave Rainey a charter for the Blackwell&#x27;s Island Bridge in mid-1892. Corbin received an option to buy out Rainey&#x27;s charter, and a groundbreaking ceremony for the bridge was held at 64th Street in Manhattan on August 19, 1894. The span was planned as a cantilever bridge carrying four LIRR tracks, as well as roadways and footpaths. By that November, two cofferdams were being sunk for the bridge&#x27;s piers. Laborers began constructing foundations for another pier on the eastern shore of Blackwell Island in April 1895. Stone and steel contracts had been awarded by the following year, and two of the piers had been built above the water line. Construction was halted after the piers were built, first due to lawsuits, then because of Corbin&#x27;s death. 

==== Post-unification approval ====
Manhattan and Queens were merged into the City of Greater New York in 1898, spurring alternate plans for a bridge between Manhattan and Queens. New York Assembly members proposed separate bills in early 1898 to revoke Rainey&#x27;s franchise for the bridge and to have the city purchase Rainey&#x27;s franchise. Rainey vowed not to sell his franchise, but the state legislature passed a bill in March 1900 allowing the city to take over Rainey&#x27;s franchise. Although Rainey himself eventually consented to the city&#x27;s takeover of his franchise, mayor Robert Anderson Van Wyck wanted to build a new bridge in a slightly different location.

A New York state senator introduced legislation in early 1897 to permit the development of a bridge between Manhattan and Queens; the unified city government was to pay for the bridge. At a meeting in Long Island City in February 1898, a group of men from both boroughs were appointed to consider plans for the bridge. By late 1898, Queens residents were threatening to not vote for the Democratic Party (of which Van Wyck was part) if the construction of the bridge did not begin shortly. The city allocated $100,000 for preliminary surveys and borings for the Blackwell&#x27;s Island Bridge, as well as the Williamsburg Bridge between Manhattan and Brooklyn, at the end of 1898.

In early 1899, R. S. Buck published plans for an asymmetrical cantilever bridge connecting Queens with Manhattan; the early plans called for a utilitarian design. The New York City Bridge Department&#x27;s chief engineer finalized plans for the bridge in October 1899. Coler drew up a plan for a tunnel between Queens and Manhattan via Blackwell&#x27;s Island; he claimed that the tunnel would cost $1.9 million, while the bridge would cost $13 million. The Board of Aldermen appropriated $1 million for the bridge at the end of 1899. State assemblyman Edward C. Brennan proposed a bill in January 1900 to appoint commissioners for a bridge or tunnel between Manhattan and Queens. The city&#x27;s Municipal Assembly initially failed to authorize the bridge&#x27;s construction due to opposition from Tammany Hall politicians. The bridge was approved that November; the bridge was relocated southward so its Manhattan end was near 60th Street. The United States Department of War, which had to certify the plans for the bridge before any work could begin, approved the span&#x27;s construction in February 1901. Initially, the crossing was referred to as East River Bridge No. 4; the Board of Aldermen voted to officially rename it the Blackwell&#x27;s Island Bridge in March 1902.

=== Construction ===

==== Pier construction and proposed modifications ====
R. S. Buck and his assistants were directed to prepare plans for the sites of the bridge&#x27;s piers, anchorages, and foundations. The Department of Bridges received bids for the foundations in June 1901, with Ryan &amp; Parker as the low bidder. Groundbreaking took place that September. After Seth Low was elected as the city&#x27;s mayor in late 1901, he promised that work would continue, even though the city&#x27;s new bridge commissioner, Gustav Lindenthal, wanted to temporarily halt construction. Lindenthal narrowed the bridge from . The modifications would allow the city to save $850,000 while allowing the city to build toll booths, as well as stairs and elevators to Blackwell&#x27;s Island, within these piers. To compensate for the reduced width, a upper deck would be built. By January 1902, only $42,000 had been spent on the project.

In June 1902, a subcommittee of the New York City Board of Estimate requested another $5 million for construction. The same month, Lindenthal ordered Ryan &amp; Parker to stop working on the bridge, but the firm refused to comply with his order, saying they would lose large amounts of money if work were halted. Lindenthal submitted the modified plans to the Municipal Art Society for approval but withdrew them that July, and he also allowed Ryan &amp; Parker to continue constructing the piers. Lindenthal decided to significantly modify his plans. Queens residents strongly protested any design changes, and Lindenthal finally agreed not to change the bridge&#x27;s width. By mid-1902, Lindenthal was requesting an additional $3.78 million for the bridge&#x27;s completion. In October, a special committee recommended that Lindenthal&#x27;s plans be rejected, saying that it would cost the city more if construction were halted and that two other East River bridges were also about 120 feet wide. City comptroller Edward M. Grout, meanwhile, wanted workers to divert their efforts to the Manhattan Bridge.

Low appointed a group of engineering experts that November to review Lindenthal&#x27;s revised plans. The experts concluded that neither the original proposal nor Lindenthal&#x27;s revision were sufficient and suggested that the bridge instead be wide. The approaches retained their original 120-foot width, as did the piers themselves. Henry Hornbostel was directed in early 1903 to prepare drawings of the bridge&#x27;s towers and roadway, though no architectural contract had been awarded yet. By mid-1903, the piers were two-thirds completed. The bedrock under the Queens side of the bridge was very close to the ground, so work on the piers in Queens was able to proceed more rapidly than work on the other piers. The Board of Estimate appropriated an additional $3.86 million for the bridge&#x27;s construction in July 1903. Low rejected a plan for widening 59th Street to serve as the bridge&#x27;s Manhattan approach, and Queens residents disagreed over plans for the Queens approach. The final plans called for the Queens approach to end at Crescent Street; a new boulevard, Queens Plaza, would connect the approach to Jackson Avenue and Queens Boulevard. All of the piers were finished by May 1904, and city officials inspected the bridge&#x27;s piers that July.

==== Initial work on superstructure ====
The Pennsylvania Steel Company submitted a bid to construct the bridge&#x27;s superstructure for $5.3 million in September 1903; Lindenthal rejected the bid, suspecting that the company was engaging in collusion. The city requested further bids for the superstructure the next month, but an injunction prevented Lindenthal from awarding a steel contract. The Pennsylvania Steel Company received the steel contract that November, and the Art Commission approved plans for the bridge&#x27;s spires the same month. Just before Lindenthal left office, the city received bids for four elevator towers and two powerhouses for the bridge at the end of 1903; the powerhouses were to supply the elevators. These elevators were to be positioned within the ends of the piers, which would make it impossible to widen the piers at a later date. City corrections commissioner Francis J. Lantry opposed the elevators because they would allow prisoners on Blackwell&#x27;s Island to escape. In early 1904, Lindenthal&#x27;s successor George Best canceled plans for ornamentation on the bridge.

The Pennsylvania Steel Company was obligated to complete the superstructure by the beginning of 1907, and it submitted drawings for the construction of the superstructure in mid-1904. Later that year, Best postponed construction of the bridge&#x27;s elevators and power houses, and the city authorized another $400,000 for the bridge&#x27;s construction. Local merchants protested the postponement of the elevators, saying it would not save money. Before work on the superstructure began, workers erected seventeen temporary bents between the two piers on Blackwell&#x27;s Island. When the bents were almost complete, ironworkers organized a sympathetic strike in June 1905, in solidarity with striking workers at the Pennsylvania Steel Company&#x27;s Harrisburg factory. The work stoppage lasted a month, during which workers were not allowed to complete steel castings for the bridge. By that August, over of steel castings had been completed, and another of castings were being fabricated. There was not enough material to begin constructing the superstructure. There were so few workers on site, a local group estimated that the bridge would not be completed for fifty years.

Work on the superstructure began later in 1905. By that November, workers had erected part of a steel tower atop the pier on the western side of Blackwell&#x27;s Island; at the time, the media anticipated that of steel would be erected every month. The first steel span, that above Blackwell&#x27;s Island, was completed at the beginning of 1906. After the Blackwell&#x27;s Island span was finished, the falsework was moved to Manhattan and Queens, and the westernmost and easternmost spans were built atop the falsework. At that point, the city government had acquired much of the land for the approaches. The bridge&#x27;s construction was delayed when the Housesmiths&#x27; Union went on strike that January. Unions representing other trades refused to join the strike, and the Pennsylvania Steel Company had replaced the striking workers by that May. The strike delayed construction by four months. City officials condemned a strip of land for the Queens approach viaduct in October 1906.

==== Progress on superstructure and approaches ====
The city&#x27;s Bridge Commission received bids for the construction of a steel approach viaduct in Queens in December 1906, and the Buckley Realty Construction Company submitted a low bid of $798,000. Work on the Queens approach began in February 1907. By then, about of steel for the bridge, representing nine-tenths of the steel contract, had been manufactured. Workers erected 512 tons of steel each day. To erect the two spans across the East River&#x27;s west and east channels, they first built steel towers above each pier, then constructed the cantilever arms from each tower toward the center of the river. As such, the bridge was essentially built in three sections in Manhattan, Blackwell&#x27;s Island, and Queens. By early 1907, the cost of acquiring land for the approaches had increased to $6 million, double the original estimate, and the cost of the entire bridge had increased to as much as $18 million. Snare &amp; Triest submitted a low bid of $1.577 million for the construction of the Manhattan approach that May, and work on that approach began that July.

After the collapse of the similarly designed Quebec Bridge in mid-1907, engineers said they had no concerns about the Blackwell&#x27;s Island Bridge. The steel towers above both of the Blackwell&#x27;s Island piers had been completed and were being painted. That September, some beams at the eastern end of the bridge were blown into the river during a heavy windstorm. The same month, Maryland Steel Company submitted a low bid of $758,000 for a steel-and-masonry approach in Queens. Several buildings in Long Island City, including rowhouses and an old homestead, were demolished for the Queens approach. The easternmost steel span was well underway by the end of 1907, and work on the steel towers on the Manhattan and Queens waterfronts began that December. At the time, the bridge was more than 70 percent complete. Although Manhattan residents supported widening 59th Street to serve as the bridge&#x27;s Manhattan approach, the city&#x27;s controller was opposed. The project continued to experience labor disputes, such as in early 1908, when disgruntled workers tried to destroy the Blackwell&#x27;s Island span with dynamite.

==== Completion ====
The Manhattan and Blackwell&#x27;s Island sections of the bridge were riveted together on March 13, 1908, and the Blackwell&#x27;s Island and Queens sections were linked on March 18. The Board of Aldermen appropriated another $1.2 million for the bridge&#x27;s completion shortly afterward; the project had cost $6.2 million up to that point. The New York City Department of Finance&#x27;s chief engineer began investigating the bridge in May 1908 in response to concerns over its structural integrity, as the bridge was similar to the collapsed Quebec Bridge, and the plans had been modified after the contract for the superstructure had been awarded. That June, the Board of Estimate authorized $30,000 for two investigations into the bridge&#x27;s safety. The Pennsylvania Steel Company formally completed the superstructure on June 16, 1908, eighteen months behind schedule. The Department of Bridges began receiving bids that July for paving and electrical equipment, and the approach viaducts were completed on August 17. The city refused to pay Pennsylvania Steel until 1912, when a judge forced them to do so.

Businessmen proposed renaming the crossing as the Queensboro Bridge in September 1908, saying the Blackwell Island name was too closely associated with the island&#x27;s hospitals and asylums. Despite several Irish-American groups&#x27; objections that the Queensboro name resembled a British name, it stuck. The structural engineers tasked with studying the bridge concluded that it was structurally sound, although the bridge was altered to carry two elevated tracks rather than four. There was still skepticism over the bridge&#x27;s structural integrity, and the Bridge Department planned to remove some heavy stringers from the upper deck to reduce the bridge&#x27;s dead load. Paving of the bridge&#x27;s decks was completed in January 1909. In total, the crossing had cost about $20 million, including $12.6 million for spans and over $5 million for land acquisition. One newspaper had estimated that 55 workers had been killed during construction.

== Operational history ==

=== Opening and 1910s ===
In February 1909, the Celebration Committee set June 12 as the bridge&#x27;s official opening date, and two grand parades were planned for the bridge&#x27;s official opening. The lights on the bridge were first turned on March 28, and the bridge opened to the public two days later on March 30, 1909. The upper deck&#x27;s tracks were not in service because engineers had deemed them unsafe for use. The Queensboro Bridge formally opened as scheduled on June 12, 1909; at the time, it was the fourth-longest bridge in the world. The grand opening included a fireworks display, a parade lasting several hours, a &quot;Queen of the Queensboro Bridge&quot; beauty pageant in a local newspaper, and a week of carnivals.

During late 1909, the Williams Engineering and Contracting Company sued the city for damages relating to the unbuilt elevators on Blackwell&#x27;s Island, and there was another lawsuit over its safety. Tolls on the bridge were abolished in 1911. A bridge approach between Second and Third avenues in Manhattan was proposed in 1913, and plans for elevated rapid transit on the upper level were approved at the same time. By that year, the bridge carried 29 million people a year (compared to 3.6 million during 1909). Horse-drawn vehicles made up almost 30 percent of the bridge&#x27;s total vehicular traffic in the early 1910s, which dropped to less than 2 percent within a decade.

In mid-1914, engineers devised plans to add two subway tracks to the lower level and replace the existing roadway with a pair of roadways on the upper and lower levels. The upper roadway would have connected to Van Alst Avenue (21st Street) in Queens; one company proposed constructing the deck in 18 months. The subway plans were ultimately dropped in favor of the 60th Street Tunnel. In early 1916, the New York City government allocated $144,000 for repairs to the roadway, as it had never been repaved and was full of holes and ruts. A new foundation was installed to slow down the decay of the wooden pavement. Simultaneously, the city&#x27;s Public Service Commission had approved the construction of connections between the bridge&#x27;s upper-level tracks and the elevated lines at either end. Elevated service across the bridge commenced in July 1917, and the entire repaving project was nearly done later that year.

=== 1920s to 1940s ===
By the early 1920s, one hundred thousand people a day used the span, and the Queensboro Bridge and the other East River bridges were rapidly reaching their vehicular capacity. One count in 1920 found that an estimated 18,000 motor vehicles used the bridge daily, while another count in 1925 found that 45,000 vehicles used the span in 24 hours. Proposals to relieve traffic on the bridge included a ferry from Manhattan to Queens; larger signs pointing to existing ferries; a parallel bridge; and a parallel tunnel (later the Queens–Midtown Tunnel). Traffic on the bridge more than doubled from 1924 to 1932, though the opening of new vehicular crossings caused congestion to increase less rapidly after 1932. By the mid-1930s, the bridge handled an average of 110,000 vehicles daily. When the Queens–Midtown Tunnel opened in 1940, &quot;The New York Times&quot; predicted it would relieve congestion on the Queensboro Bridge.

==== 1920s modifications and new roadway ====
The Manhattan approach viaduct was repaired in 1920, and city officials began adding a concrete pavement to the bridge in mid-1924. Engineers determined at the time that a hard-surfaced roadway would be too heavy for the bridge. Queens borough president Maurice E. Connolly said the weight of trucks had caused the steel buckle plates under the pavement to break, though the commissioner of the city&#x27;s Plant and Structure Department said the bridge was still safe and that stronger plates were being installed. In addition, Manhattan borough president Julius Miller proposed a plaza and a new approach road at the Manhattan end in 1924, and he submitted plans to acquire property for the plaza and road later the same year. Miller revised his plans in 1925, calling for a tunnel under Second Avenue and a new street east of the avenue between 57th and 63rd streets. To alleviate congestion, one of the bridge&#x27;s lanes was used as a reversible lane during peak hours.

In late 1926, Plant and Structure commissioner Albert Goldman proposed adding three vehicular lanes and removing the bridge&#x27;s footpaths; the proposal also called for new approaches at either end and relocation of the elevated tracks. The Merchants Association and the Fifth Avenue Association endorsed this plan. The Board of Estimate allocated $150,000 for improvements to the bridge in April 1927, and the board approved the $3 million plan that June. The project was delayed due to difficulties in acquiring property, and the city controller&#x27;s office contemplated abandoning plans for the new approaches. In late 1928, the Board of Estimate allowed construction to commence on both the new lanes and the approach viaducts at either end. To reduce congestion, the Manhattan ends of the upper and lower roadways were apart, while the Queens ends of these roadways were about apart. Real-estate developers supported the project because it would encourage real-estate and business activity in Queens. Fire extinguishers and chemical carts, for fighting small fires, were also installed on the bridge in 1928.

Goldman publicized his plans for the southern upper roadway in April 1929, and the T. H. Reynolds Company had been hired to move the elevated tracks by the next month. The Bersin Construction Company received a contract for the new roadway in August 1929 and started construction the same month. A contract for the Queens approach viaduct was awarded to Bersin-Ronn Engineering Corporation in April 1930. The upper roadway was substantially completed by early 1931; it opened that June and carried only eastbound cars. By then, the bridge was carrying almost 100,000 vehicles a day. A new footpath was also constructed on the south side of the upper level but was not opened with the upper roadway. Initially, the upper deck had a wood, granite, and asphalt pavement. It contained grooves for motorists&#x27; tires, preventing them from changing lanes; after drivers complained about damaged tires, the grooves were first widened, then infilled by September.

====1930s and 1940s modifications====
To reduce congestion, one civic group suggested a plaza at the bridge&#x27;s Manhattan end in the early 1930s, while Manhattan&#x27;s borough president Samuel Levy proposed building an underpass to carry traffic on Second Avenue beneath the Manhattan end of the bridge. Precipitation had begun to corrode the bridge&#x27;s steel supports, as the masonry work had never been completed; this prompted a grand jury investigation into the bridge&#x27;s safety in 1934. Additionally, in mid-December of that year, the roadway was designated as part of New York State Route 25 and New York State Route 24 when those designations were extended. In 1934, westbound motorists began using the upper southern roadway during weekday mornings, Sundays, and holiday evenings; the upper roadway continued to carry eastbound traffic at all other times. To reduce congestion, traffic agents began controlling traffic at each end of the bridge in July 1935, and lane control lights for the lower level&#x27;s reversible lanes were installed later the same year.

The bridge&#x27;s wooden pavement also posed a hazard during rainy weather and made the bridge one of the city&#x27;s most dangerous roadways by the mid-1930s. This prompted local groups to call for the installation of a non-skid pavement. Workers repaved the upper level in early 1935 and began installing an experimental concrete-and-steel pavement on the lower level that April. City officials also contemplated adding an asphalt-plank pavement to the bridge. Works Progress Administration (WPA) laborers began repaving the lower level in March 1936; The city government also planned to add lane markings to the lower roadway and convert the upper roadway permanently into a one-way road. After delays caused by material and labor shortages, the repaving of the lower level was completed in June 1937. WPA laborers also completed the tops of the bridge&#x27;s towers. WPA workers began rebuilding the upper level pavement in July 1938, and the upper roadway closed that October, reopening two months later.

By 1942, the city government was planning to shutter and dismantle the Second Avenue Elevated tracks across the Queensboro Bridge; the line closed in June 1942, and it was demolished by the end of the year. There were also plans in the mid-1940s to connect the bridge&#x27;s Queens terminal with an expressway running to the John F. Kennedy International Airport. The City Planning Commission proposed rebuilding the Manhattan end of the bridge in late 1946 and adding an eight-story parking garage above the approach viaduct. This proposal was postponed due to a lack of money. The bridge was repainted in 1948, and a $12 million renovation of the bridge was announced the next year. The plan included two extra lanes on the upper level, new pavement, a bus terminal in Manhattan, and cloverleaf ramps at the Manhattan approach. The city government was concurrently planning the Welfare Island Bridge, which would allow people to access Welfare Island without needing to use the Queensboro Bridge&#x27;s elevator.

=== 1950s and 1960s ===
Officials installed fences in 1951 to prevent jaywalking at the Manhattan approach, and the city&#x27;s parking authority contemplated erecting a parking garage west of the bridge&#x27;s Manhattan terminus the same year. Public Works commissioner Frederick H. Zurmuhlen announced that October that his office was preparing plans for the northern upper roadway, and he petitioned the city government for $6.5 million for the new roadway. By the next year, plans for the roadway and its Manhattan approach were complete, and workers were demolishing buildings to make way for the roadway&#x27;s Manhattan approach. Zurmuhlen requested $8.2 million from the city in 1953 for the construction of the roadway; in exchange, he dropped plans for a bus terminal at the Manhattan end of the bridge. The bridge&#x27;s approaches were repaved in 1954.

The Board of Estimate allocated $7.7 million in June 1955 for the construction of the northern upper roadway and approach ramps. With the opening of the Welfare Island Bridge that year, the city shuttered the trolley lanes, mid-bridge station, and stairs to Roosevelt Island, and it also planned to close down the bridge&#x27;s elevators. The last trolley traversed the bridge in April 1957, and the elevators and stairs on the Queens side of the bridge were closed the same month, although the elevator in Roosevelt Island would not be demolished for 13 years. The Queens approach ramps were also rebuilt, accounting for over two-thirds of the project&#x27;s cost. The Thomson Avenue ramp was completed first, followed by the ramp to 21st Street in late 1957. The northern upper roadway opened in September 1958, and the bridge was formally rededicated in April 1959 for its 50th anniversary.

In 1958, Consolidated Edison proposed converting the lower-level trolley tracks into vehicular lanes in exchange for permission to install power cables under the bridge. Consolidated Edison spent $4 million in 1960 to install power cables, convert the trolley tracks, and construct slip roads between the lower-level roadways. The new lanes, on the northern and southern sides of the bridge, opened on September 15, 1960. The same year, Manhattan borough president Louis A. Cioffi proposed a $2.06 million ramp at the Manhattan end of the bridge. Also during the early 1960s, the city&#x27;s Department of Public Works requested funding for a feasibility study of additional roadways, and the city&#x27;s traffic commissioner Henry Barnes studied the feasibility of a computer-controlled traffic monitoring system for the bridge.

In 1964, the NY 24 designation was removed from the road deck, leaving a solo NY 25 to do so. That same year, mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. approved the demolition of several buildings for a proposed underpass connecting the bridge&#x27;s westbound lanes with Second Avenue in Manhattan. Had the underpass been built, a bus terminal and landscaped plaza would also have been erected at the Manhattan end of the bridge. These plans were scrapped due to a lack of funding. City planner Robert Moses proposed a 1,000-space parking garage at the bridge&#x27;s Manhattan end in 1965, though Barnes objected to the plan. Instead, Barnes proposed a 1,100-spot garage on the Queens side, which was approved in June 1966. The bridge was repainted for seven months starting in November 1966 at a cost of $240,000. Between 1968 and 1970, officials commissioned five studies of Queensboro Bridge traffic, but no changes were made as a result.

=== 1970s to 1990s ===

==== Landmark status and deterioration ====
During the early 1970s, a small terminal for express buses was also proposed for the Manhattan end of the bridge, but it was not built. On November 23, 1973, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) designated the Queensboro Bridge as a city landmark, preventing any modifications without the LPC&#x27;s approval. It was the second East River bridge to be so designated, after the Brooklyn Bridge. The Board of Estimate delayed ratification of the landmark designation because some space under the bridge&#x27;s approaches was used for commercial purposes. The northern lower-level roadway was closed in 1976 while the wires underneath the deck were being replaced.

By the mid-1970s, as the city government considered an open-air market under the bridge, a city engineer described the bridge as severely deteriorated. Among the issues cited were extensive rusting, faulty expansion joints, clogged drains, potholes, and dirt. New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) engineering director George Zaimes described the bridge&#x27;s frame as being rusty, with some holes that were as large as a person&#x27;s head. According to Zaimes, the upper roadway was only attached to the bridge &quot;by its own weight and memory&quot;.

==== 1970s and 1980s renovations ====

The state government started inspecting the Queensboro Bridge and five others in 1978, allocating $1.1 million for a study. That year, the city government also repainted the bridge in a brown and tan color scheme. To reduce congestion, a contraflow lane for express buses was installed at the Manhattan end of the bridge in 1979. That year, the lower deck&#x27;s outer lanes were closed to vehicles; parts of the outer roadways had weakened to the point that they could barely carry the weight of a passenger car. Repairs to the outer lanes were expected to last for three years and cost $50 million. The southern outer roadway was converted into a pedestrian and bicycle path, which opened in July 1979. The city received $18.6 million in federal funds for the Queensboro Bridge&#x27;s restoration in 1980. By then, an estimated 175,000 vehicles daily used the bridge.

An extensive renovation commenced on February 25, 1981, and was completed in six phases. That December, the United States Department of Transportation gave $28.8 million for the bridge&#x27;s renovation. The pedestrian and bike path closed in May 1983. The NYSDOT announced that July that the southern upper roadway, which carried eastbound traffic, would be closed for repairs, which were expected to take 18 months. The northern upper roadway, normally used by westbound traffic. was converted to eastbound-only operation, except during weekday mornings when it carried westbound traffic. The ramp leading from 57th and 58th streets to the southern upper roadway was temporarily closed for reconstruction in early 1984. By the beginning of 1985, the southern upper roadway had reopened after being rebuilt for $31 million. The outer lanes of the lower level had also reopened, but state officials estimated that the project would not be complete until 1992.

The Queensboro Bridge&#x27;s pedestrian path reopened in July 1985; the same year, the city received another $60 million in federal funds for the renovations of the Queensboro, Manhattan, and Brooklyn bridges. In February 1987, the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) announced that parts of the northern upper roadway would be closed for two years. As part of the $42 million project, a new concrete deck would be installed, and the steel structure would be restored. The ramps to 62nd and 63rd streets closed in October 1987 and reopened twelve months later. This closure coincided with the renovations of other East River bridges. The lower-level bike path was opened to vehicular traffic at peak times, and flatbed trucks carried bicycles across the bridge. The lower deck&#x27;s southern outer roadway was closed for emergency repairs in 1988 after workers discovered severe corrosion. The reconstruction of the upper deck was completed in 1989 for $100 million. The bridge was still in poor condition: during a tour of the bridge in 1988, transportation engineer Sam Schwartz peeled off part of one of the bridge&#x27;s beams with one hand.

==== 1990s renovations ====
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) proposed a rail link to LaGuardia and JFK airports in 1990; the line, which would have used the Queensboro Bridge, was canceled in 1995. A renovation of the Queensboro Bridge&#x27;s lower level began in June 1990, when two Manhattan-bound lanes were closed. This phase of construction was supposed to cost $120 million. The lower deck&#x27;s partial closure caused severe congestion in Queens, since part of the nearby Long Island Expressway was also closed for renovation. By 1993, the renovation was slated to be completed the next year. At that time, officials announced plans for a Manhattan-bound high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane on the bridge during morning rush hours. A Queens-bound HOV lane during the afternoon was deemed infeasible due to heavy congestion in Manhattan. The Manhattan-bound HOV lane opened in April 1994, and all lower-level lanes had reopened by that October.

The NYCDOT announced in 1995 that it would spend another $161 million to renovate the outer lower-level roadways starting the following year. Two lanes were again closed for maintenance from April to September 1996, causing severe congestion. Following complaints from residents near 57th Street, starting in October 1996, traffic on the upper level traveled on the left during rush hours to reduce noise pollution and traffic congestion. Vehicles headed for Queens had to enter at 62nd and 63rd Streets, which caused widespread confusion. After protests from Upper East Side residents, the original right-hand traffic pattern was reinstated on the upper level, and the southern lower roadway (used by pedestrians) was converted to an eastbound vehicular lane during the afternoon rush hour. Some pedestrians and bikers opposed the conversion of the southern lower roadway, as they would have to wait for a van to take them across the bridge during weekday afternoons, but the new traffic pattern was implemented anyway.

In the late 1990s, the NYCDOT hired architect Walter Melvin to renovate the vaults under the Manhattan approach. During the renovation of the main span, a scaffold collapsed in 1997, killing a worker. The renovation of the northern lower roadway was completed in mid-1998. That August, the NYCDOT implemented a new traffic pattern during evening rush hours, where the northern upper roadway carried eastbound traffic, giving the bridge six eastbound and three westbound lanes during that time. The northern lower roadway, which carried pedestrians and cyclists during mornings and off-peak hours, was converted into a westbound lane during the evening rush hour. The NYCDOT&#x27;s commissioner called the changes an &quot;interim fix for nine to 14 months&quot;. By then, about 184,000 vehicles used the bridge daily, with slightly more eastbound than westbound vehicles using the bridge.

=== 2000s to present ===

Following the completion of additional renovations in September 2000, the northern upper roadway was converted back to a westbound road at all times. The northern lower roadway was converted into a bike and pedestrian path, while the southern lower roadway became an eastbound lane. After the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, drivers without passengers were temporarily banned from using the bridge during rush hours. The city announced plans in 2002 to restore six masonry piers supporting the bridge. The same year, mayor Michael Bloomberg again proposed tolling the four free East River bridges, including the Queensboro Bridge; many local residents opposed his plan, and Bloomberg postponed the tolling plan in 2003.

As part of a $168 million project that began in 2004, workers repainted the bridge. They also added fences and lighting, restored a trolley kiosk on the Manhattan end of the bridge, and restored the Manhattan approach in a separate project between 2003 and 2006. The renovation was temporarily halted in October 2005 after a small fire. A group of Roosevelt Island residents requested in 2007 that the city government install an elevator or stairway from the bridge, but city officials expressed multiple concerns with the proposal, including security vulnerabilities, the need to close a lane of traffic, and the bridge&#x27;s landmark designation. In March 2009, the New York City Bridge Centennial Commission sponsored events marking the centennial of the bridge&#x27;s opening. The American Society of Civil Engineers designated the bridge as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark the same year.

The bridge was renamed after Ed Koch in 2011. After a series of fatal crashes in 2013, officials closed the southern lower roadway at night. By the middle of the decade, the bridge carried 175,000 daily vehicles, making it the East River&#x27;s busiest bridge. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced plans in April 2016 to allocate $244 million for repairs to the Queensboro Bridge&#x27;s upper deck. Concurrently, elected officials proposed adding tolls to the bridge yet again. In January 2021, the city decided to install a two-way protected bike path on the northern lower roadway and convert the southern lower roadway to a pedestrian path; the conversion was delayed because of a renovation of the upper deck. The renovation commenced in February 2022.

== Public transportation ==
=== Rail service ===

==== Rapid transit ====
The bridge, built with two elevated railway tracks on its upper level, had space for two more tracks. A connection from the Interborough Rapid Transit Company&#x27;s Second Avenue Elevated to the bridge was first proposed in 1910; early plans called for a line extending to Malba. The elevated tracks were approved in 1913, and the connection opened in 1917, allowing Second Avenue trains to access the Astoria and Flushing lines. The tracks carried elevated trains until service was discontinued in 1942.

There were also plans to run a New York City Subway line across the bridge in September 1909; in a report submitted to the New York City Board of Estimate in June 1911, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company was to extend its Broadway Line onto the bridge. By December 1914, the Board of Estimate had abandoned the proposal, which would have required $2.6 million in modifications to the bridge and would have caused serious congestion. Instead, the board proposed the double-tracked 60th Street Tunnel under the East River, which would allow the city to save $500,000. The New York Public Service Commission approved the tunnel in July 1915.

In 1990, the MTA proposed an airport rail link running via the bridge to JFK and LaGuardia airports. This plan was scaled down in 1995, becoming the AirTrain JFK, which serves a small part of Queens.

==== Streetcars ====
The bridge had streetcar tracks occupying the northern and southern lower roadways. On the Manhattan side, there were two ramps from each of the outer lower-level roadways to a set of platforms under Second Avenue. On the Queens side, the tracks split into multiple branches. Six streetcar companies had applied for franchises to use the bridge by late 1908, before its official opening. The first trolleys traveled on the bridge in September 1909, and passenger service began the next month. In the bridge&#x27;s first decade, the tracks were used by the New York and Queens County Railway, Manhattan and Queens Traction Company, Steinway Lines, and Third Avenue Bridge Company. When the Third Avenue Railway started using the bridge in 1913, it built power infrastructure under the roadway, as its streetcars received power from underground. The South Shore Traction Company also applied for permission to use the bridge but was denied.

A streetcar stop was constructed at the middle of the bridge in 1919 to serve the elevator to Roosevelt Island. The tracks connecting the Third Avenue Railway with the Queensboro Bridge were removed in 1922, after the company stopped using the bridge. Although almost all streetcar service had been withdrawn by 1939, the Queensboro Bridge Local route ran across the bridge until April 7, 1957; it was the last trolley route in New York state.

On the Manhattan end of the Queensboro Bridge were originally five trolley kiosks, which contained stairs leading to a trolley terminal underground. Lindenthal and Hornbostel designed the structures, which had terracotta-paneled facades, cast-iron columns, and a copper roof with cast-iron fascias. There were arched, glazed-tile ceilings inside each of the kiosks. The kiosks also had Greek key motifs; shields with garlands; and ornamental brackets. The locations of three kiosks are unknown. Another kiosk was sent to the Brooklyn Children&#x27;s Museum in 1974, then was relocated to Roosevelt Island and renovated into a visitor center. The Roosevelt Island kiosk, which reopened in July 2007, measures across and weighs . Yet another kiosk remains in place in Manhattan but is used as storage space. The remaining kiosk in Manhattan was planned to be removed in 2002 but was instead restored.

=== Buses ===

The bridge carries three local bus routes operated by MTA Regional Bus Operations: the , and . The bridge also carries 20 express bus routes in the eastbound direction only: the , and , which all use the Queens-Midtown Tunnel for westbound travel.

=== Elevator to Roosevelt Island ===
An elevator from the bridge to Roosevelt Island (then known as Blackwell&#x27;s Island) was proposed in October 1912. Although various groups opposed an elevator in the middle of the bridge&#x27;s deck because it would block traffic, an elevator next to the deck was tested the next month. The Board of Estimate provided $366,000 in 1916 for an elevator building connecting the bridge to Roosevelt Island. The building, on the bridge&#x27;s north side, was finished in 1918 or 1919. The building was nine or ten stories tall and had two passenger and three freight elevators. The structure was set back from the bridge to reduce damage in a fire. The top floor was connected to the bridge by a roadway measuring wide; there was also a stair and a guard&#x27;s booth. The other nine floors contained various food storage rooms.

After the trolley lines across the bridge were largely replaced by buses in the 1930s, Steinway Transit retained one of the bridge&#x27;s trolley tracks and established the Queensboro Bridge Railway, a shuttle streetcar route connecting with the elevator to Roosevelt Island. The elevator was demolished in 1970, having been replaced by the Roosevelt Island Bridge. A separate passenger elevator ran during weekdays to Welfare Island, via a storehouse described as &quot;clean but gloomy&quot;, until mid-1973.

==Tolls==
There was originally a ten-cent toll to drive over the bridge, although pedestrians walked across for free. Shortly after the Queensboro Bridge opened, the city government conducted a study and found that it had no authority to charge tolls on the Queensboro and Manhattan bridges. Tolls on the Queensboro Bridge, as well as the Williamsburg, Manhattan, and Brooklyn bridges to the south, were abolished in July 1911 as part of a populist policy initiative headed by New York City mayor William Jay Gaynor. There were also proposals to charge tolls on the bridge in the 1930s, which were heavily opposed by local groups, and in the 1950s, which was rejected as overly expensive. 

In 1970, the federal government enacted the Clean Air Act, a series of federal air pollution regulations. As part of a plan by mayor John Lindsay and the federal Environmental Protection Agency, the city government considered implementing tolls on the four East River bridges, including the Queensboro, in the early 1970s. The plan would have raised money for New York City&#x27;s transit system and allowed the city to meet the Clean Air Act. While there were concerns that the bridge&#x27;s city-landmark designation could prevent tollbooths from being installed, planners said the tollbooths could just be installed on the bridge&#x27;s approaches. Specifically, a tollbooth would have been installed on the bridge&#x27;s Manhattan approach. Queens borough president Donald Manes encouraged the state government to take over the bridge so tolls could not be charged; according to Manes, the tolls would merely increase pollution around Queens Plaza. Abraham Beame, who became mayor in 1974, refused to implement the tolls, and the U.S. Congress subsequently moved to forbid tolls on the East River bridges.

A plan for congestion pricing in New York City was approved in mid-2023, allowing the MTA to toll drivers who use the Queensboro Bridge and then travel south of 60th Street. Congestion pricing was implemented in January 2025; Drivers on the northern upper roadway are exempt from the toll, but all other Manhattan-bound drivers pay a toll, which varies based on the time of day. Although no toll is charged upon exiting the congestion zone, all Queens-bound drivers must pay a toll to access streets leading to the bridge, even if they drive only one or two blocks within the congestion zone.

== Impact ==

=== Reception ===
When plans for the bridge were being finalized in 1901, there was commentary on its cantilevered design; all of the other bridges across the East River at the time were suspension bridges. The city&#x27;s bridge commissioner at the time, John L. Shea, said that the Queensboro Bridge would not be as &quot;picturesque&quot; compared to a suspension bridge but that it could look as attractive as either the Williamsburg or Brooklyn bridges. Buck said that the U.S. had some &quot;homely&quot; cantilever bridges but hoped the Queensboro Bridge was not ugly. The chief engineer of the city&#x27;s Bridge Department said in 1904 that he believed the cantilever design was &quot;a mistake&quot; and that a suspension bridge on the same site, supported by three towers, would have been a novelty.

When the bridge was finished in 1908, &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; wrote that the Queensboro was &quot;one of the greatest bridges in the world, and one of the most beautiful of its type&quot;, despite having received relatively little media attention during construction. Two decades after the bridge opened, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the &quot;Brooklyn Bridge has the reputation but Queensboro Bridge has the traffic&quot;. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; wrote in 1981 that the Queensboro Bridge &quot;reminds people of the bridges they built with erector sets as children&quot;. Nonetheless, the bridge was not as widely appreciated as the Brooklyn Bridge further south, especially in the late 20th century, and &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote in 2010 that &quot;the Queensboro appears far grittier than the romantic Brooklyn Bridge or the soaring Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to the south&quot;.

=== Impact on development ===
The &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; wrote in 1904 that the Queensboro Bridge&#x27;s construction would cause Blackwell&#x27;s Island to &quot;lose at least a share of its sinister reputation&quot;. Even before the bridge was completed, real-estate values in Queens had been increasing several times over, and its construction also spurred the sale of property along 59th Street in Manhattan. Its development allowed various parts of Queens to be served by direct train and streetcar lines to Manhattan. The &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; predicted in 1908 that the bridge&#x27;s completion would draw investors toward Long Island and away from New Jersey to the west. The same newspaper predicted that the bridge, along with the Steinway Tunnel and East River Tunnels, would change Long Island from a sparsely populated rural outpost to a densely packed suburb of New York City. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article from 1923 wrote that the bridge&#x27;s opening &quot;marked the first step in eliminating the East River as a barrier to the spread of population eastward&quot;.

The opening of the bridge encouraged development of vacant land in Queens, where tracts were resold for residential and commercial use. Many industrial firms began operating in western Queens, including vehicle-manufacturing plants in Long Island City. By the early 1910s, numerous industrial structures and loft buildings had been built around the bridge&#x27;s Queens end, particularly on Queens Plaza. Further east, neighborhoods such as Jackson Heights were built on former farmland. The Queensboro Chamber of Commerce&#x27;s spokesperson said in 1924 that real estate values in Queens had tripled within 15 years of the bridge&#x27;s opening, while the population grew from 284,000 to 736,000. At the bridge&#x27;s 50th anniversary, &quot;The New York Times&quot; credited the bridge with encouraging industrial and residential development in Queens. &quot;Newsday&quot; wrote in the 1990s: &quot;More than any other development, the Queensboro Bridge created the modern urban borough of Queens.&quot; The completion of the Queensboro Bridge inspired what became Queens Boulevard, although the thoroughfare was not finished until 1936.

=== Media ===

Because of its design and location, the Queensboro Bridge has appeared in numerous media works, including films and TV shows, set in New York City. For example, the title of Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s 1966 song &quot;The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin&#x27; Groovy)&quot; refers to the Queensboro Bridge, and it has been mentioned in media such as F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s 1925 novel &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. The bridge has been the setting or filming location for several movies, such as &quot;Manhattan&quot; (1979), &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; (2012).

<doc id="162439" wikidata="Q209064" url="?curid=162439" title="Mont Ventoux">
<text>Mont Ventoux (; ) is a mountain in the Provence region of southern France, located some northeast of Carpentras, Vaucluse. On the north side, the mountain borders the department of Drôme. At , it is the highest mountain in the region and has been nicknamed the &quot;Beast of Provence&quot;, the &quot;Giant of Provence&quot;, or &quot;The Bald Mountain&quot;. It has gained fame through its inclusion in the Tour de France cycling race; in 2009 it was the scene of the first penultimate-day mountain top finish in the Tour de France, with Alberto Contador sealing his yellow jersey.

As the name suggests (&quot;venteux&quot; means windy in French), it can get windy at the summit, especially with the &quot;mistral&quot;; wind speeds as high as have been recorded. The wind blows at over for 240 days a year. The road over the mountain is often closed due to high winds, especially the &quot;col des tempêtes&quot; (&quot;storm pass&quot;) just before the summit, which is known for its strong winds. In the 10th century, the names &quot;Mons Ventosus&quot; and &quot;Mons Ventorius&quot; appear.

Mont Ventoux, although geologically part of the Alps, is often considered to be separate from them, due to the lack of mountains of a similar height nearby. It stands alone to the north of the Luberon range, separated by the Monts de Vaucluse, and just to the east of the Dentelles de Montmirail, its foothills. The top of the mountain is bare limestone without vegetation or trees, which makes the mountain&#x27;s barren peak appear from a distance to be snow-capped all year round (its snow cover actually only lasts from December to April). Its isolated position overlooking the valley of the Rhône ensures that it dominates the entire region and can be seen from a long distance away on a clear day.

==History==

Although the hill was probably climbed in prehistoric times, the first recorded ascent was by Jean Buridan, who, on his way to the papal court in Avignon before the year 1334, climbed Mont Ventoux &quot;in order to make some meteorological observations&quot;. The Italian poet Petrarch wrote a possibly fictional account of an ascent accompanied by his brother on 26 April 1336, in his Ascent of Mont Ventoux.

In the 15th century, a chapel was constructed on the top and dedicated to the Holy Cross.

In 1882, a meteorological station was constructed on the summit, but it is no longer in use. This observatory had been planned in 1879, along with a carriage road for access.

In the 1960s, a telecommunications mast was built.

From 1902 to 1976, the Mont Ventoux Hill Climb for car and motorcycle took place on the roads of the Mont.

==Flora and fauna==

Originally forested, Mont Ventoux was systematically stripped of trees from the 12th century onwards to serve the demands of the shipbuilders of the naval port of Toulon. Some areas have been reforested since 1860 with a variety of hardwood trees (such as holm oaks and beeches) as well as coniferous species, such as Atlas cedars and larches. A little higher, junipers are common.

The mountain comprises the species boundary or ecotone between the flora and fauna of northern and southern France. Some species, including various types of spiders and butterflies, are unique to Mont Ventoux. It is a good place to spot the short-toed eagle (&quot;Circaetus gallicus&quot;).

Its biological distinctiveness was recognised by UNESCO in 1990 when the Réserve de Biosphère du Mont Ventoux was created, protecting an area of 810 square kilometres (200,150 acres) on and around the mountain.

==Climate==
==Road cycling==

In road bicycle racing, the mountain can be climbed by three routes.

* From the South: climb starts in Bédoin: over . This is regarded as the most difficult ascent, and is ranked by PJAMM Cycling as the 3rd most difficult bike climb in France. The road to the summit has an average gradient of 7.43%. Until Saint-Estève, the climb is 3.9% over , but the remaining has an average gradient of 8.9%. To serve as a comparison the climb of Alpe d&#x27;Huez is about at an average gradient of 7.9%. The last kilometres may have strong, violent winds. The ride takes to hours for trained amateur riders. Professional riders take 60 to 75 minutes. The fastest time so far recorded has been that of Iban Mayo in the individual climbing time trial of the 2004 Dauphiné Libéré: 55 min 51 s. The time was measured from Bédoin for the first time in the 1958 Tour de France, in which Charly Gaul was the fastest at 62 min 9 s.
* From the Northwest: climb starts in Malaucène: over . About equal in difficulty as the Bédoin ascent, but better sheltered against the wind.
* From the East: climb starts in Sault: over . The easiest route. After Chalet Reynard (where the &quot;lunar landscape&quot; of the summit starts), the climb is the same as the Bédoin ascent. Average gradient of 4.4%.

Every year there are amateur races to climb the mountain as quickly and often as possible in 24 hours, the Ventoux Masterseries and &quot;Les Cinglés du Mont Ventoux&quot;. On 16 May 2006, Jean-Pascal Roux from Bédoin broke the record of climbs in 24 hours, with eleven climbs, all of them from Bédoin.

===Tour de France===

Mont Ventoux is the scene of one of the most grueling climbs in the Tour de France bicycle race, which has ascended the mountain eighteen times since 1951. The followed trail mostly passes through Bédoin. Its fame as a scene of great Tour dramas has made it a magnet for cyclists around the world.

British cyclist Tom Simpson died on the mountain on 13 July 1967 from heat exhaustion caused by a combination of factors, including dehydration (caused by lack of fluid intake and diarrhea), use of amphetamines, and alcohol, although there is still speculation as to the exact cause of his death. He began to wildly weave across the road before he fell down. He was delirious and asked spectators to put him back on the bike, which he rode to within a kilometre of the summit before collapsing dead, still clipped into his pedals. Amphetamines were found in his jersey and bloodstream. There is a memorial to Simpson near the summit, which has become a shrine to fans of cycling, who often leave small tokens of remembrance there. In 1970, Eddy Merckx rode himself to the brink of collapse while winning the stage. He received oxygen, recovered, and won the Tour. In 1994, Eros Poli, not known for his climbing ability, stole away at the beginning of the day&#x27;s stage, built up a substantial time gap from the peloton, and was first over the Ventoux and eventual stage winner despite losing a minute of his lead per kilometre of the ascent.

====Tour de France stage finishes====

The race has finished at the summit of Mont Ventoux ten times. The finish line is at , although in 1965, 1967, 1972 and 1974 the finish was lower, at .
 Three riders have won on top of the mountain, and gone on to win the Tour; Charly Gaul in 1958, Eddy Merckx in 1970 and Chris Froome in 2013. Both Merckx and Froome won while wearing the yellow jersey, maintaining the overall lead until Paris. Gaul was not in yellow when he won on the Ventoux, nor did he immediately gain the maillot jaune following the victory, Gaul only taking the overall lead of the tour several stages later.

In September 2008, it was announced by Claude Haut, the president of the Vaucluse province, that in 2009 the Tour de France would visit Mont Ventoux after a seven-year absence. Unusually, the riders climbed the mountain on the second-to-last day of the race, on 25 July 2009, prior to transferring to Paris for the traditional parade on the Champs-Élysées. It was next featured in the 100th Tour de France in 2013 on Stage 15.

In 2016, the stage to Mont Ventoux was shortened by the day before, after a weather forecast of high winds at the summit. The stage then finished at Chalet Reynard at , with approximately of ascent up the mountain. This stage also featured a motorcycle-induced crash which damaged Chris Froome&#x27;s bike, prompting him to jog some 100 metres up the mountain until he was able to get a neutral service bike (as his team car was too far back at the time), which did not fit him properly.

====Other appearances in the Tour====
The race has also crossed the summit eight times.
In 1951, the approach to the summit was from Malaucène. In 2021, the first ascent was from Sault, whilst the second was from Bédoin. In all other years, the approach has been from Bédoin.

===Climb from Bédoin===
The climb by bike from Bédoin to Mont Ventoux is one of the toughest in professional cycling. The figure for the average gradients per kilometre can be found in many books and websites on cycling. The average gradient of the total climb and also the average gradients per kilometre differ slightly, depending on the source of the information. Accurate measurements result in an average gradient for the total climb of 7.43%, based on a horizontal distance of and an ascent of . The actual distance ridden is .

The average gradients in each kilometre are as follows:

===Transcontinental Race===
Mont Ventoux was used as the first checkpoint in the 2015 Transcontinental Race, which is a non-stop, unsupported bicycle race across Europe.

==Skiing==
There are two small ski stations on the mountain: &quot;Mont Serein&quot; on the north side, and &quot;Chalet Reynard&quot; on the south. High winds and the modest elevation tend to limit the ski season. Weather conditions are such that the northern slope is often icy, leading to a saying among people of the surrounding region regarding the challenges of skiing the mountain: &quot;Qui skie au Ventoux, skie partout&quot; (If you can ski Ventoux, you can ski anywhere).

<doc id="162440" wikidata="Q313770" url="?curid=162440" title="Press camera">
<text>A press camera is a medium or large format view camera that was predominantly used by press photographers in the early to mid-20th century. It was largely replaced for press photography by 35mm film cameras in the 1960s, and subsequently, by digital cameras. The quintessential press camera was the Speed Graphic. Press cameras are still used as portable and rugged view cameras.

==Details==
Press cameras were widely used from the 1900s through the early 1960s and commonly have the following features:

* collapsible into strong, compact boxes
* flexible bellows, attached to a flatbed track 
* easily interchangeable lenses, mounted on a solid support
* ability to accept sheet film, film packs, and roll film, through the use of interchangeable film backs and holders
* ground glass focusing screen
* optical viewfinder
* handheld operation 
* reduced number, reduced range or absence of movements, in contrast to field cameras or other view camera formats
* optical rangefinder focusing in some models
* Flash-synchronized internal iris lens shutter

Some models have both a focal plane shutter and an iris lens shutter. The focal plane shutter allows for fast shutter speeds and the use of lenses which do not have an integral shutter (known as a barrel lens), while the iris shutter allows for flash synchronization at any speed. The Graphlex Speed Graphic models and the Ihagee Zweiverschluss (&quot;two shutters&quot;) Duplex are examples of press cameras that had both focal plane and iris shutters.

The most common sheet film size for press cameras was the 4×5 inch film format. Models have also been produced for the 2.25×3.25 inch format (6×9 cm), 3.25×4.25 inch format and various 120 film formats from 6×6 cm. through 6×12 cm. European press cameras, such as the Goerz and Van Neck, used the 9×12cm format, marginally smaller than the 4&quot;×5&quot; format.

The press camera is still used as a portable medium or large format film camera for photojournalism and among fine art photographers who use it as a low cost, more portable alternative to a view camera. In news photography, the press camera has been largely supplanted by the smaller formats of 120 film and 135 film, and more recently by digital cameras. The advantage of the 4×5 inch format over 35 mm format is that the size of the film negative is 16 times that of a 35 mm film negative image. 
Press cameras were largely superseded by the 6x6cm medium format Rolleiflex in the early to mid-1960s and later by 35 mm rangefinder or single-lens reflex cameras. The smaller formats gained acceptance as film technology advanced and quality of the smaller negatives was deemed acceptable by picture editors. The smaller cameras generally offered lenses with faster maximum apertures and by the nature of their smaller size, were easier to transport and use. The bulk and weight of the camera itself, as well as the size of the film holders (two pictures per film holder), limited the number of exposures photographers could make on an assignment; this was less of an issue with 12 exposures on a roll of 120 film, or 36 exposures on 35 mm film.

Compared to view cameras, press cameras do not have the range of swing/tilt movements of the front standard, and rarely have back movements because many were fitted with focal plane shutters.

<doc id="162442" wikidata="Q893138" url="?curid=162442" title="Booth Tarkington">
<text>Newton Booth Tarkington (July 29, 1869 – May 19, 1946) was an American novelist and dramatist best known for his novels &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; (1918) and &quot;Alice Adams&quot; (1921). He is one of only four novelists to win the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction more than once, along with William Faulkner, John Updike, and Colson Whitehead. In the 1910s and 1920s he was considered the United States&#x27; greatest living author. Several of his stories were adapted to film.

During the first quarter of the 20th century, Tarkington, along with Meredith Nicholson, George Ade, and James Whitcomb Riley helped to create a Golden Age of literature in Indiana.

Booth Tarkington served one term in the Indiana House of Representatives, was critical of the advent of automobiles, and set many of his stories in the Midwest. He eventually moved to Kennebunkport, Maine, where he continued his life work even as he suffered a loss of vision.

He is often cited as an example of an author who enjoyed great success when alive, but whose reputation and influence did not survive his death.

==Early life and education==
Tarkington was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, on July 29, 1869, the son of John S. Tarkington, a judge, and Elizabeth Booth Tarkington. He came from a patrician Midwestern family that had lost much of its wealth after the Panic of 1873. Tarkington was named after his maternal uncle Newton Booth, then the governor of California. He was also related to Chicago Mayor James Hutchinson Woodworth through Woodworth&#x27;s wife, Almyra Booth Woodworth.

Tarkington attended Shortridge High School in Indianapolis, and completed his secondary education at Phillips Exeter Academy, a boarding school on the East Coast. He attended Purdue University for two years, where he was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity and the university&#x27;s Morley Eating Club.

Some of his family&#x27;s wealth returned after the Panic of 1873, and his mother transferred Booth from Purdue to Princeton University. At Princeton, Tarkington is said to have been known as &quot;Tark&quot; among the members of the Ivy Club, the first of Princeton&#x27;s historic eating clubs. He had also been in a short-lived eating club called &quot;Ye Plug and Ulster,&quot; which became Colonial Club. He was active as an actor and served as president of Princeton&#x27;s Dramatic Association, which later became the Triangle Club, of which he was a founding member according to Triangle&#x27;s official history.

Tarkington made his first acting appearance in the club&#x27;s Shakespearean spoof &quot;Katherine&quot;, one of the first three productions in the Triangle&#x27;s history written and produced by students. Tarkington established the Triangle tradition, still alive today, of producing students&#x27; plays. Tarkington returned to the Triangle stage as Cassius in the 1893 production of a play he co-authored, &quot;The Honorable Julius Caesar&quot;. He edited Princeton&#x27;s &quot;Nassau Literary Magazine&quot;, known more recently as &quot;The Nassau Lit&quot;. While an undergraduate, he socialized with Woodrow Wilson, an associate graduate member of the Ivy Club. Wilson returned to Princeton as a member of the political science faculty shortly before Tarkington departed; they maintained contact throughout Wilson&#x27;s life. Tarkington failed to earn his undergraduate A.B. because of missing a single course in the classics. Nevertheless, his place within campus society was already determined, and he was voted &quot;most popular&quot; by the class of 1893.

Many aspects of Tarkington&#x27;s Princeton years and adult life were paralleled by the later life of another writer, fellow Princetonian F. Scott Fitzgerald.

==Career==
Tarkington&#x27;s first successful novel was &quot;The Gentleman from Indiana&quot; (1899). In 1902–1903, he served one term as a Republican member of the Indiana House of Representatives, an experience reflected in his 1905 short story collection, &quot;In The Arena.&quot;

As a novelist, Tarkington was both prolific and commercially successful. During the 15-year period from 1914 to 1928, seven of his novels ranked among the top ten best-selling books of the year: &quot;Penrod&quot; (1914), &quot;The Turmoil&quot; (#1 best seller of 1915), &quot;Seventeen&quot; (#1 best seller of 1916), &quot;Gentle Julia&quot; (1922), &quot;The Midlander&quot; (1924), &quot;The Plutocrat&quot; (1927) and &quot;Claire Ambler&quot; (1928). He produced both of his Pulitzer Prize-winning novels during the same period. 

Two of his novels achieved longer-term commercial success. &quot;Penrod&quot; was one of a select group of novels that sold more than 750,000 copies during the period 1895–1975, according to &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; book sales data from that period. At one time, his &quot;Penrod&quot; series was as well known as &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; by Mark Twain. &quot;Seventeen&quot;, a coming-of-age story, sold some 1.7 million copies during the 1895–1975 period. Although written for an adult audience, it came to be regarded as a children&#x27;s book and was one of the best-selling books of the era in that category.

&quot;The Two Vanrevels&quot; and &quot;Mary&#x27;s Neck&quot; appeared on the annual best-seller lists a total of nine times.

Tarkington authored 25 plays, including three collaborations with Harry Leon Wilson. Some of the plays dramatized his novels. Some were eventually filmed, including &quot;Monsieur Beaucaire&quot;, &quot;Presenting Lily Mars&quot;, and &quot;The Adventures and Emotions of Edgar Pomeroy&quot;, made into a serialized film in 1920 and 1921. In 1928, he published a book of reminiscences, &quot;The World Does Move&quot;. 

==Themes==
Tarkington was an unabashed Midwestern regionalist and set much of his fiction in his native Indiana. His style has been compared to that of Mark Twain and William Dean Howells.

Much of Tarkington&#x27;s work consists of satirical and closely observed studies of the American class system and its foibles. Themes of the nouveau riche and upward social mobility appear frequently in his books.

==Awards and recognition==
===Literary===
While Tarkington never earned a college degree, he was accorded many awards recognizing and honoring his skills and accomplishments as an author. He won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction twice, in 1919 and 1922, for his novels &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; and &quot;Alice Adams&quot;.

Other achievements include: 
* Booksellers rated him &quot;the most significant contemporary American author&quot; in a 1921 poll conducted by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;. In 1922, &quot;The Literary Digest&quot; called him America&#x27;s greatest living author, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; selected him as one of the 10 greatest living Americans. 
* He won the O. Henry Memorial Award in 1931 for his short story &quot;Cider of Normandy&quot;.
* He was awarded the National Institute of Arts and Letters Gold Medal in 1933.
* &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot;, which Orson Welles filmed in 1942, is included in the Modern Library&#x27;s list of the 100 best novels.

===Honorary===
Tarkington&#x27;s honorary degrees included an A.M. and a Litt.D. from Princeton, and honorary doctorates from Columbia University and Purdue. He made substantial donations to Purdue for building an all-men&#x27;s residence hall, which the university named Tarkington Hall in his honor.

==Personal life==
Tarkington was married to Laura Louisa Fletcher from 1902 until their divorce in 1911. Their only child, Laurel, was born in 1906 and died in 1923. Fletcher, a published poet (and aunt of 1930s gay Hollywood nightclub performer Bruz Fletcher), was involved in adapting his fiction for the stage. Her prosperous Indiana banking family is thought to be the model for certain characters in Tarkington&#x27;s writing.

Tarkington&#x27;s second marriage was to Susanah Keifer Robinson in 1912. They had no children.

Tarkington began losing his eyesight in the 1920s. He continued producing his works by dictating to his secretary Elizabeth Trotter. Despite his failing eyesight, between 1928 and 1940 he edited several historical novels by his Kennebunkport, Maine, neighbor Kenneth Roberts, who described Tarkington as a &quot;co-author&quot; of his later books and dedicated three of them (&quot;Rabble in Arms&quot;, &quot;Northwest Passage&quot;, and &quot;Oliver Wiswell&quot;) to him.

Tarkington underwent eye surgery in February 1929. In August 1930, he suffered a complete loss in his eyesight and was rushed from Maine to Baltimore for surgery on his right eye. He had an additional two operations in the latter half of 1930. In 1931, after five months of blindness, he underwent a fifth and final operation. The surgery resulted in a significant restoration in his eyesight. However, his physical energy was diminished for the remainder of his life.

Tarkington maintained a home in his native Indiana at 4270 North Meridian Street in Indianapolis. From 1923 until his death, Tarkington spent summers and then much of his later life in Kennebunkport at his much loved home, &quot;Seawood&quot;. In Kennebunkport, he was well known as a sailor, and his schooner, the &quot;Regina&quot;, survived him. &quot;Regina&quot; was moored next to Tarkington&#x27;s boathouse, &quot;The Floats&quot;, which he also used as his studio. His extensively renovated studio is now the Kennebunkport Maritime Museum. It was from his home in Maine that he and his wife Susannah established their relation with nearby Colby College.
Tarkington took a close interest in fine art and collectibles and was a trustee of the John Herron Art Institute. He made a gift of some his papers to Princeton, his alma mater, and his wife Susannah, who survived him by over 20 years, made a separate gift of his remaining papers to Colby College after his death. Purdue University&#x27;s library holds many of his works in its Special Collection&#x27;s Indiana Collection. Indianapolis commemorates his impact on literature and the theatre, and his contributions as a Midwesterner and &quot;son of Indiana&quot; in its Booth Tarkington Civic Theatre.

Tarkington died on May 19, 1946, aged 76, in his home in Indianapolis. He was buried in Crown Hill Cemetery.

==Legacy==
In the 1910s and 1920s, Tarkington was regarded as &quot;the most important and lasting writer of his generation&quot;, perhaps as important as Mark Twain. His works were reprinted many times, were often on best-seller lists, won many prizes, and were adapted into other media. &quot;Penrod&quot; and its two sequels were regular birthday presents for bookish boys.

By the later twentieth century, however, he was ignored in academia: no congresses, no society, no journal of &quot;Tarkington Studies.&quot; In 1981, The Avenue (Penguin) Companion to English and American Literature described him as &quot;the epitome of the middle-brow American novelist.&quot; In 1985, he was cited as an example of the great discrepancy possible between an author&#x27;s fame when alive and oblivion later. According to this view, if an author succeeds at pleasing his or her contemporaries—and Tarkington&#x27;s works have not a whiff of social criticism—he or she is not going to please later readers of inevitably different values and concerns.

In 2004, author and critic Thomas Mallon noted: &quot;Entirely absent from most current histories of American writing, Tarkington was generally scorned by those published just before or after his death.&quot;

In 2019, Robert Gottlieb wrote that Tarkington &quot;dwindled into America&#x27;s most distinguished hack.&quot; Gottlieb criticized Tarkington&#x27;s anti-modernist perspective, &quot;his deeply rooted, unappeasable need to look longingly backward, an impulse that goes beyond nostalgia,&quot; for preventing him from &quot;producing so little of real substance.&quot;

Mallon wrote of Tarkington that &quot;only general ignorance of his work has kept him from being pressed into contemporary service as a literary environmentalist—not just a &#x27;conservationist,&#x27; in the mode, but an emerald-Green decrier of internal combustion&quot;:

The automobile, whose production was centered in Indianapolis before World War I, became the snorting, belching villain that, along with soft coal, laid waste to Tarkington&#x27;s Edens. His objections to the auto were aesthetic—in &quot;The Midlander&quot; (1923) automobiles sweep away the more beautifully named &quot;phaetons&quot; and &quot;surreys&quot;—but also something far beyond that. Dreiser, his exact Indiana contemporary, might look at the Model T and see wage slaves in need of unions and sit-down strikes; Tarkington saw pollution, and a filthy tampering with human nature itself. &quot;No one could have dreamed that our town was to be utterly destroyed,&quot; he wrote in &quot;The World Does Move&quot;. His important novels are all marked by the soul-killing effects of smoke and asphalt and speed, and even in &quot;Seventeen&quot;, Willie Baxter fantasizes about winning Miss Pratt by the rescue of precious little Flopit from an automobile&#x27;s rushing wheels.

In June 2019, the Library of America published &quot;Booth Tarkington: Novels &amp; Stories&quot;, collecting &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot;, &quot;Alice Adams&quot;, and &quot;In the Arena: Stories of Political Life&quot;.

<doc id="162443" wikidata="Q3484299" url="?curid=162443" title="Simon Hawke">
<text>Simon Hawke (born September 30, 1951) is an American author of mainly science fiction and fantasy novels. He was born Nicholas Valentin Yermakov, but began writing as Simon Hawke in 1984 and later changed his legal name to Hawke. He has also written near future adventure novels under the pen name J. D. Masters and a series of humorous mystery novels. He was the Colorado Writer of the Year, 1992.

==Career==
As Nicholas Yermakov (he is half-Russian), his early books were published in 1981–1984, including two &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; novelizations. Since re-launching his career as Simon Hawke in 1984, he has produced a large volume of lighter fiction. Almost all of his books published after 1984 have been either part of a series and/or tie-in novels and novelizations.

His first major work as Simon Hawke was the &quot;Timewars&quot; series, which recounts the adventures of an organization tasked with protecting history from being changed by time travellers. In the world of the series, many people and events we consider fictional are historical, and vice versa; the action of each book in the series weaves in and out of the events of a famous work of literature. For example, in the first book in the series time travellers contesting the fate of Richard I of England become caught up in Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;.

He has also written a series of humorous murder mysteries which features a young William Shakespeare and a fictional friend, Symington &quot;Tuck&quot; Smythe.

In 2017, he received the Phoenix Award from DeepSouthCon 55.

<text>Cadet Kelly is a 2002 American military comedy film released as a Disney Channel Original Movie and starring Hilary Duff and Christy Carlson Romano. The film premiered with 7.8 million viewers. It is Duff&#x27;s second starring film role, her first being &quot;Casper Meets Wendy&quot;. This was Disney Channel&#x27;s second film filmed in Canada.

==Plot==
Kelly Collins (Hilary Duff), is a free-spirited high schooler whose mother marries Brigadier General Joe &quot;Sir&quot; Maxwell (Gary Cole). When her new stepfather becomes the Commandant of a military school, George Washington Military Academy, Kelly and her mom move upstate. Kelly has to enroll at the school, since it is the only school in the area, leaving behind her art school and her best friend Amanda (Sarah Gadon). On her first day at military school, she befriends Carla (Andrea Lewis), a girl who has been there for a long time and shows her the ropes. Kelly, at first, has trouble fitting in and obeying the orders of the officers above her, especially Cadet Captain Jennifer Stone (Christy Carlson Romano), who has a crush on Cadet Major Brad Rigby (Shawn Ashmore). Kelly feels drawn to Brad instantly, and competes with Captain Stone for his attention. Captain Stone does not treat Kelly well, verbally abusing her by calling her &quot;maggot&quot; and destroying her personal belongings. 

After taking a long time to complete an obstacle course, Captain Stone has Kelly take the course again. After getting all dirty from the course and finishing it, Kelly heads to the dance, but accidentally stumbles and ruins Captain Stone&#x27;s dress at the dance, much to her anger. Her stepfather talks to Kelly in his office about the incident and what the teachers are saying about her. At home, Kelly is ready to tell her mom about her feelings and opinions of the new school, but before she could even start, her mother reveals to her that Kelly is going to have a half-sibling. Seeing that her mom needs her support, she vows to help her stepfather learn how to take care of a child and make him &quot;ready&quot; to be a dad. To get back at Captain Stone for destroying one of her blankets, Kelly decides to paint Stone&#x27;s hair in the middle of the night as payback, in the same pattern as a blanket that Stone ruined.

The next day, Captain Stone gives Kelly a citation, so she is forced to appear in Cadet Court. In Cadet Court, she is found guilty of many infractions. She is sentenced by her stepfather to take care of and shine the uniforms of the drill team, which she had, earlier in the film, referred to as a team of robots. However, she gradually takes a liking to them and decides to try out for the team, seeing that they need some inspiration. With the help of another friend of hers, Gloria (Aimee Garcia), she practices enough and makes to the team.

After Kelly was following some moves that Captain Stone was practicing, Cadet Major Rigby made the suggestion that they could incorporate the moves into a routine for regionals. Kelly asks Captain Stone if they could work on a routine together for regionals, and Captain Stone agrees to discuss it with her. Kelly&#x27;s team makes it to the regionals, which will be held at a different school. Kelly&#x27;s dad surprises her by revealing that he will be working a job nearby, and can make it to the regionals to see her perform. The day of the competition, however, he does not show up and Kelly begins to worry. Her stepfather notices that she is distressed and asks her to explain the situation to him. Kelly tells him that she has received a phone call from her father that was cut off, which she finds strange. She refers to her cell phone as her and her father&#x27;s &quot;lifeline&quot;, and says that he would only call if it was an absolute emergency. Seeing that Kelly needs help, he excuses her from the competition and goes with her to the location her father said he would be. They find him on a cliff, as he has fallen down. Kelly doesn&#x27;t want to leave him alone, so she uses her new training to rappel down the cliffside and stay by her father. Joe calls for help, and a rescue team arrives to bring him and Kelly back up. After her stepfather hugs her instead of saluting her, Kelly realizes that Joe has become more fatherly, she tells both of her dads that she is proud to be their daughter.

Kelly runs back to the competition to find that they are down by five points. The only chance they have of winning is a special routine that Kelly and Stone had been practicing. They perform it, and receive excellent marks from the reviewing board. George Washington places second, the best they have ever done, by one point. Stone tells Kelly that if she hadn&#x27;t joined the team, they never would have made it that far. Kelly, overjoyed to hear Stone praise her for once, gives her a hug, which she is surprised by, but returns anyway. Kelly vows that they will win next year as long as she and Stone keep practicing their routine, but Stone reveals that she&#x27;s moving to Europe because her father, who is in the Army, has been transferred there. Stone tells Kelly that she&#x27;d like for Kelly to one day become a platoon leader and have to deal with a &quot;maggot&quot; just like her. The drill team then faces Joe who salutes them for a job well done and Kelly smiles and salutes him alone, which he returns.
