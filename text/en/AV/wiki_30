==Billboard Top popular records of 1968==

The 1968 Billboard year-end list is composed of records that entered the Billboard Hot 100 during November–December 1967 (only when the majority of chart weeks were in 1968), January to November–December 1968 (majority of chart weeks in 1968). Records with majority of chart weeks in 1967 or 1969 are included in the year-end charts for those years, respectively, and multiple appearances are not permitted. Each week thirty points were awarded to the number one record, then nineteen points for number two, eighteen points for number three, and so on. The total points a record earned determined its year-end rank. The complete chart life of each record is represented. There are no ties, even when multiple records have the same number of points. The next ranking category is peak chart position, then weeks at peak chart position, weeks in top ten, weeks in top forty, and finally weeks on Hot 100 chart.

The chart can be sorted by Artist, Song title, Recording and Release dates, Cashbox year-end ranking (CB) or units sold (sales) by clicking on the column header. Additional details for each record can be accessed by clicking on the song title, and referring to the Infobox in the right column of the song page. Billboard also has chart summaries on its website. Cashbox rankings were derived by same process as the Billboard rankings. Sales information was derived from the RIAA&#x27;s Gold and Platinum database, the BRIT Certified database and The Book of Golden Discs, but numbers listed should be regarded as estimates. Grammy Hall of Fame and National Recording Registry information with sources can be found on Wikipedia.

<text>The Bureau of Naval Personnel (BUPERS) in the United States Department of the Navy is similar to the human resources department of a corporation. The bureau provides administrative leadership and policy planning for the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) and the U.S. Navy at large. BUPERS is led by the Chief of Naval Personnel (CHNAVPERS), who serves in an additional duty capacity as the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Personnel, Manpower, and Training (DCNO N1).

As of 2024, the Bureau of Naval Personnel serves as an echelon II parent command to Navy Personnel Command (NAVPERSCOM). Commander, Navy Personnel Command (COMNAVPERSCOM) is assigned additional duty as the Deputy Chief of Naval Personnel (DEP CHNAVPERS). Most BUPERS offices are located in Millington, Tennessee, with a small BUPERS staff directly supporting the CHNAVPERS in Arlington County, Virginia.

==History==
Naval personnel matters were originally handled by the Secretary of War until the establishment of the Navy Department on April 30, 1798. It was not until 1815 that the Secretary of the Navy took control of personnel matters. In 1861, the Office of Detail was created and functions related to the detailing of officers and the appointment and instruction of volunteer officers, as well as the purchase of ships and related matters were transferred. The Bureau of Equipment and Recruiting was concurrently established to handle enlisted recruiting and service record maintenance. 

The Bureau of Navigation was established in 1862 and three years later the Office of Detail was placed under it. In 1889, the Bureau of Equipment and Recruiting transferred its enlisted personnel activities to the Bureau of Navigation as well. On May 13, 1942, the command&#x27;s name changed to the Bureau of Naval Personnel, and in 1982 it changed to Naval Military Personnel Command. In 1991, the name changed back to the Bureau of Naval Personnel or &quot;BUPERS&quot; for short.

In the late 1990s, BUPERS relocated to Millington, Tennessee, based on the Defense Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC) Commission recommendations. DEP CHNAVPERS relocated to Millington as well and assumed primary duties as COMNAVPERSCOM. A support staff remained in the Washington, D.C. area to support CHNAVPERS. As a result of the Navy acting on the BRAC Commission recommendation, CHNAVPERS and DEP CHNAVPERS reside in separate locations.

<text>Dreamcatcher is a 2001 science fiction horror novel by American writer Stephen King, featuring elements of body horror, suspense and alien invasion. The book, written in longhand, helped the author recuperate from a 1999 car accident, and was completed in half a year. According to the author in his afterword, the working title was &quot;Cancer&quot;. His wife, Tabitha King, persuaded him to change the title. A film adaptation was released in 2003.

King has since soured on the book, as, in 2014, he told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that &quot;I don&#x27;t like &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; very much,&quot; and also stated that the book was written under the influence of Oxycontin, which he was on to control the pain from his accident.

==Plot summary==
Set near the fictional town of Derry, Maine, &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is the story of four lifelong friends: Gary &quot;Jonesy&quot; Jones, Pete Moore, Joe &quot;Beaver&quot; Clarendon and Henry Devlin. As young teenagers, the four saved Douglas &quot;Duddits&quot; Cavell, an older boy with Down syndrome, from a group of sadistic bullies. From their new friendship with Duddits, Jonesy, Beaver, Henry and Pete began to share the boy&#x27;s unusual powers, including telepathy, shared dreaming and seeing &quot;the line,&quot; a psychic trace left by the movement of human beings.

Jonesy, Beaver, Henry and Pete reunite for their annual hunting trip at the Hole-in-the-Wall, an isolated lodge in the Jefferson Tract. There, they unwittingly become caught between an alien invasion and an insane retired Air Force colonel, Abraham Kurtz. Jonesy and Beaver, who remain at the cabin while Henry and Pete go out for supplies, encounter Richard McCarthy, a disoriented and delirious stranger wandering near the lodge during a blizzard talking about lights in the sky. The victim of an alien abduction, McCarthy grows sicker and dies while sitting on the toilet. An extraterrestrial parasite eats its way out of his anus, after gestating in his bowel, and attacks the two men, killing Beaver. Jonesy inhales the spores of the strange reddish fungus that the stranger and his parasite have spread around the cabin, and an alien entity (&quot;Mr. Gray&quot;) takes over his mind.

On the return trip from their supply run, Henry and Pete encounter a woman from the same hunting party as McCarthy. She is also delirious and infected with a parasite. After crashing their car, Henry leaves Pete with the woman and attempts to return to the cabin by foot. From there, his telepathic senses let him know that Pete is in trouble, Beaver is dead and Jonesy is no longer Jonesy. Mr. Gray, manipulating Jonesy&#x27;s body, is attempting to leave the area. The aliens have attempted to infect Earth multiple times, beginning with the Roswell incident in 1947, but environmental factors have always stopped them, and the U.S. government has covered up the failed invasion attempts every time. With the infection of Jonesy, who can contain the alien within his mind and also spread the infection, Mr. Gray has become the perfect Typhoid Mary—and he knows it. Mr. Gray hijacks a truck transporting a spore-filled alien corpse while Jonesy, trapped inside a mental stronghold, is powerless to stop him.

It becomes up to Henry—by now a quarantined prisoner of the Army—to convince the military to go after Jonesy/Mr. Gray before it&#x27;s too late. Jonesy himself, now a prisoner in his own mind, tries to help. Both of them are convinced that their old friend Duddits may be the key to saving the world. Using telepathic powers gained from the alien fungus, Henry alerts Army officer Owen Underhill of a plan by Kurtz to kill most of the Army personnel to maintain secrecy. The two stage an escape by telepathically inciting a riot among other prisoners, destroying the base in the process. As they flee, the pair is closely pursued by a vengeful Kurtz along with his subordinates Freddy and Perlmutter. Perlmutter is infected with a telepathic parasite and is being used to track Owen and Mr. Gray down, despite his personal reluctance and pain. 

Owen and Henry follow Jonesy/Mr. Gray to Derry and along the way share their childhood memories, including a time when Duddits and his friends tracked down a missing girl. They unite with Duddits, who is very sick with leukemia. After a tear-filled goodbye with Duddits&#x27; mother, the trio use Duddits&#x27; powers to follow Jonesy/Mr. Gray southward to Quabbin Reservoir. Mr. Gray intends to infect the local water supply using a dog he has infected with the spores, giving it a parasite. Jonesy is able to slow down Mr. Gray&#x27;s progress considerably by getting the presence to strongly crave bacon, which it eats raw after obtaining it from a convenience store. The uncooked meat greatly sickens Jonesy&#x27;s body, giving the trio just enough time to catch up and confront Mr. Gray at the reservoir. 

Using the last of his powers, Duddits helps Henry and Jonesy mentally overcome Mr. Gray as well as help Owen shoot the parasite that emerges from the dog. Duddits dies from the effort but has prevented Mr. Gray&#x27;s plans. Kurtz and his men arrive, leaving the infected soldier in their vehicle. They ambush and fatally shoot Owen, but Kurtz is killed by Freddy, who fears that Kurtz will shoot him next. Freddy flees, returning to their vehicle, but is killed by the parasite that was growing inside the now-deceased Perlmutter&#x27;s body. Exhausted and half-insane, Henry sets the vehicle on fire by shooting its gas tank, destroying the last of the alien presence on earth. He reunites with Jonesy, who passes out from exhaustion.

Months later, Jonesy and Henry reminisce about their time in an underground military compound where they were held following the events at the reservoir. It is revealed that Jonesy was immune to the alien fungus all along, and Mr. Gray was only able to take over his mind because he believed it could—the idea being caught as in a dreamcatcher.

<text>Walter Richard Sickert (31 May 1860 – 22 January 1942) was a German-born British painter and printmaker who was a member of the Camden Town Group of Post-Impressionist artists in early 20th-century London. He was an important influence on distinctively British styles of avant-garde art in the mid and late 20th century.

Sickert was a cosmopolitan and an eccentric who often favoured ordinary people and urban scenes as his subjects. His work includes portraits of well-known personalities and images derived from press photographs. He is considered a prominent figure in the transition from Impressionism to Modernism.

Decades after his death, several authors and researchers theorised that Sickert might have been the London-based serial killer Jack the Ripper, but the claim has largely been dismissed.

==Training and early career==
Sickert was born in Munich, Kingdom of Bavaria, on 31 May 1860, the eldest son of Oswald Sickert, a Danish artist, and his English wife, Eleanor Louisa Henry, who was the illegitimate daughter of the astronomer Richard Sheepshanks. In 1868, following the German annexation of Schleswig-Holstein, the family settled in England, where Oswald&#x27;s work had been recommended by Freiherrin Rebecca von Kreusser to Ralph Nicholson Wornum, who was Keeper of the National Gallery at the time. The family eventually settled in London and obtained British nationality.

The young Sickert was sent to University College School from 1870 to 1871, before transferring to King&#x27;s College School, where he studied until the age of 18. Though he was the son and grandson of painters, he first sought a career as an actor; he appeared in small parts in Sir Henry Irving&#x27;s company, before taking up the study of art in 1881. After less than a year&#x27;s attendance at the Slade School, Sickert left to become a pupil of and etching assistant to James Abbott McNeill Whistler. Sickert&#x27;s earliest paintings were small tonal studies painted alla prima from nature after Whistler&#x27;s example.
In 1883 he travelled to Paris and met Edgar Degas, whose use of pictorial space and emphasis on drawing would have a powerful effect on Sickert&#x27;s work. &quot;Degas provided the counterweight to Whistler, and one which was eventually to prove the more significant for Sickert&#x27;s development.&quot; He developed a personal version of Impressionism, favouring sombre colouration. Following Degas&#x27; advice, Sickert painted in the studio, working from drawings and memory as an escape from &quot;the tyranny of nature&quot;. In 1888 Sickert joined the New English Art Club, a group of French-influenced realist artists. Sickert&#x27;s first major works, dating from the late 1880s, were portrayals of scenes in London music halls. One of the two paintings he exhibited at the NEAC in April 1888, &quot;Katie Lawrence at Gatti&#x27;s&quot;, which portrayed a well known music hall singer of the era, incited controversy &quot;more heated than any other surrounding an English painting in the late 19th century&quot;. Sickert&#x27;s rendering was denounced as ugly and vulgar, and his choice of subject matter was deplored as too tawdry for art, as female performers were popularly viewed as morally akin to prostitutes. The painting announced what would be Sickert&#x27;s recurring interest in sexually provocative themes.

In the late 1880s he spent much of his time in France, especially in Dieppe, which he first visited in mid-1885, and where his mistress, and possibly his illegitimate son, lived. During this period Sickert began writing art criticism for various publications, including Herbert Vivian and Ruaraidh Erskine&#x27;s &quot;The Whirlwind&quot;. Between 1894 and 1904, Sickert made a series of visits to Venice, initially focusing on the city&#x27;s topography; it was during his last painting trip in 1903–04 that, forced indoors by inclement weather, he developed a distinctive approach to the multiple-figure tableau that he further explored on his return to Britain. The models for many of the Venetian paintings are believed to have been prostitutes, whom Sickert might have known through being a client.
Sickert&#x27;s fascination with urban culture accounted for his acquisition of studios in working-class sections of London, first in Cumberland Market in the 1890s, then in Camden Town in 1905. The latter location provided an event that would secure Sickert&#x27;s prominence in the realist movement in Britain.

On 11 September 1907, Emily Dimmock, a prostitute cheating on her partner, was murdered in her home at Agar Grove (then St Paul&#x27;s Road), Camden. After sexual intercourse the man had slit her throat open while she was asleep, then left in the morning. The Camden Town murder became an ongoing source of prurient sensationalism in the press. For several years Sickert had already been painting lugubrious female nudes on beds, and continued to do so, deliberately challenging the conventional approach to life painting—&quot;The modern flood of representations of vacuous images dignified by the name of &#x27;the nude&#x27; represents an artistic and intellectual bankruptcy&quot;—giving four of them, which included a male figure, the title &quot;The Camden Town Murder&quot;, and causing a controversy which ensured attention for his work. These paintings do not show violence, however, but a sad thoughtfulness, explained by the fact that three of them were originally exhibited with completely different titles, one more appropriately being &quot;What Shall We Do for the Rent?&quot;, and the first in the series, &quot;Summer Afternoon&quot;.

While the painterly handling of the works inspired comparison to Impressionism, and the emotional tone suggested a narrative more akin to genre painting, specifically Degas&#x27;s &quot;Interior&quot;, the documentary realism of the &quot;Camden Town&quot; paintings was without precedent in British art. These and other works were painted in heavy impasto and narrow tonal range. Sickert&#x27;s best-known work, &quot;Ennui&quot; (), reveals his interest in Victorian narrative genres. The composition, which exists in at least five painted versions and was also made into an etching, depicts a couple in a dingy interior gazing abstractedly into empty space, &quot;psychologically estranged from one another&quot;.

Just before the First World War he championed the avant-garde artists Lucien Pissarro, Jacob Epstein, Augustus John and Wyndham Lewis. At the same time Sickert founded, with other artists, the Camden Town Group of British painters, named from the district of London in which he lived. This group had been meeting informally since 1905, but was officially established in 1911. It was influenced by Post-Impressionism and Expressionism, but concentrated on scenes of often drab suburban life; Sickert himself said he preferred the kitchen to the drawing room as a scene for paintings.

From 1908 to 1912, and again from 1915 to 1918, he was an influential teacher at Westminster School of Art, where David Bomberg, Wendela Boreel, Mary Godwin and John Doman Turner were among his students. He founded a private art school, Rowlandson House, in the Hampstead Road in 1910. It lasted until 1914; for most of that period its co-principal and chief financial supporter was the painter Sylvia Gosse, a former student of Sickert. He also briefly set up an art school in Manchester where his students included Harry Rutherford.

==Late period==
After the death of his second wife in 1920, Sickert relocated to Dieppe, where he painted scenes of casinos and café life until his return to London in 1922. In 1924, he was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy (ARA).

In 1926 he suffered an illness, thought to have been a minor stroke. In 1927, he abandoned his first name in favour of his middle name, and thereafter chose to be known as Richard Sickert. His style and subject matter also changed: Sickert stopped drawing, and instead painted from snapshots usually taken by his third wife, Thérèse Lessore, or from news photographs. The photographs were squared up for enlargement and transferred to canvas, with their pencil grids plainly visible in the finished paintings.

Seen by many of his contemporaries as evidence of the artist&#x27;s decline, Sickert&#x27;s late works are also his most forward-looking, and prefigure the practices of Chuck Close and Gerhard Richter. Other paintings from Sickert&#x27;s late period were adapted from illustrations by Victorian artists such as Georgie Bowers and John Gilbert. Sickert, separating these illustrations from their original context and painting them in poster-like colours so that the narrative and spatial intelligibility partly dissolved, called the resulting works his &quot;English Echoes&quot;.

Sickert painted an informal portrait of Winston Churchill in about 1927. Churchill&#x27;s wife Clementine introduced him to Sickert, who had been a friend of her family. The two men got along so well that Churchill, whose hobby was painting, wrote to his wife that &quot;He is really giving me a new lease of life as a painter.&quot;

Sickert tutored and mentored students of the East London Group, and exhibited alongside them at The Lefevre Gallery in November 1929.

Sickert made his last etching in 1929.Sickert was President of the Royal Society of British Artists from 1928 to 1930. He became a Royal Academician (RA) in March 1934 but resigned from the Academy on 9 May 1935 in protest against the president&#x27;s refusal to support the preservation of Jacob Epstein&#x27;s sculptural reliefs on the British Medical Association building in the Strand. In the last decade of his life, he depended increasingly on assistants, especially his wife, for the execution of his paintings.

One of Sickert&#x27;s closest friends and supporters was newspaper baron Lord Beaverbrook, who accumulated the largest single collection of Sickert paintings in the world. This collection, with a private correspondence between Sickert and Beaverbook, is in the Beaverbrook Art Gallery in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada. In addition to having painted Beaverbrook, Sickert painted portraits of notables including Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies, Hugh Walpole, Valentine Browne, 6th Earl of Kenmare, and less formal depictions of Aubrey Beardsley, King George V, and Peggy Ashcroft.

==Personal life==
Sickert married three times: to Ellen Melicent Cobden, a daughter of Richard Cobden from 1885 until their divorce in 1899; to Christine Angus from 1911 until her death in 1920; and to the painter Thérèse Lessore from 1926 until his death.

Sickert&#x27;s sister was Helena Swanwick, a feminist and pacifist active in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement.

==Death==
Sickert died in Bath, Somerset in 1942, at the age of 81. He had spent much time in the city in his later years, and many of his paintings depict Bath&#x27;s varied street scenes. He is buried in the churchyard of the Church of St Nicholas, Bathampton.

==Style and subjects==

For his earliest paintings, Sickert followed Whistler&#x27;s practice of rapid, wet-in-wet execution using very fluid paint. He subsequently adopted a more deliberate procedure of painting pictures in multiple stages, and &quot;attached a great deal of importance to what he called the &#x27;cooking&#x27; side of painting&quot;. He preferred to paint not from nature but from drawings or, after the mid-1920s, from photographs or from popular prints by Victorian illustrators. After transferring the design to canvas by the use of a grid, Sickert made a rapid underpainting using two colours, which was allowed to dry thoroughly before the final colours were applied. He experimented tirelessly with the details of his method, always with the goal, according to his biographer Wendy Baron, of &quot;paint[ing] quickly, in about two sittings, with the maximum economy and minimum of fuss&quot;.

Sickert tended to paint his subjects in series. He is identified particularly with domestic interior scenes, scenes of Venice, music hall and theatre scenes, and portraits. He painted very few still lifes. For his music hall subjects, Sickert often chose complex and ambiguous points of view, so that the spatial relationship between the audience, performer and orchestra becomes confused, as figures gesture into space and others are reflected in mirrors. The isolated rhetorical gestures of singers and actors seem to reach out to no-one in particular, and audience members are portrayed stretching and peering to see things that lie beyond the visible space. This theme of confused or failed communication between people appears frequently in his art. By emphasising the patterns of wallpaper and architectural decorations, Sickert created abstract decorative arabesques and flattened the three-dimensional space. His music hall pictures, like Degas&#x27; paintings of dancers and café-concert entertainers, connect the artificiality of art itself to the conventions of theatrical performance and painted backdrops.

Sickert often professed his distaste for what he termed the &quot;beastly&quot; character of thickly textured paint. In an article he wrote for &quot;The Fortnightly Review&quot; in 1911, he described his reaction to the paintings of Van Gogh: &quot;I execrate his treatment of the instrument I love, these strips of metallic paint that catch the light like so many dyed straws ... my teeth are set on edge&quot;. In response to Alfred Wolmark&#x27;s work he declared that &quot;thick oil-paint is the most undecorative matter in the world&quot;.

Nonetheless, Sickert&#x27;s paintings of the &quot;Camden Town Murder&quot; series of were painted in heavy impasto and narrow tonal range, as were numerous other obese nudes in the pre-World War I period in which the fleshiness of the figures is connected to the thickness of the paint—a device that was later adapted by Lucian Freud. The influence of these paintings on successive generations of British artists has been noted in the works of Freud, David Bomberg, Francis Bacon, Frank Auerbach, Howard Hodgkin, and Leon Kossoff.

In the 1910s and 1920s, the dark, gloomy tones of his early paintings gradually brightened, and Sickert juxtaposed unexpected tones with a new boldness in works such as &quot;Brighton Pierrots&quot; (1915) and &quot;Portrait of Victor Lecourt&quot; (1921–24). His several self-portraits usually displayed an element of role-playing consistent with his early career as an actor: &quot;Lazarus Breaks his Fast&quot; () and &quot;The Domestic Bully&quot; () are examples. Sickert&#x27;s late works display his preference for thinly scrubbed veils of paint, described by Helen Lessore as &quot;a cool colour rapidly brushed over a warm underpainting (or vice versa) on a coarse canvas and in a restricted range allow[ing] the undercoat to &#x27;grin through&#x27;&quot;.

Sickert insisted on the importance of subject matter in art, saying that &quot;all the greater draughtsmen tell a story&quot;, but treated his subjects in a detached manner. Max Kozloff wrote: &quot;How not to say too much seems to have become a matter of utmost laborious concern for Sickert&quot;, as evidenced by his paintings&#x27; studied lack of finish and &quot;neurasthenic sobriety&quot; of color. According to the painter Frank Auerbach, &quot;Sickert&#x27;s detachment became increasingly evident in his uninhibited procedures. He made obvious his frequent reliance on snapshots and press photographs, he copied, used and took over the work of other, dead, artists and made extensive use, also, of the services of his assistants who played a large and increasing part in the production of his work.&quot;

==Jack the Ripper==


Sickert took a keen interest in the crimes of Jack the Ripper and believed he had lodged in a room used by the notorious serial killer. He had been told this by his landlady, who suspected a previous lodger who stayed there in 1881. Sickert did a painting of the room in 1905–1907 and titled it &quot;Jack the Ripper&#x27;s Bedroom&quot; (Manchester Art Gallery). It shows a dark, melancholy room with most details obscured. It suggests his morbid interest in the subject.

Although for over 80 years there was no mention of Sickert being a suspect in the Ripper crimes, in the 1970s authors began to explore the idea that Sickert was Jack the Ripper or his accomplice. Sickert is not considered a serious suspect by most who study the case, and strong evidence shows he spent most of 1888 outside the UK, and was in France at the time of most of the Ripper murders.

==Personal papers==
Walter Sickert&#x27;s personal papers are held at Islington Local History Centre. Additional papers are held at several other archives, particularly the Tate Gallery Archive. The Walker Art Gallery holds the largest collection of his drawings, a total of 348.

==Retrospectives==
In 2021–2022, a retrospective exhibition &quot;Sickert: A Life in Art&quot; at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, displayed around 100 of Sickert&#x27;s paintings and 200 drawings, claiming to be the largest retrospective of the artist&#x27;s work to have been held in the UK for more than 30 years. The art critic Jonathan Jones noted: &quot;This baffling man who was born in Munich in 1860, emigrated to Britain as a child and became one of our greatest and weirdest artists, emerges in this excellent show as even odder than I thought. In that unsettling way of seeing lies his modernity.&quot;

From 28 April to 18 September 2022, Tate Britain staged the first major Sickert retrospective at Tate in over 60 years, featuring over 150 of his works from over 70 public and private collections, and claiming to be the most extensive retrospective in almost 30 years. The exhibition was organised in collaboration with the Petit Palais, Paris, where it is expected to be displayed between late 2022 and 2023. Jonathan Jones observed, &quot;This hellishly brilliant exhibition takes you to a place beyond simple moral or political truth. Whatever Sickert was, he was the only British artist of his time who can be as powerful as Munch, Van Gogh or Otto Dix.&quot;

<doc id="160434" wikidata="Q182012" url="?curid=160434" title="Lockheed C-5 Galaxy">
<text>The Lockheed C-5 Galaxy is a large military transport aircraft designed and built by Lockheed, and now maintained and upgraded by its successor, Lockheed Martin. It provides the United States Air Force (USAF) with a heavy intercontinental-range strategic airlift capability, one that can carry outsized and oversized loads, including all air-certifiable cargo. The Galaxy has many similarities to the smaller Lockheed C-141 Starlifter and the later Boeing C-17 Globemaster III. The C-5 is among the largest military aircraft in the world.

The C-5 Galaxy&#x27;s development was complicated, including significant cost overruns, and Lockheed suffered significant financial difficulties. Shortly after entering service, cracks in the wings of many aircraft were discovered and the C-5 fleet was restricted in capability until corrective work was completed. The C-5M Super Galaxy is an upgraded version with new engines and modernized avionics designed to extend its service life to 2040 and beyond.

The USAF has operated the C-5 since 1969. In that time, the airlifter supported US military operations in all major conflicts including Vietnam, Iraq, Yugoslavia, and Afghanistan, as well as allied support, such as Israel during the Yom Kippur War and operations in the Gulf War. The Galaxy has also distributed humanitarian aid, provided disaster relief, and supported the US space program.

==Development==
===CX-4 and Heavy Logistics System===

In 1961, several aircraft companies began studying heavy jet transport designs that would replace the Douglas C-133 Cargomaster and complement Lockheed C-141 Starlifters. In addition to higher overall performance, the United States Army wanted a transport aircraft with a larger cargo bay than the C-141, whose interior was too small to carry a variety of their outsized equipment. This need led to the CX-4 requirement of July 1962, for which Lockheed, Boeing, Convair, and Douglas proposed six-engined designs. When the US Army judged the CX-4 specification inadequate for its requirements, by late 1963 the CX-4 specification gave way to the CX-HLC requirement specified an airlifter with four engines, an equipped gross weight of , a maximum payload of , and a speed of Mach 0.75 (). The cargo compartment was wide by high and long with front and rear access doors. USAF studies showed that high-bypass turbofan engines were needed for thrust and fuel efficiency requirements.
The criteria were finalized and an official request for proposal was issued in April 1964 for the &quot;Heavy Logistics System&quot; (CX-HLS) (previously CX-HLC). In May 1964, proposals for aircraft were received from Boeing, Douglas, General Dynamics, Lockheed, and Martin Marietta. General Electric, Curtiss-Wright, and Pratt &amp; Whitney submitted proposals for the engines. After a downselect, Boeing, Douglas, and Lockheed were given one-year study contracts for the airframe, along with General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney for the engines. All three of the designs shared a number of features. The cockpit was placed well above the cargo area to allow for cargo loading through a nose door. The Boeing and Douglas designs used a pod on the top of the fuselage containing the cockpit, while the Lockheed design extended the cockpit profile down the length of the fuselage, giving it an egg-shaped cross section. All of the designs had swept wings, as well as front and rear cargo doors, allowing simultaneous loading and unloading. Lockheed&#x27;s design featured a T-tail, while the designs by Boeing and Douglas had conventional tails.

The Air Force considered Boeing&#x27;s design to be better than that of Lockheed, but Lockheed&#x27;s proposal was the lowest total-cost bid. Lockheed was selected as the winner in September 1965, then awarded a contract in December 1965. General Electric&#x27;s TF39 engine was selected in August 1965 to power the new transport plane. At the time, GE&#x27;s engine concept was revolutionary, as all engines before had a bypass ratio less than two-to-one, while the TF39 promised and would achieve a ratio of eight-to-one, which had the benefits of increased engine thrust and lower fuel consumption. Boeing lost the military contract but went on to develop the successful 747 civilian airliner with over 1,500 aircraft built when manufacturing ended in 2022 after 54 years of production.

===Into production===
The first C-5A Galaxy (serial number &quot;66-8303&quot;) was rolled out of the manufacturing plant in Marietta, Georgia, on 2 March 1968. On 30 June 1968, flight testing of the C-5A began with the first flight, flown by Leo Sullivan, with the call sign &quot;eight-three-oh-three heavy&quot;. Flight tests revealed that the aircraft exhibited a higher drag divergence Mach number than predicted by wind tunnel data. The maximum lift coefficient measured in flight with the flaps deflected 40° was higher than predicted (2.60 vs. 2.38), but was lower than predicted with the flaps deflected 25° (2.31 vs. 2.38) and with the flaps retracted (1.45 vs. 1.52).

Aircraft weight was a serious issue during design and development. At the time of the first flight, the weight was below the guaranteed weight, but by the time of the delivery of the 9th aircraft, had exceeded guarantees. In July 1969, during a fuselage upbending test, the wing failed at 128% of limit load, which is below the requirement that it sustain 150% of limit load. Changes were made to the wing, but during a test in July 1970, it failed at 125% of limit load. A passive load-reduction system, involving uprigged ailerons, was incorporated, but the maximum allowable payload was reduced from . At the time, a 90% probability was predicted that no more than 10% of the fleet of 79 airframes would reach their fatigue life of 19,000 hours without cracking of the wing.

Cost overruns and technical problems of the C-5A were the subject of a congressional investigation in 1968 and 1969. The C-5 program has the dubious distinction of being the first development program with a $1billion (equivalent to $ billion today) overrun. Due to the C-5&#x27;s troubled development, the Department of Defense abandoned Total Package Procurement. In 1969, Henry Durham raised concerns about the C-5 production process with Lockheed, his employer. Subsequently, Durham was transferred and subjected to abuse until he resigned. The Government Accountability Office substantiated some of his charges against Lockheed. Later, the American Ethical Union honored Durham with the Elliott-Black Award. The Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Management Systems, Ernest Fitzgerald, was another person whose fostering of public accountability was unwelcome.

Upon completion of testing in December 1969, the first C-5A was transferred to the Transitional Training Unit at Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma. Lockheed delivered the first operational Galaxy to the 437th Airlift Wing, Charleston Air Force Base, South Carolina, in June 1970. Due to higher than expected development costs, in 1970, public calls were made for the government to split the substantial losses that Lockheed was experiencing. Production was nearly brought to a halt in 1971 as Lockheed went through financial difficulties, due in part to the C-5 Galaxy&#x27;s development, as well as a civilian jet liner, the Lockheed L-1011. The U.S. government gave loans to Lockheed to keep the company operational.

In the early 1970s, NASA considered the C-5 for the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft role, to transport the Space Shuttle to Kennedy Space Center. However, they rejected it in favor of the Boeing 747, in part due to the 747&#x27;s low-wing design. In contrast, the Soviet Union chose to transport its shuttles using the high-winged An-225, which derived from the An-124, which is similar in design and function to the C-5.

During static and fatigue testing, cracks were noticed in the wings of several aircraft, and as a consequence, the C-5A fleet was restricted to 80% of maximum design loads. To reduce wing loading, load alleviation systems were added to the aircraft. By 1980, payloads were restricted to as low as for general cargo during peacetime operations. A $1.5 billion program (equivalent to $ billion today), known as H-Mod, to re-wing the 76 completed C-5As to restore full payload capability and service life began in 1976. After design and testing of the new wing design, the C-5As received their new wings from 1980 to 1987.

===Restarted production and development===
In 1974, Imperial Iran, having good relations with the United States, offered $160 million (equivalent to $ million today) to restart C-5 production to enable Iran to purchase aircraft for their own air force, in a similar climate as to their acquisition of F-14 Tomcat fighters. However, no C-5s were ordered by Iran, and the prospect was firmly halted by the Iranian Revolution in 1979 when the Imperial State of Iran was replaced by the Islamic State of Iran.
As part of President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s military policy, funding was made available for expansion of the USAF&#x27;s airlift capability. With the C-17 program still some years from completion, Congress approved funding for a new version of the C-5, the C-5B, in July 1982, to expand airlift capacity. The first C-5B was delivered to Altus Air Force Base in January 1986. In April 1989, the last of 50 C-5B aircraft was added to the 77 C-5As in the Air Force&#x27;s airlift force structure. The C-5B includes all C-5A improvements and numerous additional system modifications to improve reliability and maintainability.

In 1998, the Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) began upgrading the C-5&#x27;s avionics to include a glass cockpit, navigation equipment, and a new autopilot system. Another part of the C-5 modernization effort is the Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program (RERP). The program replaced the engines with newer, more powerful ones.

A total of 52 C-5s were contracted to be modernized, consisting of 49 B-, two C- and one A-model aircraft through the RERP. The program featured over 70 changes and upgrades, including the newer General Electric engines. Three C-5s underwent RERP for testing purposes. Low-rate initial production started in August 2009 with Lockheed reaching full production in May 2011; 22 C-5M Super Galaxies have been completed as of August 2014. RERP upgrades were completed on 25 July 2018. The Air Force received the last modified aircraft on 1 August 2018.

In 2014 Lockheed investigated drag reduction by plasma-heating of turbulent transonic airflow in critical points, saving overall weight by reducing fuel consumption. The Air Force Research Laboratory looked into shape-memory alloy for speed-dependent vortex generators.

==Design==
The C-5 is a large, high-wing cargo aircraft with a distinctive high T-tail fin (vertical) stabilizer, with four TF39 turbofan engines mounted on pylons beneath wings that are swept 25°. (The C-5M uses newer GE CF6 engines.) Similar in layout to its smaller predecessor, the C-141 Starlifter, the C-5 has 12 internal wing tanks and is equipped for aerial refueling. Above the plane-length cargo deck is an upper deck for flight operations and for seating 80 passengers in rear facing seats (unlike most commercial airplanes) and the embarked loadmaster crew in forward facing seats. Bay doors at both nose and tail open to enable &quot;drive-through&quot; loading and unloading of cargo.

The cargo hold of the C-5 is longer than the entire length of the first powered flight by the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. For its voracious consumption of fuel and its maintenance and reliability issues the Galaxy&#x27;s aircrews have nicknamed it &quot;FRED&quot;, for Fucking Ridiculous Economic/Environmental Disaster.
Takeoff and landing distance requirements for the plane at maximum-load gross weight are and , respectively. Its high-flotation main landing gear provides 28 wheels to distribute gross weight on paved or earth surfaces. The rear main landing gear can be made to caster to make a smaller turning radius, and rotates 90° after takeoff before being retracted. &quot;Kneeling&quot; landing gear permits lowering the aircraft when parked, thereby presenting the cargo deck at truck-bed height to facilitate loading and unloading operations.

The C-5 features a malfunction detection analysis and recording system to identify errors throughout the aircraft.
The cargo compartment is long, high, and wide, or just over . It can accommodate up to 36 463L master pallets or a mix of palletized cargo and vehicles. The nose and aft cargo-bay doors open the full width and height of the cargo bay to maximize efficient loading of oversized equipment. Full-width ramps enable loading double rows of vehicles from either end of the cargo hold.

The C-5 Galaxy is capable of moving nearly every type of military combat equipment, including such bulky items as the Army armored vehicle launched bridge, at , from the United States to any location on the globe; and of accommodating up to six Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopters or five Bradley Fighting Vehicles at one time.

==Operational history==

The first C-5A was delivered to the USAF on 17 December 1969. Wings were built up in the early 1970s at Altus AFB, Oklahoma; Charleston AFB, South Carolina; Dover AFB, Delaware; and Travis AFB, California. The C-5&#x27;s first mission was on 9 July 1970, in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. C-5s were used to transport equipment and troops, including Army tanks and even some small aircraft, throughout the later years of the US action in Vietnam. In the final weeks of the war, prior to the Fall of Saigon, several C-5s were involved in evacuation efforts. During one such mission, a C-5A crashed while transporting a large number of orphans, with over 140 killed.

C-5s have also been used to deliver support and reinforce various US allies over the years. During the Yom Kippur War in 1973, multiple C-5s and C-141 Starlifters delivered critical supplies of ammunition, replacement weaponry and other forms of aid to Israel, the US effort was named as Operation Nickel Grass. The C-5 Galaxy&#x27;s performance in Israel was such that the Pentagon began to consider further purchases. The C-5 was regularly made available to support American allies, such as the British-led peacekeeper initiative in Zimbabwe in 1979.
On 24 October 1974, the Space and Missile Systems Organization successfully conducted an air-launched ballistic missile test, where a C-5A Galaxy aircraft air dropped an Minuteman ICBM from over the Pacific Ocean. The missile descended to before its rocket engine fired. The 10-second engine burn carried the missile to again before it dropped into the ocean. The test proved the feasibility of launching an intercontinental ballistic missile from the air. Operational deployment was discarded due to engineering and security difficulties, though the capability was used as a negotiating point in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. Aircraft 69–0014, &quot;Zero-One-Four&quot; used in the test was retired to the Air Mobility Command Museum at Dover Air Force Base.
The C-5 has been used for several unusual functions. During the development of the secretive stealth aircraft, the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, Galaxies were often used to carry partly disassembled aircraft, leaving no exterior signs as to their cargo. The C-5 remains the largest aircraft to operate in the Antarctic, capable of operating from Williams Field near McMurdo Station. The C-5 Galaxy was a major supply asset in the international coalition operations in 1990–91 against Iraq in the Gulf War. C-5s have routinely delivered relief aid and humanitarian supplies to areas afflicted with natural disasters or crisis; multiple flights were made over Rwanda in 1994. The C-5 is also used to transport Marine One.

The wings on the C-5As were replaced during the 1980s to restore full design capability. The USAF took delivery of the first C-5B on 28 December 1985 and the final one in April 1989. The reliability of the C-5 fleet has been a continued issue throughout its lifetime, however the C-5M upgrade program seeks in part to address this issue. Their strategic airlift capacity has been a key logistical component of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Following an incident during Operation Iraqi Freedom where one C-5 was damaged by a projectile, the installation of defensive systems has become a stated priority.

The C-5 AMP and RERP modernization programs plan to raise mission-capable rate to a minimum goal of 75%. Over the next 40 years, the U.S. Air Force estimates the C-5M will save over $20 billion. The first C-5M conversion was completed on 16 May 2006 and C-5Ms began test flights at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in June 2006. In 2008, the USAF decided to convert remaining C-5Bs and C-5Cs into C-5Ms with avionics upgrades and re-engining. The C-5As will receive only the avionics upgrades. The last of 52 C-5Ms was delivered to Air Mobility Command in August 2018.
In response to Air Force plans to retire older C-5 aircraft, Congress implemented legislation that set limits on retirement plans for C-5As in 2003. As of November 2013, 45 C-5As have been retired, 11 have been scrapped, parts of one (A/C 66-8306) are now a cargo load trainer at Lackland AFB, Texas, and one was sent to the Warner Robins Air Logistics Center (WR-ALC) for tear down and inspection to evaluate structural integrity and estimate the remaining life for the fleet.

The U.S. Air Force began to receive refitted C-5M aircraft in December 2008. Full production of C-5Ms began in the summer of 2009. In 2009, the Congressional ban on the retirement of C-5s was overturned. The Air Force seeks to retire one C-5A for every 10 new C-17s ordered. In October 2011, the 445th Airlift Wing based at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base replaced all remaining C-5s with C-17s. The C-5M reached initial operating capability (IOC) on 24 February 2014 with 16 aircraft delivered.

On 13 September 2009, a C-5M set 41 new records and flight data was submitted to the National Aeronautic Association for formal recognition. The C-5M had carried a payload of to over in 23 minutes, 59 seconds. Additionally, 33 time to climb records at various payload classes were set, and the world record for greatest payload to was broken. The aircraft was in the category of with a takeoff weight of including payload, fuel, and other equipment.

On 18 July 2017, C-5s based at Dover were ordered to stand down so maintenance crews could determine the cause for some nose landing gear failing. The last TF39-powered C-5 flew in late 2017.

==Variants==
===C-5A===
The C-5A is the original version of the C-5. From 1969 to 1973, 81 C-5As were delivered to the Military Airlift Command of the U.S. Air Force. Due to cracks found in the wings in the mid-1970s, the cargo weight was restricted. To restore the C-5&#x27;s full capability, the wing structure was redesigned. A program to install new strengthened wings on 77 C-5As was conducted from 1981 to 1987. The redesigned wing made use of a new aluminum alloy that did not exist during the original production. As of August 2016, there were ten A-models in service flown by the Air Force Reserve Command&#x27;s 433d Airlift Wing at Lackland AFB / Kelly Field, Texas, and 439th Airlift Wing at Westover ARB, Massachusetts. The last operational C-5A was retired on 7 September 2017.

===C-5B===
The C-5B is an improved version of the C-5A. It incorporated all modifications and improvements made to the C-5A with improved wings, simplified landing gear, upgraded TF-39-GE-1C turbofan engines and updated avionics. Fifty examples of the new variant were delivered to the U.S. Air Force from 1986 to 1989.

===C-5C===
The C-5C is a specially modified variant for transporting large cargo. Two C-5As (68-0213 and 68-0216) were modified following major accidents to have a larger internal cargo capacity to accommodate large payloads, such as satellites. The major modifications were the removal of the rear passenger compartment floor, splitting the rear cargo door in the middle, and installing a new movable aft bulkhead further to the rear. The official C-5 technical manual refers to the version as C-5A(SCM) &quot;Space Cargo Modified&quot;. Modifications also included adding a second inlet for ground power, which can feed any power-dependent equipment that may form part of the cargo. The two C-5Cs are operated by U.S. Air Force crews for DOD spacecraft programs and NASA, and are stationed at Travis AFB, California. Both C-5Cs #68-0213 and #68-0216 have been modified into C-5Ms as of 2017.

===C-5D===
Proposed during the 1990s Non-Developmental Airlift Aircraft (NDAA) program as an alternative to further purchases of the McDonnell Douglas C-17 Globemaster III as well as a replacement for older C-5As. The C-5D was to have General Electric F138-GE-100 (CF6-80C2) engines, improved avionics and significantly improved reliability and maintainability, although it could not use austere runways or conduct airdrop operations and had a higher expected operating cost. The plan was canceled in favor of the purchase of more C-17s. The specifications of the C-5D were later used in the C-5M upgrade program.

===C-5 AMP and C-5M Super Galaxy===
Following a study showing that 80% of the C-5 airframe&#x27;s service life was remaining, Air Mobility Command (AMC) began an aggressive program to modernize all remaining C-5Bs and C-5Cs and many of the C-5As. The C-5 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) began in 1998 and includes upgrading the avionics to comply with Global Air Traffic Management standards, improving communications, fitting new flat-panel displays, improving navigation and safety equipment, and installing a new autopilot system. The first flight of a C-5 with AMP (85-0004) occurred on 21 December 2002.

The Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program (RERP) began in 2006. It includes fitting new General Electric F138-GE-100 (CF6-80C2) engines, pylons and auxiliary power units, and upgrades to aircraft skin and frame, landing gear, cockpit and pressurization systems. Each CF6 engine produces 22% more thrust (), providing a 30% shorter takeoff, a 38% higher climb rate to initial altitude, an increased cargo load and a longer range. Upgraded C-5s are designated &quot;C-5M Super Galaxy&quot;.

===L-500===
Lockheed also planned a civilian version of the C-5 Galaxy, the &quot;L-500&quot;, the company designation also used for the C-5 itself. Both passenger and cargo versions of the L-500 were designed. The all-passenger version would have been able to carry up to 1,000 travelers, while the all-cargo version was predicted to be able to carry typical C-5 volume for as little as 2 cents per ton-mile (in 1967 dollars). Although some interest was expressed by carriers, no orders were placed for either L-500 version, due to operational costs caused by low fuel efficiency, a significant concern for a profit-making carrier, even before the oil crisis of the 1970s, keen competition from Boeing&#x27;s 747, and high costs incurred by Lockheed in developing the C-5, and later the L-1011, which led to the governmental rescue of the company.

===C-5 Shuttle Carrier===
Lockheed proposed a twin body C-5 as a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft to counter the Conroy Virtus, but the design was turned down in favor of the Boeing 747.

==Incidents and accidents==


Three C-5 Galaxy aircraft have been lost in crashes along with two class-A losses resulting from ground fire, with a combined total of 169 fatalities. At least two other C-5 crashes have resulted in major airframe damage, but the aircraft were repaired and returned to service.

===Notable accidents===
* On 27 May 1970, C-5A AF Serial No. 67-0172 was destroyed during a ground fire at Palmdale, California, after an Air Turbine Motor started backwards and quickly overheated, setting the hydraulic system on fire and consuming the aircraft. The engines were not running at the time of the fire. Five crew escaped, and seven firefighters suffered minor injuries fighting the blaze.
* On 17 October 1970, C-5A AF Serial No. 66-8303 was destroyed during a ground fire at the Lockheed Aircraft plant at Dobbins AFB in Marietta, Georgia. The fire started during maintenance in one of the aircraft&#x27;s 12 fuel cells. One worker was killed and another injured. This was the first C-5 aircraft produced.
* On 27 September 1974, C-5A Serial No. 68-0227 crashed after over-running the runway at Clinton, Oklahoma, Municipal Airport during an emergency landing following a serious landing gear fire. The crew mistakenly aligned the aircraft for the visual approach into the wrong airport, landing at Clinton Municipal Airport, which has a runway, instead of the airfield at Clinton-Sherman Industrial Airpark (former Clinton-Sherman Air Force Base), which has a runway. This was the first operational loss of a C-5 Galaxy.
* On 4 April 1975, C-5A Serial No.68-0218 crashed while carrying orphans out of Vietnam during Operation Babylift. This accident is one of the most notorious C-5 accidents to date. The crash occurred while trying to make an emergency landing at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, Saigon, following a rear pressure door lock failure in flight. 144 people (including 78 children) were killed out of the 313 aboard (243 children, 44 escorts, 16 flight crew and 10 medical crew). Use of the C-5 was heavily restricted for several months following the high-profile accident.
* On 31 July 1983, C-5A Serial No. 70-0446 crashed while landing at the former Shemya Air Force Base on Shemya Island in Alaska. The C-5 approached below the glide slope in heavy fog, hit landing light poles and an embankment short of the runway, stopping at the 5,000-foot mark on the runway with the nose gear at the side of the runway embankment. Structural damage was extensive and the two aft main landing gear bogies were sheared from the aircraft. There were no fatalities. A joint USAF–Lockheed team made repairs, enabling a ferry flight from Shemya to the Lockheed plant in Marietta, Georgia, later that year. There, the aircraft was dubbed &quot;Phoenix II&quot; and permanent repair efforts got under way. In addition to the structural repairs, the aircraft also received an improved landing gear system (common to the then-new C-5B), wing modification, and a color weather radar upgrade. The aircraft was returned to service.
* In July 1983, C-5A Serial No. 68-0216 landed gear up at Travis Air Force Base, California. There were no injuries. The accident occurred while the crew was performing touch-and-go landings, and did not lower the landing gear during the final approach of the day. The aircraft received significant damage to the lower fuselage, ramp, clamshell doors, and main landing gear pods. The C-5A was later flown to Marietta for repairs. While there, the aircraft was selected to be the first C-5A converted to the C-5C configuration.
* On 29 August 1990, C-5A Serial No. 68-0228 crashed following an engine failure shortly after take-off. The aircraft took off from Ramstein Air Base in Germany in support of Operation Desert Shield. It was flown by a nine-member reserve crew from the 68th Airlift Squadron, 433d Airlift Wing based at Kelly AFB, Texas. As the aircraft started to climb off the runway, one of the thrust reversers suddenly deployed. This resulted in loss of control of the aircraft and the subsequent crash. Of the 17 people on board, only four survived the crash. All four were in the rear troop compartment. The sole crew member to survive, Staff Sgt. Lorenzo Galvan Jr., was awarded the Airman&#x27;s Medal for his actions in evacuating the survivors from the wreckage.
* On 3 April 2006, C-5B Serial No. 84-0059 crashed following a cockpit indication that the thrust reverser on No. 2 engine was not locked. The crew shut down No. 2 engine as a safeguard. The C-5B assigned to the 436th Airlift Wing and flown by a reserve crew from the 709th Airlift Squadron, 512th Airlift Wing crashed about short of the runway while attempting a heavyweight emergency landing at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware. The aircraft had taken off from Dover 21 minutes earlier and reported an in-flight emergency ten minutes into the flight. All 17 people aboard survived, but two received serious injuries. The Air Force&#x27;s accident investigation board report concluded the cause to be human error, in particular the crew had been manipulating the throttle of the (dead) number-two engine as if it were still running while keeping the (live) number-three engine at idle. The situation was further worsened by the crew&#x27;s decision to use a high flap setting that increased drag beyond normal two-engine capabilities. The aircraft was one of the first to receive the new avionics and glass flight displays for C-5 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP). This accident led to a redesign of the cockpit engine displays, particularly the visual indicators of a non-active engine. The aircraft was declared a total hull-loss and the airframe was scrapped, but the forward fuselage became a C-5 AMP test bed.

==Aircraft on display==
* C-5A, AF Ser. No. 70-0451, has been delivered to the Travis Air Force Base Heritage Center at Travis Air Force Base for future display. This is the penultimate operational C-5A, with the last operational C-5A delivered to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base for spare parts. However, as display space could not be found, it was decided to scrap the aircraft which is currently being conducted.
* C-5A, AF Ser. No. 69-0014, is on display at the Air Mobility Command Museum at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware. This is the first C-5 aircraft to go on museum display.

<text>Global air-traffic management (GATM) is a concept for satellite-based Communication, navigation and surveillance and air traffic management. The Federal Aviation Administration and the International Civil Aviation Organization, a specialized agency of the United Nations, established GATM standards to keep air travel safe and effective in increasingly crowded worldwide air space. Efforts are being made worldwide to test and implement new technologies that will allow GATM to efficiently support air traffic control.

Airservices Australia ADS-B initiative is one of the major implementation programs in this field. This initiative will facilitate the certification of this new technology allowing further implementation.

The two core satellite constellations are the Global Positioning System (GPS) of the US and the Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) of Russia/India. The third constellation will be the European Union Galileo system when it becomes fully operational. These systems provide independent capabilities and can be used in combination with future core constellations and augmentation systems. Signals from core satellite are received by ground reference stations and any errors in the signals are identified. Each station in the network relays the data to area-wide master stations where correction information for specific geographical areas is computed. The correction message is prepared and uplinked to a geostationary communication satellite (GEO) via a ground uplink station. This message is broadcast to receivers on board aircraft flying within the broadcast coverage area of the system. The system is known in the US as WAAS (Wide Area Augmentation System), in Europe as EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay System), in Japan as MSAS (MTSAT Satellite Based Augmentation System) and in India as GAGAN (GPS-aided geo-augmented navigation). 

The system employs various techniques to correct equatorial anomalies. The advantage of the system is, it is global in scope and it has the potential to support all phases of flight providing a seamless global navigation guidance. This could eliminate the need for a variety of ground and airborne systems that were designed to meet specific requirements for certain phases of flight.

Standard and recommended practices for the air traffic management based on a global navigation satellite system are developed by ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization). Thus the system has to meet ICAO standards to become operational.

<text>The Who Sell Out is the third studio album by the English rock band the Who. It was released on 15 December 1967 by Track Records in the UK and Decca Records in the US. A concept album, &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; is structured as a collection of unrelated songs interspersed with fake commercials and public service announcements, including the second track &quot;Heinz Baked Beans&quot;. The album purports to be a broadcast by pirate radio station Radio London. The reference to &quot;selling out&quot; was an intended irony, as the Who had been making real commercials during that period of their career, some of which are included as bonus tracks on the remastered CD.

The album was primarily written by guitarist Pete Townshend, though three tracks were penned by bassist John Entwistle and one by Thunderclap Newman vocalist Speedy Keen, who also sings. Townshend and Entwistle are joined by vocalist Roger Daltrey and drummer Keith Moon, and organist Al Kooper makes a guest appearance on two tracks. The album was produced by the band&#x27;s manager Kit Lambert.

The album&#x27;s release was reportedly followed by lawsuits due to the mention of real-world commercial interests in the &quot;faux&quot; commercials and on the album covers, and by the makers of the real jingles (Radio London jingles), who claimed the Who used them without permission (the jingles were produced by PAMS Productions of Dallas, Texas, which created thousands of station identification jingles in the 1960s and 1970s). The deodorant company Odorono took offence that Chris Stamp made a request for endorsement dollars. &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot; was the only song from the album released as a single and peaked at number 10 in the UK and number 9 in the US, becoming the band&#x27;s highest-charting single and only Top 10 hit in the latter region.

&quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; has received widespread acclaim from critics, some of whom viewed it as the Who&#x27;s best record. It has also frequently been featured on all-time lists of the best albums, including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. However, it was the band&#x27;s lowest-charting album on the UK Albums Chart, where it peaked at number 13.

==Background==
In his book &quot;Maximum R &amp; B&quot;, Who confidant Richard Barnes claims to have come up with the idea of the band recording commercial jingles after their cover of the &quot;Batman&quot; theme appeared on the &quot;Ready Steady Who&quot; EP. Barnes posited the idea to Roger Daltrey, whose similar suggestions to Pete Townshend were allegedly met with derision.

Initially, the band&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;A Quick One&quot; was to be titled &quot;Who&#x27;s Lily&quot; after their recent single &quot;Pictures of Lily&quot;. Early cuts such as a cover of &quot;Summertime Blues&quot;, the Coke jingles, and the instrumental &quot;Sodding About&quot;, showed the influence of Track Records label-mate Jimi Hendrix on Townshend&#x27;s guitar playing.

Even before the group had formed, the members of the Who had been profoundly influenced by rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll appearing on the radio. The BBC did not broadcast much contemporary music at the time, which was left to stations like Radio Luxembourg and then-pirate radio stations such as Radio Caroline, Radio Scotland and Wonderful Radio London. By the end of 1966, the Who had achieved commercial success owing to the mod movement that made up a significant section of the group&#x27;s early audience. However, the movement was fading, and the TV show &quot;Ready, Steady, Go&quot; that had boosted the group to fame had been cancelled. The group started touring the US the following year, and started to achieve success with their live act.

In summer 1967, the group&#x27;s managers Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp suggested the band could create a concept album based on pirate radio and structure it in the same manner as that, or a typical US AM radio station. As pirate radio had been influential to mods, it was felt particularly appropriate to pay tribute to it. As well as the music, the inter-song announcements and jingles were a key component of radio, so it was decided to include a selection of humorous asides on the album. The Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967 came into effect at midnight on 14 August 1967, outlawing all pirate stations (except for Radio Caroline North and South) and strengthening the album&#x27;s effect as a tribute. The aspect separated the Who from their contemporaries in the developing underground rock scene, both musically and stylistically.

== Writing and recording ==
According to music critic Richie Unterberger, &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; featured &quot;jubilant&quot; psychedelic pop music that veers between &quot;melodic mod pop and powerful instrumentation&quot;, while Edna Gundersen from &quot;USA Today&quot; said the album&#x27;s style was power pop. The first song to be written specifically for the concept was &quot;Jaguar&quot;, paying tribute to the car, which was quickly followed by an instrumental the group had recorded for Coca-Cola. &quot;Armenia City in the Sky&quot; was written by a friend of the band, Speedy Keen.

Having finished touring the US, including an appearance at the Monterey International Pop Festival, the group returned to the UK on 16 September 1967 to start recording. They made progress on the album for the next three weeks; the first song to be completed was the single, &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot;, released the following month. By October, the group had also completed &quot;Armenia City in the Sky&quot;, &quot;Early Morning Cold Taxi&quot; and &quot;Girl&#x27;s Eyes&quot;. &quot;Heinz Baked Beans&quot;, &quot;Odorono&quot; and &quot;Top Gear&quot; had been completed mid-month, along with a series of linking adverts and jingles mostly recorded by Entwistle and Moon. &quot;Tattoo&quot;, &quot;Odorono&quot; and &quot;Rael&quot; were completed by 20 October, while most of the remainder of the album was recorded in between live shows at the end of the month. &quot;Sunrise&quot;, a solo Townshend piece, was the last to be recorded on 2 November. The album was mixed by Lambert and Damon Lyon-Shaw intermittently throughout November, coming up with a finished master on the 20th.

==Packaging==
The cover is divided into panels featuring a photograph by David Montgomery of each of the band members, two on the front and two on the back. On the front is Pete Townshend applying Odorono brand deodorant from an oversized stick, and Roger Daltrey sitting in a bathtub full of Heinz Baked Beans (holding an oversized tin can of the same). Daltrey variously claimed that he had either caught pneumonia, the flu, or &quot;the worst cold that [he had] had in [his] lifetime&quot; after sitting for a prolonged period in the bathtub, as the beans had just come out of the fridge, and were &quot;freezing cold&quot;. On the back is Keith Moon applying Medac (an acne ointment) from an oversized tube to an oversized pimple, and John Entwistle in a leopard-skin &quot;Tarzan&quot; suit, squeezing a blonde model in a leopard-skin bikini with one arm and a teddy bear with the other (an ad for the Charles Atlas exercise course mentioned in one of the album&#x27;s fake commercials).

Original vinyl copies of &quot;Sell Out&quot; end with an audio oddity that repeats into a locked groove (In response to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;). The music in the locked groove is a snippet of what was originally intended to be a vocal jingle for the Who&#x27;s UK label Track Records.

When the LP was released on Track Records in the UK in 1967 (Track 612 002 Mono &amp; Track 613 002 Stereo), a psychedelic poster illustrated by Adrian George was included inside the first 1000 copies (500 stereo and 500 mono). They came with a sticker on the front cover stating &#x27;Free Psychedelic Poster Inside&#x27;. Because of their rarity, first pressings with poster and sticker have sold for more than £600 (about $). The poster was reinstated into the vinyl packaging when The Who&#x27;s back catalogue of studio albums was restored to vinyl in 2012.

==Release and reception==
The album was released in the UK on 15 December 1967. It reached number 13 in the charts. The original release date of 17 November had been pushed back due to arguments about the running order. It was released almost concurrently in the US, reaching number 48. The concept of the album hampered its commercial performance despite positive reviews, as its irony sat awkwardly with the serious ambitions of the underground music scene, and it was too specific to the mod scene&#x27;s background for many younger pop fans.

In a contemporary review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Jann Wenner called &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; &quot;fantastic&quot; and praised its &quot;exquisite&quot; sense of humor and the Who&#x27;s &quot;consummate&quot; musicianship, which includes &quot;wholly original&quot; instrumentation and cleverly placed electronic sounds. Robert Christgau, writing in &quot;Esquire&quot;, said the album establishes the band as &quot;the third best not just in Britain but the world&quot;, while citing &quot;Tattoo&quot; as the best song Townshend has &quot;ever written, worth the price of the album&quot;. He later included the album in his &quot;basic record library&quot; of 1960s albums, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981). In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger said that, &quot;on strictly musical merits, it&#x27;s a terrific set of songs that ultimately stands as one of the group&#x27;s greatest achievements.&quot; Sociomusicologist Simon Frith referred to it as a &quot;Pop art pop masterpiece&quot;.

In 1995, &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; was reissued by MCA Records with numerous outtakes and rejected jingles added to the end of the original album. In the liner notes for the reissue, Dave Marsh called it &quot;the greatest rock and roll album of its era&quot; and &quot;the Who&#x27;s consummate masterpiece, the work that holds together most tightly as concept and realization&quot;. Marsh believed the album&#x27;s essence is &quot;most tightly linked to the glorious pop insanity that psychedelia and its aftermath destroyed forever.&quot; Reviewing the reissue in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Christgau called it the Who&#x27;s &quot;only great album&quot;, feeling they had yet to &quot;take their pretensions seriously&quot;, with nothing but good songs throughout, including the faux-ads and bonus tracks. It was also deemed the band&#x27;s best work by Todd Hutlock from &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;, while &quot;Melody Maker&quot; said the record was a masterpiece because of its &quot;glorious celebration of pop as useless commodity and a commercially corrupted art form&quot; without degrading itself. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;the most successful concept album ever&quot; in a 1999 review.

In 2003, &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; was placed at number 113 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, 115 in a 2012 revised list, and 316 on the 2020 list. Mark Kemp, writing in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), called it Townshend&#x27;s first and best concept album and said that he &quot;successfully does what he would overdo&quot; in &quot;Tommy&quot; and &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;: &quot;There&#x27;s no fixed narrative to take away from the music. And the music is sensational&quot;. In 2007, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included it on their list of the 40 essential albums of 1967 and stated, &quot;the Who&#x27;s finest album exemplifies how pop this famously psychedelic year was.&quot; The album was reissued in 2009 as a two-disc deluxe edition, which Danny Kelly of &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine said was the &quot;definitive&quot; release of the Who&#x27;s most &quot;entertaining&quot; and &quot;endearing&quot; album. In his review for eMusic, Lenny Kaye said that &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; is a &quot;classic of prophetic pop art&quot; because of &quot;the concept of branding that has taken the place of record label patronage these days&quot;.

On 23 April 2021, the album was re-released as a new Super Deluxe Edition Set, designed by Richard Evans, featuring 112 tracks on five CDs: &quot;The Original Mono Album&quot;, &quot;The Original Stereo Album&quot;, &quot;Pete Townshend&#x27;s Demos&quot;, &quot;The Who&#x27;s Studio Sessions&quot;, and &quot;The Road to Tommy&quot;, including 48 previously unreleased tracks, two 7&quot; singles, posters, memorabilia, and new liner notes by Townshend.

<doc id="160438" wikidata="Q862685" url="?curid=160438" title="Bill of attainder">
<text>A bill of attainder (also known as an act of attainder, writ of attainder, or bill of pains and penalties) is an act of a legislature declaring a person, or a group of people, guilty of some crime, and providing for a punishment, often without a trial. As with attainder resulting from the normal judicial process, the effect of such a bill is to nullify the targeted person&#x27;s civil rights, most notably the right to own property (and thus pass it on to heirs), the right to a title of nobility, and, in at least the original usage, the right to life itself.

In the history of England, the word &quot;attainder&quot; refers to people who were declared &quot;attainted&quot;, meaning that their civil rights were nullified: they could no longer own property or pass property to their family by will or testament. Attainted people would normally be punished by judicial execution, with the property left behind escheated to the Crown or lord rather than being inherited by family. The first use of a bill of attainder was in 1321 against Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester and his son Hugh Despenser the Younger, Earl of Gloucester, who were both attainted for supporting King Edward II. Bills of attainder passed in Parliament by Henry VIII on 29 January 1542 resulted in the executions of a number of notable historical figures.

The use of these bills by Parliament eventually fell into disfavour due to the potential for abuse and the violation of several legal principles, most importantly the right to due process, the precept that a law should address a particular form of behaviour rather than a specific individual or group, and the separation of powers, since a bill of attainder is necessarily a judicial matter. The last use of attainder was in 1798 against Lord Edward FitzGerald for leading the Irish Rebellion of 1798. The House of Lords later passed the Pains and Penalties Bill 1820, which attempted to attaint Queen Caroline, but it was not considered by the House of Commons. No bills of attainder have been passed since 1820 in the UK. Attainder remained a legal consequence of convictions in courts of law, but this ceased to be a part of punishment in 1870.

American dissatisfaction with British attainder laws resulted in their being prohibited in the United States Constitution in 1789. Bills of attainder are forbidden to both the federal government and the states, reflecting the importance that the Framers attached to this issue. Every state constitution also expressly forbids bills of attainder. The U.S. Supreme Court has invalidated laws under the Attainder Clause on five occasions. Most common-law nations have prohibited bills of attainder, some expressly and some impliedly.

==Jurisdictions==

===Australia===
The Constitution of Australia contains no specific provision permitting the Commonwealth Parliament to pass bills of attainder. The High Court of Australia has ruled that bills of attainder are unconstitutional, because it is a violation of the separation of powers doctrine for any body to wield judicial power other than a Chapter III courtthat is, a body exercising power derived from Chapter III of the Constitution, the chapter providing for judicial power. One of the core aspects of judicial power is the ability to make binding and authoritative decisions on questions of law, that is, issues relating to life, liberty or property. The wielding of judicial power by the legislative or executive branch includes the direct wielding of power and the indirect wielding of judicial power.

The state constitutions in Australia contain few limitations on government power. Bills of attainder are considered permissible because there is no entrenched separation of powers at the state level. However, section 77 of the Constitution of Australia permits state courts to be invested with Commonwealth jurisdiction, and any state law that renders a state court unable to function as a Chapter III court is unconstitutional. The states cannot structure their legal systems to prevent them from being subject to the Australian Constitution.

An important distinction is that laws seeking to direct judicial power (e.g. must make orders) are unconstitutional, but laws that concern mandatory sentencing, rules of evidence, non-punitive imprisonment, or tests, are constitutional.

State parliaments are, however, free to prohibit parole boards from granting parole to specific prisoners. For instance, sections 74AA and 74AB of the Corrections Act 1986 in Victoria significantly restrict the ability of the parole board to grant parole to Julian Knight or Craig Minogue. These have been upheld by the High Court of Australia and are distinguished from bills of attainder since the original sentence (life imprisonment) stands; the only change is the administration of parole.

===Canada===
In two cases of attempts to pass bills (in 1984 for Clifford Olson and in 1995 for Karla Homolka) to inflict a judicial penalty on a specific person, the speakers of the House and Senate, respectively, have ruled that Canadian parliamentary practice does not permit bills of attainder or bills of pains and penalties.

===United Kingdom===

====English law====
The word &quot;attainder&quot; is part of English common law. Under English law, a criminal condemned for a serious crime, whether treason or felony (but not misdemeanour, which referred to less serious crimes), could be declared &quot;attainted&quot;, meaning that his civil rights were nullified: he could no longer own property or pass property to his family by will or testament. His property could consequently revert to the Crown or to the mesne lord. Any peerage titles would also revert to the Crown. The convicted person would normally be punished by judicial executionwhen a person committed a capital crime and was put to death for it, the property left behind escheated to the Crown or lord rather than being inherited by family. Attainder functioned more or less as the revocation of the feudal chain of privilege and all rights and properties thus granted.

Due to mandatory sentencing, the due process of the courts provided limited flexibility to deal with the various circumstances of offenders. The property of criminals caught alive and put to death because of a guilty plea or jury conviction on a not guilty plea could be forfeited, as could the property of those who escaped justice and were outlawed; but the property of offenders who died before trial, except those killed during the commission of crimes (who fell foul of the law relating to &quot;felo de se&quot;), could not be forfeited, nor could the property of offenders who refused to plead and who were tortured to death through &quot;peine forte et dure&quot;.

On the other hand, when a legal conviction did take place, confiscation and &quot;corruption of blood&quot; sometimes appeared unduly harsh for the surviving family. In some cases (at least regarding the peerage) the Crown would eventually re-grant the convicted peer&#x27;s lands and titles to his heir. It was also possible, as political fortunes turned, for a bill of attainder to be reversed. This sometimes occurred long after the convicted person was executed.

Unlike the mandatory sentences of the courts, acts of Parliament provided considerable latitude in suiting the punishment to the particular conditions of the offender&#x27;s family. Parliament could also impose non-capital punishments without involving courts; such bills are called bills of pains and penalties.

Bills of attainder were sometimes criticised as a convenient way for the king to convict subjects of crimes and confiscate their property without the bother of a trial – and without the need for a conviction or indeed any evidence at all. It was however relevant to the custom of the Middle Ages, where all lands and titles were granted by a king in his role as the &quot;fount of honour&quot;. Anything granted by the king&#x27;s wish could be taken away by him. This weakened over time as personal rights became legally established.

The first use of a bill of attainder was in 1321 against Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester and his son Hugh Despenser the Younger, Earl of Gloucester. They were both attainted for supporting King Edward II during his struggle with the queen and barons.

In England, those executed subject to attainders include George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence (1478); Thomas Cromwell (1540); Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury (1540); Catherine Howard (1542); Thomas, Lord Seymour (1549); Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford (1641); Archbishop William Laud of Canterbury (1645); and James Scott, Duke of Monmouth. In the 1541 case of Catherine Howard, King Henry VIII was the first monarch to delegate royal assent, to avoid having to assent personally to the execution of his wife.

After defeating Richard III and replacing him on the throne of England following the Battle of Bosworth Field, Henry VII had Parliament pass a bill of attainder against his predecessor. It is noteworthy that this bill made no mention of the Princes in the Tower, although it does declare him guilty of &quot;shedding of Infants blood&quot;.

Although deceased by the time of the Restoration, the regicides John Bradshaw, Oliver Cromwell, Henry Ireton, and Thomas Pride were served with a bill of attainder on 15 May 1660 backdated to 1 January 1649 (NS). After the committee stages, the bill passed both the Houses of Lords and Commons and was engrossed on 4 December 1660. This was followed with a resolution that passed both Houses on the same day:

In 1685, when the Duke of Monmouth landed in West England and started a rebellion in an effort to overthrow his uncle, the recently enthroned James II, Parliament passed a bill of attainder against him. After the Battle of Sedgemoor, this made it possible for King James to have the captured Monmouth put summarily to death. Though legal, this was regarded by many as an arbitrary and ruthless act.

In 1753, the Jacobite leader Archibald Cameron of Lochiel was summarily put to death on the basis of a seven-year-old bill of attainder, rather than being put on trial for his recent subversive activities in Scotland. This aroused some protests in British public opinion at the time, including from people with no Jacobite sympathies.

The last use of attainder was in 1798 against Lord Edward FitzGerald for leading the Irish Rebellion of 1798.

====The Great Act of Attainder====
In 1688, King James II of England (VII of Scotland), driven off by the ascent of William III and Mary II in the Glorious Revolution, came to Ireland with the sole purpose of reclaiming his throne. After his arrival, the Parliament of Ireland assembled a list of names in 1689 of those reported to have been disloyal to him, eventually tallying between two and three thousand, in a bill of attainder. Those on the list were to report to Dublin for sentencing. One man, Lord Mountjoy, was in the Bastille at the time and was told by the Irish Parliament that he must break out of his cell and make it back to Ireland for his punishment, or face the grisly process of being drawn and quartered. The parliament became known in the 1800s as the &quot;Patriot Parliament&quot;.

Later defenders of the Patriot Parliament pointed out that the ensuing &quot;Williamite Settlement forfeitures&quot; of the 1690s named an even larger number of Jacobite suspects, most of whom had been attainted by 1699.

====Private bills====

In the Westminster system (and especially in the United Kingdom), a similar concept is covered by the term &quot;private bill&quot; (a bill which upon passage becomes a private Act). Note however that &quot;private bill&quot; is a general term referring to a proposal for legislation applying to a specific person; it is only a bill of attainder if it punishes them; private bills have been used in some Commonwealth countries to effect divorce. Other traditional uses of private bills include chartering corporations, changing the charters of existing corporations, granting monopolies, approving of public infrastructure and seizure of property for those, as well as enclosure of commons and similar redistributions of property. Those types of private bills operate to take away private property and rights from certain individuals, but are usually not called &quot;bill of pains and penalties&quot;. Unlike the latter, Acts appropriating property with compensation are constitutionally uncontroversial as a form of compulsory purchase.

The last United Kingdom bill called a &quot;Pains and Penalties Bill&quot; was the Pains and Penalties Bill 1820 and was passed by the House of Lords in 1820, but not considered by the House of Commons; it sought to divorce Queen Caroline from King George IV and adjust her titles and property accordingly, on grounds of her alleged adultery, as did many private bills dealing with divorces of private persons.

No bills of attainder have been passed since 1820 in the UK. Attainder as such remained a legal consequence of convictions in courts of law, but this ceased to be a part of punishment in 1870.

====World War II====
Previously secret British War Cabinet papers released on 1 January 2006 have shown that, as early as December 1942, the War Cabinet had discussed their policy for the punishment of the leading Axis officials if captured. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had then advocated a policy of summary execution with the use of an act of attainder to circumvent legal obstacles. He was dissuaded by Richard Law, a junior minister at the Foreign Office, who pointed out that the United States and the Soviet Union still favoured trials.

===United States===
==== Colonial era ====
Bills of attainder were used throughout the 18th century in England, and were applied to British colonies as well. However, at least one American state, New York, used a 1779 bill of attainder to confiscate the property of British loyalists (called Tories) as both a penalty for their political sympathies and means of funding the rebellion. American dissatisfaction with British attainder laws resulted in their being prohibited in the U.S. Constitution ratified in 1787.

==== Constitutional bans ====
The United States Constitution forbids legislative bills of attainder: in federal law under Article I, Section 9, Clause 3 (&quot;No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed&quot;), and in state law under Article I, Section 10. The fact that they were banned even under state law reflects the importance that the Framers attached to this issue.

Within the U.S. Constitution, the clauses forbidding attainder laws serve two purposes. First, they reinforce the separation of powers by forbidding the legislature to perform judicial or executive functions, as a bill of attainder necessarily does. Second, they embody the concept of due process, which is reinforced by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.

Every state constitution also expressly forbids bills of attainder. For example, Wisconsin&#x27;s constitution Article I, Section 12 reads:

In contrast, the Texas Constitution omits the clause that applies to heirs. It is unclear whether a law that called for heirs to be deprived of their estate would be constitutional in Texas.

==== Supreme Court cases ====
The U.S. Supreme Court has invalidated laws under the Attainder Clause on five occasions.

Two of the Supreme Court&#x27;s first decisions on the meaning of the bill of attainder clause came after the American Civil War. In &quot;Ex parte Garland&quot;, 71 U.S. 333 (1866), the court struck down a federal law requiring attorneys practising in federal court to swear that they had not supported the rebellion. In &quot;Cummings v. Missouri&quot;, 71 U.S. 277 (1867), the Missouri Constitution required anyone seeking a professional&#x27;s license from the state to swear they had not supported the rebellion. The Supreme Court overturned the law and the constitutional provision, arguing that the people already admitted to practice were subject to penalty without judicial trial. The lack of judicial trial was the critical affront to the Constitution, the Court said.

Two decades later, however, the Court upheld similar laws. In &quot;Hawker v. New York&quot;, 170 U.S. 189 (1898), a state law barred convicted felons from practising medicine. In &quot;Dent v. West Virginia&quot;, 129 U.S. 114 (1889), a West Virginia state law imposed a new requirement that practising physicians had to have graduated from a licensed medical school or they would be forced to surrender their license. The Court upheld both laws because, it said, the laws were narrowly tailored to focus on an individual&#x27;s qualifications to practice medicine. That was not true in &quot;Garland&quot; or &quot;Cummings&quot;.

The Court changed its &quot;bill of attainder test&quot; in 1946. In &quot;United States v. Lovett&quot;, 328 U.S. 303 (1946), the Court confronted a federal law that named three people as subversive and excluded them from federal employment. Previously, the Court had held that lack of judicial trial and the narrow way in which the law rationally achieved its goals were the only tests of a bill of attainder. But the &quot;Lovett&quot; Court said that a bill of attainder 1) specifically identified the people to be punished; 2) imposed punishment; and 3) did so without benefit of judicial trial. As all three prongs of the bill of attainder test were met in &quot;Lovett&quot;, the court held that a Congressional statute that bars particular individuals from government employment qualifies as punishment prohibited by the bill of attainder clause.

The Taft–Hartley Act (enacted in 1947) sought to ban political strikes by Communist-dominated labour unions by requiring all elected labour leaders to take an oath that they were not and had never been members of the Communist Party USA, and that they did not advocate violent overthrow of the U.S. government. It also made it a crime for members of the Communist Party to serve on executive boards of labour unions. In &quot;American Communications Association v. Douds&quot;, 339 U.S. 382 (1950), the Supreme Court had said that the requirement for the oath was not a bill of attainder because: 1) anyone could avoid punishment by disavowing the Communist Party, and 2) it focused on a future act (overthrow of the government) and not a past one. Reflecting current fears, the Court commented in &quot;Douds&quot; on approving the specific focus on Communists by noting what a threat communism was. The Court had added an &quot;escape clause&quot; test to determining whether a law was a bill of attainder.

In &quot;United States v. Brown&quot;, 381 U.S. 437 (1965), the Court invalidated the section of the statute that criminalized a former communist serving on a union&#x27;s executive board. Clearly, the Act had focused on past behaviour and had specified a specific class of people to be punished. Many legal scholars assumed that the &quot;Brown&quot; case effectively, if not explicitly, overruled &quot;Douds&quot;. The Court did not apply the punishment prong of the &quot;Douds&quot; test, leaving legal scholars confused as to whether the Court still intended it to apply.

The Supreme Court emphasized the narrowness and rationality of bills of attainder in &quot;Nixon v. Administrator of General Services&quot;, 433 U.S. 425 (1977). During the Watergate scandal, in 1974 Congress passed the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act, which required the General Services Administration to confiscate former President Richard Nixon&#x27;s presidential papers to prevent their destruction, screen out those which contained national security and other issues which might prevent their publication, and release the remainder of the papers to the public as fast as possible. The Supreme Court upheld the law in &quot;Nixon&quot;, arguing that specificity alone did not invalidate the act because the President constituted a &quot;class of one&quot;. Thus, specificity was constitutional if it was rationally related to the class identified. The Court modified its punishment test, concluding that only those laws which historically offended the bill of attainder clause were invalid. The Court also found it significant that Nixon was compensated for the loss of his papers, which alleviated the punishment. The Court modified the punishment prong by holding that punishment could survive scrutiny if it was rationally related to other, nonpunitive goals. Finally, the Court concluded that the legislation must not be intended to punish; legislation enacted for otherwise legitimate purposes could be saved so long as punishment was a side-effect rather than the main purpose of the law.

==== Lower court cases ====
A number of cases which raised the bill of attainder issue did not reach or have not reached the Supreme Court, but were considered by lower courts.

In 1990, in the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, Congress enacted the Oil Pollution Act to consolidate various oil spill and oil pollution statutes into a single unified law, and to provide for a statutory regime for handling oil spill cleanup. This law was challenged as a bill of attainder by the shipping division of ExxonMobil.

In 2003, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down the Elizabeth Morgan Act as a bill of attainder.

After the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution in late 2009 barring the community organising group Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) from receiving federal funding, the group sued the U.S. government. Another, broader bill, the Defund ACORN Act, was enacted by Congress later that year. In March 2010, a federal district court declared the funding ban an unconstitutional bill of attainder. On 13 August 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed and remanded on the grounds that only 10 percent of ACORN&#x27;s funding was federal and that did not constitute &quot;punishment&quot;.

==== Possible cases ====
There is argument over whether the Palm Sunday Compromise in the Terri Schiavo case was a bill of attainder.

Some analysts considered a proposed Congressional bill to confiscate 90 percent of the bonus money paid to executives at federally rescued investment bank American International Group a bill of attainder, although disagreement exists on the issue. The bill was not passed by Congress.

In 2009, the city of Portland, Oregon&#x27;s attempt to prosecute more severely those on a &quot;secret list&quot; of 350 individuals deemed by police to have committed &quot;liveability crimes&quot; in certain neighbourhoods was challenged as an unconstitutional bill of attainder.

In 2011, the House voted to defund Planned Parenthood. Democratic Representative Jerry Nadler called that vote a bill of attainder, saying it was unconstitutional as such because the legislation was targeting a specific group.

In January 2017, the House reinstated the Holman Rule, a procedural rule that enables lawmakers to reduce the pay of an individual federal worker down to $1. It was once again removed at the beginning of the 116th United States Congress in January 2019, after Democrats had taken control of the chamber.

On November 5, 2019, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in &quot;Allen v. Cooper&quot;. On March 23, 2020, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of North Carolina and struck down the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act, which Congress passed in 1989 to attempt to curb such infringements of copyright by states, in &quot;Allen v. Cooper&quot;.

After the ruling Nautilus Productions, the plaintiff in &quot;Allen v. Cooper&quot;, filed a motion for reconsideration in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. On August 18, 2021, Judge Terrence Boyle granted the motion for reconsideration which North Carolina promptly appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The 4th Circuit denied the state&#x27;s motion on October 14, 2022. Nautilus then filed their second amended complaint on February 8, 2023, alleging 5th and 14th Amendment violations of Nautilus&#x27; constitutional rights, additional copyright violations, and claiming that North Carolina&#x27;s &quot;Blackbeard&#x27;s Law&quot;, N.C. Gen Stat §121-25(b), represents a Bill of Attainder. Eight years after the passage of &quot;Blackbeard&#x27;s Law&quot;, on June 30, 2023, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper signed a bill repealing the law.

<text>Richard Corben (November 1, 1940December 2, 2020) was an American illustrator and comic book artist best known for his comics featured in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; magazine, especially the &quot;Den&quot; series which was featured in the magazine&#x27;s first film adaptation in 1981. He was the winner of the 2009 Spectrum Grand Master Award and the 2018 Grand Prix at Angoulême. In 2012 he was elected to the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame.

==Biography==
Richard Corben was born on a farm in Anderson, Missouri, and went on to get a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the Kansas City Art Institute, in 1965. At the same time, he trained in bodybuilding, but eventually retired from the art with few accomplishments due to a lack of time to dedicate himself to it.

After working as a professional animator at Kansas City&#x27;s Calvin Productions, Corben started writing and illustrating for the underground comics, including &quot;Grim Wit&quot;, &quot;Slow Death&quot;, &quot;Skull&quot;, &quot;Rowlf&quot;, &quot;Fever Dreams&quot; and his own anthology &quot;Fantagor&quot;. In 1970 he began illustrating horror and science-fiction stories for Warren Publishing. His stories appeared in &quot;Creepy&quot;, &quot;Eerie&quot;, &quot;Vampirella&quot;, &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;Comix International&quot;. He also colored several episodes of Will Eisner&#x27;s &quot;Spirit&quot;. All the stories and covers he did for &quot;Creepy&quot; and &quot;Eerie&quot; have been reprinted by Dark Horse Books in a single volume: &quot;Creepy Presents Richard Corben&quot;. The three stories he drew for &quot;Vampirella&quot; have been reprinted by Dynamite Entertainment in &quot;Vampirella Archives Vol. 5&quot;.

In 1975, when Moebius, Druillet, and Jean-Pierre Dionnet started publishing the magazine &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; in France, Corben submitted some of his stories to them. He continued his work for the franchise in America, where the magazine was called &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;. Also in 1975, a selection of his black-and-white underground comix stories was collected in hardcover as &quot;The Richard Corben Funnybook&quot; from Kansas City&#x27;s Nickelodeon Press. In 1976 he adapted a short Robert E. Howard story in an early graphic novel, &quot;Bloodstar&quot;.

Among the stories drawn for &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; he continued the saga of his most famous creation, &quot;Den&quot;, which had begun in the short film &quot;Neverwhere&quot; and a short story in the underground publication &quot;Grim Wit&quot; No. 2. The saga of Den is a fantasy series about the adventures of a young underweight nerd who travels to Neverwhere, a universe taking inspirational nods from Robert E. Howard&#x27;s Hyborian Age, Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27;s Barsoom and H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s horror dimensions. This story was adapted in a highly abridged form, in the animated film &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, where Den was voiced by John Candy in a humorous interpretation of the character that Corben found excellent.

Corben&#x27;s collaborations are varied, ranging from &quot;Rip in Time&quot; with Bruce Jones, to Harlan Ellison for &quot;Vic and Blood&quot;, to the &quot;Mutant World&quot; titles, &quot;Jeremy Brood&quot;, and &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot; with Jan Strnad.

From 1986 to 1994 Corben operated his own publishing imprint, Fantagor Press. Among the titles Fantagor published were &quot;Den&quot;, &quot;Den Saga&quot;, &quot;Horror in the Dark&quot;, &quot;Rip in Time&quot;, and &quot;Son of Mutant World&quot;. Fantagor went out of business after the 1994 contraction of the comics industry.

Due to the sexual nature of Corben&#x27;s art, it has been accused of being pornographic, a description he disagreed with, preferring to call his work &quot;sensual&quot; instead. One notorious example was the interview he gave &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; editor Brad Balfour in 1981. Corben was very dissatisfied with the interview. He felt it portrayed him as a &quot;petty, childish, borderline psychotic oaf&quot;. He wrote a letter in retort, which was published in the September 1981 issue.

Corben did the cover of Meat Loaf&#x27;s &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;, Jim Steinman&#x27;s &quot;Bad for Good&quot; and a movie poster (based on a layout compositional sketch by Neal Adams) for the Brian De Palma film &quot;Phantom of the Paradise&quot;. In addition, he provided cover art for the VHS release of the low-budget horror film &quot;Spookies&quot;.

In 2000, Corben collaborated with Brian Azzarello on five issues of Azzarello&#x27;s run on &quot;Hellblazer&quot; (146–150) which was collected in a trade called &quot;Hellblazer: Hard Time&quot;. He also adapted the classic horror story &quot;The House on the Borderland&quot; by William Hope Hodgson for DC&#x27;s Vertigo imprint. In 2001, Azzarello and Corben teamed up to create Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Startling Stories: Banner&quot; (a four issue mini-series exploring Doc Samson&#x27;s relationship with Bruce Banner) and Marvel MAX&#x27;s &quot;Cage&quot; (a five issue mini-series starring Luke Cage). In June 2004, Corben joined with Garth Ennis to produce &quot;The Punisher: The End&quot;, a one-shot title for Marvel published under the MAX imprint as part of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;The End&quot; series. The story tells of The Punisher&#x27;s final days on an earth ravaged by nuclear holocaust. Ever the independent, Corben would work with rocker Rob Zombie and Steve Niles in 2005 on a project for IDW Publishing called &quot;Bigfoot&quot;. In 2007, Corben did a two issue run on Marvel Comics&#x27; surreal demon biker, &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;. At Marvel&#x27;s MAX imprint he has produced &quot;Haunt of Horror&quot;, a mini-series adapting classic works of horror to comics. The first mini-series, published in 2006, was based on the stories of Edgar Allan Poe followed by a second series in 2008 adapting works by H. P. Lovecraft. Between 2008 and 2009 he illustrated the flashback sequences in &quot;Conan of Cimmeria&quot; #1–7, collected as &quot;Conan Volume 7: Cimmeria&quot;. In 2009 he illustrated &quot;Starr the Slayer&quot; for Marvel&#x27;s MAX comics imprint. Since then Corben has done more work for Marvel, DC, IDW, and most notably Dark Horse, drawing the Eisner Award-winning &quot;Hellboy&quot;.

In May 2020, Parallax Studio announced preproduction on the live-action animated film &quot;MEAD&quot; (originally titled &quot;To Meet the Faces You Meet&quot;) based on the comic book &quot;Fever Dreams&quot; illustrated by Corben and written by Jan Strnad. The film stars Robert Picardo and Samuel Hunt and features the voices of Patton Oswalt and Patrick Warburton. &quot;MEAD&quot; was premiered at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival on May 22, 2022, and was released for streaming in North America on August 9, 2022.

== Personal life ==
Corben&#x27;s wife is named Madonna &quot;Dona&quot; (née Marchant). Corben was the special-effects/animation technician for her prize-winning film entry &quot;Siegfried Saves Metropolis&quot; in a contest sponsored by &quot;Famous Monsters of Filmland&quot; magazine in 1964 (see issues #34 and 35). They married soon afterward in 1965. They had a daughter, Beth, who is a watercolor painter and often colored her father&#x27;s comics. 

Corben died on December 2, 2020, following heart surgery. He was 80 years old.

== Awards ==
Corben&#x27;s work in comics and animation has won him recognition, including the Shazam Award for Outstanding New Talent in 1971, and a Shazam Award for Superior Achievement by an Individual in 1973. Corben won a 1973 Goethe Award for &quot;Favorite Fan Artist&quot;. He also received a CINE Golden Eagle and President of Japan Cultural Society trophy in 1968 for his short film &quot;Neverwhere&quot;.

While working for the Warren anthologies, he received numerous Warren Awards: 1973 Best Artist/Writer and Special Award for &quot;Excellence&quot;, 1976 Best Art for &quot;Within You, Without You&quot; (&quot;Eerie&quot; #77) and Best Cover (also for &quot;Eerie&quot; #77), and 1978 Best Cover Artist.

In 2009 Corben won the &quot;Best Finite Series/Limited Series&quot; Eisner Award for &quot;Hellboy: The Crooked Man&quot; and in 2011 he won the &quot;Best Single Issue (or One-Shot)&quot; Eisner Award, for Hellboy: Double Feature of Evil. Finally, in 2012 he was elected to the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame.

In 2015, Corben was inducted into the Ghastly Awards Hall of Fame. His previous Ghastly Awards include Best Artist in 2013 and Best One-shot Comics for his Dark Horse Poe adaptations... Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s The Conqueror Worm in 2012, Edgar Allan Poe: The Raven &amp; The Red Death (2013) and Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s Morella and the Murders in the Rue Morgue in 2014.

In January 2018 he won the prestigious Grand Prix at Angoulême and presidency of the 2019 festival. Beginning concurrently with the 2019 festival in January, a 250-piece collection of his original artworks was put on display at the Musée d&#x27;Angoulême, the exhibit ending March 10, 2019.

<text>In the politics of the European Union, an Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) is the formal procedure for negotiating amendments to the EU&#x27;s founding treaties. Under the treaties, an IGC is called into being by the European Council, and is composed of representatives of the member states, with the Commission, and to a lesser degree the Parliament also participating.

An IGC will conclude with a meeting of the European Council, at which any political issues requiring resolution at the level of Heads of State or Government will be resolved, and final political agreement will be reached. A final treaty text in each of the community languages will then be prepared by the legal and linguistic experts of the member states, before being presented to the member states for signature and ratification.

<doc id="160458" wikidata="Q21319" url="?curid=160458" title="Parramatta">
<text>Parramatta (; ) is a suburb and major commercial centre in Greater Western Sydney. Parramatta is located approximately west of the Sydney CBD, on the banks of the Parramatta River. It is commonly regarded as the secondary central business district of metropolitan Sydney.

Parramatta is the municipal seat of the local government area of the City of Parramatta and is often regarded as one of the primary centres of the Greater Sydney metropolitan region, along with the Sydney CBD, Penrith, Campbelltown, and Liverpool. Parramatta also has a long history as a second administrative centre in the Sydney metropolitan region, playing host to a number of government departments, as well as state and federal courts. It is often colloquially referred to as &quot;Parra&quot;.

Parramatta, which was founded as a British settlement in 1788, the same year as Sydney, is the oldest inland European settlement in Australia and serves as the economic centre of Greater Western Sydney. Since 2000, state government agencies such as the New South Wales Police Force and Sydney Water have relocated to Parramatta from Central Sydney. The 151st meridian east runs directly through the suburb.

==History==
===Aboriginal===
Radiocarbon dating suggests human activity occurred in Parramatta from around 30,000 years ago. The Darug people who lived in the area before European settlement regarded the area as rich in food from the river and forests. They named the area Baramada or Burramatta (&#x27;Parramatta&#x27;) which means Eel (&quot;Burra&quot;) Place (&quot;matta&quot;), with the resident Indigenous people being called the Burramattagal. Similar Darug words include Cabramatta (Grub place) and Wianamatta (Mother place). Other references are derived from the words of Captain Watkin Tench, a white British man with a poor understanding of the Darug language, and are incorrect. To this day many eels and other sea creatures are attracted to nutrients that are concentrated where the saltwater of Port Jackson meets the freshwater of the Parramatta River. The Parramatta Eels rugby league club chose their symbol as a result of this phenomenon.

=== British colonisation ===
Parramatta was colonised by the British in 1788, the same year as Sydney. As such, Parramatta is the second oldest city in Australia, being only 10 months younger than Sydney. The British colonists, who had arrived in January 1788 on the First Fleet at Sydney Cove, had only enough food to support themselves for a short time and the soil around Sydney Cove proved too poor to grow the amount of food that 1,000 convicts, soldiers and administrators needed to survive. During 1788, Governor Arthur Phillip had reconnoitred several places before choosing Parramatta as the most likely place for a successful large farm. Parramatta was the furthest navigable point inland on the Parramatta River (i.e. furthest from the thin, sandy coastal soil) and also the point at which the river became freshwater and therefore useful for farming.

On Sunday 2 November 1788, Governor Phillip took a detachment of marines along with a surveyor and, in boats, made his way upriver to a location that he called The Crescent, a defensible hill curved round a river bend, now in Parramatta Park. The Burramattagal were rapidly displaced with notable residents Maugoran, Boorong and Baludarri being forced from their lands. 

As a settlement developed, Governor Phillip gave it the name &quot;Rose Hill&quot; after British politician George Rose. On 4 June 1791 Phillip changed the name of the township to Parramatta, approximating the term used by the local Aboriginal people. A neighbouring suburb acquired the name &quot;Rose Hill&quot;, which today is spelt &quot;Rosehill&quot;.

In an attempt to deal with the food crisis, Phillip in 1789 granted a convict named James Ruse the land of Experiment Farm at Parramatta on the condition that he develop a viable agriculture. There, Ruse became the first European to successfully grow grain in Australia. The Parramatta area was also the site of the pioneering of the Australian wool industry by John Macarthur&#x27;s Elizabeth Farm in the 1790s. Philip Gidley King&#x27;s account of his visit to Parramatta on 9 April 1790 is one of the earliest descriptions of the area. Walking four miles with Governor Phillip to Prospect, he saw undulating grassland interspersed with magnificent trees and a great number of kangaroos and emus.

The Battle of Parramatta, a major battle of the Australian frontier wars, occurred in March 1797 where Eora leader Pemulwuy led a group of Bidjigal warriors, estimated to be at least 100, in an attack on the town of Parramatta. The local garrison withdrew to their barracks and Pemulwuy held the town until he was eventually shot and wounded. A year later, a government farm at Toongabbie was attacked by Pemulwuy, who challenged the New South Wales Corps to a fight.

Governor Arthur Phillip built a small house for himself on the hill of The Crescent. In 1799 this was replaced by a larger residence which, substantially improved by Governor Lachlan Macquarie from 1815 to 1818, has survived to the present day, making it the oldest surviving Government House anywhere in Australia. It was used as a retreat by Governors until the 1850s, with one Governor (Governor Brisbane) making it his principal home for a short period in the 1820s.

In 1803, another famous incident occurred in Parramatta, involving a convicted criminal named Joseph Samuel, originally from England. Samuel was convicted of murder and sentenced to death by hanging, but the rope broke. In the second attempt, the noose slipped off his neck. In the third attempt, the new rope broke. Governor King was summoned and pardoned Samuel, as the incident appeared to him to be divine intervention.

In 1814, Macquarie opened a school for Aboriginal children at Parramatta as part of a policy of improving relations between Aboriginal and European communities. This school was later relocated to &quot;Black Town&quot;.

Parramatta was gazetted as a city on 19 November 1976, and later, a suburb on 10 June 1994.

The first significant skyscrapers began to emerge in Parramatta in the late 1990s and the suburb transformed into a major business and residential hub in the early 2000s. Since then, the suburb&#x27;s growth has accelerated in the past decade.

On 20 December 2024, the first stage of the Parramatta Light Rail was completed.

== Climate ==

Parramatta has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfa&quot;) with mild to cool, somewhat short winters and warm to usually hot summers, alongside moderate rainfall spread throughout the year.

Summer maximum temperatures are quite variable, often reaching above , on average 13.1 days in the summer season, and sometimes remaining in the low 20s, especially after a cold front or a sea breeze, such as the southerly buster. Northwesterlies can occasionally bring hot winds from the desert that can raise temperatures higher than mostly from November to February, and sometimes above in January severe heatwaves. The record highest temperature (since 1967) was on 4 January 2020. Parramatta is warmer than Sydney CBD in the summer due to the urban heat island effect and its inland location. In extreme cases though, it can be warmer than Sydney, especially when sea breezes do not penetrate inland on hot summer and spring days. For example, on 28 November 2009, the city reached , while Parramatta reached , almost higher. In the summer, Parramatta, among other places in western Sydney, can often be the hottest place in the world because of the Blue Mountains trapping hot air in the region, in addition to the UHI effect.

Rainfall is slightly higher during the first three months of the year because the anticlockwise-rotating subtropical high is to the south of the country, thereby allowing moist easterlies from the Tasman Sea to penetrate the city. The second half of the year tends to be drier (late winter/spring) since the subtropical high is to the north of the city, thus permitting dry westerlies from the interior to dominate. Drier winters are also owed to its position on the leeward side of the Great Dividing Range, which block westerly cold fronts (that are more common in late winter) and thus would become foehn winds, whereby allowing decent amount of sunny days and relatively low precipitation in that period. Thunderstorms are common in the months from early spring to early autumn, occasionally quite severe thunderstorms can occur. Snow is virtually unknown, having been recorded only in 1836 and 1896 Parrammatta gets 106.6 days of clear skies annually.

Depending on the wind direction, summer weather may be humid or dry, though the humidity is mostly in the comfortable range, with the late summer/autumn period having a higher average humidity than late winter/early spring.

==Commercial area==

Church Street is home to many shops and restaurants. The northern end of Church Street, close to Lennox Bridge, features &quot;al fresco&quot; dining with a diverse range of cuisines. Immediately south of the CBD Church Street is known across Sydney as &#x27;Auto Alley&#x27; for the many car dealerships lining both sides of the street as far as the M4 Motorway.

Since 2000, Parramatta has seen the consolidation of its role as a government centre, with the relocation of agencies such as the New South Wales Police Force Headquarters and the Sydney Water Corporation from Sydney CBD. At the same time, major construction work occurred around the railway station with the expansion of Westfield Shoppingtown and the creation of a new transport interchange. The western part of the Parramatta CBD is known as the Parramatta Justice Precinct and houses the corporate headquarters of the Department of Communities and Justice. Other legal offices include the Children&#x27;s Court of New South Wales and the Sydney West Trial Courts, Legal Aid Commission of NSW, Office of Trustee and Guardian (formerly the Office of the Protective Commissioner), NSW Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Nearby on Marsden Street is the Parramatta Courthouse and the Drug Court of New South Wales. The Garfield Barwick Commonwealth Law Courts Building (named in honour of Sir Garfield Barwick), houses courts of the Federal Magistrates Court and the Family Court of Australia. The NSW Government has also announced plans to secure up to 45,000 m2 of new A-grade leased office space in Parramatta to relocate a further 4,000 workers from the Sydney CBD.

Parramatta Square (previously known as Civic Place) is a civic precinct located in the heart of the city, adjacent to Parramatta Town Hall. The Parramatta Square construction works included a redevelopment of the Parramatta Civic Centre, construction of a new culture and arts centre, and the construction of a new plaza. The designs of the first two projects, a 65-storey residential skyscraper and an office building were announced on 20 July 2012. Concerns from CASA about infringements into controlled airspace from the height of the residential tower resulted in 8 Parramatta Square being turned into a 55-story commercial building, rather than the originally proposed 65-storey residential tower. Parramatta Square became home to 3,000 National Australia Bank employees, relocated from the Sydney CBD. Other notable commercial tenants who have established a presence at Parramatta Square include Westpac, Endeavour Energy, KPMG and Deloitte.

Centenary Square, formerly known as Centenary Plaza, was created in 1975 when the then Parramatta City Council closed a section of the main street to traffic to create a pedestrian plaza. It features an 1888 Centennial Memorial Fountain and adjoins the 1883 Parramatta Town Hall and St John&#x27;s Cathedral.

A hospital known as The Colonial Hospital was established in Parramatta in 1818. This then became Parramatta District Hospital. Jeffery House was built in the 1940s. With the construction of the nearby Westmead Hospital complex public hospital services in Parramatta were reduced but after refurbishment Jeffery House again provides clinical health services. Nearby, Brislington House has had a long history with health services. It is the oldest colonial building in Parramatta, dating to 1821. It became a doctors residence before being incorporated into the Parramatta Hospital in 1949.

Parramatta is a major business and commercial centre, and home to Westfield Parramatta, the tenth largest shopping centre in Australia. Parramatta is also the major transport hub for Western Sydney, servicing trains and buses, as well as having a ferry wharf and future light rail and metro services. Major upgrades have occurred around Parramatta railway station with the creation of a new transport interchange, and the ongoing development of the Parramatta Square local government precinct.

==Places of worship==

Church Street takes its name from St John&#x27;s Cathedral (Anglican), which was built in 1802 and is the oldest church in Parramatta. While the present building is not the first on the site, the towers were built during the time of Governor Macquarie, and were based on those of the church at Reculver, England, at the suggestion of his wife, Elizabeth. The historic St John&#x27;s Cemetery is located nearby on O&#x27;Connell Street.
St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral (Roman Catholic) is one of the oldest Catholic churches in Australia. Construction commenced in 1836, but it wasn&#x27;t officially complete until 1837. In 1854 a new church was commissioned, although the tower was not completed until 1880, with the spire following in 1883. It was built on the site to meet the needs of a growing congregation. It was destroyed by fire in 1996, with only the stone walls remaining.

On 29 November 2003, the new St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral was dedicated. The historic St Patrick&#x27;s Cemetery is located in North Parramatta. The Uniting Church is represented by Leigh Memorial Church. Parramatta Salvation Army is one of the oldest active Salvation Army Corps in Australia. Parramatta is also home to the Parramatta and Districts Synagogue, which services the Jewish community of western Sydney.

The Greek Orthodox Parish and Community of St Ioannis (St John The Frontrunner) Greek Orthodox Church was established in Parramatta in May 1960 under the ecumenical jurisdiction of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia to serve the predominantly emigrating Greek population of Greater Western Sydney. Originally, the liturgies were held in the hall of St John&#x27;s Ambulance Brigade in Harris Park until the completion of the church in December 1966 located in Hassall Street Parramatta. The parish sold this property in 2014 and is now located at the corner of George and Purchase Streets. The Parish Community of St Ioannis continues to serve over 5,000 Greek parishioners.

A Buddhist temple is located in Cowper Street, Parramatta. Parramatta&#x27;s Mosque is in an apartment building on Marsden Street, Parramatta. The district is served by BAPS Swaminarayan Hindu temple located on Eleanor St, Rosehill, and a Murugan Hindu temple in Mays Hill, off Great Western Highway.

==Parks==
Parramatta Park is a large park adjacent to Western Sydney Stadium that is a popular venue for walking, jogging and bike riding. It was formerly the Governor&#x27;s Domain, being land set aside for the Governor to supply his farming needs, until it was gazetted as a public park in 1858. As the Governor&#x27;s Domain, the grounds were considerably larger than the current 85 hectare Parramatta Park, extending from Parramatta Road in the south as evident by a small gatehouse adjacent to Parramatta High School. For a time Parramatta Park housed a zoo until 1951 when the animals were transferred to Taronga Zoo.

Parramatta is known as the &#x27;River City&#x27; as the Parramatta River flows through the Parramatta CBD. Its foreshore features a playground, seating, picnic tables and pathways that are increasingly popular with residents, visitors and CBD workers.

Prince Alfred Square is a Victorian era park located within the CBD on the northern side of the Parramatta River. It is one of the oldest public parks in New South Wales with trees dating from . Prior to being a public park, it was the site of Parramatta&#x27;s second gaol from 1804 until 1841 and the first female factory in Australia between 1804 and 1821.

==Transport==
In contrast to the high level of car dependency throughout Sydney, a greater proportion of Parramatta&#x27;s workers travelled to work on public transport (45.2%) than by car (36.2%) in 2016.
===Rail===

==== Heavy rail ====
Parramatta railway station is served by Sydney Trains&#x27; Cumberland Line, Leppington &amp; Inner West Line and North Shore &amp; Western Line services. NSW TrainLink operates intercity services on the Blue Mountains Line as well as services to rural New South Wales. The station was originally opened in 1855, located in what is now Granville, and known as Parramatta Junction. The station was moved to its current location and opened on 4 July 1860, five years after the first railway line in Sydney was opened, running from Sydney to Parramatta Junction. It was upgraded in the 2000s, with work beginning in late 2003 and the new interchange opening on 19 February 2006.

==== Light rail ====
The light rail Westmead &amp; Carlingford Line runs from Westmead to Carlingford via the Parramatta city centre. A future branch will run to Sydney Olympic Park.

==== Metro ====
The under construction Sydney Metro West will be a metro line run between the Sydney central business district and Westmead. Announced in 2016, the line is set to open in 2032 with a station in Parramatta.

===Bus===
Parramatta is also serviced by a major bus interchange located on the south eastern side of the railway station. The interchange is served by buses utilising the North-West T-way to Rouse Hill and the Liverpool-Parramatta T-way to Liverpool. Parramatta is also serviced by one high frequency Metrobus service:
* M91 – Parramatta to Hurstville via Granville, Bankstown and Peakhurst

A free bus Route 900 is operated by Transit Systems in conjunction with the state government. Route 900 circles Parramatta CBD. A free bus also links Western Sydney Stadium to Parramatta railway station during major sporting events.
===Ferry===
The Parramatta ferry wharf is at the Charles Street Weir, which divides the tidal saltwater from the freshwater of the upper river, on the eastern boundary of the Central Business District. The wharf is the westernmost destination of Sydney Ferries&#x27; Parramatta River ferry services.

===Road===
Parramatta Road has always been an important thoroughfare for Sydney from its earliest days. From Parramatta the major western road for the state is the Great Western Highway. The M4 Western Motorway, running parallel to the Great Western Highway has taken much of the traffic away from these roads, with entrance and exit ramps close to Parramatta.

James Ruse Drive serves as a partial ring-road circling around the eastern part of Parramatta to join with the Cumberland Highway to the north west of the city.

The main north-south route through Parramatta is Church Street. To the north it becomes Windsor Road, and to the south it becomes Woodville Road.

Astronomers who worked at the observatory, discovering thousands of new stars and deep sky objects, include James Dunlop and Carl Rümker. In 1822, the architect S. L. Harris designed the Bath House for Governor Brisbane and built it in 1823. Water was pumped to the building through lead pipes from the river. In 1886, it was converted into a pavilion.

Both teams formerly played matches at Parramatta Stadium that has since been demolished, and replaced with the 30,000-seat Western Sydney Stadium. Parramatta Stadium was also home to the now dissolved Sydney Wave of the former Australian Baseball League and Parramatta Power of the former National Soccer League. The newly built Bankwest Stadium opened its gates for the community on 14 April 2019 with free entry for all fans. Located on O’Connell Street, the stadium is in proximity of the Parramatta CBD. The opening sporting event was the 2019 Round 6 NRL clash between Western Sydney rivals the Parramatta Eels and Wests Tigers on Easter Monday 22 April. The Eels won the match by a score of 51–6. It is being predicted that the new stadium will boost Western Sydney economy by contributing millions of dollars to it.

<text>A central business district (CBD) is the commercial and business center of a city. It contains commercial space and offices, and in larger cities will often be described as a financial district. Geographically, it often coincides with the &quot;city centre&quot; or &quot;downtown&quot;. However, these concepts are not necessarily synonymous: many cities have a central &quot;business&quot; district located away from its traditional city center, and there may be multiple CBDs within a single urban area. The CBD will often be highly accessible and have a large variety and concentration of specialised goods and services compared to other parts of the city. Midtown Manhattan is the world&#x27;s largest central business district.

In Chicago, the Chicago Loop is the second-largest central business district in the United States. It is also referred to as the core of the city&#x27;s downtown.
Mexico City also has its own historic city center, the colonial era &quot;Centro Histórico&quot;, along with two CBDs: the mid-late 20th century Paseo de la Reforma in Polanco, and the new Santa Fe, respectively. Russia&#x27;s largest central business district is the Moscow International Business Center in Moscow.

The shape and type of a central business district almost always closely reflect the city&#x27;s history. Cities with strong preservation laws and maximum building height restrictions to retain the character of the historic and cultural core may have a CBD quite a distance from the city centre (and in some cases, outside the city limits itself). This distinction is quite common in European cities such as Paris, Moscow, Vienna, Prague and Budapest. The New World grew quickly after the emergence of modern transport, therefore a single centre often included many of the region&#x27;s tallest buildings and served as both a commercial and cultural city centre.

In the 21st century, increasing urbanisation has led to the development of megacities that often have multiple CBDs scattered across the urban area. Downtown sections of cities, especially in North America, often are distinct from CBDs and city centres. No two CBDs have the same spatial shape, but there are certain common geometric patterns, which are largely a result of centralised commercial and industrial activities.

== Australia ==
In Australia, the term CBD is widely used officially and colloquially, in the sense of city centre. The three biggest cities, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane have large CBDs. Sydney features growing micro central business districts, which serve as the hub for their respective areas outside the CBD. An example is Parramatta (which is considered the financial hub of Western Sydney), Chatswood and North Sydney. Also on the outskirts of Brisbane, within &quot;Brisbane-Gold Coast urban area&quot; with a population of 3 million, a new micro central business district being created in Southport.
== Brazil ==
São Paulo is a multipolar city, with several business districts. Avenida Faria Lima and the neighboring districts, Itaim Bibi and Vila Olímpia, now concentrate a large part of the financial activities in São Paulo and Brazil. Avenida Paulista and nearby streets is a well-established financial center that has several banking offices and corporate headquarters, as well as hospitals. Its Historic Center was the city&#x27;s first business center; There, the São Paulo Stock Exchange is located. The region comprising Avenidas Berrini, Doutor Chucri Zaidan, and Nações Unidas, the city&#x27;s newest commercial district, has offices of multinational companies and also commercial services.

In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil&#x27;s second-largest city, the main business district still is in downtown, where Petrobrás and Vale headquarters are located, but there is a concentration of business in Botafogo harbor and in Barra da Tijuca, a newer Rio de Janeiro suburb located in city&#x27;s west region.

== China ==


== Colombia ==
The largest CBD in Colombia is Bogotá&#x27;s &quot;Centro Internacional&quot;, where some of the tallest buildings in South America have been repurposed as national headquarters for Scotiabank Colpatria, Davivienda, and Bancolombia, among others.

Over the years, Bogotá has developed minor business districts, which include &quot;Avenida Chile&quot;, &quot;Ciudad Salitre&quot;, with companies like Avianca, Rappi, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Terpel, Hilton, Hyatt, Marriott, Sheraton, Ramada, City Express, Aloft and Novotel; or &quot;Complejo Santa Bárbara&quot;, the last of which features the only W Hotel in the city.

Colombia&#x27;s other notable CBDs include &quot;Parque Berrío&quot; in Medellín, &quot;Bocagrande&quot; in Cartagena (the largest touristic CBD in the country), and &quot;Paseo de Bolívar&quot; in Barranquilla.
== France ==
La Défense, west of Paris, is France&#x27;s largest central business district. La Défense was in 2017 ranked as the leading CBD in continental Europe, and the fourth in the world.

La Défense hosts 19 of the world&#x27;s biggest 500 companies, whilst the Paris region as a whole hosts 29 of the world&#x27;s 500 largest companies, establishing itself as the first city in Europe (and the third worldwide) for the number of companies classified in &quot;Fortune&quot; Fortune Global 500.

== Germany ==

In Germany, the terms &quot;Innenstadt&quot; and &quot;Stadtzentrum&quot; may be used to describe the central business district. These terms can be literally translated as &quot;inner city&quot; and &quot;city center&quot;. Some of the larger cities have more than one central business district. For example, Berlin alone has three.

Due to Berlin&#x27;s history of division during the Cold War, the city contains central business districts both in West (Kurfürstendamm) and in East Berlin (Alexanderplatz), as well as a newly built business district near the Potsdamer Platz. The city&#x27;s historic center (home to the Reichstag building, as well as the Brandenburg Gate and most federal ministries) was largely abandoned when the Berlin Wall cut through the area. Only after the reunification with the redevelopment of Potsdamer Platz, and the construction of numerous shopping centers, government ministries, embassies, office buildings and entertainment venues, was the area revived.

In Frankfurt am Main&#x27;s city center, there is a business district called the &quot;Bankenviertel&quot;.

In Düsseldorf, there is a business district which is located around the famous high street Königsallee with banks, shops and offices.

== Hong Kong ==

Consulates general and consulates of many countries are also located in this area, as is Government Hill, the site of the old government headquarters. As the Hong Kong SAR Government Headquarters moved to Tamar, Admiralty, the nearby area is also considered part of the CBD. 

In Quarry Bay, Taikoo Place and areas nearby, including Admiralty, Wan Chai and Causeway Bay, and Tsim Sha Tsui, Kwun Tong, and Kowloon Bay are regarded as major business districts of Hong Kong.

Bangalore has five notable business districts: UB City, Brigade Gateway, Koramangala, Indiranagar, and Electronic City. Lucknow has three business districts, including Hazratganj Market, Gomti Nagar Extension at the extended area of Gomti Nagar, and Aminabad in old Lucknow. Kolkata also has central business districts, including B.B.D. Bagh, Park Circus, Esplanade, Salt Lake Sector V, and New Town.

== Indonesia ==
The largest CBD in Indonesia is the Golden Triangle (&quot;Segitiga Emas&quot; in Indonesian) in Jakarta. Sudirman Central Business District, a super block that is located within the Golden Triangle, is the first of its kind in Indonesia, and one of the largest commercial center developments in the city. Jakarta started developing its business district in the early 1960s before hosting the Asian Games in 1962.

Surabaya in East Java built its first central business district in the Darmo region. The construction was expected to be completed by 2018 with 150 SOHO units and 500 residences.

==Italy==
In Italy, business districts do not coincide with the geographical centers of the city because the city center is the historical center of the city, and usually not very suitable to function as a modern business district.

A precursor to modern business districts is EUR in Rome, which is now home to several national and international companies and public bodies.

The EUR, the Napoli business district, the Milan business district, and City Life, are among the most important commercial areas in Italy. Other important business and financial centers are present in Genoa and Brescia.

It is also the most popular area for tourists and the city&#x27;s main commercial district. While the district has a high density of high rise buildings, the tallest building, the SK Building, only reaches a height of 160m due to historic preservation regulations.

<doc id="160466" wikidata="Q343100" url="?curid=160466" title="Acts of Union 1800">
<text>The Acts of Union 1800 were parallel acts of the Parliament of Great Britain and the Parliament of Ireland which united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland (previously in personal union) to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The acts came into force between 31 December 1800 and 1 January 1801, and the merged Parliament of the United Kingdom had its first meeting on 22 January 1801.

Provisions of the acts remain in force, with amendments and some Articles repealed, in the United Kingdom, but they have been repealed in their entirety in the Republic of Ireland.

==Name==
Two acts were passed in 1800 with the same long title: &quot;An Act for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;. The short title of the act of the British Parliament is Union with Ireland Act 1800 (39 &amp; 40 Geo. 3. c. 67), assigned by the Short Titles Act 1896. The short title of the act of the Irish Parliament is Act of Union (Ireland) 1800 (40 Geo. 3. c. 38 (I)), assigned by a 1951 act of the Parliament of Northern Ireland, and hence not effective in the Republic of Ireland, where it was referred to by its long title when repealed in 1962.

==Background==
Before these acts, Ireland had been in personal union with England since 1542, when the Irish Parliament had passed the Crown of Ireland Act 1542, proclaiming King Henry VIII of England to be King of Ireland. Since the 12th century, the King of England had been technical overlord of the Lordship of Ireland, a papal possession. Both the Kingdoms of Ireland and England later came into personal union with that of Scotland upon the Union of the Crowns in 1603.

In 1707, the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland were united into a single kingdom: the Kingdom of Great Britain. Upon that union, each House of the Parliament of Ireland passed a congratulatory address to Queen Anne, praying her: &quot;May God put it in your royal heart to add greater strength and lustre to your crown, by a still more comprehensive Union&quot;. The Irish Parliament was both before then subject to certain restrictions that made it subordinate to the Parliament of England and after then, to the Parliament of Great Britain; however, Ireland gained effective legislative independence from Great Britain through the Constitution of 1782.

By this time access to institutional power in Ireland was restricted to a small minority: the Anglo-Irish of the Protestant Ascendancy. Frustration at the lack of reform among the Catholic majority eventually led, along with other reasons, to a rebellion in 1798, involving a French invasion of Ireland and the seeking of complete independence from Great Britain. This rebellion was crushed with much bloodshed, and the motion for union was motivated at least in part by the belief that the union would alleviate the political rancour that led to the rebellion. The rebellion was felt to have been exacerbated as much by brutally reactionary loyalists as by United Irishmen (anti-unionists).

Furthermore, Catholic emancipation was being discussed in Great Britain, and fears that a newly enfranchised Catholic majority would drastically change the character of the Irish government and parliament also contributed to a desire from London to merge the Parliaments.

According to historian James Stafford, an Enlightenment critique of Empire in Ireland laid the intellectual foundations for the Acts of Union. He writes that Enlightenment thinkers connected &quot;the exclusion of the Irish Kingdom from free participation in imperial and European trade with the exclusion of its Catholic subjects, under the terms of the &#x27;Penal Laws&#x27;, from the benefits of property and political representation.&quot; These critiques were used to justify a parliamentary union between Britain and Ireland.

== Passage ==
Complementary acts were enacted by the Parliament of Great Britain and the Parliament of Ireland.

The Parliament of Ireland had recently gained a large measure of legislative independence under the Constitution of 1782. Many members of the Irish Parliament jealously guarded that autonomy (notably Henry Grattan), and a motion for union was legally rejected in 1799. Only Anglicans were permitted to become members of the Parliament of Ireland though the great majority of the Irish population were Roman Catholic, with many Presbyterians in Ulster. Under the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1793, Roman Catholics regained the right to vote if they owned or rented property worth £2 annually. Wealthy Catholics were strongly in favour of union in the hope for rapid religious emancipation and the right to sit as MPs, which would only come to pass under the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829.

From the perspective of Great Britain&#x27;s elites, the union was desirable because of the uncertainty that followed the French Revolution of 1789 and the Irish Rebellion of 1798. If Ireland adopted Catholic emancipation willingly or not, a Roman Catholic Parliament could break away from Britain and ally with the French, but the same measure within the United Kingdom would exclude that possibility. Also, in creating a regency during King George III&#x27;s &quot;madness&quot;, the Irish and British Parliaments gave the Prince Regent different powers. These considerations led Great Britain to decide to attempt the merger of both kingdoms and Parliaments.

The final passage of the Act in the Irish House of Commons turned on an about 16% relative majority, garnering 58% of the votes, and similar in the Irish House of Lords, in part per contemporary accounts through bribery with the awarding of peerages and honours to critics to get votes. The first attempt had been defeated in the Irish House of Commons by 109 votes to 104, but the second vote in 1800 passed by 158 to 115.

==Provisions==

The Acts of Union were two complementary Acts, namely:

* The Union with Ireland Act 1800 (39 &amp; 40 Geo. 3 c. 67), an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain, and
* The Act of Union (Ireland) 1800 (40 Geo. 3 c. 38), an Act of the Parliament of Ireland.

They were passed on 2 July 1800 and 1 August 1800 respectively, and came into force on 1 January 1801. They ratified eight articles which had been previously agreed by the British and Irish parliaments:
* Articles I–IV dealt with the political aspects of the Union. It created a united parliament.
** In the House of Lords, the existing members of the Parliament of Great Britain were joined by, as Lords Spiritual, four bishops of the Church of Ireland, rotating among the dioceses in each session and as Lords Temporal 28 Irish representative peer elected for life by the Peerage of Ireland.
** The House of Commons was to include the pre-union representation from Great Britain and 100 members from Ireland.
* Article V united the established Church of England and Church of Ireland into &quot;one Protestant Episcopal Church, to be called, The United Church of England and Ireland&quot;; but also confirmed the independence of the Church of Scotland.
* Article VI created a customs union, with the exception that customs duties on certain British and Irish goods passing between the two countries would remain for 10 years (a consequence of having trade depressed by the ongoing war with revolutionary France). The High Court of Northern Ireland ruled that parts of this Article as it applied to the UK were &quot;impliedly repealed&quot; by the passage of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2020. This decision was upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.
* Article VII stated that Ireland would have to contribute two-seventeenths towards the expenditure of the United Kingdom. The figure was a ratio of Irish to British foreign trade.
* Article VIII formalised the legal and judicial aspects of the Union.

Part of the appeal of the Union for many Irish Catholics was the promise of Catholic emancipation, allowing Roman Catholic MPs, who had not been permitted to sit in the Irish Parliament, to sit in the United Kingdom Parliament. This was however blocked by King George III who argued that emancipating Roman Catholics would breach his Coronation Oath, and was not realised until the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829.

The traditionally separate Irish Army, which had been funded by the Irish Parliament, was merged into the larger British Army.

===The first parliament===

In the first Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the members of the House of Commons were not elected afresh. By royal proclamation authorised by the Act, all the members of the last House of Commons from Great Britain took seats in the new House, and from Ireland 100 members were chosen from the last Irish House of Commons: two members from each of the 32 counties and the two largest boroughs, and one from each of the next 31 largest boroughs and from Dublin University, chosen by lot. The other 84 Irish parliamentary boroughs were disfranchised; all were pocket boroughs, whose patrons received £15,000 compensation for the loss of what was considered their property.

== Flags and styles==

The Union Flag, created as a consequence of the union of the Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1800, still remains the flag of the United Kingdom. Called the Union Jack, it combined the flags of St George&#x27;s Cross (which was deemed to include Wales) and the St Andrew&#x27;s Saltire of Scotland with the St Patrick&#x27;s Saltire to represent Ireland.

At the same time, a new Royal Title was adopted (&#x27;GEORGE the THIRD by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland King, Defender of the Faith&#x27;), and a new shield of arms. In adopting these, the moribund English claims to the French throne were not continued: the title &#x27;King of France&#x27; was abandoned and the fleur-de-lis were removed from the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom for the first time since the Middle Ages.

<text>2.13.61, Inc. is a publisher and record company founded by American musician Henry Rollins and named after his date of birth (February 13, 1961). The company has released albums by the Rollins Band, all of Rollins&#x27; spoken word work, and numerous books. It is based in Los Angeles, California.

In his mass-market anthology &quot;The Portable Henry Rollins&quot;, Rollins stated that he had given 2.13.61 its name because someone had told him that his first self-released book, &quot;20&quot; (1984), had to have a company name on it, and since he felt at the time that he would only ever get to release one book, he simply used his birthdate.

2.13.61 branched out into releasing records not long after Rollins started a solo career following the breakup of Black Flag, initially just releasing Rollins&#x27; spoken-word albums. The first two 2.13.61 releases, &quot;Big Ugly Mouth&quot; and &quot;Sweatbox&quot;, were first co-released with the label Rollins was signed with at the time as a musician, Texas Hotel Records. Since then, the label has branched out into various rock and jazz releases and even spawned two specialist reissue sublabels, Infinite Zero Archive (a joint venture with Rick Rubin&#x27;s American Recordings), and District Line, which specializes in reissuing the music of Rollins&#x27; hometown of Washington, D.C. It is also used as the name of Rollins&#x27; Blazin&#x27; (finishing move) in the video game &quot;Def Jam: Fight for NY&quot;.

The literary company&#x27;s authors include: Henry Rollins (Publisher, Black Flag), Iggy Pop (The Stooges), Exene Cervenka (X, Auntie Christ, The Knitters), Nick Cave (Birthday Party, Bad Seeds, Grinderman), Michael Gira (Swans), Joe Cole, Tricia Warden, Don Bajema, Bill Shields, Jeffery Lee Pierce (The Gun Club), and Ellyn Maybe.

<doc id="160478" wikidata="Q1758736" url="?curid=160478" title="Loopback">
<text>Loopback (also written loop-back) is the routing of electronic signals or digital data streams back to their source without intentional processing or modification. It is primarily a means of testing the communications infrastructure.

Loopback can take the form of communication channels with only one communication endpoint. Any message transmitted by such a channel is immediately and only received by that same channel. In telecommunications, loopback devices perform transmission tests of access lines from the serving switching center, which usually does not require the assistance of personnel at the served terminal. Loop around is a method of testing between stations that are not necessarily adjacent, wherein two lines are used, with the test being done at one station and the two lines are interconnected at the distant station. A patch cable may also function as loopback, when applied manually or automatically, remotely or locally, facilitating a loop-back test.

Where a system (such as a modem) involves round-trip analog-to-digital processing, a distinction is made between analog loopback, where the analog signal is looped back directly, and digital loopback, where the signal is processed in the digital domain before being re-converted to an analog signal and returned to the source.

==Telecommunications==
In telecommunications, loopback, or a loop, is a hardware or software method which feeds a received signal or data back to the sender. It is used as an aid in debugging physical connection problems. As a test, many data communication devices can be configured to send specific patterns (such as &quot;all ones&quot;) on an interface and can detect the reception of this signal on the same port. This is called a loopback test and can be performed within a modem or transceiver by connecting its output to its own input. A circuit between two points in different locations may be tested by applying a test signal on the circuit in one location, and having the network device at the other location send a signal back through the circuit. If this device receives its own signal back, this proves that the circuit is functioning. 

A hardware loop is a simple device that physically connects the receiver channel to the transmitter channel. In the case of a network termination connector such as X.21, this is typically done by simply connecting the pins together in the connector. Media such as optical fiber or coaxial cable, which have separate transmit and receive connectors, can simply be looped together with a single strand of the appropriate medium. 

A modem can be configured to loop incoming signals from either the remote modem or the local terminal. This is referred to as loopback or software loop. 

==Serial interfaces==
A serial communications transceiver can use loopback for testing its functionality. For example, a device&#x27;s &quot;transmit&quot; pin connected to its &quot;receive&quot; pin will result in the device receiving exactly what it transmits. Moving this looping connection to the remote end of a cable adds the cable to this test. Moving it to the far end of a modem link extends the test further. This is a common troubleshooting technique and is often combined with a specialized test device that sends specific patterns and counts any errors that come back (see &quot;Bit Error Rate Test&quot;). Some devices include built-in loopback capability.

A simple serial interface loopback test, called &quot;paperclip test&quot;, is sometimes used to identify serial ports of a computer and verify operation. It utilizes a terminal emulator application to send characters, with flow control set to off, to the serial port and receive the same back. For this purpose, a paperclip is used to short pin 2 to pin 3 (the receive and transmit pins) on a standard RS-232 interface using D-subminiature DE-9 or DB-25 connectors.

==Virtual loopback interface==
Implementations of the Internet protocol suite include a virtual network interface through which network applications can communicate when executing on the same machine. It is implemented entirely within the operating system&#x27;s networking software and passes no packets to any network interface controller. Any traffic that a computer program sends to a loopback IP address is simply and immediately passed back up the network software stack as if it had been received from another device. Unix-like systems usually name this loopback interface codice_1 or codice_2.

Various Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standards reserve the IPv4 address block , in CIDR notation and the IPv6 address for this purpose. The most common IPv4 address used is . Commonly these loopback addresses are mapped to the hostnames &quot;localhost&quot; or &quot;loopback&quot;.

===MPLS===
An exceptional (non-loopback) use of network addresses is in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) traceroute error detection, in which their property of not being routable provides a convenient means to avoid delivery of faulty packets to end users.

===Martian packets===
Any IP datagram with a source or destination address set to a loopback address must not appear outside of a computing system, or be routed by any routing device. Packets received on an interface with a loopback destination address must be dropped. Such packets are sometimes referred to as Martian packets. As with other bogus packets, they may be malicious and any problems they might cause can be avoided by applying bogon filtering.

===Management interface===
Some computer network equipment use the term &quot;loopback&quot; for a virtual interface used for management purposes. Unlike a proper loopback interface, this type of loopback device is not used to talk with itself.

Such an interface is assigned an address that can be accessed from management equipment over a network but is not assigned to any of the physical interfaces on the device. Such a loopback device is also used for management datagrams, such as alarms, originating from the equipment. The property that makes this virtual interface special is that applications that use it will send or receive traffic using the address assigned to the virtual interface as opposed to the address on the physical interface through which the traffic passes.

Loopback interfaces of this sort are often used in the operation of routing protocols, because they have the useful property that, unlike real physical interfaces, they will not go down when a physical port fails.

==Other applications==
The audio systems Open Sound System (OSS), Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) and PulseAudio have loopback modules for recording the audio output of applications for testing purposes. Unlike physical loopbacks, this does not involve double analog/digital conversion and no disruption is caused by hardware malfunctions.

<text>Lilakoi Moon (born Lisa Michelle Bonet; November 16, 1967), known professionally as Lisa Bonet (), is an American actress. She portrayed Denise Huxtable on the sitcom &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; (1984–1992), for which she earned widespread acclaim and a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 1986; she reprised the role of Denise in the first season of the spinoff series &quot;A Different World&quot;.

She also appeared in the psychological horror film &quot;Angel Heart&quot; (1987), which earned her a nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. Bonet has starred in the action thriller film &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; (1998), the comedy-drama film &quot;High Fidelity&quot; (2000), the action drama film &quot;Biker Boyz&quot; (2003) and the thriller film &quot;Road to Paloma&quot; (2013). She has sporadically worked in TV acting, appearing in roles such as Maya Daniels in &quot;Life on Mars&quot; (2008–2009) and Marisol on &quot;Ray Donovan&quot; (2016).

==Early life==
Lisa Michelle Bonet was born on November 16, 1967, in San Francisco, California, to Arlene Joyce Litman, a white Jewish-American schoolteacher, and Allen Bonet, an opera singer of African-American heritage from Texas. She has five half-sisters, including singer Kadhja Bonet, and two half-brothers by her father&#x27;s marriage to Deborah Church. Bonet&#x27;s parents separated when Bonet was still a baby. Bonet was raised by her single mother in middle-class Reseda and never knew her father. Bonet said she never fit in at Birmingham High School, in Van Nuys, California. &quot;I was stuck in the middle,&quot; she told &quot;The Los Angeles Times.&quot; “The black kids called me an Oreo. The white kids didn’t talk to me.&quot;

She said she did not date in high school because she didn&#x27;t fit in. “My biggest worry in high school was who was going to take me to the prom, since I didn’t have a date,&quot; she told the &quot;Los Angeles Times.&quot; She said the problem disappeared when she landed the Cosby job in New York and wouldn’t attend prom.

Bonet graduated Birmingham High School and later studied acting at the Celluloid Actor&#x27;s Studio in North Hollywood.

==Career==
After being in beauty competitions and appearing in guest spots on television series as a child, Bonet landed the role of Denise Huxtable on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, the second-oldest child of the parents played by Bill Cosby and Phylicia Rashad. Later in the show, she becomes the stepmom to Olivia Kendall played by Raven-Symoné.

The same year, Bonet, then 19, played 17-year-old Epiphany Proudfoot in the movie &quot;Angel Heart&quot; opposite Mickey Rourke. In the film, several seconds of an explicit scene she shared with Rourke (filmed when she was 18) were edited to avoid an X rating. For &quot;Angel Heart&quot;, Bonet earned a nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. She was featured topless in &quot;Interview&quot; magazine.

Bonet didn&#x27;t appreciate the way the press covered her or the controversy at the time. “I think the whole scandal is ridiculous,” she said. “They (the news media) are trying to steam it up.” She said that the brief glimpse of one of her bare breasts is &quot;nothing that hasn&#x27;t been done before or that hasn&#x27;t been seen before,&quot; including in films like &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, which was rated R even though it contained frontal nudity.

In 1986, Bonet earned a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. After announcing her pregnancy during the run of &quot;A Different World&quot;, Bonet left the series. She returned to &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; the following year, but was fired in April 1991 because of &quot;creative differences&quot;.

In September 1992, Bonet hosted &quot;Why Bother Voting?&quot;, an election special focusing on young voters&#x27; concerns and apathy. She had supporting roles in the 1998 film &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; and the 2000 film &quot;High Fidelity&quot;. In 2003 she played Queenie in &quot;Biker Boyz&quot;, which reunited her with her &quot;A Different World&quot; co-star Kadeem Hardison.

Bonet co-starred in the film &quot;Whitepaddy&quot; in 2005. She did not have another film role until 2014&#x27;s &quot;Road to Paloma&quot;, opposite her future husband Jason Momoa. She did, however, appear in a number of television series, including the American adaptation of the British television series &quot;Life on Mars&quot;. She again played a romantic lead opposite Jason Momoa on the Sundance TV series &quot;The Red Road.&quot; “I felt protected and I feel safe when I work with him,&quot; Bonet said of working with Momoa.

Since then, Bonet has made guest appearances on TV shows including &quot;Girls&quot; and &quot;Ray Donovan&quot;.

==Personal life==
On November 16, 1987, her 20th birthday, Bonet eloped with American rock singer Lenny Kravitz in Las Vegas. Bonet recalled of their relationship: Bonet gave birth to their daughter, actress Zoë Isabella Kravitz, on December 1, 1988. She and Kravitz divorced in 1993. That same year, she legally changed her name to Lilakoi Moon, although she still uses the name Lisa Bonet professionally.

Since meeting on the set of &quot;A Different World&quot; in its first season in 1987, Bonet has been close friends with actress Marisa Tomei, who is a godmother to all three of Bonet&#x27;s children.

In 2005, Bonet began a relationship with actor Jason Momoa. They married in October 2017. Bonet and Momoa have two children: a daughter born in July 2007, and a son born in December 2008. In January 2022, Momoa and Bonet announced their separation. On January 8, 2024, Bonet filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. In her divorce filing, Bonet revealed that she and Momoa had actually separated on October 7, 2020. Court documents which were obtained by &quot;People&quot; confirmed that the divorce was granted one day later. A Los Angeles county judge declared them divorced on July 9, 2024. Neither Bonet nor Momoa asked for financial support, and they agreed on how to split their assets. The court granted them joint custody of their children, who, at the time, included: 16-year-old daughter Lola and 15-year-old son Nakoa-Wolf.

<text>A project is a type of assignment, typically involving research or design, that is carefully planned to achieve a specific objective.

An alternative view sees a project managerially as a sequence of events: a &quot;set of interrelated tasks to be executed over a fixed period and within certain cost and other limitations&quot;.

A project may be a temporary (rather than a permanent) social system (work system), possibly staffed by teams (within or across organizations) to accomplish particular tasks under time constraints.

A project may form a part of wider programme management or function as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; system.

Open-source software &quot;projects&quot; or artists&#x27; musical &quot;projects&quot; (for example) may lack defined team-membership, precise planning and/or time-limited durations.

== Overview ==
The word &quot;project&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;projectum&quot; from the Latin verb &quot;proicere&quot;, &quot;before an action&quot;, which in turn comes from &quot;pro-&quot;, which denotes precedence, something that comes before something else in time (paralleling the Greek πρό) and &quot;iacere&quot;, &quot;to do&quot;. The word &quot;project&quot; thus originally meant &quot;before an action&quot;.

When the English language initially adopted the word, it referred to a plan of something, not to the act of actually carrying this plan out. Something performed in accordance with a project became known as an &quot;object&quot;. Every project has certain phases of development.

Based on the Project Management Institute, a project can be defined as a &quot;temporary endeavor&quot; aimed to drive changes in teams, organizations, or societies. The output of a project is normally a unique product, service, or result. Projects can be short-term or long-term. 

===Cancellation===
Project cancellation is the termination of a project prior to its completion and generally includes the cessation of access to funding and other project resources. Project cancellation may result from cost overruns, schedule overruns, changes in budget, change or of the goal of the project, political factors, or any combination of those and other factors. Contracts often stipulate the time and the manner in which a project may be cancelled.

Contracted projects typically have a specified end date, when the contract may or may not be renewed; nonrenewal often has the same effect as cancellation but carries different legal ramifications.

==Formal definition in the project-management realm==

A project consists of a concrete and organized effort motivated by a perceived opportunity when facing a problem, a need, a desire or a source of discomfort (e.g., lack of proper ventilation in a building). It seeks the realization of a unique and innovative deliverable, such as a product, a service, a process, or in some cases, a scientific research. Each project has a beginning and an end, and as such is considered a closed dynamic system. It is developed along the 4 Ps of project management: Plan, Processes, People, and Power (e.g. line of authority). It is bound by the triple constraints that are calendar, costs and norms of quality, each of which can be determined and measured objectively along the project lifecycle. Some projects produce some level of formal documentation, the deliverable(s), and some impacts, which can be positive and/or negative.

== Specific uses ==

=== School and university ===
A project is an individual or collaborative enterprise that is carefully planned and researched about by students. At schools, educational institutes and universities, a project is a research assignment - given to a student - which generally requires a larger amount of effort and more independent work than that involved in a normal essay assignment. It requires students to undertake their fact-finding and analysis, either from library/internet research or from gathering data empirically. The written report that comes from the project is usually in the form of a dissertation, which will contain sections on the project&#x27;s inception, analysis, findings and conclusions.

=== Project management ===
In project management, a project consists of a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result. Another definition is a management environment that is created for the purpose of delivering one or more business products according to a specified business case. Projects can also be seen as temporary organizations.

Project objectives define target status at the end of the project, reaching of which is considered necessary for the achievement of planned benefits. They can be formulated as SMART criteria: Projects are often guided by a steering group.

* Specific
* Measurable (or at least evaluable) achievement
* Achievable (recently Agreed to or Acceptable are used regularly as well)
* Realistic (given the current state of organizational resources)
* Time terminated (bounded)

The evaluation (measurement) occurs at the project closure. However, a continuous guard on the project progress should be kept by monitoring and evaluating.

===Civil and military construction and industry infrastructure===
In civil, military and industry (e.g. oil and gas) infrastructure, capital projects refer to activities to construct and install equipment, facilities and buildings. As these activities are temporary endeavors with clear start and end dates, the term &quot;project&quot; is applied. Because the results of these activities are typically long-standing infrastructure, with a life measured in years or decades, these projects are typically accounted for in financial accounting as capital expenditures, and thus they are termed &quot;capital projects&quot;.

=== Computer software ===
In computer software, a project can consist of programs, configuration definitions and related data. For example, in Microsoft Visual Studio, a &quot;solution&quot; consists of projects and other definitions.

===Corporate finance ===

In corporate finance, &quot;project&quot; is often used to refer new capital investments; 

these will span a spectrum of size and / or purpose (money making or cost saving).
&quot;Projects&quot;, then, 

are usually major strategic decisions (to enter new areas of business or new markets), or acquisitions of other firms, but may include new ventures within existing businesses or markets, or decisions that may change the way existing ventures are run.

=== State project ===
It can be defined as &quot;a set of state policies and/or agencies unified around a particular issue or oppression&quot;. Therefore, these kinds of projects involve constant change and dynamism due to the social constructions that evolve among time. State projects have to adapt to the current moment. They are mostly community services based.

=== Infrastructure code ===
In the context of infrastructure code, a project is a collection of code used to build a discrete component of the system. There is no rule on how much a single project or its component can include.

=== Project services ===
It is the performance of services, including consultation, operation, management, administrative or other services, for the project. For examples: Site One Landscape Supply provides project services for project bids and submittals in the landscaping industry. Jubilee Scholars consulting firm provides multidisciplinary project services. 

=== Service project ===
It is a project that is meant to improve the lives of others, often done without expecting anything in return. It can benefit individuals, a non-profit, or a community A service project can directly address community needs, indirectly address community needs through research, organization, or community action; and provide research and advocacy for change in society, politics, and the environment.

=== Community project ===
A community project is a community-based project. It is a type of service project.

== Types ==
Some analyses of project-oriented activity distinguish - using military-style terminology - between grandiose strategic projects and more trivial or component operational projects: tactical projects.

== Examples ==
* Human Genome Project, which mapped the human genome
* Manhattan Project, which developed the first nuclear weapon
* Polaris missile project: an ICBM control-system
* Apollo program, which landed humans on the Moon
* Soviet atomic bomb project
* Soviet crewed lunar programs
* Project-706
* Great Pyramid of Giza
* SDGs

* Program management
* Project governance
* Software project management
* Project Management Institute (PMI)
* International Project Management Association (IPMA)

<text>The AN/PRC-77 Portable Transceiver, also known as AN/PRC 77 Radio Set, is a man-pack, portable VHF FM combat-net radio transceiver manufactured by Associated Industries and used to provide short-range, two-way radiotelephone voice communication. In the Joint Electronics Type Designation System (JETDS), AN/PRC translates to &quot;Army/Navy, Portable, Radio, Communication.&quot;

== History ==
The AN/PRC-77 entered service in 1968 during the Vietnam War as an upgrade to the earlier AN/PRC-25. It differs from its predecessor mainly in that the PRC-77&#x27;s final power amplifier stage is made with a transistor, eliminating the only vacuum tube in the PRC-25, as well as the DC-DC voltage converter used to create the high plate voltage for the tube from the 15 V battery. In addition, the PRC-25 could not support voice encryption devices, but PRC-77 transmitter audio bandwidth was widened to give it the ability to use the TSEC/KY-38 NESTOR voice encryption system used in Vietnam, and the later KY-57 VINSON family. Problems were encountered in Vietnam with the combination as described in the NESTOR article. The transmitter&#x27;s spurious emissions were cleaned up to create less interference to nearby receivers. The receiver&#x27;s performance was also hardened in the PRC-77 to enable it to better reject interference suffered from nearby transmitters, a common operating set up that reduced the effectiveness of the PRC-25. The receiver audio bandwidth was also increased to operate with the encryption equipment.

There were no changes to the external controls or looks, so the two radios looked and the operating controls were the same. The equipment tag glued to the edge of the front panel was the main (external) way to tell the difference. The original batteries had a 3 V tap (series diode-reduced to 2.4 V) for the PRC-25&#x27;s tube filament. This remained unchanged so the batteries could operate either radio it was placed in, but the PRC-77 did not use the 3 V tap at all. With the more efficient all-transistorized circuitry, and without the DC-DC step-up voltage converter for the tube, the common battery lasted longer in the PRC-77 under the same conditions. &quot;OF THE TWENTY-FIVE (25) ELECTRONIC MODULES ORIGINALLY USED IN BOTH THE TRANSMITTER AND RECEIVER PORTIONS OF THE AN/PRC-25, ONLY EIGHT (8) OF THE MODULES USED IN THE AN/PRC-77 ARE INTERCHANGEABLE WITH THE AN/PRC-25.&#x27;&quot;

Today the AN/PRC-77 has largely been replaced by SINCGARS radios, but it is still capable of inter-operating with most VHF FM radios used by U.S. and allied ground forces. It was commonly nicknamed the &quot;prick-77&quot; by U.S. military forces.

== Technical details ==
The AN/PRC 77 consists of the RT-841 transceiver and minor components. It can provide secure voice (X-mode) transmission with the TSEC/KY-57 VINSON voice encryption device, but is not compatible with the SINCGARS frequency hopping mode. During the Vietnam War, the PRC-77 used the earlier TSEC/KY-38 NESTOR voice encryption system.

== Users ==

*: The Austrian Army still uses the AN/PRC-77, though in a limited capacity such as training cadets in radio communications. For border patrol the Austrian Army now uses a new device called &quot;TFF-41&quot; (Pentacom RT-405), which is capable of frequency-hopping and digital encryption. The Austrian Army also uses the AN/PRC-1177 for example the Austrian AN/PRC-77 have a special switch for a 25 kHz mode, which reduces the bandwidth of the selected channel by 25 kHz and therefore doubles the number of available channels.
*: The Bangladesh Army use the AN/PRC-77 as a section level communication equipment. In Chittagong Hill Tracts area it is still used for operations. Some modified/improvised local antenna concepts often increase the communication range up to 15–20 km. Now being phased out by far superior Q-MAC&#x27;s VHF-90M
*: In Brazil it is used by Brazilian Army It was nicknamed EB-11 RY-20/ERC-110 manufactured by Associated Industries U.S.A and manufactured by AEG Telefunken do Brasil S/A, São Paulo 1970 the radio is used today but is now being replaced but still the PRC-77 remains stored in military units also used for training of technicians in military communications sergeants communications.
*: The Telecomm Regiments in the Chilean Army still using the PRC - 77. (In process of modernization).
*: Salvadoran military and security forces used both American and Israeli-manufactured versions during the civil war.
*: The Finnish army uses this radio as a &quot;battalion radio&quot;, using it as a common training device. The radio is designated LV 217 &#x27;Ventti-seiska&#x27; (&#x27;ventti&#x27; is Finnish slang for &#x27;21&#x27;, from the Finnish variant of blackjack), slowly being phased out of reservist service. FDF also operates PRC-1077 under the designation .
*: The Israel Defense Forces used this radio extensively from the early 1970s to the late 1990s, when it was gradually replaced by modern digital devices. However, it can still be found in some units, mostly in stationary temporary posts.
*: The New Zealand Defence Force used the &#x27;77 set&#x27; as its VHF combat arms communications equipment, both manpack and vehicle-mounted Land Rover &#x27;fitted for radio&#x27; (FFR) variants, from the late 1960s until the 1990s. It came into New Zealand service with a lot of other US equipment during New Zealand&#x27;s contribution to the Vietnam War, replacing the New Zealand-built ZC-1 and British equipment dating back to the Second World War. 
*: The AN/PRC-77 has been replaced as a main source of radio communication for regular forces of the Norwegian Army by indigenously developed radio sets called MRR (Multi Role Radio) and LFR (Lett Flerbruks Radio) (Norwegian for Light Multi Role Radio), and other modern radios. However the Norwegian Army did not throw these radio sets away. Instead many of them were handed over to the Home Guard which still uses it as their backup radio as there is a limited supply of MRR sets for the force totalling 40 000 soldiers.
*: The Pakistani Army has used the set for the past 25+ years. Purchased from different sources including the US, Brazil and Spain, it is scheduled to be replaced in the next 5 years.
*: Used alongside the French TRC 372.
*: The Philippine Army made extensive use of the AN/PRC-77 for several decades until they were phased out of service with the introduction of newer manpack radios such as the Harris Falcon II during the 2000s.
*: The Spanish Army, Spanish Navy (Armada Española), Spanish Marines and Spanish Air Force formerly used the AN/PRC-77. It was replaced by the French PR4G since 2002
*: In the Swedish Army the radio system goes under the name Radio 145 and Radio 146 (Ra145/146), predominately the Homeguard (National Guard) is issued the Ra145/146.
*: The Swiss Army used the radio as SE-227.
*: The Taiwanese army nicknamed the radio as &quot;77&quot;, and had used it for over 40 years when AN/PRC-77, along with AN/VRC-12, were replaced by indigenous radio systems in 2010s.
*: Still found in some units within the Royal Thai Army

<doc id="160501" wikidata="Q628096" url="?curid=160501" title="Ultra high frequency">
<text>Ultra high frequency (UHF) is the ITU designation for radio frequencies in the range between 300 megahertz (MHz) and 3 gigahertz (GHz), also known as the decimetre band as the wavelengths range from one meter to one tenth of a meter (one decimeter). Radio waves with frequencies above the UHF band fall into the super-high frequency (SHF) or microwave frequency range. Lower frequency signals fall into the VHF (very high frequency) or lower bands. UHF radio waves propagate mainly by line of sight; they are blocked by hills and large buildings although the transmission through building walls is strong enough for indoor reception. They are used for television broadcasting, cell phones, satellite communication including GPS, personal radio services including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, walkie-talkies, cordless phones, satellite phones, wireless microphones, in-ear monitors, and numerous other applications.

The IEEE defines the UHF radar band as frequencies between 300 MHz and 1 GHz. Two other IEEE radar bands overlap the ITU UHF band: the L band between 1 and 2 GHz and the S band between 2 and 4 GHz.

== Propagation characteristics ==
Radio waves in the UHF band travel almost entirely by line-of-sight propagation (LOS) and ground reflection; unlike in the HF band there is little to no reflection from the ionosphere (skywave propagation), or ground wave. UHF radio waves are blocked by hills and cannot travel beyond the horizon, but can penetrate foliage and buildings for indoor reception. Since the wavelengths of UHF waves are comparable to the size of buildings, trees, vehicles and other common objects, reflection and diffraction from these objects can cause fading due to multipath propagation, especially in built-up urban areas. Atmospheric moisture reduces, or attenuates, the strength of UHF signals over long distances, and the attenuation increases with frequency. UHF TV signals are generally more degraded by moisture than lower bands, such as VHF TV signals.

As the visual horizon sets the maximum range of UHF transmission to between 30 and 40 miles (48 to 64 km) or less, depending on local terrain, the same frequency channels can be reused by other users in neighboring geographic areas (frequency reuse). Radio repeaters are used to retransmit UHF signals when a distance greater than the line of sight is required.

Occasionally when conditions are right, UHF radio waves can travel long distances by tropospheric ducting as the atmosphere warms and cools throughout the day.

==Antennas==


The length of an antenna is related to the length of the radio waves used. Due to the short wavelengths, UHF antennas are conveniently stubby and short; at UHF frequencies a quarter-wave monopole, the most common omnidirectional antenna is between 2.5 and 25 cm long. UHF wavelengths are short enough that efficient transmitting antennas are small enough to mount on handheld and mobile devices, so these frequencies are used for two-way land mobile radio systems, such as walkie-talkies, two-way radios in vehicles, and for portable wireless devices; cordless phones and cell phones. Omnidirectional UHF antennas used on mobile devices are usually short whips, sleeve dipoles, rubber ducky antennas or the planar inverted F antenna (PIFA) used in cellphones. Higher gain omnidirectional UHF antennas can be made of collinear arrays of dipoles and are used for mobile base stations and cellular base station antennas.

The short wavelengths also allow high gain antennas to be conveniently small. High gain antennas for point-to-point communication links and UHF television reception are usually Yagi, log periodic, corner reflectors, or reflective array antennas. At the top end of the band, slot antennas and parabolic dishes become practical. For satellite communication, helical and turnstile antennas are used since satellites typically employ circular polarization which is not sensitive to the relative orientation of the transmitting and receiving antennas. For television broadcasting specialized vertical radiators that are mostly modifications of the slot antenna or reflective array antenna are used: the slotted cylinder, zig-zag, and panel antennas.

==Applications==

UHF television broadcasting channels are used for digital television, although much of the former bandwidth has been reallocated to land mobile radio system, trunked radio and mobile telephone use. 

Since at UHF frequencies transmitting antennas are small enough to install on portable devices, the UHF spectrum is used worldwide for land mobile radio systems, two-way radios used for voice communication for commercial, industrial, public safety, and military purposes. Examples of personal radio services are GMRS, PMR446, and UHF CB. 

The most rapidly-expanding use of the band is Wi-Fi (wireless LAN) networks in homes, offices, and public places. Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11 low band operates between 2412 and 2484 MHz. A second widespread use is for cellphones, allowing handheld mobile phones be connected to the public switched telephone network and the Internet. Current 3G and 4G cellular networks use UHF, the frequencies varying among different carriers and countries. Satellite phones also use this frequency in the L band and S band.

===United States===
UHF channels are used for digital television broadcasting on both over the air channels and cable television channels. Since 1962, UHF channel tuners (at the time, channels 14 to 83) have been required in television receivers by the All-Channel Receiver Act. However, because of their more limited range, and because few sets could receive them until older sets were replaced, UHF channels were less desirable to broadcasters than VHF channels (and licenses sold for lower prices).

A complete list of US Television Frequency allocations can be found at Pan-American television frequencies.

There is a considerable amount of lawful unlicensed activity (cordless phones, wireless networking) clustered around 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz, regulated under Title 47 CFR Part 15. These ISM bands—frequencies with a higher unlicensed power permitted for use originally by Industrial, Scientific, Medical apparatus—are now some of the most crowded in the spectrum because they are open to everyone. The 2.45 GHz frequency is the standard for use by microwave ovens, adjacent to the frequencies allocated for Bluetooth network devices.

The spectrum from 806 MHz to 890 MHz (UHF channels 70 to 83) was taken away from TV broadcast services in 1983, primarily for analog mobile telephony.

In 2009, as part of the transition from analog to digital over-the-air broadcast of television, the spectrum from 698 MHz to 806 MHz (UHF channels 52 to 69) was removed from TV broadcasting, making it available for other uses. Channel 55, for instance, was sold to Qualcomm for their MediaFLO service, which was later sold to AT&amp;T, and discontinued in 2011. Some US broadcasters had been offered incentives to vacate this channel early, permitting its immediate mobile use. The FCC&#x27;s scheduled auction for this newly available spectrum was completed in March 2008.

<text>Ivan Andreyevich Krylov (; ; 13 February 1769 – 21 November 1844) is Russia&#x27;s best-known fabulist and probably the most epigrammatic of all Russian authors. Formerly a dramatist and journalist, he only discovered his true genre at the age of 40. While many of his earlier fables were loosely based on Aesop&#x27;s and La Fontaine&#x27;s, later fables were original work, often with a satirical bent.

==Life==
Ivan Krylov was born in Moscow, but spent his early years in Orenburg and Tver. His father, a distinguished military officer, resigned in 1775 and died in 1779, leaving the family destitute. A few years later Krylov and his mother moved to St. Petersburg in the hope of securing a government pension. There, Krylov obtained a position in the civil service, but gave it up after his mother&#x27;s death in 1788. His literary career began in 1783, when he sold to a publisher the comedy &quot;The coffee-grounds fortune teller&quot; (&quot;Kofeynitsa&quot;) that he had written at 14, although in the end it was never published or produced. Receiving a sixty ruble fee, he exchanged it for the works of Molière, Racine, and Boileau and it was probably under their influence that he wrote his other plays, of which his &quot;Philomela&quot; (written in 1786) was not published until 1795.

Beginning in 1789, Krylov also made three attempts to start a literary magazine, although none achieved a large circulation or lasted more than a year. Despite this lack of success, their satire and the humour of his comedies helped the author gain recognition in literary circles. For about four years (1797–1801) Krylov lived at the country estate of Prince Sergey Galitzine, and when the prince was appointed military governor of Livonia, he accompanied him as a secretary and tutor to his children, resigning his position in 1803. Little is known of him in the years immediately after, other than the commonly accepted myth that he wandered from town to town playing cards. By 1806 he had arrived in Moscow, where he showed the poet and fabulist Ivan Dmitriev his translation of two of Jean de La Fontaine&#x27;s Fables, &quot;The Oak and the Reed&quot; and &quot;The Choosy Bride&quot;, and was encouraged by him to write more. Soon, however, he moved on to St Petersburg and returned to play writing with more success, particularly with the productions of &quot;The Fashion Shop&quot; (&quot;Modnaya lavka&quot;) and &quot;A Lesson For the Daughters&quot; (&quot;Urok dochkam&quot;). These satirised the nobility&#x27;s attraction to everything French, a fashion he detested all his life.

Krylov&#x27;s first collection of fables, 23 in number, appeared in 1809 and met with such an enthusiastic reception that thereafter he abandoned drama for fable-writing. By the end of his career he had completed some 200, constantly revising them with each new edition. From 1812 to 1841 he was employed by the Imperial Public Library, first as an assistant, and then as head of the Russian Books Department, a not very demanding position that left him plenty of time to write. Honours were now showered on him in recognition of his growing reputation: the Russian Academy of Sciences admitted him as a member in 1811, and bestowed on him its gold medal in 1823; in 1838 a great festival was held in his honour under imperial sanction, and the Emperor Nicholas, with whom he was on friendly terms, granted him a generous pension.

After 1830 he wrote little and led an increasingly sedentary life. A multitude of half-legendary stories were told about his laziness, his gluttony and the squalor in which he lived, as well as his witty repartee.
Towards the end of his life Krylov suffered two cerebral hemorrhages and was taken by the Empress to recover at Pavlovsk Palace. After his death in 1844, he was buried beside his friend and fellow librarian Nikolay Gnedich in the Tikhvin Cemetery.

==Artistic heritage==
Portraits of Krylov began to be painted almost as soon as the fame of his fables spread, beginning in 1812 with Roman M. Volkov&#x27;s somewhat conventional depiction of the poet with one hand leaning on books and the other grasping a quill as he stares into space, seeking inspiration. Roughly the same formula was followed in the 1824 painting of him by (1794 —1868) and that of 1834 by . An 1832 study by Grigory Chernetsov groups his corpulent figure with fellow writers Alexander Pushkin, Vasily Zhukovsky and Nikolay Gnedich. This was set in the Summer Garden, but the group, along with many others, was ultimately destined to appear in the right foreground of Chernetsov&#x27;s immense &quot;Parade at Tsaritsyn Meadow&quot;, completed in 1837.

In 1830 the sculptor Samuil Galberg carved a portrait bust of Krylov. It may have been this or another that was presented by the Emperor to his son Alexander as a new year&#x27;s gift in 1831. A bust is also recorded as being placed on the table before Krylov&#x27;s seat at the anniversary banquet held in his honour in 1838. The most notable statue of him was placed in the Summer Garden (1854–55) ten years after his death. Regarded as a sign of the progress of Romanticism in Russian official culture, it was the first monument to a poet erected in Eastern Europe. The sculptor Peter Clodt seats his massive figure on a tall pedestal surrounded on all sides by tumultuous reliefs designed by Alexander Agin that represent scenes from the fables. Shortly afterwards, he was included among other literary figures on the Millennium of Russia monument in Veliky Novgorod in 1862.

Later monuments chose to represent individual fables separately from the main statue of the poet. This was so in the square named after him in Tver, where much of his childhood was spent. It was erected on the centenary of Krylov&#x27;s death in 1944 and represents the poet standing and looking down an alley lined with metal reliefs of the fables mounted on plinths. A later monument was installed in the Patriarch&#x27;s Ponds district of Moscow in 1976. This was the work of Andrei Drevin, Daniel Mitlyansky, and the architect A. Chaltykyan. The seated statue of the fabulist is surrounded by twelve stylised reliefs of the fables in adjoining avenues.

Krylov shares yet another monument with the poet Alexander Pushkin in the city of Pushkino&#x27;s Soviet Square. The two were friends and Pushkin modified Krylov&#x27;s description of &#x27;an ass of most honest principles&#x27; (&quot;The Ass and the Peasant&quot;) to provide the opening of his romantic novel in verse, &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;. So well known were Krylov&#x27;s fables that readers were immediately alerted by its first line, &#x27;My uncle, of most honest principles&#x27;.

Some portraits of Krylov were later used as a basis for the design of commemorative stamps. The two issued in 1944 on the centenary of his death draw on Eggink&#x27;s, while the 4 kopek stamp issued in 1969 on the bicentenary of his birth is indebted to Briullov&#x27;s late portrait. The same portrait is accompanied by an illustration of his fable &quot;The wolf in the kennel&quot; on the 40 kopek value in the Famous Writers series of 1959. The 150th anniversary of Krylov&#x27;s death was marked by the striking of a two ruble silver coin in 1994. He is also commemorated in the numerous streets named after him in Russia as well as in formerly Soviet territories.

==The Fables==

===As literature===
By the time of Krylov&#x27;s death, 77,000 copies of his fables had been sold in Russia, and his unique brand of wisdom and humor has remained popular ever since. His fables were often rooted in historic events and are easily recognizable by their style of language and engaging story. Though he began as a translator and imitator of existing fables, Krylov soon showed himself an imaginative, prolific writer, who found abundant original material in his native land and in the burning issues of the day. Occasionally this was to lead into trouble with the Government censors, who blocked publication of some of his work. In the case of &quot;The Grandee&quot; (1835), it was only allowed to be published after it became known that Krylov had amused the Emperor by reading it to him, while others did not see the light until long after his death, such as &quot;The Speckled Sheep&quot;, published in 1867, and &quot;The Feast&quot; in 1869.

Beside the fables of La Fontaine, and one or two others, the germ of some of Krylov&#x27;s other fables can be found in Aesop, but always with his own witty touch and reinterpretation. In Russia his language is considered of high quality: his words and phrases are direct, simple and idiomatic, with color and cadence varying with the theme, many of them becoming actual idioms. His animal fables blend naturalistic characterization of the animal with an allegorical portrayal of basic human types; they span individual foibles as well as difficult interpersonal relations.

Many of Krylov&#x27;s fables, especially those that satirize contemporary political situations, take their start from a well-known fable but then diverge. Krylov&#x27;s &quot;The Peasant and the Snake&quot; makes La Fontaine&#x27;s The Countryman and the Snake (VI.13) the reference point as it relates how the reptile seeks a place in the peasant&#x27;s family, presenting itself as completely different in behaviour from the normal run of snakes. To Krylov&#x27;s approbation, with the ending of La Fontaine&#x27;s fable in mind, the peasant kills it as untrustworthy. The Council of the Mice uses another fable of La Fontaine (II.2) only for scene-setting. Its real target is cronyism and Krylov dispenses with the deliberations of the mice altogether. The connection between Krylov&#x27;s &quot;The Two Boys&quot; and La Fontaine&#x27;s The Monkey and the Cat is even thinner. Though both fables concern being made the dupe of another, Krylov tells of how one boy, rather than picking chestnuts from the fire, supports another on his shoulders as he picks the nuts and receives only the rinds in return.

Fables of older date are equally laid under contribution by Krylov. The Hawk and the Nightingale is transposed into a satire on censorship in &quot;The Cat and the Nightingale&quot; The nightingale is captured by a cat so that it can hear its famous song, but the bird is too terrified to sing. In one of the mediaeval versions of the original story, the bird sings to save its nestlings but is too anxious to perform well. Again, in his &quot;The Hops and the Oak&quot;, Krylov merely embroiders on one of the variants of The Elm and the Vine in which an offer of support by the tree is initially turned down. In the Russian story, a hop vine praises its stake and disparages the oak until the stake is destroyed, whereupon it winds itself about the oak and flatters it.

Establishing the original model of some fables is problematical, however, and there is disagreement over the source for Krylov&#x27;s &quot;The swine under the oak&quot;. There, a pig eating acorns under an oak also grubs down to the roots, not realising or caring that this will destroy the source of its food. A final verse likens the action to those who fail to honour learning although benefitting from it. In his &quot;Bibliographical and Historical Notes to the fables of Krilof&quot; (1868), the Russian commentator V.F.Kenevich sees the fable as referring to Aesop&#x27;s &quot;The Travellers and the Plane Tree&quot;. Although that has no animal protagonists, the theme of overlooking the tree&#x27;s usefulness is the same. On the other hand, the French critic Jean Fleury points out that Gotthold Ephraim Lessing’s fable of &quot;The Oak Tree and the Swine&quot;, a satirical reworking of Aesop&#x27;s &quot;The Walnut Tree&quot;, is the more likely inspiration, coalescing as it does an uncaring pig and the theme of a useful tree that is maltreated.

===In the arts===
In that some of the fables were applied as commentaries on actual historical situations, it is not surprising to find them reused in their turn in political caricatures. It is generally acknowledged that &quot;The wolf in the kennel&quot; is aimed at the French invasion of Russia in 1812, since the Emperor Napoleon is practically quoted in a speech made by the wolf. This was shortly followed up by the broadsheet caricature of Ivan Terebenev (1780–1815), titled &quot;The wolf and the shepherd&quot;, celebrating Russia&#x27;s resistance. The fable of &quot;The swan, the pike and the crawfish&quot;, all of them pulling a cart in a different direction, originally commented sceptically on a new phase in the campaign against Napoleon in the coalition of 1814 (although some interpreters tend to see it as an allusion to the endless debates of the State Council). It was reused for a satirical print in 1854 with reference to the alliance between France, Britain and Turkey at the start of the Crimean War. Then in 1906 it was applied to agricultural policy in a new caricature.
The fables have appeared in a great variety of formats, including as illustrations on postcards and on matchbox covers.). The four animals from the very popular &quot;The Quartet&quot; also appeared as a set, modeled by Boris Vorobyov for the Lomonosov Porcelain Factory in 1949. This was the perfect choice of subject, since the humour of Krylov&#x27;s poem centres on their wish to get the seating arrangement right as an aid to their performance. The format therefore allows them to be placed in the various positions described in the fable.

Not all the fables confined themselves to speaking animals and one humorous human subject fitted the kind of genre paintings of peasant interiors by those from the emerging Realist school. This scenario was &quot;Demyan&#x27;s Fish Soup&quot;, in which a guest is plied with far more than he can eat. Two of those who took the subject up were Andrei M.Volkov (1829-1873) in 1857, and Andrei Popov (1832–1896) in 1865 (see left). Another fable, originally adapted from La Fontaine&#x27;s &quot;La Fille&quot;, was Krylov&#x27;s &quot;The Dainty Spinster&quot;, which lent itself to the social satire of Pavel Fedotov&#x27;s painting of 1847. That depicts the aging maid accepting the proposal of a balding, hunchbacked suitor who kneels at her feet, while her anxious father listens behind a curtained doorway. In 1976, the painting was featured on a Soviet postage stamp.

Illustrated books of Krylov&#x27;s fables have continued in popularity and at the start of the 20th century the styles of other new art movements were applied to the fables. In 1911 Heorhiy Narbut provided attractive Art Nouveau silhouettes for &quot;3 Fables of Krylov&quot;, which included &quot;The beggar and fortune&quot; (see below) and &quot;Death and the peasant&quot;. A decade later, when the artistic avant-garde was giving its support to the Russian Revolution, elements of various schools were incorporated by Aleksandr Deyneka into a 1922 edition of the fables. In &quot;The cook and the cat&quot; it is Expressionism, while the pronounced diagonal of Constructivism is introduced into &quot;Death and the peasant&quot;.

When Socialist realism was decreed shortly afterwards, such experiments were no longer possible. However, &quot;Demyan&#x27;s Fish Soup&quot; reappears as a suitable peasant subject in the traditional Palekh miniatures of Aristarkh A.Dydykin (1874 - 1954). Some of these was executed in bright colours on black lacquered papier-mâché rondels during the 1930s, but prior to that he had decorated a soup plate with the same design in different colours. In this attractive 1928 product the action takes place in three bands across the bowl of the dish, with the guest taking flight in the final one. With him runs the cat which was rubbing itself against his leg in the middle episode. About the rim jolly fish sport tail to tail.

===Musical settings===
Musical adaptations of the fables have been more limited. In 1851, Anton Rubinstein set &quot;5 Krylov Fables&quot; for voice and piano, pieces republished in Leipzig in 1864 to a German translation. These included &quot;The quartet&quot;, &quot;The eagle and the cuckoo&quot;, &quot;The ant and the dragonfly&quot;, &quot;The ass and the nightingale&quot;, and &quot;Parnassus&quot;. He was followed by Alexander Gretchaninov, who set &quot;4 Fables after Ivan Krylov&quot; for medium voice and piano (op.33), which included &quot;The musicians&quot;, &quot;The peasant and the sheep&quot;, &quot;The eagle and the bee&quot;, and &quot;The bear among the bees&quot;. This was followed in 1905 by &quot;2 Fables after Krylov&quot; for mixed a cappella choir (op.36), including &quot;The frog and the ox&quot; and &quot;The swan, the pike and the crayfish&quot;. At about this time too, Vladimir Rebikov wrote a stage work titled &quot;Krylov&#x27;s Fables&quot; and made some settings under the title &quot;Fables in Faces&quot; (&quot;Basni v litsach&quot;) that are reported to have been Sergei Prokofiev’s model for &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;.

In 1913, Cesar Cui set &quot;5 Fables of Ivan Krylov&quot; (Op.90) and in 1922 the youthful Dmitri Shostakovich set two by Krylov for solo voice and piano accompaniment (op.4), &quot;The dragonfly and the ant&quot; and &quot;The ass and the nightingale&quot;. &quot;The dragonfly&quot;, a ballet based on the first of these fables, was created by Leonid Yakobson for performance at the Bolshoi in 1947 but it was withdrawn at the last moment due to political infighting.

==The Russian La Fontaine==

Krylov is sometimes referred to as &#x27;the Russian La Fontaine&#x27; because, though he was not the first of the Russian fabulists, he became the foremost and is the one whose reputation has lasted, but the comparison between the two men can be extended further. Their fables were also the fruit of their mature years; they were long meditated and then distilled in the language and form most appropriate to them. La Fontaine knew Latin and so was able to consult classical versions of Aesop&#x27;s fables in that language – or, as in the case of &quot;The Banker and the Cobbler&quot;, to transpose an anecdote in a poem by Horace into his own time. Krylov had learned French while still a child and his early work followed La Fontaine closely. Though he lacked Latin, he taught himself Koine Greek from a New Testament in about 1819, and so was able to read Aesop in the original rather than remaining reliant on La Fontaine&#x27;s recreations of Latin versions. The major difference between them, however, was that La Fontaine created very few fables of his own, whereas the bulk of Krylov&#x27;s work after 1809 was either indebted to other sources only for the germ of the idea or the fables were of his invention

Krylov&#x27;s first three fables, published in a Moscow magazine in 1806, followed La Fontaine&#x27;s wording closely; the majority of those in his 1809 collection were likewise adaptations of La Fontaine. Thereafter he was more often indebted to La Fontaine for themes, although his treatment of the story was independent. It has been observed that in general Krylov tends to add more detail in contrast with La Fontaine&#x27;s leaner versions and that, where La Fontaine is an urbane moralist, Krylov is satirical. But one might cite the opposite approach in Krylov&#x27;s pithy summation of La Fontaine&#x27;s lengthy &quot;The Man who Runs after Fortune&quot; (VII.12) in his own &quot;Man and his shadow&quot;. Much the same can be said of his treatment of &quot;The Fly and the Bee&quot; (La Fontaine&#x27;s The Fly and the Ant, IV.3) and &quot;The Wolf and the Shepherds&quot; (La Fontaine&#x27;s X.6), which dispense with the circumstantiality of the original and retain little more than the reasoning.

The following are the fables that are based, with more or less fidelity, on those of La Fontaine:

* The Frogs who Begged for a Tsar (III.4)
* The Man and the Lion (III.10)

<text>Very low frequency or VLF is the ITU designation for radio frequencies (RF) in the range of 3–30 kHz, corresponding to wavelengths from 100 to 10 km, respectively. The band is also known as the myriameter band or myriameter wave as the wavelengths range from one to ten myriameters (an obsolete metric unit equal to 10 kilometers). Due to its limited bandwidth, audio (voice) transmission is highly impractical in this band, and therefore only low-data-rate coded signals are used. The VLF band is used for a few radio navigation services, government time radio stations (broadcasting time signals to set radio clocks) and secure military communication. Since VLF waves can penetrate at least 40 meters (131 ft) into saltwater, they are used for military communication with submarines.

==Propagation characteristics==
Because of their long wavelengths, VLF radio waves can diffract around large obstacles and so are not blocked by mountain ranges, and they can propagate as ground waves following the curvature of the Earth and so are not limited by the horizon. Ground waves are absorbed by the resistance of the Earth and are less important beyond several hundred to a thousand kilometres/miles, and the main mode of long-distance propagation is an Earth–ionosphere waveguide mechanism. The Earth is surrounded by a conductive layer of electrons and ions in the upper atmosphere at the bottom of the ionosphere called the D layer at 60–90 km (37–56 miles) altitude, which reflects VLF radio waves. The conductive ionosphere and the conductive Earth form a horizontal &quot;duct&quot; a few VLF wavelengths high, which acts as a waveguide confining the waves so they don&#x27;t escape into space. The waves travel in a zig-zag path around the Earth, reflected alternately by the Earth and the ionosphere, in transverse magnetic (TM) mode.

VLF waves have very low path attenuation, 2–3 dB per 1,000 km, with little of the &quot;fading&quot; experienced at higher frequencies. This is because VLF waves are reflected from the bottom of the ionosphere, while higher frequency shortwave signals are returned to Earth from higher layers in the ionosphere, the F1 and F2 layers, by a refraction process, and spend most of their journey in the ionosphere, so they are much more affected by ionization gradients and turbulence. Therefore, VLF transmissions are very stable and reliable, and are used for long-distance communication. Propagation distances of 5,000–20,000 km have been realized. However, atmospheric noise (&quot;sferics&quot;) is high in the band, including such phenomena as &quot;whistlers&quot;, caused by lightning.
* VLF waves can penetrate seawater to a depth of at least 10–40 meters (30–130 feet), depending on the frequency employed and the salinity of the water, so they are used to communicate with submarines.
* VLF waves at certain frequencies have been found to cause electron precipitation.
* VLF waves used to communicate with submarines have created an artificial bubble around the Earth that can protect it from solar flares and coronal mass ejections; this occurred through interaction with high-energy radiation particles.
==Antennas==
A major practical drawback to the VLF band is that because of the length of the waves, full size resonant antennas (half wave dipole or quarter wave monopole antennas) cannot be built because of their physical height. Vertical antennas must be used because VLF waves propagate in vertical polarization, but a quarter-wave vertical antenna at 30 kHz (10 km wavelength) would be high. So practical transmitting antennas are electrically short, a small fraction of the length at which they would be self-resonant. Due to their low radiation resistance (often less than one ohm) they are inefficient, radiating only 10% to 50% of the transmitter power at most, with the rest of the power dissipated in the antenna/ground system resistances. Very high power transmitters (~1 megawatt) are required for long-distance communication, so the efficiency of the antenna is an important factor.

=== VLF transmitting antennas ===
High power VLF transmitting stations use capacitively-toploaded monopole antennas. These are very large wire antennas, up to several kilometers long. They consist of a series of steel radio masts, linked at the top with a network of cables, often shaped like an umbrella or clotheslines. Either the towers themselves or vertical wires serve as monopole radiators, and the horizontal cables form a &quot;capacitive top-load&quot; to increase the current in the vertical wires, increasing the radiated power and efficiency of the antenna. High-power stations use variations on the umbrella antenna such as the &quot;delta&quot; and &quot;trideco&quot; antennas, or multiwire flattop (triatic) antennas. For low-power transmitters, inverted-L and T antennas are used.

Due to the low radiation resistance, to minimize power dissipated in the ground these antennas require extremely low resistance ground (Earthing) systems, consisting of radial networks of buried copper wires under the antenna. To minimize dielectric losses in the soil, the ground conductors are buried shallowly, only a few inches in the ground, and the ground surface near the antenna is sometimes protected by copper ground screens. Counterpoise systems have also been used, consisting of radial networks of copper cables supported several feet above the ground under the antenna.

A large loading coil is required at the antenna feed point to cancel the capacitive reactance of the antenna to make it resonant. At VLF the design of this coil is challenging; it must have low resistance at the operating RF frequency, high, must handle very high currents, and must withstand the extremely high voltage on the antenna. These are usually huge air core coils 2-4 meters high wound on a nonconductive frame, with RF resistance reduced by using thick litz wire several centimeters in diameter, consisting of thousands of insulated strands of fine wire braided together. 

The high capacitance and inductance and low resistance of the antenna-loading coil combination makes it act electrically like a high tuned circuit. VLF antennas have very narrow bandwidth and to change the transmitting frequency requires a variable inductor (variometer) to tune the antenna. The large VLF antennas used for high-power transmitters usually have bandwidths of only 50–100 hertz. The high results in very high voltages (up to 250 kV) on the antenna and very good insulation is required. Large VLF antennas usually operate in &#x27;voltage limited&#x27; mode: the maximum power of the transmitter is limited by the voltage the antenna can accept without air breakdown, corona, and arcing from the antenna.

=== Dynamic antenna tuning ===
The bandwidth of large capacitively loaded VLF antennas is so narrow (50–100 Hz) that even the small frequency shifts of FSK and MSK modulation may exceed it, throwing the antenna out of resonance, causing the antenna to reflect some power back down the feedline. The traditional solution is to use a &quot;bandwidth resistor&quot; in the antenna which reduces the , increasing the bandwidth; however this also reduces the power output. A recent alternative used in some military VLF transmitters is a circuit which dynamically shifts the antenna&#x27;s resonant frequency between the two output frequencies with the modulation. This is accomplished with a saturable reactor in series with the antenna loading coil. This is a ferromagnetic core inductor with a second control winding through which a DC current flows, which controls the inductance by magnetizing the core, changing its permeability. The keying datastream is applied to the control winding. So when the frequency of the transmitter is shifted between the &#x27;1&#x27; and &#x27;0&#x27; frequencies, the saturable reactor changes the inductance in the antenna resonant circuit to shift the antenna resonant frequency to follow the transmitter&#x27;s frequency.

=== VLF receiving antennas ===
The requirements for receiving antennas are less stringent, because of the high level of natural atmospheric noise in the band. At VLF frequencies atmospheric radio noise is far above the receiver noise introduced by the receiver circuit and determines the receiver signal-to-noise ratio. So small inefficient receiving antennas can be used, and the low voltage signal from the antenna can simply be amplified by the receiver without introducing significant noise. Ferrite loop antennas are usually used for reception.

== Modulation ==
Because of the small bandwidth of the band, and the extremely narrow bandwidth of the antennas used, it is impractical to transmit audio signals (AM or FM radiotelephony). A typical AM radio signal with a bandwidth of 10 kHz would occupy one third of the VLF band. More significantly, it would be difficult to transmit any distance because it would require an antenna with 100 times the bandwidth of current VLF antennas, which due to the Chu-Harrington limit would be enormous in size. Therefore, only text data can be transmitted, at low bit rates. In military networks frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulation is used to transmit radioteletype data using 5 bit ITA2 or 8 bit ASCII character codes. A small frequency shift of 30–50 hertz is used due to the small bandwidth of the antenna.

In high power VLF transmitters, to increase the allowable data rate, a special form of FSK called minimum-shift keying (MSK) is used. This is required due to the high of the antenna. The huge capacitively-loaded antenna and loading coil form a high tuned circuit, which stores oscillating electrical energy. The of large VLF antennas is typically over 200; this means the antenna stores far more energy (200 times as much) than is supplied or radiated in any single cycle of the transmitter current. The energy is stored alternately as electrostatic energy in the topload and ground system, and magnetic energy in the vertical wires and loading coil. VLF antennas typically operate &quot;voltage-limited&quot;, with the voltage on the antenna close to the limit that the insulation will stand, so they will not tolerate any abrupt change in the voltage or current from the transmitter without arcing or other insulation problems. As described below, MSK is able to modulate the transmitted wave at higher data rates without causing voltage spikes on the antenna.

The three types of modulation that have been used in VLF transmitters are:
;Continuous Wave (CW), Interrupted Continuous Wave (ICW), or On-Off Keying: Morse code radiotelegraphy transmission with unmodulated carrier. The carrier is turned on and off, with carrier on representing the Morse code &quot;dots&quot; and &quot;dashes&quot; and carrier off representing spaces. The simplest and earliest form of radio data transmission, this was used from the beginning of the 20th century to the 1960s in commercial and military VLF stations. Because of the high antenna the carrier cannot be switched abruptly on and off but requires a long time constant, many cycles, to build up the oscillating energy in the antenna when the carrier turns on, and many cycles to dissipate the stored energy when the carrier turns off. This limits the data rate that can be transmitted to 15–20 words/minute. CW is now only used in small hand-keyed transmitters, and for testing large transmitters.
;Frequency-shift keying (FSK): FSK is the second oldest and second simplest form of digital radio data modulation, after CW. For FSK, the carrier shifted between two frequencies, one representing the binary digit &#x27;1&#x27; and the other representing binary &#x27;0&#x27;. For example, a frequency of 9070 Hz might be used to indicate a &#x27;1&#x27; and the frequency 9020 Hz, 50 Hz lower, to indicate a &#x27;0&#x27;. The two frequencies are generated by a continuously-running frequency synthesizer. The transmitter is periodically switched between these frequencies to represent 8 bit ASCII codes for the characters of the message. A problem at VLF is that when the frequency is switched the two sine waves usually have different phases, which creates a sudden phase-shift transient which can cause arcing on the antenna. To avoid arcing, FSK can only be used at slow rates of 50–75 bit/s.
;Minimum-shift keying (MSK): A continuous phase version of FSK designed specifically for small bandwidths, this was adopted by naval VLF stations in the 1970s to increase the data rate and is now the standard mode used in military VLF transmitters. If the two frequencies representing &#x27;1&#x27; and &#x27;0&#x27; are 50 Hz apart, the standard frequency shift used in military VLF stations, their phases coincide every 20 ms. In MSK the frequency of the transmitter is switched only when the two sine waves have the same phase, at the point both sine waves cross zero in the same direction. This creates a smooth continuous transition between the waves, avoiding transients which can cause stress and arcing on the antenna. MSK can be used at data rates up to 300 bit/s, or about 35 ASCII characters (8 bits each) per second, approximately 450 words per minute.

Historically, this band was used for long distance transoceanic radio communication during the wireless telegraphy era between about 1905 and 1925. Nations built networks of high-power LF and VLF radiotelegraphy stations that transmitted text information by Morse code, to communicate with other countries, their colonies, and naval fleets. Early attempts were made to use radiotelephone using amplitude modulation and single-sideband modulation within the band starting from 20 kHz, but the result was unsatisfactory because the available bandwidth was insufficient to contain the sidebands.

In the 1920s the discovery of the skywave (skip) radio propagation method allowed lower power transmitters operating at high frequency to communicate at similar distances by reflecting their radio waves off a layer of ionized atoms in the ionosphere, and long-distance radio communication stations switched to the shortwave frequencies. The Grimeton VLF transmitter at Grimeton near Varberg in Sweden, one of the few remaining transmitters from that era that has been preserved as a historical monument, can be visited by the public at certain times, such as on Alexanderson Day.

=== Navigation beacons and time signals ===
Due to its long propagation distances and stable phase characteristics, during the 20th century the VLF band was used for long range hyperbolic radio navigation systems which allowed ships and aircraft to determine their geographical position by comparing the phase of radio waves received from fixed VLF navigation beacon transmitters.

The worldwide Omega system used frequencies from 10 to 14 kHz, as did Russia&#x27;s Alpha.

VLF was also used for standard time and frequency broadcasts. In the US, the time signal station WWVL began transmitting a 500 W signal on 20 kHz in August 1963. It used frequency-shift keying (FSK) to send data, shifting between 20 kHz and 26 kHz. The WWVL service was discontinued in July 1972.

=== Geophysical and atmospheric measurement ===
Naturally occurring signals in the VLF band are used by geophysicists for long range lightning location and for research into atmospheric phenomena such as the aurora. Measurements of whistlers are employed to infer the physical properties of the magnetosphere.

Geophysicists use VLF-electromagnetic receivers to measure conductivity in the near surface of the Earth.

VLF signals can be measured as a geophysical electromagnetic survey that relies on transmitted currents inducing secondary responses in conductive geologic units. A VLF anomaly represents a change in the attitude of the electromagnetic vector overlying conductive materials in the subsurface.

=== Mine communication systems ===
VLF can also penetrate soil and rock for some distance, so these frequencies are also used for through-the-earth mine communications systems.

=== Military communications ===
Powerful VLF transmitters are used by the military to communicate with their forces worldwide. The advantage of VLF frequencies is their long range, high reliability, and the prediction that in a nuclear war VLF communications will be less disrupted by nuclear explosions than higher frequencies. Since it can penetrate seawater VLF is used by the military to communicate with submarines near the surface, while ELF frequencies are used for deeply submerged subs.

Examples of naval VLF transmitters are
* Britain&#x27;s Skelton Transmitting Station in Skelton, Cumbria
* Germany&#x27;s DHO38 in Rhauderfehn, which transmits on 23.4 kHz with a power of 800 kW
* U.S. Jim Creek Naval Radio Station in Oso, Washington state, which transmits on 24.8 kHz with a power of 1.2 MW
* U.S. Cutler Naval Radio Station at Cutler, Maine which transmits on 24 kHz with 1.8 MW.

Since 2004 the US Navy has stopped using ELF transmissions, with the statement that improvements in VLF communication has made them unnecessary, so it may have developed technology to allow submarines to receive VLF transmissions while at operating depth.

High power land-based and aircraft transmitters in countries that operate submarines send signals that can be received thousands of miles away. Transmitter sites typically cover great areas (many acres or square kilometers), with transmitted power anywhere from 20 kW to 2,000 kW. Submarines receive signals from land based and aircraft transmitters using some form of towed antenna that floats just under the surface of the water – for example a Buoyant Cable Array Antenna (BCAA).

Modern receivers use sophisticated digital signal processing techniques to remove the effects of atmospheric noise (largely caused by lightning strikes around the world) and adjacent channel signals, extending the useful reception range. Strategic nuclear bombers of the United States Air Force receive VLF signals as part of hardened nuclear resilient operations.

Two alternative character sets may be used: 5 bit ITA2 or 8 bit ASCII. Because these are military transmissions they are almost always encrypted for security reasons. Although it is relatively easy to receive the transmissions and convert them into a string of characters, enemies cannot decode the encrypted messages; military communications usually use unbreakable one-time pad ciphers since the amount of text is so small.

==Amateur use==
The frequency range below 8.3 kHz is not allocated by the International Telecommunication Union and in some nations may be used license-free.
Radio amateurs in some countries have been granted permission (or have assumed permission) to operate at frequencies below 8.3 kHz.

Operations tend to congregate around the frequencies 8.27 kHz, 6.47 kHz, 5.17 kHz, and 2.97 kHz. Transmissions typically last from one hour up to several days and both receiver and transmitter must have their frequency locked to a stable reference such as a GPS disciplined oscillator or a rubidium standard in order to support such long duration coherent detection and decoding.

===Amateur equipment===
Radiated power from amateur stations is very small, ranging from 1 μW to 100 μW for fixed base station antennas, and up to 10 mW from kite or balloon antennas. Despite the low power, stable propagation with low attenuation in the earth-ionosphere cavity enable very narrow bandwidths to be used to reach distances up to several thousand kilometers. The modes used are QRSS, MFSK, and coherent BPSK.

The transmitter generally consists of an audio amplifier of a few hundred watts, an impedance matching transformer, a loading coil and a large wire antenna. Receivers employ an electric field probe or magnetic loop antenna, a sensitive audio preamplifier, isolating transformers, and a PC sound card to digitise the signal. Extensive digital signal processing is required to retrieve the weak signals from beneath interference from power line harmonics and VLF radio atmospherics. Useful received signal strengths are as low as  volts/meter (electric field) and  tesla (magnetic field), with signaling rates typically between 1 and 100 bits per hour.

===PC based reception===

VLF signals are often monitored by radio amateurs using simple homemade VLF radio receivers based on personal computers (PCs). An aerial in the form of a coil of insulated wire is connected to the input of the soundcard of the PC (via a jack plug) and placed a few meters away from it. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) software in combination with a sound card allows reception of all frequencies below the Nyquist frequency simultaneously in the form of spectrogrammes.

Because CRT monitors are strong sources of noise in the VLF range, it is recommended to record the spectrograms with any PC CRT monitors turned off. These spectrograms show many signals, which may include VLF transmitters and the horizontal electron beam deflection of TV sets. The strength of the signal received can vary with a sudden ionospheric disturbance. These cause the ionization level to increase in the ionosphere producing a rapid change to the amplitude and phase of the received VLF signal.

<text>In computing, a hardware random number generator (HRNG), true random number generator (TRNG), non-deterministic random bit generator (NRBG), or physical random number generator is a device that generates random numbers from a physical process capable of producing entropy (in other words, the device always has access to a physical entropy source), unlike the pseudorandom number generator (PRNG, a.k.a. &quot;deterministic random bit generator&quot;, DRBG) that utilizes a deterministic algorithm and non-physical nondeterministic random bit generators that do not include hardware dedicated to generation of entropy. 

Many natural phenomena generate low-level, statistically random &quot;noise&quot; signals, including thermal and shot noise, jitter and metastability of electronic circuits, Brownian motion, and atmospheric noise. Researchers also used the photoelectric effect, involving a beam splitter, other quantum phenomena, and even the nuclear decay (due to practical considerations the latter, as well as the atmospheric noise, is not viable). While &quot;classical&quot; (non-quantum) phenomena are not truly random, an unpredictable physical system is usually acceptable as a source of randomness, so the qualifiers &quot;true&quot; and &quot;physical&quot; are used interchangeably. 

A hardware random number generator is expected to output near-perfect random numbers (&quot;full entropy&quot;). A physical process usually does not have this property, and a practical TRNG typically includes a few blocks: 
* a &quot;noise source&quot; that implements the physical process producing the entropy. Usually this process is analog, so a &quot;digitizer&quot; is used to convert the output of the analog source into a binary representation;
* a &quot;conditioner&quot; (randomness extractor) that improves the quality of the random bits;
* &quot;health tests&quot;. TRNGs are mostly used in cryptographical algorithms that get completely broken if the random numbers have low entropy, so the testing functionality is usually included.

Hardware random number generators generally produce only a limited number of random bits per second. In order to increase the available output data rate, they are often used to generate the &quot;seed&quot; for a faster PRNG. DRBG also helps with the noise source &quot;anonymization&quot; (whitening out the noise source identifying characteristics) and entropy extraction. With a proper DRBG algorithm selected (cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator, CSPRNG), the combination can satisfy the requirements of Federal Information Processing Standards and Common Criteria standards.

== Uses ==

Hardware random number generators can be used in any application that needs randomness. However, in many scientific applications additional cost and complexity of a TRNG (when compared with pseudo random number generators) provide no meaningful benefits. TRNGs have additional drawbacks for data science and statistical applications: impossibility to re-run a series of numbers unless they are stored, reliance on an analog physical entity can obscure the failure of the source. The TRNGs therefore are primarily used in the applications where their unpredictability and the impossibility to re-run the sequence of numbers are crucial to the success of the implementation: in cryptography and gambling machines. 

=== Cryptography ===
The major use for hardware random number generators is in the field of data encryption, for example to create random cryptographic keys and nonces needed to encrypt and sign data. In addition to randomness, there are at least two additional requirements imposed by the cryptographic applications:
# forward secrecy guarantees that the knowledge of the past output and internal state of the device should not enable the attacker to predict future data; 
# backward secrecy protects the &quot;opposite direction&quot;: knowledge of the output and internal state in the future should not divulge the preceding data.
A typical way to fulfill these requirements is to use a TRNG to seed a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator.

== History ==
Physical devices were used to generate random numbers for thousands of years, primarily for gambling. Dice in particular have been known for more than 5000 years (found on locations in modern Iraq and Iran), and flipping 
a coin (thus producing a random bit) dates at least to the times of ancient Rome.

The first documented use of a physical random number generator for scientific purposes was by Francis Galton (1890). He devised a way to sample a probability distribution using a common gambling dice. In addition to the top digit, Galton also looked at the face of a dice closest to him, thus creating 6*4 = 24 outcomes (about 4.6 bits of randomness). 

Kendall and Babington-Smith (1938) used a fast-rotating 10-sector disk that was illuminated by periodic bursts of light. The sampling was done by a human who wrote the number under the light beam onto a pad. The device was utilized to produce a 100,000-digit random number table (at the time such tables were used for statistical experiments, like PRNG nowadays).

On 29 April 1947, the RAND Corporation began generating random digits with an &quot;electronic roulette wheel&quot;, consisting of a random frequency pulse source of about 100,000 pulses per second gated once per second with a constant frequency pulse and fed into a five-bit binary counter. Douglas Aircraft built the equipment, implementing Cecil Hasting&#x27;s suggestion (RAND P-113) for a noise source (most likely the well known behavior of the 6D4 miniature gas thyratron tube, when placed in a magnetic field). Twenty of the 32 possible counter values were mapped onto the 10 decimal digits and the other 12 counter values were discarded. The results of a long run from the RAND machine, filtered and tested, were converted into a table, which originally existed only as a deck of punched cards, but was later published in 1955 as a book, 50 rows of 50 digits on each page (&quot;A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates&quot;). The RAND table was a significant breakthrough in delivering random numbers because such a large and carefully prepared table had never before been available. It has been a useful source for simulations, modeling, and for deriving the arbitrary constants in cryptographic algorithms to demonstrate that the constants had not been selected maliciously (&quot;nothing up my sleeve numbers&quot;). 

Since the early 1950s, research into TRNGs has been highly active, with thousands of research works published and about 2000 patents granted by 2017.

== Physical phenomena with random properties ==
Multiple different TRNG designs were proposed over time with a large variety of noise sources and digitization techniques (&quot;harvesting&quot;). However, practical considerations (size, power, cost, performance, robustness) dictate the following desirable traits:
* use of a commonly available inexpensive silicon process;
* exclusive use of digital design techniques. This allows an easier system-on-chip integration and enables the use of FPGAs;
* compact and low-power design. This discourages use of analog components (e.g., amplifiers);
* mathematical justification of the entropy collection mechanisms.

Stipčević &amp; Koç in 2014 classified the physical phenomena used to implement TRNG into four groups:
* electrical noise;
* free-running oscillators;
* chaos;
* quantum effects.

=== Electrical noise-based RNG ===
Noise-based RNGs generally follow the same outline: the source of a noise generator is fed into a comparator. If the voltage is above threshold, the comparator output is 1, otherwise 0. The random bit value is latched using a flip-flop. Sources of noise vary and include:
* Johnson–Nyquist noise (&quot;thermal noise&quot;);
* Zener noise;
* avalanche breakdown.
The drawbacks of using noise sources for an RNG design are:
* noise levels are hard to control, they vary with environmental changes and device-to-device;
* calibration processes needed to ensure a guaranteed amount of entropy are time-consuming;
* noise levels are typically low, thus the design requires power-hungry amplifiers. The sensitivity of amplifier inputs enables manipulation by an attacker;
* circuitry located nearby generates a lot of non-random noise thus lowering the entropy;
* a proof of randomness is near-impossible as multiple interacting physical processes are involved.

=== Chaos-based RNG ===
The idea of chaos-based noise stems from the use of a complex system that is hard to characterize by observing its behavior over time. For example, lasers can be put into (undesirable in other applications) chaos mode with chaotically fluctuating power, with power detected using a photodiode and sampled by a comparator. The design can be quite small, as all photonics elements can be integrated on-chip. Stipčević &amp; Koç characterize this technique as &quot;most objectionable&quot;, mostly due to the fact that chaotic behavior is usually controlled by a differential equation and no new randomness is introduced, thus there is a possibility of the chaos-based TRNG producing a limited subset of possible output strings.

=== Free-running oscillators-based RNG ===
The TRNGs based on a free-running oscillator (FRO) typically utilize one or more ring oscillators (ROs), outputs of which are sampled using yet another clock. Since inverters forming the RO can be thought of as amplifiers with a very large gain, an FRO output exhibits very fast oscillations in phase and frequency domains. The FRO-based TRNGs are very popular due to their use of the standard digital logic despite issues with randomness proofs and chip-to-chip variability.

=== Quantum-based RNG ===
Quantum random number generation technology is well established with 8 commercial quantum random number generator (QRNG) products offered before 2017.

Herrero-Collantes &amp; Garcia-Escartin list the following stochastic processes as &quot;quantum&quot;:
* nuclear decay historically was the earliest quantum method used since the 1960s owing its popularity to the availability of Geiger counters and calibrated radiation sources. The entropy harvesting was done using an event counter that was periodically sampled or a time counter that was sampled at the time of the event. Similar designs were utilized in the 1950s to generate random noise in analog computers. The major drawbacks were radiation safety concerns, low bit rates, and non-uniform distribution;
* shot noise, a quantum mechanical noise source found in electronic circuits, while technically a quantum effect, is hard to isolate from the thermal noise, so, with few exceptions, noise sources utilizing it are only partially quantum and are usually classified as &quot;classical&quot;;
* quantum optics:
** &quot;branching path generator&quot; using a beamsplitter so that a photon from a single-photon source randomly takes one of the two paths and sensed by one of the two single-photon detectors thus generating a random bit;
** &quot;time of arrival generators&quot; and &quot;photon counting generators&quot; use a weak photon source, with the entropy harvested similarly to the case of radioactive decay;
** &quot;attenuated pulse generators&quot; are a generalization (simplifying the equipment) of the above methods that allows more than one photon in the system at a time; 
** &quot;vacuum fluctuations generators&quot; use a laser homodyne detection to probe the changes in the vacuum state;
** &quot;laser phase noise generators&quot; use the phase noise on the output of a single spatial mode laser that is converted to amplitude using an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The noise is sampled by a photodetector; 
** amplified spontaneous emission generators use spontaneous light emission present in the optical amplifiers as a source of noise;
** &quot;Raman scattering generators&quot; extract entropy from the interaction of photons with the solid-state materials; 
** &quot;optical parametric oscillator generators&quot; use the spontaneous parametric down-conversion leading to binary phase state selection in a degenerate optical parametric oscillator;
To reduce costs and increase robustness of quantum random number generators, online services have been implemented.

A plurality of quantum random number generators designs are inherently untestable and thus can be manipulated by adversaries. Mannalath et al. call these designs &quot;trusted&quot; in a sense that they can only operate in a fully controlled, trusted environment.

== Performance test ==
The failure of a TRNG can be quite complex and subtle, necessitating validation of not just the results (the output bit stream), but of the unpredictability of the entropy source. Hardware random number generators should be constantly monitored for proper operation to protect against the entropy source degradation due to natural causes and deliberate attacks. FIPS Pub 140-2 and NIST Special Publication 800-90B define tests which can be used for this. 

The minimal set of real-time tests mandated by the certification bodies is not large; for example, NIST in SP 800-90B requires just two &quot;continuous health tests&quot;:
# &quot;repetition count test&quot; checks that the sequences of identical digits are not too long, for a (typical) case of a TRNG that digitizes one bit at a time, this means not having long strings of either 0s or 1s;
# &quot;adaptive proportion test&quot; verifies that any random digit does not occur too frequently in the data stream (low bias). For bit-oriented entropy sources that means that the count of 1s and 0s in the bit stream is approximately the same.

=== Attacks ===

Just as with other components of a cryptography system, a cryptographic random number generator should be designed to resist certain attacks. Defending against these attacks is difficult without a hardware entropy source.

The physical processes in HRNG introduce new attack surfaces. For example, a free-running oscillator-based TRNG can be attacked using a frequency injection.

=== Estimating entropy ===
There are mathematical techniques for estimating the entropy of a sequence of symbols. None are so reliable that their estimates can be fully relied upon; there are always assumptions which may be very difficult to confirm. These are useful for determining if there is enough entropy in a seed pool, for example, but they cannot, in general, distinguish between a true random source and a pseudorandom generator. This problem is avoided by the conservative use of hardware entropy sources.

<text>Korea has had administrative districts that can be considered provinces since the 7th century. These divisions were initially called &quot;ju&quot; () in Unified Silla and Later Baekje, and there were nine in total. After Goryeo conquered these states in the 10th century, twelve divisions called &quot;mok&quot; () were established, although they were reorganized into ten &quot;do&quot; () in the 11th century.

After Joseon&#x27;s conquest of Goryeo, it established the Eight Provinces in 1413. These provincial boundaries closely reflected major regional and dialect boundaries, and are still significant in contemporary Korea. In 1895, as part of the Gabo Reform, the country was redivided into 23 districts (&quot;Bu;&quot; 부; ), which were replaced a year later by thirteen new provinces. The thirteen provinces of 1896 included three of the original eight provinces, with the five remaining original provinces divided into north and south halves (&quot;Bukdo&quot; (북도; ) and &quot;Namdo&quot; (남도; ) respectively). The thirteen provinces remained unchanged throughout the Japanese colonial period.

With the liberation of Korea in 1945, the Korean peninsula was divided into North Korea and South Korea, with the dividing line established along the 38th parallel. Three provinces—Hwanghae, Gyeonggi, and Gangwon (Kangwŏn)—were modified or split as a part of this. The special cities of Seoul (South Korea) and P&#x27;yŏngyang (North Korea) were formed in 1946. Between 1946 and 1954, five new provinces were created: Jeju in South Korea, and North and South Hwanghae, Chagang, and Ryanggang in North Korea. With the freezing of the Korean War in 1953, provincial boundaries were again modified between the two Koreas, and have since remained mostly unchanged; new cities and special administrative regions have since been created in their provinces.

==Provinces of Unified Silla==

The Korean peninsula was mostly unified for the first time by the state Silla in the 7th century. Silla&#x27;s capital was Geumseong (now Gyeongju). It had five sub-capitals () at Geumgwan-gyeong (, now Gimhae), Namwon-gyeong (남원경, Namwon), Seowon-gyeong (, Cheongju), Jungwon-gyeong (, Chungju), and Bugwon-gyeong (, Wonju).

The country was divided into nine provinces (): three in the pre-660 territory of Silla, and three each in the territories of the former kingdoms Baekje and Goguryeo.

==Provinces of Goryeo==

Goryeo was established in the 10th century, and had its capital at Gaegyeong (now Kaesong). It conquered Silla and Later Baekje, and also conquered parts of the former territory of Goguryeo. Goryeo had three subcapitals: Donggyeong (now Gyeongju), Namgyeong (now Seoul), and Seogyeong (now Pyongyang).

Goryeo reorganized its provinces several times. Originally, the country had one royal district () around Gaegyeong and twelve administrative districts (). In 995, the twelve districts were redivided into ten provinces (). In 1005, the ten provinces were again redivided, this time into five provinces and two frontier districts (). Gyojudo later became its own province after 1178, making it six provinces and two frontier districts.

==Provinces of Joseon==



In 1413, Korea (at that time called Joseon) was divided into eight provinces: Chungcheong, Gangwon, Gyeonggi, Gyeongsang, Jeolla, Hamgyŏng (originally called Yeonggil), Hwanghae (originally called P&#x27;unghae), and P&#x27;yŏngan.

===Districts of Late Joseon period===
In 1895, Korea was redivided into 23 districts (&quot;Bu;&quot; 부; ), each named for the city or county that was its capital. The districts were short-lived, however, as the following year, the provincial system was restored.
*Andong
*Chuncheon
*Chungju
*Daegu
*Dongnae
*Gangneung
*Gongju
*Haeju
*Hamhŭng
*Hanseong
*Hongju
*Incheon
*Jeju
*Jeonju
*Jinju
*Kaesŏng
*Kanggye
*Kapsan
*Kyŏngsŏng
*Naju
*Namwon
*P&#x27;yŏngyang
*Ŭiju
==Provinces of the Korean Empire==
In 1896, the former eight provinces were restored, with five of them (Chungcheong, Gyeongsang, Jeolla, Hamgyŏng, and P&#x27;yŏngan) being divided into North and South Provinces (&quot;Bukdo&quot; (북도; ) and &quot;Namdo&quot; (남도; ) respectively). The resulting system of thirteen provinces lasted until the Division of Korea in 1945.

The thirteen provinces were: North and South Chungcheong, Gangwon, Gyeonggi, North and South Gyeongsang, North and South Hamgyŏng, Hwanghae, North and South Jeolla, and North and South P&#x27;yŏngan.

== Provinces of Chōsen ==

Under Colonial Japanese rule, Korean provinces of Korean Empire, remained much the same, only taking on the Japanese reading of the hanja. The Provinces of Chōsen were:

==Provincial divisions since the division of Korea==

At the end of World War II in 1945, Korea was divided into Northern Korea and Southern Korea under trusteeship of the Soviet Union and the United States. The peninsula was divided at the 38th parallel in 1945. In 1948, the two zones became the independent countries of North Korea and South Korea.

Three provinces—Hwanghae, Gyeonggi, and Gangwon—were divided by the 38th parallel.

*Most of Hwanghae Province belonged to the Northern zone. The southern portion became part of Gyeonggi Province in the south.
*Most of Gyeonggi Province belonged to the Southern zone. In 1946, the northern portion became part of Hwanghae Province in the north.
*Gangwon Province was divided roughly in half, to form modern-day Gangwon Province in South Korea and Kangwon Province in North Korea. The northern province is expanded in 1946 to include some area around the city of Wonsan (Originally part of South Hamgyong Province)

Also in 1946, the cities of Seoul in the south and Pyongyang in the north separated from Gyeonggi and South Pyongan Provinces respectively to become Special Cities. Both North Korea and South Korea have subsequently upgraded other cities to a level equal to a province, and these cities (special cities of North Korea and special cities of South Korea [&quot;qq.v.&quot;]) are sometimes counted along with provinces.

Finally, the new provinces of Jeju Province (in the south, in 1946) and Chagang Province (in the north, 1949) were formed, from parts of South Jeolla and North Pyongan respectively. In 1954, Ryanggang Province was split from South Hamgyong and Hwanghae was divided into North and South Hwanghae Provinces.

The following table lists the present provincial divisions in the Korean Peninsula.

<text>Atatürk Airport is an airport currently in use for private jets. It used to be the primary international airport of Istanbul and the hub of Turkish Airlines until it was closed to commercial passenger flights on 6 April 2019. From that point, all passenger flights were transferred to the new Istanbul Airport.

== History ==
=== Growth and development ===
In 1911, a small apron with two hangars was built in Yeşilköy, Istanbul, for the Ottoman Armed Forces. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk founded Türk Tayyare Cemiyeti (Turkish Aircraft Company, today Türk Hava Kurumu - THK) in 1925. In 1933, today&#x27;s Turkish Airlines, the Türkiye Devlet Hava Yolları started its flights with two Curtiss Kingbird aircraft. Flights from Istanbul to Ankara and Athens began. The small apron was expanded and a new passenger terminal was built. This is considered the beginning of the airport&#x27;s 86-year history. It was originally named &quot;Yeşilköy Airport&quot;. In the 1980s, it was renamed &quot;Atatürk International Airport&quot;.

It served more than 60 million passengers in 2015, making it the 11th-busiest airport in the world in terms of total passenger traffic and the 10th-busiest in the world in terms of international passenger traffic. In 2017, it was Europe&#x27;s 5th-busiest airport after London–Heathrow, Paris–Charles de Gaulle, Frankfurt Airport, and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, having fallen from third place after a decline in passengers due to security fears.

=== Closure ===
Istanbul Atatürk Airport was replaced in regards to commercial passenger functions by the newly constructed Istanbul Airport, in April 2019, in order to meet Istanbul&#x27;s growing domestic and international air traffic demand as a source, destination, and transit point. Both airports were used in parallel for five months from late 2018, with the new airport gradually expanding to serve more domestic and regional destinations. On 6 April 2019, Atatürk&#x27;s &quot;IST&quot; IATA airport code was inherited by Istanbul Airport and Atatürk Airport was assigned the code &quot;ISL&quot; after the full transfer of all scheduled passenger activities to the new airport was completed. The final commercial flight, Turkish Airlines Flight 54, left Atatürk Airport on 6 April 2019 at 02:44 for Singapore.

On 5 February 2022, Turkish Cargo relocated all cargo flights and operations from their former hub at the airport to the new Istanbul Airport.

=== Atatürk Airport National Garden ===
Turkey&#x27;s government announced its plans to construct a giant park on the grounds of the former Istanbul Atatürk Airport (whose operations were transferred to the new Istanbul Airport) in 2019. The park is part of a larger urban transformation plan that seeks to correct some of the haphazard urban planning that characterised most major Turkish cities since the 1970s. Due to the little space available to construct or expand green spaces, new parks are often constructed on spots formerly occupied by factories or other major facilities.

The Atatürk Airport National Garden will be constructed on and around one of the two runways of Atatürk Airport. These runways were already rendered unusable after they were chosen as the site for Istanbul&#x27;s pandemic hospital in early 2020. More than 132,500 trees are to be planted in place of the asphalt runway and taxiways that will also help to keep the city cooler. The other runway is set to remain in use for select cargo and private jet flights, aviation fairs (such as Teknofest) and for use by the Turkish Air Force (which still maintains a small training base and museum here).

The leader of the Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP) Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu called the proposed construction of the park &quot;treason&quot; and threatened to hold those responsible to account.

==Facilities==


===Former passenger terminals===
Istanbul Atatürk Airport featured two passenger terminals linked to each other. The former domestic terminal is the older and smaller of the two terminals and exclusively handled domestic flights within Turkey. It featured its own check-in and airside facilities on the upper floor, with twelve departure gates equipped with jet bridges and five baggage claim belts on the ground level. The former international terminal was inaugurated in 2000 and used for all international flights. It featured a large main hall containing 8 check-in aisles and a wide range of airside facilities such as shops and restaurants, 34 gates equipped with jet bridges, and 7 bus-boarding stands. The arrivals floor had 11 baggage claim belts. In addition, there is a general aviation terminal to the northwest of the passenger terminals.

===Former cargo terminal===
The airport featured a dedicated cargo terminal including facilities for the handling of radioactive and refrigerated freight.

===Other facilities===
*Turkish Airlines has its headquarters in the Turkish Airlines General Management Building, located within the airport campus.
* Prima Aviation Services Inc. has its MRO facilities in new technical site at the air side Gate A.
* In May 2020, the Yeşilköy Prof. Dr. Murat Dilmener Emergency Hospital using the former site of the 35L/35R runways were opened in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey.

==Current operations==
As of April 2019, all passenger operations have been relocated to the new Istanbul Airport. As of February 2022, all cargo operations have been relocated to the new airport as well. Currently, the airport serves only private and business jets as well as operations on behalf of the Government of Turkey.

==Statistics==
Istanbul Atatürk Airport ranked 17th in ACI statistics at the end of 2011 in terms of international traffic with almost 24 million international passengers. It ranked 29th in the world in terms of total passenger traffic with over 37.4 million passengers in 2011. Its total traffic within the last decade more than tripled, and its international traffic quadrupled. Passenger statistics for Istanbul Atatürk Airport for the years 2002–2019 are below.



==Accidents and incidents==

* On 30 January 1975, Turkish Airlines Flight 345, crashed into the Sea of Marmara during its final approach to the airport. All 42 passengers and crew on board were killed.
* On 25 April 2015, Turkish Airlines Flight 1878, operated by an A320-200, TC-JPE was severely damaged in a landing accident. The aircraft aborted the first hard landing, which inflicted engine and gear damage. On the second attempt at landing, the right gear collapsed and the aircraft rolled off the runway spinning 180 degrees. All 97 passengers and 5 crew members survived with no injuries. The aircraft was written off as a result of the accident.
* On 28 June 2016, three terrorists killed 44 civilians by gunfire and subsequent suicide bombings, along with 239 civilians injured. The three men arrived in a taxi cab and opened fire at the terminal. The three men then blew themselves up when police opened fire. The airport has X-ray scanners at the entrance to the terminal but security checks for cars are limited.
* On 15 July 2016, the 2016 Turkish coup d&#x27;état attempt took place. During the attempted coup, units of the Turkish Armed Forces seized control of the airport and closed it, but it was reopened after pro-government forces regained control.

==Accolades==
* The Turkish Chamber of Civil Engineers lists İstanbul Atatürk Airport as one of the fifty civil engineering feats in Turkey, a list of remarkable engineering projects completed in the first 50 years of the chamber&#x27;s existence.
* In the 2013 Air Transport News awards ceremony, İstanbul Atatürk Airport was named &quot;Airport of the Year&quot;.
* The airport was named &quot;Europe&#x27;s Best Airport&quot; in the 40-50 million passenger per year category at the 2013 Skytrax World Airport Awards.

<doc id="160516" wikidata="Q164791" url="?curid=160516" title="Death of Carlo Giuliani">
<text>Carlo Giuliani was an Italian anti-globalization protester who was shot dead while attacking a Carabinieri van with a fire extinguisher, by an officer who was inside the van, during the anti-globalization riots outside the July 2001 G8 summit in Genoa, Italy,
making his the first death during an anti-globalization demonstration since the movement&#x27;s rise from the 1999 Seattle WTO protests.

Photographs showed Giuliani, a 23-year-old Roman living in Genoa, throwing a fire extinguisher towards the van, a pistol firing a shot in return from the van, and Giuliani&#x27;s body having been run over by the van. Charges against the officer were initially dropped without trial as a judge ruled that the ricocheted bullet was fired in self-defense, but the incident became a point of public scrutiny.

Eight years after the incident, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the Italian forces had acted within their limits, but awarded damages for the state&#x27;s procedural handling of the case. Appeals upheld the ruling, and Giuliani&#x27;s family later filed a civil suit.

Giuliani was memorialized in music tributes, such as Jaye Muller&#x27;s &quot;CARLO&quot; and public monuments, and is remembered as a symbol of the 2001 G8 protests. The 2002 documentary &quot;Carlo Giuliani, Boy&quot;, recounts the incident.

==Incident==
In July 2001, anti-globalization demonstrators protested the 27th G8 summit in Genoa, Italy, where leaders of the world&#x27;s major industrialized nations met. Among these protesters was Carlo Giuliani, a 23-year-old Roman Italian and resident of Genoa, whom a police officer shot and killed during what had become a riot two miles from the summit. It was the first death in an anti-globalization demonstration since its rise from the 1999 Seattle WTO protests. According to a Reuters photographer, who took photographs of the incident, Giuliani and several other young, male protesters had surrounded and attacked a police van with rocks and other weapons. Italian television broadcast several photographs, in which Giuliani threw a fire extinguisher at the van. A hand from inside the van then fired a pistol in response, and Giuliani collapsed behind the van. Further photographs and reports show that the van had run over his legs twice after he was shot. The Italian interior minister confirmed that Giuliani had been hit by a bullet fired in self-defense by a police officer, who was later hospitalized for his injuries.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; said it was unclear why the riot police had live ammunition, whereas other Genoa riot police used water cannons, riot sticks, and tear gas elsewhere in the city. About 1,000 people attended Giuliani&#x27;s funeral in Genoa, his coffin ornamented in ferns and A.S. Roma&#x27;s flag.

== Investigations ==
In the case against Carabiniere Mario Placanica, evidence was given by a ballistics expert that the fatal bullet had &quot;ricocheted off plaster&quot;. All charges against Mario Placanica were dropped when Judge Daloiso, who presided over the case, concluded that the fatal bullet that struck Giuliani was not directly aimed at Giuliani, and ruled that Placanica had acted in self-defense. The case was not taken to trial.

However, during a later trial in Genoa of some demonstrators allegedly involved in clashes the same day Giuliani was killed, the same forensic doctor, professor Marco Salvi, who had been a consultant to Silvio Franz, the prosecutor who led the case against Mario Placanica, testified that Giuliani had been the victim of a &quot;direct hit&quot;, thus contradicting the evidence previously given and laying doubt on the decision made based on the alleged change of direction of the bullet. Medics tending to Giuliani after he was run over testified that his heart was still beating, and this was confirmed by professor Salvi during the trial in Genoa. To confuse the situation further, in late 2003 Placanica told the Bologna daily &quot;Il Resto Del Carlino&quot; that &quot;I&#x27;ve been used to cover up the responsibility of others.&quot; He claimed that the bullet found in Giuliani&#x27;s body was not of the caliber or type fired by the pistols of the Carabinieri, and claimed the deadly shot had come from somewhere in the piazza outside.
After making this statement, Placanica was involved in a car accident that his lawyer claimed was &quot;very suspicious.&quot; Placanica was allegedly kept in seclusion following the incident, and his parents were not allowed to visit him in the hospital.

On August 25, 2009 the European Court of Human Rights notified in writing its judgement in the case of &quot;Giuliani and Gaggio vs. Italy&quot;. It ruled that no excessive force was used and it was not established that Italian authorities had failed to comply with their positive obligations to protect Carlo Giuliani&#x27;s life. However, the Court also ruled that Italy had not complied with its procedural obligations in connection with the death of Carlo Giuliani and awarded a total of € in non-pecuniary damages to the three applicants. In 2010, the case was referred to the Court&#x27;s Grand Chamber on appeals from both sides; the Grand Chamber has held in 2011, that there had been no violation of the European Convention, although seven judges from seventeen dissented.

==Legacy==

Giuliani&#x27;s&#x27; death had an immediate effect of quelling the 2001 G8 protests and the longer-term effect of reducing the public profile of the next summit. The Saturday protest in Genoa was expected to be its largest, with 100,000 participants, but turnout was halved after the killing as groups withdrew. Nonviolent demonstrators, in hindsight, distanced themselves from groups whose battles with police they blamed for ruining their peaceful message. The G8 announced that the next summit would instead be held at a remote resort at a fifth of the 2001 summit&#x27;s size to reduce opportunities for violent protest.

In 2002, Francesca Comencini directed a documentary film titled &quot;Carlo Giuliani, ragazzo&quot; about the shooting. It was screened out of competition at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival. Multiple songs have paid tribute to Giuliani&#x27;s memory.

<text>Low frequency (LF) is the ITU designation for radio frequencies (RF) in the range of 30–300 kHz. Since its wavelengths range from 10–1 km, respectively, it is also known as the kilometre band or kilometre waves.

LF radio waves exhibit low signal attenuation, making them suitable for long-distance communications. In Europe and areas of Northern Africa and Asia, part of the LF spectrum is used for AM broadcasting as the &quot;longwave&quot; band. In the western hemisphere, its main use is for aircraft beacons, navigation (LORAN, mostly defunct), information, and weather systems. A number of time signal broadcasts also use this band. The main mode of transmission used in this band is ground waves, in which LF radio waves travel just above the Earth&#x27;s surface, following the terrain. LF ground waves can travel over hills, and can travel far beyond the horizon, up to several hundred kilometers from the transmitter.

==Propagation==
Because of their long wavelength, low frequency radio waves can diffract over obstacles like mountain ranges and travel beyond the horizon, following the contour of the Earth. This mode of propagation, called &quot;ground wave&quot;, with the radio waves traveling horizontally through the atmosphere just above the surface of the Earth, is the main mode in the LF band. Ground waves are absorbed by the Earth as they travel, so the signal strength (power density) decreases exponentially with distance from the transmitting antenna, limiting transmission distance. The attenuation of signal strength with distance is lower than at higher frequencies. Low frequency ground waves can be received up to from the transmitting antenna. Ground waves must be vertically polarized (the electric field is vertical while the magnetic field is horizontal), so vertical monopole antennas are used for transmitting.

Low frequency waves can also occasionally travel long distances by reflecting from the ionosphere (the actual mechanism is one of refraction), although this method, called &quot;skywave&quot; or &quot;skip&quot; propagation, is not as common as at higher frequencies. Reflection occurs at the ionospheric E layer or F layers. Skywave signals can be detected at distances exceeding from the transmitting antenna.

==Uses==
===Radio broadcasting===

AM broadcasting is authorized in the longwave band on frequencies between 148.5 and 283.5 kHz in Europe and parts of Asia.

===Standard time signals===
In Europe and Japan, many low-cost consumer devices have since the late 1980s contained radio clocks with an LF receiver for these signals. Since these frequencies propagate by ground wave only, the precision of time signals is not affected by varying propagation paths between the transmitter, the ionosphere, and the receiver. In the United States, such devices became feasible for the mass market only after the output power of WWVB was increased in 1997 and 1999.

JJY transmitting broadcast on the exact same frequency, and has a similar timecode.

===Military===

Radio signals below 50 kHz are capable of penetrating ocean depths to approximately ; the longer the wavelength, the deeper they go. The British, German, Indian, Russian, Swedish, United States,
and possibly other navies communicate with submarines on these frequencies.

In addition, Royal Navy nuclear submarines carrying ballistic missiles are allegedly under standing orders to monitor the BBC Radio 4 transmission on 198 kHz in waters near the UK. It is rumoured that they are to construe a sudden halt in transmission, particularly of the morning news programme &quot;Today&quot;, as an indicator that the UK is under attack, whereafter their sealed orders take effect.

The United States has four LF stations maintaining contact with its submarine force: Aguada, Puerto Rico, Keflavik, Iceland, Awase, Okinawa, and Sigonella, Italy, using AN/FRT-95 solid state transmitters.

In the U.S., the Ground Wave Emergency Network or GWEN operated between 150 and 175 kHz, until replaced by satellite communications systems in 1999. GWEN was a land based military radio communications system which could survive and continue to operate even in the case of a nuclear attack.

===Experimental and amateur===
The 2007 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-07) made a worldwide amateur radio allocation in this band. An international 2.1 kHz allocation, the  (135.7–137.9 kHz) is available to amateur radio operators in several countries in Europe,
New Zealand, Canada, US,
and French overseas dependencies.

The world record distance for a two-way contact is over 10,000 km from near Vladivostok to New Zealand.
As well as conventional Morse code many operators use very slow computer-controlled Morse code (so-called &quot;QRSS&quot;) or specialized digital communications modes.

The UK allocated a 2.8 kHz sliver of spectrum from 71.6 kHz to 74.4 kHz beginning in April 1996 to UK amateurs who applied for a Notice of Variation to use the band on a noninterference basis with a maximum output power of 1 Watt ERP. This was withdrawn on 30 June 2003 after a number of extensions in favor of the cross-European standard 136 kHz band.
Very slow Morse Code from G3AQC in the UK was received away, across the Atlantic Ocean, by W1TAG in the US on 21-22 November 2001 on 72.401 kHz.

In the United States, there is an exemption within FCC Part 15 regulations permitting unlicensed transmissions in the frequency range of 160–190 kHz. Longwave radio hobbyists refer to this as the &#x27;LowFER&#x27; band, and experimenters, and their transmitters are called &#x27;LowFERs&#x27;. This frequency range between 160 kHz and 190 kHz is also referred to as the band. Requirements include:
* The total input power to the final radio frequency stage (exclusive of filament or heater power) shall not exceed one watt.
* The total length of the transmission line, antenna, and ground lead (if used) shall not exceed 15 meters.
* All emissions below 160 kHz or above 190 kHz shall be attenuated at least 20 dB below the level of the unmodulated carrier.
* As an alternative to these requirements, a field strength of 2400/F(kHz) microvolts/meter (measured at a distance of 300 meters) may be used (as described in 47CFR15.209).
* In all cases, operation may not cause harmful interference to licensed services.
Many experimenters in this band are amateur radio operators.

===Meteorological information broadcasts===

A regular service transmitting RTTY marine meteorological information in SYNOP code on LF is the German Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst or DWD). The DWD operates station DDH47 on 147.3 kHz using standard ITA-2 alphabet with a transmission speed of 50 baud and FSK modulation with 85 Hz shift.

===Radio navigation signals===

In parts of the world where there is no longwave broadcasting service, Non-directional beacons used for aeronavigation operate on 190–300 kHz (and beyond into the MW band). In Europe, Asia and Africa, the NDB allocation starts on 283.5 kHz.

The LORAN-C radio navigation system operated on 100 kHz.

In the past, the Decca Navigator System operated between 70 kHz and 129 kHz. The last Decca chains were closed down in 2000.

Differential GPS telemetry transmitters operate between 283.5 and 325 kHz.

The commercial &quot;Datatrak&quot; radio navigation system operates on a number of frequencies, varying by country, between 120–148 kHz.

===Other applications===
Some radio frequency identification (RFID) tags utilize LF. These tags are commonly known as LFIDs or LowFIDs (low frequency identification). The LF RFID tags are near-field devices, interacting with the inductive near field, rather than with radiated waves (radio waves) that are the only part of the electromagnetic field that persists into the far field. As such, they are technically &quot;not&quot; radio devices nor radio antennas, even though they do operate at radio frequencies, and are &quot;called&quot; &quot;antennas&quot; in the RFID trade, but not in radio engineering. It is more proper, and technically more informative to think of them as secondary coils of very loosely coupled transformers.

==Antennas==
Since the ground waves used in this band require vertical polarization, vertical antennas are used for transmission. Mast radiators are most common, either insulated from the ground and fed at the bottom, or occasionally fed through guy-wires. T-antennas and inverted L-antennas are used when antenna height is an issue.

LF transmitting antennas for high power transmitters require large amounts of space, and have been the cause of controversy in Europe and the United States, due to concerns about possible health hazards associated with human exposure to radio waves.

===Longwave receiving antennas===

Antenna requirements for LF reception are much more modest than for transmission. Although non-resonant long wire antennas are sometimes used, ferrite loop antennas are far more popular because of their small size.

Amateur radio operators have achieved good LF reception using active antennas: A short whip with a built-in pre-amplifier.

===Antenna heights===
Due to the long wavelengths in the band, nearly all LF antennas are electrically short, shorter than one quarter of the radiated wavelength, so their low radiation resistance makes them inefficient, requiring very low resistance grounds and conductors to avoid dissipating transmitter power.
These electrically short antennas need loading coils at the base of the antenna to bring them into resonance. Many antenna types, such as the umbrella antenna and L- and T-antenna, use capacitive top-loading (a &quot;top hat&quot;), in the form of a network of horizontal wires attached to the top of the vertical radiator. The capacitance improves the efficiency of the antenna by increasing the current, without increasing its height.

The height of antennas differ by usage. For some non-directional beacons (NDBs) the height can be as low as 10 meters, while for more powerful navigation transmitters such as DECCA, masts with a height around 100 meters are used. T-antennas have a height between 50–200 meters, while mast aerials are usually taller than 150 meters.

The height of mast antennas for LORAN-C is around 190 meters for transmitters with radiated power below 500 kW, and around 400 meters for transmitters greater than The main type of LORAN-C antenna is insulated from ground.

LF (longwave) broadcasting stations use mast antennas with heights of more than 150 meters or T-aerials. The mast antennas can be ground-fed insulated masts or upper-fed grounded masts. It is also possible to use cage antennas on grounded masts.

===Directional array antennas===
For broadcasting stations, directional antennas are often required. They consist of multiple masts, which often have the same height. Some longwave antennas consist of multiple mast antennas arranged in a circle with or without a mast antenna in the center. Such antennas focus the transmitted power toward ground and give a large zone of fade-free reception. This type of antenna is rarely used, because they are very expensive and require much space and because fading occurs on longwave much more rarely than in the medium wave range. One antenna of this kind was used by transmitter Orlunda in Sweden.

<text>Medium frequency (MF) is the ITU designation for radio frequencies (RF) in the range of 300 kilohertz (kHz) to 3 megahertz (MHz). Part of this band is the medium wave (MW) AM broadcast band. The MF band is also known as the hectometer band as the wavelengths range from ten to one hectometers (1000 to 100 m). Frequencies immediately below MF are denoted as low frequency (LF), while the first band of higher frequencies is known as high frequency (HF). MF is mostly used for AM radio broadcasting, navigational radio beacons, maritime ship-to-shore communication, and transoceanic air traffic control.

==Propagation==
Radio waves at MF wavelengths propagate via ground waves and reflection from the ionosphere (called skywaves). Ground waves travel just above the earth&#x27;s surface, following the terrain. At these wavelengths, they can bend (diffract) over hills, and travel beyond the visual horizon, although they may be blocked by mountain ranges. Ground waves are progressively absorbed by the Earth, so the signal strength decreases exponentially with distance from the transmitting antenna. Typical MF radio stations can cover a radius of several hundred kilometres/miles from the transmitter, with longer distances over water and damp earth. MF broadcasting stations use ground waves to cover their listening areas.

MF waves can also travel longer distances via skywave propagation, in which radio waves radiated at an angle into the sky are refracted back to Earth by layers of charged particles (ions) in the ionosphere, the E and F layers. However, at certain times the D layer (at a lower altitude than the refractive E and F layers) can be electronically noisy and absorb MF radio waves, interfering with skywave propagation. This happens when the ionosphere is heavily ionised, such as during the day, in summer and especially at times of high solar activity.

At night, especially in winter months and at times of low solar activity, the ionospheric D layer can virtually disappear. When this happens, MF radio waves can easily be received hundreds or even thousands of miles away as the signal will be refracted by the remaining F layer. This can be very useful for long-distance communication, but can also interfere with local stations. Because of the limited number of available channels in the MW broadcast band, the same frequencies are re-allocated to different broadcasting stations several hundred miles apart. On nights of good skywave propagation, the signals of distant stations may reflect off the ionosphere and interfere with the signals of local stations on the same frequency. The North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) sets aside certain channels for nighttime use over extended service areas via skywave by a few specially licensed AM broadcasting stations. These channels are called &quot;clear channels&quot;, and the stations, called &quot;clear-channel stations&quot;, are required to broadcast at higher powers of 10 to 50 kW.

==Uses and applications==
A major use of these frequencies is AM broadcasting; AM radio stations are allocated frequencies in the medium wave broadcast band from 526.5 kHz to 1606.5 kHz
in Europe; in North America this extends from 525 kHz to 1705 kHz Some countries also allow broadcasting in the 120-meter band from 2300 to 2495 kHz; these frequencies are mostly used in tropical areas. Although these are medium frequencies, 120 meters is generally treated as one of the shortwave bands.

There are a number of coast guard and other ship-to-shore frequencies in use between 1600 and 2850 kHz. These include, as examples, the French MRCC on 1696 kHz and 2677 kHz, Stornoway Coastguard on 1743 kHz, the US Coastguard on 2670 kHz and Madeira on 2843 kHz. RN Northwood in England broadcasts Weather Fax data on 2618.5 kHz. Non-directional navigational radio beacons (NDBs) for maritime and aircraft navigation occupy a band from 190 to 435 kHz, which overlaps from the LF into the bottom part of the MF band.

2182 kHz is the international calling and distress frequency for SSB maritime voice communication (radiotelephony). It is analogous to Channel 16 on the marine VHF band. 500 kHz was for many years the maritime distress and emergency frequency, and there are more NDBs between 510 and 530 kHz. Navtex, which is part of the current Global Maritime Distress Safety System occupies 518 kHz and 490 kHz for important digital text broadcasts. Lastly, there are aeronautical and other mobile SSB bands from 2850 kHz to 3500 kHz, crossing the boundary from the MF band into the HF radio band.

An amateur radio band known as 160 meters or &#x27;top-band&#x27; is between 1800 and 2000 kHz (allocation depends on country and starts at 1810 kHz outside the Americas). Amateur operators transmit CW morse code, digital signals and SSB and AM voice signals on this band. Following World Radiocommunication Conference 2012 (WRC-2012), the amateur service received a new allocation between 472 and 479 kHz for narrow band modes and secondary service, after extensive propagation and compatibility studies made by the ARRL 600 meters Experiment Group and their partners around the world. In recent years, some limited amateur radio operation has also been allowed in the region of 500 kHz in the US, UK, Germany and Sweden.

Many home-portable or cordless telephones, especially those that were designed in the 1980s, transmit low power FM audio signals between the table-top base unit and the handset on frequencies in the range 1600 to 1800 kHz.

==Antennas==


Transmitting antennas commonly used on this band include monopole mast radiators, top-loaded wire monopole antennas such as the inverted-L and T antennas, and wire dipole antennas. Ground wave propagation, the most widely used type at these frequencies, requires vertically polarized antennas like monopoles.

The most common transmitting antennas, monopoles of one-quarter to five-eighths wavelength, are physically large at these frequencies, requiring a tall radio mast. Usually the metal mast itself is energized and used as the antenna, and is mounted on a large porcelain insulator to isolate it from the ground; this is called a &quot;mast radiator&quot;. The monopole antenna, particularly if electrically short requires a good, low resistance Earth ground connection for efficiency since the ground resistance is in series with the antenna and consumes transmitter power. Commercial radio stations use a ground system consisting of many copper cables, buried shallowly in the earth, radiating from the base of the antenna to a distance of about a quarter wavelength. In areas of rocky or sandy soil where the ground conductivity is poor, above-ground counterpoises are sometimes used.

Lower power transmitters often use electrically short quarter wave monopoles such as inverted-L or T antennas, which are brought into resonance with a loading coil at their base.

Receiving antennas do not have to be as efficient as transmitting antennas since in this band the signal-to-noise ratio is determined by atmospheric noise. The noise floor in the receiver is far below the noise in the signal, so antennas small in comparison to the wavelength, which are inefficient and produce low signal strength, can be used. The weak signal from the antenna can be amplified in the receiver without introducing significant noise. The most common receiving antenna is the ferrite loopstick antenna (also known as a &quot;ferrite rod aerial&quot;), made from a ferrite rod with a coil of fine wire wound around it. This antenna is small enough that it is usually enclosed inside the radio case. In addition to their use in AM radios, ferrite antennas are also used in portable radio direction finder (RDF) receivers. The ferrite rod antenna has a dipole reception pattern with sharp nulls along the axis of the rod, so that reception is at its best when the rod is at right angles to the transmitter, but fades to nothing when the rod points exactly at the transmitter. Other types of loop antennas and random wire antennas are also used.

<doc id="160524" wikidata="Q1139372" url="?curid=160524" title="SINCGARS">
<text>Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) is a very high frequency combat network radio (CNR) used by U.S. and allied military forces. In the CNR network, the SINCGARS’ primary role is voice transmission between surface and airborne command and control (C2) assets.

The SINCGARS family replaced the Vietnam War-era synthesized single frequency radios (AN/PRC-77 and AN/VRC-12), although it can work with them. The airborne AN/ARC-201 radio is phasing out the older tactical air-to-ground radios (AN/ARC-114 and AN/ARC-131).

The SINCGARS is designed on a modular basis to achieve maximum commonality among various ground, maritime, and airborne configurations. A common receiver/transmitter (RT) is used in the ground configurations. The modular design also reduces the burden on the logistics system to provide repair parts.

The SINCGARS can operate in either the single-channel (SC) or frequency hopping (FH) mode, and stores both SC frequencies and FH loadsets. The system is compatible with all current U.S. and allied VHF-frequency modulation (FM) radios in the SC, nonsecure mode. The SINCGARS operates on any of 2320 channels between 30 and 88 megahertz (MHz) with a channel separation of 25 kilohertz (kHz). It accepts either digital or analog inputs and superimposes the signal onto a radio frequency (RF) carrier wave. In FH mode, the input changes frequency about 100 times per second over portions of the tactical VHF-FM range. These continual changes in frequency hinder threat interception and jamming units from locating or disrupting friendly communications. The SINCGARS provides data rates up to 16,000 bits per second. Enhanced data modes provide packet and RS-232 data. The enhanced data modes available with the System Improvement Program (SIP) and Advanced System Improvement Program (ASIP) radios also enable forward error correction (FEC), and increased speed, range, and accuracy of data transmissions.

Most ground SINCGARS have the capability to control output power; however, most airborne SINCGARS are fixed power. Those RTs with power settings can vary transmission range from approximately 200 meters (660 feet) to 10 kilometers (km) (6.2 miles). Adding a power amplifier increases the line of sight (LOS) range to approximately 40 km (25 miles). (These ranges are for planning purposes only; terrain, weather, and antenna height can affect transmission range.) The variable output power level allows users to operate on the minimum power necessary to maintain reliable communications, thus lessening the electromagnetic signature given off by their radio sets. This capability is of particular importance at major command posts, which operate in multiple networks. 
SC CNR users outside the FH network can use a hailing method to request access to the network. When hailing a network, a user outside the network contacts the network control station (NCS) on the cue frequency. In the active FH mode, the SINCGARS gives audible and visual signals to the operator that an external subscriber wants to communicate with the FH network. The SINCGARS operator must change to the cue frequency to communicate with the outside radio system. The network can be set to a manual frequency for initial network activation. The manual frequency provides a common frequency for all members of the network to verify that the equipment is operational. During initial net activation, all operators in the net tune to the manual frequency. After communications are established, the net switches to the FH mode and the NCS transfers the hopping variables to the outstations.

More than 570,000 radios have been purchased. There have been several system improvement programs, including the Integrated Communications Security (ICOM) models, which have provided integrated voice and data encryption, the Special Improvement Program (SIP) models, which add additional data modes, and the advanced SIP (ASIP) models, which are less than half the size and weight of ICOM and SIP models and provided enhanced FEC (forward error correction) data modes, RS-232 asynchronous data, packet data formats, and direct interfacing to Precision Lightweight GPS Receiver (PLGR) devices providing radio level situational awareness capability.

In 1992, the U.S. Air Force awarded a contract to replace the AN/ARC-188 for communications between Air Force aircraft and Army units.

<text>Auguste-Maurice Barrès (; 19 August 1862 – 4 December 1923) was a French novelist, journalist, philosopher, and politician. Spending some time in Italy, he became a figure in French literature with the release of his work &quot;The Cult of the Self&quot; in 1888. He was elected a member of the Académie Française in 1906.

In politics, Barrès was first elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1889 as a Boulangist and would play a prominent political role for the rest of his life. He presided over the Ligue des Patriotes from 1914 until his death in 1923.

== Biography ==
Barrès was associated in his literary works with Symbolism, a movement which had equivalence with British Aestheticism and Italian Decadentism; indeed he was a close associate of Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio representing the latter. As the name of his trilogy suggests, his works glorified a humanistic love of the self and he also flirted with occult mysticisms in his youth. The Dreyfus affair saw an ideological shift from a liberal individualism rooted in the French Revolution to a more organic and traditional concept of the nation. He also became a leading anti-Dreyfusard popularising the term &quot;nationalisme&quot; to describe his views. He stood on a platform of &quot;Nationalism and Protectionism.&quot;.

Politically, he became involved with various groups such as the &quot;Ligue des Patriotes&quot; of Paul Déroulède, of which he became the leader in 1914. Barrès was close to Charles Maurras, founder of the monarchist party &quot;Action Française&quot;. Though he remained a republican, Barrès developed a strong influence on various French monarchists of his day, as well as various other figures. During the First World War, he championed the Union Sacrée political truce. In later life, Barrès returned to the Catholic faith: he was involved in a campaign to restore French church buildings and helped establish 24 June as a national day of remembrance for St. Joan of Arc.

===Early years===
Born at Charmes, Vosges, he received his secondary education at the &quot;lycée&quot; of Nancy, attending there the lessons of Auguste Burdeau, later pictured as social climber Paul Bouteiller in &quot;Les Déracinés&quot;. In 1883 continued his legal studies in Paris. Establishing himself at first in the , he became acquainted with Leconte de Lisle&#x27;s cenacle and with the symbolists in the 1880s, even meeting Victor Hugo once. He had already started contributing to the monthly periodical, &quot;Jeune France&quot; (&quot;Young France&quot;), and he now issued a periodical of his own, &quot;Les Taches d&#x27;encre&quot;, which survived for only a few months. After four years of journalism he settled in Italy, where he wrote &quot;Sous l&#x27;œil des barbares&quot; (1888), the first volume of a &quot;trilogie du moi&quot; (also called &quot;Le Culte du moi&quot; or &quot;The Cult of the Self&quot;), completed by &quot;Un Homme libre&quot; (1889), and &quot;Le Jardin de Bérénice&quot; (1891). &quot;The Cult of the Self&quot; trilogy was influenced by Romanticism, and also made an apology of the pleasure of the senses.

He supplemented these apologies for his narcissism with &quot;L&#x27;Ennemi des lois&quot; (1892), and with an admirable volume of impressions of travel, &quot;Du sang, de la volupté, de la mort&quot; (1893). Barrès wrote his early books in an elaborate and often very obscure style.

The Comédie Française produced his play &quot;Une Journée parlementaire&quot; in 1894. A year after establishing himself in Neuilly, he began his trilogy in 1897, &quot;Le Roman de l&#x27;énergie nationale&quot; (&quot;Novel of the National Energy&quot;), with the publication of &quot;Les Déracinés&quot;. In this second major trilogy, he superated his early individualism with a patriotic fidelity to the fatherland and an organicist conception of the nation (&quot;see below for details&quot;). Affected by the Dreyfus Affair, and finding himself on the side of the Anti-Dreyfusards, Barrès played a leading role alongside Charles Maurras, which initiated his shift to the political right; Barrès oriented himself towards a lyrical form of nationalism, founded on the cult of the earth and the dead (&quot;la terre et les morts&quot;, &quot;earth and the dead&quot; — &quot;see below for details&quot;).

The &quot;Roman de l&#x27;énergie nationale&quot; trilogy makes a plea for local patriotism, militarism, the faith to one&#x27;s roots and to one&#x27;s family, and for the preservation of the distinctive qualities of the old French provinces. &quot;Les Déracinés&quot; narrates the adventures of seven young Lorrainers who set out to conquer fortune in Paris. Six of them survive in the second novel of the trilogy, &quot;L&#x27;Appel au soldat&quot; (1900), which gives the history of Boulangism; the sequel, &quot;Leurs figures&quot; (1902), deals with the Panama scandals. Later works include:
*&quot;Scènes et doctrines du nationalisme &quot;(1902)
*&quot;Les Amitiés françaises&quot; (1903), in which he urges the inculcation of patriotism by the early study of national history
*&quot;Ce que j&#x27;ai vu à Rennes&quot; (1904)
*&quot;Au service de l&#x27;Allemagne&quot; (1905), the experiences of an Alsatian conscript in a German regiment
*&quot;Le Voyage de Sparte&quot; (1906).

He presented himself in 1905 to the Académie française, but was supplanted by Etienne Lamy. He then tried again, but inclined himself before the candidacy of the former Minister Alexandre Ribot. But he was finally elected the next year, gaining 25 voices against 8 to Edmond Hauraucourt and one to Jean Aicart on 25 January 1906.

Barrès was also a friend since his youth of the occultist Stanislas de Guaita, and was attracted by Asia, sufism and shi&#x27;ism. But he returned in his later years to the Catholic faith, engaging in &quot;L&#x27;Echo de Paris&quot; a campaign in favour of the restoration of the churches of France. His son Philippe Barrès followed him in a journalism career.

===Political activism===

As a young man, Barrès carried his Romantic and individualist theory of the Ego into politics as an ardent partisan of General Boulanger, locating himself in the more populist side of the heterogenous Boulangist coalition. He directed a Boulangist paper at Nancy, and was elected deputy in 1889, at the age of 27, under a platform of &quot;Nationalism, Protectionism, and Socialism&quot;, retaining his seat in the legislature until 1893, when he was defeated under the etiquette of &quot;National Republican and Socialist&quot; (&quot;Républicain nationaliste et socialiste&quot;). From 1889, Barrès&#x27; activism overshadowed his literary activities, although he tried to maintain both.

He shifted however to the right-wing during the Dreyfus Affair, becoming a leading mouthpiece, alongside Charles Maurras, of the Anti-Dreyfusard side. The Socialist leader Léon Blum tried to convince him to join the Dreyfusards, but Barrès refused and wrote several anti-Semitic pamphlets. He wrote, &quot;That Dreyfus is guilty, I deduce not from the facts themselves, but from his race.&quot; Barrès&#x27; anti-Jewishness found its roots both in the scientific racial contemporary theories and on Biblical exegesis.

He founded the short-lived review &quot;La Cocarde&quot; (&quot;The Cockade&quot;) in 1894 (September 1894 – March 1895) to defend his ideas, attempting to bridge the gap between the far-left and the far-right. The &quot;Cocarde&quot;, nationalist, anti-parliamentarist and anti-foreign, included a diverse collection of contributors from a wide variety of backgrounds (monarchists, socialists, anarchists, Jews, Protestants), including Frédéric Amouretti, Charles Maurras, René Boylesve and Fernand Pelloutier.

He was again beaten during the 1896 elections in Neuilly, as a candidate of the Socialist leader Jean Jaurès, and then again in 1897 as a nationalist anti-Semitic candidate, having broken with the left-wing during the Dreyfus Affair.

Barrès then assumed the leadership of the Ligue de la Patrie française (League of the French Fatherland), before taking membership in the &quot;Ligue des Patriotes&quot; (Patriot League) of Paul Déroulède. In 1914, he became the leader of the Patriot League.

Close to the nationalist writer Charles Maurras, founder of the monarchist Action française movement, Barrès refused however to endorse monarchist ideas, although he demonstrated sympathy throughout his life for the Action française. Most of the later monarchist theorists (Jacques Bainville, Henri Vaugeois, Léon Daudet, Henri Massis, Jacques Maritain, Georges Bernanos, Thierry Maulnier...) have recognised their debt toward Barrès, who also inspired several generations of writers (among which Montherlant, Malraux, Mauriac and Aragon).

Barrès was elected deputy of the Seine in 1906, and retained his seat until his death. He sat at that time among the Entente républicaine démocratique conservative party. In 1908, he opposed in Parliament his friend and political opponent Jean Jaurès, refusing the Socialist leader&#x27;s will to Pantheonize the writer Émile Zola. Despite his political views, he was one of the first to show his respect to Jaurès&#x27; remains after his assassination on the eve of World War I.

During World War I, Barrès was one of the proponents of the Union Sacrée, which earned him the nickname &quot;nightingale of bloodshed&quot; (&quot;rossignol des carnages&quot;). The &quot;Canard enchaîné&quot; satirical newspaper called him the &quot;chief of the tribe of brainwashers&quot; (&quot;chef de la tribu des bourreurs de crâne&quot;). His personal notes showed however that he himself did not always believe in his purported war optimism, being at times close to defeatism. During the war Barrès also partly came back on the mistakes of his youth, by paying tribute to French Jews in &quot;Les familles spirituelles de la France&quot;, where he placed them as one of the four elements of the &quot;national genius&quot;, alongside Traditionalists, Protestants and Socialists – thus opposing himself to Maurras who saw in them the &quot;four confederate states&quot; of &quot;Anti-France&quot;.

After World War I, Barrès demanded the annexation of Luxembourg into the French Republic, and also sought to increase French influence in the Rhineland. On 24 June 1920, the National Assembly adopted his draft aiming to establish a national day in remembrance of Joan of Arc.

===Nationalism===

Barrès is considered, alongside Charles Maurras, as one of the main thinkers of ethnic nationalism at the turn of the century in France, associated with Revanchism — the desire to reconquer the Alsace-Lorraine, annexed by the newly created German Empire at the end of the 1871 Franco-Prussian War (Barrès was aged 8 at that time). In fact, he himself popularised the word &quot;nationalism&quot; in French.

This has been noted by Zeev Sternhell, Michel Winock (who titled the first part of his book, &quot;Le Siècle des intellectuels&quot;, &quot;Les Années Barrès&quot; (&quot;The Barrès&#x27; Years&quot;), followed by &quot;Les Années André Gide&quot; and &quot;Les Années Jean-Paul Sartre&quot;), Pierre-André Taguieff, etc. He shared as common points with Paul Bourget his disdain for utilitarianism and liberalism.

Opposed to Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s theory of social contract, Barrès considered the &#x27;Nation&#x27; (which he used to replace the &#x27;People&#x27;) as already historically founded: it did not need a &quot;general will&quot; to establish itself, thus also contrasting with Ernest Renan&#x27;s definition of the Nation. Much closer to Herder and Fichte than to Renan in his definition of the Nation, Barrès opposed French centralism (as did Maurras), as he considered the Nation to be a multiplicity of local allegiances, first to the family, the village, the region, and ultimately to the nation-state. Influenced by Edmund Burke, Frédéric Le Play and Hippolyte Taine, he developed an organicist conception of the Nation which contrasted with the universalism of the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. According to Barrès, the People is not founded by an act of autonomy, but find its origins in the earth (le sol), history (institutions, life and material conditions) and traditions and inheritance (&quot;the dead&quot;). His early individualism was quickly superseded by an organicist theory of the social link, in which &quot;the individual is nothing, society is everything&quot;.

Barrès feared miscegenation of modern times, represented by Paris, claiming against Michelet that it jeopardised the unity of the Nation. The Nation was to be balanced between various local nationalities (he spoke of the &quot;Lorraine nationality&quot; as much as of the &quot;French nationality&quot;) through decentralisation and the call for a leader, giving a Bonapartist aspect to his thought which explained his attraction for the General Boulanger and his opposition to liberal democracy. He pleaded for a direct democracy and personalisation of power, as well as for the implementation of popular referendums as done in Switzerland. In this nationalist frame, anti-Semitism was to be the cohesive factor for a right-wing mass movement.

Contrary to popular belief, Maurice Barrès never used the term “le grand remplacement” [great replacement], either in his novel &quot;L&#x27;appel au soldat&quot; or anywhere else. However he did make use of the underlying concept, namely that the French national character was being harmed by immigration of certain ethnic groups.

=== Hispanophilia ===
Barrès was a noted hispanophile. Influenced by the romantic mythification of Spain, he described the country as &quot;an Africa leaving your soul with a sort of furor so fast as chilli does in your mouth&quot;. Always passionate about the &quot;South&quot; and &quot;Orient&quot;, he emphasized in his work the period of Moorish domination. He interpreted the Spain of the time as a nation refractory to the attempts of economic and bureaucratic rationalization threatening his own country. He visited Spain in 1892, 1893 and 1902, capturing his vision of the country in his writings, taking a particular interest in Toledo.

===Dada and Barrès===
The Dadaists organised in spring 1921 the trial of Barrès, charged with an &quot;attack on the safety of the mind&quot; (&quot;attentat à la sûreté de l&#x27;esprit&quot;) and sentenced him to 20 years of forced labour. This fictitious trial also marked the dissolution of Dada - its founders, among whom was Tristan Tzara, refusing any form of justice even if organised by Dada.

===Final years and death===

An Orientalist romance, &quot;Un jardin sur l&#x27;Oronte&quot; (A Garden on the Orontes)—which would be the basis of an opera of the same name—was published in 1922, triggering what would be called (the Orontes Quarrel).
Barrès died in Neuilly-sur-Seine on 4 December 1923.

<text>The Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) is an IBM PC graphics adapter and &quot;de facto&quot; computer display standard from 1984 that superseded the CGA standard introduced with the original IBM PC, and was itself superseded by the VGA standard in 1987. In addition to the original EGA card manufactured by IBM, many compatible third-party cards were manufactured, and EGA graphics modes continued to be supported by VGA and later standards.

== History ==
EGA was introduced in October 1984 by IBM, shortly after its new PC/AT. The EGA could be installed in previously released IBM PCs, but required a ROM upgrade on the mainboard.

Chips and Technologies&#x27; first product, announced in September 1985, was a four-chip EGA chipset that handled the functions of 19 of IBM&#x27;s proprietary chips on the original Enhanced Graphics Adapter. By that November&#x27;s COMDEX, more than a half dozen companies had announced EGA-compatible boards based on C&amp;T&#x27;s chipset. The first EGA-compatible board was Vega in December 1985, released by Video Seven and using C&amp;T&#x27;s chipset. The Vega was half the width of the original IBM EGA board.

Between 1984 and 1987, several third-party manufacturers produced compatible cards, such as the &quot;Autoswitch EGA&quot; or Genoa Systems&#x27; &quot;Super EGA&quot; chipset. Later cards supporting an extended version of the VGA were similarly named Super VGA.

The EGA standard was made obsolete in 1987 by the introduction of MCGA and VGA with the PS/2 computer line.

== Adoption ==
By 1985 &quot;InfoWorld&quot; described EGA as the &quot;next graphics standard&quot;, but with &quot;sluggish sales&quot; because of high cost and lack of software support. The magazine said that &quot;market reaction ... although positive, has not been overwhelming, in part because the EGA&#x27;s complexity has slowed software vendors&#x27; efforts to support it&quot;. Commercial software began supporting EGA soon after its introduction, with &quot;The Ancient Art of War,&quot; released in 1984. &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator v2.12,&quot; &quot;Jet&quot;, &quot;Silent Service&quot;, and &quot;Cyrus&quot;, all released in 1985, offered EGA support, along with Windows 1.0. Sierra&#x27;s &quot;King&#x27;s Quest III&quot;, released in 1986, was one of the earliest mainstream PC games to use it.

The first clone boards appeared in late 1985, lowering EGA&#x27;s cost. By 1987, EGA support was commonplace. Most software made up to 1991 could run in EGA, although the vast majority of commercial games used with 16 colors for backward compatibility with CGA and Tandy, and to support users who did not own an enhanced EGA monitor. 350-line modes were mostly used by freeware/shareware games and application software, although &quot;SimCity&quot; is a notable example of a commercial game that runs in with 16 colors mode. Modern adventure games, like &quot;The Crimson Diamond&quot;, use freeware tools like the Adventure Game Studio to create games with EGA-style color palettes but with modern features.

== Hardware design ==

The original IBM EGA was an 8-bit PC ISA card with 64 KB of onboard RAM. An optional daughter-board (the &quot;Graphics Memory Expansion Card&quot;) provided a minimum of 64 KB additional RAM, and up to 192 KB if fully populated with the &quot;Graphics Memory Module Kit&quot;. Without these upgrades, the card would be limited to four colors in 640 × 350 mode.

Output was via direct-drive RGB, as with the CGA, but no composite video output was included. MDA and CGA monitors could be driven, as well as newly released enhanced color monitors for use specifically with EGA.

EGA-specific monitors used a dual-sync design which could switch from the 15.7 kHz of 200-line modes to 21.8 kHz for 350-line modes.

Many EGA cards have DIP switches on the back of the card to select the monitor type. If CGA is selected, the card will operate in 200-line mode and use 8×8 characters in text mode. If EGA is selected, the card will operate in 350-line mode and use 8×14 text.

Some third-party cards using the EGA specification were sold with the full 128 KB of RAM from the factory, while others included as much as 256 KB to enable multiple graphics pages, multiple text-mode character sets, and large scrolling displays. A few third-party cards, such as the ATI Technologies EGA Wonder, built on the EGA standard to additionally offer features such as extended graphics modes as high as and automatic monitor type detection.

== Capabilities ==


EGA produces a display of up to 16 colors (using a fixed palette, or one selected from a gamut of 64 colors (6-bit RGB), depending on mode) at several resolutions up to 640 × 350 pixels, as well as two monochrome modes at higher resolutions. EGA cards include a ROM to extend the system BIOS for additional graphics functions, and a custom CRT controller (CRTC).

The IBM EGA CRTC supports all of the modes of the IBM MDA and CGA adapters through specific mode options, but it is not fully register-compatible with the Motorola MC6845 used in those cards, so software that directly programs the registers to select modes may produce different results on the EGA.

Supported resolutions are 320 × 200 and 640 × 200 (on a CGA or EGA monitor), 720 × 350 and 640 × 350 (on an MDA monitor) and 320 × 350 and 640 × 350 (on an EGA monitor). EGA scans at 21.8 kHz when 350-line modes are used and 15.7 kHz when 200-line modes are used.

In the 640 × 350 high-resolution mode, which requires an enhanced EGA monitor, 16 colors can be selected from a palette comprising all combinations of two bits per pixel for red, green and blue. This is four levels of intensity for each primary color and 64 colors overall. On EGA adapters with only 64KB of video RAM only 4 colors can be selected per pixel. The 640 × 200 and 320 × 200 graphics modes provide backward compatibility with CGA software and monitors, but they can use the entire sixteen-color CGA palette simultaneously, instead of the smaller four-color palettes that the actual CGA is limited to in those modes.

EGA&#x27;s 16-color graphic modes use bit planes and mask registers together with CPU bitwise operations for accelerated graphics. The same techniques went on to be used in the VGA.

=== Modes ===
EGA supports:
*  × 16 colors (from a 6 bit palette of 64 colors), pixel aspect ratio of 1:1.37.
*  × 2 colors, pixel aspect ratio of 1:1.37.
*  × 16 colors, pixel aspect ratio of 1:2.4.
*  × 16 colors, pixel aspect ratio of 1:1.2.

Text modes:
* with pixel font (effective resolution of )
* with pixel font (effective resolution of )
* with pixel font (effective resolution of )
* with pixel font (effective resolution of )

Extended graphics modes of third-party boards:
*

=== Color palette ===
With the EGA, all 16 CGA colors can be used simultaneously, and each can be mapped in from a larger palette of 64 colors (two bits each for red, green and blue). The CGA&#x27;s alternate brown color is included in the larger palette, so it can be used without any additional display hardware. The later VGA standard built on this by mapping each of the 64 colors in from a larger, customizable, palette of 256.

Standard EGA monitors do not support use of the extended color palette in 200-line modes, because the monitor cannot distinguish between being connected to a CGA card or being connected to an EGA card outputting a 200-line mode. EGA redefines some pins of the connector to carry the extended color information. If the monitor were connected to a CGA card, these pins would not carry valid color information, and the screen might be garbled if the monitor were to interpret them as such. For this reason, standard EGA monitors will use the CGA pin assignment in 200-line modes, so the monitor can also be used with a CGA card.

Some EGA monitors are &quot;switchable&quot;, meaning that they can be set up to use the full palette even in 200-line modes, often through a mechanical switch. Only a few commercial games were released with support for the extended color palette in or (including the DOS version of &quot;Super Off Road&quot;).

When selecting a color from the EGA palette, two bits are used for the red, green and blue channels to signal values of 0, 1, 2 or 3. For instance, to select the color magenta, the red and blue values would be medium intensity (2, or 10 in binary) and the green value would be off (0).

The table below displays an example palette matching the standard 16 CGA colors, with their representations in rgbRGB binary (internal card bit order), where the lowercase letters are the low-intensity bits, and uppercase letters are high-intensity bits. Decimal and hexadecimal values (converted to equivalent 24-bit sRGB web colors) are also shown.


The following images illustrate the full EGA palette in detail.


=== Specifications ===

EGA uses a female nine-pin D-subminiature (DE-9) connector for output, identical to the CGA connector. The signal standard and pinout is backward-compatible with CGA, allowing EGA monitors to be used on CGA cards and conversely.

When operating in EGA modes, pins 2, 6 and 7 are repurposed for EGA&#x27;s secondary RGB signals (see pinout table below). When operating in 200-line CGA modes, the EGA card is fully backward compatible with a standard IBM CGA monitor; however, third-party monitors had varying compatibility.

Third-party monitors sometimes connected pin two to ground internally. When connected to an EGA card, this shorts the EGA&#x27;s secondary red output to ground and can damage the card. Also, some monitors were wired with pin two as their sole ground, and these will not work with the EGA.

Conversely, an EGA monitor should work with a CGA adapter, but if it is not set to CGA mode, the secondary red signal will be grounded (always zero), and the secondary blue will be floating (unconnected), causing all high-intensity colors except brown to display incorrectly, and all colors to potentially have a variable blue tint due to the indeterminate state of the unconnected secondary blue.

The IBM 5154 EGA monitor has a special IBM 5153 CGA compatibility mode when operating with CGA sync signals and automatically changes to the CGA pinout to avoid all of the mentioned problems when operating in this mode.

The original IBM EGA card includes a feature connector (blue connector J4, see first photo on this page), providing access to two RCA connectors at the back of card, in addition to several analog and digital signals that the EGA adaptor can be configured to use. 

A light pen interface was also present on the original card. 

=== Memory mapping ===
For color text and CGA graphics modes, video memory is mapped to 16 KB of addresses beginning at address B8000h, and in monochrome (MDA-compatible) text mode, video memory occupies 16 KB beginning at B0000h. These address mappings are for backward compatibility.

For modes new to the EGA, the video memory begins at address A0000h and occupies 64 KB. The different base addresses for color vs. monochrome modes makes it possible for an EGA to be used simultaneously with a monochrome graphics card in the same computer, or for an EGA in MDA text mode to be used simultaneously with a CGA in the same computer.

EGA&#x27;s native graphics modes are planar, as opposed to the interleaved CGA and Hercules modes. Video memory is divided into four &quot;planes&quot; (except  × 2, which has one plane), one for each component of the RGBI color space. Each pixel is represented by one bit in each plane. If a bit in the red plane is on, but none of the equivalent bits in the other pages are, a red pixel will appear in that location on screen. If all the other bits for that particular pixel were also on, it would become white, and so forth.

Planes are different sizes depending on the mode:

All planes reside at segment A000 in the CPU&#x27;s address space. They are bank-switched, and only one plane can be read on the CPU bus at once; however, the programmer may set the control registers on the card to select which planes are written to and write to several at once. An exception is read mode 1, in which all four planes are read and compared with programmed &quot;Color Compare&quot; data, and a byte indicating the result of comparing all four planes can be read on the I/O bus.

<doc id="160530" wikidata="Q6696081" url="?curid=160530" title="Lucas Barrett">
<text>Lucas Barrett (14 November 1837 – 19 December 1862) was an English naturalist and geologist. He was the director of the Jamaican Geological Survey from 1859 to 1862. He was a young member of the Geological Society and became England&#x27;s Government Geological Inspector to the West Indies.

His untimely death was caused by drowning while investigating a sea-bottom near Kingston, Jamaica.

== Early life and education ==
Barrett was born in London on November 14, 1837, the firstborn son of an unidentified mother and George Barrett, an iron founder who designed iron work for the London Kings Cross Railway Station. He completed his preliminary education in Royston, Hertfordshire.

On March 8, 1859, Alice Maria Barrett married Lucas Barrett at Church of St Mary the Great, Cambridge. Sources do not indicate Alice Maria Barrett&#x27;s career nor the story of their meeting. Alice Maria Barrett&#x27;s parents were Maria Reed and Robert Barrett. The marriage was recorded in the Cambridge section of the &quot;Bury and Norwich Post&quot; on March 15, 1859.

Barrett was educated at University College School.

In 1853, he went to Ebersdorf, near Lobenstein, Vogtland, Germany to study botany and chemistry for a year. 

== Geology career ==
On May 2, 1855, at the age of 18, Barrett became a member of the Geological Society.

In 1855, he accompanied Robert MacAndrew on a dredging excursion from the Shetland Islands to Norway, Finland, and beyond the Arctic Circle. He subsequently made other cruises, to Greenland and to the coast of Spain. These expeditions laid the foundations of an extensive knowledge of the distribution of marine life.

Circa 1858 in Norway, Barrett and R. MacAndrew discovered &quot;Geodia barretti&quot;, a massive deep-sea sponge, on the coast of Norway. British naturalist James Scott Bowerbank named it &quot;Geodia barretti&quot; to honor Barrett.

In 1855, he was engaged by Adam Sedgwick to assist in the Woodwardian Museum at Cambridge. During the following three years, he aided the professor by delivering lectures. He discovered bones of birds in the Cambridge Greensand, and he prepared a geological map of Cambridge on the one-inch Ordnance map. In 1859, when he was twenty-two, he was appointed director of the Geological Survey of Jamaica. There, he determined the Cretaceous age of certain rocks that contained &quot;Hippurites&quot;. S. P. Woodward named the new genus &quot;Barrettia&quot; after him. Barrett also collected many fossils from the Miocene and newer strata.

=== West Indian Geological Survey ===
In 1857, the Colonial Office in London set up the West Indian Geological Survey, a geology research team. The first area of interest was the island of Trinidad. The Director of the group was George Parks Wall, assisted by James Gay Sawkins, an American working as a copper miner in Jamaica.

In 1859, Wall resigned following the completion of the Trinidad research. British geologist Roderick Murchison was displeased with the results of the Trinidad survey and refused to nominate the next director. As a result, Colonial Office administrator Henry Ernest Gascoyne Bulwer approached Professor John Phillips at Oxford for a recommendation. Phillips recommended Barrett, who became leader.

On April 1, 1859, James G. Sawkins and his wife Octavia &quot;Rosa&quot; Sawkins arrived at St. Thomas, Jamaica via a mail steamer; they had sailed from the Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. Sawkins brought scientific instruments used in his geological survey of Trinidad. The Barrett couple and Sawkins couple met for the first time. During this meeting, Mr. Sawkins learned that the pay he would receive would be insufficient for his means. Upon arriving in Kingston, Jamaica on April 5, Sawkins arranged a meeting with John Peter Grant, then colonial governor of Jamaica. After Barrett wrote a persuasive letter to statesman Edward Bulwer-Lytton asking to increase Sawkins&#x27;s pay so he would not resign, Sawkins&#x27;s pay was increased and he remained on the project.

== Death and legacy ==

Barrett drowned, at the age of twenty-five, while investigating the sea-bottom of Port Royal near Kingston, Jamaica, as part of the Jamaican Geological Survey. Geologist Simon F. Mitchell describes:[Barrett] carried back to Jamaica a diving-apparatus to enable him personally to explore the reefs. Having once gone down safely and successfully in shallow water, he would not wait for the assistance of his friends; and set out on the 19th of December, attended by a crew and servants, to the coral-reefs outside Port Royal. At some distance from the land he descended into deep water, provided with 100 feet of air-tubing, and holding the &quot;life-line&quot; only in his hand; and after the lapse of more than half an hour he floated to the surface, but no longer alive.After his death, American mining engineer James G. Sawkins took over Barrett&#x27;s position as leader of the team.

Barrett was buried at St. Andrew Parish Church.

His posthumous son Arthur Barrett and grandson Lucas Barrett were electrical engineers and ran the firm of Baily, Grundy and Barrett in Cambridge.

In 1962, on the centennial of his death, a plaque monument was dedicated to Barrett. It was replaced by a new plaque in 2005.

<text>Wilson Barrett (born William Henry Barrett; 18 February 1846 – 22 July 1904) was an English manager, actor, and playwright. With his company, Barrett is credited with attracting the largest crowds of English theatregoers ever because of his success with melodrama, an instance being his production of &quot;The Silver King&quot; (1882) at the Princess&#x27;s Theatre of London. The historical tragedy &quot;The Sign of the Cross&quot; (1895) was Barrett&#x27;s most successful play, both in England and in the United States.

==Biography==

===1880s===
Barrett was born into a farming family in Essex. He is remembered as an actor of handsome appearance (despite his small stature) and with a powerful voice. He made his first appearance on the stage at Halifax in 1864, and then played in the provinces alone and with his wife, Caroline Heath, in &quot;East Lynne&quot;. They married in 1866, having two sons, Frank and Alfred, and three daughters, Ellen, Katherine and Dorothea (Dollie).

Barrett capitalized on his early success as an actor to start a career as a producer. After managerial experience at the Grand Theatre Leeds and elsewhere, in 1879 he took over the management of the Old Court theatre, where in the following year he introduced Madame Helena Modjeska to London in an adaptation of &quot;Maria Stuart&quot; (by Schiller), together with productions of &quot;Adrienne Lecouvreur&quot;, &quot;La Dame aux camélias&quot; and other plays.

In 1881, Wilson Barrett took over the recently refurbished Princess&#x27;s Theatre, where his melodramatic productions enjoyed great success (if not quite as much as before), with attendance being the highest ever for this theatre. There Barrett presented &quot;The Lights o&#x27; London&quot;, and then &quot;The Silver King&quot;, regarded as the most successful melodrama of the 19th century in England. It debuted on 16 November 1882, with Barrett as Wilfred Denver. He played this part for three hundred nights without a break, and repeated its success in W. G. Wills&#x27;s &quot;Claudian&quot;.

In 1885 he and Henry Arthur Jones produced &quot;Hoodman Blind&quot; and in 1886 co-operated with Clement Scott in &quot;Sister Mary&quot;. In 1886 Barrett left the Princess&#x27;s Theatre, and in this same year he made a visit to America, repeated in later years.

In 1884 Barrett had appeared in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, only to promptly return to melodrama. He was not to find much success in any Shakespearian role, apart from Mercutio in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

Though Barrett had occasional seasons in London he acted chiefly in the provinces, with his company being one of the most successful of the decade, receiving a £2,000 average yearly profit just from the Grand Theatre Leeds. His brother and his nephew were part of the company, and his grandson would join them eventually.

Barrett was the producer of the performance of &quot;The Romany Rye&quot; which on its opening night turned into the Exeter Theatre Royal fire, which was the deadliest theatre incident in UK history, killing 186 people.

According to Jacob Adler, Wilson Barrett was the most famous actor on the London stage of the 1880s.

===1890s: &quot;The Sign of the Cross&quot;===

By the 1890s, the London stage was already coming under new influences, and Wilson Barrett&#x27;s vogue in melodrama had waned, leaving him in financial difficulties. From 1894 he toured the United States, including the &quot;American&quot; and &quot;Knickerbocker&quot; theatres of Broadway.

Still there in 1895, Barrett found fortune again with a production which would effectively become his most successful, the historical tragedy &quot;The Sign of the Cross&quot;—which was originally produced in the United States at the Grand Opera House, St. Louis, Missouri on 28 March 1895; in the United Kingdom, at the Grand Theatre, Leeds, on 26 August 1895; in London, at the Lyric Theatre, London on 4 January 1896; and in Australia, at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Sydney on 8 May 1897—in which Barrett played Marcus Superbus, an old Roman patrician of the years of Nero, who falls in love with a young woman, Mercia (originally played by Maud Jeffries) and converts to Christianity for her, both sacrificing their lives in the arena to the lions. The plot in some ways strongly resembles the contemporary novel &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, and it may have been an unofficial adaptation of it, though Barrett never acknowledged this.

The theatre was crowded with audiences largely composed of people outside the ordinary circle of playgoers, shepherded by enthusiastic local clergymen. Barrett tried to repeat this success with more plays of a religious type, though not with equal effect, and several of his later attempts were failures.

At the turn of the century he co-founded the company which became Waddingtons, originally as a theatre-focused printing firm.

===Death===
Wilson Barrett died in a nursing home in London on 22 July 1904. Thanks largely to the success of the &quot;Sign of the Cross&quot;, he left £57,000, even after periods of relative failure, mainly during his later years managing the Old Court Theatre. His grandson, also named Wilson Barrett, became an actor director with the Brandon-Thomas Company before starting his own repertory in 1939, the Wilson Barrett Company, which based itself in Edinburgh&#x27;s Lyceum, Glasgow at the Alhambra Theatre Glasgow and for a time in Aberdeen. It also performed on television, at the Edinburgh International Festival and, by invitation, in South Africa. The company was retired in 1954.

=== Archives ===
Barrett&#x27;s descendants placed the majority of Wilson Barrett&#x27;s papers at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. Over thirty boxes of materials include manuscript works by Barrett, business and personal correspondence, extensive financial records and legal agreements, as well as photographs, playbills and programs relating to Barrett&#x27;s productions, and Barrett and Heath family papers. Additional Wilson Barrett materials at the Ransom Center include letters by Barrett located in the literary manuscript collections of Richard Le Gallienne, John Ruskin, William Winter, and Robert Lee Wolff. The B. J. Simmons Co. costume design records include the company&#x27;s renderings for &quot;The Sign of the Cross&quot;. A marked script of Barrett&#x27;s &quot;The Manxman&quot; can be found in the Playscripts and Promptbooks Collection.

The British Library, the Folger Shakespeare Library, and the University of Leeds Special Collections Library each have a substantial number of letters by Wilson Barrett. The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum Theatre and Performance Archives holds designs by Edward William Godwin for Barrett&#x27;s productions of &quot;Juana&quot;, &quot;Claudian&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Junius&quot;, and &quot;Clito&quot;. The papers of Wilson Barrett the younger (1900-1981), a grandson of Wilson Barrett who was also an actor-manager and toured with his own Wilson Barrett Company, are located in the Scottish Theatre Archive at the University of Glasgow.

<doc id="160538" wikidata="Q179488" url="?curid=160538" title="Psycholinguistics">
<text>Psycholinguistics or psychology of language is the study of the interrelation between linguistic factors and psychological aspects. The discipline is mainly concerned with the mechanisms by which language is processed and represented in the mind and brain; that is, the psychological and neurobiological factors that enable humans to acquire, use, comprehend, and produce language.

Psycholinguistics is concerned with the cognitive faculties and processes that are necessary to produce the grammatical constructions of language. It is also concerned with the perception of these constructions by a listener.

Initial forays into psycholinguistics were in the philosophical and educational fields, mainly due to their location in departments other than applied sciences (e.g., cohesive data on how the human brain functioned). Modern research makes use of biology, neuroscience, cognitive science, linguistics, and information science to study how the mind-brain processes language, and less so the known processes of social sciences, human development, communication theories, and infant development, among others.

There are several subdisciplines with non-invasive techniques for studying the neurological workings of the brain. For example, neurolinguistics has become a field in its own right, and developmental psycholinguistics, as a branch of psycholinguistics, concerns itself with a child&#x27;s ability to learn language.

==Areas of study==
Psycholinguistics is an interdisciplinary field that consists of researchers from a variety of different backgrounds, including psychology, cognitive science, linguistics, speech and language pathology, and discourse analysis. Psycholinguists study how people acquire and use language, according to the following main ways:

# language acquisition: how do children acquire language?
# language comprehension: how do people comprehend language?
# language production: how do people produce language?
# second language acquisition: how do people who already know one language acquire another one?

A researcher interested in language comprehension may study word recognition during reading, to examine the processes involved in the extraction of orthographic, morphological, phonological, and semantic information from patterns in printed text. A researcher interested in language production might study how words are prepared to be spoken starting from the conceptual or semantic level (this concerns connotation, and possibly can be examined through the conceptual framework concerned with the semantic differential). Developmental psycholinguists study infants&#x27; and children&#x27;s ability to learn and process language.

Psycholinguistics further divide their studies according to the different components that make up human language.

Linguistics-related areas include:
* Phonetics and phonology are the study of speech sounds. Within psycholinguistics, research focuses on how the brain processes and understands these sounds.
* Morphology is the study of word structures, especially between related words (such as &quot;dog&quot; and &quot;dogs&quot;) and the formation of words based on rules (such as plural formation).
* Syntax is the study of how words are combined to form sentences.
* Semantics deals with the meaning of words and sentences. Where syntax is concerned with the formal structure of sentences, semantics deals with the actual meaning of sentences.
* Pragmatics is concerned with the role of context in the interpretation of meaning.
* Linguistic relativity is a principle suggesting that the structure of a language influences its speakers&#x27; worldview or cognition, and thus individuals&#x27; languages determine or shape their perceptions of the world.

==History==
In seeking to understand the properties of language acquisition, psycholinguistics has roots in debates regarding innate versus acquired behaviors (both in biology and psychology). For some time, the concept of an innate trait was something that was not recognized in studying the psychology of the individual. However, with the redefinition of innateness as time progressed, behaviors considered innate could once again be analyzed as behaviors that interacted with the psychological aspect of an individual. After the diminished popularity of the behaviorist model, ethology reemerged as a leading train of thought within psychology, allowing the subject of language, an innate human behavior, to be examined once more within the scope of psychology.

=== Origin of &quot;psycholinguistics&quot; ===
The theoretical framework for psycholinguistics began to be developed before the end of the 19th century as the &quot;Psychology of Language&quot;. The work of Edward Thorndike and Frederic Bartlett laid the foundations of what would come to be known as the science of psycholinguistics. In 1936 Jacob Kantor, a prominent psychologist at the time, used the term &quot;psycholinguistic&quot; as a description within his book &quot;An Objective Psychology of Grammar&quot;.

However, the term &quot;psycholinguistics&quot; only came into widespread usage in 1946 when Kantor&#x27;s student Nicholas Pronko published an article entitled &quot;Psycholinguistics: A Review&quot;. Pronko&#x27;s desire was to unify myriad related theoretical approaches under a single name. Psycholinguistics was used for the first time to talk about an interdisciplinary science &quot;that could be coherent&quot;, as well as being the title of &quot;Psycholinguistics: A Survey of Theory and Research Problems&quot;, a 1954 book by Charles E. Osgood and Thomas A. Sebeok.

==Theories==

===Language acquisition===

Though there is still much debate, there are two primary theories on childhood language acquisition:

* the behaviorist perspective, whereby all language must be learned by the child; and
* the innatist perspective, which believes that the abstract system of language cannot be learned, but that humans possess an innate language faculty or access to what has been called &quot;universal grammar&quot;.

The innatist perspective began in 1959 with Noam Chomsky&#x27;s highly critical review of B.F. Skinner&#x27;s &quot;Verbal Behavior&quot; (1957). This review helped start what has been called the &quot;cognitive revolution&quot; in psychology. Chomsky posited that humans possess a special, innate ability for language, and that complex syntactic features, such as recursion, are &quot;hard-wired&quot; in the brain. These abilities are thought to be beyond the grasp of even the most intelligent and social non-humans. When Chomsky asserted that children acquiring a language have a vast search space to explore among all possible human grammars, there was no evidence that children received sufficient input to learn all the rules of their language. Hence, there must be some other innate mechanism that endows humans with the ability to learn language. According to the &quot;innateness hypothesis&quot;, such a language faculty is what defines human language and makes that faculty different from even the most sophisticated forms of animal communication.

The field of linguistics and psycholinguistics has since been defined by pro-and-con reactions to Chomsky. The view in favor of Chomsky still holds that the human ability to use language (specifically the ability to use recursion) is qualitatively different from any sort of animal ability.

The view that language must be learned was especially popular before 1960 and is well represented by the mentalistic theories of Jean Piaget and the empiricist Rudolf Carnap. Likewise, the behaviorist school of psychology puts forth the point of view that language is a behavior shaped by conditioned response; hence it is learned. The view that language can be learned has had a recent resurgence inspired by emergentism. This view challenges the &quot;innate&quot; view as scientifically unfalsifiable; that is to say, it cannot be tested. With the increase in computer technology since the 1980s, researchers have been able to simulate language acquisition using neural network models.

===Language comprehension===
The structures and uses of language are related to the formation of ontological insights. Some see this system as &quot;structured cooperation between language-users&quot; who use conceptual and semantic difference in order to exchange meaning and knowledge, as well as give meaning to language, thereby examining and describing &quot;semantic processes bound by a &#x27;stopping&#x27; constraint which are not cases of ordinary deferring.&quot; Deferring is normally done for a reason, and a rational person is always disposed to defer if there is good reason.

The theory of the &quot;semantic differential&quot; supposes universal distinctions, such as:

* Typicality: that included scales such as &quot;regular–rare&quot;, &quot;typical–exclusive&quot;;
* Reality: &quot;imaginary–real&quot;, &quot;evident–fantastic&quot;, &quot;abstract–concrete&quot;;
* Complexity: &quot;complex–simple&quot;, &quot;unlimited–limited&quot;, &quot;mysterious–usual&quot;;
* Improvement or Organization: &quot;regular–spasmodic&quot;, &quot;constant–changeable&quot;, &quot;organized–disorganized&quot;, &quot;precise–indefinite&quot;;
* Stimulation: &quot;interesting–boring&quot;, &quot;trivial–new&quot;.

====Reading====

One question in the realm of language comprehension is how people understand sentences as they read (i.e., sentence processing). Experimental research has spawned several theories about the architecture and mechanisms of sentence comprehension. These theories are typically concerned with the types of information, contained in the sentence, that the reader can use to build meaning and the point at which that information becomes available to the reader. Issues such as &quot;modular&quot; versus &quot;interactive&quot; processing have been theoretical divides in the field.

A modular view of sentence processing assumes that the stages involved in reading a sentence function independently as separate modules. These modules have limited interaction with one another. For example, one influential theory of sentence processing, the &quot;garden-path theory&quot;, states that syntactic analysis takes place first. Under this theory, as the reader is reading a sentence, he or she creates the simplest structure possible, to minimize effort and cognitive load. This is done without any input from semantic analysis or context-dependent information. Hence, in the sentence &quot;The evidence examined by the lawyer turned out to be unreliable&quot;, by the time the reader gets to the word &quot;examined&quot; he or she has committed to a reading of the sentence in which the evidence is examining something because it is the simplest parsing. This commitment is made even though it results in an implausible situation: evidence cannot examine something. Under this &quot;syntax first&quot; theory, semantic information is processed at a later stage. It is only later that the reader will recognize that he or she needs to revise the initial parsing into one in which &quot;the evidence&quot; is being examined. In this example, readers typically recognize their mistake by the time they reach &quot;by the lawyer&quot; and must go back and reevaluate the sentence. This reanalysis is costly and contributes to slower reading times.

In contrast to the modular view, an interactive theory of sentence processing, such as a constraint-based lexical approach assumes that all available information contained within a sentence can be processed at any time. Under an interactive view, the semantics of a sentence (such as plausibility) can come into play early on to help determine the structure of a sentence. Hence, in the sentence above, the reader would be able to make use of plausibility information in order to assume that &quot;the evidence&quot; is being examined instead of doing the examining. There are data to support both modular and interactive views; which view is correct is debatable.

When reading, saccades can cause the mind to skip over words because it does not see them as important to the sentence, and the mind completely omits it from the sentence or supplies the wrong word in its stead. This can be seen in &quot;Paris in thethe Spring&quot;. This is a common psychological test, where the mind will often skip the second &quot;the&quot;, especially when there is a line break in between the two.

===Language production===
Language production refers to how people produce language, either in written or spoken form, in a way that conveys meanings comprehensible to others. One of the most effective ways to explain the way people represent meanings using rule-governed languages is by observing and analyzing instances of speech errors, which include speech disfluencies like false starts, repetition, reformulation and constant pauses in between words or sentences, as well as slips of the tongue, like-blendings, substitutions, exchanges (e.g. Spoonerism), and various pronunciation errors.

These speech errors have significant implications for understanding how language is produced, in that they reflect that:
# Speech is not planned in advance: speech errors such as substitution and exchanges show that one does not plan their entire sentence before they speak. Rather, their language faculty is constantly tapped during the speech production process. This is accounted for by the limitation of working memory. In particular, errors involving exchanges imply that one plans one&#x27;s sentence ahead but only with regard to its significant ideas (e.g. the words that constitute the core meaning) and only to a certain extent.
# Lexicon is organized semantically and phonologically: substitution and pronunciation errors show that lexicon is organized not only by its meaning, but also its form.
# Morphologically complex words are assembled: errors involving blending within a word reflect that there seems to be a rule governing the construction of words in production (and also likely in mental lexicon). In other words, speakers generate the morphologically complex words by merging morphemes rather than retrieving them as chunks.

It is useful to differentiate between three separate phases of language production:

# conceptualization: &quot;determining what to say&quot;; 
# formulation: &quot;translating the intention to say something into linguistic form&quot;;
# execution: &quot;the detailed articulatory planning and articulation itself&quot;.

Psycholinguistic research has largely concerned itself with the study of formulation because the conceptualization phase remains largely elusive and mysterious.

===Cognition and linguistic relativity===
Linguistic relativity, often associated with the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, posits that the structure of a language influences cognitive processes and world perception. While early formulations of this idea were largely speculative, modern psycholinguistic research has reframed it as a testable hypothesis within the broader study of language and thought.

Contemporary approaches to linguistic relativity are often discussed into following perspectives:

# Weak linguistic relativity – Language biases cognitive tendencies but does not determine thought. This perspective aligns with experimental findings showing that linguistic structures influence perception, memory, and categorization probabilistically rather than absolutely.
# Language as a cognitive tool – Language serves as a scaffolding mechanism for cognitive processes, actively shaping mental representations in domains such as space, time, and color perception.
A key refinement of linguistic relativity is Slobin’s (1996) &quot;Thinking for Speaking&quot; hypothesis, which argues that language influences cognition most strongly when individuals prepare to communicate. Unlike traditional views of linguistic relativity, which suggest that language passively shapes thought, &quot;Thinking for Speaking&quot; proposes that speakers actively engage with linguistic categories and structures while constructing utterances.

From a psycholinguistic standpoint, research on linguistic relativity intersects with conceptual representations, perceptual learning, and cognitive flexibility. Experimental studies have tested these ideas by examining how speakers of different languages categorize the world differently. For instance, cross-linguistic comparisons in spatial cognition reveal that languages with absolute spatial frames (e.g., Guugu Yimithirr) encourage speakers to encode space differently than languages with relative spatial frames (e.g., English).

In the domain of bilingual cognition, psycholinguistic research suggests that bilinguals may experience cognitive restructuring, where language context modulates perception and categorization. Recent studies indicate that bilinguals can flexibly switch between different conceptual systems, depending on the language they are using, particularly in domains such as motion perception, event construal, and time perception.

Overall, linguistic relativity in psycholinguistics is no longer seen as a rigid determinism of thought by language, but rather as a gradual, experience-based modulation of cognition by linguistic structures. This perspective has led to a shift from a purely linguistic hypothesis to an integrative cognitive science framework incorporating evidence from experimental psychology, neuroscience, and computational modeling.

==Methodologies==

===Behavioral tasks===
Many of the experiments conducted in psycholinguistics, especially early on, are behavioral in nature. In these types of studies, subjects are presented with linguistic stimuli and asked to respond. For example, they may be asked to make a judgment about a word (lexical decision), reproduce the stimulus, or say a visually presented word aloud. Reaction times to respond to the stimuli (usually on the order of milliseconds) and proportion of correct responses are the most often employed measures of performance in behavioral tasks. Such experiments often take advantage of priming effects, whereby a &quot;priming&quot; word or phrase appearing in the experiment can speed up the lexical decision for a related &quot;target&quot; word later.

As an example of how behavioral methods can be used in psycholinguistics research, Fischler (1977) investigated word encoding, using a lexical-decision task. He asked participants to make decisions about whether two strings of letters were English words. Sometimes the strings would be actual English words requiring a &quot;yes&quot; response, and other times they would be non-words requiring a &quot;no&quot; response. A subset of the licit words were related semantically (e.g., cat–dog) while others were unrelated (e.g., bread–stem). Fischler found that related word pairs were responded to faster, compared to unrelated word pairs, which suggests that semantic relatedness can facilitate word encoding.

===Eye-movements===
Recently, eye tracking has been used to study online language processing. Beginning with Rayner (1978), the importance of understanding eye-movements during reading was established. Later, Tanenhaus et al. (1995) used a visual-world paradigm to study the cognitive processes related to spoken language. Assuming that eye movements are closely linked to the current focus of attention, language processing can be studied by monitoring eye movements while a subject is listening to spoken language.

===Language production errors===
The analysis of systematic errors in speech, as well as the writing and typing of language, can provide evidence of the process that has generated it. Errors of speech, in particular, grant insight into how the mind produces language while a speaker is mid-utterance. Speech errors tend to occur in the lexical, morpheme, and phoneme encoding steps of language production, as seen by the ways errors can manifest themselves. 

The types of speech errors, with some examples, include:

* Substitutions (phoneme and lexical) — replacing a sound with an unrelated sound, or a word with its antonym, saying such as &quot;verbal outfit&quot; instead of &quot;verbal output&quot;, or &quot;He rode his bike tomorrow&quot; instead of &quot;...yesterday&quot;, respectively;
* Blends — mixing two synonyms and saying &quot;my stummy hurts&quot; in place of either &quot;stomach&quot; or &quot;tummy&quot;;
* Exchanges (phoneme [aka spoonerisms] and morpheme) — swapping two onset sounds or two root words, and saying &quot;You hissed my mystery lectures&quot; instead of &quot;You missed my history lectures&quot;, or &quot;They&#x27;re Turking talkish&quot; instead of &quot;They&#x27;re talking Turkish&quot;, respectively;
* Morpheme shifts — moving a function morpheme such as &quot;-ly&quot; or &quot;-ed&quot; to a different word and saying &quot;easy enoughly&quot; instead of &quot;easily enough&quot;,
* Perseveration — incorrectly starting a word with a sound that was a part of the previous utterance, such as saying &quot;John gave the goy a ball&quot; instead of &quot;John gave the boy a ball&quot;;
* Anticipation — replacing a sound with one that belongs later in the utterance, such as saying &quot;She drank a cot cup of tea&quot; instead of &quot;She drank a hot cup of tea&quot;.

Speech errors will usually occur in the stages that involve lexical, morpheme, or phoneme encoding, and usually not in the first step of semantic encoding. This can be attributed to a speaker still conjuring the idea of what to say; and unless he changes his mind, can not be mistaken for what he wanted to say.

===Neuroimaging===
Until the recent advent of non-invasive medical techniques, brain surgery was the preferred way for language researchers to discover how language affects the brain. For example, severing the corpus callosum (the bundle of nerves that connects the two hemispheres of the brain) was at one time a treatment for some forms of epilepsy. Researchers could then study the ways in which the comprehension and production of language were affected by such drastic surgery. When an illness made brain surgery necessary, language researchers had an opportunity to pursue their research.

Newer, non-invasive techniques now include brain imaging by positron emission tomography (PET); functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); event-related potentials (ERPs) in electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG); and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Brain imaging techniques vary in their spatial and temporal resolutions (fMRI has a resolution of a few thousand neurons per pixel, and ERP has millisecond accuracy). Each methodology has advantages and disadvantages for the study of psycholinguistics.

===Computational modeling===
Computational modelling, such as the DRC model of reading and word recognition proposed by Max Coltheart and colleagues, is another methodology, which refers to the practice of setting up cognitive models in the form of executable computer programs. Such programs are useful because they require theorists to be explicit in their hypotheses and because they can be used to generate accurate predictions for theoretical models that are so complex that discursive analysis is unreliable. Other examples of computational modelling are McClelland and Elman&#x27;s TRACE model of speech perception and Franklin Chang&#x27;s Dual-Path model of sentence production.

===Psychophysical approach===
The psychophysical approach in psycholinguistics applies quantitative measurement techniques to investigate how linguistic structures influence perception and cognitive processes. Unlike traditional behavioral experiments that rely on categorical judgments or reaction times, psychophysical methods allow for precise, continuous measurement of perceptual and cognitive changes induced by language.

A key advantage of psychophysical methods is their ability to capture fine-grained perceptual effects of language. For instance, studies on color perception have used just-noticeable difference (JND) thresholds to show that speakers of languages with finer color distinctions (e.g., Russian for light vs. dark blue) exhibit heightened perceptual sensitivity at linguistic category boundaries.

Recent psychophysical research has also been applied to time perception, investigating how bilinguals process temporal information differently based on their linguistic background. Using psychophysical duration estimation tasks, researchers have demonstrated that bilinguals may exhibit different time perception patterns depending on which language they are using at the moment.

These methods provide insights into how linguistic categories shape cognitive processing at a perceptual level, distinguishing between effects that arise from language structure itself and those that emerge from general cognitive mechanisms. As psycholinguistics continues to integrate computational and neuroscientific approaches, psychophysical techniques offer a bridge between language processing and sensory cognition, refining our understanding of how language interacts with perception.

==Areas for further research==
Psycholinguistics is concerned with the nature of the processes that the brain undergoes in order to comprehend and produce language. For example, the cohort model seeks to describe how words are retrieved from the mental lexicon when an individual hears or sees linguistic input. Using new non-invasive imaging techniques, recent research seeks to shed light on the areas of the brain involved in language processing.

Another unanswered question in psycholinguistics is whether the human ability to use syntax originates from innate mental structures or social interaction, and whether or not some animals can be taught the syntax of human language.

Two other major subfields of psycholinguistics investigate first language acquisition, the process by which infants acquire language, and second language acquisition. It is much more difficult for adults to acquire second languages than it is for infants to learn their first language (infants are able to learn more than one native language easily). Thus, sensitive periods may exist during which language can be learned readily. A great deal of research in psycholinguistics focuses on how this ability develops and diminishes over time. It also seems to be the case that the more languages one knows, the easier it is to learn more.

The field of aphasiology deals with language deficits that arise because of brain damage. Studies in aphasiology can offer both advances in therapy for individuals suffering from aphasia and further insight into how the brain processes language.

<text>Leaves of Grass is a poetry collection by American poet Walt Whitman. Though it was first published in 1855, Whitman spent most of his professional life writing, rewriting, and expanding &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; until his death in 1892. Six or nine individual editions of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; were produced, depending on how they are distinguished. This resulted in vastly different editions over four decades. The first edition was a small book of twelve poems, and the last was a compilation of over 400.

The collection of loosely connected poems represents the celebration of his philosophy of life and humanity and praises nature and the individual human&#x27;s role in it. Rather than focusing on religious or spiritual matters, &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; focuses primarily on the body and the material world. Its poems do not rhyme or follow standard rules for meter and line length.

&quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; is also notable for its discussion of delight in sensual pleasures during a time when such candid displays were considered immoral. The book was highly controversial during its time for its explicit sexual imagery, and Whitman was subject to derision by many contemporary critics. Over time, however, the collection has infiltrated popular culture and became recognized as one of the central works of American poetry.

Among the works in this collection are &quot;Song of Myself&quot;, &quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot;, and &quot;Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking&quot;. Later editions would include Whitman&#x27;s elegy to the assassinated President Abraham Lincoln, &quot;When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom&#x27;d&quot;.

==Publication history and origin==
=== Initial publication, 1855 ===
The first edition of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; was published on July 4, 1855. The poem has its beginnings in an essay by Ralph Waldo Emerson called &quot;The Poet&quot; (1844), which expressed the need for the United States to have its own new and unique poet to write about the new country&#x27;s virtues and vices. This concept, along with the call to abandon strict rhyme and meter, were explored more fully in earlier works by John Neal: novels &quot;Randolph&quot; (1823) and &quot;Rachel Dyer&quot; (1828). Whitman, likely having read all three, consciously set out to answer their call. He thus began working on the first edition of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;. Whitman later commented on Emerson&#x27;s influence, stating, &quot;I was simmering, simmering, simmering; Emerson brought me to a boil.&quot;

On May 15, 1855, Whitman registered the title &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; with the clerk of the United States District Court, Southern District of New Jersey, and received its copyright. The title is a pun, as &quot;grass&quot; was a term given by publishers to works of minor value, and &quot;leaves&quot; is another name for the pages on which they were printed. The first edition was published in Brooklyn at the printing shop of two Scottish immigrants, James and Andrew Rome, whom Whitman had known since the 1840s. The shop was located at Fulton Street (now Cadman Plaza West) and Cranberry Street, now the site of apartment buildings that bear Whitman&#x27;s name. Whitman paid for and did much of the typesetting for the first edition himself.

A calculated feature of the first edition was that the book included neither the author nor the publisher&#x27;s name (both the author and publisher being Whitman). Instead, the cover included an engraving by Samuel Hollyer depicting Whitman himself—in work clothes and a jaunty hat, arms at his side. This figure was meant to represent the devil-may-care American working man of the time, one who might be taken as an almost idealized figure in any crowd. The engraver, later commenting on his depiction, described the character with &quot;a rakish kind of slant, like the mast of a schooner&quot;.

The first edition contained no table of contents, and none of the poems had a title. Early advertisements appealed to &quot;lovers of literary curiosities&quot; as an . Sales of the book were few, but Whitman was not discouraged.

One paper-bound copy was sent to Emerson, who had initially inspired its creation. Emerson responded with a letter of heartfelt thanks, writing, &quot;I find it the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom America has yet contributed.&quot; He went on, &quot;I am very happy in reading it, as great power makes us happy.&quot; The letter was printed in the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;—without the writer&#x27;s permission—and caused an uproar among prominent New England men of letters, including Henry David Thoreau and Amos Bronson Alcott, who were some of the few Transcendentalists who agreed with Emerson&#x27;s letter and his statements regarding &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;.
The first edition was very small and collected only twelve unnamed poems in 95 pages. Whitman once said he intended the book to be small enough to be carried in a pocket. &quot;That would tend to induce people to take me along with them and read me in the open air: I am nearly always successful with the reader in the open air&quot;, he explained. About 800 copies were printed, though only 200 were bound in its trademark green cloth cover. The only American library known to have purchased a copy of the first edition was in Philadelphia. The poems of the first edition, which were given titles in later issues, included:
* &quot;Song of Myself&quot;
* &quot;A Song for Occupations&quot;
* &quot;To Think of Time&quot;
* &quot;The Sleepers&quot;
* &quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot;
* &quot;Faces&quot;
* &quot;Song of the Answerer&quot;
* &quot;Europe: The 72d and 73d Years of These States&quot;
* &quot;A Boston Ballad&quot;
* &quot;There Was a Child Went Forth&quot;
* &quot;Who Learns My Lesson Complete?&quot; and
* &quot;Great Are the Myths&quot;

=== Republications, 1856–1889 ===

There have been held to be either six or nine editions of &quot;Leaves of Grass,&quot; the count depending on how they are distinguished: scholars who hold that an edition is an entirely new set of type will count the 1855, 1856, 1860, 1867, 1871–72, and 1881 printings; whereas others will include the 1876, 1888–1889, and 1891–1892 (the &quot;deathbed edition&quot;) releases.

The editions were of varying length, each one larger and augmented from the previous version—the final edition reached over 400 poems. The first 1855 edition is particularly notable for its inclusion of the poems &quot;Song of Myself&quot; and &quot;The Sleepers&quot;.

==== 1856–1860 ====
It was Emerson&#x27;s positive response to the first edition that inspired Whitman to quickly produce a much-expanded second edition in 1856. This new edition contained 384 pages and had a cover price of one dollar. It also included a phrase from Emerson&#x27;s letter, printed in gold leaf: &quot;I Greet You at the Beginning of a Great Career.&quot; Recognized as a &quot;first&quot; for U.S. book publishing and marketing techniques, Whitman has been cited as &quot;inventing&quot; the use of the book blurb. Laura Dassow Walls, Professor of English at the University of Notre Dame, noted, &quot;In one stroke, Whitman had given birth to the modern cover blurb, quite without Emerson&#x27;s permission.&quot; Emerson later took offense that this letter was made public and became more critical of his work. This edition included &quot;Crossing Brooklyn Ferry&quot;.

The publishers of the 1860 edition, Thayer &amp; Eldridge, declared bankruptcy shortly after its publication, and were almost unable to pay Whitman. &quot;In regard to money matters&quot;, they wrote, &quot;we are very short ourselves and it is quite impossible to send the sum&quot;. Whitman received only $250, and the original plates made their way to Boston publisher Horace Wentworth. When the 456-page book was finally issued, Whitman said, &quot;It is quite &#x27;odd&#x27;, of course&quot;, referring to its appearance: it was bound in orange cloth with symbols like a rising sun with nine spokes of light and a butterfly perched on a hand. Whitman claimed that the butterfly was real in order to foster his image as being &quot;one with nature&quot;. In fact, the butterfly was made of cloth and was attached to his finger with wire. The major poems added to this edition were &quot;A Word Out of the Sea&quot; and &quot;As I Ebb&#x27;d With the Ocean of Life&quot;.

==== 1867–1889 ====
The 1867 edition was intended to be, according to Whitman, &quot;a new &amp; much better edition of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; complete — that &quot;unkillable&quot; work!&quot; He assumed it would be the final edition. The edition, which included the &quot;Drum-Taps&quot; section, its &quot;Sequel&quot;, and the new &quot;Songs before Parting&quot;, was delayed when the binder went bankrupt and its distributing firm failed. When it was finally printed, it was a simple edition and the first to omit a picture of the poet.

In 1879, Richard Worthington purchased the electrotype plates and began printing and marketing unauthorized copies.

The 1889 (eighth) edition was little changed from the 1881 version, but it was more embellished and featured several portraits of Whitman. The biggest change was the addition of an &quot;Annex&quot; of miscellaneous additional poems.

====Sections====
By its later editions, &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; had grown to 14 sections.
* Inscriptions 
* Children of Adam
* Calamus
* Birds of Passage
* Sea-Drift
* By the Roadside 
* Drum-Taps

* Memories of President Lincoln
* Autumn Rivulets
* Whispers of Heavenly Death
* From Noon to Starry Night
* Songs of Parting
* First Annex: Sands at Seventy 
* Second Annex: Good-bye My Fancy

Earlier editions contained a section called &quot;Chants Democratic&quot;; later editions omitted some of the poems from this section, publishing others in Calamus and other sections.

=== Deathbed edition, 1892 ===
As 1891 came to a close, Whitman prepared a final edition of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, writing to a friend upon its completion, &quot;L. of G. &quot;at last complete&quot; — after 33 y&#x27;rs of hackling at it, all times &amp; moods of my life, fair weather &amp; foul, all parts of the land, and peace &amp; war, young &amp; old.&quot; This last version of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; was published in 1892 and is referred to as the &#x27;deathbed edition&#x27;. In January 1892, two months before Whitman&#x27;s death, an announcement was published in the &quot;New York Herald&quot;:

Walt Whitman wishes respectfully to notify the public that the book &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, which he has been working on at great intervals and partially issued for the past thirty-five or forty years, is now completed, so to call it, and he would like this new 1892 edition to absolutely supersede all previous ones. Faulty as it is, he decides it as by far his special and entire self-chosen poetic utterance.

By the time this last edition was completed, &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; had grown from a small book of 12 poems to a hefty tome of almost 400 poems. As the volume changed, so did the pictures that Whitman used to illustrate them—the last edition depicts an older Whitman with a full beard and jacket.

===Translations===

In 1995, &quot;Dail Glaswellt&quot;, the Welsh language translation was published.

==Analysis==
Whitman&#x27;s collection of poems in &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; is usually interpreted according to the individual poems contained within its individual editions. Discussion is often focused upon the major editions typically associated with the early respective versions of 1855 and 1856, to the 1860 edition, and finally to editions late into Whitman&#x27;s life. These latter editions would include the poem &quot;When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom&#x27;d&quot;, Whitman&#x27;s elegy to Abraham Lincoln after his death.

While Whitman has famously proclaimed (in &quot;Song of Myself&quot;) his poetry to be &quot;Nature without check with original energy&quot;, scholars have discovered that Whitman borrowed from a number of sources for his &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;. For his &quot;Drum-Taps&quot;, for instance, he lifted phrases from popular newspapers dealing with Civil War battles. He also condensed a chapter from a popular science book into his poem &quot;The World Below the Brine&quot;.

In a constantly changing culture, Whitman&#x27;s literature has an element of timelessness that appeals to the American notion of democracy and equality, producing the same experience and feelings within people living centuries apart. Originally written at a time of significant urbanization in America, &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; also responds to the impact such has on the masses. The title metaphor of grass, however, indicates a pastoral vision of rural idealism.

Particularly in &quot;Song of Myself&quot;, Whitman emphasizes an all-powerful &quot;I&quot; who serves as narrator. The &quot;I&quot; attempts to relieve both social and private problems by using powerful affirmative cultural images; the emphasis on American culture in particular helped reach Whitman&#x27;s intention of creating a distinctly American epic poem comparable to the works of Homer.

As a believer in phrenology, Whitman, in the 1855 preface to &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, includes the phrenologist among those he describes as &quot;the lawgivers of poets&quot;. Borrowing from the discipline, Whitman uses the phrenological concept of &quot;adhesiveness&quot; in reference to one&#x27;s propensity for friendship and camaraderie.

=== Thematic changes ===
Whitman edited, revised, and republished &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; many times before his death, and over the years
his focus and ideas were not static. One critic has identified three major &quot;thematic drifts&quot; in &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;: the period from 1855 to 1859, from 1859 to 1865, and from 1866 to his death.

In the first period, 1855 to 1859, his major work is &quot;Song of Myself&quot;, which exemplifies his prevailing love for freedom. &quot;Freedom in nature, nature which is perfect in time and place and freedom in expression, leading to the expression of love in its sensuous form.&quot; The second period, from 1859 to 1865, paints the picture of a more melancholic, sober poet. In poems like &quot;Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking&quot; and &quot;When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom&#x27;d&quot;, the prevailing themes are of love and of death.

From 1866 to his death, the ideas Whitman presented in his second period had experienced an evolution: his focus on death had grown to a focus on immortality, the major theme of this period. Whitman became more conservative in his old age, and had come to believe that the importance of law exceeded the importance of freedom. His materialistic view of the world became far more spiritual, and he believed that life had no meaning outside of the context of God&#x27;s plan.

==Critical response and controversy==

When the book was first published, Whitman was fired from his job at the Department of the Interior after Secretary of the Interior James Harlan read it and said he found it offensive. An early review of the first publication focused on the persona of the anonymous poet, calling him a loafer &quot;with a certain air of mild defiance, and an expression of pensive insolence on his face&quot;. Another reviewer viewed the work as an odd attempt at reviving old Transcendental thoughts, &quot;the speculations of that school of thought which culminated at Boston fifteen or eighteen years ago&quot;. Emerson approved of the work in part because he considered it a means of reviving Transcendentalism, though even he urged Whitman to tone down the sexual imagery in 1860.

Poet John Greenleaf Whittier was said to have thrown his 1855 edition into the fire. Thomas Wentworth Higginson wrote, &quot;It is no discredit to Walt Whitman that he wrote &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, only that he did not burn it afterwards.&quot; &quot;The Saturday Press&quot; printed a thrashing review that advised its author to commit suicide.

Critic Rufus Wilmot Griswold reviewed &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; in the November 10, 1855 issue of &quot;The Criterion&quot;, calling it &quot;a mass of stupid filth&quot;, and categorized its author as a filthy free lover. Griswold also suggested, in Latin, that Whitman was guilty of &quot;that horrible sin not to be mentioned among Christians&quot;, one of the earliest public accusations of Whitman&#x27;s homosexuality. Griswold&#x27;s intensely negative review almost caused the publication of the second edition to be suspended. Whitman incorporated the full review, including the innuendo, in a later edition of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;.

Not all responses were negative, however. Critic William Michael Rossetti considered &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; a classic along the lines of the works of William Shakespeare and Dante Alighieri. A woman from Connecticut named Susan Garnet Smith wrote to Whitman to profess her love for him after reading &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; and even offered him her womb should he want a child. Although he found much of the language &quot;reckless and indecent&quot;, critic and editor George Ripley believed &quot;isolated portions&quot; of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; radiated &quot;vigor and quaint beauty&quot;.

Whitman firmly believed he would be accepted and embraced by the populace, especially the working class. Years later, he regretted not having toured the country to deliver his poetry directly by lecturing:If I had gone directly to the people, read my poems, faced the crowds, got into immediate touch with Tom, Dick, and Harry instead of waiting to be interpreted, I&#x27;d have had my audience at once.

=== Censorship in the United States ===
On March 1, 1882, Boston district attorney Oliver Stevens wrote to Whitman&#x27;s publisher, James R. Osgood, that &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; constituted &quot;obscene literature&quot;. Urged by the New England Society for the Suppression of Vice, his letter said: We are of the opinion that this book is such a book as brings it within the provisions of the Public Statutes respecting obscene literature and suggest the propriety of withdrawing the same from circulation and suppressing the editions thereof.Stevens demanded the removal of the poems &quot;A Woman Waits for Me&quot; and &quot;To a Common Prostitute&quot;, as well as changes to &quot;Song of Myself&quot;, &quot;From Pent-Up Aching Rivers&quot;, &quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot;, &quot;Spontaneous Me&quot;, &quot;Native Moments&quot;, &quot;The Dalliance of the Eagles&quot;, &quot;By Blue Ontario&#x27;s Shore&quot;, &quot;Unfolded Out of the Folds&quot;, &quot;The Sleepers&quot;, and &quot;Faces&quot;.

Whitman rejected the censorship, writing to Osgood, &quot;The list whole &amp; several is rejected by me, &amp; will not be thought of under any circumstances.&quot; Osgood refused to republish the book and returned the plates to Whitman when his suggested changes and deletions were ignored. The poet found a new publisher, Rees Welsh &amp; Company, which released a new edition of the book in 1882. Whitman believed the controversy would increase sales, which proved true. Its banning in Boston, for example, became a major scandal and it generated much publicity for Whitman and his work. Though it was also banned by retailers like Wanamaker&#x27;s in Philadelphia, this version went through five editions of 1,000 copies each. Its first printing, released on July 18, sold out in a day.

==Legacy==

Its status as one of the more important collections of American poetry has meant that over time various groups and movements have used &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, and Whitman&#x27;s work in general, to advance their own political and social purposes. For example:

* In the first half of the 20th century, the popular Little Blue Book series introduced Whitman&#x27;s work to a wider audience than ever before. A series that backed socialist and progressive viewpoints, the publication connected the poet&#x27;s focus on the common man to the empowerment of the working class.
* During World War II, the American government distributed for free much of Whitman&#x27;s poetry to their soldiers, in the belief that his celebrations of the American Way would inspire the people tasked with protecting it. 
* Whitman&#x27;s work has been claimed in the name of racial equality. In a preface to the 1946 anthology &quot;I Hear the People Singing: Selected Poems of Walt Whitman&quot;, Langston Hughes wrote that Whitman&#x27;s &quot;all-embracing words lock arms with workers and farmers, Negroes and whites, Asiatics and Europeans, serfs, and free men, beaming democracy to all.&quot;
* Similarly, a 1970 volume of Whitman&#x27;s poetry published by the United States Information Agency describes Whitman as a man who will &quot;mix indiscriminately&quot; with the people. The volume, which was presented for an international audience, attempted to present Whitman as representative of an America that accepts people of all groups.

Nevertheless, Whitman has been criticized for the nationalism expressed in &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; and other works. In a 2009 essay regarding Whitman&#x27;s nationalism in the first edition, Nathanael O&#x27;Reilly claims that &quot;Whitman&#x27;s imagined America is arrogant, expansionist, hierarchical, racist and exclusive; such an America is unacceptable to Native Americans, African-Americans, immigrants, the disabled, the infertile, and all those who value equal rights.&quot;
==In popular culture==

=== Film and television ===
* &quot;The Untold Want&quot; features prominently in the Academy Award-winning 1942 film &quot;Now, Voyager&quot;, starring Claude Rains, Bette Davis, and Paul Henreid.
* &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; (1989) makes repeated references to the poem &quot;O Captain! My Captain!&quot;, along with other references to Whitman.
* &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; plays a prominent role in the American television series &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;. Episode eight of season five (&quot;Gliding Over All&quot;, after poem 271 of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;) pulls together many of the series&#x27; references to &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, such as the fact that protagonist Walter White has the same initials (and almost the same name) as Walt Whitman (as noted in episode four of season four, &quot;Bullet Points&quot;, and made more salient in &quot;Gliding Over All&quot;), that leads DEA agent Hank Schrader to gradually realize Walter is the notorious drug dealer Heisenberg. Numerous reviewers have analyzed and discussed the various connections among Walt Whitman/&quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;/&quot;Gliding Over All&quot;, Walter White, and the show.
* In &quot;Peace, Love &amp; Misunderstanding&quot; (2011), &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; is read by Jane Fonda and Elizabeth Olsen&#x27;s characters.
* In season 3, episode 8 of the BYU TV series &quot;Granite Flats&quot;, Timothy gives Madeline a first-edition copy of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; as a Christmas gift.
* American singer Lana Del Rey quotes some verses from Whitman&#x27;s &quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot; in her short film &quot;Tropico&quot; (2013).
* In season 1, episode 3 of &quot;Ratched&quot; (2020) Lily Cartwright is seen reading &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; while on psychiatric admission for &quot;sodomy&quot;.
* In &quot;Bull Durham&quot; (1988), Susan Sarandon&#x27;s character Annie Savoy reads Tim Robbins&#x27;s character, Ebby Calvin &quot;Nuke&quot; Laloosh, excerpts from Whitman&#x27;s &quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot;. When Nuke asks Annie who Walt Whitman plays for, she responds &quot;He sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars&quot;.
* In season 3, episode 5 of &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot;, Joe Lando&#x27;s character, Byron Sully, reads an excerpt from section 22 of &quot;Song of Myself&quot; to Dr. Mike. She becomes uneasy at the innuendos suggested in the poem.
* In season 4, episode 1 of &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot; (2014), the character of Mr. Peanutbutter is given a copy of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; by his ski instructor Professor Thistlethorpe, however it is attributed to &quot;Walt Whitmantis&quot; instead of Walt Whitman.

=== Literature ===
* &quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot; was used by author Ray Bradbury as the title of both a 1969 short story and the book it appeared in (&quot;I Sing the Body Electric!&quot;), after first appearing as the title of an episode Bradbury wrote in 1962 for &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (&quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot;).
* &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; features prominently in Lauren Gunderson&#x27;s American Theatre Critics Association award-winning play &quot;I and You&quot; (2013).
* Roger Zelazny&#x27;s 1979 time-travel novel &quot;Roadmarks&quot; features a cybernetically-enhanced edition of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, one of two such in the story, that acts as a side character giving the protagonist advice and quoting the original. The other &quot;book&quot; is Baudelaire&#x27;s &quot;Les Fleurs du Mal&quot;.
* &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; appears in John Green&#x27;s 2008 novel &quot;Paper Towns&quot;, in which the poem &quot;Song of Myself&quot; plays a particularly noteworthy role in the plot.

=== Music ===
* &quot;A Sea Symphony&quot; (Symphony No. 1) by Ralph Vaughan Williams contains text from &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, written between 1903 and 1909.
*&quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot; (1972) is the second album released by Weather Report.
*&quot;Leaves of Grass: A Choral Symphony&quot; was composed by Robert Strassburg in 1992.
* American singer Lana Del Rey references Walt Whitman and &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; in her song &quot;Body Electric&quot;, from her EP &quot;Paradise&quot; (2012).
*&quot;Drei Hymnen von Walt Whitman&quot; (1919) by Paul Hindemith uses translated German text from &quot;Ages and ages, returning at intervals&quot;; &quot;When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom&#x27;d&quot;; &quot;Beat! Beat! Drums!&quot;
*&quot;Weave in, my hardy life&quot; is a composition by Aaron Travers for choir, bandoneon and piano, and is a setting of the poem of that name from the &quot;From Noon to Starry Night&quot; section of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;.

<text>Alexander Genrikhovich Beliavsky (, , ; also romanized &quot;Belyavsky&quot;; born December 17, 1953) is a Soviet, Ukrainian and Slovenian chess player. He was awarded the title of Grandmaster by FIDE in 1975. He is also a chess coach and in 2004 was awarded the title of FIDE Senior Trainer.

Beliavsky was born in Lviv, USSR, now Ukraine. He now lives in Slovenia and has been playing for its national team since 1996.

==Career==

Beliavsky won the World Junior Chess Championship in 1973 and the USSR Chess Championship four times (in 1974, 1980, 1987 and 1990).

In the 1982–84 World Chess Championship cycle, he qualified for the Candidates Tournament, losing to eventual winner Garry Kasparov in the quarterfinals of the 1983 Candidates matches. Beliavsky played on the top board for the USSR team that won the gold medal in the 1984 Chess Olympiad. Beliavsky was a mainstay at international tournaments throughout the eighties and early nineties, however, he did not perform to the highest levels. In the 1985-87 Candidates he finished 7/16, and neither did he qualify for the 1988-90 Candidates tournament nor the 1994-95 PCA Candidates tournament.

In tournaments, he was first equal at Baden bei Wien 1980, first at Tilburg 1981, second equal at Tilburg 1984, joint winner at Wijk aan Zee 1984 and joint second at the same event a year later. At the second Russia (USSR) vs Rest of the World match in 1984, he was the top scorer for the victorious Soviet team, defeating Yasser Seirawan 2–0 and Bent Larsen 1½–½. Beliavsky won the Vidmar Memorial tournament four times: in 1999, 2001, 2003 (with Emil Sutovsky) and 2005. He finished third in the Linares tournament of 1991, behind Vasyl Ivanchuk and Garry Kasparov.

From September 2009 to May 2010, he was the oldest person among the world&#x27;s top 100 active players, and he made a brief reappearance in June 2013 at age 59. He competed at the 2009 Maccabiah Games. In 2013 he tied for 1st–8th places with Alexander Moiseenko, Evgeny Romanov, Hrant Melkumyan, Constantin Lupulescu, Francisco Vallejo Pons, Sergei Movsesian, Ian Nepomniachtchi, Alexey Dreev and Evgeny Alekseev in the European Individual Chess Championship, thus qualifying for the FIDE World Cup.

Beliavsky shares the record for having defeated the most undisputed world champions. He has defeated nine - every undisputed world champion from Vassily Smyslov to Magnus Carlsen except Bobby Fischer - a record he shares with Paul Keres and Victor Korchnoi.
