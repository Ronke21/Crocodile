<text>A zebra crossing (British English) or a marked crosswalk (American English) is a pedestrian crossing marked with white stripes (zebra markings). Normally, pedestrians are afforded precedence over vehicular traffic, although the significance of the markings may vary by jurisdiction.

The first zebra crossing in the world was installed in Slough, United Kingdom, in 1951 to enhance pedestrian safety at new and already existing crossing points. Since then, zebra markings have come to be used internationally to denote pedestrian crossings, though many have been replaced by various types of signalised crossing due to safety concerns.

Terminology and usage of the markings varies by country. In the UK and other Commonwealth countries, they are usually called zebra crossings, as the stripes resemble the striped coat of a zebra. In the UK and some other European countries, zebra markings are only found at unsignalised, standalone crossings without traffic signals and must be accompanied with upright belisha beacons; in this context, the striped markings indicate absolute priority for pedestrians. In North America and in much of Continental Europe, they can be found at any type of crossing; in this context, zebra markings may or may not indicate pedestrian priority, and this priority may be dependent on traffic signals.

== History ==
=== Etymology ===
The origin of the zebra title is debated. It is generally attributed to British MP James Callaghan who, in 1948, visited the country&#x27;s Transport and Road Research Laboratory which was working on a new idea for safe pedestrian crossings. On being shown a black and white design, Callaghan is said to have remarked that it resembled a zebra. Callaghan did not himself claim authorship of the term.

=== Introduction ===
The first zebra crossing was introduced on Slough High Street in the United Kingdom on 31 October 1951. Pedestrian crossings with Belisha beacons had been in use in the UK since the 1930s, originally introduced under Section 18 of the Road Traffic Act, 1934. The Belisha beacon is an upright crossing marking, still required by zebra and parallel crossings in the UK, named after the Minister of Transport in 1934, Leslie Hore-Belisha.

However, with an increase of car traffic, the effectiveness of the beacons was waning; both pedestrians and drivers were ignoring the crossing. From 1949 to 1951, the then-named Ministry of Transport experimented with designs to improve visibility and increase usage, until the familiar black and white stripes were introduced. The zebra crossing was then trialed at 1,000 experimental sites across the UK at this time. The zebra markings are credited to physicist and traffic engineer George Charlesworth, who was the first head of the traffic section at the Road Research Laboratory.

== Characteristics ==
The crossing is characterised by longitudinal stripes on the road, parallel to the flow of the traffic, alternately a light colour and a dark one. The similarity of these markings to those of a zebra gave rise to the crossing&#x27;s name. The light colour is usually white and the dark colour may be painted – in which case black is typical – or left unpainted if the road surface itself is dark. The stripes are typically wide.

Sometimes, zebra crossings are placed on a speed bump, meaning the zebra crossing is level with the pavement. This is done to make it safer for pedestrians to cross, since drivers need to slow down to go over the speed bump. However, this is more expensive than a traditional zebra crossing, and can impede the flow of traffic and response times for emergency vehicles, especially on roads with higher speed limits.

In the United Kingdom, the crossing is marked with Belisha beacons, which are flashing amber globes on black and white posts on each side of the road, named after Leslie Hore-Belisha, the Minister of Transport, who introduced them in 1934. Pedestrians have priority when they step onto the crossing: &quot;The Highway Code&quot; states that road traffic &quot;MUST give way when a pedestrian has moved onto a crossing.&quot;

In other countries, such as the United States, zebra crossings are also used on pedestrian crossings controlled by traffic signals.

== Method of marking ==
The lines of a zebra crossing are commonly laid down by a road marking machine. Because the width of crossing lines is wider than other traffic lines, the marking shoe of a zebra cross marking machine is accordingly wider. The machine is hand pushed.

==Zebra crossings by country==
=== United Kingdom ===

In the United Kingdom, it is the law that all road users, including motorists, give way to pedestrians who have set foot on a zebra crossing. A fine of £100 and three licence penalty points is given to those failing to give way at the crossings. This penalty has attracted criticisms of leniency when compared to other countries which enforce fines of up to £2,000. For failing to give way at a zebra crossing patrolled by a school crossing patrol (&quot;lollipop man/lady&quot; as they are commonly called), however, the penalty rises to £1,000 and a minimum of three licence points, with the possibility even of disqualification. In the United Kingdom, motorists have to stop for a crossing patrol, even when it is not on a pedestrian crossing.

In the United Kingdom, lollipop men or women (school crossing patrols) frequently attend zebra crossings near schools, at the hours when schoolchildren arrive and leave. Their widely used nickname arose because of the warning sign they hold up as they stop traffic: the sign is a large round disc on a long pole and thus resembles a giant lollipop, although they were originally of a square design.

=== Continental Europe, Ireland, and the Middle East ===
In Germany, Scandinavia, and most other European countries, pedestrians have right of way if they are still on the kerb but about to enter the crossing.
In Switzerland yellow stripes are used for pedestrian crossings. Unlike a yellow tiger crossing in the UK, however, cyclists are required to dismount to cross.

In Lebanon, striped crossings are the preferred pedestrian crossing type, though many other variations exist. Zebra crossings are painted mostly at signalised intersections and roundabouts. They are also widely used in school areas and stop sign regulated intersections. They provide priority and right of way to pedestrians under all circumstances.

=== North America ===
In North America, pedestrian crossings are almost exclusively called crosswalks, but depending on the marking style, they can have different names.
Although zebra crossings exist in the US, the term is used to describe a type of diagonal crosswalk with two parallel lines painted over the stripes, similar but not identical to the ladder style. Instead, zebra crossings are called &quot;continental crosswalks&quot; and are the preferred style in many states because of its enhanced visibility compared to the other marking styles. In most areas of Canada, standard parallel lines markings are the preferred crosswalk style, except in Toronto where zebra markings are widely used.

=== Oceania ===
In New Zealand, motorists are required to give way to pedestrians. Pedestrians wishing to cross the road within of a crossing facility (which includes zebra crossings) must use a crossing facility.

In Australia, raised zebra crossings are sometimes called wombat crossings.

==Compliance==
A 1998 Swedish study by A Várhelyi at Lund University investigated driver behavior at zebra crossings: 
==Alternative designs==
===Cow crossing===
The city of A Coruña in Galicia, Spain, has opted for spots rather than stripes at a pedestrian crossing, resembling a cow instead of a zebra. The reason for this option is to recognise the importance of the animal for the region&#x27;s farming.

===Tiger and parallel crossings===
A tiger crossing is a variation used in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. It is painted yellow and black. In the United Kingdom, it allows cyclists to cross in a central area of the road without dismounting, and obliges motorists to give way to both cyclists and pedestrians. Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire experimented with tiger crossings during 2006–2007, but replaced them with toucan crossings. A tiger crossing was introduced in Portsmouth in 2019.

=== &quot;Three-dimensional&quot; crossings ===
A number of countries have experimented with &quot;three-dimensional&quot; zebra crossings based on an optical illusion. The white stripes of the crossing appear to hover above the ground as though they were a physical barrier. Although intended to improve pedestrian safety on the crossings, they have also been popular with tourists who like to be photographed crossing them, appearing to hover above the ground. Such crossings can be found in Australia, Iceland, Malaysia, India, New Zealand and the United States.

Crossings can be combined with speed tables (i.e. raised sections of road designed to physically slow traffic down) as an additional safety measure.

===Rainbow crossings===
A zebra crossing immediately outside the Russian Embassy in Helsinki was painted in summer 2013 with the colours of the rainbow to protest the Russian government&#x27;s policy towards lesbian and gay people, the rainbow being one symbol of the LGBT culture.

A similar protest has also been made on a zebra crossing near the Russian Embassy in Stockholm, Sweden.

In 2018 in Paris, the authorities decided to paint some crossings with rainbow borders for the Pride; those were supposed to be temporary, but after homophobic vandalism, the municipality declared that the rainbow stripes would remain permanently.

==In popular culture==
A zebra crossing appears on the cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Abbey Road&quot; album. The cover made the crossing a tourist attraction, and it has been incorporated into the Abbey Road Studios logo. Since the Abbey Road photo was taken, zigzag lines at the kerb and in the centre of the road have been added to all zebra crossings. English Heritage has given this crossing Grade II listed building status.

There is also a tongue-in-cheek reference to zebra crossings in the science-fiction comedy &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; by English author Douglas Adams, in reference to Man using the improbable creature called the Babel fish as proof of the &quot;non&quot;-existence of God; the novel says, &quot;Man then goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed at the next zebra crossing.&quot;

The La Paz traffic zebras are a team of young people who dress in zebra costumes and dance in the streets of La Paz, Bolivia, in order to make drivers and pedestrians aware of traffic rules.

<text>Sather Tower is a bell tower with clocks on its four faces on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley. It is more commonly known as The Campanile ( , ) for its resemblance to the Campanile di San Marco in Venice. It is a recognizable symbol of the university.

Given by Jane K. Sather in memory of her husband, banker Peder Sather, it is the second-tallest bell-and-clock-tower in the world.
Its current 61-bell carillon, built around a nucleus of 12 bells also given by Jane Sather, can be heard for many miles and supports an extensive program of education in campanology.

Sather Tower also houses many of the Department of Integrative Biology&#x27;s fossils (mainly from the La Brea Tar Pits) because its cool, dry interior is suited for their preservation.

== Overview ==
At tall, it is the second-tallest free-standing bell-and-clock-tower in the world. It includes seven principal floors and an eighth-floor observation deck above the base.

Designed by John Galen Howard, founder of the Department of Architecture at the university, Sather Tower was completed in 1915 and opened to the public in 1916. It marked a secondary axis in Howard&#x27;s original Beaux-Arts campus plan and has been a major point of orientation in almost every campus master plan since.

Sather Tower houses a full concert carillon, enlarged from the original 12-bell chime installed in October 1917 to 48 bells in 1979 and the current 61 bells in 1983.

During the Fall and Spring semesters, the carillon is performed for ten minutes at 7:50 a.m., noon, and 6:00 p.m. during weekdays, from 12:00–12:15 p.m. and 6:00–6:10 p.m. on Saturdays, and from 2:00–2:45 p.m. on Sundays and intermittently at other times of the year. The bells also toll the hour 7 days a week between the hours of 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. At noon on the last day of instruction each semester, &quot;They&#x27;re Hanging Danny Deever in the Morning&quot; is played. (The song employs only the original set of bells installed in 1917.) Following that, the carillon is silent until the end of finals.

A gift by Evelyn and Jerry Chambers in 1983 endowed the position of University Carillonist as well as practice rooms, practice keyboards, a campanology library, and international Carillon Festivals every five years from the anniversary of the Class of 1928. Private and group lessons are offered in carillon through the Department of Music, subject to auditions and with Music majors receiving priority. Students work on one of Sather Tower&#x27;s two practice keyboards until they are ready to perform on the carillon itself.


An elevator takes visitors 200 feet (61 m) up to an observation deck with sweeping views of the campus, the surrounding hills, San Francisco, and the Golden Gate. Admission is free for UC Berkeley students, staff, and faculty, four dollars for seniors, Cal Alumni Association members, and persons age 17 and under, and five dollars for everyone else.

The trumpets of the California Marching Band every year play Cal spirit songs during Big Game week from the top of the tower. Known as the Campanile Concert, the music can be heard throughout the campus and Berkeley, and in some cases, all the way to Oakland.

The surrounding promenade features a grid of pollarded London Plane trees, frequently enjoyed for the sport of slacklining.

On April 16, 1959, a 67-year-old retired attorney jumped to his death, prompting a daily patrol to guard the platform. On January 4, 1961, a 19-year-old undergraduate student committed suicide. Following this second suicide, the university installed glass panes to enclose the viewing platform. These panes were removed in 1979 due to complaints that the panes were muffling the sound of the expanded carillon. In 1981, metal bars were installed. Nevertheless, in 1982, an undergraduate student managed to scale the newly installed bars but was talked down from the ledge.

In 2017, a pair of peregrine falcons began nesting on top of Sather Tower. They were followed by webcams and the Cal Falcons social media project.

== Carillon and its history ==
The Berkeley Carillon originated as a twelve bell chime, cast in 1915 by John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough, England. The original bells were a gift of Jane K. Sather, who also gave the university the Sather Tower (in which the bells were housed), Sather Gate (named for her husband the Norwegian-born banker Peder Sather), and endowed chairs in History and Classics. The original bells were installed in 1917 and played for the first time on November 3, 1917, to mark California&#x27;s Big Game against Washington. The delay between the founding and the installation of the bells was caused by World War I, as well as the US Customs Service in San Francisco.

The original bells all bear the inscription &quot;Gift of Jane K. Sather 1914,&quot; acknowledging the benefactress for whom the Tower is named. The largest of the original bells bears an inscription by Isaac Flagg, Professor of Greek, emeritus, &quot;We ring, we chime, we toll, / Lend ye the silent part / Some answer in the heart, / Some echo in the soul.&quot; The current bells range from small 19 pound bells to the 10,500 pound &quot;Great Bear Bell,&quot; which tolls on the hour and features bas-relief carvings of bears as well as the constellation Ursa Major.

It was soon discovered that these twelve bells (one octave) were insufficient to play many popular tunes, including the national anthem (which requires a range of a twelfth, and thus a bare minimum of twenty bells for chromaticity throughout the range). During the following decades there were a number of discussions about enlarging the instrument, but nothing came of this need.

A thirteenth bell was installed along with a clock in 1926 to strike the hours. This clock and bell had originally been installed in 1899 in Bacon Hall and were named for William Ashburner, a university regent.

In 1978, the Class of 1928 decided, as a fiftieth anniversary gift to the university, to add some bells. They began a campaign among their members, hoping to raise around $45,000 for a few new bells. In several days they managed to raise over $150,000 and decided at that point to enlarge the chime to a full carillon of forty-eight bells. Bids were sought, and the Fonderie Paccard of Annecy, France, was awarded the contract. The new Class of 1928 Carillon, which incorporated the original twelve bells, was installed and inaugurated in 1979. An article about the new instrument in The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America&#x27;s publication &quot;The Bulletin&quot; ended by suggesting that perhaps another class might at some future date consider adding additional bells and making this concert carillon into a grand carillon.

In 1983, Jerry Chambers, a wealthy member of the class of 1928, and his wife Evelyn (class of 1932 and honorary member of the class of 1928), along with the class of 1928, gave a handsome endowment for the carillon. These funds were used to enlarge the instrument to a fully chromatic, five-octave instrument beginning with G2, renovation of two floors of Sather Tower for two practice keyboards, a campanology collection, and a studio for the University Carillonist. In addition, the Chambers Carillon funds, which is the sole source of support for the carillon program at Berkeley, endowed a full-time position for the University Carillonist (one of only five full-time positions in North America), and a carillon festival to be held every five years honoring the Class of 1928, counting from that year.

As of 2008, the carillon program is one of the most active in the world. It offers an instructional program which attracts about thirty students each semester, a performance program of seventeen ten-minute recitals and one forty-five-minute recital each week. There is additionally a professional staff of eight artist performers, and a part-time maintenance person. The carillon program remains fully funded by the generous endowment of Jerry and Evelyn Chambers.

<text>ibiblio (formerly SunSITE.unc.edu and MetaLab.unc.edu) is a &quot;collection of collections&quot;, and hosts a diverse range of publicly available information and open source content, including software, music, literature, art, history, science, politics, and cultural studies. As an &quot;Internet librarianship&quot;, ibiblio is a digital library and archive project. It is run by the School of Information and Library Science and the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, with partners including the Center for the Public Domain, IBM, and SourceForge. It also offers streaming audio radio stations. In November 1994 it started the first internet radio stream by rebroadcasting WXYC, the UNC student-run radio station. It also takes credit for the first non-commercial IPv6 / Internet2 radio stream. Unless otherwise specified, all material on ibiblio is assumed to be in the public domain.

ibiblio is a member of the Open Library and Open Content Alliance.

==History==
In 1992, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill developed SunSITE.unc.edu, which was to be an archive and an information sharing project for the public. It was funded by grants from Sun Microsystems, and thus the name. The relationship with Sun came to an end (an amicable one, according to the ibiblio FAQ; the change in name was for a &quot;vendor-neutral name that expressed what our project has evolved into over the years&quot;) and the name was changed to MetaLab. It collaborated with various sources, including academic institutions, corporations, and information technology entrepreneurs.

Also in 1992, sunsite.unc.edu became one of the first web sites on the internet. Today, it is still the host for a copy of the oldest web page known in history.

In September 2000, MetaLab began to collaborate with the Center for the Public Domain; the name was changed to ibiblio to reflect the goal of being &quot;the public&#x27;s library and digital archive&quot;.

<doc id="158121" wikidata="Q629252" url="?curid=158121" title="Broadside (naval)">
<text>A broadside is the side of a ship, or more specifically the battery of cannon on one side of a warship or their coordinated fire in naval warfare, or a measurement of a warship&#x27;s maximum simultaneous firepower which can be delivered upon a single target (because this concentration is usually obtained by firing a broadside). From the 16th century until the early decades of the steamship, vessels had rows of guns set in each side of the hull. Firing all guns on one side of the ship became known as a &quot;broadside&quot;. The cannon of 18th-century men of war were accurate only at short range, and their penetrating power mediocre, which meant that the thick hulls of wooden ships could only be pierced at short ranges. These wooden ships sailed closer and closer towards each other until cannon fire would be effective. Each tried to be the first to fire a broadside, often giving one party a decisive headstart in the battle when it crippled the other ship.

==History==

Since ancient times, war at sea had been fought much like on land: with melee weapons and bows and arrows, but on floating wooden platforms rather than battlefields. Though the introduction of firearms was a significant change, it only slowly changed the dynamics of ship-to-ship combat. The first guns on ships were small wrought-iron pieces mounted on the open decks and in the fighting tops, often requiring only one or two men to handle them. They were designed to injure, kill or simply stun, shock and frighten the enemy prior to boarding. As guns were made more durable to withstand stronger gunpowder charges, they increased their potential to inflict critical damage to the vessel rather than just its crew. Since these guns were much heavier than the earlier anti-personnel weapons, they had to be placed lower in the ships, and fire from gunports, to avoid ships becoming unstable. In Northern Europe the technique of building ships with clinker planking made it difficult to cut ports in the hull; clinker-built (or clench-built) ships had much of their structural strength in the outer hull. The solution was the gradual adoption of carvel-built ships that relied on an internal skeleton structure to bear the weight of the ship. The development of propulsion during the 15th century from single-masted, square-rigged cogs to three-masted carracks with a mix of square and lateen sails made ships nimbler and easier to maneuver.

Gunports cut in the hull of ships were introduced, according to tradition, in 1501 by Breton shipwright called Descharges, but it is just as likely to have been a gradual adaptation of loading ports in the stern of merchant vessels that had already been in use for centuries. Initially, the gunports were used to mount heavy stern chasers pointing aft, but soon gun ports migrated to the sides of ships. This made possible coordinated volleys from all the guns on one side of a ship for the first time in history, at least in theory. Guns in the 16th century were considered to be in fixed positions and were intended to be fired independently rather than in concerted volleys. It was not until the 1590s that the word &quot;broadside&quot; in English was commonly used to refer to gunfire from the side of a ship rather than the ship&#x27;s side itself.

The main batteries in 20th century battleships tended to be powered gun turrets which could swivel 180 degrees or more to establish wider firing arcs around the entire vessel. Although this could allow at least some of the main guns to be focused directly forward or aft, battleships still relied on broadsides for maximum firepower, as structures such as the bridge tower in the middle of a battleship would prevent guns in the aft portion of the ship from firing forward, and vice versa. Additionally, directing the guns to the port or starboard side projected the massive muzzle blast out over the ocean, while firing the guns too close to the deck could cause damage to the ship.

==Measurement of firepower capacity==

When the term is used in this way, it can be calculated by multiplying the shell weight of the ship&#x27;s main armament shells times the number of barrels that can be brought to bear. If some turrets are incapable of firing to either side of the vessel, only the maximum number of barrels which can fire to one side or the other are counted. For example, the American &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships carried a main armament of nine main guns in turrets which could all be trained to a single broadside. Each 16-inch shell weighed , which when multiplied by nine (the total number of barrels in all three turrets) equals a total of 24,300 pounds (11,022 kg). Thus, an &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleship had a broadside of 12 short tons (11.0 tonnes), the weight of shells that she could theoretically land on a target in a single firing.

See list of broadsides of major World War II ships for a comparison.

<doc id="158125" wikidata="Q102410" url="?curid=158125" title="Knoppix">
<text>Knoppix, stylized KNOPPIX ( ), is an operating system based on Debian designed to be run directly from a CD or DVD (Live CD) or a USB flash drive (Live USB). It was first released in 2000 by German Linux consultant Klaus Knopper, and was one of the first popular live distributions. Knoppix is loaded from the removable medium and decompressed into a RAM drive. The decompression is transparent and on-the-fly.

There are two main editions, available in both English and German: the traditional compact-disc (700 megabytes) edition and the DVD (4.7 gigabytes) &quot;Maxi&quot; edition.

Knoppix mostly consists of free and open source software, but also includes some proprietary software, as long as it fulfills certain conditions. Knoppix can be used to copy files easily from hard drives with inaccessible operating systems. To quickly and more safely use Linux software, the Live CD can be used instead of installing another OS.

== Contents ==

More than 1000 software packages are included on the CD edition, and more than 2600 packages are included on the DVD edition. Up to nine gigabytes can be stored on the DVD in compressed form. These packages include:

* LXDE, a lightweight X11 desktop environment; default since Knoppix 6.0 and later
* MPlayer, with MP3 audio, and Ogg Vorbis audio playback support
* Internet access software, including the KPPP dialer and ISDN utilities
* The Mozilla Firefox web browser
* The Mozilla Thunderbird e-mail client
* GIMP, an image manipulation program
* Tools for data rescue and system repair
* Network analysis and administration tools
* LibreOffice, a comprehensive office suite
* Terminal server

== Hardware requirements ==
Minimum hardware requirements for Knoppix:

* Intel/AMD-compatible processor (i486 or later)
* Minimum RAM memory requirements:
**32 MB for text mode;
**Live environment with no swap:
***512MB for graphics mode with just LXDE
***1GB to use the web browser and productivity software
***2GB recommended
* Bootable optical drive:
** DVD-ROM for current versions;
** CD-ROM for version 7.2 and older, or a boot floppy and standard CD-ROM (IDE/ATAPI or SCSI)
* Standard SVGA-compatible graphics card
* Serial or PS/2 standard mouse, or an IMPS/2-compatible USB-mouse.

== Saving changes in the environment ==
Prior to Knoppix 3.8.2, any documents or settings a user created would disappear upon reboot. This lack of persistence then made it necessary to save documents directly to a hard drive partition, over the network, or to some removable media, such as a USB flash drive.

It was also possible to set up a &quot;persistent home directory&quot;, where any documents or settings written to the user&#x27;s home directory would automatically be redirected to a hard drive or removable media, which could be automatically mounted on bootup. A single file, &quot;knoppix.img&quot;, was cached on the rewritable media and used to simulate a file system into which files were written for later use. This allowed the user to transparently write to their home directory.

Union mount support was added in version 3.8.1 through UnionFS. This was later replaced by Aufs in 5.1.0 to improve stability. The union mount allowed virtual updates to the data on the read-only CD/DVD media by storing changes on separate writable media and then representing the combination of the two as single storage device. The writable media could be memory (ramdisk), a hard disk, USB flash drive, etc. This means that the user could modify the software installed on the Knoppix system, such as by using APT to install or update software. The storage device containing the changes needed to be present whenever Knoppix is started, else only the original data from the disc would be used. While Knoppix would scan available storage devices for a persistent home directory by default, a user could dictate a specific location with a boot option (see below) such as:

codice_1

By carrying a Knoppix CD and a USB flash drive, a user could have the same environment, programs, settings, and data available on any computer that could run Knoppix.

This functionality was only available through Knoppix 5.1.1 (CD release) or 5.3.1 (DVD release). Subsequently, the Live CD paradigm has transformed into portable operating systems that run on external storage.

== Boot options ==
When using Knoppix as a Live CD, one can use boot options, also known as &quot;cheatcodes&quot;, to override a default setting or automatic hardware detection when it fails. For example, the user may wish to boot into a plain console, or proceed without SCSI support. For this, Knoppix allows the user to enter one or more cheat codes at the prompt before booting. If the user does not enter a cheat code, or does not press any key before the timeout, Knoppix will boot with its default options. For example, to set the language to French rather than the default, one would type:

codice_2

Knoppix is a 32-bit Debian Linux based distro, but recent releases (including the latest version 7.6) have also been equipped with a 64-bit kernel on the DVD edition, where it will automatically boot up for 64-bit computers, or by using the boot option codice_3 manually in the command-line prompt, while codice_4 will boot up the 32-bit kernel. Neither PAE nor 64-bit applications are supported by Knoppix, and more than 4GB of system memory can only be used with a 64-bit kernel.

The DVD edition of Knoppix can also be loaded onto a USB flash drive, with &quot;flash-knoppix&quot; under the Knoppix system, such that &quot;the KNOPPIX Live System starts and runs about factor 5 faster from USB flash disk than from CD or DVD!&quot;. Besides that, the experimental UEFI support is provided for USB flash drive rather than DVD media. 32-bit UEFI firmware can only boot up the 32-bit kernel, while 64-bit UEFI firmware can only boot up the 64-bit kernel. The text interface for UEFI is similar with it for BIOS, one can also press key F2 and F3 to access information on boot options.

== Popularity ==
Knoppix was one of the first Live CD Linux distributions to gain popularity (just after Yggdrasil Linux). There are several factors that contribute to the popularity of Knoppix:

* Knoppix was one of the first Live CDs available, and is known as the &quot;original&quot; Debian-based Live CD
* Its extensive hardware detection allows most systems to start Knoppix without any configuration
* Its ability to automatically connect to most kinds of networks
* Its utilities for system repair and troubleshooting

Knoppix works on a fairly large number of PCs or laptops, but not all. The automatic hardware detection cannot cope with all hardware, and sometimes the drivers used will not be optimal. Knoppix has difficulty recognizing some cards made before 1998, or motherboards with a BIOS made before 2002. (In some cases, manual configuration with codes entered at boot time can overcome problems with automatic detection.)

If a PC does not have enough RAM to run KDE and other included programs, the legacy Knoppix (earlier than 6.0) boots up a very limited Tab Window Manager (twm) session instead. The only window running in the twm session by default is xterm.

== Versions ==

The table (to the right) shows the version history of major releases.

===Knoppix 4.x–5.x===
As of April 2008, from version 4 up until 5.1.1, Knoppix has been split into a DVD &quot;maxi&quot; edition (with over 9 GB of software), and a CD &quot;light&quot; edition; both were developed in parallel.

Up until Knoppix 5.1.1, the CD editions contained a selection of graphical environments, including the TWM window manager, and KDE 3 — a feature-complete desktop environment default in Knoppix 5.3.1 and earlier.

No further development is being done on the traditional 5.x versions.

===Knoppix 6.x===
KNOPPIX 6.0.1 / ADRIANE 1.1 is a CD-edition again, and a complete rebuild from scratch. LXDE was made the default desktop environment, and the edition contains a substantially reduced software collection in order to easily fit on a CD.

The KNOPPIX 6.2.1 release has both CD and DVD editions, and ADRIANE 1.2 only has a CD-edition.

Knoppix 6.7.1 has the last CD version with stable touchpad drivers.

===Knoppix 7.x===
From June 2013 on until March 2019, Knoppix 7.2 was the most recent release with a CD edition. By 2018, its software had become very outdated, as the libc6 2.17 library no longer suffices for installation of several modern packages. The 7.x version range is known for instabilities with touchpads.

Version 7.2 still remains the most recent CD version of Knoppix in wide distribution.

===Knoppix 8.x===
The KNOPPIX 8.0.0 edition was released at CeBIT 2017.

KNOPPIX 8.1.0 was released in September 2017 as the first public release in the 8.x series.
The version 8.0.0 has the dual boot, and a choice between three different desktops:LXDE as default option, KDE or GNOME.

Versions 8.2.0 and newer (8.2.x, not 8.5.x) are available on Knoppix mirrors.

Knoppix 8.5 was a DVD version that was not available for download, but was published as an exclusive version only bundled with a physical edition of Linux-Magazin or LinuxUser. Version 8.5 no longer includes Systemd, which was replaced by elogind. Spectre and Meltdown kernel vulnerabilities have been mitigated.

Knoppix 8.6 (and newer) is a DVD version available for download on Knoppix mirrors.

=== Knoppix 9.x ===
== Derivatives ==

=== Adriane Knoppix ===
Adriane Knoppix is a variation that is intended for blind and visually impaired people, which can be used entirely without vision oriented output devices. It was released in the third quarter of 2007 as a Live CD. &quot;Adriane Knoppix&quot; is named after Adriane Knopper, the wife of Klaus Knopper, the developer of Knoppix. Adriane has a visual impairment, and has been assisting Klaus with the development of the software. The name Adriane is also a backronym for &quot;Audio Desktop Reference Implementation And Networking Environment&quot;.

Adriane Knoppix is intended not only for the blind but also for beginners who do not know much about computers. It uses the SUSE Blinux screen reader with a phoneme generator and speech engine for normal output.

=== Other variations ===

* Kali Linux, a live CD/USB distribution now based on Debian. It is a rewrite of BackTrack, which was based on Knoppix. Like its predecessors, Kali is designed for digital forensics and penetration testing. BackTrack itself merged the Auditor Security Collection and WHAX distros.
* Kanotix, a live distribution now based on Debian.
* KnoppMyth, a distro that attempts to make the Linux and MythTV installation as trivial as possible.
* Musix GNU+Linux, specifically for musicians.
* Poseidon Linux, a widely acclaimed distribution specifically geared for the scientific community.
* KnoppiXMAME, designed for playing MAME videogames
* PelicanHPC for clustering
* TechUSB, an automated computer distro produced by RepairTech, Inc.

<doc id="158128" wikidata="Q717004" url="?curid=158128" title="Battle of Leyte">
<text>The Battle of Leyte (; ; ) in the Pacific campaign of World War II was the amphibious invasion of the island of Leyte in the Philippines by American forces and Filipino guerrillas under the overall command of General Douglas MacArthur, who fought against the Imperial Japanese Army in the Philippines led by General Tomoyuki Yamashita. The operation, codenamed &quot;King Two&quot;, launched the Philippines campaign of 1944–45 for the recapture and liberation of the entire Philippine Archipelago and to end almost three years of Japanese occupation.

==Background==
Japan had conquered the Philippines in 1942. Controlling it was vital for Japan&#x27;s survival in World War II because it commanded sea routes to Borneo and Sumatra by which rubber and petroleum were shipped to Japan.

For the U.S., capturing the Philippines was a key strategic step in isolating Imperial Japan&#x27;s military holdings in China and the Pacific theater. It was also a personal matter of pride for MacArthur. In 1942, just a month before Japan forced the surrender of all USAFFE forces in the Philippines, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt had ordered MacArthur to leave the Philippines and organize the U.S. forces gathering in Australia, which were meant to relieve the USAFFE. Those relief forces were non-existent; Roosevelt&#x27;s true intentions in ordering MacArthur to flee the Philippines had been to prevent his capture by the Japanese. Still, MacArthur had vowed that he would return to the Philippines. He repeatedly stated that it was a moral obligation of the U.S. to liberate the Philippines as soon as possible. In March 1944, the Joint Chiefs of Staff ordered MacArthur to plan an attack on the southern Philippines by the end of the year, and Luzon in early 1945. In July 1944, Roosevelt met with MacArthur and Chester Nimitz in Hawaii, where the decision was made to invade the Philippines, from which land air bases could be used for the Pacific Theater of Operations.

Over the summer of 1944, planes from the aircraft carriers of the U.S. 3rd Fleet under Admiral William F. Halsey carried out several successful missions over the Philippines and found Japanese resistance lacking. Halsey then recommended a direct strike on Leyte, canceling other planned operations, and the Leyte invasion date moved forward to October.

Leyte, one of the larger islands of the Philippines, has numerous deep-water approaches and sandy beaches which offered opportunities for amphibious assaults and fast resupply. The roads and lowlands extending inland from Highway 1, that ran for along the east coast between Abuyog town to the north and the San Juanico Strait between Leyte and Samar Islands, provided avenues for tank-infantry operations, as well as suitable ground for airfield construction. American air forces based on Leyte could strike at enemy bases and airfields anywhere in the archipelago.

A heavily forested north–south mountain range dominates the interior and separates two sizable valleys, or coastal plains. The larger Leyte Valley extends from the northern coast to the long eastern shore and contains most of the towns and roadways on the island. The other, Ormoc Valley, situated on the west side, was connected to Leyte Valley by a roundabout and winding road, Highway 2; it ran from Palo town on the east coast, then west and northwest through Leyte Valley to the north coast, it then turned south and wound through a mountainous neck to enter the northern Ormoc Valley. This continued south to the port of Ormoc City, then along the western shore to Baybay town. The road then turned east to cross the mountainous waist of the island and it connected with Highway 1 on the east coast at Abuyog. Below these towns, the mountainous southern third of Leyte was mostly undeveloped. High mountain peaks over , as well as the jagged outcroppings, ravines, and caves typical of volcanic islands offered formidable defensive opportunities. The timing late in the year of the assault would force combat troops and supporting pilots, as well as logistical units, to contend with monsoon rains.

Leyte&#x27;s population of over 900,000 people—mostly farmers and fishermen—could be expected to assist an American invasion, since many residents already supported the guerrilla struggle against the Japanese in the face of harsh repression. Japanese troop strength on Leyte was estimated by U.S. intelligence at 20,000; mostly of the 16th Division under Lieutenant General Shiro Makino.

==Battle==

===Landings===
Preliminary operations for the Leyte invasion began at dawn on 17 October 1944, with minesweeping tasks and the movement of the 6th Rangers toward three small islands in Leyte Gulf. Although delayed by a storm, the Rangers were on Suluan and Dinagat islands by 0805. On Suluan, they dispersed a small group of Japanese defenders and destroyed a radio station, while they found Dinagat unoccupied. The third island, Homonhon, was taken without any opposition the next day. On Dinagat and Homonhon, the Rangers proceeded to erect navigation lights for the amphibious transports to follow. Meanwhile, reconnaissance by underwater demolition teams revealed clear landing beaches for assault troops on Leyte. Independently, the 21st Infantry Regiment on 20 October landed on Panaon Strait to control the entrance to Sogod Bay.

Following four hours of heavy naval gunfire on A-day, 20 October, Sixth Army forces landed on assigned beaches at 10:00. X Corps pushed across a stretch of beach between Tacloban airfield and the Palo River. to the south, XXIV Corps units came ashore across a strand between San José and the Daguitan River. Troops found as much resistance from swampy terrain as from Japanese fire. Within an hour of landing, units in most sectors had secured beachheads deep enough to receive heavy vehicles and large amounts of supplies. Only in the 24th Division sector did enemy fire force a diversion of follow-up landing craft. But even that sector was secure enough by 13:30 to allow Gen. MacArthur to make a dramatic entrance through the surf onto Red Beach and announce to the populace the beginning of their liberation: &quot;People of the Philippines, I have returned! By the grace of Almighty God, our forces stand again on Philippine soil.&quot;

By the end of A-day, the Sixth Army had moved inland and five miles wide. In the X Corps sector, the 1st Cavalry Division held Tacloban airfield, and the 24th Infantry Division had taken the high ground on Hill 522 commanding its beachheads. In the XXIV Corps sector, the 96th Infantry Division held the approaches to Catmon Hill, and the 7th Infantry Division held Dulag and its airfield.

General Makino spent the day moving his command post from Tacloban, inland to the town of Dagami. The initial fighting was won at a cost of 49 killed, 192 wounded, and six missing. The Japanese counterattacked the 24th Infantry Division on Red Beach through the night, unsuccessfully.

===Campaign in the Leyte Valley===
The Sixth Army made steady progress inland against sporadic and uncoordinated enemy resistance on Leyte in the next few days. The 1st Cavalry Division of Maj. Gen. Verne D. Mudge secured the provincial capital, Tacloban, on 21 October, and Hill 215 the next. On 23 October, Gen. MacArthur presided over a ceremony to restore civil government to Leyte. 1st and 2nd Cavalry Brigades initiated a holding action to prevent a Japanese counterattack from the mountainous interior, after which the 1st Cavalry was allowed to move on. The 8th Cavalry established itself on Samar by 24 Oct, securing the San Juanico Strait.
On the X Corps left, the 24th Infantry Division under Maj. Gen. Frederick A. Irving, drove inland into heavy enemy resistance. After days and nights of hard fighting and killing some 800 Japanese, the 19th and 34th Infantry Regiments expanded their beachhead and took control of the high ground commanding the entrance to the northern Leyte Valley. By 1 November, after a seven-day tank-infantry advance supported by artillery fire, both regiments had pushed through Leyte Valley and were within sight of the north coast and the port of Carigara, which the 2nd Cavalry Brigade occupied the next day after Suzuki ordered a withdrawal. In its drive through Leyte Valley, the 24th Division inflicted nearly 3,000 enemy casualties. These advances left only one major port on Leyte—Ormoc City on the west coast—under Japanese control.
From the XXIV Corps beachhead Gen. Hodge had sent his two divisions into the southern Leyte Valley, which already contained four airfields and a large supply center. Maj. Gen. James L. Bradley&#x27;s 96th Infantry Division was to clear Catmon Hill, a promontory, the highest point in both corps beachheads, and used by the Japanese as an observation and firing post to fire on landing craft approaching the beach on A-day. Under cover of incessant artillery and naval gunfire, Bradley&#x27;s troops made their way through the swamps south and west of the high ground at Labiranan Head. After a three-day fight, the 382nd Infantry Regiment took a key Japanese supply base at Tabontabon, inland, and killed some 350 Japanese on 28 October. Simultaneously two battalions each from the 381st Infantry Regiment and 383rd Infantry Regiments slowly advanced up opposite sides of Catmon Hill and battled the fierce Japanese resistance. When the mop-up of Catmon Hill was completed on 31 October, the Americans had cleared 53 pillboxes, 17 caves, and several heavy artillery positions.
On the left of XXIV Corps, the 7th Infantry Division under Maj. Gen. Archibald V. Arnold moved inland against the Japanese airfields of San Pablo 1 and 2, Bayug, and Buri, using &quot;flying wedges&quot; of American tanks, the 767th Tank Battalion, which cleared the way for the infantrymen. Between Burauen and Julita, the 17th Infantry overcame fanatical but futile resistance from Japanese soldiers concealed in spider holes, who placed satchel charges on the hulls of the American tanks. A mile north, 32nd Infantry soldiers killed more than 400 Japanese at Buri airfield. While two battalions of the 184th Infantry patrolled the corps&#x27; left flank, the 17th Infantry, with the 184th&#x27;s 2nd Battalion attached, turned north toward Dagami, above Burauen. Using flamethrowers to root the enemy out of pillboxes and a cemetery, US troops captured Dagami on 30 October, which forced Gen. Makino to evacuate his command post further westward. Meanwhile, on 29 October, the 32nd Infantry&#x27;s 2nd Battalion, preceded by the 7th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop, moved south along the east coast to Abuyog for a probe of the area, and then over the next four days patrolled west through the mountains to Baybay, all without opposition.

===Japanese counterattacks===
With 432,000 Japanese soldiers in the Philippines, General Yamashita decided to make Leyte the main effort of the Japanese defense, and on 21 October, ordered the 35th Army to coordinate a decisive battle with the Imperial Japanese Navy. The 16th Division was to be reinforced by the 30th Infantry Division from Mindanao, landing on Ormoc Bay. The 102nd Infantry Division would occupy Jaro, where the 1st and 26th Infantry Divisions were concentrating. Battalions from the 55th and 57th Independent Mixed Brigades were on Leyte by 25 Oct.

As the Sixth Army pushed deeper into Leyte, the Japanese struck back in the air and at sea. On 24 October, some 200 enemy aircraft approached American beachheads and shipping from the north. Fifty American land-based aircraft rose to intercept them, and claimed to have shot down between 66 and 84 of the attackers. Day and night air raids continued over the next four days, damaging supply dumps ashore and threatening American shipping. But by 28 October, counterattacks by US aircraft on Japanese airfields and shipping on other islands so reduced enemy air strength that conventional air raids ceased to be a major threat. As their air strength diminished, the Japanese resorted to the deadly &quot;kamikazes&quot;, a corps of suicide pilots who crashed their bomb-laden planes directly into US ships. They chose the large American transport and escort fleet that had gathered in Leyte Gulf on A-day as their first target and sank one escort carrier, the USS &quot;St. Lo&quot;, on 25 October 1944 and badly damaged many other vessels. This was the first instance of a major warship to be sunk by kamikaze attack.
A more serious danger to the US forces developed at sea. The Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s high command decided to destroy US Navy forces supporting the Sixth Army by committing its entire remaining surface fleet to a decisive battle with the Americans. The Imperial Navy&#x27;s plan was to attack in three major task groups. One, which included four aircraft carriers with few aircraft aboard, was to act as a decoy, luring the US 3rd Fleet north away from Leyte Gulf. 
On 23 October, the approach of the enemy surface vessels was detected. US naval units moved out to intercept, and the air and naval Battle of Leyte Gulf—the largest naval battle in the Pacific and also one of the largest naval battles in history—was fought from 23 to 26 October—the Japanese suffered a decisive defeat. Nonetheless, by 11 December, the Japanese had succeeded in moving more than 34,000 troops to Leyte and over of materiél, most through the port of Ormoc on the west coast, despite heavy losses to reinforcement convoys, including engagements at Ormoc Bay, because of relentless air interdiction missions by US aircraft.

===Advance towards the Ormoc Valley===
The Japanese reinforcement presented severe problems for both Krueger and MacArthur. Instead of projected mopping up operations after clearing the east side of Leyte, the Sixth Army had to prepare for extended combat in the mountains on its western side. 

Gen. Krueger planned a giant pincer operation to clear Ormoc Vally, with X Corps forces moving south, and XXIV Corps units pushing north from Baybay. To overcome the expected increased resistance, especially in the mountain barrier to the north, Krueger mobilized his reserve forces, the 32nd and 77th Infantry Divisions, while MacArthur activated the 11th Airborne Division. The 21st RCT pulled out from the Panaon area to rejoin the 24th Division and were replaced by a battalion of the 32nd Infantry. On 3 November, the 34th Infantry Regiment moved out from west of Carigara to sweep the rest of the northern coast before turning south into the mountains. The 1st Battalion soon came under attack from a ridge along the highway. Supported by the 63rd Field Artillery Battalion, the unit cleared the ridge, and the 34th Infantry continued unopposed that night through the town of Pinamopoan, recovering numerous heavy weapons abandoned by the enemy, then halted at the point where Highway 2 turns south into the mountains.

===Battles of Breakneck and Kilay Ridges===
On the 7th of November the 21 Infantry went into its first sustained combat on Leyte when it moved into the mountains along Highway 2, near Carigara Bay. The fresh regiment, with the 19th Infantry&#x27;s 3rd Battalion attached, immediately ran into strong defenses of the newly arrived Japanese 1st Division, aligned from east to west across the road and anchored on a network of fighting positions built of heavy logs and interconnecting trench lines and countless spider holes, which became known as &quot;Breakneck Ridge&quot; to the Americans, or the &quot;Yamashita Line&quot; to the Japanese. General Krueger ordered the 1st Cavalry to join the 24th Infantry Division in the attack south, and the X and XXIV Corps (96th Infantry Division) to block routes through the central mountain range, anticipating General Suzuki&#x27;s renewed attack with the arrival of his 26th Infantry Division. Additionally the XXIV Corps had the 7th Infantry Division in Baybay. Plus, Krueger had access to the 32nd and 77th Infantry Divisions, and the 11th Airborne Division, which MacArthur was staging in Leyte in preparation of the Luzon invasion.

A typhoon began on 8 November, and the heavy rain that followed for several days further impeded American progress. Despite the storm and high winds, which added falling trees and mud slides to enemy defenses and delayed supply trains, the 21st Infantry continued its slow and halting attack, with companies often having to withdraw and recapture hills that had been taken earlier. The Americans seized the approaches to Hill 1525 to the east, enabling Irving to stretch out the enemy defenses further across a front along Highway 2. 

On the east, the 19th Infantry&#x27;s 2nd Battalion, under Lt. Col. Robert B. Spragins, swung east around Hill 1525 behind the enemy right flank, cutting back to Highway 2, south of &#x27;Breakneck Ridge&#x27;, blocking the Japanese supply line. On the west, Irving sent the 34th Infantry&#x27;s 1st Battalion under Lt. Col. Thomas E. Clifford, over water from the Carigara area to a point west of the southward turn of Highway 2, and moved it inland. This amphibious maneuver was made in eighteen LVTs of the 727th Amphibian Tractor Battalion. After crossing a ridge line and the Leyte River, they approached the enemy left flank at on Kilay Ridge, the highest terrain behind the main battle area. Both battalions reached positions only about apart on opposite sides of the highway by 13 November despite strong opposition and heavy rains. The Americans were aided by the 1st Battalion, 96th Philippine Infantry, a local guide who &quot;owned&quot; Kilay Ridge, and Filipinos carrying supplies.
It took Clifford&#x27;s men two weeks of struggle through mud and rain—often dangerously close to friendly mortar and artillery fire—to root the Japanese out of fighting positions on the way up Kilay Ridge. On 2 December Clifford&#x27;s battalion finally cleared the heights overlooking the road, and 32nd Division units quickly took over. Clifford&#x27;s outfit suffered 26 killed, 101 wounded and two missing, in contrast to 900 Japanese dead. For their arduous efforts against Kilay Ridge and adjacent areas, both flanking battalions received Presidential Unit Citations. Clifford and Spragins both received the Distinguished Service Cross for their actions. It was not until 14 December that the 32nd Division finally cleared the Breakneck–Kilay Ridge area, and linked up with the 1st Cavalry Division on 19 Dec, placing the most heavily defended portions of Highway 2 between Carigara Bay and the Ormoc Valley under X Corps control.

Throughout this phase, American efforts had become increasingly hampered by logistical problems. Mountainous terrain and impassable roads forced Sixth Army transportation units to improvise resupply trains of Navy landing craft, tracked landing vehicles, airdrops, artillery tractors, trucks, even carabaos and hundreds of barefoot Filipino bearers. The 727th Amphibian Tractor Battalion made daily, often multiple, trips with ammunition and rations between Capoocan and Calubian. From Calubian, the 727th tractors would navigate the Naga River to Consuegra and then traverse overland to Agahang. On their return trip, they would evacuate the casualties. 

===Battle of Shoestring Ridge===

In mid-November XXIV Corps had the 32nd Infantry Regiment, under the command of Lt. Col. John M. Finn in western Leyte, and 7th Division remnants securing Burauen, but the arrival of the 11th Airborne Division on 22 November allowed Gen. Hodge to move the rest of the 7th Division to the west. On the night of 23 November the 32nd Infantry suddenly came under attack by the Japanese 26th Division along the Palanas River. The regiment&#x27;s 2nd Battalion was pushed back off Hill 918 to a defensive position along the highway together with their artillery base, which consisted of Batteries A and B of the 49th Field Artillery Battalion and Battery B of the USMC 11th 155mm Gun Battalion. Gen. Arnold earlier had placed the 2nd Battalion, 184th Infantry, as a reserve for just such a counterattack. Also, a platoon of tanks from the 767th Tank Battalion was stationed at Damulaan. Battery C, 57th Field Artillery Battalion, arrived the next day. That night, the night of 24 November, Japanese attacks put four pieces of Battery B out of action. The 2nd Battalion, 184th Infantry was then released by Gen. Arnold to Col. Finn. The defensive battle for &#x27;Shoestring Ridge&#x27;, so named to reflect the supply situation, continued until 29 November, when US troops were able to take the offensive. During their failed attacks of the previous days, the Japanese under the command of Col. Saito had committed six infantry battalions.

===Battle of the Ridges===
Gen. Arnold finally began his advance toward Ormoc with a novel tactic. On the night of 4 December, vehicles of the 776th Amphibian Tank Battalion put to sea and leapfrogged south along the Leyte coast and positioned themselves west of Balogo. On 5 Dec, the tanks moved to within of the shore and fired into the hills in front of the advancing 17th and 184th Infantry. This tactic proved effective, greatly disorganizing the defenders, except where ground troops encountered enemy pockets on reverse slopes inland, shielded from the offshore tank fire. The 7th Division pushed north with two regiments which encountered heavy enemy fire coming from Hill 918, from which the entire coast to Ormoc City could be observed. By 8 Dec, the American forces had taken Hills 918, 380 and 606, plus the surrounding ridges. By 12 December, Gen. Arnold&#x27;s lead battalion was less than south of Ormoc City.

===Battle of the Airfields===
While Gen. Arnold moved closer to Ormoc, on 6 December, the Japanese made a surprise attack on the Buri Airfield with the 16th, combined with 250 paratroopers of the 2nd Raiding Brigade, the &quot;Takachiho Paratroopers&quot;. At the time, the 11th Airborne Division, commanded by General Joseph May Swing defended the Burauen area. The Japanese aimed to recapture eastern Leyte airstrips and use them for their own planes. Descending Japanese paratroopers were &quot;cut to shreds by the antiaircraft and field artillery units,&quot; according to one American artillery officer.

Although poorly coordinated—only one battalion of the Japanese 26th Infantry Division reached the battlefield—the enemy attack yielded the seizure of some abandoned weapons which they managed to use against the Americans over the next four days. The 11th Airborne Division, supported by the 149th Infantry, 38th Infantry Division, and the 382nd Infantry, 96th Infantry Division, plus hastily mustered groups of support and service troops, eventually contained the attack, and turned the tide by 9 Dec. With a few American supply dumps and aircraft on the ground destroyed and construction projects delayed, the enemy attacks on the airfields failed to have any effect on the overall Leyte Campaign. Gen. Suzuki ordered a retreat so he could deal with the American landing at Ormoc, but with only 200 men returning, the 16th Division ceased to exist.
===Fall of Ormoc===
Meanwhile, on the western side of Leyte, the US XXIV Corps received reinforcements on 7 December with the landing of the 77th Infantry Division under Maj. Gen. Andrew D. Bruce south of Ormoc City. The 77th Division&#x27;s 305th and 307th Infantry Regiments came ashore at 0700 unopposed, supported by a company from the 776th Amphibian Tank Battalion. However, Admiral Arthur D. Storable&#x27;s naval convoy was subjected to &quot;kamikaze&quot; air attacks, fifty-five aircraft making sixteen raids. Yet, the arrival of the 77th Division proved decisive. This enabled the 7th Division to resume its march north, and Japanese defenders were quickly squeezed between them.

Moving north, the 77th Division faced strong opposition at Camp Downes, a prewar Philippine constabulary post. Supported by the newly arrived 306th Infantry Regiment, plus the 902nd and 305th Field Artillery Battalions, Gen. Bruce&#x27;s troops pushed through and beyond Camp Downes on 9 Dec, and entered Ormoc City on 10 December. The 7th and 77th Infantry Divisions linked up the next day.

In its final drive, US troops killed some 1,506 Japanese troops and took seven prisoners while sustaining 123 killed, 329 wounded and 13 missing. With Ormoc City captured, the XXIV Corps and X Corps were only apart. In between at Cogan, the last Japanese salient with its defenses anchored on a concrete blockhouse, north of Ormoc, and held by the 12th Independent Infantry Regiment, resisted the Americans for two days. On 14 December, the 305th Infantry closed on the stronghold, aided by heavy artillery barrages and employing flamethrowers and armored bulldozers. Hand-to-hand combat and the inspiring leadership of Medal of Honor awardee Captain Robert B. Nett cleared the Japanese from the blockhouse area, while the leading Company, E, of the 2nd Battalion, 305th Infantry moved forward through intense fire and killed several Japanese soldiers.

===Westward march to the coast===
After breaking out of Ormoc, the 77th Division took Valencia airfield, north, on 18 December, and continued north to establish contact with X Corps units. That same day, Gen. Sibert ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to complete the drive south. The 12th Cavalry Regiment pushed out of the mountains on a southwest track to Highway 2, then followed fire from the 271st Field Artillery Battalion to clear a stretch of the road. North of Ormoc Valley, the 32nd Division had met determined opposition from the defending Japanese 1st Division along Highway 2, after moving south past Kilay Ridge and entering a heavy rain forest, which limited visibility and concealed the enemy. Using flamethrowers, hand grenades, rifles, and bayonets, troops scratched out daily advances measured in yards, and in five days of hard fighting, the 126th and 127th Infantry Regiments advanced less than . Contact between patrols of the 12th Cavalry and the 77th Division&#x27;s 306th Infantry on 21 December marked the juncture of the US X and XXIV Corps and the closing of the Sixth Army&#x27;s pincer maneuver against Ormoc Valley.

While the 77th and 32nd Divisions converged on the valley, Maj. Gen. Joseph M. Swing&#x27;s 11th Airborne Division had moved into the central mountain passes from the east. With blocking positions established south of Leyte Valley on 22–24 November, the 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment pushed farther west into the mountains on the 25 November. After an arduous advance, the 511th reached Mahonag, west of Burauen, on 6 December, the same day Japanese paratroops landed at the Buri and San Pablo airfields. On 16 December, the 2nd Battalion, 32nd Infantry, made slow but steady progress into the mountains from the Ormoc Bay area to meet the airborne regiment and assist its passage westward. On 23 December, after battling scattered Japanese defenders on ridges and in caves, the 7th Division infantrymen met troops from the 2nd Battalion, 187th Glider Infantry Regiment, which had passed through the 511th, to complete the cross-island move, and basically destroying the Japanese 26th Infantry Division in the process.

Gen. Bruce opened the drive on Palompon by sending the 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 305th Infantry, with armor support, west along the road on the morning of 22 December. The 302nd Engineer Battalion followed, repairing and strengthening bridges for armor, artillery and supply vehicles. Assault units progressed rapidly through sporadic enemy fire until they hit strong positions about short of Palompon. To restore momentum, Gen. Bruce put the 1st Battalion, 305th Infantry, on Navy landing craft and dispatched it from the port of Ormoc to Palompon. Supported by fire from mortar boats of the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade and from the guns of the 531st Field Artillery Battalion, the infantrymen landed at 07:20 on 25 December and secured the small coastal town within four hours.

Learning of the seizure of the last port open to the Japanese, Gen. MacArthur announced the end of organized resistance on Leyte. As these sweeps continued, he transferred control of operations on Leyte and Samar to the Eighth Army on 26 December. Farther north, other US forces made faster progress against more disorganized and dispirited enemy troops. 1st Cavalry Division troops reached the coast on 28 December as 24th Division units cleared the last enemy positions from the northwest corner of Leyte on the same day and two days later met patrols of the 32nd Division. 

==Aftermath==
The campaign for Leyte was the first operation in the American reconquest of the Philippines, and proved the most decisive. Japanese losses in the campaign were heavy; the army lost four divisions and several combat units, while the navy lost 26 major warships, 46 large transports and hundreds of merchant ships. The struggle also reduced Japanese land-based air capability in the Philippines by more than 50%. Some 250,000 troops still remained on Luzon, but the air and naval support lost during the battle for Leyte so narrowed Gen. Yamashita&#x27;s options that he now had to fight a passive defense of Luzon, the largest and most important island in the Philippines. In effect, once the battle of Leyte was lost, the Japanese gave up hope of retaining the Philippines, conceding to the Allies a critical bastion from which Japan could be easily cut off from outside resources, and from which assaults on the Japanese home islands could be launched.

==1998 claims of Japanese intelligence==
In 1998 it was claimed in Australia (see Royal Commission on Espionage) that Allied estimates of Japanese troop strengths including those on Leyte were given to Tokyo via the Soviet consulate in Harbin, Manchuria as Stalin wanted to delay an American victory over Japan until the Soviet Union could participate. MacArthur&#x27;s G-2 Willoughby had underestimated the numbers, and the troops were reinforced. The secret &quot;Ultra&quot; estimates were not available to the Soviets, but were given to them by members of Australian Foreign Minister Evatt’s staff.

<doc id="158130" wikidata="Q434839" url="?curid=158130" title="Edward Bernays">
<text>Edward Louis Bernays ( ; ; November 22, 1891 − March 9, 1995) was an American pioneer in the field of public relations and propaganda, and referred to in his obituary as &quot;the father of public relations&quot;. While credited with advancing the profession of public relations, his techniques have been criticized for manipulating public opinion, often in ways that undermined individual autonomy and democratic values.

His best-known campaigns include a 1929 effort to promote female smoking by branding cigarettes as feminist &quot;Torches of Freedom&quot;, and his work for the United Fruit Company in the 1950s, connected with the CIA-orchestrated overthrow of the democratically elected Guatemalan government in 1954. Critics argue that his involvement in Guatemala facilitated U.S. imperialism and contributed to decades of civil unrest and repression, raising ethical concerns about his role in undermining democratic governance.

He worked for dozens of major American corporations, including Procter &amp; Gamble and General Electric, and for government agencies, politicians, and nonprofit organizations. His uncle was psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud.

Of his many books, &quot;Crystallizing Public Opinion&quot; (1923) and &quot;Propaganda&quot; (1928) gained special attention as early efforts to define and theorize the field of public relations. Citing works of writers such as Gustave Le Bon, Wilfred Trotter, Walter Lippmann, and Sigmund Freud (his own ), he described the masses as irrational and subject to herd instinct—and he outlined how skilled practitioners could use crowd psychology and psychoanalysis to control them in desired ways. Bernays later synthesized many of these ideas in his postwar book, &quot;Public Relations&quot; (1945), which outlines the science of managing information released to the public by an organization, in a manner most advantageous to the organization. He does this by first providing an overview of the history of public relations, and then provides insight into its application.

Bernays was named one of the 100 most influential Americans of the twentieth century by &quot;Life&quot;. Despite this recognition, his work has been linked to the rise of modern propaganda techniques that some argue have eroded democratic engagement and suppressed dissent. He was the subject of a full-length biography by Larry Tye entitled &quot;The Father of Spin&quot; (1999) and later an award-winning 2002 documentary for the BBC by Adam Curtis entitled &quot;The Century of the Self&quot;.

==Family and education==
Edward Bernays was born in Vienna to a Jewish family. His mother, Anna (1858–1955), was Sigmund Freud&#x27;s sister, and his father Eli (1860–1921) was the brother of Freud&#x27;s wife, Martha Bernays; their grandfather, Isaac Bernays (through their father Berman), was the chief rabbi of Hamburg and a relative of the poet Heinrich Heine.

The Bernays family moved from Vienna to the United States in the 1890s. After Eli Bernays started working as a grain exporter at the Manhattan Produce Exchange, he sent for his wife and children. In 1892, his family moved to New York City, where Bernays attended DeWitt Clinton High School. In 1912 he graduated from Cornell University with a degree in agriculture, but chose journalism as his first career.

He married Doris E. Fleischman in 1922. Fleischman was a member of the Lucy Stone League, a group which encouraged women to keep their names after marriage.

Later, however, she changed her mind and her name, becoming Doris Bernays. By all accounts, Fleischman played a major though quiet role in the Bernays public relations business—including ghost-writing numerous memos and speeches, and publishing a newsletter.

==Career==
After graduating from Cornell, Bernays wrote for the &quot;National Nurseryman&quot; journal. Then he worked at the New York City Produce Exchange, where his father was a grain exporter. He went to Paris and worked for Louis Dreyfus and Company, reading grain cables. By December 1912, he had returned to New York.

===Medical editor===
Following a meeting in New York with school friend Fred Robinson, Bernays became coeditor of &quot;Medical Review of Reviews&quot; and &quot;Dietetic and Hygienic Gazette&quot; in 1912. They took editorial positions in favor of showers and against corsets, and distributed free copies to thousands of physicians across the country.

Two months later they took up the cause of &quot;Damaged Goods&quot;, an English translation of &quot;Les Avariés&quot; by Eugène Brieux. After publishing a positive review of the play, Bernays and Robinson wrote to its lead actor, Richard Bennett: &quot;The editors of the &quot;Medical Review of Reviews&quot; support your praiseworthy intention to fight sex-pruriency in the United States by producing Brieux&#x27;s play &quot;Damaged Goods&quot;. You can count on our help.&quot;

The play controversially dealt with venereal disease and prostitution—Bernays called it &quot;a propaganda play that fought for sex education.&quot; He created the &quot;&quot;Medical Review of Reviews&quot; Sociological Fund Committee&quot; and successfully solicited the support of such elite figures as John D. Rockefeller Jr., Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt, Reverend John Haynes Holmes, and Anne Harriman Sands Rutherford Vanderbilt, wife of William Kissam Vanderbilt.

===Press agent===
After his foray into the world of theater, Bernays worked as a creative press agent for various performers and performances. Already, he was using a variety of techniques that would become hallmarks of his later practice. He promoted the &quot;Daddy Long Legs&quot; stage play by tying it in with the cause of charity for orphans. To create interest in Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes, he educated Americans about the subtleties of ballet—and publicized a picture of Flore Revalles, wearing a tight-fitting dress, at the Bronx Zoo, posed with a large snake. He built up opera singer Enrico Caruso as an idol whose voice was so sensitive that comically extreme measures were taken to protect it.

===World War I===
After the US entered the war, the Committee on Public Information (CPI) hired Bernays to work for its Bureau of Latin-American Affairs, based in an office in New York. Bernays, along with Lieutenant F. E. Ackerman, focused on building support for war, domestically and abroad, focusing especially on businesses operating in Latin America. Bernays referred to this work as &quot;psychological warfare&quot;.

After fighting ended, Bernays was part of a sixteen-person publicity group working for the CPI at the Paris Peace Conference. A scandal arose from his reference to propaganda in a press release. As reported by the &quot;New York World&quot;, the &quot;announced object of the expedition is &#x27;to interpret the work of the Peace Conference by keeping up a worldwide propaganda to disseminate American accomplishments and ideals.&#x27;&quot;

Bernays later described a realization that his work for the CPI could also be used in peacetime:
===Counsel on public relations===
Bernays, who pursued his calling in New York City from 1919 to 1963, styled himself a &quot;public relations counsel&quot;. He had very pronounced views on the differences between what he did and what people in advertising did. A pivotal figure in the orchestration of elaborate corporate advertising campaigns and multi-media consumer spectacles, he is among those listed in the acknowledgments section of the seminal government social science study &quot;Recent Social Trends in the United States&quot; (1933).

== Notable clients and campaigns ==
Bernays used ideas of his uncle Sigmund Freud to help convince the public, among other things, that bacon and eggs was the true all-American breakfast.

In the 1930s, his Dixie Cup campaign was designed to convince American consumers that only disposable cups were sanitary, by linking the imagery of an overflowing cup with subliminal images of genitalia and venereal disease.

He was publicity director for the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair.

===Light&#x27;s Golden Jubilee===
===Political clients===
In 1924 Bernays set up a vaudeville &quot;pancake breakfast&quot; for Calvin Coolidge to change his stuffy image prior to the 1924 election. Entertainers including Al Jolson, Raymond Hitchcock, and the Dolly Sisters performed on the White House lawn. The event was widely reported by American newspapers, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; running the story under the headline &quot;President Nearly Laughs&quot;.

A desperate Herbert Hoover consulted with Bernays a month before the 1932 presidential election. Bernays advised Hoover to create disunity within his opposition and to present an image of him as an invincible leader.

Bernays advised William O&#x27;Dwyer, in his candidacy for mayor of New York City, on how to appear in front of different demographics. For example, he should tell Irish voters about his actions against the Italian mafia—and Italian voters about his plans to reform the police department. To Jews he should appear as a committed opponent of the Nazis.

He helped to name the President&#x27;s Emergency Committee for Employment, suggesting this name as preferable to the &quot;Committee for Unemployment&quot;.

During World War II, Bernays advised the Office of War Information, as well as the Army and Navy. He was chairman of the National Advisory Committee of the Third U.S. War Loan, co-chairman of the Victory Book campaign, and part of the New York State Defense Council. During the Cold War he advised the United States Information Agency.

Bernays reported turning down the Nazis, Nicaragua under the Somoza family, Francisco Franco, and Richard Nixon as clients.

===Nonprofit clients===
Bernays also worked on behalf of many nonprofit institutions and organizations. These included, to name just a few, the Committee on Publicity Methods in Social Work (1926–1927), the Jewish Mental Health Society (1928), the Book Publishers Research Institute (1930–1931), the New York Infirmary for Women and Children (1933), the Committee for Consumer Legislation (1934), and the Friends of Danish Freedom and Democracy (1940).

===Freud===
In 1920, Bernays organized the publication of Freud&#x27;s &quot;Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis&quot; in the U.S., sending royalty money to his uncle in Vienna. Freud turned down further offers at promotion, such as a possible lecture tour and an invitation to write 3,000-word newspaper columns, for $1,000 each, on topics such as &quot;The Wife&#x27;s Mental Place in the Home&quot; and &quot;What a Child Thinks About.&quot;

===Tobacco===
In 1927, Bernays worked briefly for Liggett and Myers, makers of Chesterfield cigarettes. He pulled a stunt against the competing brand, Lucky Strike, which involved mocking the endorsements of opera singers who said Lucky Strikes were &quot;kind to your voice&quot;. George Washington Hill, head of the American Tobacco Company, which made Lucky Strike, promptly hired Bernays away from Liggett and Myers.

When he started working for American Tobacco Company, Bernays was given the objective of increasing Lucky Strike sales among women, who, for the most part, had formerly avoided smoking. The first strategy was to persuade women to smoke cigarettes instead of eating. Bernays began by promoting the ideal of thinness itself, using photographers, artists, newspapers, and magazines to promote the special beauty of thin women. Medical authorities were found to promote the choice of cigarettes over sweets. Home-makers were cautioned that keeping cigarettes on hand was a social necessity.

====Torches of Freedom====
The first campaign succeeded; women smoked more cigarettes; American Tobacco Company brought in more revenue; and Lucky Strike led the market in growth. But a taboo remained on women smoking in public. Bernays consulted with psychoanalyst Abraham Brill, a student of Freud&#x27;s, who reported to him that cigarettes represented &quot;torches of freedom&quot; for women whose feminine desires were increasingly suppressed by their role in the modern world.

Bernays wrote:
The march went as planned, as did the ensuing publicity, with ripples of women smoking prominently across the country.

====Green Ball====
In 1934, Bernays was asked to deal with women&#x27;s apparent reluctance to buy Lucky Strikes because their green and red package clashed with standard female fashions. When Bernays suggested changing the package to a neutral color, Hill refused, saying that he had already spent millions advertising the package. Bernays then worked to make green a fashionable color.

The centerpiece of his efforts was the Green Ball, a social event at the Waldorf Astoria, hosted by Narcissa Cox Vanderlip. The pretext for the ball and its unnamed underwriter was that proceeds would go to charity. Famous society women would attend wearing green dresses. Manufacturers and retailers of clothing and accessories were advised of the excitement growing around the color green. Intellectuals were enlisted to give highbrow talks on the theme of green. Before the ball had taken place, newspapers and magazines (encouraged in various ways by Bernays&#x27;s office) had latched on to the idea that green was all the rage.

====Modus operandi====
Throughout the job, Bernays concealed the fact that he was working for the American Tobacco Company, and succeeded in keeping his own name out of the affair as well. Staff were instructed never to mention his name. Third parties were used, and various notable people received payments to promote smoking publicly as if on their own initiative. Decades later, however, Bernays boasted about his role.

Bernays did not smoke cigarettes himself, and persistently tried to induce his wife Doris to quit.

===United Fruit and Guatemala===
The United Fruit Company (today&#x27;s Chiquita Brands International) hired Bernays in the early 1940s for the purpose of promoting banana sales within the United States, which he did by linking bananas to good health and to American interests and by placing them strategically in the hands of celebrities, in hotels, and other conspicuous places. Bernays also argued that United Fruit needed to put a positive spin on the banana-growing countries themselves, and for this purpose created a front group called the Middle America Information Bureau, which supplied information to journalists and academics.

United Fruit shut down the Middle America Information Bureau in 1948 under the new presidency of Thomas Dudley Cabot. Bernays resented this change but stayed on with the company, for a reported annual fee of more than $100,000 (equivalent to nearly $1.27 million in 2023). Bernays worked on the national press and successfully drummed up coverage of Guatemala&#x27;s &#x27;Communist menace&#x27;.

He recommended a campaign in which universities, lawyers, and the U.S. government would all condemn expropriation as immoral and illegal; the company should use media pressure &quot;to induce the President and State Department to issue a policy pronouncement comparable to the Monroe Doctrine concerning expropriation.&quot; In the following months, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, and the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; had all published articles describing the threat of Communism in Guatemala. A Bernays memo in July 1951 recommended that this wave of media attention should be translated into action by promoting:

Per Bernays&#x27;s strategy, United Fruit distributed favorable articles and an anonymous &quot;Report on Guatemala&quot; to every member of Congress and to national &quot;opinion molders&quot;. They also published a weekly &quot;Guatemala Newsletter&quot; and sent it to 250 journalists, some of whom used it as a source for their reporting.
Bernays formed close relationships with journalists including &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter Will Lissner and columnist Walter Winchell. In January 1952 he brought a cohort of journalists from various notable newspapers on a tour of Guatemala, sponsored by the company. This technique proved highly effective and was repeated four more times.
In June, 1954, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency effected a coup d&#x27;état code-named Operation PBSuccess. The CIA backed a minimal military force, fronted by Carlos Castillo Armas, with a psychological warfare campaign to portray military defeat as a foregone conclusion. During the coup itself, Bernays was the primary supplier of information for the international newswires Associated Press, United Press International, and the International News Service.

Following the coup, Bernays built up the image of Guatemala&#x27;s new president Carlos Castillo Armas, giving advice for his public appearances both in Guatemala and in the U.S. In 1956, Bernays produced a pamphlet comparing the Communist way and the Christian way.

In 1959, United Fruit dispensed with all external advisors including Bernays.

==Techniques==
===Third parties===
Bernays argued that the covert use of third parties was morally legitimate because those parties were morally autonomous actors.

Describing the response to his campaign for Ivory Soap, Bernays wrote: &quot;As if actuated by the pressure of a button, people began working for the client instead of the client begging people to buy.&quot;

Businesses found these covert methods irresistible. Strother Walker and Paul Sklar wrote in &quot;Business Finds Its Voice&quot; (1938) that Bernays had offered a solution to popular skepticism of business which arose in the depression: better &quot;to implant an idea in a group leader&#x27;s mind and let him spread it than to write up an idea and send it to the papers as a release, in the old-fashioned way ...&quot;.

===Scientific approach===
Bernays pioneered the public relations industry&#x27;s use of mass psychology and other social sciences to design its public persuasion campaigns: &quot;If we understand the mechanism and motives of the group mind, is it not possible to control and regiment the masses according to our will without their knowing about it? The recent practice of propaganda has proved that it is possible, at least up to a certain point and within certain limits.&quot; He later called this scientific technique of opinion-molding the &quot;engineering of consent&quot;.

Bernays expanded on Walter Lippmann&#x27;s concept of stereotype, arguing that predictable elements could be manipulated for mass effects:

Not only psychology but sociology played an important role for the public relations counsel, according to Bernays. The individual is &quot;a cell organized into the social unit. Touch a nerve at a sensitive spot and you get an automatic response from certain specific members of the organism.&quot;

==Philosophy==
Bernays touted the idea that the &quot;masses&quot; are driven by factors outside their conscious understanding, and therefore that their minds can and should be manipulated by the capable few. &quot;Intelligent men must realize that propaganda is the modern instrument by which they can fight for productive ends and help to bring order out of chaos.&quot;

Propaganda was portrayed as the only alternative to chaos.

One way Bernays reconciled manipulation with liberalism was his claim that the human masses would inevitably succumb to manipulation—and therefore the good propagandists could compete with the evil, without incurring any marginal moral cost. In his view, &quot;the minority which uses this power is increasingly intelligent, and works more and more on behalf of ideas that are socially constructive.&quot;

Unlike some other early public relations practitioners, Bernays advocated centralization and planning. Marvin Olasky calls his 1945 book &quot;Take Your Place at the Peace Table&quot; &quot;a clear appeal for a form of mild corporate socialism.&quot;

==Death and legacy==

Edward Bernays died in 1995 at the age of 103, in his Cambridge, Massachusetts home. In his obituary, The New York Times said that &quot;Over the years, he was instrumental in the formation of opinion-shaping methods that were used on behalf of many business and industrial enterprises, welfare and civic groups, and governments at home and abroad.&quot;

Near his 100th birthday, he led an unsuccessful campaign to pass legislation in Massachusetts and other states requiring public relations practitioners to be licensed.

Much of Bernays&#x27;s reputation today stems from his persistent public relations campaign to build his own reputation as &quot;America&#x27;s No. 1 Publicist&quot;. During his active years, many of his peers in the industry were offended by Bernays&#x27;s continuous self-promotion. According to Scott Cutlip, &quot;Bernays was a brilliant person who had a spectacular career, but, to use an old-fashioned word, he was a braggart.&quot;

Bernays attracted positive and negative attention for his grand statements about the role of public relations in society. Reviewers praised &quot;Crystallizing Public Opinion&quot; (1923) as a pioneering study of the importance of something called public opinion. &quot;Propaganda&quot; (1928) drew more criticism for its advocacy of mass manipulation.

In the 1930s, his critics became more harsh. As the leading figure in public relations and a notorious advocate of &quot;propaganda&quot;, Bernays was compared to European fascists such as Joseph Goebbels and Adolf Hitler. (Bernays wrote in his 1965 autobiography that Goebbels read and used his books.)

Rather than retreating from the spotlight, Bernays continued to play up his ideas—for example, stating in a 1935 speech to the Financial Advertisers Association that strong men (including publicists) should become human symbols to lead the masses. On other occasions he tempered this message with the idea that, while propaganda is inevitable, the democratic system allows a pluralism of propaganda, while fascist systems offer only a single official propaganda.

At the same time, Bernays was praised for his apparent success, wisdom, foresight, and influence as an originator of public relations.

While opinions ranged negative to positive, there was widespread agreement that propaganda had a powerful effect on the public mind. According to John Stauber and Sheldon Rampton, in a published review of Larry Tye&#x27;s biography of Bernays:

The Edward L Bernays Foundation, founded in 1949, is still active and incorporated in Northampton, Massachusetts.

<doc id="158139" wikidata="Q2337703" url="?curid=158139" title="Dawn Summers">
<text>Dawn Summers is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon and introduced by Marti Noxon and David Fury on the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, portrayed by Michelle Trachtenberg. She made her debut in the premiere episode of the show&#x27;s fifth season and subsequently appeared in every episode of its remaining three seasons. Within the series, Dawn is the younger sister of main character Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), a girl chosen by fate to be a vampire Slayer. Whedon introduced Dawn to the series because he wanted to introduce a character with whom Buffy could have an intensely emotional non-romantic relationship.

After years of foreshadowing, Dawn was introduced at the start of the fifth season as part of a large in-story retcon: Characters accepted Dawn&#x27;s presence as if she had always been there, and as if Buffy always had a sister, with only the audience aware that this was not the case. As the series went on, the significance of Dawn&#x27;s arrival is revealed to the series&#x27;s other characters, and they come to understand that she has not always been Buffy&#x27;s sister, or indeed a sentient being; Dawn had originally been the mystical &quot;key&quot; to unlocking dimensions and was made into Buffy&#x27;s sister so the Slayer would protect her. Dawn is, however, a real girl, Buffy&#x27;s biological sister, and has real memories of her fictional childhood. She struggles in a very human way when she discovers the truth about her origins and later endures problems with self-harm and kleptomania. The show&#x27;s sixth and seventh seasons, as well as its canonical comic book continuation, follow Dawn&#x27;s journey toward adulthood.

==Appearances==
===Television===
Dawn Marie Summers is first introduced as Buffy&#x27;s (Sarah Michelle Gellar) younger sister at the end of &quot;Buffy&quot; season 5 premiere &quot;Buffy vs. Dracula&quot;, though Buffy had been previously established as an only child. Initially, the mystery of Dawn&#x27;s sudden existence is not acknowledged in the series, with the other characters accepting her as a part of the status quo. Four episodes later, Buffy discovers Dawn is, in fact, a mystical object known as The Key; a group of monks transformed The Key into human form and sent it to the Slayer for protection from the villainous Glory (Clare Kramer). The memories of Buffy and her associates were altered, along with relevant records, so that they believed her to have always existed as Buffy&#x27;s sister. She is shown to look up greatly to Willow and Tara and has a crush on Xander. She also is friendly with Spike, who is as protective of her as Buffy herself. When Dawn learns of her origin, she resorts to self-harm and runs away from home, until Buffy assures her they are real sisters no matter what, securing it with a blood oath. Her relationship with Buffy, having been portrayed with a typical sister dynamic in the first half of the season, changes when she discovers what she is. The two become closer as Dawn becomes Buffy&#x27;s sole focus once she drops out from college to protect her, going as far as to warn her friends she is prepared to kill anyone who attempts to go near Dawn in the finale.

Dawn suffers more pain when her mother (Kristine Sutherland) dies unexpectedly from a brain aneurysm, which leads to Dawn resorting to black magic to try to bring her back from the grave, an action she immediately reverses upon realizing the consequences of her actions. It is eventually revealed that Dawn&#x27;s purpose as The Key is to open portals to alternate dimensions — a power the hell-god Glory wishes to exploit to return home. When Glory successfully uses Dawn&#x27;s blood to break down the dimensional barriers, Buffy sacrifices her own life (realizing that their blood is now the same) to end the apocalypse and save Dawn; Buffy&#x27;s sacrifice also neutralizes the power of The Key, giving Dawn the opportunity of a normal life.

The following season opening sees Dawn struggle with abandonment issues, as well as her escalating kleptomania. Having been devastated by her sister&#x27;s death, Dawn is overjoyed when Willow (Alyson Hannigan) casts a spell to bring her back to life. However, with Buffy spiraling into a deep depression, Dawn feels highly neglected and is often seen alone and seeking attention from her sister, as well as other members of the group. She later experiences her first kiss with a vampire named Justin, whom she is reluctantly forced to stake (her first vampire kill) when he tries to turn her. Dawn&#x27;s isolation from the other characters reaches its apex in &quot;Older and Far Away,&quot; when she inadvertently makes a wish to the vengeance demon Halfrek (Kali Rocha), which results in trapping everyone who enters the Summers house. Halfrek herself is inadvertently trapped, and undoes the curse to free herself; meanwhile, Dawn&#x27;s kleptomania and feelings of neglect by her friends and family are exposed. Buffy vows to mend their relationship and starts spending more time with her sister, whilst still trying to shield her from her life as a Slayer, much to Dawn&#x27;s disappointment, as she is eager to help Buffy in her duties. While helping Buffy battle demons in the season finale, Dawn proves herself to be capable in a fight, finally earning her sister&#x27;s respect and a promise to train her.

In the final season, Dawn becomes more grown-up and a full-fledged member of the &quot;Scooby Gang&quot; — as witnessed in the first few episodes when she aids Buffy and Xander during Willow&#x27;s absence, and is trained by Buffy in combat. When Buffy expresses her doubts about her first day as a guidance counselor at the newly rebuilt Sunnydale High in the episode &quot;Help&quot;, Dawn assures her that she&#x27;ll be fine and that she&#x27;ll be a great counselor. Falling victim to a love spell in the episode &quot;Him&quot;, Dawn displays dangerous behavior such as attacking people and trying to commit suicide to prove her &quot;love&quot; for classmate RJ Brooks. While home alone one night, Dawn is forced to perform a solo exorcism to protect what she believes to be her mother from a demon, though it is revealed to be The First Evil attempting to cause Dawn to doubt her bond with Buffy, which she does for several episodes following this. Dawn&#x27;s feelings of neglect begin to resurface as Buffy spends time training the potentials now living in their home. After wrongly believing herself to be a Potential Slayer, Xander (Nicholas Brendon) explains to Dawn that being normal is perhaps the hardest burden of all, as nobody understands the pain of being overlooked — as he has been in Dawn&#x27;s shoes. Dawn then falls into a watcher-esque role offering the group answers from research, such as ways to communicate with The Bringers and translating texts given to Buffy in a &#x27;slayer keepsake&#x27;. When Buffy tricks her into leaving town before the impending apocalypse, Dawn adamantly returns to fight against the First, during which she battles alongside Xander, and once again proves her value as a fighter by killing several Ubervamps and survives.

Dawn was intended to appear in the &quot;Angel&quot; episode &quot;The Girl in Question&quot;, but Michelle Trachtenberg was unavailable for filming, so Andrew Wells (played by Tom Lenk) replaced her.

===Literature===

In the canonical comic book continuation to the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot; (2007–2011), it is revealed that Buffy and Dawn&#x27;s relationship has been strained and conflicted since the events of &quot;Chosen.&quot; Dawn is revealed to have been cursed, apparently as a result of sleeping with a &quot;thricewise demon&quot; named Kenny while a college student, and is a giant. Throughout her affliction she spends a lot of time with Xander, to whom she reveals she was cursed as a result of cheating on Kenny with his roommate. While her personal issues are made to take a backseat with Buffy, in battles, her gigantism shows some utility; she is able to assist fighting Amy in &quot;The Long Way Home&quot;, and rampages through Tokyo to distract their enemies in &quot;Wolves at the Gate&quot;. In &quot;Time of Your Life, Part One&quot; she shrinks to normal size again, but then turns into a centaur. Xander surmises she will likely experience a third such transformation before she can return to normal. In &quot;Living Doll&quot;, the twenty-fifth issue of the series, Dawn undergoes a transformation into a living doll and is kidnapped by a disturbed dollmaker for her &#x27;protection&#x27;. After her sister, Andrew and Willow track down Kenny, he later appears to undo the curse, and the two have a heart-to-heart, where Dawn apologises for her infidelity and explains she had been unprepared for the seriousness of her feelings for Kenny. She subsequently spends some time bonding with Buffy. Dawn and Xander&#x27;s growing friendship leads to them kissing, where they are discovered by Buffy, in &quot;Retreat&quot;. In the series&#x27; final arc, Buffy brings about the end of magic, following which Xander and Dawn decide to settle down in San Francisco. They allow Buffy to live with them until she finds her own place.

&quot;Season Nine&quot; (2012–13) begins with Dawn and Xander living an ordinary domestic life, with much less contact with Buffy than before since she has moved out. They intend to capitalize on a world without magic and embark upon a life of normalcy. Their relationship is seen to be going through some difficulties, such as when Xander forgets Dawn&#x27;s birthday. Buffy also reflects that Dawn is not on her mind much of late. In &quot;Welcome to the Team,&quot; Dawn becomes sick with what appears to be a very serious flu. Buffy also forgets about one of Dawn&#x27;s allergies. In the concurrent second issue of spin-off series &quot;Willow: Wonderland&quot;, Willow sees a worrying omen about Dawn while in an alternate dimension. Later in the &quot;Buffy&quot; arc, Dawn begins to die and the gang recognise it is due to magic leaving her body. Buffy contacts Faith for help, but (as seen in &quot;Angel &amp; Faith&quot;) neither she nor Angel can remember Dawn. Spike, however, heads straight from Faith&#x27;s apartment in London to be by Dawn&#x27;s side, and Willow returns to California with her powers restored and attempts to prolong Dawn&#x27;s life. In final arc &quot;The Core&quot;, Buffy, Willow and Xander head to the Deeper Well in England in hopes of finding enough magic to restore Dawn. Fearing for his memories, Spike tries to record himself talking about Dawn but the tapes all become static, indicating that everything Dawn affected is also fading. Dawn continues to rapidly fade until she disappears altogether. After the gang restart magic, they return to San Francisco where Willow is able to bring back Dawn using Buffy&#x27;s blood in conjunction with the spell which created her. Willow expresses that something feels different as she brings Dawn back, and Xander is suspicious of Dawn&#x27;s knowledge of very recent events. Buffy tries to tell Xander that he is being paranoid.

In &quot;Season Ten&quot; (2014-2016), Xander continues to be suspicious of Dawn, and insecure concerning their relationship. Buffy compares their behavior to that of her parents prior to their divorce. It is revealed that when Dawn was brought back she was reset emotionally. While she still remembers her relationship with Xander she does not feel love for him anymore and recently re-experienced her grief for her mother&#x27;s death, among other traumas.

==Concept and creation==
The arrival of Dawn Summers is foreshadowed in cryptic dream sequences in both the season 3 finale &quot;Graduation Day, Part Two&quot; and the season 4 episode &quot;This Year&#x27;s Girl&quot;, in which a still-comatose Faith says, while making a bed with Buffy in her bedroom, &quot;Little sis coming, I know.&quot; Buffy replies, &quot;So much to do before she gets here.&quot; (The first appearance of Dawn is in Buffy&#x27;s room.) In the season 4 finale, &quot;Restless&quot;, Tara warns Buffy to &quot;be back before Dawn.&quot;

According to &quot;Buffy&quot; creator Joss Whedon, the introduction of Dawn in season 5 was partly so protagonist Buffy Summers could experience a &quot;really important, intense emotional relationship&quot; with someone other than a boyfriend. &quot;She&#x27;s as intense as she was in season 2 with Angelus, but it&#x27;s about her sister,&quot; Whedon says. &quot;To me that was really beautiful.&quot;
Trachtenberg says she was thrust into the role without knowing much about Dawn&#x27;s personality; she describes her initial meeting with Joss Whedon as &quot;Alright, welcome to the cast, you&#x27;re a teenager, you&#x27;re a Key, have fun.&quot;

==Characterization==
In the beginning of season 5 Dawn is portrayed as less mature than her age of fourteen. She is seen to be immature, sulky, and klutzy, often breaking objects, and she keeps a diary. Buffy and Joyce also infantilise her to some degree; they are shown finding someone to babysit her, although they later become more relaxed about this as seen in &quot;No Place Like Home&quot;.

Responding to fan complaints of Dawn being whiny throughout season 6, Joss Whedon says, &quot;I scratched my head. I was like, &#x27;Excuse me, she&#x27;s been abandoned by about six parental figures. The girl has huge issues.&#x27;&quot; However, he acknowledges that he and the writers hit &quot;the same note for a while... We needed to make some changes.&quot; Whedon has expressed regret over not being able to go further with Dawn&#x27;s character in season 7, but, as he says, &quot;You get into a situation that you do like to stand alone [but] &#x27;Dawn Goes on a Date&#x27; is not something that people would really sit for.&quot;

Author Nikki Stafford saw the season 7 episode &quot;Potential&quot; as an example of Dawn&#x27;s growing maturity. She praises the character for taking charge and accepting the possibility she might be a Potential Slayer, and for quietly stepping back when she turns out to be wrong, without revealing how disappointed she really is. Stafford states, &quot;Dawn has come a long way from the annoying adolescent she was in season 5, and the screechy, difficult teen she was in season 6 (&#x27;get out, Get Out, GET OUT!&#x27;). She is a mature young woman, the same age as Buffy was in season 1, but she is handling her problems with even more grace and acceptance than her older sister did.&quot;

<text>Eta Canis Majoris (η Canis Majoris, abbreviated Eta CMa, η CMa), also named Aludra , is a star in the constellation of Canis Major. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.

== Nomenclature==
&quot;η Canis Majoris&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Eta Canis Majoris&quot;) is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation.

The traditional name &quot;Aludra&quot; originates from the Arabic: &quot;العذراء&quot; &quot;al-adhraa&quot;, &#x27;the virgin&#x27;. This star, along with Epsilon Canis Majoris (Adhara), Delta Canis Majoris (Wezen) and Omicron2 Canis Majoris (Thanih al Adzari), were &quot;Al &#x27;Adhārā&quot; (&quot;العذاري&quot;), &#x27;the Virgins&#x27;. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Aludra&quot; for this star.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Bow and Arrow&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of Eta Canis Majoris, Delta Canis Majoris, HD 63032, HD 65456, Omicron Puppis, k Puppis, Epsilon Canis Majoris, Kappa Canis Majoris and Pi Puppis. Consequently, Eta Canis Majoris itself is known as (, ).

==Properties==
Eta Canis Majoris is a blue supergiant with a spectral type B5Ia. It has been the standard for this spectral class in the Morgan–Keenan system. It is likely a post-red supergiant, a star which left its red supergiant phase and near the end of its life. As a consequence, Eta CMa has lost significant part of its mass, and now has a mass of either , depending on the estimate, in contrast with its initial mass of .

Eta CMa shines brightly in the skies in spite of a large distance from Earth due to being intrinsically many times brighter than the Sun. It has a luminosity over 100,000 times and a radius around 54 times that of the Sun. It has only existed for a fraction of the time the Sun has, less than 10 million years, yet is already in the last stages of its life.

Eta CMa is classified as an Alpha Cygni-type variable star and its brightness varies from magnitude +2.38 to +2.48 over a period of 4.7 days.

==Namesakes==
Both USS &quot;Aludra&quot; (AF-55), an &quot;Alstede&quot;-class stores ship, and USS &quot;Aludra&quot; (AK-72), a &quot;Crater&quot;-class cargo ship, were U.S. Navy vessels named after the star.

<text>The United States is a country primarily located in North America. Demographics of the United States concern matters of population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations, and other aspects regarding the population.
==Historical Census population==
The following table shows 16102020 population data. The census numbers do not include Native Americans during 1610, and then again after 1860.

==Immigration==

===Earlier colonial era===
Nearly all non-Native American commercial activity was run in small privately owned businesses with good credit both at home and in England being essential since they were often cash poor. Most settlements were nearly independent of trade with Britain as most grew or made nearly everything they needed—the average cost of imports for most households was only about 5-15 English pounds per year. Most settlements were created by complete family groups with several generations often present. Probably close to 80% of the families owned the land they lived and farmed on. They nearly all used English Common Law as their basic code of law and, except for the French, Dutch and Germans spoke some dialect of English. They established their own popularly elected governments and courts and were mostly self-governing, self-supporting, and self-replicating.

Nearly all colonies and, later, states in the United States were settled by migration from another colony or state, as foreign immigration usually only played a minor role after first initial settlements were established.

====New England====
The New England colonists included some educated men as well as many skilled farmers, tradesmen and craftsmen. They were mostly farmers and settled in small villages for common religious activity. Shipbuilding, commerce, and fisheries were important in coastal towns. New England&#x27;s healthy climate (the cold winters killed mosquitoes and other disease-bearing insects), and abundant food supply resulted in the lowest death rate and highest birth rate of any place in the world (marriage was expected and birth control was not, and a much higher than average number of children and mothers survived).

The eastern and northern frontier around the initial New England settlements was mainly settled by the Yankee descendants of the original New Englanders. Emigration to the New England colonies after 1640 and the start of the English Civil War decreased to less than 1% (about equal to the death rate) in nearly all years before 1845. The rapid growth of the New England colonies (total population ≈700,000 by 1790) was almost entirely due to the high birth rate (&gt;3%) and low death rate (&lt;1%) per year.

====Middle colonies====
The middle colonies&#x27; settlements were scattered west of New York City, New York (est. 1626 by Dutch, taken over by the English in 1664) and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (est. 1682). The Dutch-started colony of New York had an eclectic collection of residents from many different nations and prospered as a major trading and commercial center after about 1700. Pennsylvania was dominated by the Quakers for decades after they emigrated there, mainly from the North Midlands of England, from about 1680 to 1725. The main commercial center of Philadelphia was run mostly by prosperous Quakers, supplemented by many small farming and trading communities with strong German contingents located in the Delaware River valley.

Many more settlers arrived in the middle colonies starting in about 1680, when Pennsylvania was founded, and many Protestant sects were encouraged to settle there for freedom of religion and good, cheap land. These settlers were of about 60% German and 33% English extraction. By 1780 about 27% of New York&#x27;s population were descendants of Dutch settlers (55,000 of 204,000). New Jersey was home to the remaining Dutch and they constituted 14% of the population of 140,000. The rest were mostly English with a mixture of other Europeans and about 6% Blacks. New Jersey and Delaware had a majority of British with 20% German-descended colonists, about a 6% black population, and a small contingent of Swedish descendants of New Sweden. Nearly all were at least third-generation natives.

====South====
The main feature of the economy in Virginia, Maryland and South Carolina was large plantations growing staples for export, especially tobacco and rice. Outside the plantations, land was farmed by independent farmers who rented from the proprietors, or (most often) owned it outright. They emphasized subsistence farming to grow food for their large families. Many of the Irish immigrants specialized in making rye whiskey, which they sold to obtain cash. In Maryland, by 1700 there were about 25,000 people and by 1750 that had grown more than 5 times to 130,000. By 1755, about 40% of Maryland&#x27;s population was black.

====Frontier====
From 1717 to 1775 the western frontier was populated primarily by Presbyterian settlers who migrated from Scotland and Ireland. Frontier settlers initially landed in Philadelphia or Baltimore before migrating to the western frontier for the cheaper land.

===Natural growth===
All the colonies grew mostly by natural growth, with foreign born populations rarely exceeding 10%. The last significant colonies to be settled mainly by immigrants were Pennsylvania in the early 18th century and Georgia and the Borderlands in the late 18th century, as internal migration (not immigration) continued to provide nearly all the settlers for each new colony or state. This pattern would continue throughout U.S. history. The extent of colonial settlements by 1800 is shown by this map from the University of Texas map collection.

===Population in 1790===
According to one source the following were the countries of origin for new arrivals coming to the United States before 1790. The regions marked * were part of Great Britain. The ancestry of the 3.9 million population in 1790 has been estimated from various sources by sampling last names in the 1790 census and assigning them a country of origin. The Irish in the 1790 census were mostly Scots Irish. The French were mostly Huguenots. The total U.S. Catholic population in 1790 is estimated at 40,000 or 1.6%, perhaps a low count due to prejudice. The Native American Indian population inside territorial U.S. 1790 boundaries was less than 100,000.

# Data from Ann Arbor, Michigan: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPS)
# Several West African regions were the home to most African slaves transported to America. Population from US 1790 Census.
# Germany in this time period consisted of a large number of separate countries, the largest of which was Prussia.
# Jewish settlers were from several European countries.
# The &quot;Other&quot; category probably contains mostly settlers of English ancestry. However, the loss of several states&#x27; detailed census records in the Burning of Washington D.C. in the War of 1812 makes estimation difficult. Nearly all states that lost their 1790 (and 1800) census records have tried to reconstitute their original census from tax records etc. with various degrees of success. The summaries of the 1790 and 1800 census from all states survived.
# The total is the total immigration over the approximately 130-year span of colonial existence of the U.S. colonies as found in the 1790 census. Many of the colonists, especially from the New England colonies, were already into their fifth generation of being in America. At the time of the American Revolution the foreign born population is estimated to be from 300,000 to 400,000.

During the 17th century, approximately 350–400,000 English people migrated to colonial America. However, only half stayed permanently. They were 90% of whites in 1700. From 1700 to 1775 between 400 and 500,000 Europeans immigrated, 90% of whom were Scots, Scots-Irish, Irish, Germans and Huguenots. Only 45,000 English immigrated in the period 1701 to 1775, a figure that has been questioned as too low. Elsewhere the number given is 51,000 (80,000 in total less 29,000 Welsh). The figure of 45,000 has been questioned as a &quot;mystery&quot;. These numbers do not include the 50,000–120,000 convicts transported, 33,000 of whom were English. Even the very high birth rate may not account for all of the nine-fold increase from 230,000 to 2.1 million. Another estimate with very similar results to the ICPS study (except for the French and Swedish totals) gives the number of Americans of English ancestry as 1.9 million in 1790 or 47.9% of the total of 3.930 million (3.5% Welsh, 8.5% Scotch Irish, 4.3% Scots, Irish (South) 4.7%, German 7.3%, Dutch 2.7%, French 1.7%, Swedish 0.2% and Black, 19.3%. The southern Irish were overwhelmingly Protestant.

The 1790 population reflected the approximate 50,000 &quot;Loyalists&quot; who had emigrated to Canada during and at the end of the American Revolution, 7–10,000 of whom went to the United Kingdom and 6,000 to the Caribbean. Thirty thousand Americans emigrated to Upper Canada (now Ontario) in the 1790s, often referred to as &quot;Late Loyalists&quot;. They were mostly not political refugees but went for generous land grants and taxes 75 percent lower than in the United States.

By 1790 the ancestry question was starting to become irrelevant to many, as intermarriage from different ethnic groups was becoming common, causing people to form a common American identity. The total white population in 1790 was about 80% of British ancestry, and would go on to roughly double by natural increase every 25 years. From about 1675 onward, the native-born population of what would become the United States would never again drop below 85% of the total.

===Immigration 1791 to 1849===
In the early years of the United States, immigration average about 6,000 people per year, including French refugees from the slave revolt in Haiti. The French Revolution, starting in 1789, and the Napoleonic Wars from 1792 to 1814 severely limited immigration from Europe. The War of 1812 (1812–1814) with Britain again prevented any significant immigration. By 1808 Congress had banned the transport of slaves, slowing that human traffic to a trickle.

After 1820 immigration gradually increased. For the first time federal records, including ship passenger lists, were kept for immigration. Total immigration for the year 1820 was 8,385, gradually building to 23,322 by 1830, with 143,000 total immigrating during the decade. From 1831 to 1840 immigration increased greatly, to 599,000 total, as 207,000 Irish, even before the famine of 1845–1849, started to emigrate in large numbers as Britain eased travel restrictions. 152,000 Germans, 76,000 British, and 46,000 French formed the next largest immigrant groups in that decade.

From 1841 to 1850 immigration exploded to 1,713,000 total immigrants and at least 781,000 Irish who fled their homeland to escape poverty or death during the famine of 1845–1849. In attempting to divert some of this traffic to help settle Canada, the British offered bargain fares of 15 shillings for transit to Canada, instead of the normal 5 pounds (100 shillings). Thousands of poor Irish took advantage of this offer and headed to Canada on what came to be called the &quot;coffin ships&quot; because of their high death rates. Once in Canada, many Irish walked across the border or caught an intercoastal freighter to the nearest major city in the United States – usually Boston or New York. Bad potato crops and failed revolutions struck the heart of Europe in 1848, contributing to the decade&#x27;s total of 435,000 Germans, 267,000 British and 77,000 French immigrants to America. Bad times in Europe drove people out; land, relatives, freedom, opportunity, and jobs in America lured them in.

The number of immigrants from 1830 on are from immigration records. The census of 1850 was the first in which place of birth was asked. It is probably a reasonable estimate that the foreign born population in the U.S. reached its minimum in about 1815 at something like 100,000, or 1.4% of the population. By 1815 most of the immigrants that arrived before the American Revolution had died, and there had been almost no new immigration.

The total number immigrating in each decade from 1790 to 1820 are estimates.

The number of foreign born in the 1830s and 1840s are extrapolations.

Nearly all population growth up to 1830 was by internal increase; about 98.5% of the population was native-born. By 1850, this had shifted to about 90% native-born. The first significant Catholic immigration started in the mid-1840s.

===Immigration 1965 to present===
In 1965, U.S. immigration law changes reduced the emphasis on national origin. Prior policy favored European immigrants. The 1965 law directed that those with relatives in the U.S. or employer sponsorship now had priority. By the 1970s, most immigrants to the U.S. came from Latin America or Asia, rather than Europe. Since 2000, over three quarters of all immigrants to the U.S. have come from Asia and Latin America.
==Migration within the United States==

===The American West===
In 1848, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, concluding the Mexican War, extended U.S. citizenship to approximately 60,000 Mexican residents of the New Mexico Territory and 10,000 living in California. However, much like Texas, the Mexican government had encouraged immigration and settlement of these regions from groups in the United States and Europe. Approximately half of this population is estimated to have been of American origin. In 1849, the California Gold Rush spurred significant immigration from Mexico, South America, China, Australia, Europe and caused a mass internal migration within the U.S., resulting in California gaining statehood in 1850, with a population of about 90,000.

===Rural flight===

&quot;Rural flight&quot; is the departure of excess populations (usually young men and women) from farm areas. In some cases whole families left, as in the Dust Bowl in the 1930s. Much of rural America has seen steady population decline since 1920.

===Black migration out of the South===
The Great Migration was the movement of millions of African Americans out of the rural Southern United States from 1914 to 1960. Most moved to large industrial cities, as well as to many smaller industrial cities. African-Americans moved as individuals or small groups. There was no government assistance. They migrated because of a variety of push and pull factors:

====Push factors====
# Many African-Americans wanted to avoid the lynching and racial segregation of the Jim Crow South and sought refuge in the supposed &quot;Promised Land&quot; of the North where there was thought to be less segregation. 
# The boll weevil infestation of the cotton fields of the South in the late 1910s reduced the demand for sharecroppers.
# The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and its aftermath displaced hundreds of thousands of African-American farm workers.

====Pull factors====
# Income levels were much higher in the North, with far higher wages in the service sector.
# The enormous growth of war industries in WW1 and WW2 created new job openings for blacks. 
# World War I effectively put a halt to the flow of European immigrants to the industrial centers, causing shortages of workers in the factories.
# In the 1930s Works Progress Administration, Civilian Conservation Corps and other relief programs in the North were more receptive to blacks. The WPA paid more in the North.
# After 1940, as the U.S. rearmed for World War II (see Homefront-United States-World War II), industrial production increased rapidly.
# The FEPC equal opportunity laws were more enforced in the North and West.

===Since 1990===
The proportion of Americans who move across state lines fell by 50% from 1990 to 2018. Regional disparities in local economies have also grown during this time, meaning that more people remain in economically depressed areas. By 2011, migration levels were at the lowest level since World War II, and were in the longest period of continuous decline in the twentieth century.

==Recent demographic trends==

===Post-war baby boom===

In the years after WWII, the United States, as well as a number of other industrialized countries, experienced an unexpected sudden birth rate jump. During WWII birthrates had been low, as millions of men had been away fighting in WWII and this had deterred women from starting families: women also had to take the place of men in the workplace, while simultaneously fulfilling their household duties. The millions of men coming back to the US after WWII, and the couples eager to start families, led to a sharp rise in the US birth rate, and a surge in new housing construction in the suburbs and outlying areas of the cities. Since the men who came back got jobs in the workplace again, married women stayed home to take care of the house and children and let their husbands be the breadwinner of the household.

During the baby boom years, between 1946 and 1964, the birth rate doubled for third children and tripled for fourth children.

The total fertility rate of the United States jumped from 2.49 in 1945 to 2.94 in 1946, a rise of 0.45 children therefore beginning the baby boom. It continued to rise throughout the 1940s to reach 3.10 in 1950 with a peak of 3.77 in 1957. Declining slowly thereafter to 3.65 in 1960 and finally a steep from decline after 1964, therefore ending the baby boom.

===Marriages===
According to statistics, the United States currently has the highest marriage rate in the developed world, as of 2008, with a marriage rate of 7.1 per 1,000 people or 2,162,000 marriages. The average age for first marriage for men is 27.4 and 25.6 years for women. The United States also has one of the highest proportions of people who do marry by age 40; approximately 85% Americans are married at 40, compared to only 60% in Sweden.

During the 1930s, the number of marriages and the marriage rate dropped steeply due to the Great Depression, but rebounded almost immediately after the Depression ended. Marriage rates increased and remained at high levels in the late 1930 to the mid-1940s. The number of marriages shot up to reach over 2 million in 1946, with a marriage rate of 16.4 per 1,000 people as WWII had ended. The average age at first marriage for both men and women began to fall after WWII, dropping 22.8 for men and 20.3 for women in 1950 and dropping even more to 22.5 and 20.1 years in 1956. In 1959, the United States Census Bureau estimated that 47% of all brides marrying for their first time were teenagers aged 19 and under. In 1955, 51.2% of women were married by their 20th birthday and 88% by their 25th birthday; 40.3% of men and 28.5% of women aged 20–24 in 1955 had never married, down from 77.8% for men and 57.4% for women in 1940.

As of 2002, 4.3% of men and 18.1% of women aged 20 are married, increasing to 37% of men and 52% of women by age 25, and then 61% of men and 76% of women by age 30.

===Population growth projections===
The U.S. population in 1900 was 76 million. In 1950, it rose to 152 million; by 2000 it had reached 282 million. By 2050, it is expected to reach 422–458 million, depending on immigration.
==Demographic models in historiography==
Richard Easterlin, an economist who has researched economic growth in the United States, explains the growth pattern of the American population in the 20th century through fertility rate fluctuations and the decreasing mortality rate. Easterlin has attempted to explain the cause of the Baby Boom and Baby Bust through the &quot;relative income&quot; theory. The &quot;relative income&quot; theory suggests that couples choose to have children based on a couple&#x27;s ratio of potential earning power and the desire to obtain material objects. This ratio depends on the economic stability of the country in which they live and how people are raised to value material objects. The &quot;relative income&quot; theory explains the Baby Boom by suggesting that the late 1940s and 1950s brought low desires to have material objects, as a result of the Great Depression and WWII, as well as huge job opportunities, because of it being a post-war period. These two factors gave rise to a high relative income, which encouraged high fertility. Following this period, the next generation had a greater desire for material objects; however, an economic slowdown in the United States made jobs harder to acquire. This resulted in lower fertility rates, causing the Baby Bust.

==State trends==
Between 1880 and 1900, the urban population of the United States rose from 28% to 40%, and reached 50% by 1920, in part due to 9,000,000 European immigrants. After 1890 the US rural population began to plummet, as farmers were displaced by mechanization and forced to migrate to urban factory jobs. After World War II, the US experienced a shift away from the cities and into suburbs mostly due to the cost of land, the availability of low-cost government home loans, fair housing policies, and the construction of highways. Many of the original manufacturing cities lost as much as half their populations between 1950 and 1980. There was a shift in the population from the dense city centers filled with apartments, row homes, and tenements; to less dense suburban neighborhoods outside the cities which were filled with single-family homes.

<doc id="158145" wikidata="Q228911" url="?curid=158145" title="Anglo-Zulu War">
<text>The Anglo-Zulu War was fought in present-day South Africa from January to early July 1879 between forces of the British Empire and the Zulu Kingdom. Two famous battles of the war were the Zulu victory at Isandlwana and the British defence at Rorke&#x27;s Drift.

Following the passing of the British North America Act of 1867 forming a federation in Canada, Lord Carnarvon thought that a similar political effort, coupled with military campaigns, might lead to a ruling white minority over a black majority in South Africa. This would yield a large pool of cheap labour for the British sugar plantations and mines, and was intended to bring the African Kingdoms, tribal areas, and Boer republics into South Africa. 

In 1874, Sir Bartle Frere was sent to South Africa as High Commissioner for the British Empire to effect such plans. Among the obstacles were the armed independent states of the South African Republic and the Kingdom of Zululand.

Frere, on his own initiative, sent a provocative ultimatum on 11 December 1878 to Zulu King Cetshwayo. Upon its rejection, he ordered Lord Chelmsford to invade Zululand. The war had several particularly bloody battles, including an opening victory of the Zulu at the Battle of Isandlwana, followed by the defence of Rorke&#x27;s Drift by a small British Garrison from an attack by a large Zulu force. However, the British eventually gained the upper hand at Kambula, before taking the Zulu capital of Ulundi. The British eventually won the war, ending Zulu dominance of the region. The British Empire made the Zulu Kingdom a protectorate and later annexed it in 1887. 

The war dispelled prior colonial notions of British invincibility, due to their massive early defeats. Together with famines, diplomatic misadventures, and other unpopular wars overseas (such as the Second Anglo-Afghan War), it contributed to the ejection of Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s government from office in 1880, after only one term.

==Background==
===British Empire===
By the 1850s, the British Empire had colonies in southern Africa bordering on various Boer settlements, native African kingdoms such as the Zulus and the Basotho and numerous indigenous tribal areas and states. Various interactions with those groups followed an expansionist policy. Cape Colony was formed after the Anglo–Dutch Treaty of 1814 had permanently ceded the Dutch colony of Cape Town to Britain, and its territory expanded very substantially in the 19th century. Natal, in south-eastern Africa, was claimed by the British as a colony on 4 May 1843, after the British government had annexed the Boer Republic of Natalia. Matters were brought to a head when three sons (led by Mehlokazulu kaSihayo) and a brother of the Zulu inkosi Sihayo organized a raid into Natal and carried off two women who were under British protection.

The discovery of diamonds in 1867 near the Vaal River, some northeast of Cape Town, ended the isolation of the Boers in the interior and had a significant effect on events. The discovery triggered a diamond rush that attracted people from all over the world, which turned Kimberley into a town of 50,000 within five years and drew the attention of British imperial interests. In the 1870s, the British annexed West Griqualand, site of the Kimberley diamond discoveries.

In 1874 Lord Carnarvon, Secretary of State for the Colonies, who had brought about federation in Canada in 1867, thought that a similar scheme might work in South Africa, The South African plan called for a ruling white minority over a black majority, which would provide a large pool of cheap labour for the British sugar plantations and mines, Carnarvon, in an attempt to extend British influence in 1875, approached the Boer states of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal Republic and tried to organize a federation of the British and Boer territories but the Boer leaders turned him down.

In 1877, Sir Bartle Frere was made High Commissioner for Southern Africa by Lord Carnarvon. Carnarvon appointed Frere to the position on the understanding that he would work to enforce Carnarvon&#x27;s confederation plan and Frere could then become the first British governor of a federated southern African dominion. Frere was sent to South Africa as High Commissioner to bring this plan about. One of the obstacles to such a scheme was the presence of the independent Boer states of the South African Republic, informally known as the Transvaal Republic and the Orange Free State, and the Kingdom of Zululand. Bartle Frere wasted no time in putting the scheme forward and manufacturing a casus belli against the Zulu by exaggerating the significance of a number of recent incidents.
By 1877, Sir Theophilus Shepstone, the British Secretary for Native Affairs in Natal, annexed the Transvaal Republic for Britain using a special warrant. The Transvaal Boers objected but as long as the Zulu threat remained, found themselves between two threats; they feared that if they took up arms to resist the British annexation, King Cetshwayo and the Zulus would take the opportunity to attack. The successive British annexations and in particular the annexation of West Griqualand caused a climate of simmering unease for the Boer republics.

Shepstone railed against the disruptive effect of allowing Cetshwayo&#x27;s regime to remain. &quot;Zulu power&quot;, he said, &quot;is the root and real strength of all native difficulties in South Africa&quot;. In December 1877, he wrote to Carnarvon &quot;Cetshwayo is the secret hope of every petty independent chief hundreds of miles from him who feels a desire that his colour shall prevail, and it will not be until this hope is destroyed that they will make up their minds to submit to the rule of civilisation&quot;. Earlier in October 1877, Shepstone had attended a meeting with Zulu leaders near the Blood River to resolve the land dispute between the Zulus and the Boers. He suggested a compromise with the Boers and the meeting broke up without clear resolutions. He turned against the Zulus with vengeance, saying he had come into possession of &quot;the most incontrovertible, overwhelming and clear evidence&quot; never previously disclosed, for supporting the claims of the Boers. He rejected Zulu claims as &quot;characterised by lying and treachery to an extent that I could not have believed even savages are capable of&quot;.

Shepstone, in his capacity as British governor of Natal, had expressed concerns about the Zulu army under King Cetshwayo and the potential threat to Natal – especially given the adoption by some of the Zulus of old muskets and other out-of-date firearms. In his new role of Administrator of the Transvaal, he was now responsible for protecting the Transvaal and had direct involvement in the Zulu border dispute from the side of the Transvaal. Persistent Boer representations and Paul Kruger&#x27;s diplomatic manoeuvres added to the pressure. There were incidents involving Zulu paramilitary actions on either side of the Transvaal/Natal border, and Shepstone increasingly began to regard King Cetshwayo, as having permitted such &quot;outrages&quot;, and to be in a &quot;defiant mood&quot;. King Cetshwayo now found no defender in Natal save the bishop of Natal, John Colenso.

Colenso advocated for native Africans in Natal and Zululand who had been unjustly treated by the colonial regime in Natal. In 1874 he took up the cause of Langalibalele and the Hlubi and Ngwe tribes in representations to the Colonial Secretary, Lord Carnarvon. Langalibalele had been falsely accused of rebellion in 1873 and, following a charade of a trial, was found guilty and imprisoned on Robben Island. In taking the side of Langalibalele against the colonial regime in Natal and Theophilus Shepstone, the Secretary for Native Affairs, Colenso found himself even further estranged from colonial society in Natal.

Bishop Colenso&#x27;s concern about the misleading information that was being provided to the Colonial Secretary in London by Shepstone and the Governor of Natal prompted him to champion the cause of the Zulus against Boer oppression and official encroachments. He was a prominent critic of Frere&#x27;s efforts to depict the Zulu kingdom as a threat to Natal. Colenso&#x27;s campaigns revealed the racialist foundation underpinning the colonial regime in Natal and made him enemies among the colonists.

British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s Tory administration in London did not want a war with the Zulus. &quot;The fact is,&quot; wrote Sir Michael Hicks Beach, who was to replace Carnarvon as Secretary of State for the Colonies, in November 1878, &quot;that matters in Eastern Europe and India ... wore so serious an aspect that we cannot have a Zulu war in addition to other greater and too possible troubles.&quot; However, Sir Bartle Frere had already been into the Cape Colony as governor and High Commissioner since 1877 with the brief of creating a Confederation of South Africa from the various British colonies, Boer Republics and native states and his plans were well advanced. He had concluded that the powerful Zulu kingdom stood in the way of this, and so was receptive to Shepstone&#x27;s arguments that King Cetshwayo and his Zulu army posed a threat to the peace of the region. Preparations for a British invasion of the Zulu kingdom had been underway for months. In December 1878, notwithstanding the reluctance of the British government to start yet another colonial war, Frere presented Cetshwayo with an ultimatum that the Zulu army be disbanded and the Zulus accept a British resident. This was unacceptable to the Zulus as it effectively meant that Cetshwayo, had he agreed, would have lost his throne.

===Zulu Kingdom===

Shaka Zulu, the first Zulu king, had through war and conquest built the small Zulu tribe into the Zulu Kingdom, which by 1825 encompassed an area of around . In 1828 he was assassinated at Dukuza by one of his inDunas and two of his half-brothers, one of whom, Dingane kaSenzangakhona, succeeded him as king. By the 1830s migrating Boers came into conflict with the Zulu Kingdom, then ruled by Dingane. Dingane suffered a crushing defeat on 16 December 1838, when he attacked a group of 470 Voortrekker settlers led by Pretorius at the Battle of Blood River. Dingane&#x27;s half brother, Mpande kaSenzangakhona, then defected with some 17,000 followers and allied with the Boers against Dingane. Dingane was assassinated and Mpande became king of the Zulu empire.

In 1839, the Boer Voortrekkers, under Pretorius, formed the Boer Republic of Natalia, south of the Tugela, and west of the British settlement of Port Natal (now Durban). Mpande and Pretorius maintained peaceful relations. However, in 1842, war broke out between the British and the Boers, resulting in the British annexation of Natalia. Mpande shifted his allegiance to the British, and remained on good terms with them.
In 1843, Mpande ordered a purge of perceived dissidents within his kingdom. This resulted in numerous deaths, and the fleeing of thousands of refugees into neighbouring areas, including the British-controlled Natal. Many of these refugees fled with cattle, the main measure of the Zulu wealth. Mpande began raiding the surrounding areas, culminating in the invasion of Swaziland in 1852. However, the British pressured him into withdrawing, which he did shortly afterwards. At this time, a battle for the succession broke out between two of Mpande&#x27;s sons, Cetshwayo and Mbuyazi. This culminated in 1856 with the Battle of Ndondakusuka, which left Mbuyazi dead. Cetshwayo then set about usurping his father&#x27;s authority. When Mpande died of old age in 1872, Cetshwayo took over as ruler.

In 1861, Umtonga, another son of Mpande, fled to the Utrecht district, prompting Cetshwayo to assemble an army on the nearby frontier. According to claims later brought forward by the Boers, Cetshwayo offered the farmers a strip of land along the border if they would surrender his brother. The Boers complied on the condition that Umtonga&#x27;s life was spared, and in 1861 Mpande signed a deed transferring this land to the Boers. The south boundary of the land added to Utrecht ran from Rorke&#x27;s Drift on the Buffalo to a point on the Pongola River.
The boundary was beaconed in 1864, but when in 1865 Umtonga again fled from Zululand to Natal, Cetshwayo, seeing that he had lost his part of the bargain (for he feared that the still living Umtonga might be used to supplant him, as Mpande had been used to supplant Dingane), removed the beacon and claimed the land ceded by the Swazis to Lydenburg. The Zulus asserted that the Swazis were their vassals and therefore had no right to part with this territory. For a year, a Boer commando unit, under Paul Kruger and an army under Cetshwayo were posted to defend the newly acquired Utrecht border. The Zulu forces took back their land north of the Pongola. Questions were also raised as to the validity of the documents signed by the Zulus concerning the Utrecht strip; in 1869 the services of the lieutenant-governor of Natal, then Robert William Keate, were accepted by both parties as arbitrator, but the attempt then made to settle disagreements proved unsuccessful.

In spite of his dislike for their activities, Cetshwayo permitted European missionaries in Zululand. Though he did not harm or persecute the missionaries themselves, several converts were killed. The missionaries, for their part, were a source of hostile reports. While numerous Zulus of rival factions fled into Natal and some of the surrounding areas, Cetshwayo continued and maintained the peaceful relations with the Natal colonists that had prevailed for decades. Such was the political background when Cetshwayo became absolute ruler of the Zulus upon his father&#x27;s death in 1873.

As ruler, Cetshwayo set about reviving the military methods of his uncle Shaka as far as possible. He formed new age-set regiments and even succeeded in equipping his regiments with a few antiquated muskets and other outdated firearms. Most Zulu warriors were armed with an &quot;iklwa&quot; (the Zulu refinement of the &quot;assegai&quot; thrusting spear) and a shield made of cowhide. The Zulu army drilled in the personal and tactical use and coordination of this weapons system. While some Zulus also had firearms, their marksmanship training was poor and the quality and supply of their powder and shot was dreadful. The Zulu attitude towards firearms was summarized: &quot;The generality of Zulu warriors, however, would not have firearms – the arms of a coward, as they said, for they enable the poltroon to kill the brave without awaiting his attack.&quot;

==History==

===Boundary Commission and ultimatum===

The tension between Cetshwayo and the Transvaal over border disputes continued. Sir Theophilus Shepstone, whom Cetshwayo regarded as his friend, had supported him in the border dispute, but in 1877 he led a small force into the Transvaal and persuaded the Boers to give up their independence. Shepstone became administrator of the Transvaal, and in that role saw the border dispute from the other side. Shepstone claimed to have evidence supporting the Boer position but, ultimately, he failed to provide any. In a meeting with Zulu notables at Blood River in October 1877, Shepstone attempted to placate the Zulu with paternal speeches, however they were unconvinced and accused Shepstone of betraying them. Shepstone&#x27;s subsequent reports to Carnarvon then began to paint the Zulu as an aggressive threat where he had previously presented Cetshwayo in a most favourable light.

In February 1878 a commission was appointed by Henry Bulwer, the lieutenant-governor of Natal since 1875, to report on the boundary question. The commission reported in July and found almost entirely in favour of the contention of the Zulu. However, Sir Henry Bartle Frere, then high commissioner and still pressing forward with Carnarvon&#x27;s federation plan, characterized the award as &quot;one-sided and unfair to the Boers&quot;, stipulated that on the land being given to the Zulu, the Boers living on it should be compensated if they left or protected if they remained. In addition, Frere planned to use the meeting on the boundary commission report with the Zulu representatives to also present a surprise ultimatum he had devised that would allow British forces under Lord Chelmsford, which he had previously been instructed to use only in defense against a Zulu invasion of Natal, to instead invade Zululand. Three incidents occurred in late July, August and September which Frere seized upon as his &quot;casus belli&quot; and were the basis for the ultimatum with which Frere knew Cetshwayo could not comply, giving Frere a pretext to attack the Zulu kingdom.

The first two incidents related to the flight into Natal of two wives of Sihayo kaXongo and their subsequent seizure and execution by his brother and sons and were described thus:

The third incident occurred in September when two men were detained while on a sandbank of the Thukela River near the Middle Drift. Sir Bartle Frere described this matter in a despatch to Sir Michael Hicks Beach, who had replaced Carnarvon as Secretary of State for the Colonies:

By themselves, these incidents were flimsy grounds upon which to found an invasion of Zululand. Bulwer did not initially hold Cetshwayo responsible for what was clearly not a political act in the seizure and murder of the two women.

Cetshwayo also treated the complaint rather lightly, responding
The original complaint carried to Cetshwayo from the lieutenant-governor was in the form of a request for the surrender of the culprits. The request was subsequently transformed by Sir Bartle Frere into a &quot;demand&quot;. Frere wrote to Hicks Beach, 30 September 1878:
In reply, in at least three dispatches, 17 October, 21 November and 18 December, Hicks Beach emphatically states that war is to be avoided and a British invasion of Zululand prohibited. From 21 November dispatch:

After considerable discussion and exchanges of views between Sir Bartle Frere and Sir Henry Ernest Gascoyne Bulwer, it was decided to arrange a meeting with representatives of the Zulu king. The ostensible reason for this &quot;indaba&quot; was to present the findings of the long-awaited Boundary Commission to the Zulu people. The occasion was also to be used to present the king with an ultimatum.

When the ultimatum was presented, the two infractions by Sihayo&#x27;s sons and the roughing up of Smith and Deighton had become only part of the justification that was used, as several matters had arisen in the meantime. One of them was Cetshwayo&#x27;s apparent breaking of promises to Mr Theophilus Shepstone at the king&#x27;s &quot;coronation&quot; in 1872. That farcical piece of theatre had been agreed to by Cetshwayo simply to satisfy the wishes of Shepstone and meant nothing to the Zulu people. Indeed, his real Zulu installation had taken place several weeks earlier when he had been acclaimed by his izinduna.
A second addition to the ultimatum, which seems almost like an afterthought, required the surrender of Mbelini kaMswati. Mbelini was the son of a Swazi king who unsuccessfully disputed the succession with his brother, resulting in his exile from the kingdom. He took refuge with Cetshwayo and was granted land in the region of the Intombe River in western Zululand. (It is entirely possible that Cetshwayo regarded him as a useful buffer between him and the Boers of the Transvaal.) Here, he took up residence on the Tafelberg, a flat-topped mountain overlooking the river. Something of a brigand, Mbelini made raids on anyone in his area, Boer and Zulu alike, accruing cattle and prisoners in the process. With the annexation of the Transvaal, Britain had also to deal with Mbelini and because Frere was convinced that the bandit chief was in the pay of the Zulu king, his surrender was included in the ultimatum. The light in which Mbelini was regarded is shown in a paragraph from a memorandum written by Sir Henry Bulwer:

Frere has been accused of chicanery by taking deliberate advantage of the length of time it took for correspondence to pass between South Africa and London to conceal his intentions from his political masters or at least defer giving them the necessary information until it was too late for them to act. The first intimation to the British government of his intention to make &#x27;demands&#x27; on the Zulu was in a private letter to Hicks Beach written on 14 October 1878. The letter only arrived in London on 16 November and by then messengers had already been despatched from Natal to the Zulu king to request the presence of a delegation at the Lower Tugela on 11 December for the purpose of receiving the Boundary Commission&#x27;s findings. Had Hicks Beach then sent off a telegraph forbidding any action other than the announcement of the boundary award, it might have arrived in South Africa just in time to prevent the ultimatum being presented. No prohibition was sent and could hardly be expected to have been, for Hicks Beach had no means of knowing the urgency of the events that were in train. Nowhere in Frere&#x27;s letter was there anything to indicate how soon he intended to act, nor was there anything to suggest how stringent his demands would be.

In January 1879, Hicks Beach wrote to Bartle Frere:

Hicks Beach had earlier admitted his helplessness with regard to the Frere&#x27;s actions in a telling note to his Prime Minister:
Frere wanted to provoke a conflict with the Zulus and in that goal he succeeded. Cetshwayo rejected the demands of 11 December, by not responding by the end of the year. A concession was granted by Bartle Frere until 11 January 1879, after which Bartle Frere deemed a state of war to exist. The British forces intended for the defense of Natal had already been on the march with the intention to attack the Zulu kingdom. On 10 January they were poised on the border. On 11 January, they crossed the border and invaded Zululand.

====Terms====
The terms included in the ultimatum were delivered to the representatives of King Cetshwayo on the banks of the Thukela river at the Ultimatum Tree on 11 December 1878. No time was specified for compliance with item 4, twenty days were allowed for compliance with items 1–3, that is, until 31 December inclusive; ten days more were allowed for compliance with the remaining demands, items 5–13. The earlier time limits were subsequently altered so that all expired on 10 January 1879.
# Surrender of Sihayo&#x27;s three sons and brother to be tried by the Natal courts.
# Payment of a fine of 500 head of cattle for the outrages committed by the above and for Cetshwayo&#x27;s delay in complying with the request of the Natal Government for the surrender of the offenders.
# Payment of 100 head of cattle for the offence committed against Messrs. Smith and Deighton.
# Surrender of the Swazi chief Umbilini and others to be named hereafter, to be tried by the Transvaal courts.
# Observance of the coronation promises.
# That the Zulu army be disbanded and the men allowed to go home.
# That the Zulu military system be discontinued and other military regulations adopted, to be decided upon after consultation with the Great Council and British Representatives.
# That every man, when he comes to man&#x27;s estate, shall be free to marry.
# All missionaries and their converts, who until 1877 lived in Zululand, shall be allowed to return and reoccupy their stations.
# All such missionaries shall be allowed to teach and any Zulu, if he chooses, shall be free to listen to their teaching.
# A British Agent shall be allowed to reside in Zululand, who will see that the above provisions are carried out.
# All disputes in which a missionary or European is concerned, shall be heard by the king in public and in presence of the Resident.
# No sentence of expulsion from Zululand shall be carried out until it has been approved by the Resident.

To ensure that there was no interference from London, Frere delayed informing the Colonial Office about his ultimatum until it was too late for it to be countermanded. The full text of his demands did not reach London until 2 January 1879. By then, Chelmsford had assembled an army of 18,000 men- redcoats, colonial volunteers and Natal African auxiliariesalong the Zululand border ready for the invasion.

===First invasion===

The pretext for the war had its origins in border disputes between the Zulu leader, Cetshwayo, and the Boers in the Transvaal region. Following a commission inquiry on the border dispute which reported in favour of the Zulu nation in July 1878, Sir Henry Bartle Frere, acting on his own, added an ultimatum to the commission meeting, much to the surprise of the Zulu representatives who then relayed it to Cetshwayo. Cetshwayo had not responded by the end of the year, so an extension was granted by Bartle Frere until 11 January 1879. Cetshwayo returned no answer to the demands of Bartle Frere, and in January 1879 a British force under Lieutenant General Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford invaded Zululand, without authorization by the British Government. The exact date of the invasion was 11 January 1879. Chelmsford crossed the Buffalo River at Rorke&#x27;s Drift, an old Irish trader&#x27;s post that had become a mission station, in command of 4,700 men of the No. 3 Column, which included 1,900 White troops and 2,400 African auxiliaries.

Lord Chelmsford, the Commander-in-Chief of British forces during the war, initially planned a five-pronged invasion of Zululand composed of over 16,500 troops in five columns and designed to encircle the Zulu army and force it to fight as he was concerned that the Zulus would avoid battle. The Zulu capital, Ulundi, was about 80 miles inside Zulu territory.

In the event, Chelmsford settled on three invading columns with the main centre column, now consisting of some 7,800 men comprising Richard Thomas Glyn&#x27;s No. 3 Column and Anthony Durnford&#x27;s No. 2 Column, under his direct command. He moved his troops from Pietermaritzburg to a forward camp at Helpmekaar, past Greytown. On 9 January 1879 they moved to Rorke&#x27;s Drift, and early on 11 January commenced crossing the Buffalo River into Zululand. Three columns were to invade Zululand, from the Lower Drift of the Tugela River (No. 1 Column under Col. Charles Pearson), Rorke&#x27;s Drift (No. 3 Column under Lord Chelmsford), and Utrecht (No. 4 Column under Col. Evelyn Wood) respectively, their objective being Ulundi, the royal capital. Durnford&#x27;s No. 2 Column was ordered to stay on the defensive near the Middle Drift of the Tugela River.

While Cetshwayo&#x27;s army numbered perhaps 35,000 men, it was essentially a militia force which could be called out in time of national danger. It had a very limited logistical capacity and could only stay in the field a few weeks before the troops would be obliged to return to their civilian duties. Zulu warriors were armed primarily with &quot;Assegai&quot; thrusting spears, known in Zulu as &quot;iklwa&quot;, clubs, some throwing spears and shields made of cowhide.

The initial entry of all three columns was unopposed. On 22 January the centre column, which had advanced from Rorke&#x27;s Drift, was encamped near Isandlwana; on the morning of that day Lord Chelmsford split his forces and moved out to support a reconnoitering party, leaving the remaining 1,300 men of the No. 3 Column under the command of Colonel Pulleine. Colonel Durnford would arrive later in the morning with 500 men of the No. 2 Column to reinforce the camp. The British were outmanoeuvred by the main Zulu army nearly 20,000 strong led by Ntshingwayo Khoza. Chelmsford was lured eastward with much of his centre column by a Zulu diversionary force while the main Impi attacked his camp. Chelmsford&#x27;s decision not to set up the British camp defensively, contrary to established doctrine, and ignoring information that the Zulus were close at hand were decisions that the British were soon to regret. The ensuing Battle of Isandlwana was the greatest victory that the Zulu kingdom would enjoy during the war. The British centre column was wrecked and its camp annihilated with heavy casualties as well as the loss of all its supplies, ammunition and transport. The defeat left Chelmsford no choice but to hastily retreat out of Zululand. In the battle&#x27;s aftermath, a party of some 4,000 Zulu reserves mounted an unauthorised raid on the nearby British Army border post of Rorke&#x27;s Drift and were driven off after 10 hours of ferocious fighting on 23 January.

While the British central column under Chelmsford&#x27;s command was thus engaged, the right flank column on the coast, under Colonel Charles Pearson, crossed the Tugela River, skirmished with a Zulu impi that was attempting to set up an ambush at the Inyezane River, and advanced as far as the deserted missionary station of Eshowe, which he set about fortifying. On learning of the disaster at Isandlwana, Pearson made plans to withdraw back beyond the Tugela River. However, before he had decided whether or not to put these plans into effect, the Zulu army managed to cut off his supply lines, and the Siege of Eshowe had begun.

Meanwhile, the left flank column at Utrecht, under Colonel Evelyn Wood, had originally been charged with occupying the Zulu tribes of north-west Zululand and preventing them from interfering with the British central column&#x27;s advance on Ulundi. To this end Wood set up camp at Tinta&#x27;s Kraal, just 10 miles south of Hlobane Mountain, where a force of 4,000 Zulus had been spotted. He planned to attack them on 24 January, but on learning of the disaster at Isandlwana, he decided to withdraw back to the Kraal. Thus one month after the British invasion, only their left flank column remained militarily effective, and it was too weak to conduct a campaign alone. The first invasion of Zululand had been a failure.
It had never been Cetshwayo&#x27;s intention to invade Natal, but to simply fight within the boundaries of the Zulu kingdom. Chelmsford used the next two months to regroup and build a fresh invading force with the initial intention of relieving Pearson at Eshowe. The British government rushed seven regiments of reinforcements to Natal, along with two artillery batteries.

On 12 March, an armed escort of stores marching to Luneberg, was defeated by about 500 Zulus at the Battle of Intombe; the British force suffered 80 killed and all the stores were lost. The first troops arrived at Durban on 7 March. On the 29th a column under Lord Chelmsford consisting of a total of 5,670 men (3,390 Europeans and 2,280 Africans) marched to the relief of Eshowe, with entrenched camps being formed each night.

Chelmsford ordered Sir Evelyn Wood&#x27;s troops to attack the abaQulusi Zulu stronghold in Hlobane. Lieutenant Colonel Redvers Buller, led the attack on Hlobane on 28 March. However, as the Zulu main army of 20,000 men approached to help their besieged tribesmen, the British force began a retreat which turned into a rout and were pursued by 1,000 Zulus of the abaQulusi who inflicted some 225 casualties on the British force.

The next day 20,000 Zulu warriors attacked Wood&#x27;s 2,068 men in a well-fortified camp at Kambula, apparently without Cetshwayo&#x27;s permission. The British held them off in the Battle of Kambula and after five hours of heavy attacks the Zulus withdrew with heavy losses but were pursued by British mounted troops, who killed many more fleeing and wounded warriors. British losses amounted to 83 (28 killed and 55 wounded), while the Zulus lost up to 2,000 killed. The effect of the battle of Kambula on the Zulu army was severe. Their commander Mnyamana Buthelezi tried to get the regiments to return to Ulundi but many demoralised warriors simply went home.

While Woods was thus engaged, Chelmsford&#x27;s column was marching on Eshowe. On 2 April this force was attacked en route at Gingindlovu, the Zulu being repulsed. Their losses were heavy, estimated at 1,200, but the British suffered only two dead and 52 wounded and the next day they relieved Pearson&#x27;s men. They evacuated Eshowe on 5 April after which the Zulu forces burned it down.

===Second invasion===
The new start of the larger, heavily reinforced second invasion was not promising for the British. Despite their successes at Kambula, Gingindlovu and Eshowe, they were right back where they had started from at the beginning of January. Nevertheless, Chelmsford had a pressing reason to proceed with haste – Sir Garnet Wolseley was being sent to replace him, and he wanted to inflict a decisive defeat on Cetshwayo&#x27;s forces before then. With yet more reinforcements arriving, soon to total 16,000 British and 7,000 Native troops, Chelmsford reorganised his forces and again advanced into Zululand in June, this time with extreme caution building fortified camps all along the way to prevent any repeat of Isandlwana.

One of the early British casualties was the exiled pretender to the French throne, Prince Imperial Eugene Bonaparte, who had volunteered to serve in the British Army and was killed on 1 June while out with a reconnoitering party.

Cetshwayo, knowing that the newly reinforced British would be a formidable opponent, attempted to negotiate a peace treaty. Chelmsford was not open to negotiations, as he wished to restore his reputation before Wolseley relieved him of command, and he proceeded to the royal kraal of Ulundi, intending to defeat the main Zulu army. On 4 July, the armies clashed at the Battle of Ulundi, and Cetshwayo&#x27;s forces were decisively defeated.

==Aftermath==
After the battle of Ulundi, the Zulu army dispersed, most of the leading chiefs tendered their submission, and Cetshwayo became a fugitive. Wolseley, having relieved Chelmsford after Ulundi, took over the final operations. On 28 August the king was captured and sent to Cape Town. It is said that scouts spotted the water-carriers of the king, distinctive because the water was carried above, not upon, their heads. His deposition was formally announced to the Zulu. Wolseley wasted no time in discarding Bartle Frere&#x27;s confederation scheme and drew up a new scheme which divided Zululand into thirteen chiefdoms headed by compliant chiefs which ensured that the Zulus would no longer unite under a single king and made internal divisions and civil wars inevitable. The dynasty of Shaka was deposed, and the Zulu country portioned among eleven Zulu chiefs, including Zibhebhu, John Robert Dunn, a white adventurer, and Hlubi, a Basuto chief allied to the British in the war.

Chelmsford received a Knight Grand Cross of Bath, largely because of Ulundi. However, he was severely criticized by the Horse Guards investigation and would never serve in the field again. Bartle Frere was relegated to a minor post in Cape Town.

Following the conclusion of the Anglo-Zulu War, Bishop Colenso interceded on behalf of Cetshwayo with the British government and succeeded in getting him released from Robben Island and returned to Zululand in 1883.

A Resident (Melmoth Osborn) was appointed to be the channel of communication between the chiefs and the British government. This arrangement led to much bloodshed and disturbance, and in 1882 the British government determined to restore Cetshwayo to power. In the meantime, however, blood feuds had been engendered between the chiefs Usibepu (Zibebu) and Hamu on the one side and the tribes who supported the ex-king and his family on the other. Cetshwayo&#x27;s party (who now became known as the Usuthu) suffered severely at the hands of the two chiefs, who were aided by a band of white freebooters.

When Cetshwayo was restored Usibepu was left in possession of his territory, while Dunn&#x27;s land and that of the Basuto chief (the country between the Tugela River and the Umhlatuzi, i.e., adjoining Natal) was constituted a reserve, in which locations were to be provided for Zulu unwilling to serve the restored king. This new arrangement proved as futile as had Wolseley&#x27;s. Usibepu, having created a formidable force of well-armed and trained warriors, and being left in independence on the borders of Cetshwayo&#x27;s territory, viewed with displeasure the re-installation of his former king, and Cetshwayo was desirous of humbling his relative. A collision very soon took place; Usibepu&#x27;s forces were victorious, and on 22 July 1883, led by a troop of mounted Boer mercenary troops, he made a sudden descent upon Cetshwayo&#x27;s kraal at Ulundi, which he destroyed, massacring such of the inmates of both sexes as could not save themselves by flight. The king escaped, though wounded, into Nkandla forest. After appeals to Melmoth Osborn he moved to Eshowe, where he died soon after.

Because of the unusually high amount of casualties the British suffered as a result of combat, especially given that they were facing a preindustrial enemy that was considered racially inferior, the British war effort was widely seen as a poor showing. British casualties resulting from combat were three times higher than those from disease, which was generally a larger killer in British colonial conflicts.

<text>William Howarth (November 26, 1940 – June 6, 2023) was an American writer and professor emeritus at Princeton University. He published fourteen books and also wrote for such national periodicals as National Geographic, Smithsonian, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and The American Scholar.

Howarth was born in Minneapolis and grew up in Springfield, Illinois, where his father Nelson Howarth was a progressive, civil-rights mayor. William Howarth received a B.A. from the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana and an M.A. and Ph.D. in English from the University of Virginia.

Howarth taught at Princeton from 1966, offering over 60 undergraduate and graduate courses, from &quot;Moby-Dick Unbound&quot; to &quot;Race and Place&quot; and &quot;Darwin in our Time.&quot; In 1968 he helped create Princeton&#x27;s program in Afro-American studies. His teaching has spanned English, American Studies, Environmental Studies, the Center for the Study of Religion, the Davis Center for Historical Studies, and the Freshman Seminars. He advised 100 Ph.D. dissertations and 256 senior theses, and won numerous university awards for research, teaching, and alumni education.

Howarth began his career as a specialist in American literary manuscripts and textual criticism, and in 1972 he became editor in chief of &quot;The Writings of Henry D. Thoreau&quot;. In 1974-75 he served as 21st president of the Thoreau Society. He published eight books on Thoreau, covering his studies of maps, landscapes, and North American travels. His account of Thoreau as writer, &quot;The Book of Concord&quot;, is the first critical history of Thoreau&#x27;s two-million-word &quot;Journal&quot;.

Howarth later expanded his studies in literary nonfiction to include the fields of autobiography, journalism, trans-Atlantic romanticism, and the literature of place and travel. His critical anthology, &quot;The John McPhee Reader&quot;, is the first study of John McPhee as literary artist, and it remains a standard text in journalism history.

Howarth was a founding member of the Princeton Environmental Institute and among the earliest scholars to define and explore the field of literary ecocriticism. His essay &quot;Some Principles of Ecocriticism&quot; describes the origins and evolution of this field from early work in ecology, ethics, language, criticism, geography, natural and social sciences, history, literature, American studies, and media. He long served on the editorial boards of Environmental History, Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment, and was chairman of the board for The Center for American Places.

His first venture into fiction, the historical novel &quot;Deep Creek&quot;, written with Anne Matthews under the joint pen name Dana Hand, was selected by the &quot;Washington Post&quot; as one of the best novels of 2010.

Howarth died on June 6, 2023, at the age of 82.

<doc id="158154" wikidata="Q2039185" url="?curid=158154" title="Manglish">
<text>Manglish is an informal form of Malaysian English with features of an English-based creole principally used in Malaysia. It is heavily influenced by the main languages of the country, Malay, Tamil, and varieties of Chinese. It is not one of the official languages spoken in Malaysia.

Manglish spoken in West Malaysia is very similar to and highly mutually intelligible with Singlish, a creole of similar roots. There is little distinction between the two creoles except that Manglish vocabulary contains more Malay words while Singlish contains more words of Hokkien (Min Nan) and Teochew origin.

The vocabulary of Manglish consists of words originating from English, Malay, Hokkien, Mandarin, Cantonese, Tamil, and, to a lesser extent, various other European languages and Arabic, while Manglish syntax resembles southern varieties of Chinese. Also, elements of American and Australian slang have come through from imported television series.

The Malaysian Manglish is sometimes known as Rojak or Bahasa Rojak, but it differs from the Rojak language by the use of English as the base language. The term &quot;rojak&quot; derives from &quot;mixture&quot; or &quot;eclectic mix&quot; in colloquial Malay. The East Coast versions (Kelantan and Terengganu) of Manglish may differ greatly from that of West Coast Malaysian speakers.

Besides mixing multiple languages, Manglish includes mixing the syntax of each language. Hence, Malaysians often speak English in Malay or Chinese syntax. Idioms, proverbs and phrases are also often translated directly to English from Malay, Chinese, and Tamil. The accent and vocabulary used is highly dependent on the formality of the context and language dominance of the speaker. The speaker would also vary the quantity of Manglish spoken depending on their counterpart.

Foreigners are generally unable to understand Manglish as it is a mix of so many languages and multiple language rules, it is understandable only to Malaysians. Many Malaysians are able to speak their native language fluently but choose to speak Manglish in their daily lives and conversations.

==History==
The term &quot;Manglish&quot; is first recorded in 1989. Other colloquial portmanteau words for Manglish include (chronologically): &quot;Malish&quot; (1992), &quot;Malaylish&quot; (1992), &quot;Malenglish&quot; (1994), &quot;Malglish&quot; (1997), &quot;Malayglish&quot; (2005), and &quot;Malanglish&quot; (2013).

Manglish shares substantial linguistic similarities with Singlish in Singapore, although distinctions can be made, particularly in vocabulary.

Initially, &quot;Singlish&quot; and &quot;Manglish&quot; were essentially the same language, when both Singapore and the states now comprising Peninsular Malaysia were under various forms of direct and indirect British rule, though not forming a single administrative unit except between 1963 and 1965. (See Malaya.) In old British Malaya, English was the language of the British administration whilst Malay was the lingua franca of the street. Even Chinese people would speak Malay when addressing other Chinese people who did not speak the same Chinese language.

English as spoken in Malaysia is based on British English and called Malaysian English. British spelling is generally followed. 

Since 1968, Malay has been the country&#x27;s sole official language. While English is widely used, many Malay words have become part of common usage in informal English or Manglish. An example is suffixing sentences with &quot;lah&quot;, as in, &quot;Don&#x27;t be so worried-lah&quot;, which is usually used to present a sentence as rather light-going and not so serious; the suffix has no specific meaning. However, Chinese languages also make abundant use of the suffix &quot;lah&quot; and there is some disagreement as to which language it was originally borrowed from. There is also a strong influence from Malay, Hokkien, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Tamil, which are other major languages spoken in Malaysia. Manglish also uses some archaic British terms from the era of British rule (see &quot;gostan&quot; and &quot;outstation&quot; below).

==Malaysian English and Manglish==

In Malaysia, Manglish is considered to be a less formal form of Malaysian English which has features of a pidgin or a creole, rather than a fully-fledged creole language. While all varieties of English used by Malaysians may be considered Malaysian English, some make a distinction between Malaysian English and Manglish; Malaysian English being a form of English that largely follows the standard rules of English grammar but with some local characteristics, while Manglish is a pidgin that does not follow the grammatical rules or structure of English. Many Malaysians however tend to refer to the colloquialisms used by those taught in English-medium school as Malaysian English, while some argued for the basilect form or pidgin as the &quot;real&quot; Malaysian English. At the lexical level, limited lexis is used and consequently, a number of words serve a variety of functions, giving extended meanings not normally accepted in standard British English.

There are some differences of contemporary words used between Malaysia and the United Kingdom. The use of Manglish is discouraged at schools, where only Malaysian Standard English is taught.

The term Malaysian English is not used in any official context except for the ever-changing school curriculum modules in attempts to improve the command of English but without going into advanced lessons.

It is however, possible to speak Manglish without substituting English words with those from another language.

==Influences from other languages==
Speakers of Manglish from the country&#x27;s different ethnic groups tend to intersperse varying amounts of expressions or interjections from their mother tongue – be it Malay, Chinese or one of the Indian languages – which, in some cases, qualifies as a form of code-switching.

Verbs or adjectives from other languages often have English affixes, and conversely sentences may be constructed using English words in another language&#x27;s syntax. People tend to translate phrases directly from their first languages into English, for instance, &quot;on the light&quot; instead of &quot;&quot;turn&quot; on the light&quot;. Or sometimes, &quot;open the light&quot;, translated directly from Chinese.

Aside from borrowing lexicons and expressions at varying levels depending on the speaker&#x27;s mother tongue, Malay, Chinese and Tamil also influence Manglish at a sentence formation level.

For example, Chinese languages do not mark the verb for tenses. Instead, information about time is often acquired through contextual knowledge or time-specific markers such as &#x27;yesterday&#x27;, &#x27;today&#x27; and &#x27;tomorrow&#x27;. This is also replicated in Manglish with sentences like &#x27;She go to the shop yesterday&#x27; and &#x27;I come here every day&#x27;.

The Chinese also tend to speak Manglish with staccato feel as it is syllable-timed, unlike English which is stress-timed.

===Duplication of words===

Chinese, Malay and Tamil languages often duplicate words for different functions such as to show pluralisation, emphasis or repetition. Similarly, this has influenced the duplication of English words when speaking Manglish, especially when placing emphasis on certain words or to show pluralisation.

Some examples include:

* (Don&#x27;t be too noisy or I&#x27;ll discipline you later.)
* (Was the boy you dated the very short one we met at the party?)

==Words and grammar==

Manglish is topic-prominent, like Chinese and Malay. This means that Manglish sentences often begin with a topic (or a known reference of the conversation), followed by a comment (or new information). Compared to Standard English, the semantic relationship between topic and comment is not important; moreover, nouns, verbs, adverbs, and even entire subject-verb-object phrases can all serve as the topic:
*&quot;That school Chinese orchestra very good one.&quot; (The Chinese orchestra of that school is very good.)
*&quot;She play violin very bad leh.&quot; (She&#x27;s very bad at playing the violin.)
*&quot;Yesterday she also give homework, too much lah.&quot; (She also gave homework yesterday, there&#x27;s too much.)
*&quot;Discussed finish already.&quot; (We&#x27;ve finished discussing already.)
The above constructions can be translated analogously into Malay and Chinese, with little change to the word order.

The topic can be omitted when the context is clear, or shared between clauses. This results in constructions that appear to be missing a subject to a speaker of Standard English, and so called PRO-drop utterances may be regarded as a diagnostic feature of Manglish. For example:
*&quot;Stupid lah.&quot; (This is stupid.)
*&quot;Why don&#x27;t want come?&quot; (Why don&#x27;t you want to come?)

===Nouns===
*&quot;ang mo&quot; – White people, from Hokkien &quot;red hair&quot; (). Used by Chinese, while the Malays use Mat Salleh {see below}. Gweilo may be used in Cantonese.
*&quot;chop&quot; – stamp (also used as verb). From Malay &#x27;cop&#x27; meaning stamp e.g. &quot;Put your company chop on the receipt&quot;.

They also usually sport brightly coloured hair. &quot;La-la&quot; can also be used to describe the things these girls are known to wear. E.g. &quot;That salegirl was very la-la&quot;/&quot;The clothes are so la-la.&quot; These days, the term is also used to describe guys who sports outstanding/bizarre hairstyle and wear outstanding clothes and accessories resulting in bad taste as well. &quot;la-la zai&quot; and &quot;la-la mui&quot; is commonly used to make distinctions between the genders, with the former referring to guys and the latter referring to girls. The &quot;la-la&#x27;s&quot; also feature rather punkish attitudes.

*&quot;Abuden?&quot; - Combination of Hokkien &quot;A-bo&quot;, meaning &quot;if not&quot; in English, and the word &quot;then&quot;. It is also equivalent to simply saying &quot;Obviously&quot;. Usually used a sarcastic response to an obvious observation or question.
*&quot;Adoi&quot; - exclamation like an &quot;Ouch!&quot; From Malay.
*&quot;Aiya&quot; - exclamation to express surprise or dismay. From Chinese. e.g. &quot;Aiya, it&#x27;s raining leh, cannot go out liao.&quot; (Aiya, it&#x27;s raining, we cannot go out anymore.)

(E.g. Today he &quot;die&quot; because of that loan shark &quot;(Today, he is in trouble because of the loan sharks.&quot;). 
*&quot;Geli&quot;- meaning disgusting. Example:&quot;Eh,this thing very geli eh!&quot;(Hey,this thing is very disgusting!)

===Grammar===
*&quot;(Subject + predicate), is it?&quot; – this is often used as a question. &quot;It&quot; doesn&#x27;t refer to the subject, but rather to the entire preceding clause (&quot;Is it so?&quot;) This is comparable to the French phrase &quot;n&#x27;est-ce pas?&quot; (literally &quot;isn&#x27;t it?&quot;) and the German usage of &quot;..., oder?&quot; (literally &quot;..., or?&quot;)

===Phrases===
*&quot;Open collar, pocket no dollar&quot; – expression reflecting linkage between extravagant appearance and persona, and illusion of wealth
* &quot;That&#x27;s why&quot; - expression used to express agreement with a statement (Example: &quot;It&#x27;s so hot today!&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s why!&quot;)

== Particles ==
=== &quot;Lah&quot; ===
The ubiquitous word lah ( or ), used at the end of a sentence, can also be described as a particle that simultaneously asserts a position and entices solidarity.

Note that &#x27;lah&#x27; is often written after a space for clarity, but there is never a pause before it. This is because originally in Malay, &#x27;lah&#x27; is appended to the end of the word and is not a separate word by itself.

In Malay, &#x27;lah&#x27; is used to change a verb into a command or to soften its tone, particularly when usage of the verb may seem impolite. For example, &quot;to drink&quot; is &quot;minum&quot;, but &quot;Here, drink!&quot; is &quot;minumlah&quot;. Similarly, &#x27;lah&#x27; is frequently used with imperatives in Singlish, such as the command, &quot;Drink lah!&quot; (Come on, drink!). &#x27;Lah&#x27; also occurs frequently with &quot;Yah&quot; and &quot;No&quot; (hence &quot;Yah lah&quot; and &quot;No lah&quot;), resulting in a less brusque sound, thus facilitating the flow of conversation.

It is also possible that Lah comes from Cantonese. In Cantonese, Lah (啦) is placed at the end of a sentence in imperatives making it sound more like a request than an order.

It might have Tamil origin as well. Lah is still used widely in Southern Tamil Nadu (Thirunelveli, Kanyakumari district) in the same manner. Tamil is said to be more pure in this region than northern Tamil Nadu and had ancient trade link with south east Asia.

Lah is often used with brusque, short, negative responses:
*Don&#x27;t have lah! (Brusque response to, &quot;Lend me some money, can?&quot;)
*Don&#x27;t know already lah! (Brusque response to someone fumbling with an explanation. Mostly by Chinese.)

Lah is also used for reassurance:
*Don&#x27;t worry, he can do it one lah – Don&#x27;t worry, he can get it done.
*It&#x27;s okay lah – It&#x27;s all right.

Lah can also be used to emphasize items in a spoken list, appearing after each item in the list but is not commonly used in this context. 
*They got sell Nasi Lemak lah, Roti Canai lah, Chapatti lah; Everything got lah!

Although lah can appear nearly anywhere, it cannot appear with a yes–no question. Another particle should be used instead. For example:
*Where are you ar? (This is especially of Chinese origin.)

The Chinese influence in Manglish, however, can be seen among other races in Malaysia, especially when conversing with Chinese-speaking people. This principle can be generally applied to all forms of non-standard English spoken in Malaysia.

===&quot;Loh&quot;===
&#x27;Loh&#x27; or &#x27;lo&#x27; (囉) is used in the same context as &quot;lah&quot;. It serves as a final particle to intensify a decision that is definitive and irrevocable.

In most cases, loh is used in direct response to a question or query with the connotation that the respondent is somewhat impatient or annoying because the person thinks that the answer is so obvious that the question should not have been raised from the start. In fact, the questioner might have no idea beforehand about the rude reply that would be shot back to him/her, though it can be argued that the word &#x27;lah&#x27; might deliver stronger emotions from the speaker.

For example, to show argumentative mood or making emphasis, one would say, &quot;You lo (it&#x27;s your fault), if it&#x27;s not for you we wouldn&#x27;t be in trouble now!&quot; and possibly in response, the other would say, &quot;Eh, I never forced you to follow me here loh!&quot; Another example is &quot;traffic jam loh!&quot; when asked by a friend why he or she is late to an occasion.

Sometimes, loh is used to express insincerity while speaking, for instance when one says &quot;sorry loh&quot; or &quot;thank you loh&quot;.

However, in some cases, the use of loh is only intended to give an advice without any notion of impatience. Examples: &quot;I think he&#x27;s being unreasonable loh&quot; or &quot;if you ask you will know loh&quot;.

In lesser cases, using &quot;loh&quot; can make some emphasis or convey a jovial atmosphere. For example, &quot;I came all the way for you loh&quot; and &quot;Nah, that one loh, that fat chubby one in a yellow shirt loh&quot;.

&quot;Loh&quot; is mostly used by the Chinese community in Malaysia, because of its Cantonese origin.

===&quot;Meh&quot;===
&quot;Meh&quot; is commonly used at the end of a question. It is usually used with a sense of confidence in his or her own statement but the hint of doubt towards the other person. For example,&quot; I like her, can not meh?&quot; (meaning &quot;I like her. What&#x27;s wrong with that?&quot;).

&quot;Meh&quot; is of Cantonese origin (咩). In Cantonese or Hakka, &quot;meh&quot; is a final particle that transforms statements into questions that indicate doubt or surprise.

==Phonetic Features of Spoken Manglish==

Manglish has its unique set of features when spoken by native Malaysians that are distinct from the standard variety of English. Though very similar to spoken Singlish, the two should not be considered the same variety.
Manglish is non-rhotic
*Sometimes referred to as r-fullness/r-lessness, spoken Manglish is similar to the standard variety of English in Singapore and Britain, in that the final /r/ consonant is dropped during speech. Words such as &#x27;water&#x27; and &#x27;player&#x27; are transcribed as /wɒtə/ and /plejə/ respectively.

There is no distinction between long and short vowels
*In Manglish, long vowels such as /ɑː/ and /ɜː/ are usually pronounced no differently from /ʌ/ and /ə/ respectively. For instance, &#x27;father&#x27; is pronounced as /fʌdə/ instead of /fɑːðə/.

Diphthongs are reduced to monophthongs
*Diphthongs are usually reduced. For instance, /eɪ/ is reduced to /e/ in words such as &#x27;later&#x27;. So instead of /leɪtə/, Manglish speakers tend to say /letə/. As another example, &#x27;so&#x27; and &#x27;go&#x27; are pronounced as /so/ and /go/ instead of /soʊ/ and /goʊ/.

Dental fricatives /ð/ and /θ/ are pronounced as dental plosives instead.
*Dental fricatives are often not enunciated in Manglish the way it is in standard varieties of English. Instead, they are pronounced as plosives. Hence, words like &#x27;this&#x27; /ðɪs/ is pronounced as &#x27;dis&#x27; /dɪs/ (voiced), and &#x27;thing&#x27; /θɪŋ/ is pronounced as /tɪŋ/ (voiceless).

Omission of final consonants
*Final consonants of words are often left out in spoken Manglish. Some examples include &#x27;dun&#x27; (don&#x27;t), &#x27;fac&#x27; (fact), &#x27;adap&#x27; (adapt).

==Usage of Manglish on the Internet==

The use of Manglish can be commonly found on the internet, especially amongst bloggers.

==Miscellaneous==

&quot;There is&quot;/&quot;there are&quot; and &quot;has&quot;/&quot;have&quot; are both expressed using got, so that sentences can be translated in either way back into British / American English. This is equivalent to the Chinese 有 yǒu (to have):
*&quot;Got question?&quot; – Is there a question? / Do you have a question?
*&quot;Yesterday ar, East Coast Park got so many people!&quot; – There were so many people at East Coast Park yesterday. / East Coast Park had so many people [there] yesterday.
*&quot;This bus got air-con or not?&quot; – Is there air-conditioning on this bus? / Does this bus have air-conditioning?
*&quot;Where got!?&quot; – lit. Where is there [this]?, also more loosely, What are you talking about? or Where did you get that idea?; generic response to any accusation. Derived from Malay sentence &quot;Mana ada&quot; – &#x27;Mana&#x27; (Where) &#x27;ada&#x27; (got) and also from Chinese sentence &quot;哪里有&quot; – &#x27;哪里&#x27; (Where) &#x27;有&#x27; (got).

Can is used extensively as both a question particle and an answer particle. The negative is cannot:
*&quot;Gimme lah, ok or not?&quot; – (Give it to me, OK?)
*&quot;Can!&quot; – (Sure!)
*&quot;Can!&quot; – (Yes, that is possible)
*&quot;Cannot.&quot; – (No way.)

===Pronouns===
There is a tendency to drop referential pronouns (I, you) in Manglish. This is due to direct translations of Chinese and Malay in which it is unnecessary. For example, &quot;you&quot; and &quot;I&quot; in the following sentences is omittable.

*&quot;(you) never do anything right&quot; (None of the things that you do is correct.)
*&quot;(you) always also cannot, cannot, cannot&quot; (You always prohibit (me) from doing something)
*&quot;你可以做这个吗？&quot; (Can you do this?)
:&quot;可以。&quot; ((I) can.)
*&quot;Kau boleh buat ini ke?&quot; (Can you do this?)
:&quot;Tak boleh.&quot; ((I) cannot.)

===Noun phrases===
There is a tendency to use plural forms for uncountable nouns such as &#x27;staffs&#x27;, &#x27;equipments&#x27;, &#x27;informations&#x27;, &#x27;criterias&#x27; and &#x27;phenomenons&#x27;. Additionally, some articles are often dropped.

==Comparisons with Singlish==

Manglish and Singlish share a common history and some common characteristics. The difference between Manglish and Singlish can be subtle and sometimes difficult to be distinguish even among the locals. However, Manglish is markedly more influenced by the Malay language, with the majority population in Malaysia being the Ethnic Malays; while Singlish is more influenced by Hokkien, with the majority population being the Ethnic Chinese. For example, &quot;kena&quot; (a Malay word, somewhat of a prefix added for the sake of turning an action verb into passive form) might be more often used in Manglish; while Singlish more frequently uses words like &quot;liao&quot; (meaning &quot;already&quot; in Hokkien), &quot;nia&quot; (meaning &quot;only&quot; in Hokkien). However, referring the aforementioned example, &quot;kena&quot; is also used in Singlish and &quot;liao&quot; in Manglish, only to a less extent. This shows the huge influences on these two languages on each other as well. There is no difference between the two when heard from foreigner&#x27;s ears.

==Other usage==

*The word &#x27;Manglish&#x27; is also used to describe the English spoken by Malayalam speakers from the Kerala state in India having a Malayalam accent, mainly by those who have studied in Malayalam-medium schools. This is also propagated by Malayalam media.
*Manglish (manga in English) is also the name of an interactive cartoon feature in the &quot;Mainichi Daily News&quot;, Japan&#x27;s major English-language online newspaper. Manga, or Japanese comics, are displayed on the Web site in their original format, but English translations of the Japanese characters can be seen by mousing over the speech balloons.

<text>Intensive pig farming, also known as pig [[Intensive animal farming|factory farming]], is the primary method of pig production, in which grower pigs are housed indoors in group-housing or straw-lined sheds in establishments also known as piggeries, whilst pregnant sows are housed in gestation crates or pens and give birth in farrowing crates.

The use of gestation crates for pregnant sows has lowered birth production costs; Gestation crates or individual stalls are used as a way to nurture the animals and protect them first during pregnancy. Because the animals are vulnerable during this time, with some sows more aggressive than others, the practice of separating the animals in crates keeps them from fighting and injuring each other. In addition, the case has also been made that crates make it easier for hog farmers to monitor individual sow health and administer vaccines as needed. Many of the world&#x27;s largest producers of pigs (US, China, and Mexico) use gestation crates. The European Union has banned the use of gestation crates after the fourth week of pregnancy. Intensive pig farmers often cut off tails, testes or teeth of pigs without anaesthetic. Although combined use of an anesthetic and analgesic appears to be the most effective method for controlling pain associated with surgical castration, regulatory requirements and cost remain obstacles to practical application. Use of pharmaceuticals can burden producers with direct and indirect costs; the latter are associated with time delays and a potential need for additional veterinary assistance. Extra-label use of anesthetics and analgesics, while an option, is not ideal. Knowledge of effectiveness is not as great as it is for drugs approved for particular species and purposes. Extra-label use can also discourage research and development necessary to approve drugs for specific purposes.

The environmental impacts of pig farming include problems posed to drinking water and algal bloom events.

==Description==


Intensive piggeries are generally large warehouse-like buildings or barns with little exposure to sunlight or the outdoors. Most pigs are officially entitled to less than one square meter of space each. Indoor pig systems allow many more pigs to be monitored than historical methods, ensuring lowered cost, and increased productivity. Buildings are ventilated and their temperature regulated.

Most domestic pig varieties are susceptible to sunburn and heat stress, and all pigs lack sweat glands and cannot cool themselves. Pigs have a limited tolerance to high temperatures and heat stress can lead to death. Maintaining a more specific temperature within the pig-tolerance range also maximizes growth and growth-to-feed ratio. Indoor piggeries have allowed pig farming to be undertaken in countries or areas with unsuitable climate or soil for outdoor pig raising. In an intensive operation, pigs no longer need access to a wallow (mud), which is their natural cooling mechanism. Intensive piggeries control temperature through ventilation or drip water systems.

The way animals are housed in intensive systems varies, and depending on economic viability, dry or open time for sows can sometimes be spent in indoor pens or outdoor pens or pastures.

The pigs begin life in a farrowing or gestation crate, a small pen with a central cage, designed to allow the piglets to feed from their mother, the sow, while preventing her from moving around, crushing her children, and reducing aggression. The crates are so small that the pigs cannot turn around.

Artificial insemination is much more common than natural mating, as it allows up to 30-40 female pigs to be impregnated from a single boar. Workers collect the semen by masturbating the boars, then insert it into the sows via a raised catheter known as a pork stork. Boars are still physically used to excite the females prior to insemination, but are prevented from actually mating.

When confirmed pregnant, sows are moved to farrowing crates, with litter, and will spend their time in gestation crates from before farrowing until weaning. Injections with a high availability iron solution often are given, as sow&#x27;s milk is low in iron. Vitamin D supplements are also given to compensate for the lack of sunlight. As the sows&#x27; bodies become less capable of handling the large litter sizes encouraged by the industry, the frequency of stillborn piglets generally increases with each litter. These high litter sizes have doubled the death rates of sows, and as many as 25%-50% of sow deaths have been caused by prolapse, the collapse of the sow&#x27;s rectum, vagina, or uterus. Pig breeders repeat the cycle of impregnation and confinement for about 3 to 5 years or until the sow succumbs to her injuries, at which point she is then slaughtered for low-grade meat such as pies, pasties and sausage meat.

Of the piglets born alive, 10% to 18% will not make it to weaning age, succumbing to disease, starvation, dehydration, or being accidentally crushed by their trapped mothers. This death toll includes the runts, unusually small piglets who are considered economically unviable and killed by staff, typically by blunt trauma to the head.

Piglets often have the following performed: castration, earmarking, tattooing for litter identification, tail docking, teeth clipping to prevent cannibalism, instability, aggression, and tail biting that is induced by the cramped environment. Because anesthetic is not legally mandated and often economically unviable, these invasive procedures are usually done without any pain killers. While wild piglets remain with their mothers for around 12 to 14 weeks, farmed piglets are weaned and removed from their mothers at between two and five weeks old. They are then placed in sheds, nursery barns or directly to growout barns. While capable of living 10–12 years, most pigs are slaughtered when they are 5–6 months old.

Indoor systems allow for the easy collection of waste. In an indoor intensive pig farm, manure can be managed through a lagoon system or other waste-management system. However, waste smell remains a problem which is difficult to manage. Pigs in the wild or on open farmland are naturally clean animals.

==Statistics==

In the UK there are around 11,000 pig farms. Approximately 1,400 of these units house more than 1,000 pigs and contain about 85% of the total UK pig population. Because of this, the vast majority of the pork products sold in the UK come from intensive farms. 

In Australia, there were around 50,000 pig farms in Australia in the 1960s. Today, there are fewer than 1,400, and yet the total number of pigs bred and slaughtered for food has increased. As of 2015, 49 farms housed 60% of the country&#x27;s total pig population.

In the United States, three-quarters of pork comes from large operations with 5,000 or more pigs. The animals are most often kept in crowded confinement buildings without fresh air or sunshine. 

==Environmental impacts==

Intensive pig farming adversely affects the surrounding environment, mainly driven by the spread of feces and waste to surrounding neighborhoods, polluting air and water with toxic waste particles.

==Regulation==
Many countries have introduced laws to regulate treatment of intensively farmed pigs. However, there is no legal definition for free-range pigs, so retailers can label pork products as free-range without having to adhere to any standards or guidelines. Only 3% of UK pigs spend their entire lives outdoors.

===European Union===
As of 2016, The European Union legislation has required that pigs be given environmental enrichment, specifically they must have permanent access to a sufficient quantity of material to enable proper investigation and manipulation activities.

Under the legislation tail docking may only be used as a last resort. The law provides that farmers must first take measures to improve the pigs&#x27; conditions and, only where these have failed to prevent tail biting, may they tail dock.

===United States===
As of 2023, ten states have banned the use of gestation crates: Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, and Rhode Island. Proposition 12, a California ballot measure passed in 2018, also bans the sale of whole, uncooked pork cuts throughout the state if the producers are noncompliant with the ban, affecting both in-state and out-of-state pig farmers.

Discharge from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) is regulated by the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In 2003, EPA revised the Clean Water Act to include permitting requirements and discharge limitations for CAFOs. , EPA revised the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) by requiring CAFOs to apply for permits before they can discharge manure.

The federal Humane Slaughter Act requires pigs to be stunned before slaughter, although compliance and enforcement is questioned. There is concern from animal liberation and welfare groups that the laws have not resulted in a prevention of animal suffering and that there are &quot;repeated violations of the Humane Slaughter Act at dozens of slaughterhouses&quot;.

==Criticism ==

===Dispute regarding farming methods===
Intensive piggeries have been negatively contrasted with free range systems. Such systems usually refer not to a group-pen or shedding system, but to outdoor farming systems. Those that support outdoor systems usually do so on the grounds that they are more animal friendly and allow pigs to experience natural activities (e.g., wallowing in mud, relating to young, rooting soil). Outdoor systems are usually less economically productive due to increased space requirements and higher morbidity, (though, when dealing with the killing of piglets and other groups of swine, the methods are the same.) They also have a range of environmental impacts, such as denitrification of soil and erosion. Outdoor pig farming may also have welfare implications, for example, pigs kept outside may get sunburnt and are more susceptible to heat stress than in indoor systems, where air conditioning or similar can be used. Outdoor pig farming may also increase the incidence of worms and parasites in pigs. Management of these problems depends on local conditions, such as geography, climate, and the availability of skilled staff.

In certain environmental conditions – for example, a temperate climate – outdoor pig farming of these breeds is possible. However, there are many other breeds of pig suited to outdoor rearing, as they have been used in this way for centuries, such as Gloucester Old Spot and Oxford Forest. Following the UK ban of sow stalls, the British Pig Executive indicates that the pig farming industry in the UK has declined. The increase in production costs has led to British pig-products being more expensive than those from other countries, leading to increased imports and the need to position UK pork as a product deserving a price premium.

In 1997, Grampian Country Foods, then the UK&#x27;s largest pig producer, pointed out that pigmeat production costs in the UK were 44 p/kg higher than on the continent. Grampian stated that only 2 p/kg of this was due to the ban on stalls; the majority of the extra costs resulted from the then strength of sterling and the fact that at that time meat and bone meal had been banned in the UK but not on the continent. A study by the Meat and Livestock Commission in 1999, the year that the gestation crate ban came into force, found that moving from gestation crates, to group housing added just 1.6 pence to the cost of producing 1 kg of pigmeat. French and Dutch studies show that even in the higher welfare group housing systems – ones giving more space and straw – a kg of pigmeat costs less than 2 pence more to produce than in gestation crates.

===Sow breeding systems===
Organized campaigns by animal activists have focused on the use of the gestation crate, such as the &#x27;gestation crate&#x27; and farrowing crate. The gestation crate has now been banned in the UK, certain US states, and other European countries, although it remains part of pig production in much of the US and European Union.

The sows selected for breeding will be confined in a gestation crate. Hogs (males) are kept confined in caged crates of the same size for the duration of their lives in order to have their sperm repeatedly extracted by workers. In an intensive system, the sow will be placed in a crate prior to insemination and will stay there for at least the start of her pregnancy, depending on each country&#x27;s laws and local regulations. The typical length of the sow&#x27;s pregnancy is 3 months, 3 weeks, and 3 days. In certain cases, sows may spend this time in the crate. However, a variety of farming systems are used and the time in the crate may vary from 4 weeks to the whole pregnancy.

There is also current controversy and criticism of &#x27;farrowing crates&#x27;. A farrowing crate houses the sow in one section and her piglets in another. It allows the sow to lie down and roll over to feed her piglets, but keeps her piglets in a separate section. This prevents the large sow from sitting on her piglets and killing them, which is quite common where the sow is not separated from the piglets. Sows are also prevented from being able to move other than between standing and lying. Some models of farrowing crates may allow more space than others, and allow greater interaction between sow and young. Well-designed farrowing pens in which the sow has ample space can be just as effective as crates in preventing piglet mortality. Some crates may also be designed with cost-effectiveness or efficiency in mind and therefore be smaller.

Authoritative industry data indicate that moving from sow stalls to group housing added 2 pence to the cost of producing 1 kg. of pigmeat.

Many English fattening pigs are kept in barren conditions and are routinely tail docked. Since 2003 EU legislation has required pigs to be given environmental enrichment and has banned routine tail docking. However, 80% of UK pigs are tail docked.

In 2015, use of sow crates was made illegal on New Zealand pig farms.

===Effects on traditional rural communities===
Common criticism of intensive piggeries is that they represent a corporatization of the traditional rural lifestyle. Critics feel the rise of intensive piggeries has largely replaced family farming. In large part, this is because intensive piggeries are more economical than outdoor systems, pen systems, or the sty. In many pork-producing countries (e.g., United States, Canada, Australia, Denmark) the use of intensive piggeries has led to market rationalization and concentration. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that keeping pigs and other animals in &quot;unnaturally overcrowded&quot; environments poses considerable health risks for workers, neighbors, and consumers.

===Waste management and public health concerns===
Contaminants from animal wastes can enter the environment through pathways such as through leakage of poorly constructed manure lagoons or during major precipitation events resulting in either overflow of lagoons and runoff from recent applications of waste to farm fields, or atmospheric deposition followed by dry or wet fallout. Runoff can leach through permeable soils to vulnerable aquifers that tap ground water sources for human consumption. Runoff of manure can also find its way into surface water such as lakes, streams, and ponds. An example of weather induced runoff having been recently reported in the wake of Hurricane Matthew.

Many contaminants are present in livestock wastes, including nutrients, pathogens, veterinary pharmaceuticals and naturally excreted hormones. Improper disposal of animal carcasses and abandoned livestock facilities can also contribute to water quality problems in surrounding areas of CAFOs.

Exposure to waterborne contaminants can result from both recreational use of affected surface water and from ingestion of drinking water derived from either contaminated surface water or ground water. High-Risk populations are generally the very young, the elderly, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals. Dermal contact may cause skin, eye, or ear infections. Drinking water exposures to pathogens could occur in vulnerable private wells.

At Varkensproefcentrum Sterksel in the Netherlands, a pig farm has been created that reuses its waste streams. CO2 and ammonia from the pig manure are reused to grow algae which in turn are used to feed the pigs.

Another method to reduce the effect on the environment is to switch to other breeds of pig. The enviropig is a genetically modified type of pig with the capability to digest plant phosphorus more efficiently than ordinary pigs, though the enviropig program ended in 2012 and did not reach commercial distribution.

Nutrient-rich runoff from CAFO&#x27;s can contribute to Algal blooms in rivers, lakes and seas. The 2009 harmful algal bloom event off the coast of Brittany, France was attributed to runoff from an intensive pig farm.

===North Carolina===
As of 2010, North Carolina housed approximately ten million hogs, most of which are located in the eastern half of the state in industrialized concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). This was not the case 20 years ago. The initial horizontal integration and the vertical integration that arose in this industry resulted in numerous issues, including issues of environmental disparity, loss of work, pollution, animal rights, and overall general public health. The most remarkable example of swine CAFO monopoly is found in the United States, where in 2001, 50 producers had control over 70% of total pork production. In 2001, the biggest CAFO had just over 710,000 sows.

Originally, Murphy Family Farms horizontally integrated the North Carolina system. They laid the groundwork for the industry to be vertically integrated. Today the hog industry in North Carolina is led by Smithfield Foods, which has expanded into both nationwide and international production.

The environmental justice problems in North Carolina&#x27;s agroindustrialization of swine production seem to stem from the history of the coastal region&#x27;s economy, which has relied heavily on black and low-income populations to supply the necessary agricultural labor. The industry&#x27;s shift from family-owned hog farms to factory hogging has contributed to the frequent targeting of these areas.

This swine production and pollution that accompanies factory hogging is concentrated in the parts of North Carolina that have the highest disease rates, the least access to medical care, and the greatest need for positive education and economic development. Since hog production has become consolidated in the coastal region of N.C., the high water tables and low-lying flood plains have increased the risk and impact of hog farm pollution. A swine CAFO is made up of three parts: the hog house, the “lagoon,” and the “spray field.” Waste disposal techniques used by small-scale traditional hog farms, like using waste as fertilizer for commercially viable crops, were adopted and expanded for use by CAFOs. Lagoons are supposed to be protected with an impermeable liner, but some do not work properly. This can cause environmental damage, as seen in 1995 when a lagoon burst in North Carolina. This lagoon released 25 million gallons of noxious sludge into North Carolina&#x27;s New River and killed approximately eight to ten million fish.

The toxins emitted by the swine CAFOs can produce a variety of symptoms and illnesses ranging from respiratory disorders, headaches, and shortness of breath to hydrogen sulfide poisoning, bronchitis, and asthma. The potential for spray field runoff or lagoon leakage puts nearby residents in danger of contaminated drinking water, which can lead to diseases like samonellosis, giardiasis, Chlamydia, meningitis, cryptosporidiosis, worms, and influenza.

===Denmark===
Slaughterhouses and veterinarians are obliged to report pigs with injuries to the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, which forwards cases to the police. There were relatively few cases before 2006, but by 2008-9 there were about 300 per year. When there are visible injuries, it represents not only a problem in animal welfare but also the farmers economy because parts or occasionally the entire carcass has to be discarded. From 2006 to 2009 the number of pigs with injuries caused by hard objects, such as planks or chains received by slaughterhouses rose significantly. It was possibly related to a system introduced in 2006, which rewards &quot;the rushed loading of animals onto vehicles&quot;, as well as a sharp increase in uneducated Eastern European farm workers unaware of Danish laws.

Gestation crates were sometimes used on some Danish farms to restrict the movement of sows during pregnancy, as documented by British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver in a television programme for the UK&#x27;s Channel 4 in 2009. In other fields, such as bathing facilities for the pigs and floor material Danish requirements were higher than in the UK. the practice was already prohibited for pigs exported to the UK. The use of gestation crates became illegal in Denmark (as part of the EU) in 2013.

===New Zealand===
According to Scoop, in 2009 the New Zealand pork industry was &quot;dealt a shameful public relations slap-in-the-face after its former celebrity kingpin, Mike King, outed their farming practices as &#x27;brutal&#x27;, &#x27;callous&#x27; and &#x27;evil on a May episode of New Zealand television show &quot;Sunday&quot;. King condemned the &quot;appalling treatment&quot; of factory farmed pigs. King observed conditions inside a New Zealand piggery, and saw a dead female pig inside a gestation crate, lame and crippled pigs and others that could barely stand, pigs either extremely depressed or highly distressed, pigs with scars and injuries, and a lack of clean drinking water and food.

<doc id="158166" wikidata="Q16245485" url="?curid=158166" title="British and Malaysian English differences">
<text>This article outlines the differences between Malaysian English, Malaysian Colloquial English (Manglish) and British English, which for the purposes of this article is assumed to be the form of English spoken in south east England, used by the British Government, the BBC and widely understood in other parts of the United Kingdom.

Malaysian English (MyE), formally known as Malaysian Standard English (MySE), is a form of English used and spoken in Malaysia as a second language. Malaysian English should not be confused with Malaysian Colloquial English, which is famously known as Manglish, a portmanteau of the word Malay and English, or Street English.

Manglish can be likened to an English-based pidgin language or a patois and it is usually barely understandable to most speakers of English outside Malaysia except in the case of Singapore where a similar colloquial form of English is spoken known as Singlish. Though very similar, Manglish today receives more Malay influences while Singlish more Chinese.

== Spelling ==
Manglish does not possess a standard written form, although many variations exist for transcribing certain words. For most purposes it is a spoken tongue.

In Malaysian education, written English is based on British English but most of the students speak in a local accent influenced by American pronunciations.

== Grammar ==

Much of Manglish grammatical structure is taken from varieties of Chinese and the Malay language. For example, the phrase &quot;Why you so like that one?&quot; means &quot;Why are you behaving in that way&quot; in standard English. In Cantonese, a similar phrase would be rendered as &quot;Dímgáai néih gám ge?&quot; or literally &quot;Why you like that?&quot; The &quot;one&quot; in the sample phrase does not literally mean the numeral one, instead it is used more as a suffix device. It is also sometimes rendered as &quot;wan.&quot; The use of Manglish is discouraged at schools, where only Malaysian English is taught.

Other common characteristics are anastrophe and omission of certain prepositions and articles. For example, &quot;I haven&#x27;t seen you in a long time&quot; becomes &quot;Long time never seen you already&quot;.

== Vocabulary ==

=== Words only used in British English ===

To a large extent, standard Malaysian English is descended from British English, largely due to the country&#x27;s colonisation by Britain beginning from the 18th century. But because of influence from American mass media, particularly in the form of television programmes and movies, Malaysians are also usually familiar with many American English words. For instance, both lift/elevator and lorry/truck are understood, although the British form is preferred. Only in some very limited cases is the American English form more widespread, e.g. chips instead of crisps, fries instead of chips.

=== Words or phrases only used in Malaysian English ===

Malaysian English is gradually forming its own vocabulary, these words come from a variety of influences. Typically, for words or phrases that are based on other English words, the Malaysian English speaker may be unaware that the word or phrase is not present in British or American English.

=== Different meanings ===
This is a list of words and phrases that have one meaning in British English and another in Malaysian English.

== Pronunciation ==
In Malaysian English, the last syllable of a word is sometimes not pronounced with the strength that it would be in British English.

Also, p and f are sometimes pronounced somewhat similarly among speakers of Malay descent. For example, the two Malay names &#x27;Fazlin&#x27; and &#x27;Pazlin&#x27; may sound almost identical when spoken by Malays, whereas this confusion would not arise when spoken by a British Speaker.

<text>Malaysian English (MyE), formally known as Malaysian Standard English (MySE) (similar and related to British English), is a form of English used and spoken in Malaysia. While Malaysian English can encompass a range of English spoken in Malaysia, some consider it to be distinct from the colloquial form commonly called Manglish.

==Varieties==
Malaysian English may be categorised into three levels: the acrolect, mesolect and basilect. The acrolect is used by those with near-native level of proficiency in English, and only a relatively small percentage of Malaysians are fluent in it. The acrolect is internationally intelligible, and it is used for official purposes or formal occasions and written communications. It conforms to standard British English, but some words that are specific to Malaysia may be used.

The mesolect is a localised form of English that is used by competent speakers of English or as an informal medium of communication between different ethnic groups of Malaysia. It may use some colloquial terms, and its grammar and syntax may show some deviations from standard English.

The basilect is used very informally by those with limited proficiency and vocabulary in English, and it has features of an extended pidgin or creole with syntax that deviates substantially from Standard English. The basilect may be hard to understand internationally, and it is often referred to as Manglish.

As with other similar situations, a continuum exists between these three varieties, and speakers may code-switch between them, depending on context. Most professionals and other English-educated Malaysians speak mesolect English informally between themselves, but they may also use a basilect depending on the circumstances. All three varieties may be seen as part of Malaysian English, but some prefer to see Malaysian English as a form distinct from the basilect Manglish, which tends to ignore English grammar, while others may see the basilect as the &quot;real&quot; Malaysian English. There is also no consensus on what Standard Malaysian English might be. Some regard the mesolect to be substandard English and a local dialect.

===Manglish===

Manglish refers to the colloquial, informal spoken form of pidgin English in Malaysia that some considered to be distinct from more &quot;correct&quot; forms of Malaysian English. It exists in a wide variety of forms and primarily as a spoken form of English. It is the most common form of spoken English on the street, but it is discouraged in schools, where only Malaysian Standard English is taught. Its lexis is strongly influenced by local languages, with many non-English nouns and verbs commonly used, and it is significantly different grammatically from Standard English. There are colloquialisms in English that are not common outside of Malaysia, which are also used colloquially as substitutes in other languages in Malaysia. In Manglish, Malay or Chinese grammatical structure may be used with English words, which is often done quite spontaneously, sometimes for comic effect.

==Features==
Since Malaysian English originates from British English when the British Empire ruled what is now Malaysia, it shares many of the features of British English. However, it also has components of American English, Malay, Chinese, Indian languages, and other languages in its vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar.

Malaysian English shows a tendency towards simplification in its pronunciation and grammar, a feature also found in other new Englishes. For example, in pronunciation, diphthongs tend to become monophthongs in Malaysian English, stops may be used instead of dental fricatives and the final consonant clusters often become simplified. There are 6 short monophthongs in Malaysian English, compared to 7 in British English, and the vowel length tend to be the same for long and short vowels. There are, however, slight differences in pronunciation in the states in the central and southern parts of the Malay Peninsula from those in the north and the east of Malaysia. There are also some variations in its vocabulary.

===Pronunciation===
*Malaysian English is generally non-rhotic.
*Malaysian English has a broad &quot;s&quot;, and words like &quot;cab&quot; and &quot;tab&quot; have , rather than .
*The in words like &quot;butter&quot; is usually not flapped (unlike in American English) or realised as a glottal stop (unlike in many forms of British English, including Cockney).
*There is no &quot;h&quot;-dropping in words like &quot;head&quot;.
*Malaysian English does not have English consonant-cluster reductions after , , and . For example, &quot;new&quot;, &quot;tune&quot; and &quot;dune&quot; are pronounced , , and . That contrasts with many varieties from East Anglia and the East Midlands of British English and with most forms of American English.
*The &#x27;th&#x27; fricatives (θ and ð) are pronounced as stops: [t] for [θ] and [d] for [ð].
*The &#x27;l&#x27; is generally clear.
*The diphthongs are monophthongised: &#x27;ow&#x27; ([əʊ] or [oʊ]) becomes [o] and &#x27;ay&#x27; ([eɪ]) becomes [e].
*The &#x27;d&#x27; at the end of the word is usually dropped. For example, &quot;cold&quot;, &quot;hold&quot; and &quot;world&quot; are pronounced as (), () and .
*The long and short vowels tend to have the same length (for example, &quot;beat&quot; and &quot;bit&quot; are homophones in Malaysian English).

===Grammar===
The grammar in Malaysian English may become simplified in the mesolectal and basilectal varieties. For example, articles and past-tense markers may sometimes be omitted, question structures may be simplified, and the distinction between countable and mass nouns may be blurred. In the basilectal variety, omission of the object pronoun or the subject pronoun is common. The modal auxiliary system is also often reduced, and sometimes, a verb may be absent. The colloquial form often has Malay or Chinese grammatical structure.

Particles are commonly used in colloquial Malaysian English, a notable one being an enclitic &quot;lah&quot; used at the end of a sentence.

===Vocabulary===
In the acrolect, which uses standard English vocabulary and is internationally comprehensible, non-English terms are still used. Typically these are words for which there is no direct equivalence in English or those that express local reality; for example, &quot;bumiputera&quot;, &quot;kampong&quot;, as well as titles such as Yang di-Pertuan Agong and Tunku. Words from the Chinese or Indian languages may also be used, such as &quot;ang pow&quot; or &quot;dhoti&quot;.

In the mesolect, local words and phrases for which there are English equivalents may also used, for example, &quot;tidak apa&quot; (&quot;never mind&quot;, &quot;it does not matter&quot;) or &quot;ulu&quot; (or &quot;hulu&quot;, meaning &quot;head&quot;, &quot;upper reaches of a river&quot;, &quot;interior of a country&quot;). In the basilect, the use of local terms may be extensive even if most words used are English, and local expressions or exclamations such as &quot;alamak&quot; (Oh my god) often form part of the speech.

==Word usage==
In the first half of the 20th century, Malaysian English was similar to British English but spoken with a Malaysian accent. However, in the postcolonial era (since 1957), the influx of American TV programmes has influenced the usage of Malaysian English. There is no official language board, council or organisation to ensure the correct and standard usage of Malaysian English because after independence, Malay replaced English as the official language. The University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate continues, however, to set and mark the GCE O-Level English Language &quot;1119&quot; paper, which is a compulsory subject for the Malaysian Certificate of Education (the English Language paper set by the Malaysian Ministry of Education is the same as the English Language &quot;1119&quot; paper for GCE O-Level).

To a large extent, Malaysian English is descended from British English, largely because of the country&#x27;s colonisation by Britain from the 18th century. However, influence from American mass media, particularly in the form of television programmes and films has made most Malaysians familiar with many American English words. For instance, both &quot;/&quot; and &quot;/&quot; are understood, but the British form is preferred. Only in some very limited cases is the American English form more widespread: &quot; instead of &quot;, &quot; instead of &quot; and &quot; instead of &quot;.

===Words with different meaning in Malaysian English===
Some words and phrases used in Malaysia have different meanings than in British or American English.

===Words used mainly in Malaysian English===
Malaysian English has its own vocabulary, which comes from a variety of influences. Typically, for words or phrases that are based on other English words, the Malaysian English speaker may be unaware that the word or phrase is not used in British or American English. Such words are also present in the vocabulary of some continuums of Singapore Standard English.

Many words of Malay origin have made it into the standard form of Malaysian English used in the media, literature and formal speech. For example, Menteri Besar (Malay for Chief Minister) even has a plural form in English – Menteri&quot;s&quot; Besar.

===Particles in Malaysian English===
Particles in Malaysian English come from the influence of Chinese and Malay. Some phrases used for emphasis in British or American English are used as particles in Malaysian English, while ignoring the participle or a verb.

==Syntax==
Syntactical differences are few although in colloquial speech &#x27;shall&#x27; and &#x27;ought&#x27; are wanting, &#x27;must&#x27; is marginal for obligation and &#x27;may&#x27; is rare. Many syntactical features of Malaysian English are found in other forms of English such as British English and North American English:

*Can I come too? for &quot;May I come too?&quot;
*(Have) you got any? for &quot;Do you have any?&quot;
*I(&#x27;ve) got one of those already. for &quot;I already have one of those.&quot;

==Phonology==
Officially, Malaysian English uses the same pronunciation system as British English. However, most Malaysians speak with a distinctive accent that has recently evolved to become more American by the influx of American TV programmes, the large number of Malaysians pursuing higher education in the United States, and by the large number of English-speaking Malaysians in cities employed in American companies. For example, that increased the emphasis on &quot;r&quot; in words such as &quot;refer&quot; and &quot;world&quot;.

==Role of Malaysian English in Independent Malaysia==
Even though Malaysian English is not the official language of Malaysia, it is still used among Malaysians in business. About 80% of urban businesses in Malaysia conduct their transactions in English (both Malaysian English and Manglish). However, American English has quite a strong foothold in international businesses in Malaysia. Malaysian English is also widely used in advertising sectors, especially commercial advertisements aired in private TV stations, primarily Media Prima-owned TV stations. Most of Malaysian people, especially Chinese and Indians have tendencies to speak in English instead of Malay when they are interviewed on television. In terms of education, private universities and colleges in Malaysia mostly use Malaysian English for their identities. Most of Malaysian companies and organisations have started using their official name in English instead of Malay to keep up with modernisation in recent years.

In music industry, singers such as Siti Nurhaliza, Yuna and Reshmonu also performs songs in English. There are several English language national daily and business newspapers based in Kuala Lumpur namely The Malaysian Reserve, The Edge, The Star, The Sun, New Straits Times and Malay Mail. There are also many English language national commercial broadcasting radio stations based in Kuala Lumpur such as TraXX FM, Hitz, Mix, Lite (formerly known as Light &amp; Easy) and Fly FM (Peninsular Malaysia only). However, Malaysia does not have any television station which broadcasts purely in English. The Government National Language policy requires local television stations to air at least 25% Malaysian-made programmes (either Malay or English). English language nationwide free-to-air terrestrial television stations based in Kuala Lumpur such as TV1, TV2, TV Okey, Sukan RTM, Berita RTM (RTM News), Bernama TV, TV3, DidikTV KPM (NTV7), PRIMEtime, Showcase Movies, Astro Awani, Astro Arena and Astro Arena 2 do air some English Malaysian-made programmes. A few Malaysian-made television programmes in Malay carry English subtitles and vice versa.

<text>Turtle fibropapillomatosis (FP) is a disease of sea turtles. The condition is characterized by benign but ultimately debilitating epithelial tumours on the surface of biological tissues. FP exists all over the world, but it is most prominent in warmer climates, affecting up to 50–70% of some populations.

The causative agent of the disease is believed to be Chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5 (ChHV-5), a species of virus in the genus &quot;Scutavirus&quot;, subfamily &quot;Alphaherpesvirinae&quot;, family &quot;Herpesviridae&quot;, and order &quot;Herpesvirales&quot;. Turtle leeches are suspected mechanical vectors, transmitting the disease to other individuals. The disease is thought to have a multifactorial cause, including a tumour-promoting phase that is possibly caused by biotoxins or contaminants.

==Description==
Fibropapillomatosis is a benign tumour disease of marine turtles, predominantly in the green sea turtle, &quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;, but it has also been reported in the loggerhead sea turtle &quot;Caretta caretta&quot;, olive ridley &quot;Lepidochelys olivacea&quot;, Kemp&#x27;s ridley &quot;Lepidochelys kempii&quot;, and leatherbacks &quot;Dermochelys coriacea&quot;. This neoplastic disease causes proliferation of papillary cells (hyperplasia) and gives rise to excess fibrous connective tissue in both epidermal and dermal skin layers – or more specifically, proliferation of dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes. This causes tumorigenesis in sizes less than 1 cm up to more than 30 cm in diameter.
FP is most often found externally around the armpits, genitals, neck, eyes, and tails of turtles, but also occur in and around the mouth, and rarely in internal organs or on the carapace. This, in turn, impedes vision, feeding, and movement. Around 25–30% of turtles with external tumours also have internal tumours, primarily in heart, lungs and kidneys.

FP incidence is highest among immature and juvenile green turtles, while it is rare in adults. The suggestions for this pattern include the tumours can regress and be cured, which has been documented in some individuals, even when tumours were severe. However, the responses that cause these tumour regressions is unknown. Secondly, the juvenile individuals with FP might die before reaching adulthood.

===Prognosis===
The tumours appear to be benign and can be present for many years, but if large, can mechanically hamper sight, swallowing, and swimming, which may ultimately be fatal. While external tumours hamper movement and sight, internal tumours interfere with system functioning, another potentially fatal factor. As the tumours progress, individuals with large numbers of tumours may become anaemic, have a lack of proteins and iron, and in more advanced stages even suffer from acidosis caused by imbalanced calcium/phosphorus ratios and severe emaciation.

===Other species===
Fibropapillomas are present in other animal groups, but are caused by different viruses, for example the bovine papillomavirus.

==History==
The first documented case of the disease was in 1938 in Key West, Florida. Long-term studies found no signs of the disease on Florida&#x27;s Atlantic coast in the 1970s, but during the 1980s FP was recorded in incidences varying from 28 to 67%. Today, incidences as high as 92% have been reported in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii. Generally, FP is most prominent in warmer climates. Recent research has found that FP is caused by stress and tumours have been observed in turtles that are part of turtle tourism tours. 

==Cause==

The FP is an infectious disease with horizontal transmission. An alphaherpesvirus called fibropapilloma-associated turtle herpesvirus (FPTHV) and Chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5 is believed to be the causative agent of the disease. The reason for this belief is because nearly all tissue samples tested from turtles with lesions carry genetic material of this herpesvirus, varying between 95 and 100% depending on different studies and locations. The DNA loads of the herpesvirus in tumour tissue are 2.5–4.5 logarithms higher than in uninfected tissue.
The FPTHV herpesvirus has been found in turtles free from FP and this suggest that the FP progression is multifactorial and might even involve some sort of tumour-promoting phase. The global prevalence of the disease also suggests a multifactorial cause, rather than single factors or agents. Possible factors include some parasites, bacteria, environmental pollutants, UV-light, changing water temperatures and biotoxins. Even physiological factors such as stress and immunologic status appear to be associated with FP.

The leech genus &quot;Ozobranchus&quot; is thought to be the mechanical vector of the herpesvirus, transmitting the virus from one turtle to another. These leeches are common turtle ectoparasites that exclusively feed on turtle blood, and some leeches have been found carrying more than 10 million copies of the herpesvirus DNA. 
The green sea turtle is an herbivore and feeds primarily on seagrass and macroalgae. Two toxins which are suspected to be associated with FP are found epiphytically on these plants. First, the toxic compound lyngbyatoxin from the cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscule, and second the toxin okadaic acid – a documented tumour-promoting toxin - from the dinoflagellate &quot;Prorocentrum&quot;. Again, causality has not been concluded, but an association seems to exist between the distribution of especially the dinoflagellates and the occurrence of FP, and as they are found on weeds, they can be ingested by foraging green sea turtles.
Turtles with FP are found to have a compromised immune system. They have higher phagocytic leucocyte counts (especially heterophils) compared to healthy individuals, which seems to be an effect of FP, as it is mostly evident in individuals with severe tumours. This further supports the hypothesis of the herpesvirus as a causative agent. Immunosuppression is strongly correlated with FP, but does seem to be a consequence of the development and growth of FP rather than a prerequisite, which is similar to other virus-induced tumour diseases in other species, such as Marek&#x27;s disease in poultry.

== Treatment ==
Surgical removal of tumors caused by FP is the most common treatment method. Photodynamic therapy and electrochemotherapy are also used, as is CO2 laser surgery.

==Epidemiology==
FP affects green sea turtle populations all over the world, making it a panzootic. It is especially found in warmer climates, such as the Caribbean, Hawaii, Japan, and Australia, where up to 70% of individuals in a population have FP.

Epidemiological links are seen between FP rates, nitrogen footprints, and invasive macroalgae. The strongest association with FP is with habitat type, especially increased anthropogenic activity causing high-nitrogen footprints in a surrounding environment where green sea turtles are found. Sea turtles do live in very complex ecosystems, with both near-shore habitats and several years in the open ocean, which makes study of ecosystem associations difficult. Even so, observations support the hypothesis that near-shore habitats have a strong correlation with the disease, as newly recruited individuals from the pelagic life phase have never been found with tumours, and when migrating to more shallow ocean zones, such as the neritic zone, individuals still remain free from FP, but when entering lagoon systems, turtles may become infected. The high prevalence of FP is also associated with habitats’ poor quality, while FP is absent in some habitats of good quality.

Turtles are known to be robust to physical damage, but are surprisingly very susceptible to biological and chemical contaminants caused by anthropogenic activity. As the turtles forage on invasive macroalgae in nutrient-rich waters, they can ingest environmental nitrogen in the form of arginine, which is known to regulate immune activity, promote herpesviruses, and contribute to tumorigenesis.

<text>The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) is an American nonprofit global policy think tank with the stated intent of using science and scientific analysis to attempt to make the world more secure. FAS was founded in 1945 by a group of scientists, some of whom had previously contributed to the development of nuclear weapons in the Manhattan Project. The Federation of American Scientists states that it aims to reduce the amount of nuclear weapons that are in use, and prevent nuclear and radiological terrorism. It says it aims to present high standards for nuclear energy&#x27;s safety and security, illuminate government secrecy practices, as well as track and eliminate the global illicit trade of conventional, nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.

With 100 sponsors, the Federation of American Scientists says that it promotes a safer and more secure world by developing and advancing solutions to important science and technology security policy problems by educating the public and policy makers, and promoting transparency through research and analysis to maximize impact on policy. FAS projects are organized in three main programs: nuclear security, government secrecy, and biosecurity. FAS has played a role in the control of atomic energy and weapons, as well as better international monitoring of atomic activities.

==History==
FAS was founded as the Federation of Atomic Scientists on November 30, 1945, by a group of scientists and engineers associated with the Manhattan Project, including personnel from the Oak Ridge and Los Alamos sites. Among the founding members were David Hawkins, Melba Phillips, and Robert R. Wilson. 

Its early mission was to support the McMahon Act of 1946, educate the public, press, politicians, and policy-makers, and promote international transparency and nuclear disarmament. The group was frustrated with the control of the nation&#x27;s nuclear arsenal and advocated for public control of the nuclear arsenal. A group of the early members of the Federation of American Scientists went to Washington, D.C., and set up there sending letters to representatives in the House of Representatives and in the Senate to request support for their original goal not to support the May-Johnson Bill. The group of scientists were opposed to the fact that, under the proposed May-Johnson Bill, the United States military would have the majority of control over the development and control of atomic weapons. Working with congressmen, they worked to create the bill that brought forth the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). The Atomic Energy Commission oversaw the research into atomic energy and atomic weapons. On January 6, 1946, FAS changed its name to the Federation of American Scientists, but its purpose remained the same—to agitate for the international control of atomic energy and its devotion to peaceful uses, public promotion of science and the freedom and integrity of scientists and scientific research. For this purpose, permanent headquarters were set up in Washington, D.C., and contacts were established with the several branches of government, the United Nations, professional and private organizations, and influential persons. The explosion of postwar political activism demonstrated by the group became known as the &quot;scientists&#x27; movement&quot; with the basis of being unhappy with the United States&#x27; monopoly on nuclear weapons. During this movement, the idea was also established that no defense against an atomic bomb was feasible in the near future. Using these two ideas, the FAS proposed the United States and other technologically advanced nations had to work in unison to create a solution that would not end in complete destruction.

In 1946, the FAS worked with the Ad Council to broadcast a list of facts regarding the state of the United Nations atomic energy negotiations as well as the American proposal for atomic development. In a rare example of an effort to simply give listeners facts with little to no political or personal bias, the scientists at FAS were able to broadcast this information to the public in hopes of informing the public to be &quot;armed with the facts — instead of swayed by emotions or prejudices.&quot; Throughout the course of trying to give the public information, the FAS attempted to coordinate with PR agencies to better connect with the audience. Most of these plans fell through as the agencies typically did not see eye-to-eye with members of the FAS. Scientists realized the importance of getting their point across, but conveying that to someone who had little to no background knowledge on the subject of atomic energy proved to be a challenge, a challenge that would stick with the FAS for many years. Many scientists from more localized organizations had comments like &quot;We have failed. The people have not understood us or our foreign policy would have changed.&quot;

By 1948, the Federation had grown to twenty local associations, with 2,500 members, and had been instrumental in the passage of the McMahon Act and the National Science Foundation, and had influenced the American position in the United Nations with regard to international control of atomic energy and disarmament.

In addition to influencing government policy, it undertook a program of public education on the nature and control of atomic energy through lectures, films, exhibits, and the distribution of literature, coordinating its own activities with that of member organizations through the issue of memorandum, policy statements, information sheets, and newsletters.

Nearly ninety percent of Manhattan Project personnel were in approval of the FAS, with few comparing the group to a &quot;scientists&#x27; lobby.&quot;

===Mission===
The mission of FAS is to promote a safer and more secure world by developing and advancing solutions to important science and technology security policy problems by educating the public and policy makers, and promoting transparency through research and analysis to maximize impact on policy. This mission was established early on and was deemed necessary for the federation, as decisions made by the United States during the conception of the FAS were critical in terms of shaping international relations. The FAS wanted the public to become more critical and aware of the government, in order to monitor the decisions that were made to ensure that they matched what the public actually wanted. The FAS would act to inform the public about how destructive the improper use of atomic energy could be and emphasize the need to enforce international control of atomic weapons and energy.

=== Membership ===
In 1969, the FAS had a rough annual budget of $7,000 and relied on mostly volunteer staff. In 1970 Jeremy J. Stone was selected as president of the organization and was the only staff member for the next 5 years. Due to Stone being the president and only member of the organization he influenced the future and direction of the organization heavily. With an increased budget in the 1990s FAS was able to employ a staff of about a dozen people and expand membership of the organization.

In the mid-1980s, the FAS began relying more heavily on professional staff and analysts, and journalists rather than famous scientists as it did previously in its history. The organization shifted toward public information and transparency in the government and away from secrecy in covert projects and finances. In 2000 Henry C. Kelly, a former senior scientist in the Office of Technology Assessment and science policy adviser in the Clinton administration, became the new president. He further pursued the goals of the program of bolstering science in policy and focusing on using that science to further benefit the public. During his eight-year tenure as president, FAS received significant funding from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, including a $2.5 million grant for Creative and Effective Institutions.

In a 2002 survey conducted within the FAS, it was found that nearly thirty percent of members were physicists. While the next largest fields represented were medicine, biology, engineering, and chemistry. With the latter four fields making up another sixty one percent of the total member population. Members also received complementary copies of &quot;Secrecy News&quot;, an electronic newsletter regarding government secrecy and intelligence.

=== Funding from the MacArthur Foundation ===
Federation of American Scientists was awarded $10,586,000 between 1984 and 2017, including 25 grants in International Peace &amp; Security, MacArthur Award for Creative &amp; Effective Institutions, and Nuclear Challenges. In 2004, the Federation of American Scientists received their largest grant from the MacArthur Foundation of $2,400,000 in support of everything that they do.

==Programs and projects==

===Nuclear Information Project===
The Nuclear Information Project covers nuclear weapons and arms control and the nuclear fuel cycle. The project provides the general public and policy-makers with information and analysis on the status, number, and operation of nuclear weapons, the policies that guide their potential use and nuclear arms control. The project is run by Hans M. Kristensen.

The Nuclear Information Project publishes yearly counts of global nuclear forces in the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot;’ &quot;Nuclear Notebook&quot; column. The Nuclear Notebook counts and analyzes international nuclear arsenals using open source research methodology. The estimates in the Nuclear Notebook often accurately count warhead inventories, down to the number, and, according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, represent an &quot;authoritative accounting of global nuclear warheads compiled by top experts&quot;.

The Nuclear Information Project conducts other open source investigations into nuclear weapons outside of the Nuclear Notebook. In addition to publishing on the Strategic Security blog, fellows also publish in Forbes.

=== Day One Project and Policy Entrepreneurship ===
FAS&#x27;s &quot;Day One Project&quot; crowdsources &quot;science-based policy innovations that can appeal to lawmakers on both sides of the aisle&quot; ready for implementation on &quot;day one&quot; of the next U.S. presidential administration, a project begun in 2019.

==Legacy programs and projects ==

=== Project on Government Secrecy ===
&quot;From 1991 to 2021, the FAS Project on Government Secrecy worked to challenge excessive government secrecy and to promote public oversight in national security affairs&quot;...&quot;The Project was directed by Steven Aftergood with the support of grants from the Open Society Foundations, the CS Fund, the Bauman Foundation, the Stewart R. Mott Foundation, the Knight Foundation, the HKH Foundation, the Rockefeller Family Fund, and others.&quot;
The Project on Government Secrecy worked to promote public access to government information and to illuminate the apparatus of government secrecy, including national security classification and declassification policies. The project also published previously undisclosed or hard-to-find government documents of public policy interest, as well as resources on intelligence policy.

Declassified documents, as well as Congressional Research Service reports, are archived on the Secrecy News blog.

===Biosecurity Program===
The Biosecurity Program concentrates on researching and advocating policies that balance science and security without compromising national security or scientific progress. This includes preventing the misuse of research and promoting the public understanding of the real threats from biological and chemical weapons. The Federation of American Scientists also concentrates on researching and keeping the public informed on genetic engineering and genetic modification as a subset of their biosecurity program. One of their major concerns is resistance that species can develop to certain modifications from genetic resistance or from the use of antibiotics.

The big concerns with biosecurity are accidental biological threats, intentional malicious biological threats, and natural biological threat occurrences. Because of these threats the Virtual Biosecurity Center (VBC) was set up.

The Virtual Biosecurity Center provides and promotes biosecurity information, education, best practices and collaboration. Additionally, VBC offers significant news and events regarding biosecurity, a regularly updated education center and library, a global forum on Bio risks, an online informative policy tool, empowering partnerships among other professional biosecurity communities around the world, scheduled global conferences to raise awareness and develop plans for current and future biosecurity issues, as well as partnerships to tighten the gap between the scientific, public health, intelligence and law enforcement communities.

===Learning Technologies Program===
The Learning Technologies Program (LTP) focused on ways to use innovative technologies to improve how people teach and learn. The LTP created prototype games and learning tools and assembled collaborative projects consisting of non-governmental organization, design professionals, and community leaders to undertake innovative education initiatives at both the national and local level.

The Project worked to help create learning tools to bring about major gains in learning and training. The major project of the Program is Immune Attack, a fully 3-D game in which high school students discover the inner workings of the body&#x27;s circulatory and immune systems, as they pilot a tiny drone through the bloodstream to fight microscopic invaders.

<text>Condoleezza &quot;Condi&quot; Rice ( ; born November 14, 1954) is an American diplomat and political scientist serving since 2020 as the 8th director of Stanford University&#x27;s Hoover Institution. A member of the Republican Party, she previously served as the 66th United States secretary of state from 2005 to 2009 and as the 19th U.S. national security advisor from 2001 to 2005. Rice was the first female African-American secretary of state and the first woman to serve as national security advisor. Until the election of Barack Obama as president in 2008, Rice and her predecessor, Colin Powell, were the highest-ranking African Americans in the history of the federal executive branch (by virtue of the secretary of state standing fourth in the presidential line of succession). At the time of her appointment as Secretary of State, Rice was the highest-ranking woman in the history of the United States to be in the presidential line of succession.

Rice was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and grew up while the South was racially segregated. She obtained her bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Denver and her master&#x27;s degree from the University of Notre Dame, both in political science. In 1981, she received a PhD from the School of International Studies at the University of Denver.&lt;ref name=&quot;faculty/condoleezza&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She worked at the State Department under the Carter administration and served on the National Security Council as the Soviet and Eastern Europe affairs advisor to President George H. W. Bush during the dissolution of the Soviet Union and German reunification from 1989 to 1991. Rice later pursued an academic fellowship at Stanford University, where she later served as provost from 1993 to 1999. On December 17, 2000, she joined the George W. Bush administration as national security advisor. In Bush&#x27;s second term, she succeeded Colin Powell as Secretary of State, thereby becoming the first African-American woman, second African-American after Powell, and second woman after Madeleine Albright to hold this office.

Following her confirmation as secretary of state, Rice pioneered the policy of Transformational Diplomacy directed toward expanding the number of responsible democratic governments in the world and especially in the Greater Middle East. That policy faced challenges as Hamas captured a popular majority in Palestinian elections, and influential countries including Saudi Arabia and Egypt maintained authoritarian systems (with U.S. backing). While in the position, she chaired the Millennium Challenge Corporation&#x27;s board of directors. In March 2009, Rice returned to Stanford University as a political science professor and the Thomas and Barbara Stephenson Senior Fellow on Public Policy at the Hoover Institution. In September 2010, she became a faculty member of the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a director of its Global Center for Business and the Economy. In January 2020, it was announced that Rice would succeed Thomas W. Gilligan as the next director of the Hoover Institution on September 1, 2020. She is on the Board of Directors of Dropbox and Makena Capital Management, LLC.

==Early life==
Rice was born in Birmingham, Alabama, the only child of Angelena (née Ray) Rice, a high school science, music, and oratory teacher, and John Wesley Rice Jr., a high school guidance counselor, Presbyterian minister, and dean of students at Stillman College, a historically black college in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Her name, Condoleezza, derives from the music term , ). Rice has roots in the American South going back to the pre–Civil War era, and some of her ancestors worked as sharecroppers for a time after emancipation. Rice discovered on the PBS series &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; that she is of 51% African, 40% European, and 9% Asian or Native American genetic descent, while her mtDNA is traced back to the Tikar people of Cameroon.

In her 2017 book, &quot;&quot;, she writes, &quot;My great-great-grandmother Zina on my mother&#x27;s side bore five children by different slave owners&quot; and &quot;My great-grandmother on my father&#x27;s side, Julia Head, carried the name of the slave owner and was so favored by him that he taught her to read.&quot; Rice grew up in the Titusville neighborhood of Birmingham, and then Tuscaloosa, Alabama, at a time when the South was racially segregated. The Rices lived on the campus of Stillman College.

Rice began to learn French, music, figure skating and ballet at the age of three. At the age of fifteen, she began piano classes with the goal of becoming a concert pianist.

===Education===
In 1967, the family moved to Denver, Colorado. She attended St. Mary&#x27;s Academy, an all-girls Catholic high school in Cherry Hills Village, Colorado, and graduated at age 16 in 1971. Rice enrolled at the University of Denver, where her father worked at the time.

Rice initially majored in music, and after her sophomore year, she went to the Aspen Music Festival and School. There, she later said, she met students of greater talent than herself, and she doubted her career prospects as a pianist. She began to consider an alternative major. She attended an International Politics course taught by Josef Korbel, which sparked her interest in the Soviet Union and international relations. Rice later described Korbel (who is the father of Madeleine Albright, then a future U.S. Secretary of State), as a central figure in her life.

In 1974, at age 19, Rice was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa society, and was awarded a B.A. degree &quot;cum laude&quot; in political science by the University of Denver. While at the University of Denver she was a member of Alpha Chi Omega, Gamma Delta chapter. She obtained an M.A. degree in political science from the University of Notre Dame in 1975. She first worked in the State Department in 1977, during the Carter administration, as an intern in the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. She also studied Russian at Moscow State University in the summer of 1979, and interned with the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica, California. In 1981, at age 26, she received her Ph.D. in political science from the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver. Her dissertation centered on military policy and politics in what was then the communist state of Czechoslovakia.

From 1980 to 1981, she was a fellow at Stanford University&#x27;s Arms Control and Disarmament Program, having won a Ford Foundation Dual Expertise Fellowship in Soviet Studies and International Security. Rice was one of only four women – along with Janne E. Nolan, Cindy Roberts, and Gloria Duffy – studying international security at Stanford on fellowships at the time. Her fellowship at Stanford began her academic affiliation with the university and time in Northern California.

===Early political views===
Rice was a Democrat until 1982, when she changed her political affiliation to Republican, in part because she disagreed with the foreign policy of Democratic President Jimmy Carter, and because of the influence of her father, who was Republican. As she told the 2000 Republican National Convention, &quot;My father joined our party because the Democrats in Jim Crow Alabama of 1952 would not register him to vote. The Republicans did.&quot;

==Academic career==

Rice was hired by Stanford University as an assistant professor of political science (1981–1987). She was promoted to associate professor in 1987, a post she held until 1993. She was a specialist on the Soviet Union and gave lectures on the subject for the Berkeley-Stanford joint program led by UC Berkeley professor George W. Breslauer in the mid-1980s.

At a 1985 meeting of arms control experts at Stanford, Rice&#x27;s performance drew the attention of Brent Scowcroft, who had served as National Security Advisor under Gerald Ford. With the election of George H. W. Bush, Scowcroft returned to the White House as National Security Adviser in 1989, and he asked Rice to become his Soviet expert on the United States National Security Council. According to R. Nicholas Burns, President Bush was &quot;captivated&quot; by Rice, and relied heavily on her advice in his dealings with Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin.

Because she would have been ineligible for tenure at Stanford if she had been absent for more than two years, she returned there in 1991. She was taken under the wing of George Shultz (Ronald Reagan&#x27;s secretary of state from 1982 to 1989), who was a fellow at the Hoover Institution. Shultz included Rice in a &quot;luncheon club&quot; of intellectuals who met every few weeks to discuss foreign affairs. In 1992, Shultz, who was a board member of Chevron Corporation, recommended Rice for a spot on the Chevron board. Chevron was pursuing a $10 billion development project in Kazakhstan and, as a Soviet specialist, Rice knew the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev. She traveled to Kazakhstan on Chevron&#x27;s behalf and, in honor of her work, in 1993, Chevron named a 129,000-ton supertanker SS &quot;Condoleezza Rice&quot;. During this period, Rice was also appointed to the boards of Transamerica Corporation (1991) and Hewlett-Packard (1992).

===Provost promotion===
At Stanford, in 1992, Rice volunteered to serve on the search committee to replace outgoing president Donald Kennedy. The committee ultimately recommended Gerhard Casper, the provost of the University of Chicago. Casper met Rice during this search, and was so impressed that in 1993, he appointed her as Stanford&#x27;s provost, the chief budget and academic officer of the university in 1993 and she also was granted tenure and became full professor. Rice was the first female, first African-American, and youngest provost in Stanford&#x27;s history. She was also named a senior fellow of the Institute for International Studies, and a senior fellow (by courtesy) of the Hoover Institution.

Former Stanford president Gerhard Casper said the university was &quot;most fortunate in persuading someone of Professor Rice&#x27;s exceptional talents and proven ability in critical situations to take on this task. Everything she has done, she has done well; I have every confidence that she will continue that record as provost.&quot; Acknowledging Rice&#x27;s unique character, Casper told &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2002 that it &quot;would be disingenuous for me to say that the fact that she was a woman, the fact that she was black and the fact that she was young weren&#x27;t in my mind.&quot;

As Stanford&#x27;s provost, Rice was responsible for managing the university&#x27;s multibillion-dollar budget. The school at that time was running a deficit of $20 million. When Rice took office, she promised that the budget would be balanced within &quot;two years.&quot; Coit Blacker, Stanford&#x27;s deputy director of the Institute for International Studies, said there &quot;was a sort of conventional wisdom that said it couldn&#x27;t be done ... that [the deficit] was structural, that we just had to live with it.&quot; Two years later, Rice announced that the deficit had been eliminated and the university was holding a record surplus of over $14.5 million.

Rice drew protests when, as the provost, she departed from the practice of applying affirmative action to tenure decisions and unsuccessfully sought to consolidate the university&#x27;s ethnic community centers.

===Return to Stanford===
During a farewell interview in early December 2008, Rice indicated she would return to Stanford and the Hoover Institution, &quot;back west of the Mississippi where I belong,&quot; but beyond writing and teaching did not specify what her role would be. Rice&#x27;s plans for a return to campus were elaborated in an interview with the Stanford Report in January 2009. She returned to Stanford as a political science professor and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution on March 1, 2009. Condoleezza Rice is currently the Denning Professor in Global Business and the Economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business; the Thomas and Barbara Stephenson Senior Fellow on Public Policy at the Hoover Institution; and a professor of political science at Stanford University.

==Role in nuclear strategy==
In 1986, Rice was appointed special assistant to the director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to work on nuclear strategic planning as part of a Council on Foreign Relations fellowship. In 2005, Rice assumed office as Secretary of State. Rice played an important role in trying to stop the nuclear threat from North Korea and Iran.

===North Korea===
North Korea signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1985, but in 2002 revealed they were operating a secret nuclear weapons program that violated the 1994 agreement. The 1994 agreement between the United States and North Korea included North Korea agreeing to freeze and eventually dismantle its graphite moderated nuclear reactors, in exchange for international aid which would help them to build two new light-water nuclear reactors. In 2003, North Korea officially withdrew from the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Rice played a key role in the idea of &quot;six-party talks&quot; that brought China, Japan, Russia, and South Korea into discussion with North Korea and the United States.

During these discussions, Rice gave strong talks to urge North Korea to dismantle their nuclear power program. In 2005, North Korea agreed to give up its entire nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and economic benefits to ensure its survival. Despite the agreement in 2005, in 2006, North Korea test fired long range missiles. The UN Security Council demanded North Korea suspend the program. In 2007, Rice was involved in another nuclear agreement with North Korea (Pyongyang). Rice, other negotiators for the United States and four other nations (six-party talks) reached a deal with North Korea. In this deal North Korea agreed to close its main nuclear reactor in exchange for $400 million in fuel and aid.

===India===
In 2006, Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh announced the Agreement for Cooperation between the United States and India involving peaceful uses of nuclear energy. As Secretary of State, Rice was involved in the negotiation of this agreement and declared &quot;India&#x27;s society is open and free, transparent and stable. Its multiethnic and multi-religious democracy is characterized by individual freedom and the rule of law. We share common values...India is a rising global power that can be a pillar of stability in a rapidly changing Asia. India is, in short, a natural partner for the United States.&quot;

==Private sector==
Rice headed Chevron&#x27;s committee on public policy until she resigned on January 15, 2001, to become National Security Advisor to President George W. Bush. Chevron honored Rice by naming an oil tanker &quot;Condoleezza Rice&quot; after her, but controversy led to its being renamed &quot;Altair Voyager.&quot;

Rice has served as an instructor at MIT Seminar XXI. She also served on the board of directors for the Carnegie Corporation, the Charles Schwab Corporation, the Chevron Corporation, Hewlett-Packard, the Rand Corporation, the Transamerica Corporation, and other organizations.

In 1992, Rice founded the Center for New Generation, an after-school program created to raise the high school graduation numbers of East Palo Alto and eastern Menlo Park, California. After her tenure as secretary of state, Rice was approached in February 2009 to fill an open position as a Pac-10 Commissioner, but chose instead to return to Stanford University as a political science professor and the Thomas and Barbara Stephenson Senior Fellow on Public Policy at the Hoover Institution.

In 2014, Rice joined the Ban Bossy campaign as a spokesperson advocating leadership roles for girls.

On July 11, 2022, the Denver Broncos announced that Rice had joined the Walton-Penner ownership group (consisting of S. Robson Walton, Greg Penner, Carrie Walton Penner, Mellody Hobson, and Sir Lewis Hamilton), which recently agreed to buy the NFL team for $4.65 billion. On August 9, 2022, the NFL owners approved the purchase of the Denver Broncos by the Walton-Penner group.

==Early political career==
In 1986, while an international affairs fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations, Rice served as special assistant to the director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

From 1989 through March 1991 (the period of the fall of Berlin Wall and the final days of the Soviet Union), she served in President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s administration as director, and then senior director, of Soviet and East European affairs in the National Security Council, and a special assistant to the president for national security affairs. In this position, Rice wrote what would become known as the &quot;Chicken Kiev speech&quot; in which Bush advised the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&#x27;s parliament, against independence. She also helped develop Bush&#x27;s and Secretary of State James Baker&#x27;s policies in favor of German reunification. She impressed Bush, who later introduced her to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, as the one who &quot;tells me everything I know about the Soviet Union.&quot;

In 1991, Rice returned to her teaching position at Stanford, although she continued to serve as a consultant on the former Soviet Bloc for numerous clients in both the public and private sectors. Late that year, California governor Pete Wilson appointed her to a bipartisan committee that had been formed to draw new state legislative and congressional districts in the state.

In 1997, she served on the Federal Advisory Committee on Gender–Integrated Training in the Military.

During George W. Bush&#x27;s 2000 presidential election campaign, Rice took a one-year leave of absence from Stanford University to serve as his foreign policy advisor. The group of advisors she led called itself the Vulcans in honor of the monumental Vulcan statue, which sits on a hill overlooking her hometown of Birmingham, Alabama. Rice would later go on to give a at the 2000 Republican National Convention. The speech asserted that &quot;...  America&#x27;s armed forces are not a global police force. They are not the world&#x27;s 911.&quot;

==National Security Advisor (2001–2005)==
On December 16, 2000, Rice was named as National Security Advisor, upon which she stepped down from her position at Stanford. She was the first woman to occupy the post. Rice earned the nickname of &quot;Warrior Princess&quot;, reflecting strong nerve and delicate manners.

On January 18, 2003, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Rice was involved in crafting Bush&#x27;s position on race-based preferences. Rice has stated that &quot;while race-neutral means are preferable&quot;, race can be taken into account as &quot;one factor among others&quot; in university admissions policies.

===Terrorism===
During the summer of 2001, Rice met with CIA director George Tenet to discuss the possibilities and prevention of terrorist attacks on American targets. On July 10, 2001, Rice met with Tenet in what he referred to as an &quot;emergency meeting&quot; held at the White House at Tenet&#x27;s request to brief Rice and the NSC staff about the potential threat of an impending al Qaeda attack. Rice responded by asking Tenet to give a presentation on the matter to Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Attorney General John Ashcroft.

Rice characterized the August 6, 2001, President&#x27;s Daily Brief &quot;Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US&quot; as historical information. Rice indicated &quot;It was information based on old reporting.&quot; Sean Wilentz of &quot;Salon&quot; magazine suggested that the PDB contained current information based on continuing investigations, including that Bin Laden wanted to &quot;bring the fighting to America.&quot; On September 11, 2001, Rice was scheduled to outline a new national security policy that included missile defense as a cornerstone and played down the threat of stateless terrorism.
When asked in 2006 about the July 2001 meeting, Rice asserted she did not recall the specific meeting, commenting that she had met &quot;repeatedly&quot; with Tenet that summer about terrorist threats. Moreover, she stated that it was &quot;incomprehensible&quot; to her that she had ignored terrorist threats two months before the September 11 attacks.

In 2003, Rice received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

In August 2010, Rice received the U.S. Air Force Academy&#x27;s 2009 Thomas D. White National Defense Award for contributions to the defense and security of the United States.

===Subpoenas===
In March 2004, Rice declined to testify before the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (the 9/11 Commission). The White House claimed executive privilege under constitutional separation of powers and cited past tradition. Under pressure, Bush agreed to allow her to testify so long as it did not create a precedent of presidential staff being required to appear before Congress when so requested.
In April 2007, Rice rejected, on grounds of executive privilege, a House subpoena regarding the prewar claim that Iraq sought yellowcake uranium from Niger.

===Iraq===

Rice was a proponent of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. After Iraq delivered its declaration of weapons of mass destruction to the United Nations on December 8, 2002, Rice wrote an editorial for &quot;The New York Times&quot; entitled &quot;Why We Know Iraq Is Lying&quot;. In a January 10, 2003, interview with CNN&#x27;s Wolf Blitzer, Rice made headlines by stating regarding Iraqi president Saddam Hussein&#x27;s nuclear capabilities: &quot;The problem here is that there will always be some uncertainty about how quickly he can acquire nuclear weapons. But we don&#x27;t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.&quot;

In October 2003, Rice was named to run the &quot;Iraq Stabilization Group,&quot; to &quot;quell violence in Iraq and Afghanistan and to speed the reconstruction of both countries.&quot; By May 2004, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the council had become virtually nonexistent.

Leading up to the 2004 presidential election, Rice became the first National Security Advisor to campaign for an incumbent president. She stated that while: &quot;Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with the actual attacks on America, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq was a part of the Middle East that was festering and unstable, [and] was part of the circumstances that created the problem on September 11.&quot;

After the invasion, when it became clear that Iraq did not have nuclear WMD capability, critics called Rice&#x27;s claims a &quot;hoax&quot;, &quot;deception&quot; and &quot;demagogic scare tactic&quot;. Dana Milbank and Mike Allen wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;: &quot;Either she missed or overlooked numerous warnings from intelligence agencies seeking to put caveats on claims about Iraq&#x27;s nuclear weapons program, or she made public claims that she knew to be false&quot;.

===Role in authorizing use of torture===
A Senate Intelligence Committee reported that on July 17, 2002, Rice met with CIA director George Tenet to personally convey the Bush administration&#x27;s approval of the proposed waterboarding of alleged Al Qaeda leader Abu Zubaydah. &quot;Days after Dr Rice gave Mr Tenet her approval, the Justice Department approved the use of waterboarding in a top secret August 1 memo.&quot; Waterboarding is considered to be torture by a wide range of authorities, including legal experts, war veterans, intelligence officials, military judges, human rights organizations, former U.S. attorney general Eric Holder, and many senior politicians, including former U.S. President Barack Obama.

In 2003 Rice, Vice President Dick Cheney and Attorney General John Ashcroft met with the CIA again and were briefed on the use of waterboarding and other methods including week-long sleep deprivation, forced nudity and the use of stress positions. The Senate report says that the Bush administration officials &quot;reaffirmed that the CIA program was lawful and reflected administration policy&quot;.

The Senate report also &quot;suggests Miss Rice played a more significant role than she acknowledged in written testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee submitted in the autumn.&quot; At that time, she had acknowledged attending meetings to discuss the CIA&#x27;s use of torture, but she claimed that she could not recall the details, and she &quot;omitted her direct role in approving the program in her written statement to the committee.&quot;

In a conversation with a student at Stanford University in April 2009, Rice stated that she did not authorize the CIA to use the torture. Rice said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t authorize anything. I conveyed the authorization of the administration to the agency that they had policy authorization, subject to the Justice Department&#x27;s clearance. That&#x27;s what I did.&quot; She added, &quot;We were told, nothing that violates our obligations under the Convention Against Torture. And so, by definition, if it was authorized by the president, it did not violate our obligations under the Conventions Against Torture.&quot;

In 2015, citing her role in authorizing the use of so-called &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot;, Human Rights Watch called for the investigation of Rice &quot;for conspiracy to torture as well as other crimes.&quot;

==Secretary of State (2005–2009)==


On November 16, 2004, Bush nominated Rice to be Secretary of State. On January 26, 2005, the Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 85–13. The negative votes, the most cast against any nomination for Secretary of State since 1825, came from Senators who, according to Senator Barbara Boxer, wanted &quot;to hold Dr. Rice and the Bush administration accountable for their failures in Iraq and in the war on terrorism.&quot; Their reasoning was that Rice had acted irresponsibly in equating Saddam&#x27;s regime with Islamist terrorism and some could not accept her previous record. Senator Robert Byrd, a prominent Senate institutionalist who was concerned with executive over-reach, voted against Rice&#x27;s appointment, indicating that she &quot;has asserted that the President holds far more of the war power than the Constitution grants him.&quot;

As Secretary of State, Rice championed the expansion of democratic governments and other American values: &quot;American values are universal.&quot; &quot;An international order that reflects our values is the best guarantee of our enduring national interest...&quot; Rice stated that the September 11 attacks in 2001 were rooted in &quot;oppression and despair&quot; and so, the U.S. must advance democratic reform and support basic rights throughout the greater Middle East.

Rice also reformed and restructured the department, as well as U.S. diplomacy as a whole. &quot;Transformational Diplomacy&quot; is the goal that Rice describes as &quot;work[ing] with our many partners around the world ... [and] build[ing] and sustain[ing] democratic, well-governed states that will respond to the needs of their people and conduct themselves responsibly in the international system.&quot;
As Secretary of State, Rice traveled heavily and initiated many diplomatic efforts on behalf of the Bush administration; she holds the record for most miles logged in the position. Her diplomacy relied on strong presidential support and is considered to be the continuation of style defined by former Republican secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and James Baker.
==Post–Bush administration==
After the end of the Bush Administration, Rice returned to academia and joined the Council on Foreign Relations.

=== Public appearances and commentary ===
In October 2010, Rice met with President Obama for a discussion on national security issues. In November, Rice participated in the groundbreaking of the George W. Bush Presidential Center. Two years later, Rice introduced world leaders such as Tony Blair and Jose Maria Aznar at the center&#x27;s dedication ceremony.

In May 2011, after the killing of Osama bin Laden, Rice told Zain Verjee that bin Laden&#x27;s death was &quot;gratifying because for our country this brings an important chapter to a close and it shows that the United States can, with patience and persistence, do something like this.&quot; She argued against removing troops from Afghanistan until the US finished helping the country &quot;get more decent governance&quot;. That year, she appeared as herself on the NBC sitcom &quot;30 Rock&quot; in the fifth-season episode &quot;Everything Sunny All the Time Always&quot;, in which she engages in a classical-music duel with Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin). Within the world of the show, Donaghy had had a relationship with Rice during the show&#x27;s first season.

In May 2012, Rice served as the keynote speaker at the Southern Methodist University commencement ceremony. Rice delivered a speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention. Daniel W. Drezner of &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; praised Rice&#x27;s address as the best speech of the convention.

In 2013, Rice charged Iran with having &quot;done everything to make certain that you can&#x27;t trust them&quot;, citing Iran&#x27;s decades-long hiding of its nuclear program and giving the International Atomic Energy Agency &quot;the runaround.&quot; In 2015, Rice initially declined taking a public position on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action &quot;because I know how hard it is to be in there as opposed to out here&quot;, but added, &quot;This particular deal I think has some good elements but the price that was paid was pretty high. It&#x27;s entirely possible that they are already at threshold status and we will never know it.&quot; As the Trump administration weighed pulling out of the agreement, Rice said she would have &quot;stayed in for alliance management reasons more than anything else&quot; and charged the verification methods of the deal as not being &quot;very strong.&quot;

In August 2015, High Point University announced that Rice would speak at the 2016 commencement ceremony. Her commencement address was highlighted by &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, &quot;Fortune&quot;, &quot;Business Insider&quot;, NBC News, &quot;Time&quot;, and &quot;USA Today&quot;.
On January 26, 2017, Rice participated in a talk with the University of San Francisco, where she opined that the United States had entered &quot;uncharted territory&quot; with President Donald Trump due to his lack of government experience and that the new president should be given time to realize the limitations of his powers.
On March 31, Rice met with Vice President Mike Pence and President Trump at the White House. In May, Rice said that alleged Russian hacking of DNC emails should &quot;absolutely not&quot; delegitimize Trump&#x27;s presidency.

Rice supported the Trump administration &quot;painting a very bleak picture for the Chinese&quot;, opining that the cabinet saw the region as the only country with leverage over North Korea. In 2018, Rice called decisions by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to make overtures to the South Koreans &quot;clever&quot; and expressed that he was more isolated and reckless than his father. Ahead of the Singapore Summit, Rice stated her support for negotiations with North Korea, but warned the US should &quot;go step by step, make sure there&#x27;s good verification of everything the North Koreans are doing, and keep your eye on the prize of denuclearization. Because what we want to do is stop them short of threatening the American homeland.&quot;

By September 2019, Rice had publicly stated her dislike for Trump&#x27;s rhetoric, especially on immigration, and warned that Trump needed &quot;to be a lot more careful in the way that he speaks about these things because race is a very delicate and raw nerve in America.&quot; In November, as House Democrats moved forward with their impeachment inquiry into President Trump for his correspondence with Ukraine, Rice commented that she did not &quot;like for the President of the United States to mention an American citizen for investigation to a foreign leader&quot; and that she was troubled by &quot;a state of conflict between the foreign policy professionals and someone in Rudy Giuliani who says he was acting on behalf of the President.&quot;

In August 2021, Rice wrote an op-ed arguing that the United States withdrew from Afghanistan too quickly and called claims that Afghans were to blame for the Taliban takeover a &quot;corrosive and deeply unfair narrative&quot;. In October, Rice appeared as a guest cohost on &quot;The View&quot;, where she asserted that Americans were more interested in household issues than continuing to investigate the January 6 United States Capitol attack. In December, Rice joined Governor of Alabama Kay Ivey in Birmingham to announce the recommendations of the Alabama Innovation Commission, which had worked with the Hoover Institution, on means of advancing statewide technology and entrepreneurship.

In April 2022, Rice attended Madeleine Albright&#x27;s funeral, where she delivered a reading from the Bible. In July, Rice participated in an Aspen Security Forum with fellow former National Security Advisors Thomas E. Donilon and Stephen Hadley. In October, Rice met with Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the Hoover Institution Hauck Auditorium and asked the incumbent about issues such as protests in Iran and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In 2023, after former President Trump and Governor of Florida Ron DeSantis criticized US support for Ukraine, Rice stressed the need for any potential presidential candidates to understand the essence of the conflict, which she defined as &quot;defending a rules-based system that says might doesn&#x27;t make right, you can&#x27;t just extinguish your neighbor.&quot;

=== Author ===
In February 2009, it was announced that Rice had signed a three-book deal with Crown Publishers worth at least $2.5 million. Crown reported that Rice would &quot;combine candid narrative and acute analysis to tell the story of her time in the White House and as America&#x27;s top diplomat, and her role in protecting American security and shaping foreign policy during the extraordinary period from 2001-2009.&quot; In 2010, Rice released &quot;Extraordinary, Ordinary People: A Memoir of Family&quot;, an account of her upbringing. John McWhorter of &quot;The New York Times&quot; summarized, &quot;If there is a lesson from Rice&#x27;s book, it is that the civil rights revolution made it possible for an extremely talented black person (a woman, no less) to embrace a race-neutral subject and ride it into service as secretary of state, all the while thinking of herself largely as just a person.&quot; In 2011, Rice wrote &quot;No Higher Honor: A Memoir of My Years in Washington&quot;, a memoir of her time in the Bush administration. In an interview with George Stephanopoulos, Rice explained that she chose the title &quot;because there really is no higher honor than serving your country&quot; and named the Bush administration&#x27;s attempts to consider &quot;a different kind of Middle East&quot; the hardest challenge they faced. Susan Chira wrote that the book &quot;shows us two Condoleezza Rices: one, the impatient unilateralist who was national security adviser, the other the born-again diplomat who, as secretary of state, worked to repair some of the damage that had been done to American credibility by its unilateralism.&quot;

It was announced in 2013 that Rice was writing a book to be published in 2015 by Henry Holt &amp; Company.

In 2017, Rice released &quot;&quot;, a book in which she makes the case for democracy over totalitarianism or authoritarianism. In an interview, Rice said she began writing the book three years before its release and pondered that her desire to write about democracy stemmed from her youth in Birmingham &quot;when black citizens did not experience full democracy&quot; under segregation.

===College Football Playoff Selection Committee===
In October 2013, Rice was selected to be one of the thirteen inaugural members of the College Football Playoff selection committee. Her appointment caused a minor controversy in the sport. In October 2014, she revealed that she watched &quot;14 or 15 games every week live on TV on Saturdays and recorded games on Sundays.&quot; Her term on the committee expired at the conclusion of the 2016 college football season.

===Cleveland Browns Head Coach rumors===

On November 18, 2018 ESPN&#x27;s Adam Schefter reported that a league source had told him that Rice was being considered as a candidate in the Cleveland Browns&#x27; head coach search. This report sparked jokes at the expense of the Browns and outcry due to both Rice&#x27;s lack of any experience in coaching and Rice being a woman. Shortly after the initial report, the Browns and General Manager John Dorsey denied the report saying, &quot;Our coaching search will be thorough and deliberate, but we are still in the process of composing the list of candidates and Secretary Rice has not been discussed.&quot; Rice, who is a lifelong Browns fan, also denied the reports but joked that she &quot;would like to call a play or two next season if the Browns need ideas.&quot;

===Speculation on political future===

As early as 2003, there were reports that Rice was considering a run for governor of California, while ruling out running for the Senate in 2004. There was also speculation that Rice would run for the Republican nomination in the 2008 primaries, which she ruled out on &quot;Meet the Press&quot;. On February 22, 2008, Rice played down any suggestion that she may be on the Republican vice presidential ticket: &quot;I have always said that the one thing that I have not seen myself doing is running for elected office in the United States.&quot;

During an interview with the editorial board of &quot;The Washington Times&quot; on March 27, 2008, Rice said she was &quot;not interested&quot; in running for vice president. In a Gallup poll from March 24 to 27, 2008, Rice was mentioned by eight percent of Republican respondents to be their first choice to be John McCain&#x27;s Republican vice presidential running mate, slightly behind Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney.

Republican strategist Dan Senor said on ABC&#x27;s &quot;This Week&quot; on April 6, 2008, that &quot;Condi Rice has been actively, actually in recent weeks, campaigning for&quot; the vice presidential nomination. He based this assessment on her attendance of Grover Norquist&#x27;s Americans for Tax Reform conservative leader&#x27;s meeting on March 26, 2008. In response to Senor&#x27;s comments, Rice&#x27;s spokesperson denied that Rice was seeking the vice presidential nomination, saying, &quot;If she is actively seeking the vice presidency, then she&#x27;s the last one to know about it.&quot;

In August 2008, the speculation about a potential McCain–Rice ticket finally ended when then-Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska was selected as McCain&#x27;s running-mate.

In early December 2008, Rice praised President-elect Barack Obama&#x27;s selection of New York senator Hillary Clinton to succeed her as Secretary of State, saying &quot;she&#x27;s terrific&quot;. Rice, who spoke to Clinton after her selection, said Clinton &quot;is someone of intelligence and she&#x27;ll do a great job&quot;.

Rumors arose once again during the 2012 presidential race that presumptive nominee Mitt Romney was looking into vetting Rice for the vice presidency. Rice once again denied any such intentions or desires to become the vice president, reiterating in numerous interviews that she &quot;is a policy maker, not a politician.&quot; Speculation ended in August 2012 when Romney announced that Representative Paul Ryan was chosen as his running-mate. Rice campaigned for the Romney-Ryan ticket in the general election.

According to Bob Woodward&#x27;s 2018 book &quot;&quot;, then-Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus told then Republican nominee Donald Trump, that he should drop out of the race for the good of the party following the release of the &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; tapes. During these discussions, it was revealed that Mike Pence, the vice presidential nominee, had agreed to replace Trump on the top of the ticket as the Republican presidential nominee, with Rice agreeing to be Pence&#x27;s running mate.

While promoting his book &quot;Out of Many, One: Portraits of America&#x27;s Immigrants&quot;, former President Bush revealed he wrote-in Rice in the 2020 election and said that although Rice was aware of the vote, she told him she &quot;would refuse to accept the office.&quot;

==Political positions==
Condoleezza Rice is often described as a centrist or moderate Republican. On The Issues, a non-partisan organization which rates candidates based on their policy positions, considers Rice to be a centrist. She takes both liberal and conservative positions; she is pro-choice on abortion, supports gun rights, opposes same-sex marriage but supports civil unions, and supports building oil pipelines such as the Keystone XL pipeline.

===Terrorist activity===
Rice&#x27;s policy as Secretary of State viewed counter-terrorism as a matter of being preventative, and not merely punitive. In an interview on December 18, 2005, Rice stated: &quot;We have to remember that in this war on terrorism, we&#x27;re not talking about criminal activity where you can allow somebody to commit the crime and then you go back and you arrest them and you question them. If they succeed in committing their crime, then hundreds or indeed thousands of people die. That&#x27;s why you have to prevent, and intelligence is the long pole in the tent in preventing attacks.&quot;

Rice has promoted the idea that counterterrorism involves not only confronting the governments and organizations that promote and condone terrorism, but also the ideologies that fuel terrorism. In a speech given on July 29, 2005, Rice asserted that &quot;[s]ecuring America from terrorist attack is more than a matter of law enforcement. We must also confront the ideology of hatred in foreign societies by supporting the universal hope of liberty and the inherent appeal of democracy.&quot;
In January 2005, during Bush&#x27;s second inaugural ceremonies, Rice first used the term &quot;outposts of tyranny&quot; to refer to countries Rice thought to threaten world peace and human rights. This term has been called a descendant of Bush&#x27;s phrase, &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;, used to describe Iraq, Iran and North Korea. She identified six such &quot;outposts&quot; in which she said the United States has a duty to foster freedom: Cuba, Zimbabwe, Burma and Belarus, as well as Iran and North Korea.

===Abortion===
Rice said &quot;If you go back to 2000 when I helped the president in the campaign. I said that I was, in effect, kind of libertarian on this issue. And meaning by that, that I have been concerned about a government role in this issue. I am a strong proponent of parental choice—of parental notification. I am a strong proponent of a ban on late-term abortion. These are all things that I think unite people and I think that that&#x27;s where we should be. I&#x27;ve called myself at times mildly pro-choice.&quot; She would not want the federal government &quot;forcing its views on one side or the other.&quot; She did not want the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, to be overturned.

Rice said she believes President Bush &quot;has been in exactly the right place&quot; on abortion, &quot;which is we have to respect the culture of life and we have to try and bring people to have respect for it and make this as rare a circumstance as possible&quot;. However, she added that she has been &quot;concerned about a government role&quot; but has &quot;tended to agree with those who do not favor federal funding for abortion, because I believe that those who hold a strong moral view on the other side should not be forced to fund&quot; the procedure.

=== Affirmative action ===
Rice has taken a centrist approach to &quot;race and gender preferences&quot; in affirmative action policies. She described affirmative action as being &quot;still needed,&quot; but she does not support quotas.

===Female empowerment advocacy===
In March 2014, Rice joined and appeared in video spots for the Ban Bossy campaign, a television and social media campaign designed to ban the word &quot;bossy&quot; from general use because of its harmful effect on young girls. Several video spots with other notable spokespersons including Beyoncé, Jennifer Garner and others were produced along with a web site providing school training material, leadership tips, and an online pledge form to which visitors can promise not to use the word.

=== Immigration ===
Condoleezza Rice supported the comprehensive immigration plan backed by the Bush administration and shared that it was among her regrets that it did not pass through Congress. In 2014, Rice criticized the Obama administration from seeking to approve immigration reforms through executive action. In February 2017 Rice publicly announced her opposition to the Trump administration&#x27;s travel ban.

=== Gun rights ===
Rice says that she became a &quot;Second Amendment absolutist&quot; due to her experience of growing up in Birmingham and facing threats from the KKK. &quot;Rice&#x27;s fondness for the Second Amendment began while watching her father sit on the porch with a gun, ready to defend his family against the Klan&#x27;s night riders.&quot;

=== Same-sex marriage and LGBT issues ===
While Rice does not support same-sex marriage, she does support civil unions. In 2010, Rice stated that she believed &quot;marriage is between a man and a woman ... But perhaps we will decide that there needs to be some way for people to express their desire to live together through civil union.&quot; When asked to select a view on a survey, Rice selected a response that said &quot;Same-sex couples should be allowed to form civil unions, but not marry in the traditional sense.&quot;

===Confederate monuments===
In May 2017, Rice said she opposes the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials or the renaming of buildings named after Confederate generals. She argued, &quot;If you forget your history, you&#x27;re likely to repeat it. ... When you start wiping out your history, sanitizing your history to make you feel better, it&#x27;s a bad thing.&quot;

==Racial discrimination==
Rice experienced firsthand the injustices of Birmingham&#x27;s discriminatory laws and attitudes. She was instructed by her parents to walk proudly in public and to use the facilities at home rather than subject herself to the indignity of &quot;colored&quot; facilities in town. As Rice recalls, &quot;they refused to allow the limits and injustices of their time to limit our horizons.&quot;
However, Rice recalls various times in which she suffered discrimination on account of her race, which included being relegated to a storage room at a department store instead of a regular dressing room, being barred from going to the circus or the local amusement park, being denied hotel rooms, and even being given bad food at restaurants. Also, while Rice was mostly kept by her parents from areas where she might face discrimination, she was very aware of the civil rights struggle and the problems of Jim Crow laws in Birmingham. A neighbor, Juliemma Smith, described how &quot;[Condi] used to call me and say things like, &#x27;Did you see what Bull Connor did today?&#x27; She was just a little girl and she did that all the time. I would have to read the newspaper thoroughly because I wouldn&#x27;t know what she was going to talk about.&quot; Rice herself said of the segregation era: &quot;Those terrible events burned into my consciousness. I missed many days at my segregated school because of the frequent bomb threats.&quot;

During the violent days of the Civil Rights Movement, Reverend Rice armed himself and kept guard over the house while Condoleezza practiced the piano inside. Reverend Rice instilled in his daughter and students that black people would have to prove themselves worthy of advancement, and would simply have to be &quot;twice as good&quot; to overcome injustices built into the system.

Rice said &quot;My parents were very strategic, I was going to be so well prepared, and I was going to do all of these things that were revered in white society so well, that I would be armored somehow from racism. I would be able to confront white society on its own terms.&quot;
While the Rices supported the goals of the civil rights movement, they did not agree with the idea of putting their child in harm&#x27;s way.

Rice was eight when her schoolmate Denise McNair, aged 11, was murdered in the bombing of the primarily black Sixteenth Street Baptist Church by white supremacists on September 15, 1963. Rice has commented upon that moment in her life:

==Legacy==

Rice has appeared four times on the Time 100, &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the world&#x27;s 100 most influential people. Rice is one of only nine people in the world whose influence has been considered enduring enough to have made the list—first compiled in 1999 as a retrospective of the 20th century and made an annual feature in 2004—so frequently. However, the list contains people who have the influence to change for better or for worse, and &quot;Time&quot; has also accused her of squandering her influence, stating on February 1, 2007, that her &quot;accomplishments as Secretary of State have been modest, and even those have begun to fade&quot; and that she &quot;has been slow to recognize the extent to which the U.S.&#x27;s prestige has declined.&quot; In its March 19, 2007, issue it followed up stating that Rice was &quot;executing an unmistakable course correction in U.S. foreign policy.&quot;

In 2004 and 2005, she was ranked as the most powerful woman in the world by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine and number two in 2006 (following the chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel).

===Criticism from Senator Barbara Boxer===
California Democratic senator Barbara Boxer has also criticized Rice in relation to the war in Iraq. During Rice&#x27;s confirmation hearing for U.S. secretary of state in January 2005, Boxer stated, &quot;I personally believe—this is my personal view—that your loyalty to the mission you were given, to sell the war, overwhelmed your respect for the truth.&quot;

On January 11, 2007, Boxer, during a debate over the war in Iraq, said, &quot;Now, the issue is who pays the price, who pays the price? I&#x27;m not going to pay a personal price. My kids are too old, and my grandchild is too young. You&#x27;re not going to pay a particular price, as I understand it, within immediate family. So who pays the price? The American military and their families, and I just want to bring us back to that fact.&quot;

The &quot;New York Post&quot; and White House press secretary Tony Snow called Boxer&#x27;s statement an attack on Rice&#x27;s status as a single, childless female and referred to Boxer&#x27;s comments as &quot;a great leap backward for feminism.&quot; Rice later echoed Snow&#x27;s remarks, saying &quot;I thought it was okay to not have children, and I thought you could still make good decisions on behalf of the country if you were single and didn&#x27;t have children.&quot; Boxer responded to the controversy by saying &quot;They&#x27;re getting this off on a non-existent thing that I didn&#x27;t say. I&#x27;m saying, she&#x27;s like me, we do not have families who are in the military.&quot;

===Conservative criticism===

According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in late July 2008, former undersecretary of state and U.N. ambassador John R. Bolton was referring to Rice and her allies in the Bush Administration whom he believes abandoned earlier hard-line principles when he said: &quot;Once the collapse begins, adversaries have a real opportunity to gain advantage. In terms of the Bush presidency, this many reversals this close to the end destroys credibility ... It appears there is no depth to which this administration will not sink in its last days.&quot;

Former secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld repeatedly criticized Rice after their terms in office ended. In his book &quot;Known and Unknown: A Memoir&quot;, he portrayed her as a young, inexperienced academic who did not know her place. In 2011, she responded, saying that Rumsfeld &quot;doesn&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s talking about.&quot; She further addresses the issue in her own book, saying &quot;He would become frustrated when my staff would reach out to military officers in the Pentagon to coordinate the particulars of a policy among the agencies. This was a routine responsibility for the NSC, but for some reason Don interpreted such actions as a violation of his authority.&quot;

In his book &quot;In My Time&quot;, Dick Cheney suggested that Rice had misled the president about nuclear diplomacy with North Korea, saying that she was naïve. He called her advice on the issue &quot;utterly misleading.&quot; He also chided Rice for clashing with White House advisers on the tone of the president&#x27;s speeches on Iraq and said that she, as the secretary of state, ruefully conceded to him that the Bush administration should not have apologized for a claim the president made in his 2003 State of the Union address, on Saddam&#x27;s supposed search for yellowcake uranium. She &quot;came into my office, sat down in the chair next to my desk, and tearfully admitted I had been right,&quot; Cheney wrote. Rice responded: &quot;It certainly doesn&#x27;t sound like me, now, does it?&quot;, saying that she viewed the book as an &quot;attack on my integrity.&quot;

Rice has also been criticized by other conservatives. Stephen Hayes of the &quot;Weekly Standard&quot; accused her of jettisoning the Bush Doctrine, including the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. Other conservatives criticized her for her approach to Russia policy and other issues.

===Views within the Black American community===
Rice&#x27;s ratings decreased following a heated battle for her confirmation as Secretary of State and following Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. Rice&#x27;s rise within the George W. Bush administration initially drew a largely positive response from many in the black community. In a 2002 survey, then National Security Advisor Rice was viewed favorably by 41% of black respondents, but another 40% did not know Rice well enough to rate her and her profile remained comparatively obscure. As her role increased, some black commentators began to express doubts concerning Rice&#x27;s stances and statements on various issues. In 2005, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; columnist Eugene Robinson asked, &quot;How did [Rice] come to a worldview so radically different from that of most black Americans?&quot;

In August 2005, American musician, actor, and social activist Harry Belafonte, who served on the Board of TransAfrica, referred to blacks in the Bush administration as &quot;black tyrants.&quot; Belafonte&#x27;s comments received mixed reactions.

Rice dismissed these criticisms during a September 14, 2005 interview when she said, &quot;Why would I worry about something like that? ... The fact of the matter is I&#x27;ve been black all my life. Nobody needs to tell me how to be black.&quot;

Black commentators have defended Rice, including Mike Espy, Andrew Young, C. Delores Tucker (chair of the National Congress of Black Women), Clarence Page, Colbert King, Dorothy Height (chair and president emerita of the National Council of Negro Women) and Kweisi Mfume (Congressman and former CEO of the NAACP).

==Family and personal life==
Rice has never married and has no children. In the 1970s, she dated and was briefly engaged to professional American football player Rick Upchurch but left him because, according to biographer Marcus Mabry, she &quot;knew the relationship wasn&#x27;t going to work.&quot;

Rice&#x27;s mother, Angelena Rice, died of breast cancer in 1985, aged 61, when Rice was 30. In 1989, Rice&#x27;s father, John Wesley Rice, wed Clara Bailey, to whom he remained married until his death in 2000, aged 77.

From 2003 to 2017, Rice co-owned a house in Palo Alto, California with Randy Bean. According to public records, the two initially bought the house with a third investor, Stanford University professor Coit D. Blacker, who later sold his line of credit to the two women. The property arrangement was first revealed in Glenn Kessler&#x27;s book &quot;The Confidante: Condoleezza Rice and the Creation of the Bush Legacy&quot; (2007), sparking rumors about the nature of Rice and Bean&#x27;s relationship. Kessler has stated he &quot;did not know if this meant there was something more to the relationship between the women beyond a friendship.&quot;

On August 20, 2012, Rice was one of the first two women to be admitted as members to Augusta National Golf Club; the other was South Carolina financier Darla Moore. In 2014, Rice was named to the ESPNW Impact 25. Rice has described her faith as Presbyterian, being a noted member of .

===Music===

At the age of 15, Rice played a Mozart Piano Concerto with the Denver Symphony Orchestra, her prize for winning a student music competition. Until college, she planned to become a professional pianist and still plays with an amateur chamber music group in Washington. She accompanied cellist Yo-Yo Ma in playing Johannes Brahms&#x27; Violin Sonata in D minor at Constitution Hall in April 2002 for the National Medal of Arts Awards.

She has performed at diplomatic events at embassies, including a performance for Queen Elizabeth II, and she has performed in public with cellist Yo-Yo Ma and singer Aretha Franklin. In 2005, Rice accompanied Charity Sunshine Tillemann-Dick, a 21-year-old soprano, for a benefit concert for the Pulmonary Hypertension Association at the Kennedy Center in Washington. She performed briefly during her cameo appearance in the &quot;Everything Sunny All the Time Always&quot; episode of &quot;30 Rock&quot;. She has stated that her favorite composer is Johannes Brahms, because she thinks Brahms&#x27;s music is &quot;passionate but not sentimental.&quot; On a complementary note, Rice has revealed on multiple occasions that she enjoys the band Led Zeppelin, and in a 2009 appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with Jay Leno, she stated that it was her favorite band.

As Secretary of State, Rice was &quot;ex officio&quot; a member of the Board of Trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. As the end of their tenures approached in January 2009, outgoing President Bush appointed her to a six-year term on the board of trustees.

<doc id="158178" wikidata="Q1012390" url="?curid=158178" title="Cromarty">
<text>Cromarty (; , ) is a town, civil parish and former royal burgh in Ross and Cromarty, in the Highland area of Scotland. Situated at the tip of the Black Isle on the southern shore of the mouth of Cromarty Firth, it is seaward from Invergordon on the opposite coast. In the 2001 census, it had a population of 719.

==History==
The name &quot;Cromarty&quot; variously derives from the Gaelic &quot;crom&quot; (crooked), and from &quot;bati&quot; (bay), or from &quot;àrd&quot; (height), meaning either the &quot;crooked bay&quot;, or the &quot;bend between the heights&quot; (referring to the high rocks, or Sutors, which guard the entrance to the Firth), and gave the title to the Earldom of Cromartie. In 1264, its name was &quot;Crumbathyn&quot;.

Cromarty is a sea port, and its economy was closely linked to the sea for most of its history. Fishing was the major industry, with salmon stations around the surrounding coast, and boats going out to catch herring. Other trade was also by boat: Cromarty&#x27;s connections to surrounding towns were largely by ferry, while Cromarty boats exported locally-grown hemp fibre, and brought goods such as coal. The Cromarty Firth is an outstanding natural harbour, and was an important British naval base during the First World War and the Second World War. HMS &quot;Natal&quot; blew up close by on 30 December 1915 with a substantial loss of life. On the 26th of January 1940, HMS (Previously RMS) &quot;Durham Castle&quot;, while being towed to Scapa Flow hit a mine laid by U-Boat &quot;U-57&quot; 11 nautical miles to the east of the town. Cromarty gives its name to one of the sea areas of the British Shipping Forecast.

Cromarty Castle was the seat of the Urquharts, who were the hereditary sheriffs of Cromarty. The town was a royal burgh, and the ferry to Nigg was on the royal pilgrimage route north to Tain. In 1513 James IV of Scotland went on a pilgrimage and stayed in Cromarty Castle for 1 night. Until 1890, it served as the county town of Cromartyshire.
The site of the town&#x27;s mediaeval burgh dating to at least the 12th century was identified by local archaeologists after winter storms in 2012 eroded sections of the shoreline. A community archaeology project, which began in 2013, is investigated the remains of roads and buildings at the site on the eastern edge of the present town.

Cromarty was the birthplace of Sir Thomas Urquhart, the polymath Royalist most famous as the first translator of Rabelais into English.

In the nineteenth century, Cromarty was the birthplace and home of Hugh Miller, a geologist, writer, journalist and participant in the Disruptions in the Church of Scotland. Among his works was a collection of local folklore, such as the legend, dating from around 1740, that a Cromarty man named John Reid was granted three wishes from a mermaid, and that he used one of the wishes to marry a woman named Helen Stuart.

==Geography==
The burgh is noted as a base for viewing the local offshore sea life. These include one of the most northerly groups of bottlenose dolphins. Cromarty, along with Chanonry Point just round the coast, is one of the best places in Europe to see these animals close to the shore.

The predominant local stone is the Old Red Sandstone about which Hugh Miller wrote. Many fossils can also be found in the rocks along the coast.

==Governance==
=== UK Parliamentary constituency ===
Cromarty is in the UK Parliament constituency of Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, represented since 2024 by Jamie Stone.

Following the Act of Union in 1707, the British parliamentary constituency of Cromartyshire was created, replacing the former Parliament of Scotland shire constituency. also called Cromartyshire. Paired as an alternating constituency with neighbouring Nairnshire, the freeholders of Cromartyshire elected one Member of Parliament to one Parliament, while those of Nairnshire elected a Member to the next. In 1832 the town of Cromarty was separated from the county, and became a parliamentary burgh, combined with Dingwall, Dornoch, Kirkwall, Tain and Wick in the Northern Burghs constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Known also as &quot;Wick Burghs&quot;, the constituency was a district of burghs. It was represented by one Member of Parliament. In 1918, the constituency was abolished and the Cromarty component was merged into the county constituency of Ross and Cromarty. Following a boundary change in 1983, the sitting MP, Hamish Gray (Conservative and Unionist Party) was defeated by Charlie Kennedy (SDP, later Liberal then Liberal Democrats), who would go on to lead the Liberal Democrats, and who represented Cromarty until 2015, as the MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (1983–1997), Ross, Skye and Inverness West (1997–2005) and then Ross, Skye and Lochaber.(2005-2015) Cromarty was represented by Ian Blackford from 2015 until 2024 when Ross, Skye and Lochaber was abolished. Cromarty then became part of Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross.

=== Scottish Parliament Constituency ===
In the Scottish Parliament, Cromarty has been represented since 2016 by Kate Forbes, an SNP politician and former Cabinet Secretary for Finance in the Scottish Government, as part of the Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch constituency. Prior to 2011, it was part of the Ross, Skye and Inverness West Constituency. As well as the constituency MSP, Cromarty is represented by seven additional-member MSPs, elected across the Highlands and Islands Region. Since the 2017 Westminster election (when Douglas Ross resigned to take up a seat at Westminster), these have been John Finnie (Green), Maree Todd (SNP), David Stewart and Rhoda Grant (Labour), Jamie Halcro Johnston, Edward Mountain and Donald Cameron (Conservative). 

Local Authority

Cromarty is within the Highland council area, the successor to the Highland region which superseded the local government county of Ross and Cromarty in 1975. Since the local elections in 2017, its councillors, for the Black Isle ward, have been Craig Fraser (SNP), Gordon Adam (Liberal Democrats) and Jennifer Barclay (Independent).

Community Council

The Cromarty and District Community Council consists of seven members, elected for four-year terms. Three of these members are elected annually to serve as chairman, Secretary and Treasurer. Its coat of arms, granted in 1988, are based on the arms of Urquhart of Cromarty, with a mural coronet placed in the middle of the boars’ heads, signifying a town, and the motto is that of the Urquharts. The official blazon is: Or, three boars&#x27; heads erased Gules, armed and langued Azure, in the centre of the shield a mural coronet of the Second. Above the Shield is placed a mural coronet suitable to a statutory Community Council, videlicet:- a circlet richly chased from which are issuant four thistle leaves (one and two halves visible) and four pine cones (two visible) Or, and in an Escrol below the Shield this Motto &quot;Meane Well, Speak Weil, and Doe Weil&quot;.

== Architecture and landmarks ==

Cromarty is architecturally important for its Georgian merchant houses, such as Forsyth House, built by William Forsyth, that stand within a townscape of Georgian and Victorian fisherman&#x27;s cottages in the local vernacular style. It is an outstanding example of an 18th/19th century burgh, &quot;the jewel in the crown of Scottish Vernacular Architecture&quot;. The cottage with crow-stepped gables in Church Street, in which the geologist Hugh Miller was born (in 1801), is now the only remaining thatched building in Cromarty, with most houses having switched to slate roofs.

To the east of the burgh is Cromarty House, built by George Ross in 1772 on the site of the former Cromarty Castle, which he demolished. Ross also built several other notable buildings in Cromarty: a seven-bay brewery, at the time the biggest in the Highlands, of which two bays remain (now used as a residential arts and training centre); Cromarty Courthouse, now a museum; a hemp factory, converted into housing in the 1970s; the harbour, designed by John Smeaton; and a new chapel just outside the town to hold services in Gaelic for the many Gaelic-speaking workers who moved to Cromarty in the period, later used by Polish soldiers during the Second World War.

While the Gaelic chapel is now ruined, its graveyard is still active as Cromarty&#x27;s cemetery, and the town&#x27;s war memorial and a monument to Hugh Miller are situated next to it. Other buildings of note in Cromarty include the Stevenson Lighthouse, built in 1846, and the East Kirk, an important example of a medieval kirk in the Scottish vernacular, restored in the 2000s by the Scottish Redundant Churches Trust.

== Transport ==
Historically most travel to Cromarty would have been by ship: ferries connected the town with Invergordon, and Cromarty&#x27;s post continued to arrive by boat into the 20th century. The historic ferry route between Cromarty and Nigg was served until 2009 by Britain&#x27;s smallest vehicle ferry, the &quot;Cromarty Rose.&quot; The &quot;Cromarty Rose&quot; was sold in 2009 and replaced for the 2011 season by a new four-car ferry called the &quot;Cromarty Queen&quot;, which continued the service from 2011 to 2014. After a year with no ferry in 2015, new operators, Highland Ferries, were awarded the ferry contract and re-commenced the regular service between Cromarty and Nigg with the &quot;Renfrew Rose&quot; running from June to September, from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. daily, once again offering a direct route North from the Black Isle.

== Education ==
Cromarty has a small primary school named Cromarty Primary School with around 50 students. The University of Aberdeen Department of Zoology Lighthouse Field Station is based in Cromarty.

== Community and culture ==
The small community is also known for being a hub of creative activity, with several arts venues, local artists and a small cinema. The Cromarty Arts Trust, which restored several buildings in the town, including the Brewery and the Stables, organises a programme of arts and music events, including concerts and gigs, an annual Crime and Thrillers weekend, a Harp Weekend and stone letter carving and silver working courses, while the Cromarty Group of artists hold an annual exhibition of their work. Other local community groups include the Cromarty History Society, which holds regular lectures, and the Cromarty and Resolis Film Society, which organises a Film Festival every December. Guests of the 2008 festival included Kirsty Wark, Donald Shaw and Karen Matheson, Janice Forsyth, David Mackenzie and Michael Caton-Jones. Each guest selected five of their favourite films, one of which was shown during the weekend. In addition to the Favourite Films, there is an outdoor screening on a Gable End, Scottish Gaelic Short films, Animation workshop, photographic exhibition and late night Pizza and Film screenings.

In recent years, as elsewhere in Scotland, coastal rowing has become a major activity, and there are three skiffs based in Cromarty, which take part in competitions across Scotland. The Cromarty Community Rowing Club also hosts its own regatta in the summer.

== Traditional dialect ==

The town made the news in October 2012 when Bobby Hogg, the last speaker of the traditional local North Northern Scots dialect, died. This was referred to on HeraldScotland as a dialect of the Scots language, although a report on BBC Radio 4 said that the dialect had been strongly influenced by the English spoken at the local naval base and that it was one of the few areas in Scotland to exhibit H-dropping. Hogg had previously compiled a booklet of traditional words and phrases. In addition, the Highland Council had produced a digital booklet on the dialect. This states that the thou forms were still in common use in the first half of the 20th century and remained in occasional use at the time of publication.

<text>Cromartyshire () was a county in the Highlands of Scotland, comprising the medieval &quot;old shire&quot; around the county town of Cromarty and 22 enclaves and exclaves transferred from Ross-shire in the late 17th century. The largest part, six times the size of the old shire, was Coigach, containing Ullapool and the area north-west of it. In 1889, Cromartyshire was merged with Ross-shire to become a new county called Ross and Cromarty, which in 1975 was merged into the new council area of Highland.

==History==
Cromartyshire was anciently part of the province of Ross. Ross had been under Norwegian overlordship in the 10th and 11th centuries, but was claimed by the Scottish crown in 1098. It took many years for Scottish authority to become fully effective in the area. Unlike other areas absorbed into Scotland around that time, such as Moray, Ross was not initially divided into shires. Instead, the area was placed under the nominal authority of the Sheriff of Inverness. By the mid-thirteenth century there were two small shires within Ross, based at Dingwall and Cromarty, to enforce Scottish laws in the immediate vicinity of those two burghs, but the rest of Ross remained under the sheriff of Inverness. The position of Sheriff of Dingwall did not endure, but the Sheriff of Cromarty did, and became a hereditary post held by Clan Urquhart.

The medieval shire or sheriffdom of Cromarty encompassed a single tract on the north of the Black Isle peninsula. It comprised the parish of Cromarty; most of the adjacent parish of Kirkmichael (excluding a portion at Balblair where a ferry crossed the Cromarty Firth to Invergordon); and a single farm in Cullicudden parish. As late as the mid-nineteenth century, the boundary between Ross-shire and Cromartyshire was uncertain on the moor of Millbuie (in the centre of the Black Isle).

Cromartyshire originally bordered Inverness-shire, but in 1504 an act of parliament purported to create the county of Ross-shire covering the rest of the old province of Ross. In practice, that act was not fully brought into effect. It was not until a subsequent act in 1661 and the appointment of the first permanent sheriff of Ross in 1662 that Ross-shire properly functioned as a shire. In 1662, Kirkmichael and Cullicudden parishes merged to form the parish of Resolis.

The feudal barony of Cromarty, whose appurtenant land was coterminous with the county, was purchased from the Urquharts in 1682 by the Mackenzies of Tarbat. They owned scattered lands in Ross-shire, including the barony of Tarbat on the Moray Firth north of the Black Isle. In 1685 Sir George Mackenzie, recently made Viscount of Tarbat and later elevated to Earl of Cromartie, secured two Acts of the Parliament of Scotland transferring his lands in Easter Ross from Ross-shire to Cromartyshire. These were enumerated as:
:the barony of Tarbat and all therein incorporated, ... also Little Farness and others his lands within the barony of Delny, together with the lands of Wester St Martins, Easter Balblair and the ferry belonging to George Dallas of St Martins 
And:
:his lands of Pittonachie, Beneckfield, Avoch, Castleton, Auchterflow, Hauldoks, Killen, Raddery, Balmeechy, Little Suddey and his lands about Chanonry and Rosemarkie
Although this was repealed in 1686 on the grounds that some lands not belonging to Viscount Tarbat had been included, it was re-enacted in 1690 to include only &quot;the said barony of Tarbat and all other lands in Ross-shire belonging in property to the said viscount&quot;. The transfers increased the area and rateable value of Cromartyshire by respective factors of fifteen and three.
Cromartyshire was the smallest constituency in the Parliament of Scotland, with only five freeholders electing its two Commissioners in 1703. After the Act of Union 1707, Cromartyshire sent one MP to Westminster alternately with Nairnshire, a nearby small county. Only six of 19 votes on the register at the last election, in 1831, were found to be genuine freeholders.

Following the Jacobite rising of 1745, the government passed the Heritable Jurisdictions (Scotland) Act 1746, returning the appointment of sheriffs to the crown in those cases where they had become hereditary positions, as had been the case for the Sheriff of Cromarty. The scope for a major landowner or clan chief to control the office of sheriff, which had been the major cause of Cromartyshire&#x27;s exclaves being separated from Ross, was therefore greatly reduced. From 1748 the government merged the positions of Sheriff of Ross and Sheriff of Cromarty into a single position under the Sheriffs (Scotland) Act 1747.

The 1801 census report listed &quot;Shire of Cromarty&quot; and &quot;Shire of Ross&quot; separately, the former including only the old shire and the latter the exclaves. The 1811 census report listed &quot;Ross and Cromarty&quot; together on the ground that it was impractical to separate them. In 1805, responsibility for maintenance of roads in Ross-shire and Cromartyshire was merged. In 1810, the militia was for Ross-shire in some exclaves and Cromartyshire in others. 
The Scottish Reform Act 1832 merged Cromartyshire&#x27;s constituency with Ross-shire&#x27;s to form Ross and Cromarty, returning one MP to Parliament. Police and ratings administration were merged similarly in the Victorian period.
Despite sharing a sheriff from 1748, Ross-shire and Cromartyshire remained legally separate counties. They retained separate Commissioners of Supply, and from 1794 each appointed their own lord-lieutenants, with Cromartyshire overseen by the Lord Lieutenant of Cromarty. From 1860 the commissioners of supply for the two counties were directed to work together on delivering some functions, notably relating to prisons.

The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889 provided that &quot;the counties of Ross and Cromarty shall cease to be separate counties, and shall be united for all purposes whatsoever, under the name of the county of Ross and Cromarty.&quot; The new county of Ross and Cromarty came into being from the passing of the act in August 1889. The act also established elected county councils, which came into being in May 1890. The 1889 Act also triggered a review of boundaries to eliminate remaining exclaves and cases where parishes straddled county boundaries, which saw Ross and Cromarty absorb an exclave of Nairnshire and a near-exclave of Inverness-shire; the former was the barony of Ferintosh and the latter an exclave of Kilmorack parish around Muir of Ord railway station.

==Geography==

Given the scattered nature of the county it is difficult to generalise. The original shire consisted of a portion of the Black Isle peninsula bordering on Cromarty Firth, across which lay the Tarbat peninsula, of which several portions belonged to Cromartyshire, including Tarbat Ness. The interior sections consisted of several enclaves within Ross-shire which were mountainous, remote and sparsely populated.

To the west were various sections around Little Loch Broom, including the southern tip of Gruinard Island. North of Loch Broom lay the largest single section of the county, which contained Ullapool, the Coigach peninsula and a number of small islands in Enard Bay and also the Summer Isles where Loch Broom meets The Minch. This section also contained a number of lochs, including Loch Osgaig, Loch Veyatie, Loch Lurgainn, Loch Bad a&#x27; Ghaill, Loch Sionascaig and Loch Achall.

Sources tend to number the tracts added to Cromartyshire at between eight and eleven; however some comprise multiple parcels. In 1807, Alexander Nimmo listed the additions in eight groups with two to six parcels in each.

===Ordnance Survey list===

The 1881 index to the Ordnance Survey&#x27;s first edition lists 22 detached parts, and the original &quot;old shire&quot;, all of whose areas are given on the six-inch map. The total measured area of Cromartyshire was 217321.186 acres, or .


===Other sources===
Some places not included within Cromartyshire in the Ordnance Survey map are stated by earlier sources to have been within it. The 1859 edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; asserts that Royston Park (now Caroline Park) outside Edinburgh, the city residence of the Viscount Tarbat, was also considered part of Cromartyshire. Nimmo&#x27;s 1807 list includes:
* &quot;the mortified lands of the town of Fortrose&quot;, two patches totalling less than 50 acres in Rosemarkie parish, which were bequeathed to the burgh of Cromarty. A 1794 account of Rosemarkie parish states that there are two mortifications, but for the poor of &quot;Chanonry&quot;, not Cromarty.
* Ussie Mills (between Dingwall and Conon Bridge).
* salmon-fishing rights on the River Conon.

<text>The Cromarty Firth (; ; literally &quot;kyles [straits] of Cromarty&quot;) is an arm of the Moray Firth in Scotland.
==Geography==

The entrance to the Cromarty Firth is guarded by two precipitous headlands; the one on the north high and the one on the south high — called &quot;The Sutors&quot; from a fancied resemblance to a couple of shoemakers (in Scots, &quot;souters&quot;) bent over their lasts. From the Sutors the Firth extends inland in a westerly and then south-westerly direction for a distance of . Excepting between Nigg Bay and Cromarty Bay where it is about wide, and Alness Bay where it is wide, it has an average width of . The southern shore of the Firth is formed by a peninsula known as the Black Isle. Good views of the Cromarty Firth are to be had from the Sutors or Cnoc Fyrish.

At its head the Firth receives its principal river, the River Conon, other rivers include the Allt Graad, Peffery, Sgitheach, Averon and Balnagown. The Dingwall Canal remains connected to the Firth, although it is now disused. The principal settlements on its shores are Dingwall near the head, Cromarty near the mouth (from which the Firth takes its name), and Invergordon on the north shore. The villages of Evanton, Alness and Culbokie are nearby. There is one bridge, the A9 road crossing between Ardullie and Findon. In the past there were several ferries across the firth (for example at Foulis) but now there is only one, a four-car ferry that runs between Cromarty and Nigg during the summer.

==Nature==
The firth is designated as a Special Protection Area for wildlife conservation purposes. Many bottlenose dolphins, harbour porpoises, grey seals and harbour seals live here, while minke whales seasonally migrate. Larger animals such as humpback whales, northern bottlenose whales, long-finned pilot whales, common dolphins, large fish such as the sunfish and basking sharks are seasonal or occasional visitors to the firth.

==History==
The Firth forms one of the safest and most commodious anchorages in the north of Scotland and Invergordon was at one time a major base for the Royal Navy&#x27;s Home Fleet. The Firth was the scene of the Invergordon Mutiny in 1931. Remnants of the Navy remain, such as the disused airfield near Evanton (now an industrial estate) which was built to take aircraft from the fleet carriers while they were at anchor. During World War II, there was a large training and operational base for Catalina amphibious aircraft and Sunderland seaplanes, which extended from Invergordon to Alness point - also now an industrial estate. A memorial to the men who were killed on operational missions was placed at this industrial estate in 2001. A propeller from a Catalina was found and restored by RAF apprentices and now resides in the town of Alness. The tennis courts on the industrial estate are the only remaining parts of the estate which date from World War II.

==Commerce and industry==

At Nigg there is an important North Sea oil and renewable energy centre owned by Global Energy Group since 2011. The yard with a dry dock for repairing and fabricating oil platforms, was opened in 1972 as a joint venture between Brown &amp; Root and construction company George Wimpey. The yard is presently known as Nigg Energy Park.

Elsewhere along the firth are facilities for cruise ships, oil processing, and bulk cargo handling.

Cromarty Firth Port Authority is the body responsible for regulating and managing the commercial and industrial resources of the firth.

<text>Eucalyptus regnans, known variously as mountain ash (in Victoria), giant ash or swamp gum (in Tasmania), or stringy gum, is a species of very tall forest tree that is native to the Australia states of Tasmania and Victoria. It is a straight-trunked tree with smooth grey bark, but with a stocking of rough brown bark at the base, glossy green, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between nine and fifteen, white flowers, and cup-shaped or conical fruit. It is the tallest of all flowering plants; the tallest measured living specimen, named Centurion, stands 100 metres (328 feet) tall in Tasmania.

It often grows in pure stands in tall wet forest, sometimes with rainforest understorey, and in temperate, high rainfall areas with deep loam soils. A large number of the trees have been logged, including some of the tallest known. This species of eucalypt does not possess a lignotuber and is often killed by bushfire, regenerating from seed. Mature forests dominated by &quot;E. regnans&quot; have been found to store more carbon than any other forest known. The species is grown in plantations in Australia and in other countries. Along with &quot;E. obliqua&quot; and &quot;E. delegatensis&quot; it is known in the timber industry as Tasmanian oak.

== Description ==
&quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot; is a broad-leaved, evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of but does not form a lignotuber. The crown is open and small in relation to the size of the rest of the tree. The trunk is straight with smooth, cream-coloured, greyish or brown bark with a stocking of more or less fibrous or flaky bark that extends up to at the base. The trunk typically reaches a diameter of at breast height (DBH). Young plants and coppice regrowth have glossy green, egg-shaped leaves that are held horizontally, long and wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped to broadly lance-shaped or sickle-shaped, long and wide, tapering to a reddish petiole long. The upper and lower surfaces of the leaves are dotted with numerous tiny, circular or irregularly-shaped oil glands. Secondary leaf veins arise at an acute angle from the midvein and tertiary venation is sparse. 
The flower buds are arranged in leaf s in groups of between nine and fifteen on one or two unbranched peduncles long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a rounded operculum. Flowering occurs from March to May and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped or conical capsule long and wide on a pedicel long and usually with three valves near the level of the rim. The seeds are pyramid-shaped, long with the hilum at the end.

Seedlings have kidney shaped cotyledons, and the first two to three pairs of leaves are arranged in opposite pairs along the stem, then alternate.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot; was first formally described in 1871 by Victorian botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in the &quot;Annual Report of the Victorian Acclimatisation Society&quot;. He gave the specific epithet (&quot;regnans&quot;) from the Latin word meaning &quot;ruling&quot;. Mueller noted that &quot;[t]his species or variety, which might be called &quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot;, represents the loftiest tree in British Territory.&quot; However, until 1882 he considered the tree to be a form or variety of the Tasmanian black peppermint (&quot;Eucalyptus amygdalina&quot;) and called it thus, not using the binomial name &quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot; until the &quot;Systematic Census of Australian Plants&quot; in 1882, and giving it a formal diagnosis in 1888 in Volume 1 of the &quot;Key to the System of Victorian Plants&quot;, where he describes it as &quot;stupendously tall&quot;. Von Mueller did not designate a type specimen, nor did he use the name &quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot; on his many collections of &quot;White Mountain Ash&quot; at the Melbourne Herbarium. Victorian botanist Jim Willis selected a lectotype in 1967, one of the more complete collections of a specimen from the Dandenong Ranges, that von Mueller had noted was one &quot;of the tall trees measured by Mr D. Boyle in March 1867.&quot;

&quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot; is widely known as the mountain ash, due to the resemblance of its wood to that of the northern hemisphere ash (&quot;Fraxinus&quot;). Swamp gum is a name given to it in Tasmania, as well as stringy gum in northern Tasmania. Other common names include white mountain ash, giant ash, stringy gum, swamp gum and Tasmanian oak. Von Mueller called it the &quot;Giant gum-tree&quot; and &quot;Spurious blackbutt&quot; in his 1888 &quot;Key to the System of Victorian Plants&quot;. The timber has been known as &quot;Tasmanian oak&quot;, because early settlers likened the strength of its wood that of English oak (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;).

The brown barrel (&quot;Eucalyptus fastigata&quot;) is a close relative of mountain ash, with the two sharing the rare trait in eucalypts of paired inflorescences arising from axillary buds. Botanist Ian Brooker classified the two in the series &quot;Regnantes&quot;. The latter species differs in having brown fibrous bark all the way up its trunk, and was long classified as a subspecies of &quot;E. regnans&quot;. The series lies in the section &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; of the subgenus &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; within the genus &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;.

=== Population genetics ===
Genetic testing across its range of chloroplast DNA yielded 41 haplotypes, divided broadly into Victorian and Tasmanian groups, but also showing distinct profiles for some areas such as East Gippsland, and north-eastern and south-eastern Tasmania, suggesting the species had persisted in these areas during the Last Glacial Maximum and recolonised others. There was some sharing of haplotypes between populations of the Otway Ranges and north-western Tasmania, suggesting this was the most likely area for gene flow between the mainland and Tasmania in the past. Further analysis of the same chloroplast genetic markers by researchers at The Australian National University suggests that there is more natural haplotype diversity in the Central Highlands of Victoria than previously observed. More recently, next-generation sequencing of nuclear DNA identified very little population genetic structure throughout the range of the species, with a considerable proportion of the entire species genetic variation found within any given population of mountain ash. This suggests that gene flow is likely to be occurring over long distances, and that the lengthy generation times of the species has precluded the development of substantial genetic differentiation between Tasmania and the mainland. Further comparison of chloroplast and nuclear DNA markers confirmed the expectation of extensive pollen dispersal but limited seed dispersal, leading to patterns of strong differentiation in chloroplast markers and weak differentiation at nuclear markers.

Genome-wide sequencing of numerous mountain ash populations suggests that hybridisation with messmate (&quot;Eucalyptus obliqua&quot;) occurs frequently, with all populations currently studied having at least one hybrid individual present. In many cases these hybrids show no obvious morphological signs of hybridisation, although some individuals do show intermediate phenotypes in characteristics such as the oil gland density in leaves and the structure and height of rough bark on the trunk. Morphology is generally now considered to be a poor method of identifying hybrid individuals as it does not always accurately reflect the genetic makeup of an individual. A good example of this is a population of purported mountain ash on Wilson&#x27;s Promontory in Victoria, which are morphologically more similar to mountain ash but genetically much more closely related to messmate. Other populations with high levels of hybridisation include those on Bruny Island and the Tasman Peninsula in Tasmania. It is not surprising that the populations with the highest level of hybridisation occur on islands, promontories and peninsulas, as these areas are likely to occur on the edge of the ecological niche of mountain ash, and the small patches of mountain ash still remaining at these sites are probably experiencing pollen swamping from the more dominant messmate trees. Hybrids between mountain ash and red stringybark (&quot;Eucalyptus macrorhyncha&quot;) have been observed in the Cathedral Range in Victoria. These trees resemble mountain ash in appearance though they lack the paired inflorescences, and have the oil composition of red stringybark.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot; occurs across a 700 km by 500 km region in the southern Australian states of Victoria and Tasmania. The species grows mostly in cool, mountainous areas that receive rainfall over per year. &quot;E. regnans&quot; reaches its highest elevations of about ASL on the Errinundra Plateau in north-eastern Victoria, and its lowest elevations near sea-level in some southern parts of its Tasmanian distribution.

In Victoria, stands of tall trees are found in the Otway, Dandenong, Yarra and Strzelecki ranges as well as Mount Disappointment and East Gippsland. However, the distribution is much reduced. Most of the &quot;E. regnans&quot; forest across Gippsland was cleared for farmland between 1860 and 1880, and in the Otway Ranges between 1880 and 1900, while severe bushfires hit in 1851, 1898 and 1939. In Tasmania, &quot;E. regnans&quot; is found in the Huon and Derwent River valleys in the southeast of the state.

In the Otways, the species is found in wet forest in pure stands or growing in association with mountain grey gum (&quot;Eucalyptus cypellocarpa&quot;), messmate (&quot;E. obliqua&quot;) and Victorian blue gum (&quot;E. globulus&quot; subsp. &quot;bicostata&quot;). Other trees it grows with include manna gum (&quot;Eucalyptus viminalis&quot;), shining gum (&quot;E. nitens&quot;), myrtle beech (&quot;Nothofagus cunninghamii&quot;) and silver wattle (&quot;Acacia dealbata&quot;) The mountain ash-dominated forest can be interspersed with rainforest understory, with such species as southern sassafras (&quot;Atherosperma moschatum&quot;), celery-top pine (&quot;Phyllocladus aspleniifolius&quot;), leatherwood (&quot;Eucryphia lucida&quot;) and horizontal (&quot;Anodopetalum biglandulosum&quot;). The mountain ash is most suited to deep friable clay loam soils, often of volcanic origin; in areas of poorer soils, it can be confined to watercourses and valleys.

==Ecology==

=== Tree growth and stand development ===
&quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot; is a very fast growing tree, with mean height growth rates in young (&lt; 22 years old) stands ranging from to per year. In fact, some individuals grow at more than per year for the first 20 years of their lives. However, growth rates slow with age, and eventually turn negative as old trees senesce and the tops of the canopy are damaged in high winds, lightning strikes or during fires. Mean tree height after 8 years is about 15 m, and after 22 years is about 33 m. After 50 years, trees are typically about tall. In young stands (&lt; 22 years old), mean stem diameter growth is approximately 0.8 to 2 cm per year, with half of the total stem diameter growth occurring in the first 90 years of life.

A number of environmental factors influence the growth and maturation of &quot;E. regnans&quot;, with research showing that the amount of incident solar radiation is positively associated with height and stem diameter growth, and that the amount of sunlight received is strongly negatively correlated with the level of precipitation (although all areas studied still received more than of rainfall).

In the absence of disturbance events such as high-intensity fire, individual trees can survive for hundreds of years, with the oldest known individuals identified as being 500 years old. Historically, low-frequency and high-intensity wildfires (ignited by lightning strikes) would prevent many stands from reaching this age, with fires killing mature overstorey trees and a new cohort developing from canopy-stored seedbanks. Despite this, natural variation in the spatial scale and frequency of wildfires meant that 30-60% of pre-European &quot;E. regnans&quot; forests would have been considered old growth (e.g. with living trees more than 120 years old). In addition, studies of older &quot;E. regnans&quot; forests have shown that low-intensity fires lead to the development of younger cohorts of trees without killing the parent trees, which leads to the presence of multiple age classes in old-growth forests.

As &quot;E. regnans&quot; forests mature, they start to develop characteristics that are representative of old-growth stands, such as large hollows, long strips of decorticating bark, an abundance of tree ferns and rainforest trees, buttressing at the base of &quot;E. regnans&quot; trunks, large clumps of mistletoe in the canopy, large fallen logs, and thick mats of moisture-retaining mosses.

===Seed production, fire and regeneration===
&quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot; lacks a lignotuber and hence cannot recover by reshooting after intense fire. Instead, it can only regenerate by seed, and is thus termed an obligate seeder. The seeds are held firmly in woody capsules (gumnuts) until the branchlets die and the capsules dry out. Seedlings require a high level of light, much more than reaches the forest floor when there is a well-developed understorey, and so seeds are not likely to germinate or develop into saplings unless the understorey is opened up to allow light to reach the ground. As high-intensity fires tend to kill all parent trees, after fire there is a massive release of seed from drying capsules, which take advantage of the available light and the nutrients in the ash bed. Seedling densities of up to have been recorded after a major fire. Through time there is a strong stand thinning effect and natural stem density reduction eventually leads to mature tree densities of about .

There is substantial variation in the age at which individual trees develop viable seeds, which is largely the result of growth rates, tree size, incident solar radiation, and topographic aspect. Trees as young as 7 years old may contain mature fruit capsules, although this is unusual and most trees probably start producing seeds after 11 years of age. Similarly, there is considerable variation in the rate at which stands of &quot;E. regnans&quot; develop seed crops. Tree growth rates, stand age, and topography influence the rate of development of seed crops in stands, leading to strong variation in the timing of seed crop viability, however, the mean age of reproductive viability appears to be about 21 years.

As &quot;E. regnans&quot; seeds are not stored in soil seedbanks, the regeneration of the forest depends on the presence of canopy-stored seed crops. With two or more frequent fires occurring in less than the time to stand reproductive viability, &quot;E. regnans&quot; can become locally extinct due to poor regeneration. As &quot;E. regnans&quot; is often the sole or dominant overstorey tree in many locations, this can lead to the replacement of a tall wet open forest ecosystem with a dense low wattle shrubland, which obviously has large repercussions for community composition and function. Conversely, in the complete absence of fire (for hundreds of years), the cool temperate rainforest species that live in association with &quot;E. regnans&quot; may gradually replace it in gullies or other areas where the trees succumb to age rather than fire. Thus it is clear that &quot;E. regnans&quot; forests rely on a particular frequency and intensity of fires for maintenance of the ecosystem attributes. As contemporary fire regimes have been highly modified since European occupation of Australia, there is a clear risk to &quot;E. regnans&quot; forests in many regions.

=== Ecological community ===
The majority of the endangered Leadbeater’s possum population lives in mountain ash forests (&quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot;, &quot;E. delegatensis&quot; and &quot;E. nitens&quot;) in the Central Highlands of Victoria. The possums use hollows in old trees for nesting and shelter and forage for arboreal arthropods under bark. The vegetation structure of these forests enables the possums to travel through them. Both Leadbeaters possums and yellow-bellied gliders feed on the sap from the trunks and branches. Koalas feed on the foliage, though it is not one of their preferred forage species.

Yellow-tailed black-cockatoos nest in the hollows of old trees, in contrast to the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle (&quot;Aquila audax fleayi&quot;) that builds its nest of large sticks at the top of the trees.

In a small area of rainforest in Yarra Ranges National Park in Victoria, nine epiphyte species were observed growing on &quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot;, the most prevalent of these being the liverwort &quot;Bazzania adnexa&quot;.

The spur-legged phasmid (&quot;Didymuria violescens&quot;) is a leaf-eating insect that can defoliate trees during major infestations such as one experienced at Powelltown in the early 1960s. Leaves and buds are eaten by the larvae and adults of the chrysomelid leaf beetle &quot;Chrysophtharta bimaculata&quot;. Stressed trees can be damaged by the eucalyptus longhorned borer (&quot;Phoracantha semipunctata&quot;), which burrows into the trunk, which exudes a red stain. Eucalypt weevils of the genus &quot;Gonipterus&quot; commonly damage &quot;E. regnans&quot;, while the tortoise beetle (&quot;Paropsis atomaria&quot;) is a common pest of plantations.

===Carbon storage===
A study carried out by environmental scientist Professor Brendan Mackey of the Australian National University in 2009 identified that mountain ash forests in Victoria’s Central Highlands are the best in the world at locking up carbon. Mackey and colleagues found the highest amount of carbon was contained in a forest located in the O&#x27;Shannassy River catchment, which held of carbon. This area was a stand of unlogged mountain ash over 100 years old, which had had minimal human disturbance. They further calculated that a &quot;E. regnans&quot;-dominated forest with trees up to 250 years old and a well-established mid-storey and upper storey could store up to of carbon.

===Tallest specimens===

&quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot; is the tallest of all flowering plants, and possibly the tallest of all plants, although no living specimens can make that claim. The tallest measured living specimen, named Centurion, stands tall in Tasmania. Before the discovery of Centurion, the tallest known specimen was Icarus Dream, which was rediscovered in Tasmania in January, 2005 and is high. It was first measured by surveyors at in 1962 but the documentation had been lost.
A total of 16 living trees in Tasmania have been reliably measured in excess of . The Cumberland Scenic Reserve near Cambarville, became the site of Victoria&#x27;s tallest trees, in 1939, including one measured at high, following the extensive Black Friday bushfires. A severe storm in 1959 blew down 13 of the trees and the tallest tree was reduced to a height of after it lost part of its crown. The height of this tree was cited as in 2002 following further storm damage in 1973. In 2000, a tree at Wallaby Catchment in Kinglake National Park was discovered to be tall in 2000, however it perished in the Black Saturday bushfires of 2009.

Historically, the tallest individual is claimed to be the Ferguson Tree, at , found in the Watts River region of Victoria in 1871 or 1872. This record is often disputed as unreliable, despite first-hand documentary evidence of it being measured on the ground with surveyor&#x27;s tape by a senior forestry official (see below). Widespread agreement exists, however, that an exceptionally tall individual was reliably measured at by theodolite in 1880 by a surveyor, George Cornthwaite, at Thorpdale, Victoria (the tree is known both as the Cornthwaite or Thorpdale Tree). When it was felled in 1881, Cornthwaite remeasured it on the ground by chain at . The stump is commemorated with a plaque. That tree was about shorter than &quot;Hyperion&quot;, the world&#x27;s current tallest living tree, a coast redwood measuring .

Some individuals attain much greater diameter; the largest known being &quot;The Bulga Stump&quot;, a charred remnant near Tarra Bulga, South Gippsland district, Victoria, Australia which as a living tree had a DBH of , making &quot;E. regnans&quot; the third thickest species of tree after the Baobab (&quot;Adansonia digitata&quot;) and the Montezuma Cypress (&quot;Taxodium mucronatum&quot;). As a consequence of being both the tallest and thickest Australian trees, &quot;E. regnans&quot; is also the most massive; that title being currently held by an individual called the &quot;Kermandie Queen&quot; discovered west of Geeveston, Tasmania which measures in height and has a diameter at breast height (DBH) of .

Al Carder notes that in 1888 a cash reward of 100 pounds was offered there for the discovery of any tree measuring more than . The fact that such a considerable reward was never claimed is taken as evidence that such large trees did not exist. Carder&#x27;s historical research, however, revealed that the reward was offered under conditions that made it highly unlikely to be collected. First, it was made in the depths of winter and applied only for a very short time. Next, the tree had to be measured by an accredited surveyor. Since loggers had already taken the largest trees from the most accessible Victorian forests, finding very tall trees then would have demanded an arduous trek into remote wilderness and at considerable altitude. In turn, that meant that searchers also needed the services of experienced bushmen to be able to guide them and conduct an effective search. Only one expedition actually penetrated one of the strongholds of &quot;E. regnans&quot; at Mount Baw Baw but its search was rendered ineffectual by cold and snow and managed to measure only a single living treethe New Turkey Tree: before appalling conditions forced a retreat, Carder notes.

Ferdinand von Mueller claimed to have personally measured one tree near the headwaters of the Yarra River at . Nurseryman David Boyle, claimed in 1862 to have measured a fallen tree in a deep gully in the Dandenongs at , and with a diameter at its broken tip that indicated it might have lost another of trunk when it broke, for .

Von Mueller&#x27;s early records also mention two trees on the nearby Black Spur Range, one alive and measuring and another fallen tree said to measure , but these were either based on hearsay or uncertain reliability. David Boyle also reported that a tree at Cape Otway measured , but this too was based on hearsay.

None, however, had been verified by direct documentation until 1982 when Ken Simpendorfer, a Special Projects Officer for the Forests Commission Victoria, directed a search of official Victorian archives. It unearthed a forgotten report from more than a century earlier, one that had not been referred to in other accounts of the species up to that time. It was written on 21 February 1872, by the Inspector of State Forests, William Ferguson, and was addressed to the Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Surveys, Clement Hodgkinson. Ferguson had been instructed to explore and inspect the watershed of the Watts River and reported trees in great number and exceptional size in areas where loggers had not yet reached. Ferguson wrote a letter to the editor in the Melbourne Age newspaper.&quot;&quot;Some places, where the trees are fewer and at a lower altitude, the timber is much larger in diameter, averaging from 6 to 10 feet and frequently trees to 15 feet in diameter are met with on alluvial flats near the river. These trees average about ten per acre: their size, sometimes, is enormous. Many of the trees that have fallen by decay and by bush fires measure 350 feet in length, with girth in proportion. In one instance I measured with the tape line one huge specimen that lay prostrate across a tributary of the Watts and found it to be 435 feet from the roots to the top of its trunk. At 5 feet from the ground it measures 18 feet in diameter. At the extreme end where it has broken in its fall, it (the trunk) is 3 feet in diameter. This tree has been much burnt by fire, and I fully believe that before it fell it must have been more than 500 feet high. As it now lies it forms a complete bridge across a narrow ravine&quot; ... William Ferguson, The Melbourne Age, 22 February 1872.&quot;It is also possible that individual trees will again attain such heights. Author Bob Beale has recorded that the tallest trees in the Black Spur Range now measure about butdue to major bushfires in the 1920s and 30sare less than 80 years old and have been growing consistently at the rate of about a year.

===In New Zealand===
A &quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot; stand in the Orokonui Ecosanctuary near Dunedin, New Zealand, where &quot;E. regnans&quot; is an introduced species, contains that country&#x27;s tallest measured tree, standing high in 2012.
A &quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot; in the urban area of Greytown was measured at in 2011.

==Uses==
&quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot; is valued for its timber, and has been harvested in very large quantities. Aside from being logged in its natural range, it is grown in plantations in New Zealand and Chile, and to a limited extent, in South Africa and Zimbabwe. Primary uses are sawlogging and woodchipping. It was a major source of newsprint in the 20th century. Much of the present woodchip harvest is exported to Japan. While the area of natural stands with large old trees is rapidly decreasing, substantial areas of regrowth exist and it is increasingly grown in plantations, the long, straight, fast growing trunks being much more commercially valuable than the old growth timber.

It is a medium weight timber (about ) and rather coarse (stringy) in texture. Gum veins are common. The wood is easy to work and the grain is straight with long, clear sections without knots. The wood works reasonably well for steam-bending.
Primary uses for sawn wood are furniture, flooring (where its very pale blonde colour is highly prized), panelling, veneer, plywood, window frames, and general construction. The wood has sometimes been used for wood wool and cooperage. However, the wood needs steam reconditioning for high value applications, due to a tendency to collapse on drying. This wood is highly regarded by builders, furniture makers and architects.

Genetic comparison of logged stands and natural stands of mountain ash showed only minor differences in nuclear DNA between the two, with slightly stronger spatial genetic structure in the undisturbed treatment, higher levels of genetic differentiation in the logged treatment, and greater partitioning of genetic diversity among logged sites. However, analysis of chloroplast DNA showed more substantial differences, with higher levels of diversity in logged sites than burnt or undisturbed sites suggesting that chloroplast DNA was entering the system via the use of non-local seed in the regeneration process.

==Conservation==
&quot;E. regnans&quot; forests are particularly susceptible to destruction by bushfire, and, to a lesser extent, timber harvesting.

Opposition to logging of wet forests by clearfelling has grown very strong in recent years (particularly opposition to woodchipping). It is a controversial debate with strong opinions both for and against timber harvesting.

Several applications have been made to Victoria&#x27;s Flora and Fauna Guarantee (FFG) Scientific Advisory Committee to list mountain ash forests as an endangered vegetation community. The committee rejected an application in 2017 as being ineligible and that it did not satisfy at least one criterion set out in the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 and its Regulations of 2011. The assessment criteria included, was there a demonstrated state of decline, has there been a reduction in distribution or has vegetation community altered markedly.
Studies conducted by Murray Cunningham and David Ashton found that the re-growth habit of &quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot; requires high light conditions, and the high nutrients contained in the ash layer. These conditions are found typically following a high intensity wildfire, which are an infrequent, yet periodic feature of mountain ash forests. For this reason clearfellingwith the complete removal of all trees, followed by a high intensity fire and seedingis used by the timber industry and forest scientists to ensure regeneration of harvested areas because it mimics the conditions found after high intensity wildfire.

Melbourne&#x27;s forested water catchment areas, which provides water requiring little treatment, are composed of large areas &quot;E. regnans&quot; forest. The management of 157,000 hectares of Melbourne’s forested water catchments were vested in the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (MMBW) in 1891 with a closed catchment policy where timber harvesting and public access was not permitted. These areas are now included in the Yarra Ranges National Park. There has been a long running political campaign to add more areas to create the Great Forest National Park.

Water yields from catchments fall significantly for 20 to 40 years if trees are killed by bushfire or timber harvesting. The MMBW began research into forest cover on water supplies as early as 1948. In the early 1960s they set up a new series of paired catchment experiments in wet mountain forests near Healesville to measure the long term impacts of timber harvesting and bushfire on water quality and quantity. It took another 10 years for the results to emerge more clearly. It was found that while timber harvesting had an impact, the most dramatic threat to stream flows remained catastrophic bushfires like those on Black Friday in 1939 or Black Saturday in 2009.

In 2018, some researchers concluded that Mountain Ash forests in Victoria represent collapsing ecosystems. They coined the term &#x27;hidden collapse&#x27; meaning an ecosystem that gives a superficial appearance of being intact but has lost key elements. At their research sites they found that between 1997 and 2011, up to 50% of large old-cavity trees (trees with big holes that serve as nest sites for animals and birds) had been lost and there had also been a significant decline in the numbers of birds and tree dwelling marsupials such as possums and gliders. They identified fast and slow drivers of change: fire, logging, and climate change, and indicated that Mountain Ash forests would be replaced with Acacia-dominated woodlands.


==Use in horticulture==
&quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot; is too large for the majority of gardens, but may be suitable for parks. Propagation is from seed, with the best germination rates being obtained by refrigerating for three weeks before sowing. Seed may be stored for several years if refrigerated and kept dry. Seedlings are grown in containers but are more prone to damping off than other eucalypts; they are highly susceptible to &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot; and &quot;P. nicotianae&quot;. Young plants are generally planted out once they are 8 or 9 months old. These are at risk of being eaten by grazing rabbits, wallabies and possums, which can destroy young plantations in severe cases.

American horticulturist and entrepreneur Ellwood Cooper noted its rapid growth but demanding soil requirements in his 1876 work &quot;Forest Culture and Eucalyptus Trees&quot;. &quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot; requires fertile soil with good drainage and annual rainfall of spread over the year, and has poor tolerance to temperatures below or drought.

Outside Australia, plantations have been successfully established in New Zealand, South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania.

<text>Hangzhou is the capital city of the Chinese province of Zhejiang. It is located in northwestern Zhejiang, sitting at the head of Hangzhou Bay.

As of the 2020 Chinese census, it had a total population of 11,936,010 inhabitants. Hangzhou ranks ninth in terms of GDP in mainland China. Hangzhou hosts the headquarters of Alibaba Group, Ant Group, Geely and NetEase.

Universities located in Hangzhou include Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou Normal, Hangzhou Dianzi, Zhejiang A&amp;F, Zhejiang Sci-Tech, Zhejiang Chinese Medical, Westlake, China Jiliang and Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics. Its West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage Site west of the city, is among its best-known attractions. In 2023, it became the third Chinese city to host the Asian Games. It was also the second Chinese city to host the Asian Para Games after the Guangzhou 2010. Hangzhou also hosted the 11th G20 summit in 2016. Hangzhou ranks 13th globally by scientific outputs. 

==History==
===Early history===
The celebrated neolithic culture of Hemudu is known to have inhabited Yuyao, south-east of Hangzhou, as far back as seven thousand years ago. It was during this time that rice was first cultivated in southeast China. Excavations have established that the jade-carving Liangzhu culture (named for its type site just northwest of Hangzhou) inhabited the area immediately around the present city around five thousand years ago. The first of Hangzhou&#x27;s present neighborhoods to appear in written records was Yuhang, which probably preserves an old Baiyue name.

In 222 BC, Emperor Qin Shi Huang established Qiantang County, located in the area of Wulin Mountains and Wulin Lakes, Hangzhou&#x27;s aliases Qiantang () and Wulin () began to appear during the Qin and Han dynasties.

Hangzhou was made the seat of the prefecture of Hang in , entitling it to a city wall which was constructed two years later. By a longstanding convention also seen in other cities like Guangzhou and Fuzhou, the city took on the name of the area it administered and became known as Hangzhou. Hangzhou was at the southern end of China&#x27;s Grand Canal which extends to Beijing. The canal evolved over centuries but reached its full length by 609.

=== Tang dynasty ===
In the Tang dynasty, Bai Juyi, a renowned poet, was appointed governor of Hangzhou. He noticed that the farmland nearby depended on the water of West Lake, but due to negligence the old dyke had collapsed, and the lake so dried out that the local farmers were suffering from severe drought. He ordered the construction of a stronger and taller dyke, with a dam to control the flow of water, mitigating the drought problem. The livelihood of local people of Hangzhou improved over the following years. Bai Juyi used his leisure time to enjoy the West Lake, visiting it almost daily. He then had willows and other trees planted along the dyke, making it a landmark.

It is listed as one of the Seven Ancient Capitals of China. It was first the capital of the Wuyue Kingdom from 907 to 978 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Named Xifu () at the time, it was one of the three great bastions of culture in southern China during the tenth century, along with Nanjing and Chengdu. Leaders of Wuyue were noted patrons of the arts, particularly of Buddhist temple architecture and artwork. The dyke built to protect the city by KingQian Liu gave the Qiantang its modern name. Hangzhou also became a cosmopolitan center, drawing scholars from throughout China and conducting diplomacy with neighboring Chinese states, and also with Japan, Goryeo, and the Khitan Liao dynasty.

=== Song dynasty ===
In 1089, another renowned poet governor Su Shi (Su Dongpo) used 200,000 workers to construct a long causeway across West Lake made of mud dredged from the lake bottom. The lake is surrounded by hills on the northern and western sides. The Baochu Pagoda sits on the Baoshi Hill to the north of the lake.

Hangzhou was chosen as the new capital of the Southern Song dynasty in 1132, when most of northern China had been conquered by the Jurchens in the Jin–Song wars. The surviving imperial family had retreated south from its original capital in Kaifeng after it was captured by the Jurchens in the Jingkang Incident of 1127. Emperor Gaozong moved to Nanjing, then to modern Shangqiu, then to Yangzhou in 1128, and finally to Hangzhou in 1129.

Once the prospect of retaking northern China had diminished, buildings in Hangzhou were extended and renovated to become a permanent imperial capital. The imperial palace in Hangzhou, modest in size, was expanded in 1133 with new roofed alleyways, and in 1148 with an extension of the palace walls. The city walls were built with tamped earth and stone and was 30 feet high and 10 feet thick at its base. There were 13 gates and several towers on the walls. The walls covered the city by four miles north to south and only one mile east to west. According to the Italian explorer Odoric of Pordenone, Hangzhou was the greatest city in the world. It was heavily populated and filled with large family estates. It had 12,000 bridges. Bread, pork, rice, and wine were abundant despite the large population. Arab merchants lived in Hangzhou during the Song dynasty, due to the fact that the oceangoing trade passages took precedence over land trade during this time. The Phoenix Mosque was constructed by a Persian settler in Hangzhou at this time.

From 1132 until the Mongol invasion of 1276, Hangzhou remained the capital of the Southern Song dynasty and was known as Lin&#x27;an (). It served as the seat of the imperial government, a center of trade and entertainment, and the nexus of the main branches of the civil service. During that time the city was a gravitational center of Chinese civilization as what used to be considered &quot;central China&quot; in the north was taken by the Jin, an ethnic minority dynasty ruled by Jurchens.

Numerous philosophers, politicians, and men of literature, including some of the most celebrated poets in Chinese history such as Su Shi, Lu You, and Xin Qiji came here to live and die. Hangzhou is also the birthplace and final resting place of the scientist Shen Kuo (1031–1095 AD), his tomb being located in the Yuhang district.

During the Southern Song dynasty, commercial expansion, an influx of refugees from the conquered north, and the growth of the official and military establishments, led to a corresponding population increase and the city developed well outside its 9th-century ramparts. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, Hangzhou had a population of over 2 million at that time, while historian Jacques Gernet has estimated that the population of Hangzhou numbered well over one million by 1276. (Official Chinese census figures from the year 1270 listed some 186,330 families in residence and probably failed to count non-residents and soldiers.) It is believed that Hangzhou was the largest city in the world from 1180 to 1315 and from 1348 to 1358.

Because of the large population and densely crowded (often multi-story) wooden buildings, Hangzhou was particularly vulnerable to fires. Major conflagrations destroyed large sections of the city in 1208, 1229, 1237, and 1275. The 1237 fire alone destroyed 30,000 dwellings. However, the worst was the 1208 fire which burned for 4 days in a 3-mile diameter and burnt 58,097 houses as well as killing 59 people. To combat this threat, the city constructed storage buildings that were rented out to merchants where watchmen patrolled by night and was enclosed by water on all sides. Besides this, the government established an elaborate system for fighting fires, erected watchtowers, devised a system of lantern and flag signals to identify the source of the flames and direct the response, and charged more than 3,000 soldiers with the task of putting out fire.

=== Yuan dynasty ===
Hangzhou was besieged and captured by the advancing Mongol armies of Kublai Khan in 1276, three years before the final collapse of the Southern Song. Historian Patricia Buckley Ebrey noted that the Mongol Yuan dynasty killed the Jurchen Wanyan royal family by the hundreds in the Mongol siege of Kaifeng, while sparing the city of Hangzhou including the Chinese Zhao royal family of the Southern Song. The Mongols rehired Southern Song government officials and had Han Chinese artisans in Shangdu marry the palace women. The capital of the new Yuan dynasty was established in the city of Dadu (Beijing), but Hangzhou remained an important commercial and administrative center for their southern territory.

==== Foreign descriptions ====
Yuan China was very open to foreign visitors, and several returned west describing Hangzhou—under the names Khinzai, Campsay, etc.as one of the foremost cities in the world. The Venetian merchant Marco Polo supposedly visited Hangzhou in the late 13th century. In his book, he records that the city was &quot;greater than any in the world&quot; and that &quot;the number and wealth of the merchants, and the amount of goods that passed through their hands, was so enormous that no man could form a just estimate thereof&quot;. Polo&#x27;s account greatly exaggerates the city&#x27;s size, although it has been argued that the &quot;hundred miles&quot; of walls would be plausible if Chinese miles were intended instead of Italian ones and that the &quot;12,000 stone bridges&quot; might have been a copyist error born from the city&#x27;s 12 gates. In the 14th century, the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta arrived; his later account concurred that al-Khansā was &quot;the biggest city I have ever seen on the face of the earth.&quot; He visited Hangzhou in 1345 and noted its charm and described how the city sat on a beautiful lake and was surrounded by gentle green hills. He was particularly impressed by the large number of well-crafted and well-painted Chinese wooden ships with colored sails and silk awnings in the canals. He attended a banquet held by Qurtai, the Yuan Mongol administrator of the city, who according to Ibn Battuta, was fond of the skills of local Chinese conjurers.

===Modern history===
The city remained an important port until the middle of the Ming dynasty era, when its harbor slowly silted up. Under the Qing, it was the site of an imperial army garrison.

In 1856 and 1860, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom occupied Hangzhou. The city was heavily damaged during its conquest, occupation, and eventual reconquest by the Qing army.

Hangzhou was ruled by the Republic of China government under the Kuomintang from 1927 to 1937. From 1937 to 1945, the city was occupied by Japan. The Kuomintang returned in 1945, and governed until 1949. On May 3, 1949, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army entered Hangzhou and the city came under Chinese Communist Party (CCP) control. After Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s reformist policies began in the end of 1978, Hangzhou took advantage of being situated in the Yangtze Delta to bolster its development. It is now one of China&#x27;s most prosperous major cities.

During the Cultural Revolution, Hangzhou was stage to a series of labor unrest and factional fighting known as the Hangzhou incident.

Hangzhou was the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. It also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.

In February 2020, the city was under curfew measures due to the outbreak of coronavirus beginning in Wuhan that spread across China.

Within the city of Hangzhou are two notable mosques: New Hangzhou Great Mosque and the Phoenix Mosque. As late as the latter part of the 16th and early 17th centuries, the city was an important center of Chinese Jewry, and may have been the original home of the Kaifeng Jewish community. There was formerly a Jewish synagogue in Ningbo, as well as one in Hangzhou, but no traces of them are now discoverable, and the only Jews known to exist in China were in Kaifeng. Two of the Three Pillars of Chinese Catholicism were from Hangzhou.

<doc id="158190" wikidata="Q7621893" url="?curid=158190" title="Strategy of Technology">
<text>The Strategy of Technology doctrine involves a country using its advantage in technology to create and deploy weapons of sufficient power and numbers so as to overawe or beggar its opponents, forcing them to spend their limited resources on developing hi-tech countermeasures and straining their economy.

In 1983, The US Defense Intelligence Agency established a classified program, Project Socrates, to develop a national technology strategy policy. This program was designed to maintain the US military strength relative to the Soviet Union, while also maintaining the economic and military strength required to keep the US as a superpower.

The Strategy of Technology is described in the eponymous book written by Stefan T. Possony, Jerry Pournelle and Francis X. Kane (Col., USAF, and ret.) in 1970. This was required reading in the U.S. service academies, the Air War College, and the National War College during the latter half of the Cold War.

==Cold War==
The classic example of the successful deployment of this strategy was the nuclear build-up between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. during the Cold War.

Some observers believe that the Vietnam War was a necessary attritive component to this war — Soviet industrial capacity was diverted to conventional arms in North Vietnam, rather than development of new weapons and nuclear weapons — but evidence would need to be found that the then-current administration of the US saw it thus. Current consensus and evidence holds that it was but a failed defensive move in the Cold War, in the context of the Domino Doctrine.

The coup-de-grace is variously opined to be Stealth technology especially as embodied in the cruise missile, which would have required an unattainable number of installations to secure the Soviet border; the Gulf War, which proved stealth and easily overcame Soviet-doctrine Iraqi forces; or Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Strategic Defense Initiative, a clear attempt to obsolesce the Soviet nuclear arsenal, creating an immense expense for the Soviets to maintain parity.

==Opposing views and controversies==
It is argued that the strategy was not a great success in the Cold War; that the Soviet Union did little to try to keep up with the SDI system, and that the War in Afghanistan caused a far greater drain on Soviet resources. However, the Soviets spent a colossal amount of money on their &quot;Buran&quot; space shuttle in an attempt to compete with a perceived military threat from the American Space Shuttle program, which was to be used in the SDI.

There is a further consideration. It is not seriously in doubt that despite the excellent education and training of Soviet technologists and scientists, it was the nations of Europe and North America, in particular the United States, which made most of the running in technical development.

The Soviet Union did have some extraordinary technical breakthroughs of their own. For example: the 15% efficiency advantage of Soviet rocket engines which used exhaust gases to power the fuel pumps, or the VA-111 Shkval supersonic cavitation torpedo. It was also able to use both its superlative espionage arm and the inherent ability of central planning to concentrate resources to great effect.

But the United States found a way to use its opponent&#x27;s strengths for its own purposes. In the late 1990s, it emerged that many stolen technological secrets were funnelled by an arm of American intelligence to the Soviet Union. The documents were real. They were of versions of the product which contained a critical but not obvious flaw.

Such was the complexity and depth of the stolen secrets that to check them, would have required an effort almost as great as developing a similar product from scratch. Such an effort was possible in nations of the West because the cost could be defrayed by commercial sales. In Soviet states this was not an option. This sort of technological jiu-jitsu may set the pattern of future engagements.

<text>James Emory Foxx (October 22, 1907 – July 21, 1967), nicknamed &quot;Double X&quot; and &quot;the Beast&quot;, was an American professional baseball first baseman who played 20 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Athletics, Boston Red Sox, Chicago Cubs, and Philadelphia Phillies. A tremendous power hitter, Foxx retired with the second most home runs, behind only Babe Ruth, and fifth-most runs batted in (RBI). His greatest seasons were with the Philadelphia Athletics and the Boston Red Sox, where he hit a then-record 30 or more home runs in 12 consecutive seasons and drove in more than 100 runs in 13 consecutive years.

Considered one of the greatest hitters in baseball history, Foxx became the ninth player to win a Triple Crown and set a then-record for most MVP awards with three. His 58 home runs hit in 1932 were third-most all-time in a season at the time, his 438 total bases collected that same season are still fifth most all time, and he is one of only seven batters to accumulate over 400 total bases in a season more than once. Foxx won two American League (AL) batting titles, led all of baseball in home runs four times, and batted over .300 in eleven full seasons. On September 24, 1940, Foxx became the second member of the 500 home run club when he hit a sixth-inning home run off George Caster. For nearly 67 years, he held the record for the youngest major leaguer to reach 500 home runs. His 534 home runs are currently 19th all time, and his 1,922 RBI are tenth all time. With a career batting average of .325 and slugging percentage of .609, he was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1951.

==Early years==
James Emory Foxx was born on October 22, 1907, in rural Sudlersville on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, to tenant farmers Dell and Mattie Foxx. Dell Foxx had played baseball for a town team when he was younger. Jimmie Foxx did well in school but excelled in sports, particularly soccer, track, and baseball. He played all three sports at Sudlersville High School, and set the state record in both the 220 and 80 yard dash in 1923. So great were his athletic exploits he was regarded as &quot;the most promising athletic prospect in the State of Maryland&quot;, and a scholarship to the University of Maryland was arranged — in track and field — should he wish to attend. In April 1924, Foxx met with Frank &quot;Home Run&quot; Baker, a former member of Philadelphia Athletics, and then manager of the minor league Class D level Easton Farmers. Baker offered Foxx a contract to play for the Farmers for $100 a month.

Foxx had hoped to pitch or play third base, but since the team was short on catchers, Foxx moved behind the plate, a position he had played in high school and on summer all-star teams. He immediately drew interest from the Philadelphia Athletics (A&#x27;s) and New York Yankees. In July 1924, A&#x27;s owner Connie Mack purchased Foxx&#x27;s contract from the Farmers for $2,000 and Foxx stated that he would finish out the season with Easton before joining the Athletics. He traveled to Philadelphia later in the 1924 season and sat in the dugout during games, and never appeared in one. Foxx, who at this time was a senior in high school, was forbidden by Mack from participating in any school athletics for fear that this might &quot;jeopardize his baseball future.&quot; Foxx would drop out of school, and joined the Athletics for spring training in Fort Myers, Florida. As a result, he did not graduate, but he did receive a certificate which designated him an honorary member of the class.

==Professional career==
===Philadelphia Athletics (1925–1935)===

During spring training in 1925, Foxx split duties at catcher with Mickey Cochrane and Cy Perkins, and when the season started he played the role of third-string catcher. On May 1, 1925, in a game against the Washington Senators, he recorded his first career hit off Vean Gregg. In June, Mack optioned Foxx to the Providence Grays to accumulate time and practice hitting at a higher level instead of sitting on the bench in Shibe Park. In the next season, Foxx appeared in a few more games, mostly as a pinch hitter or a replacement catcher. In 1927, Foxx signed a contract for $3,000 (); however, because future Baseball Hall of Fame member Mickey Cochrane was still the primary catcher, he remained in a backup role, but had started to transition to first base. He recorded his first home run on May 31, 1927, against Urban Shocker of the New York Yankees, and finished the season batting .323 over 61 games.

In 1929, installed as the A&#x27;s regular first baseman, Foxx had a breakthrough year. On May 1, he recorded the first 5-hit game of his career as well as the first multi home run game of his career, one of three such games that season. By early July, he was batting over .400 until a slump later in the season caused his average to drop. He finished the year with 20 games where he collected 3 or more hits and finished with a .354 average with 33 home runs. During that year, Foxx appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. A strong start to the 1930 season showed that Foxx was a hitter to be feared, and on May 30, he recorded the first six-hit game of his career, against the Senators. By the end of June, after hitting 11 home runs in both May and June, he had 22 on the season and was batting .360. A slow end to the season lowered his season numbers, however, he still hit over 30 home runs for the second time in his career and finished with a .335 batting average. The 1931 season was hampered by injuries and a sinus infection, marking his first season where he did not hit above .300. He still managed to hit 30 home runs, extending his streak to 3 straight seasons.

The 1932 season would be Foxx&#x27;s first truly outstanding year. In a sign of games to come, he recorded three hits and a home run during his first game, the first of 20 games where he would record three or more hits that season. By the end of May, he had recorded 17 home runs, 49 runs batted in, and had a batting average of .417, leading the American League in every major hitting category. On July 10, Foxx had his first 3 home run game, against the Cleveland Indians, he also collected 6 hits, including a double in an 18-inning game. Although a thumb and wrist injury in August slowed his pace, he still hit 7 home runs and batted .356 over the month. Foxx finished the season strong, hitting over .390 over the last month of the season and collected another 10 home runs, the fourth such month where he reached double digits in home runs hit. At the end of the season, he had amassed 151 runs scored, 213 hits, 58 home runs, 169 RBI, a .364 batting average, and 438 total bases; he led the AL in every major category except hits and batting average. The batting champion that year, Dale Alexander, hit .367 but played in only 124 games. By modern rules that would have disqualified Alexander, Foxx would have won the Triple Crown with a 15-point lead over the runner up, Lou Gehrig. Even though Foxx actually hit 60 home runs that year, two were hit in games that were rained out, erasing them from the official batting records, causing him to narrowly miss Babe Ruth&#x27;s Major League record 60 home runs. In October, Foxx would receive 75 out of the maximum 80 possible MVP votes, giving him his first MVP award in his career.

After an uncharacteristically slow start to the 1933 season that saw him hitting only .301 with 7 home runs by June 6, he started hitting home runs again, with his second three home run game against the New York Yankees. During the month of June, he hit 13 home runs, scored 37 runs, and batted over .380 in 31 games played. On August 14, he hit for the cycle and set a then-AL record 9 runs batted in. He would hit multiple home runs in seven games and collect four or more hits in five games. He finished the season leading the American league in home runs, RBI, and batting average, which secured him the ninth Triple Crown in MLB history. He also finished with 403 total bases, leading the American League and making him the third player in history to record 400 total bases in back-to-back seasons, with Lou Gehrig and Chuck Klein being the others. As a result of his phenomenal season, he was awarded his second MVP award at the end of the year.

His 1934 season saw Foxx continue to terrorize American League pitchers. He finished the season with 44 home runs, 130 runs batted in and a .334 average. While his numbers were down compared to his previous two seasons, he still finished in the top 5 in several batting categories. This also marked the third straight season where he hit 40 or more home runs. At the end of the season, during an exhibition game in Winnipeg, he got hit by a pitch in the head and was knocked unconscious. After the incident, he suffered sinus problems for the rest of his career. In late 1934, Foxx, along with Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Charlie Gehringer, among others, went on a tour of Japan and played 18 games against Japanese teams. The start of the 1935 season saw Foxx return to his original position at catcher because of the loss of Mickey Cochrane to the Detroit Tigers. After poor performance and a series of injuries to the other Athletic infielders, Connie Mack placed Foxx back at first base. Even after finishing the season leading the American League in home runs for the 3rd time and finishing in the top 10 in most batting categories, it was still not enough for the Athletics to finish above last place. Connie Mack sold Foxx to the Boston Red Sox along with Johnny Marcum for $150,000 (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars).

===Boston Red Sox (1936–1942)===

His first season with the Red Sox was another standout campaign as he led the team in every batting category except stolen bases. He finished in the top 10 in most offensive categories by the end of the season and hit over 40 home runs for the fourth time in his career. The following season was the first time where health problems had a large effect. He fell ill with the flu during spring training in 1937 and was admitted to the hospital with pain in his forehead and vision problems. He missed the first handful of games in the season before returning with the club. He still continued to hit home runs that would leave the ballpark, including one that left Fenway Park by the center field flagpole. Hall of Fame pitcher Lefty Gomez once joked about a home run hit off him, stating &quot;I knew immediately what it was. That was a home-run ball hit off me in 1937 by Jimmie Foxx&quot; in response to Apollo astronauts finding objects on the Moon. There is no record of Foxx hitting a home run off Gomez that season, but Foxx had hit 14 home runs off Gomez during his career.

In 1938, Foxx put on an offensive showcase during the months of May, June, and September, recording at least 10 home runs and 30 RBI in each of those three months,
 including over 40 in the final month of the season. On June 16, 1938, he tied an American League record when he walked six times in a game. His totals at the end of the year set many Red Sox single-season team records. His 175 RBI that year remain a Boston Red Sox record, his 50 home runs were a record until Hall of Famer David Ortiz surpassed it in 2006 with 54, and his 398 total bases were most by a Red Sox until Jim Rice collected 406 total bases in 1978. Foxx was awarded his third and final MVP award at the end of the season, leading the AL in most categories, with only Hank Greenberg&#x27;s 58 home runs surpassing Foxx&#x27;s own total of 50.

In 1939, health problems popped up again for Foxx. Early in the season, he sought treatment for pain caused by his presumed sinus problem on a road trip from Chicago to Washington. Later on in the season, he had an emergency appendectomy in Philadelphia which cut his season short. There were very few teammates that knew how serious his health problems were. One who did was Ted Williams, who he would talk to regularly. It was at this time that Foxx had begun to drink more heavily, although it was used as a self-medication for the chronic pain that he experienced in his later career. While his heavy drinking is well known, teammates, including Ted Williams, attest that he was never overtly drunk or violent and continued to act as a mentor to his younger teammates, including Dom DiMaggio. With all of the health problems and chronic pain that Foxx had experienced, he still had an outstanding offensive season, hitting an AL leading 35 home runs and batting over .360. He finished second in MVP voting behind Joe DiMaggio. His next two seasons saw a continued decline, but Foxx continued to play at near-MVP levels. He hit 36 home runs in 1940, which marked his 12th straight season where he hit 30 or more. He finished sixth in MVP balloting and he was an All Star in his final full season in 1941 where he hit .300 and drove in 105 batters over 135 games played. On September 24, 1940, he hit his 500th career home run against George Caster, becoming the second member of the 500 Home Run Club after Babe Ruth. He suffered a broken toe during spring training in 1942 and broke a rib during batting practice later in the season. In the twilight of his career, his contract was sold to the Chicago Cubs for $10,000 () in June.

===Chicago Cubs (1942, 1944)===
With the Cubs in 1942, he split time between first base and pinch hitting duties, and by the end of the season, it was clear that his career was in sharp decline. Over 100 games, he hit .226 and had only eight home runs, by far the lowest totals of his career since his first full season in 1929. He sat out all of 1943 and returned as a pinch hitter in 1944, playing only 14 games.

===Philadelphia Phillies (1945)===
Foxx joined the Phillies in 1945 and was a two-way player. Between hitting and pitching, he hit 7 home runs over 89 games and compiled a 1–0 record and 1.59 earned run average (ERA) over 22 innings. He retired at the end of the season.

Foxx finished his 20-year career with 534 home runs, 1,922 runs batted in, 1,751 runs scored, 2,646 hits, 458 doubles, 125 triples, 1,452 walks and a .325 batting average. His 12 consecutive seasons with 30 or more home runs was a major league record until it was broken by Barry Bonds in 2004. At the end of his career, his 534 home runs placed him second only to Ruth on the all-time list and first among right-handed hitters. He retained these positions until Willie Mays passed Foxx for second place in 1966. Foxx set the record for the youngest player to reach 500 home runs at age 32 years and 338 days in the final week of the 1940 Major League Baseball season. It held until August 4, 2007, when it was broken by Alex Rodriguez at age 32 years and 8 days. During the 1930s, no one hit more home runs than Foxx&#x27;s 415 between the Athletics and Red Sox. Six years after retirement, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1951.

==Career statistics==

Source:

In three straight World Series (1929,&#x27;30,&#x27;31) covering 18 games, Foxx batted .344 (22-for-64) with 11 runs, 3 doubles, 1 triple, 4 home runs, 11 RBI, 9 walks, on-base percentage of .425, slugging percentage of .609, and on-base plus slugging percentage of 1.034.

==Post-playing career==
Foxx worked as a minor league manager and coach after his playing days ended, including managing the Fort Wayne Daisies of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League for one season in 1952. He took the team to the playoffs where they lost in the first round 2 games to 1 against the Rockford Peaches. The character of Jimmy Dugan in the 1992 movie &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;, played broadly by Tom Hanks, is loosely based on Foxx, though his players remember Foxx as having behaved significantly more gentlemanly to them, rather than the brusque manner Hanks showed his team. Foxx served as head coach for the University of Miami baseball team for two seasons, going 9–8 in 1956 and 11–12 in 1957, before being let go following the 1957 season.

A series of bad investments left Foxx broke by 1958. The Red Sox responded by naming Foxx hitting coach of their Triple-A affiliate, the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association, that season. In the early 1960s, he lived in Galesburg, Illinois, where he was working as a greeter at a locally owned steakhouse. He eventually retired to suburban Cleveland in Lakewood and was employed by the Lakewood Recreation Department. His two children, a daughter and a son, also lived in Lakewood. His son, Jimmie Foxx, Jr., played football at Lakewood High School and Kent State University.

==Death==
Foxx died on July 21, 1967, at age 59 in Miami, Florida. He became ill while eating dinner with his brother and was taken to a hospital where resuscitative efforts failed. An autopsy showed that Foxx had choked on a piece of food. The year before, Foxx&#x27;s second wife, Dorothy, had also died of choking. Foxx is buried at Flagler Memorial Park in Miami.

==Legacy==
Known as one of the greatest power hitters of all time, Ted Williams was quoted as saying in response to a question about Foxx breaking Babe Ruth&#x27;s home run record, &quot;What a man. And I&#x27;ll bet he does it, too!&quot; However, long-standing chronic health problems, injuries, heavy drinking, and a marriage of constant abuse and harassment from his first wife all caused his career to be cut short in his 30s. In 1940, Hall of Famer Joe Cronin said, &quot;He&#x27;s a marvel, isn&#x27;t he? Tell me: who was a better all-around ball player than Foxxie? Why right now I&#x27;d say he was the best catcher in the American League…They can talk all they want to about some of those old time ball players being able to play different positions. I&#x27;ll take Foxxie. They don&#x27;t come any better.&quot;

A statue of Foxx was erected in his hometown of Sudlersville, Maryland, on October 25, 1997. In 1999, he ranked number 15 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;″ list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

Tom Hanks&#x27;s character Jimmy Dugan in the movie &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; was largely based on Foxx and Hack Wilson, although the producers took a number of liberties in creating the role.

There is a Jimmie Foxx Street in San Antonio, Texas.

Foxx is mentioned in the poem &quot;Line-Up for Yesterday&quot; by Ogden Nash:

<text>Stone Fruit is a graphic novel by Lee Lai, published May 11, 2021 by Fantagraphics.

In 2022, the book won the Lambda Literary Award for Graphic Novel/Comics, was a Barbara Gittings Literature Award honor book, and a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Graphic Novel/Comics.

== Reception ==
&quot;Stone Fruit&quot; was generally well-received, including starred reviews from &quot;Booklist&quot; and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;.

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; applauded how Lai &quot;skillfully captures the ways family dynamics and histories play out in romantic relationships, and how heavy those legacies can land,&quot; which results in &quot;a poignant and mature rumination on how people change, and change each other, proving Lai a talent well worth watching.&quot; Terry Hong, writing for &quot;Booklist&quot;, called the novel a &quot;jaw-dropping debut&quot; with &quot;stunning artistry,&quot; complementing by Lai&#x27;s &quot;complex narrative skills.&quot; Laura Olive Sackton, writing for the &quot;Chicago Review of Books,&quot; also applauded the novel, calling it &quot;[a] remarkable contribution to this chorus of queer storytelling,&quot; saying the narrative is filled with &quot;smart dialogue and character growth&quot; and that through the illustration, Lai &quot;literally draws transformation, and the feelings it evokes, onto the page.&quot;

&quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Rachel Cooke provided a mixed review, calling &quot;Stone Fruit&quot; &quot;[a] downbeat but moving exploration of the aftermath of a relationship.&quot; Cooke noted that while the book is affective, &quot;you finish it with no hope at all that its characters will ever be able to resolve their difficulties. There is something intensely bleak at its centre.&quot;

<text>A committee or commission is a body of one or more persons subordinate to a deliberative assembly or other form of organization. A committee may not itself be considered to be a form of assembly or a decision-making body. Usually, an assembly or organization sends matters to a committee as a way to explore them more fully than would be possible if the whole assembly or organization were considering them. Committees may have different functions and their types of work differ depending on the type of organization and its needs.

A member of a legislature may be delegated a committee assignment, which gives them the right to serve on a certain committee.

==Purpose==
A deliberative assembly or other organization may form a committee (or &quot;commission&quot;) consisting of one or more persons to assist with the work of the assembly. For larger organizations, much work is done in committees. They can be a way to formally draw together people of relevant expertise from different parts of an organization who otherwise would not have a good way to share information and coordinate actions. They may have the advantage of widening viewpoints and sharing out responsibilities. They can also be appointed with experts to recommend actions in matters that require specialized knowledge or technical judgment.

=== Functions ===
Committees can serve several different functions:
;Governance: In organizations considered too large for all the members to participate in decisions affecting the organization as a whole, a smaller body, such as a board of directors, is given the power to make decisions, spend money, or take actions. A &quot;governance committee&quot; is formed as a separate committee to review the performance of the board and board policy as well as nominate candidates for the board.
; Coordination and administration: A large body may have smaller committees with more specialized functions. Examples are an audit committee, an elections committee, a finance committee, a fundraising committee, and a program committee. Large conventions or academic conferences are usually organized by a coordinating committee drawn from the membership of the organization.
; Research and recommendations: Committees may be formed to do research and make recommendations on a potential or planned project or change. For example, an organization considering a major capital investment might create a temporary working committee of several people to review options and make recommendations to upper management or the board of directors.
;Discipline:A committee on discipline may be used to handle disciplinary procedures for members of the organization.

;As a tactic for indecision: As a means of public relations by sending sensitive, inconvenient, or irrelevant matters to committees, organizations may bypass, stall, or disacknowledge matters without declaring a formal policy of inaction or indifference. However, this could be considered a dilatory tactic.

=== Power and authority ===
Generally, committees are required to report to their parent body. They do not usually have the power to act independently unless the body that created it gives it such power.

==Formal procedures==

When a committee is formed in a formal situation, such as committees in legislatures or for corporate bodies with by-laws, a chairman (or &quot;chair&quot; or &quot;chairperson&quot;) is designated for the committee. Sometimes a vice-chairman (or similar name) is also appointed. It is common for the committee chairman to organize its meetings. Sometimes these meetings are held through videoconferencing or other means if committee members are not able to attend in person, as may be the case if they are in different parts of the country or the world.

The chairman is responsible for running meetings. Duties include keeping the discussion on the appropriate subject, recognizing members to speak, and confirming what the committee has decided (through voting or by unanimous consent). Using &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot; (RONR), committees may follow informal procedures (such as not requiring motions if it is clear what is being discussed). The level of formality depends on the size and type of committee, in which sometimes larger committees considering crucial issues may require more formal processes.

Minutes are a record of the decisions at meetings. They can be taken by a person designated as the secretary. For most organizations, committees are not required to keep formal minutes. However, some bodies require that committees take minutes, especially if the committees are public ones subject to open meeting laws.

Committees may meet on a regular basis, such as weekly or more often, or meetings may be called irregularly as the need arises. The frequency of the meetings depends on the work of the committee and the needs of the parent body.

When the committee completes its work, it provides the results in a report to its parent body. The report may include the methods used, the facts uncovered, the conclusions reached, and any recommendations. If the committee is not ready to report, it may provide a partial report or the assembly may discharge the committee of the matter so that the assembly can handle it. Also, if members of the committee are not performing their duties, they may be removed or replaced by the appointing power. Whether the committee continues to exist after presenting its report depends on the type of committee. Generally, committees established by the bylaws or the organization&#x27;s rules continue to exist, while committees formed for a particular purpose go out of existence after the final report.

=== Commit (motion) ===

In parliamentary procedure, the motion to commit (or refer) is used to refer another motion—usually a main motion—to a committee.

A motion to commit should specify to which committee the matter is to be referred, and if the committee is a special committee appointed specifically for purposes of the referred motion, it should also specify the number of committee members and the method of their selection, unless that is specified in the bylaws.

Any proposed amendments to the main motion that are pending at the time the motion is referred to a committee go to the committee as well.

Once referred, but before the committee reports its recommendations back to the assembly, the referred motion may be removed from the committee&#x27;s consideration by the motion to discharge a committee.

=== Recommit ===
In the United States House of Representatives, a motion to recommit can be made with or without instructions. If the motion is made without instructions, the bill or resolution is simply sent back to the committee. If the motion is made with instructions and the motion is agreed to, the chairman of the committee in question will immediately report the bill or resolution back to the whole House with the new language. In this sense, a motion to recommit with instructions is effectively an amendment.

=== Variations for full assembly consideration ===
In &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot; (&quot;RONR&quot;), the motion to commit has three variations which do not turn a question over to a smaller group, but simply permit the assembly&#x27;s full meeting body to consider it with the greater freedom of debate that is allowed to committees. These forms are to go into a committee of the whole, to go into a quasi-committee of the whole, and to consider informally. Passing any of these motions removes the limitations on the number of times a member can speak. &quot;The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure&quot; has informal consideration, but does not have &quot;committee of the whole&quot; or &quot;quasi committee of the whole&quot;.

=== Discharge a committee ===
In &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot;, the motion to discharge a committee is used to take a matter out of a committee&#x27;s hands before the committee has made a final report on it. A committee can use this motion to discharge a subcommittee.

The vote required is a majority vote, if the committee has failed to report at the prescribed time or if the assembly is considering a partial report of the committee. Otherwise, it requires a majority vote with previous notice; a two-thirds vote; or a majority of the entire membership.

Under &quot;The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure&quot;, the assembly that has referred a motion or a matter to a committee may, by a majority vote, withdraw it at any time from the committee, refer it to another committee, or decide the question itself.

== Types ==
=== Executive committee ===
Organizations with a large board of directors (such as international labor unions, large corporations with thousands of stockholders or national and international organizations) may have a smaller body of the board, called an &quot;executive committee&quot;, to handle its business. The executive committee may function more like a board than an actual committee. In any case, an executive committee can only be established through a specific provision in the charter or bylaws of the entity (i.e. a board cannot appoint an executive committee without authorization to do so). Members of the executive committee may be elected by the overall franchised membership or by the board, depending on the rules of the organization, and usually consist of the CEO and the Vice Presidents in charge of respective directorates within the organization. However formed, an executive committee only has such powers and authority that the governing documents of the organization give it. In some cases, it may be empowered to act on behalf of the board or organization, while in others, it may only be able to make recommendations.

===Conference committee===
Governments at the national level may have a &quot;conference committee&quot;. A conference committee in a bicameral legislature is responsible for creating a compromise version of a particular bill when each house has passed a different version.

A conference committee in the United States Congress is a temporary panel of negotiators from the House of Representatives and the Senate. Unless one chamber decides to accept the other&#x27;s original bill, the compromise version must pass both chambers after leaving the conference committee. This committee is usually composed of the senior members of the standing committees that originally considered the legislation in each chamber.

Other countries that use conference committees include France, Germany, Japan, and Switzerland. In Canada, conference committees have been unused since 1947. In the European Union (EU) legislative process, a similar committee is called a &#x27;Conciliation Committee&#x27;, which carries out the Trilogue negotiations in case the Council does not agree with a text amended and adopted by the European Parliament at a second reading. Although the practice has fallen out of favour in other Australian Parliaments, the Parliament of South Australia still regularly appoints a &quot;Conference of Managers&quot; from each House to negotiate compromises on disputed bills in private.

==== Different use of term ====
In organizations, the term &quot;conference committee&quot; may have a different meaning. This meaning may be associated with the conferences, or conventions, that the organization puts together. These committees that are responsible for organizing such events may be called &quot;conference committees&quot;.

===Standing committee===
A standing committee is a subunit of a political or deliberative body established in a permanent fashion to aid the parent assembly in accomplishing its duties, for example by meeting on a specific, permanent policy domain (e.g. defence, health, or trade and industry). A standing committee is granted its scope and powers over a particular area of business by the governing documents. Standing committees meet on a regular or irregular basis depending on their function, and retain any power or oversight originally given them until subsequent official actions of the governing body (through changes to law or by-laws) disbands the committee.

==== Legislatures ====

Most governmental legislative committees are standing committees. This phrase is used in the legislatures of the following countries:
* Armenia
** Standing Committees of the National Assembly
* Australia
** Australian House of Representatives committees
** Australian Senate committees
* Canada
** List of committees of the Canadian House of Commons
** Standing committee (Canada)
* China
** Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress
** Special committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress
** Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
* Iceland
** List of standing committees of the Icelandic parliament
* Ireland
** Committees of the Oireachtas
* Hong Kong
** Legislative Council (Hong Kong)
* India
** Standing committee (India)
* Malaysia
** Dewan Rakyat committees
** Dewan Negara committees
* New Zealand
** New Zealand House of Representatives committees
* Thailand
** Parliamentary committees of Thailand
* United Kingdom
** Parliamentary committees of the United Kingdom
**Public bill committee
* United States
** Standing committee (United States Congress)
Under the laws of the United States of America, a standing committee is a Congressional committee permanently authorized by the United States House of Representatives and United States Senate rules. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 greatly reduced the number of committees, and set up the legislative committee structure still in use today, as modified by authorized changes via the orderly mechanism of rule changes.

==== Examples in organizations ====
Examples of standing committees in organizations are; an audit committee, an elections committee, a finance committee, a fundraising committee, a governance committee, and a program committee. Typically, the standing committees perform their work throughout the year and present their reports at the annual meeting of the organization. These committees continue to exist after presenting their reports, although the membership in the committees may change.

=== Nominating committee ===
A nominating committee (or nominations committee) is a group formed for the purpose of nominating candidates for office or the board in an organization. It may consist of members from inside the organization. Sometimes a governance committee takes the role of a nominating committee. Depending on the organization, this committee may be empowered to actively seek out candidates or may only have the power to receive nominations from members and verify that the candidates are eligible.

A nominating committee works similarly to an electoral college, the main difference being that the available candidates, either nominated or &quot;written in&quot; outside of the committee&#x27;s choices, are then voted into office by the membership. It is a part of governance methods often employed by corporate bodies, business entities, and social and sporting groups, especially clubs. The intention is that they be made up of qualified and knowledgeable people representing the best interests of the membership. In the case of business entities, their directors will often be brought in from outside, and receive a benefit for their expertise.

In the context of nominations for awards, a nominating committee can also be formed for the purpose of nominating persons or things held up for judgment by others as to their comparative quality or value, especially for the purpose of bestowing awards in the arts, or in application to industry&#x27;s products and services. The objective being to update, set, and maintain high and possibly new standards.

=== Steering committee ===
A steering committee is a committee that provides guidance, direction and control to a project within an organization. The term is derived from the steering mechanism that changes the steering angle of a vehicle&#x27;s wheels.

Project steering committees are frequently used for guiding and monitoring IT projects in large organizations, as part of project governance. The functions of the committee might include building a business case for the project, planning, providing assistance and guidance, monitoring the progress, controlling the project scope and resolving conflicts.

As with other committees, the specific duties and role of the steering committee vary among organizations.

=== Special committee ===

A special committee (also working, select, or ad hoc committee) is established to accomplish a particular task or to oversee a specific area in need of control or oversight. Many are research or coordination committees in type or purpose and are temporary. Some are a sub-group of a larger society with a particular area of interest which are organized to meet and discuss matters pertaining to their interests. For example; a group of astronomers might be organized to discuss how to get the larger society to address near Earth objects. A subgroup of engineers and scientists of a large project&#x27;s development team could be organized to solve some particular issue with offsetting considerations and trade-offs. Once the committee makes its final report to its parent body, the special committee ceases to exist.

===Subcommittee===
A committee that is a subset of a larger committee is called a &quot;subcommittee&quot;. Committees that have a large workload may form subcommittees to further divide the work. Subcommittees report to the parent committee and not to the general assembly.

===Committee of the whole===

When the entire assembly meets as a committee to discuss or debate, this is called a &quot;committee of the whole&quot;. This is a procedural device most commonly used by legislative bodies to discuss an issue under the rules of a committee meeting rather than the more formal and rigid rules which would have to be followed to actually enact legislation.

=== Central Committee ===
&quot;Central Committee&quot; is the common designation of the highest organ of communist parties between two congresses. The committee was elected by the party congress and led party activities, elected the politburo and the general secretary of the communist party.

<doc id="158197" wikidata="Q2117625" url="?curid=158197" title="Puff, the Magic Dragon">
<text>&quot;Puff, the Magic Dragon&quot; (or just &quot;Puff&quot;) is an American folk song written by Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul and Mary from a poem by Leonard Lipton. It was made popular by Peter, Paul and Mary in a 1962 recording released in January 1963.

Lipton wrote a poem about a dragon in 1959, and, when Yarrow found it, he wrote the lyrics to &quot;Puff&quot; based on the poem. After the song was released, Yarrow searched for Lipton to give him credit for the song.

==Lyrics==
The lyrics for &quot;Puff, the Magic Dragon&quot; are based on a 1959 poem by Leonard Lipton, then a 19-year-old Cornell University student. Lipton drew inspiration from Ogden Nash&#x27;s poem &quot;The Tale of Custard the Dragon&quot;. 
The song tells the story of an immortal dragon named Puff and his playmate, Jackie Paper, as they embark on adventures in the fictional county of Honalee. As time passes, Jackie matures and abandons his childhood games, leaving Puff alone and saddened.

Lipton, who was acquainted with Peter Yarrow through a mutual friend at Cornell, used Yarrow&#x27;s typewriter to commit his poem to paper. He forgot about it until years later, when a friend informed him that Yarrow was seeking him to properly credit him for the lyrics. Upon reconnecting, Yarrow shared half of the songwriting credit with Lipton, who received royalties for the song until his death in 2022. Yarrow later died in 2025.

In later performances, Yarrow changed the line &quot;A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys&quot; to &quot;A dragon lives forever, but not so girls and boys&quot;, to be more inclusive. The original poem included a stanza about Puff finding a new playmate, but this was not incorporated into the song. The paper left in Yarrow&#x27;s typewriter in 1959 has since been lost.

==Reception==
&quot;Cash Box&quot; described it as &quot;a charming folk tune, about a magic dragon, right-up-the-vocal-alley of the remarkably successful folksters.&quot;

==Speculation about drug references==
After the song&#x27;s initial success, speculation arose—as early as a 1964 article in &quot;Newsweek&quot;—that the song contained veiled references to smoking marijuana. The word &quot;paper&quot; in the name of Puff&#x27;s human friend Jackie Paper was said to be a reference to rolling papers, the words &quot;by the sea&quot; were interpreted as &quot;by the C&quot; (as in cannabis), the word &quot;mist&quot; stood for &quot;smoke&quot;, the land of &quot;Honahlee&quot; stood for hashish, and &quot;dragon&quot; was interpreted as &quot;draggin&#x27;&quot; (i.e., inhaling smoke). Similarly, the name &quot;Puff&quot; was alleged to be a reference to taking a &quot;puff&quot; on a joint. The supposition was claimed to be common knowledge in a letter by a member of the public to &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1984.

The authors of the song repeatedly rejected this interpretation and have strongly and consistently denied that they intended any references to drug use. Both Lipton and Yarrow had stated, &quot;&#x27;Puff, the Magic Dragon&#x27; is not about drugs.&quot; Yarrow frequently explained that the song is about the hardships of growing older and has no relationship to drug-taking. He also said that the song has &quot;never had any meaning other than the obvious one&quot; and is about the &quot;loss of innocence in children.&quot; He dismissed the suggestion of it being associated with drugs as &quot;sloppy research&quot;.

In 1973, Peter Yarrow&#x27;s bandmate, Paul Stookey of Peter, Paul and Mary, also defended the song&#x27;s innocence in a novel way. He recorded a version of the song at the Sydney Opera House in March 1973 where he set up a fictitious trial scene. The prosecutor of the trial claimed the song was about marijuana, but Puff and Jackie protested. The judge finally left the case to the &quot;jury&quot; (the Opera House audience) and said if they would sing along, the song would be acquitted. The audience joined in with Stookey and at the end of their sing-along, the judge declared the &quot;case dismissed.&quot;

Up to his death in January 2025, Yarrow maintained that the song did not reference marijuana.

==Notable recordings and chart performance==
In 1961, Peter Yarrow joined Paul Stookey and Mary Travers to form Peter, Paul and Mary. The group incorporated the song into their live performances before recording it in 1962. The trio&#x27;s 1962 recording of &quot;Puff the Magic Dragon&quot; entered the top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts on March 30, 1963, and peaked at number two, kept out of the top spot by &quot;I Will Follow Him&quot; by Little Peggy March. It topped Billboard&#x27;s Adult Contemporary charts. It also reached number ten on Billboard&#x27;s R&amp;B chart. In Canada, the song reached number five in April 1963.


===Weekly charts===

===Year-end charts===

== Notable cover versions ==
During the autumn of 1966, Swedish pop band Fabulous Four, which included Lalla Hansson recorded the song; the session was produced by keyboardist Benny Andersson, later of ABBA fame. Released as a single in November of that year, it was the group&#x27;s first release on independent record label Hep House, started by Andersson&#x27;s band Hep Stars, following Fabulous Four&#x27;s departure from Fontana Records. The single, backed by a cover of Woody Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot;, became a hit. It debuted at number one on &quot;Tio i Topp&quot; on November 26, 1966, staying there for three consecutive weeks before being replaced by Donovan&#x27;s &quot;Mellow Yellow&quot;. On sales chart Kvällstoppen, the single reached number three on December 20, 1966.

==Adaptations==
A 1978 animated television special, &quot;Puff the Magic Dragon&quot;, adapted the song. It was followed by two sequels, &quot;Puff the Magic Dragon in the Land of the Living Lies&quot; and &quot;Puff and the Incredible Mr. Nobody&quot;. In all three films, Burgess Meredith voiced Puff. In September 1979, a picture-book based on the animated feature, written by Romeo Muller, known for his contributions to the Rankin-Bass holiday TV specials, was published by Avon Books. In December 2016, it was announced that Fox Animation would produce a live-action/animation film based on the song with Mike Mitchell as director. As of November 2020, the progress of this project had no updates, leading some fans to conclude that it has been quietly canceled. 

The song was adapted for a children&#x27;s pantomime, which played at Sydney&#x27;s Seymour Centre in 1983.

A 2007 book adaptation of the song&#x27;s lyrics by Yarrow, Lipton, and illustrator Eric Puybaret gives the story a happier ending with a young girl (presumed by reviewers to be Jackie Paper&#x27;s daughter) seeking out Puff to become her new companion. The lyrics remain unchanged from the Peter, Paul, and Mary version; the young girl is only seen in the pictures by illustrator Puybaret. On the last page of the book, she is introduced to Puff by an older Jackie Paper.

The tune was used by Versatec, a computer printer company, in the promotional LP &quot;Push the Magic Button&quot; for the song of the same name.

American fabulist Robert Coover wrote about the later lives of Puff and Jackie Paper in &quot;Sir John Paper Returns to Honah-Lee&quot;, the first story in his collection &quot;A Child Again&quot; (McSweeney&#x27;s Books, 2005).

==Parodies==
In the mid 1970s, an American Jewish band named Ruach created a parody version of the song entitled &quot;Puff the Kosher Dragon&quot;. In the course of the song, Kosher Puff eats kosher food, has a bar mitzvah, fights anti-Semites, and finally marries and brings up his children as loyal members of the faith. The Ruach song has been noted as one of the first examples of a modern Jewish band using a popular secular tune.

Both tune and elements of the lyrics were adapted in the controversial parody &quot;Barack the Magic Negro&quot;, written and recorded by Paul Shanklin for Rush Limbaugh&#x27;s radio program, after the term was first applied to then presidential candidate Barack Obama by movie and culture critic David Ehrenstein. In a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; op-ed column of March 19, 2007, Yarrow condemned the act as &quot;shocking and saddening in the extreme,&quot; stating that &quot;taking a children&#x27;s song and twisting it in such vulgar, mean-spirited way, is a slur to our entire country and our common agreement to move beyond racism… It is almost unimaginable to me that Chip Saltzman, who sent the CD [as a Christmas greeting to NRC members], would seriously be considered for the top post of the Republican National Committee. Puff, himself, if asked, would certainly agree.&quot;

==Vietnam War gunship==
During the Vietnam War, the AC-47 Spooky gunship was nicknamed the &quot;Dragon&quot; or &quot;Dragon ship&quot; by the Americans because of its armament and firepower. The nickname soon caught on, and American troops began to call the AC-47 &quot;Puff the Magic Dragon&quot;. Robert Mason&#x27;s &quot;Chickenhawk&quot; states, in reference to the Peter, Paul, and Mary song playing on a turntable: Puff the Magic Dragon&#x27; was making me uncomfortable. It was the saccharine song that had inspired the naming of the murderous Gatling-gun-armed C-47s. I couldn&#x27;t listen.&quot;

==In popular culture==
*The song is a favorite of Jack Byrnes in the 2000 comedy film &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;. Greg Focker makes light of the urban legend of the song being about drugs, which an irritated Jack has never heard. In the film&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Meet the Fockers&quot;, Jack has rigged his RV&#x27;s horn to honk out the first notes of &quot;Puff, the Magic Dragon&quot;.
*Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX, said his Dragon spacecraft was named after &quot;Puff, the Magic Dragon&quot;.

<text>Ælfgifu of Northampton (; 990 – after 1036) was the first wife of Cnut the Great, King of England and Denmark, and mother of Harold Harefoot, King of England. She was regent of Norway from 1030 to 1035.

==Biography==

===Family background===
Ælfgifu was born into an important noble family based in the Midlands (Mercia). She was a daughter of Ælfhelm, ealdorman of southern Northumbria, and his wife Wulfrun. Ælfhelm was killed in 1006, probably at the command of King Æthelred the Unready, and Ælfgifu&#x27;s brothers, Ufegeat and Wulfheah, were blinded. Wulfric Spot, a wealthy nobleman and patron of Burton Abbey, was the brother of Ælfhelm or Wulfrun. The family again came under suspicion during the invasion of England by Swein Forkbeard, King of Denmark, in 1013–14, and further members were charged with treachery and killed. It is possible that Ælfgifu was a kinswoman of the wife of Ælfgar, Earl of Mercia, also called Ælfgifu.

===Marriage to Cnut===
When Swein invaded, northern peoples, some of them of Scandinavian descent, immediately submitted to him. He then married his young son Cnut to Ælfgifu to seal their loyalty. Swein went on to conquer the whole of England and was accepted as King, but he died in February 1014 after a reign of only five weeks. Æthelred then sent an army which forced Cnut to flee back to Denmark, and in the opinion of historian Ian Howard, he left his wife and their baby son, Svein, the future King of Norway, behind with her family. They were anxious to make their peace with Æthelred, but unwilling to hand Ælfgifu and her son over to Æthelred to be killed, so they sent the mother and child with King Swein&#x27;s body to Denmark. There she became pregnant again, and in 1015 or 1016 she gave birth to Harold Harefoot. In the period immediately following, she may have been given authority over some region of Denmark, perhaps that of a Danish-controlled area of the Baltic coastline.

Her two sons were to figure prominently in the empire which their father built in northern Europe, though not without opposition. After his conquest of England in 1016, Cnut married Emma of Normandy, the widow of King Æthelred. It was then regarded as acceptable to put aside one wife and take another if the first wife was acquired through the non-Christian pagan ceremony of &quot;handfasting&quot; and nearly always for reasons of political advantage, a practice which might be described as &quot;serial monogamy&quot;; this was the case with the marriage of Ælfgifu to Cnut. The status of Cnut&#x27;s two &#x27;marriages&#x27; and their social context in England and Scandinavia has been discussed recently by Timothy Bolton. Emma&#x27;s sons, Edward and Ælfred by Æthelred and Harthacnut by Cnut, were also claimants to the throne of her husband. Exactly how the second marriage affected Ælfgifu&#x27;s status as Cnut&#x27;s first consort is unknown, but there is no evidence to suggest that she was repudiated.

===Regent in Norway (1030–35)===
After the defeat and death of Olaf II of Norway by forces loyal to Cnut, Cnut sent Ælfgifu with their eldest son Svein to rule Norway, in 1030. Their rule was, however, so harsh that the Norwegians rebelled against them. They were driven out, in 1034 or 1035, while Svein died of wounds in Denmark shortly after, probably in 1036. In Norway, where she was known as &quot;Álfífa&quot; in Old Norse, this period entered history as &#x27;Álfífa&#x27;s time&#x27; (&quot;Álfífuǫld&quot;), remembered for her severe rule and heavy taxation. In the Norwegian &quot;Ágrip&quot;, for instance, the following verse is attributed to her contemporary, the skald Sigvatr:

:Ælfgyfu&#x27;s time
:long will the young man remember,
:when they at home ate ox&#x27;s food,
:and like the goats, ate rind;

===Succession crisis after the death of Cnut (1035)===
Cnut died at Shaftesbury in 1035. Symeon of Durham and Adam of Bremen suggest that Cnut had reserved the English throne for Harold, while the &quot;Encomium Emmae Reginae&quot;, written to defend Harthacnut&#x27;s mother, Emma, claims that he had done so for Harthacnut. Ælfgifu was determined that her second son Harold should be the next English king. She had returned to England (at least) by 1036, while Emma&#x27;s son Harthacnut was away in Denmark, at war with the Norwegian king Magnus I, and the Swedes under their king Anund Jacob. Emma&#x27;s other sons, Ælfred and Edward, stayed in Normandy. With help from her supporters, Ælfgifu was able to secure the throne for her son. In the view of Frank Stenton, she was probably the real ruler of England for part, if not the whole, of his reign.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (versions C, D and E) describes how Harold and his men forcefully laid claim on the treasury housed in Winchester, where Cnut was buried and Emma (whom the Anglo-Saxons also referred to as &quot;Ælfgifu&quot; the queen) had taken up residence:

Manuscript E, which is known for its Godwinist sympathies, adds a number of details, including the assembly at Oxford in 1037 at which Harold was elected king of England and the mustering of support north of the Thames, where the power base of Ælfgifu&#x27;s family was concentrated.

During 1036, opinion in England moved towards Harold. By August a report had reached Emma&#x27;s daughter, Gunnhild, at the German court that her &quot;unhappy and unjust step-mother&quot; (i.e. Ælfgifu) was working to deprive Gunnhild&#x27;s brother, Harthacnut, of the kingdom by holding great feasts, and trying by argument and gifts to persuade the leading nobles to give their fealty to Harold. Emma&#x27;s encomiast attributes to her even more seriously dishonest methods. She makes Ælfgifu an accomplice in the murder of Emma&#x27;s youngest son, Alfred Aetheling, by suggesting that she was responsible for sending a forged letter to Normandy inviting Alfred to England. The &quot;Encomium Emmae Reginae&quot; also claimed that Ælfgifu&#x27;s son Harold was a servant&#x27;s son.

Ælfgifu is not recorded after 1036, apart from a possible reference to her as the &quot;lady&quot;, and it is not known when she died.

<text>Peter, Paul and Mary were an American folk group formed in New York City in 1961 during the American folk music revival. The trio consisted of Peter Yarrow (guitar, tenor vocals), Noel Paul (&quot;Paul&quot;) Stookey (guitar, baritone vocals), and Mary Travers (contralto vocals). The group&#x27;s repertoire included songs written by Yarrow and Stookey, early songs by Bob Dylan, and covers of other folk musicians.

They were very successful in the early- and mid-1960s, with their debut album topping the charts for weeks, and helped popularize the folk music revival. Following Travers&#x27;s death in 2009, Yarrow and Stookey continued to perform as a duo. Yarrow died in 2025, leaving Stookey the sole surviving member of the group.

Travers said she was influenced by Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, and the Weavers. In May 1963, Stookey described the formation and dynamics of the group on Folk Music Worldwide, an international short-wave radio show in New York City. In the 2004 documentary &quot;Peter, Paul &amp; Mary: Carry It On — A Musical Legacy&quot;, members of the Weavers discuss how Peter, Paul and Mary took over the torch of the social commentary of folk music in the 1960s.

The group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999. Peter, Paul and Mary received the Sammy Cahn Lifetime Achievement Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2006.

==History==
===Early years and popularity (1961–1969)===
Manager Albert Grossman created Peter, Paul and Mary in 1961, after auditioning several singers in the New York folk scene, including Dave Van Ronk, who was rejected as too idiosyncratic and uncommercial, and Carolyn Hester. After rehearsing Yarrow, Stookey and Travers out of town in Boston and Miami, Grossman booked them into The Bitter End, a coffee house, nightclub and popular folk music venue in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village.

The group recorded their debut album, &quot;Peter, Paul and Mary&quot;, and it was released by Warner Bros. the following year. It included &quot;Lemon Tree&quot;, &quot;500 Miles&quot;, and the Pete Seeger hit tunes &quot;If I Had a Hammer&quot; (subtitled &quot;The Hammer Song&quot;) and &quot;Where Have All the Flowers Gone?&quot; The album was listed in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Ten for 10 months, including seven weeks in the No. 1 position. It remained a main catalog-seller for decades to come, eventually selling over two million copies, earning double platinum certification from the RIAA in the United States alone.

In 1963 the group released &quot;Puff, the Magic Dragon&quot;, with music by Yarrow and words based on a poem that had been written by a fellow student at Cornell, Leonard Lipton. Despite rumors that the song refers to drugs, it is actually about the lost innocence of childhood. The same year, they appeared as the &quot;mystery guest&quot; on the CBS TV game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; in which Dorothy Kilgallen correctly guessed their identity.

That year the group performed &quot;If I Had a Hammer&quot; and &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; at the August 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, best remembered for Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech. The Bob Dylan song &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; was one of their biggest hit singles. They also sang other Dylan songs, such as &quot;The Times They Are a-Changin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Think Twice, It&#x27;s All Right&quot;, and &quot;When the Ship Comes In&quot;. Their success with Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Think Twice, It&#x27;s All Right&quot; helped Dylan&#x27;s &quot;The Freewheelin&#x27; Bob Dylan&quot; album rise into the top 30; it had been released four months earlier.

In December 1969 &quot;Leaving on a Jet Plane&quot;, written by the group&#x27;s friend John Denver, became their only No. 1 single (as well as their final top 40 pop hit) and the group&#x27;s sixth million-selling gold single. The track first appeared on their million-selling platinum certified &quot;Album 1700&quot; in 1967 (which also contained their No. 9 hit &quot;I Dig Rock and Roll Music&quot;). After Eugene McCarthy&#x27;s strong showing in the 1968 New Hampshire presidential primary, the group recorded &quot;Eugene McCarthy For President (If You Love Your Country)&quot; endorsing McCarthy, which was released without a record label. &quot;Day Is Done&quot;, a No. 21 hit in June 1969 from the trio&#x27;s Grammy Award-winning album &quot;Peter, Paul and Mommy&quot;, was the last Hot 100 hit the trio recorded.

===Breakup (1970–1978)===
The trio broke up in 1970 to pursue solo careers. Also that year, Yarrow was convicted of sexually molesting a 14-year-old girl. Years later, he received a presidential pardon from Jimmy Carter.

During 1971 and 1972 Warner released a debut solo album, with the same style cover, by each member of the group. Travers did concerts and lectures across the United States. She also produced, wrote, and starred in a BBC-TV series. Stookey formed a Christian music group, the Body Works Band, and wrote &quot;The Wedding Song (There Is Love)&quot; for Yarrow&#x27;s marriage to Marybeth McCarthy, the niece of Eugene McCarthy. Britain&#x27;s Petula Clark also recorded a version of the song, which in 1973 charted strongly in the UK, Australia and elsewhere. Yarrow co-wrote and produced Mary MacGregor&#x27;s &quot;Torn Between Two Lovers&quot; (No. 1, 1977) and earned an Emmy for three animated TV specials based on &quot;Puff the Magic Dragon&quot;.

While the group was de facto broken up and touring separately, it still managed to come together for a series of reunions before officially coming back together again. In 1972, the trio reunited for Together for McGovern, a concert at Madison Square Garden to support George McGovern&#x27;s presidential campaign, and again in 1978 for a concert to protest nuclear energy. This concert was followed by a 1978 summer reunion tour, including a September 3 evening performance at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. An album, &quot;Reunion&quot;, was released by Warner in 1978.

===Reunion (1981–2009)===

Their 1978 summer reunion tour was so popular that the group decided to reunite more or less permanently in 1981. They continued to record albums and tour, playing around 45 shows a year, until Travers&#x27;s 2009 death. After their reunion, double-bassist Dick Kniss (who had been their bassist in their studio recordings and with their 1960s tours) rejoined the group. Starting in 1990, multi-instrumentalist Paul Prestopino also joined the group.

According to the flow of the times, they derived a way to change the lyrics of their songs, for example changing &quot;boys&quot; in the &quot;Puff&quot; became &quot;girls and boys&quot;. Some of their new songs, like &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Down To The Quarry&quot; that criticizes an evil bet, continue the tradition of protest songs. The trio received the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience award on September 1, 1990.

In 2004, Travers was diagnosed with leukemia, leading to the cancellation of that year&#x27;s remaining tour dates. She received a bone marrow transplant. She and the rest of the trio resumed their tour on December 9, 2005, with a holiday performance at Carnegie Hall.

The trio canceled several dates of their summer 2007 tour, as Travers had to undergo a second surgery. She was unable to perform on the trio&#x27;s tour in mid-2009 because of the effects of leukemia, but Yarrow and Stookey performed the scheduled dates as a duo, calling the show &quot;Peter &amp; Paul Celebrate Mary and 5 Decades of Friendship&quot;.

On September 16, 2009, Travers died at age 72, of complications from chemotherapy, following treatment for leukemia. That same year, Peter, Paul and Mary were inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame.

On January 7, 2025, Yarrow died of bladder cancer at age 86. With his death, Stookey is the last surviving member of the group.

<text>The German Africa Corps (, ; DAK), commonly known as Afrika Korps, was the German expeditionary force in Africa during the North African campaign of World War II. First sent as a holding force to shore up the Italian defense of its African colonies, the formation fought on in Africa, under various appellations, from March 1941 until its surrender in May 1943. The unit&#x27;s best known commander was Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, whose reputation as one of the ablest tank commanders of the war earned him the nickname &quot;der Wüstenfuchs&quot;, &quot;the Desert Fox&quot;.

==History==
===Organization===
The Afrika Korps formed on 11 January 1941 and one of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s favourite generals, Erwin Rommel, was designated as commander on 11 February. Originally Hans von Funck was to have commanded it, but Hitler loathed von Funck, as he had been a personal staff officer of Werner von Fritsch until von Fritsch was dismissed in 1938.

The German Armed Forces High Command (&quot;&quot;, OKW) had decided to send a &quot;blocking force&quot; to Italian Libya to support the Italian army. The Italian 10th Army had been routed by the British Commonwealth Western Desert Force in Operation Compass (9 December 1940 – 9 February 1941) and captured at the Battle of Beda Fomm. The German blocking force, commanded by Rommel, at first consisted of a force based only on Panzer Regiment 5, which was put together from the second regiment of the 3rd Panzer Division. These elements were organized into the 5th Light Division when they arrived in Africa from 10 February – 12 March 1941. In late April and into May, the 5th Light Division was joined by elements of 15th Panzer Division, transferred from Italy. At this time, the Afrika Korps consisted of the two divisions, and was subordinated to the Italian chain of command in Africa.

On 15 August 1941, the German 5th Light Division was redesignated 21st Panzer Division, the higher formation of which was still the Afrika Korps. During the summer of 1941, the OKW increased the presence in Africa and created a new headquarters called Panzer Group Africa. On 15 August, the Panzer Group was activated with Rommel in command, and command of the Afrika Korps was turned over to Ludwig Crüwell. The Panzer Group comprised the Afrika Korps, with some additional German units now in North Africa, plus two corps of Italian units. The Panzer Group was, in turn, redesignated as Panzer Army Africa on 30 January 1942.

After the German and Italian defeat in the Second Battle of El Alamein and the Allied landings in Morocco and Algeria (Operation Torch), the OKW once more upgraded the presence in Africa by adding first the XC Army Corps, under Walter Nehring, in Tunisia on 19 November 1942, then an additional 5th Panzer Army on 8 December, under the command of Colonel-General Hans-Jürgen von Arnim.

On 23 February 1943, the original Panzer Army Africa, which had since been re-styled as the German-Italian Panzer Army, was now redesignated as the Italian 1st Army and put under the command of Italian general Giovanni Messe. Rommel, meanwhile, was placed in command of a new Army Group Africa, created to control both the Italian 1st Army and the 5th Panzer Army. The remnants of the Afrika Korps and surviving units of the 1st Italian Army retreated into Tunisia. Command of the Army Group was turned over to Arnim in March. On 13 May, the Afrika Korps surrendered, along with all other remaining Axis forces in North Africa.

Most Afrika Korps prisoners of war (POW) were transported to the United States and held in Camp Shelby in Mississippi, Camp Hearne in Texas and other POW camps until the end of the war.

==Composition and terminology==

When Rommel was promoted to the newly formed Panzer Army Africa, his command included a number of Italian units, including four infantry divisions. Two Italian armoured divisions, Ariete and Trieste, initially remained under Italian control as the Italian XX Motorized Corps under the command of General Gastone Gambara.

The Afrika Korps was restructured and renamed in August 1941. &quot;Afrikakorps&quot; was the official name of the force for less than six months but the officers and men used it for the duration. The Afrikakorps was the major German component of &#x27;, which was later renamed the &#x27; and finally renamed &quot;&quot; (Army Group Africa) during the 27 months of the Desert campaign.

==Treatment of local inhabitants and the Italian colonial government==

The Afrika Korps gained a reputation by the Allies and by many historians as being magnanimous with Allied prisoners of war; since then many historians have used the term &quot;War without hate&quot; to describe the North African campaign as a whole. However, Jewish people suffered during the fascist regime laws, and the local administration took part in the Holocaust deporting some thousands of Jews to Italy, under the supervision of &quot;&quot; Albert Kesselring, Wehrmacht commander of the Axis in the Mediterranean theater. Others suffered from forced labour and ill treatment at the hands of the Italian administration, including a Schutzstaffel and SD detachment. Robert Satloff described in his book &quot;Among the Righteous: Lost Stories from the Holocaust&#x27;s Long Reach into Arab Lands&quot; that as the German and Italian forces retreated across Libya towards Tunisia, the Jewish population became victims upon which they released their anger and frustration. According to Satloff, Afrika Korps soldiers plundered Jewish property all along the Libyan coast. This violence and persecution only came to an end with the arrival of General Montgomery in Tripoli on 23 January 1943. According to Maurice Remy, although there were antisemitic individuals in the Afrika Korps, actual cases of abuse are not known, even against the Jewish soldiers of the Eighth Army. Remy quotes Isaac Levy, the Senior Jewish Chaplain of the Eighth Army, as saying that he had never seen &quot;any sign or hint that the soldiers [of the Afrika Korps] are antisemitic.&quot; &quot;The Telegraph&quot; comments: &quot;Accounts suggest that it was not Field Marshal Erwin Rommel but the ruthless SS-Standartenführer Walter Rauff who stripped Tunisian Jews of their wealth.&quot;

Giordana Terracina writes that: &quot;On April 3, the Italians recaptured Benghazi and a few months later the Afrika Korps led by Rommel was sent to Libya and began the deportation of the Jews of Cyrenaica in the concentration camp of Giado and other smaller towns in Tripolitania. This measure was accompanied by shooting, also in Benghazi, of some Jews guilty of having welcomed the British troops, on their arrival, treating them as liberators.&quot; Gershom states that Italian authorities were responsible for bringing Jews into their concentration camps, which were &quot;not built to exterminate its inmates&quot;, yet as the water and food supply was meager, were not built to keep humans alive either. Also according to Gershom, the German consul in Tripoli knew about the process and trucks used to transport supply to Rommel were sometimes used to transport Jews, despite all problems the German forces were having. The &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot;&#x27;s review of Gershom Gorenberg&#x27;s &quot;War of shadows&quot; writes that: &quot;The Italians were far more brutal with civilians, including Libyan Jews, than Rommel’s Afrika Korps, which by all accounts abided by the laws of war. But nobody worried that the Italians who sent Jews to concentration camps in Libya, would invade British-held Egypt, let alone Mandatory Palestine.&quot;

According to Maurice Roumani, &quot;Libyan Jews noted that in daily matters, the Germans largely acted out of pragmatic economic interest rather than adopting the political and ideological practices known elsewhere. The German authorities found Libyan Jews well equipped with goods they needed for their military activities. The Jews complied with their demands, some out of fear and others out of strict economic interest. By the end of their time in Libya, this strategic economic arrangement led the Germans to perceive the Jews as similar to the native Muslims and they therefore regarded the Jews to be less threatening than their brethren in Europe.&quot;

==Re-forming of units==
Certain divisions were re-formed in Europe after the cessation of fighting in Tunisia:
* 15th Panzer Division (as 15th Panzergrenadier Division in Sicily, Italy and Western Front)
* 21st Panzer Division (in France)
* Hermann Göring Panzer Division (in Sicily and Italy)
* 90th Light Division (as 90th Panzergrenadier Division in Italy)

Wolf is past recipient of the Bronze Medal for radio commentary and the Sigma Delta Chi Award, both from the Society of Professional Journalists.

==Personal life==
Robert Wolf spent his formative years wandering the United States, searching for the &quot;American Soul.&quot; As an adolescent his goal was to &quot;work every job in the country, live in every town and city and have conversations with everyone.&quot;During the 1960s and 70s, Wolf hitchhiked and rode freight trains across country, while seeking out iconic American types. Poets &amp; Writers wrote &quot;he was a ranch hand in New Mexico, a journalist in Chicago, a teacher in an inner-city Brooklyn school and at a penitentiary, as well as a doctoral candidate in philosophy, a dabbler in art, a hitchhiker and hobo.&quot;

==Career==
By 1987, having settled in Chicago, Wolf wrote a weekly column and features for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. In 1988 he married singer and artist Bonnie Koloc and the couple moved to Nashville, where Wolf organized a writing workshop for the homeless. In 1990, Wolf, along with Steven Meinbresse, established Free River Press, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Initially intended as a publishing vehicle for the homeless, Wolf expanded the press&#x27;s mission to &quot;create a collective autobiography of America.

When Wolf and Koloc moved to rural Iowa, Wolf began running writing workshops for neighboring farmers. The workshop resulted in three books published by Free River Press. Since then Wolf has conducted workshops not only throughout the Midwest, but in the Mississippi Delta, the Southwest, and in New York and Chicago.

In 1999, Oxford University Press published &quot;An American Mosaic: Prose and Poetry by Everyday Folk&quot;, selected from the first nine years of Free River Press writings.

His early Iowa experiences led Wolf to begin writing about the ongoing farm and rural crisis and to begin, in 1994, writing about the need for rural America to develop self-reliant, decentralized regional economies.

Free River Press publications have appeared on CBS News Sunday as well as NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot; and &quot;Morning Edition&quot;. Since 2010 Wolf lhas produced a weekly radio program for Free River Press, &quot;American Mosaic&quot;, airing on community stations in a dozen states.

==Education==
Wolf obtained his degrees from Columbia University and the University of Chicago.

<text>Arctium is a genus of biennial plants commonly known as burdock, family Asteraceae. Native to Europe and Asia, several species have been widely introduced worldwide. Burdock&#x27;s clinging properties, in addition to providing an excellent mechanism for seed dispersal, led to the invention of the hook and loop fastener.

==Description==

Plants of the genus &quot;Arctium&quot; have dark green leaves that can grow up to long. They are generally large, coarse, and ovate, with the lower ones being heart-shaped. They are woolly underneath. The leafstalks are generally hollow. &quot;Arctium&quot; species generally flower from July through October. Burdock flowers provide essential pollen and nectar for honeybees around August, when clover is on the wane and before the goldenrod starts to bloom.

Burdock&#x27;s clinging properties make it an excellent mechanism for seed dispersal.

==Taxonomy==
A large number of species have been placed in genus &quot;Arctium&quot; at one time or another, but most of them are now classified in the related genus &quot;Cousinia&quot;. The precise limits between &quot;Arctium&quot; and &quot;Cousinia&quot; are hard to define; there is an exact relation between their molecular phylogeny. The burdocks are sometimes confused with the cockleburs (genus &quot;Xanthium&quot;) and rhubarb (genus &quot;Rheum&quot;).

=== Etymology ===
Circa 16th century, from bur + dock, the latter meaning sorrel of the genus Rumex.

== Ecology ==
The roots of burdock, among other plants, are eaten by the larva of the ghost moth (&quot;Hepialus humuli&quot;). The plant is used as a food plant by other Lepidoptera including brown-tail, &quot;Coleophora paripennella&quot;, &quot;Coleophora peribenanderi&quot;, the Gothic, lime-speck pug and scalloped hazel.

The prickly heads of these plants (burrs) are noted for easily catching on to fur and clothing. In England, some birdwatchers have reported that birds have become entangled in the burrs leading to a slow death, as they are unable to free themselves.

== Toxicity ==
The green, above-ground portions may cause contact dermatitis in individual with allergies as the plant contains lactones.

== Uses ==

=== Food and drink ===

The taproot of young burdock plants can be harvested and eaten as a root vegetable. While generally out of favour in modern European cuisine, it is popular in East Asia. &quot;Arctium lappa&quot; is known as () in Chinese, the same name having been borrowed into Japanese as , and is eaten in Japan, Korea and Taiwan. In Korean, burdock root is called () and sold as (), or &quot;whole burdock&quot;. Plants are cultivated for their slender roots, which can grow up to about one metre long and two centimetres across. Burdock root is very crisp and has a sweet, mild, or pungent flavour with a little muddy harshness that can be reduced by soaking julienned or shredded roots in water for five to ten minutes. The roots have been used as potato substitutes in Russia.

Immature flower stalks may also be harvested in late spring, before flowers appear; their taste resembles that of artichoke, to which the burdock is related. The stalks are thoroughly peeled, and either eaten raw, or boiled in salt water. Leaves are also eaten in spring in Japan when a plant is young and leaves are soft. Some &quot;A. lappa&quot; cultivars are specialized for this purpose. A popular Japanese dish is (), julienned or shredded burdock root and carrot, braised with soy sauce, sugar, mirin and/or sake, and sesame oil. Another is burdock makizushi (sushi filled with pickled burdock root; the burdock root is often artificially coloured orange to resemble a carrot).

In the second half of the 20th century, burdock achieved international recognition for its culinary use due to the increasing popularity of the macrobiotic diet, which advocates its consumption. It contains a fair amount of dietary fiber (GDF, 6 g per 100 g), calcium, potassium, and amino acids, and is low in calories. It contains the prebiotic fiber inulin. It contains a polyphenol oxidase, which causes its darkened surface and muddy harshness by forming tannin-iron complexes. Burdock root&#x27;s harshness harmonizes well with pork in miso soup (tonjiru) and with Japanese-style pilaf (takikomi gohan).

Dandelion and burdock is a soft drink that has long been popular in the United Kingdom; it has its origins in hedgerow mead commonly drunk in the mediæval period. Burdock is believed to be a galactagogue, a substance that increases lactation, but it is sometimes recommended to be avoided during pregnancy based on animal studies that show components of burdock to cause uterus stimulation.

In Europe, burdock root was used as a bittering agent in beer before the widespread adoption of hops for this purpose.

=== Traditional medicine ===
The seeds of &quot;A. lappa&quot; are used in traditional Chinese medicine under the name (; some dictionaries list the Chinese as just ).

Burdock is a traditional medicinal herb used for many ailments. Burdock root oil extract, also called bur oil, is used in Europe as a scalp treatment.

== In culture ==


In Turkish Anatolia, the burdock plant was believed to ward off the evil eye, and as such is often a motif appearing woven into kilims for protection. With its many flowers, the plant also symbolizes abundance. Before and during World War II, Japanese soldiers were issued a 15-1/2-inch bayonet held in a black-painted scabbard, the juken. Their nickname was the burdock sword (&quot;gobo ken&quot;).

Mary Palmer&#x27;s mid 18th century &quot;Devonshire Dialogue&quot; records the burrs of the plant being known in Devon, England, as &quot;bachelor&#x27;s-buttons&quot;.

The English folk artist Nancy Kerr refers to &quot;The Land of Santa Georgia where the Banks of Burdocks Grow&quot; in her song Santa Georgia, supposedly representing the relationship between country and city in modern England (especially Sheffield).

=== Inspiration for velcro ===
After taking his dog for a walk one day in the late 1940s (1948), George de Mestral, a Swiss inventor, became curious about the seeds of the burdock plant that had attached themselves to his clothes and to the dog&#x27;s fur. Under a microscope, he looked closely at the hook system that the seeds use to hitchhike on passing animals aiding seed dispersal, and he realized that the same approach could be used to join other things together. His work led to the development of the hook and loop fastener, which was initially sold under the Velcro brand name.

Serbo-Croatian uses the same word, , for burdock and velcro; Turkish does the same with the name , while in the Polish language means both &quot;burr&quot; and &quot;velcro&quot;. The German word for burdock is and velcro is (= burdock fastener). 
In Norwegian burdock is and velcro , which translates to &quot;burdock lock&quot;.

<doc id="158222" wikidata="Q690789" url="?curid=158222" title="LATAM Airlines Brasil">
<text>LATAM Airlines Brasil, formerly TAM Linhas Aéreas, is the Brazilian brand of LATAM Airlines Group operating international and domestic flights from hubs in Brasília, Fortaleza, and São Paulo. According to the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil (ANAC), between January and December 2023, LATAM had 37.8% of the domestic, and 18.2% of the international market share in terms of passenger-kilometers flown, making it the largest domestic and largest international airline in Brazil.

TAM Linhas Aéreas was Brazil&#x27;s and Latin America&#x27;s largest airline before the takeover by Chilean airline LAN Airlines. Its headquarters were in São Paulo, operating scheduled services to destinations within Brazil, as well as international flights to Europe and other parts of North and South America. Shares in the company were traded on the São Paulo Exchange (BM&amp;F Bovespa) and New York Stock Exchange as &quot;TAM&quot;. Prior to the merger with LAN, the company closed its capital, transferring its shares to LATAM Airlines Group. In August 2015, it was announced that the two airlines would fully rebrand as LATAM, with one livery to be applied on all aircraft by 2018. The airline withdrew from the Star Alliance and joined Oneworld, effective from March 31, 2014. The carrier left Oneworld on May 1, 2020.

The word &quot;TAM&quot; is an acronym for &quot;Transportes Aéreos Marília&quot;, which dates back to the company&#x27;s origins as a regional aviation company founded in Marília, in the state of São Paulo.

==History==
===The Origins: TAM – Táxi Aéreo Marília===

TAM – Táxi Aéreo Marília and TAM – Transportes Aéreos Regionais were two different entities, although both belonged to the TAM Group. TAM – Marília, an air taxi company founded on February 21, 1961 at the city of Marília, provided the start-up infrastructure for TAM – Regionais.

===TAM – Transportes Aéreos Regionais (KK)===
On November 11, 1975, the Government of Brazil created the Brazilian Integrated System of Regional Air Transportation and divided the country in to five different regions, for which five newly created regional airlines received a concession to operate air services. Founded by Rolim Adolfo Amaro, TAM – Transportes Aéreos Regionais S/A was the third of those regional airlines to be made operational. Its services started on July 12, 1976, and its operational area comprised parts of the Southeast and Central West regions of Brazil, specifically the states of Mato Grosso do Sul, and parts of Mato Grosso, and São Paulo plus the possibility of serving the cities of Cuiabá, Rio de Janeiro, Londrina, Maringá, and Brasília when linking them to its area of concession.

TAM – Linhas Aéreas Regionais was formed as a joint-venture between TAM – Táxi Aéreo Marília, and VASP which was then a state-owned airline. The airline received the IATA code KK on October 13, 1999. The new airline flew Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirantes at first, but these proved grossly inadequate for the task at hand, and even at full capacity needed to be subsidized by the government in order to be profitable.

TAM went on to purchase three used Fokker F27 turboprops, which were subsequently refurbished by Fokker in the Netherlands. In order to obtain the import authorization for the aircraft, a deal was struck with the government in which TAM was forced to maintain three Bandeirantes for every F27, as well as removing five seats from each one, bringing the F27&#x27;s capacity down to 40 passengers. A fourth F27, previously owned by Air New Zealand, was added to the TAM fleet in 1981. By 1983, TAM had acquired 10 F27s. By 1981, TAM had flown 1 million passengers, and 2 million by 1984.

===TAM (KK) joint operations with TAM (JJ)===

Under financial stress, the company went public in August 1986, and began floating stock in the market. The same year, TAM – Transportes Aéreos Regionais (KK) acquired another regional airline, VOTEC, which operated in areas of northern and central Brazil. VOTEC was then renamed Brasil Central Linhas Aéreas. TAM and Brasil Central were both regional airlines and operated in different designated areas. They, however, operated as a consortium with integrated networks and fleet, with the most notable differences being the flight number IATA codes (whereas TAM had the IATA code KK, Brasil Central operated with the code JJ inherited from VOTEC), the different color schemes of the aircraft, and their designated areas of operation. In 1988, TAM flew its 3 millionth passenger.

On May 15, 1990, the Brazilian Government lifted restrictions on operational areas of regional airlines allowing them to fly anywhere in Brazil. As a consequence, Brasil Central was renamed &quot;TAM - Transportes Aéreos Meridionais&quot;, acquired the same color scheme of TAM (KK) but maintained the IATA code JJ.

In 2000, TAM (KK) was merged into TAM (JJ) and TAM (JJ) was renamed TAM Transportes Aéreos. The code JJ was maintained and the code KK was released back to IATA.

Despite TAM&#x27;s success in the market, it was evident the airline would not last long when competing against airlines such as Varig and VASP, both of which already possessed Boeing 737s in their fleet. Amaro then tried to buy VASP, which was about to be privatized and called the project &quot;Revolution&quot;. Having lost the bid, he opted for slower growth with the gradual addition of new aircraft, re-dubbed &quot;Evolution&quot;.

===Consolidation of Services===

On September 15, 1989, TAM arranged for the acquisition of two Fokker 100 jets. Like the F27s before them, TAM did not actually purchase these aircraft but used Amaro&#x27;s credibility to arrange for a third-party asset management company, Guinness Peat Aviation, to purchase them and subsequently lease them back to TAM. Two more were added in 1991. In 1992, TAM carried its 8 millionth passenger. By 1993, through the use of the Fokker 100 fleet, which now numbered at 14, TAM was serving 56 cities in Brazil.

In 1996, TAM bought another airline, Helisul Linhas Aéreas, which used the trade name of TAM. In 1997, TAM ordered its first large jets; the airline ordered 45 planes from Airbus, including 10 A330s, 4 A319s, and 34 A320s. In 1997, the Airbuses began to be delivered and the airline flew its first international service from São Paulo to Miami International Airport. In 1998, TAM purchased the passenger division of Itapemirim Transportes Aéreos.

Two years later, in 1999, services to Europe were inaugurated through a code share service with Air France, to Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport. In 2000, the airline was renamed TAM Linhas Aéreas. Long running discussions to merge with Varig ended in 2004. In 2008, TAM transported 30,144,000 passengers, with an average load factor of 71%. As of 2010, the airline is owned by the Amaro family (46.25%), Amaro Aviation Part (3.52%), treasury stocks (0.27%), and minority shareholders (49.96%). It employed 24,000 staff. On May 13, 2010, TAM became the 27th member of Star Alliance. David Barioni served as the airline&#x27;s president from 2007 to 2009.

In 2009, TAM decided to replace its Passenger Service System provided by Sabre, known as Sabresonic, with the Altéa platform from Amadeus. The migration to Altéa was completed in the first quarter of 2010.

On March 30, 2011, TAM signed a letter of intentions to purchase up to 31% of the shares of TRIP Linhas Aéreas, a regional airline which code-shares with TAM since 2004. A final decision had however been postponed; and finally, in February 2012, the purchase agreement was not renewed. On May 28, 2012, TRIP was sold to Azul Brazilian Airlines. Code-sharing operations ended on March 28, 2013.

On December 21, 2009, TAM Linhas Aéreas purchased Pantanal Linhas Aéreas. At that time, TAM decided to maintain Pantanal as a separate airline within the TAM Group integrated into the network of TAM. Starting August 1, 2011, Pantanal operated flights on behalf of TAM, all with origin and destination at São-Paulo-Congonhas Airport. On March 26, 2013, Brazilian authorities approved the incorporation of all Pantanal assets by TAM and Pantanal ceased to exist. The incorporation process was completed on August 23, 2013.

In January 2013, the Jet Airliner Crash Data Evaluation Centre (JACDEC) determined that TAM Linhas Aéreas had the second-worst safety record in the world. The ratings take into account the number and deadliness of the hull losses (destroyed airplanes) they have suffered in the past 30 years, how they have fared more recently, and how many flights they have flown without incident. The results do not take into account the cause of the hull losses, or whether the airline is at fault, so they are not a perfect measure of how safely an airline behaves.

===The creation of LATAM Airlines Group===

On August 13, 2010, TAM signed a non-binding agreement with Chilean airline LAN Airlines to merge and create LATAM Airlines Group. This was changed into a binding agreement on January 19, 2011. LATAM&#x27;s agreement was approved with 11 restrictions by Chilean authorities on September 21, 2011. These included transferring four slots at São Paulo-Guarulhos to competitors interested in operating flights to Santiago de Chile, renouncing membership to either Oneworld or Star Alliance, restricting increase capacity on flights between Brazil and Chile, and opening code-share possibilities and fidelity program membership to interested competitors. On December 14, 2011, Brazilian authorities approved the agreement imposing similar restrictions as Chilean authorities. By August 2012, LATAM made a decision in favor of Oneworld and frequencies between São Paulo and Santiago de Chile were reduced: TAM had two pairs of slots while LAN had four. LAN ceded two pairs to competitors interested in using them which later was known to be Sky Airline. The merger was completed on June 22, 2012. As of May 5, 2016 TAM adopted the name LATAM. It still continues to use the &quot;TAM&quot; name as a call sign for its LATAM Brasil operated flights.

On July 9, 2020, LATAM Brasil announced that it filed for judicial reorganization in the United States due to the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on the company&#x27;s operations. The LATAM Airlines group and its affiliates had already entered the debt restructuring process in May of the same year under the protection of Chapter 11 of the United States bankruptcy law, which allows a deadline for companies to reorganize themselves financially. Despite the announcement, the company continues to operate normally.

===Subsidiary: LATAM Paraguay===

In 1994, TAM Linhas Aéreas established a small subsidiary airline in Paraguay called Aerolíneas Paraguayas with a fleet consisting mostly of the Cessna 208 Caravans, formerly operated by TAM. On September 1, 1996, TAM via ARPA, purchased 80% of the shares of the former state-owned Líneas Aéreas Paraguayas and merged it with ARPA. The new airline was named &quot;TAM – Transportes Aéreos del Mercosur&quot; and maintained the IATA code of LAP, PZ. TAM owned 94.98% and the Paraguayan government 5.02% of the shares.

In 2008, following a branding strategy, the name TAM Mercosur was dropped and the airline adopted an identical corporate identity of TAM Airlines. However, its corporate structure remained the same. The airline was informally known as TAM Paraguay, and used the IATA code PZ. In 2016, the airline was rebranded to LATAM Paraguay, at the same time as all other airlines of the LATAM group.

==Destinations==
The network of LATAM Brasil and LATAM Paraguay covers Brazil, Paraguay, Africa, Europe, North and South America.&lt;br&gt; 
As of January 2024, LATAM Brasil (formerly &quot;TAM Linhas Aéreas&quot;) operates scheduled services to the destinations below. The list includes destinations formerly served by its subsidiaries, Pantanal Linhas Aéreas and TAM Paraguay:

===Fleet development===
On June 16, 2005, TAM purchased 20 additional Airbus A320 family aircraft (including the A319, A320 and A321), with an additional 20 options. These were expected to be delivered between late 2007 and 2010, adding to the already scheduled delivery of 6 A320s between 2006 and 2008. At the same time, the company signed a memorandum of understanding with Airbus stating its intent to buy 10 of the new Airbus A350-900 plus 5 options, with deliveries planned due to commence at the end of 2014. However, LATAM received its first A350 in early 2016.

TAM has also signed a firm contract with Airbus to acquire 37 additional aircraft. The order comprises 12 A319s, 16 A320s, 3 A321s and 3 A330s and includes 12 unspecified extra options. This would bring the number of aircraft in TAM&#x27;s fleet acquired directly from Airbus to 115 aircraft. The commitments are separate from deals in earlier years for 29 firm-ordered A320s and 20 options. The deliveries were concluded by 2010. In 2013, TAM announced that it would phased out three of the oldest Boeing 767 it operates; however, it later changed plans and decided to keep the aircraft, adding some more aircraft from LAN Airlines instead. They replaced the A330-200s. TAM also received the first aircraft of the A320 family with Sharklets in April 2013.

Fleet maintenance is partially conducted at the technology center at São Carlos Airport.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On February 8, 1979, an Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante (PT-SBB) operating a flight from Bauru to São Paulo-Congonhas, while on initial climb from Bauru, struck trees and crashed into flames. Two crew and 16 passengers died.
*On October 7, 1983, an Embraer EMB 110C Bandeirante (PP-SBH) flying from Campo Grande and Urubupungá to Araçatuba struck the ground just short of the runway threshold after missing the approach at Araçatuba Airport twice. Seven crew and passengers died.
*On June 28, 1984, an Embraer EMB 110C Bandeirante (PP-SBC) operating a chartered flight by Petrobras from Rio de Janeiro-Galeão to Macaé flew into São João Hill while descending through rain and clouds over the Municipality of São Pedro da Aldeia. All 16 passengers and 2 crew died. The passengers were journalists of well-known Brazilian networks who were preparing a special report about the Campos Basin oil fields.
*On February 12, 1990, a Fokker F27 (PT-LCG) operating a flight from São Paulo-Congonhas to Bauru, due to faulty approach procedures, touched down at Bauru past the runway threshold. The pilot was unable to initiate a go-around procedure and went past the end of the runway, hitting a car that was passing on a road nearby. One crew member and two occupants of the car died.
*On October 31, 1996, a Fokker 100 (PT-MRK) and operating as Flight 402 from São Paulo-Congonhas to Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont crashed into an urban area during takeoff procedures and after engine no. 2 suffering at least three uncommanded reverse thrust deployments and thus losing power, stalled, rolled to the right and struck two buildings. All 95 passengers and crew on board and 4 people on the ground died.
*On July 9, 1997, a Fokker 100 that was on a daily route between Vitória and São Paulo, with a stopover in São José dos Campos, suffered a sudden explosion between seats 18 and 20, which opened a hole in its fuselage and threw engineer Fernando Caldeira de Moura Campos out of the plane. The passenger fell from a height of , at a speed of , creating a diameter fault in the ground, in a cassava plantation in the city of Suzano, where he was found. According to the cadaveric report, despite the explosion, it is very likely that Fernando arrived alive and lucid to the ground. Days later, the Federal Police of Brazil indicted unemployed professor Leonardo Teodoro de Castro, who was also traveling on the aircraft, as the author of the explosion. Leonardo, however, could not be judged for what happened, because days after the explosion he was run over by a bus and is in a vegetative state.
*On September 15, 2001, a Fokker 100 (PT-MRN) operating the charter Flight 9755, flying from Recife to São Paulo-Congonhas via Campinas-Viracopos, following an uncontrolled engine failure en route to Campinas, had three cabin windows shattered by fragments of the engine and made an emergency landing at Belo Horizonte-Confins. One passenger was sucked out partly and held by another passenger until the aircraft landed. The passenger did not survive.
*On July 17, 2007, an Airbus A320-200 (PR-MBK) operating Flight 3054 from Porto Alegre to São Paulo-Congonhas overran the runway while landing at Congonhas, crossed a major thoroughfare and impacted against a TAM Express warehouse. All 187 passengers and crew perished, as did 12 people on the ground.
* On September 28, 2018, an empty Airbus A320 (PT-MZJ) of more than 18 years old, got off the pusher truck during towing at the São Paulo-Congonhas and the rear hit a palm and other trees. The palm crushed the right rear wing.
*On December 20, 2018, a Boeing 777-300ER (PT-MUG) operating as LA8084 from São Paulo-Guarulhos to London Heathrow suffered a serious electrical fault inflight, subsequently diverting to Belo Horizonte International Airport. There were no reported injuries or fatalities. The aircraft was repaired and returned to service.
*On July 9, 2024, a Boeing 777-300ER with 398 people on board operating as Flight 8073, sustained a tailstrike while attempting to take off from Milan-Malpensa Airport in Italy. There were no fatalities or injuries reported, but the aircraft received significant damage. The aircraft returned back to its origin airport. The takeoff performance calculation by the pilots resulted in a V1 speed of 145 knots and a VR speed of 149 knots. Thirty-eight seconds after commencing the takeoff roll, the nose lifted at a speed of 151 knots. The aircraft failed to rotate and five seconds later a &quot;tail strike&quot; warning was generated in the cockpit. The aircraft finally lifted off the runway at 180 knots. In a preliminary report ANSV stated that erroneous takeoff parameters were used to calculate the takeoff speeds. VR was in fact 181 knots, not 149. Runway 35L, which was the runway it took off from, was closed for inspection as a result of the accident.

<doc id="158224" wikidata="Q3337819" url="?curid=158224" title="Neil Hamilton (politician)">
<text>Mostyn Neil Hamilton (born 9 March 1949) is a British politician and former barrister who was leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) from 2020 to 2024. He was the Conservative member of parliament (MP) for Tatton from 1983 to 1997 and a UKIP Member of the Senedd (MS) for Mid and West Wales from 2016 to 2021.

Hamilton was elected to the House of Commons in the 1983 general election. He was appointed parliamentary under-secretary of state for corporate affairs by the prime minister, John Major, in 1992.

In 1994, &quot;The Guardian&quot; alleged that Hamilton had taken cash payments in exchange for asking questions in Parliament. Hamilton sued &quot;The Guardian&quot; for libel, but settled on the day of the trial. &quot;The Guardian&quot; published a headline branding him &quot;A Liar and a Cheat&quot;. The cash-for-questions affair enquiry in 1997 found that Hamilton had taken bribes. He subsequently lost a libel case on the matter. Hamilton became widely associated with sleaze, and was forced to resign his ministerial role. He was defeated by an independent candidate, Martin Bell, in the 1997 general election.

Hamilton left the Conservative Party in 2002 and joined UKIP. In 2011, he returned to politics and was elected to the national executive committee of UKIP. Following his election to the National Assembly for Wales, he was UKIP&#x27;s assembly group leader from 2016 to 2018 and again from 2019 to 2021. He became leader of UKIP Wales in 2016. In September 2020, Hamilton was named acting leader of UKIP, following the suspension from the party of the previous leader, Freddy Vachha. Hamilton was defeated at the 2021 Senedd election. In October 2021, Hamilton was elected UKIP leader and served until May 2024.

==Early life==
Hamilton was born in Fleur-de-Lis, a Gwent pit village near Blackwood, Wales. In 1960 he moved to Ammanford. His father was a chief engineer for the National Coal Board. His grandfathers were coal miners. He grew up in Ammanford in Carmarthenshire and joined the Conservative Party in 1964, at the age of 15.

===Education===
Hamilton attended Amman Valley Grammar School in Ammanford. He received a BScEcon degree in economics and politics from the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth in 1970, and an MScEcon degree in economics and politics in 1975. While at Aberystwyth, he was active in the Federation of Conservative Students; he was a member between 1968 and 1974. In 1973, as a representative of the Federation of Conservative Students, Hamilton attended a conference of the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI). Hamilton went on to study at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he attained a postgraduate law degree.

===Student activity and early political career===
At the 1970 Conservative Party conference, Hamilton called for mass privatisation. The following year, he opposed the plan for Britain to join the European Communities. In 1972, after several years&#x27; membership, Hamilton was elected to the executive council of the Conservative Monday Club. He left the Club in 1973, and stood as chairman of the Federation of Conservative Students against David Davis, but lost. In the early 1970s, Hamilton was the founder of the Eldon League, a right-wing social organisation given to having picnics and dinners &#x27;and having a good time&#x27;. He appointed himself its &quot;Grand Imperial Prior&quot; and called for the abolition of the internal combustion engine and plastic. Hamilton stood as the Conservative parliamentary candidate in the February 1974 general election in Abertillery and in the 1979 general election in Bradford North, but failed on both occasions.

===Teaching===
Hamilton was a teacher at St John&#x27;s College in Southsea between 1973 and 1976. In his spare time he studied for his bar practice exam. He also taught constitutional law at Hatfield Polytechnic between September 1978 and July 1982.

===Legal career===
From September 1979, Hamilton practised as a barrister. He specialised in taxation, trust and property law. However, after he lost his parliamentary seat in 1997, he vowed never to return to &quot;that constipated profession&quot;. In April 2001, Hamilton said, &quot;If I am bankrupt [which he was the following month], I won&#x27;t be able to return to the bar but even if I was able to do so, I couldn&#x27;t contain myself from saying what I thought to some of the judges.&quot; Hamilton was also European and Parliamentary Affairs Director of the Institute of Directors during this time.

==Political career==
===Parliamentary career===
On 12 March 1983, Hamilton was selected as the Conservative candidate for the newly created Tatton constituency. Three months later, at the 1983 general election Hamilton was elected to Parliament as MP for Tatton. On entering the Commons, Hamilton was appointed as an officer of the backbench committee on Trade and Industry under the chairmanship of Michael Grylls.

====Leaded petrol====
In 1984, against party policy, Hamilton opposed the abandonment of leaded petrol in Britain. He argued there was no evidence that leaded petrol was damaging the environment, or health, and that jobs would be lost in his constituency if leaded petrol was banned.

====Western Goals Institute====
Hamilton resumed his activities as a supporter of pressure groups, including the Western Goals Institute, led by ex-Young Monday Club Chairman, Andrew V. R. Smith and attracting the support of other parliamentarians such as Sir Patrick Wall, Bill Walker, Nicholas Winterton and the Revd. Martin Smyth. He was on their parliamentary advisory board. The Western Goals Institute achieved notoriety by inviting Jean-Marie Le Pen (leader of the French National Front) and Alessandra Mussolini (Benito Mussolini&#x27;s granddaughter, a Deputy sitting for the Italian neo-fascist MSI) to address fringe meetings at the 1992 Conservative Party conference. The Party Chairman Sir Norman Fowler was outraged, and said the Conservative Party was not related to the Western Goals Institute. In the event the meetings were cancelled, as neither Le Pen nor Mussolini could come to Britain.

Hamilton also lent his support to the No Turning Back Group organised by his friend Michael Brown MP. Other MPs active in the No Turning Back Group included Michael Portillo, Peter Lilley, Alan Duncan and Gerald Howarth.

====Ian Greer Associates====
In 1985, he began working for Ian Greer Associates, lobbying on behalf of US Tobacco. Hamilton, together with Michael Brown, became an enthusiastic supporter of US Tobacco&#x27;s product Skoal Bandits, a tea-bag type of pouch of tobacco designed for chewing. The product was believed to cause serious risk of oral cancer, particularly for minors, and the government was inclined to ban its import. Hamilton said he supported the introduction of Skoal Bandits on libertarian grounds, and lobbied ministers (including Edwina Currie and David Mellor) to allow its introduction. The House of Commons Select Committee on Standards investigation stated: &quot;Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Brown had a number of contacts with Ministers and officials as part of their campaign to influence Government policy on Skoal Bandits&quot; and said that there was &quot;no evidence ... that any appropriate declaration was made&quot;. Hamilton was obliged to concede he had been wrong to make no reference to the payment &quot;when I went on those meetings with Ministers&quot;.

====Strategy Network International====
In June 1990, Hamilton was recruited by the right-wing Monday Club activist Derek Laud to work for Strategy Network International, a firm specifically created to lobby against anti-apartheid movements and economic sanctions and for apartheid South Africa&#x27;s &#x27;transitional government&#x27; of Namibia set up in defiance of UN Resolution 435 on Namibian independence. Derek Laud was an ex-Monday Club activist and protégé of Hamilton&#x27;s friend Michael Brown, who offered Hamilton a fee of £8,000 per year. Hamilton failed to register the paid-for consultancy. Hamilton took free trips to South Africa in the company of Brown.

====Thatcher leadership contest====
Thatcher appointed Hamilton a whip in July 1990. In November 1990, Michael Heseltine initiated a leadership challenge to Margaret Thatcher. Hamilton was told by the Chief Whip to stay neutral, but says he ignored this instruction. &quot;I naturally ignored this advice and fed all my intelligence into her campaign.&quot; He also said that he made the fateful suggestion that she interview each cabinet member individually, believing they would lack the resolve to tell her to her face that she must go. &quot;Unfortunately, I had miscalculated.&quot; Hamilton strongly encouraged Thatcher to persist. At a meeting where Peter Lilley argued that Thatcher could not survive, Hamilton subjected him to a barrage of &quot;sarcasm and heckling&quot;. On 21 November 1990, Hamilton and like-minded colleagues met Thatcher at Downing Street. Thatcher did subsequently resign, and in the next round of the election Hamilton voted for John Major.

====Minister in Major Government====
From 1992 to 1994, Hamilton was the Minister for Deregulation and Corporate Affairs in John Major&#x27;s government. He came under pressure to step down after the resignation of another minister, Tim Smith, on 19 October 1994, after Smith had admitted to taking money in the cash-for-questions affair. Facing the same allegations, Hamilton denied them and issued proceedings for libel, but he resigned on 26 October at the insistence of John Major.

===Approach to the Maastricht Treaty===
Denmark rejected the Maastricht Treaty on 2 June 1992. Like some other Conservative ministers, Hamilton had also opposed the treaty and was a member of the Eurosceptic &quot;No Turning Back&quot; group. Despite this, Hamilton remained, for a time, loyal to the Major government which endorsed the treaty. Hamilton urged his colleagues not to resign over the Treaty and other issues.

No longer a minister at the time of the 1995 Conservative Party leadership election, Hamilton did not support Major. Initially a supporter of Michael Portillo, when Portillo did not contest the leadership Hamilton voted instead for John Redwood. Hamilton also sent condolences to Portillo in 2001, when he failed to win that year&#x27;s leadership election.

===Loss of Tatton===
Prior to the 1997 general election, Hamilton determined to try to retain his parliamentary seat. His majority at the 1992 general election had been almost 16,000 votes. In 1997, Tatton was the fourth safest Conservative seat in Britain. Hamilton was under investigation by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner as part of the &quot;cash for questions&quot; enquiry and some party members thought he should stand down after the collapse of his case against &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Disquiet in the local association became public, but the majority gave him the benefit of the doubt.
Hamilton resisted the pressure from senior Conservatives and Conservative Central Office to stand down. Jeremy Paxman states that Conservative Central Office &quot;begged him not to stand, but in a gesture of overweening arrogance, he refused to go quietly.&quot;
On 8 April 1997, Hamilton was chosen as the Conservative candidate for Tatton (182 for, 35 against, 100 abstained). &quot;The Observer&quot; commissioned ICM polls in the constituencies of the three Conservative candidates tainted by scandal and seeking re-election: Hamilton, Allan Stewart and Piers Merchant. Both Stewart and Merchant were found to have support consistent with their party&#x27;s standing, but in Tatton &quot;there was massive hostility to Hamilton&quot;.

When Martin Bell, the BBC war correspondent, announced he would stand as an independent candidate in Tatton, the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates for the area stood down in order to give Bell a clear run against Hamilton. Bell defeated Hamilton, winning by a majority of over 11,000 votes with a swing of 48%. Although Hamilton vowed to return to parliament, this defeat marked the end of his political career in the Conservative Party. In March 1999, George Osborne was selected by the Tatton Conservative Association to be their candidate for the following general election.

===William Hague&#x27;s leadership===
Following Hamilton&#x27;s ejection from Tatton and the Conservative defeat in the 1997 election, the new party leader, William Hague, sought to distance the Conservative Party from the disgraced Hamilton and asked Hamilton to stay away from the party conference.

===UK Independence Party===
In September 2011, Hamilton attended the annual conference of the UK Independence Party (UKIP). The party&#x27;s leader Nigel Farage pledged to support him in the election for the National Executive Committee. Hamilton was elected to the committee on 1 November 2011. He later become deputy chairman of the party. Hamilton was demoted from his role as campaign director in April 2014. In the May 2014 local elections, he stood as a UKIP candidate in the St Mary&#x27;s Park ward of Wandsworth London Borough Council and finished 8th of the 9 candidates with 396 votes.
====Member of the Senedd====
In the 2016 National Assembly for Wales election, Hamilton ran as UKIP&#x27;s candidate for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, receiving 3,474 votes (11.7%).
He also stood as the lead candidate in the Mid and West Wales Region, becoming one of seven UKIP candidates to win a seat through the Regional List system. 

On 10 May 2016, UKIP&#x27;s AMs voted him their leader in the Welsh Assembly, defeating Nathan Gill. The UKIP leader, Nigel Farage, criticised the move as an &quot;unjust act of deep ingratitude&quot;. Hamilton dismissed Farage&#x27;s criticism as &quot;irrelevant&quot;, accused him of &quot;throwing toys out of pram&quot; and referred to him as &quot;the MEP for the South East of England&quot;. 
During his maiden speech in the Welsh Assembly, he was accused of making sexist remarks towards female politicians after referring to Kirsty Williams and Leanne Wood as &quot;concubines&quot; in a &quot;harem&quot;.

In leaked emails, he was accused by UKIP&#x27;s biggest donor, Arron Banks, of being a &quot;corrupt old Tory&quot;. Nathan Gill subsequently left the UKIP group in the assembly to sit as an independent, resulting in Neil Hamilton becoming UKIP&#x27;s Leader in Wales in September 2016. 

Hamilton caused further controversy during a debate on the effects of Brexit in Wales. When Eluned Morgan claimed that the economic consequences of Brexit would be hardest for those who could least afford it, Hamilton remarked that &quot;suicide&#x27;s an option&quot;. He was instructed by the presiding officer to apologise for the remark. Hamilton initially refused, saying, &quot;What is there to apologise for?&quot; and &quot;What was unparliamentary about the remark?&quot; He did eventually apologise, saying, &quot;I apologise for whatever remark I am supposed to have made.&quot;

At the 2017 general election, he received 985 votes (2.4%) in Carmarthen East and Dinefwr.

In April 2018, Hamilton said that &quot;the idea that Enoch Powell was some kind of uniquely racist villain is absolute nonsense&quot;. Commenting on Powell&#x27;s &#x27;Rivers of Blood&#x27; speech about mass immigration, Hamilton said that Powell was wrong about predicting racial violence, but had been &quot;proved right by events&quot; in terms of social change that was &quot;never desired by the majority of the British people&quot;. Hamilton said that Powell &quot;changed politics by articulating the fears and resentments of millions and millions of people who are being ignored by the establishment&quot;. In response, the leader of Plaid Cymru, Leanne Wood, accused Hamilton of &quot;keeping Powell&#x27;s racist rhetoric going&quot;. Labour AM Hefin David described Hamilton&#x27;s comments as &quot;outrageous&quot;.

Hamilton was ousted as leader of UKIP in the National Assembly on 17 May 2018 and was replaced by Caroline Jones.
In August 2018, UKIP leader Gerard Batten MEP announced that there would be a membership ballot for the leadership of UKIP in Wales. The eventual winner would become the UKIP Assembly Group Leader and ultimately the party&#x27;s main spokesperson for Wales. Hamilton, Jones and another UKIP Assembly Member in Wales, Gareth Bennett, stood in the election, which was won by Bennett. Hamilton said he could &quot;happily&quot; work with Mr Bennett, but Jones said she had &quot;a lot of thinking to do&quot;. Batten said he expected his Welsh Assembly members to now &quot;work together for UKIP&#x27;s cause and get on with the job.&quot;

In April 2019, Hamilton was the UKIP candidate in the by-election for Newport West. He came third behind the Labour and Conservative candidates with 2,023 votes (8.6%).

Hamilton was the only MS not to live in Wales. By 2021 he was UKIP&#x27;s only representative at any level above local government.

On 12 September 2020, he was appointed acting leader, replacing Freddy Vachha.

In the 2021 Senedd election Hamilton moved to the South Wales East region. He criticised BBC Wales for excluding UKIP from the main leaders&#x27; debates, with Hamilton instead being invited to a separate debate alongside Reform UK and the Wales Green Party. Hamilton contested the constituency of Islwyn but came sixth with just 507 votes. He was also top of the UKIP list for that region but was not appointed as an additional member either. Meanwhile the party lost all its other Senedd seats.

====UKIP leader====
After a period as acting leader, Hamilton was elected as leader in October 2021, receiving 498 out of 631 votes cast (78.9%) against challenger John Poynton.

In December 2023, the anti-racism magazine, &quot;Searchlight&quot;, reported that Hamilton would step down as UKIP leader in 2024 in order to spend more time with his family. Following the election of Lois Perry as UKIP leader in May 2024, he was appointed honorary president of the party.

==Legal cases==
===BBC libel case (1984–1986)===
On 30 January 1984, a &quot;Panorama&quot; programme, &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Militant Tendency&quot;, was broadcast. The programme made a number of allegations regarding Hamilton&#x27;s past and more recent activities. These included his attending and giving a fraternal speech in 1972 to the Italian Social Movement (MSI), an Italian neo-fascist party led by one of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s ex-ministers, Giorgio Almirante, Hamilton&#x27;s membership of the Eldon League, and his involvement with the Powellite faction of the Monday Club and the far-right activist, George Kennedy Young, the former Deputy Director of MI6 and Chairman of the Society for Individual Freedom. The programme also made the claim that Hamilton gave a Nazi salute in Berlin while &quot;messing around&quot; on a parliamentary visit in August 1983. A Nazi salute is a criminal offence in the Federal Republic of Germany. In October 1986, Hamilton and his fellow MP Gerald Howarth (one of his closest friends), sued the BBC for libel along with Phil Pedley, a former chairman of the National Young Conservatives, who had appeared on the programme. &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper highlighted Hamilton&#x27;s admission in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in an article he wrote after the court case that he did give &quot;a little salute with two fingers to his nose to give the impression of a toothbrush moustache.&quot;

The prosecution was financed by Sir James Goldsmith and Taki, &quot;The Spectator&quot; columnist. David Davis, then a director of Tate and Lyle, persuaded that company to donate a sum to the cause. Lord Harris of High Cross (who helped to finance Hamilton&#x27;s failed libel action against Mohammed Al-Fayed 13 years later), also raised approximately £100,000.

During the case, Hamilton said he saw himself as being &quot;the Mike Yarwood of the Federation of Conservative Students&quot; and that he frequently did impressions of public figures such as Frankie Howerd, Harold Wilson, Edward Heath, Charles De Gaulle and Enoch Powell. Hamilton said he had coloured himself black in 1982 to look like Idi Amin and dressed as Canon James Owen on a boat on the River Cam. He said he would have twenty character witnesses: &quot;My main character witness was going to be Norman St John Stevas.&quot; In a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; article, Hamilton denied there was any malicious intent behind the salute. He also pointed out that one person present at the incident, Julian Lewis, was a Jew and that a &quot;number of his relatives were killed by the Nazis during the war&quot;.

====BBC collapse====
In mid-trial and without cross-examining Hamilton, the BBC capitulated on 21 October 1986. The Director-General, Alasdair Milne, stated he was instructed to do so by the Governors of the BBC. The corporation was directed to pay the men&#x27;s legal costs. Hamilton and Howarth were awarded £20,000 each and in the next edition of &quot;Panorama&quot;, on 27 October, the BBC made an unreserved apology. The settlement of the case raised serious concerns regarding political pressure and the intimidation of witnesses. Before the BBC defence lawyers had an opportunity to interrogate Hamilton, the Board of Governors met during the trial and instructed the BBC Board of Management to settle the case: &quot;the BBC executives at this meeting expressed serious doubts about the decision. It was pointed out the BBC had not even begun to put its case&quot;.

The National Young Conservatives hinted at a stitch-up at the BBC. The chairman, Richard Fuller, told the Eastern Area Young Conservatives: &quot;I find it strange that they have apparently decided to settle now, when things appeared to be going well.&quot; Attention focussed on the actions of Malcolm McAlpine, a cousin of Alistair McAlpine the treasurer of the Conservative Party: &quot;He denied yesterday that he had promised Mr Hamilton that he could &#x27;deliver&#x27; the governors behind a settlement&quot;.

====Witness allegations====
In the immediate aftermath of the BBC settlement, allegations of witness intimidation abounded. A BBC internal memorandum to the Board of Management claimed some 17 witnesses had been intimidated into changing their testimony. A BBC source stated: &quot;Nearly all the defence witnesses have had a quiet word in their ears. Only two or three people connected with Tory politics who would have given vital evidence for us now stick to their testimony. Some previously expressed disgust at incidents they had witnessed. Now they claim to have witnessed nothing.&quot;

Howarth and Hamilton said the case against Pedley would not be dropped and Pedley said he would not be joining the BBC decision. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported, &quot;A solicitor for Mr Hamilton and Mr Howarth said later that their linked libel action against Mr Philip Pedley... would continue. Mr Pedley indicated that he intends to continue the case.&quot;

The media began to focus on the remaining unsettled case. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that &quot;The spotlight had swivelled to Phil Pedley, the Tory defendant who remained adamant he would fight on alone, backed by independent funds and, he claims, a wide range of Conservative supporters.&quot; Pedley did not name the supporters but the then chairman of the Young Conservatives, Richard Fuller, pledged financial support to the fight and in a meeting with Jeffrey Archer, Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party, Fuller resisted Archer&#x27;s demand to back down.

Labour accused Conservative Central Office of organising a cover-up over claims that Hamilton had given a Nazi salute on a visit to Berlin and sought to question the then party chairman, Norman Tebbit. Dale Campbell-Savours claimed he had evidence in the form of a letter from Pedley to the former Party Chairman, John Selwyn Gummer, demonstrating Conservative Central Office (CCO) had contacted witnesses. Tebbit confirmed one witness had been in touch with CCO. &quot;I am aware that one potential witness sought advice from Central Office but was told that no advice could be given...&quot; Tebbit accused Campbell-Savours of making his accusations behind the cloak of parliamentary privilege and left the chamber to make his reply. &quot;My staff are appalled and disgusted. They are filled with contempt for a man who can make these sort of accusations of a criminal offence against a member of staff, who, Mr Campbell-Savours knows damn well, is not guilty of it.&quot;

On 25 October, the press reported new evidence of inappropriate witness contact. Later that day, Hamilton announced that he was dropping the action against Pedley. However, Pedley reaffirmed that he &quot;had no intention of withdrawing from the case.&quot; Hamilton&#x27;s announcement failed to quell demands for an enquiry and Campbell-Savours denounced Tebbit&#x27;s tactic of making his statements outside the House of Commons chamber, accusing him of &quot;a deliberate ploy to avoid placing himself in contempt by misleading the House in a personal statement&quot;. He invited Tebbit to make a statement in the House.&quot;If he refuses, then the country will know that a conspiracy of silence is being engineered by senior figures to hide the truth.&quot; More information appeared in the press alleging witness interference, including the Hogan Memorandum, the internal BBC document listing the witnesses who had changed their account. &quot;The Independent&quot; revealed the existence of a taped conversation of a Tory witness being &quot;shaken rigid&quot; by Central Office&#x27;s suggestion that the Berlin events had not happened and &quot;no other witness would substantiate or give evidence about those alleged incidents&quot; and the witness was told no other witness would back his account. The witness said, &quot;this was like a bad dream.&quot;

Campbell-Savours claimed this was proof of BBC nobbling and announced that he was sending his evidence to Sir Michael Havers, the Attorney General. In the Commons, Campbell-Savours stated: &quot;Central Office set about an elaborate attempt to interfere directly with potential witnesses. Attempts were made to manage and rig statements by Mr. David Mitchell. I repeat what I have said previously, but additionally I am able to say today that there is a tape in existence that confirms the nature of the conspiracy to hide the truth, and which identifies persons. Today I have sent a transcript of that tape to the Attorney-General. I have to inform you, Mr. Speaker, that it is but one of two tapes. I await a transcript of the second tape.&quot;

====Statement contradictions====
Press interest turned to Hamilton&#x27;s past statements about the Berlin visit, over which Tory witnesses were alleged to have been pressured to say that they had not seen goose-stepping or Nazi-style salutes. Hamilton had given a categorical denial he had made a Nazi salute in Berlin to John Selwyn Gummer, the Party Chairman, in January 1984:

:&quot;Dear John... I make it absolutely clear that, whilst in Berlin, I did not do any goose-stepping nor did I at any time give Nazi salutes. Indeed, I have always thought the latter was a criminal offence in the Federal Republic.&quot;

Writing in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, Hamilton admitted making &quot;a little salute&quot; in the Reichstag. Hamilton&#x27;s admission had the effect of reaffirming the testimony of the two witnesses who alleged he had given a Nazi salute in Berlin and exposing those witnesses who had reversed their position.

====Dropping of libel action against the Young Conservatives====
Hamilton and Howarth reversed their earlier position and dropped their libel action against Pedley. They said that extracting an apology from Pedley was not &quot;worth the bother&quot;. On 3 December 1986, Pedley refused the offered settlement terms and asked for a hearing in open court. Justice Simon Brown ruled that Hamilton and Howarth be debarred from alleging Pedley&#x27;s words were libel and should pay Pedley&#x27;s costs.

Pedley made a statement from the steps to say he stood by his words in the &quot;Panorama&quot; programme and restated he had never said the MPs were Nazis, rather their behaviour was part of a pattern that would harm the Party and in the case of Hamilton&#x27;s Berlin behaviour, the Final YC Report accused Hamilton of &quot;batty eccentricity&quot;. On the more substantive allegations, Pedley said he reiterated the points made in the YC Report had been called into question.&quot;I consider I have the responsibility to vindicate the good work done by the members of that committee. Several have endured abuse and hate mail following publication of their names in the Young National Front paper Bulldog and other extremist papers. I hope this will now cease, together with set-ups and the surveillance and harassment of other witnesses; in my case by private security companies.&quot;

In December 1986, Hamilton was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to David Mitchell.

===Cash-for-questions===

On 20 October 1994, &quot;The Guardian&quot; published an article which claimed that Hamilton and another MP, Tim Smith, had received money, in the form of cash in brown envelopes. It claimed the money was paid to the men by Mohamed Al-Fayed, the owner of Harrods. In return, the men were to ask questions on behalf of Al-Fayed in the House of Commons. Smith admitted his guilt and resigned immediately. Hamilton claimed innocence but was forced to resign five days later, on 25 October 1994.

====Libel action against &quot;The Guardian&quot;====
Hamilton brought legal action for libel against &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Hamilton joined Ian Greer, a parliamentary lobbyist, as a co-plaintiff. In the process, the Bill of Rights 1689 was amended by the Defamation Act 1996 to allow statements made in Parliament to be questioned in court.

On 30 September 1996, the day before the start of the trial, Hamilton and Greer settled, citing a conflict of interest and lack of funds. &quot;The Guardian&quot; greeted the Hamilton collapse with the headline &quot;A Liar and a Cheat&quot;. Alan Rusbridger, editor of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, said: &quot;The decision by Neil Hamilton and Ian Greer must be one of the most astonishing legal cave-ins in the history of the law of libel&quot; and called for the issues to be examined by Sir Gordon Downey, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, and the Inland Revenue.
They each paid £7,500 towards the paper&#x27;s legal costs. All the &quot;cash-for-questions&quot; evidence was sent to Sir Gordon Downey, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. On 1 October 1996, Hamilton appeared on the evening television program, &quot;Newsnight&quot;, and engaged in a live debate with Alan Rusbridger, the editor of &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

====Enquiry====
The &quot;cash for questions&quot; parliamentary enquiry took place in 1997, led by Downey. Hamilton vowed that if the &quot;Downey report&quot; found against him, he would resign.

Edwina Currie, a former health minister, gave evidence. She told the inquiry that, in May 1988, Hamilton had been unmoved by a set of photographs that depicted smoking-related cancers; that is, harm to young people which might be caused by a product (tobacco) that he promoted. Hamilton argued the pictures were irrelevant. Both Hamilton and Michael Brown had received a £6,000 honorarium and hospitality from Skoal Bandits. In December 1989, the sale of Skoal Bandit products was banned in the UK by the Secretary of State for Health, Kenneth Clarke.

Downey reported that he found the evidence against Hamilton in the case of Al-Fayed &quot;compelling&quot;. Hamilton received over £25,000 and had deliberately misled Michael Heseltine, then President of the Board of Trade, in October 1994, when he said he had no financial relationship with Ian Greer. In a phone conversation, Hamilton gave an absolute assurance to Heseltine that there was no such relationship, but he had received two payments from Greer in 1988 and 1989, totalling £10,000. Hamilton had asked for payment in kind so the money would not be taxable. He also failed to register his stays at the Hôtel Ritz Paris and at Al-Fayed&#x27;s castle in Scotland in 1989.

On 3 July 1997, the enquiry found Hamilton guilty of taking &quot;cash for questions&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote: &quot;Sir Gordon, contrary to Hamilton&#x27;s confident expectations, had no compunction about concluding that he did indeed take cash in brown envelopes&quot; and called on the new party leader to &quot;expel the miscreants&quot;. Hamilton, Smith (also found guilty), Brown and Michael Grylls were harshly criticised. If Hamilton and Smith had remained in parliament, Downey said he might have recommended long periods of suspension for both. Hamilton rejected these findings, whereas Smith, who had stood down, accepted them, apologised for his conduct, and retired from politics altogether.

====Libel action against Al-Fayed====
Hamilton also brought a legal action for libel against Mohamed Al-Fayed. On 16 January 1997, Al-Fayed appeared in an edition of the &quot;Dispatches&quot; documentary series on Channel 4. He claimed that Hamilton had demanded and had accepted cash payments of up to £110,000, Harrods&#x27; gift vouchers and a free holiday at the Hôtel Ritz Paris in 1987, in return for asking questions in Parliament on behalf of Harrods. While Hamilton did not deny the holiday, he continued to maintain that he was innocent of improper conduct.

On 31 July 1998, Hamilton&#x27;s action was approved for a court listing. Funds for the action were donated by Lord Harris of High Cross, the Earl of Portsmouth and Taki, who raised £50,000. Other contributors to the fund included Simon Heffer, Norris McWhirter, Peter Clarke, Lord Bell, Gyles Brandreth and Gerald Howarth (Hamilton&#x27;s co-plaintiff in the BBC action). Some Conservative MPs (approximately 40 of the 165) also made contributions. In total, approximately £410,000 was raised.

The jury trial commenced in November 1999. Hamilton and his wife were cross-examined by George Carman QC. Carman put to Hamilton that he had acted corruptly to demand and then take £10,000 from Mobil Oil in 1989 for tabling an amendment to a finance bill. At the time, Hamilton was a member of a Commons select committee on finance. Al-Fayed said Hamilton had taken the money either in brown envelope cash payments or through Ian Greer. Hamilton said in his own evidence: &quot;I have never received a penny from Mr Fayed; I have never asked.&quot; His counsel, in the closing comments, argued that Al-Fayed&#x27;s assertions had destroyed his client&#x27;s reputation.

On 21 December 1999, the jury unanimously decided in favour of Al-Fayed, declaring Hamilton corrupt. A year later, Hamilton lost his appeal against the decision, and was refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords on 2 April 2001.

== Bankruptcy ==
On 22 May 2001, unable to pay his legal fees and with costs amounting to some £3m, Hamilton was declared bankrupt. His and his wife&#x27;s home in Nether Alderley, Cheshire was sold for £1.25 million. He was discharged from bankruptcy in May 2004.

==False rape accusation==
On 10 August 2001, Hamilton and his wife, Christine, were arrested by police who were investigating an alleged rape. The Hamiltons said they could not have been present at the alleged rape scene because they were hosting a dinner party and produced alibis including one from Derek Laud. The investigation against the couple was dropped when it became apparent that the accusations were entirely false. This event was recorded on film by Louis Theroux, who, at that time, was spending time with the Hamiltons for an episode of his documentary series &quot;When Louis Met...&quot;.

In June 2003, Nadine Milroy-Sloan, the woman responsible for the unfounded accusation, was sentenced to three years in jail for perverting the course of justice. In February 2005, the publicist Max Clifford, who had acted for Milroy-Sloan, settled, paying Hamilton an undisclosed sum.

In 2014, Milroy-Sloan, under her birth name Emily Checksfield, was jailed again for falsely claiming to police that her ex-partner had threatened to kill her with a Samurai sword. The same year, Clifford was jailed for sexual assaults on under-age girls. After Clifford died in prison in December 2017, he was described by Hamilton as a &quot;monster&quot;.

==Television appearances==
On 9 May 1997, Hamilton and his wife appeared on the current affairs satire quiz programme &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. The episode was recorded one week after Hamilton lost his seat. Angus Deayton, the presenter of the panel game, wore a white suit instead of his usual brown one. This was a humorous reference to Martin Bell, who wore just such a suit throughout the 1997 general election campaign. As a further taunt, at the end of the show, the Hamiltons were handed their &quot;fee&quot; in brown envelopes. At one point Hamilton quipped: &quot;I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s much better making political jokes than being one.&quot;

On 30 March 2000, Hamilton appeared on &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot; on Channel 4, for a satirical comedic interview when he was seen to be sharing what appeared to be a marijuana joint with the comedian Sacha Baron Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Ali G&quot; character.

In 2001 Hamilton appeared on &quot;When Louis Met...&quot;, a documentary by Louis Theroux, during which he described himself and his wife as &quot;professional objects of curiosity&quot;.

Since then, the Hamiltons have appeared in pantomimes, television chat shows, and programmes such as &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; and &quot;Ready Steady Cook&quot;. He appeared on a celebrity edition of &quot;Mastermind&quot; on Boxing Day 2004. He appeared on stage in &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; wearing six-inch stiletto heels, a basque, suspenders and stockings, however he declined to appear on &quot;Big Brother&quot; or &quot;Celebrity Wife Swap.&quot;

In 2005, Hamilton appeared on the Johnny Vegas show &quot;18 Stone of Idiot&quot;, where he danced in a perspex box whilst Vegas and a member of the public poured buckets of fish over his head.

Due to his television appearances, &quot;The Guardian&quot; described him as &quot;an all-purpose Z-list celebrity&quot;.

==Political ideology==
Hamilton argued for the individual&#x27;s right to smoke. He was the only member in committee to oppose the Conservative government&#x27;s bill to outlaw trafficking in human organs. In April 1986, Hamilton was one of ten MPs to vote against the government on an EEC bill. Hamilton was a member of the &quot;No Turning Back group&quot;, advocating Thatcherite policies.

In November 1989, Hamilton won the &quot;Spectator&quot; parliamentary wit of the year award. He jokingly remarked that when told of winning the award, he thought it was for being the &quot;Twit of the year&quot;.

Hamilton&#x27;s comments are frequently controversial. During a debate about amputees he said that Frank Dobson &quot;does not have a leg to stand on&quot;. (January 1987). To Jeremy Corbyn, he suggested that &quot;some of [his] IRA friends could be used to get rid of pensioners by shooting them&quot;—also in 1987.

==Personal life==
On 4 June 1983, five days before polling day in the 1983 general election, Hamilton married Mary Christine Holman, the secretary to Tory MP Michael Grylls, in Cornwall. In September 2003, after having a residence in the Tatton constituency for twenty years, the Hamiltons moved to Hullavington, Wiltshire, where they purchased a home in October 2004. In 2006, they released a song coinciding with the World Cup, &quot;England are Jolly Dee&quot;.

In 1992, Hamilton suffered a broken nose when he defended Harvey Proctor during a homophobic attack in Proctor&#x27;s shirtmaking shop. Two men were later imprisoned for the assault.

Since 2008, he has been company secretary of Vixen Consultants Limited. The trading name of Vixen Consultants is Christine Hamilton.
