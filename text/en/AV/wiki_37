<text>A CAS Registry Number (also referred to as CAS RN or informally CAS Number) is a unique identification number, assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) in the US to every chemical substance described in the open scientific literature, in order to index the substance in the CAS Registry. This registry includes all substances described since 1957, plus some substances from as far back as the early 1800s; it is a chemical database that includes organic and inorganic compounds, minerals, isotopes, alloys, mixtures, and nonstructurable materials (UVCBs, substances of unknown or variable composition, complex reaction products, or biological origin). CAS RNs are generally serial numbers (with a check digit), so they do not contain any information about the structures themselves the way SMILES and InChI strings do.

The CAS Registry is an authoritative collection of disclosed chemical substance information. It identifies more than 204 million unique organic and inorganic substances and 69 million protein and DNA sequences, plus additional information about each substance. It is updated with around 15,000 additional new substances daily. A collection of almost 500 thousand CAS registry numbers are made available under a CC BY-NC license at ACS Commons Chemistry.

== History and use ==
Historically, chemicals have been identified by a wide variety of synonyms. One of the biggest challenges in the early development of substance indexing, a task undertaken by the Chemical Abstracts Service, was in identifying if a substance in literature was new or if it had been previously discovered. Well-known chemicals may additionally be known via multiple generic, historical, commercial, and/or (black)-market names, and even systematic nomenclature based on structure alone was not universally useful. An algorithm was developed to translate the structural formula of a chemical into a computer-searchable table, which provided a basis for the service that listed each chemical with its CAS Registry Number, the CAS Chemical Registry System, which became operational in 1965.

CAS Registry Numbers (CAS RN) are simple and regular, convenient for database searches. They offer a reliable, common and international link to every specific substance across the various nomenclatures and disciplines used by branches of science, industry, and regulatory bodies. Almost all molecule databases today allow searching by CAS Registry Number, and it is used as a global standard.

== Format ==
A CAS Registry Number has no inherent meaning, but is assigned in sequential, increasing order when the substance is identified by CAS scientists for inclusion in the CAS Registry database.

A CAS RN is separated by hyphens into three parts, the first consisting from two up to seven digits, the second consisting of two digits, and the third consisting of a single digit serving as a check digit. This format gives CAS a maximum capacity of 1,000,000,000 unique numbers.

The check digit is found by taking the last digit times 1, the preceding digit times 2, the preceding digit times 3 etc., adding all these up and computing the sum modulo 10. For example, the CAS number of water is 7732-18-5: the checksum 5 is calculated as (8×1 + 1×2 + 2×3 + 3×4 + 7×5 + 7×6) = 105; 105 mod 10 = 5.

== Granularity ==
* Stereoisomers and racemic mixtures are assigned discrete CAS Registry Numbers: -epinephrine has 51-43-4, -epinephrine has 150-05-0, and racemic -epinephrine has 329-65-7
* Different phases do not receive different CAS RNs (liquid water and ice both have 7732-18-5), but different crystal structures do (carbon in general is 7440-44-0, graphite is 7782-42-5 and diamond is 7782-40-3)
* Commonly encountered mixtures of known or unknown composition may receive a CAS RN; examples are Leishman stain (12627-53-1) and mustard oil (8007-40-7).
* Some chemical elements are discerned by their oxidation state, e.g. the element chromium has 7440-47-3, the trivalent Cr(III) has 16065-83-1 and the hexavalent Cr(VI) species have 18540-29-9.
* Occasionally whole classes of molecules receive a single CAS RN: the class of enzymes known as alcohol dehydrogenases has 9031-72-5.

<text>Leffert Lefferts Buck (February 5, 1837 – July 7, 1909) was an American civil engineer and a pioneer in the use of steel arch bridge structures.

==Career==
Leffert Buck was born in Canton, New York. He graduated from St. Lawrence University in 1863. After his graduation from St. Lawrence, Buck enlisted and fought for the Union Army in the American Civil War under General Slocum, participating in the battles at Antietam, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Lookout Mountain, Missionary Ridge, Peachtree Creek, Resaca and Ringgold Gap. Following the completion of the Civil War, Buck earned his civil engineering degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, in 1868. 

Buck served as president of the American Society of Civil Engineers. He also worked with Richard Buck, another prominent bridge engineer. 

== Projects ==
Some of his projects include:
* The Verrugas Viaduct on the Oroya Railroad in Peru (in the early 1870s).
* The Whirlpool Rapids Bridge over the Niagara Gorge, which still exists. He reconstructed and reinforced the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge, which allowed traffic to continue while the Whirlpool bridge was under construction. Steel towers and framework supporting the project were removed once it was completed. At the time of completion, it was the longest arch bridge ever built (168 meters across).
* The Williamsburg Bridge, one of New York City&#x27;s most notable landmarks, with Henry Hornbostel. At 1,600 feet it was the longest bridge in the world when completed in 1903 and a key factor in opening Brooklyn up as a working-class neighborhood for Manhattan. The bridge is well known for its vast reach and massive symmetry.

* The Pont De Rennes bridge (former Platt Street bridge) that spans the Genesee River in Rochester at the High Falls.
* Engineered the Queensboro Bridge in New York City.

== Death and legacy ==
Buck died on July 7, 1909, in Hastings, New York. His widow, Mira Gould Buck, died in Eastview, New York, in 1946 at the age of 84.

A dormitory in the Quadrangle complex at Rensselaer is named after him.

<doc id="160821" wikidata="Q367770" url="?curid=160821" title="Fred Phelps">
<text>Fred Waldron Phelps Sr. (November 13, 1929 – March 19, 2014) was an American minister and disbarred lawyer who served as the pastor of the Westboro Baptist Church, worked as a civil rights attorney, and ran for statewide election in Kansas. A divisive and controversial figure, he gained national attention for his homophobic views and protests near the funerals of gay people, AIDS victims, military veterans, and disaster victims whom he believed were killed as a result of God punishing the U.S. for having &quot;bankrupt values&quot; and tolerating homosexuality. Phelps founded the Westboro Baptist Church, a Topeka, Kansas-based independent Primitive Baptist congregation, in 1955. It has been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as &quot;arguably the most obnoxious and rabid hate group in America&quot;. Its signature slogan, &quot;God Hates Fags&quot;, remains the name of the group&#x27;s principal website.

In addition to funerals, Phelps and his followers—mostly his own immediate family members—picketed gay pride gatherings, high-profile political events, university commencement ceremonies, live performances of &quot;The Laramie Project&quot;, and functions sponsored by mainstream Christian groups with which he had no affiliation, arguing it was their sacred duty to warn others of God&#x27;s anger. He continued doing so in the face of numerous legal challenges—some of which reached the U.S. Supreme Court—and near-universal opposition and contempt from other religious groups and the general public. Laws enacted at both the federal and state levels for the specific purpose of curtailing his disruptive activities were limited in their effectiveness due to the Constitutional protections afforded to Phelps under the First Amendment.

Gay rights supporters denounced him as a producer of anti-gay propaganda and violence-inspiring hate speech, and even Christians from fundamentalist denominations distanced themselves from him. In particular, Phelps and his church routinely targeted the Catholic Church with picket signs and online websites claiming that &quot;priests rape boys&quot; and &quot;fag priests&quot; and focusing on the Catholic Church sex scandals, calling the pope &quot;The Godfather of pedophiles&quot;. Although Phelps died in 2014, the Westboro Baptist Church remains in operation. It continues to conduct regular demonstrations outside movie theaters, universities, government buildings, and other facilities in Topeka and elsewhere, and is still characterized as a hate group by the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center.

==Early life and education==

Fred Waldron Phelps was born on November 13, 1929, in Meridian, Mississippi, the elder of two children of Catherine Idalette (née Johnston) and Fred Wade Phelps. His father was a railroad policeman for the Columbus and Greenville Railway and a devout Methodist; his mother was a homemaker. Catherine Phelps died of esophageal cancer in 1935 at the age of 28. Her aunt, Irene Jordan, helped care for Fred and his younger sister Martha Jean until December 1944, when his father married Olive Briggs, a 39-year-old woman who was divorced.

Fred distinguished himself scholastically and was an Eagle Scout. He also was a member of Phi Kappa, a high school social fraternity, president of the Young Peoples Department of Central United Methodist Church and was honored as the best drilled member of the Mississippi Junior State Guard, a unit similar to the Reserve Officer Training Corps. He graduated from high school at 16 years old, ranking sixth in his graduating class of 213 students, and was the class orator at his commencement. After graduating from high school he received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point; but after attending a tent revival meeting, decided to pursue a religious calling instead.

In September 1947, at the age of 17, he was ordained a Southern Baptist minister and moved to Cleveland, Tennessee, to attend Bob Jones College (now Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina). A combination of Phelps&#x27;s refusal of the West Point appointment (which his father had worked hard to obtain), his abandonment of his father&#x27;s beloved Methodist faith, and his father&#x27;s remarriage to a divorced woman (Phelps would later become an outspoken critic of divorce) precipitated a lifelong estrangement from his father and stepmother—and by some accounts, from his sister as well. Phelps apparently never spoke to his family members again, and returned all of their letters and birthday cards, as well as Christmas gifts for his children, unopened.

Phelps dropped out of Bob Jones College in 1948. He moved to California and became a street preacher while attending John Muir College in Pasadena. The June 11, 1951 issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine included a story on Phelps, who lectured fellow students about &quot;sins committed on campus by students and teachers&quot;, including &quot;promiscuous petting, evil language, profanity, cheating, teachers&#x27; filthy jokes in classrooms, and pandering to the lusts of the flesh.&quot; When the college ordered him to stop, citing a California law that forbade the teaching of religion on any public school campus, he moved his sermons across the street. In October 1951, Phelps met Margie Marie Simms in Arizona and married her in May 1952.

In 1954, Phelps, his pregnant wife, and their newborn son moved to Topeka, Kansas, where he was hired by the East Side Baptist Church as an associate pastor. The following year, the church&#x27;s leadership opened Westboro Baptist Church on the other side of town, and Phelps became its pastor.

Although the new church was ostensibly Independent Baptist, Phelps preached a doctrine very similar to that of the Primitive Baptists, who believe in scriptural literalism — that Christian biblical scripture is literally true — and that only a predetermined number of people selected for redemption before the world was created will be saved on Judgment Day. His vitriolic preaching alienated church leaders and most of the original congregation, who either returned to East Side Baptist or joined other congregations, leaving him with a small following consisting almost entirely of his own relatives and close friends.

Phelps was forced to support himself selling vacuum cleaners, baby strollers, and insurance; later, some of his 13 children were reportedly compelled to sell candy door-to-door for several hours each day. In 1972, two companies sued Westboro Baptist for failing to pay for the candy being peddled by the children.

==Legal career==
===Civil rights cases===

====Early civil rights career====
Phelps earned a law degree from Washburn University in 1964, and founded the Phelps Chartered law firm. However, in 1969, upon a finding of professional misconduct, authorities suspended him from practicing as a lawyer for two years.

Phelps&#x27; second notable cases were related to civil rights, and his involvement in civil rights cases in and around Kansas gained him praise from local African-American leaders.

&quot;I systematically brought down the Jim Crow laws of this town&quot;, he claimed. Phelps&#x27; daughter Shirley Phelps-Roper was quoted as saying, &quot;We took on the Jim Crow establishment, and Kansas did not take that sitting down. They used to shoot our car windows out, screaming we were nigger lovers.&quot; She added that the Phelps law firm made up one-third of the state&#x27;s federal docket of civil rights cases.

Phelps took cases on behalf of African-American clients alleging racial discrimination by school systems, and a predominantly black American Legion post which had been raided by police, alleging racially based police abuse. Phelps&#x27; law firm obtained settlements for some clients.

====&quot;Johnson v. Topeka Board of Education&quot;, et. al.====

Phelps&#x27; national notoriety first came from a 1973 lawsuit (settled in 1978) on behalf of a 10-year-old African-American plaintiff, Evelyn Renee Johnson (some sources say Evelyn &quot;Rene&quot; Johnson), against the Topeka Board of Education (which had, in 1954, famously lost the pivotal racial discrimination case of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education,&quot; ending legal racial segregation in U.S. public schools), and against related local, state and federal officials. In the 1973 case, Phelps argued that the Topeka Board of Education, in violation of the 1954 ruling, had not yet made its schools equal, and by attending Topeka&#x27;s east-side, predominantly minority schools, the black plaintiff had received an inferior education.

Initially, Phelps attempted to file the case as a class action, in the U.S. District Court for Kansas. Asking the court to order an end to the alleged discrimination and suggesting that busing might be at least one remedy, Phelps also sought $100 million in actual damages, plus another $100 million in punitive damages—or, alternatively, $20,000 for each of the 10,000 students he claimed were in the aggrieved class of victims. Nevertheless, the federal district and appellate courts denied the class action filing, limiting the case to Phelps&#x27;s initial plaintiff, Evelyn Johnson, alone.

The case fueled a national debate about racial integration of schools, and prompted the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, by 1974, to order the Topeka board to develop corrective remedies.

Topeka&#x27;s school board did not contest the charges. On the guidance of its insurance provider, it settled the litigation (with no admission of wrongdoing) for $19,500—$12,400 of which went to Phelps. While the settlement drew some praise, controversy arose when the judge ordered the settlement amount sealed at the request of the insurer—apparently with Phelps&#x27;s approval. (Details leaked out to the media anyway.) Phelps announced he would file more such cases, as class actions, but the insurance company stated it would not pay for any more of them.

====Later civil rights career====

In 1986, Phelps sued President Ronald Reagan over Reagan&#x27;s appointment of a U.S. ambassador to the Vatican, alleging this violated separation of church and state. The case was dismissed by the U.S. district court.

Phelps&#x27; law firm, staffed by himself and family members, also represented non-white Kansans in discrimination actions against Kansas City Power and Light, Southwestern Bell, and the Topeka City Attorney, and represented two female professors alleging discrimination at Kansas universities.

A defeat in his civil rights suit against the City of Wichita and others, on behalf of Jesse O. Rice (the fired executive director of the Wichita Civil Rights Equal Employment Opportunity Commission), among other causes, would lead to further legal actions ending in Phelps&#x27; disbarment and censure.

In the 1980s, Phelps received awards from the Greater Kansas City Chapter of Blacks in Government and the Bonner Springs branch of the NAACP, for his work on behalf of black clients.

One of his sons, Nate, stated that Phelps largely took civil rights cases for money rather than principle. Nate said that his father &quot;held racist attitudes&quot; and he would use slurs against black clients: &quot;They would come into his office and after they left, he would talk about how stupid they were and call them dumb niggers.&quot; Nate&#x27;s sister, Shirley, denies his account and states their father never used racist language.

===Disbarment===
A formal complaint was filed against Phelps on November 8, 1977, by the Kansas State Board of Law Examiners, due to his conduct during a lawsuit, against a court reporter named Carolene Brady, who had failed to have a court transcript ready for Phelps on the day he asked for it. Although it did not affect the outcome of the case, Phelps sued her for $22,000.

In the ensuing trial, Phelps called Brady to the stand, declared her a hostile witness, and then cross-examined her for nearly a week, during which he accused her of being a &quot;slut&quot;, tried to introduce testimony from former boyfriends whom Phelps wanted to subpoena, and accused her of a variety of perverse sexual acts, ultimately reducing her to tears on the stand.

Phelps lost the case. According to the Kansas Supreme Court:

In an appeal, Phelps prepared affidavits swearing to the court that he had eight witnesses whose testimony would convince the court to rule in his favor. Brady obtained sworn, signed affidavits from those eight people in question, all of whom said that Phelps had never contacted them and that they had no reason to testify against Brady.

Phelps was found to have made &quot;false statements in violation of DR 7–102(A)(5)&quot;. On July 20, 1979, Phelps was permanently disbarred from practicing law in the state of Kansas, although he continued to practice in federal courts.

In 1985, nine Federal judges filed a disciplinary complaint against Phelps and five of his children, alleging false accusations against the judges. In 1989, the complaint was settled; Phelps agreed to stop practicing law in Federal court permanently, and two of his children were suspended for a period of six months and one year, respectively.

==Family life==
Phelps married Margie M. Simms in May 1952, a year after the couple met at the Arizona Bible Institute. They had 13 children, 54 grandchildren, and 7 great-grandchildren.

Nathan Phelps, Fred Phelps&#x27; estranged son, claims that the elder Phelps was an abusive father, that he (Nate) never had a relationship with him when he was growing up, and that the Westboro Baptist Church is an organization for his father to &quot;vent his rage and anger.&quot; He alleges that, in addition to hurting others, his father used to physically abuse his wife and children by beating them with his fists and with the handle of a mattock to the point of bleeding. Phelps&#x27; brother, Mark, has supported and repeated Nathan&#x27;s claims of physical abuse by their father. Since 2004, over 20 members of the church, mostly family members, have left the church.

==Religious beliefs==

Phelps described himself as an Old School Baptist, and stated that he held to all five points of Calvinism. Phelps particularly highlighted John Calvin&#x27;s doctrine of unconditional election, the belief that God has elected certain people for salvation before birth, and limited atonement, the belief that Christ only died for the elect, and condemns those who believe otherwise. Despite claiming to be an Old School Baptist, he was ordained by a Southern Baptist church, and was rejected and generally condemned by Old School (or Primitive) Baptists.

Phelps viewed Arminianism (particularly the views of the Methodist theologian William Elbert Munsey) as a &quot;worse blasphemy and heresy than that heard in all filthy Saturday night fag bars in the aggregate in the world&quot;.

In addition to John Calvin, Phelps admired Martin Luther and Bob Jones Sr., and approvingly quoted a statement by Jones that &quot;what this country needs is 50 Jonathan Edwardses turned loose in it.&quot; Phelps particularly held to equal ultimacy, believing that &quot;God Almighty makes some willing and he leads others into sin&quot;, a view he said is Calvinist.

Phelps opposed such common Baptist practices as Sunday school meetings, Bible colleges and seminaries, and multi-denominational crusades. Although he attended Bob Jones University, and worked with Billy Graham in his Los Angeles Crusade before Graham changed his views on a literal Hell and salvation, Phelps considered Graham the greatest false prophet since Balaam. He also condemned large church leaders, such as Robert Schuller and Jerry Falwell, as well as all Catholics.

==Church protest activities==

All of Phelps&#x27; demonstrations and other activities during the last 50 years of his life were conducted in conjunction with the congregation of Westboro Baptist Church (WBC), an American unaffiliated Baptist church known for its extreme ideologies, especially those against gay people. The church is widely described as a hate group and is monitored as such by the Anti-Defamation League and Southern Poverty Law Center. It was headed by Phelps until his later years when he took a reduced role in the activities of the church and his family. In March 2014, church representatives said that the church had not had a defined leader in &quot;a very long time,&quot; and church members consist primarily of his large family; in 2011, the church stated that it had about 40 members. The church is headquartered in a residential neighborhood on the west side of Topeka about three miles (5 km) west of the Kansas State Capitol. Its first public service was held on the afternoon of November 27, 1955.

The church has been involved in actions against gay people since at least 1991, when it sought a crackdown on homosexual activity at Gage Park six blocks northwest of the church. In 2001, Phelps estimated that the WBC had held 40 pickets a week for the previous 10 years. In addition to conducting anti-gay protests at military funerals, the organization pickets other celebrity funerals and public events that are likely to gain media attention. Protests have also been held against Jews, and some protests have included WBC members stomping on the American flag.

===Lawsuit against Westboro Baptist Church===

On March 10, 2006, WBC picketed the funeral of Marine Lance Corporal Matthew A. Snyder, who died in combat in Iraq on March 3, 2006. The Snyder family sued Fred Phelps for defamation, invasion of privacy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

On October 31, 2007, WBC, Fred Phelps and his two daughters, Shirley Phelps-Roper and Rebekah Phelps-Davis, were found liable for invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress. A federal jury awarded Snyder&#x27;s father $2.9 million in compensatory damages, then later added a decision to award $6 million in punitive damages for invasion of privacy and an additional $2 million for causing emotional distress (a total of $10.9 million).

The lawsuit named Albert Snyder, father of Matthew Snyder, as the plaintiff, and Fred W. Phelps Sr., Westboro Baptist Church, Inc., Rebekah Phelps-Davis, and Shirley Phelps-Roper as defendants, alleging that they were responsible for publishing defamatory information about the Snyder family on the Internet, including statements that Albert and his wife had &quot;raised [Matthew] for the devil&quot; and taught him &quot;to defy his Creator, to divorce, and to commit adultery&quot;. Other statements denounced them for raising their son Catholic. Snyder further complained the defendants had intruded upon and staged protests at his son&#x27;s funeral. The claims of invasion of privacy and defamation arising from comments posted about Snyder on the Westboro website were dismissed on First Amendment grounds, but the case proceeded to trial on the remaining three counts.

Albert Snyder, the father of LCpl Matthew A. Snyder, testified:

In his instructions to the jury, U.S. District Judge Richard D. Bennett stated that the First Amendment protection of free speech has limits, including vulgar, offensive and shocking statements, and that the jury must decide &quot;whether the defendant&#x27;s actions would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, whether they were extreme and outrageous and whether these actions were so offensive and shocking as to not be entitled to First Amendment protection&quot;. (see also &quot;Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire&quot;, a case in which certain personal slurs and obscene utterances by an individual were found unworthy of First Amendment protection, due to the potential for violence resulting from their utterance). WBC sought a mistrial based on alleged prejudicial statements made by the judge and violations of the gag order by the plaintiff&#x27;s attorney. An appeal was also sought by the WBC. On February 4, 2008, Bennett upheld the ruling but reduced the punitive damages from $8 million to $2.1 million. The total judgment then stood at $5 million. Court liens were ordered on church buildings and Phelps&#x27; law office in an attempt to ensure that the damages were paid.

An appeal by WBC was heard on September 24, 2009. The federal appeals court ruled in favor of Phelps and Westboro Baptist Church, stating that their picket near the funeral of LCpl Matthew A. Snyder is protected speech and did not violate the privacy of the service member&#x27;s family, reversing the lower court&#x27;s $5 million judgment. On March 30, 2010, the federal appeals court ordered Albert Snyder to pay the court costs for the Westboro Baptist Church, an amount totaling $16,510. Political commentator Bill O&#x27;Reilly agreed on March 30 to cover the costs, pending appeal.

A writ of certiorari was granted on an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the oral argument for the case took place on October 6, 2010. Margie Phelps, one of Fred Phelps&#x27; children, represented the Westboro Baptist Church.

The Court ruled in favor of Phelps in an 8–1 decision, holding that the protesters&#x27; speech related to a public issue, and was disseminated on a public sidewalk. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote, for the majority, &quot;As a nation we have chosen ... to protect even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate.&quot; Justice Samuel Alito, the lone dissenter, wrote, &quot;Our profound national commitment to free and open debate is not a license for the vicious verbal assault that occurred in this case.&quot;

===Efforts to discourage funeral protests===
On May 24, 2006, the United States House and Senate passed the Respect for America&#x27;s Fallen Heroes Act, which President George W. Bush signed five days later. The act bans protests within of national cemeteries – which numbered 122 when the bill was signed – from an hour before a funeral to an hour after it. Violators face up to a $100,000 fine and up to a year in prison.

On August 6, 2012, President Obama signed , the Honoring America&#x27;s Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 which, among other things, requires a and 2-hour buffer zone around military funerals.

, nine states had passed laws regarding protests near funeral sites immediately before and after ceremonies:

* Illinois
* Indiana
* Iowa
* Kansas
* Kentucky
* Louisiana
* Maryland
* Michigan
* Missouri
States that are considering laws are:

* Nebraska

Florida increased the penalty for disturbing military funerals, amending a previous ban on the disruption of lawful assembly.

On January 11, 2011, Arizona passed an emergency measure which prohibits protests within of any funeral services, in response to an announcement by the WBC that it planned to protest at 2011 Tucson shooting victim Christina Green&#x27;s funeral.

These bans have been contested. Bart McQueary, having protested with Phelps on at least three occasions, filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of Kentucky&#x27;s funeral protest ban. On September 26, 2006, a district court agreed and entered an injunction prohibiting the ban from being enforced. In the opinion, the judge wrote:

The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit in Missouri on behalf of Phelps and Westboro Baptist Church to overturn the ban on the picketing of soldier&#x27;s funerals. The ACLU of Ohio also filed a similar lawsuit.

In the case of &quot;Snyder v. Phelps&quot;, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that &quot;distasteful and repugnant&quot; protests surrounding funerals of service members were protected by the First Amendment. But attorneys for the service member&#x27;s family appealed the decision on the grounds that such speech should not be allowed to inflict emotional distress on private parties exercising their freedom of religion during a funeral service. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case on October 6, 2010, and ruled 8–1 in favor of Phelps in an opinion released on March 2, 2011. The court held that &quot;any distress occasioned by Westboro&#x27;s picketing turned on the content and viewpoint of the message conveyed, rather than any interference with the funeral itself&quot; and thus could not be restricted.

===People targeted by Phelps===

Beginning in the early 1990s, Phelps targeted numerous individuals and groups in the public eye for criticism by the Westboro Baptist Church.

Prominent examples include President Ronald Reagan, Princess Diana, Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist, National Football League star Reggie White, Sonny Bono, comedian George Carlin, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, atheists, Muslims, murdered college student Matthew Shepard, children&#x27;s television host Fred Rogers, American televangelist Tammy Faye Bakker, Australian actor Heath Ledger, Comedy Central&#x27;s Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, political commentator Bill O&#x27;Reilly, filmmaker Richard Rossi, film critic Roger Ebert, Catholics, Australians, Swedes, the Irish, and US soldiers killed in Iraq. He also targeted the Joseph Estabrook Elementary School in Lexington, Massachusetts, center of the David Parker controversy.

Phelps also picketed memorials to victims of different mass shootings, including the spreading of unfounded theories, such as saying that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the perpetrators of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, were gay, saying that &quot;Two filthy fags slaughtered 13 people at Columbine High.&quot;

In 2006, in the aftermath of the West Nickel Mines School shooting, where five Amish girls were murdered, Phelps mocked the shooting, saying that it had been caused by Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell&#x27;s criticism of Westboro. Phelps further planned a protest at the funeral for the five girls murdered, but called it off, opting to spread their messages on a local radio station instead.

Phelps continued picketing funerals and memorials for victims of mass shootings during the late 2000s, including the plan to picket the memorial for two victims of the Northern Illinois University shooting in 2008, which was countered by a preacher who hosted a seminar against Phelps&#x27; views. After Phelps announced plans, as aforementioned, to picket the funeral of the youngest victim of the 2011 Tucson shooting on Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, Phelps responded to the emergency legislation which banned him from doing so, by praising the shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, saying: &quot;Thank God for the violent shooter&quot;, and labeled Loughner as a &quot;hero&quot;. In 2007, he stated that he would target Jerry Falwell&#x27;s funeral.

Phelps&#x27; daughter, Shirley Phelps-Roper, has appeared on Fox News Channel, defending the WBC and attacking homosexuality. She and her children have also appeared on the Howard Stern radio show attempting to promote their agenda and church. Phelps&#x27; followers have repeatedly protested the University of Kansas School of Law&#x27;s graduation ceremonies.

In August 2007, in the wake of the Minneapolis I-35W bridge collapse, Phelps and his congregation stated that they would protest at the funerals of the victims. In a statement, the church said that Minneapolis is the &quot;land of the Sodomite damned&quot;.

==Political activities==
===Anti-gay===
In the movie &quot;Hatemongers&quot;, members of the Westboro Baptist Church state their children were being &quot;accosted&quot; by homosexuals in Gage Park, about a mile from the Phelps&#x27; home and a mile northwest of Westboro Baptist Church. Shirley Phelps-Roper says that, in the late 1980s, Fred Phelps claimed to have witnessed a homosexual attempting to lure her then five-year-old son Joshua into some shrubbery. After several complaints to the local government about the large amount of homosexual sex occurring in the park, with no resulting action, the Phelpses put up signs warning of homosexual activity. This resulted in much negative attention for the family. When the Phelpses called on local churches to speak against the activity in Gage Park, the churches also lashed out against the Phelps family, leading to the family protesting homosexuality on a regular basis.

In 2005, Phelps and his family, along with several other local congregations, held a signature drive to bring about a vote to repeal two city ordinances that added sexual orientation to a definition of hate crimes and banned the city itself from workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation. Enough signatures were collected to bring the measure to a vote. Topeka voters defeated the repeal measure on March 1, 2005, by a 53–47% margin. In the same election, Phelps&#x27; granddaughter Jael was an unsuccessful candidate for the Topeka City Council, seeking to replace Tiffany Muller, the first openly gay member of the council.

===Electoral politics===

Phelps ran in Kansas Democratic Party primaries five times, but never won. These included races for governor in 1990, 1994, and 1998, receiving about 15 percent of the vote in 1998. In the 1992 Democratic Party primary for U.S. Senate, Phelps received 31 percent of the vote. Phelps ran for mayor of Topeka in 1993 and 1997.

Phelps supported Al Gore in the 1988 Democratic Party presidential primary election. In his 1984 Senate race, Gore had opposed a &quot;gay bill of rights&quot; and stated that homosexuality was not something that &quot;society should affirm&quot;, a position Gore had publicly changed by 2000 as his official position. Phelps stated that he supported Gore because of these earlier comments.

In 1996 Phelps opposed Clinton&#x27;s (and Gore&#x27;s) re-election because of the administration&#x27;s support for gay rights; the Westboro congregation picketed a 1997 inaugural ball.

===Saddam Hussein===
In 1997, Phelps wrote a letter to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, praising his regime for being &quot;the only Muslim state that allows the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ to be freely and openly preached on the streets&quot;.

==Arrests and traveling restrictions==

===United States===
In 1994, Phelps was convicted of disorderly conduct for verbal harassment, and received two suspended 30-day jail sentences.

Phelps&#x27; 1995 conviction for assault and battery carried a five-year prison sentence, with a mandatory 18 months to be served before he became eligible for parole. Phelps fought to be allowed to remain free until his appeals process went through. Days away from being arrested and sent to prison, a judge ruled that Phelps had been denied a speedy trial and that he was not required to serve any time.

=== Canada===
In August 2008, Canadian officials learned of WBC&#x27;s intent to stage a protest at the funeral of Tim McLean, a Winnipeg resident who was killed on a bus. The protests intended to convey the message that the man&#x27;s murder was God&#x27;s response to Canadian laws permitting abortion, homosexuality, divorce and remarriage. In response, Canadian officials barred the organization&#x27;s members from entering the country.

===United Kingdom===
On February 18, 2009, two days before the Westboro Baptist Church&#x27;s first UK picket, the United Kingdom Home Office announced that Fred Phelps and Shirley Phelps-Roper would be refused entry and that &quot;other church members could also be flagged and stopped if they tried to enter Britain&quot;. In May 2009, he and his daughter Shirley were placed on the Home Office&#x27;s &quot;name and shame&quot; list of people barred from entering the UK for &quot;fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence&quot;.

==In the media==
In 1993, Phelps appeared on a first-season episode of the talk show &quot;Ricki Lake&quot;, alleging that homosexuals and &quot;anyone who carries the AIDS virus&quot; deserved to die. When Phelps and his son-in-law Charles Hockenbarger (married to Phelps&#x27; daughter Rachel) became increasingly belligerent, Lake ordered the Phelps family to leave the studio. During a commercial break, the two were forced off the set and escorted out of the building by security. After Phelps died, Lake tweeted that when he had been on the show, he had told her that she worshipped her own rectum — a remark that led her to take action off-stage to have Phelps removed from the set.

The Phelps family was the subject of the 2007 TV program &quot;The Most Hated Family in America&quot;, presented on the BBC by Louis Theroux. Four years after his original documentary, Theroux produced a follow-up program &quot;America&#x27;s Most Hated Family in Crisis&quot;, which was prompted by news of family members leaving the church. Phelps&#x27; son Nate has broken ranks with the family and in an interview with Peter W. Klein on the Canadian program &quot;The Standard&quot;, he characterized his father as abusive and warned the Phelps family could turn violent. Writing in response to Phelps&#x27; death in 2014, Theroux described Phelps as &quot;an angry bigot who thrived on conflict&quot;, and expressed the view that his death would not lead to any &quot;huge changes&quot; in the church, as he saw it as operating with the dynamics of a large family rather than a cult. Theroux returned for a third documentary in 2019, titled &quot;Surviving America&#x27;s Most Hated Family&quot;.

Kevin Smith produced a horror film titled &quot;Red State&quot; featuring a religious fundamentalist villain inspired by Phelps.

Phelps appeared in &quot;A Union in Wait&quot;, a 2001 Sundance Channel documentary film about same-sex marriage, directed by Ryan Butler after Phelps picketed Wake Forest Baptist Church at Wake Forest University over a proposed same-sex union ceremony.

==Excommunication and death==
Fred Phelps preached his final Sunday sermon on September 1, 2013. Five weeks later, sermons resumed from various members.

On March 15, 2014, Nathan Phelps, Phelps&#x27; estranged son, reported that Phelps was in very poor health and was receiving hospice care. He said that Phelps had been excommunicated from the church in August 2013, and then moved into a house where he &quot;basically stopped eating and drinking&quot;. His statements were supported by his brother, Mark. Church spokesman Steve Drain declined to answer questions about Phelps&#x27; excommunication, and denied that the church had a single leader. The church&#x27;s official website said that membership status is private and did not confirm or deny the excommunication.

Phelps died of natural causes shortly before midnight on March 19, 2014, at the age of 84. His daughter, Shirley, stated that a funeral for her father would not be held because the church does not &quot;worship the dead&quot;. According to Nathan Phelps, Fred Phelps&#x27; body was immediately cremated, and according to his granddaughter Megan Phelps-Roper, Phelps&#x27; cremated remains were buried in an unmarked grave in Kansas.

Phelps had been reportedly suffering from some form of dementia in his final year, and started behaving
irrationally. This led to church members believing that God had condemned him. It has been stated that Phelps &quot;had a softening of heart at the end of his life,&quot; according to accounts published in a memoir written by Phelps&#x27; granddaughter Megan Phelps-Roper, and reporting from &quot;The New Yorker&quot; citing former members of the church. This includes an incident in 2013, in which Phelps is said to have stepped outside the church and called over to members of Planting Peace, a nonprofit that bought a house on the other street and painted it with an LGBTQ rainbow, saying: &quot;You&#x27;re good people!&quot; In an interview with &quot;NPR&quot;, Megan Phelps-Roper said this outburst was &quot;the proximate cause&quot; of Phelps being excommunicated, a claim that the church has denied. According to Phelps&#x27; grandson and former church member Zach Phelps-Roper, Phelps&#x27; actions were regarded as &quot;rank blasphemy&quot; by the church members.

<text>A tunnel is an underground or undersea passageway. It is dug through surrounding soil, earth or rock, or laid under water, and is usually completely enclosed except for the two portals common at each end, though there may be access and ventilation openings at various points along the length. A pipeline differs significantly from a tunnel, though some recent tunnels have used immersed tube construction techniques rather than traditional tunnel boring methods. 

A tunnel may be for foot or vehicular road traffic, for rail traffic, or for a canal. The central portions of a rapid transit network are usually in the tunnel. Some tunnels are used as sewers or aqueducts to supply water for consumption or for hydroelectric stations. Utility tunnels are used for routing steam, chilled water, electrical power or telecommunication cables, as well as connecting buildings for convenient passage of people and equipment.

Secret tunnels are built for military purposes, or by civilians for smuggling of weapons, contraband, or people. Special tunnels, such as wildlife crossings, are built to allow wildlife to cross human-made barriers safely. Tunnels can be connected together in tunnel networks.

A tunnel is relatively long and narrow; the length is often much greater than twice the diameter, although similar shorter excavations can be constructed, such as cross passages between tunnels. The definition of what constitutes a tunnel can vary widely from source to source. For example, in the United Kingdom, a road tunnel is defined as &quot;a subsurface highway structure enclosed for a length of or more.&quot; In the United States, the NFPA definition of a tunnel is &quot;An underground structure with a design length greater than and a diameter greater than .&quot;

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;tunnel&quot; comes from the Middle English &quot;tonnelle&quot;, meaning &quot;a net&quot;, derived from Old French &quot;tonnel&quot;, a diminutive of &quot;tonne&quot; (&quot;cask&quot;). The modern meaning, referring to an underground passageway, evolved in the 16th century as a metaphor for a narrow, confined space like the inside of a cask. 

== History ==
In Babylon, about 2200 B.C., it is believed that the first artificial tunnel was constructed. To join the temple of Belos with the palace, this was built with the aid of the cut and cover technique.

In the Mahabharata, the Pandavas built a secret tunnel within their new home, called &quot;Lakshagriha&quot; (House of Lac), which was constructed by Purochana under the orders of Duryodhana by the intention of burning them alive inside, allowing them to escape when the palace was set on fire; this act of foresight by the Pandavas saved their lives

Some of the earliest tunnels used by humans were paleoburrows excavated by prehistoric mammals.

Much of the early technology of tunnelling evolved from mining and military engineering. The etymology of the terms &quot;mining&quot; (for mineral extraction or for siege attacks), &quot;military engineering&quot;, and &quot;civil engineering&quot; reveals these deep historic connections.

=== Antiquity and early middle ages ===
Predecessors of modern tunnels were adits that transported water for irrigation, drinking, or sewerage. The first qanats are known from before 2000 BC.

The earliest tunnel known to have been excavated from both ends is the Siloam Tunnel, built in Jerusalem by the kings of Judah around the 8th century BC. Another tunnel excavated from both ends, maybe the second known, is the Tunnel of Eupalinos, which is a tunnel aqueduct long running through Mount Kastro in Samos, Greece. It was built in the 6th century BC to serve as an aqueduct. 

In Pakistan, the mughal era tunnel has been restored in the Lahore. 

In Ethiopia, the Siqurto foot tunnel, hand-hewn in the Middle Ages, crosses a mountain ridge.

In the Gaza Strip, the network of tunnels was used by Jewish strategists as rock-cut shelters, in first links to Judean resistance against Roman rule in the Bar Kokhba revolt during the 2nd century AD.

== Geotechnical investigation and design ==

A major tunnel project must start with a comprehensive investigation of ground conditions by collecting samples from boreholes and by other geophysical techniques. An informed choice can then be made of machinery and methods for excavation and ground support, which will reduce the risk of encountering unforeseen ground conditions. In planning the route, the horizontal and vertical alignments can be selected to make use of the best ground and water conditions. It is common practice to locate a tunnel deeper than otherwise would be required, in order to excavate through solid rock or other material that is easier to support during construction.

Conventional desk and preliminary site studies may yield insufficient information to assess such factors as the blocky nature of rocks, the exact location of fault zones, or the stand-up times of softer ground. This may be a particular concern in large-diameter tunnels. To give more information, a pilot tunnel (or &quot;drift tunnel&quot;) may be driven ahead of the main excavation. This smaller tunnel is less likely to collapse catastrophically should unexpected conditions be met, and it can be incorporated into the final tunnel or used as a backup or emergency escape passage. Alternatively, horizontal boreholes may sometimes be drilled ahead of the advancing tunnel face.

Other key geotechnical factors:
* Stand-up time is the amount of time a newly excavated cavity can support itself without any added structures. Knowing this parameter allows the engineers to determine how far an excavation can proceed before support is needed, which in turn affects the speed, efficiency, and cost of construction. Generally, certain configurations of rock and clay will have the greatest stand-up time, while sand and fine soils will have a much lower stand-up time.
* Groundwater control is very important in tunnel construction. Water leaking into a tunnel or vertical shaft will greatly decrease stand-up time, causing the excavation to become unstable and risking collapse. The most common way to control groundwater is to install dewatering pipes into the ground and to simply pump the water out. A very effective but expensive technology is ground freezing, using pipes which are inserted into the ground surrounding the excavation, which are then cooled with special refrigerant fluids. This freezes the ground around each pipe until the whole space is surrounded with frozen soil, keeping water out until a permanent structure can be built.
* Tunnel cross-sectional shape is also very important in determining stand-up time. If a tunnel excavation is wider than it is high, it will have a harder time supporting itself, decreasing its stand-up time. A square or rectangular excavation is more difficult to make self-supporting, because of a concentration of stress at the corners.

=== Choice of tunnels versus bridges ===

For water crossings, a tunnel is generally more costly to construct than a bridge. However, both navigational and traffic considerations may limit the use of high bridges or drawbridges intersecting with shipping channels, necessitating a tunnel.

Bridges usually require a larger footprint on each shore than tunnels. In areas with expensive real estate, such as Manhattan and urban Hong Kong, this is a strong factor in favor of a tunnel. Boston&#x27;s Big Dig project replaced elevated roadways with a tunnel system to increase traffic capacity, hide traffic, reclaim land, redecorate, and reunite the city with the waterfront.

The 1934 Queensway Tunnel under the River Mersey at Liverpool was chosen over a massively high bridge partly for defence reasons; it was feared that aircraft could destroy a bridge in times of war, not merely impairing road traffic but blocking the river to navigation. Maintenance costs of a massive bridge to allow the world&#x27;s largest ships to navigate under were considered higher than for a tunnel. Similar conclusions were reached for the 1971 Kingsway Tunnel under the Mersey. In Hampton Roads, Virginia, tunnels were chosen over bridges for strategic considerations; in the event of damage, bridges might prevent US Navy vessels from leaving Naval Station Norfolk.

Water-crossing tunnels built instead of bridges include the Seikan Tunnel in Japan; the Holland Tunnel and Lincoln Tunnel between New Jersey and Manhattan in New York City; the Queens-Midtown Tunnel between Manhattan and the borough of Queens on Long Island; the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel between Michigan and Ontario; and the Elizabeth River tunnels between Norfolk and Portsmouth, Virginia; the 1934 River Mersey road Queensway Tunnel; the Western Scheldt Tunnel, Zeeland, Netherlands; and the North Shore Connector tunnel in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Sydney Harbour Tunnel was constructed to provide a second harbour crossing and to alleviate traffic congestion on the Sydney Harbour Bridge, without spoiling the iconic view.

Other reasons for choosing a tunnel instead of a bridge include avoiding difficulties with tides, weather, and shipping during construction (as in the Channel Tunnel), aesthetic reasons (preserving the above-ground view, landscape, and scenery), and also for weight capacity reasons (it may be more feasible to build a tunnel than a sufficiently strong bridge).

Some water crossings are a mixture of bridges and tunnels, such as the Denmark to Sweden link and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel in Virginia.

There are particular hazards with tunnels, especially from vehicle fires when combustion gases can asphyxiate users, as happened at the Gotthard Road Tunnel in Switzerland in 2001. One of the worst railway disasters ever, the Balvano train disaster, was caused by a train stalling in the Armi tunnel in Italy in 1944, killing 426 passengers. Designers try to reduce these risks by installing emergency ventilation systems or isolated emergency escape tunnels parallel to the main passage.

=== Project planning and cost estimates ===
Government funds are often required for the creation of tunnels. When a tunnel is being planned or constructed, economics and politics play a large factor in the decision making process. Civil engineers usually use project management techniques for developing a major structure. Understanding the amount of time the project requires, and the amount of labor and materials needed is a crucial part of project planning. The project duration must be identified using a work breakdown structure and critical path method. Also, the land needed for excavation and construction staging, and the proper machinery must be selected. Large infrastructure projects require millions or even billions of dollars, involving long-term financing, usually through issuance of bonds.

The costs and benefits for an infrastructure such as a tunnel must be identified. Political disputes can occur, as in 2005 when the US House of Representatives approved a $100 million federal grant to build a tunnel under New York Harbor. However, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was not aware of this bill and had not asked for a grant for such a project. Increased taxes to finance a large project may cause opposition.

== Construction ==

Tunnels are dug in types of materials varying from soft clay to hard rock. The method of tunnel construction depends on such factors as the ground conditions, the groundwater conditions, the length and diameter of the tunnel drive, the depth of the tunnel, the logistics of supporting the tunnel excavation, the final use and the shape of the tunnel and appropriate risk management.

There are three basic types of tunnel construction in common use. Cut-and-cover tunnels are constructed in a shallow trench and then covered over. Bored tunnels are constructed in situ, without removing the ground above. Finally, a tube can be sunk into a body of water, which is called an immersed tunnel.

=== Cut-and-cover ===

Cut-and-cover is a simple method of construction for shallow tunnels where a trench is excavated and roofed over with an overhead support system strong enough to carry the load of what is to be built above the tunnel.

There are two basic forms of cut-and-cover tunnelling:
* &quot;Bottom-up method&quot;: A trench is excavated, with ground support as necessary, and the tunnel is constructed in it. The tunnel may be of in situ concrete, precast concrete, precast arches, or corrugated steel arches; in early days brickwork was used. The trench is then carefully back-filled and the surface is reinstated.
* &quot;Top-down method&quot;: Side support walls and capping beams are constructed from ground level by such methods as slurry walling or contiguous bored piling. Only a shallow excavation is needed to construct the tunnel roof using precast beams or in situ concrete sitting on the walls. The surface is then reinstated except for access openings. This allows early reinstatement of roadways, services, and other surface features. Excavation then takes place under the permanent tunnel roof, and the base slab is constructed.

Shallow tunnels are often of the cut-and-cover type (if under water, of the immersed-tube type), while deep tunnels are excavated, often using a tunnelling shield. For intermediate levels, both methods are possible.

Large cut-and-cover boxes are often used for underground metro stations, such as Canary Wharf tube station in London. This construction form generally has two levels, which allows economical arrangements for ticket hall, station platforms, passenger access and emergency egress, ventilation and smoke control, staff rooms, and equipment rooms. The interior of Canary Wharf station has been likened to an underground cathedral, owing to the sheer size of the excavation. This contrasts with many traditional stations on London Underground, where bored tunnels were used for stations and passenger access. Nevertheless, the original parts of the London Underground network, the Metropolitan and District Railways, were constructed using cut-and-cover. These lines pre-dated electric traction and the proximity to the surface was useful to ventilate the inevitable smoke and steam.

A major disadvantage of cut-and-cover is the widespread disruption generated at the surface level during construction. This, and the availability of electric traction, brought about London Underground&#x27;s switch to bored tunnels at a deeper level towards the end of the 19th century.

Prior to the replacement of manual excavation by the use of boring machines, Victorian tunnel excavators developed a specialized method called clay-kicking for digging tunnels in clay-based soils. The clay-kicker lies on a plank at a 45-degree angle away from the working face and rather than a mattock with his hands, inserts with his feet a tool with a cup-like rounded end, then turns the tool with his hands to extract a section of soil, which is then placed on the waste extract.
Clay-kicking is a specialized method developed in the United Kingdom of digging tunnels in strong clay-based soil structures. This method of cut and cover construction required relatively little disturbance of property during the renewal of the United Kingdom&#x27;s then ancient sewerage systems. It was also used during the First World War by Royal Engineer tunnelling companies placing mines beneath German lines, because it was almost silent and so not susceptible to listening methods of detection.

=== Boring machines ===

Tunnel boring machines (TBMs) and associated back-up systems are used to highly automate the entire tunnelling process, reducing tunnelling costs. In certain predominantly urban applications, tunnel boring is viewed as a quick and cost-effective alternative to laying surface rails and roads. Expensive compulsory purchase of buildings and land, with potentially lengthy planning inquiries, is eliminated. Disadvantages of TBMs arise from their usually large size – the difficulty of transporting the large TBM to the site of tunnel construction, or (alternatively) the high cost of assembling the TBM on-site, often within the confines of the tunnel being constructed.

There are a variety of TBM designs that can operate in a variety of conditions, from hard rock to soft water-bearing ground. Some TBMs, the bentonite slurry and earth-pressure balance types, have pressurized compartments at the front end, allowing them to be used in difficult conditions below the water table. This pressurizes the ground ahead of the TBM cutter head to balance the water pressure. The operators work in normal air pressure behind the pressurized compartment, but may occasionally have to enter that compartment to renew or repair the cutters. This requires special precautions, such as local ground treatment or halting the TBM at a position free from water. Despite these difficulties, TBMs are now preferred over the older method of tunnelling in compressed air, with an airlock/decompression chamber some way back from the TBM, which required operators to work in high pressure and go through decompression procedures at the end of their shifts, much like deep-sea divers.

In February 2010, Aker Wirth delivered a TBM to Switzerland, for the expansion of the Linth–Limmern Power Stations located south of Linthal in the canton of Glarus. The borehole has a diameter of . The four TBMs used for excavating the Gotthard Base Tunnel, in Switzerland, had a diameter of about . A larger TBM was built to bore the Green Heart Tunnel (Dutch: Tunnel Groene Hart) as part of the HSL-Zuid in the Netherlands, with a diameter of . This in turn was superseded by the Madrid M30 ringroad, Spain, and the Chong Ming tunnels in Shanghai, China. All of these machines were built at least partly by Herrenknecht. , the world&#x27;s largest TBM was &quot;Big Bertha&quot;, a diameter machine built by Hitachi Zosen Corporation, which dug the Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel in Seattle, Washington (US).

=== Shafts ===

A temporary access shaft is sometimes necessary during the excavation of a tunnel. They are usually circular and go straight down until they reach the level at which the tunnel is going to be built. A shaft normally has concrete walls and is usually built to be permanent. Once the access shafts are complete, TBMs are lowered to the bottom and excavation can start. Shafts are the main entrance in and out of the tunnel until the project is completed. If a tunnel is going to be long, multiple shafts at various locations may be bored so that entrance to the tunnel is closer to the unexcavated area.

Once construction is complete, construction access shafts are often used as ventilation shafts, and may also be used as emergency exits.

=== Sprayed concrete techniques ===
The new Austrian tunnelling method (NATM)—also referred to as the Sequential Excavation Method (SEM)—was developed in the 1960s.
The main idea of this method is to use the geological stress of the surrounding rock mass to stabilize the tunnel, by allowing a measured relaxation and stress reassignment into the surrounding rock to prevent full loads becoming imposed on the supports. Based on geotechnical measurements, an optimal cross section is computed. The excavation is protected by a layer of sprayed concrete, commonly referred to as shotcrete. Other support measures can include steel arches, rock bolts, and mesh. Technological developments in sprayed concrete technology have resulted in steel and polypropylene fibers being added to the concrete mix to improve lining strength. This creates a natural load-bearing ring, which minimizes the rock&#x27;s deformation.

By special monitoring the NATM method is flexible, even at surprising changes of the geomechanical rock consistency during the tunneling work. The measured rock properties lead to appropriate tools for tunnel strengthening.

=== Pipe jacking ===
In pipe jacking, hydraulic jacks are used to push specially made pipes through the ground behind a TBM or shield. This method is commonly used to create tunnels under existing structures, such as roads or railways. Tunnels constructed by pipe jacking are normally small diameter bores with a maximum size of around .

=== Box jacking ===
Box jacking is similar to pipe jacking, but instead of jacking tubes, a box-shaped tunnel is used. Jacked boxes can be a much larger span than a pipe jack, with the span of some box jacks in excess of . A cutting head is normally used at the front of the box being jacked, and spoil removal is normally by excavator from within the box. Recent developments of the Jacked Arch and Jacked deck have enabled longer and larger structures to be installed to close accuracy. 

=== Underwater tunnels ===

There are also several approaches to underwater tunnels, the two most common being bored tunnels or immersed tubes, examples are Bjørvika Tunnel and Marmaray. Submerged floating tunnels are a novel approach under consideration; however, no such tunnels have been constructed to date.

=== Temporary way ===
During construction of a tunnel it is often convenient to install a temporary railway, particularly to remove excavated spoil, often narrow gauge so that it can be double track to allow the operation of empty and loaded trains at the same time. The temporary way is replaced by the permanent way at completion, thus explaining the term &quot;Perway&quot;.

=== Enlargement ===
The vehicles or traffic using a tunnel can outgrow it, requiring replacement or enlargement:
* The original single line Gib Tunnel near Mittagong was replaced with a double-track tunnel, with the original tunnel used for growing mushrooms.
* The 1832 double-track -long tunnel from Edge Hill to Lime Street in Liverpool was near totally removed, apart from a section at Edge Hill and a section nearer to Lime Street, as four tracks were required. The tunnel was dug out into a very deep four-track cutting, with short tunnels in places along the cutting. Train services were not interrupted as the work progressed. There are other occurrences of tunnels being replaced by open cuts, for example, the Auburn Tunnel.
* The Farnworth Tunnel in England was enlarged using a tunnel boring machine (TBM) in 2015. The Rhyndaston Tunnel was enlarged using a borrowed TBM so as to be able to take ISO containers.
* Tunnels can also be enlarged by lowering the floor.

=== Open building pit ===
An open building pit consists of a horizontal and a vertical boundary that keeps groundwater and soil out of the pit. There are several potential alternatives and combinations for (horizontal and vertical) building pit boundaries. The most important difference with cut-and-cover is that the open building pit is muted after tunnel construction; no roof is placed.

=== Other construction methods ===
* Drilling and blasting
* Hydraulic splitter
* Slurry-shield machine
* Wall-cover construction method.

== Variant tunnel types ==

=== Double-deck and multipurpose tunnels ===

Some tunnels are double-deck, for example, the two major segments of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge (completed in 1936) are linked by a double-deck tunnel section through Yerba Buena Island, the largest-diameter bored tunnel in the world. At construction this was a combination bidirectional rail and truck pathway on the lower deck with automobiles above, now converted to one-way road vehicle traffic on each deck.

In Turkey, the Eurasia Tunnel under the Bosphorus, opened in 2016, has at its core a two-deck road tunnel with two lanes on each deck.

Additionally, in 2015 the Turkish government announced that it will build &quot;three&quot;-level tunnel, also under the Bosporus. The tunnel is intended to carry both the Istanbul metro and a two-level highway, over a length of .

The French in west Paris consists of two bored tunnel tubes, the eastern one of which has two levels for light motorized vehicles, over a length of . Although each level offers a physical height of , only traffic up to tall is allowed in this tunnel tube, and motorcyclists are directed to the other tube. Each level was built with a three-lane roadway, but only two lanes per level are used – the third serves as a hard shoulder within the tunnel. The A86 Duplex is Europe&#x27;s longest double-deck tunnel.

In Shanghai, China, a two-tube double-deck tunnel was built starting in 2002. In each tube of the both decks are for motor vehicles. In each direction, only cars and taxis travel on the high two-lane upper deck, and heavier vehicles, like trucks and buses, as well as cars, may use the high single-lane lower level.

In the Netherlands, a two-storey, eight-lane, cut-and-cover road tunnel under the city of Maastricht was opened in 2016. Each level accommodates a full height, two by two-lane highway. The two lower tubes of the tunnel carry the A2 motorway, which originates in Amsterdam, through the city; and the two upper tubes take the N2 regional highway for local traffic.

The Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel, is a $3.3 billion , double-decker bored highway tunnel under Downtown Seattle. Construction began in July 2013 using &quot;Bertha&quot;, at the time the world&#x27;s largest earth pressure balance tunnel boring machine, with a cutterhead diameter. After several delays, tunnel boring was completed in April 2017, and the tunnel opened to traffic on 4 February 2019.

New York City&#x27;s 63rd Street Tunnel under the East River, between the boroughs of Manhattan and Queens, was intended to carry subway trains on the upper level and Long Island Rail Road commuter trains on the lower level. Construction started in 1969, and the two sides of the tunnel were bored through in 1972. The upper level, used by the IND 63rd Street Line () of the New York City Subway, was not opened for passenger service until 1989. The lower level, intended for commuter rail, saw passenger service after completion of the East Side Access project, in late 2022.

In the UK, the 1934 Queensway Tunnel under the River Mersey between Liverpool and Birkenhead was originally to have road vehicles running on the upper deck and trams on the lower. During construction the tram usage was cancelled. The lower section is only used for cables, pipes and emergency accident refuge enclosures.

Hong Kong&#x27;s Lion Rock Tunnel, built in the mid 1960s, connecting New Kowloon and Sha Tin, carries a motorway but also serves as an aqueduct, featuring a gallery containing five water mains lines with diameters between below the road section of the tunnel.

Wuhan&#x27;s Yangtze River Highway and Railway Tunnel is a two-tube double-deck tunnel under the Yangtze River completed in 2018. Each tube carries three lanes of local traffic on the top deck with one track Wuhan Metro Line 7 on the lower deck.

Mount Baker Tunnel has three levels. The bottom level is to be used by Sound Transit light rail. The middle level is used by car traffic, and the top layer is for bicycle and pedestrian access.
Some tunnels have more than one purpose. The SMART Tunnel in Malaysia is the first multipurpose &quot;Stormwater Management And Road Tunnel&quot; in the world, created to convey both traffic and occasional flood waters in Kuala Lumpur. When necessary, floodwater is first diverted into a separate bypass tunnel located &quot;underneath&quot; the double-deck roadway tunnel. In this scenario, traffic continues normally. Only during heavy, prolonged rains when the threat of extreme flooding is high, the upper tunnel tube is closed off to vehicles and automated flood control gates are opened so that water can be diverted through both tunnels.

=== Covered passageways ===
Over-bridges can sometimes be built by covering a road or river or railway with brick or steel arches, and then levelling the surface with earth. In railway parlance, a surface-level track which has been built or covered over is normally called a &quot;covered way&quot;.

Snow sheds are a kind of artificial tunnel built to protect a railway from avalanches of snow. Similarly the Stanwell Park, New South Wales &quot;steel tunnel&quot;, on the Illawarra railway line, protects the line from rockfalls.

=== Underpass ===
An underpass is a road or railway or other passageway passing &quot;under&quot; another road or railway, under an overpass. This is not strictly a tunnel.

=== Utility Tunnel ===
A Utility Tunnel is built for the purpose of carrying one or more utilities in the same space, for this reason they are also referred to as Multi-Utility Tunnels or MUTs. Through co-location of different utilities in one tunnel, organizations are able to reduce the financial and environmental costs of building and maintaining utilities. These tunnels can be used for many types of utilities, routing steam, chilled water, electrical power or telecommunication cables, as well as connecting buildings for convenient passage of people and equipment.

== Safety and security ==

Owing to the enclosed space of a tunnel, fires can have very serious effects on users. The main dangers are gas and smoke production, with even low concentrations of carbon monoxide being highly toxic. Fires killed 11 people in the Gotthard tunnel fire of 2001 for example, all of the victims succumbing to smoke and gas inhalation. Over 400 passengers died in the Balvano train disaster in Italy in 1944, when the locomotive halted in a long tunnel. Carbon monoxide poisoning was the main cause of death. In the Caldecott Tunnel fire of 1982, the majority of fatalities were caused by toxic smoke, rather than by the initial crash. Likewise 84 people were killed in the Paris Métro train fire of 1904.

Motor vehicle tunnels usually require ventilation shafts and powered fans to remove toxic exhaust gases during routine operation.

Rail tunnels usually require fewer air changes per hour, but still may require forced-air ventilation. Both types of tunnels often have provisions to increase ventilation under emergency conditions, such as a fire. Although there is a risk of increasing the rate of combustion through increased airflow, the primary focus is on providing breathable air to persons trapped in the tunnel, as well as firefighters.

The aerodynamic pressure wave produced by high speed trains entering a tunnel reflect at its open ends and change sign (compression wavefront changes to rarefaction wavefront and vice versa). When two wavefronts of the same sign meet the train, significant and rapid air pressure may cause ear discomfort for passengers and crew. When a high-speed train exits a tunnel, a loud &quot;Tunnel boom&quot; may occur, which can disturb residents near the mouth of the tunnel, and it is exacerbated in mountain valleys where the sound can echo.

When there is a parallel, separate tunnel available, airtight but unlocked emergency doors are usually provided which allow trapped personnel to escape from a smoke-filled tunnel to the parallel tube.

Larger, heavily used tunnels, such as the Big Dig tunnel in Boston, Massachusetts, may have a dedicated 24-hour staffed operations center which monitors and reports on traffic conditions, and responds to emergencies. Video surveillance equipment is often used, and real-time pictures of traffic conditions for some highways may be viewable by the general public via the Internet.

A database of seismic damage to underground structures using 217 case histories shows the following general observations can be made regarding the seismic performance of underground structures:

* Underground structures suffer appreciably less damage than surface structures.
* Reported damage decreases with increasing over burden depth. Deep tunnels seem to be safer and less vulnerable to earthquake shaking than are shallow tunnels.
* Underground facilities constructed in soils can be expected to suffer more damage compared to openings constructed in competent rock.
* Lined and grouted tunnels are safer than unlined tunnels in rock. Shaking damage can be reduced by stabilizing the ground around the tunnel and by improving the contact between the lining and the surrounding ground through grouting.
* Tunnels are more stable under a symmetric load, which improves ground-lining interaction. Improving the tunnel lining by placing thicker and stiffer sections without stabilizing surrounding poor ground may result in excess seismic forces in the lining. Backfilling with non-cyclically mobile material and rock-stabilizing measures may improve the safety and stability of shallow tunnels.
* Damage may be related to peak ground acceleration and velocity based on the magnitude and epicentral distance of the affected earthquake.
* Duration of strong-motion shaking during earthquakes is of utmost importance because it may cause fatigue failure and therefore, large deformations.
* High frequency motions may explain the local spalling of rock or concrete along planes of weakness. These frequencies, which rapidly attenuate with distance, may be expected mainly at small distances from the causative fault.
* Ground motion may be amplified upon incidence with a tunnel if wavelengths are between one and four times the tunnel diameter.
* Damage at and near tunnel portals may be significant due to slope instability.

Earthquakes are one of nature&#x27;s most formidable threats. A magnitude 6.7 earthquake shook the San Fernando valley in Los Angeles in 1994. The earthquake caused extensive damage to various structures, including buildings, freeway overpasses and road systems throughout the area. The National Center for Environmental Information estimates total damages to be 40 billion dollars. According to an article issued by Steve Hymon of TheSource – Transportation News and Views, there was no serious damage sustained by the LA subway system. Metro, the owner of the LA subway system, issued a statement through their engineering staff about the design and consideration that goes into a tunnel system. Engineers and architects perform extensive analysis as to how hard they expect earthquakes to hit that area. All of this goes into the overall design and flexibility of the tunnel.

This same trend of limited subway damage following an earthquake can be seen in many other places. In 1985 a magnitude 8.1 earthquake shook Mexico City; there was no damage to the subway system, and in fact the subway systems served as a lifeline for emergency personnel and evacuations. A magnitude 7.2 ripped through Kobe Japan in 1995, leaving no damage to the tunnels themselves. Entry portals sustained minor damages, however these damages were attributed to inadequate earthquake design that originated from the original construction date of 1965. In 2010 a magnitude 8.8, massive by any scale, afflicted Chile. Entrance stations to subway systems suffered minor damages, and the subway system was down for the rest of the day. By the next afternoon, the subway system was operational again.

=== In history ===





The history of ancient tunnels and tunneling in the world is reviewed in various sources which include many examples of these structures that were built for different purposes. Some well known ancient and modern tunnels are briefly introduced below:

* The qanat or kareez of Persia are water management systems used to provide a reliable supply of water to human settlements or for irrigation in hot, arid and semi-arid climates. The deepest known qanat is in the Iranian city of Gonabad, which after 2700 years, still provides drinking and agricultural water to nearly 40,000 people. Its main well depth is more than , and its length is .
* The Siloam Tunnel was built before 701 BC for a reliable supply of water, to withstand siege attacks.
* The Eupalinian aqueduct on the island of Samos (North Aegean, Greece) was built in 520 BC by the ancient Greek engineer Eupalinos of Megara under a contract with the local community. Eupalinos organised the work so that the tunnel was begun from both sides of Mount Kastro. The two teams advanced simultaneously and met in the middle with excellent accuracy, something that was extremely difficult in that time. The aqueduct was of utmost defensive importance, since it ran underground, and it was not easily found by an enemy who could otherwise cut off the water supply to Pythagoreion, the ancient capital of Samos. The tunnel&#x27;s existence was recorded by Herodotus (as was the mole and harbour, and the third wonder of the island, the great temple to Hera, thought by many to be the largest in the Greek world). The precise location of the tunnel was only re-established in the 19th century by German archaeologists. The tunnel proper is and visitors can still enter it.
* One of the first known drainage and sewage networks in form of tunnels was constructed at Persepolis in Iran at the same time as the construction of its foundation in 518 BC. In most places the network was dug in the sound rock of the mountain and then covered by large pieces of rock and stone followed by earth and piles of rubble to level the ground. During investigations and surveys, long sections of similar rock tunnels extending beneath the palace area were traced by Herzfeld and later by Schmidt and their archaeological teams.
* The Via Flaminia, an important Roman road, penetrated the Furlo pass in the Apennines through a tunnel which emperor Vespasian had ordered built in 76–77 AD. A modern road, the SS 3 Flaminia, still uses this tunnel, which had a precursor dating back to the 3rd century BC, remnants of this earlier tunnel (one of the first road tunnels) are also still visible.
* The world&#x27;s oldest tunnel traversing under a water body is claimed to be the &quot;Terelek kaya tüneli&quot; under Kızıl River, a little south of the towns of Boyabat and Durağan in Turkey, just downstream from where Kizil River joins its tributary Gökırmak. The tunnel is presently under a narrow part of a lake formed by a dam some kilometres further downstream. Estimated to have been built more than 2000 years ago, possibly by the same civilization that also built the royal tombs in a rock face nearby, it is assumed to have had a defensive purpose.
* Sapperton Canal Tunnel on the Thames and Severn Canal in England, dug through hills, which opened in 1789, was long and allowed boat transport of coal and other goods. Above it the Sapperton Long Tunnel was constructed which carries the &quot;Golden Valley&quot; railway line between Swindon and Gloucester.
* The 1791 Dudley canal tunnel is on the Dudley Canal, in Dudley, England. The tunnel is long. Closed in 1962 the tunnel was reopened in 1973. The series of tunnels was extended in 1984 and 1989.
* Fritchley Tunnel, constructed in 1793 in Derbyshire by the Butterley Company to transport limestone to its ironworks factory. The Butterley company engineered and built its own railway. A victim of the depression the company closed after 219 years in 2009. The tunnel is the world&#x27;s oldest railway tunnel traversed by rail wagons. Gravity and horse haulage was utilised. The railway was converted to steam locomotion in 1813 using a Steam Horse locomotive engineered and built by the Butterley company, however reverted to horses. Steam trains used the tunnel continuously from the 1840s when the railway was converted to a narrow gauge. The line closed in 1933. In the Second World War, the tunnel was used as an air raid shelter. Sealed up in 1977 it was rediscovered in 2013 and inspected. The tunnel was resealed to preserved the construction as it was designated an ancient monument.
* The 1794 Butterley canal tunnel canal tunnel is in length on the Cromford Canal in Ripley, Derbyshire, England. The tunnel was built simultaneously with the 1793 Fritchley railway tunnel. The tunnel partially collapsed in 1900 splitting the Cromford Canal, and has not been used since. The Friends of Cromford Canal, a group of volunteers, are working at fully restoring the Cromford Canal and the Butterley Tunnel.
* The 1796 Stoddart Tunnel in Chapel-en-le-Frith in Derbyshire is reputed to be the oldest rail tunnel in the world. The rail wagons were originally horse-drawn.
* Derby Tunnels in Salem, Massachusetts, were built in 1801 to smuggle imports affected by President Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s new customs duties. Jefferson had ordered local militias to help the Custom House in each port collect these dues, but the smugglers, led by Elias Derby, hired the Salem militia to dig the tunnels and hide the spoil.
* A tunnel was created for the first true steam locomotive, from Penydarren to Abercynon. The Penydarren locomotive was built by Richard Trevithick. The locomotive made the historic journey from Penydarren to Abercynon in 1804. Part of this tunnel can still be seen at Pentrebach, Merthyr Tydfil, Wales. This is arguably the oldest railway tunnel in the world, dedicated only to self-propelled steam engines on rails.
* The Montgomery Bell Tunnel in Tennessee, an water diversion tunnel, , to power a water wheel, was built by slave labour in 1819, being the first full-scale tunnel in North America.
* Bourne&#x27;s Tunnel, Rainhill, near Liverpool, England. It is long. Built in the late 1820s, the exact date is unknown, however probably built in 1828 or 1829. This is the first tunnel in the world constructed under a railway line. The construction of the Liverpool to Manchester Railway ran over a horse-drawn tramway that ran from the Sutton collieries to the Liverpool-Warrington turnpike road. A tunnel was bored under the railway for the tramway. As the railway was being constructed the tunnel was made operational, opening prior to the Liverpool tunnels on the Liverpool to Manchester line. The tunnel was made redundant in 1844 when the tramway was dismantled.
* Crown Street station, Liverpool, England, 1829. Built by George Stephenson, a single track railway tunnel , was bored from Edge Hill to Crown Street to serve the world&#x27;s first intercity passenger railway terminus station. The station was abandoned in 1836 being too far from Liverpool city centre, with the area converted for freight use. Closed down in 1972, the tunnel is disused. However it is the oldest passenger rail tunnel running under streets in the world.
* The 1829 Wapping Tunnel in Liverpool, England, at long on a twin track railway, was the first rail tunnel bored under a metropolis. The tunnel&#x27;s path is from Edge Hill in the east of the city to Wapping Dock in the south end Liverpool docks. The tunnel was used only for freight terminating at the Park Lane goods terminal. Currently disused since 1972, the tunnel was to be a part of the Merseyrail metro network, with work started and abandoned because of costs. The tunnel is in excellent condition and is still being considered for reuse by Merseyrail, maybe with an underground station cut into the tunnel for Liverpool university. The river portal is opposite the new King&#x27;s Dock Liverpool Arena being an ideal location for a serving station. If reused the tunnel will be the oldest used underground rail tunnel in the world and oldest section of any underground metro system.
* 1832, Lime Street railway station tunnel, Liverpool. A two track rail tunnel, long was bored under the metropolis from Edge Hill in the east of the city to Lime Street in Liverpool&#x27;s city centre. The tunnel was in use from 1832 being used to transport building materials to the new Lime St station while under construction. The station and tunnel was opened to passengers in 1836. In the 1880s the tunnel was converted to a deep cutting, open to the atmosphere, being four tracks wide. This is the only occurrence of a major tunnel being removed. Two short sections of the original tunnel still exist at Edge Hill station and further towards Lime Street, giving the two tunnels the distinction of being the oldest rail tunnels in the world still in use, and the oldest in use under streets. Over time a section of the deep cutting has been converted back into tunnel due to sections having buildings built over. 
* Box Tunnel in England, which opened in 1841, was the longest railway tunnel in the world at the time of construction. It was dug by hand, and has a length of .
* The 1842 Prince of Wales Tunnel, in Shildon near Darlington, England, is the oldest sizeable tunnel in the world still in use under a settlement.
* The Victoria Tunnel Newcastle opened in 1842, is a subterranean wagonway with a maximum depth of that drops from entrance to exit. The tunnel runs under Newcastle upon Tyne, England, and originally exited at the River Tyne. It remains largely intact. Originally designed to carry coal from Spital Tongues to the river, in WW2 part of the tunnel was used as a shelter. Under the management of a charitable foundation called the Ouseburn Trust it is currently used for heritage tours.
* The Thames Tunnel, built by Marc Isambard Brunel and his son Isambard Kingdom Brunel opened in 1843, was the first tunnel (after Terelek) traversing under a water body, and the first to be built using a tunnelling shield. Originally used as a foot-tunnel, the tunnel was converted to a railway tunnel in 1869 and was a part of the East London Line of the London Underground until 2007. It was the oldest section of the network, although not the oldest purpose built rail section. From 2010 the tunnel became a part of the London Overground network.
* The Victoria Tunnel/Waterloo Tunnel in Liverpool, England, was bored under a metropolis opening in 1848. The tunnel was initially used only for rail freight serving the Waterloo Freight terminal, and later freight and passengers serving the Liverpool ship liner terminal. The tunnel&#x27;s path is from Edge Hill in the east of the city to the north end Liverpool docks at Waterloo Dock. The tunnel is split into two tunnels with a short open air cutting linking the two. The cutting is where the cable hauled trains from Edge Hill were hitched and unhitched. The two tunnels are effectively one on the same centre line and are regarded as one. However, as initially the long Victoria section was originally cable hauled and the shorter Waterloo section was locomotive hauled, two separate names were given, the short section was named the Waterloo Tunnel. In 1895 the two tunnels were converted to locomotive haulage. Used until 1972, the tunnel is still in excellent condition. A short section of the Victoria tunnel at Edge Hill is still used for shunting trains. The tunnel is being considered for reuse by the Merseyrail network. Stations cut into the tunnel are being considered and also reuse by a monorail system from the proposed Liverpool Waters redevelopment of Liverpool&#x27;s Central Docks has been proposed.
* The summit tunnel of the Semmering railway, the first Alpine tunnel, was opened in 1848 and was long. It connected rail traffic between Vienna, the capital of Austro-Hungarian Empire, and Trieste, its port.
* The Giovi Rail Tunnel through the Appennini Mounts opened in 1854, linking the capital city of the Kingdom of Sardinia, Turin, to its port, Genoa. The tunnel was long.
* The oldest underground sections of the London Underground were built using the cut-and-cover method in the 1860s, and opened in January 1863. What are now the Metropolitan, Hammersmith &amp; City and Circle lines were the first to prove the success of a metro or subway system.
*On 18 June 1868, the Central Pacific Railroad&#x27;s Summit Tunnel (Tunnel #6) at Donner Pass in the California Sierra Nevada mountains was opened, permitting the establishment of the commercial mass transportation of passengers and freight over the Sierras for the first time. It remained in daily use until 1993, when the Southern Pacific Railroad closed it and transferred all rail traffic through the long Tunnel #41 (a.k.a. &quot;The Big Hole&quot;) built a mile to the south in 1925.
* In 1870, after fourteen years of works, the Fréjus Rail Tunnel was completed between France and Italy, being the second-oldest Alpine tunnel, long. At that time it was the longest in the world.
* The third Alpine tunnel, the Gotthard Rail Tunnel, between northern and southern Switzerland, opened in 1882 and was the longest rail tunnel in the world, measuring .
* The 1882 Col de Tende Road Tunnel, at long, was one of the first long road tunnels under a pass, running between France and Italy.
* The Mersey Railway tunnel opened in 1886, running from Liverpool to Birkenhead under the River Mersey. The Mersey Railway was the world&#x27;s first deep-level underground railway. By 1892 the extensions on land from Birkenhead Park station to Liverpool Central Low level station gave a tunnel in length. The under river section is in length, and was the longest underwater tunnel in world in January 1886.
* The rail Severn Tunnel was opened in late 1886, at long, although only of the tunnel is actually under the River Severn. The tunnel replaced the Mersey Railway tunnel&#x27;s longest under water record, which was held for less than a year.
* James Greathead, in constructing the City &amp; South London Railway tunnel beneath the Thames, opened in 1890, brought together three key elements of tunnel construction under water: 
*#shield method of excavation; 
*#permanent cast iron tunnel lining; 
*#construction in a compressed air environment to inhibit water flowing through soft ground material into the tunnel heading.
* Built in sections between 1890 and 1939, the section of London Underground&#x27;s Northern line from Morden to East Finchley via Bank was the longest railway tunnel in the world at in length.
* St. Clair Tunnel, also opened later in 1890, linked the elements of the Greathead tunnels on a larger scale.
* In 1906 the fourth Alpine tunnel opened, the Simplon Tunnel, between Switzerland and Italy. It is long, and was the longest tunnel in the world until 1982. It was also the deepest tunnel in the world, with a maximum rock overlay of approximately .
* The 1927 Holland Tunnel was the first underwater tunnel designed for automobiles. The construction required a novel ventilation system.
* In 1945 the Delaware Aqueduct tunnel was completed, supplying water to New York City. At it is the longest tunnel in the world.
* In 1988 the long Seikan Tunnel in Japan was completed under the Tsugaru Strait, linking the islands of Honshu and Hokkaido. It was the longest railway tunnel in the world at that time.
* Ryfast is the longest undersea road tunnel. It is in length. The tunnel opened for use in 2020.

* The longest canal tunnel is the Rove Tunnel in France, over long.

=== Notable ===


* The Moffat Tunnel, opened in 1928, passes under the Continental Divide of the Americas in Colorado. The tunnel is long and at an elevation of is the highest active railroad tunnel in the U.S. (The inactive Tennessee Pass Line and the historic Alpine Tunnel are higher.)
* Williamson&#x27;s tunnels in Liverpool, from 1804 and completed around 1840 by a wealthy eccentric, are probably the largest underground folly in the world. The tunnels were built with no functional purpose. 
* The Chicago freight tunnel network is the largest urban street tunnel network, comprising of tunnels beneath the majority of downtown Chicago streets. It operated between 1906 and 1956 as a freight network, connecting building basements and railway stations. Following a 1992 flood the network was sealed, although some parts still carry utility and communications infrastructure.
* The Pennsylvania Turnpike opened in 1940 with seven tunnels, most of which were bored as part of the stillborn South Pennsylvania Railroad and giving the highway the nickname &quot;Tunnel Highway&quot;. Four of the tunnels (Allegheny Mountain, Tuscarora Mountain, Kittatinny Mountain, and Blue Mountain) remain in active use, while the other three (Laurel Hill, Rays Hill, and Sideling Hill) were bypassed in the 1960s; the latter two tunnels are on a bypassed section of the Turnpike now commonly known as the Abandoned Pennsylvania Turnpike.
* The Fredhälls road tunnel was opened in 1966, in Stockholm, Sweden, and the New Elbe road tunnel opened in 1975 in Hamburg, Germany. Both tunnels handle around 150,000 vehicles a day, making them two of the most trafficked tunnels in the world.
* The Honningsvåg Tunnel ( long) opened in 1999 on European route E69 in Norway as the world&#x27;s northernmost road tunnel, except for mines (which exist on Svalbard).
* The Central Artery road tunnel in Boston, Massachusetts, is a part of the larger Big Dig completed around 2007, and carries approximately 200,000 vehicles/day under the city along Interstate 93, US Route 1, and Massachusetts Route 3, which share a concurrency through the tunnels. The Big Dig replaced Boston&#x27;s old badly deteriorated I-93 elevated highway.
* The Stormwater Management And Road Tunnel or SMART Tunnel, is a combined storm drainage and road structure opened in 2007 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The tunnel is the longest stormwater drainage tunnel in South East Asia and second longest in Asia. The facility can be operated as a simultaneous traffic and stormwater passage, or dedicated exclusively to stormwater when necessary.
* The Eiksund Tunnel on national road Rv 653 in Norway is the world&#x27;s deepest subsea road tunnel, measuring long, with deepest point at below the sea level, opened in February 2008.
* Gerrards Cross railway tunnel, in England, opened in 2010, is notable in that it converted an existing railway cutting into a tunnel to create ground to build a supermarket over the tunnel. The railway in the cutting was first opened around 1906, stretching over 104 years to complete a railway tunnel. The tunnel was built using the cover method with craned in prefabricated forms in order to keep the busy railway operating. A branch of the Tesco supermarket chain occupies the newly created ground above the railway tunnel, with an adjacent existing railway station at the end of the tunnel. During construction, a portion of the tunnel collapsed when soil cover was added. The prefabricated forms were covered with a layer of reinforced concrete after the collapse.
* The Fenghuoshan tunnel, completed in 2005 on the Qinghai-Tibet railway is the world&#x27;s highest railway tunnel, about above sea level and long.
* The La Linea Tunnel in Colombia, 2016, is the longest, , mountain tunnel in South America. It crosses beneath a mountain at above sea level with six traffic lanes, and it has a parallel emergency tunnel. The tunnel is subject to serious groundwater pressure. The tunnel will link Bogotá and its urban area with the coffee-growing region, and with the main port on the Colombian Pacific coast.
* The Chicago Deep Tunnel Project is a network of of drainage tunnels designed to reduce flooding in the Chicago area. Started in the mid-1970s, the project is due to be completed in 2029.
* New York City Water Tunnel No. 3, started in 1970, has an expected completion beyond 2026, and will measure more than .

== Mining ==
The use of tunnels for mining is called drift mining. Drift mining can help find coal, goal, iron, and other minerals, just like normal mining.

Sub-surface mining consists of digging tunnels or shafts into the earth to reach buried ore deposits.

== Military use ==

Some tunnels are not for transport at all but rather, are fortifications, for example Mittelwerk and Cheyenne Mountain Complex. Excavation techniques, as well as the construction of underground bunkers and other habitable areas, are often associated with military use during armed conflict, or civilian responses to threat of attack. Another use for tunnels was for the storage of chemical weapons .

== Secret tunnels ==
Secret tunnels have given entrance to or escape from an area, such as the Cu Chi Tunnels or the smuggling tunnels in the Gaza Strip which connect it to Egypt. Although the Underground Railroad network used to transport escaped slaves was &quot;underground&quot; mostly in the sense of secrecy, hidden tunnels were occasionally used. Secret tunnels were also used during the Cold War, under the Berlin Wall and elsewhere, to smuggle refugees, and for espionage.

Smugglers use secret tunnels to transport or store contraband, such as illegal drugs and weapons. Elaborately engineered tunnels built to smuggle drugs across the Mexico-US border were estimated to require up to 9 months to complete, and an expenditure of up to $1 million. Some of these tunnels were equipped with lighting, ventilation, telephones, drainage pumps, hydraulic elevators, and in at least one instance, an electrified rail transport system. Secret tunnels have also been used by thieves to break into bank vaults and retail stores after hours. Several tunnels have been discovered by the Border Security Forces across the Line of Control along the India-Pakistan border, mainly to allow terrorists access to the Indian territory of Jammu and Kashmir.

The actual usage of erdstall tunnels is unknown but theories connect it to a rebirth ritual.

== Natural tunnels ==

* Lava tubes are emptied lava conduits, formed during volcanic eruptions by flowing and cooling lava.
* Natural Tunnel State Park (Virginia, US) features an natural tunnel, really a limestone cave, that has been used as a railroad tunnel since 1890.
* Punarjani Guha in Kerala, India. Hindus believe that crawling through the tunnel (which they believe was created by a Hindu god) from one end to the other will wash away all of one&#x27;s sins and thus allow one to attain rebirth. Only men are permitted to crawl through the tunnel.
* Torghatten, a Norwegian island with a hat-shaped silhouette, has a natural tunnel in the middle of the hat, letting light come through. The long, high, and wide tunnel is said to be the hole made by an arrow of the angry troll Hestmannen, the hill being the hat of the troll-king of Sømna trying to save the beautiful Lekamøya. The tunnel is thought actually to be the work of ice. The sun shines through the tunnel during two few minutes long periods every year.

<text>Plain old telephone service (POTS), or publicly offered telephone service, is a retronym for voice-grade telephone service that employs analog signal transmission over copper loops. The term POTS originally stood for post office telephone service, as early telephone lines in many regions were operated directly by local post offices. For instance, in New Zealand, the telephone system remained under Post Office control until the 1980s.

POTS was the standard service offering from telephone companies in the United States from 1876 until 1988, when the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) Basic Rate Interface (BRI) was introduced, followed by the development of cellular telephone systems and voice over internet protocol (VoIP).

Despite the advent of these technologies, POTS remains a basic form of residential and small business connection to the telephone network in many parts of the world. The term encapsulates a technology that has been available since the introduction of the public telephone system in the late 19th century, remaining largely unchanged despite the introduction of innovations such as Touch-Tone dialing, electronic telephone exchanges and fiber-optic communication into the public switched telephone network (PSTN).

==Characteristics==
Modern, automated POTS is characterized by several aspects:
*Bi-directional (full duplex) communications.
*Using balanced signaling of voltage analogs of sound pressure waves on a two-wire copper loop
*Restricted to a narrow frequency range of 300–3,300 Hz, called the voiceband, which is much less than the human hearing range of 20–20,000 Hz
*Call-progress tones, such as dial tone and ringing tone
*Pulse dialing and dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF)
*BORSCHT functions: battery feed (B), over-voltage protection (O), ringing (R), signaling (S), coding (C), hybrid (H), and test (T)
*Loop start, ground start and E&amp;M signalling

The pair of wires from the central office switch to a subscriber&#x27;s home is called a subscriber loop. It carries a direct current (DC) voltage at a nominal voltage of −48V when the receiver is on-hook, supplied by a power conversion system in the central office. This power conversion system is backed up with a bank of batteries, resulting in continuation of service during interruption of power to the customer supplied by their electrical utility.

The maximum resistance of the loop is 1,700ohms, which translates into a maximum loop length of using standard 24-gauge wire. (Longer loops are often constructed with larger, lower-resistance 19-gauge wire and/or specialized central office equipment called a &quot;loop extender&quot;. They may be or more.)

Many calling features became available to telephone subscribers after computerization of telephone exchanges during the 1980s in the United States. The services include voicemail, caller ID, call waiting, speed dialing, conference calls (three-way calling), enhanced 911, and Centrex services.

The communication circuits of the public switched telephone network continue to be modernized by advances in digital communications; however, other than improving sound quality, these changes have been mainly transparent to customers. In most cases, the function of the local loop presented to the customer for connection to telephone equipment is practically unchanged and remains compatible with pulse dialing telephones.

Due to the wide availability of traditional telephone services, new types of communications devices, such as modems and fax machines, were initially designed to use traditional analog telephony to transmit digital information.

==Reliability==
Although POTS provides limited features, low bandwidth, and no mobile capabilities, it provides greater reliability than other telephony systems (mobile phone, VoIP, etc.). Many telephone service providers attempt to achieve dial-tone availability more than 99.999% of the time the telephone is taken off-hook. This is an often cited benchmark in marketing and systems-engineering comparisons, called the &quot;five nines&quot; reliability standard. It is equivalent to having a dial-tone available for all but about five minutes each year.
However, POTS depends upon a hardwired connection from each household to the phone company. Many new housing developments are being offered which do not have such a connection so these homes depend upon a VOIP non-hardwired linkage to the phone company. Thus they are dependent upon home internet service which can fail for several reasons.

VoIP generally depends on power provided at the customer site, compared to POTS providers powering simple telephones directly through the lines. For this reason, VoIP systems often have local battery backup to allow them to continue working through local power failures.

<text>Mayo Clinic () is a private American academic medical center focused on integrated healthcare, education, and research. It maintains three major campuses in Rochester, Minnesota; Jacksonville, Florida; and Phoenix/Scottsdale, Arizona.

Mayo Clinic employs over 7,300 physicians and scientists, along with another 66,000 administrative and allied health staff. The practice specializes in treating difficult cases through tertiary care and destination medicine. It is home to the top-15 ranked Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine in addition to many of the highest regarded residency education programs in the United States. It spends over $660 million a year on research and has more than 3,000 full-time research personnel.

William Worrall Mayo settled his family in Rochester in 1864 and opened a sole proprietorship medical practice that evolved under his sons, Will and Charlie Mayo, along with practice partners Stinchfield, Graham, Plummer, Millet, Judd, and Balfour, into Mayo Clinic. Today, in addition to the hospital at Rochester, Mayo Clinic has major campuses in Arizona and Florida. Most recently, in 2020, the Mayo Clinic bought a facility in central London, UK. The Mayo Clinic Health System also operates affiliated facilities throughout Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa.

Mayo Clinic has been ranked number one in the United States for seven consecutive years in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; Best Hospitals Honor Roll, maintaining a position at or near the top for more than 35 years. It has been on the list of &quot;100 Best Companies to Work For&quot; published by &quot; Fortune&quot; magazine for fourteen consecutive years and has continued to achieve this ranking through 2017. Drawing in patients from around the globe, Mayo Clinic performs near the highest number of transplants in the country, including both solid organ and hematologic transplantation.

== Operations ==
Mayo Clinic is a nonprofit hospital system with campuses in Rochester, Minnesota; Scottsdale and Phoenix, Arizona; and Jacksonville, Florida. Mayo Clinic employs 76,000 people, including more than 7,300 physicians and clinical residents and over 66,000 allied health staff, as of 2022. In addition, Mayo Clinic partially owns and operates the Mayo Clinic Health System, which consists of more than 70 hospitals and clinics across Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Mayo Clinic also operates the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, a nonprofit college dedicated to training medical and allied health professionals at Mayo Hospitals in Minnesota, Arizona, and Florida.

The clinic created an independent business subsidiary in London in partnership with Oxford University Clinic, a collaboration between the University of Oxford and Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust to operate a clinic starting in 2019.

Mayo Clinic is led by president and CEO Gianrico Farrugia, M.D. John H. Noseworthy, M.D., retired as president and CEO in December 2018; his predecessor, Denis A. Cortese, M.D., retired in November 2009. Michael Powell, former chair of the Federal Communications Commission, is chair of Mayo&#x27;s governing board of trustees.
=== Clinical practice ===
In 2022, more than 1.3 million different patients from all 50 states and 138 countries were seen at Mayo Clinic facilities.

=== Research ===
Mayo Clinic researchers contribute to understanding disease processes, best clinical practices, and translating findings from the laboratory to clinical practice. research personnel included about 5,500 physicians and scientists. Mayo Clinic&#x27;s 2022 research funding exceeded $1 billion. These research initiatives led to 9,275 research publications and review articles in peer-reviewed journals.

=== Education ===
The Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science (MCCMS), established in 1915, offers educational programs embedded in Mayo Clinic&#x27;s clinical practice and biomedical research activities. MCCMS consists of five accredited schools:

* Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine provides training for medical students seeking a medical degree (M.D.).
* Mayo Clinic School of Graduate Medical Education, established in 1915, offers more than 300 residences and fellowships in all medical and surgical specialties with 1,791 active trainees.
* Mayo Clinic School of Health Sciences provides training in 60 health sciences career fields.
* Mayo Clinic School of Continuous Professional Development provides continuing education for practicing medical professionals.
* Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences is for graduate students (master&#x27;s degree, M.D.-Ph.D., or Ph.D.) pursuing biomedical research training.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
Mayo Clinic originated with the medical practice of William Worrall Mayo, M.D. (1819–1911). Born near Manchester, England, he was mentored by the eminent British scientist John Dalton and immigrated to the United States in 1846. He worked his way west, earning two medical degrees at a time when formal education for physicians was limited. Mayo settled in Indiana, and he married Louise Abigail Wright in 1851. They moved to Minnesota Territory in 1854, seeking a more healthful climate. The family relocated within Minnesota several times until Mayo&#x27;s appointment as an examining surgeon for the Union Army military draft board during the American Civil War brought them to Rochester. On January 27, 1864, Mayo advertised in the &quot;Rochester City Post&quot; the opening of a private medical practice &quot;over the Union Drug Store on Third Street&quot; with &quot;all calls answered by day or night&quot;.

Both of W. W. Mayo&#x27;s sons, William James Mayo (1861–1939) and Charles Horace Mayo (1865–1939), who became known as Dr. Will and Dr. Charlie, grew up in Rochester and attended medical school. William graduated in 1883 and joined his father&#x27;s practice, with Charles joining in 1888.
On August 21, 1883, a tornado struck Rochester, causing at least 37 deaths and over 200 injuries. One-third of the town was destroyed, but the Mayo family escaped serious harm. Relief efforts began immediately in a variety of makeshift facilities. Mayo was placed in charge of organizing medical care for the wounded survivors. Needing nurses, he reached out to Mother Alfred Moes, the founder of the Sisters of Saint Francis of Rochester, Minnesota (a teaching order).

After the crisis subsided, Mother Alfred approached W. W. Mayo with a proposal: The Sisters of St. Francis would raise funds to build a hospital in Rochester if he and his sons provided medical and surgical care. The agreement was made over a handshake. On September 30, 1889, Saint Mary&#x27;s Hospital was opened by the Sisters with the three Mayo physicians on staff.

=== Group practice ===
The growing specialization of medicine and the expanding use of railroads, automobiles, and mass communications provided context for the development of integrated multi-specialty practice.

Starting in the 1890s, the Mayo brothers welcomed other physicians to join them. W. W. Mayo&#x27;s solo practice had evolved into a family practice with his sons&#x27; participation which then became a group practice with other medical colleagues. Mayo Clinic&#x27;s first partners were physicians Augustus W. Stinchfield, Christopher Graham, Melvin C. Millet, Henry Plummer, E. Star Judd, and Donald Balfour.

Preeminent among the early physicians who joined the practice was Henry Stanley Plummer, M.D. A specialist in thyroid disease, he made contributions to the treatment of goiter. In terms of organizational development, he collaborated with the Mayo brothers in coordinating the introduction of specialties that expanded the scope of the Mayo practice beyond its origins in surgery. A polymath whose interests included architecture, engineering, and art, Plummer also created many of the systems and procedures that remain central to Mayo Clinic today, such as the integrated &quot;dossier&quot; medical record.

=== Growth and national expansion ===
The Mayo brothers both served as president of the American Medical Association and achieved recognition as surgeons. In 1919, the brothers and their wives donated the assets of the medical practice including land, buildings, and equipment, as well as the majority of their life savings, to transform the private partnership into a not-for-profit organization.

Following World War II, Mayo Clinic continued to expand in Rochester, Minnesota. In 1972, the Mayo Medical School (now Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine) opened.

In 1986, Mayo Clinic formally united with Saint Marys Hospital and Rochester Methodist Hospital. That same year, Mayo Clinic expanded to Florida partly because of a donation of 400 acres of land in Jacksonville from the Davis family. This was followed by expansion to Scottsdale, Arizona, in 1987; the Phoenix, Arizona, campus opened in 1998. In 1992, Mayo Clinic Health System began as a network of community-based medical services in Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin. In 2011, Mayo Clinic launched the Mayo Clinic Care Network, a collection of facilities with access to Mayo Clinic protocols and experts.

In November 2019, the Mayo Clinic, in a joint partnership with SEHA Abu Dhabi Health Services Co, invested $50 million into a 741-bed hospital in the United Arab Emirates for a 25% stake.

At the beginning of 2020, the Mayo Clinic opened a health clinic in central London, in partnership with Oxford University Clinic. It was officially named Mayo Clinic Healthcare. In July 2020 it was reported that the Mayo Clinic had bought Oxford University Clinic&#x27;s share of the facility, to become the sole owner and its first overseas clinic operated as a Mayo Clinic entity.

=== Contributions to medicine and science ===
In the early 20th century, Henry Plummer developed Mayo Clinic&#x27;s multi-specialty group practice model and an integrated medical record system. Plummer&#x27;s system allowed physicians to share patient information better. Before Plummer&#x27;s system, physicians worked solo. They shared patient information when necessary, either verbally or by letter. Plummer also helped design and fabricate building systems innovations, such as steam sterilization rooms, metal surgical tools and equipment, pneumatic tube systems, and knee operated sinks. In 1905, Mayo Clinic advanced a technique of using frozen tissue during surgery to determine if a patient had cancer while the patient was still in the operating room. Mayo Clinic offered the first graduate medical education program in 1915 and the first nonprofit practice aligned with medical education and research. In the 1920s, Albert Compton Broders of the Mayo Clinic created the first index to grade tumors. Mayo Clinic opened the first hospital-based blood bank in Rochester in 1935. Early in Mayo Clinic&#x27;s history, the hospital designed the one-legged mobile instrument stand known as the Mayo stand.

In the 1930s, Mayo Clinic associates Walter M. Boothby, Randolph Lovelace, and Arthur H. Bulbulian developed a high-altitude oxygen therapy mask known as the BLB flight mask.

During World War II, the U.S. Army tasked Mayo Clinic with finding a solution for dying pilots after suffering blackouts. Mayo Clinic hired a team of physicians to research and define the specific physiologic effects causing blackout and unconsciousness during high G forces. Physiologists Earl H. Wood, Edward Baldes, Charles Code, and Edward H. Lambert developed the G-suit with air bladders that prevented blood from pooling in pilots&#x27; legs. The suit was worn by U.S. pilots toward the end of World War II.

Two Mayo Clinic physicians were among three people awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1950 for the discovery of cortisone. Professor Edward C. Kendall, Ph.D., and Philip S. Hench of Mayo Clinic were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine alongside Tadeus Reichstein, a Swiss chemist who conducted independent research, for the discovery. They separated and identified compounds from the adrenal cortex that produced cortisone and hydrocortisone. Later in the decade, Mayo Clinic began using and refining the Gibbon heart–lung machine in cardiac surgery. It is now known as the Mayo–Gibbon heart–lung machine.

Mayo Clinic associates Edward Howard Lambert, Lealdes (Lee) McKendree Eaton, and Edward Douglas Rooke were the first physicians to substantially describe the clinic and electrophysiological findings of what is known as Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome in 1956. In 1972, the clustering of LEMS with other autoimmune diseases led to the hypothesis that it was caused by autoimmunity.

In 1969, Mayo Clinic doctors performed the first Food and Drug Administration-approved hip replacement in the United States. In 1973, Mayo Clinic bought the first CT scanner in the U.S.

Mayo Clinic and Roche Molecular Biochemicals developed a rapid DNA test in 2001 to detect anthrax in humans and in the environment.

The Mayo Clinic Center for Innovation, was established in 2008 and has since worked on over 270 projects.

In 2013, Mayo Clinic specialists in regenerative medicine began the &quot;first-in-human study,&quot; whereby patient cells are used to attempt to heal heart damage.

After several years of using Apple Inc.&#x27;s Macintosh computers and mobile devices for patient care and test results, Mayo partnered with Apple in 2014 to develop the Apple Health and HealthKit apps as a central location for personal health information. Mayo Clinic and Delos Living launched the Well Living Lab in September 2015. This research facility is designed to simulate real-world, non-hospital environments, allowing Mayo Clinic researchers to study the interaction between indoor spaces and human health.

Mayo Clinic&#x27;s Advanced Care at Home Model of Care launched in 2020 and assists patients in their own homes through virtual care.

In 2020, Mayo Clinic began running a federally sponsored Expanded Access Program for Convalescent Plasma to treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the United States.

In 2018, Mayo Clinic and UCLA used spinal cord stimulation and physical therapy that allowed a man paralyzed since 2013 to briefly regain his ability to stand and walk with assistance. The patient was able to walk 111 yards for a total of 16 minutes when given artificial electrical stimulation, although he was unable to continue that mobility once the artificial stimulation was removed. The results were published in the journal Nature Medicine.

As of 2023, Mayo Clinic had treated more than 10,000 patients with proton beam therapy across two of its facilities. According to Post-Bulletin reporting, proton beam therapy is limited in the U.S., with only 2 percent of radiation patients being treated with the technology.

=== Architecture and art collection ===
As the practice grew in the 20th century, it required additional space. Saint Mary&#x27;s Hospital underwent frequent expansion. Rochester business leader John Kahler built innovative hotel-hospital facilities that served Mayo Clinic patients. In 1914, Mayo Clinic opened the world&#x27;s first building expressly designed for multispecialty group practice, known as the 1914 &quot;red brick&quot; building. It facilitated ease of movement for patients and staff among specialty areas, brought research and education functions into proximity with clinical practice, and patient amenities. This approach was replicated and enhanced with the adjoining 1928 Mayo Clinic building, later named for Plummer, its principal designer, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The General hospital features bronze entry doors designed by artist Charles Brioschi. Each 16-foot high, 5.25-inch thick door weighs 4,000 pounds and features ornamental panels. The doors are closed to memorialize important historical events and influential people, such as the deaths of the Mayo brothers, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The 1914 &quot;red brick&quot; building, a National Historic Landmark, was demolished by Mayo Clinic in the 1980s to make way for the Siebens Building (completed in 1989). Mayo Clinic&#x27;s campus has undergone expansion over the years.

Other notable Mayo Clinic buildings include the Mayo Building (Rochester, Minnesota) (construction completed in 1955), Guggenheim Building (1974), Gonda Building (2001), Opus Imaging Research Building (2007) and a recent addition in 2019 – Discovery Square building.

Mayo Clinic&#x27;s humanities program was founded on the belief that the arts and healing are linked. Over the decades, Mayo Clinic has established an extensive art collection, including these works on display across all campuses:

* &quot;Endangered Species&quot; by Andy Warhol
* &quot;John D&#x27;Aire&quot; by Auguste Rodin
* &quot;Fish&quot; by Alexander Calder
* &quot;Man and Freedom&quot; by Ivan Meštrović
* Untitled by Dale Chihuly
* &quot;Four Houses&quot; by Jennifer Bartlett
* &quot;The Archer&quot; by Joan Miró
* &quot;My Brother and I&quot; by Tuck Langland
* &quot;Constellation Earth&quot; by Paul Granlund

=== Educational programs ===
The first medical, educational programs at Mayo Clinic were developed in 1915 with the assistance of the University of Minnesota. Mayo Clinic School of Graduate Medical Education and the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research were established in 1915. MFMER was established as a department of the University of Minnesota with a $1.5 million donation to offer graduate programs at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. The Mayo Clinic School of Graduate Medical Education is part of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, which is divided into five schools. Those schools include Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine, Mayo Clinic School of Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic School of Continuous Professional Development, and Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.

In 2011, the foundation that oversees the Mayo Clinic went before the Supreme Court to argue that medical residents should remain exempt from Social Security deductions. In &quot;Mayo Foundation v. United States&quot;, the court sided with the Social Security Administration and required FICA to be deducted going forward.

=== Current practice ===
Mayo Clinic rules mandate that its CEOs must be physicians and come from within Mayo Clinic. John H. Noseworthy, M.D., served as president and CEO from 2009 to 2019. Under his leadership, Mayo Clinic was reorganized into a single operating company with a unified strategy and business plan, which helped the system expand. This included the launch of the Destination Medical Center, a 20-year economic growth plan in Rochester. During this time, annual revenue reached nearly $12 billion, and Mayo Clinic added 7,200 employees.

In 2018, Mayo Clinic announced that Gianrico Farrugia, M.D., a Mayo Clinic physician for more than 30 years, would replace Noseworthy as CEO. Farrugia had served as CEO of Mayo Clinic in Florida since 2015. The replacement adhered to Mayo Clinic&#x27;s tradition of leadership changes, where a new president or CEO is named every seven to ten years. By 2018, Mayo Clinic doctors saw approximately 1.3 million patients annually.

== Criticism ==
=== Opposition to the &quot;Keeping Nurses at the Bedside Act&quot; ===
In May 2023, Mayo Clinic lobbied against two statewide health care bills, the Keeping Nurses at the Bedside Act (KNABA) and the Health Care Affordability Board, threatening to pull over 4 billion dollars in investments into new facilities and infrastructure in the Mayo Clinic Rochester campus unless the Affordability Board bill was scrapped and the KNABA was amended to exempt Mayo Clinic from any staffing mandates. The KNABA required hospitals to create committees that allowed nurses and other staff to evaluate staffing workloads in order to address a so-called &quot;care crisis&quot; and a shortage in hospital staff. The Health Care Affordability Board would allow hospitals, doctors, and insurers to be fined for failing to lower costs or allowing costs to run out of control. The Minnesota Nurses Association spoke out against Mayo&#x27;s demands, characterizing them as &quot;unethical&quot; and &quot;attempt(s) to override democracy&quot;. These lobbying attempts were successful, with the mandated nurse staffing levels scrapped, and the Health Care Affordability Board legislation being changed from a board empowered to levy fines to a bill that &quot;requires state health officials to review health care cost growth but gives them no authority to set targets&quot;. Minnesota state senator Erin Murphy called Mayo&#x27;s efforts to gut the bill &quot;corporate hijacking&quot; in an op-ed published in the &quot;Star Tribune.&quot;

== Innovation ==
Mayo Clinic has adopted more than 15,000 mobile devices from Apple for patient care, including the iPad, iPad Mini, and iPhone. Mayo Clinic then created an app for these devices called Synthesis Mobile, which integrated hundreds of their health systems. More apps were created for Mayo Clinic Care Network members to help patients see their medical records or ask clinicians for assistance. In 2014, Mayo Clinic was developing an app for Apple&#x27;s HealthKit to help users maintain healthy lifestyles and warn of certain health signs that need attention.

The Mayo Clinic Center for Innovation was established in 2008. It has since worked on over 270 projects.

In March 2018, Mayo Clinic and Mytonomy, a healthcare education system company, partnered to provide video content for cancer patients.

In September 2019, Mayo Clinic entered into a partnership with Google for health care innovation and cloud computing, and Google planned to open its facility in Rochester, Minnesota for Mayo Clinic.

In January 2020, Mayo Clinic and NTT Venture Capital joined a $60 million financing for biomedical software startup inference.

In March 2023, Mayo Clinic disclosed that they are using AI technology to write content. The AI content is used to write in plain language, choose words that are inclusive, and optimize content for search applications.

== Rankings ==
Since 2016 the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, has been ranked as the #1 overall hospital in the United States by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. Almost 5,000 hospitals were considered and ranked in 16 specialties, from cancer and heart disease to respiratory disorders and urology; 153 (just over three percent of the total) were ranked in at least one of the 16 specialties. Of the 153 hospitals ranked in one or more specialties, 20 qualified for the Honor Roll, earning high scores in at least six specialties. Mayo Clinic, Rochester, was ranked in the top 10 in all but one of 16 specialties, in the top 4 in 13 specialties, and was the #1 ranked hospital in 8 of the 12 data-driven specialties.

<text>Glycogen storage disease type V (GSD5, GSD-V), also known as McArdle&#x27;s disease, is a metabolic disorder, one of the metabolic myopathies, more specifically a muscle glycogen storage disease, caused by a deficiency of myophosphorylase. Its incidence is reported as one in 100,000, roughly the same as glycogen storage disease type I.

The disease was first reported in 1951 by British physician Brian McArdle of Guy&#x27;s Hospital, London.

==Signs and symptoms==
===Onset of symptoms and diagnostic delay===
In the classic phenotype, the onset of this disease is usually noticed in childhood, but often not diagnosed until the third or fourth decade of life, frequently due to misdiagnosis and dismissal of symptoms. The median age of symptom onset is 3 years, with the median diagnostic delay being 29 years. Misdiagnosis is overwhelmingly common, with approximately 90% of patients being misdiagnosed, and approximately 62% receiving multiple misdiagnoses before a correct diagnosis. The prolonged diagnostic delay, misdiagnosis or multiple misdiagnoses, or being given inappropriate exercise advice (such as ignore pain or avoid exercise) severely impacts the quality of life (QoL), physically and mentally.

=== Ultra-rare phenotypes ===

==== Late adult-onset, limb–girdle phenotype ====
There is an ultra-rare adult-onset, limb–girdle phenotype that presents very late in life (70+ years of age) due to a recessive homozygous PYGM mutation (p. Lys42Profs*48) resulting in severe upper and lower limb atrophy, with the possibility of ptosis (drooping eyelids) and camptocormia (stooped posture). As of 2017, there have been two reported cases of this specific homozygous mutation and phenotype. In 1980, a woman also had a limb–girdle phenotype with onset at age 60, histochemical staining showed myophosphorylase deficiency; however the genetic mutation was unknown.

==== Fatal infantile-onset phenotype ====
There is an ultra-rare, fatal infantile-onset phenotype that results in profound muscle weakness (&quot;floppy baby&quot;) and respiratory failure within weeks of birth (perinatal asphyxia). Post-mortem biopsy showed a deficiency of myophosphorylase and abnormal glycogen accumulation in skeletal muscle tissue. This phenotype may also include premature birth and joint contractures. Two reported cases, in 1978 and 1989.

==== Mild phenotype ====
There is an ultra-rare mild phenotype caused by recessive heterozygous alleles in the PYGM gene, where one allele is a common exon mutation and the other allele is an ultra-rare intronic mutation. It can also be caused by recessive homozygous intronic mutations. These intronic mutations result in a milder phenotype compared to the classic phenotype of McArdle disease. There is residual myophosphorylase activity, between 1-2% residual activity compared to unaffected individuals. This results in greater exercise capacity compared to classic phenotype McArdle individuals, particularly for sustained aerobic activity, but the capacity was still below that of unaffected individuals. In this mild phenotype, since their early teens, they did experience cramping and premature muscle fatigue during sudden vigorous exercise and prolonged isometric exercise; however, due to their less diminished capacity for aerobic activity, they were able to keep up with their peers in sports and everyday activities. As of 2009, there have been 3 reported cases of non-related individuals, a reported Druze family of consanguineous (related) individuals and 9 reported cases in two Finnish families.

=== Common signs and symptoms ===
The most prominent symptom is that of exercise intolerance which includes:
* premature muscle fatigue (particularly for anaerobic activity and high-intensity aerobic activity, which may be described as inability to keep up with peers or reduced stamina);
* exercise-induced painful cramps;
* inappropriate rapid heart rate response to exercise;
* exaggerated cardiorespiratory response to exercise (heavy or rapid breathing with inappropriately rapid heart rate);
* second wind phenomenon (muscle fatigue and heart rate improve for aerobic activity after approximately 6–10 minutes). 

Heart rate during exercise is a key indicator as, unlike the symptoms of muscle fatigue and cramping, it is a medical sign (meaning that it is observable and measurable by a third party rather than felt subjectively by the patient). In regularly active individuals with McArdle disease, they may not feel the usual symptoms of muscle fatigue and cramping until they increase their speed to very brisk walking, jogging, or cycling; however, they will still show an inappropriately rapid heart rate response to exercise, with a declining heart rate once second wind has been achieved.&quot;In McArdle&#x27;s, our heart rate tends to increase in what is called an &#x27;inappropriate&#x27; response. That is, after the start of exercise it increases much more quickly than would be expected in someone unaffected by McArdle&#x27;s.&quot; 

=== Other symptoms and comorbidities ===
Myoglobinuria (reddish-brown urine) may be seen due to the breakdown of skeletal muscle known as rhabdomyolysis (a condition in which muscle cells breakdown, sending their contents into the bloodstream). In 2020, the largest study to-date of 269 GSD-V patients, 39.4% reported no previous episodes of myoglobinuria and 6.8% had normal CK (including those with fixed muscle weakness); so an absence of myoglobinuria and normal CK should not rule out the possibility of the disease. Between 33-51.4% develop fixed muscle weakness, typically of the trunk and upper body, with the onset of muscle weakness usually occurring later in life (40+ years of age).

Younger people may display unusual symptoms, such as difficulty chewing, swallowing, or utilizing normal oral motor functions. Idiopathic leg pains were common in children, usually occurring at night, often presumed to be &quot;growing pains&quot; and not investigated further. Several comorbidities were found in GSD-V individuals at a higher rate than in the general population, including (but not limited to): hypertension (17%), endocrine diseases (15.7%), musculoskeletal/rheumatic disease (12.9%), hyperuricemia/gout (11.6%), gastrointestinal diseases (11.2%), neurological disease (10%), respiratory disease (9.5%), and coronary artery disease (8.3%). They may have a pseudoathletic appearance of muscle hypertrophy (24%), particularly of the legs, and may have lower bone mineral content and density in the legs.

Besides exercise-induced premature muscle fatigue, GSD-V individuals may also have comorbidities of mental fatigue, general fatigue, reduced motivation, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression.

As skeletal muscle relies predominantly on glycogenolysis for the first few minutes as it transitions from rest to activity, as well as throughout high-intensity aerobic activity and all anaerobic activity, individuals with GSD-V experience during exercise: sinus tachycardia, tachypnea, muscle fatigue and pain, during the aforementioned activities and time frames. They may exhibit a &quot;second wind&quot; phenomenon, which is characterized by the individual&#x27;s better tolerance for aerobic exercise such as walking and cycling after approximately 10 minutes. This is attributed to the combination of increased blood flow and the ability of the body to find alternative sources of energy, like fatty acids, proteins, and increased blood glucose uptake.

AMP is primarily produced from the myokinase (adenylate kinase) reaction, which runs when the ATP reservoir is low. The myokinase reaction is one of three reactions in the phosphagen system (ATP-PCr), with the myokinase reaction occurring after phosphocreatine (creatine phosphate) has been depleted. In McArdle disease individuals, their muscle cells produce far more AMP than non-affected individuals as the reduced glycolytic flux from impaired glycogenolysis results in a chronically low ATP reservoir during exercise. The muscle cells need ATP (adenosine triphosphate) as it provides energy for muscle contraction by actively transporting calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum before muscle contraction, and it is used during muscle contraction for the release of myosin heads in the sliding filament model during the cross-bridge cycle.

Along with the myokinase reaction, AMP is also produced by the purine nucleotide cycle, which also runs when the ATP reservoir in muscle cells is low, and is a part of protein metabolism. In the purine nucleotide cycle, three nucleotides: AMP (adenosine monophosphate), IMP (inosine monophosphate), and S-AMP (adenylosuccinate) are converted in a circular fashion; the byproducts are fumarate (which goes on to produce ATP via oxidative phosphorylation), ammonia (from the conversion of AMP into IMP), and uric acid (from excess AMP). GSD-V patients may experience myogenic hyperuricemia (exercise-induced accelerated breakdown of purine nucleotides in skeletal muscle).

To avoid health complications, GSD-V patients need to get their ATP primarily from free fatty acids (lipid metabolism) rather than protein metabolism. Over-reliance on protein metabolism can be best avoided by not depleting their ATP reservoir, such as by not pushing through the pain and by not going too fast, or too soon. &quot;Be wary of pushing on when you feel pain start. This pain is a result of damaging muscles, and repeated damage will cause problems in the long term. But also this is counterproductive–it will stop you from getting into second wind. By pressing on despite the pain, you start your protein metabolism which then effectively blocks your glucose and fat metabolism. If you ever get into this situation, you need to stop completely for 30 minutes or more and then start the whole process again.&quot;Patients may present at emergency rooms with a transient contracture of the muscles and often severe pain (e.g. &quot;clawed hand&quot;). These require urgent assessment for rhabdomyolysis as in about 30% of cases this leads to acute kidney injury, which left untreated can be life-threatening. In a small number of cases compartment syndrome has developed, requiring prompt surgical referral.

==Genetics==

McArdle disease (GSD-V) is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are carriers (not having the disease, but each parent having one copy of the mutated allele), then each child of the couple will have a 25% chance of being affected (having McArdle disease), a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected (neither a carrier nor diseased).

Two autosomal recessive forms of this disease occur, childhood-onset and adult-onset. The gene for myophosphorylase, &quot;PYGM&quot; (the muscle-type of the glycogen phosphorylase gene), is located on chromosome 11q13. According to the most recent publications, 95 different mutations have been reported. The forms of the mutations may vary between ethnic groups. For example, the &quot;R50X&quot; (Arg50Stop) mutation (previously referred to as &quot;R49X&quot;) is most common in North America and Western Europe, and the &quot;Y84X&quot; mutation is most common among central Europeans.

The exact method of protein disruption has been elucidated in certain mutations. For example, &quot;R138W&quot; is known to disrupt to pyridoxal phosphate binding site. In 2006, another mutation (c.13_14delCT) was discovered which may contribute to increased symptoms in addition to the common Arg50Stop mutation.

===Myophosphorylase===

==== Structure ====

The myophosphorylase structure consists of 842 amino acids. The molecular weight of the unprocessed precursor is 97 kDa. The three-dimensional structure has been determined for this protein. The interactions of several amino acids in myophosphorylase&#x27;s structure are known. Ser-14 is modified by phosphorylase kinase during activation of the enzyme. Lys-680 is involved in binding the pyridoxal phosphate, which is the active form of vitamin B6, a cofactor required by myophosphorylase. By similarity, other sites have been estimated: Tyr-76 binds AMP, Cys-109 and Cys-143 are involved in subunit association, and Tyr-156 may be involved in allosteric control.

==== Function ====

Myophosphorylase is the form of the glycogen phosphorylase found in muscle that catalyses the following reaction:

((1→4)-alpha-D-glucosyl) (n) + phosphate = ((1→4)-alpha-D-glucosyl) (n-1) + alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate

During exercise, a deficiency of this enzyme ultimately leads to rapid depletion of phosphocreatine, a decrease in available ATP, and an exaggerated rise of ADP and AMP. McArdle disease individuals also have increased maximum fat oxidation compared to unaffected individuals. During exercise, in affected individuals, there is no significant rise in lactic acid production compared to resting levels (it may even fall below resting levels), and plasma pH levels rise (become more alkaline) rather than fall (become more acidic).

==Pathophysiology==

Myophosphorylase is involved in the breakdown of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate for use in muscle. The enzyme removes 1,4 glycosyl residues from the outer branches of glycogen and adds inorganic phosphate to form glucose-1-phosphate. Ordinarily, the removal of 1,4 glycosyl residues by myophosphorylase leads to the formation of glucose-1-phosphate during glycogen breakdown and the polar, phosphorylated glucose cannot leave the cell membrane and so is marked for intracellular catabolism. In McArdle&#x27;s disease, deficiency of myophosphorylase leads to the accumulation of intramuscular glycogen and a lack of glucose-1-phosphate for cellular fuel.

Myophosphorylase comes in two forms: form &#x27;a&#x27; is phosphorylated by phosphorylase kinase, form &#x27;b&#x27; is not phosphorylated. Form &#x27;a&#x27; is de-phosphorylated into form &#x27;b&#x27; by the enzyme phosphoprotein phosphatase, which is activated by elevated insulin. Both forms have two conformational states: active (R or relaxed) and inactive (T or tense). When either form &#x27;a&#x27; or &#x27;b&#x27; is in the active state, then the enzyme converts glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate. Myophosphorylase-b is allosterically activated by elevated AMP within the cell, and allosterically inactivated by elevated ATP and/or glucose-6-phosphate. Myophosphorylase-a is active unless allosterically inactivated by elevated glucose within the cell. In this way, myophosphorylase-a is the more active of the two forms as it will continue to convert glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate even with high levels of glycogen-6-phosphate and ATP. 

==Diagnosis==
There are some laboratory tests that may aid in the diagnosis of GSD-V. A muscle biopsy will note the absence of myophosphorylase in muscle fibers. In some cases, abnormal glycogen accumulation stained by periodic acid-Schiff can be seen with microscopy.

Genetic sequencing of the PYGM gene (which codes for the muscle isoform of glycogen phosphorylase) may be done to determine the presence of gene mutations, determining if McArdle&#x27;s is present. This type of testing is considerably less invasive than a muscle biopsy.

The physician can also perform an ischemic forearm exercise test as described below (see &quot;History&quot;). Some findings suggest a nonischemic test could be performed with similar results. The nonischemic version of this test would involve not cutting off the blood flow to the exercising arm. Findings consistent with McArdle&#x27;s disease would include a failure of lactate to rise in venous blood and exaggerated ammonia levels. These findings would indicate a severe muscle glycolytic block.

Serum lactate may fail to rise in part because of increased uptake via the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT1), which is upregulated in skeletal muscle in McArdle disease. Lactate may be used as a fuel source once converted to pyruvate. Ammonia levels may rise given ammonia is a by-product of AMP deaminase which follows after the production of AMP by adenylate kinase, an alternative pathway for ATP production. In this pathway, adenylate kinase combines two ADP molecules to make ATP and AMP; AMP is then deaminated, producing inosine monophosphate (IMP) and ammonia (NH3) as part of purine nucleotide cycle.

Physicians may also check resting levels of creatine kinase, which are moderately increased in 90% of patients. In some, the level is increased by multitudes - a person without GSD-V will have a CK between 60 and 400IU/L, while a person with the syndrome may have a level of 5,000 IU/L at rest, and may increase to 35,000 IU/L or more with muscle exertion. This can help distinguish McArdle&#x27;s syndrome from carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency (CPT-II), a lipid-based metabolic disorder that prevents fatty acids from being transported into mitochondria for use as an energy source. Also, serum electrolytes and endocrine studies (such as thyroid function, parathyroid function, and growth hormone levels) will also be completed. Urine studies are required only if rhabdomyolysis is suspected. Urine volume, urine sediment, and myoglobin levels would be ascertained. If rhabdomyolysis is suspected, serum myoglobin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, electrolytes, and renal function will be checked.

Physicians may also conduct an exercise stress test to test for an inappropriately rapid heart rate (sinus tachycardia) in response to exercise. Due to the rare nature of the disease, the inappropriate rapid heart rate in response to exercise may be misdiagnosed as inappropriate sinus tachycardia (which is a diagnosis of exclusion). The 12 Minute Walk Test (12MWT) can be used to determine &quot;second wind,&quot; which requires a treadmill (no incline), heart rate monitor, stopwatch, pain scale, and that the patient has rested for 30 minutes before the test to ensure that &quot;second wind&quot; has stopped (that is, that increased ATP production primarily from free fatty acids has returned to resting levels).

Electromyography (EMG) may show normal or myopathic results (short duration, polyphasic, small amplitude MUAPs). Before exercise, a minority of GSD-V patients show myopathic results (5/25 patients); whereas after 5 minutes of high-intensity isometric exercise, the majority showed myopathic results (22/25 patients). The myopathic results were a decrease in CMAP amplitude, which was evident immediately after exercise and, after a plateau phase of a few minutes, reached its maximum after 30 minutes.

=== Differential diagnosis ===

Dynamic symptoms of exercise intolerance (e.g. muscle fatigue and cramping) with or without fixed proximal muscle weakness:
* Another glycogen storage disease that affects muscle (muscle GSD);
* Metabolic myopathy other than glycogen storage disease;
* Endocrine myopathy that affects carbohydrate metabolism secondary to the primary disease;
* Inadequate blood flow (ischemia), particularly of the calves
** Intermittent claudication;
** Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome;
** Chronic venous insufficiency.
* Poor diet or malabsorption disease resulting in malnutrition of micronutrients essential for muscle glycogen metabolism;
* Other rare myopathies, such as Brody disease, Rippling muscle disease, Erythrocyte lactate transporter defect, a small number of muscular dystrophies, Tubular aggregate myopathy (TAM), etc.
Exercise-induced muscle fatigue without cramping:
* Myasthenia gravis;
* Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome;
* Congenital myasthenic syndromes.

Fixed symptoms of muscle weakness, predominantly of the proximal muscles:
* Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy;
* Inflammatory myopathy.
Allelic to McArdle disease (GSD-V) is a recently discovered disease that has a pathogenic autosomal dominant mutation in exon 16 of the PYGM gene c.1915G&gt;C (p.Asp639His). Discovered in 2020, it affected 13 members of a family over four generations and has yet to be assigned a GSD number. Unlike McArdle disease (GSD-V), this disease does not have an overall deficiency of myophosphorylase, only a deficiency of functioning myophosphorylase-a with plenty of functioning myophosphorylase-b (similar to GSD-IXd). Myophosphorylase-b can be allosterically activated to break down glycogen (glycogenolysis) by high levels of AMP, and as the AMP-dependent activity was preserved, the individuals of this family had normal muscle glycogen concentrations as well as lacked exercise intolerance (which are prominent distinguishing features from McArdle disease). The only symptom was adult-onset (40+ years of age) fixed muscle weakness, initially of the proximal muscles of the legs, followed by proximal arms, then distal leg muscles. Muscle biopsy also showed accumulation of the intermediate filament desmin in the myofibres.

==Treatment==
Supervised exercise programs have been shown in small studies to improve exercise capacity by several measures: lowering heart rate, lowering serum creatine kinase (CK), increasing the exercise intensity threshold before symptoms of muscle fatigue and cramping are experienced, and the skeletal muscles becoming aerobically conditioned.

Oral sucrose treatment (for example a sports drink with 75 grams of sucrose in 660 ml.) taken 30 minutes before exercise has been shown to help improve exercise tolerance, including a lower heart rate and lower perceived level of exertion compared with placebo. This is because the ingestion of a high-carbohydrate meal or drink causes transient hyperglycaemia, with the exercising muscle cells utilizing the high glucose in the blood for the glycolytic pathway. However, the ingestion of a high-carbohydrate meal or drink is problematic as a frequent form of treatment since it will increase the release of insulin, which inhibits the release of fatty acids and subsequently will delay the ability to get into second wind. The frequent ingestion of sucrose (e.g. sugary drinks), to avoid premature muscle fatigue and cramping, is also problematic in that it can lead to obesity as insulin will also stimulate triglyceride synthesis (develop body fat), and obesity-related ill health (e.g. type II diabetes and heart disease).

A low dosage treatment with creatine showed a significant improvement of muscle problems compared to placebo in a small clinical study, while other studies have shown minimal subjective benefit. High-dosage treatment of creatine has been shown to worsen symptoms of myalgia (muscle pain).

A ketogenic diet has demonstrated beneficial for McArdle disease (GSD-V) as ketones readily convert to acetyl CoA for oxidative phosphorylation, whereas free fatty acids take a few minutes to convert into acetyl CoA. Ketones are a part of fat metabolism, the ketones can act as the main fuel before fatty acid catabolism takes over (second wind), during which the ketones would act as a supplementary fuel alongside the fatty acids to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by oxidative phosphorylation.

==History==

The deficiency was the first metabolic myopathy to be recognized when the physician Brian McArdle described the first case in a 30-year-old man who always experienced pain and weakness after exercise. McArdle noticed this patient&#x27;s cramps were electrically silent and his venous lactate levels failed to increase upon ischemic exercise. (The ischemic exercise consists of the patient squeezing a hand dynamometer at maximal strength for a specific period, usually a minute, with a blood pressure cuff, which is placed on the upper arm and set at 250 mmHg, blocking blood flow to the exercising arm.)

Notably, this is the same phenomenon that occurs when muscle is poisoned in vitro by iodoacetate, which inhibits the breakdown of glycogen into glucose and prevents the formation of lactate; as well as produces an electronically silent muscle contracture. Knowing what occurs to muscle poisoned by iodoacetate, helped McArdle speculate that a glycogenolytic block might be occurring when he first described the disease. McArdle accurately concluded that the patient had a disorder of glycogen breakdown that specifically affected skeletal muscle. The associated enzyme deficiency was discovered in 1959 by W. F. H. M. Mommaerts et al.

== In animals ==
Naturally occurring myophosphorylase deficiency (GSD-V; McArdle disease) has been found in Charolais cattle and Merino sheep. The cattle were asymptomatic at rest, but when forced to exercise, would become noticeably fatigued and recumbent (having to lie down) for approximately 10 minutes before being able to resume exercise (the second wind phenomenon).

Artificially-induced myophosphorylase deficiency was created in mice, by altering their embryonic DNA, for use in laboratory experiments.

<text>A glycogen storage disease (GSD, also glycogenosis and dextrinosis) is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of an enzyme or transport protein affecting glycogen synthesis, glycogen breakdown, or glucose breakdown, typically in muscles and/or liver cells.

GSD has two classes of cause: genetic and environmental. Genetic GSD is caused by any inborn error of carbohydrate metabolism (genetically defective enzymes or transport proteins) involved in these processes. In livestock, environmental GSD is caused by intoxication with the alkaloid castanospermine.

However, not every inborn error of carbohydrate metabolism has been assigned a GSD number, even if it is known to affect the muscles or liver. For example, phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency (gene PGK1) has a myopathic form.

Also, Fanconi-Bickel syndrome (gene SLC2A2) and Danon disease (gene LAMP2) were declassed as GSDs due to being defects of transport proteins rather than enzymes; however, GSD-1 subtypes b, c, and d are due to defects of transport proteins (genes SLC37A4, SLC17A3) yet are still considered GSDs.

Phosphoglucomutase deficiency (gene PGM1) was declassed as a GSD due to it also affecting the formation of N-glycans; however, as it affects both glycogenolysis and glycosylation, it has been suggested that it should re-designated as GSD-XIV.

&quot;(See inborn errors of carbohydrate metabolism for a full list of inherited diseases that affect glycogen synthesis, glycogen breakdown, or glucose breakdown.)&quot;

==Types==

* Some GSDs have different forms, e.g. infantile, juvenile, adult (late-onset).
* Some GSDs have different subtypes, e.g. GSD1a / GSD1b, GSD9A1 / GSD9A2 / GSD9B / GSD9C / GSD9D.
* GSD type 0: Although glycogen synthase deficiency does not result in storage of extra glycogen in the liver, it is classified with the GSDs as type 0 because it is another defect of glycogen storage and can cause similar problems.
* GSD type VIII (GSD 8): In the past, liver phosphorylase-b kinase deficiency was considered a distinct condition, however it has been classified with GSD type VI and GSD IXa1; it has been described as X-linked recessive inherited. GSD IX has become the dominant classification for this disease, grouped with the other isoenzymes of phosphorylase-b kinase deficiency.
* GSD type XI (GSD 11): Fanconi-Bickel syndrome (GLUT2 deficiency), hepatorenal glycogenosis with renal Fanconi syndrome, no longer considered a glycogen storage disease, but a defect of glucose transport. The designation of GSD type XI (GSD 11) has been repurposed for muscle lactate dehydrogenase deficiency (LDHA).
* GSD type XIV (GSD 14): No longer classed as a GSD, but as a congenital disorder of glycosylation type 1T (CDG1T), affects the phosphoglucomutase enzyme (gene PGM1). Phosphoglucomutase 1 deficiency is both a glycogenosis and a congenital disorder of glycosylation. Individuals with the disease have both a glycolytic block as muscle glycogen cannot be broken down, as well as abnormal serum transferrin (loss of complete N-glycans). As it affects glycogenolysis, it has been suggested that it should re-designated as GSD-XIV.
* Lafora disease is considered a complex neurodegenerative disease and also a glycogen metabolism disorder.
* Polyglucosan storage myopathies are associated with defective glycogen metabolism
* (Not McArdle disease, same gene but different symptoms) Myophosphorylase-a activity impaired: Autosomal dominant mutation on PYGM gene. AMP-independent myophosphorylase activity impaired, whereas the AMP-dependent activity was preserved. No exercise intolerance. Adult-onset muscle weakness. Accumulation of the intermediate filament desmin in the myofibers of the patients. Myophosphorylase comes in two forms: form &#x27;a&#x27; is phosphorylated by phosphorylase kinase, form &#x27;b&#x27; is not phosphorylated. Both forms have two conformational states: active (R or relaxed) and inactive (T or tense). When either form &#x27;a&#x27; or &#x27;b&#x27; are in the active state, then the enzyme converts glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate. Myophosphorylase-b is allosterically activated by AMP being in larger concentration than ATP and/or glucose-6-phosphate. (See Glycogen phosphorylase§Regulation).
* Unknown glycogenosis related to dystrophy gene deletion: patient has a previously undescribed myopathy associated with both Becker muscular dystrophy and a glycogen storage disorder of unknown aetiology.

== Diagnosis ==

Methods to diagnose glycogen storage diseases include history and physical examination for associated symptoms, blood tests for associated metabolic disturbances, and genetic testing for suspected mutations. It may also include a non-ischemic forearm test, exercise stress test, or 12-minute walk test (12MWT). Advancements in genetic testing are slowly diminishing the need for biopsy; however, in the event of a VUS and inconclusive exercise tests, a biopsy would then be necessary to confirm diagnosis.

=== Differential diagnosis ===

==== Muscle ====
Glycogen storage diseases that involve skeletal muscle typically have exercise-induced (dynamic) symptoms, such as premature muscle fatigue, rather than fixed weakness (static) symptoms. Differential diagnoses for glycogen storage diseases that involve fixed muscle weakness, particularly of the proximal muscles, would be an inflammatory myopathy or a limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.

For those with exercise intolerance and/or proximal muscle weakness, the endocrinopathies should be considered. The timing of the symptoms of exercise intolerance, such as muscle fatigue and cramping, is important in order to help distinguish it from other metabolic myopathies such as fatty acid metabolism disorders.

Problems originating within the circulatory system, rather than the muscle itself, can produce exercise-induced muscle fatigue, pain and cramping that alleviates with rest, resulting from inadequate blood flow (ischemia) to the muscles. Ischemia that often produces symptoms in the leg muscles includes intermittent claudication, popliteal artery entrapment syndrome, and chronic venous insufficiency.

Diseases disrupting the neuromuscular junction can cause abnormal muscle fatigue, such as myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease. Similar, are Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (autoimmune) and the congenital myasthenic syndromes (genetic).

Diseases can disrupt glycogen metabolism secondary to the primary disease. Abnormal thyroid function—hypo- and hyperthyroidism—can manifest as myopathy with symptoms of exercise-induced muscle fatigue, cramping, muscle pain and may include proximal weakness or muscle hypertrophy (particularly of the calves). Hypothyroidism up-regulates glycogen synthesis and down-regulates glycogenolysis and glycolysis; conversely, hyperthyroidism does the reverse, up-regulating glycogenolysis and glycolysis while down-regulating glycogen synthesis.

Prolonged hypo- and hyperthyroid myopathy leads to atrophy of type II (fast-twitch/glycolytic) muscle fibres, and a predominance of type I (slow-twitch/oxidative) muscle fibres. Muscle biopsy shows abnormal muscle glycogen: high accumulation in hypothyroidism and low accumulation in hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroid myopathy includes Kocher-Debre-Semelaigne syndrome (childhood-onset), Hoffman syndrome (adult-onset), myasthenic syndrome, and atrophic form.

In patients with increased growth hormone, muscle biopsy includes, among other features, excess glycogen deposition.

EPG5-related Vici syndrome is a multisystem disorder, a congenital disorder of autophagy, with muscle biopsy showing excess glycogen accumulation, among other myopathic features.

It is interesting to note, in comparison to hypothyroid myopathy, that McArdle disease (GSD-V), which is by far the most commonly diagnosed of the muscle GSDs and therefore the most studied, has as its second highest comorbidity endocrine disease (chiefly hypothyroidism) and that some patients with McArdle disease also have hypertrophy of the calf muscles. Late-onset Pompe disease (GSD-II) also has calf hypertrophy and hypothyroidism as comorbidities.

Poor diet and malabsorption diseases (such as celiac disease) may lead to malnutrition of essential vitamins necessary for glycogen metabolism within the muscle cells. Malnutrition typically presents with systemic symptoms, but in rare instances can be limited to myopathy. Vitamin D deficiency myopathy (also known as osteomalic myopathy due to the interplay between vitamin D and calcium) results in muscle weakness, predominantly of the proximal muscles; with muscle biopsy showing abnormal glycogen accumulation, atrophy of type II (fast-twitch/glycolytic) muscle fibres, and diminished calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (needed for muscle contraction). Although Vitamin D deficiency myopathy typically includes muscle atrophy, rarely calf muscle hypertrophy has been reported.

Exercise-induced, electrically silent, muscle cramping and stiffness (transient muscle contractures or &quot;pseudomyotonia&quot;) are seen not only in GSD types V, VII, IXd, X, XI, XII, and XIII, but also in Brody disease, Rippling muscle disease types 1 and 2, and CAV3-related hyperCKemia (Elevated serum creatine phosphokinase). Unlike the other myopathies, in Brody disease the muscle cramping is painless. Like GSD types II, III, and V, a pseudoathletic appearance of muscle hypertrophy is also seen in some with Brody disease and Rippling muscle disease.

Erythrocyte lactate transporter defect (formerly &quot;Lactate transporter defect, myopathy due to&quot;) also includes exercise-induced, electrically silent, painful muscle cramping and transient contractures; as well as exercise-induced muscle fatigue. EMG and muscle biopsy is normal however, as the defect is not in the muscle but in the red blood cells that should clear lactate buildup from exercising muscles.

Although most muscular dystrophies have fixed muscle weakness rather than exercise-induced muscle fatigue and/or cramping, there are a few exceptions. Limb–girdle muscular dystrophy autosomal recessive 23 (LGMD R23) has calf hypertrophy and exercise-induced cramping. Myofibrillar myopathy 10 (MFM10) has exercise-induced muscle fatigue, cramping and stiffness, with hypertrophic neck and shoulder girdle muscles. LGMD R28 has calf hypertrophy and exercise-induced muscle fatigue and pain. LGMD R8 has calf pseudohypertrophy and exercise-induced weakness (fatigue) and pain. LGMD R15 (a.k.a MDDGC3) has muscle hypertrophy, proximal muscle weakness, and muscle fatigue.

DMD-related myopathies of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy are known for fixed muscle weakness and pseudohypertrophic calf muscles, but they also have secondary muscular mitochondrial impairment causing low ATP production; as well as decreasing type II (fast-twitch/glycolytic) muscle fibres, producing a predominance of type I (slow-twitch/oxidative) muscle fibres. DMD-related childhood-onset milder phenotypes present with exercise-induced muscle cramping, stiffness, pain, fatigue, and elevated CK. Becker muscular dystrophy has adult-onset exercise-induced muscle cramping, pain, and elevated CK.

Tubular aggregate myopathy (TAM) types 1 and 2 has exercise-induced muscle pain, fatigue, stiffness, with proximal muscle weakness and calf muscle pseudohypertrophy. TAM1 has cramping at rest, while TAM2 has cramping during exercise. Stormorken syndrome includes the symptoms of TAM, but is a more severe presentation including short stature and other abnormalities. Satoyoshi syndrome has exercise-induced painful muscle cramps, muscle hypertrophy, and short stature. Dimethylglycine dehydrogenase deficiency has muscle fatigue, elevated CK, and fishy body odour. Myopathy with myalgia, increased serum creatine kinase, with or without episodic rhabdomyolysis (MMCKR) has exercise-induced muscle cramps, pain, and fatigue; with some exhibiting proximal muscle weakness.

==== Liver ====
&quot;(help wikipedia by contributing to this subsection)&quot;

Glycogenosis-like phenotype of congenital hyperinsulinism due to HNF4A mutation or MODY1 (maturity-onset diabetes of the young, type 1). This phenotype of MODY1 has macrosomia and infantile-onset hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, physiological 3-OH butyrate, increased triglyceride serum levels, increased level of glycogen in liver and erythrocytes, increased liver transaminases, transient hepatomegaly, renal Fanconi syndrome, and later develop liver cirrhosis, decreased succinate-dependent respiration (mitochondrial dysfunction), rickets, nephrocalcinosis, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes.

== Treatment ==
Treatment is dependent on the type of glycogen storage disease. Von Gierke disease (GSD-I) is typically treated with frequent small meals of carbohydrates and cornstarch, called modified cornstarch therapy, to prevent low blood sugar, while other treatments may include allopurinol and human granulocyte colony stimulating factor.

Cori/Forbes disease (GSD-III) treatment may use modified cornstarch therapy, a high protein diet with a preference to complex carbohydrates. However, unlike GSD-I, gluconeogenesis is functional, so simple sugars (sucrose, fructose, and lactose) are not prohibited.

A ketogenic diet has demonstrated beneficial for McArdle disease (GSD-V) as ketones readily convert to acetyl CoA for oxidative phosphorylation, whereas free fatty acids take a few minutes to convert into acetyl CoA.

For phosphoglucomutase deficiency (formerly GSD-XIV), D-galactose supplements and exercise training has shown favourable improvement of signs and symptoms. In terms of exercise training, some patients with phosphoglucomutase deficiency also experience &quot;second wind.&quot;

For McArdle disease (GSD-V), regular aerobic exercise utilizing &quot;second wind&quot; to enable the muscles to become aerobically conditioned, as well as anaerobic exercise (strength training) that follows the activity adaptations so as not to cause muscle injury, helps to improve exercise intolerance symptoms and maintain overall health. Studies have shown that regular low-moderate aerobic exercise increases peak power output, increases peak oxygen uptake (V̇O2peak), lowers heart rate, and lowers serum CK in individuals with McArdle disease.

Regardless of whether the patient experiences symptoms of muscle pain, muscle fatigue, or cramping, the phenomenon of second wind having been achieved is demonstrable by the sign of an increased heart rate dropping while maintaining the same speed on the treadmill. Inactive patients experienced second wind, demonstrated through relief of typical symptoms and the sign of an increased heart rate dropping, while performing low-moderate aerobic exercise (walking or brisk walking).

Conversely, patients that were regularly active did not experience the typical symptoms during low-moderate aerobic exercise (walking or brisk walking), but still demonstrated second wind by the sign of an increased heart rate dropping. For the regularly active patients, it took more strenuous exercise (very brisk walking/jogging or bicycling) for them to experience both the typical symptoms and relief thereof, along with the sign of an increased heart rate dropping, demonstrating second wind.

In young children (&lt;10 years old) with McArdle disease (GSD-V), it may be more difficult to detect the second wind phenomenon. They may show a normal heart rate, with normal or above normal peak cardio-respiratory capacity (V̇O2max). That said, patients with McArdle disease typically experience symptoms of exercise intolerance before the age of 10 years, with the median symptomatic age of 3 years.

Tarui disease (GSD-VII) patients do not experience the &quot;second wind&quot; phenomenon; instead are said to be &quot;out-of-wind.&quot; However, they can achieve sub-maximal benefit from lipid metabolism of free fatty acids during aerobic activity following a warm-up.

== Epidemiology ==

Overall, according to a study in British Columbia, approximately 2.3 children per 100,000 births (1 in 43,000) have some form of glycogen storage disease. In the United States, they are estimated to occur in 1 per 20,000–25,000 births. Dutch incidence rate is estimated to be 1 per 40,000 births.
While a Mexican incidence showed 6.78:1000 male newborns.

Within the category of muscle glycogenoses (muscle GSDs), McArdle disease (GSD-V) is by far the most commonly diagnosed.

<text>Felt is a textile that is produced by matting, condensing, and pressing fibers together. Felt can be made of natural fibers such as wool or animal fur, or from synthetic fibers such as petroleum-based acrylic or acrylonitrile or wood pulp–based rayon. Blended fibers are also common. Natural fiber felt has special properties that allow it to be used for a wide variety of purposes. It is &quot;fire-retardant and self-extinguishing; it dampens vibration and absorbs sound; and it can hold large amounts of fluid without feeling wet...&quot;

==History==

Felt from wool is one of the oldest known textiles. Many cultures have legends about the origins of felt-making. Sumerian legend claims that the secret of feltmaking was discovered by Urnamman of Lagash. The story of Saint Clement and Saint Christopher relates that the men packed their sandals with wool to prevent blisters while fleeing from persecution. At the end of their journey the movement and sweat had turned the wool into felt socks.

Most likely felt&#x27;s origins can be found in east Asia, where there is evidence of feltmaking in Siberia (Altai mountains) in Northern Mongolia and more recently evidence dating back to the first century CE in Mongolia. Siberian tombs (7th to 2nd century BCE) show the broad uses of felt in that culture, including clothing, jewelry, wall hangings, and elaborate horse blankets. Employing careful color use, stitching, and other techniques, these feltmakers were able to use felt as an illustrative and decorative medium on which they could depict abstract designs and realistic scenes with great skill. Over time these makers became known for the beautiful abstract patterns they used that were derived from plant, animal, and other symbolic designs.

From Siberia and Mongolia feltmaking spread across the areas held by the Turkic-Mongolian tribes. Sheep and camel herds were central to the wealth and lifestyle of these tribes, both of which animals were critical to producing the fibers needed for felting. For nomads traveling frequently and living on fairly treeless plains felt provided housing (yurts, tents etc.), insulation, floor coverings, and inside walling, as well as many household necessities from bedding and coverings to clothing. In the case of nomadic peoples, an area where feltmaking was particularly visible was in trappings for their animals and for travel. Felt was often featured in the blankets that went under saddles.

Dyes provided rich coloring, and colored slices of pre-felts (semi-felted sheets that could be cut in decorative ways) along with dyed yarns and threads were combined to create beautiful designs on the wool backgrounds. Felt was even used to create totems and amulets with protective functions. In traditional societies the patterns embedded in the felt were also imbued with significant religious and symbolic meaning.

Feltmaking is still practised by nomadic peoples (such as Mongols and Turkic people) in Central Asia, where rugs, tents and clothing are regularly made. Some of these are traditional items, such as the classic yurt, or ger, while others are designed for the tourist market, such as decorated slippers. In the Western world, felt is widely used as a medium for expression in both textile art and contemporary art and design, where it has significance as an ecologically responsible textile and building material.

In addition to Central Asian traditions of felting, Scandinavian countries have also supported feltmaking, particularly for clothing.

==Manufacturing methods==
===Wet felting===
In the wet felting process, hot water is applied to layers of animal hairs, while repeated agitation and compression causes the fibers to hook together or weave together into a single piece of fabric. Wrapping the properly arranged fiber in a sturdy, textured material, such as a bamboo mat or burlap, will speed up the felting process. The felted material may be finished by fulling.

Only certain types of fiber can be wet felted successfully. Most types of fleece, such as those taken from the alpaca or the Merino sheep, can be put through the wet felting process. One may also use mohair (goat), angora (rabbit), or hair from rodents such as beavers and muskrats. These types of fiber are covered in tiny scales, similar to the scales found on a strand of human hair. Heat, motion, and moisture of the fleece causes the scales to open, while agitating them causes them to latch onto each other, creating felt. There is an alternative theory that the fibers wind around each other during felting. Plant fibers and synthetic fibers will not wet felt.

In order to make multi-colored designs, felters conduct a two-step process in which they create pre-felts of specialized colors—these semi-completed sheets of colored felt can then be cut with a sharp implement (knife or scissors) and the distinctive colors placed next to each other as in making a mosaic. The felting process is then resumed and the edges of the fabric attach to each other as the felting process is completed. Shyrdak carpets (Turkmenistan) use a form of this method wherein two pieces of contrasting color are cut out with the same pattern, the cut-outs are then switched, fitting one into the other, which makes a sharply defined and colorful patterned piece. In order to strengthen the joints of a mosaic style felt, feltmakers often add a backing layer of fleece that is felted along with the other components. Feltmakers can differ in their orientation to this added layer—where some will lay it on top of the design before felting and others will place the design on top of the strengthening layer.

The process of felting was adapted to the lifestyles of the different cultures in which it flourished. In Central Asia, it is common to conduct the rolling/friction process with the aid of a horse, donkey, or camel, which will pull the rolled felt until the process is complete. Alternately, a group of people in a line might roll the felt along, kicking it regularly with their feet. Further fulling can include throwing or slamming and working the edges with careful rolling. In Turkey, some baths had areas dedicated to feltmaking, making use of the steam and hot water that were already present for bathing.

==== Development of felting as a profession ====
As felting grew in importance to a society, so, too, did the knowledge about techniques and approaches. Amateur or community felting obviously continued in many communities at the same time that felting specialists and felting centers began to develop. However, the importance of felting to community life can be seen in the fact that, in many Central Asian communities, felt production is directed by a leader who oversees the process as a ritual that includes prayers—words and actions to bring good luck to the process. Successfully completing the creation of felt (certainly large felt pieces) is reason for celebration, feasting, and the sharing of traditional stories.

In Turkey, craft guilds called &quot;ahi&quot; came into being, and these groups were responsible for registering members and protecting the knowledge of felting. In Istanbul at one time, there were 1,000 felters working in 400 workshops registered in this ahi.

===Needle felting===

Needle felting is a method of creating felt that uses specially designed needles instead of water. Felting needles have angled notches along the shaft that catch fibers and tangle them together to produce felt. These notches are sometimes erroneously called &quot;barbs&quot;, but barbs are protrusions (like barbed wire) and would be too difficult to thrust into the wool and nearly impossible to pull out. Felting needles are thin and sharp, with shafts of a variety of different gauges and shapes. Needle felting is used in industrial felt making as well as for individual art and craft applications.

Felting needles are sometimes fitted in holders that allow the use of 2 or more needles at one time to sculpt wool objects and shapes. Individual needles are often used for detail while multiple needles that are paired together are used for larger areas or to form the base of the project. At any point in time a variety of fibers and fiber colors may be added, using needles to incorporate them into the project.

Needle felting can be used to create both 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional artwork, including soft sculpture, dolls, figurines, jewelry, and 2 dimensional wool paintings. Needle felting is popular with artists and craftspeople worldwide. One example is Ikuyo Fujita(藤田育代 &quot;Fujita Ikuyo),&quot; a Japanese artist who works primarily in needle felt painting and mogol (pipe cleaner) art.

Recently, needle-felting machines have become popular for art or craft . Similar to a sewing machine, these tools have several needles that punch fibers together. These machines can be used to create felted products more efficiently. The embellishment machine allows the user to create unique combinations of fibers and designs.

===Carroting===
Invented in the mid 17th century and used until the mid-20th centuries, a process called &quot;carroting&quot; was used in the manufacture of good quality felt for making men&#x27;s hats. Beaver, rabbit or hare skins were treated with a dilute solution of the mercury compound mercuric nitrate. The skins were dried in an oven where the thin fur at the sides turned orange, the color of carrots. Pelts were stretched over a bar in a cutting machine, and the skin was sliced off in thin shreds, with the fleece coming away entirely. The fur was blown onto a cone-shaped colander and then treated with hot water to consolidate it. The cone then peeled off and passed through wet rollers to cause the fur to felt. These &#x27;hoods&#x27; were then dyed and blocked to make hats. The toxic solutions from the carrot and the vapours it produced resulted in widespread cases of mercury poisoning among hatters. This may be the origin of the phrase &quot;mad as a hatter&quot; which was used to humorous effect by Lewis Carroll in the chapter &quot;A Mad Tea Party&quot; of the novel &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;.

==Uses==

Felt is used in a wide range of industries and manufacturing processes, from the automotive industry and casinos to musical instruments and home construction, as well as in gun wadding, either inside cartridges or pushed down the barrel of a muzzleloader. Felt had many uses in ancient times and continues to be widely used today.

===Industrial uses===
Felt is frequently used in industry as a sound or vibration damper, as a non-woven fabric for air filtration, and in machinery for cushioning and padding moving parts.

===Home Decor===
Felt can be used in home furnishings like table runners, placemats, coasters, and even as backing for area rugs. It can add a touch of warmth and texture to a space.

===Clothing===

During the 18th and 19th centuries gentlemen&#x27;s headwear made from beaver felt were popular. In the early part of the 20th century, cloth felt hats, such as fedoras, trilbies and homburgs, were worn by many men in the western world. Felt is often used in footwear as boot liners, with the Russian valenki being an example.

===Musical instruments===
Many musical instruments use felt. It is often used as a damper. On drum cymbal stands, it protects the cymbal from cracking and ensures a clean sound. It is used to wrap bass drum strikers and timpani mallets. Felt is used extensively in pianos; for example, piano hammers are made of wool felt around a wooden core. The density and springiness of the felt is a major part of what creates a piano&#x27;s tone. As the felt becomes grooved and &quot;packed&quot; with use and age, the tone suffers. Felt is placed under the piano keys on accordions to control touch and key noise; it is also used on the &quot;pallets&quot; to silence notes not sounded by preventing air flow. Felt is used with other instruments, particularly stringed instruments, as a damper to reduce volume or eliminate unwanted sounds.

===Arts and crafts===
Felt is used for framing paintings. It is laid between the slip mount and picture as a protective measure to avoid damage from rubbing to the edge of the painting. This is commonly found as a preventive measure on paintings which have already been restored or professionally framed. It is widely used to protect paintings executed on various surfaces including canvas, wood panel and copper plate.

A felt-covered board can be used in storytelling to small children. Small felt cutouts or figures of animals, people, or other objects will adhere to a felt board, and in the process of telling the story, the storyteller also acts it out on the board with the animals or people. Puppets can also be made with felt. The best known example of felt puppets are Jim Henson&#x27;s Muppets. Felt pressed dolls, such as Lenci dolls, were very popular in the nineteenth century and just after World War I.

As part of the overall renewal of interest in textile and fiber arts, beginning in the 1970s and continuing through today, felt has experienced a strong revival in interest, including its historical roots. Polly Stirling, a fiber artist from New South Wales, Australia, is commonly associated with the development of nuno felting, a key technique for contemporary art felting. German artist Joseph Beuys prominently integrates felt within his works. English artist Jenny Cowern shifted from traditional drawing and painting media into using felt as her primary media.

Modern day felters with access to a broad range of sheep and other animal fibers have exploited knowledge of these different breeds to produce special effects in their felt. Fleece locks are classified by the Bradford or Micron count, both which designate the fineness to coarseness of the material. Fine wools range from 64 to 80 (Bradford); medium 40–60 (Bradford); and coarse 36–60 (Bradford). Merino, the finest and most delicate sheep fleece, will be employed for clothing that goes next to the body. Claudy Jongstra raises traditional and rare breeds of sheep with much hardier coats (Drenthe, Heath, Gotland, Schoonbeek, and Wensleydale) on her property in Friesland and these are used in her interior design projects. Exploitation of these characteristics of the fleece in tandem with the use of other techniques, such as stitching and incorporation of other fibers, provides felters with a broad range of possibilities

<text>Korean names are names that place their origin in, or are used in, Korea. A Korean name in the modern era typically consists of a surname followed by a given name, with no middle names. A number of Korean terms for names exist. For full names, (), (), or () are commonly used. When a Korean name is written in Hangul, there is usually no space between the surname and the given name.

Most Korean surnames consist of a single syllable, although multisyllabic surnames exist (e.g. Namgung). Upon marriage, both partners keep their full names, but children inherit the father&#x27;s surname unless otherwise specified during the marriage registration process. Koreans have been historically grouped into Korean clans. Each clan is identified by a (; birthplace of the clan&#x27;s founder) and the surname of the founder of the clan (with descendency determined patrilineally). For example, the Jeonju Yi clan comes from Jeonju and descends from . In 2000, a census showed that, in total, there were 286 surnames and 4,179 clans. However, the three most common surnames (Kim, Lee, and Park) are shared by nearly half of South Koreans.

Given names usually have two syllables, although names with one, three, or more syllables also exist. Generation names (where names for a generation of a family are related in some way, usually by sharing a character) are also traditional, although now increasingly less common. In North Korea, the generational syllable is shared only among siblings, but in the South, it is shared by all members of the same generation. The use of given names is guided by a strict system of honorifics; it can be rude to refer to a stranger or person of higher social status by their given name. Perceived gender in names is less consistent than in Western names.

Naming practices have changed over time. Surnames were once exclusively used by royalty and nobility, but eventually became acceptable for lower class usage. Even until 1910, more than half of Koreans did not have a surname. While now significantly less common, Confucian and cultural traditions dictate systems of naming taboos, childhood names, courtesy names, art names, and posthumous names. Until the invention of the Korean alphabet Hangul in the 15th century, most Korean names were written using Chinese characters (Hanja). While many names can still be written entirely in Hanja, some are now exclusively written in Hangul (e.g. Da-som). In 2015, 7.7% of people had Hangul-only names. During the Japanese occupation of Korea, beginning in 1939, Koreans were forced to adopt Japanese names and naming practices. They were allowed to return to using Korean names following the 1945 liberation of Korea.

==Terms==

A number of terms exist for Korean names. For the full name, () is commonly used. This is a compound word; () refers to the surname, and () to the given name. The native Korean term () can be used to refer to either the full name or the given name.

A more formal term for the full name is (). This term is relatively commonly used during transactions or in official settings. It is commonly said in the phrase .

==Surnames==

Fewer than 300 (approximately 280) Korean surnames were in use in 2000, and the three most common (Kim, Lee, and Park) account for nearly half of the population. For various reasons, the number of Korean surnames has been increasing over time.

Each Korean person belongs to a Korean clan. Each clan can be identified by a surname from a patrilineal ancestor and a place of origin (). For example, the most populous clan is the Gimhae Kim clan: they descend from Kim Suro and identify the city of Gimhae as their origin. Clan membership is determined. Clans are further subdivided into various (), or branches stemming from a more recent common ancestor, so that a full identification of a person&#x27;s surname would be clan-surname-branch. Until 2005, marrying other members of one&#x27;s clan was illegal, although this restriction was declared unconstitutional and lifted.

Traditionally, Korean women keep their surnames after their marriage, but their children take the father&#x27;s surname. In the premodern, patriarchal Korean society, people were extremely conscious of familial values and their own family identities. Korean women keep their surnames after marriage based on traditional reasoning that it is inherited from their parents and ancestors, and cannot be changed. According to traditions, each clan publishes a comprehensive genealogy book () every 30 years.

Around a dozen two-syllable surnames are used, all of which rank after the 100 most common surnames. The five most common surnames, which together make up over half of the Korean population, are used by over 20 million people in South Korea.

After the 2015 census, it was revealed that foreign-origin surnames were becoming more common in South Korea, due to naturalised citizens transcribing their surnames in Hangul. Between 2000 and 2015, more than 4,800 new surnames were registered. During the census, a total of 5,582 distinct surnames were collected, 73% of which do not have corresponding Hanja characters. It was also revealed that despite the surge in the number of surnames, the ratio of top 10 surnames had not changed. 44.6% of South Koreans are still named Kim, Lee or Park, while the rest of the top 10 are made up of Choi, Jeong, Kang, Jo, Yoon, Jang and Lim.

==Given names==

Traditionally, given names are partly determined by generation names, a custom originating in China. One of the two characters in a given name is unique to the individual, while the other is shared by all people in a family generation. In both North and South Koreas, generational names are usually no longer shared by cousins, but are still commonly shared by siblings.

Given names are typically composed of Hanja, or Chinese characters. In North Korea, the Hanja are no longer used to write the names, but the meanings are still understood; for example, the syllable () in boys&#x27; names is usually perceived as , which means &quot;iron&quot;.

In South Korea, Article 37 of the &quot;Regulations on Registration of Family Relations&quot; () requires that the Hanja in personal names be taken from a restricted list. Unapproved Hanja must be represented by Hangul in the family relations register (). In March 1991, the Supreme Court of Korea published the &quot;List of Hanja for Use in Personal Names&quot; () which allowed a total of 2,854 Hanja in new South Korean given names (as well as 61 variant forms), and put it into effect starting April 1 of the same year. The list was expanded several times; the latest update was in 2022. Currently, more than 8,000 Hanja are permitted in South Korean names (including the set of basic Hanja), in addition to a small number of variant forms. The use of an official list is similar to Japan&#x27;s use of the &quot;jinmeiyō kanji&quot; (although the characters do not entirely coincide).

The &quot;List of Hanja for Use in Personal Names&quot; merely shows what characters are currently allowed to be registered. It cannot always be used to determine someone&#x27;s existing Hanja name because of the following reasons:
* People who were named before April 1, 1991, did not have any restrictions on Hanja names. Their names can contain Hanja that are not even in the list.
* The list is sometimes updated to include more Hanja. A character currently in the list may not be in older versions of the list.

While the traditional practice is still largely followed, since the late 1970s, some parents have given their children names that are native Korean words, usually of two syllables. Given names of this sort include Ha-neul (), Da-som () and Bit-na (). Between 2008 and 2015, the proportion of such names among South Korean newborns rose from 3.5% to 7.7%. Despite this trend away from traditional practice, people&#x27;s names are still recorded in both Hangul and Hanja (if available) on official documents, in family genealogies, and so on.

Unless a given name contains a syllable that does not have any corresponding Hanja at all (e.g. ()), there is no guarantee that a name which may &quot;look&quot; like a native Korean name never has Hanja. A certain name written in Hangul can be a native Korean name, or a Sino-Korean name, or even both. For example, Bo-ram () can not only be a native Korean name, but can also be a Sino-Korean name (e.g. 寶濫). In some cases, parents intend a dual meaning: both the meaning from a native Korean word and the meaning from Hanja.

Originally, there was no legal limitation on the length of names in South Korea. As a result, some people registered extremely long given names, such as the 16-syllable (; roughly, &quot;more beloved than the sky, stars, clouds, and the sun&quot;). However, beginning in 1993, new regulations required that the given name be five syllables or shorter.

A family relations certificate () of an individual lists the person concerned, the person&#x27;s parents, spouse, and children. If there is more than one person with the same name in a family relations certificate, it is difficult to identify the person. Therefore, an individual is not allowed to have the same name as someone appearing in one&#x27;s parent&#x27;s family relations certificate – in other words, a child cannot have the same name as one&#x27;s parents and grandparents.

==Usage==

===Forms of address===

The usage of names is governed by strict norms in traditional Korean society. It is generally considered rude to address people by their given names in Korean culture. This is particularly the case when dealing with adults or one&#x27;s elders. It is acceptable to call someone by his or her given name if he or she is the same age as the speaker. However, it is considered rude to use someone&#x27;s given name if that person&#x27;s age is a year older than the speaker. This is often a source of pragmatic difficulty for learners of Korean as a foreign language, and for Korean learners of Western languages.

A variety of replacements are used for the actual name of the person. It is acceptable among adults of similar status to address the other by their full name, with the suffix () added. However, it is inappropriate to address someone by the surname alone, even with such a suffix. Whenever the person has an official rank, it is typical to address him or her by the name of that rank (such as &quot;Manager&quot;), often with the honorific () added. In such cases, the full name of the person may be appended, although this can also imply the speaker is of higher status.

Among children and close friends, it is common to use a person&#x27;s birth name.

===Traditional nicknames===
Among the common people, who have suffered from high child mortality, children were often given childhood names (), to wish them long lives by avoiding notice from the messenger of death. These have become less common.

After marriage, women usually lost their , and were called by a (), referring to their town of origin.

In addition, teknonymy, or referring to parents by their children&#x27;s names, is a common practice. It is most commonly used in referring to a mother by the name of her eldest child, as in &quot;Cheolsu&#x27;s mom&quot; (). However, it can be extended to either parent and any child, depending upon the context.

===Gender===
Korean given names&#x27; correlation to gender is complex and, by comparison to European languages, less consistent. Certain Sino-Korean syllables carry masculine connotations, others feminine, and others unisex. These connotations may vary depending on whether the character is used as the first or second character in the given name. A &quot;dollimja&quot; generational marker, once confined to male descendants but now sometimes used for women as well, may further complicate gender identification. Native Korean given names show similar variation.

A further complication in Korean text is that the singular pronoun used to identify individuals has no gender. This means that automated translation often misidentifies or fails to identify an individual&#x27;s gender in Korean text and thus presents stilted or incorrect English output. (Conversely, English source text is similarly missing information about social status and age critical to smooth Korean-language rendering.)

Children traditionally take their father&#x27;s surname. Under South Korean Civil Law effective January 1, 2008, though, children may be legally given the surname of either parent or even that of a step-parent.

==Romanization and pronunciation==

Many modern Koreans romanize their names in an &quot;ad hoc&quot; manner that often attempts to approximate conventions in English orthography. This produces many Latin-spelling variations for a single name. For example, the surname (李) is variously romanized as &quot;Lee&quot;, &quot;Yi&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, or &quot;Rhee&quot;.

Some Koreans avoid certain spellings because of their similarity to English words with negative connotations. For example, &quot;Gang&quot;, &quot;Bang&quot;, &quot;Sin&quot;, and &quot;Gun&quot;.

Although the current official romanization system in South Korea is the Revised Romanization of Korean, South Korean nationals are not required to follow this when they apply for their passports; people are allowed to register their romanized names freely as long as the romanized name can be pronounced like the Hangul name. Even a single surname within a single family can be romanized differently on passports. For example, within a single family, the father&#x27;s surname can be &quot;Shim&quot; while his son&#x27;s can be &quot;Sim&quot;.

According to a 2007 examination of 63,000 passports, the most common romanizations for various common surnames were:
In English-speaking nations, the three most common surnames are often written and pronounced as &quot;Kim&quot; (), &quot;Lee&quot;/&quot;Ri&quot; (), and &quot;Park&quot; ().
* The initial sound in &quot;Kim&quot; shares features with both the English &quot;k&quot; (in initial position, an aspirated voiceless velar stop) and &quot;hard &quot;g&quot;&quot; (an unaspirated voiced velar stop). When pronounced initially, Kim starts with an unaspirated voiceless velar stop sound; it is voiceless like , but also unaspirated like . As aspiration is a distinctive feature in Korean but voicing is not, &quot;Gim&quot; is more likely to be understood correctly. However, &quot;Kim&quot; is usually used as the romanized form in both North and South Koreas.
* The surname &quot;Lee&quot; is originally (&quot;Ri&quot;) in North Korea and (&quot;I&quot;) in South Korea. In the former case, the initial sound is a liquid consonant. There is no distinction between the alveolar liquids and , which is why &quot;Lee&quot; and &quot;Ri&quot; are both common spellings. In South Korea, the pronunciation of the name is simply the English vowel sound for a &quot;long &quot;e&quot;&quot;, as in &quot;see&quot;. This pronunciation is also often spelled as &quot;Yi&quot;; the Northern pronunciation is commonly romanized as &quot;Ri&quot;.
* In Korean, the name that is usually romanized as &quot;Park&quot; actually has no &quot;r&quot; sound, unlike in American English, since the romanization was based on English English, which has r-dropping. Its initial sound is an unaspirated voiceless bilabial stop . The vowel is , similar to the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;father&quot;, so the name is also often transcribed &quot;Pak&quot;, &quot;Bak&quot; and &quot;Bahk&quot;.

In romanized Korean names, a two-syllable given name is spelled as a joined word (&quot;Gildong&quot;), or separated by a hyphen (&#x27;) or a space (&#x27;); in other words, &quot;Gildong&quot;, &quot;Gil-dong&quot;, and &quot;Gil Dong&quot; are all the same given name. Even with a space, &quot;Gil Dong&quot; is still a single first name, not first and middle names. South Korea&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the government agency issuing passports to its nationals, formally advised its nationals not to put a space in their given names because having a space in a given name can be misunderstood as having first and middle names; the Ministry also gives a chance to remove the space when one already has a space in one&#x27;s given name.

It is not always possible to unambiguously determine the original Hangul name from a romanized Korean name. For example, the &quot;jung&quot; in Kim Dae-jung and in Youn Yuh-jung is actually different in Hangul ( and respectively).

, a South Korean professor of the Chinese language and literature at Hanyang University, said the following with regard to the romanizations of Korean personal names and the adoption of South Korea&#x27;s official romanization system in other countries:

===Name order===

In English-language publications, including newspapers, Korean names are usually written in the original order, with the surname first and the given name last. However, Koreans living and working in Western countries usually adopt the Western order, with the given name first and the surname last. The usual presentation of Korean names in English is similar to those of Chinese names and differs from those of Japanese names, which, in English publications, are usually written in a reversed order with the surname last.

==History==
The use of names has evolved over time. The first recording of Korean names appeared as early as in the early Three Kingdoms period. The adoption of Chinese characters contributed to Korean names. A complex system, including courtesy names, art names, posthumous names, and childhood names, arose out of Confucian tradition. The courtesy name system in particular arose from the &quot;Classic of Rites&quot;, a core text of the Confucian canon. Names have also been influenced by naming taboos, a practice that originated in China.

During the Three Kingdoms period, native given names were sometimes composed of three syllables like Misaheun () and Sadaham (), which were later transcribed into Hanja (未斯欣 and 斯多含). The use of surnames was limited to kings in the beginning, but gradually spread to aristocrats and eventually to most of the population.

Some recorded surnames are apparently native Korean words, such as toponyms. At that time, some characters of Korean names might have been read not by their Sino-Korean pronunciation, but by their native reading. For example, the native Korean name of Yeon Gaesomun (), the first Grand Prime Minister of Goguryeo, can linguistically be reconstructed as . Early Silla names are also believed to represent Old Korean vocabulary; for example, Bak Hyeokgeose, the name of the founder of Silla, was pronounced something like (弗矩內), which can be translated as &quot;bright world&quot;.

In older traditions, if the name of a baby is not chosen by the third trimester, the responsibility of choosing the name fell to the oldest son of the family. Often, this was the preferred method as the name chosen was seen as good luck.

According to the chronicle &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, surnames were bestowed by kings upon their supporters. For example, in 33 CE, King Yuri gave the six headmen of Saro (later Silla) the names Lee (), Bae (), Choi (), Jeong (), Son () and Seol (). However, this account is not generally credited by modern historians, who hold that Confucian-style surnames as above were more likely to have come into general use in the fifth and subsequent centuries, as the Three Kingdoms increasingly adopted the Chinese model.

Only a handful of figures from the Three Kingdoms period are recorded as having borne a courtesy name, such as Seol Chong. The custom only became widespread in the Goryeo period, as Confucianism took hold among the literati. In 1055, Goryeo established a new law limiting access to the civil service examination to those without surnames.

For men of the aristocratic &quot;yangban&quot; class, a complex system of alternate names emerged by the Joseon period. On the other hand, commoners typically only had given names. Surnames were originally a privilege reserved for the &quot;yangban&quot; class, but members of the middle and common classes of Joseon society frequently paid to acquire a surname from a &quot;yangban&quot; and be included into a clan; this practice became rampant by the 18th century, leading to a significant growth in the &quot;yangban&quot; class but conversely diluting and weakening its social dominance. For instance, in the region of Daegu, the &quot;yangban&quot; who had comprised 9.2% of Daegu&#x27;s demographics in 1690 rose to 18.7% in 1729, 37.5% in 1783, and 70.3% in 1858. It was not until the Gabo Reform of 1894 that members of the outcast class were allowed to adopt a surname. According to a census called the () completed in 1910, more than half of the Korean population did not have a surname at the time.

For a brief period after the Mongol invasion of Korea during the Goryeo period, Korean kings and aristocrats had both Mongolian and Sino-Korean names. The scions of the ruling class were sent to the Yuan court for schooling. For example, King Gongmin had both the Mongolian name Bayan Temür () and the Sino-Korean name Wang Gi (王祺) (later renamed Wang Jeon (王顓)).

===Japanese colonial period===

During the period of Japanese colonial rule of Korea (1910–1945), Koreans were forced to adopt Japanese-language names. Even today, it is common for Korean nationals living in Japan to use Japanese surnames as well. Also known as or , such an alternative name can be registered as a legal alias and used in many official contexts including bank accounts and health insurance.

In 1939, as part of Governor-General Jirō Minami&#x27;s policy of , Ordinance No. 20 (commonly called the &quot;Name Order&quot;, or in Japanese) was issued, and became law in April 1940. Although the Japanese Governor-General officially prohibited compulsion, low-level officials effectively forced Koreans to adopt Japanese-style surnames and given names. By 1944, about 84% of the population had registered Japanese surnames.

 (Japanese) means the creation of a Japanese surname (, Korean ), distinct from a Korean surname or (Japanese ). Japanese surnames represent the families they belong to and can be changed by marriage and other procedures, while Korean surnames represent paternal linkages and are unchangeable. Japanese policy dictated that Koreans either could register a completely new Japanese surname unrelated to their Korean surname, or have their Korean surname, in Japanese form, automatically become their Japanese name if no surname was submitted before the deadline.

After the liberation of Korea from Japanese rule, the Name Restoration Order () was issued on October 23, 1946, by the United States military administration south of the 38th parallel north, enabling Koreans to restore their original Korean names if they wished.

Japanese conventions of creating given names, such as using &quot;&quot; (Japanese and Korean ) in feminine names, are seldom seen in present-day Korea, both North and South. In the North, a campaign to eradicate such Japanese-based names was launched in the 1970s. In the South, and presumably in the North as well, these names are regarded as old and unsophisticated.

<doc id="160878" wikidata="Q194156" url="?curid=160878" title="Cockpit">
<text>A cockpit or flight deck is the area, on the front part of an aircraft, spacecraft, or submersible, from which a pilot controls the vehicle.


The cockpit of an aircraft contains flight instruments on an instrument panel, and the controls that enable the pilot to fly the aircraft. In most airliners, a door separates the cockpit from the aircraft cabin. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, all major airlines fortified their cockpits against access by hijackers.

==Etymology== 
The word cockpit seems to have been used as a nautical term in the 17th century, without reference to cock fighting. It referred to an area in the rear of a ship where the cockswain&#x27;s station was located, the cockswain being the pilot of a smaller &quot;boat&quot; that could be dispatched from the ship to board another ship or to bring people ashore. The word &quot;cockswain&quot; in turn derives from the old English terms for &quot;boat-servant&quot; (&quot;coque&quot; is the French word for &quot;shell&quot;; and &quot;swain&quot; was old English for boy or servant). The midshipmen and master&#x27;s mates were later berthed in the cockpit, and it served as the action station for the ship&#x27;s surgeon and his mates during battle. Thus by the 18th century, &quot;cockpit&quot; had come to designate an area in the rear lower deck of a warship where the wounded were taken. The same term later came to designate the place from which a sailing vessel is steered, because it is also located in the rear, and is often in a well or &quot;pit&quot;.

However, a convergent etymology does involve reference to cock fighting. According to the &quot;Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology&quot;, the buildings in London where the king&#x27;s cabinet worked (the Treasury and the Privy Council) were called the &quot;Cockpit&quot; because they were built on the site of a theater called &quot;The Cockpit&quot; (torn down in 1635), which itself was built in the place where a &quot;cockpit&quot; for cock-fighting had once stood prior to the 1580s. Thus the word Cockpit came to mean a control center.

The original meaning of &quot;cockpit&quot;, first attested in the 1580s, is &quot;a pit for fighting cocks&quot;, referring to the place where cockfights were held. This meaning no doubt influenced both lines of evolution of the term, since a cockpit in this sense was a tight enclosure where a great deal of stress or tension would occur.

From about 1935, &quot;cockpit&quot; came to be used informally to refer to the driver&#x27;s cabin, especially in high performance cars, and this is official terminology used to describe the compartment that the driver occupies in a Formula One car.

In an airliner, the cockpit is usually referred to as the &quot;flight deck&quot;, the term deriving from its use by the RAF for the separate, upper platform in large flying boats where the pilot and co-pilot sat. In the USA and many other countries, however, the term cockpit is also used for airliners.

The seat of a powerboat racing craft is also referred to as the cockpit.

== Ergonomics == 
The first airplane with an enclosed cabin appeared in 1912 on the Avro Type F; however, during the early 1920s there were many passenger aircraft in which the crew remained open to the air while the passengers sat in a cabin. Military biplanes and the first single-engined fighters and attack aircraft also had open cockpits, some as late as the Second World War when enclosed cockpits became the norm.

The largest impediment to having closed cabins was the material used to make the windows. Prior to Perspex becoming available in 1933, windows were either safety glass, which was heavy, or cellulose nitrate (i.e.: guncotton), which yellowed quickly and was extremely flammable. In the mid-1920s many aircraft manufacturers began using enclosed cockpits for the first time. Early airplanes with closed cockpits include the 1924 Fokker F.VII, the 1926 German Junkers W 34 transport, the 1926 Ford Trimotor, the 1927 Lockheed Vega, the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; and the passenger aircraft manufactured by the Douglas and Boeing companies during the mid-1930s. Open-cockpit airplanes were almost extinct by the mid-1950s, with the exception of training planes, crop-dusters and homebuilt aircraft designs.

Cockpit windows may be equipped with a sun shield. Most cockpits have windows that can be opened when the aircraft is on the ground. Nearly all glass windows in large aircraft have an anti-reflective coating, and an internal heating element to melt ice. Smaller aircraft may be equipped with a transparent aircraft canopy.

In most cockpits the pilot&#x27;s control column or joystick is located centrally (centre stick), although in some military fast jets the side-stick is located on the right hand side. In some commercial airliners (i.e.: Airbus—which features the glass cockpit concept) both pilots use a side-stick located on the outboard side, so Captain&#x27;s side-stick on the left and First-officer&#x27;s seat on the right.

Except for some helicopters, the &quot;right seat&quot; in the cockpit of an aircraft is the seat used by the co-pilot. The captain or pilot in command sits in the &quot;&quot;, so that they can operate the throttles and other pedestal instruments with their right hand. The tradition has been maintained to this day, with the co-pilot on the right hand side.

The layout of the cockpit, especially in the military fast jet, has undergone standardisation, both within and between aircraft, manufacturers and even nations. An important development was the &quot;Basic Six&quot; pattern, later the &quot;Basic T&quot;, developed from 1937 onwards by the Royal Air Force, designed to optimise pilot instrument scanning.

Ergonomics and Human Factors concerns are important in the design of modern cockpits. The layout and function of cockpit displays controls are designed to increase pilot situation awareness without causing information overload. In the past, many cockpits, especially in fighter aircraft, limited the size of the pilots that could fit into them. Now, cockpits are being designed to accommodate from the 1st percentile female physical size to the 99th percentile male size.

In the design of the cockpit in a military fast jet, the traditional &quot;knobs and dials&quot; associated with the cockpit are mainly absent. Instrument panels are now almost wholly replaced by electronic displays, which are themselves often re-configurable to save space. While some hard-wired dedicated switches must still be used for reasons of integrity and safety, many traditional controls are replaced by multi-function re-configurable controls or so-called &quot;soft keys&quot;. Controls are incorporated onto the stick and throttle to enable the pilot to maintain a head-up and eyes-out position – the Hands On Throttle And Stick or HOTAS concept. These controls may be then further augmented by control media such as head pointing with a Helmet Mounted Sighting System or Direct voice input (DVI). Advances in auditory displays allow for Direct Voice Output of aircraft status information and for the spatial localisation of warning sounds for improved monitoring of aircraft systems.

The layout of control panels in modern airliners has become largely unified across the industry. The majority of the systems-related controls (such as electrical, fuel, hydraulics and pressurization) for example, are usually located in the ceiling on an overhead panel. Radios are generally placed on a panel between the pilot&#x27;s seats known as the pedestal. Automatic flight controls such as the autopilot are usually placed just below the windscreen and above the main instrument panel on the glareshield. A central concept in the design of the cockpit is the Design Eye Position or &quot;DEP&quot;, from which point all displays should be visible.

Most modern cockpits will also include some kind of integrated warning system.

A study undertaken in 2013, to assess methods for cockpit-user menu navigation, found that touchscreen produced the &quot;best scores&quot;.

After the September 11, 2001 attacks, all major airlines fortified their cockpits against access by hijackers.

==Flight instruments==
In the modern electronic cockpit, the electronic flight instruments usually regarded as essential are MFD, PFD, ND, EICAS, FMS/CDU and back-up instruments.

===MCP===
A Mode control panel, usually a long narrow panel located centrally in front of the pilot, may be used to control heading, speed, altitude, vertical speed, vertical navigation and lateral navigation. It may also be used to engage or disengage both the autopilot and the autothrottle. The panel as an area is usually referred to as the &quot;glareshield panel&quot;. MCP is a Boeing designation (that has been informally adopted as a generic name for the unit/panel) for a unit that allows for the selection and parameter setting of the different autoflight functions, the same unit on an Airbus aircraft is referred to as the FCU (Flight Control unit).

===PFD===
The primary flight display is usually located in a prominent position, either centrally or on either side of the cockpit. It will in most cases include a digitized presentation of the attitude indicator, air speed and altitude indicators (usually as a tape display) and the vertical speed indicator. It will in many cases include some form of heading indicator and ILS/VOR deviation indicators. In many cases an indicator of the engaged and armed autoflight system modes will be present along with some form of indication of the selected values for altitude, speed, vertical speed and heading. It may be pilot selectable to swap with the ND.

===ND===
A navigation display, which may be adjacent to the PFD, shows the route and information on the next waypoint, wind speed and wind direction. It may be pilot selectable to swap with the PFD.

===EICAS/ECAM===
The Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System (EICAS), used by Boeing and Embraer, or the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor (ECAM), used by Airbus, allow the pilot to monitor the following information: values for N1, N2 and N3, fuel temperature, fuel flow, the electrical system, cockpit or cabin temperature and pressure, control surfaces and so on. The pilot may select display of information by means of button press.

===FMS/MCDU===
The flight management system/control and/or display unit may be used by the pilot to enter and check for the following information: flight plan, speed control, navigation control, etc.

===Back-up instruments===
In a less prominent part of the cockpit, in case of failure of the other instruments, there will be a battery-powered integrated standby instrument system along with a magnetic compass, showing essential flight information such as speed, altitude, attitude and heading.

==Aerospace industry technologies==
In the U.S. the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have researched the ergonomic aspects of cockpit design and have conducted investigations of airline industry accidents. Cockpit design disciplines include Cognitive science, Neuroscience, Human–computer interaction, Human Factors Engineering, Anthropometry and Ergonomics.

Aircraft designs have adopted the fully digital &quot;glass cockpit&quot;. In such designs, instruments and gauges, including navigational map displays, use a user interface markup language known as ARINC 661. This standard defines the interface between an independent cockpit display system, generally produced by a single manufacturer, and the avionics equipment and user applications it is required to support, by means of displays and controls, often made by different manufacturers. The separation between the overall display system, and the applications driving it, allows for specialization and independence.

<text>The fuselage (; from the French &quot;fuselé&quot; &quot;spindle-shaped&quot;) is an aircraft&#x27;s main body section. It holds crew, passengers, or cargo. In single-engine aircraft, it will usually contain an engine as well, although in some amphibious aircraft the single engine is mounted on a pylon attached to the fuselage, which in turn is used as a floating hull. The fuselage also serves to position the control and stabilization surfaces in specific relationships to lifting surfaces, which is required for aircraft stability and maneuverability.

== Types of structures ==

=== Truss structure ===
This type of structure is still in use in many lightweight aircraft using welded steel tube trusses.
A box truss fuselage structure can also be built out of wood—often covered with plywood. Simple box structures may be rounded by the addition of supported lightweight stringers, allowing the fabric covering to form a more aerodynamic shape, or one more pleasing to the eye.

=== Geodesic construction ===

Geodesic structural elements were used by Barnes Wallis for British Vickers between the wars and into World War II to form the whole of the fuselage, including its aerodynamic shape. In this type of construction multiple flat strip stringers are wound about the formers in opposite spiral directions, forming a basket-like appearance. This proved to be light, strong, and rigid and had the advantage of being made almost entirely of wood. A similar construction using aluminum alloy was used in the Vickers Warwick with less material than would be required for other structural types. The geodesic structure is also redundant and so can survive localized damage without catastrophic failure. A fabric covering over the structure completed the aerodynamic shell (see the Vickers Wellington for an example of a large warplane which uses this process). The logical evolution of this is the creation of fuselages using molded plywood, in which several sheets are laid with the grain in differing directions to give the monocoque type below.

=== Monocoque shell ===
In this method, the exterior surface of the fuselage is also the primary structure. A typical early form of this (see the Lockheed Vega) was built using molded plywood, where the layers of plywood are formed over a &quot;plug&quot; or within a mold. A later form of this structure uses fiberglass cloth impregnated with polyester or epoxy resin as the skin, instead of plywood. A simple form of this used in some amateur-built aircraft uses rigid expanded foam plastic as the core, with a fiberglass covering, eliminating the necessity of fabricating molds, but requiring more effort in finishing (see the Rutan VariEze). An example of a larger molded plywood aircraft is the de Havilland Mosquito fighter/light bomber of World War II.
No plywood-skin fuselage is truly monocoque, since stiffening elements are incorporated into the structure to carry concentrated loads that would otherwise buckle the thin skin.
The use of molded fiberglass using negative (&quot;female&quot;) molds (which give a nearly finished product) is prevalent in the series production of many modern sailplanes. The use of molded composites for fuselage structures is being extended to large passenger aircraft such as the Boeing 787 &quot;Dreamliner&quot; (using pressure-molding on female molds).

=== Semi-monocoque ===


This is the preferred method of constructing an all-aluminum fuselage. First, a series of formers in the shape of the fuselage cross sections are held in position on a rigid fixture. These formers are then joined with lightweight longitudinal elements called stringers. These are in turn covered with a skin of sheet aluminum, attached by riveting or by bonding with special adhesives. The fixture is then disassembled and removed from the completed fuselage shell, which is then fitted out with wiring, controls, and interior equipment such as seats and luggage bins. Most modern large aircraft are built using this technique, but use several large sections constructed in this fashion which are then joined with fasteners to form the complete fuselage. As the accuracy of the final product is determined largely by the costly fixture, this form is suitable for series production, where many identical aircraft are to be produced. Early examples of this type include the Douglas Aircraft DC-2 and DC-3 civil aircraft and the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. Most metal light aircraft are constructed using this process.

Both monocoque and semi-monocoque are referred to as &quot;stressed skin&quot; structures as all or a portion of the external load (i.e. from wings and empennage, and from discrete masses such as the engine) is taken by the surface covering. In addition, all the load from internal pressurization is carried (as &quot;skin tension&quot;) by the external skin.

The proportioning of loads between the components is a design choice dictated largely by the dimensions, strength, and elasticity of the components available for construction and whether or not a design is intended to be &quot;self jigging&quot;, not requiring a complete fixture for alignment.

== Materials ==

Early aircraft were constructed of wood frames covered in fabric. As monoplanes became popular, metal frames improved the strength, which eventually led to all-metal-structure aircraft, with metal covering for all its exterior surfaces - this was first pioneered in the second half of 1915. Some modern aircraft are constructed with composite materials for major control surfaces, wings, or the entire fuselage such as the Boeing 787. On the 787, it makes possible higher pressurization levels and larger windows for passenger comfort as well as lower weight to reduce operating costs. The Boeing 787 weighs less than if it were an all-aluminum assembly.

== Windows ==

Cockpit windshields on the Airbus A320 must withstand bird strikes up to and are made of chemically strengthened glass. They are usually composed of three layers or plies, of glass or plastic : the inner two are 8 mm (0.3 in.) thick each and are structural, while the outer ply, about 3 mm thick, is a barrier against foreign object damage and abrasion, with often a hydrophobic coating. It must prevent fogging inside the cabin and de-ice from . This was previously done with thin wires similar to a rear car window but is now accomplished with a transparent, nanometers-thick coating of indium tin oxide sitting between plies, electrically conductive and thus transmitting heat. Curved glass improves aerodynamics but sight criteria also needs larger panes. A cockpit windshield is composed of 4–6 panels, 35 kg (77 lb) each on an Airbus A320. In its lifetime, an average aircraft goes through three or four windshields, and the market is shared evenly between OEM and higher margins aftermarket.

Cabin windows, made from much lighter than glass stretched acrylic glass, consists of multiple panes: an outer one built to support four times the maximum cabin pressure, an inner one for redundancy and a scratch pane near the passenger. Acrylic is susceptible to crazing : a network of fine cracks appears but can be polished to restore optical transparency, removal and polishing typically undergo every 2–3 years for uncoated windows.

== Wing integration ==
&quot;Flying wing&quot; aircraft, such as the Northrop YB-49 Flying Wing and the Northrop B-2 Spirit bomber have no separate fuselage; instead what would be the fuselage is a thickened portion of the wing structure.

Conversely, there have been a small number of aircraft designs which have no separate wing, but use the fuselage to generate lift. Examples include National Aeronautics and Space Administration&#x27;s experimental lifting body designs and the Vought XF5U-1 Flying Flapjack.

A blended wing body can be considered a mixture of the above. It carries the useful load in a fuselage producing lift. A modern example is Boeing X-48. One of the earliest aircraft using this design approach is Burnelli CBY-3, which fuselage was airfoil shaped to produce lift.

<text>University College, informally known as Castle, is the oldest constituent college of Durham University in England. Centred on Durham Castle on Palace Green, it was founded in 1832 by William van Mildert, Bishop of Durham. As a constituent college of Durham University, it is listed as a higher education institution under section 216 of the Education Reform Act 1988. Almost all academic activities, such as research and tutoring, occur at a university level.

University College moved into its current location in 1837. Around 150 students are accommodated within Durham Castle. Other college buildings, including converted 18th century houses and purpose-built accommodation from the 1950s, 1970s and 1980s, are within five minutes&#x27; walk of the castle. The college has 700 undergraduates and is currently the most over-subscribed college of the university. In 1987 it admitted women undergraduates for the first time, having previously been an all-male college.

University College fosters a traditional atmosphere, encouraging its members to attend formal dinner which happens at least twice a week on Tuesday and Thursday. Formals take place in the great hall, consisting of a three-course dinner for which gowns are required dress. Students must also recite grace in Latin and must not stand until a senior member of the JCR has bowed to the high table. Castle also hosts the June Ball, a white-tie event as part of the end of examination celebrations.

From January 2012 until March 2019 the Master of the college was political theorist David Held. Wendy Powers joined as the college Principal on 1 June 2020.

==History==

===Early years===
University College was formed upon the creation of University of Durham in 1832. It was the first college of the university, and is therefore known as the &quot;foundation college&quot;, but the university was founded explicitly on the Oxbridge model; the intention was already for the university to develop along collegiate lines in the manner of Oxford and Cambridge, as it has.

Previously, for centuries, Durham Castle had been the bishop&#x27;s palace for the Bishop of Durham until the residence was moved to Auckland Castle in 1832. Bishop William van Mildert, one of the founders of the university, had intended for the castle to be given to the college. Temporary accommodation for students was provided at the Archdeacon&#x27;s Inn (now known as Cosin&#x27;s Hall) on Palace Green until University College moved into its permanent home in 1837 after van Mildert&#x27;s successor, Edward Maltby, completed renovations of the Castle.

The castle&#x27;s keep, formerly a ruin, was redeveloped for student accommodation; in particular, the college&#x27;s chapels and Great Hall have been restored. Since then high levels of maintenance have been, and still are, necessary to preserve the buildings of the castle.The university&#x27;s second college, Hatfield Hall, was formed in 1846 as a response to the high costs of maintaining Castle. These costs arose from the students&#x27; expectations of being provided with servants and room furnishings. 
The university struggled for the rest of the 19th century, held back by a lack of prestige and a distance from the centres of power in the UK. 
By 1882, Castle contained some 79 undergraduates out of 205 at the university as a whole. Despite the university largely failing to gain recognition and prestige, a number of other colleges had opened by the end of the nineteenth century. Of these, Bishop Cosin&#x27;s Hall failed to become financially viable and was absorbed into University College in 1864. Enrolment numbers continued to fluctuate.

===1919–38===
The inter-war years were transformative for Castle. The college was the smallest in Durham university, with just 34 undergraduates in 1928,
and was struggling to meet maintenance costs. The Castle, situated on the banks of &quot;The Peninsula&quot;, was in danger of collapsing into the River Wear and many of its internal structures were weak. The combination of high costs and low undergraduate numbers meant that the college was often threatened with closure or merger with Hatfield. Castle was saved largely through charitable donations. A visit in the 1920s from Edward, Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII), helped increase the profile of the cause. In the 1920s, the castle&#x27;s foundations were secured through reinforcement with concrete. Following these and other extensive building refurbishments of the 1920s and 1930s the college was now able to expand.

===Post-war===
One of its most successful periods followed during the Second World War when personnel of the Durham University Air Squadron were posted in the castle, doing short courses before joining the Royal Air Force. Those from the college who died during World War II were commemorated by the redevelopment of the Norman Gallery area of the Castle in the 1950s. This period also saw the launch of &quot;Castellum&quot;, an annual journal of the Castle Society, created to keep former students in touch with college life. In order to continue this expansion, the college purchased Lumley Castle in 1946 to house students, and by 1948 seventy five students were housed there. This section of the college developed a spirit of its own and is still remembered today through activities such as the Lumley Run.

During the 1950s and 1960s the college expanded through developments at Owengate (later renovated in 2014) and Bailey Court, both around Palace Green. In the 1970s, the college&#x27;s lease of Lumley Castle ended. Moatside Court was instead developed, and meant that all the college&#x27;s students were now housed within five minutes of the main castle. During this period there was rapid change in the size and structure of the college, which expanded to over 300 undergraduates by 1979.

Female students were admitted to the college for the first time in 1987; until then it had been single sex. Since this time the college has become fully mixed, with undergraduate numbers expanding to nearly seven hundred. Expansion caused a strain on college numbers, however, and in 2004 the college was unable to provide accommodation for all of its fresher students for the first time in its history. Following the foundation of Josephine Butler in 2006, Durham&#x27;s first new college to be opened since 1972, pressure from the university to take on additional students lessened, and undergraduate numbers were intentionally reduced in the following years. In line with the wider UK expansion of the higher education sector, the college expanded again in the 2010&#x27;s, with the opening of a new self catered site in Durham City centre at Kepier Court.

== College traditions ==

=== College arms ===
Although it had been in use before this period, the college arms were officially granted by the College of Arms on 29 May 1912, on the occasion of the eightieth anniversary since the founding of the college by the Bishop of Durham in 1832. The arms are blazoned: &quot;Azure, a Cross patonce or, between four Lions rampant Argent, on a Chief of the last, the Cross of St Cuthbert Sable, between two Durham Mitres Gules.&quot; The blue field with the gold cross and four lions are the arms of the Diocese of Durham, the mitres represent the Bishop and St. Cuthbert&#x27;s cross is included as Durham Cathedral is dedicated to, and is the resting place of St. Cuthbert. Underneath is the motto, in Latin, &quot;Non nobis solum&quot;, meaning &quot;Not for ourselves alone&quot;. It is derived from a sentence quoting Plato in Cicero&#x27;s most influential philosophical work, his treatise &quot;De Officiis (On Duties).&quot; 
=== Grace ===
Before being served at formal hall, on the Tuesday and Thursday evening of each week during term-time, students recite the following Latin grace, led by a senior member of the JCR. Although the origin of the grace is officially unknown, an almost identical version was in use at the time as a post-prandial grace by Westminster School. &quot;Domine omnipotens, aeterne Deus; qui tam benigne nos pascere hoc tempore dignatus es; largire nobis, ut tibi semper pro tua in nos bonitate ex animo gratias agamus; vitam honeste et pie transigamus; et studia ea sectemur quae gloriam tuam illustrare et ecclesiae tuae adiumenta esse possint; per Christum dominum nostrum. Amen.&quot; Translated into English, it reads as follows:Almighty Lord, eternal God; who hast so graciously deigned to feed us at this time; grant to us, that we may ever give Thee heartfelt thanks for Thy goodness to us; that we may pass our lives honourably and piously; and that we may follow such pursuits as can shed light on Thy glory and afford assistance to Thy church; through Christ our Lord. Amen.

==Buildings and architecture==

Construction of Durham Castle began in 1072, which makes it the oldest building in use at any University in the world.
The castle retains much of its original design and structure, and is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site with Durham Cathedral.

The castle&#x27;s northern wing originally contained a dining hall, but this was later divided up to make more luxurious quarters for the Prince Bishop. This area is also home to the two chapels of the college. The Norman Chapel dates from the 11th century and is the oldest accessible part of the castle, and retains its original Saxon architectural style. The Tunstall Chapel is the larger of the two; it dates from the 15th century and is named after Cuthbert Tunstall. It houses the college organ. Both chapels are used for worship within the college. University College is one of two colleges in Durham to have two chapels, the other being Hild Bede.
To the east of the courtyard lies the Keep. It was re-built in the 1840 by Anthony Salvin, having previously lain in ruins. This area has the largest concentration of students living in the castle. To the south of the courtyard is the Gatehouse, built originally by Hugh de Puiset in the 12th century and re-developed in the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries. Around this are the college&#x27;s more modern offices.

The college&#x27;s other buildings are at Moatside Court, Owengate and Bailey Court. The developments at Moatside Court and Bailey Court date from the 1960s and 1970s, whilst Owengate was formed from a series of old houses in the 1950s. Of these, Moatside Court&#x27;s rooms were of a notoriously poor quality, but were renovated in 2006 at the cost of over £1 million. Moatside now contains a gym and kitchens on every floor. 
===Great Hall===
To the west of the courtyard is the medieval Great Hall, still used as a dining room by students and staff. It was built during the time of Anthony Bek in the 13th century. For two hundred years this was the largest Great Hall in Great Britain; however, it was shortened by Richard Foxe. It still stands some 14 m (46 ft) high and 30 m (98 ft) long. The black staircase that leads from the Great Hall to the Senior Common Room dates from 1662, and is another of the older sections of the college still in use. Underneath the Hall is the college bar, located in an 11th-century undercroft. Around these are student accommodation, the Lowe Library, and kitchens. The Victorian minstrel&#x27;s gallery at the southern end of the hall is now used a student study space.

===Lowe Library===
The Lowe Library is the college&#x27;s library. It was formed from a bequest from Colonel W.D.Lowe, an officer of the Durham University Officers&#x27; Training Corps. He later became a Classics tutor at the university and rowing coach for University College, staying until his death in 1921. The library was opened in 1925, extended into the college&#x27;s wine cellar in 1997, and now contains over 10,000 books. Spread over three floors, it acts as a support to the central university library, providing access to core textbooks.

== Masters ==

The college is formerly headed by a &quot;Master&quot;, since 2020 titled principal, which is the most senior position in the SCR. As the first master of University College, Archdeacon Charles Thorp, also held the post of university warden. Following Thorp&#x27;s death in 1862 the mastership was created as a separate position. All past Masters have their portrait hanging in the Great Hall or SCR ante-room.

==Role and activities==

University College is the most over-subscribed college at the university; for entry in 2006, there were 2,858 applications for just 170 places (approximately 17 applicants for every place). As with all colleges at Durham, students study for degrees with Durham University, not their college, and teaching takes place in academic departments. University College is a &quot;listed body&quot; under the Education Reform Act (1988).

Although colleges are largely concerned with welfare, leisure and accommodation, University College has been running the &#x27;Durham Castle Lecture Series&#x27; since 2012. Past speakers have included Saskia Sassen, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Rowan Williams, Anthony Giddens, Justin Welby, Martin Wolf, Noam Chomsky and Peter Singer.

Within Durham&#x27;s colleges, there is a strong competitive rivalry. Castle&#x27;s main rival is Hatfield College, which is Durham&#x27;s second oldest college, having separated from Castle in the 1850s. The rivalry is maintained by student pranks and tricks and in various intercollegiate sporting events.

The college has a commercial arm, taking advantage of the attractive nature of the college&#x27;s buildings. It hosts corporate events, conferences and weddings during the university vacations.

The Castle is open to tourists only via guided tours. These occur daily outside of term time, but are more restricted during the term due to potential conflicts with the running of the college. Furthermore, events in the university timetable may result in their cancellation. Tourists are not otherwise permitted entry to the college or any common areas. There is relatively little conflict between students and tourists, with many of the guided tours done by students themselves.

=== Formals ===
Students are expected to wear smart clothes and gowns during Formals, which take place twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the Great Hall. All those attending the formal must stand when the High Table enters, when grace is being said or sung, and when the Senior Student is bowing out. Complete silence is observed during these periods. Following grace, there is no standing throughout the formal until the Senior Student has bowed out to the Master, a symbol of the official opening or closing of the formal meal.

==Student body==
Some 700 undergraduates attend Castle, making it slightly smaller than the average Durham college. Of these students, around 100 live in the castle itself, while another 250 are housed in the college&#x27;s surrounding buildings.
It remains the most popular college in Durham for applications, with around 27 students applying for every available place.

The undergraduate student body (Junior Common Room or JCR) is governed by an elected Executive Committee headed by the Senior Student and supported by several other officers. Regular JCR meetings are held to discuss and vote on important issues. There are several other elected non-executive officers such as Returning Officer, Fresher Rep and Sports Captain who organise other important college functions. The Senior Student meets regularly with college and university authorities to represent the JCR.

The JCR runs three balls every year for its students, with one held during each term. The largest is the end of year June Ball, which is the social highlight of the academic year. Tradition dictates that its theme remains closely hidden until the doors to the Castle open.

The graduate community at Castle forms the Middle Common Room (MCR), which is based in the Maurice Tucker (previously William de St-Calais) Room. However, due to size restrictions, no members of the MCR are currently able to live in the college grounds. The MCR, like the JCR, organises a number of social events and activities, such as the college&#x27;s entry into the inter-collegiate University Challenge competition, which acts as trials for the university&#x27;s team. The Senior Common Room (SCR), is an organisation of academics and tutors connected to the college. The SCR also organises formal meals with guest speakers.

The student bar of University College is called the Undercroft Bar (known colloquially as The Undie), due to its location in an 11th-century Undercroft. It developed from the original Junior Common Room, which opened in the early 1950s. It is currently run by the Food and Beverage Services Manager with the help of several JCR members. In 2018 a new college café replaced the Toastie Bar in the West Courtyard. 
===Societies===
University College JCR also supports many societies run exclusively for Castle students. The most popular societies include University College Boat Club (UCBC), Castle Theatre Company, Mixed Lacrosse, Castle Rugby Club, Castle Football Club, and Castle Hockey Club.

There are a number of arts societies within the college. Most notable is Castle Theatre Company, which produces a play each term. These plays are usually performed on the college&#x27;s grounds, although they sometimes tour nationally. They have also appeared at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

==Castle Society==
The Castle Society was formed in 1947 by Castle Alumni. It was originally named the Durham Castleman&#x27;s Society. Membership is open to anyone with academic ties to the college, and its aim is to create a wider Castle community beyond its immediate students. The society makes regular donations to the college library, chapel, student bursaries, and various college societies. It has helped fund a number of projects in the college, including the accommodation at Moatside Court and Fellows Garden, as well as the West Courtyard Common Room. The Castle Society produces the annual journal &quot;Castellum&quot;, which chronicles life at the Castle and reports on activities of Castle alumni. Since 1990, it has contributed towards the University College Durham Trust, the college&#x27;s charitable fund.

==Notable alumni==
Castle alumni are active through organisations and events such as the two annual reunion dinners, which cater for the more than 7,000 living alumni. 
A number of Castle alumni have made significant contributions in the fields of government, law, science, academia, business, arts, journalism, and athletics, among others.

<text>Douglas Ross Hyde (; 17 January 1860 – 12 July 1949), known as (), was an Irish academic, linguist, scholar of the Irish language, politician, and diplomat who served as the first president of Ireland from June 1938 to June 1945. He was a leading figure in the Gaelic revival, and the first President of the Gaelic League, one of the most influential cultural organisations in Ireland at the time.

==Background==
Hyde was born at Longford House in Castlerea, County Roscommon, while his mother, Elizabeth Hyde (née Oldfield; 1834–1886), was on a short visit. His father, Arthur Hyde, whose family was originally from Castlehyde near Fermoy, County Cork, was Church of Ireland rector of Kilmactranny, County Sligo, from 1852 to 1867, and it was here that Hyde spent his early years. Arthur Hyde and Elizabeth Oldfield married in County Roscommon, in 1852, and had three other children: Arthur Hyde (1853–79 in County Leitrim), John Oldfield Hyde (1854–96 in County Dublin), and Hugh Hyde (1856).
In 1867, his father was appointed prebendary and rector of Tibohine, and the family moved to neighbouring Frenchpark, in County Roscommon. He was home-schooled by his father and his aunt due to a childhood illness. While a young man, he became fascinated with hearing the old people in the locality speak the Irish language. He was influenced in particular by the gamekeeper Séamus Hart and his friend&#x27;s wife, Mrs. Connolly. Aged 14, Hyde was devastated when Hart died, and his interest in the Irish language—the first language he began to study in any detail, as his own undertaking—flagged for a while. However, he visited Dublin several times and realised that there were groups of people, just like him, interested in Irish, a language looked down on at the time by many and seen as backward and old-fashioned.

Rejecting family pressure that, like past generations of Hydes, he would follow a career as an Anglican clergyman, Hyde instead became an academic. He entered Trinity College Dublin, where he became fluent in French, Latin, German, Greek, and Hebrew, graduating in 1884 as a moderator in modern literature. A medallist of the College Historical Society, he was elected its president in 1931. His passion for the language revival of Irish, which was already in severe decline, led him to help found the Gaelic League, or in Irish, , in 1893.

Hyde married German-born but British-raised Lucy Kurtz in 1893. The couple had two daughters, Nuala and Úna.

==Conradh na Gaeilge/Gaelic League==

Hyde joined the Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language around 1880, and between 1879 and 1884, he published more than a hundred pieces of Irish verse under the pen name ().

Initially derided, the Irish language movement gained a mass following. Hyde helped establish the &quot;Gaelic Journal&quot; in 1892; in November, he wrote a manifesto called &quot;The necessity for de-anglicising the Irish nation&quot;, arguing that Ireland should follow its own traditions in language, literature, and dress.

In 1893, he helped found Conradh na Gaeilge (the Gaelic League) to encourage the preservation of Irish culture, music, dance and language. A new generation of Irish republicans (including Pádraig Pearse, Éamon de Valera, Michael Collins and Ernest Blythe), became politicised through their involvement in Conradh na Gaeilge. Hyde filled out the 1911 census form in Irish.

Uncomfortable with the growing politicisation of the movement, Hyde resigned the presidency in 1915. He was succeeded by the League&#x27;s co-founder Eoin MacNeill.

==Senator==

Hyde had no association with Sinn Féin and the independence movement. He was elected to Seanad Éireann, the upper house of the Irish Free State&#x27;s Oireachtas (parliament), at a by-election on 4 February 1925, replacing Sir Hutcheson Poë.

In the 1925 Seanad election, Hyde placed 28th of the 78 candidates, with 19 seats available. The Catholic Truth Society opposed him for his Protestantism and publicised his supposed support for divorce. Historians have suggested that the CTS campaign was ineffective, and that Irish-language advocates performed poorly, with all those endorsed by the Gaelic League losing.

He returned to academia as Professor of Irish at University College Dublin, where one of his students was future Attorney General of Ireland, Chief Justice of Ireland and President of Ireland, Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh.

==President of Ireland==

===Nomination===

In April 1938, by now retired from academia, Hyde was plucked from retirement by Taoiseach Éamon de Valera and again appointed to Seanad Éireann. Again his tenure proved short, even shorter than before; however, this time it was because Hyde was chosen, after inter-party negotiations—following an initial suggestion by Fine Gael—to be the first President of Ireland, to which office he was elected unopposed. He was selected for a number of reasons:

*Both the Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, and the Leader of the Opposition, W. T. Cosgrave, admired him.
*Both wanted a President with universal prestige to lend credibility to the new office, especially since the new 1937 Constitution made it unclear whether the President or the British monarch was the official head of state.
*Both wanted to purge the humiliation that had occurred when Hyde lost his Senate seat in 1925.
*Both wanted a President who would prove there was no danger that the holder of the office would become an authoritarian dictator, a widespread fear when the new constitution was being discussed in 1937.
*Both wanted to pay tribute to Hyde&#x27;s role in promoting the Irish language.
*Both wanted to choose a non-Catholic to disprove the assertion that the State was a &quot;confessional state&quot;, although on 11 May 1937 Seán MacEntee, the Fianna Fáil Minister of Finance, had described the 1937 Constitution in Dáil Éireann as &quot;the Constitution of a Catholic State&quot;.

===Inauguration===

Hyde was inaugurated as the first President of Ireland, on 26 June 1938. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; reported it as follows:

Hyde set a precedent by reciting the Presidential Declaration of Office in Irish. His recitation, in Roscommon Irish, is one of a few recordings of a dialect of which Hyde was one of the last speakers. Upon inauguration, he moved into the long-vacant &quot;Viceregal Lodge&quot; in Phoenix Park, since known as Áras an Uachtaráin.

Hyde&#x27;s selection and inauguration received worldwide media attention and was covered by newspapers in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, and even Egypt. Hitler &quot;ordered&quot; the Berlin newspapers &quot;to splash&quot; on the Irish presidential installation ceremony. However, the British government ignored the event. The Northern Ireland Finance Minister, J. M. Andrews, described Hyde&#x27;s inauguration as a &quot;slight on the King&quot; and &quot;a deplorable tragedy&quot;.

===Presidency===

Despite being placed in a position to shape the office of the presidency via precedent, Hyde by and large opted for a quiet, conservative interpretation of the office. His age and health obligated him to schedule periods of rest throughout his days, and his lack of political experience caused him to defer to his advisers on questions of policy and discretionary powers, especially to his Secretary, Michael McDunphy. On 13 November 1938, just months after Hyde&#x27;s inauguration, Hyde attended an international soccer match between Ireland and Poland at Dalymount Park in Dublin. This was seen as breaching the GAA&#x27;s ban on &#x27;foreign games&#x27; and he was subsequently removed as patron of the GAA, an honour he had held since 1902.

After a massive stroke in April 1940, plans were made for his lying-in-state and a state funeral. However, Hyde survived, albeit paralysed and having to use a wheelchair.

Although the role of the President of Ireland is largely ceremonial, the president has the authority under the Constitution of Ireland to refuse to grant a dissolution of the Dáil where the Taoiseach has ceased to retain the support of a majority of the Dáil. The president is also the guardian of the constitution and may refer legislation to the Supreme Court before signing it into law.

Hyde was confronted with a crisis in 1944 when de Valera&#x27;s government unexpectedly collapsed in a vote on the Transport Bill. De Valera asked Hyde for a dissolution of the Dáil. If a dissolution is granted, a general election is proclaimed to fill the seats thereby vacated. This means that for four to six weeks until the new Dáil assembled, there is no Dáil. Fearing this gap might facilitate an invasion during World War II, during which no parliament could be called upon to act, the Oireachtas enacted the General Elections (Emergency Powers) Act 1943, legislation under the emergency provisions of Article 28.3.3°), which allowed an election to be called separate from a dissolution, with the Dáil only being dissolved just before new Dáil would assemble. This ensured the gap between Dála (plural of Dáil) would be too short to cause a vacuum in major decision-making. Under the Act, the President could &quot;refuse to proclaim a general election on the advice of a Taoiseach who had ceased to retain the support of a majority in Dáil Éireann&quot;. Hyde had that option but, after considering it with his senior advisor Michael McDunphy, he granted the dissolution.

Hyde twice used his prerogative under Article 26 of the Constitution, having consulted the Council of State, to refer a Bill or part of a Bill to the Supreme Court, for the court&#x27;s decision on whether the Bill or part referred is repugnant to the Constitution (so that the Bill in question cannot be signed into law). On the first occasion, the court held that the Bill referred – Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill 1940 – was not repugnant to the Constitution. In response to the second reference, the Court decided that the particular provision referred to – section 4 of the School Attendance Bill 1942 – was repugnant to the Constitution. Because of Article 34.3.3° of the Constitution, the constitutional validity of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1940 cannot be challenged in any court, since the Bill which became that Act was found by the Supreme Court not to be repugnant in the context of an Article 26 reference.

One of Hyde&#x27;s last presidential acts was a visit to the German Ambassador Eduard Hempel, on 3 May 1945, to offer his formal condolences on the death of Adolf Hitler. The visit remained a secret until 2005.

==Retirement and death==

Hyde left office on 25 June 1945, opting not to nominate himself for a second term. Owing to his ill-health he did not return to his Roscommon home, &quot;Ratra&quot;, empty since the death of his wife early in his term. He moved into the former residence of the Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant, on the grounds of Áras an Uachtaráin, which he renamed &quot;Little Ratra&quot;, where he lived out the remaining four years of his life. He died at 10pm on 12 July 1949, aged 89.

==State funeral==


As a former President of Ireland, Hyde was accorded a state funeral. As he was a member of the Church of Ireland, his funeral service took place in Dublin&#x27;s Church of Ireland St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. However, contemporary rules of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland prohibited its members from attending services in non-Catholic churches. As a result, all but one member of the Catholic cabinet, Noël Browne, remained outside the cathedral grounds while the funeral service took place. They then joined the cortège when his coffin left the cathedral. Éamon de Valera, by now Leader of the Opposition, also did not attend. He was represented instead by a senior Fianna Fáil figure who was a member of the Church of Ireland, Erskine H. Childers, a future President of Ireland himself. Hyde was buried in Frenchpark, County Roscommon at Portahard Church, (where he had spent most of his childhood life) beside his wife Lucy, his daughter Nuala, his sister Annette, his mother Elizabeth, and his father Arthur.

<text>Seán Thomas O&#x27;Kelly (; 25 August 1882 – 23 November 1966), originally John T. O&#x27;Kelly, was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as the second president of Ireland from June 1945 to June 1959. He also served as deputy prime minister of Ireland from 1932 to 1945 (titled as Vice-President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State from 1932 to 1937 and as Tánaiste from 1937 to 1945), Minister for Local Government and Public Health from 1932 to 1939, Minister for Finance from 1939 to 1945 and Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann from 1919 to 1921. He was a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1918 to 1945.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Kelly was born in inner-city Dublin, although his exact place of birth is disputed. Baptised as John, he was the eldest son of Samuel O&#x27;Kelly, a boot and shoemaker of Berkley Road, by his marriage to Catherine O&#x27;Dea, and had three sisters and four brothers, two of whom were educated by Patrick Pearse at St Enda&#x27;s School.

O&#x27;Kelly&#x27;s first school was the Sisters of Charity, in Mountjoy Street (1886–1890), then the Christian Brothers School in St Mary&#x27;s Place (1890–1894). His senior school education was at O&#x27;Connell School, a Christian Brothers school in North Richmond Street (1894–1898). O&#x27;Kelly joined the National Library of Ireland in 1898 as a junior assistant to T. W. Lyster, remaining there until 1902, and becoming a subscriber to the Celtic Literary Society. The same year, he joined the Gaelic League, becoming a member of the governing body in 1910 and general secretary in 1915. He was appointed manager of An Claidheamh Soluis, which included amongst its editors the revolutionary leaders of Sinn Féin.

==Active in Sinn Féin==

He went to work almost immediately for Arthur Griffith, at the Gaelic League on the organization&#x27;s administration papers. He came to Griffith&#x27;s notice the previous years joining the Irish Republican Brotherhood as a member of the esoteric Bartholomew Teeling Circle from 1901. O&#x27;Kelly joined Sinn Féin, then a small dual-monarchist, capitalist party, immediately at its inception in 1905, as one of its founders. He became a joint-honorary secretary of the movement from 1908, remaining in the post until 1925. In 1906, he was elected to Dublin Corporation, and retained the seat for the Inns Quay Ward until 1924. One acolyte campaigner was Thomas Kelly, who joined him in pressing the government for improved municipal drainage schemes for Dublin&#x27;s slums.

Like Father Michael O&#x27;Flanagan, O&#x27;Kelly was chosen to make an Irish language address to the Pope Pius X, in 1908. Both men were bilingual party members promoting Irish culture. O&#x27;Kelly was one of the establishing members of the Irish Volunteers in 1913. In August 1914, he agitated to suppress the landing of arms at Kilcoole, County Wicklow.

In March 1915, O&#x27;Kelly went to New York City, to inform Clan Na Gael of the plans for a rising in Dublin by the IRB.

===Easter Rising===
It was during the Easter Rising that O&#x27;Kelly met Mary Ryan. She was arrested on 18 May 1916, with her sister Nell for unspecified offences to be incarcerated in Mountjoy Prison. Historians have argued that she may have been confused with her sister, Min Ryan. Kit, as Mary Ryan was known, was Professor of French at University College Dublin. She shared her house with her sisters at 19 Ranelagh Road, Dublin, which O&#x27;Kelly visited. They were married in 1918.

O&#x27;Kelly was at the heart of the party operation. He was one of a handful of men who might have known of the &quot;All-Ireland&quot; Volunteer HQ at Athenry, County Galway, according to Liam Ó Briain involved in marshalling the rebellion in the western hills from Limerick across the Shannon. He was also responsible for springing Bulmer Hobson from the custody of the IRB. Thereafter Hobson&#x27;s mysterious &quot;disappearance&quot; became the moment when &quot;a devoted son&quot; of Ireland was excluded from the movement; but O&#x27;Kelly may have saved his life. During the Rising he was gazetted Staff Captain by PH Pearse. He was in and out of the GPO, and was requested to set up as &quot;Civil Administrator of the Government of the Republic&quot; with four others. The project never proceeded, as perhaps no attempt was made to anticipate preparations for a political structure free from Britain.

After the Easter Rising in 1916, O&#x27;Kelly was gaoled, released, and re-arrested. He was sent to Reading Gaol, and then escaped from detention in HM Prison Eastwood Park in Britain, and returned to Ireland. &quot;Sinn Fein became a cloak for Volunteer meetings&quot; Sinn Féin won a landslide victory.

==1918 general election==
O&#x27;Kelly was elected a Sinn Féin Member of Parliament (MP) for Dublin College Green, in the 1918 general election. In his role as Secretary, O&#x27;Kelly was tasked with preparing the Sinn Féin Executive Council for the Dáil Éireann Constituent Assembly, which had been agreed at the party Ard Fheis in October 1918. Along with other Sinn Féin MPs, he refused to take his seat in the UK House of Commons in London. Instead, they set up an Irish Parliament, called Dáil Éireann, in Dublin. O&#x27;Kelly served as Ceann Comhairle (chairperson) of the First Dáil. O&#x27;Kelly published the Democratic Programme, which he himself had edited. It appealed to a wider mission statement for independence and separatism, which was not sanctioned by the electorate. In fact, it was a skeleton document borrowed on the back of Pearse&#x27;s martyrdom, written in the late leader&#x27;s style, from the Labour leader Thomas Johnson.

O&#x27;Kelly&#x27;s approach to US President Woodrow Wilson to visit Dublin in 1919 on his way to Versailles, France, was roundly rejected. Wilson was already withdrawing from the Self-Determination League, making his critics label O&#x27;Kelly as &#x27;pompous.&#x27; Despite the US Senate resolution in June, the President would not break his commitment to the Big Four for unanimity. He also served as the Irish Republic&#x27;s envoy, demanding recognition of the Republic and its admittance to the post-World War I peace treaty negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference. While this request to Clemenceau was sincere, it naively ignored the fact that France and Britain had been allied for the previous four years. O&#x27;Kelly was followed to Paris as envoy by the eminently better-qualified George Gavan Duffy, who was from a titled family of barristers and diplomats. In 1920, O&#x27;Kelly relocated to Italy, where he met with Pope Benedict XV, briefing the pontiff on the political situation in Ireland. At the same time, O&#x27;Kelly met with the future dictator of Italy, Benito Mussolini, who helped the Irishman and other Sinn Féin emissaries to source weapons for use by the IRA.

==Close friend of de Valera==
O&#x27;Kelly was a close associate of Éamon de Valera, who served variously as President of Dáil Éireann (Prime Minister from April 1919 to August 1921) and President of the Republic (from August 1921 to January 1922). As with de Valera, he opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty, signed by representatives of the British and Irish governments in December 1921.

When de Valera resigned as President of the Republic on 6 January 1922, O&#x27;Kelly returned from Paris to Dublin, to try to negotiate a compromise, whereby de Valera could return to the presidency. A furious de Valera turned down the offer and ordered O&#x27;Kelly to return to Paris.

During the Irish Civil War, O&#x27;Kelly was in jail until December 1923. Afterwards, he spent the next two years as a Sinn Féin envoy to the United States.

==A founder of Fianna Fáil==
In 1926, when de Valera left Sinn Féin to establish Fianna Fáil, O&#x27;Kelly returned to Ireland and was appointed a vice-president of the new republican party. In March 1927, he became editor of The Nation and played a significant role in building up support for the new party before the June 1927 general election.

In 1932, when de Valera, having won that year&#x27;s general election, was appointed President of the Executive Council (Prime Minister of the Irish Free State), O&#x27;Kelly was appointed as vice-president of the Executive Council (deputy prime minister). He was also named Minister for Local Government. O&#x27;Kelly earned a controversial reputation over his key role in attempts to publicly humiliate the then Governor-General of the Irish Free State, James McNeill. Stunts such as withdrawing the Irish Army&#x27;s band from playing at diplomatic functions which the Governor-General attended, or in one notorious case the sight of O&#x27;Kelly and Defense Minister Frank Aiken storming out of a diplomatic function at the French Legation when McNeill, the guest of honour, had arrived, damaged O&#x27;Kelly&#x27;s reputation and image, particularly when the campaign backfired.

McNeill published his correspondence on the issue with de Valera, making de Valera appear foolish, before resigning and leaving de Valera with the task of choosing a new Governor-General, an embarrassing situation for a politician who had tried his best to avoid any association with the office. To the surprise of many, O&#x27;Kelly was not among the names considered for the office. It is not known for certain, but suspicion rests on O&#x27;Kelly&#x27;s membership of a Catholic fraternal organisation, the Knights of Columbanus, which de Valera suspected had a source in the cabinet. O&#x27;Kelly matched the bill, perhaps through indiscretions rather than deliberate actions. However, O&#x27;Kelly was not made Governor-General, the post instead going to the former Fianna Fáil TD, Domhnall Ua Buachalla from County Kildare, who would be the last Governor-General of the Irish Free State.

==Considered for President of Ireland in 1938==
With the enactment of a new constitution in 1937, O&#x27;Kelly remained de Valera&#x27;s second-in-command, with the new title of Tánaiste.

In 1938, again O&#x27;Kelly&#x27;s position in cabinet became a focus for speculation, as rumours swept Leinster House (the seat of Parliament) that de Valera intended making O&#x27;Kelly the Fianna Fáil choice to become President of Ireland, the office which had replaced the governor-generalship in the new Constitution of Ireland. Again, the justification for de Valera nominating one of his senior ministers for the presidency was rumours that someone in the cabinet was, either deliberately or accidentally, letting information slip to the Catholic Church through the Knights of Columbanus. It came as anger and surprise to de Valera to find out that O&#x27;Kelly was a member of the Catholic fraternal organisation.

De Valera had on a number of occasions ordered O&#x27;Kelly to resign from the Knights, only to find that he would rejoin later. However, the apparent entry of the popular Lord Mayor of Dublin, Alfie Byrne, into the presidential race (in fact he eventually failed to get nominated) and the belief that neither O&#x27;Kelly nor any other politician could beat Byrne (ironically a close friend of O&#x27;Kelly) led to all party agreement, on the opposition Fine Gael&#x27;s suggestion, that the office go to Douglas Hyde, a Protestant, as an appreciation for his contribution to Irish society. An Irish language enthusiast, Hyde had founded the Conradh na Gaeilge, known in English as the Gaelic League, a cultural organisation promoting the preservation of the Irish language, music, dancing and traditions.

==Minister for Finance==
O&#x27;Kelly was appointed Minister for Finance in 1941. He secured the passing of &quot;The Central Bank Act&quot; in 1942. On 17 July 1942, at the fifth and final stage of the Dáil debate on the &quot;Central Banking Bill&quot;, he argued that the owner of the credit issued by the Central Bank of Ireland, &quot;will be under the control of the Oireachtas and will be governed by the authority given by the people to the Houses of the Oireachtas.&quot; This debate was carried out when only five Deputies were present in the Dáil.

==President of Ireland==


O&#x27;Kelly was the Fianna Fáil candidate for President of Ireland in 1945. He defeated two other candidates. However, he came up just short of a majority on the first count.

O&#x27;Kelly&#x27;s most famous faux pas occurred during a state visit to the Vatican City, when in a breach with the standard protocol, he told the media of Pope Pius XII&#x27;s personal opinions on communism. The resulting row strained the relationships between Pope Pius XII and Joseph Stalin.

During his term, he signed the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, which established the Republic of Ireland on 18 April 1949 as an independent republic outside the British Commonwealth. As a result, O&#x27;Kelly became the first President of Ireland to be internationally recognised as a full head of state. Prior to 18 April 1949, King George VI was Ireland&#x27;s head of state as the last King of Ireland.

O&#x27;Kelly was reelected on 25 June 1952, this time unopposed. During his second term, he visited many nations in Europe and addressed the United States Congress in 1959. He retired at the end of his second term in 1959, to be replaced by his old mentor and former Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera.

O&#x27;Kelly did not refer any Bills to the Supreme Court, under Article 26 of the Constitution of Ireland while he was in office. He convened a meeting of the Council of State in 1947, to consider whether Part III of the Health Bill, 1947 – which provided the basis for the Mother and Child Scheme – should be referred, but he decided against doing so.

He dissolved the Dáil on four occasions (in 1948, 1951, 1954 and 1957). On each occasion, the Taoiseach who advised him to do so (de Valera in the first and third cases, and John A. Costello in the other two) had not been formally defeated in a Dáil vote in a manner showing a loss of support by a majority of TDs. Therefore, under Article 13.2.3° of the Constitution, O&#x27;Kelly had no discretion to refuse to act on their advice to dissolve. A more complex case occurred however in 1949, when the First Inter-Party Government was defeated in a snap Dáil vote on a financial measure due to the absence of a number of Government TDs. O&#x27;Kelly was advised by the Secretary to the President, Michael McDunphy, that had Costello requested a dissolution, he could have refused it–thus forcing Costello to resign. However, Costello considered that the vote failed by accident (due to a mistake by the party whips), and opted to reintroduce the measure the following morning, rather than seek a dissolution. With all TDs present this time, the vote carried. McDunphy later changed his mind and in the files on the event concluded that O&#x27;Kelly could not have refused a dissolution because the loss had merely been a technical loss, not an actual decision by the Dáil to vote against the government.

===Visit to the United States===

O&#x27;Kelly was the first President of Ireland to visit the United States of America, when from 16 to 31 March 1959, he was the guest of President Dwight Eisenhower. He was invited to address both houses of Congress. This was important to Ireland as it showed that the republic and its head of state were recognised by the United States. Historian J. J. Lee has stated that the visit signified an end to a period of distrust between Ireland and the United States, following World War II. Both Ireland and America had been neutral countries when the war began, but the US joined the conflict in 1941. But Ireland continued to remain neutral, which annoyed American politicians during the war, and afterwards. The invitation to President O&#x27;Kelly to address Congress meant that Ireland had been forgiven by the larger power.

==O&#x27;Kelly and Catholicism==
O&#x27;Kelly was known to be a devout Catholic. He made a point of ensuring that his first state visit, following the declaration of the Republic of Ireland in 1949, was to the Vatican City to meet Pope Pius XII. This visit created controversy when the famously talkative O&#x27;Kelly inadvertently revealed the Pope&#x27;s private views on communism.

O&#x27;Kelly was a member of the Knights of Saint Columbanus.

==&quot;A model President&quot;==
Éamon de Valera worried about O&#x27;Kelly&#x27;s drinking habits, which were much commented on during his career. O&#x27;Kelly drank a lot, and often, yet his behaviour remained dignified and above reproach and he never caused any scandal. The author, Monsignor Pádraig Ó Fiannachta, reported that President O&#x27;Kelly kept barrels of draught Guinness stout on tap in Áras an Uachtaráin.

O&#x27;Kelly was a short man with a tall second wife. When attending a football match once in Croke Park, he was on the field to throw in the ball. A member of the crowd shouted, &quot;Cut the grass, we can&#x27;t see the President!&quot;

On his retirement as President of Ireland in 1959, he was described as a &quot;model President&quot; by the normally hostile Irish Times newspaper. Though controversial, the diminutive O&#x27;Kelly was widely seen as genuine and honest, albeit tactless.

He died on 23 November 1966, at the age of 84, fifty years after the Easter Rising that first brought him to prominence. He is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin.

==Marriages==
In 1918, O&#x27;Kelly married Mary Kate, known as Kit, the daughter of John Ryan, a farmer of Tomcoole, near Taghmon, County Wexford. Kit was an assistant professor of modern languages at the National University. They remained married until her death in 1934, aged 55. They had no children. In 1936, O&#x27;Kelly married his late wife&#x27;s younger sister, Phyllis Ryan, after gaining a papal dispensation to do so. A chemist and public analyst, she was forty-three when they married. She lost her first child and was unable to have any more.

One of Mary Kate and Phyllis&#x27;s brothers was the Fianna Fáil Minister James Ryan, while another sister, Josephine Ryan, was married to the Fine Gael leader General Richard Mulcahy.

<doc id="160900" wikidata="Q356450" url="?curid=160900" title="Erskine Hamilton Childers">
<text>Erskine Hamilton Childers (11 December 1905 – 17 November 1974) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as the fourth president of Ireland from June 1973 to November 1974. He is the only Irish president to have died in office. He also served as Tánaiste and Minister for Health from 1969 to 1973, Minister for Transport and Power from 1959 to 1969, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs from 1951 to 1954 and 1966 to 1969, Minister for Lands from 1957 to 1959 and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health from 1944 to 1948. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1938 to 1973.

His father Robert Erskine Childers, an Irish republican and author of the espionage thriller &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot;, was executed during the Irish Civil War.

==Early life==
Childers was born in the Embankment Gardens, Westminster, London, to a Protestant family, originally from Glendalough, County Wicklow, Ireland. Although also born in England, his father, Robert Erskine Childers, had an Irish mother and had been raised by an uncle in County Wicklow, and after World War I took his family to live there. His mother, Molly Childers, was a Bostonian whose ancestors arrived on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. Robert and Molly later emerged as prominent and outspoken Irish republican opponents of the political settlement with Britain which resulted in the establishment of the Irish Free State.

Childers was educated at Gresham&#x27;s School, Holt. In 1922 when Childers was sixteen, his father was executed by the new Irish Free State on politically inspired charges of gun-possession. The pistol he had been found with had been given to him by Michael Collins. Before his execution, in a spirit of reconciliation, the elder Childers obtained a promise from his son to seek out and shake the hand of every man who had signed his death warrant.

After attending his father&#x27;s funeral, Childers returned to Gresham&#x27;s, then two years later he attended Trinity College, Cambridge where he studied history.

==Career==
After finishing his education, Childers worked for a period for a tourism board in Paris. In 1931, Éamon de Valera invited him to work for de Valera&#x27;s recently founded newspaper &quot;The Irish Press&quot; in Dublin, where Childers became advertising manager. He became a naturalised Irish citizen in 1938. That same year, he was elected as a Fianna Fáil TD for the constituency of Athlone–Longford. He remained remain a member of Dáil Éireann until 1973 when he resigned to become President of Ireland.

When former President of Ireland Douglas Hyde, who was a Protestant, died in 1949, most senior politicians did not attend the funeral service inside St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral; rather, they remained outside. The exceptions were Noël Browne, the Minister for Health, and Childers, a fellow Protestant.

Childers joined the cabinet in 1951, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in the de Valera government. He then served as Minister for Lands in de Valera&#x27;s 1957–59 cabinet. In 1959, the new Taoiseach Seán Lemass initially appointed him as Minister for Lands, before appointing him to the newly created position of Minister for Transport and Power. He served in that position until 1969, in combination with his former position of Minister for Posts and Telegraphs from 1966 under Jack Lynch. In 1969, he was appointed as Tánaiste and Minister for Health in 1969.

One commentator described his ministerial career as &quot;spectacularly unsuccessful&quot;. Others praised his willingness to make tough decisions. He was outspoken in his opposition to Charles Haughey, in the aftermath of the Arms Crisis, when Haughey and Neil Blaney, having been both removed from the government, were sent for trial amid allegations of a plot to import arms for the Provisional IRA. (Both were acquitted.)

==President of Ireland==
===Campaign===
In the 1966 presidential election, Fine Gael TD Tom O&#x27;Higgins had come within 11,000 votes (1%) of defeating de Valera; at the 1973 election he was again the Fine Gael nominee and was widely expected to win. Childers was nominated by Fianna Fáil at the behest of de Valera, who pressured Jack Lynch in the selection of the presidential candidate. On the campaign trail, his popularity proved enormous, and in a political upset, Childers was elected the fourth President of Ireland on 30 May 1973, defeating O&#x27;Higgins by 635,867 (52%) votes to 578,771 (48%).

===Presidency===
Childers was inaugurated as President of Ireland. He took the oath of office in the Irish language with some reluctance. His very distinctive Oxbridge accent made pronouncing Irish difficult, so it was written down on a large board for him phonetically to help him with this.

Childers, though 67, quickly gained a reputation as a vibrant, extremely hard-working President, and became highly popular and respected. However, he had a strained relationship with the incumbent government, led by Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave of Fine Gael. Childers had campaigned on a platform of making the presidency more open and hands-on, which Cosgrave viewed as a threat to his agenda as head of government. He refused to cooperate with Childers&#x27;s priority upon taking office, the establishment of a think tank within Áras an Uachtaráin, to plan the country&#x27;s future. Childers considered resigning from the presidency but was convinced to remain by Cosgrave&#x27;s Foreign Minister, Garret FitzGerald. However, Childers remained detached from the government; whereas previously, Presidents had been briefed by the Taoiseach once a month, Cosgrave briefed President Childers and his successor, Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh, on average once every six months.

Though frustrated about the lack of power he had in the office, Childers&#x27;s daughter Nessa believes that he played an important behind-the-scenes role in easing the Northern Ireland conflict, reporting that former Prime Minister of Northern Ireland Terence O&#x27;Neill met secretly with her father at Áras an Uachtaráin on at least one occasion.

===Death===
Prevented from transforming the presidency as he desired, Childers instead threw his energy into a busy schedule of official visits and speeches, which was physically taxing.

On 17 November 1974, during a conference with the psychiatrists of the Royal College of Physicians in Dublin, Childers suffered sudden heart failure causing him to lie sideways and turn blue before suddenly collapsing. He was pronounced dead the same day at Mater Misericordiae University Hospital.

Childers&#x27;s state funeral in St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin, was attended by his presidential predecessor Éamon de Valera and world leaders including the Earl Mountbatten of Burma (representing Queen Elizabeth II), the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and British Opposition Leader Edward Heath, and heads of state from Europe and beyond. He was buried on the grounds of the Church of Ireland Derralossary Church, in Roundwood, County Wicklow.

==Succession==
Childers&#x27;s widow, Rita Childers, shared her late husband&#x27;s widespread personal popularity. Upon his death, when she issued a press statement pleading for the nation to keep the office above politics in choosing a successor, Cosgrave reacted by suggesting to the Opposition Leader, Jack Lynch, that they appoint Mrs. Childers to the presidency by acclamation. Lynch agreed four days after Childers&#x27;s death to bring the suggestion to his party. However, when members of Cosgrave&#x27;s Fine Gael disclosed the plan to the press on their initiative, Lynch, believing his Fianna Fáil party was being denied a public voice in the decision, withdrew his support for her.

All parties instead agreed to nominate the former Attorney General and Chief Justice, Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh, as Childers&#x27;s successor, who was elected unopposed.

==Family==
Childers married Ruth Ellen Dow in 1925. They had five children, Ruth Ellen Childers, born in July 1927, Erskine, born in March 1929, followed by Roderick Winthrop Childers in June 1931, and, in November 1937, twin daughters, Carainn and Margaret Osgood Childers.

After the death of Dow in 1950, Childers married again, in 1952, to Rita Dudley, a Catholic. Together they had a daughter, Nessa, who is a former Member of the European Parliament and County Councillor.

Childers was survived by children from both his marriages. His second wife Rita Dudley died on 9 May 2010.

<doc id="160904" wikidata="Q82850" url="?curid=160904" title="List of English monarchs">
<text>This list of kings and reigning queens of the Kingdom of England begins with Alfred the Great, who initially ruled Wessex, one of the seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms which later made up modern England. Alfred styled himself king of the Anglo-Saxons from about 886, and while he was not the first king to claim to rule all of the English, his rule represents the start of the first unbroken line of kings to rule the whole of England, the House of Wessex.

Arguments are made for a few different kings thought to have controlled enough Anglo-Saxon kingdoms to be deemed the first king of England. For example, Offa of Mercia and Egbert of Wessex are sometimes described as kings of England by popular writers, but it is no longer the majority view of historians that their wide dominions are part of a process leading to a unified England. Historian Simon Keynes states, for example, that &quot;Offa was driven by a lust for power, not a vision of English unity; and what he left was a reputation, not a legacy.&quot; This refers to a period in the late 8th century when Offa achieved a dominance over many of the kingdoms of southern England, but this did not survive his death in 796. Likewise, in 829 Egbert of Wessex conquered Mercia, but he soon lost control of it.

It was not until the late 9th century that one kingdom, Wessex, had become the dominant Anglo-Saxon kingdom. Its king, Alfred the Great, was overlord of western Mercia and used the title &quot;King of the Angles and Saxons&quot;, but he never ruled eastern and northern England, which was then known as the Danelaw, having earlier been conquered by the Danes from southern Scandinavia. His son Edward the Elder conquered the eastern Danelaw, but Edward&#x27;s son Æthelstan became the first king to rule the whole of England when he conquered Northumbria in 927, and he is regarded by some modern historians as the first true king of England. The title &quot;King of the English&quot; or in Latin, was first used to describe Æthelstan in one of his charters in 928. The standard title for monarchs from Æthelstan until John was &quot;King of the English&quot;. In 1016 Cnut the Great, a Dane, was the first to call himself &quot;King of England&quot;. In the Norman period &quot;King of the English&quot; remained standard, with occasional use of &quot;King of England&quot; or . From John&#x27;s reign onwards all other titles were eschewed in favour of &quot;King&quot; or &quot;Queen of England&quot;.

The Principality of Wales was incorporated into the Kingdom of England under the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284, and in 1301 King Edward I invested his eldest son, the future King Edward II, as Prince of Wales. Since that time, the eldest sons of all English monarchs, except for King Edward III, have borne this title.

After the death of Queen Elizabeth I in 1603, her cousin King James VI of Scotland inherited the English crown as James I of England, joining the crowns of England and Scotland in personal union. By royal proclamation, James styled himself &quot;King of Great Britain&quot;, but no such kingdom was created until 1707, when England and Scotland united during the reign of Queen Anne to form the new Kingdom of Great Britain, with a single British parliament sitting at Westminster. This marked the end of the Kingdom of England as a sovereign state.

===Disputed claimant===
There is some evidence that Ælfweard of Wessex may have been king in 924, between his father Edward the Elder and his half-brother Æthelstan, although he was not crowned. A 12th-century list of kings gives him a reign length of four weeks, though one manuscript of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; says he died only 16 days after his father. However, the fact that he ruled is not accepted by all historians. Also, it is unclear whether—if Ælfweard was declared king—it was over the whole kingdom or of Wessex only. One interpretation of the ambiguous evidence is that when Edward died, Ælfweard was declared king in Wessex and Æthelstan in Mercia.

After King Harold was killed at the Battle of Hastings, the Witan elected Edgar Ætheling as king, but by then the Normans controlled the country and Edgar never ruled. He submitted to King William the Conqueror.

==House of Normandy (1066–1135)==

In 1066, several rival claimants to the English throne emerged. Among them were Harold Godwinson (recognised as king by the Witenagemot after the death of Edward the Confessor), Harald Hardrada (King of Norway who claimed to be the rightful heir of Harthacnut) and Duke William II of Normandy (vassal to the King of France, and first cousin once-removed of Edward the Confessor). Harald and William both invaded separately in 1066. Godwinson successfully repelled the invasion by Hardrada, but ultimately lost the throne of England in the Norman conquest of England.

After the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066, William the Conqueror made permanent the recent removal of the capital from Winchester to London. Following the death of Harold Godwinson at Hastings, the Anglo-Saxon Witenagemot elected as king Edgar Ætheling, the son of Edward the Exile and grandson of Edmund Ironside. The young monarch was unable to resist the invaders and was never crowned. William was crowned King William I of England on Christmas Day 1066, in Westminster Abbey, and is today known as William the Conqueror, William the Bastard or William I.

==House of Blois (1135–1154)==
Henry I left no legitimate male heirs, his son William Adelin having died in the &quot;White Ship&quot; disaster of 1120. This ended the direct Norman line of kings in England. Henry named his eldest daughter, Matilda (Countess of Anjou by her second marriage to Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, as well as widow of her first husband, Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor), as his heir. Before naming Matilda as heir, he had been in negotiations to name his nephew Stephen of Blois as his heir. When Henry died, Stephen travelled to England, and in a coup d&#x27;etat had himself crowned instead of Matilda. The period which followed is known as The Anarchy, as parties supporting each side fought in open warfare both in Britain and on the continent for the better part of two decades.

===Disputed claimants===

Matilda was declared heir presumptive by her father, Henry I, after the death of her brother on the &quot;White Ship&quot;, and acknowledged as such by the barons. Upon Henry I&#x27;s death, the throne was seized by Matilda&#x27;s cousin, Stephen of Blois. During the ensuing Anarchy, Matilda controlled England for a few months in 1141. She was the first woman to do so, but was never crowned and is rarely listed as a monarch of England.

Count Eustace IV of Boulogne (c. 1130 – 17 August 1153) was appointed co-king of England by his father, King Stephen, on 6 April 1152, in order to guarantee his succession to the throne (as was the custom in France, but not in England). The Pope and the Church would not agree to this, and Eustace was not crowned. Eustace died the next year aged 23, during his father&#x27;s lifetime, and so never became king in his own right.

== House of Plantagenet (1154–1485) ==
The House of Plantagenet takes its name from Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, husband of Empress Matilda and father of Henry II. The name Plantagenet itself was unknown as a family name &quot;per se&quot; until Richard of York adopted it as his family name in the 15th century. It has since been retroactively applied to English monarchs from Henry II onward. It is common among modern historians to refer to Henry II and his sons as the &quot;Angevins&quot; due to their vast continental empire, and most of the Angevin kings before John spent more time in their continental possessions than in England.

=== Angevin kings of England ===

King Stephen came to an agreement with Matilda in November 1153 with the signing of the Treaty of Wallingford, in which Stephen recognised Henry, son of Matilda and her second husband Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, as the designated heir. The royal house descended from Matilda and Geoffrey is widely known by two names, the House of Anjou (after Geoffrey&#x27;s title as Count of Anjou) or the House of Plantagenet, after his sobriquet. Some historians prefer to group the subsequent kings into two groups, before and after the loss of the bulk of their French possessions, although they are not different royal houses.

The Angevins (from the French term meaning &quot;from Anjou&quot;) ruled over the Angevin Empire during the 12th and 13th centuries, an area stretching from the Pyrenees to Ireland. They did not regard England as their primary home until most of their continental domains were lost by King John. The direct, eldest male line from Henry II includes monarchs commonly grouped together as the House of Plantagenet, which was the name given to the dynasty after the loss of most of their continental possessions, while cadet branches of this line became known as the House of Lancaster and the House of York during the War of the Roses.

The Angevins formulated England&#x27;s royal coat of arms, which usually showed other kingdoms held or claimed by them or their successors, although without representation of Ireland for quite some time. &quot;Dieu et mon droit&quot; was first used as a battle cry by Richard I in 1198 at the Battle of Gisors, when he defeated the forces of Philip II of France. It has generally been used as the motto of English monarchs since being adopted by Edward III.

====Disputed claimant (House of Capet)====

The future Louis VIII of France briefly won two-thirds of England over to his side from May 1216 to September 1217 at the conclusion of the First Barons&#x27; War against King John. The then-Prince Louis landed on the Isle of Thanet, off the north Kent coast, on 21 May 1216, and marched more or less unopposed to London, where the streets were lined with cheering crowds. At a grand ceremony in St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, on 2 June 1216, in the presence of numerous English clergy and nobles, the Mayor of London and Alexander II of Scotland, Prince Louis was proclaimed King Louis of England (though not crowned). In less than a month, &quot;King Louis&quot; controlled more than half of the country and enjoyed the support of two-thirds of the barons. However, he suffered military defeat at the hands of the English fleet. By signing the Treaty of Lambeth in September 1217, Louis gained 10,000 marks and agreed he had never been the legitimate king of England. &quot;King Louis&quot; remains one of the least known kings to have ruled over a substantial part of England.

The House of York claimed the right to the throne through Edward III&#x27;s second surviving son, Lionel of Antwerp, but it inherited its name from Edward&#x27;s fourth surviving son, Edmund of Langley, first Duke of York.

The Wars of the Roses (1455–1485) saw the throne pass back and forth between the rival houses of Lancaster and York.

==House of Tudor (1485–1603)==

The Tudors descended in the female line from John Beaufort, one of the illegitimate children of John of Gaunt (third surviving son of Edward III), by Gaunt&#x27;s long-term mistress Katherine Swynford. Those descended from English monarchs only through an illegitimate child would normally have no claim on the throne, but the situation was complicated when Gaunt and Swynford eventually married in 1396 (25 years after John Beaufort&#x27;s birth). In view of the marriage, the church retroactively declared the Beauforts legitimate via a papal bull the same year. Parliament did the same in an Act in 1397. A subsequent proclamation by John of Gaunt&#x27;s legitimate son, King Henry IV, also recognised the Beauforts&#x27; legitimacy, but declared them ineligible ever to inherit the throne. Nevertheless, the Beauforts remained closely allied with Gaunt&#x27;s other descendants, the Royal House of Lancaster.

John Beaufort&#x27;s granddaughter Lady Margaret Beaufort was married to Edmund Tudor. Tudor was the son of Welsh courtier Owain Tudur (anglicised to Owen Tudor) and Catherine of Valois, the widow of the Lancastrian King Henry V. Edmund Tudor and his siblings were either illegitimate, or the product of a secret marriage, and owed their fortunes to the goodwill of their legitimate half-brother King Henry VI. When the House of Lancaster fell from power, the Tudors followed.

By the late 15th century, the Tudors were the last hope for the Lancaster supporters. Edmund Tudor&#x27;s son became king as Henry VII after defeating Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, winning the Wars of the Roses. King Henry VII married Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV, thereby uniting the Lancastrian and York lineages. (See family tree.)

Edward VI named Lady Jane Grey as his heir in his will, overruling the order of succession laid down by Parliament in the Third Succession Act. Four days after his death on 6 July 1553, Jane was proclaimed queen—the first of three Tudor women to be proclaimed queen regnant. Nine days after the proclamation, on 19 July, the Privy Council switched allegiance and proclaimed Edward VI&#x27;s Catholic half-sister Mary queen. Jane was later executed for treason.

Under the terms of the marriage treaty between Philip I of Naples (later Philip II of Spain from 15 January 1556) and Queen Mary I, Philip was to enjoy Mary&#x27;s titles and honours for as long as their marriage should last. All official documents, including Acts of Parliament, were to be dated with both their names, and Parliament was to be called under the joint authority of the couple. An Act of Parliament gave him the title of king and stated that he &quot;shall aid her Highness ... in the happy administration of her Grace&#x27;s realms and dominions&quot; (although elsewhere the Act stated that Mary was to be &quot;sole queen&quot;). Nonetheless, Philip was to co-reign with his wife.

==House of Stuart (1603–1649)==

Elizabeth&#x27;s cousin, King James VI of Scotland, succeeded to the English throne as James I in the Union of the Crowns. James was descended from the Tudors through his great-grandmother, Margaret Tudor, the eldest daughter of Henry VII and wife of James IV of Scotland. In 1604, he adopted the title &quot;King of Great Britain&quot;. However, the two parliaments remained separate until the Acts of Union 1707.

==First Interregnum (1649–1660)==

No monarch reigned after the 1649 execution of Charles I. Between 1649 and 1653, there was no single English head of state, as England was ruled directly by the Rump Parliament with the English Council of State acting as executive power during a period known as the Commonwealth of England.

After a coup d&#x27;etat in 1653, Oliver Cromwell forcibly took control of England from Parliament. He dissolved the Rump Parliament at the head of a military force and England entered The Protectorate period, under Cromwell&#x27;s direct control with the title Lord Protector.

It was within the power of the Lord Protector to choose his heir and Oliver Cromwell chose his eldest son, Richard Cromwell, to succeed him.

=== Second Interregnum 1688–1689 ===

James II was ousted by Parliament less than four years after ascending to the throne, beginning the century&#x27;s second interregnum. To settle the question of who should replace the deposed monarch, a Convention Parliament elected James&#x27; daughter Mary II and her husband (also his nephew) William III co-regents, in the Glorious Revolution.

While James and his descendants continued to claim the throne, all Catholics (such as James II&#x27;s son and grandson, James Francis Edward and Charles respectively) were barred from the throne by the Act of Settlement 1701, enacted by Anne, another of James&#x27;s Protestant daughters.

With the Acts of Union 1707, England as a sovereign state ceased to exist, replaced by the new Kingdom of Great Britain; see List of British monarchs.

==Acts of Union==
The Acts of Union 1707 were a pair of Parliamentary Acts passed during 1706 and 1707 by the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland to put into effect the Treaty of Union agreed on 22 July 1706. The acts joined the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland (previously separate sovereign states, with separate legislatures but with the same monarch) into the Kingdom of Great Britain.

England, Scotland, and Ireland had shared a monarch for more than a hundred years, since the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when King James VI of Scotland inherited the English and Irish thrones from his first cousin twice removed, Queen Elizabeth I.

==Timeline==


== Titles ==
The standard title for all monarchs from Æthelstan until the time of King John was (&quot;King of the English&quot;). In addition, many of the pre-Norman kings assumed extra titles, as follows:
* Æthelstan: (&quot;King of All Britain&quot;)
* Edmund the Magnificent: (&quot;King of Britain&quot;) and (&quot;King of the English and of other peoples governor and director&quot;)
* Eadred: (&quot;Reigning over the governments of the kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxons, Northumbrians, Pagans, and British&quot;)
* Eadwig the Fair: (&quot;King by the will of God, Emperor of the Anglo-Saxons and Northumbrians, governor of the pagans, commander of the British&quot;)
* Edgar the Peaceful: (&quot;King of all Albion and its neighbouring realms&quot;)
* Cnut the Great: (&quot;King of the English and of all the British sphere governor and ruler&quot;) and (&quot;Monarch of all the English of Britain&quot;)

In the Norman period remained standard, with occasional use of (&quot;King of England&quot;). The Empress Matilda styled herself (&quot;Lady of the English&quot;).

From the time of King John onwards all other titles were eschewed in favour of or .

In 1604 James I, who had inherited the English throne the previous year, adopted the title (now usually rendered in English rather than Latin) &quot;King of Great Britain&quot;. The English and Scottish parliaments, however, did not recognise this title until the Acts of Union of 1707 under Queen Anne (who was &quot;Queen of Great Britain&quot; rather than king).

<text>Foucault&#x27;s Pendulum (original title: &quot;Il pendolo di Foucault&quot; ) is a novel by Italian writer and philosopher Umberto Eco. It was first published in 1988, with an English translation by William Weaver being published a year later.

The book is divided into segments represented by the ten Sefiroth. It is satirical, being full of esoteric references to Kabbalah, alchemy, and conspiracy theories, to the point that critic and novelist Anthony Burgess suggested that it needed an index. The pendulum of the title refers to an actual pendulum designed by French physicist Léon Foucault to demonstrate Earth&#x27;s rotation, which has symbolic significance within the novel. Some believe that it refers to Michel Foucault, given the author&#x27;s friendship with him, but Eco &quot;specifically rejects any intentional reference to Michel Foucault&quot;—this being regarded as another subtle literary joke.

== Plot summary ==

The book opens with a man named Casaubon hiding in the Musée des Arts et Métiers after closing. He believes that a secret society has kidnapped his friend Jacopo Belbo and is now after him, and that they will soon convene in the museum. As he waits, Casaubon reflects on his life, but it is implied that he is an unreliable narrator whose mind has been warped by conspiracy theories.

In the 1970s in Milan, Casaubon, who as a student had participated in the 1968 Italian uprisings, is studying the Knights Templar when he meets Belbo and his colleague Diotallevi. The former works as an editor in a publishing house and invites Casaubon to review a manuscript about the Templars. The manuscript, by Colonel Ardenti, claims he discovered a secret plan of the Templars to take over the world. Ardenti mysteriously vanishes after meeting with Belbo and Casaubon; Casaubon then moves to Brazil to pursue a relationship with a woman named Amparo and meets Agliè, an elderly man who implies he is the mystical Comte de Saint-Germain. Casaubon&#x27;s relationship with Amparo falls apart after attending an Umbanda rite, and he returns to Milan, where he is hired by Belbo&#x27;s employer, Mr. Garamond, as a researcher. Casaubon learns that in addition to a respected publishing house, Garamond also owns Manutius, a vanity publisher that charges incompetent authors large sums to print their work. Garamond has the idea to begin two lines of occult books, one for serious publishing and the other to be published by Manutius to attract more vanity authors. Agliè, now also in Milan, becomes a consultant to Garamond. Belbo grows jealous of Agliè&#x27;s ability to charm Belbo&#x27;s former mistress Lorenza.

Belbo, Diotallevi, and Casaubon become submerged in occult manuscripts that draw flimsy connections between historical events, and soon have the idea to develop their own as a game. Using Belbo&#x27;s personal computer &quot;Abulafia&quot; and Ardenti&#x27;s manuscript as a foundation, the three create what they call &quot;The Plan&quot; using a program that rearranges text at random. The Plan eventually becomes an intricate web of conspiracy theories about the Templars and their goal to reshape the world using &quot;telluric currents&quot;, which are focused at the Foucault pendulum. In addition to numerous other historical organizations apparently involved in The Plan, the three invent a fictional secret society, the Tres (&quot;Templi Resurgentes Equites Synarchici&quot;, Latin for &quot;the Risen again Synarchic Knights of the Temple&quot;).

As time passes, the three become increasingly obsessed with The Plan and wonder if it could be true. Diotallevi is diagnosed with cancer and attributes it to divine retribution for his role in The Plan. Belbo, overcome by jealousy over Lorenza, discusses The Plan with Agliè and claims to be in possession of a Templar map of the telluric currents; Agliè demands to see it and is refused. Agliè, Garamond, Ardenti, and many of the manuscript authors convince themselves they are the Tres, and that Agliè is their leader; the latter then forces Belbo to accompany him to Paris. Casaubon visits Belbo&#x27;s apartment and reads his personal files, then goes to Paris and Foucault&#x27;s Pendulum to see Agliè and his associates.

In the present, a group led by Agliè gathers around the pendulum for an arcane ritual. Casaubon sees several ectoplasmic forms appear, one of which claims to be the real Comte de Saint-Germain and denounces Agliè in front of his followers. Belbo is questioned but refuses to reveal what he knows, inciting a riot during which he is hanged from Foucault&#x27;s Pendulum. Casaubon escapes the museum and flees to the countryside villa where Belbo grew up, soon learning that Diotallevi succumbed to his cancer at midnight on St. John&#x27;s Eve, coincidentally the same time Belbo died.

Casaubon meditates on events and resigns to being captured by the Tres, where he plans to follow Belbo&#x27;s lead and tell them nothing. While waiting in the villa, Casaubon finds an old manuscript by Belbo that relates a mystical experience he had when he was twelve, in which he perceived ultimate meaning beyond signs and semiotics. He realizes that much of Belbo&#x27;s behavior, and possibly his creation of the Plan and even his death, was inspired by Belbo&#x27;s desire to recapture that lost meaning.

== Major themes ==
Most books written in this fiction genre seem to focus on the mysterious, and aim to provide their own version of the conspiracy theory. Eco avoids this pitfall without holding back on the historical mystery surrounding the Knights Templar. In fact, the novel may be viewed as a critique, spoof, or deconstruction of the grand overarching conspiracies often found in postmodern literature, and indeed its very title may well allude to one of postmodernism&#x27;s key exponents, Michel Foucault. Although the main plot does detail a conspiratorial &quot;Plan&quot;, the book focuses on the development of the characters, and their slow transition from skeptical editors, mocking the Manutius manuscripts to credulous Diabolicals themselves. In this way, the conspiracy theory provided is a plot device, rather than an earnest proposition.

Belbo&#x27;s writings are a recurrent theme throughout the book. The entire book is narrated in the first person by Casaubon, with brief interludes from the files on Abulafia. These passages are often eccentrically written, and deal in most part with Belbo&#x27;s childhood, his constant sense of failure, and his obsession with Lorenza. The interludes from his childhood serve as a stark contrast to the mythical world of cults and conspiracies. Belbo is extremely careful to not try to create (literature), because he deems himself unworthy, although it becomes somewhat obvious that writing is his passion. This attitude of constant subconscious self-abasement fits in with the overall irony focused on in the book, considering that Belbo is eventually consumed by (re)creation of the Plan; one excerpt meant for the unattainable Lorenza reads, &quot;I could not possess you, but I can blow up history.&quot;

Casaubon is a scholar: While Belbo seeks inner peace, Casaubon&#x27;s quest is of knowledge. The uncertainty of scientific knowledge and human experience is explored in his character, as he participates in various extra-natural events. His narratives abandon his strict realism and become increasingly inclined towards the supernatural as the novel progresses, despite periodic reality checks from his partner Lia.

Mr. Garamond, whose primary business is selling dreams (through his vanity press outlet), comes to believe the fantasy world his authors weave. It is possible, though, that he had always been a &quot;Diabolical&quot;, and founded his publishing business to fish for information.

Eco shows that if one stops discriminating between whether propositions are right or wrong, it is possible to link any fact or idea with any other, but that this creates a dangerous tendency towards conspiracy theories. As Diotallevi approaches death, he remarks: &quot;I&#x27;m dying because I convinced myself that there was no order, that you could do whatever you liked with any text&quot;.

As Belbo approaches death, Casaubon remarks of him that: &quot;... he refused to bow to nonmeaning. He somehow knew that fragile as our existence may be, however ineffectual our interrogation of the world, there is nevertheless something that has more meaning than the rest&quot;.

As Casaubon awaits death at the hands of those who incorrectly believe that he is withholding some occult information from them, he reflects that: &quot;It makes no difference whether I write or not. They will look for other meanings, even in my silence&quot;.

Eco reinforces this theme by quoting Karl Popper at the heading of chapter 118:
=== Societies in the novel ===

A wide variety of organizations are listed in &quot;Foucault&#x27;s Pendulum&quot;, including the Assassins of Alamut, the Bavarian Illuminati, the Bogomils, the Candomblé, the Cathars, the fictional Cthulhu cult, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (which in the novel Mr. Garamond includes in his list of &quot;occult&quot; organizations to contact about book ideas), the Elders of Zion, the Freemasons, the Gnostics, Gurdjieffians, the Jesuits, the Knights Templar, Opus Dei, Ordo Templi Orientis, Panta Rei, and the Rosicrucians.

== Comparison with other writings ==
&quot;Foucault&#x27;s Pendulum&quot; (1988) has been called &quot;the thinking man&#x27;s &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot;&quot;. The parchment that sparks the Plan plays a role which is similar to the parchments in the Rennes-le-Château story in Brown&#x27;s novel and in &quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail&quot; (1982), from which Brown drew inspiration. Eco&#x27;s novel predated the &quot;Da Vinci&quot; phenomenon by more than a decade, but both novels are concerned with the Knights Templar, complex conspiracies, secret codes, and even a chase around the monuments of Paris. Eco does so, however, from a much more critical perspective; &quot;Foucault&quot; is more a satire on the futility of conspiracy theories and those who believe them, rather than an attempt to proliferate such beliefs.

Eco was asked whether he had read the Brown novel; he replied:
Eco was indebted to Danilo Kiš&#x27;s story &quot;The Book of Kings and Fools&quot; in &quot;The Encyclopedia of the Dead&quot; (1983) for the portrayal of Sergei Nilus. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; claimed that &quot;one can trace a lineage from Robert Anton Wilson&#x27;s &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot; to Umberto Eco&#x27;s &quot;Foucault&#x27;s Pendulum&quot;&quot;. &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot; was written 13 years before &quot;Foucault&#x27;s Pendulum&quot;. George Johnson wrote on the similarity of the two books that &quot;both works were written tongue in cheek, with a high sense of irony.&quot; Both books are divided into ten segments represented by the ten Sefiroth.

&quot;Foucault&#x27;s Pendulum&quot; also bears a number of similarities to Eco&#x27;s own experiences and writing. The character of Belbo was brought up in the region of Piedmont in Northern Italy. Eco refers to his own visit to a Candomblé ceremony in Brazil in an article compiled in &quot;Faith in Fakes&quot;, reminiscent of the episode in the novel. He also describes French ethnologist Roger Bastide who bears a resemblance to the character of Agliè. Eco&#x27;s novel was also a direct inspiration on Charles Cecil during the development of Revolution Software&#x27;s highly successful point and click adventure game &quot;Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars&quot;, in which an American tourist and a French journalist must thwart a conspiracy by a shadowy cabal who model themselves on the Knights Templar.

<text>James McNeill (27 March 1869 – 12 December 1938) was an Irish colonial administrator, politician, and diplomat, who served as the first High Commissioner to London and second Governor-General of the Irish Free State.

==Early life==
One of five children born to Archibald McNeill, a Roman Catholic working-class &quot;baker, sailor and merchant&quot;, and his wife, Rosetta (née McAuley) McNeill, James was the brother of nationalist leader Eoin MacNeill. James McNeill served as a high-ranking member of the Indian Civil Service in Calcutta.

==Public life==
Although unconnected with the Easter Rising in 1916, McNeill was arrested and jailed by the British Dublin Castle administration. On release, he was elected to Dublin County Council, becoming its chairman. He served as a member of the committee under Michael Collins, the chairman of the Provisional Government, that drafted the Constitution of the Irish Free State. He was subsequently appointed as High Commissioner from the Irish Free State to the United Kingdom.

===Governor-General===
When the first Governor-General of the Irish Free State, Tim Healy, retired in December 1927, James McNeill was proposed as his replacement by the Irish government of W. T. Cosgrave and duly appointed by King George V as Governor-General of the Irish Free State.

In office, McNeill clashed with the King&#x27;s Private Secretary when he insisted on following the constitutional advice of his Irish ministers, rather than that of Buckingham Palace, in procedures relating to the receipt of Letters of Credence accrediting ambassadors to the King in Ireland. He also refused to attend ceremonies in Trinity College, Dublin, when some elements in the college tried to ensure that the old British national anthem &quot;God Save the King&quot; was played, rather than the new Irish anthem, &quot;Amhrán na bhFiann&quot;.

When Éamon de Valera was nominated as President of the Executive Council in 1932, McNeill opted to travel to Leinster House, the parliament buildings, to appoint de Valera, rather than to require that he go to the Viceregal Lodge, the Governor-General&#x27;s residence and the former seat of British Lords Lieutenant, to avoid embarrassing de Valera, who was a republican.

However, McNeill&#x27;s tact was not reciprocated by de Valera&#x27;s government, and some of its ministers sought to humiliate McNeill as the King&#x27;s representative by withdrawing the Irish Army&#x27;s band from playing at functions he attended and demanding he withdraw invitations to visitors to meet him. In one notorious incident in April, two ministers, Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly (a future President of Ireland) and Frank Aiken, publicly walked out of a diplomatic function when McNeill, there as the guest of the French ambassador, arrived. In a fury, McNeill wrote to de Valera demanding an apology for this treatment. When none was forthcoming, apart from an ambiguous message from de Valera that could be interpreted as partially blaming McNeill for attending functions at which ministers would be present, he published his correspondence with de Valera, even though de Valera had formally advised him not to do so. De Valera then demanded that George V dismiss McNeill.

The King engineered a compromise, whereby de Valera withdrew his dismissal request and McNeill, who was due to retire at the end of 1932, would push forward his retirement date by a month or so. McNeill, at the King&#x27;s request, resigned on 1 November 1932.

In June 1932, John Charles McQuaid, President of Blackrock College, hosted an extravagant garden party to welcome Papal Legate Cardinal Lorenzo Lauri, who had arrived in Ireland to represent Pope Pius XI at the 31st International Eucharistic Congress. While De Valera maintained a very high profile at the event, McQuaid (at de Valera&#x27;s request) went to great lengths to avoid McNeill to the extent possible.

==Death==

James McNeill died in 1938 at the age of 69 in London. His widow Josephine was appointed Minister to the Hague by Seán MacBride, Minister for External Affairs in the coalition government of 1948. He is buried in Kilbarrack Cemetery.
