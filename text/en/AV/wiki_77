<text>Tiny Toon Adventures is an American animated television series created by Tom Ruegger and produced by Warner Bros. Animation. It originally aired from September 14, 1990 to December 6, 1992, airing in syndication before eventually settling at Fox&#x27;s Fox Kids block. It was the first animated series by Warner Bros. Animation to be produced in association with Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Amblin Entertainment. The show follows the adventures of a group of young cartoon characters who attend Acme Looniversity to become the next generation of characters from the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series.

The pilot episode, &quot;The Looney Beginning&quot;, aired as a prime-time special on CBS on September 14, 1990, while the series itself was featured in first-run syndication for the first two seasons. The final season aired on Fox under the Fox Kids programming block. The series ended production in 1992 in favor of &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, which premiered a year later; however, two specials were produced in 1994.

&quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; won seven Daytime Emmy Awards, a Young Artist Award, and an Environmental Media Award, with nominations for one other Daytime Emmy Award, two Annie Awards, one Primetime Emmy Award, and one other Young Artist Award. Spin-off media include magazines, toys, video games, and home media releases. &quot;The Plucky Duck Show&quot;, a spin-off television series, was created for Fox Kids and ran for one season. A second spin-off series, &quot;Pinky, Elmyra &amp; the Brain&quot; ran on Kids&#x27; WB for one season. A reboot/revival series, &quot;Tiny Toons Looniversity&quot;, was released on September 8, 2023, on Max and then premiered the next day, on September 9, on Cartoon Network.

==Premise==
===Setting===
&quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; is a cartoon set in the fictional town of &quot;Acme Acres&quot;, where most of the &quot;Tiny Toons&quot; and &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters live. The characters attend &quot;Acme Looniversity&quot;, a school whose faculty primarily consists of the mainstays of the classic Warner Bros. cartoons, such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Sylvester the Cat, Wile E. Coyote and Elmer Fudd. In the series, the university is founded to teach cartoon characters how to become funny. The school is not featured in every episode, as not all of its storylines revolve around the school.

Like &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, the series makes use of cartoon violence (e.g. anvils falling on someone, liberal use of explosives) and slapstick. The series parodies and references the current events of the early 1990s and Hollywood culture. Occasionally, episodes delve into veiled ethical and morality stories of ecology, self-esteem, and crime.

===Characters===

The series centers on a group of young cartoon characters who attend a school called Acme Looniversity to be the next generation of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters. Most of the Tiny Toons were designed to resemble younger versions of Warner&#x27;s &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters by exhibiting similar traits and looks. The main characters are Buster and Babs Bunny, two young rabbits with &quot;no relation&quot;, their friends, Plucky Duck and Hamton J. Pig, and antagonists Elmyra Duff and Montana Max. They are accompanied by a wide variety of supporting and recurring characters, such as Dizzy Devil, Furrball, Gogo Dodo, Calamity Coyote, Little Beeper, Sweetie Bird, Fifi La Fume, Shirley the Loon, Li&#x27;l Sneezer, Byron Basset, Concord Condor, Fowlmouth, Arnold the Pit Bull, Mary Melody, and Bookworm, among others.

Feeding off the characters are the more traditional Looney Tunes including (but not limited to) Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Porky Pig. Most of the adults teach classes at Acme Looniversity and serve as mentors to the Tiny Toons while others fill secondary positions as needed.

==Production==
===Development===
According to writer Paul Dini, &quot;Tiny Toons&quot; (originally title &quot;Tiny Tunes&quot;) originated as an idea by Terry Semel, the then-president of Warner Bros., who wanted to &quot;inject new life into the Warner Bros. Animation department&quot;, and at the same time create a series with junior versions of Looney Tunes characters. Semel proposed that the new series would be a show based on &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; where the characters were either young versions of the original &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; characters or new characters as the offspring of the original characters. The idea of a series with the basis of younger and junior versions of cartoon characters was common at the time; the era in which &quot;Tiny Toons&quot; was produced for had such cartoons as &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;, &quot;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo&quot; (which Ruegger worked on), &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry Kids&quot; and &quot;The Flintstone Kids&quot;.

On January 20, 1987, the Warner Bros. Animation studio approached Steven Spielberg to collaborate with Semel and Warner Bros. head of licensing Dan Romanelli on Semel&#x27;s ideas. They eventually decided that the new characters would be similar to the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters with no direct relation. As series producer/show-runner Tom Ruegger explained: &quot;Well, I think in Warner Bros. case, they had the opportunity to work with Steven Spielberg] on a project [...] But he didn&#x27;t want to just work on characters that Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, Bob McKimson and Bob Clampett made famous and created. He wanted to be involved with the creation of some &quot;new&quot; characters.&quot; The result was a series similar to &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; without the use of the same characters. However, &quot;Tiny Toons&quot; did not go into production then, nor was it even planned to be made for television; the series initially was to be a theatrical feature-length film.

On December 27, 1988, &quot;Tiny Toons&quot; was changed from a film to a television series, with Jean MacCurdy overseeing production of the first 65 episodes. MacCurdy said that &quot;Tiny Toons&quot; was changed to a television series to &quot;reach a broader audience&quot;. For the series, MacCurdy hired Tom Ruegger, who previously wrote for Filmation and Hanna-Barbera, to produce. In January 1989, Ruegger and writer Wayne Kaatz began developing the characters and the setting of &quot;Acme Acres&quot; with Spielberg.

On January 9, 1989, Warner Bros. Animation chose its voice actors from over 1,200 auditions and put together its 100-person production staff. On April 13, 1989, full production of series episodes began with five overseas animation houses and a total budget of $25 million. The first 65 episodes of the series aired in syndication on 135 stations, beginning in September 1990. During that time, &quot;Tiny Toons&quot; was a huge success and got higher ratings than its &quot;Disney Afternoon&quot; competitors in some markets. After a successful run in syndication, Fox attained the rights for season 3. Production of the series halted in late 1992 to make way for &quot;Animaniacs&quot; to air the following year.

===Writers===
The series and characters were developed by series producer, head writer and cartoonist Tom Ruegger, division leader Jean MacCurdy, associate producer and artist Alfred Gimeno and story editor/writer Wayne Kaatz. Among the series&#x27; first writers were Jim Reardon, Tom Minton and Eddie Fitzgerald. Other writers included Arleen Sorkin. The character and scenery designers included Alfred Gimeno, Ken Boyer, Dan Haskett, Karen Haskett and many other artists and directors.

&quot;Buster and Babs Go Hawaiian&quot; was co-written by three then-teenage fans.

===Casting info===
Voice director Andrea Romano auditioned over 1,200 voices and chose more than a dozen main voice actors. The role of Buster Bunny was given to Charlie Adler, who gave the role, as producer Ruegger said, &quot;a great deal of energy&quot;. The role of Babs Bunny was given to Tress MacNeille. Dini said that MacNeille was good for the role because she could do both Babs&#x27; voice and the voices of her impressions. Voice actors Joe Alaskey and Don Messick were given the roles of Plucky Duck and Hamton J. Pig, respectively. Child actor Danny Cooksey played Montana Max and, according to Dini, was good for the role because he could do a &quot;tremendous mean voice.&quot; Cree Summer provides the roles of Elmyra Duff and Mary Melody; former &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast member Gail Matthius voices Shirley the Loon, and Kath Soucie provides Fifi La Fume and Li&#x27;l Sneezer. Other voice actors include Maurice LaMarche as Dizzy Devil; Candi Milo as Sweetie, Frank Welker as Gogo Dodo, Furrball, Byron Basset, Calamity Coyote, Little Beeper, Barky Marky and other voices; and Rob Paulsen as Fowlmouth, Arnold the Pit Bull, Concord Condor and other characters. Legendary original Looney Tunes voice actor, Mel Blanc, was initially set to reprise his roles as the classic characters, but due to his death in July 1989, his characters were recast to Alaskey, Jeff Bergman, Greg Burson, and Bob Bergen.

During production of the third season, Adler left the show due to a feud with the producers. Adler was angry that he had not been offered a role in &quot;Animaniacs&quot; while his fellow &quot;Tiny Toons&quot; voice actors with smaller roles, such as Paulsen, LaMarche and Welker, were given starring roles in the new series. John Kassir replaced Adler for the remainder of the show&#x27;s run (although Adler would eventually return to voice Buster in the cancelled video game, &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures: Defenders of the Universe&quot;). Alaskey, voice of Plucky Duck, briefly left for financial reasons, but returned when an agreement was reached with the studio.

===Animation===
In order to complete 65 episodes for the first season, Warner Bros. Animation and Amblin Television contracted several North American and international animation houses, including Tokyo Movie Shinsha, Wang Film Productions, AKOM, Freelance Animators New Zealand, Encore Cartoons, StarToons and Kennedy Cartoons. Tokyo Movie Shinsha also animated the series&#x27; opening sequence. Some of the Warner Bros. staff disliked working with Kennedy Cartoons due to the animation studio&#x27;s inconsistent quality, and episodes that they animated were often subjected to multiple re-takes; in other cases, portions of Kennedy-animated episodes were reanimated by other studios. Kennedy Cartoons was dropped after the end of the series&#x27; first season.

&quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; was made with a higher production value than standard television animation. It had a cel count that was more than double that of most animated television shows then. The series had about 25,000 cels per episode instead of the standard 10,000, making it unique in that characters moved more fluidly. Animation producer Pierre DeCelles described storyboarding for the series as &quot;fun but a big challenge because I always had a short schedule, and it&#x27;s not always easy to work full blast nonstop&quot;.

===Music===
During development, Spielberg said that Warner Bros. would use a full orchestra, which some thought too expensive and impossible, but they ended up agreeing. Warner Bros. selected Bruce Broughton to write the theme tune (for which he would win a Daytime Emmy alongside Ruegger and Kaatz) and serve as music supervisor. Screen credits for the composers were given based on the amount of music composed for, or composed and reused in, the episode.

Twenty-six other composers were contracted to create original dramatic underscore for each episode: Julie and Steve Bernstein, Steven Bramson, Don Davis, John Debney, Ron Grant, Les Hooper, Carl Johnson, Elliot Kaplan, Arthur Kempel, Ralph Kessler, Albert Lloyd Olson, Hummie Mann, Dennis McCarthy, Joel McNeely, Peter Myers, Laurence Rosenthal, William Ross, Arthur B. Rubinstein, J. Eric Schmidt, David Slonaker, Fred Steiner, Morton Stevens, Richard Stone, Stephen James Taylor and Mark Watters. The composers conducted their own music. Of these composers, Broughton, Bramson, Davis, Olson, Stone, Taylor and Watters wrote the score to &quot;How I Spent My Vacation&quot;.

These composers would later write the musical scores for shows including &quot;Animaniacs&quot; and &quot;The Sylvester &amp; Tweety Mysteries.&quot;

===Films and television specials===
A feature-length film was released direct-to-video in 1992, entitled &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation&quot;. This was later re-edited and aired as part of the series. The length of the movie is 79 minutes. Fox aired &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Tiny Toons Christmas Special&quot; in prime time on December 6, 1992. This episode is a parody of &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;. Although the Christmas episode is called a special, it is only called this as it is Christmas-themed and is just a regular episode. &quot;The Tiny Toon Spring Break Special&quot; was aired on Fox during prime time on March 27, 1994. Fox aired &quot;Tiny Toons&#x27; Night Ghoulery&quot; in prime time on May 28, 1995.

==Reception==
The show was received with positive reviews; the Philadelphia Daily News remarked &quot;It&#x27;s the most cinematic first-run animated show on TV, mixing long shots, extra-tight closeups and odd perspectives for comic effect...&quot; Citizens&#x27; Voice noted &quot;Combining the animation of Warner Bros. and the creative direction of Spielberg, the collection of 65 half-hour cartoons is sure to make a big impression during the weekday late afternoon viewing period...&quot; However, The Journal News criticized about the series &quot;Adults looking for the smart-aleck attitude and wit of the old Warner Bros. classics will be disappointed, however; these are aimed squarely at kids and reflect a &#x27;90s sensibility, sneaking pro-social messages into madcap adventure stories.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Spin-offs===

In 1992, &quot;The Plucky Duck Show&quot; was produced as a spin-off for Fox Kids, based on the character Plucky Duck. Except for the premiere episode, &quot;The Return of Batduck&quot;, the show consisted entirely of recycled Plucky-centric episodes from &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;.

In 1998, a second spin-off, entitled &quot;Pinky, Elmyra &amp; the Brain&quot;, premiered on Kids&#x27; WB. This series featured the character Elmyra Duff as well as Pinky and the Brain, two other characters who were originally on &quot;Animaniacs&quot; before receiving their own spin-off series, also entitled &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot;. &quot;Pinky, Elmyra &amp; the Brain&quot; picks up after &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot; leaves off where Pinky and the Brain become Elmyra&#x27;s pets after Brain accidentally destroys their original home, ACME Labs, during an experiment. &quot;Pinky, Elmyra &amp; the Brain&quot; lasted for 13 episodes.

===Reboot===

A reboot, &quot;Tiny Toons Looniversity&quot;, was announced on October 28, 2020, through the Amblin Entertainment website. It was ordered for two seasons, with each episode running 30 minutes. As with the original series, Steven Spielberg will return to his role as executive producer. Sam Register, Darryl Frank, and Justin Falvey will also be serving as executive producers, while Erin Gibson will be the showrunner and co-executive producer. The series premiered on Max on September 8, 2023, and it aired on Cartoon Network on September 9, 2023.

The reboot&#x27;s first piece of concept art showed Buster Bunny and Babs Bunny, redesigned with different clothes and a new art style.

Tom Ascheim, then-current president of Cartoon Network, was quoted saying. &quot;&quot;Tiny Toons Looniversity&quot; will capture all the clever, subversive and smart humor that made &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; such a standout series. Fans old and new will love to laugh at and with these characters all over again.&quot;

Shortly after the reboot&#x27;s announcement, it was reported that several of the original voice actors were not going to be involved in the series. Cree Summer had revealed she was informed that Elmyra Duff was excluded. Additionally, Charlie Adler was not approached to reprise his role as Buster, nor was Maurice LaMarche as Dizzy Devil.

However, during an interview on July 12, 2021, Candi Milo said she would be returning to voice Granny but it remained uncertain if she would also be reprising her role as Sweetie Bird. A few days later, on July 15, Jeff Bergman confirmed that he would be returning to the series as well, voicing Bugs Bunny, Sylvester, and Foghorn Leghorn. He went into detail on the characters&#x27; roles in the series, explaining Foghorn would occupy as Acme Looniversity&#x27;s coach, while Bugs would take on a &quot;Dumbledore-like&quot; personality. He also confirmed recording sessions had begun. As shown in the teaser trailer, Lola Bunny and characters from the Warner Bros.-Seven Arts era will be appearing.

On July 9, 2022, it was announced that &quot;Tiny Toons Looniversity&quot; would be part of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; panel at San Diego Comic-Con 2022. On July 22, it was revealed that Ashleigh Crystal Hairston would be voicing Babs, instead of Tress MacNeille. Numerous pieces of concept art were shown, revealing a revamped Acme Looniversity and its interiors. This also confirmed many of the original series&#x27; major characters would be returning, some with updated appearances. Most notably, Elmyra was included in one of these pictures, disproving the claims of her removal. Some have suggested this meant Elmyra was added back at some point or was always intended to appear. Spielberg referred to the series as &quot;the best iteration of &quot;Tiny Toons&quot; he&#x27;d ever seen&quot;.

Character design supervisor Leonard Lee and showrunner Erin Gibson confirmed that Buster and Babs would be presented as twin siblings in the reboot, as opposed to best friends and potential romantic partners. This decision was criticized by fans of the original series. A July 2022 interview had crew members giving more details. They revealed the series was going to bring back all of the characters from the original show, &quot;down to Arnold the Pit Bull&quot;. They also hinted at an episode which takes place in outer space. Gibson provided an explanation behind the choice to make Buster and Babs related, saying, &quot;They&#x27;re fraternal twins, which was not an original plot point. I wanted to dive into a brother/sister relationship that looked really symbiotic and collaborative and supportive, not antagonistic. Seeing two people who are really on the same page, and then how do people who are so close make new friends? You know, find out who they are by these new relationships — these new college experiences while still having fun and doing the dumbest stuff you&#x27;ll ever see on TV, but having story and plot points and character development.&quot; Nate Cash added, &quot;And they look up to the faculty, they&#x27;re established Tunes who are like their gods, but then they&#x27;re like, &#x27;Who am I?&#x27; and &#x27;What&#x27;s my voice?&#x27; — which is a cool place to develop them as their own characters and not just mini versions of their counterparts.&quot;

On April 20, 2023, &quot;IGN&quot; shared an official teaser trailer on their YouTube site, stating the show was scheduled to premiere in Fall of 2023.

On June 22, 2023, the main voice cast was announced. Eric Bauza will voice Buster, Daffy Duck, and Gossamer, David Errigo Jr. will voice Plucky and Hamton, Tessa Netting will voice Sweetie, Bob Bergen and Cree Summer will reprise their roles as Porky Pig and Elmyra respectively, Candi Milo (the original voice of Sweetie) will now play Granny and Witch Hazel, and Fred Tatasciore will voice Yosemite Sam and the Tasmanian Devil, joining the aforementioned Bergman and Hairston. On July 21, 2023, two episodes were screened at San Diego Comic-Con. On the same day, the opening theme was uploaded online, with Matthew Janszen being announced as the composer. On August 18, 2023, a new trailer was released, announcing the premiere date as September 8, 2023, on Max and the following day on Cartoon Network.

<text>A ship prefix is a combination of letters, usually abbreviations, used in front of the name of a civilian or naval ship that has historically served numerous purposes, such as identifying the vessel&#x27;s mode of propulsion, purpose, or ownership/nationality. In the modern environment, prefixes are cited inconsistently in civilian service, whereas in government service a vessel&#x27;s prefix is seldom omitted due to government regulations dictating that a certain prefix be used. Today the common practice is to use a single prefix for all warships of a nation&#x27;s navy, and other prefixes for auxiliaries and ships of allied services, such as coast guards. For example, the modern navy of Japan adopts the prefix &quot;JS&quot; – Japanese Ship. However, not all navies use prefixes. Among the blue-water navies, those of France, Brazil, China, Russia, Germany, and Spain do not use ship prefixes. NATO designations such as FS (French Ship), FGS (Federal German Ship), and SPS (Spanish Ship) can be used if needed.

==Usage==
Historically, prefixes for civilian vessels often identified the vessel&#x27;s mode of propulsion, such as &quot;MV&quot; (motor vessel), &quot;SS&quot; (screw steamer; often cited as &quot;steam ship&quot;), or &quot;PS&quot; (paddle steamer).

These days, general civilian prefixes are used inconsistently, and frequently not at all. In terms of abbreviations that may reflect a vessel&#x27;s purpose or function, technology has introduced a broad variety of differently named vessels onto the world&#x27;s oceans, such as &quot;LPGC&quot; (liquified petroleum gas carrier), or &quot;TB&quot; (tug-boat), or &quot;DB&quot; (derrick barge). In many cases though, these abbreviations are used for purely formal, legal identification and are not used colloquially or in the daily working environment. Prefixes indicating a vessel&#x27;s purpose (e.g., &quot;RMS&quot; for a Royal Mail ship or &quot;RV&quot; for research vessel) are also used.

Prefixes used for naval ships primarily reflect ownership, but may also indicate a vessel&#x27;s type or purpose as a sub-set. Historically, the most significant navy was Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy, which has usually used the prefix &quot;HMS&quot;, standing for &quot;His/Her Majesty&#x27;s Ship&quot;. The Royal Navy also adopted nomenclature that reflected a vessel&#x27;s type or purpose, e.g. HM Sloop. Commonwealth navies adopted a variation, with, for example, HMAS, HMCS, and HMNZS pertaining to Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, respectively.

In the early days of the United States Navy, abbreviations often included the type of vessel, for instance &quot;USF&quot; (United States Frigate), but this method was abandoned by President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Executive Order No. 549 of 1907, which made &quot;United States Ship&quot; (USS) the standard signifier for USN ships on active commissioned service. United States Navy prefixes officially only apply while a ship is in active commission, with only the name used before or after a period of commission and for all vessels &quot;in service&quot; rather than commissioned status.

However, not all navies used prefixes; this includes the significant navies of China, France and Russia.

From the 20th century onwards, most navies identify ships by letters or hull numbers (pennant numbers) or a combination of such. These identification codes were, and still are, painted on the side of the ship. Each navy has its own system: the United States Navy uses hull classification symbols, and the Royal Navy (e.g. &#x27;D35&#x27; is destroyer 35 – HMS &quot;Dragon&quot;) and other navies of Europe and the Commonwealth use pennant numbers.

These tables list both current and historical prefixes known to have been used.

== Generic (merchant navy) prefixes ==

These prefixes are generally used for merchant vessels of any nationality.

==National or military prefixes==

=== Prefix conventions ===
The designations for United Kingdom ships applied at the time of the British Empire, before the establishment of separate navies for the Dominions.

In the Royal Netherlands Navy, &quot;HNLMS&quot; is the prefix in English, a translation of the Dutch original &quot;Hr.Ms.&quot; or &quot;Zr.Ms.&quot;. &quot;Hr.Ms.&quot; should preferably not be used in English-language documents; nevertheless it is often seen on the World Wide Web. Until the moment a Dutch naval ship officially enters active service in the fleet, the ship&#x27;s name is used without the prefix. Since King Willem-Alexander succeeded Queen Beatrix on 30 April 2013, &quot;Hr.Ms.&quot; is replaced by &quot;Zr.Ms.&quot;.

In Australia, the prefix NUSHIP is used to denote ships that have yet to be commissioned into the fleet.

In the United States, all prefixes other than &quot;USS&quot;, &quot;USNS&quot;, &quot;USNV&quot;, and &quot;USRC&quot; were made obsolete in 1901, when President Theodore Roosevelt issued an Executive order fixing American naval nomenclature. USRC was replaced by USCGC when the Revenue Cutter Service merged with the United States Lifesaving Service to become the United States Coast Guard in 1915. USLHT also was replaced by USCGC when the United States Lighthouse Service became a part of the U.S. Coast Guard in 1939. USC&amp;GS was replaced by NOAAS when the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey merged with other U.S. Government scientific agencies to form the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in 1970. USFC was replaced by USFS when the United States Commission on Fish and Fisheries was reorganized as the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries in 1903, and USFS in turn was replaced in 1940 by US FWS when the Bureau of Fisheries merged with the United States Department of the Interior&#x27;s Division of Biological Survey to form the Department of the Interior&#x27;s Fish and Wildlife Service (which in 1956 was reorganized as the United States Fish and Wildlife Service). Seagoing ships Fish and Wildlife Service ships with the prefix US FWS that were transferred to NOAA when NOAA was created in 1970 switched to the NOAAS prefix.

A United States Navy ship that is not in active commission does not hold the title of United States Ship with simply the name without prefix used before and after commissioned service. Vessels, such as yard and harbor craft that are not commissioned and &quot;in service&quot; are officially referred to by name or hull number without prefix. Prior to commissioning, ships may be described as a pre-commissioning unit or PCU; for example, USS &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot; was described as the &quot;pre-commissioning unit (PCU) &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;&quot; prior to her commissioning in 2017. Military Sealift Command (MSC) civilian crewed ships &quot;in service&quot; are given the prefix United States Naval Ship (USNS).

When it is stricken from the fleet list, a ship typically has the prefix &quot;ex-&quot; added to its name, to distinguish it from any active ships bearing the same name. For example, after USS &quot;Constellation&quot; (CV-64) was retired in 2003, she became referred to as ex-&quot;Constellation&quot;.

== In science fiction ==
Fictional equivalents of tri-letter prefixes frequently appear in English-language science fiction works, applied to seafaring and spaceborne ships alike. 
* &quot;Star Trek&quot; – the United Federation of Planets uses the prefix &quot;USS&quot; for its starships. Dialogue in earlier episodes of the series indicated that it referred to &quot;United Space Ship&quot;. In the alternate &quot;Mirror Universe&quot;, the Terran Empire use an &quot;ISS&quot; prefix instead. Other races use different prefixes for their ships:
** Klingons use IKS (Imperial Klingon Ship) or IKC (Imperial Klingon Cruiser).
** Romulan vessels typically receive the prefix IRW (Imperial Romulan Warbird), or RIS where some speculate that it means &quot;Romulan Imperial Ship&quot;, and ChR. (ChR is from novelist Diane Duane&#x27;s imagining of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; Universe, in which the Romulans refer to their home planet as &quot;Ch&#x27;Rihan&quot;. Though Duane&#x27;s version has a loyal following among many fans, it is not considered official &quot;Star Trek&quot; canon; similarly, the Ferengi designation of FMS, and the Cardassian CDS, are also not canon.)
* &quot;Star Wars&quot; – The Galactic Empire sometimes uses the prefix ISD for Imperial Star Destroyer.
* &quot;Babylon 5&quot; – The Earth Alliance uses the prefix &quot;EAS&quot; for &quot;Earth Alliance Ship&quot;. Some fan material also uses it for &quot;Earth Alliance Station&quot;.
* &quot;&quot; – The Federation uses the prefix &quot;FNS&quot; (Federal Naval Ship) for some military ships. The Empire uses &quot;INV&quot; (Imperial Naval Vessel). The alliance uses &quot;ADF&quot; (Alliance Defense Force).
* &quot;Firefly&quot; – Vessels in the Union of Allied Planets fleet are given the prefix &quot;IAV&quot;, for Interstellar Alliance Vessel.
* &quot;Wing Commander&quot; – The Terran Confederation uses TCS (Terran Confederation Ship) for its vessels.
* &quot;Halo&quot; – United Nations Space Command spacecraft use the prefix &quot;UNSC&quot;. The Covenant use three letter designations for ship class such as CAS or CSO
* &quot;Mass Effect&quot; – features several prefixes, primarily &quot;SSV&quot; for &quot;Systems Alliance space vehicle&quot; and &quot;MSV&quot; for &quot;Merchant Space Vehicle&quot;, used on numerous human commercial ships, as well as &quot;PFS&quot; for a Turian Hierarchy naval craft, and a freighter AML &quot;Demeter&quot; of unknown affiliation.
* &quot;Dead Space&quot; – &quot;USG&quot;, standing for &quot;United Spacefaring Guild&quot;, which oversees civilian spacecraft operation, including the planet-cracker class leader USG &quot;Ishimura&quot; of the Concordance Extraction Corporation; &quot;USM&quot; for the Earth Defense Force of EarthGov; and &quot;CMS&quot; for its predecessor, the Sovereign Colonies Armed Forces.
* &quot;&quot; – The United Earth Directorate uses DSS (presumably for Directorate Space Ship, e. g. &quot;DSS Aleksander&quot;); the Terran Confederacy used CSF (Confederate Space Fleet, e. g. &quot;CSF Ragnorak&quot;) for their battlecruisers.
* &quot;Killzone&quot; – The Interplanetary Strategic Alliance (ISA) uses &quot;ISC&quot;, for Interplanetary Strategic Cruiser.
* &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; – The Federated Nations use &quot;FNS&quot;, presumably meaning &quot;Federated Nations Ship&quot;.
* &quot;Alien&quot; – The ships use prefix &quot;USCSS&quot; for &quot;United States Cargo SpaceShip&quot; on the Nostromo, Prometheus, and Covenant.
* &quot;The Lost Fleet&quot; – The Alliance use the prefix &quot;ASN&quot; for &quot;Allied Systems Navy&quot; (or possibly &quot;Alliance of Systems Navy&quot;), the Syndicate Worlds do not use prefixes.
* &quot;CoDominium&quot; – CoDominium vessels use the prefix &quot;CDS&quot; for CoDominium Ship.
* &quot;Honorverse&quot; – The Manticoran kingdom uses &quot;HMS&quot; as a prefix, the Graysons use &quot;GNS&quot;(Grayson Navy Ship), and the Havenite ships use &quot;PNS&quot; (People&#x27;s Navy Ship) and later &quot;RHNS&quot; (Republic of Haven Navy Ship), being reflections of actual ship prefixing traditions, and mirroring the Napoleonic wars. The Solarian League uses &quot;SLNS&quot; (Solarian League Navy Ship) and the Andermani Empire uses &quot;IANS&quot; for Imperial Andermani Navy Ship. 
* &quot;The Culture&quot; – Ships are identified by a three-letter prefix denoting class (such as GSV for &quot;General Systems Vehicle&quot; or ROU for &quot;Rapid Offensive Unit&quot;), followed by their personal name.
* &quot;The Expanse&quot; – Ships of the United Nations Navy use the prefix &quot;UNN,&quot; while ships of the Martian Congressional Republic Navy are prefixed with &quot;MCRN&quot;. The Nauvoo, a generation ship commissioned by the Church of Latter Day Saints was prefixed with &quot;LDSS&quot; for &quot;Latter Day Saints&#x27; Ship&quot;, and later changed to &quot;OPAS&quot; and re-christened as the &quot;OPAS Behemoth&quot; representing the Outer Planets Alliance.
* &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; – Ships mentioned there have prefixes such as ITV (&quot;Interstellar Transport Vessel&quot;, the first non-tutorial match in the tournament happens on board of &quot;ITV Oblivion&quot;) and ISV (&quot;Interstellar Science Vessel&quot;, ship&#x27;s name being &quot;ISV-Kran&quot; from &quot;Unreal&quot;).
* &quot;Unreal: Return to Na Pali&quot; – ISV (&quot;ISV-Kran&quot;) and UMS (&quot;Unified Military Services&quot;, a prefix for warships).
* &quot;The Orville&quot;—The Planetary Union uses the prefix &quot;USS&quot;, presumably for &quot;Union Space Ship&quot; (in homage to &quot;Star Trek&quot;).
* &quot;Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon&quot; - The Terran Empire uses the prefix RLS, which stands for Royal Light Ship; this is also a direct homage to Robert Louis Stevenson, author of the original &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. The Procyon Expanse uses the prefix PSR, which stands for Procyon Star Runner.
* &quot;Destroyermen&quot; - the Grand Alliance uses the &quot;USS&quot; prefix, since all Allied warships are run by the Americaan (sic) Clan. The Alliance&#x27;s only airship is given the prefix &quot;UHAS&quot; (United Homes Air Ship). The Empire of New Britain Isles uses &quot;HIMS&quot; (His/Her Imperial Majesty&#x27;s Ship). The Republic of Real People uses &quot;RRPS&quot; (Republic of Real People Ship). The New United States uses &quot;NUSS&quot; (New United States Ship). Neither the Holy Dominion nor the League of Tripoli use prefixes, although the KMS &quot;Hessen&quot; is mentioned once, it is not clear if the prefix is internally used or not.
*&quot;Titanfall&quot; - The Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation, the main antagonists of the series, use the &quot;IMS&quot; prefix. The origin of this prefix is unknown.
*&quot;FreeSpace&quot; - Various ship prefixes are used depending on the species, faction allegiance, and class of the vehicle. Prominent examples include: &quot;GT&quot; and &quot;GV&quot; for &quot;Galactic Terran&quot; and &quot;Galactic Vasudan&quot; respectively, &quot;NT&quot; for &quot;Neo-Terran,&quot; &quot;PV&quot; for &quot;Parliamentary Vasudan,&quot; and just &quot;S&quot; for &quot;Shivan.&quot; These are then further supplemented with a type of ship identifier following the species and faction prefixes, such as &quot;B&quot; for &quot;Bomber,&quot; &quot;C&quot; for &quot;Cruiser,&quot; &quot;Cv&quot; for &quot;Corvette,&quot; &quot;D&quot; for &quot;Destroyer,&quot; and &quot;F&quot; for &quot;Fighter,&quot; among many examples. As such, &quot;PVD&quot; would indicate a &quot;Parliamentary Vasudan Destroyer,&quot; &quot;NTF&quot; would indicate a &quot;Neo-Terran Fighter,&quot; &quot;GTC&quot; would indicate a &quot;Galactic Terran Cruiser&quot;, &quot;GVCv&quot; would indicate a &quot;Galactic Vasudan Corvette,&quot; and &quot;SB&quot; would indicate a &quot;Shivan Bomber.&quot;
*&quot;Helldivers 2&quot; - &quot;SES&quot; is used for &quot;Super Earth Ship&quot;

<text>A television film, alternatively known as a television movie, made-for-TV film/movie, telefilm, telemovie or TV film/movie, is a feature-length film that is produced and originally distributed by or to a television network, in contrast to theatrical films made for initial showing in movie theaters, and direct-to-video films made for initial release on home video formats. In certain cases, such films may also be referred to and shown as a miniseries, which typically indicates a film that has been divided into multiple parts or a series that contains a predetermined, limited number of episodes.

== Origins and history ==

Precursors of &quot;television movies&quot; include &quot;Talk Faster, Mister&quot;, which aired on WABD (now WNYW) in New York City on December 18, 1944, and was produced by RKO Pictures, and the 1957 &quot;The Pied Piper of Hamelin&quot;, based on the poem by Robert Browning, and starring Van Johnson, one of the first filmed &quot;family musicals&quot; made directly for television. That film was made in Technicolor, a first for television, which ordinarily used color processes originated by specific networks. Most &quot;family musicals&quot; of the time, such as &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, were not filmed but broadcast live and preserved on kinescope, a recording of a television program made by filming the picture from a video monitor – and the only (relatively inexpensive) method of recording a television program until the invention of videotape.

Many television networks were against film programming, fearing that it would loosen the network&#x27;s arrangements with sponsors and affiliates by encouraging station managers to make independent deals with advertisers and film producers.

Conversely, beginning in the 1950s episodes of American television series would be placed together and released as feature films in overseas cinemas.

Television networks were in control of the most valuable prime time slots available for programming, so syndicators of independent television films had to settle for fewer television markets and less desirable time periods. This meant much smaller advertising revenues and license fees compared with network-supplied programming.

The term &quot;made-for-TV movie&quot; was coined in the United States in the early 1960s as an incentive for movie audiences to stay home and watch what was promoted as the equivalent of a first-run theatrical film. Beginning in 1961 with &quot;NBC Saturday Night at the Movies&quot;, a prime time network showing of a television premiere of a major theatrical film release, the other networks soon copied the format, with each of the networks having several &quot;[Day of the Week] Night at the Movies&quot; showcases which led to a shortage of movie studio product. The first of these made-for-TV movies is generally acknowledged to be &quot;See How They Run&quot;, which debuted on NBC on October 7, 1964. A previous film, &quot;The Killers&quot;, starring Lee Marvin and Ronald Reagan, was filmed as a TV-movie, although NBC decided it was too violent for television and it was released theatrically instead.

The second film to be considered a television movie, Don Siegel&#x27;s &quot;The Hanged Man&quot;, was broadcast by NBC on November 18, 1964.

These features originally filled a 90-minute programming time slot (including commercials), later expanded to two hours, and were usually broadcast as a weekly anthology television series (for example, the &quot;ABC Movie of the Week&quot;). Many early television movies featured major stars, and some were accorded higher budgets than standard television series of the same length, including the major dramatic anthology programs which they came to replace.

In 1996, 264 made-for-TV movies were made by five of the six largest American television networks at the time (CBS, NBC, Fox, ABC, and UPN), averaging a 7.5 rating. By 2000, only 146 TV movies were made by those five networks, averaging a 5.4 rating, while the number of made-for-cable movies made annually in the U.S. doubled between 1990 and 2000.

In several respects, television films resemble B movies, the low-budget films issued by major studios from the 1930s through the 1950s for short-term showings in movie theaters, usually as a double bill alongside a major studio release. Like made-for-TV movies, B movies were designed as a disposable product, had low production costs and featured second-tier actors.

== Examples ==

ABC&#x27;s &quot;Battlestar Galactica: Saga of a Star World&quot; premiered to an audience of over 60 million people on September 17, 1978.

The most-watched television movie of all time was ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Day After&quot;, which premiered on November 20, 1983, to an estimated audience of 100 million people. The film depicted America after a nuclear war with the Soviet Union, and was the subject of much controversy and discussion at the time of its release due to its graphic nature and subject matter. The BBC&#x27;s 1984 television film &quot;Threads&quot; earned a similar reputation in the United Kingdom as it followed two families and workers of Sheffield City Council in the run up and aftermath of a nuclear war. The two are often compared on aspects such as realism.

Another popular and critically acclaimed television movie was 1971&#x27;s &quot;Duel&quot;, written by Richard Matheson, directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Dennis Weaver. Such was the quality and popularity of &quot;Duel&quot; that it was released to cinemas in Europe and Australia, and had a limited theatrical release to some venues in the United States and Canada. The 1971 made-for-TV movie &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot; was also briefly released to theatres after its success on television, and was even remade in 2001. In some instances, television movies of the period had more explicit content included in the versions prepared to be exhibited theatrically in Europe. Examples of this include &quot;The Legend of Lizzie Borden&quot;, &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, &quot;Prince of Bel Air&quot; and &quot;Spectre&quot;.

Many television movies released in the 1970s were a source of controversy, such as Linda Blair&#x27;s 1974 film &quot;Born Innocent&quot; and 1975&#x27;s &quot;Sarah T. - Portrait of a Teenage Alcoholic&quot;, as well as 1976&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and its 1977 sequel, &quot;&quot;, which were vehicles for former &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; actress Eve Plumb. Another significant film was Elizabeth Montgomery&#x27;s portrayal of a rape victim in the drama &quot;A Case of Rape&quot; (1974).

&quot;My Sweet Charlie&quot; (1970) with Patty Duke and Al Freeman Jr. dealt with racial prejudice, and &quot;That Certain Summer&quot; (1972), starring Hal Holbrook and Martin Sheen, although controversial, was considered the first television movie to approach the subject of homosexuality in a non-threatening manner. &quot;If These Walls Could Talk&quot;, a film which deals with abortion in three different decades (the 1950s, the 1970s and the 1990s) became a huge success, and was HBO&#x27;s highest rated film on record.

If a network orders a two-hour television pilot for a proposed show, it will usually broadcast it as a television movie to recoup some of the costs even if the network chooses to not order the show to series. Often a successful series may spawn a television movie sequel after ending its run. For example, &quot;Babylon 5: The Gathering&quot; launched the science fiction series &quot;Babylon 5&quot; and is considered to be distinct from the show&#x27;s regular run of one-hour episodes. &quot;Babylon 5&quot; also has several made-for-TV movie sequels set within the same fictional continuity. The 2003 remake of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; began as a two-part miniseries that later continued as a weekly television program. Another example is the Showtime movie &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot;, which launched the sitcom of the same name that originally aired on ABC, and used the same actress (Melissa Joan Hart) for the lead role in both. The term &quot;TV movie&quot; is also frequently used as vehicles for &quot;reunions&quot; of long-departed series, as in &quot;Return to Mayberry&quot; and &quot;A Very Brady Christmas&quot;. They can also be a spin-off from a TV series including &quot;The Incredible Hulk Returns&quot;, &quot;The Trial of the Incredible Hulk&quot; and &quot;The Death of the Incredible Hulk&quot;.

Occasionally, television movies are used as sequels to successful theatrical films. For example, only the first film in &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; series was released theatrically. &quot;The Parent Trap II&quot;, &quot;III&quot; and &quot;Hawaiian Honeymoon&quot; were produced for television, and similarly, the &quot;Midnight Run&quot; sequels have all been released as made-for-TV movies despite the first having a strong run in theaters. These types of films may be, and more commonly are, released direct-to-video; there have been some films, such as &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning&quot; (a prequel to the film version of &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;) and &quot;James A. Michener&#x27;s Texas&quot;, which have been released near simultaneously on DVD and on television, but have never been released in theatres.

Made-for-TV movie musicals have also become popular. One prime example is the &quot;High School Musical&quot; series, which aired its first two films on the Disney Channel. The first television movie was so successful that a sequel was produced, &quot;High School Musical 2&quot;, that debuted in August 2007 to 17.2 million viewers (this made it the highest-rated non-sports program in the history of basic cable and the highest-rated made-for-cable movie premiere on record). Due to the popularity of the first two films, the second &quot;HSM&quot; sequel, &quot;High School Musical 3: Senior Year&quot;, was released as a theatrical film in 2008 instead of airing on Disney Channel; &quot;High School Musical 3&quot; became one of the highest-grossing movie musicals.

Television movies traditionally were often broadcast by the major networks during sweeps season. Such offerings now are very rare; as Ken Tucker noted while reviewing the Jesse Stone CBS television movies, &quot;broadcast networks aren&#x27;t investing in made-for-TV movies anymore&quot;. The slack has been taken up by cable networks such as Hallmark Channel, Syfy, Lifetime and HBO, with productions such as &quot;Temple Grandin&quot; and &quot;Recount&quot;, often utilizing top creative talent.

High-calibre limited programming which would have been formerly scheduled solely as a two-hour film or miniseries also has been re-adapted to the newer &quot;limited series&quot; format over a period of weeks (rather than the consecutive days usually defined by a miniseries) where a conclusion is assured; an example of such would be &quot;The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story&quot;, and these are most often seen on cable networks and streaming services such as Netflix.

== Production and quality ==
In a 1991 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, television critic John J. O&#x27;Connor wrote that &quot;few artifacts of popular culture invite more condescension than the made-for-television movie&quot;. Network-made television movies in the United States have tended to be inexpensively-produced and perceived to be of low quality. Stylistically, these films often resemble single episodes of dramatic television series. Often, television films are made to &quot;cash in&quot; on the interest centering on stories currently prominent in the news, as the films based on the &quot;Long Island Lolita&quot; scandal involving Joey Buttafuoco and Amy Fisher were in 1993.

The stories are written to reach periodic semi-cliffhangers coinciding with the network-scheduled times for the insertion of commercials, and are further managed to fill, but not exceed, the fixed running times allotted by the network to each movie &quot;series&quot;. In the case of films made for cable channels, they may rely on common, repetitive tropes (Hallmark Channel, for example, is notorious for its formulaic holiday romances, while Lifetime movies are well known for their common use of damsel in distress storylines). The movies tend to rely on smaller casts, one such exception being those produced for premium cable, such as &quot;Behind the Candelabra&quot; (which featured established film actors Michael Douglas and Matt Damon in the lead roles) and a limited range of scene settings and camera setups. Even Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Duel&quot;, while having decent production values, features a very small cast (apart from Dennis Weaver, all other actors appearing in the film play smaller roles) and mostly outdoor shooting locations in the desert.

The movies typically employ smaller crews, and rarely feature expensive special effects. Although a film&#x27;s expenses would be lessened by filming using video, as the movies were contracted by television studios, these films were required to be shot on 35 mm film. Various techniques are often employed to &quot;pad&quot; television movies with low budgets and underdeveloped scripts, such as music video-style montages, flashbacks, or repeated footage, and extended periods of dramatic slow motion footage. However, the less expensive digital 24p video format has made some quality improvements on the television movie market.

Part of the reason for the lower budgets comes from the lack of revenue streams from them; whereas a theatrical film can make money from ticket sales, ancillary markets, and syndication, most television films lacked those revenue streams, and the films are seldom rerun. Raconteur Jean Shepherd produced several television films in the 1970s and 1980s before realizing that the proceeds from his first theatrical film, &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; (released in 1983), far exceeded anything he had ever done in television.

Nonetheless, notable exceptions exist of high production quality and well-known casts and crews that even earned awards, such as &quot;The Diamond Fleece&quot;, a 1992 Canadian TV film directed by Al Waxman and starring Ben Cross, Kate Nelligan and Brian Dennehy. It earned Nelligan the 1993 Gemini Award for &quot;Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series&quot;.

== Movie-length episodes of television shows ==
Occasionally, a long-running television series is used as the basis for television movies that air during the show&#x27;s run (as opposed to the above-mentioned &quot;reunion specials&quot;). Typically, such movies employ a filmed single-camera setup even if the television series is videotaped using a multiple-camera setup, but are written to be easily broken up into individual 30- or 60-minute episodes for syndication. Many such movies relocate the cast of the show to an exotic overseas setting. However, although they may be advertised as movies, they are really simply extended episodes of television shows, such as the pilots and the finales of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. Most of these are made and shown during sweeps period in order to attract a large television audience and boost viewership for a show.

Crossover episodes containing a number of episodes of the characters of individual series interacting with characters across different shows (as has been done with the &quot;CSI&quot;, &quot;NCIS&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot; franchises, along with between &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; and &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, &quot;Scandal&quot; and &quot;How to Get Away with Murder&quot;, and &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; and &quot;The Practice&quot;) also play as films, encouraging tune-in among all the series crossed over to effectively create a multiple-hour plot that plays as a film when watched as a whole.

<text>Robert Gaston Fuller (October 22, 1942 – July 18, 1966) was an American rock singer, songwriter, and guitarist best known for &quot;Let Her Dance&quot; and his cover of the Crickets&#x27; &quot;I Fought the Law,&quot; recorded with his group The Bobby Fuller Four.

==Early life==
Born in Baytown, Texas, Fuller was born to Lawson Sheppard Fuller and Eva Lorraine Barrett Fuller, the middle of three boys, having a maternal older half-brother, Jack, and a younger brother, Randy. Fuller moved as a small child to Salt Lake City, Utah, where he remained until 1956, when he and his family moved to El Paso, Texas. His father got a job at El Paso Natural Gas at that time. It was the same year that Elvis Presley became popular, and Bobby Fuller became mesmerized by the new rock and roll star. Fuller soon adopted the style of fellow Texan Buddy Holly, fronting a four-man combo and often using original material.

==Career==

During the early 1960s, he played in clubs and bars in El Paso, and he recorded on independent record labels in Texas with a constantly changing line-up. The only constant band members were Fuller and his younger brother, Randy, on bass. These independent releases (except two songs recorded at the studio of Norman Petty in Clovis), and an excursion to Yucca Records, also in New Mexico, were recorded in the Fullers&#x27; own home studio, with Fuller acting as the producer. He even built a primitive echo chamber in the back yard. The quality of the recordings, using a couple of microphones and a mixing board purchased from a local radio station, was so impressive that he offered the use of his &quot;studio&quot; to local acts for free so he could hone his production skills.

Fuller moved to Los Angeles in 1964 with his band The Bobby Fuller Four and was signed to Mustang Records by producer Bob Keane, who was noted for discovering Ritchie Valens and producing many surf music groups. By this time, the group consisted of Fuller and his brother Randy on vocals/guitar and bass respectively, Jim Reese on guitar and DeWayne Quirico on drums. This lineup recorded &quot;I Fought The Law&quot;. (There are actually two versions of &quot;I Fought The Law&quot; by Fuller, the original hit that was released as a 45-rpm single and the re-recording that was issued on an album. The arrangements are identical, but the vocals by Fuller are slightly different.)

At a time when the British Invasion and folk rock were the dominant genres in rock, Fuller stuck to Buddy Holly&#x27;s style of classic rock and roll with Tex Mex flourishes. His recordings, both covers and originals, also reveal the influences of Eddie Cochran, The Beatles, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, and The Everly Brothers, as well as surf guitar. Less well known was Fuller&#x27;s ability to emulate the reverb-laden surf guitar of Dick Dale and The Ventures. His first Top 40 hit was the self-penned &quot;Let Her Dance&quot;. His second hit, &quot;I Fought the Law&quot;, peaked at No. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on March 12–19, 1966. The song was originally written and recorded by Sonny Curtis, who became a member of Buddy Holly&#x27;s former group The Crickets after Holly&#x27;s death. The group&#x27;s third Top 40 single was a cover of Holly&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Made a Fool of You&quot;.

==Death==
Within months of &quot;I Fought the Law&quot; becoming a top 10 hit, Fuller was found dead in an automobile parked outside his Hollywood apartment. The Los Angeles deputy medical examiner, Jerry Nelson, performed the autopsy. According to Dean Kuipers: &quot;The report states that Bobby&#x27;s face, chest, and side were covered in &#x27;petechial hemorrhages,&#x27; probably caused by gasoline vapors and the summer heat. He found no bruises, no broken bones, no cuts. No evidence of beating.&quot; Kuipers further explains that boxes for &quot;accident&quot; and &quot;suicide&quot; were checked, but next to the boxes were question marks. Despite the official cause of death, some commentators believe Fuller was murdered.

Erik Greene, a relative of Sam Cooke, has cited similarities in the deaths of Cooke and Fuller. Fuller&#x27;s bandmate Jim Reese suspected that Charles Manson played a role in Fuller&#x27;s death, but never provided credible evidence; Manson was in prison from 1961 to 1967. A sensationalist crime website has speculated that the Los Angeles Police Department may have been involved because of Fuller&#x27;s connection to a Mafia-related woman.

Fuller was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles. His death was profiled in a segment of &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot;.

His death was also explored in the May 11, 2015, episode of the NPR program &quot;All Things Considered.&quot; The program references the book &quot;I Fought the Law: The Life and Strange Death of Bobby Fuller&quot; by Miriam Linna, with contributions by Randy Fuller. Sometime after the &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; segment in question initially aired, the cause of Fuller&#x27;s death was officially changed from &quot;suicide&quot; to &quot;accident&quot;.

==In popular culture==
New York City Celtic rock band Black 47 released a song titled &quot;Who Killed Bobby Fuller&quot; on their second album, &quot;Home of the Brave&quot;, in 1994, and Atlanta indie rock band The Rock*A*Teens released an identically titled song on their 1996 self-titled debut album. Lou Reed referenced both Bobby Fuller by name and &quot;I Fought the Law&quot; on the track &quot;Dirt&quot; from his 1978 album &quot;Street Hassle&quot;, as did indie rock band Metric on their 2006 single &quot;Monster Hospital&quot;. In 2013, producer and artist Terry Manning released a tribute album to his friend and mentor Bobby Fuller entitled &quot;West Texas Skyline&quot;. In 2016 the Austin band Holy Wave (whose members are originally from El Paso) released the song &quot;California Took My Bobby Away&quot; about Bobby Fuller, featured on their album &quot;Freaks of Nurture&quot;. In 2017, Chuck Prophet released an album titled &quot;Bobby Fuller Died for Your Sins&quot;.

<text>The Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) (, rarely ), founded in 1916 as the Society of Motion Picture Engineers or SMPE, is a global professional association of engineers, technologists, and executives working in the media and entertainment industry. As an internationally recognized standards organization, SMPTE has published more than 800 technical standards and related documents for broadcast, filmmaking, digital cinema, audio recording, information technology (IT), and medical imaging. 

SMPTE also publishes the SMPTE Motion Imaging Journal, provides networking opportunities for its members, produces academic conferences and exhibitions, and performs other industry-related functions. SMPTE membership is open to any individual or organization with an interest in the subject matter. In the US, SMPTE is a 501(c)3 non-profit charitable organization.

==History==
An informal organizational meeting was held in April 1916 at the Astor Hotel in New York City. Enthusiasm and interest increased, and meetings were held in New York and Chicago, culminating in the founding of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers in the Oak Room of the Raleigh Hotel, Washington DC on the 24th of July. Ten industry stakeholders attended and signed the Articles of Incorporation. Papers of incorporation were executed on 24 July 1916, were filed on 10 August in Washington DC. With a second meeting scheduled, invitations were telegraphed to Jenkin’s industry friends, i.e., key players and engineering executives in the motion picture industry.

Three months later, 26 attended the first “official” meeting of the Society, the SMPE, at the Hotel Astor in New York City, on 2 and 3 October 1916. Jenkins was formally elected president, a constitution was ratified, an emblem for the Society was approved, and six committees were established. 

At the July 1917 Society Convention in Chicago, a set of specifications including the dimensions of 35 mm film, 16 frames per second, etc. were adopted. SMPE set and issued a formal document reached by consensus, its first as an accredited Standards Development Organization (SDO), registering the specifications with the United States Bureau of Standards. 

The SMPTE Centennial Gala took place on Friday, 28 October 2016, following the annual Conference and Exhibition; James Cameron and Douglas Trumbull received SMPTE’s top honors. SMPTE officially bestowed Honorary Membership, the Society’s highest honor, upon &quot;Avatar&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot; director Cameron in recognition of his work advancing visual effects (VFX), motion capture, and stereoscopic 3D photography, as well as his experimentation in HFR. Presented by Oscar-winning special effects cinematographer Richard Edlund, SMPTE honored Trumbull, who was responsible for the VFX in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, with the Society’s most prestigious medal award, the Progress Medal. The award recognized Trumbull’s contributions to VFX, stereoscopic 3D, and HFR cinema, including his current work to enable stereoscopic 3D with his 120-frames-per-second Magi system.

==Educational and professional development activities==
SMPTE&#x27;s educational and professional development activities include technical presentations at regular meetings of its local Sections, annual and biennial conferences in the US and Australia and the &quot;SMPTE Motion Imaging Journal&quot;. The society sponsors many awards, the oldest of which are the SMPTE Progress Medal, the Samuel Warner Memorial Medal, and the David Sarnoff Medal. SMPTE also has a number of Student Chapters and sponsors scholarships for college students in the motion imaging disciplines.

==Standards==
SMPTE standards documents are copyrighted and may be purchased from the SMPTE website, or other distributors of technical standards. Standards documents may be purchased by the general public. Significant standards promulgated by SMPTE include:

*All film and television transmission formats and media, including digital.
*Physical interfaces for transmission of television signals and related data (such as SMPTE timecode and the serial digital interface) (SDI)
*SMPTE color bars
*Test card patterns and other diagnostic tools
*The Material Exchange Format (MXF)
*SMPTE 2110
*SMPTE ST 421:2013 (VC-1 video codec)

=== Film format ===
SMP(T)E&#x27;S first standard was to get everyone using 35-mm film width, four sprocket holes per frame, 1.37:1 picture ratio. Until then, there were competing film formats. With the standard, theaters could all run the same films.

=== Film frame rate ===
SMP(T)E&#x27;s standard in 1927 was for speed at which sound film is shown, 24 frames per second.

=== 3D television ===
SMPTE&#x27;s taskforce on &quot;3D to the home&quot; produced a report on the issues and challenges and suggested minimum standards for the 3D home master that would be distributed after post-production to the ingest points of distribution channels for 3D video content. A group within the standards committees has begun to work on the formal definition of the SMPTE 3D Home Master.

=== Digital cinema ===
In 1999, SMPTE established the DC28 technology committee, for the foundations of Digital Cinema.

<doc id="164348" wikidata="Q2409905" url="?curid=164348" title="The Bobby Fuller Four">
<text>The Bobby Fuller Four (sometimes stylized as Bobby Fuller 4) was a popular mid-1960s American rock &amp; roll band started by Bobby Fuller. First formed in 1962 in Fuller&#x27;s hometown of El Paso, Texas, the group went on to produce some of its most memorable hits under the Mustang Records label in Hollywood, California. The band&#x27;s most successful songs include &quot;Let Her Dance&quot;, &quot;I Fought the Law&quot; and &quot;Love&#x27;s Made a Fool of You&quot;.

==History==
Fuller recorded his first single, &quot;You&#x27;re in Love&quot;, in 1961. Recorded in his parents&#x27; living room with the Embers, a local band he played in, it became a regional hit. Fuller started a new band in 1962, backed by his brother Randy on bass and Gaylord Grimes on drums. They had their single, &quot;Gently My Love&quot;, professionally recorded at Norman Petty Recording Studios in Clovis, New Mexico. Although they achieved another regional hit, Fuller was not satisfied.

Disengaging from Yucca Records in Alamogordo, which had released his first two records, Fuller and his band began releasing their records through Fuller&#x27;s own various independent labels, with the recordings done in Fuller&#x27;s home recording studio. The group never had a definite name and recordings were credited to either &quot;Bobby Fuller&quot;, or &quot;Bobby Fuller and the Fanatics&quot;. Various additional members played in the band, the most significant being Jim Reese (formerly of the Embers) on guitar, and Dalton Powell (who had played piano for the Embers) on drums.

By 1963, the band pursued a record deal with a major label in Hollywood, California. While they were neglected by most labels, Bob Keane of Del-Fi Records showed particular interest in the group. While he saw potential, he didn&#x27;t think the band had hit material yet. Fuller and his band returned to El Paso and continued to release regional hits, the most popular being &quot;I Fought the Law&quot;, originally by the Crickets. By the end of 1964, Fuller saw branching out to a major label as their only option, thus Bobby Fuller, Randy Fuller, and Jim Reese prepared to move to California to revisit Del-Fi Records. Current drummer Dalton Powell could not make the move due to family commitments, and was replaced by another drummer, DeWayne Quirico, instructed by Fuller in person.

The band appeared as &quot;themselves&quot; in the 1966 film &quot;The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini&quot;—a comedy combining the ubiquitous beach, horror, and biker themes of the day. They back Nancy Sinatra on the song &quot;Geronimo&quot; and perform &quot;Make The Music Pretty&quot; and other incidental music.

==Del-Fi Records==

With the group&#x27;s new hit records, Keane signed them to Del-Fi this time around. The band&#x27;s first Del-Fi release, &quot;Those Memories of You&quot; was under the sister label, Donna Records (credited to Bobby Fuller and the Fanatics). With the band&#x27;s increasing local popularity, Keane created a sister label just for Fuller&#x27;s band, Mustang Records. The first release on Mustang was &quot;Thunder Reef&quot; in 1965. This time, the band was credited as &quot;the Shindigs&quot; to capitalize on the new ABC show, &quot;Shindig!&quot; Seeking a more permanent name, Keane decided upon the Bobby Fuller Four (as he favored Fuller), which was first used on the band&#x27;s next single, &quot;Take My Word&quot;. The new name received mixed reactions with the rest of the group, claiming that it put too much emphasis on Fuller, as opposed to the rest of the band, but the name stuck.

While their next release, &quot;Never to be Forgotten&quot; brought a regional hit, the band&#x27;s next single, &quot;Let Her Dance&quot; brought the band&#x27;s first national hit, barely missing the Billboard Hot 100 at 133, though bringing in a Top 40 hit. At the suggestion of Randy Fuller, the El Paso hit, &quot;I Fought the Law&quot; was re-recorded. It quickly gained national popularity, and by 1966, it rose to its peak position at No. 9 on the national charts. Meanwhile, the band was starting to experience internal troubles after touring, and drummer DeWayne Quirico abruptly left the group. John Barbata was asked to take his place, while negotiations were underway to get Dalton Powell back in the band. While performing at L.A. venue &quot;P.J.&quot; the band produced a memorable performance of &quot;I fought the law&quot; featuring the go-go dancer Lada St. Edmund into the NBC television show Hullaballoo, and also participated in another TV show, Shivaree.

With Powell reinstated, the group went on to release &quot;Love&#x27;s Made a Fool of You&quot;, another Crickets cover (written by Buddy Holly and Bob Montgomery and recorded by Holly as a demo, reportedly intended for the Everly Brothers, though never recorded by that duo). This went on to become another national hit for the band. The next single was taken from the sessions where Barbata sat in, &quot;The Magic Touch&quot;. While being popular locally, it did not match the success of the previous singles. In addition to the already existing internal problems, the band began to fall apart in July after Reese had received a draft notice in the mail (and arranged to sell his Jaguar XKE to Fuller), Powell also planned to announce his plans to leave the band to support his family back home.

==Aftermath==
Bobby Fuller died under mysterious circumstances on July 18, 1966. His body was found beaten inside his car parked just outside of his Hollywood home. Evidence suggests that he had ingested gasoline. Initially, these details were not released to the public. Although many of his friends suspected he might have been murdered by mobsters, Fuller&#x27;s death was officially ruled a suicide by police.

At the death of Fuller, the group disbanded. Their final single, &quot;It&#x27;s Love, Come What May&quot; was only released in limited quantities as a promotional recording. Months later, Keane arranged the formation of the Randy Fuller Four in an attempt to capitalize on the previous success of the Bobby Fuller Four, complete with Randy Fuller on bass and rhythm guitar, DeWayne Quirico returning on drums, and Mike Ciccarelli and Howard Steele (other former El Paso musicians) on lead guitar and bass, respectively. The group released a few singles (including overdubbing the Bobby Fuller Four&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Love, Come What May&quot;), but disbanded less than a year later in 1967 without any chart success.

Most former members of the Bobby Fuller Four remained active in the music industry after the group disbanded. Jim Reese died in 1991 after suffering a fatal heart attack whilst playing a round of golf.

Bobby Fuller has been the subject of two books: &quot;I Fought The Law: The Life and Strange Death of Bobby Fuller&quot; by Miriam Linna &amp; Randell Fuller (2015); and &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Mustangs&quot; by Stephen J. McParland (2009 and with an updated edition released in 2021).

<doc id="164356" wikidata="Q296804" url="?curid=164356" title="Bernard Herrmann">
<text>Bernard Herrmann (born Maximillian Herman; June 29, 1911December 24, 1975) was an American composer and conductor best known for his work in film scoring. As a conductor, he championed the music of lesser-known composers. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest film composers. Alex Ross writes that &quot;Over four decades, he revolutionized movie scoring by abandoning the illustrative musical techniques that dominated Hollywood in the 1930s and imposing his own peculiar harmonic and rhythmic vocabulary.&quot;

An Academy Award-winner for &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; (1941), Herrmann worked in radio drama, composing for Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;The Mercury Theater on the Air&quot;, and his first film score was for Welles&#x27;s film debut, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941). He is known for his collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock, notably &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot; (1956) (where he makes a cameo as the conductor at Royal Albert Hall), &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958), &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959), &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960), &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963) (as &quot;sound consultant&quot;) and &quot;Marnie&quot; (1964) . His other credits include &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1943), &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot; (1946), &quot;The Ghost and Mrs. Muir&quot; (1947), &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951), &quot;Cape Fear&quot; (1962), &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; (1966) and &quot;Twisted Nerve&quot; (1968). Herrmann scored films that were inspired by Hitchcock, like François Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;The Bride Wore Black&quot; (1968) and Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;Sisters&quot; (1972) and &quot;Obsession&quot; (1976). He composed the scores for several fantasy films by Ray Harryhausen, and composed for television, including &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot; and Rod Serling&#x27;s &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. His last score, recorded shortly before his death, was for Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976).

==Early life and career==
Herrmann was born in New York City as Maximillian Herman, the son of a Jewish middle-class family of Russian origin. He was the son of Ida (Gorenstein) and Abram Dardik, who was from Ukraine and had changed the family name. Herrmann attended DeWitt Clinton High School, an all-boys public school at that time on 10th Avenue and 59th Street in New York City. His father encouraged music activity, taking him to the opera, and encouraging him to learn the violin. After winning a composition prize at the age of thirteen, he decided to concentrate on music, and went to New York University, where he studied with Percy Grainger and Philip James. He also studied at the Juilliard School, and at the age of 20, formed his own orchestra, the New Chamber Orchestra of New York.

In 1934, he joined the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) as a staff conductor. Within two years, he was appointed music director of the &quot;Columbia Workshop&quot;, an experimental radio drama series for which Herrmann composed or arranged music (one notable program was &quot;The Fall of the City&quot;). Within nine years, he had become chief conductor to the CBS Symphony Orchestra. He was responsible for introducing more new works to US audiences than any other conductor – he was a particular champion of Charles Ives&#x27; music, which was virtually unknown at that time. Herrmann&#x27;s radio programs of concert music, which were broadcast under such titles as &quot;Invitation to Music&quot; and &quot;Exploring Music&quot;, were planned in an unconventional way and featured rarely heard music, old and new, which was not heard in public concert halls. Examples include broadcasts devoted to music of famous amateurs or of notable royal personages, such as the music of Frederick the Great of Prussia, Henry VIII, Charles I of England, Louis XIII and so on.

Herrmann&#x27;s many US broadcast premieres during the 1940s included Myaskovsky&#x27;s 22nd Symphony, Gian Francesco Malipiero&#x27;s 3rd Symphony, Richard Arnell&#x27;s 1st Symphony, Edmund Rubbra&#x27;s 3rd Symphony and Ives&#x27; 3rd Symphony. He performed the works of Hermann Goetz, Alexander Gretchaninov, Niels Gade and Franz Liszt, and received many outstanding American musical awards and grants for his unusual programming and championship of little-known composers. In &quot;Dictators of the Baton&quot;, David Ewen wrote that Herrmann was &quot;one of the most invigorating influences in the radio music of the past decade.&quot; Also during the 1940s, Herrmann&#x27;s own concert music was taken up and played by such celebrated maestri as Leopold Stokowski, Sir John Barbirolli, Sir Thomas Beecham and Eugene Ormandy.

In 1934, Herrmann met a young CBS secretary and aspiring writer Lucille Fletcher. Fletcher was impressed with Herrmann&#x27;s work, and the two began a five-year courtship. Marriage was delayed by the objections of Fletcher&#x27;s parents, who disliked the fact that Herrmann was a Jew and were put off by what they viewed as his abrasive personality. The couple finally married on October 2, 1939. They had two daughters: Dorothy (born 1941) and Wendy (born 1945).

Fletcher was to become a noted radio scriptwriter, and she and Herrmann collaborated on several projects throughout their career. He contributed the score to the famed 1941 radio presentation of Fletcher&#x27;s original story &quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot; on &quot;The Orson Welles Show&quot;, and Fletcher helped to write the libretto for his operatic adaptation of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. The couple divorced in 1948. The next year, he married Lucille&#x27;s cousin Lucy (Kathy Lucille) Anderson. That marriage lasted until 1964.

==Collaboration with Orson Welles==

While at CBS, Herrmann met Orson Welles, and wrote or arranged scores for radio shows in which Welles appeared or wrote, such as the &quot;Columbia Workshop&quot;, Welles&#x27;s &quot;Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot; and &quot;Campbell Playhouse&quot; series (1938–1940), which were radio adaptations of literature and film. He conducted the live performances, including Welles&#x27;s famous adaptation of H.G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; broadcast on October 30, 1938, which consisted entirely of pre-existing music. Herrmann used large sections of his score for the inaugural broadcast of &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;Rebecca&quot;, for the feature film &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1943), the third film in which Welles starred.

When Welles gained his RKO Pictures contract, Herrmann worked for him. He wrote his first film score for &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941) and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Score of a Dramatic Picture. The aria from the fictional opera &quot;Salammbo&quot;, which Kane&#x27;s wife Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore) performs, was also composed by Herrmann. Welles wanted Herrmann to do a pastiche of real operas, writing in a telegram &quot;Here is a chance for you to do something witty and amusing.&quot; Herrmann composed the score for Welles&#x27;s &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; (1942); like the film, the music was heavily edited by RKO Pictures. When more than half of his score was removed from the soundtrack, Herrmann bitterly severed his ties with the film and promised legal action if his name were not removed from the credits.

Herrmann was music director for Welles&#x27;s CBS radio series &quot;The Orson Welles Show&quot; (1941–1942), which included the debut of his wife Lucille Fletcher&#x27;s suspense classic &quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot;; &quot;Ceiling Unlimited&quot; (1942), a program conceived to glorify the aviation industry and dramatize its role in World War II; and &quot;The Mercury Summer Theatre on the Air&quot; (1946). &quot;Benny Herrmann was an intimate member of the family&quot;, Welles told filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich. Between the films by Welles, he wrote the score for William Dieterle&#x27;s &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; (1941), for which he won his only Academy Award.

Herrmann was among those who rebutted the charges Pauline Kael made in her 1971 essay &quot;Raising Kane&quot;, in which she revived controversy over the authorship of the screenplay for &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and denigrated Welles&#x27;s contributions.

==Collaboration with Alfred Hitchcock==

Herrmann is closely associated with the director Alfred Hitchcock. He wrote the scores for seven Hitchcock films, from &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot; (1955) to &quot;Marnie&quot; (1964), a period that included &quot;Vertigo&quot;, &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, and &quot;Psycho&quot;. He was also credited as sound consultant on &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963), as there was no actual music in the film as such, only electronically made bird sounds.

The film score for the remake of &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot; (1956) was composed by Herrmann, but two of the more significant pieces of music in the film – the song &quot;Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)&quot; and the &quot;Storm Clouds Cantata&quot; played in the Royal Albert Hall – are not by Herrmann (although he did re-orchestrate the cantata by Australian-born composer Arthur Benjamin written for the earlier Hitchcock film of the same name). However, this film did give Herrmann the opportunity for an on-screen appearance: he is the conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra in the Albert Hall scene. Herrmann&#x27;s score for Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Wrong Man&quot; (1956) is in a jazz style and makes heavy use of bass; Emmanuel Balestrero (Henry Fonda), the wrong man of the title, is a jazz bassist.

Herrmann&#x27;s most recognizable music is from Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot;. Unusual for a thriller at the time, the score uses only the string section of the orchestra. The screeching violin heard during the famous shower scene (which Hitchcock originally suggested have no music at all) is one of the most famous moments in film score history. Hitchcock admitted at the time that &quot;Psycho&quot; heavily depended on the music for its tension and sense of pervading doom. David Thomson notes Herrmann&#x27;s &quot;sly borrowings from Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Eroica&quot;&quot;, a recording of which can be seen in the bedroom of Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Herrmann&#x27;s score also had a direct influence on producer George Martin&#x27;s staccato string arrangement for the Beatles&#x27; 1966 single &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;.

His score for &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958) is seen as just as masterly. In many of the key scenes, Hitchcock let Herrmann&#x27;s score take centre stage, a score whose melodies, echoing the &quot;Liebestod&quot; from Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, dramatically convey the main character&#x27;s obsessive love for the image of a woman and underscores that &quot;Vertigo&quot;, like &quot;Tristan&quot;, is a story of love and death. Ross writes that Herrmann&#x27;s homage &quot;is a matter of deliberation and subtlety. The main melodic contour is his own; the harmony is still his idiosyncratic construction. He is jogging the memory of those who know &quot;Tristan&quot; and the subconscious of those who don&#x27;t. His veiled citations indicate in their own way the unstoppable recurrence of the past.&quot;

A notable feature of the &quot;Vertigo&quot; score is the ominous two-note falling motif that opens the suite – it is a direct musical imitation of the two notes sounded by the fog horns located at either side of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco (as heard from the San Francisco side of the bridge). This motif has direct relevance to the film because the horns can be clearly heard sounding in just this manner at Fort Point, the spot where a key incident occurs involving the character played by Kim Novak.

However, according to Dan Auiler, author of &quot;Vertigo: The Making of a Hitchcock Classic&quot;, Herrmann deeply regretted being unable to conduct his composition for &quot;Vertigo&quot;. A musicians&#x27; strike in America meant that it was actually conducted in England and in Austria by Muir Mathieson. Herrmann always personally conducted his own works and given that he considered the composition among his best works, he regarded it as a missed opportunity.

In a question-and-answer session at George Eastman House in October 1973, Herrmann stated that, unlike most film composers who did not have any creative input into the style and tone of the score, he insisted on creative control as a condition of accepting a scoring assignment:

Herrmann stated that Hitchcock would invite him on to the production of a film and, depending on his decision about the length of the music, either expand or contract the scene. It was Hitchcock who asked Herrmann for the &quot;recognition scene&quot; near the end of &quot;Vertigo&quot; (the scene in which James Stewart&#x27;s character suddenly realizes Kim Novak&#x27;s identity) to be played with music.

In 1963, Herrmann began writing original music for the CBS-TV anthology series &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;, which was in its eighth season. Hitchcock served only as advisor on the show, which he hosted, but Herrmann was again working with former Mercury Theatre actor Norman Lloyd, co-producer (with Joan Harrison) of the series. Herrmann scored 17 episodes (1963–1965), and like much of his work for CBS, the music frequently was reused for other programs.

Herrmann&#x27;s relationship with Hitchcock came to an abrupt end when they disagreed over the score for &quot;Torn Curtain&quot;. Reportedly pressured by Universal executives, Hitchcock wanted a score that was more jazz- and pop-influenced. Hitchcock&#x27;s biographer Patrick McGilligan stated that Hitchcock was worried about becoming old-fashioned and felt that Herrmann&#x27;s music had to change with the times as well. Herrmann initially accepted the offer, but then decided to score the film according to his own ideas. François Truffaut writes that &quot;in 1966, In Hollywood and elsewhere, it was the practice of the film industry to favor scores that would sell as popular records—the kind of film music that could be danced to in discotheques. In this sort of game, Herrmann, a disciple of Wagner and Stravinsky, was bound to be a loser.&quot; Truffaut writes that &quot;Herrmann&#x27;s removal is a flagrant injustice, since it is a matter of record that his contributions to &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;, &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, and &quot;Psycho&quot; had greatly enhanced the success of these films.&quot;

Hitchcock listened to only the prelude of the score, then confronted Herrmann about the pop score. Herrmann, equally incensed, bellowed &quot;Look, Hitch, you can&#x27;t outjump your own shadow. And you don&#x27;t make pop pictures. What do you want with me? I don&#x27;t write pop music.&quot; Hitchcock unrelentingly insisted that Herrmann change the score, violating Herrmann&#x27;s general claim to the creative control he had always maintained in their previous works together. Herrmann then said &quot;Hitch, what&#x27;s the use of my doing more with you? I had a career before you, and I will afterwards.&quot; The score was rejected and replaced with one by John Addison.

According to McGilligan, Herrmann later tried to reconcile with Hitchcock, but Hitchcock refused to see him. Herrmann&#x27;s widow Norma Herrmann disputed this in a conversation with Günther Kögebehn for the Bernard Herrmann Society in 2004:

In 2009, Norma Herrmann began to auction her husband&#x27;s personal collection on Bonhams.com, adding more interesting details to the two men&#x27;s relationship. While Herrmann had brought Hitchcock a copy of his classical work after the break-up, Hitchcock had given Herrmann a copy of his 1967 interview book with François Truffaut, which he inscribed &quot;To Benny with my fondest wishes, Hitch.&quot;

&quot;This is rather interesting because it comes a year after Hitchcock had abruptly fired Herrmann from his work scoring &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; and indicates Hitchcock may have hoped to mend fences with Herrmann and have him score his next film, &quot;Topaz&quot;,&quot; reported Wellesnet, the Orson Welles website, in April 2009:

Herrmann&#x27;s unused score for &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; was commercially recorded after his death, initially by Elmer Bernstein for his Film Music Collection subscription record label (reissued by Warner Bros. Records), then in a fuller realization of the original score by Joel McNeely and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and later, in a concert suite adapted by Christopher Palmer, by Esa-Pekka Salonen and the Los Angeles Philharmonic for Sony. Some of Herrmann&#x27;s cues for &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; were post-synched to the final cut, where they showed how remarkably attuned the composer was to the action, and how, arguably, more effective his score could have been.

==Later life and death==

From the late 1950s to the mid-1960s, Herrmann scored a series of notable mythically themed fantasy films, including &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; and the Ray Harryhausen Dynamation epics &quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot;, &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot;, &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; and &quot;The 3 Worlds of Gulliver&quot;.

During the same period, Herrmann turned his talents to writing scores for television shows. He wrote the scores for several well-known episodes of the original &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; series, including the lesser known theme used during the series&#x27; first season, as well as the opening theme to &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;.

In the mid-1960s, he composed the highly regarded music score for François Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;. Scored for strings, two harps, vibraphone, xylophone and glockenspiel, Herrmann&#x27;s score created a driving, neurotic mood that perfectly suited the film.

By 1967, Herrmann worked almost exclusively in England. In November 1967, the 56-year-old composer married 27-year-old journalist Norma Shepherd, his third wife. In August 1971, the Herrmanns made London their permanent home.

Herrmann&#x27;s last film scores included &quot;Sisters&quot; and &quot;Obsession&quot; for Brian De Palma. His final film soundtrack, and the last work he completed, was his sombre score for &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976), directed by Martin Scorsese. It was De Palma who had suggested to Scorsese to use the composer. Immediately after finishing the recording of the &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; soundtrack on December 23, 1975, Herrmann viewed the rough cut of what was to be his next film assignment, Larry Cohen&#x27;s &quot;God Told Me To&quot;, and dined with Cohen. He returned to his hotel, and died from an apparent heart attack in his sleep the next day. Scorsese and Cohen both dedicated their respective films in his memory. Herrmann was interred in Beth David Cemetery at Elmont, New York.

==Other works==
As well as his many film scores, Herrmann wrote several concert pieces, including his Symphony in 1941; the opera &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;; the cantata &quot;Moby Dick&quot; (1938), dedicated to Charles Ives; and &quot;For the Fallen&quot;, a tribute to the soldiers who died in battle in World War II. He recorded all these compositions, and several others, for the Unicorn label during his last years in London. A work written late in his life, &quot;Souvenir de Voyages&quot;, showed his ability to write non-programmatic pieces.

==Compositional style and philosophy==
Herrmann&#x27;s music is typified by frequent use of ostinati (short repeating patterns), novel orchestration, and, in his film scores, an ability to portray character traits not altogether obvious from other elements of the film.

Early in his life, Herrmann committed himself to a creed of personal integrity at the price of unpopularity: the quintessential artist. His philosophy is summarized by a favorite Tolstoy quote: &quot;Eagles fly alone, and sparrows fly in flocks.&quot; Thus, Herrmann only composed music for films when he was allowed the artistic liberty to compose what he wished without the director getting in the way. This was the cause of the split with Hitchcock after over a decade of composing scores for the director&#x27;s films.

His philosophy of orchestrating film was based on the assumption that the musicians were selected and hired for the recording session – that this music was not constrained to the musical forces of the concert hall. For example, his use of nine harps in &quot;Beneath the 12-Mile Reef&quot; created an extraordinary underwater-like sonic landscape; his use of four alto flutes in &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; contributed to the unsettling quality of the opening, only matched by the use of 12 flutes in his unused &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; score; and his use of the serpent in &quot;White Witch Doctor&quot; is possibly the first use of that instrument in a film score.

Herrmann said: &quot;To orchestrate is like a thumbprint. I can&#x27;t understand having someone else do it. It would be like someone putting color to your paintings.&quot;

Herrmann subscribed to the belief that the best film music should be able to stand on its own legs when detached from the film for which it was originally written. To this end, he made several well-known recordings for Decca of arrangements of his own film music as well as music of other prominent composers.

===Use of electronic instruments===
Herrmann&#x27;s involvement with electronic musical instruments dates back to 1951, when he used the theremin in &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;. Robert B. Sexton has noted that this score involved the use of treble and bass theremins (played by Dr. Samuel Hoffmann and Paul Shure), electric strings, bass, prepared piano, and guitar together with various pianos and harps, electronic organs, brass, and percussion, and that Herrmann treated the theremins as a truly orchestral section.

Herrmann was a sound consultant on &quot;The Birds&quot;, which made extensive use of an electronic instrument called the mixturtrautonium, performed by Oskar Sala on the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Herrmann used several electronic instruments on his score of &quot;It&#x27;s Alive&quot;, as well as the Moog synthesizer for the main themes in &quot;Endless Night&quot; and &quot;Sisters&quot;.

==Legacy and recording==
Herrmann is still a prominent figure in the world of film music today, despite his death in 1975. As such, his career has been studied extensively by biographers and documentarians. His string-only score for &quot;Psycho&quot;, for example, set the standard when it became a new way to write music for thrillers (rather than big fully orchestrated pieces). In 1992, the documentary &quot;Music for the Movies: Bernard Herrmann&quot; was made about him. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. Also in 1988, Bruce Crawford produced a -hour-long National Public Radio documentary on his life – &quot;Bernard Herrmann: A Celebration of His Life and Music&quot;. In 1991, Steven C. Smith wrote a Herrmann biography titled &quot;A Heart at Fire&#x27;s Center&quot;, a quote from a favorite Stephen Spender poem of Herrmann.

His music continues to be used in films and recordings after his death. On the 1977 album &quot;Ra,&quot; American progressive rock group Utopia adapted Herrmann&#x27;s &quot;Mountain Top/Sunrise&quot; from &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; in a rock arrangement, as the introduction to the album&#x27;s opening song, &quot;Communion With The Sun&quot;. The 1990s saw two iconic Herrmann scores adapted for remakes: celebrated composer Elmer Bernstein adapted and expanded Herrmann&#x27;s music for Martin Scorsese&#x27;s update of &quot;Cape Fear,&quot; expanding the score to include music from Herrmann&#x27;s rejected score to &quot;Torn Curtain&quot;, and similarly, though more faithful to the original material, film composer Danny Elfman and orchestrator Steve Bartek adapted Herrmann&#x27;s full &quot;Psycho&quot; score for director Gus Van Sant&#x27;s shot-for-shot remake. &quot;Georgie&#x27;s Theme&quot; from Herrmann&#x27;s score for the 1968 film &quot;Twisted Nerve&quot; is whistled by assassin Elle Driver in the hospital corridor scene in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot; (2003). 2011 saw several uses of Herrmann&#x27;s music from &quot;Vertigo:&quot; the opening theme was used in the prologue to Lady Gaga&#x27;s video for &quot;Born This Way&quot; and during a flashback sequence in the pilot episode of FX&#x27;s &quot;American Horror Story&quot; (which featured &quot;Georgie&#x27;s Theme&quot; in later episodes as a recurring musical motif for the character of Tate), and Ludovic Bource used the love theme in the last reels of &quot;The Artist&quot;. &quot;Vertigo&quot; opening sequence was also copied for the opening sequence of the 1993 miniseries, &quot;Tales Of The City&quot;, an adaptation of the first in a series of books by Armistead Maupin. More recently, the first and fourth episodes of Amazon Prime&#x27;s 2018 streaming series &quot;Homecoming&quot; used cues from Herrmann&#x27;s &quot;Vertigo&quot; and &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; respectively.

Herrmann&#x27;s film music is well represented on disc. His friend, John Steven Lasher, has produced several albums featuring Urtext recordings, including &quot;Battle of Neretva,&quot; &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; &quot;The Kentuckian,&quot; &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons,&quot; &quot;The Night Digger&quot; and &quot;Sisters,&quot; under various labels owned by Fifth Continent Australia Pty Ltd.

Herrmann was an early and enthusiastic proponent of the music of Charles Ives. He met Ives in the early 1930s, performed many of his works while conductor of the CBS Symphony Orchestra, and conducted Ives&#x27; Second Symphony with the London Symphony Orchestra on his first visit to London in 1956. Herrmann later made a recording of the work in 1972 and this reunion with the LSO, after more than a decade, was significant to him for several reasons – he had long hoped to record his own interpretation of the symphony, feeling that Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s 1951 version was &quot;overblown and inaccurate&quot;; on a personal level, it also served to assuage Herrmann&#x27;s long-held feeling that he had been snubbed by the orchestra after his first visit in 1956. The notoriously prickly composer had also been enraged by the recent appointment of the LSO&#x27;s new chief conductor André Previn, who Herrmann detested, and deprecatingly referred to as &quot;that jazz boy&quot;.

Herrmann was also an ardent champion of the romantic-era composer Joachim Raff, whose music had fallen into near-oblivion by the 1960s. During the 1940s, Herrmann had played Raff&#x27;s 3rd and 5th Symphonies in his CBS radio broadcasts. In May 1970, Herrmann conducted the world premiere recording of Raff&#x27;s Fifth Symphony &quot;Lenore&quot; for the Unicorn label, which he mainly financed himself. The recording did not attract much notice in its time, despite receiving excellent reviews, but is now considered a major turning-point in the rehabilitation of Raff as a composer.

In 1996, Sony Classical released &quot;The Film Scores,&quot; a recording of Herrmann&#x27;s music performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonen. This disc received the 1998 Cannes Classical Music Award for Best 20th-Century Orchestral Recording. It was also nominated for the 1998 Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Classical.

Decca reissued on CD a series of Phase 4 Stereo recordings with Herrmann conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra, mostly in excerpts from his various film scores, including one devoted to music from several of the Hitchcock films (including &quot;Psycho&quot;, &quot;Marnie&quot; and &quot;Vertigo&quot;). In the liner notes of the Hitchcock Phase 4 album, Herrmann said that the suite from &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot; was a &quot;portrait of Hitch&quot;. Another album was devoted to his fantasy film scores – a few of them being the films of the special effects animator Ray Harryhausen, including music from &quot;The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad&quot; and &quot;The Three Worlds of Gulliver.&quot; His other Phase 4 Stereo LPs of the 1970s included &quot;Music from the Great Film Classics&quot; (suites and excerpts from &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, &quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot;, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot;); and &quot;The Fantasy World of Bernard Herrmann&quot; (&quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;, &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;, and &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;.)

Charles Gerhardt conducted a 1974 RCA recording titled &quot;The Classic Film Scores of Bernard Herrmann&quot; with the National Philharmonic Orchestra. It featured suites from &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (with Kiri Te Kanawa singing Salammbo&#x27;s Aria) and &quot;White Witch Doctor&quot;, along with music from &quot;On Dangerous Ground&quot;, &quot;Beneath the 12-Mile Reef&quot;, and the &quot;Hangover Square&quot; piano concerto.

During his last years in England, between 1966 and 1975, Herrmann made several LPs of other composers&#x27; music for assorted record labels. These included Phase 4 Stereo recordings of Gustav Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot; and Charles Ives&#x27;s 2nd Symphony, as well as an album titled &quot;The Impressionists&quot; (music by Satie, Debussy, Ravel, Fauré and Honegger) and another titled &quot;The Four Faces of Jazz&quot; (works by Weill, Gershwin, Stravinsky and Milhaud). As well as recording his own film music in Phase 4 Stereo, he made LPs of movie scores by others, such as &quot;Great Shakespearean Films&quot; (music by Shostakovich for &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Walton for &quot;Richard III&quot; and Rózsa for &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;), and &quot;Great British Film Music&quot; (movie scores by Lambert, Bax, Benjamin, Walton, Vaughan Williams, and Bliss).

For Unicorn Records, he recorded several of his own concert-hall works, including the cantata &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, his opera &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, his symphony, and the suites &quot;Welles Raises Kane&quot; and &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot;.

Pristine Audio released two CDs of Herrmann&#x27;s radio broadcasts. One is devoted to a CBS program from 1945 that features music by Handel, Vaughan Williams and Elgar; the other features works by Charles Ives, Robert Russell Bennett and Herrmann.

===Influences and legacy===
The works of Herrmann are widely studied, imitated and performed to this very day. His work has left a profound influence on composers of film music that followed him, the most notable being John Williams, Elmer Bernstein, Jerry Goldsmith, Howard Shore, Lalo Schifrin, James Horner, Carter Burwell and others. Stephen Sondheim found Herrmann to be a primary influence after seeing the film &quot;Hangover Square&quot;.

Popular film composer Danny Elfman counts Herrmann as his biggest influence, and has said hearing Herrmann&#x27;s score to &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; when he was a child was the first time he realized the powerful contribution a composer makes to the movies. Pastiche of Herrmann&#x27;s music can be heard in Elfman&#x27;s score for &quot;Pee-Wee&#x27;s Big Adventure,&quot; specifically in the cues &quot;Stolen Bike&quot; and &quot;Clown Dream&quot;, which reference Herrmann&#x27;s &quot;The Murder&quot; from &quot;Psycho&quot; and &quot;The Duel With the Skeleton&quot; from &quot;7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot; respectively. The prelude for Elfman&#x27;s main &quot;Batman&quot; theme references Herrmann&#x27;s &quot;Mountain Top / Sunrise&quot; from &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;, and the Joker character&#x27;s &quot;fate motif&quot; heard throughout the score is inspired by Herrmann&#x27;s &quot;Vertigo.&quot; More integral homage can be heard in Elfman&#x27;s later scores for &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; and &quot;Hitchcock,&quot; the latter based on Hitchcock&#x27;s creation of &quot;Psycho,&quot; as well as the &quot;Blue Strings&quot; movement of Elfman&#x27;s first concert work &quot;Serenada Schizophrana&quot;.

In addition to Elfman, fellow film composers Richard Band, Graeme Revell, Christopher Young, Alexandre Desplat and Brian Tyler consider Herrmann to be a major inspiration. In 1985, Richard Band&#x27;s opening theme to &quot;Re-Animator&quot; borrows heavily from Herrmann&#x27;s opening score to &quot;Psycho&quot;. In 1990, Graeme Revell had adapted Herrmann&#x27;s music from &quot;Psycho&quot; for its television sequel-prequel &quot;Psycho IV: The Beginning&quot;. Revell&#x27;s early orchestral music during the early nineties, such as &quot;Child&#x27;s Play 2&quot; (which its music score being reminiscent of Herrmann&#x27;s scores to the 1973 film &quot;Sisters&quot;, due to the synthesizers incorporated in the chilling parts of the orchestral score) as well as the 1963 &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;Living Doll&quot; (which inspired the &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; franchise), were very similar to Herrmann&#x27;s work. Also, Revell&#x27;s score for the video game &quot;Call of Duty 2&quot; was reminiscent of Herrmann&#x27;s rare WWII music scores such as &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; and &quot;Battle of Neretva&quot;. Young, who was a jazz drummer at first, listened to Herrmann&#x27;s works which convinced him to be a film composer. Tyler&#x27;s score for Bill Paxton&#x27;s film &quot;Frailty&quot; was influenced by Herrmann&#x27;s film music.

Sir George Martin, best known for producing and often adding orchestration to the Beatles music, cites Herrmann as an influence in his own work, particularly in Martin&#x27;s scoring of the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;. Martin later expanded on this as an extended suite for McCartney&#x27;s 1984 film &quot;Give My Regards to Broad Street&quot;, which features a very recognizable homage to Herrmann&#x27;s score for &quot;Psycho&quot;.

Avant-garde composer/saxophonist/producer John Zorn, in the biographical film &quot;A Bookshelf on Top of the Sky&quot;, cited Bernard Herrmann as one of his favorite composers and a major influence.

In addition to adapting and expanding the original score from &quot;Cape Fear&quot; for the Martin Scorsese remake, Elmer Bernstein recorded Herrmann&#x27;s score for &quot;The Ghost and Mrs. Muir&quot;, released in 1975 on the Varèse Sarabande label and later reissued on CD in the 1990s.

David Thomson calls him the greatest film composer, writing: &quot;Herrmann knew how lovely the dark should be, and he was at his best in rites of dismay, dark dreams, introspection, and the gloomy romance of loneliness. No one else would have dared or known to make the score for &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; such a lament for impossible love... Yet the score for &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; is universally cinematic: it speaks to sitting in the dark, full of dread and desire, watching.&quot;

==Radio scores==

===Melodrams===
These works are for narrator and full orchestra, intended to be broadcast over the radio (since a human voice would not be able to be heard over the full volume of an orchestra). In a 1938 broadcast of the &quot;Columbia Workshop&quot;, Herrmann distinguished &quot;melodrama&quot; from &quot;melodram&quot; and explained that these works are not part of the former, but the latter. The 1935 works were composed before June 1935.

<text>MacPaint is a raster graphics editor developed by Apple Computer and released with the original Macintosh personal computer on January 24, 1984. It was sold separately for US$195 with its word processing counterpart, MacWrite. MacPaint was notable because it could generate graphics that could be used by other applications. It taught consumers what a graphics-based system could do by using the mouse, the clipboard, and QuickDraw picture language. Pictures could be cut from MacPaint and pasted into MacWrite documents.

The original MacPaint was developed by Bill Atkinson, a member of Apple&#x27;s original Macintosh development team. Early development versions of MacPaint were called MacSketch, still retaining part of the name of its roots, LisaSketch. It was later developed by Claris, the software subsidiary of Apple which was formed in 1987. The last version of MacPaint was version 2.0, released in 1988. It was discontinued by Claris in 1998 because of diminishing sales.

== Development ==
MacPaint was written by Bill Atkinson, a member of Apple&#x27;s original Macintosh development team. The original MacPaint program consisted of 5,804 lines of Pascal computer code, augmented by another 2,738 lines of 68000 assembly language. MacPaint&#x27;s user interface was designed by Susan Kare, also a member of the Macintosh team. Kare also beta-tested MacPaint before release.

MacPaint allows users to edit a 576-by-720 pixel, 72-dpi bitmap (slightly wider than the screen, and slightly more than twice as tall as the screen). A occupies most of the screen real estate, offering a viewport into a portion of the bitmap, with toolbars and pattern palettes around it.

MacPaint uses two offscreen memory buffers to avoid flicker when dragging shapes or images across the screen. One of these buffers contained the existing pixels of a document, and the other contained the pixels of its previous state. The second buffer was used as the basis of the software&#x27;s undo feature. In April 1983, the software&#x27;s name was changed from MacSketch to MacPaint. The original MacPaint was programmed as a single-document interface. The palette positions and sizes were unalterable, as was the document window. This differed from other Macintosh software at the time, which allowed users to move windows and resize them.

=== FatBits ===
The original MacPaint did incorporate a double zoom function. Instead of a zoom function, a special magnification mode called FatBits was used. FatBits showed each pixel as a clickable rectangle with a white border. The FatBits editing mode set the standard for many future editors. MacPaint included a &quot;Goodies&quot; menu which included the FatBits tool. This menu had been named the &quot;Aids&quot; menu in prerelease versions, but was renamed &quot;Goodies&quot; as public awareness of the AIDS epidemic grew in the summer of 1983.

== Release and version history ==
MacPaint was first advertised in an 18-page brochure in December 1983, following the earlier announcement of the Macintosh 128K. The Macintosh was released on January 24, 1984, with two applications, MacPaint and MacWrite. For a special post-election edition of &quot;Newsweek&quot; in November 1984, Apple spent more than US$2.5 million to buy all 39 of the advertising pages in the issue. The Newsweek advertisement included many pages dedicated to explaining how MacWrite and MacPaint worked together. After launch, a &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer noted how MacPaint unfolded numerous graphic possibilities for the personal computer; he went further to say &quot;it is better than anything else of its kind offered on personal computers by a factor of 10.&quot;
MacPaint 2.0 was released on January 11, 1988, by Claris. It added many improvements to the software, including the capability to open and use up to nine documents simultaneously. The original MacPaint operated as a single-document application with an immovable window. MacPaint 2.0 eliminated this limitation, introducing a fully functioning document window, which could be sized up to 8 x 10&quot;. Several other features were introduced, such as a Zoom tool, MagicEraser tool for undo actions and stationary documents. MacPaint 2.0 was developed by David Ramsey, a developer at Claris. MacPaint 2.0 was sold for US$125, with a US$25 upgrade available for existing users of MacPaint. Claris discontinued technical support for the original MacPaint in 1989. Claris stopped selling MacPaint in early 1998 because of diminishing sales. There has been an unofficial update called MacPaint X which is 3.0 beta, mainly for people who wished to be able to use the program.

Since 2010, MacPaint 1.3&#x27;s source code (written in a combination of Assembly and Pascal) has been available through the Computer History Museum, along with the QuickDraw source code, a library to draw bitmapped graphics, due to the support of Steve Jobs.

MacPaint inspired other companies to release similar products for other platforms; within a year a half-dozen clones existed for the Apple II and IBM PC. Some of these included Broderbund&#x27;s Dazzle Draw for the Apple II, Mouse Systems&#x27; PCPaint for the PC, and IBM&#x27;s Color Paint for the IBM PCjr.

<text>The Buddy Holly Story is a 1978 American biographical musical drama film directed by Steve Rash which tells the life and career of rock and roll musician Buddy Holly. It features an Academy Award-winning musical score, adapted by Joe Renzetti and Oscar-nominated lead performance by Gary Busey. The film also stars Don Stroud, Charles Martin Smith, Conrad Janis, William Jordan, and Maria Richwine, who plays María Elena Holly.

It was adapted by Robert Gittler from &quot;Buddy Holly: His Life and Music&quot;, the 1975 biography of Holly by John Goldrosen, and was directed by Steve Rash.

==Plot==
In 1956, Buddy Holly and his friends, drummer Jesse Charles and bass player Ray Bob Simmons, regularly performed at a local roller rink in Lubbock, Texas, as The Crickets. A local radio station broadcasts the show. Holly plays a country song, then switches to a rock and roll song, exciting the teens much to the annoyance of the radio station&#x27;s sponsor. Station manager Riley tells Holly that Coral Records vice president wants the band to make a recording in Nashville, Tennessee.

At the recording studio, Holly walks out when his rock-and-roll vision clashes with the producers, who want The Crickets to play country music. Later, Riley says he sent a tape of the Cricket&#x27;s roller rink performance to New York City music producer Ross Turner. Believing the demo tape is a master copy, Turner releases it without realizing the band has no contract. The record is a hit and Holly can now pursue music full time. In New York City, the Crickets meet with Turner; after initial resistance, he agrees that Holly can make music how he wants.

Sol Gittler books the Crickets for the famous Apollo Theater in Harlem, assuming they are a black band. He is stunned when three white Texans show up and he refuses to let them perform, fearing the audience&#x27;s reaction. Holly points out that Gittler&#x27;s telegram specifies that they only have to be in New York City for a week to be paid $1,000, so Gittler nervously allows them to perform, the first white act to perform at the Apollo. After an uncomfortable start, Holly&#x27;s music soon wins over the audience and the Crickets are a hit. Turner&#x27;s secretary, Maria Elena Santiago, catches Holly&#x27;s eye but their budding romance is nearly ended when her strict aunt refuses to allow them to date. Holly convinces her to change her mind and on their first date, Holly proposes to Maria. She accepts and they are soon married.

After two years of success, Ray Bob and Jesse, feeling overshadowed by Holly and wanting to return to Texas, decide to quit while Holly believes it is necessary to remain in New York to stay popular. After appearing on CBS TV on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, Jesse and Ray Bob return to Lubbock with the agreement that they will retain the Crickets name. Though saddened by their departure, Holly carries on writing. He initially fears performing without them despite his manager emphasizing that touring is necessary to chart success. Holly is delighted when Maria becomes pregnant, though she sees he is frustrated professionally and urges him to go on tour.

On February 2, 1959, preparing for a concert at Clear Lake, Iowa, Holly charters a private plane to fly to Moorhead, Minnesota for the next concert after the tour bus has broken down. The Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens join him on the flight. The Crickets, feeling nostalgic and wanting to revive the band, plan to join Holly at his next tour stop. After playing his final song, &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, Holly bids the crowd farewell. A caption reveals that Holly, Valens and the Bopper died in a plane crash that night &quot;... and the rest is Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot;.

==Cast==
==Production==
The actors did their own singing and played their own instruments, with guitarist Jerry Zaremba overdubbing the guitar parts. Busey, in particular, was noted for recording the soundtrack music live and for losing a considerable amount of weight in order to portray the skinny Holly. According to Busey&#x27;s biography, he lost 32 pounds to look more like Holly, who weighed 146 pounds at the time of his death.

The actor&#x27;s accurate portrayal was aided by knowledge gained from a previous attempt to film part of the Holly life story, the ill-fated &quot;Three-Sided Coin&quot;, in which he played Crickets drummer Jerry Allison. The film was cancelled by 20th Century Fox due to pressure from Fred Bauer and his company, who had made deals with the Holly estate. The screenplay of &quot;Three-Sided Coin&quot; (by Allison and Tom Drake) revealed many personal details about Holly, and Busey picked up more during off-set conversations with Allison.

While the story follows Buddy Holly from age 20 to 22 (1956 to February 1959), Busey was 33 when he played the role. Charles Martin Smith auditioned for the role of Buddy, but since Busey already had been cast, the producers cast Smith to play Ray Bob Simmons because they liked his audition. Simmons and Jesse Charles were character names used in place of Joe B. Mauldin and Jerry Allison, two of the actual Crickets (1956 to early 1958 Cricket Niki Sullivan, performing on 27 of the 32 songs Holly recorded, is not shown).

The incident in which a Buffalo disc jockey locked himself in a studio and repeatedly played the same song over and over was loosely based on real-life stunts orchestrated by disc jockey Tom Clay (and repeated a few years later by Danny Neaverth), who held up Buffalo&#x27;s Shelton Square by playing Bill Haley &amp; His Comets&#x27; &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; repeatedly from the top of a billboard, and by Joey Reynolds, who locked himself in a studio playing &quot;Sherry&quot; by The Four Seasons for several hours; those incidents, however, had no relation to Buddy Holly or his music.

==Release==
The film had a special premiere in nine different Texas and Oklahoma cities on May 18, 1978, including Holly&#x27;s hometown of Lubbock and Busey&#x27;s hometown of Tulsa, before opening in Los Angeles on June 14.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film earned $14.3 million on a $1.2 million budget.

===Critical response===
Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars out of four and praised Busey&#x27;s &quot;remarkable performance as Buddy Holly. If you&#x27;re a fan of Holly and his music, you&#x27;ll be quietly amazed at how completely Busey gets into the character.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;There are a lot of actors in &#x27;The Buddy Holly Story&#x27; — some of them very nice — but the movie is really a one-man show. It&#x27;s Gary Busey&#x27;s galvanizing solo performance that gives meaning to an otherwise shapeless and bland feature-length film about the American rock-and-roll star who was killed in a plane crash in 1959.&quot; Gene Siskel gave the film four stars out of four and wrote, &quot;In a year in which we are inundated with films featuring rock music, &#x27;The Buddy Holly Story&#x27; probably will turn out to be the best. That is because of Busey&#x27;s galvanizing performance.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The heart and soul and power of &#x27;The Buddy Holly Story&#x27; is the uncanny, marrow-deep, robust, exhilarating, likable, superlative, overwhelmingly convincing portrayal by Gary Busey ... For once there is no lip-synching to someone else&#x27;s voice, no feigning with the fingers to somebody else&#x27;s strumming. Busey does it all himself, and it is one of those rare and stunning performances in which the person of the actor himself is totally lost to sight in his creation of someone else.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;Gary Busey invests the title role with a personal charm so original and an emotional dedication so exhilarating that he seems to lift the material off its somewhat pedestrian feet.&quot;

&quot;The Buddy Holly Story&quot; holds a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.3/10. &quot;The New York Times&quot; placed the film on its &quot;Best 1000 Movies Ever&quot; list.

Peggy Sue Gerrow Allison Rackham, to whom the song &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; was written, called the film &quot;typical Hollywood, gobbledygook fantasy&quot;. Ex-Beatle Paul McCartney wasn&#x27;t positive about the film either. Being interviewed and involved in the production of director Richard Spence&#x27;s documentary &#x27;The Real Story of Buddy Holly&#x27;, McCartney decided after seeing the film to make a more accurate account of what happened. In a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, executive producer Ed Cohen, director Steve Rash and producer Freddy Bauer defended inaccuracies in the movie, pointing out the budget of the movie was only two million dollars. &quot;Whatever we put up there on the screen will be the truth&quot;, commented Bauer. &quot;Ask moviegoers who invented the telephone. They&#x27;ll tell you that Don Ameche did.&quot; According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the three major complaints concerned the portrayal of Holly&#x27;s family, the treatment of the Crickets and the omission of Norman Petty, Holly&#x27;s producer.

===Awards===
The film won the Academy Award for Best Adaptation Score by Joe Renzetti. Busey was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and Tex Rudloff, Joel Fein, Curly Thirlwell and Willie D. Burton for Best Sound.

<text>Chicano rock, also called &quot;chicano fusion&quot;, is rock music performed by Mexican American (Chicano) groups or music with themes derived from Chicano culture. Chicano Rock, to a great extent, does not refer to any single style or approach. Some of these groups do not sing in Spanish at all, or use many specific Latin instruments or sounds. The subgenre is defined by the ethnicity of its performers, and as a result covers a wide range of approaches.

==Overview==
There are three basic styles of Chicano rock.
1) The earliest Chicano rock emerged as a distinctive style of rock and roll performed by Mexican Americans from East Los Angeles and Southern California, containing themes from their cultural experience. Although the genre is broad and diverse, encompassing a variety of styles and subjects, the overarching theme of early Chicano rock is its rhythm and blues influence and incorporation of brass instruments like the saxophone and trumpet, Farfisa or Hammond B3 organ, funky basslines, and its blending of Mexican vocal styling sung in English.

A tradition of 60s Chicano rock emerges from these origins, following a devotion to the original rhythm and blues, rockabilly and Rock and roll. And Ritchie Valens, Sunny &amp; the Sunglows, The Sir Douglas Quintet, Cannibal &amp; the Headhunters, The Premiers, Sam the Sham &amp; the Pharaohs and Thee Midniters, all have made music that is heavily based on 1950s R&amp;B, even when general trends moved away from the original sound of rock as time went by.

2) The second style of 70s Chicano rock is more open to blues music, soul music, R&amp;B, rock music, funk, Latin music, salsa music, and jazz. Santana, Malo, War, El Chicano, Sapo and other Chicano &#x27;Latin Rock&#x27; groups follow this approach with their fusions of R&amp;B, Jazz, and Caribbean sounds.
Later Chicano musicians who draw from rockabilly and country include Linda Ronstadt and Los Lobos. These musicians also sometimes draw from traditions of Norteño music or Tejano music.

3) A third style is the 80s Latin rock, Latin R&amp;B by Tierra, Little Joe, Little Willie G, Ralfi Pagan, Sheila E, Sugar Style, Sunny and the Sunliners and Rocky Padilla.

==History==

In places such as San Antonio, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay area, and Dallas and Houston, Texas, the African-American audience was very important to aspiring Latino musicians, and this kept their music wedded to authentic R&amp;B. DJ Dick Hugg (aka Huggie Boy) and radio station KRLA 1110 played a big role in promoting this music. Chicano rock music was also influenced by the Doo-wop genre, an example being the song &quot;Angel Baby&quot; by the Chicana fronted group Rosie and the Originals.

Don Tosti&#x27;s &quot;Pachuco Boogie&quot;, recorded in 1948, was the first Chicano million-selling record, a swing tune featuring Spanish lyrics, using hipster slang called Calo. Lalo Guerrero arrived in Los Angeles in the late 1930s and found that L.A is &quot;bursting with ambition&quot;. Lalo and his friend captured their spirit in music by mixing swing and boogie woogie in a cross-cultural, dialog between African American, Anglo, and Mexican American influences.

The 1950s brought rhythm and blues and the roots of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. Mexican American were among first to catch the beat and introduced a Latin flair to early rock music.
Chicano rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll star Ritchie Valens, was a Mexican-American singer and songwriter influential in the Chicano rock movement. He recorded numerous hits during his short career, most notably the 1958 hit &quot;La Bamba.&quot; Valens died at age 17 in a plane crash with fellow musicians Buddy Holly and the Big Bopper on February 3, 1959. The tragedy was later immortalized as &quot;the day the music died&quot; in the song &quot;American Pie.&quot;

The 1958 hit song &quot;Tequila!&quot; was written and sung by the saxophone player Danny Flores (not to be confused with Danny David Flores, a former member of Renegade) and performed by The Champs. Flores, who died in September 2006, was known as the &quot;Godfather of Latino Rock.&quot;

In the early to mid-1960s, the American audience was probably more open to Latin sounds than even today because of the popularity of bossa nova, bugalú, mambo, and other forms. Also, musicians who didn&#x27;t conform to the rather limited range of early rock could find success as folk performers. Trini Lopez, whose music was a mixture of folk and pop, gained big hit &quot;If I Had a Hammer&quot; in 1963. He recorded &quot;Corazón de Melón&quot;, a Mexican folk tune. Mid 1960s, the Beatles and The Rolling Stones got success, and unfortunately Trini&#x27;s club style seemed old fashioned too soon.

In the 60s there was an explosion of Chicano rock bands in East Los Angeles and Texas. Sunny &amp; the Sunglows produced several regional hits during the 1960s but is best remembered for its 1963 Number 11 Billboard hit &quot;Talk to Me, Talk to Me&quot;. They hold the distinction of being the first all-Mexican American group featured on American Bandstand. Their versions of &quot;Rags to Riches&quot; (Tony Bennett) and &quot;Out of Sight-Out of Mind&quot; (The Five Keys) also reached the Billboard Hot 100. Another group to appear on American Bandstand as well as open for The Rolling Stones, was The Premiers with their hit rendition of a Don and Dewey song called &quot;Farmer John&quot;. It featured the beat from the popular hit, &quot;Louie, Louie&quot;, which was in turn based on a Latino song, &quot;El Loco Cha Cha&quot;. Richard Berry, credited with writing Louie, Louie, drew inspiration to record the song after listening to an R&amp;B rendition of El Loco Cha Cha performed by the Latin R&amp;B group Rhythm Rockers led by Mexican-Filipino American brothers, Rick and Barry Rillera. The Rillera brothers would go on to record and perform with The Righteous Brothers.

The British Invasion challenged all American musicians, not just Chicanos. East Los Angeles witnessed a surge of creativity, and a renaissance of art, music and politics. Leading the way in music was the band Cannibal &amp; the Headhunters, composed of five young men from the projects who recorded a national hit, &quot;Land of a Thousand Dances,&quot; and almost overnight found themselves opening for the Beatles on the British superstars&#x27; 1965 tour. That same year, Thee Midniters hit the charts with &quot;Whittier Blvd.,&quot; an anthem to East L.A.&#x27;s most famous street, the home of a late-night cruising scene that expressed the California car culture that Mexican Americans were making their own. Also in 1965, the Chicano led Sam the Sham and The Pharaohs released the international hit Wooly Bully which would go on to sell three million copies. Penned by frontman Domingo &quot;Sam&quot; Samudio, it holds the distinction of being the first American record to sell a million copies during the British Invasion era. In 1966, the Mexican American garage band ? and the Mysterians scored a number one hit with the song 96 Tears. The Sir Douglas Quintet is said to have made the most &#x27;English&#x27; sounding American music of the Beatlemania period (actually since the English were playing music that was more rooted in R&amp;B than many white Americans of that time, the Quintet were actually sounding &#x27;English&#x27; by keeping to an all-American R&amp;B/Country sound). Indeed, producer Huey P. Meaux put the &quot;Sir&quot; in the group&#x27;s name to emphasize the connection, but that was more a marketing change than a musical one. The Sir Douglas Quintet was from central Texas, and some of its members were Latinos. However, the group&#x27;s lead singer, Doug Sahm, was not of Mexican descent. Sahm was so thoroughly immersed in Tejano culture, that he later recorded an album under the name Doug Saldaña. Despite the musician&#x27;s efforts to make the group appear to have emerged from the British Invasion, scholars have noted that the group&#x27;s clear Tejano influences and accordion based slowed down polka rhythms give the band a Chicano rock title.
In the late 1960s and 1970s, when civil rights and the Vietnam War were compelling issues, young Mexican American proudly called themselves Chicanos—which once considered as a derogatory term—and many took to the streets to stand up for their rights. Chicano duo Cheech and Chong released novelty single &quot;Basketball Jones&quot;(1973) and hit &quot;Earache My Eye&quot;(1974). Bands like Tierra, Malo, Sapo, Azteca and El Chicano, created new music that &quot;said something&quot; about Chicano heritage and their struggles for equality and justice. In the midst of these events, Mexican-American immigrants of East L.A. were being exposed to cultural identity problems and struggles with assimilation. Chicano rock emerged as a musical art-form with the power to cross over to the mainstream. With aims to pay homage to their native culture and capture the unique Chicano experience. Chicano rockers unified both the Mexican and American roots that lived within their oppressed cultural spheres.
The trend of Chicano rock mirrored what was happening on college campuses as well. The rise of Chicano Studies departments, which offered courses in Chicano literature, politics and culture, affected college students and musicians tremendously. Musicians rebels against the &quot;old world&quot; and adopt the Mexican and Latin American styles in their own music.
Along with visual artists, activists, and audiences, the musicians of the East Los Angeles chicano rock scene form an emergent cultural movement that speaks powerfully to present conditions. The chicano rock scene of East Los Angeles serves as a form of unity for radical Chicanos who wish to bring forth a call to action and a site for resistance through their art. By claiming the musical style of the &quot;old world&quot;, Chicanos are reclaiming their indigenous identity and undoing Spanish colonialism.

The Eastside scene&#x27;s story of formation, the diversity of its origins, and its commitment to political activism and coalition building illuminate the relations between culture and politics in the present. The musical practices of the East L.A. scene bring to the discussion the dislocations and displacements of people of color in urban California, but they also reflect the emergence of new forms of resistance that find counterhegemonic possibilities within contradictions.
Linda Ronstadt is a versatile singer who traversed multiple genres. She gained national hits such as &quot;You&#x27;re No Good&quot; (1975), &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy&quot;, &quot;Blue Bayou&quot; (1977), &quot;Back in the USA&quot; (1978), and &quot;Hurt So Bad&quot; (1980) in the 1970s and &#x27;80s. Ronstadt was nurtured by her Mexican American family whose musical roots run deep in the Mexican border region of Tucson, Arizona. Ronstadt holds dear the memory of childhood serenades by &quot;The Father of Chicano Rock,&quot; Lalo Guerrero, a close family friend. Ronstadt&#x27;s great-aunt Luisa Espinel gained international popularity interpreting Spanish and Mexican song and dance in the 1930s.
Among the most popular female pop singers, Ronstadt is one of the most influential Chicana musicians ever, as evident in her extensive discography and four-decades long career.

==Chicano Rock 1980s==

In 1980s, Tierra gained TOP 40 hit &quot;Together&quot;, and Cheech and Chong recorded &quot;Born In East LA&quot;. Maldita Vecindad is a rock en Español band whose music is a mixture of punk, rap, ska, funk, and Latin. They were formed in Mexico City in 1985 and describe themselves as a mambo punk combo. They influenced other Chicano rock bands and Chicano music, because they were among the first Mexican rock musicians to express a kindred spirit with the Chicano movement. On their early recordings, Maldita Vecindad y Los Hijos del Quinto Patio (BMG Ariola 1989) and Circo (BMG Ariola 1991), Maldita&#x27;s music delved into Chicano culture with songs such as &quot;Mojado,&quot; &quot;Pachuco,&quot; and &quot;Pata de Perro.&quot; In addition to the two albums above, Maldita Vecindad released &quot;Baile de Máscaras&quot; (1996), &quot;Mostros&quot; (1998), and &quot;Greatest Hits + Rarities 1989–1999&quot; (2000).

In the mid-1980s Chicano teen rock band Renegade landed on the international music scene, sporting a combination of heavy metal instrumentation with more pop oriented melodies, resulting in a new subgenre, termed &quot;commercial metal&quot;. The four teens—Kenny Marquez on lead guitar and vocals, Luis Cardenas on drums and vocals, Tony De La Rosa on rhythm guitar and vocals and Danny David Flores on bass guitar and vocals—have been referred to as Chicano rock gods, amongst Mexican-Americans. Renegade or Los Renegados as they are called in Latin-America, went on to sell more than 30 million units worldwide, with a series of hits in Mexico, Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, the United States.

Subsequently, groups like 90s band Ozomatli and Quetzal had led the new wave of Latin Rock groups that fuse multiple musical genres.

Ozomatli mixes rock, hip-hop, funk music, and cumbia. Their song &quot;City of Angels&quot;, presented a new eclectic form of Latino rock.

Quetzal, the band from the barrios of East Los Angeles has been creating Latin folk and roots-rock music for over a decade. With the successful tours and concerts alongside Los Lobos, Ozomatli, Taj Mahal and Michelle Shocked, Quetzal has played intimate clubs and large arenas alike. The band combines rock, Afro-Cuban, country blues, and jazz elements to support the wide-ranging, bilingual vocals of Martha González. The retro-futuristic mix has garnered praise from critics including the LA Times and Los Lobos. Quetzal simultaneously forges a sound that makes you dance and contemplate change.

Robert Lopez AKA El Vez started operating an art gallery called &quot;La Luz de Jesus&quot; and created a show dedicated to Elvis. Since Lopez&#x27;s impersonator did not meet his expectation El Vez was created. El Vez&#x27;s first performance was in Memphis, Tennessee on August 16, 1989. Lopez started making karaoke tapes while running his gallery. While not including &quot;sacred&quot; topics directly, his goal is to blur the line between what is sacred and profane allowing him to have wide age range in his audience. He has been releasing albums since 1994 continuing to use satire and humor in his songs to express revolutionary views. As his lyrics are historical, some teachers and professors use his music to teach history and Mexican American Culture.

==Chicano/Latino Punk==
Chicano punk is a branch of Chicano rock with bands like The Zeros, The Stains, The Plugz, The Bags, Thee Undertakers, Nervous Gender, The Brat, The Gun Club, Los Illegals, Los Angelinos, Felix and the Katz, Odd Squad, Union 13, and The Cruzados coming out of the punk scene in Los Angeles. The rock band ? and the Mysterians, made up of Hispanic American musicians from Bay City and Saginaw, Michigan, was the first band to be described as &quot;punk rock.&quot; The term punk rock was reportedly coined in 1971 by rock critic Dave Marsh in a review of their show for &quot;Creem&quot; magazine.
Recent Chicano punk bands include Rayos X, Tuberculosis, Mata Mata, Mugre, Venganza and Asko from southern California, La Grita and La Plebe from Northern California, as well as Los Crudos from Chicago.

In 1992 Mia Zapata and her punk rock group The Gits released &quot;Frenching the Bully&quot;, their first album, on C/Z Records. The group members met one another and formed the band in Yellow Springs, Ohio during the mid-1980s. Their music quickly became popular throughout the area and on the Antioch College campus. Band member Moriarty describes punk rock as a combination of emotion, temperament, rage and music. The Gits moved from Ohio to San Francisco and finally to Seattle, but not because of the up-and-coming music scene. Moriarty explains that &quot;the idea was to just go up and pour your guts out&quot; and to play their music and express their emotion. The group dissolved after Mia Zapata was murdered on July 7, 1993 by Jesus Mezquia. The remaining members went on to team up with Joan Jett to issue the album Zapata&#x27;s death had interrupted. Proceeds from the album, titled Evil Stig (Gits Live spelled backwards) went to fund an investigator into Zapata&#x27;s death, which had become a cold case.

Many Chicanas became &quot;&quot; and have contributed to the artistic conditions of production, gender relations, and the punk aesthetic that existed in the late 1970s and 1980s. The D-I-Y sensibility at the core of punk musical subcultures found resonance with the practice of rasquache, a Chicano cultural practice of &quot;making do&quot; with limited resources. In fact, young Chicanas had historically been at the forefront of formulating stylized social statements via the fashion and youth subculture, beginning with the Pachucos and continuing with Chicana Mods in the 1960s. Punk&#x27;s critique of the status quo, poverty, sexuality, class inequalities, and war spoke directly to working class East Los Angeles youth.

Alice Bag is an example of a that typifies the punk scene of the late 1970s. Born as Alicia Armendariz, she went by Alice Bag (also Alice Phallus, and Alice Douchbag) as her stage name. Armendariz&#x27;s Chicana experience influenced her music career as projected her unrelenting emotions through punk music. Her music reflects an accumulated rage evolved from being made fun of for not speaking proper English and having to witness domestic violence at a young age. She used her painful childhood experience as empowerment in the male-dominated field of punk rock with her female lead band, Bags. Alice and the Bags are known to be responsible for &quot;co-creating the first wave of California punk alongside the likes of Black Flag, X, the Germs, Phranc (then in Catholic Discipline), and women that came to be known as the Go-Go&#x27;s.&quot;

==Chicano Rock, 1990s–present==
Many popular Chicano and Chicano-led rock bands began to emerge during the mid and late 90s such as P.O.D., Los Lonely Boys, MxPx, Adema, Downset, Spineshank, At the Drive-In, Fenix TX, Ünloco, Union 13, Voodoo Glow Skulls, Ozomatli, The Latin Soul Syndicate, and El Vez, the &quot;Mexican Elvis.&quot; In the early 2000s the progressive Latin-influenced rock band The Mars Volta came onto the scene.

Modern age Chicana punk rock band, Girl in a Coma, express their Chicana experience through their music and artistic expression. Girl in a Coma consists of three members, the two sisters, Nina Diaz, Phanie Diaz and their long time friend, Jenn Alva. Although they claim that they do not consider themselves to be a Latin rock group due to their lack of Spanish speaking fluency, it can&#x27;t be denied that they are a reflection of the Chicana experience. Furthermore, their inability to speak Spanish fluently did not restrict them from releasing their album, &quot;Trio B.C&quot; that plays tribute to the sisters&#x27; grandfather&#x27;s tejano band in which they recorded the last track, &quot;Ven Cera&quot;, completely in Spanish. Girl in a Coma are the modern Chicana that have already picked up quite the large audience since their 2007 debut with their &quot;all-American&quot; punk rock feel. Although, the Latin undertones of their roots are not prominent in their current records, there is a possibility that they will be in their future records as Nina Diaz has stated that she&#x27;s been trying to learn Spanish here and there but it is in her plans to someday write an album completely in Spanish.

In the 2020s, a new generation of Chicano rock artists, influenced by bands such as Cafe Tacuba and Tame Impala, have incorporated alternative rock elements into regional Mexican-style music. Ivan Cornejo, for example, first gained prominence for his &quot;indie Sierreño&quot; style of music.

==Cultural politics of Chicano/a rock==

Zacharias Manuel de la Rocha is an activist is best known as the vocalist and lyricist of rock band Rage Against the Machine.
Rage Against the Machine songs express revolutionary political views. As of 2010, they had sold over 16 million records worldwide. Chicano rock music is being led by a wave of socially and politically active Latin-fusion bands that emerged and gained popularity in the 1990s such as Aztlan Underground, Ozomatli, Lysa Flores, Quinto Sol and more. Their music in general pulls from other genres (soul, samba, reggae, and rap) and utilizes multilingual lyrics (in Spanish, English and Nahuatl) and takes themes like urban exile, indigenous identity and multiracial unity and layers them in order to put into the spotlight important social issues. These artists in particular have been exceptionally successful due to the millions of Latinos in Los Angeles, California that are bilingual/bicultural. One of the larger purposes of the music is to draw attention to &quot;present conditions of oppression and disenfranchisement&quot; in the East L.A. scene, and to provide a form of political possibility to those who are less powerful (financially, socially, etc.).

The Alacranes&#x27; frontman, Ramón &quot;Chunky&quot; Sánchez, once said that Chicano rock lies &quot;somewhere between Pedro Infante and the Rolling Stones.&quot; This categorization, or lack-thereof, by Sánchez demonstrates that Chicano rock might be characterized by an identity rather than a musical style.

== Chicano/a rock as a global phenomenon ==
Chicano rock&#x27;s origins in diverse places like Los Angeles and San Francisco requires us to consider the many cultures that went into its creation. Shared experiences of discrimination have led black and Latinx communities to build what George Lipsitz called &quot;a &#x27;historical bloc&#x27; of oppositional groups united in ideas and intentions if not experience.&quot; A shared experience in America amongst members of Lipsitz&#x27;s &quot;historical bloc&quot; led to cultural, and musical, fusion that transcends national borders. Jesus Velo of 1970s Chicano punk band, Los Illegals, has said &quot;We [had] no choice but to just absorb each other&#x27;s rhythms and patterns.&quot; Through this fusion, international musical styles mixed with American rock to create something novel and multicultural. Mexican-American artists&#x27; music in this era has been labelled &#x27;Chicano rock.&#x27; It&#x27;s undeniable that Chicano rock helped create a distinct Mexican-American identity, but this includes elements of other Latin American nations.

Additionally, Latin American nations&#x27; musical styles were not developed in isolation. Loza writes, &quot;Latin America must be considered a cultural entity much like that of other continental areas––for example, the United States, Europe and East Asia––where intercultural expression ultimately signifies various national identities and &#x27;characters&#x27;.&quot; Latin American nations are built on a mix of indigenous, colonist, and African peoples, and their music reflects contributions from these different cultures.

<text>Ray Edward Cochran ( ; October 3, 1938 – April 17, 1960), known professionally as Eddie Cochran, was an American rock and roll musician. His songs, such as &quot;Twenty Flight Rock&quot;, &quot;Summertime Blues&quot;, &quot;C&#x27;mon Everybody&quot; and &quot;Somethin&#x27; Else&quot;, captured teenage frustration and desire in the mid-1950s and early 1960s. Cochran experimented with multitrack recording, distortion techniques, and overdubbing, even on his earliest singles. Cochran played the guitar, piano, bass, and drums. His image as a sharply dressed and attractive young man with a rebellious attitude epitomized the stance of the 1950s rocker, and in death, Cochran achieved iconic status.

Cochran was involved with music from an early age, playing in the school band and teaching himself to play blues guitar. In 1955, Cochran formed a duo with the guitarist Hank Cochran (no relation) and became known as the Cochran Brothers. When they split the following year, Eddie began a song-writing career with Jerry Capehart. His first success came when he performed the song &quot;Twenty Flight Rock&quot; in the film &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot;, starring Jayne Mansfield. Soon afterward, he signed a recording contract with Liberty Records and his first record for the label, &quot;Sittin&#x27; in the Balcony&quot;, rose to number 18 on the Billboard charts.

Cochran died at the age of 21 in St Martin&#x27;s Hospital, Bath, Somerset, after a car accident in Chippenham, Wiltshire, at the end of his British tour with Gene Vincent in April 1960. On April 16, after they had just performed at the Bristol Hippodrome, on their way to their next venue, Vincent, Cochran and the songwriter Sharon Sheeley were involved in a high-speed traffic accident in a private-hire taxi. The other two passengers survived with major injuries, but Cochran, who had been thrown from the vehicle, suffered serious brain injuries and died the next day.

Though Cochran&#x27;s best-known songs were released during his lifetime, more of his songs were released posthumously. In 1987, Cochran was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. His songs have been recorded by a wide variety of recording artists. Paul McCartney chose Cochran&#x27;s &quot;Twenty Flight Rock&quot; as his audition piece, assured to impress John Lennon by his performance of it, which he did and was hired as a member of Lennon&#x27;s skiffle group the Quarrymen, which later was renamed the Beatles.

==Early life==
Cochran was born on October 3, 1938, in Albert Lea, Minnesota, to Alice and Frank R. Cochran. He was of Scottish descent. Cochran&#x27;s parents were from Oklahoma. Cochran took music lessons in school but quit the band to play drums. Additionally, rather than taking piano lessons, he began learning guitar, playing country and other music he heard on the radio.

In 1952, Cochran&#x27;s family moved to Bell Gardens, California. As his guitar playing improved, Cochran formed a band with two friends from his junior high school. In January 1955, Cochran dropped out of Bell Gardens High School in his first year to become a professional musician.

==Career==
=== The Cochran Brothers (1955–1956) ===

During a show featuring many performers at an American Legion hall, Cochran met Hank Cochran, a songwriter. Although they were not related, they recorded as the Cochran Brothers and began performing together. They recorded a few singles for Ekko Records that were fairly successful and helped to establish them as a performing act. Eddie Cochran also worked as a session musician and began writing songs, making a demo with Jerry Capehart, his future manager.

=== Solo and film appearances (1956–1959) ===
In July 1956, Eddie Cochran&#x27;s first &quot;solo artist&quot; single was released by Crest Records. It featured &quot;Skinny Jim&quot;, now regarded as a rock-and-roll and rockabilly classic. In the spring of 1956, Boris Petroff asked Cochran if he would appear in the musical comedy film &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; (1956). Cochran agreed and performed the song &quot;Twenty Flight Rock&quot; in the movie. In 1957, Cochran starred in his second film, &quot;Untamed Youth&quot; (1957), and had yet another hit, &quot;Sittin&#x27; in the Balcony&quot;, one of the few songs he recorded that was written by other songwriters (in this case John D. Loudermilk). &quot;Twenty Flight Rock&quot; was written by AMI staff writer Ned Fairchild (a pen name—her real name is Nelda Fairchild). Fairchild, who was not a rock and roll performer, merely provided the initial form of the song; the co-writing credit reflects Cochran&#x27;s major changes and contributions to the final product.

==== &quot;Singin&#x27; to My Baby&quot; (1957) ====
In the summer of 1957, Liberty Records issued Cochran&#x27;s only studio album released during his lifetime, &quot;Singin&#x27; to My Baby&quot;. The album included John D. Loudermilk&#x27;s &quot;Sittin&#x27; in the Balcony&quot;. For the album, Cochran worked with manager and songwriter Jerry Capehart, and wrote the songs &quot;Completely Sweet&quot;, &quot;Undying Love&quot;, &quot;When I&#x27;m Mad&quot;, and Cochran original &quot;One Kiss&quot;.

In 1958, Cochran seemed to find his stride in the famous teenage anthem &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; (co-written with Jerry Capehart). With this song, Cochran was established as one of the most important influences on rock and roll in the 1950s, both lyrically and musically. The song, released by Liberty recording no. 55144, charted at number 8 in 1958.

Originally, Cochran toured with the Kelly Four as his backing band, guitarist Mike Deasy, saxophonist Mike Henderson, bassist Dave Shriver, and drummer Gene Riggio. They were known as the Hollywood Swingers, a reference to Dick D&#x27;Agostin&#x27;s band. The line-up of Cochran&#x27;s touring band would change over time, with saxophonist Jim Seals and bassist Connie &#x27;Guybo&#x27; Smith, and the addition of pianist Jim Stivers. They were eventually joined by various members from Dick D&#x27;Agostin and The Swingers. In 1959, the Swingers line-up became muti-instrumentalist with pianist Dick D&#x27;Agostin, pianist Jim Stivers (briefly on bass), guitarist Larry D&#x27;Agostin, saxophonist Paul Kaufman, and drummer Gene Riggio. However, D&#x27;Agostin left and was called up to enlist into the U.S. Army. Members from the Kelly Four returned, Deasy and Henderson, with Stivers and Riggio being accompanied by bassist Don Meyer (later replaced by Dave Shriver). This was the last line-up of Cochran&#x27;s touring band, returning to the name of the Kelly Four. 

Cochran starred in his last film &quot;Go, Johnny, Go!&quot; (1959). In January 1960, Cochran recorded his last session at Gold Star Studios. His brief music career included a few more hits, such as &quot;C&#x27;mon, Everybody&quot;, &quot;Somethin&#x27; Else&quot;, &quot;Teenage Heaven&quot;, and &quot;Three Steps to Heaven&quot;, which posthumously topped the charts in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom in 1960. He remained popular in the United States and United Kingdom through the late 1950s and early 1960s, and more of his records were posthumous hits, such as &quot;My Way&quot;, &quot;Weekend&quot;, and &quot;Nervous Breakdown&quot;.

=== Television appearances ===
Throughout his music career, Cochran made a few television appearances. On October 22, 1957 in Portland, Oregon, Cochran appeared on KPTV&#x27;s &quot;High Time&quot;, hosted by Gene Brendler, and sang &quot;Am I Blue?&quot;. During late 1957, Cochran was on the &quot;Biggest Show of Stars for &#x27;57&quot; tour with Buddy Holly and the Crickets, Fats Domino, Chuck Berry, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Knox, Frankie Lymon, and Paul Anka, among others. In November 1958, Cochran performed on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, and &quot;The Dick Clark Show&quot; (&quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s Saturday Night Beech-Nut&quot;), in which he played his hit song &quot;C&#x27;mon Everybody&quot;.

On February 7, 1959, Cochran performed live on &quot;Town Hall Party&quot; with Dick D&#x27;Agostin and the Swingers. He played &quot;C&#x27;mon, Everybody&quot;, &quot;Have I Told You Lately That I Love You&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Blame It On Me&quot;, &quot;Summertime Blues&quot;, &quot;School Days&quot;, Gene Autry&#x27;s &quot;Be Honest With Me&quot;, and &quot;Money Honey&quot;. There was a brief interview segment on the show, and Cochran was asked about his prediction for the future of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll music. On October 10, 1959, he appeared on &quot;The Dick Clark Show&quot; (&quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s Saturday Night Beech-Nut&quot;), and performed &quot;Somethin&#x27; Else&quot; and &quot;Sittin&#x27; in the Balcony&quot;.

During his UK Tour in 1960, Cochran performed on the BBC radio show &quot;Saturday Club&quot; and the British ABC TV programme &quot;Boy Meets Girls&quot;, hosted by Marty Wilde. In late January 1960, Cochran appeared on two episodes and performed live an array of songs including a newly released cover of Ray Charles&#x27; &quot;Hallelujah I Love Her So&quot;. 
=== Session musician and producer ===
Another aspect of Cochran&#x27;s short but brilliant career is his work as a session musician and producer. In 1959, Cochran played lead for Skeets McDonald at Columbia&#x27;s studios for &quot;You Oughta See Grandma Rock&quot; and &quot;Heart Breaking Mama&quot;. In a session for Gene Vincent in March 1958, he contributed his trademark bass voice, as heard on &quot;Summertime Blues&quot;. The recordings were issued on the album &quot;A Gene Vincent Record Date&quot;.

Cochran worked mainly as a guitarist, and sometimes as a vocalist and arranger for other artists, such as Mamie Van Doren, Baker Knight, Johnny Burnette, Wynn Stewart, and Al Casey. 

=== The Day the Music Died (1959) ===

In early 1959, two of Cochran&#x27;s friends, Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens, along with the Big Bopper, were killed in a plane crash while on tour on February 3, 1959. Cochran&#x27;s friends and family later said that he was badly shaken by their deaths, and he developed a morbid premonition that he also would die young. Shortly after their deaths, Cochran recorded a song (written by disc jockey Tommy Dee) in tribute to them, &quot;Three Stars&quot;. He was anxious to give up life on the road and spend his time in the studio making music, thereby reducing the chance of suffering a similar fatal accident while touring. Financial responsibilities, however, required that Cochran continue to perform live, and that led to his acceptance of an offer to tour the United Kingdom in 1960.

=== United Kingdom tour (1960) ===
Organized and promoted by Larry Parnes, Cochran and Gene Vincent toured the United Kingdom from January through to April 1960. On the bill, they were accompanied by British acts Billy Fury, Joe Brown, Vince Eager, and Tony Sheridan. At the beginning of the tour, Cochran first performed a memorable show in Ipswich, Suffolk at the cinema venue Ipswich Gaumont. Cochran was backed by Marty Wilde&#x27;s band The Wildcats throughout the 1960 tour, exposing the British audience to live American rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. Georgie Fame, then a member of the Beat Boys and the backing band for Vincent, recollected, &quot;I remember Eddie playing guitar and we were astounded.&quot; During the progression of the tour, Cochran&#x27;s fiancé Sharon Sheeley had flown in from America and joined them in late March. From a distance, Sheeley had kept track of Cochran&#x27;s performances in England, when he had sent her postcards and letters. Using a map, she tried to pinpoint exactly where he was each day on the tour. However, their tour ended abruptly.

== Personal life ==
Cochran dated singer-songwriter Sharon Sheeley. As a songwriter, Sheeley worked in the music business and for manager Jerry Capehart. She wrote &quot;Love Again&quot; and &quot;Cherished Memories&quot; for Cochran, and the 1959 hit song &quot;Somethin&#x27; Else&quot; with Eddie&#x27;s brother Bill Cochran. Sheeley had been romantically interested in Cochran for two years, seemingly unrequited. Originally brunette, she dyed her hair blonde and spent money on a new wardrobe, in an attempt to impress Cochran. In 1958, after attending a New Year&#x27;s Eve party hosted by Cochran in New York, the couple started dating. They were secretly engaged by 1960, and were planning a future together.

In 1988, Levi Strauss &amp; Co. promoted their Levi&#x27;s 501 range with a television commercial called &quot;Eddie Cochran&quot;, directed by Syd Macartney. It told the story of how Sheeley (played by actress Sharon Devlin) attracted Cochran at the 1958 party by wearing said product. It was supposedly narrated by Sheeley. The background song, &quot;C&#x27;mon Everybody&quot;, was released as a promotional single, followed by a compilation album of Cochran&#x27;s hits.

==Death==

On the night of April 16, 1960, Cochran and his friend and fellow performing artist, Gene Vincent, had just finished performing at the last of their scheduled concerts at the Bristol Hippodrome. They were traveling along the Bath Road in a taxi (a cream-coloured 1960 model Ford Consul Mark II saloon) from Bristol towards London to Heathrow Airport. In addition to Cochran and Vincent, the other passengers in the vehicle were Sharon Sheeley, Patrick Tompkins (the tour manager, 29 years old), and George Martin (the 19-year-old taxi driver). At about 11:50 p.m. that night, Martin lost control of the vehicle, which crashed into a concrete lamppost at Rowden Hill in Chippenham. At the moment of impact, Cochran (who was seated in the center of the back seat) threw himself over Sheeley to shield her. The force of the collision caused the left rear passenger door to open, and Cochran was ejected from the vehicle, sustaining a massive traumatic brain injury from blunt force trauma to the skull or a cerebral contusion. The road was dry, and the weather was good, but the vehicle was later determined to be travelling at an excessive speed. No other vehicle was involved in the incident.

The occupants of the vehicle were all taken to Chippenham Community Hospital and later transferred to St. Martin&#x27;s Hospital in Bath. Cochran never regained consciousness and died, aged 21, at 4:10 p.m. the following day – Easter Sunday. Sheeley suffered injuries to her back and thigh, Vincent suffered a fractured collarbone and severe injuries to his legs, and Tompkins sustained facial injuries and a possible fracture of the base of the skull. Martin did not sustain significant injuries.

Vincent and Sheeley returned to the United States after the accident. Cochran&#x27;s body was flown home, and after a funeral service was buried on April 25, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Cypress, California. In August 1960, Sheeley told &quot;Photoplay magazine&quot;, that Cochran said to her on his last day, just before entering the taxi to the airport, &quot;You know, Shari, I&#x27;ve got a queer feeling that Fate&#x27;s not going to let us [be together]. Something awful is going to happen— I can feel it.&quot;

Martin was convicted of dangerous driving, fined £50 (and in default of payment six months&#x27; imprisonment), and disqualified from driving for 15 years. His driving disqualification was lifted on May 7, 1968, after the judge at Bristol Assizes determined that Martin &quot;had suffered considerable financial hardship&quot;. The car and other items from the crash were impounded at the local police station until a coroner&#x27;s inquest could be held. David Harman, a police cadet at the station, who would later become known as Dave Dee of the band Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick &amp; Tich, is said to have played on Cochran&#x27;s Gretsch 6120 guitar while it was held at the station.

There is a plaque marking the site of the car crash on Rowden Hill. There is also a memorial stone on the grounds of St Martin&#x27;s Hospital in Bath, commemorating Cochran&#x27;s death. The stone was restored in 2010 on the 50th anniversary of his death and can be found in the old chapel grounds at the hospital. A memorial plaque was also placed next to the sundial at the back of the old chapel. The Eddie Cochran Memorial Project spearheaded a fundraising campaign in 2018 to restore the plaque and install a brand new &quot;Three Steps to Heaven&quot; base at the Chippenham crash site.

While they were preparing to board their taxi, Vincent and Cochran rebuffed musician Tony Sheridan&#x27;s request to ride along with them, resulting in Sheridan&#x27;s avoiding involvement in the accident.

== Legacy ==

=== Posthumous releases and honors ===
A posthumous album, &quot;My Way&quot;, was released in 1964. Cochran was a prolific performer, and the British label Rockstar Records has released more of his music posthumously than was released during his life. The company is still looking for unpublished songs. One of his posthumous releases was &quot;Three Stars&quot;, a tribute to J.P. Richardson, better known as the Big Bopper, and Cochran&#x27;s friends Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens, who had all died in a plane crash just one year earlier. Written just hours after the tragedy by disc jockey Tommy Dee, it was recorded by Cochran two days later (Dee recorded his own version several weeks later). His voice broke during the spoken lyrics about Valens and Holly.

In 1987, Cochran was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. His pioneering contribution to the genre of rockabilly has also been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. Several of his songs have been re-released since his death, such as &quot;C&#x27;mon Everybody&quot;, which was a number 14 hit in 1988 in the UK. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked him number 84 on its 2003 list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time.

&quot;The Very Best of Eddie Cochran&quot; was released by EMI Records on June 2, 2008.

On September 27, 2010, the mayor of Bell Gardens, California, declared October 3, 2010, to be &quot;Eddie Cochran Day&quot; to celebrate the famous musician who began his career when living in that city.

On June 10, 2022, Cochran&#x27;s hometown of Albert Lea, Minnesota renamed James Street to Eddie Cochran Street in his honor.

On May 23, 2023, Cochran was honored with a blue plaque in Bristol, South West England, at the Bristol Hippodrome venue, the last place Cochran performed on his ill-fated tour in 1960.

==== Music ====
In 1963, pop star Heinz Burt and producer Joe Meek paid tribute to Cochran with the song &quot;Just Like Eddie&quot; which became a top five chart hit.

==== Film ====
In 1986, there was a planned biopic film titled &quot;Summertime Blues: The Eddie Cochran Story&quot;, produced by Cassian Elwes and starring Rob Lowe as Cochran. D&#x27;Agostin was involved in the pre-production stage, but the film was never made. Played by actor Jerry Zaremba, Cochran appeared in the 1978 biopic film &quot;The Buddy Holly Story&quot;, directed by Steve Rash. Cochran was played by Brian Setzer of Stray Cats in the 1987 Ritchie Valens biopic &quot;La Bamba&quot;.

There have been two documentary films made on Eddie Cochran&#x27;s life by the BBC, &quot;Three Steps to Heaven&quot; (aired on November 30, 1982 BBC Arena), and &quot;Cherished Memories&quot; (2001 BBC). In 2022, It was announced that Kristy Bell&#x27;s documentary was in the works, titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Me.&quot; Another documentary film titled &quot;The Bell Gardens Rocker&quot; was also in production.

==== Books ====
Cochran&#x27;s life is chronicled in several publications, including &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Me: The Eddie Cochran Story&quot;, by Julie Mundy and Darrel Higham (), and &quot;Three Steps to Heaven&quot;, by Bobby Cochran ().

==Style and influence==
Cochran was one of the first rock-and-roll artists to write his own songs and overdub tracks. He is also credited with being one of the first to use an unwound third string to &quot;bend&quot; notes up a whole tone—an innovation (imparted to UK guitarist Joe Brown, who secured much session work as a result) that has since become an essential part of the standard rock guitar vocabulary. 

Cochran was well known for playing the Gretsch 6120 guitar, with a Wild West &quot;G&quot; branded into the body&#x27;s bass bout. In 2010, Gretch and Fender Musical Instruments Corporation announced the G6120 Eddie Cochran Signature Hollow Body model, based on Cochran&#x27;s original modified Gretsch. 

=== Influence ===
A range of artists have covered Cochran&#x27;s songs, such as Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, the Who, the Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, UFO, Van Halen, Tom Petty, Rod Stewart, T. Rex, Cliff Richard, the Beach Boys, Led Zeppelin, the White Stripes, the Sex Pistols, Sid Vicious, Rush, Simple Minds, George Thorogood, Guitar Wolf, Alan Jackson, the Move, David Bowie, Johnny Hallyday and U2.

It was because Paul McCartney knew the chords and words to &quot;Twenty Flight Rock&quot; that he became a member of the Beatles. On July 6, 1957, McCartney met John Lennon at the St. Peter&#x27;s Church and performed a few songs for him, including Cochran&#x27;s &quot;Twenty Flight Rock&quot;. Lennon was so impressed that he invited McCartney to play in his band, the Quarrymen.

From a young age, Jimi Hendrix was influenced by Cochran. Hendrix performed &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; early in his career, with his band the Jimi Hendrix Experience in 1967. In his own words, Hendrix requested a few of Cochran&#x27;s songs to be played at his funeral. &quot;I tell you, when I die I&#x27;m going to have a jam session. I want people to go wild and freak out. And knowing me, I&#x27;ll probably get busted at my own funeral. The music will be played loud and it will be our music. I won&#x27;t have any Beatles songs, but I&#x27;ll have a few of Eddie Cochran&#x27;s things and a whole lot of blues.&quot;

Pete Townshend of the Who was heavily influenced by Cochran&#x27;s guitar style (&quot;Summertime Blues&quot; was a staple of live performances by the Who for most of their career, until the death of bassist and vocalist John Entwistle in 2002, and is featured on their album &quot;Live at Leeds&quot;). San Francisco Sound band Blue Cheer&#x27;s version of &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; was their only hit and signature song, and has been described as the first heavy metal song.

Producer Terry Manning recorded a live version of &quot;Somethin&#x27; Else&quot; in concert, held inside Elvis Presley&#x27;s first house in Memphis. In 2019, he released a live album &quot;Playin&#x27; with Elvis&quot;, on ECR. In 2016, Manning told &quot;PopWrapped&quot;, &quot;I love rock and roll … the early stuff like Eddie Cochran and Buddy Holly, not to mention Elvis, was very important to me.&quot;

The English band Humble Pie did a rendition of Cochran&#x27;s &quot;C&#x27;mon, Everybody&quot; and the song featured on their album &quot;Smokin&#x27;&quot; (1972).

The glam rock artist Marc Bolan had his main Gibson Les Paul guitar refinished in a transparent orange to resemble the Gretsch 6120 played by Cochran, who was his music hero. He was also an influence on the guitar player Brian Setzer, of Stray Cats, who plays a 6120 almost like that of Cochran, whom he portrayed in the film &quot;La Bamba&quot;.

<doc id="164365" wikidata="Q647599" url="?curid=164365" title="The China Syndrome">
<text>The China Syndrome is a 1979 American thriller film directed by James Bridges and written by Bridges, Mike Gray, and T. S. Cook. The film stars Jane Fonda, Jack Lemmon, and Michael Douglas (who also produced). It follows a television reporter and her cameraman who discover safety coverups at a nuclear power plant. &quot;China syndrome&quot; is a fanciful term that describes a fictional result of a nuclear meltdown, where reactor components melt through their containment structures and into the underlying earth, &quot;all the way to China&quot;.

&quot;The China Syndrome&quot; premiered at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or while Lemmon received the Best Actor Prize. It was theatrically released on March 16, 1979, twelve days before the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, which gave the film&#x27;s subject matter an unexpected prescience. It became a critical and commercial success. Reviewers praised the film&#x27;s screenplay, direction, and performances (most notably of Fonda and Lemmon), while it grossed $51.7 million on a production budget of $5.9 million. The film received four nominations at the 52nd Academy Awards; Best Actor (for Lemmon), Best Actress (for Fonda), Best Original Screenplay and Best Art Direction.

==Plot==
While visiting the Ventana nuclear power plant outside Los Angeles, television news reporter Kimberly Wells, her cameraman Richard Adams and their soundman Hector Salas witness the plant going through a turbine trip and corresponding SCRAM (emergency shutdown). Shift Supervisor Jack Godell notices an unusual vibration in his cup of coffee.

In response to a gauge indicating high water levels, Godell begins removing water from the core, but the gauge remains high as operators open more valves to dump water. Another operator notices a second gauge indicating low water levels. Godell taps the first gauge, which immediately unsticks and drops to indicate very low levels. The crew urgently pumps water back in and celebrates in relief at bringing the reactor back under control.

Adams has surreptitiously filmed the incident, despite being asked not to film for security reasons. Wells&#x27; superior refuses to broadcast her report on the incident. Adams steals the footage and shows it to experts who conclude that the plant came perilously close to meltdown – the China syndrome.

During an inspection of the plant before it is brought back online, Godell discovers a puddle of radioactive water that has apparently leaked from a pump. He pushes to delay restarting the plant, but the plant superintendent wants nothing standing in the way of the restart.

Godell finds that a series of radiographs supposedly verifying the welds on the leaking pump are identical – the contractor simply kept resubmitting the same picture. He brings the evidence to the plant superintendent, who brushes him off as paranoid, stating that new radiographs would cost $20 million. Godell confronts Royce, an employee of Foster-Sullivan who built the plant, as it was he who signed off on the radiographs. Godell threatens to go to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but Royce threatens him; later, a pair of men from Foster-Sullivan park outside his house.

Wells and Adams confront Godell at his home and he voices his concerns. Wells and Adams ask him to testify at the NRC hearings over Foster-Sullivan&#x27;s plans to build another nuclear plant. Godell agrees to obtain, through Salas, the false radiographs to take to the hearings.

Salas&#x27; car is run off the road and the radiographs are taken from him. Godell is chased by the men waiting outside his home. He takes refuge inside the plant, where he finds that the reactor is being brought up to full power. Grabbing a gun from a security guard, he forces everyone out, including his friend and co-worker Ted Spindler, and demands to be interviewed by Wells on live television. Plant management agrees to the interview in order to buy time as they try to regain control of the plant.

Minutes into the broadcast, plant technicians deliberately cause a SCRAM so they can distract Godell and retake the control room. A SWAT team forces its way in, the television cable is cut, and Godell is shot. Before dying, he feels the unusual vibration again. The resulting SCRAM is brought under control only by the plant&#x27;s automatic systems, and the plant suffers significant damage as the pump malfunctions.

Plant officials try to paint Godell as emotionally disturbed, but are contradicted by a distraught Spindler on live television saying Godell was not crazy and would never have taken such drastic steps had there not been something wrong. A tearful Wells concludes her report and the news cuts to a commercial for microwave ovens.

==Cast==

==Reception==
Roger Ebert reviewed it as:

Movie Reviews UK noted the film is:

The acting is also credited:

John Simon said &quot;The China Syndrome&quot; was a taut, intelligent, and chillingly gripping thriller till it turns melodramatic at its end. He called the ending both false and bathetic.

The film has a rating of 88% on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 40 critics. The critical consensus reads: &quot;With gripping themes and a stellar cast, &quot;The China Syndrome&quot; is the rare thriller that&#x27;s as thought-provoking as it is tense&quot;. On Metacritic it has a score of 81 based on reviews from 16 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

===Box office===
The film opened in 534 theatres in the United States and grossed $4,354,854 in its opening weekend.

===Response of nuclear industry===
The March 1979 release was met with backlash from the nuclear power industry which called it &quot;sheer fiction&quot; and a &quot;character assassination of an entire industry&quot;. Twelve days later, the Three Mile Island nuclear accident occurred in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. While some credit the accident&#x27;s timing in helping to sell tickets, the studio attempted to avoid appearing as if they were exploiting the accident, including pulling the film from some theaters.

<text>Roy Richard Scheider (; November 10, 1932 – February 10, 2008) was an American actor. Described by AllMovie as &quot;one of the most unique and distinguished of all Hollywood actors&quot;, he achieved fame with his leading and supporting roles in celebrated films from the 1970s through to the mid-1980s. He was nominated for two Academy Awards, one Golden Globe, and one BAFTA.

Scheider&#x27;s best-known roles include Frank Ligourin in &quot;Klute&quot; (1971), Martin Brody in &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975) and its 1978 sequel, &quot;Cloudy&quot; Russo in &quot;The French Connection&quot; (1971), &quot;Buddy&quot; in &quot;The Seven-Ups&quot; (1973), Doc Levy in &quot;Marathon Man&quot; (1976), Scanlon / Dominguez in &quot;Sorcerer&quot; (1977), Joe Gideon in &quot;All That Jazz&quot; (1979), Murphy in &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; (1983), and Dr. Heywood Floyd in the &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; sequel, &quot;2010: The Year We Make Contact&quot; (1984). Subsequent credits included &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; (1991), &quot;Romeo Is Bleeding&quot; (1993), &quot;The Myth of Fingerprints&quot; (1997), &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; (1997), and &quot;The Punisher&quot; (2004). He also portrayed Captain Nathan Bridger on NBC&#x27;s &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot; from 1993–1996.

== Early life ==
Scheider was born in Orange, New Jersey, the son of Anna (&quot;née&quot; Crosson) and auto mechanic Roy Bernhard Scheider. Scheider&#x27;s mother was of Irish descent with an Irish Catholic background, while his father was a Protestant German American. As a child, Scheider was an athlete, participating in organized baseball and boxing competitions, for which he was classed as a welterweight, weighing in at 140 lb (63.5 kg). Scheider competed in the Diamond Gloves Boxing Tournament in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He attended Columbia High School in Maplewood, New Jersey, graduating in 1950, and was inducted into the school&#x27;s hall of fame in 1985. He traded his boxing gloves for the stage, studying drama at both Rutgers University and Franklin and Marshall College, where he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.

===Amateur boxing===
Between 1946 and 1949, Scheider boxed as an amateur in New Jersey. Scheider said in a television interview in the 1980s that he took up boxing to lose weight. He said he had no desire to fight, but that his trainer, Georgie Ward, encouraged him to compete. In his second bout, at the 1946 Diamond Gloves Tournament (Golden Gloves), Scheider suffered a broken nose and lost by technical knockout in two rounds to Myron Greenberg. He went on to post an 11–1 (six knockouts) record, reversing his defeat by Greenberg in the process. 

=== Military service ===
Scheider served three years in the United States Air Force as a first lieutenant in air operations from 1955 to 1958. He then became a captain in the Air Force Reserve Command until 1964.

==Acting career==
Scheider&#x27;s first film role was in the horror film &quot;The Curse of the Living Corpse&quot; (1964). On television, he played running roles on two CBS soap operas, &quot;Love of Life&quot; and &quot;The Secret Storm&quot;, and also played character roles in episodes of &quot;Camera Three&quot;, &quot;N.Y.P.D.&quot;, and &quot;Coronet Blue&quot;. He was in the TV movie &quot;Lamp at Midnight&quot; (1966). In 1968, Scheider appeared with the New York Shakespeare Festival, and also won an Obie Award for Distinguished Performance in James Joyce&#x27;s play &quot;Stephen D,&quot; appearing in it 68 times at the East 74th Street Theater. He appeared in the films &quot;Stiletto&quot; (1969), &quot;Loving&quot; (1970), and &quot;Puzzle of a Downfall Child&quot; (1970), and on television in &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; and &quot;Cannon&quot;.

In 1971, he appeared in two highly popular films, &quot;Klute&quot;, directed by Alan Pakula, and &quot;The French Connection&quot;, directed by William Friedkin. The latter, in which he played a fictionalized version of New York City detective Sonny Grosso, gained him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Scheider became much in demand. He went to Europe to have key supporting roles in &quot;The French Conspiracy&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Outside Man&quot; (1972).

Scheider&#x27;s first starring role came in &quot;The Seven-Ups&quot; (1973), a quasi follow-up to &quot;The French Connection&quot;, in which Scheider&#x27;s character is once again based on Grosso. He was second-billed in &quot;Sheila Levine Is Dead and Living in New York&quot; (1975). Scheider portrayed Chief Martin Brody in the Hollywood blockbuster &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975), which also starred Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss. Scheider&#x27;s ad-libbed line, &quot;You&#x27;re gonna need a bigger boat,&quot; was voted 35th on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of best movie quotes. He appeared as secret agent Doc Levy in &quot;Marathon Man&quot; (1976), with Dustin Hoffman and Laurence Olivier.

Scheider was initially set to appear in the lead role in Michael Cimino&#x27;s never-filmed romantic thriller &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;, but the film was canceled due to &quot;political machinations&quot; at Paramount. Ironically, Scheider was later offered the role portrayed by Robert De Niro in Cimino&#x27;s &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; (1978), which was the second film of a three-picture deal with Universal Studios. He reunited with &quot;French Connection&quot; director William Friedkin in &quot;Sorcerer&quot; (1977), the second adaptation of the 1950 French novel &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot;. Although the film didn&#x27;t do well at the box office, it has since acquired a large cult following.

Still under contract after dropping out two weeks before &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; started filming, Universal offered him the option of reprising his role as Martin Brody for a &quot;Jaws&quot; sequel, and would consider his contractual obligations fulfilled if he accepted. Scheider accepted, and &quot;Jaws 2&quot; was released in 1978. It was a huge hit. Scheider starred in &quot;Last Embrace&quot; (1979), a thriller directed by Jonathan Demme. He received his second Academy Award nomination, this time as Best Actor in &quot;All That Jazz&quot; (1979), in which he played a fictionalized version of the film&#x27;s director and co-writer Bob Fosse. Some of the film&#x27;s production was portrayed in the FX miniseries &quot;Fosse/Verdon&quot;, in which Scheider was played by Lin-Manuel Miranda.

He made a thriller with Meryl Streep for Robert Benton, &quot;Still of the Night&quot; (1982), which was a box-office disappointment. The following year, however, his box office performance improved with &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; (1983), a John Badham film about a prototype attack helicopter that provided security over the city of Los Angeles during the 1984 Summer Olympic Games. He made two TV movies, &quot;Jacobo Timerman: Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number&quot; (1983) and &quot;Tiger Town&quot; (1984). This was followed by a role as Dr. Heywood Floyd in Peter Hyams&#x27; &quot;2010&quot;, a 1984 sequel to Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1968 science-fiction classic &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, in which William Sylvester originated the role of Floyd. He provided narration for &quot;&quot; (1985).

Scheider was in &quot;The Men&#x27;s Club&quot; (1986), &quot;52 Pick-Up&quot; (1986) for John Frankenheimer, &quot;Cohen and Tate&quot; (1988), &quot;Listen to Me&quot; (1989), &quot;Night Game&quot; (1989), &quot;The Fourth War&quot; (1990) again for Frankenheimer, &quot;Somebody Has to Shoot the Picture&quot; (1990), and &quot;The Russia House&quot; (1990). One of his later parts was that of Dr. Benway in the long-in-production 1991 film adaptation of William S. Burroughs&#x27; novel &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;. Scheider played a mob boss who meets a horrific fate in the Gary Oldman crime film &quot;Romeo Is Bleeding&quot; (1994) and a chief executive of a corrupt insurance company cross-examined by Matt Damon&#x27;s character in 1997&#x27;s &quot;John Grisham&#x27;s The Rainmaker&quot;, directed by Francis Ford Coppola.

Scheider appeared among an ensemble cast in &quot;The Myth of Fingerprints&quot; (1997), for which he was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award. He appeared as the crusty father of hero Frank Castle in &quot;The Punisher&quot; (2004), and in 2007, starred in &quot;The Poet&quot; and &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Care&quot;. When Scheider died in February 2008, he had two movies upcoming: &quot;Dark Honeymoon&quot;, which had been completed, and the thriller &quot;Iron Cross&quot;. In &quot;Iron Cross&quot;, Scheider plays the leading role of Joseph, a holocaust survivor with a propensity for justice, which was inspired by director Joshua Newton&#x27;s late father Bruno Newton. &quot;Iron Cross&quot; was ultimately released in 2011.

Scheider was lead star in the Steven Spielberg-produced television series &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot; as Captain Nathan Bridger. During the second season, Scheider voiced disdain for the direction in which the series was heading. His comments were highly publicized, and the media criticized him for panning his own show. NBC made additional casting and writing changes in the third season, and Scheider decided to leave the show. His contract, however, required that he make several guest appearances that season. Scheider hosted an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in the 10th (1984–1985) season and appeared on the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Bill &amp; Peter&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot;, voicing himself as the host of a toilet-training video, portions of which were censored on FOX and syndicated broadcasts. He provided voiceover on the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Three Kings&quot; (which was recorded in September 2007 but aired in May 2009, a year and three months after his death in February 2008), which also featured his &quot;Jaws&quot; co-star Richard Dreyfuss.

Scheider guest-starred in the &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; episode &quot;Endgame&quot; as serial killer Mark Ford Brady, who is identified at the episode&#x27;s end as being the biological father of Detective Goren (played by Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio). He narrated and was associate producer of the 2006 &quot;Jaws&quot; documentary &quot;The Shark is Still Working&quot;. In 2007, Scheider received one of two annual Lifetime Achievement Awards at the SunDeis Film Festival in Waltham, Massachusetts. After Scheider&#x27;s death, a biography entitled &quot;Roy Scheider: A Life&quot; was released as a tribute, compiling reviews, essays, and narration on his life and career.

== Personal life ==
Scheider married Cynthia Bebout on November 8, 1962. The couple had one daughter, Maximillia (1963–2006), before divorcing in 1986. On February 11, 1989, he married actress Brenda Siemer, with whom he had a son, Christian Scheider, and adopted a daughter, Molly. They remained married until his death.

== Death ==
In 2004, Scheider was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. In June 2005, he received a bone marrow transplant to treat the cancer. He died of a staph infection on February 10, 2008, in Little Rock, Arkansas, at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Medical Center. He was 75 years old.

<text>Herbert Thorson Blomstedt (; born 11 July 1927) is a Swedish conductor of classical music. At the age of 97 he continues to conduct concerts in Europe and the United States.

==Biography==
Herbert Blomstedt was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, the son of Adolf Blomstedt (1898–1981) and his wife Alida Armintha Thorson (1899–1957). Two years after his birth, his Swedish parents moved the family back to their country of origin. He studied at the Stockholm Royal College of Music and the University of Uppsala, followed by studies of contemporary music at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse in 1949, Baroque music with Paul Sacher at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, and further conducting studies with Igor Markevitch, Jean Morel at the Juilliard School, and Leonard Bernstein at Tanglewood&#x27;s Berkshire Music Center. Blomstedt also lived in Finland during his youth.

He won the Koussevitzky Conducting Prize in 1953 and the Salzburg Conducting Competition in 1955.

Blomstedt is most noted for his performances of German and Austrian composers, such as Beethoven, Felix Mendelssohn, Johannes Brahms, Franz Schubert, Anton Bruckner, Richard Strauss and Paul Hindemith, and also as a champion of Scandinavian composers, such as Edvard Grieg, Franz Berwald, Jean Sibelius and Carl Nielsen.

A devout Seventh-day Adventist, Blomstedt does not rehearse on Friday nights or Saturdays, the Sabbath in Seventh-day Adventism. He does, however, conduct concerts, since he considers actual performances to be an expression of his religious devotion rather than secular work.

He has been Music Director or Principal Conductor of the Norrköping Symphony Orchestra (1954–1962), Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra (1962–1968), Danish Radio Symphony (1967–1977) and Swedish Radio Symphony (1977–1982). From 1975 to 1985, he served as chief conductor of the Staatskapelle Dresden as well as the Saxon State Opera, in the process making many well-regarded recordings, including works of Richard Strauss and the complete Beethoven and Schubert symphonies, and leading the orchestra on international tours.

Blomstedt was music director of the San Francisco Symphony from 1985 to 1995. He led the orchestra on regular tours of Europe and Asia, and made numerous prize-winning recordings for London/Decca, winning two Grammy Awards, a Gramophone Award and a Grand Prix du Disque, as well as awards from Belgium, Germany, and Japan. After leaving San Francisco full-time, Blomstedt held principal conductorships with the North German Radio Symphony (1996–1998) and Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra (1998–2005).

Blomstedt holds the title of conductor laureate with the San Francisco Symphony and is honorary conductor of the Bamberg Symphony, Danish National Symphony Orchestra, NHK Symphony, Swedish Radio Symphony, Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra and Staatskapelle Dresden. At age 97, he continues to conduct and in February 2025 he completed a series of concerts with the San Francisco Symphony.

<text>A croissant (, ) is a French pastry in a crescent shape made from a laminated yeast dough similar to puff pastry.

It is a buttery, flaky, &quot;viennoiserie&quot; pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian &quot;kipferl&quot;, but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.

Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century, when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the &quot;kipferl&quot; with a yeast-leavened laminated dough.

In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the &quot;La Croissanterie&quot; chain, was a French response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30–40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.

Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European countries.

==Origin and history==
The &quot;kipferl&quot;, an Austrian crescent-shaped pastry, can be dated back to at least the 13th century in Austria, and came in various shapes. The &quot;kipferl&quot; can be made plain or with nuts or other fillings (some consider the rugelach a form of &quot;kipferl&quot;).
In either 1838 or 1839, an Austrian artillery officer, August Zang, founded a Viennese bakery (&quot;Boulangerie Viennoise&quot;) at 92, rue de Richelieu in Paris. This bakery, which served Viennese specialties including the &quot;kipferl&quot; and the Vienna loaf, quickly became popular and inspired French imitators (and the concept, if not the term, of &quot;viennoiserie&quot;, a 20th-century term for supposedly Vienna-style pastries). The French version of the &quot;kipferl&quot; was named for its crescent (&quot;croissant&quot;) shape and has become a universally identifiable shape across the world.

The earliest known recipe for the present-day croissant appears in 1905, although the name croissant appears among the &quot;fantasy or luxury breads&quot; in 1853. Earlier recipes for non-laminated croissants can be found in the 19th century and at least one reference to croissants as an established French bread appeared as early as 1850.

Zang himself returned to Austria in 1848 to become a press magnate, but the bakery remained popular for some time afterwards, and was mentioned in several works of the time: &quot;This same M. Zank ...founded around 1830 [sic], in Paris, the famous Boulangerie viennoise&quot;. Several sources praise this bakery&#x27;s products: &quot;Paris is of exquisite delicacy; and, in particular, the succulent products of the Boulangerie Viennoise&quot;; &quot;which seemed to us as fine as if it came from the Viennese bakery on the rue de Richelieu&quot;.

By 1869, the croissant was well established enough to be mentioned as a breakfast staple, and in 1872, Charles Dickens wrote (in his periodical &quot;All the Year Round&quot;) of &quot;the workman&#x27;s &quot;pain de ménage&quot; and the soldier&#x27;s &quot;pain de munition&quot;, to the dainty croissant on the boudoir table&quot;

The puff pastry technique that now characterizes the croissant was already mentioned in the late 17th century, when La Varenne&#x27;s &quot;Le Cuisinier françois&quot; gave a recipe for it in the 1680 – and possibly earlier – edition. It was typically used not on its own but for shells holding other ingredients (as in a vol-au-vent). It does not appear to be mentioned in relation to the croissant until the 20th century.

The first recipe corresponding to the modern croissant, not only for the shape but also the texture of the dough and the taste, was published in 1906, in Paris, in Colombié&#x27;s &quot;Nouvelle Encyclopédie culinaire.&quot;

Sylvain Claudius Goy was a French chef who is sometimes said to have recorded the earliest recipe of the modern croissant. His 1915 book &quot;La Cuisine Anglo-Americaine&quot; contains a croissant recipe which Frey Fine Books consider to be the first such recipe published, and they describe the recipe as having &quot;[given] birth to the croissant of present day&quot;. Goy&#x27;s recipe uses a laminated yeast dough known in French as &quot;pâte feuilletée levée&quot;.

===Culinary legends===

Stories of how the &quot;kipferl&quot; — sometimes confused with the croissant — was created are widespread and persistent culinary legends, going back to the 19th century. However, there are no contemporary sources for any of these stories, and an aristocratic writer, writing in 1799, does not mention the &quot;kipferl&quot; in a long and extensive list of breakfast foods.

The legends include tales that it was invented in Europe to celebrate the defeat of the Umayyad forces by the Franks at the Battle of Tours in 732, with the shape representing the Islamic crescent; that it was invented in Buda; or, according to other sources, in Vienna in 1683 to celebrate the defeat of the Ottomans by Christian forces in the siege of the city, as a reference to the crescents on the Ottoman flags, when bakers staying up all night heard the tunneling operation and gave the alarm.

The Islamic origin story seems to have originated with the 20th-century writer Alfred Gottschalk, who gave two versions:

For this reason, the Islamic State attempted to ban croissants during the Syrian civil war.

==Variants==
Uncooked croissant dough can also be wrapped around any praline, almond paste, or chocolate before it is baked (in the last case, it becomes like &quot;pain au chocolat&quot;, which has a different, non-crescent, shape), or sliced to include sweet or fillings. It may be flavored with dried fruit such as sultanas or raisins, or other fruits such as apples. In France and Spain, croissants are generally sold without filling and eaten without added butter, but sometimes with almond filling.

In the United States, sweet fillings or toppings are sometimes used, and warm croissants may be filled with ham and cheese, or feta cheese and spinach. In the Levant, croissants are sold plain or filled with chocolate, cheese, almonds, or zaatar. In Germany, croissants are sometimes filled with Nutella or persipan; in southern Germany, there is also a popular variety of a croissant glazed with lye (&quot;Laugencroissant&quot;). In the German-speaking part of Switzerland, the croissant is typically called a &quot;Gipfeli&quot;; this usually has a crisper crust and is less buttery than the French-style croissant.

===Argentina and Uruguay===
Croissants are commonly served alongside coffee for breakfast, &quot;aperitivo&quot; (a light mid-morning meal), or &quot;merienda&quot; (a mid-afternoon meal). They are referred to as &quot;medialunas&quot; (&quot;half moons&quot;) because of their shape and are typically coated with a sweet glaze (&quot;medialunas de manteca&quot;, &quot;half moons of butter&quot;). Another variant is a &quot;medialuna de grasa&quot; (&quot;half moon of lard&quot;), which is not always sweet.

===Italy===
A cousin of the croissant is the Italian &quot;cornetto&quot; (in the center and south) or brioche (in the north). These variants are often considered to be the same, but that is not completely true: the French version tends to be crispy, whereas an Italian &quot;cornetto&quot; or brioche is usually softer. Furthermore, the &quot;cornetto vuoto&quot; () is commonly accompanied by variants with filling, which include &quot;crema pasticciera&quot; (custard), apricot jam or chocolate cream. They often come covered with powdered sugar or other toppings. &quot;Cornetto&quot; with cappuccino at the bar is one of the most common breakfasts in Italy.

===Poland===

On 11 November, St. Martin&#x27;s Day is celebrated in the Polish region of Greater Poland, mainly in its capital city Poznań. On this day, the people of Poznań purchase and eat considerable amounts of sweet, crescent-shaped pastries called &quot;rogale świętomarcińskie&quot; (&quot;St. Martin&#x27;s croissants&quot;). They are made specially for this occasion from puff pastry filled with ground white poppy seeds, almonds, raisins, and nuts.

===Portugal===
The first type of Portuguese croissant is similar to the French, and can be plain or filled with custard, chocolate, fruit jam, or a typical Portuguese cream made of egg yolk and sugar, &quot;doce de ovo&quot;. It is customary for these to also have powdered sugar on top. The second version has a similar consistency to brioche and is commonly eaten with ham and cheese. Sometimes this type is also served like toast, with a spread of butter. While the first type of croissant is considered sweet and is eaten during breakfast or tea, the second type is a more filling meal and is usually considered a sandwich and often prepared for picnics or as travel food. Both types share the same name (French/Portuguese: &quot;croissant&quot;) but are typically found in different bakeries: the sweet croissant is more commonly found in Portuguese pâtisseries and the brioche croissant is usually found in coffeehouses.

===Turkey===
A pastry with croissant shape is the Turkish &quot;ay çöreği&quot;. It is filled with cinnamon, walnut, hazelnut, cacao and raisin. Its rectangular shape variant is known as &quot;pastiç&quot; or &quot;İzmir çöreği&quot;. It is generally eaten during breakfast or with tea.

==Overview of manufacturing==

The first step of manufacturing croissants is the &quot;predough&quot; formation. To prepare predough, flour, water, in-dough fat, yeast, salt, and sugar are mixed together in a single step. Typically, croissant predough is mixed in a relatively cool environment, for a longer time than other pastries. The ideal temperature of the dough should be around , to best hydrate the ingredients. In comparison to the mixing of bread dough ingredients, pastry predough is considered underdeveloped in that mixing is stopped as soon as the dough appears homogeneous, to allow for further dough development in the next step.

The second step is the lamination process. Lamination is necessary to produce multilayered dough with alternating layers of predough and fat. Generally, there are two methods for folding fat into the dough: the English method and the French method. In the English method, one fold results in two fat layers and three dough layers. After spreading out predough, roll-in fat is flattened to a similar thickness as the predough and spread over two-thirds of the surface of the laminated predough. The exposed third of predough is then folded over half of the roll-in fat, while the other end (one predough and one fat layer) is folded on top. In the French method, one fold results in one fat layer and two dough layers. After spreading out the predough and putting a layer of roll-in fat over the center surface of the dough, the corners of the predough are folded toward the middle of the fat. Croissant dough is typically laminated until 16–50 fat layers are obtained. The optimal number of layers can be determined by balancing certain crumb properties with specific volume. On one hand, a low number of layers yields large specific heights as well as irregular crumb structure with large voids. On the other hand, a large number of relatively thin layers leads to interconnections between different dough layers as well as less dough lift.

After lamination, the dough is formed into its famous crescent shape. First, the laminated dough is cut into triangles of the desired size. The triangles are then rolled with three-and-a-half to four full turns, and finally, the ends of the roll are curved inwards to form a crescent.

The third step is the fermentation process. Croissants are different from other puff pastries in that they include yeast, which, during proofing, increases the dough volume. Ideally, the optimum croissant quality is achieved at a yeast level of 7.5%, with a proof time of 60 minutes at . The croissants are finished proofing when the dough has expanded two-and-a-half times its original volume.

The fourth step is the baking process. Also known as &quot;pastry lift&quot; or &quot;dough lift&quot;, the dough expands as water is converted to steam, thus increasing the pressure between each dough layer. As a result, the croissant dough rises up to yield its characteristic flaky texture. Depending on the type of oven used and specific size of the croissant, the baking time can range from 10 to 20 minutes and the oven temperature can be set anywhere from .

The final steps are the cooling and storage of the croissant. Croissants are generally not stored for very long and are typically consumed soon after baking.

==Ingredient functionality during processing==

===Predough===
Gluten proteins affect the water absorption and viscoelastic properties of the predough. The role of proteins can be divided into two stages of dough formation: hydration and deformation. In the hydration stage, gluten proteins absorb water up to two times their own weight. In the deformation or kneading stage, the action of mixing causes the gluten to undergo a series of polymerization and depolymerization reactions, forming a viscoelastic network. Hydrated glutenin proteins in particular help form a polymeric protein network that makes the dough more cohesive. On the other hand, hydrated gliadin proteins do not directly form the network, but do act as plasticizers of the glutenin network, thus imparting fluidity to the dough’s viscosity.

Starch also affects the viscosity of predough. At room temperature and in a sufficient amount of water, intact starch granules can absorb water up to 50% of their own dry weight, causing them to swell to a limited extent. The slightly swollen granules are found in the spaces between the gluten network, thus contributing to the consistency of the dough. The granules may not be intact, as the process of milling wheat into flour damages some of the starch granules. Given that damaged starch granules have the capacity to absorb around three times as much water as undamaged starch, the use of flour with higher levels of damaged starch requires the addition of more water to achieve optimal dough development and consistency.

Water content affects the mechanical behavior of predough. As previously discussed, water is absorbed by gluten and starch granules to increase the viscosity of the dough. The temperature of the water is also important as it determines the temperature of the predough. In order to facilitate processing, cold water should be used for two main reasons. First, chilled water provides a desirable environment for gluten development, as the temperature at which mixing occurs impacts the dough’s hydration time, consistency, and required amount of mixing energy. Secondly, cold water is comparable to the temperature of the roll-in fat to be added later, which better facilitates the latter’s incorporation.

In-dough fat affects the texture and lift of predough. Although higher levels of dough fat may lower dough lift during baking, it also correlates with a softer end product. As such, the main function of in-dough fat is to produce a desirable softness in the final croissant.

===Lamination===
In laminated croissant dough, the gluten network is not continuous. Instead, the gluten proteins are separated as thin gluten films between dough layers. The formation of thin, well-defined layers affects the height of dough lift. Generally, laminated croissant dough contains fewer layers than other puff pastry doughs that do not contain yeast, due to the presence of small bubbles in the gluten sheets. Upon proofing, these bubbles expand and destroy the integrity of the dough layers. The resulting interconnections between different dough layers would over-increase dough strength and allow water vapor to escape through micropores during baking, consequently decreasing dough lift. The role of fat also influences the separation of layers, as will be discussed next.

Roll-in fat affects the flakiness and flavor of the croissant. In laminated dough, fat layers alternate with dough layers. As such, the most important function of roll-in fat is to form and maintain a barrier between the different dough layers during sheeting and folding. As previously stated, the ability for fat to maintain separation between folded dough layers ensures proper dough lift.

The type of roll-in fat used is typically butter or margarine. Butter and margarine are both water-in-oil emulsions, composed of stabilized water droplets dispersed in oil. While butter is appealing due to its high consumer acceptance, its low melting point, , actually makes it undesirable for production purposes. The use of butter as roll-in fat during the lamination step will cause problems of oiling out during sheeting and fermentation if the temperature is not tightly controlled, thus disrupting the integrity of the layers. On the other hand, kinds of margarine are commonly used as roll-in fat because they facilitate dough handling. Generally, roll-in margarine should have a melting point between , at least higher than the fermentation temperature to prevent oiling out prior to baking. It is also important to consider the plasticity and firmness of the roll-in fat, which is largely determined by its solid fat content. Generally, a greater proportion of solid fat coincides with larger croissant lift. At the same time, the roll-in fat should have plasticity comparable to that of the dough, such that the fat layers do not break during sheeting and folding. If the fat is firmer than the dough, then the dough can rupture. If the fat is softer than the dough, then it will succumb to the mechanical stress of sheeting and potentially migrate into the dough.

===Fermentation===

Croissants contain yeast, &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, which is incorporated during predough formation. When oxygen is abundant, the yeast breaks down sugar into carbon dioxide and water through the process of respiration. This process releases energy that is used by the yeast for growth. After consuming all of the oxygen, the yeast switches to anaerobic fermentation. At this point, the yeast partially breaks down sugar into ethanol and carbon dioxide. Once saturates the dough’s aqueous phase, the gas begins to leaven the dough by diffusing to preexisting gas cells that were incorporated into the predough during mixing. Yeast action does not produce new gas cells, as the immense pressure required for a single molecule to create a new gas bubble is not physically attainable

In order to ensure the flaky texture of the croissant, it is important to balance the yeast activity with steam production. If the yeast overproduces , then the well-defined layers may collapse. During the baking process, this would cause steam to escape too early from the bread, reducing dough lift and flakiness of the final product. Thus, to offset the negative effects of yeast on layer integrity and dough lift, croissants usually contain fewer layers than other puff pastries.

===Baking===

During baking, the transient gluten network turns into a permanent network. At higher temperatures, intermolecular disulfide bonds form between glutenin molecules, as well as between gliadin and glutenin. With more bonds being made, the gluten network becomes more rigid, strengthening the croissant’s crumb texture. Additionally, the baking process significantly stretches the dough layers due to the large macroscopic deformation that occurred during fermentation’s dough lift.

Starch undergoes gelatinization as a result of baking. Prior to baking, starch granules absorb a small amount of water at room temperature as it is mixed with water to form predough. As long as the dough’s temperature stays under the gelatinization temperature, this granule swelling is limited and reversible. However, once the baking process begins and the dough is exposed to temperatures above the gelatinization temperature, amylopectin crystallites become more disordered inside the starch granules and cause an irreversible destruction of molecular order. At the same time, starch gelatinization actively draws water from the gluten network, further decreasing the flexibility of the gluten. Currently, the extent of amylose leaching and granular structure distortion during the baking of croissants is still unknown.

Roll-in fat gradually melts as the temperature in the oven increases. Some of the melting fat can migrate into the dough, which could then interfere with gluten protein crosslinking. The fat phase also contributes to dough lift through gas inflation, which will be described next.

Water is converted to steam during the baking process, which is the main factor behind the leavening of the dough. The water for steam production comes from both the dough layers and the roll-in fat. As the fat melts, the continuous oil phase is no longer able to stabilize the water droplets, which are then released and converted to steam. Although the exact mechanism of steam entrapment is still unclear, it is likely a result of both steam expanding inside each dough layer and steam migrating to oil layers, where it inflates gas bubbles. The steam migration to oil phase is likely due to the smaller pressure differential required to inflate a bubble of steam in liquid fat than in solid dough. As the concentration of steam increases between dough layers, the increased pressure causes the dough to lift. During the entire baking process, only half of the water vapor contributes to dough lift, as the other half is lost through micropores and capillaries of interconnected dough layers.

===Storage===
The effect of gluten proteins during cooling and storage is still unclear. It is possible that gluten proteins influence croissant firming through the loss of plasticizing water, which increases the stiffness of the gluten network.

Starch plays a major role in the degradation of croissants during storage. Amylopectin retrogradation occurs over several days to weeks, as amorphous amylopectin chains are realigned into a more crystalline structure. The transformation of the starch causes undesirable firmness in the croissant. Additionally, the formation of the crystal structure of amylopectin requires the incorporation of water. Starch retrogradation actively draws water from the amorphous gluten network and some of the amorphous starch fraction, which reduces the plasticity of both.

Water migration influences the quality of stored croissants through two mechanisms. First, as previously stated, water redistributes from gluten to starch as a result of starch retrogradation. Secondly, during the baking process, a moisture gradient was introduced as a result of heat transfer from the oven to the croissant. In fresh croissants, there is high moisture content on the inside and low moisture content on the outside. During storage, this moisture gradient induces water migration from the inside to the outer crust. On a molecular level, water is lost from the amorphous starch fraction and gluten network. At the same time, water diffuses from the outer crust to the environment, which has less moisture. The result of this redistribution of water is a firming up of the croissant, caused by a decrease in starch plasticity and an increase in gluten network rigidity. Due to the presence of large pores in croissants, moisture is lost to the environment at a faster rate than bread products. As such, croissants generally become harder in texture at a faster rate than breads.

Fat also affects the quality of croissants in storage. On one hand, an increased amount of in-dough fat has been found to correspond to a reduction in crumb hardness immediately after baking. This is likely attributed to the high-fat content of croissants, as increased fat levels decrease moisture diffusion. On the other hand, although roll-in fat softens the croissant’s initial crumb, its effect on croissant hardness during storage is still unclear.

<doc id="164374" wikidata="Q1103721" url="?curid=164374" title="Clyde McPhatter">
<text>Clyde Lensley McPhatter (November 15, 1932 – June 13, 1972) was an American rhythm and blues, soul, and rock and roll singer. He was one of the most widely imitated R&amp;B singers of the 1950s and early 1960s and was a key figure in the shaping of doo-wop and R&amp;B.

McPhatter&#x27;s high-pitched tenor voice was steeped in the gospel music he sang in much of his early life. He was the lead tenor of the Mount Lebanon Singers, a gospel group he formed as a teenager. He was later the lead tenor of Billy Ward and his Dominoes and was largely responsible for the initial success of the group. After his tenure with the Dominoes, McPhatter formed his own group, the Drifters, and later worked as a solo performer. Only 39 at the time of his death, he had struggled for years with alcoholism and depression, and was, according to Jay Warner&#x27;s &quot;On This Day in Music History&quot;, &quot;broke and despondent over a mismanaged career that made him a legend but hardly a success.&quot;

McPhatter left a legacy of over 22 years of recording history. He was the first artist to be inducted twice into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, first as a solo artist and later as a member of the Drifters. Subsequent double and triple inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame are said to be members of the &quot;Clyde McPhatter Club&quot;.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
McPhatter was born in the community of Hayti, in Durham, North Carolina on November 15, although the year is disputed. Some sources cite 1932. Author Colin Escott cites 1931, stating, &quot;most biographies quote 1933 or 1934, although government documents cite the earlier year&quot;. His grave marker cites his birth year as 1932.

He was raised in a Baptist family, the son of Rev. George McPhatter and his wife Beulah (some accounts refer to her as Eva). Starting at the age of five, he sang in his father&#x27;s church gospel choir along with his three brothers and three sisters. When he was 10, Clyde was the soprano-voiced soloist for the choir.

In 1945, Rev. McPhatter moved his family to Teaneck, New Jersey, where Clyde attended Chelsior High School. He worked part-time as a grocery store clerk and was promoted to shift manager upon graduating high school. The family then relocated to New York City, where Clyde formed a gospel group, the Mount Lebanon Singers.

===With Billy Ward and the Dominoes (1950–53)===
In 1950, after winning the coveted Amateur Night at Harlem&#x27;s Apollo Theater contest, McPhatter returned to his job as a store manager. He was discovered singing the choir in the Holiness Baptist Church of New York City by Billy Ward of Billy Ward and his Dominoes and was recruited into the group. He was present for the recording of &quot;Sixty Minute Man&quot; for Federal Records, produced by Ralph Bass.

Billy Ward and his Dominoes was one of the top R&amp;B vocal groups in the country, garnering more popularity than the Clovers, the Ravens, and the Five Keys, largely due to McPhatter&#x27;s fervent, high-pitched tenor. In his book &quot;The Drifters&quot;, Bill Millar named Ben E. King, Smokey Robinson of the Miracles, Sammy Turner, and Marv Johnson among the many vocalists who patterned themselves after McPhatter. &quot;Most important,&quot; he concluded, &quot;McPhatter took hold of the Ink Spots&#x27; simple major chord harmonies, drenched them in call-and-response patterns, and sang as if he were back in church. In doing so, he created a revolutionary musical style from which—thankfully—popular music will never recover.&quot;

After recording several more songs with the Dominoes, including &quot;Have Mercy Baby&quot;, &quot;Do Something for Me&quot;, and &quot;The Bells&quot;, McPhatter left the Dominoes on May 7, 1953. He was sometimes passed off as &quot;Clyde Ward, Billy&#x27;s little brother&quot;. Others assumed Billy Ward was doing the lead singing. As a member of the Dominoes, McPhatter did not earn much money; Ward paid him $100 a week, minus deductions for food, taxes, motel bills, etc. In an interview in 1971, McPhatter told journalist Marcia Vance, &quot;whenever I&#x27;d get back on the block where everybody&#x27;d heard my records—half the time I couldn&#x27;t afford a Coca-Cola.&quot;

Due to such occurrences, and as he was frequently at odds with Ward, McPhatter decided he would quit the Dominoes, intent on making a name for himself. He announced his intent to quit the group, and Ward agreed to his leaving provided that McPhatter stayed long enough to coach a replacement. Auditions for a replacement were later held at Detroit&#x27;s Fox Theater, and a young Jackie Wilson eventually took over as lead tenor for the Dominoes. The position influenced Wilson&#x27;s singing style and stage presence. &quot;I fell in love with the man&#x27;s voice. I toured with the group and watched Clyde and listened...&quot;— and apparently learned.

Privately, McPhatter and Ward often argued, but publicly McPhatter expressed his appreciation of Ward for giving him his start in entertainment. &quot;I think Billy Ward is a very wonderful musician and entertainer. I appreciate all he did for me in giving me my start in show business.&quot;

===The Drifters (1953–54)===
Ahmet Ertegun, founder of Atlantic Records, and Jerry Wexler, eagerly sought McPhatter after noticing he was not present for an appearance by the Dominoes at Birdland, which was &quot;an odd booking for the Dominoes&quot;, in Ertegun&#x27;s words.

After locating him, McPhatter was signed to Atlantic on the condition that he form his own group. McPhatter promptly assembled a group and called them the Drifters. They recorded a few tracks in June 1953, including a song called &quot;Lucille&quot;, written by McPhatter himself. This group of Drifters did not have the sound Atlantic executives were looking for, however, and Clyde was prompted to assemble another group of singers. The initial members of the Drifters McPhatter assembled were mostly members of the Mount Lebanon Singers.

The revised lineup recorded and released such hits as &quot;Money Honey&quot;, &quot;Such a Night&quot;, &quot;Honey Love&quot;, &quot;White Christmas&quot;, and &quot;What&#x27;cha Gonna Do&quot;, with the record label displaying the group name &quot;Clyde McPhatter and the Drifters&quot; on the first two singles, later changed to &quot;The Drifters featuring Clyde McPhatter&quot;.

In late 1954, McPhatter was inducted into the U.S. Army and assigned to Special Services in the continental United States, which allowed him to continue recording. After his tour of duty, he left the Drifters and launched a solo career. The Drifters continued as a successful group, but with many changes in personnel, and the group assembled by McPhatter was long gone by the time their greatest successes were released after he left the group.

Upon his departure from the Drifters, McPhatter sold his share of the group to the band&#x27;s manager George Treadwell, a decision that he later came to regret, after realizing that he caused his fellow musicians to experience unprofitability and the group essentially became a revolving-door line-up with recycled members on a ridiculous $100 weekly salary and paid virtually no royalties.

===Solo career===

Just after his military discharge, McPhatter recorded his first solo hit, &quot;Love Has Joined Us Together&quot;, with Ruth Brown. He released several R&amp;B recordings in the next few years, including &quot;Rock and Cry&quot;, &quot;Seven Days&quot; (later a bigger hit for Tom Jones), &quot;Treasure of Love&quot;, &quot;Let Me Know&quot;, &quot;Just to Hold My Hand&quot;, and his biggest solo hit, &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Question&quot;, written by Brook Benton and Jimmy T. Williams, which peaked at number six in 1958.

McPhatter&#x27;s 1956 recording &quot;Treasure of Love&quot; was his first number-one hit on the R&amp;B charts as a solo artist, and spent one week in the UK Singles Chart. It reached number 16 on the U.S. pop charts, sold over two million copies in the United States alone, and was awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America.

After leaving Atlantic Records, McPhatter signed with MGM Records and released several more songs, including &quot;I Told Myself a Lie&quot; and &quot;Think Me a Kiss&quot; (1960), and his first single for Mercury Records, &quot;Ta Ta&quot;. His tenure on these labels proved to be less fruitful than his time with Atlantic. He moved to other record labels and recorded more singles, including &quot;I Never Knew&quot; and his final top-10 hit, &quot;Lover Please&quot;, written by country artist Billy Swan, which made it to number seven in 1962. After &quot;Lover Please&quot;, McPhatter&#x27;s career took a downward turn, as musical styles and tastes were constantly changing during the 1960s. He managed a top 30 R&amp;B hit, &quot;Crying Won&#x27;t Help You Now&quot;, in 1964, then fell off the charts. McPhatter turned to alcohol abuse, sporadically releasing recordings that failed to chart.

In 1968, McPhatter moved to England, where he still had something of a following, using the UK band ICE as backup.

==Death==
McPhatter returned to the U.S. in 1970, making a few appearances in rock-and-roll revival tours, but lived mostly as a recluse. Hopes for a major comeback with a Decca album were crushed on June 13, 1972, when he died in his sleep at the age of 39, of complications of heart, liver, and kidney disease, brought on by alcohol abuse – behavior fueled by a failed career and resentment he harbored towards the fans he felt deserted him. In his interview with journalist Marcia Vance, McPhatter said, &quot;I have no fans.&quot; He died at 1165 East 229th Street, in the Bronx, New York, where he had been living with Bertha M. Reid. They were traveling together as he tried to make a comeback.

McPhatter was a resident of Teaneck, New Jersey, at the time of his death. He was buried at George Washington Memorial Park in Paramus, New Jersey. At the time of his death, Clyde McPhatter had one daughter, Deborah L. McPhatter, born in April 1953. Ruth Brown acknowledged in her later years that McPhatter was the father of her son Ronald, born in 1954. Ron now tours with his own group named after his father – Clyde McPhatter&#x27;s Drifters.

<text>Andrew Dickson White (November 7, 1832 – November 4, 1918) was an American historian and educator who co-founded Cornell University, one of eight Ivy League universities in the United States, and served as its first president for nearly two decades. He was known for expanding the scope of college curricula. A politician, he had served as New York state senator and was later appointed as U.S. ambassador to Germany and Russia.

He was one of the founders of the conflict thesis, which states that science and religion have historically been in conflict, and tried to prove it over the course of approximately 800 pages in his &quot;History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom&quot;.

==Early life and education==
White was born on November 7, 1832, in Homer, New York, to Clara (née Dickson) and Horace White. Clara was the daughter of Andrew Dickson, a New York State Representative in 1832 and his wife. Horace was the son of Asa White, a farmer from Massachusetts, and his wife. Their once-successful farm was ruined by a fire when Horace was 13.

Despite little formal education and struggles with poverty after his family lost their farm, Horace White became a businessman and wealthy merchant. In 1839, he opened what became Syracuse Savings Bank in Syracuse. Horace and Clara White had two children: Andrew Dickson and his brother. Andrew was baptized in 1835 at the Calvary Episcopal Church on the town green in Homer.

One of Andrew&#x27;s cousins, Edwin White, became an artist of the Luminism style and Hudson River School. His nephew was Horace White, governor of New York.

Beginning in the fall of 1849, White enrolled as an undergraduate at Geneva College, known today as Hobart and William Smith Colleges, at the insistence of his father. He was inducted as a member of Sigma Phi Society in 1850 and he served as editor of the fraternity&#x27;s publication, &quot;The Flame&quot;. White remained active in the fraternity for the rest of his life, founding the Cornell chapter and serving as the national president from 1913 to 1915. In his autobiography, he recalled that he had felt that his time at Geneva was &quot;wasted&quot; by being at the small Episcopalian school instead of at &quot;one of the larger New England universities&quot;. White dropped out in 1850. 

After a period of estrangement, White persuaded his father to let him transfer to Yale College. At Yale, White was a classmate of Daniel Coit Gilman, who later served as the first president of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. The two were members of the Skull and Bones secret society and would remain close friends. They traveled together in Europe after graduation and served together on the Venezuela Boundary Commission (1895–1896). His roommate was Thomas Frederick Davies Sr., who later became the third bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Michigan, 1889–1905. Other members of White&#x27;s graduating year included Edmund Clarence Stedman, the poet and essayist; Wayne MacVeagh, Attorney General of the United States and U.S. Ambassador to Italy; and Hiram Bingham II, the missionary, collectively comprising the so-called &quot;famous class of &#x27;53.&quot; According to White, he was deeply influenced in his academic career and life by Professor Noah Porter (later, Yale&#x27;s president), who personally instructed him in rhetoric and remained a close personal friend until Porter&#x27;s death.

He also served as an editor of &quot;The Lit.,&quot; known today as the &quot;Yale Literary Magazine.&quot; He belonged to Linonia, a literary and debating society. As a junior, White won the Yale literary prize for the best essay, writing on the topic &quot;The Greater Distinctions in Statesmanship;&quot; this was a surprise as traditionally a senior was chosen for the winning essay. Also as a junior, White joined the junior society Psi Upsilon. In his senior year, White won the Clark Prize for English disputation and the De Forest prize for public oratory, speaking on the topic &quot;The Diplomatic History of Modern Times&quot;. Valued at $100, the De Forest prize was then the largest prize of its kind at any educational institution, American or otherwise. In addition to academic pursuits, White was on the Yale crew team, and competed in the first Harvard–Yale Regatta in 1852.

After graduation, White traveled and studied in Europe with his classmate Daniel Coit Gilman. Between 1853 and 1854, he studied at the Sorbonne, the , and the University of Berlin. He also served as the translator for Thomas H. Seymour, the U.S. Ambassador to Russia, following Gilman&#x27;s term as translator, although he had not studied French (the language of diplomacy and the Russian royal court) prior to his studies in Europe. After he returned the United States, White enrolled at Yale to earn a MA and be inducted into Phi Beta Kappa in 1856.

==Career==
===Academia===
In October 1858, White accepted a position as a professor of History and English literature at the University of Michigan, where he remained on faculty until 1863. White made his lasting mark on the grounds of the university by enrolling students to plant elms along the walkways on The Diag. Between 1862 and 1863, he traveled to Europe to lobby France and Britain to assist the United States in the American Civil War or at least not to aid the Confederate States.

===Founding of Cornell University===
In 1863, White returned to reside in Syracuse for business reasons. In November, he was elected to the New York State Senate on the Union Party ticket. In the Senate, White met the fellow upstate Senator Ezra Cornell, a self-taught Quaker farmer from Ithaca who had made a modest fortune in the telegraph industry. Around then, the senators were called on to decide how best to use the higher education funding provided by the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, which allocated timberland in the Midwest, which states could sell as they saw fit. Through effective management by Cornell, New York, generated about $2.5 million (equivalent to $ in today dollars) from its allotted scrip, a greater yield per acre than any state except perhaps California. The senators initially wanted to divvy the funds among the numerous small state colleges of their districts. White fervently argued that the money would be more effectively used if it endowed only one university. Ezra Cornell agreed and told White, &quot;I have about half a million dollars more than my family will need: what is the best thing I can do with it for the State?&quot; White immediately replied, &quot;The best thing you can do with it is to establish or strengthen some institution of higher learning.&quot; The two thus combined their efforts to form a new university.

White pressed for the university to be located on the hill in Syracuse, the current location of Syracuse University, because of the city&#x27;s transportation hub. That could help attract faculty, students, and other persons of note. However, as a young carpenter working in Syracuse, Cornell had been robbed of his wages, and insisted for the university to be in his hometown of Ithaca. He proposed to donate land on his large farm on East Hill, overlooking the town and Cayuga Lake. White convinced Cornell to give his name to the university &quot;in accordance with [the] time-honored American usage&quot; of naming universities after their largest initial benefactors. On February 7, 1865, White introduced a bill &quot;to establish the Cornell University&quot; and, on April 27, 1865, after months of debate, Governor Reuben E. Fenton signed into law the bill endowing Cornell University as the state&#x27;s land-grant institution.In 1865, White also authored &quot;...The Negro&#x27;s Right to Citizenship - a very detailed legal, ethical and logical argument for citizenship for the Negro.&quot; A staunch abolitionist, White was also the author of &quot;abolition of Slavery the Right of Government under the War Powers Act&quot; as well as several other legal arguments in favor of the Negro.&quot;

White became the school&#x27;s first president and served as a professor in the Department of History. He commissioned Cornell&#x27;s first architecture student, William Henry Miller, to build his president&#x27;s mansion on campus.

White was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1869 and American Antiquarian Society in 1884.

In 1891, Leland and Jane Stanford asked White to serve as the first president of Stanford University, which they had founded in Palo Alto, California. Although he refused, he recommended his former student David Starr Jordan.

===Conflict thesis===

At the time of Cornell&#x27;s founding, White announced that it would be &quot;an asylum for &quot;Science&quot;—where truth shall be sought for truth&#x27;s sake, not stretched or cut exactly to fit Revealed Religion.&quot; Until then, most of America&#x27;s private universities had been founded as religious institutions and generally were focused on the liberal arts and religious training.

In 1869, White gave a lecture on &quot;The Battle-Fields of Science&quot; in which he argued that history showed the negative outcomes resulting from any attempt on the part of religion to interfere with the progress of science. Over the next 30 years, he refined his analysis, expanding his case studies to include nearly every field of science over the entire history of Christianity but also narrowing his target from &quot;religion&quot; through &quot;ecclesiasticism&quot; to &quot;dogmatic theology.&quot;

The final result was the two-volume &quot;A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom&quot; (1896) in which he asserted the conflict thesis of science being against dogmatic theology. Initially less popular than John William Draper&#x27;s &quot;History of the Conflict between Religion and Science&quot; (1874), White&#x27;s book became an influential text in the 19th century on the relationship between religion and science. White&#x27;s conflict thesis has been widely rejected among contemporary historians of science. The warfare depiction remains a popular view among critics of religion.

===Diplomat===

While at Cornell, in 1871, he took leave to serve as a Commissioner to Santo Domingo, along with Benjamin Wade and Samuel Howe, at the request of President Ulysses Grant to determine the feasibility of an American annexation of the Dominican Republic. Their report (available here) supported the annexation, but Grant was unable to gain sufficient political support to take further action.

Later, White was appointed as the American ambassador to Germany (1879–1881). After returning to the United States, he was elected as the first president of the American Historical Association (1884–1886). Upstate New York Republicans nominated him for governor in 1876 and for Congress in 1886, but he did not win either primary.

Following his resignation in 1885 as Cornell&#x27;s president, White served as the minister to Russia (1892–1894), president of the American delegation to The Hague Peace Conference (1899), and again as ambassador to Germany (1897–1902).

In 1904, White published his &quot;Autobiography&quot;, which he had written while he was relaxing in Italy after his retirement from the Department of State with the change in administrations. Cornell&#x27;s third president, Jacob Gould Schurman, was appointed as ambassador to Germany from 1925 to 1929.

At the onset of World War I, White supported the German cause within Europe because he had strong professional and emotional ties to Germany. By the summer of 1915, he retreated from this position and refrained from offering any support either publicly or privately. In the fall of 1916, President Woodrow Wilson appointed White to a peace commission to prepare a treaty with China. As of December 1916, White had reduced some of his obligations, resigning from the Smithsonian Board of Regents and the trustees of the Carnegie Institution.

===Bibliophile===

Over the course of his career, White amassed a sizable book collection. His library included an extensive section on architecture, which then represented the largest architecture library in the United States. He donated all 4,000 books to the Cornell University Library for the purpose of teaching architecture as well as the remainder of his 30,000-book collection.

In 1879, White enlisted George Lincoln Burr, a former undergraduate assistant for one of his seminars, to manage the rare books collection. Though Burr would later hold other positions at the university, such as Professor of History, he remained White&#x27;s collaborator and head of this collection until 1922 by traveling over Europe, locating and amassing books that White wanted. In particular, he built the collections on the Reformation, witchcraft, and the French Revolution. Today, White&#x27;s collection is housed primarily in the Cornell Archives and in the Andrew Dickson White Reading Room (formally known as the &quot;President White Library of History and Political Science&quot;) at Uris Library on the Ithaca Campus. The A.D. White Reading Room was designed by William Henry Miller, who had also designed White&#x27;s mansion on campus.

While serving in Russia, White made the acquaintance of author Leo Tolstoy. Tolstoy&#x27;s fascination with Mormonism sparked a similar interest in White, who had previously regarded the Latter-Day Saints (LDS) as a dangerous cult. Upon his return to the United States, White took advantage of Cornell&#x27;s proximity to the religion&#x27;s birthplace in Palmyra to amass a collection of LDS memorabilia (including many original copies of the Book of Mormon); it is unmatched by any other institution outside the church itself and its flagship Brigham Young University.

==Personal life==
White married twice. His first marriage, on September 27, 1857, was to Mary Amanda Outwater (February 10, 1836 – June 8, 1887), daughter of Peter Outwater and Lucia M. Phillips of Syracuse. Mary&#x27;s maternal grandmother Amanda Danforth, daughter of Asa Danforth Jr. and wife of Elijah Phillips Jr., was the first white child born in what would become Onondaga County, New York. Her great-grandfathers included General Asa Danforth, an early pioneer of upstate New York and leader of the State Militia, as well as Elijah Philips Sr., who had responded to the alarm to Lexington, Massachusetts, in 1775 and later served as the High Sheriff of Onondaga County.

Andrew and Mary had three children together: Frederick Davies White, who committed suicide in his forties in 1901 after a prolonged series of illnesses; Clara (White) Newbury, who died before her father; and Ruth (White) Ferry. After his wife died in 1887, White went on a lecture tour and traveled in Europe with his close friend, Daniel Willard Fiske, librarian at Cornell.

After three years as a widower, in 1890, White married Helen Magill, the daughter of Edward Magill, Swarthmore College&#x27;s second president. She was the first woman in the United States to earn a Ph.D. Like her husband, Helen was a social scientist and educator; the two met at a conference where she was presenting a paper. Together, Helen and Andrew had three children.

==Death and legacy==

On October 26, 1918, White suffered a slight paralytic stroke following a severe illness of several days. On the morning of Monday, November 4, White died at home in Ithaca. Three days later, on November 7, on what would have been White&#x27;s 86th birthday, White was interred at Sage Chapel on the Cornell campus. The chapel was filled to capacity by faculty, trustees, and other well-wishers.

White&#x27;s body resides in a sarcophagus in the Memorial Room with those of other persons deemed influential in the founding and early years of the university, including co-founder Ezra Cornell and benefactor Jennie McGraw-Fiske. His marble sarcophagus was designed in the popular Art Nouveau style. It features crests of countries and institutions that played important roles in White&#x27;s life. For example, the adjacent picture shows the crests of the two countries where White was an ambassador; the coat of arms of Imperial Germany is on left and Saint George, a variation on the coat of arms of Moscow, representing Russia, is on the right.

The sarcophagus was completed in 1926 by sculptor Lee Oskar Lawrie (1877–1963), who also created sculptures adorning Myron Taylor Hall at Cornell. Lawrie is perhaps best known for his Atlas statue at Rockefeller Center in New York City.

In his will, White left $500,000 to Cornell University, in addition to the considerable sums donated to the institution earlier in his life.

===Cornell University===
In his 1904 autobiography, &quot;The Autobiography of Andrew Dickson White&quot;, White wrote:

Until at least the mid-20th century, Cornell undergraduates with the surname &#x27;White&#x27; were traditionally given the nickname &#x27;Andy&#x27; in reference to White. Notably, E. B. White, author of the world-famous children&#x27;s book &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot;, continued to go by the nickname &#x27;Andy&#x27; for the rest of his life after his undergraduate years at Cornell.

==Legacy and honors==

Historian Benjamin G, Rader argues that in creating Cornell:White championed nondenominationalism, coeducation, an
elective curriculum, and academic freedom. These positions won him a lasting reputation as a pioneer in the history of higher education.

According to professor Geoffrey Blodgett, White confronted a series of complex challenges in his long career:Above all, the creation from scratch of a large, high-quality, coeducational, nonsectarian public university in the cockpit of post-Civil War, educational politics was an organizational chore of awesome subtlety for man of White&#x27;s genteel background and soaring ideals.&quot;

<doc id="164376" wikidata="Q945074" url="?curid=164376" title="Being There">
<text>Being There is a 1979 American satirical comedy-drama film starring Peter Sellers, Shirley MacLaine, and Melvyn Douglas. Directed by Hal Ashby, it is based on the 1970 novel of the same name by Jerzy Kosiński, and adapted for the screen by Kosiński and the uncredited Robert C. Jones. Jack Warden, Richard Dysart, and Richard Basehart are featured in support.

Douglas won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and Sellers was nominated for Best Actor. The screenplay won the British Academy Film Award for Best Screenplay and the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Comedy Adapted from Another Medium. It was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay. In 2015, the Library of Congress selected &quot;Being There&quot; for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

Middle-aged, simple-minded Chance lives in a wealthy old man&#x27;s townhouse in Washington, D.C., along with the man&#x27;s African-American maid Louise, who is kind to Chance. He has spent his whole life tending the garden and never left the property. Other than gardening, his knowledge is derived entirely from television. When the old man dies, his estate lawyers order Chance out.

He wanders aimlessly, discovering the outside world for the first time. An African-American youth points a knife at him; Chance ineffectually tries to click him out of existence with a TV remote control. Passing by a TV shop, Chance sees himself captured by a video camera in the shop window. Entranced, he steps backward off the sidewalk and is struck by a limousine chauffeuring Eve Rand, the glamorous and much younger wife of elderly business mogul Ben Rand. When she asks him his name she mishears &quot;Chance, the gardener&quot; as &quot;Chauncey Gardiner&quot;.

Eve brings Chance to their palatial estate to be seen by Dr. Allenby, who is resident there caring for Ben, who is slowly dying from a blood disease. After checking Chauncey out, the doctor invites him to stay to keep an eye on him.

Chauncey&#x27;s manners are old-fashioned and courtly, and he wears expensively-tailored but outmoded 1930s clothes he took from his former employer&#x27;s attic. When Ben meets him he takes &quot;Chauncey&quot; for an upper-class, highly educated businessman fallen on hard times. Ben admires him, finding him direct, wise and insightful.

Ben is also a confidant and advisor to the President of the United States, whom he introduces to Chauncey. In a discussion about the economy, Chance takes his cue from the words &quot;stimulate growth&quot; and talks about the changing seasons of the garden. The President misinterprets this as optimistic political advice and quotes &quot;Chauncey Gardiner&quot; in a speech.

Chance now rises to national prominence, attends important events, develops a close connection with the Soviet ambassador, and appears on a talk show during which his detailed advice about what a serious gardener should do is misunderstood as his opinion on presidential policy. Louise tells other African Americans as they watch Chance on TV that he has &quot;rice pudding between the ears&quot; and that whiteness is all that is needed to succeed in America. The President is shown as sexually impotent with his wife when watching the show.

Though Chance has now risen to the pinnacle of Washington society, the Secret Service and 16 foreign agencies are unable to find any background information on him. Meanwhile, Allenby becomes increasingly suspicious that Chance is not a wise political expert and that his mysterious identity may have a more mundane explanation. Allenby considers telling Ben, but remains silent when he realizes how happy Chance is making him in his final days.

The dying Ben encourages Eve to become close to &quot;Chauncey&quot;. She is already attracted to him and makes a sexual advance. Chance has no interest in or knowledge of sex, but mimics a kissing scene from the 1968 film &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot;, which happens to be on TV. When the scene ends, Chance stops suddenly and Eve is confused. She asks what he likes, meaning sexually; he replies &quot;I like to watch,&quot; meaning television. She is momentarily taken aback, but masturbates for his voyeuristic pleasure, not noticing he has turned back to the TV and is imitating &quot;Lilias, Yoga and You&quot; on another channel.

Chance is present at Ben&#x27;s death and shows genuine sadness. Questioned by Allenby, he admits that he &quot;loves Eve very much&quot; and also that he is just a gardener. When he leaves to inform Eve of Ben&#x27;s death, Allenby says to himself, &quot;I understand.&quot;

While the President delivers a speech at Ben&#x27;s funeral, the pallbearers hold a whispered discussion over potential replacements for the President in the next presidential term, and unanimously agree on &quot;Chauncey&quot; as successor. Oblivious, Chance wanders off through Ben&#x27;s wintry estate. He straightens out a pine sapling flattened by a fallen branch, then walks across the surface of a lake without sinking. He pauses, dips his umbrella deep into the water to the right of his path, then continues on, while the President is heard quoting Ben: &quot;Life is a state of mind.&quot;

==Cast==
==Production==
===Casting===
Burt Lancaster was Ashby&#x27;s first choice for the role of Ben Rand. Laurence Olivier was also considered for the role, but turned it down because of the masturbation scene.

===Filming===
Principal filming occurred at the Biltmore Estate, the largest private home in the United States, located in Asheville, North Carolina. According to MacLaine, &quot;(Peter) believed he was Chauncey. He never had lunch with me ... He was Chauncey Gardiner the whole shoot, but believing he was having a love affair with me.&quot; The original ending as written in the script was filmed; it shows Eve finding Chance by the lake, they declare they have found each other, and both walk back together. However, Ashby was unhappy with this ending so he had a platform submerged in the lake for Sellers to walk on, creating the film&#x27;s enigmatic final scene.

Melvyn Douglas&#x27;s granddaughter, Illeana Douglas, visited the set and met Peter Sellers, who is her favorite actor. She has since credited the film for inspiring her to pursue a career in acting. According to Illeana, Sellers and Douglas had known each other since the 1940s, when they first met in the Burma campaign (1944–1945) during World War II. They often reminisced about their war days while on the set. The making of the film is portrayed in &quot;The Life and Death of Peter Sellers&quot;, a biographical film of Sellers&#x27; life.

==Music==
Incidental music is used very sparingly. What little original music is used was composed by Johnny Mandel, and primarily features two recurrent piano themes based on &quot;Gnossiennes&quot; No. 4 and No. 5 by Erik Satie. The other major pieces of music used are the Eumir Deodato jazz/funk arrangement of the opening fanfare from &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot; and &quot;Basketball Jones&quot; by Cheech and Chong. These pieces respectively accompany the title credits and Chance&#x27;s first arrival to the Biltmore Estate. Mandel was also assisted by his cousin and fellow composer Miles Goodman with the orchestration of the film.

==Reception==
The film opened to positive reviews and gave Sellers a hit after many failed films outside of the &quot;Pink Panther&quot; series. Film critic Roger Ebert awarded a full grade of four out of four stars in his original print review. Gene Siskel also gave the film a perfect grade of four stars, calling it &quot;one of those rare films, a work of such electric comedy that you are more likely to watch it in amazement than to break down and laugh.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a stately, beautifully acted satire with a premise that&#x27;s funny but fragile.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;an unusually fine film&quot; that &quot;represents Peter Sellers&#x27; most smashing work since the mid-1960s.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;a gentle, exquisitely funny film,&quot; adding that &quot;Sellers hasn&#x27;t been so terrific—or had such terrific material—in years.&quot;

Vincent Misiano reviewed &quot;Being There&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; and commented that &quot;the film&#x27;s humor never flags and yet its delicately bitter irony is never far away. It satirizes politics and politicians, business and businessmen, and, finally, all the rest of us and what we imagine we see when we look at one another.&quot;

In 2006 Roger Ebert mentioned the reaction of his students to the final scene (which is unique to the film, not appearing in the book), stating that they once suggested that Chance may be walking on a submerged pier. But, Ebert writes, &quot;The movie presents us with an image, and while you may discuss the meaning of the image, it is not permitted to devise explanations for it. Since Ashby does not show a pier, there is no pier—a movie is exactly what it shows us, and nothing more.&quot;

The credits at the film&#x27;s end roll over an outtake known as the &quot;Rafael outtake.&quot; Sellers was displeased that the outtake ran because he believed that it took away from Chauncey&#x27;s mystique. He also believed that it prevented him from winning the Oscar.

As of 2023 the film holds a score of 95% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 62 reviews, with an average rating of 8.60/10. The critical consensus calls it &quot;smart, sophisticated, and refreshingly subtle.&quot; In 2003, &quot;The New York Times&quot; placed the film on its &quot;Best 1000 Movies Ever&quot; list.

<text>Pierre Puvis de Chavannes (; 14 December 1824 – 24 October 1898) was a French painter known for his mural painting, who came to be known as &quot;the painter for France&quot;. He became the co-founder and president of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, and his work influenced many other artists, notably Robert Genin, and he aided medallists by designs and suggestions for their works. Puvis de Chavannes was a prominent painter in the early Third Republic. Émile Zola described his work as &quot;an art made of reason, passion, and will&quot;.

==Early life==
Puvis de Chavannes was born Pierre-Cécile Puvis in a suburb of Lyon, France, on December 14, 1824. He was the son of a mining engineer and descended from an old noble family of Burgundy. He later added the ancestral &quot;de Chavannes&quot; to his name. Throughout his life, he spurned his Lyon origins, preferring to identify himself with the &#x27;strong&#x27; blood of the Burgundians, where his father originated.

Puvis de Chavannes was educated at the Amiens College and at the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. He intended to follow his father&#x27;s profession until a serious illness compelled him to convalesce at Mâcon with his brother and sister-in-law in 1844 and 1845, which interrupted his studies. A journey to Italy opened his mind to fresh ideas, and on his return to Paris in 1846, he announced his intention to become a painter.

He studied first under Eugène Delacroix, but only very briefly, as Delacroix closed his studio shortly afterwards due to ill health. He studied subsequently under Henri Scheffer and then Thomas Couture. His training was not classical as he found that he preferred to work alone. He took a large studio near the Gare de Lyon and attended anatomy classes at the Académie des Beaux Arts. It was not until a number of years later, when the government of France acquired one of his works, that he gained wide recognition.

In 1850, Puvis de Chavannes made his Salon debut with &quot;Dead Christ&quot;, &quot;Jeune noir à l&#x27;épée (Black youth with a sword)&quot;, &quot;The Reading Lesson&quot;, and &quot;Portrait of a Man&quot;.

== Work ==

Puvis de Chavannes&#x27;s work is seen as symbolist in nature, even though he studied with some of the romanticists, and he is credited with influencing an entire generation of painters and sculptors, particularly the works of the Modernists. One of his protégés was Georges de Feure.

=== Mural work ===

Puvis de Chavannes is best known for his mural painting, and came to be known as &#x27;the painter for France.&#x27; His first commission was for his brother&#x27;s chateau, Le Brouchy, a medieval-style structure near Cuiseaux in Saône-et-Loire. The principal decorations take the four seasons as their theme. His first public commissions came early in the 1860s, with work at the Musée de Picardie at Amiens. The first four works were &quot;Concordia&quot; (1861), &quot;Bellum&quot; (1861), &quot;Le Travail&quot; (Work; 1863) and &quot;Le Repos&quot; (Rest; 1863). Between 1883 and 1886 he painted a mural for the Museum of Fine Arts in Lyon. 

==== The regions ====
Over the course of his career, Puvis received a substantial number of commissions for works to be carried out in public and private institutions throughout France. His early work at the Musée de Picardie had helped him to develop his classicizing style, and the decorative aesthetic of his mural works.

Among his public works are the later cycles completed at Amiens (&quot;Ave Picardia Nutrix&quot;, 1865), at Marseille, at Lyon and at Poitiers. Of particular importance is the cycle at the Palais de Beaux Arts in Lyon, which includes three significant works, filling the wall space in the main staircase. From left to right, the works are &quot;Antique Vision&quot; (1884), &quot;The Wood Dear to the Arts and the Muses&quot; (1884), and &quot;Christian Inspiration&quot; (1884).

==== Paris ====

Puvis&#x27; career was tied up with a complicated debate that had been ongoing since the beginning of the Third Republic (1870), and at the end of the violence of the Paris Commune. The question at stake was the identity of France and the meaning of &#x27;Frenchness&#x27;. Royalists felt that the revolution of 1789 had been an immense disaster and that France had been thrown off course, while the Republicans felt that the Revolution had allowed France to revert to its true course. Consequently, works that were to be displayed in public spaces, such as murals, had the important task of fulfilling the ideology of the commissioning party. Many scholars of Puvis&#x27;s works have noted that his success as a &#x27;painter for France&#x27; was largely due to his ability to create works which were agreeable to the many ideologies in existence at this time.

His first Parisian commission was for a cycle at the church of Saint Genevieve, which is now the secular Pantheon, begun in 1874. His two subjects were &quot;L&#x27;Education de Sainte Geneviève&quot; and &quot;La Vie Pastoral de Sainte Geneviève&quot;. This commission was followed by works at the Sorbonne, namely the enormous hemicycle, &quot;The Sacred Grove&quot; or &quot;L&#x27;Ancienne Sorbonne&quot; amongst the muses in the Grand Amphitheater of the Sorbonne.

His final commission in this trinity of Republican commissions was the crowning glory of Puvis&#x27;s career, the works &quot;Summer&quot; and &quot;Winter&quot;, at the (City Hall) in Paris.

Many of these works are characterized by their nod to classical art, visible in the careful balanced compositions, and the subject matter is frequently a direct reference to visions of Hellenistic Greece, particularly in the case of &quot;Antique Vision&quot;.

=== Works on canvas ===
Puvis de Chavannes was president and co-founder in 1890 of the &quot;Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts&quot; (&quot;National Society of Fine Arts&quot;) founded in Paris. It became the dominant salon of art at the time and held exhibitions of contemporary art that was selected only by a jury composed of the officers of the Société.
Those who translated best the spirit of the work of Puvis de Chavannes in their own creations were, in Germany, the painter Ludwig von Hofmann and in France, Auguste Rodin.

His easel paintings also may be found in many American and European galleries. Some of these paintings are:

*&quot;Death and the Maiden&quot;
*&quot;The Dream&quot;
*&quot;The Poor Fisherman&quot;, 1881, oil on canvas
*&quot;Vigilance&quot;
*&quot;The Meditation&quot;
*&quot;Mary Magdalene at Saint Baume&quot;
*&quot;Saint Genoveva&quot;
*&quot;Young Girls at the Seaside&quot;, 1879, oil on canvas
*&quot;Mad Woman at the Edge of the Sea&quot;
*&quot;Hope&quot;
*&quot;Hope (nude)&quot;
*&quot;Kneeling nude woman, viewed from back&quot;
*&quot;The Sacred Grove&quot;

As far as the appreciation of his life&#x27;s work is concerned, Puvis de Chavannes was never properly understood by his contemporaries. At the beginning of his career, art criticism was divided into two camps. Adored by the idealists, he was despised by the partisans of the realists. Only with the advent of Symbolism did these two camps unite, but without achieving a convincing appreciation of the painter. Today&#x27;s research has inherited this contradiction of art criticism and therefore still does not offer a convincing presentation of Puvis de Chavanne&#x27;s art.

== Personal life ==
In Montmartre, he had an affair with one of his models, Suzanne Valadon, who would become one of the leading artists of the day as well as the mother, teacher, and mentor of Maurice Utrillo. From 1856, he was in a relationship with the Romanian princess, Marie Cantacuzène. The couple were together for 40 years, and were married before their deaths in 1898.

==Puvis de Chavannes Prize==
Beginning in 1926, The &quot;Prix Puvis de Chavannes&quot; (Puvis de Chavannes prize) was awarded by the National Society of Fine Arts (&quot;Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts&quot;). The &quot;Prix Puvis de Chavannes&quot; is the retrospective exhibition in Paris of the main works of the artist awarded the prize that year.

<text>The ERA 1101, later renamed UNIVAC 1101, was a computer system designed and built by Engineering Research Associates (ERA) in the early 1950s and continued to be sold by the Remington Rand corporation after that company later purchased ERA. Its (initial) military model, the ERA Atlas, was the first stored-program computer that was moved from its site of manufacture and successfully installed at a distant site. Remington Rand used the 1101&#x27;s architecture as the basis for a series of machines into the 1960s.

==History==
===Codebreaking===
ERA was formed from a group of code-breakers working for the United States Navy during World War II. The team had built a number of code-breaking machines, similar to the more famous Colossus computer in England, but designed to attack Japanese codes. After the war the Navy was interested in keeping the team together even though they had to formally be turned out of Navy service. The result was ERA, which formed in St. Paul, Minnesota in the hangars of a former Chase Aircraft shadow factory.

After the war, the team continued to build codebreaking machines, targeted at specific codes. After one of these codes changed, making an expensive computer obsolete, the team convinced the Navy that the only way to make a system that would remain useful was to build a fully programmable computer. The Navy agreed, and in 1947 they funded development of a new system under &quot;Task 13&quot;.

The resulting machines, known as &quot;Atlas&quot;, used drum memory for main memory and featured a simple central processing unit built for integer math. The first Atlas machine was built, moved, and installed at the Army Security Agency by December 1950. A faster version using Williams tubes and drums was delivered to the NSA in 1953.

===Commercialization===
The company turned to the task of selling the systems commercially. Atlas was named after a character in the popular comic strip &quot;Barnaby&quot;, and they initially decided to name the commercial versions &quot;Mabel&quot;. Jack Hill suggested &quot;1101&quot; instead; 1101 is the binary representation of the number 13. The ERA 1101 was publicly announced in December 1951. Atlas II, slightly modified became the ERA 1103, while a more heavily modified version with core memory and floating point math support became the UNIVAC 1103A.

At about this time the company became embroiled in a lengthy series of political maneuverings in Washington, D.C. Drew Pearson&#x27;s &quot;Washington Merry-Go-Round&quot; claimed that the founding of ERA was a conflict of interest for Norris and Engstrom because they had used their war-time government connections to set up a company for their own profit. The resulting legal fight left the company drained, both financially and emotionally. In 1952 they were purchased by Remington Rand, largely as a result of these problems.

Remington Rand had recently purchased Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation, builders of the famed UNIVAC I, the first commercial computer in the US. Although ERA and UNIVAC were run separately within the company, looking to cash in on the UNIVAC&#x27;s well known name, they renamed the machine to become the &quot;UNIVAC 1101&quot;. A series of machines based on the same basic design followed, and were sold into the 1960s before being replaced by the similar-in-name-only UNIVAC 1100 family.

==Description==

This computer was long, wide, weighed about and used 2700 vacuum tubes for its logic circuits. Its drum memory was in diameter, rotated at 3500 rpm, had 200 read-write heads, and held 16,384 24-bit words (a memory size equivalent to 48 kB) with access time between 32 microseconds and 17 milliseconds.

Instructions were 24 bits long, with six bits for the opcode, four bits for the &quot;skip&quot; value (telling how many memory locations to skip to get to the next instruction in program sequence), and 14 bits for the memory address. Numbers were binary with negative values in ones&#x27; complement. The addition time was 96 microseconds and the multiplication time was 352 microseconds.

The single 48-bit accumulator was fundamentally subtractive, addition being carried out by subtracting the ones&#x27; complement of the number to be added. This may appear rather strange, but the &quot;subtractive adder&quot; reduces the chance of getting negative zero in normal operations.

The machine had 38 instructions.

<doc id="164381" wikidata="Q214973" url="?curid=164381" title="...And Justice for All (album)">
<text>...And Justice for All is the fourth studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on August 25, 1988, by Elektra Records. It was Metallica&#x27;s first full length studio (LP) album to feature bassist Jason Newsted, following the death of their previous bassist Cliff Burton in 1986. Burton received posthumous co-writing credit on &quot;To Live Is to Die&quot; as Newsted followed bass lines Burton had recorded prior to his death.

Metallica recorded the album with producer Flemming Rasmussen over four months in early 1988 at One on One Recording Studios in Los Angeles. It features aggressive complexity, fast tempos, and few verse-chorus structures. It contains lyrical themes of political and legal injustices, such as governmental corruption, censorship, and war. The cover, designed by Roger Gorman with illustration by Stephen Gorman and based on a concept by Metallica guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, depicts Lady Justice bound in ropes, being pulled by them to the point of breaking, with dollar bills piled upon and falling off her scales. The album title is derived from the last four words of the American Pledge of Allegiance. Three of its songs were released as singles: &quot;Harvester of Sorrow&quot;, &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot;, and &quot;One&quot;; the title track, &quot;...And Justice for All&quot;, was released as a promotional single.

&quot;...And Justice for All&quot; was acclaimed by music critics for its depth and complexity, although its dry mix and nearly inaudible bass guitar were criticized. It was included in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll of the year&#x27;s best albums, and was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1989, controversially losing out to Jethro Tull in the Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental category. The single &quot;One&quot; backed the band&#x27;s debut music video, and earned Metallica their first Grammy Award in 1990 (and the first ever in the Best Metal Performance category). It was successful in the United States, peaking at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was certified 8× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2003 for shipping eight million copies in the U.S.

The album was reissued on November 2, 2018, in vinyl, CD, and cassette formats, as well as receiving a deluxe box set treatment with bonus tracks and unreleased video footage. The reissue reached number 37 and 42 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Album Sales and Top Rock Albums charts, respectively.

==Background==
&quot;...And Justice for All&quot; is the first Metallica album to feature bassist Jason Newsted after the death of Cliff Burton in 1986; Newsted had previously played on the 1987 Metallica EP&quot; The $5.98 E.P. - Garage Days Re-Revisited&quot;. Metallica had intended to record the album earlier, but was sidetracked by the large number of festival dates scheduled for the summer of 1987, including the European leg of the Monsters of Rock festival. Another reason was frontman James Hetfield&#x27;s arm injury in a skateboarding accident.

Metallica&#x27;s previous studio album, &quot;Master of Puppets (&quot;1986), was their last under their contract with the record label Music for Nations. Manager Peter Mensch wanted them to sign with British record distributor Phonogram Records. Phonogram manager Martin Hooker offered them &quot;well over £1 million, which at that time was the biggest deal we&#x27;d ever offered anyone&quot;. His explanation was that the final figure for combined British and European sales of all three Metallica albums was more than 1.5 million copies.

==Recording==
&quot;...And Justice for All&quot; was recorded from January to May 1988 at One on One Recording Studios in Los Angeles. Metallica produced the album with Flemming Rasmussen. He had been initially unavailable for the planned start on January 1, 1988, and the band hired Mike Clink, who had caught their attention for producing the debut Guns N&#x27; Roses album &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; (1987). Plans deteriorated, and Rasmussen became available three weeks after drummer Lars Ulrich had first called him. Rasmussen listened to Clink&#x27;s rough mixes for the album on his February 14 flight to Los Angeles, and upon his arrival, Clink was fired. Hetfield explained that recording with Clink had been problematic, and Rasmussen was a last-minute replacement. Clink is credited with engineering drums on &quot;The Shortest Straw&quot; and &quot;Harvester of Sorrow&quot;. Awaiting Rasmussen&#x27;s arrival, the band had recorded two cover songs—&quot;Breadfan&quot; and &quot;The Prince&quot;—to &quot;fine‑tune the sound while they got into the studio vibe&quot;. Both were released as B-sides for singles from the album and were later included on the 1998 cover album &quot;Garage Inc&quot;.

Rasmussen&#x27;s first task was to adjust and arrange the guitar sound, with which the band was dissatisfied. A guide track for the tempos and a click track for Ulrich&#x27;s drumming were used. The band played in a live room, recording the instruments separately. Each song used three reels: one for drums, a second for bass and guitars, and a third for other parts. Hetfield wrote lyrics during the recording sessions; these were occasionally unfinished as recording began, and Rasmussen said that Hetfield &quot;wasn&#x27;t really interested in singing&quot; but instead &quot;wanted that hard vibe&quot;. Metallica&#x27;s recording process was new to Newsted, who questioned his impact on the overall sound and the lack of discussion with the rest of the team. He recorded his parts separately, with only the assistant engineer present. The experience differed from his previous band, Flotsam and Jetsam, whose style he described as &quot;basically everybody playing the same thing like a sonic wall&quot;.

===Mixing===
&quot;...And Justice for All&quot; is noted for its &quot;dry, sterile&quot; production. Rasmussen said that was not his intention, as he tried for an ambient sound similar to the previous two albums. He was not present during the album&#x27;s mixing, for which Steve Thompson and Michael Barbiero had been hired beforehand. Rasmussen assumed that, in his absence from the mixing process, Thompson and Barbiero used only the close microphones on the mix and none of the room microphones, causing the &quot;clicking&quot;, thin drum sound. The bass guitar is nearly inaudible, while the guitars sound &quot;strangled mechanistic&quot;. He saw the &quot;synthetic&quot; percussion as another reason for the compressed sound.

At the instruction of Hetfield and Ulrich, Newsted&#x27;s bass guitar was made almost inaudible. According to Rasmussen: &quot;After Lars and James heard their initial mixes the first thing they said was, &#x27;Take the bass down so you can just hear it, and then once you&#x27;ve done that, take it down a further three dBs.&#x27; I have no idea why they wanted that, but it was totally out of my hands.&quot; In 2009, Hetfield said that the bass was obscured as the basslines often doubled his rhythm guitar, making the instruments indiscernible, and because the low frequencies were competing with his &quot;scooped&quot; guitar sound.

Newsted was not satisfied with the final mix and was unhappy that the bass was inaudible. Thompson was also unhappy, and blamed Ulrich for the decision; he tried to quit the project, but was blocked by management. Rasmussen said in 2018: &quot;I&#x27;m probably one of the only people in the world, including Jason and Toby Wright, the assistant engineer, who &quot;heard&quot; the bass tracks on &quot;And Justice for All&quot;, and they are fucking brilliant.&quot;

In 2019, Hetfield and Ulrich said they had mixed the bass low not to belittle Newsted, but because their hearing was &quot;shot&quot; following heavy touring and so they &quot;basically kept turning everything else up until the bass disappeared&quot;. They decided not to adjust the mix for the remastered 2018 reissue, saying: &quot;These records are a product of a certain time in life; they&#x27;re snapshots of history and they&#x27;re part of our story &quot;... And Justice for All&quot; could use a little more low end and &quot;St. Anger&quot; could use a little less tin snare drum, but those things are what make those records part of our history.&quot;

==Music==

&quot;...And Justice for All&quot; is a musically progressive album featuring long and complex songs, fast tempos and few verse-chorus structures. Metallica decided to broaden its sonic range, writing songs with multiple sections, heavy guitar arpeggios and unusual time signatures. Hetfield explained: &quot;Songwriting-wise, [the album] was just us really showing off and trying to show what we could do. &#x27;We&#x27;ve jammed six riffs into one song? Let&#x27;s make it eight. Let&#x27;s go crazy with it.&#x27;&quot;

Critic Simon Reynolds noted the riff changes and experimentation with timing on the album&#x27;s intricately constructed songs: &quot;The tempo shifts, gear changes, lapses, decelerations and abrupt halts&quot;. BBC Music&#x27;s Eamonn Stack wrote that &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; sounds different from the band&#x27;s previous albums, with longer songs, sparser arrangements, and harsher vocals by Hetfield. According to journalist Martin Popoff, the album is less melodic than its predecessors because of its frequent tempo changes, unusual song structures and layered guitars. He argued that the album is more of a progressive metal record because of its intricately performed music and bleak sound. Music writer Joel McIver called the album&#x27;s music aggressive enough for Metallica to maintain its place with bands &quot;at the mellower end of extreme metal&quot;. According to writer Christopher Knowles, Metallica took &quot;the thrash concept to its logical conclusion&quot; on the album.

==Lyrics==
The album title was revealed in April 1988: &quot;...And Justice for All&quot;, after the final words of the Pledge of Allegiance. The lyrics address political and legal injustice as seen through the prism of war (including nuclear war) and censored speech. The majority of the songs raise issues that differ from the violent retaliation of the previous releases. Tom King writes that for the first time the lyrics dealt with political and environmental issues. He named contemporaries Nuclear Assault as the only other band who applied ecological lyrics to thrash metal songs rather than singing about Satan and Egyptian plagues. McIver noted that Hetfield, the band&#x27;s main lyricist, wrote about topics that he had not addressed before, such as his revolt against the establishment. Ulrich described the songwriting process as their &quot;CNN years&quot;, with him and Hetfield watching the channel in search for song subjects—&quot;I&#x27;d read about the blacklisting thing, we&#x27;d get a title, &#x27;The Shortest Straw,&#x27; and a song would come out of that.&quot;

Concerns about the state of the environment (&quot;Blackened&quot;), corruption (&quot;...And Justice for All&quot;), and blacklisting and discrimination (&quot;The Shortest Straw&quot;) are emphasized with traditional existential themes. Issues such as freedom of speech and civil liberties (&quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot;) are presented from a grim and pessimistic point of view. &quot;One&quot; was unofficially nicknamed an &quot;antiwar anthem&quot; for its lyrics, which portray the suffering of a wounded soldier. &quot;Dyers Eve&quot; is a lyrical rant from Hetfield to his parents. Burton received co-writing credit on &quot;To Live Is to Die&quot; as the bass line is a medley of unused recordings Burton had performed prior to his death. Because the original recordings are not used on the track, the composition is credited as written by Burton and played by Newsted. The spoken word section of the song was erroneously attributed in its entirety to Burton in the liner notes. The first line was actually from the film &quot;Excalibur&quot; (&quot;When a man lies, he murders some part of the world.&quot;) while the second line comes from &quot;Lord Foul&#x27;s Bane&quot;, a fantasy novel by American writer Stephen R. Donaldson (&quot;These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives.&quot;). The second half of the speech (&quot;All this I cannot bear to witness any longer. Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home?&quot;) was written by Burton.

==Artwork==
The artwork was created by Stephen Gorman, based on a concept developed by Hetfield and Ulrich. It depicts a cracked statue of a blindfolded Lady Justice, bound by ropes with her breasts exposed and her scales overflowing with dollar bills, with the title in graffiti style.

==Critical reception==
Released on August 25, 1988, by Elektra Records, &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; was acclaimed by music critics. In a contemporary review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Michael Azerrad said that Metallica&#x27;s compositions are impressive and called the album&#x27;s music &quot;a marvel of precisely channeled aggression&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s Sharon Liveten called it a &quot;gem of a double record&quot; and found the music both edgy and technically proficient. Simon Reynolds, writing in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, said that &quot;other bands would &quot; for the songs&#x27; riffs and found the album&#x27;s densely complicated style of metal to be distinct from the monotonous sound of contemporary rock music: &quot;Everything depends on utter punctuality and supreme surgical finesse. It&#x27;s probably the most incisive music I&#x27;ve ever heard, in the literal sense of the word.&quot; Borivoj Krgin of &quot;Metal Forces&quot; said that it was the most ideal album he has heard because of typically exceptional production and musicianship that is more impressive than that of &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;. In a less enthusiastic review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau believed that the band&#x27;s compositions lack song form and that the album &quot;goes on longer&quot; than &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;. In 1988, &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance, but controversially lost to Jethro Tull&#x27;s &quot;Crest of a Knave&quot;. In 2007, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, named this one of the 10 biggest upsets in Grammy history.

In a retrospective review, Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said that &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; was both the band&#x27;s &quot;most ambitious&quot; and ultimately &quot;flattest-sounding&quot; album. AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey noted that Metallica followed the blueprint of the previous two albums, with more sophisticated songs and &quot;apocalyptic&quot; lyrics that envisioned a society in decay. Music journalist Mick Wall was critical of the progressive elements on the album and believed that, apart from &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Dyers Eve&quot;, most of the album sounded clumsy. Colin Larkin, writing in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; (2006), noted that, apart from the praiseworthy &quot;One&quot;, the album diminished the band&#x27;s creativity by concentrating the songs with too many riffs. Ulrich said in retrospect that the album has improved with time and it is well-liked among their contemporaries.

===Accolades===
In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, it was voted the 39th best album of 1988, having received 117 points within 12 top-ten votes. The album was ranked at number nine on IGN&#x27;s &quot;Top 25 Metal Albums&quot;. &quot;Guitar World&quot; lists all of its tracks on &quot;The 100 Greatest Metallica Songs of All Time&quot;. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; listed the album at number 42 among the &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. Martin Popoff ranks it at number 19 in his book &quot;The Top 500 Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot;, the fourth highest ranked Metallica album on the list. It is featured in Robert Dimery&#x27;s &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2017, it was ranked 21st on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

After years of refusing to release music videos, Metallica released its first for &quot;One&quot;. The video was controversial among fans, who had valued the band&#x27;s apparent opposition to MTV and other forms of mainstream music. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; ranked it number 48 on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Music Videos&quot;, saying that Metallica &quot;evoke a revolution of the soul far more devastating than that presented in the original text&quot;. The guitar solo was ranked number seven in &quot;Guitar World&quot;″s compilation of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Solos&quot; of all time. Additionally, heavy metal website Noisecreep classed the song ninth among the &quot;10 Best &#x27;80s Metal Songs&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
Although Metallica&#x27;s music was considered unappealing for mainstream radio, &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; was highly successful in the US. It became Metallica&#x27;s best-selling album upon release, peaking at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, where it charted for 83 weeks. More than 9,700,000 copies have been sold in the United States since 1991, when Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales. It was certified platinum nine weeks after it was released in stores, and 1.7 million copies were sold in the US by the end of 1988. Since its release, the album has scanned more than 8 million copies in the US and, according to MTV&#x27;s Chris Harris, &quot;helped cement [Metallica&#x27;s] status as a rock and roll force to be reckoned with&quot;. &quot;Classic Rock&quot; explained that with this album, Metallica received substantial media exposure, becoming a multi-platinum act by 1990. The group broke through on radio in early 1989 with &quot;One&quot;, which was released as the third single from the record. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, the accompanying Damaged Justice tour evolved the band into arena headliners, while significant airplay was garnered by &quot;One&quot; and by the group&#x27;s first music video.

&quot;...And Justice for All&quot; achieved similar chart success outside the United States. It topped the charts in Finland, peaked within the top 5 on the charts in Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, and remained on the UK chart for six weeks. The album managed to peak in the top 10 on the Norwegian and Swiss album charts, as well as in Spain. It was less successful in Mexico and France, where it peaked at number 92 on the former chart, number 130 on the latter. &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; received a three times platinum certification from Music Canada for shipping 300,000 copies, a platinum certification from IFPI Finland for having a shipment of little over 50,000 copies, and was certified gold by the (BVMI) for shipments of 250,000 copies. It was awarded gold by the British Phonographic Industry in 2013 for shipping 100,000 copies in the UK. &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; was surpassed commercially by the band&#x27;s following album, &quot;Metallica&quot; (1991).

==Live performances==

Guitarist Kirk Hammett noted that the length of the songs was problematic for fans and for the band: &quot;Touring behind it, we realized that the general consensus was that songs were too fucking long. One day after we played &quot;Justice&quot; and got off the stage one of us said, &#x27;we&#x27;re never fucking playing that song again. Nevertheless, &quot;One&quot; quickly became a permanent fixture in the band&#x27;s setlist. When performed live, the opening war sound is lengthened from seventeen seconds to approximately two minutes. At the song&#x27;s conclusion, the stage turns pitch-black and fire erupts from around the stage. The live performance is characterized as a &quot;musical and visual highlight&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist Denise Sheppard. Other songs from &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; that have frequently been performed are &quot;Blackened&quot; and &quot;Harvester of Sorrow&quot;, which were often featured during the album&#x27;s promotional Damaged Justice Tour.

Metallica played the title track in the opening show of the Sick of the Studio &#x27;07 tour, for the first time since October 1989, and made it a set-fixture for the remainder of that tour. A statue of Lady Justice is commonly placed on the scene, to be torn down as the song approaches its conclusion. In 2009, &quot;The Shortest Straw&quot; returned to the setlist during the World Magnetic Tour after a 12-year absence, and has been sporadically performed since. &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; has not been played live since 1989; one such performance appears on Metallica&#x27;s live extended play &quot;Six Feet Down Under&quot;. &quot;Dyers Eve&quot; debuted live in 2004, sixteen years after it was recorded, during the Madly in Anger with the World Tour at The Forum in Inglewood, California. &quot;To Live Is to Die&quot; premiered at the band&#x27;s 30th-anniversary concert in 2011 at The Fillmore in San Francisco. &quot;The Frayed Ends of Sanity&quot;, the last song on the album to be performed live, debuted live in Helsinki on the Metallica By Request tour in 2014, although the band had previously played segments during solos, impromptu jams, or in a &quot;Justice&quot; medley.

<doc id="164382" wikidata="Q154444" url="?curid=164382" title="Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia">
<text>Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia (; 13 June 1918) was the youngest son and fifth child of Emperor Alexander III of Russia and youngest brother of Nicholas II. He was de jure Emperor of Russia after his brother Nicholas II abdicated in 1917 and proclaimed his brother &quot;Emperor Michael II&quot;, but Michael declined to take power a day later.

Michael was born during the reign of his paternal grandfather, Alexander II. He was then fourth in line to the throne after his father and elder brothers Nicholas and George. After the assassination of his grandfather in 1881, he became third in line and, in 1894, after the death of his father, second in line. George died in 1899, leaving Michael as heir presumptive to Nicholas II.

The birth of Nicholas&#x27;s son Alexei in 1904 moved Michael back to second in line, but Alexei was gravely ill with hemophilia and Michael suspected the boy would die, leaving him as heir. Michael caused a commotion at the imperial court when he took Natalia Sergeyevna Wulfert, a married woman, as a lover. Nicholas sent Michael to Orel to avoid scandal but this did not deter Michael, who travelled frequently to see his mistress. After the couple&#x27;s only child, George, was born in 1910, Michael brought Natalia to Saint Petersburg, where she was shunned by society. In 1912, Michael shocked Nicholas by marrying Natalia in the hope that he would be removed from the line of succession. Michael and Natalia left Russia to live in exile abroad in France, Switzerland and England.

After the outbreak of World War I, Michael returned to Russia, assuming command of a cavalry division. When Nicholas abdicated on , Michael was named as his successor instead of Alexei. Michael, however, deferred acceptance of the throne until ratification by an elected assembly. He was never confirmed as emperor and, following the Russian Revolution of 1917, he was imprisoned and murdered.

==Early life==
Michael was born at Anichkov Palace on Nevsky Prospekt in Saint Petersburg as the youngest son and penultimate child of Tsesarevich Alexander of Russia and his wife, Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark). His maternal grandparents were King Christian IX of Denmark and Louise of Hesse-Kassel. His paternal grandmother Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse) died before his second birthday. His paternal grandfather, Emperor Alexander II of Russia, was assassinated on 1 March 1881 and, as a result, Michael&#x27;s parents became Emperor and Empress of All the Russias before his third birthday. After the assassination, the new Tsar Alexander III moved his family, including Michael, to the greater safety of Gatchina Palace, which was 29 miles southwest of Saint Petersburg and surrounded by a moat.

Michael was raised in the company of his younger sister, Olga, who nicknamed him &quot;Floppy&quot; because he &quot;flopped&quot; into chairs; his elder siblings and parents called him &quot;Misha&quot;. Conditions in the nursery were modest, even spartan. The children slept on hard camp beds, rose at dawn, washed in cold water and ate a simple porridge for breakfast. Michael, like his siblings, was taught by private tutors and was cared for by an English nanny, Mrs. Elizabeth Franklin.

Michael and Olga frequently went on hikes in the forests around Gatchina with their father, who took the opportunity to teach them woodsmanship. Physical activities such as equestrianism were also taught at an early age, as was religious observance. Though Christmas and Easter were times of celebration and extravagance, Lent was strictly observed—meat, dairy products and any form of entertainment were avoided. Family holidays were taken in the summer at Peterhof Palace and with Michael&#x27;s grandparents in Denmark.

Michael was almost 16 when his father fell fatally ill; the annual trip to Denmark was cancelled. On 1 November 1894, Alexander III died at the untimely age of 49. Michael&#x27;s eldest brother, Nicholas, became Tsar, and Michael&#x27;s childhood was effectively over.

==Military career and public duties==
Michael&#x27;s mother, Dowager Empress Marie, moved back to Anichkov Palace with Michael and Olga. Like most male members of his family, Michael was enrolled in the military. He completed training at a gunnery school and joined the Horse Guards Artillery. In November 1898, he attained legal adulthood and, just eight months later, became heir presumptive to Nicholas as the middle brother, George, was killed in a motorcycle accident. George&#x27;s death and the subsequent change in the line of succession highlighted that Nicholas lacked a son. As the succession was limited to males, his three daughters were ineligible. When Nicholas&#x27;s wife, Alexandra, became pregnant in 1900 she hoped that the child would be male. She manoeuvred to get herself declared regent for her unborn child in the event of Nicholas&#x27;s death, but the government disagreed and determined that Michael would succeed regardless of the unborn child&#x27;s gender. She was delivered of a fourth daughter the following year.

Michael was perceived as unremarkable, quiet and good-natured. He performed the usual public duties expected of an heir to the throne. In 1901, he represented Russia at the funeral of Queen Victoria and was given the Order of the Bath. The following year he was made a Knight of the Garter in King Edward VII&#x27;s coronation honours. In June 1902, Michael transferred to the Blue Cuirassier Regiment and moved to Gatchina, where the regiment was based. Since coming of age, Michael had assumed financial independence. His assets included the largest sugar refinery in the country, capital amounting to millions of roubles, a collection of motor vehicles, and country estates at Otrovo in Russian Poland and Brasovo near Orel.

Michael was heir presumptive until 12 August 1904, when the birth of Tsarevich Alexei to Nicholas and Alexandra provided an heir apparent. Michael again became second-in-line to the throne, but was named as co-regent for the boy, along with Alexandra, in the event of Nicholas&#x27;s death.

==Romances==
In 1902, Michael met Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. They fell in love and began to correspond in her native English. Michael spoke both French and English fluently. At first it seemed they would marry; however, the Eastern Orthodox Church prohibited the marriage of first cousins, and Michael&#x27;s father and Beatrice&#x27;s mother were siblings. Nicholas refused to permit the marriage and, to Michael&#x27;s and Beatrice&#x27;s mutual dismay, their romance ended.

Michael&#x27;s attention turned to Alexandra Kossikovskaya (September 1875, Orel region – 1923, Berlin), known affectionately as &quot;Dina&quot;, who was his sister Olga&#x27;s lady-in-waiting. Dina&#x27;s father, Vladimir Kossikovsky, was a lawyer and Dina was a commoner. Michael rejected the notion, proposed by his friends, that he keep her as a mistress, and in July 1906, he wrote to Nicholas asking permission to marry her. Nicholas and Dowager Empress Marie were appalled. Both felt that royalty should marry royalty and, according to Russian house law, any children of a marriage between a royal and a commoner would be ineligible for the succession. Nicholas threatened to revoke Michael&#x27;s army commission and exile him from Russia if he married without his permission. Marie had Dina dismissed as Olga&#x27;s lady-in-waiting and took Michael to Denmark until mid-September.

Shortly after his return to Russia, three British newspapers announced on 24 September 1906 that Michael was to marry Princess Patricia of Connaught, but neither he nor Patricia knew anything about it. Buckingham Palace issued a denial. Nevertheless, two years later, in October 1908, Michael visited London, and he and Patricia were &quot;paired&quot; at social engagements. It seems likely that Michael&#x27;s mother was plotting to get him married to a more suitable bride and the originator of the false report, Reuters correspondent Guy Beringer, read too much into the plans. Michael and Dina were planning to elope, but their plans were stymied as Dina was under surveillance by the Okhrana, Nicholas&#x27;s secret police, and she was prevented from travelling. Under family pressure and unable to see Dina, by August 1907 Michael appeared to be losing interest. Dina went to live abroad. She never married and believed herself to be Michael&#x27;s rightful fiancée, but their romance was over.

In early December 1907, Michael was introduced to Natalia Sergeyevna Wulfert, the wife of a fellow officer, and from 1908 they began a deep friendship. Natalia was a commoner who had a daughter from her first marriage. By August 1909, they were lovers, and, by November 1909, Natalia was living apart from her second husband in an apartment in Moscow paid for by Michael. In an attempt to prevent scandal, Nicholas transferred Michael to the Chernigov Hussars at Orel, 250 miles from Moscow, but Michael travelled from there several times a month to see Natalia. Their only child, George (named after Michael&#x27;s dead brother) was born in July 1910, before her divorce from her second husband was finalised. To ensure that the child could be recognised as his, rather than Wulfert&#x27;s, Michael had the date of the divorce back-dated. Nicholas issued a decree giving the boy the surname &quot;Brasov&quot;, taken from Michael&#x27;s estate at Brasovo, which was a tacit acknowledgement that Michael was the father.

In May 1911, Nicholas permitted Natalia to move from Moscow to Brasovo and granted her the surname &quot;Brasova&quot;. In May 1912, Michael went to Copenhagen for the funeral of his uncle King Frederik VIII of Denmark, where he fell ill with a stomach ulcer that was to trouble him for years afterwards. After a holiday in France, where he and Natalia were trailed by the Okhrana, Michael was transferred back to Saint Petersburg to command the Chevalier Gardes. He took Natalia to the capital with him and set her up in an apartment, but she was shunned by society and, within a few months, he had moved her to a villa in Gatchina.

==Marriage==

In September 1912, Michael and Natalia spent a holiday abroad and, as usual, they were trailed by the Okhrana. In Berlin, Michael announced that he and Natalia would drive to Cannes and instructed his staff to follow by train. The Okhrana was under instructions to follow by train rather than car, so Michael and Natalia would be unaccompanied on their journey south. Michael&#x27;s journey was a deliberate ruse. On the way to Cannes, the couple diverted to Vienna, where they were married on 16 October 1912 by Father Misitsch at the Serbian Orthodox Church of Saint Sava. A few days later, after travelling through Venice and Milan, they arrived at Cannes, where George and Natalia&#x27;s daughter from her first marriage joined them. Two weeks after the marriage, Michael wrote to his mother and brother to inform them. They were both horrified by Michael&#x27;s action. His mother said it was &quot;unspeakably awful in every way&quot;, and his brother was shocked that his brother had &quot;broken his word ... that he would not marry her&quot;.

Nicholas was particularly upset because his heir, Alexei, was gravely ill with haemophilia, which Michael cited as one of his reasons for marrying Natalia. Michael feared that he would become heir presumptive again on Alexei&#x27;s death and would never be able to marry Natalia. By marrying her beforehand, he would be removed from the line of succession early and preclude losing Natalia. In a series of decrees over December 1912 and January 1913, Nicholas relieved Michael of his command, banished him from Russia, froze all his assets in Russia, seized control of his estates and removed him from the Regency. Society in Russia was shocked at the severity of Nicholas&#x27;s reprisal, but there was little sympathy for Natalia. She was not entitled to be known as Grand Duchess; she instead used the style &quot;Madame or Countess Brasova&quot;.

For six months, they stayed in hotels in France and Switzerland without any decrease in their standard of living. They were visited by Michael&#x27;s sister Grand Duchess Xenia and cousin Grand Duke Andrew. In July 1913, they saw Michael&#x27;s mother in London, who told Natalia &quot;a few home truths&quot;, according to Xenia&#x27;s diary. After another trip to continental Europe, Michael took a one-year lease on Knebworth House, a staffed and furnished stately home 20 miles north of London. Michael&#x27;s finances were stretched as he had to rely on remittances sent from Russia at Nicholas&#x27;s command, and Nicholas still controlled all his estates and assets.

==War==

Upon the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Michael telegraphed the Emperor, requesting permission to return to Russia to serve in the army – providing his wife and son could come too. Nicholas agreed, and Michael travelled back to Saint Petersburg via Newcastle upon Tyne, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Michael had already leased Paddockhurst in Sussex, an estate larger than Knebworth, and had planned to move there on the expiry of the Knebworth lease. He moved his furniture and furnishings there. The war was not expected to last long and the couple assumed they would be moving back to England at its conclusion. In the meantime, Michael offered its use to the British military. At Saint Petersburg, renamed Petrograd in , they moved into a villa at 24 Nikolaevskaya street, Gatchina, that Michael had bought for Natalia. Natalia was not permitted to live in any of the imperial palaces.

The Grand Duke, promoted from his previous rank of colonel to major-general, received command of a newly formed division: the Caucasian Native Cavalry, which became known as the &quot;Savage Division&quot;. The appointment was perceived as a demotion because the division mostly comprised new Muslim recruits rather than the elite troops that Michael had commanded previously. The six regiments in the division were each composed of a different ethnic group: Chechens, Dagestanis, Kabardin, Tatars, Circassians and Ingush, commanded by ethnic Russian officers. The men were all volunteers, as conscription did not apply to the Caucasus. Although it was difficult to maintain discipline, they formed an effective fighting force. For his actions commanding his troops in the Carpathian mountains in January 1915 Michael earned the military&#x27;s highest honour, the Order of St. George, 4th Class. Unlike his brother the Emperor, he proved a popular military leader.

By January 1915 the horrific nature of the war had become apparent. Michael felt &quot;greatly embittered towards people in general and most of all towards those who are at the top, who hold power and allow all that horror to happen. If the question of war were decided by the people at large, I would not be so passionately averse to that great calamity.&quot; Michael confessed in a letter to his wife that he felt &quot;ashamed to face the people, i.e. the soldiers and officers, particularly when visiting field hospitals, where so much suffering is to be seen, for they might think that one is also responsible, for one is placed so high and yet has failed to prevent all that from happening and protect one&#x27;s country from this disaster.&quot;

At the start of the war, Michael wrote to Nicholas asking him to legitimise his son in order that the boy would be provided for in the event of Michael&#x27;s death at the front. Eventually Nicholas agreed to make George legitimate and granted him the style of &quot;Count Brasov&quot; by decree on 26 March 1915.

==Retreat==

By June 1915, the Russians were in retreat. When Grand Duke Constantine died that month, Michael was the only member of the imperial family absent from the funeral in Petrograd. Natalia chided him for his absence and Michael retorted that it was simply wrong for his relatives to abandon their units to attend Constantine&#x27;s funeral at such a time. The American war correspondent, Stanley Washburn, reported that Michael wore &quot;a simple uniform with nothing to indicate his rank but shoulder straps of the same material as his uniform&quot;. Michael was &quot;unaffected and democratic&quot; and &quot;living so simply in a dirty village&quot;. Natalia was appalled that Michael eschewed fancy uniforms and decorations for life at the front, but he was convinced &quot;that at such a difficult time I must serve Russia and serve here at the front&quot;.

In July 1915, Michael caught diphtheria but recovered. The war was going badly for Russia and the following month Nicholas appointed himself Supreme Commander of the Russian forces. The move was not welcomed. Nicholas&#x27;s bad decisions included instructing Michael to authorise a payment to a friend of Rasputin, an army engineer called Bratolyubov, who claimed to have invented a devastating flame-thrower. The claim was bogus and Bratolyubov was arrested for fraud, but Rasputin intervened and he was released. Michael appeared gullible and naïve; a friend of Natalia&#x27;s said he &quot;trusted everybody ... Had his wife not watched over him constantly, he would have been deceived at every step.&quot;

In October 1915, Michael regained control of his estates and assets from Nicholas and, in February 1916, was given command of the 2nd Cavalry Corps, which included the Savage Division, a Cossack division and a Don Cossack division. The slights against him by the Tsar&#x27;s retinue continued, though. When he was promoted to lieutenant-general in July 1916, unlike all other Grand Dukes who attained that rank, he was not appointed as an aide-de-camp to the Tsar with the rank of adjutant-general. Michael admitted that he &quot;always despised Petrograd high society ... no people are more devious than they are; with a few exceptions, they are all scum.&quot; Michael made no public political statements, but it was assumed that he was a liberal, like his wife, and British consul Bruce Lockhart thought he &quot;would have made an excellent constitutional monarch&quot;.

Throughout the summer of 1916, Michael&#x27;s corps was involved in the Brusilov Offensive. The Guards Army suffered heavy losses under the incompetent leadership of Michael&#x27;s uncle, Grand Duke Paul, who was removed from command. In contrast, Michael was awarded a second gallantry medal, the Order of St. Vladimir with Swords, for his part in actions against the enemy and was belatedly made an adjutant-general. The poor progress of the war and their almost constant separation depressed both Michael and Natalia. Michael was still suffering from stomach ulcers and, in October 1916, he was ordered to take leave in the Crimea.

Before leaving for his sister Xenia&#x27;s estate at Ai-Todor, 12 miles from Yalta, he wrote a candid letter to his brother warning him that the political situation was tense:
==Increasing public unrest==

Michael and other members of the imperial family, including Grand Dukes Alexander, George, Nicholas and Dmitri and Grand Duchess Elizabeth, warned of the growing public unrest, and of the perception that Nicholas was governed by his German-born wife Alexandra and the self-styled holy man Rasputin. Nicholas and Alexandra refused to listen. In December 1916, Dmitri and four of his friends killed Rasputin. Michael learned of the murder at Brasovo, where he was spending Christmas with his family. On 28 December, according to the French ambassador, there was a failed attempt to assassinate Alexandra; the lone assailant was caught and hanged the next day. The Duma President Mikhail Rodzianko, Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna and British ambassador Buchanan joined calls for Alexandra to be removed from influence, but Nicholas still refused to take their advice. Plots and gossip against Nicholas and Alexandra continued to build.

In January 1917, Michael returned to the front to hand over command of his corps; from 29 January he was Inspector-General of Cavalry stationed at Gatchina. General Aleksei Brusilov, Michael&#x27;s commander on the south-eastern front, begged him to tell the Tsar of &quot;the need for immediate and drastic reforms&quot;, but Michael warned him, &quot;I have no influence ... My brother has time and time again had warnings and entreaties of this kind from every quarter.&quot; Brusilov recorded in his memoirs, &quot;[Michael] was an absolutely honourable and upright man, taking no sides and lending himself to no intrigues ... he shunned every kind of gossip, whether connected with the services or with family matters. As a soldier, he was an excellent leader and an unassuming and conscientious worker.&quot;

Through February, Grand Duke Alexander, Duma President Rodzianko and Michael pressured Nicholas and Alexandra to yield to popular demands. Public unrest grew and, on 27 February, soldiers in Petrograd joined demonstrators, elements of the military mutinied and prisoners were freed. Nicholas, who was at army headquarters in Mogilev, prorogued the Duma, but the deputies refused to leave and instead set up their own rival government. After consulting Rodzianko at the Mariinsky Palace in Petrograd, Michael advised Nicholas to dismiss his ministers and set up a new government led by the leader of the majority party in the Duma, Georgy Lvov. His advice was supported by General Mikhail Alekseyev, Nicholas&#x27;s chief of staff. Nicholas rejected the suggestion and issued futile orders for troops to move on Petrograd.

==Revolution==

On the night of 27–28 February 1917, Michael attempted to return to Gatchina from Petrograd, where he had been in conference with Rodzianko and Nikolai Golitsyn and from where he had telegraphed the Tsar, but revolutionary patrols and sporadic fire prevented his progress. Revolutionaries patrolled the streets, rounding up people connected with the old regime. Michael managed to reach the Winter Palace, where he ordered the guards to withdraw to the Admiralty, because it afforded greater safety and a better tactical position, and because it was a less politically charged location. Michael himself took refuge in the apartment of an acquaintance, Princess Putyatina, on Millionnaya street. In the neighbouring apartments, the Tsar&#x27;s Chamberlain Nikolai Stolypin and the Procurator of the Holy Synod were detained by revolutionaries and in the house next door General Baron Staekelberg was killed when his house was stormed by a mob.

On 1 March, Rodzianko sent guards to Putyatina&#x27;s apartment to ensure Michael&#x27;s safety, and Michael signed a document drawn up by Rodzianko and Grand Duke Paul proposing the creation of a constitutional monarchy. The newly formed Petrograd Soviet rejected the document, which became irrelevant. Calls for the Tsar&#x27;s abdication had superseded it.

==Abdication of Nicholas II==

On the afternoon of , Emperor Nicholas II, under pressure from generals and Duma representatives, abdicated in favour of his son, Alexei, with Michael as Regent. Later that evening, though, he reconsidered his decision. Alexei was gravely ill with haemophilia and Nicholas feared that if Alexei was emperor, he would be separated from his parents. In a second abdication document, signed at 11.40 p.m. but marked as having been issued at 3.00 p.m., the time of the earlier one, Nicholas II declared:
By early morning, Michael was proclaimed as &quot;Emperor Michael II&quot; to Russian troops and in cities throughout Russia, but his accession was not universally welcomed. While some units cheered and swore allegiance to the new emperor, others remained indifferent. The newly formed Provisional Government had not agreed to Michael&#x27;s succession. When Michael awoke that morning, he discovered not only that his brother had abdicated in his favour, as Nicholas had not informed him previously, but also that a delegation from the Duma would visit him at Putyatina&#x27;s apartment in a few hours&#x27; time. The meeting with Duma President Rodzianko, the new Prime Minister Prince Lvov and other ministers, including Pavel Milyukov and Alexander Kerensky, lasted all morning. Putyatina laid on a lunch, and in the afternoon two lawyers (Baron Nolde and Vladimir Nabokov) were called to the apartment to draft a manifesto for Michael to sign. The legal position was complicated, as the legitimacy of the government, whether Nicholas had the right to remove his son from the succession, and whether Michael actually was emperor, were all open to question. After further discussion, and several drafts, the meeting settled on a declaration of conditional acceptance as an appropriate form of words. In it, Michael deferred to the will of the people and acknowledged the Provisional Government as the &quot;de facto&quot; executive, but neither abdicated nor refused to accept the throne. He wrote:

Commentators, ranging from Kerensky to French ambassador Maurice Paléologue, regarded Michael&#x27;s action as noble and patriotic, but Nicholas was appalled that Michael had &quot;kowtowed to the Constituent Assembly&quot; and called the manifesto &quot;rubbish&quot;.

The hopes of the monarchists that Michael might be able to assume the throne following the election of the Constituent Assembly were overtaken by events. His renunciation of the throne, though conditional, marked the end of the Tsarist regime in Russia. The Provisional Government had little effective power; real power was held by the Petrograd Soviet.

==Arrest==
Michael returned to Gatchina and was not permitted to return to his unit or to travel beyond the Petrograd area. On 5 April 1917, he was discharged from military service. By July, Prince Lvov had resigned as Prime Minister to be replaced by Alexander Kerensky, who ordered ex-Emperor Nicholas removed from Petrograd to Tobolsk in the Urals because it was &quot;some remote place, some quiet corner, where they would attract less attention&quot;. On the eve of Nicholas&#x27;s departure, Kerensky gave permission for Michael to visit him. Kerensky remained present during the meeting and the brothers exchanged awkward pleasantries &quot;fidgeting all the while, and sometimes one would take hold of the other&#x27;s hand or the buttons of his uniform&quot;. It was the last time they saw each other.

On 21 August 1917, guards surrounded the villa on Nikolaevskaya street where Michael was living with Natalia. On the orders of Kerensky, they were both under house arrest, along with Nicholas Johnson, who had been Michael&#x27;s secretary since December 1912. A week later, they were moved to an apartment in Petrograd. Michael&#x27;s stomach problems worsened and, with the intervention of British ambassador Buchanan and foreign minister Mikhail Tereshchenko, they were moved back to Gatchina in the first week of September. Tereshchenko told Buchanan that the Dowager Empress would be allowed to leave the country, for Britain if she wished, and that Michael would follow in due course. The British, however, were not prepared to accept any Russian Grand Duke for fear it would provoke a negative public reaction in Britain, where there was little sympathy for the Romanovs.

On 1 September 1917, Kerensky declared Russia a republic. Michael wrote in his diary: &quot;We woke up this morning to hear Russia declared a Republic. What does it matter which form the government will be as long as there is order and justice?&quot; Two weeks later, Michael&#x27;s house arrest was lifted. Kerensky had armed the Bolsheviks after a power struggle with the commander-in-chief and in October there was a second revolution as the Bolsheviks seized power from Kerensky. With a permit to travel issued by Peter Polotsov, a former colleague of Michael from the Savage Division who was now a commander in Petrograd, Michael planned to move his family to the greater safety of Finland. They packed valuables and prepared to move, but their preparations were seen by Bolshevik sympathisers and they were placed once more under house arrest. The last of Michael&#x27;s cars were seized by the Bolsheviks.

The house arrest was lifted again in November, and the Constituent Assembly was elected and met in January 1918. Despite being the minority party, the Bolsheviks dissolved it. On 3 March 1918 (N.S.), the Bolshevik government signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which effectively ceded vast areas of the former Russian Empire to the Central Powers of Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. On 7 March 1918, Michael and his secretary Johnson were re-arrested on the orders of Moisei Uritsky, the Head of the Petrograd secret police, and imprisoned at the Bolshevik headquarters in the Smolny Institute.

==Imprisonment==

On 11 March 1918, Uritsky sent Michael and Johnson to Perm, a thousand miles to the east, on the order of the Council of the People&#x27;s Commissars, which included both Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin. The journey, by freight train in a coach without windows or heat, took eight days at an average speed of 5 miles per hour. At first, Michael was billeted in a hotel but two days after his arrival he was jailed by the local Soviet. Natalia lobbied the Commissars in Petrograd for his release and, on 9 April 1918, he was set at liberty within Perm. He moved into the best room in the best hotel in Perm, along with Johnson and two manservants, valet Vasily Chelyshev and former chauffeur Borunov. Natalia feared for George&#x27;s safety, and in March 1918, she arranged for him to be smuggled out of Russia by his governess, Margaret Neame, with the help of Danish diplomats and the Putyatins.

In May, Natalia was granted a travel permit to join Michael. Accompanied by family friends Prince Putyatin and Margaret Abakanovich, she arrived at Perm before the Orthodox Easter and they spent about a week together. Meanwhile, as part of the truce between the Bolsheviks and the Central Powers, prisoners-of-war from Austria-Hungary were being shipped out of Russia. Czech troops were strung out along the Trans-Siberian Railway on their way to Vladivostok, where they were due to take ship. The Czechs, though, were not going home to fight for the Austrian empire but to fight for a separate homeland independent of Austria. The Germans demanded that the Bolsheviks disarm the Czechs, who fought back, seized the railway, joined forces with Russians fighting against the Bolsheviks and advanced westwards toward Perm. With the approach of the Czechs, Michael and Natalia feared that she would become trapped there, possibly in a dangerous situation and so, on 18 May, she left unhappily. By early June, Michael was again ill with stomach trouble.

==Death==

On 12 June 1918, the leader of the local secret police, Gavril Myasnikov, with the connivance of other local Bolsheviks, hatched a plan to murder Michael. Myasnikov assembled a team of four men who, like him, were all former prisoners of the Tsarist regime: Vasily Ivanchenko, Ivan Kolpashchikov, Andrei Markov and Nikolai Zhuzhgov. Using a forged order, the four men gained entry to Michael&#x27;s hotel at 11.45 p.m. At first, Michael refused to accompany the men until he spoke with the local chairman of the secret police, Pavel Malkov, and then because he was ill. His protestations were futile and he got dressed. Johnson insisted on accompanying him and the four men plus their two prisoners climbed into two horse-drawn three-seater traps.

They drove out of the town into the forest near Motovilikha. When Michael queried their destination, he was told they were going to a remote railway crossing to catch a train. By now it was the early hours of 13 June. They all alighted from the carriages in the middle of the wood, and both Michael and Johnson were fired upon, once each, but as the assassins were using home-made bullets, their guns jammed. Michael, who may or may not have been injured, moved towards the wounded Johnson with arms outstretched, when he was shot at point-blank range in the head. Both Zhuzhgov and Markov claimed to have fired the fatal shot. Johnson was shot dead by Ivanchenko.

The bodies were stripped and buried. Anything of value was stolen and the clothes were taken back to Perm. After they were shown to Myasnikov as proof of the murders, the clothes were burned. The Ural Regional Soviet, headed by Alexander Beloborodov, approved the killing, either retrospectively or beforehand, as did Lenin. Michael was the first of the Romanovs to be killed by the Bolsheviks, but he was not the last. Neither Michael&#x27;s nor Johnson&#x27;s remains have been found.

The Perm authorities distributed a concocted cover story that Michael was abducted by unidentified men and had disappeared. Chelyshev and Borunov were arrested. Shortly before his own arrest, Colonel Peter Znamerovsky, a former Imperial army officer also exiled to Perm, managed to send Natalia a brief telegram saying that Michael had disappeared. Znamerovsky, Chelyshev and Borunov were all killed by the Perm Bolsheviks. Soviet disinformation about Michael&#x27;s disappearance led to unfounded rumours that he had escaped and was leading a successful counter-revolution. In the ultimately forlorn hope that Michael would ally with Germany, the Germans arranged for Natalia and her daughter to escape to Kiev in German-controlled Ukraine. On the collapse of the Germans in November 1918, Natalia fled to the coast, and she and her daughter were evacuated by the British Royal Navy.

On 8 June 2009, four days short of the 91st anniversary of their deaths, both Michael and Johnson were officially rehabilitated. Russian State Prosecutors stated, &quot;The analysis of the archive material shows that these individuals were subject to repression through arrest, exile and scrutiny ... without being charged of committing concrete class and social-related crimes.&quot;

Michael&#x27;s son George, Count Brasov, died in a car crash shortly before his 21st birthday in 1931. Natalia died penniless in a Parisian charity hospital in 1952. His stepdaughter Natalia Mamontova married three times and wrote a book about her life entitled &quot;Step-Daughter of Imperial Russia&quot;, published in 1940.

<doc id="164383" wikidata="Q297562" url="?curid=164383" title="Leopold Stokowski">
<text>Leopold Anthony Stokowski (18 April 1882 – 13 September 1977) was a British-born American conductor. One of the leading conductors of the early and mid-20th century, he is best known for his long association with the Philadelphia Orchestra. He was especially noted for his free-hand conducting style that spurned the traditional baton and for obtaining a characteristically sumptuous sound from the orchestras he directed.

Stokowski was music director of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the NBC Symphony Orchestra, New York Philharmonic Orchestra, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Symphony of the Air and many others. He was also the founder of the All-American Youth Orchestra, the New York City Symphony, the Hollywood Bowl Symphony Orchestra and the American Symphony Orchestra.

Stokowski conducted the music for and appeared in several Hollywood films, most notably Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia&quot;, and was a lifelong champion of contemporary composers, giving many premieres of new music during his 60-year conducting career. Stokowski, who made his official conducting debut in 1909, appeared in public for the last time in 1975 but continued making recordings until June 1977, a few months before his death at the age of 95.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Leopold Anthony Stokowski was the son of an English-born cabinet-maker of Polish heritage, Kopernik Joseph Boleslaw Stokowski, and his Irish-born wife Annie-Marion (née Moore). Stokowski&#x27;s birth certificate gives his birth on 18 April 1882, at 13 Upper Marylebone Street (now New Cavendish Street), in the Marylebone district of London. Stokowski was named after his Polish-born grandfather Leopold, who died in the Bethlem Hospital, Southwark, London, on 13 January 1879, at the age of 49. Stokowski was the Polonised Lithuanian family name, originally &quot;Stokauskas&quot;, where &quot;stoka&quot; means &quot;lack&quot; or &quot;shortage&quot;.

On occasion in later life he altered his middle name to &quot;Antoni&quot;, per the Polish spelling. Compounding this, there were various rumours and inaccurate entries in otherwise authoritative reference works concerning his name. In Germany there was a rumour that his original name was simply &quot;Stock&quot; (German for stick). After he had achieved international fame with the Philadelphia Orchestra, unsubstantiated rumours circulated that he was born &quot;Leonard&quot; or &quot;Lionel Stokes&quot; or that he had &quot;anglicised&quot; it to &quot;Stokes&quot;. The 5th Edition of &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; (1954) rendered his given names as &quot;Leopold Antoni Stanisław Bołesławowicz&quot;. These canards are readily disproved by reference not only to his birth certificate and those of his father, younger brother, and sister, but also by the Student Entry Registers of the Royal College of Music, Royal College of Organists, and The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, along with other surviving documentation from his days at St. Marylebone Church, St. James&#x27;s Church, and St. Bartholomew&#x27;s in New York City. 

There is some mystery surrounding his early life. For example, he spoke with an unusual, non-British accent, though he was born and raised in London. On occasion, Stokowski gave his year of birth as 1887 instead of 1882, as in a letter to the &quot;Hugo Riemann Musiklexicon&quot; in 1950, which also incorrectly gave his birthplace as Kraków. Nicolas Slonimsky, editor of &quot;Baker&#x27;s Biographical Dictionary of Musicians&quot;, received a letter from a Finnish encyclopaedia editor that said, &quot;The Maestro himself told me that he was born in Pomerania, Germany, in 1889.&quot; 

The mystery surrounding his origins and accent is clarified in Oliver Daniel&#x27;s 1000-page biography &quot;Stokowski – A Counterpoint of View&quot; (1982), in which (in Chapter 12) Daniel reveals Stokowski came under the influence of his first wife, American pianist Olga Samaroff. Samaroff, born Lucy Mary Agnes Hickenlooper, was from Galveston, Texas, and adopted a more exotic-sounding name to further her career. For professional and career reasons, she &quot;urged him to emphasize only the Polish part of his background&quot; once he became a resident of the United States.

===Education===
He studied at the Royal College of Music, where he first enrolled in 1896 at the age of thirteen, making him one of the youngest students to do so. In his later life in the United States, Stokowski would perform six of the nine symphonies composed by his fellow organ student Ralph Vaughan Williams. Stokowski sang in the choir of the St Marylebone Parish Church, and later he became the assistant organist to Sir Walford Davies at The Temple Church. By age 16, Stokowski was elected to membership of the Royal College of Organists. In 1900, he formed the choir of St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Charing Cross Road, where he trained the choirboys and played the organ. In 1902, he was appointed the organist and choir director of St. James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly. He also attended The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he earned a Bachelor of Music degree in 1903.

===New York, Paris, and Cincinnati===
In 1905, Stokowski began work in New York City as the organist and choir director of St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Church. He was very popular among the parishioners, who included members of the Vanderbilt family, but in the course of time, he resigned this position in order to pursue a career as an orchestra conductor. Stokowski moved to Paris for additional study in conducting. There he heard that the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra would be needing a new conductor when it returned from a long sabbatical. In 1908, Stokowski began a campaign to win this position, writing letters to Mrs. Christian R. Holmes, the orchestra&#x27;s president, and travelling to Cincinnati, Ohio, for a personal interview.

Stokowski was selected over other applicants and took up his conducting duties in late 1909. That was also the year of his official conducting debut in Paris with the Colonne Orchestra on 12 May 1909, when Stokowski accompanied his bride to be, the pianist Olga Samaroff, in Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1. Stokowski&#x27;s conducting debut in London took place the following week on 18 May with the New Symphony Orchestra at the Queen&#x27;s Hall. His engagement as new permanent conductor in Cincinnati was a great success. He introduced the concept of &quot;pops concerts&quot; and, starting with his first season, he began championing the work of living composers. His concerts included performances of music by Richard Strauss, Sibelius, Rachmaninoff, Debussy, Glazunov, Saint-Saëns and many others. He conducted the American premieres of new works by such composers as Elgar, whose 2nd Symphony was first presented there on 24 November 1911. He was to maintain his advocacy of contemporary music to the end of his career. However, in early 1912, Stokowski became frustrated with the politics of the orchestra&#x27;s Board of Directors, and submitted his resignation. There was some dispute over whether to accept this or not, but, on 12 April 1912, the board decided to do so.

===Philadelphia Orchestra===
Two months later, Stokowski was appointed the director of the Philadelphia Orchestra, and he made his conducting debut in Philadelphia on 11 October 1912. This position would bring him some of his greatest accomplishments and recognition. It has been suggested that Stokowski resigned abruptly at Cincinnati with the hidden knowledge that the conducting position in Philadelphia was his when he wanted it, or as Oscar Levant suggested in his book &quot;A Smattering of Ignorance&quot;, &quot;he had the contract in his back pocket.&quot; Before Stokowski moved into his conducting position in Philadelphia, however, he returned to England to conduct two concerts at the Queen&#x27;s Hall in London. On 22 May 1912, Stokowski conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in a concert that he was to repeat in its entirety 60 years later at the age of 90, and on 14 June 1912, he conducted an all-Wagner concert that featured the noted soprano Lillian Nordica. While he was director of the Philadelphia Orchestra, he was largely responsible for convincing Mary Louise Curtis Bok to set up the Curtis Institute of Music (13 October 1924) in Philadelphia. He helped with recruiting faculty and hired many of their graduates.

Stokowski rapidly gained a reputation as a musical showman. His flair for the theatrical included grand gestures, such as throwing the sheet music on the floor to show he did not need to conduct from a score. He also experimented with new lighting arrangements in the concert hall, at one point conducting in a dark hall with only his head and hands lighted, at other times arranging the lights so they would cast theatrical shadows of his head and hands. Late in the 1929-1930 symphony season, Stokowski started conducting without a baton. His free-hand manner of conducting soon became one of his trademarks. On the musical side, Stokowski nurtured the orchestra and shaped the &quot;Stokowski&quot; sound, or what became known as the &quot;Philadelphia Sound&quot;. He encouraged &quot;free bowing&quot; from the string section, &quot;free breathing&quot; from the brass section, and continually altered the seating arrangements of the orchestra&#x27;s sections, as well as the acoustics of the hall, in response to his urge to create a better sound. Stokowski is credited as the first conductor to adopt the seating plan that is used by most orchestras today, with first and second violins together on the conductor&#x27;s left, and the violas and cellos to the right.

Stokowski also became known for modifying the orchestrations of some of the works that he conducted, as was a standard practice for conductors prior to the second half of the 20th century. Among others, he amended the orchestrations of Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Sibelius, Johann Sebastian Bach, and Brahms. For example, Stokowski revised the ending of the &quot;Romeo and Juliet Fantasy Overture&quot;, by Tchaikovsky, so it would close quietly, taking his notion from Modest Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Life and Letters of Peter Ilych Tchaikovsky&quot; (translated by Rosa Newmarch: 1906) that the composer had provided a quiet ending of his own at Balakirev&#x27;s suggestion. Stokowski made his own orchestration of Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; by adapting Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s orchestration and making it sound, in some places, similar to Mussorgsky&#x27;s original. In the film &quot;Fantasia&quot;, to conform to the Disney artists&#x27; story-line, depicting the battle between good and evil, the ending of &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; segued into the beginning of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Ave Maria&quot;.

Many music critics have taken exception to the liberties Stokowski took—liberties which were common in the nineteenth century, but had mostly died out in the twentieth, when faithful adherence to the composer&#x27;s scores became more common.Stokowski&#x27;s repertoire was broad and included many contemporary works. He was the only conductor to perform all of Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s orchestral works during the composer&#x27;s own lifetime, several of which were world premieres. Stokowski gave the first American performance of Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Gurre-Lieder&quot; in 1932. It was recorded &quot;live&quot; on 78 rpm records and remained the only recording of this work in the catalogue until the advent of the LP Record. Stokowski also presented the American premieres of four of Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s symphonies, Numbers 1, 3, 6, and 11. In 1916, Stokowski conducted the American premiere of Mahler&#x27;s 8th Symphony, &quot;Symphony of a Thousand&quot;, whose premiere he had attended in Munich on 12 September 1910. He added works by Rachmaninoff to his repertoire, giving the world premieres of his Fourth Piano Concerto, the &quot;Three Russian Songs&quot;, the Third Symphony, and the &quot;Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini&quot;; Sibelius, whose last three symphonies were given their American premieres in Philadelphia in the 1920s; and Igor Stravinsky, many of whose works were also given their first American performances by Stokowski. In 1922, he introduced Stravinsky&#x27;s score for the ballet &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; to America, gave its first staged performance there in 1930 with Martha Graham dancing the part of The Chosen One, and at the same time made the first American recording of the work.

Seldom an opera conductor, Stokowski did give the American premieres in Philadelphia of the original version of Mussorgky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; (1929) and Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Wozzeck&quot; (1931). Works by such composers as Arthur Bliss, Max Bruch, Ferruccio Busoni, Julian Carrillo, Carlos Chávez, Aaron Copland, George Enescu, Manuel de Falla, Paul Hindemith, Gustav Holst, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Nikolai Myaskovsky, Walter Piston, Francis Poulenc, Sergei Prokofiev, Maurice Ravel, Ottorino Respighi, Albert Roussel, Alexander Scriabin, Elie Siegmeister, Karol Szymanowski, Edgard Varèse, Heitor Villa-Lobos, Anton Webern, and Kurt Weill, received their American premieres under Stokowski&#x27;s direction in Philadelphia. In 1933, he started &quot;Youth Concerts&quot; for younger audiences, which are still a tradition in Philadelphia and many other American cities, and fostered youth music programs. After disputes with the board, Stokowski began to withdraw from involvement in the Philadelphia Orchestra from 1936 onwards, allowing his co-conductor Eugene Ormandy to gradually take over. Stokowski shared principal conducting duties with Ormandy from 1936 to 1941; Stokowski did not appear with the Philadelphia Orchestra from the closing concert of the 1940–41 season (a lackluster performance of Bach&#x27;s &quot;St. Matthew Passion&quot;) until 12 February 1960, when he guest-conducted the Philadelphia in works of Mozart, Falla, Respighi, and in a legendary performance of the Shostakovich Fifth Symphony, arguably the greatest by Stokowski. The recording of this concert&#x27;s broadcast had been circulated privately among collectors over the years, though never issued commercially, but with the copyright expiring at the start of 2011, it was released in its entirety on the Pristine Classical label. 

Stokowski appeared as himself in the motion picture &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1937&quot;, conducting two of his Bach transcriptions. That same year he also conducted and acted in &quot;One Hundred Men and a Girl&quot;, with Deanna Durbin and Adolphe Menjou. In 1939, Stokowski collaborated with Walt Disney to create the motion picture for which he is best known: &quot;Fantasia&quot;. He conducted all the music (with the exception of a &quot;jam session&quot; in the middle of the film) and included his own orchestrations for Bach&#x27;s &quot;Toccata and Fugue in D minor&quot; and Mussorgsky&#x27;s/Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot;/&quot;Ave Maria&quot;. Stokowski even got to talk to (and shake hands with) Mickey Mouse on screen, in a famous silhouette footage; though, he would later say with a smile that Mickey Mouse got to shake hands with him.

A lifelong and ardent fan of the newest and most experimental techniques in recording, Stokowski saw to it that most of the music for &quot;Fantasia&quot; was recorded over Class A telephone lines laid down between the Academy of Music in Philadelphia and Bell Laboratories in Camden NJ, using an early, highly complex version of multi-track stereophonic sound, dubbed Fantasound, which shared many attributes with the later Perspecta stereophonic sound system. Recorded on photographic film, the only suitable medium then available, the results were considered astounding for the latter half of the 1930s.

Upon his return in 1960, Stokowski appeared with the Philadelphia Orchestra as a guest conductor. He also made two LP recordings with them for Columbia Records, one including a performance of Manuel de Falla&#x27;s &quot;El amor brujo&quot;, which he had introduced to America in 1922 and had previously recorded for RCA Victor with the Hollywood Bowl Symphony Orchestra in 1946, and a Bach album which featured the 5th Brandenburg Concerto and three of his own Bach transcriptions. He continued to appear as a guest conductor on several more occasions, his final Philadelphia Orchestra concert taking place in 1969.

In honor of Stokowski&#x27;s vast influence on music and the Philadelphia performing arts community, on 24 February 1969, he was awarded the prestigious University of Pennsylvania Glee Club Award of Merit. Beginning in 1964, this award was &quot;established to bring a declaration of appreciation to an individual each year that has made a significant contribution to the world of music and helped to create a climate in which our talents may find valid expression.&quot;

===All-American Youth Orchestra===
With his Philadelphia Orchestra contract having expired in 1940, Stokowski immediately formed the All-American Youth Orchestra, its players&#x27; ages ranging from 18 to 25. It toured South America in 1940 and North America in 1941 and was met with rave reviews. Although Stokowski made a number of recordings with the AAYO for Columbia, the technical standard was not as high as had been achieved with the Philadelphia Orchestra for RCA Victor. In any event, the AAYO was disbanded when America entered the Second World War, and plans for another extensive tour in 1942 were abandoned.

===NBC Symphony Orchestra===
During this time, Stokowski also became chief conductor of the NBC Symphony Orchestra on a three-year contract (1941–1944). Arturo Toscanini, the NBC Symphony&#x27;s regular conductor, did not wish to undertake the 1941–42 NBC season due to friction with NBC management, though he did accept guest engagements with the Philadelphia Orchestra and continued to conduct war bond concerts with the NBC Symphony. Stokowski conducted a great deal of contemporary music with the NBC Symphony, including the US premiere of Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; in 1943, the world premieres of Schoenberg&#x27;s Piano Concerto (with Eduard Steuermann) and George Antheil&#x27;s 4th Symphony, both in 1944, and new works by Alan Hovhaness, Stravinsky, Hindemith, Milhaud, Howard Hanson, William Schuman, Morton Gould and many others. He also conducted several British works with this orchestra, including Vaughan Williams&#x27; 4th Symphony, Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot;, and George Butterworth&#x27;s &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;. Stokowski also made a number of recordings with the NBC Symphony for RCA Victor in 1941–42, including Tchaikovsky&#x27;s 4th Symphony, a work which was never in Toscanini&#x27;s repertoire, and Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Firebird&quot; Suite. Toscanini returned to the NBC Symphony in 1942; he and Stokowski shared conducting duties for the remaining two years of Stokowski&#x27;s contract.

===New York City Symphony Orchestra===
In 1944, on the recommendation of Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, Stokowski helped form the New York City Symphony Orchestra, which they intended would make music accessible for middle-class workers. Ticket prices were set low, and performances took place at convenient, after-work hours. Many early concerts were standing room only; however, a year later in 1945, Stokowski was at odds with the board (who wanted to trim expenses even further) and he resigned. Stokowski made three 78pm sets with the New York City Symphony for RCA Victor: Beethoven&#x27;s 6th Symphony, Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Death and Transfiguration&quot;, and a selection of orchestral music from Georges Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;.
===Hollywood Bowl Symphony Orchestra===
In 1945, he founded the Hollywood Bowl Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra lasted for two years before it was disbanded for live concerts, but not for recordings, which continued well into the 1960s. Stokowski&#x27;s own recordings (made in 1945–46) included Brahms&#x27;s 1st Symphony, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Pathetique&quot; Symphony and a number of short popular pieces. Some of Stokowski&#x27;s open-air HBSO concerts were broadcast and recorded, and have been issued on CD, including a collaboration with Percy Grainger on Edvard Grieg&#x27;s Piano Concerto in A minor in the summer of 1945. He premiered &quot;From A Moonlit Ceremony&quot; (Moonlit Peace) by George Frederick McKay in 1946 with Hollywood Bowl Symphony Orchestra. (It began giving live concerts again as the &quot;Hollywood Bowl Orchestra&quot; in 1991, under John Mauceri). There was a 1949 cartoon spoof of Stokowski at the Bowl with Bugs Bunny playing the conductor in &quot;Long-Haired Hare&quot; by Chuck Jones.

===New York Philharmonic===
He continued to appear frequently with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, both at the Hollywood Bowl and other venues. Then in 1946 Stokowski became a chief Guest Conductor of the New York Philharmonic. His many first performances with them included the US premiere of Prokofiev&#x27;s 6th Symphony in 1949. He also made many splendid recordings with the NYPO for Columbia, including the world premiere recordings of Vaughan Williams&#x27;s 6th Symphony and Olivier Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Ascension&quot;, also in 1949.

===International career===
However, when in 1950 Dimitri Mitropoulos was appointed Chief Conductor of the NYPO, Stokowski began a new international career which commenced in 1951 with a nationwide tour of England: during the Festival of Britain celebrations he conducted the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the invitation of Sir Thomas Beecham. It was during this first visit that he made his debut recording with a British orchestra, the Philharmonia Orchestra, of Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Scheherazade&quot;. During that same summer he also toured and conducted in Germany, Holland, Switzerland, Austria, and Portugal, establishing a pattern of guest-conducting abroad during the summer months while spending the winter seasons conducting in the United States. This scheme was to hold good for the next 20 years during which Stokowski conducted many of the world&#x27;s greatest orchestras, simultaneously making recordings with them for various labels. Thus he conducted and recorded with the main London orchestras as well as the Berlin Philharmonic, the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, the French National Radio Orchestra, the Czech Philharmonic, the Hilversum (Netherlands) Radio Philharmonic, and others.

===Symphony of the Air, Houston Symphony Orchestra===
Stokowski returned to the NBC Symphony Orchestra in 1954 for a series of recording sessions for RCA Victor. The repertoire included Beethoven&#x27;s &#x27;Pastoral&#x27; Symphony, Sibelius&#x27;s 2nd Symphony, Acts 2 and 3 of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Swan Lake&quot; and highlights from Saint-Saëns&#x27;s &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; with Risë Stevens and Jan Peerce. After the NBC Symphony Orchestra was disbanded as the official ensemble of the NBC radio network, it was re-formed as the Symphony of the Air with Stokowski as notional Music Director, and as such performed many concerts and made recordings from 1954 until 1963. The US premiere in 1958 of Turkish composer Ahmet Adnan Saygun&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Yunus Emre&quot; is among them. He made a series of Symphony of the Air recordings for the United Artists label in 1958 which included Beethoven&#x27;s 7th Symphony, Shostakovich&#x27;s 1st Symphony, Khatchaturian&#x27;s 2nd Symphony and Respighi&#x27;s &quot;Pines of Rome&quot;. From 1955 to 1961, Stokowski was also the Music Director of the Houston Symphony. For his debut appearance with the orchestra he gave the first performance of &quot;Mysterious Mountain&quot; by Alan Hovhaness – one of many living American composers whose music he championed over the years. He also gave the US premiere in Houston of Shostakovich&#x27;s 11th Symphony (7 April 1958) and made its first American recording on the Capitol label.

===American Symphony Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and London===

In 1960, Stokowski made one of his infrequent appearances in the opera house, when he conducted Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot; at the New York Metropolitan, in memorable performances with a cast that included Birgit Nilsson, Franco Corelli and Anna Moffo. At the New York City Opera, he had led double-bills of &quot;Œdipus rex&quot; (with Richard Cassilly) and &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; (1959), as well as &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; (with Gérard Souzay) and &quot;Il prigioniero&quot; (with Norman Treigle, 1960).

In 1962, at the age of 80, Stokowski founded the American Symphony Orchestra. His championship of the 20th-century composer remained undiminished, and perhaps his most celebrated premiere with the American Symphony Orchestra was of Charles Ives&#x27;s 4th Symphony in 1965, which CBS also recorded. In addition, he continued to collaborate with noted contemporary soloists of the time including the pianist Glenn Gould in a recording of Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 5, Op 73 &quot;Emperor Concerto&quot; in 1966. Stokowski served as Music Director for the ASO until May 1972 when, at the age of 90, he returned to live in England. On 3 January 1962, still showing his interest in using technological innovation, he was featured in a telecast for WGN-TV conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, which has since been made available on DVD. One of his British guest conducting engagements in the 1960s was the first Proms performance of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s Second Symphony, &quot;Resurrection&quot;, since issued on CD.

Stokowski continued to conduct for a few more years, but failing health forced him to conduct only for recording sessions. An eyewitness said that Stokowski often conducted sitting down in his later years; sometimes, as he became involved in the performance, he would stand up and conduct with remarkable energy. His last public appearance in the UK took place at the Royal Albert Hall, London, on 14 May 1974. Stokowski led the New Philharmonia in the &#x27;Merry Waltz&#x27; of Otto Klemperer (in tribute to the Philharmonia&#x27;s former Music Director who had died the previous year), Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis&quot;, Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Rapsodie espagnole&quot; and Brahms&#x27;s 4th Symphony.
Stokowski&#x27;s final public appearance took place on 22 July 1975 during the Vence Music Festival in the South of France. He conducted the Rouen Chamber Orchestra in several of his own transcriptions of Bach.
===Last years===
Stokowski gave his last world premiere in 1973 when, at the age of 91, he conducted Havergal Brian&#x27;s 28th Symphony in a BBC radio broadcast with the New Philharmonia Orchestra. In August 1973, Stokowski conducted the International Festival Youth Orchestra at Royal Albert Hall in London, performing Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Fifth Symphony. Edward Greenfield of The Guardian wrote: &quot;Stokowski rallied them as though it was a vintage Philadelphia concert of the 1920s&quot;. Stokowski continued to make recordings even after he had retired from the concert platform, mainly with the National Philharmonic, another ad-hoc orchestra made up of first-desk players chosen from the main London orchestras. In 1976, he signed a recording contract with Columbia Records that would have kept him active until he was 100 years old.

Stokowski died of a heart attack on 13 September 1977 in Nether Wallop, Hampshire, at the age of 95. His very last recordings, made shortly before his death, for Columbia, included performances of the youthful Symphony in C by Georges Bizet and Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s 4th Symphony, &quot;Italian&quot;, with the National Philharmonic Orchestra in London. He is interred at East Finchley Cemetery.

==Recording==

Stokowski made his very first recordings, with the Philadelphia Orchestra, for the Victor Talking Machine Company in October 1917, beginning with two of Brahms&#x27; &quot;Hungarian Dances&quot;. Other works recorded in the early sessions were the scherzo from Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; incidental music and &quot;Dance of the Blessed Spirits&quot; from Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice.&quot; He found ways to make the best use of the acoustic recording process, until electric recording was introduced by Victor in the spring of 1925. He conducted the first orchestral electrical recording to be made in America (Saint-Saëns&#x27;s &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;) in April 1925. The following month Stokowski recorded &quot;Marche Slave&quot; by Tchaikovsky, in which he increased the double basses to best utilise the lower frequencies of early electrical recording. Stokowski was also the first conductor in America to record all four of Brahms&#x27; symphonies (between 1927 and 1933).

Stokowski made the first US recordings of the Beethoven 7th and 9th Symphonies, Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;New World&quot; Symphony, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s 4th Symphony and &quot;Nutcracker Suite&quot;, César Franck&#x27;s Symphony in D minor, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Scheherazade&quot;, Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s 2nd Piano Concerto (with the composer as soloist), Jean Sibelius&#x27;s 4th Symphony (its first recording), Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s 5th and 6th Symphonies, and many shorter works. His early recordings were made at Victor&#x27;s Trinity Church studio in Camden, New Jersey until 1926, when Victor began recording the orchestra in the Academy of Music in Philadelphia. Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra later participated in long playing, high fidelity, and stereophonic experiments, during the early 1930s, mostly for Bell Laboratories (Victor even released some early Long Playing Records around this time, which were not commercially successful for several reasons). Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra continued to make records exclusively for Victor through December 1940. One of his last 1940 sessions was the world premiere recording of Shostakovich&#x27;s sixth symphony. In addition to RCA Victor, Stokowski recorded prodigiously for several other labels until shortly before his death, including Columbia, Capitol, EMI/HMV, Everest, United Artists, and Decca/London. 

In 1954, Stokowski made his first commercial stereo recordings with the NBC Symphony Orchestra for RCA Victor. These records were of excerpts from Prokofiev&#x27;s ballet &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and the complete one-act ballet &quot;Sebastian&quot; by Gian Carlo Menotti. From 1947 to 1953, Stokowski recorded for RCA Victor with a specially assembled &#x27;ad hoc&#x27; band of players drawn principally from the New York Philharmonic and NBC Symphony Orchestras. The records were credited to &#x27;Leopold Stokowski and His Symphony Orchestra&#x27; and the repertoire ranged from Haydn (his &quot;Imperial&quot; Symphony) to Schoenberg (&quot;Transfigured Night&quot;) by way of Schumann, Liszt, Bizet, Wagner, Tchaikovsky, Debussy, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Sibelius and Percy Grainger. Stokowski&#x27;s recordings for Capitol Records in the 1950s were distinguished by the use of three-track stereophonic tape recorders.

Stokowski was very careful in the placement of musicians during recording sessions and worked closely with the recording staff to achieve the best possible results. Some of the sessions took place in the ballroom of the Riverside Plaza Hotel in New York City in January and February 1957; these were produced by Richard C. Jones and engineered by Frank Abbey with Stokowski&#x27;s own orchestra, which was typically drawn from New York musicians (primarily members of the Symphony of the Air). The CD reissue by EMI included selections originally released on two LPs -- &quot;The Orchestra&quot; and &quot;Landmarks of a Distinguished Career&quot;—and featured music of Paul Dukas, Samuel Barber, Richard Strauss, Harold Farberman, Vincent Persichetti, Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, Debussy, Bach (as arranged by Stokowski), and Sibelius. Although he officially used the Ravel orchestration of the finale to Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; in his 1957 Capitol recording, he did add a few additional percussion instruments to the score. His Capitol recording of Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot; was made with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. EMI, which acquired Angel Records and Capitol in the 1950s, reissued many of Stokowski&#x27;s Capitol recordings on CD; these recordings are now controlled by Warner Classics, as EMI ceased to exist in 2013. All of the music that Stokowski conducted in &quot;Fantasia&quot; was released on a 3-LP set by Disneyland Records, in the 1957 soundtrack album made from the film. After stereo became possible on phonograph records, the album was released in stereo on Buena Vista Records. With the advent of compact discs, it appeared on a 2-CD Walt Disney Records set, in conjunction with the film&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

In 1958, Stokowski signed a contract with Everest Records, which was noted for its use of 35 mm film instead of tape and the resulting highly vivid sound. One of Stokowski&#x27;s most notable Everest recordings was a coupling of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Francesca da Rimini&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot; with the New York Stadium Symphony Orchestra (the summer name for the New York Philharmonic). Stokowski&#x27;s other remarkable Everest recordings include Villa-Lobos&#x27; tone poem &quot;Uirapuru&quot;, Shostakovich&#x27;s Symphony No. 5 and Prokofiev&#x27;s ballet suite &quot;Cinderella&quot;. Several of Stokowski&#x27;s televised concerts have been issued on both VHS and DVD, including Beethoven&#x27;s 5th Symphony and Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Unfinished&quot; Symphony with the London Philharmonic on EMI Classics &#x27;Classic Archive&#x27; label; the Nielsen 2nd Symphony with the Danish Radio Orchestra on VAI (Video Artists International); and Charles Ives&#x27; 4th Symphony with the American Symphony Orchestra on Classical Video Rarities.

In 1973, Stokowski was invited by the International Festival of Youth Orchestras to conduct the 1973 International Festival Orchestra, numbering 140 of the world&#x27;s finest young musicians, in a performance of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Fifth Symphony at the Royal Albert Hall, London. The Cameo Classics LP label recorded the concert, and also, by special permission of the maestro, the final rehearsals, which would make up a 2-LP set. Edward Greenfield in &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported &quot;Stokowski rallied them as though it was a vintage Philadelphia concert of the 1920s&quot;. Robert M. Stumpff ll (Leopold Stokowski Club of America) called the performance &quot;The finest ever performance of this symphony&quot;. This unique Dolby recording was restored in 2014 by Klassik Haus and is available from Cameo Classics on CD (Nimbus Records Distribution).

==Personal life==
===Marriages===
Stokowski married three times. His first wife was American concert pianist Olga Samaroff, to whom he was married from 24 April 1911 until their divorce on 30 July 1923. They had one daughter: Sonya Maria Noel Stokowski (born 24 December 1921), an actress.

His second wife was Johnson &amp; Johnson heiress Evangeline Love Brewster Johnson, an artist and aviator, to whom he was married from 11 January 1926 until their divorce on 2 December 1937. They had two daughters: Gloria Luba Stokowski and Andrea Sadja Stokowski. In March 1938, Stokowski began a highly publicized relationship with film actress Greta Garbo after the two vacationed together in Italy, on the island of Capri. Whether or not their relationship was romantic or platonic was the subject of much speculation and scrutiny in the press.

On 21 April 1945, Stokowski married heiress and actress Gloria Vanderbilt. They had two sons, Leopold Stanislaus Stokowski (born 1950) and Christopher Stokowski (born 1952). They divorced on 29 October 1955.

==Legacy==
After Stokowski&#x27;s death, Tom Burnam writes, the &quot;concatenation of canards&quot; that had arisen around him was revived — that his name and accent were phony; that his musical education was deficient; that his musicians did not respect him; that he cared about nobody but himself. Burnam suggests that there was a dark, hidden reason for these rumours. Stokowski deplored the segregation of symphony orchestras in which women and minorities were excluded, and, Burnam claims, his detractors got revenge by slandering him. Nevertheless, and notwithstanding Burnam&#x27;s claims, attitudes towards Stokowski have changed dramatically since his death. In 1999, for &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine, the noted music commentator David Mellor wrote: &quot;One of the great joys of recent years for me has been the reassessment of Leopold Stokowski. When I was growing up there was a tendency to disparage the old man as a charlatan. Today it is all very different. Stokowski is now recognised as the father of modern orchestral standards. He possessed a truly magical gift of extracting a burnished sound from both great and second-rank ensembles. He also loved the process of recording and his gramophone career was a constant quest for better recorded sound. But the greatest pleasure of all for me is his acceptance now as an outstanding conductor of nineteenth- and twentieth-century music, including a lot that was at the cutting edge of contemporary achievement.&quot;

==In popular culture==

* In the 1936 musical film &quot;Born to Dance&quot;, during the “You&#x27;d be so Easy to Love” sequence in Central Park, Jimmy Stewart “conducts” Eleanor Powell&#x27;s dance with a balloon-seller&#x27;s stick. A policeman (Reginald Gardiner) approaches, snaps Stewart&#x27;s stick, shakes out his hair, retrieves a balloon stick for himself, and launches into 3 minutes of intense, speechless parody of Stokowski conducting orchestral variations on the theme—and faints.
* The 1940 Walt Disney animated film &quot;Fantasia&quot; stars Stokowski leading the Philadelphia Orchestra and performing, among other pieces of music, his transcription of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Toccata and Fugue in D minor&quot;, BWV 565, as the opening piece of the program.

* A statue of the maestro shaking hands with Mickey Mouse, a recreation of that memorable moment in &quot;Fantasia&quot;, stands in the lobby of Disney&#x27;s Contemporary Resort in Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida.

* The 1949 &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; episode &quot;Long-Haired Hare&quot; has a satirical homage to Stokowski: Bugs Bunny impersonates him at the Hollywood Bowl. The cartoon pokes gentle fun at Stokowski&#x27;s habit of conducting without a baton by having Bugs break the baton handed to him.

<text>Harry Kirby McClintock (October 8, 1884 – April 24, 1957), also known as &quot;Haywire Mac&quot;, was an American railroad man, radio personality, actor, singer, songwriter, and poet, best known for his song &quot;The Big Rock Candy Mountains&quot;.

==Life==
McClintock was born on October 8, 1884, in Uhrichsville, Ohio. Both his parents were from nearby Tippecanoe, Ohio; however, his family moved to Knoxville, Tennessee soon after his birth. In his youth, McClintock ran away from home to join the circus and drifted from place to place throughout his life. He railroaded in Africa, worked as a seaman, supplied food and ammunition to American soldiers while working as a civilian mule train packer in the Philippines, and in 1899 worked as an aide to newsmen in China covering the Boxer Rebellion.

In America, Mac traveled as a railroader and minstrel. He worked for numerous railroads during his life.

On October 8, 1917, McClintock married Bessie K. Johnson in Farmington, Utah. They had one daughter.

==Radio and music==
In 1925, McClintock participated in a KFRC Radio talent contest. His performance of his song &quot;The Big Rock Candy Mountains&quot; won him spots on two new KFRC radio shows: a children&#x27;s program titled &quot;Mac and His Gang&quot; where he sang popular cowboy songs with his &quot;Haywire Orchestry&quot;, and a variety program titled &quot;Blue Monday Jamboree&quot;, which he hosted with Meredith Willson, Bea Benaderet, Edna Fischer, and future &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; producer Jess Oppenheimer. McClintock was also a member of Al Pearce&#x27;s &quot;The Happy Go Lucky Hour&quot;, a KFRC spin-off of &quot;Blue Monday Jamboree&quot;, alongside Edna Fischer and Tommy Harris.

&quot;The Big Rock Candy Mountain&quot; reached No. 1 on Billboard&#x27;s &quot;Hillbilly Hits&quot; chart in 1939. The song was featured in the 2000 Coen brothers&#x27; film &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; McClintock&#x27;s song &quot;The Old Chisholm Trail&quot; was featured in the end credits of &quot;The Grandest Enterprise Under God&quot; (episode 5) of the TV documentary miniseries &quot;The West&quot;. He was included in Robert Crumb&#x27;s series of &quot;Heroes of Blues, Jazz and Country&quot; trading cards.

==Politics==
McClintock was active in the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). He served with Frank Little in the Fresno Free Speech Fight from January 12 to March 4, 1911, and participated in the Tucker strike in Utah on June 14, 1913, with Joe Hill. McClintock wrote the marching song of the IWW, &quot;Hallelujah, I&#x27;m a Bum&quot;, and he is credited with being the first person to sing Hill&#x27;s song &quot;The Preacher and the Slave&quot; in public. In the early 1920s, McClintock worked and organized union men in the oil fields of West Texas, where he met and recruited author Jim Thompson, who later incorporated him into several short stories using the name Strawlegs Martin.

<doc id="164385" wikidata="Q1390415" url="?curid=164385" title="SMPTE timecode">
<text>SMPTE timecode ( or ) is a set of cooperating standards to label individual frames of video or film with a timecode. The system is defined by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers in the SMPTE 12M specification. SMPTE revised the standard in 2008, turning it into a two-part document: SMPTE 12M-1 and SMPTE 12M-2, including new explanations and clarifications.

Timecodes are added to film, video or audio material, and have also been adapted to synchronize music and theatrical production. They provide a time reference for editing, synchronization and identification. Timecode is a form of media metadata. The invention of timecode made modern videotape editing possible and led eventually to the creation of non-linear editing systems.

== Basic concepts ==
SMPTE timecode is presented in &quot;hour:minute:second:frame&quot; format and is typically represented in 32 bits using binary-coded decimal. There are also &quot;drop-frame&quot; and &quot;color framing&quot; flags and three extra &quot;binary group flag&quot; bits used for defining the use of the user bits. The formats of other varieties of SMPTE timecode are derived from that of the linear timecode. More complex timecodes such as vertical interval timecode can also include extra information in a variety of encodings.

Sub-second timecode time values are expressed in terms of frames. Common supported frame rates include:
* 23.98 (24 ÷ 1.001) frame/s (North American HDTV), sometimes also more precisely specified as 23.976. 
* 24 frame/s (film, ATSC, 2K, 4K, 6K)
* 25 frame/s (PAL (Europe, Uruguay, Argentina, Australia), SECAM, DVB, ATSC)
* 29.97 (30 ÷ 1.001) frame/s (NTSC American System (U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, et al.), ATSC, PAL-M (Brazil))
* 30 frame/s (ATSC)

In general, SMPTE timecode frame rate information is implicit, known from the rate of arrival of the timecode from the medium. It may also be specified in other metadata encoded in the medium. The interpretation of several bits, including the &quot;color framing&quot; and &quot;drop frame&quot; bits, depends on the underlying data rate. In particular, the drop frame bit is only valid for 29.97 and 30 frame/s

== Discontinuous timecode, and flywheel processing ==
Timecodes are generated as a continuous stream of sequential data values. In some applications wall-clock time is used, in others the time encoded is a notional time with more arbitrary reference. After making a series of recordings, or after crude editing, recorded timecodes may consist of discontinuous segments.

In general, it is not possible to know the linear timecode (LTC) of the current frame until the frame has already gone by, by which time it is too late to make an edit. Practical systems watch the ascending sequence of the timecode and infer the time of the current frame from that.

As timecodes in analog systems are prone to bit-errors and drop-outs, most timecode processing devices check for internal consistency in the sequence of timecode values and use simple error correction schemes to correct for short error bursts. Thus, a boundary between discontinuous timecode ranges cannot be determined exactly until several subsequent frames have passed.

== Drop-frame timecode ==
Drop-frame timecode originates from a compromise introduced when color NTSC video was invented. The NTSC designers wanted to retain compatibility with existing monochrome televisions. To minimize subcarrier visibility on a monochrome receiver it was necessary to make the color subcarrier an odd multiple of half the line scan frequency; the multiple originally chosen was 495. With a 30 Hz frame rate the line scan frequency is (30 × 525) = 15750 Hz. So the subcarrier frequency would have been  × 15750 = 3.898125 MHz. 

This was the subcarrier frequency originally chosen, but tests showed that on some monochrome receivers an interference pattern caused by the beat between the color subcarrier and the 4.5 MHz sound intercarrier could be seen. The visibility of this pattern could be greatly reduced by lowering the subcarrier frequency multiple to 455 (thus increasing the beat frequency from approximately 600 kHz to approximately 920 kHz) and by making the beat frequency also equal to an odd multiple of half the line scan frequency. This latter change could have been achieved by raising the sound intercarrier by 0.1% to 4.5045 MHz, but the designers, concerned that this might cause problems with some existing receivers, decided instead to reduce the color subcarrier frequency, and thus both the line scan frequency and the frame rate, by 0.1% instead. Thus the NTSC color subcarrier ended up as 3.579 MHz ( MHz), the line scan frequency as 15. kHz ( MHz) and the frame rate 29. Hz ( Hz).

The altered frame rate meant that an hour of timecode at a nominal frame rate of 29.97 frame/s was longer than an hour of wall-clock time by 3.6 seconds (for 29.97 non-drop timecode of 01:00:00:00 drop-frame timecode is 01:00:03;18 and for non-drop 00:59:56:12 drop-frame is 01:00:00;00), leading to an error of almost a minute and a half over a day.

To correct this, drop-frame SMPTE timecode was invented. In spite of what the name implies, &quot;no&quot; video frames are dropped or skipped when using drop-frame timecode. Rather, some of the &quot;timecodes&quot; are dropped. In order to make an hour of timecode match an hour on the clock, drop-frame timecode skips frame numbers 0 and 1 of the first second of every minute, except when the number of minutes is divisible by ten. This causes timecode to skip 18 frames each ten minutes (18,000 frames @ 30 frame/s) and almost perfectly compensates for the difference in rate (but still accumulates 1 frame every 9 hours 15 minutes).

For example, the sequence when frame counts are dropped:
:01:08:59:28
:01:08:59:29
:01:09:00:02
:01:09:00:03

For each tenth minute
:01:09:59:28
:01:09:59:29
:01:10:00:00
:01:10:00:01

While non-drop timecode is displayed with colons separating the digit pairs—&quot;HH:MM:SS:FF&quot;—drop-frame is usually represented with a semicolon (;) or period (.) as the divider between all the digit pairs—&quot;HH;MM;SS;FF&quot;, &quot;HH.MM.SS.FF&quot;—or just between the seconds and frames—&quot;HH:MM:SS;FF&quot; or &quot;HH:MM:SS.FF&quot;. Drop-frame timecode is typically abbreviated as DF and non-drop as NDF.

== Color framing and timecode ==
A color framing bit is often used to indicate field 1 of the color frame so that editing equipment can make sure to edit only on appropriate color frame sequence boundaries in order to prevent picture corruption.

== Studio operations and master clocks ==
In television studio operations, longitudinal timecode is generated by the studio master sync generator and distributed from a central point. Central sync generators usually derive their timing from an atomic clock, using either network time or GPS. Studios usually operate multiple clocks and automatically switch over if one fails.

== Music production ==
Longitudinal SMPTE timecode is widely used to synchronize music. A frame rate of 30 frame/s is often used for audio in America, Japan, and other countries that rely on a 60 Hz mains frequency and use the NTSC television standard. The European Broadcasting Union standard frame rate of 25 frame/s is used throughout Europe, Australia and wherever the mains frequency is 50 Hz and the PAL or SECAM television standards are used.

== Variants ==
Timecode may be attached to a recording medium in a number of different ways.
#Linear timecode, a.k.a. longitudinal timecode (LTC): suitable to be recorded on an audio channel, or carried by audio wires for distribution within a studio to synchronize recorders and cameras. To read LTC, the recording must be moving, meaning that LTC is useless when the recording is stationary or nearly stationary. This shortcoming led to the development of VITC.
#Vertical interval timecode, (VITC, pronounced &quot;vit-see&quot;): recorded into the vertical blanking interval of the video signal on each frame of video. The advantage of VITC is that, since it is a part of the playback video, it can be read when the tape is stationary.
#AES-EBU embedded timecode, SMPTE timecode embedded in an AES3 digital audio connection.
#control track longitudinal timecode (CTL timecode): SMPTE timecode embedded in the control track of a videotape.
#Visible time code, a.k.a. burnt-in timecode and BITC (pronounced &quot;bit-see&quot;) - the numbers are burnt into the video image so that humans can easily read the time code. Videotapes that are duplicated with these time code numbers &quot;burnt-in&quot; to the video are known as &quot;window dubs&quot;.
#Film labels, such as Keykode.

==History==

There were several iterations of timecode in the late 1960s (EECO, DaVinci, Seimens, etc.). The version adopted by SMPTE was developed by Leo O&#x27;Donnell while he was working for the National Film Board of Canada. Leo&#x27;s version referenced time of day and used an 80-bit word that was derived from rocket telemetry. There were several patents issued on Leo’s version (US3877799, for example). Since that time, several changes have been made by SMPTE to keep up with technology.

<text>S&amp;P Global Ratings (previously Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s and informally known as S&amp;P) is an American credit rating agency (CRA) and a division of S&amp;P Global that publishes financial research and analysis on stocks, bonds, and commodities. S&amp;P is considered the largest of the Big Three credit-rating agencies, which also include Moody&#x27;s Ratings and Fitch Ratings. Its head office is located on 55 Water Street in Lower Manhattan, New York City.

==Corporate history==
The company traces its history back to 1860, with the publication by Henry Varnum Poor of &quot;History of Railroads and Canals in the United States&quot;. This book compiled comprehensive information about the financial and operational state of U.S. railroad companies. In 1868, Henry Varnum Poor established H.V. and H.W. Poor Co. with his son, Henry William Poor, and published two annually updated hardback guidebooks, &quot;Poor&#x27;s Manual of the Railroads of the United States&quot; and &quot;Poor&#x27;s Directory of Railway Officials&quot;.

In 1906, Luther Lee Blake founded the Standard Statistics Bureau, with the view to providing financial information on non-railroad companies. Instead of an annually published book, Standard Statistics would use 5-by-7-inch cards, allowing for more frequent updates.

In 1941, Paul Talbot Babson purchased Poor&#x27;s Publishing and merged it with Standard Statistics to become Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s Corp. In 1966, the company was acquired by The McGraw-Hill Companies, extending McGraw-Hill into the field of financial information services.

==Credit ratings==
As a credit rating agency (CRA), the company issues credit ratings for the debt of public and private companies, and public borrowers such as governments, governmental agencies, and cities. It is one of several CRAs that have been designated a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

===Long-term credit ratings===
S&amp;P rates borrowers on a scale from AAA to D. Intermediate ratings are offered at each level between AA and CCC (such as BBB+, BBB, and BBB−). For some borrowers issuances, the company may also offer guidance (termed a &quot;credit watch&quot;) as to whether it is likely to be upgraded (positive), downgraded (negative) or stable.

Investment Grade
* AAA: An obligor rated &#x27;AAA&#x27; has extremely strong capacity to meet its financial commitments. &#x27;AAA&#x27; is the highest issuer credit rating assigned by Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s.
* AA: An obligor rated &#x27;AA&#x27; has very strong capacity to meet its financial commitments. It differs from the highest-rated obligors only to a small degree. Includes:
** AA+: equivalent to Moody&#x27;s Aa1 (high quality, with very low credit risk, but susceptibility to long-term risks appears somewhat greater)
** AA: equivalent to Aa2
** AA−: equivalent to Aa3
* A: An obligor rated &#x27;A&#x27; has strong capacity to meet its financial commitments but is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligors in higher-rated categories.
** A+: equivalent to A1
** A: equivalent to A2
* BBB: An obligor rated &#x27;BBB&#x27; has adequate capacity to meet its financial commitments. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitments.

Non-Investment Grade (also known as speculative-grade)
* BB: An obligor rated &#x27;BB&#x27; is less vulnerable in the near term than other lower-rated obligors. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties and exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligor&#x27;s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitments.
* B: An obligor rated &#x27;B&#x27; is more vulnerable than the obligors rated &#x27;BB&#x27;, but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitments. Adverse business, financial, or economic conditions will likely impair the obligor&#x27;s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitments.
* CCC: An obligor rated &#x27;CCC&#x27; is currently vulnerable, and is dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions to meet its financial commitments.
* CC: An obligor rated &#x27;CC&#x27; is currently highly vulnerable.
* C: highly vulnerable, perhaps in bankruptcy or in arrears but still continuing to pay out on obligations
* R: An obligor rated &#x27;R&#x27; is under regulatory supervision owing to its financial condition. During the pendency of the regulatory supervision, the regulators may have the power to favor one class of obligations over others or pay some obligations and not others.
* SD: has selectively defaulted on some obligations
* D: has defaulted on obligations and S&amp;P believes that it will generally default on most or all obligations
* NR: not rated

===Short-term issue credit ratings===
The company rates specific issues on a scale from A-1 to D. Within the A-1 category, it can be designated with a plus sign (+). This indicates that the issuer&#x27;s commitment to meet its obligation is very strong. Country risk and currency of repayment of the obligor to meet the issue obligation are factored into the credit analysis and reflected in the issue rating.

* A-1: obligor&#x27;s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is strong
* A-2: is susceptible to adverse economic conditions however the obligor&#x27;s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is satisfactory
* A-3: adverse economic conditions are likely to weaken the obligor&#x27;s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation
* B: has significant speculative characteristics. The obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial obligation but faces major ongoing uncertainties that could impact its financial commitment on the obligation
* C: currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business, financial and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation
* D: is in payment default. Obligation not made on due date and grace period may not have expired. The rating is also used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition.

== Governance scores ==
S&amp;P has had a variety of approaches to reflecting its opinion of the relative strength of a company&#x27;s corporate governance practices. Corporate governance serves as investor protection against potential governance-related losses of value, or failure to create value.

===CGS scores===
S&amp;P developed criteria and methodology for assessing corporate governance. It started issuing Corporate Governance Scores (CGS) in 2000. CGS assessed companies&#x27; corporate governance practices. They were assigned at the request of the company being assessed, were non-public (although companies were free to disclose them to the public and sometimes did) and were limited to public U.S. corporations. In 2005, S&amp;P stopped issuing CGS.

===GAMMA scores===
S&amp;P&#x27;s Governance, Accountability, Management Metrics and Analysis (GAMMA) scores were designed for equity investors in emerging markets and focused on non-financial-risk assessment, and in particular, assessment of corporate governance risk. S&amp;P discontinued providing stand-alone governance scores in 2011, &quot;while continuing to incorporate governance analysis in global and local scale credit ratings&quot;.

===Management and Governance criteria===
In November 2012, S&amp;P published its criteria for evaluating insurers and non-financial enterprises&#x27; management and governance credit factors. These scores are not standalone, but rather a component used by S&amp;P in assessing an enterprise&#x27;s overall creditworthiness. S&amp;P updated its management and governance scoring methodology as part of a larger effort to include enterprise risk management analysis in its rating of debt issued by non-financial companies. &quot;Scoring of management and governance is made on a scale of weak, fair, satisfactory or strong, depending on the mix of positive and negative management scores and the existence and severity of governance deficiencies.&quot;

== Downgrades of countries ==

=== Downgrade of U.S. long-term credit rating ===
On August 5, 2011, following enactment of the Budget Control Act of 2011, S&amp;P lowered the US&#x27;s sovereign long-term credit rating from AAA to AA+. The press release sent with the decision said, in part:
* &quot; The downgrade reflects our opinion that the fiscal consolidation plan that Congress and the Administration recently agreed to falls short of what, in our view, would be necessary to stabilize the government&#x27;s medium-term debt dynamics.
* &quot; More broadly, the downgrade reflects our view that the effectiveness, stability, and predictability of American policymaking and political institutions have weakened at a time of ongoing fiscal and economic challenges to a degree more than we envisioned when we assigned a negative outlook to the rating on April 18, 2011.
* &quot; Since then, we have changed our view of the difficulties in bridging the gulf between the political parties over fiscal policy, which makes us pessimistic about the capacity of Congress and the Administration to be able to leverage their agreement this week into a broader fiscal consolidation plan that stabilizes the government&#x27;s debt dynamics any time soon.&quot;

The United States Department of the Treasury, which had first called S&amp;P&#x27;s attention to its $2 trillion error in calculating the ten-year deficit reduction under the Budget Control Act, commented, &quot;The magnitude of this mistake – and the haste with which S&amp;P changed its principal rationale for action when presented with this error – raise fundamental questions about the credibility and integrity of S&amp;P&#x27;s ratings action.&quot; The following day, S&amp;P acknowledged in writing the US$2 trillion error in its calculations, saying the error &quot;had no impact on the rating decision&quot; and adding:
In taking a longer term horizon of 10 years, the U.S. net general government debt level with the current assumptions would be $20.1 trillion (85% of 2021 GDP). With the original assumptions, the debt level was projected to be $22.1 trillion (93% of 2021 GDP).
In 2013, the Justice Department charged Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s with fraud in a $5 billion lawsuit: U.S. v. McGraw-Hill Cos et al., U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 13-00779. Since it did not charge Fitch and Moody&#x27;s and because the Department did not give access to evidence, there has been speculation whether the lawsuit may have been in retaliation for S&amp;P&#x27;s decision to downgrade. 

On April 15, 2013, the Department of Justice was ordered to grant S&amp;P access to evidence.

=== Downgrade of France&#x27;s long-term credit rating ===
On November 11, 2011, S&amp;P erroneously announced the cut of France&#x27;s triple-A rating (AAA). French leaders said that the error was inexcusable and called for even more regulation of private credit rating agencies. On January 13, 2012, S&amp;P truly cut France&#x27;s AAA rating, lowering it to AA+. This was the first time since 1975 that Europe&#x27;s second-biggest economy, France, had been downgraded to AA+. The same day, S&amp;P downgraded the rating of eight other European countries: Austria, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Malta, Slovenia, Slovakia and Cyprus.

==Publications==
The company publishes &quot;The Outlook&quot;, a weekly investment advisory newsletter for individuals and professional investors, published continuously since 1922. &quot;Credit Week&quot; is produced by Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s Credit Market Services Group. It offers a comprehensive view of the global credit markets, providing credit rating news and analysis. Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s offers numerous other editorials, investment commentaries and news updates for financial markets, companies, industries, stocks, bonds, funds, economic outlook and investor education. All publications are available to subscribers.

S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices publishes several blogs that do not require a subscription to access. These include Indexology, VIX Views and Housing Views.

==Criticism and scandal==
===Role in the 2007–08 financial crisis===

Credit rating agencies such as S&amp;P have been cited for contributing to the financial crisis of 2007–08. Credit ratings of AAA (the highest rating available) were given to large portions of even the riskiest pools of loans in the collateralized debt obligation (CDO) market. When the real estate bubble burst in 2007, many loans went bad due to falling housing prices and the inability of bad creditors to refinance. Investors who had trusted the AAA rating to mean that CDO were low-risk had purchased large amounts that later experienced staggering drops in value or could not be sold at any price. For example, institutional investors lost $125 million on $340.7 million worth of CDOs issued by Credit Suisse Group, despite being rated AAA by S&amp;P.

Companies pay S&amp;P, Moody&#x27;s, and Fitch to rate their debt issues. As a result, some critics have contended that the credit ratings agencies are beholden to these issuers in a conflict of interests and that their ratings are not as objective as they ought to be, due to this &quot;pay to play&quot; model.

In 2015, Standard and Poor&#x27;s paid $1.5 billion to the U.S. Justice Department, various state governments, and the California Public Employees&#x27; Retirement System to settle lawsuits asserting its inaccurate ratings defrauded investors.

===Criticism of sovereign debt ratings===
In April 2009, the company called for &quot;new faces&quot; in the Irish government, which was seen as interfering in the democratic process. In a subsequent statement they said they were &quot;misunderstood&quot;.

S&amp;P acknowledged making a US$2 trillion error in its justification for downgrading the credit rating of the United States in 2011, but stated that it &quot;had no impact on the rating decision&quot;.

===Australian Federal Court decision===
In November 2012, Judge Jayne Jagot of the Federal Court of Australia found that:
&quot;A reasonably competent ratings agency could not have rated the Rembrandt 2006-3 CPDO AAA in these circumstances&quot;; and
&quot;S&amp;P’s rating of AAA of the Rembrandt 2006-2 and 2006-3 CPDO notes was misleading and deceptive and involved the publication of information or statements false in material particulars and otherwise involved negligent misrepresentations to the class of potential investors in Australia, which included Local Government Financial Services Pty Ltd and the councils, because by the AAA rating there was conveyed a representation that in S&amp;P’s opinion the capacity of the notes to meet all financial obligations was “extremely strong” and a representation that S&amp;P had reached this opinion based on reasonable grounds and as the result of an exercise of reasonable care when neither was true and S&amp;P also knew not to be true at the time made.&quot;

In conclusion, Jagot found Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s to be jointly liable along with ABN Amro and Local Government Financial Services Pty Ltd.

==Antitrust review==
In November 2009, ten months after launching an investigation, the European Commission (EC) formally charged S&amp;P with abusing its position as the sole provider of international securities identification codes for United States of America securities by requiring European financial firms and data vendors to pay licensing fees for their use. &quot;This behavior amounts to unfair pricing,&quot; the EC said in its statement of objections which lays the groundwork for an adverse finding against S&amp;P. &quot;The (numbers) are indispensable for a number of operations that financial institutions carry out – for instance, reporting to authorities or clearing and settlement – and cannot be substituted.”

S&amp;P has run the CUSIP Service Bureau, the only International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) issuer in the US, on behalf of the American Bankers Association. In its formal statement of objections, the EC alleged &quot;that S&amp;P is abusing this monopoly position by enforcing the payment of licence fees for the use of US ISINs by (a) banks and other financial services providers in the EEA and (b) information service providers in the EEA.&quot; It claims that comparable agencies elsewhere in the world either do not charge fees at all, or do so on the basis of distribution cost, rather than usage.

<doc id="164387" wikidata="Q426517" url="?curid=164387" title="...And Justice for All (film)">
<text>...And Justice for All is a 1979 American legal drama film directed by Norman Jewison and starring Al Pacino, Jack Warden and John Forsythe. Lee Strasberg, Jeffrey Tambor, Christine Lahti, Craig T. Nelson, Thomas Waites and Sam Levene (in his final screen performance) appear in supporting roles. The Oscar-nominated screenplay is written by Valerie Curtin and Barry Levinson. It was filmed in Baltimore, including the courthouse area. It received two Academy Award nominations: Best Actor (Pacino) and Best Original Screenplay (Curtin and Levinson).

The film includes a well-known scene in which Pacino&#x27;s character yells, &quot;&quot;You&#x27;re&quot; out of order! &quot;You&#x27;re&quot; out of order! The &quot;whole trial&quot; is out of order!&quot;

==Plot==
Arthur Kirkland, a Baltimore defense attorney, is in jail on a contempt-of-court charge after punching Judge Henry T. Fleming while arguing the case of Jeff McCullaugh. McCullaugh was stopped for a minor traffic offense, then mistaken for a killer of the same name, and has already spent a year and a half in jail without being convicted of a crime. Fleming has repeatedly stymied Kirkland&#x27;s efforts to have the case reviewed. Although there is strong new evidence that McCullaugh is innocent, Fleming refuses to consider his appeal due to its late submission, so he remains in prison. Kirkland starts a new case defending Ralph Agee, a young black cross-dresser arrested for a robbery who is terrified of being sent to prison.

Kirkland regularly visits his grandfather Sam in a nursing home. Sam is progressively becoming senile. It is revealed that Kirkland was abandoned by his parents at a young age, and it was Sam who raised him and put him through law school. Kirkland also begins a romance with legal ethics committee member Gail Packer.

Kirkland has a friendly relationship with Judge Francis Rayford, who takes him on a hair-raising ride in his personal helicopter. Rayford laughs in amusement as he tests how far he can fly before running out of fuel. Kirkland is terrified and begs him to land. Rayford eventually crashes his helicopter in knee-deep water. Rayford, a Korean War veteran, is borderline suicidal; at all times, he keeps a rifle in his chambers at the courthouse and an M1911 pistol in his shoulder holster. He even eats his lunch on a ledge outside his office window, four stories up.

One day, Kirkland is unexpectedly requested to defend Judge Fleming, who has been accused of brutally assaulting and raping a young woman. Although the two loathe each other, Fleming feels that having the person who publicly hates him argue his innocence will be to his advantage. Fleming blackmails Kirkland with an old violation of attorney-client confidentiality, for which Kirkland will likely be disbarred if it were to come to light.

Kirkland&#x27;s friend and partner Jay Porter is also unstable. He feels guilt for gaining acquittals for defendants who were truly guilty of violent crimes. Porter arrives drunk at Kirkland&#x27;s apartment, after one of his guilty clients kills two kids following his acquittal. Porter soon shaves his head, claiming that it will make his hair grow back thicker, but he keeps shaving it. After a violent breakdown inside the courthouse—wherein he ends up throwing dinner plates at everybody in the hallway—Porter is taken to a hospital.

Before leaving in the ambulance, Kirkland asks another partner, Warren Fresnell, to handle Agee&#x27;s court hearing in his absence. Kirkland gives Fresnell a corrected version of Agee&#x27;s probation report and stresses that it must be shown to the judge, so that Agee will receive probation rather than serve jail time. Fresnell arrives at the courthouse late and forgets to give the judge the corrected version, causing Agee to be sentenced to jail time. Kirkland is livid and attacks Fresnell&#x27;s car, revealing that thirty minutes after he was sentenced, Agee died by suicide. Meanwhile, Jeff McCullaugh, who has been sexually and physically assaulted by other inmates, finally snaps and takes two hostages. Kirkland pleads with him to surrender, promising to get him out, but a police sniper shoots and kills McCullaugh when he moves in front of a window.

A clearly disturbed Kirkland takes on Judge Fleming&#x27;s case. Prosecuting attorney Frank Bowers hopes to make his reputation by convicting a judge. Kirkland&#x27;s client Carl Travers hopes to receive free legal services by offering photos of Judge Fleming engaged in bisexual BDSM with a prostitute. Gail reminds Kirkland of his professional obligations to defend the judge. Kirkland shows the pictures to Fleming, who admits that he is a rapist.

At the trial, Fleming jokes that he would like to see his victim again sometime. In his opening statement, Kirkland sarcastically muses about the legal system and Bowers&#x27;s ambition. He surprises everyone by saying that Bowers will not convict Fleming because he will, and he proceeds to accuse his client of being guilty. Kirkland is dragged out of the courtroom, venting his rage the whole way. The spectators cheer for Kirkland, Fleming sits down in defeat, and a fed-up Rayford storms out.

As an exhausted Kirkland sits on the courthouse steps, Jay Porter passes on his way back to work, tipping his wig to Kirkland.

==Production==
Norman Jewison said that he was attracted to the script because it clarified for him the reality that the courtroom is a kind of stage where a drama is played out. He was intrigued by the satirical possibilities of the scenario. He also drew parallels to contemporary politics. &quot;There was a time when the legal profession was inviolate,&quot; he said. &quot;Then came Watergate...We&#x27;re starting to realize that being &quot;in&quot; the law doesn&#x27;t mean being &quot;above&quot; the law.&quot;

He was careful to delineate the film&#x27;s genre. &quot;It&#x27;s difficult at times to pull the audience back. Sometimes they start to go with the film as a melodrama. We were then able to pull them back with something almost absurd, to shock them out of it because I didn&#x27;t want it to become a message picture.&quot;

Barry Levinson&#x27;s high school friend Donald Saointz, a practicing attorney, advised him on the screenplay. When the production got off the ground, Saointz served as an advisor for Al Pacino and John Forsythe. He appears in the film as a defense attorney.

Lee Strasberg took a small role as a way of helping his student and friend. He was worried that Al Pacino was being typecast and wanted to see him branch out. Jewison felt that Pacino&#x27;s role was an inversion of his usual, where Kirkland was the sane person surrounded by nutcases. Pacino liked the fact that Kirkland &quot;was a part of things, not a loner. The sort of characters I usually play are anti-heroes.&quot;

The film was shot in Baltimore, including the courthouse area, the Washington Monument of the Mount Vernon district, and Fort McHenry. Pacino practiced the &quot;You&#x27;re out of order!&quot; scene 26 times at the building ledge. &quot;The Seduction of Joe Tynan&quot; had also recently been shot in Baltimore. Mayor William Donald Schaefer and the city film commission fully supported the production, which spent $1.5 million locally.

==Release==
The film premiered as the closing night gala presentation at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 15, 1979.

==Reception==
&quot;...And Justice for All&quot; scores 78% on Rotten Tomatoes, 58/100 on Metacritic and 23/30 on Zagat. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine calls it a &quot;solid but slightly clichéd courtroom drama&quot; and rates it 3 stars out of 5.

The film was a box-office success. Produced on a modest budget of $4 million, it grossed more than $33.3 million in North America, making it the 24th highest-grossing film of 1979.

Robert Osborne of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; raved, &quot;The film is loaded with virtues...it has all the makings of an enormously popular movie.&quot;

Roger Regent, a French critic, called it one of the most remarkable and important films of the season.

Dewey E. Chester of the &quot;New Pittsburgh Courier&quot; drew parallels to the Watergate scandal and the recent arrest of a state politician on a sodomy charge.

According to &quot;Newsday&quot;, most critics did not like the film.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; felt that the film was so overstuffed that it was an &quot;anthology&quot; held together by &quot;one of those high-voltage Al Pacino performances that&#x27;s so sure of itself we hesitate to demur.&quot; He concluded, &quot;The closing courtroom scenes are constructed as a machine to make the audience cheer, and the machine works.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the general hysteria of the actors as if they had been directed to play &quot;the last act of &quot;Three Men on a Horse&quot;&quot;. He calls Pacino&#x27;s character &quot;a hyperventilating idiot&quot; and speculates that everyone in the film has &quot;such low thresholds of emotional distress that I wouldn&#x27;t trust one of them to see &#x27;The Sound of Music&#x27; unless accompanied by a parent or adult guardian.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; said that the film&#x27;s blend of comedy and drama was unsuccessful but not incompetent.

One critic mused that it was as &quot;commercial as a 60-second K-tel ad and as utterly devoid of substance as a lawyer&#x27;s opening statement.&quot;

&quot;The Jewish Advocate&quot; compared the film unfavorably to &quot;The Hospital&quot; for its inability to match Paddy Chayefsky&#x27;s mordant screenplay. The reviewer described the ending as &quot;a bad &quot;Perry Mason&quot; television show&quot;.

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; lamented the film&#x27;s inability to be a legal version of &quot;Catch-22&quot; and faulted the director. &quot;&#x27;...And Justice For All&#x27; spills its potential drama all over the screen and Jewison never stops to clean up the mess.&quot;

The film has been read as a commentary on the outsider status of Jews in the WASP-dominated judicial system. The opening juxtaposition of the majestic courthouse, with grubby interiors and children mangling the Pledge of Allegiance, sets the film&#x27;s thesis: &quot;the promise of law is at worst superficial and at best idealistic, nearly impossible to experience or achieve&quot;.

William Schoell pointed to Kirkland&#x27;s reaction to Agee&#x27;s suicide as one of the &quot;strongest scenes Pacino has ever played&quot;, and gives the actor credit for &quot;triumphing over an impossible script&quot;. Brian W. Fairbanks also called the film&#x27;s screenplay &quot;overly contrived&quot;.

The film received two Academy Award nominations. Al Pacino was nominated for Best Actor, and Valerie Curtin and Barry Levinson were nominated for Best Original Screenplay. Pacino was also nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance.

==Legacy==
Kirkland&#x27;s opening statement during the film&#x27;s climax contains its most famous moment, including the outburst, &quot;&quot;You&#x27;re&quot; out of order! &quot;You&#x27;re&quot; out of order! The &quot;whole trial&quot; is out of order! &quot;They&#x27;re&quot; out of order!&quot;

Charles Champlin called it the most &quot;rousing finale since &#x27;Rocky I&#x27;&quot;.

&quot;Filmsite&quot; named the scene one of the Best Film Speeches and Monologues.

MSN Canada noted that the whole phrase is one of the top 10 &quot;misquoted movie lines&quot;.

The &quot;&quot;You&#x27;re&quot; out of order!&quot; scene has been parodied many times in popular media, such as in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;The Big Bang Theory.&quot; It is also echoed in Pacino&#x27;s speech in the film &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;.

<doc id="164388" wikidata="Q1757216" url="?curid=164388" title="The Great Santini">
<text>The Great Santini is a 1979 American drama film written and directed by Lewis John Carlino. It is based on the 1976 novel by Pat Conroy. The film stars Robert Duvall, Blythe Danner, and Michael O&#x27;Keefe.

==Plot==
A warrior without a war, Lt. Col. Wilbur &quot;Bull&quot; Meechum, a pilot known as &quot;the Great Santini&quot; to his fellow Marines, sets off with his reluctant family at 3 a.m., moving to the military base town of Beaufort, South Carolina, in peacetime 1962. His wife, Lillian, is loyal and docile, tolerant of Meechum&#x27;s temper and drinking. Their teenage children, Ben and Mary Anne, are accustomed to his stern discipline and behave accordingly while adapting to their new town and school.

Ben&#x27;s talent at basketball earned him a spot on the school team, and he became a dominant player on the court. During one-on-one games with Meechum at home, though, his father refuses to let Ben win, using unnecessarily rough physical tactics and humiliating insults and criticizing the rest of the family when they try to interfere. When Ben finally wins a game, Meechum unleashes a torrent of verbal abuse while bouncing the ball off his head. Later that night, Ben finds his father practising basketball alone in the driveway in the pouring rain. Lillian urges Ben not to be angry at his father and explains that Meechum is showing Ben that he will have to work to compete with his son now. During a school game, Meechum orders Ben to strike back against a rival player who has committed a foul. Ben tackles the player and breaks his arm, getting himself ejected from the game and dismissed from the team.

Ben is befriended by the young black man, Toomer Smalls, whose mother Arrabelle is the family housekeeper. After Toomer uses his beehives to defend himself from a group of racists who come to attack him at home, he is shot. Ben defies his father&#x27;s orders to wait for more help and follows Arrabelle&#x27;s pleas to go out and help Toomer but he dies by the time Meechum confronts them on the road. Ben stands his ground, and Meechum backs down. His CO later tells Meechum he should be proud of his son, because helping Toomer showed the moral courage that Marines strive for.

After seeing Ben and Mary Anne off to the prom together, and insisting on splurging on &quot;the best&quot; dress, Meechum goes out on a routine mission. His engines fail, and he chooses to crash his plane into the sea rather than eject and let the aircraft crash into the nearby town. The family leaves Beaufort after his funeral at 3 a. m. just as they had before, with Ben at the wheel.

==Production notes==
Lewis John Carlino adapted the script from Conroy&#x27;s novel. Carlino also directed the film. The title character, Lt. Col. Wilbur &quot;Bull&quot; Meechum, aka &quot;The Great Santini&quot;, was based on Conroy&#x27;s father.

The story, for the most part, follows the book. The movie&#x27;s major divergence is the absence of Ben Meechum&#x27;s Jewish best friend, Sammy. The spelling of the family&#x27;s surname was also changed from Meecham to Meechum. Also changed is Meechum&#x27;s aircraft; in the book, he flies and commands a squadron of F-8 Crusaders, while in the film, the fighters shown are F-4 Phantom IIs.

Much of the film was shot on location in Beaufort, South Carolina. Tidalholm, the 19th-century house used for the Meechum residence, was later used in &quot;The Big Chill&quot; (1983).

The film was shot in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio but was only produced in that ratio in the LaserDisc format. The VHS and DVD releases are in 1.33:1, also known as full screen or pan and scan. To date the film has not had a release in the Blu-ray format.

===Herman Raucher misattribution===
Herman Raucher is often credited as a ghostwriter for the film. However, Raucher did no work on the film; the misconception arises from the fact that, in the 1980s, Raucher was hired to write a television pilot based on the movie; he only wrote &quot;a couple of pieces,&quot; he explained.

Raucher has stated that, into the 2000s, he continued to receive fan mail for &quot;Santini&quot; and that the volume of letters he received was surpassed only by those for &quot;Summer of &#x27;42&quot;.

==Release==
Warner Bros. executives were concerned that the film&#x27;s plot and lack of bankable actors would make it challenging to market. It premiered in Beaufort in August 1979 and was soon released to empty cinemas in North Carolina and South Carolina. Believing the film&#x27;s title, which implied it was about circus stunts, was the problem, it was tested with other titles: &quot;Sons and Heroes&quot; in Fort Wayne, Indiana, &quot;Reaching Out&quot; in Rockford, Illinois, and &quot;The Ace&quot; in Peoria, Illinois. As it tested better in Peoria, &quot;The Ace&quot; stuck. Even with its new title, the film performed poorly. Orion Pictures pulled the film and sold cable rights to HBO and airline rights to recoup its losses.

Producer Charles A. Pratt still believed in the film and raised enough money (some from Orion) to release &quot;The Great Santini&quot; in New York City under its original title. It received positive reviews, and business was steady. Two weeks later, it debuted on HBO, and audiences stopped coming. Orion executive Mike Medavoy blamed the film&#x27;s box-office failure on a lack of a traditional release: screening it first in New York and expanding markets due to word-of-mouth.

===Critical reception===
The film was well received by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 95% rating based on 20 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Like almost all my favorite films, &quot;The Great Santini&quot; is about people more than it is about a story. It&#x27;s a study of several characters, most unforgettably the Great Santini himself, played by Robert Duvall ... There are moments so unpredictable and yet so natural they feel just like the spontaneity of life itself.&quot; John Simon of &quot;National Review&quot; wrote that &quot;The Great Santini&quot; was &quot;an uneven achievement that nevertheless contains enough of value to justify catching it&quot;.

===Accolades===
== In popular culture ==
Movies and television have referred to the one-on-one basketball game from &quot;The Great Santini&quot; during which Bull Meechum repeatedly bounces the ball off Ben&#x27;s head while asking, &quot;You gonna cry?&quot; Parodies of the scene appear in &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; and in episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;Roseanne&quot;. This movie was referred to in season 2 of the television series &quot;King of the Hill&quot; in the 17th episode &quot;Hank&#x27;s Dirty Laundry&quot;, where Hank mentions that he had rented and returned this movie 23 times.

The scene is invoked in the father–son tetherball match in &quot;Kicking &amp; Screaming&quot;, a comedy in which Robert Duvall plays a tough-love father reminiscent of Bull Meechum. Another reference appears in &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Home 2&quot; in a scene featuring Mel Gibson and Mark Wahlberg.

<text>Paul Johann Ludwig von Heyse (; 15 March 1830 – 2 April 1914) was a German writer and translator. A member of two important literary societies, the &quot;Tunnel über der Spree&quot; in Berlin and &quot;Die Krokodile&quot; in Munich, he wrote novels, poetry, 177 short stories, and about sixty dramas. The sum of Heyse&#x27;s many and varied productions made him a dominant figure among German men of letters. He was awarded the 1910 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;as a tribute to the consummate artistry, permeated with idealism, which he has demonstrated during his long productive career as a lyric poet, dramatist, novelist and writer of world-renowned short stories.&quot; Wirsen, one of the Nobel judges, said that &quot;Germany has not had a greater literary genius since Goethe.&quot; Heyse is the fifth oldest laureate in literature, after Alice Munro, Jaroslav Seifert, Theodor Mommsen and Doris Lessing.

==Life==

===Berlin (1830–54)===
Paul Heyse was born on 15 March 1830 in Heiliggeiststraße, Berlin. His father, the distinguished philologist Karl Wilhelm Ludwig Heyse, was a professor at the University of Berlin who had been the tutor of both Wilhelm von Humboldt&#x27;s youngest son (during 1815–17) and Felix Mendelssohn (during 1819–27). His paternal grandfather Johann Christian August Heyse (21 April 1764, Nordhausen – 27 July 1829, Magdeburg), was a famous German grammarian and lexicographer. Paul Heyse&#x27;s mother was Jewish.

Heyse attended the renamed Friedrich-Wilhelms-Gymnasium until 1847. He was later remembered as a model student. His family connections gained him early entry to the artistic circles of Berlin, where he made the acquaintance of Emanuel Geibel, a man fifteen years his elder who was to become his literary mentor and lifelong friend, and who introduced him to his future father-in-law, the art historian and writer Franz Kugler.

After leaving school Heyse began studying classical philology. He met Jacob Burckhardt, Adolph Menzel, Theodor Fontane and Theodor Storm, and in 1849 joined the &quot;Tunnel über der Spree&quot; literary group. &quot;Frühlingsanfang 1848&quot;, the first of Heyse&#x27;s poems to see print, expressed his enthusiasm for the recent Revolution. After a brief excursion to see the student militias he returned home without joining them, apparently out of consideration for the concerns of his parents and friends.

Having studied for two years at the University of Berlin he left for Bonn in April 1849 in order to study art history and Romance languages. In 1850, he finally resolved on a career as a writer and began a dissertation under the supervision of Friedrich Diez, a pioneer of Romance philology in Germany; but when it was discovered he was conducting an affair with the wife of one of his professors he was sent back to Berlin. Heyse&#x27;s first book, &quot;Der Jungbrunnen&quot; (a collection of tales and poetry) was published anonymously by his father that same year as was his tragedy &quot;Francesca von Rimini&quot;. About the same time, Heyse received from the publisher Alexander Duncker a manuscript by the then-unknown Theodor Storm. Heyse&#x27;s enthusiastic critique of &quot;Sommergeschichten und Lieder&quot; laid the foundations of their future friendship.
In 1851, Heyse won a contest held by the members of the &quot;Tunnel&quot; for the ballad &quot;Das Tal von Espigno&quot;, and his first short story, &quot;Marion&quot; (1852), was similarly honoured. It was followed in 1852 by the &quot;Spanisches Liederbuch&quot;, a collection of translations of poems and folk songs by Geibel and Heyse which was to be a favourite with composers, including Robert Schumann (Opp. 74 &amp; 138), Adolf Jensen (Op. 21) and Hugo Wolf (Lieder collection &quot;Spanisches Liederbuch&quot;, 1891). Wolf also set poems from Heyse&#x27;s collection of 1860 (Lieder collection &quot;Italienisches Liederbuch&quot; 189296). Throughout his career Heyse worked as a translator, above all of Italian literature (Leopardi, Giusti).

Several members of the &quot;Tunnel&quot; began to find its formalities and public nature distasteful, and a smaller circle, the &quot;Rütli&quot;, was formed in December 1852: it included Kugler, Lepel, Fontane, Storm, and Heyse. In May 1852, Heyse was awarded a doctorate for his work on the troubadours, and a Prussian scholarship allowed him to depart for Italy to look for old Provençal manuscripts. He made friends with Arnold Böcklin and Joseph Victor von Scheffel but was banned from the Vatican library after being discovered copying passages from unpublished manuscripts. He returned to Germany in 1853, where, with the Italian landscape still fresh in his mind, he wrote the works which first made him famous: his most famous short story, &quot;L&#x27;Arrabbiata&quot; (&quot;The Fury&quot;, 1853, published in 1855); and the &quot;Lieder aus Sorrent&quot; (&quot;Songs of Sorrento&quot;, 1852/53). Much of his new writing appeared in the &quot;Argo&quot;, the yearbook of the &quot;Rütli&quot; writers.

===Munich (1854–1914)===
Emanuel Geibel persuaded the King of Bavaria, Maximilian II, to grant Heyse a titular professorship in Munich. Heyse was thus appointed professor of Romance philology, although he never taught at that city&#x27;s university. After his marriage on 15 May to Margarete Kugler he arrived in Munich on 25 May 1854. At his first audience with the King, Heyse presented his verse tales, &quot;Hermen&quot;, and began a productive life as one of the &quot;Nordlichtern&quot; (&quot;northern lights&quot;: Geibel, Heyse and Riehl) and establishing another literary society, &quot;Die Krokodile&quot;, which included Felix Dahn, Wilhelm Hertz, Hermann Lingg, Franz von Kobell, the cultural historian Wilhelm Heinrich Riehl, Friedrich Bodenstedt, and the travel writer and art patron Adolf Friedrich von Schack. In December Heyse began a long correspondence with Eduard Mörike.

On 22 August 1855, Heyse&#x27;s first son, Franz, was born. Heyse had four children by his first marriage: Franz (1855–1919), Julie or Lulu (Frau Baumgarten, 1857–1928), Ernst (1859–1871) and Clara (Frau Layriz, 1861–1931). In 1859, obligations to the Kugler family led Heyse to take up a position as editor of the &quot;Literaturblatt zum deutschen Kunstblatt&quot;, and he declined a tempting offer from the Grand Duke Carl Alexander von Weimar which would have involved moving to Thuringia.

On 30 September 1862, his wife Margarete died in Meran of a lung illness. He completed the historical drama, &quot;Ludwig der Bayer&quot; – a Bavarian period piece which Maximilian II had long been eager to see – but its theatrical production was a failure. Nevertheless, Heyse worked throughout the 1860s on new plays, eventually achieving his greatest success with &quot;Kolberg&quot; (1865).

He married Anna Schubart in 1867. Over the next three decades, Heyse continued to write prolifically. Despite a number of bereavements his life was uneventful, and his fame grew steadily until he was a world-famous figure. He was a very early opponent of naturalism, making critical references to it in print long before its influence could be felt in Germany. Younger critics who favoured naturalism made attacks on his writings, to which he replied in &quot;Merlin&quot; (1892): but their influence on the public was negligible. He was dubbed &quot;Dichterfürst&quot;, prince of poetry, and he worked tirelessly to promote international understanding within Europe. He was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1895. In 1900, he was named an honorary citizen of Munich, and several special publications honoured his 70th birthday; and in 1910, he was made a member of the nobility, before being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature on 10 December. He could not attend the ceremony, and was represented in Sweden by Count von Pückler.

His last published works were &quot;Letzten Novellen&quot; and &quot;Italienischen Volksmärchen&quot; (1914). He died on 2 April 1914, several months before the outbreak of World War I, and was buried in the old section of the Waldfriedhof (Nr. 43-W-27).

A street and tunnel in Munich, &quot;Paul-Heyse Strasse&quot; and &quot;Paul-Heyse-Unterführung&quot; are named after him as well as “Heysestrasse” in Hamburg Bergedorf.

<doc id="164390" wikidata="Q200405" url="?curid=164390" title="John Hurt">
<text>Sir John Vincent Hurt (22 January 1940 – 28 January 2017) was an English actor whose career spanned over five decades. He was regarded as one of Britain&#x27;s finest actors. Director David Lynch described him as &quot;simply the greatest actor in the world&quot;. He possessed what was called the &quot;most distinctive voice in Britain&quot;. He received numerous awards including four BAFTAs and a Golden Globe in addition to two Academy Awards nominations. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2015 for his services to drama.

A graduate of RADA (Royal Academy of Dramatic Art), he came to prominence playing Richard Rich in the film &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1966) and won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor for &quot;The Naked Civil Servant&quot; (1975). He played Caligula in the BBC TV series &quot;I, Claudius&quot; (1976). Hurt earned Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor for &quot;Midnight Express&quot; (1978), and Best Actor for &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; (1980). Other films include &quot;Alien&quot; (1979), &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; (1980), &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1984), &quot;White Mischief&quot; (1987), &quot;Scandal&quot; (1989), &quot;The Field&quot; (1990), &quot;King Ralph&quot; (1991), &quot;Rob Roy&quot; (1995), and &quot;Contact&quot; (1997).

Hurt gained further prominence portraying Garrick Ollivander in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series (2001–11), as well as appearing in the 2004 and 2008 Hellboy films, &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; (2005), &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; (2008), &quot;Outlander&quot; (2008), and &quot;Snowpiercer&quot; (2013). He also acted in the acclaimed films &quot;Melancholia&quot; (2011), &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; (2011), &quot;Only Lovers Left Alive&quot; (2013) and &quot;Jackie&quot; (2016).

Hurt reprised his role as Quentin Crisp in &quot;An Englishman in New York&quot; (2009), which brought his seventh BAFTA nomination. He portrayed an incarnation of the Doctor known as the War Doctor in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. He voiced roles in &quot;Watership Down&quot; (1978), &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1978), &quot;The Plague Dogs&quot; (1982), &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; (1985), &quot;Dogville&quot; (2003), &quot;Valiant&quot; (2005) and BBC&#x27;s &quot;Merlin&quot; (2008–2012), as well as &quot;The Gruffalo&#x27;s Child&quot; (2011), and Sailor John in &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends: Sodor&#x27;s Legend of the Lost Treasure&quot; (2015).

== Early life and education ==
John Vincent Hurt was born on 22 January 1940, in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, the son of Arnould Herbert Hurt (1904–1999) and Phyllis (née Massey; 1907–1975). His father had been a mathematician, but became a Church of England clergyman and served as vicar of Holy Trinity Church in Shirebrook, Derbyshire; his mother, a one-time actress, became &quot;the first female draughtsman&quot; at Metropolitan-Vickers in Manchester. In 1937, Hurt&#x27;s father moved his family to Derbyshire, where he became Perpetual Curate of Holy Trinity Church. When Hurt was five, his father became the vicar of St Stephen&#x27;s Church in Woodville, Derbyshire, and remained there until 1953.

At the age of eight, Hurt was sent to the Anglican St Michael&#x27;s Preparatory School in Otford, Kent, where he eventually developed his passion for acting. He decided he wanted to become an actor after his first role as a girl in a school production of &quot;The Blue Bird&quot; by Maurice Maeterlinck. Hurt stated that a senior master at the school would abuse him and others by removing his two false front teeth and putting his tongue in the boys&#x27; mouths, as well as rubbing their faces with his stubble, and that the experience affected him hugely. Hurt, aged 12, became a boarder at Lincoln School (then a grammar school) because he had failed the entrance examination for admission to his brother&#x27;s school. His headmaster at Lincoln School laughed when Hurt told him he wanted to be an actor, telling him, &quot;Well, you may be alright in school plays but you wouldn&#x27;t stand a chance in the profession.&quot;

Hurt&#x27;s father moved to St Aidan&#x27;s Church in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire. In a &quot;Guardian&quot; interview Hurt states the family lived in a vicarage opposite a cinema, but he was not allowed to go there, as films were &quot;frowned upon.&quot; However, watching theatre was considered &quot;fine&quot; and encouraged particularly by his mother, who took him regularly to the repertory theatre in Cleethorpes. His parents disliked his later acting ambitions and encouraged him to become an art teacher instead. Aged 17, Hurt enrolled in Grimsby Art School (now the East Coast School of Art and Design), where he studied art. In 1959, he won a scholarship allowing him to study for an Art Teacher&#x27;s Diploma at Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art in London. Despite the scholarship, paying his tuition fees and living expenses was difficult, so he persuaded some of his friends to pose naked and sold the portraits. In 1960, he won a scholarship to Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, where he trained for two years, graduating in 1962 with an Acting (RADA Diploma).

==Career==
=== 1962–1975 ===
Hurt&#x27;s first film role was as Phil Corbett in the Ralph Thomas directed British romantic drama &quot;The Wild and the Willing&quot; (1962). Hurt starred alongside Virginia Maskell and Paul Rogers. In 1963 he acted in the Kitchen sink drama &quot;This Is My Street&quot;. The following year he appeared in the television series &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Way&quot; episode: The Tin God (1964) as prison escapee Freddy Tisdale.

Hurt&#x27;s first major role was as Richard Rich in the Fred Zinnemann directed historical drama film &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1966). Hurt acted alongside Paul Scofield, Wendy Hiller, Orson Welles, Robert Shaw, Susannah York, and Vanessa Redgrave. The film received critical acclaim and six Academy Awards including Best Picture. Hurt then acted in the British romantic drama &quot;The Sailor from Gibraltar&quot; starring Jeanne Moreau directed by Tony Richardson. He then starred in John Huston&#x27;s raunchy adventure comedy &quot;Sinful Davey&quot; (1969) which critics compared to the film &quot;Tom Jones&quot;. That same year he acted in the British war film &quot;Before Winter Comes&quot; opposite David Niven and the drama &quot;In Search of Gregory&quot; alongside Julie Christie.

He then played Timothy Evans, who was hanged for murders committed by his landlord John Christie, in &quot;10 Rillington Place&quot; (1971), earning him his first BAFTA nomination for Best Supporting Actor. His portrayal of Quentin Crisp in the TV play &quot;The Naked Civil Servant&quot; (1975) gave him prominence and earned him the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor. The following year, Hurt appeared as Anthony John Grey, a crooked computer programming expert in &quot;The Sweeney&quot; episode &quot;Tomorrow Man.&quot;

=== 1976–1980 ===

He won further acclaim for his bravura performance as the Roman emperor Caligula in the BBC drama serial &quot;I, Claudius&quot; (1976). In a much later documentary about the series, &quot;I Claudius: A Television Epic&quot; (2002), Hurt revealed that he had originally declined the role when it was first offered to him, but that series director Herbert Wise had invited him to a special pre-production party, hoping Hurt would change his mind, and that he was so impressed by meeting the rest of the cast and crew that he reversed his decision and took the role.

Hurt appeared in the 1978 film &quot;Midnight Express&quot;, for which he won a Golden Globe and a BAFTA and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (the latter of which he lost to Christopher Walken for his performance in &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;). Around the same time, he lent his voice to Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s animated film adaptation of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, playing the role of Aragorn. Hurt voiced Hazel, the heroic rabbit leader of his warren in the film adaptation of &quot;Watership Down&quot; (both 1978) and later played the major villain, General Woundwort, in the animated television series version.

His other roles in the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s included Kane, the first victim of the title creature in the Ridley Scott directed film &quot;Alien&quot; (1979). He reprised the role as a parody in &quot;Spaceballs&quot;. In 1980 he portrayed the deformed Joseph Merrick in David Lynch&#x27;s biographical drama film &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; (1980). Hurt starred alongside Anthony Hopkins, John Gielgud, and Anne Bancroft. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised his performance writing, &quot;John Hurt, in complex and intricate prosthetics, plays Merrick with an unforgettably distinctive, gentle, quavering voice&quot;. He won another the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. He was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama.

That same year he starred in Michael Cimino&#x27;s epic Western &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; starring Kris Kristofferson, Christopher Walken, and Sam Waterston. The following year he portrayed Jesus Christ in the Mel Brooks comedy film &quot;History of the World, Part I&quot; (1981). Also in 1981 he starred in Delbert Mann&#x27;s thriller &quot;Night Crossing&quot; (1981).

=== 1981–1999 ===
Hurt also had a starring role in Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s critically panned but moderately successful final film, &quot;The Osterman Weekend&quot; (1983). Also in this period, he starred as the Fool opposite Laurence Olivier&#x27;s King in &quot;King Lear&quot; (1983). Hurt also appeared as Raskolnikov in a BBC television adaptation of &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; (1979).

Hurt voiced Snitter in &quot;The Plague Dogs&quot;, played Winston Smith in the film adaptation of George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1984) and starred in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; (1985), voicing the film&#x27;s main antagonist, the Horned King. Hurt provided the voiceover for &quot;&quot;, a 1986 public information film warning of the dangers of AIDS, and played the title role, the on-screen narrator, in Jim Henson&#x27;s television series &quot;The StoryTeller&quot; (1988). Hurt appeared in the 1987 Bob Clark-directed movie &quot;From the Hip&quot;.

He had a supporting role as &quot;Bird&quot; O&#x27;Donnell in Jim Sheridan&#x27;s film &quot;The Field&quot; (1990), which garnered him another BAFTA nomination. In this film, Hurt starred alongside Richard Harris who earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. In King Ralph (1991) Hurt played Lord Percival Graves. Hurt portrayed James Graham, 1st Duke of Montrose in the historical drama &quot;Rob Roy&quot; opposite Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange and Tim Roth. That same year he acted in the Jim Jarmusch directed Western &quot;Dead Man&quot; starring Johnny Depp, and Walter Hill&#x27;s Western &quot;Wild Bill&quot; (1995) with Jeff Bridges.

In 1997 he starred in Richard Kwietniowski&#x27;s &quot;Love and Death on Long Island&quot; for which he was nominated for the BIFA for Best Performance by an Actor in a British Independent Film. He was cast as the reclusive tycoon S. R. Hadden in &quot;Contact&quot; (1997). During this time, Hurt provided narration on the British musical group Art of Noise&#x27;s concept album &quot;The Seduction of Claude Debussy&quot; and narrated a four-part TV series &quot;The Universe&quot; (1999).

=== 2000–2017 ===

In the first &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film, &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001), he played Mr Ollivander, the wand-maker. He returned for the adaptation of &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, though his scenes in that film were cut. He also returned for &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot;. In the 2006 film &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, he played the role of Adam Sutler, leader of the Norsefire fascist dictatorship and in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; (2008) he appeared as Harold Oxley.

He voiced the Great Dragon Kilgharrah, who aids the young warlock Merlin as he protects the future King Arthur, in the BBC television series &quot;Merlin&quot; (also 2008). In 2011, he narrated the BBC documentary &quot;Planet Dinosaur&quot;, a dinosaur-centered documentary completely shown through CGI.

More than thirty years after &quot;The Naked Civil Servant&quot;, Hurt reprised the role of Quentin Crisp in the 2009 film &quot;An Englishman in New York&quot;. This television film depicts Crisp&#x27;s later years in New York. He returned to Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, playing the on-screen Big Brother for the Paper Zoo Theatre Company&#x27;s stage adaptation of the novel in June 2009. The theatre production premiered at the National Media Museum, in Bradford and toured in 2010. Hurt said, &quot;I think Paper Zoo thought it would be quite ironic to have the person who played Winston having risen in the party. From the Chestnut Tree Cafe, he&#x27;s managed to get his wits together again, now understanding that 2 and 2 make 5, and becomes Big Brother. So it tickled my fancy, and of course, I looked up Paper Zoo, and they seem to me to be the sort of company that&#x27;s essential in the country as we know it, and doing a lot of really good stuff.&quot;

At the 65th British Academy Film Awards Hurt won the award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema. In 2013, Hurt first appeared in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot; as an unplaced incarnation of the Doctor. His character is named as the War Doctor in the mini-episode &quot;The Night of the Doctor&quot;; his character is given focus in the 50th anniversary episode &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, He reprised the role on audio for Big Finish Productions in a series of audio stories starting from 2015 to 2017, completing twelve episodes over four box sets. He also played the title character in an audio drama adaptation of &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; for the company, for which he was nominated for a BBC Audio Drama Award.

During Terry Gilliam&#x27;s eighth attempt at making his development hell project &quot;The Man Who Killed Don Quixote&quot;, Hurt was set to star as Don Quixote alongside Adam Driver. However, his declining health and eventual death led the project to be cancelled yet again; he was eventually replaced by Jonathan Pryce.

Hurt was due to appear alongside Ben Kingsley in a film entitled &quot;Broken Dream&quot;, to be directed by Neil Jordan. In 2015, Hurt guest stars the voice of Sailor John, the main antagonist in the &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; film &quot;Sodor&#x27;s Legend of the Lost Treasure&quot; along with Eddie Redmayne (Ryan) and Jamie Campbell Bower (Skiff). At the time of his death he had completed filming &quot;That Good Night&quot;, in which he played a terminally ill writer. Hurt was initially cast as Neville Chamberlain in &quot;Darkest Hour&quot;. However, according to Gary Oldman, Hurt was undergoing treatment for pancreatic cancer, and dropped the role in pre-production; actor Ronald Pickup assumed the role of Chamberlain instead.

==Personal life==

Hurt had an older brother, Br. Anselm (born Michael), a Roman Catholic convert who became a monk and writer at Glenstal Abbey; Hurt contributed to his brother&#x27;s books. Hurt also had an adopted sister, Monica. In 1962, Hurt&#x27;s father left his parish in Cleethorpes to become headmaster of St Michael&#x27;s College in the Central American country of British Honduras. Hurt&#x27;s mother died in 1975, and his father died in 1999 at the age of 95.

In 1962, Hurt married actress Annette Robertson. The marriage ended in 1964. In 1967, he began his longest relationship with Marie-Lise Volpeliere-Pierrot, a French model. The couple had planned to get married after 15 years together. On 26 January 1983, Hurt and Volpeliere-Pierrot went horse riding early in the morning near their house in Ascott-under-Wychwood, Oxfordshire; Volpeliere-Pierrot was thrown from her horse. She went into a coma and died later that day.

In September 1984, Hurt married his old friend, Donna Peacock, an American actress, at a local Register Office. The couple moved to Kenya but divorced in January 1990.

On 24 January 1990, Hurt married Joan Dalton, an American production assistant, whom he had met while filming &quot;Scandal&quot;. With her, he had two sons. This marriage ended in 1996 and was followed by a seven-year relationship with Sarah Owens, a Dublin-born presenter and writer. The couple moved to County Wicklow, where they settled close to their friends, director John Boorman and Claddagh Records founder and Guinness heir Garech Browne. In July 2002, the couple separated. In March 2005, Hurt married his fourth wife, Anwen Rees-Meyers, an advertising film producer. He gave up smoking and drinking during his fourth marriage. He lived in Cromer, Norfolk.

In 2007, Hurt took part in the BBC genealogical television series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, which investigated part of his family history. Prior to the programme, Hurt had harboured a love of Ireland and was enamoured of a &quot;deeply beguiling&quot; family legend that suggested his great-grandmother had been the illegitimate daughter of a Marquess of Sligo. The genealogical evidence uncovered seemed to contradict the family legend, rendering the suggestion doubtful. The search revealed that his great-grandmother had previously lived in Grimsby, at a location within a mile of the art college at which Hurt had been a student.

In 2016, Hurt announced he was in favour of the United Kingdom voting to remain in the EU.

== Illness and death ==

On 16 June 2015, Hurt publicly announced that he had been diagnosed with early-stage pancreatic cancer. He confirmed that he would continue to work while undergoing treatment and said that both he and the medical team treating him were &quot;more than optimistic about a satisfactory outcome.&quot; Following treatment, he stated that his cancer was in remission on 12 October 2015. Hurt died at his home in Cromer, Norfolk, on 28 January 2017.

==Awards and honours==
Honours

In 2004, Hurt was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). He was created a Knight Bachelor in the 2015 New Year Honours for services to drama. On 17 July 2015, he attended an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle where he received the accolade from Queen Elizabeth II.

In 2012, he was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his album cover for the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admired.

In 2014, he received the Will Award, presented by the Shakespeare Theatre Company, along with Stacy Keach and Dame Diana Rigg. The John Hurt Centre opened in September 2016 and is an education and exhibition space located at Cinema City, Norwich.

Charity patron
Since 2003, Hurt was a patron of the Proteus Syndrome Foundation, both in the United Kingdom and in the US. Proteus syndrome is the condition that Joseph Merrick, who Hurt played (renamed as John Merrick) in &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, is thought to have suffered from, although Merrick&#x27;s exact condition is still not known with certainty.

From 2006, Hurt had been a patron of Project Harar, a UK-based charity working in Ethiopia for children with facial disfigurements. Hurt was announced as patron of Norwich Cinema City in March 2013.

In 2014, Hurt designed a Paddington Bear statue which was placed outside the British Museum. It was one of fifty statues of Paddington located around London prior to the release of the film &quot;Paddington&quot; which were auctioned to raise funds for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).

University degrees and appointments

In January 2002, Hurt received an honorary degree from the University of Derby. In January 2006 he received an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters from the University of Hull. In 2012 he was appointed provost of Norwich University College of the Arts, and became its first chancellor when the college became a full university in 2013. On 23 January 2013, he was given an Honorary Doctor of Arts by the University of Lincoln, at Lincoln Cathedral.

<doc id="164391" wikidata="Q6899019" url="?curid=164391" title="Monetary policy of the United States">
<text>The monetary policy of the United States is the set of policies which the Federal Reserve follows to achieve its twin objectives of high employment and stable inflation.

The US central bank, The Federal Reserve System, colloquially known as &quot;The Fed&quot;, was created in 1913 by the Federal Reserve Act as the monetary authority of the United States. The Federal Reserve&#x27;s board of governors along with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) are consequently the primary arbiters of monetary policy in the United States.

The U.S. Congress has established three key objectives for monetary policy in the Federal Reserve Act: maximizing employment, stabilizing prices, and moderating long-term interest rates. Because long-term interest rates remain moderate in a stable economy with low expected inflation, the last objective will be fulfilled automatically together with the first two ones, so that the objectives are often referred to as a dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices. The Fed operationalizes its objective of stable prices as following an inflation target of 2% annual inflation on average.

The Federal Reserve&#x27;s main monetary policy instrument is its Federal funds rate target. By adjusting this target, the Fed affects a wide range of market interest rates and in turn indirectly affects stock prices, wealth and currency exchange rates. Through these variables, monetary policy influences spending, investment, production, employment and inflation in the United States. These channels are collectively known as the monetary transmission mechanism. Effective monetary policy complements fiscal policy to support economic stability, dampening the impact of business cycles.

Besides conducting monetary policy, the Fed is tasked to promote the stability of the financial system and regulate financial institutions, and to act as lender of last resort. In addition, 
the Fed should foster safety and efficiency in the payment and settlement system and promote consumer protection and community development.

== Interest rates and transmission mechanism ==


Monetary policy works by stimulating or suppressing the overall demand for goods and services in the economy, which will tend to increase respectively diminish employment and inflation. The Federal Reserve&#x27;s primary means to this end is adjusting the target for the Federal funds rate (FFR) suitably. Changes in the Federal funds rate targets normally affect the interest rates that banks and other lenders charge on loans to firms and households, which will in turn impact private investment and consumption. Interest rate changes also affect asset prices like stock prices and house prices, which again influence households&#x27; consumption decisions through a wealth effect. Additionally, international interest rate differentials affect exchange rates and consequently US exports and imports. Consumption, investment and net exports are all important components of aggregate demand.

Hence, by lowering the federal funds rate the Federal Reserve can stimulate aggregate demand, raising employment levels and inflation when inflation falls short of the 2% annual inflation target. Conversely, when inflation is too high, the Fed can tighten monetary policy by raising the federal funds rate, which will diminish economic activity and consequently dampen inflation. The various channels summarized above through which the Federal Reserve&#x27;s actions affect the general interest rate level and consequently the overall economy are collectively referred to as the monetary transmission mechanism.

In some cases, the Fed may raise the FFR to the extent that the shorter term interest rates rise sufficiently to climb above their longer maturity bonds, causing an inverted yield curve. This scenario usually predates a recession, which is deflationary.

== Implementation and policy tools ==

The Federal funds rate is a market interest rate, being the rate at which banks and credit unions lend reserve balances to each other overnight on an uncollateralized basis. The Fed consequently does not determine this rate directly, but has over time used various means to influence the rate. Until the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the Fed relied on open market operations, i.e. selling and buying securities in the open market to adjust the supply of reserve balances so as to keep the FFR close to the Fed&#x27;s target. However, since 2008 the actual conduct of monetary policy implementation has changed considerably, using instead various administered interest rates (i.e., interest rates that are set directly by the Fed rather than being determined by the market forces of supply and demand) as the primary tools to steer short-term market interest rate towards the Fed&#x27;s policy target, which from December 2008 has been expressed as a range of 25 basis points.

The present implementation regime, which has evolved since the Financial Crisis, is referred to as an &quot;ample-reserves regime&quot; as opposed to the earlier limited-reserves regime. In 2019, the Fed announced that it would continue to use this implementation regime over the longer run. The Fed&#x27;s central policy tools are the interest on reserve balances rate (IORB) and the overnight reverse repurchase agreement offering rate (ON RRP rate). They are administered rates which the Fed pays on funds that commercial banks hold in their reserve balance accounts at the Fed and funds that large nonbank financial institutions deposit at the Fed, respectively. These rates set a floor on the rates at which banks are willing to lend excess cash to other private market participants. At the same time, the Fed operates a discount window in which it lends funds to banks at the discount rate (a third administered rate), which puts a ceiling on the federal funds rate, as banks are unlikely to borrow elsewhere at a higher interest rate than the discount rate. Open-market operations are no longer used to steer the FR, but still form part of the over-all monetary policy toolbox, as they are used to always maintain an ample supply of reserves.

To sum up, the policy instruments in the current ample-reserves regime are:
* Interest on reserve balances (IORB) - an administered interest rate paid on funds that commercial bankshold in their reserve balance accounts at the Fed
* Overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility - the Fed&#x27;s offer to many large nonbank financial institutions to deposit funds at the Fed and earn interest
* Discount window - the Fed&#x27;s lending to banks at the discount rate
* Open market operations - the Fed&#x27;s buying and selling of securities to maintain an ample supply of reserves

Reserve requirements, which have formerly been used as a policy tool to manipulate the money supply and in turn market interest rates, are no longer used as a policy tool, and indeed in March 2020 were effectively abolished when the Fed&#x27;s reserve requirement ratios were set to zero.

==Money supply==

Monetary policy also generally affects the money supply. At times, changes in money supply measures have been closely related to important economic variables like GDP growth and inflation, and the Federal Reserve has earlier used these measures as an important guide in the conduct of monetary policy. In recent decades, however, these relationships have been quite unstable, and the importance of the money supply in this respect has consequently diminished over the years. Today, the Federal Open Market Committee reviews money supply data as just one part of a wide array of various financial and economic data which form the background for the Committee&#x27;s monetary policy decisions,

The economy&#x27;s aggregate money supply is the total of
* M0 money, or monetary base - &quot;dollars&quot; in currency and bank money balances credited to the central bank&#x27;s depositors, which are backed by the central bank&#x27;s assets,
* plus M1, M2, M3 money - &quot;dollars&quot; in the form of bank money balances credited to banks&#x27; depositors, which are backed by the bank&#x27;s assets and investments.

The money supply thus has different components, generally broken down into &quot;narrow&quot; and &quot;broad&quot; money, reflecting the different degrees of liquidity (&#x27;spendability&#x27;) of each different type, as broader forms of money can be converted into narrow forms of money (or may be readily accepted as money by others, such as personal checks). For example, demand deposits are technically promises to pay on demand, while savings deposits are promises to pay subject to some withdrawal restrictions, and Certificates of Deposit are promises to pay only at certain specified dates; each can be converted into money, but &quot;narrow&quot; forms of money can be converted more readily.

The Federal Reserve presently directly controls only the most narrow form of money, physical cash outstanding; the Federal Reserve indirectly &quot;influences&quot; the supply of other types of money. Until 2020, the Federal Reserve also used reserve requirements, enabling it to directly ensure a minimum of reserve balances of commercial banks, which together with outstanding cash makes up the monetary base (known also as M0). In March 2020, however, the Fed reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero, effectively abandoning this instrument and relying instead on interest rates on reserves to influence commercial banks&#x27; behavior.

Broad money includes money held in deposit balances in banks and other forms created in the financial system. Basic economics also teaches that the money supply shrinks when loans are repaid; however, the money supply will not necessarily decrease depending on the creation of new loans and other effects. Other than loans, investment activities of commercial banks and the Federal Reserve also increase and decrease the money supply. Discussion of &quot;money&quot; often confuses the different measures and may lead to misguided commentary on monetary policy and misunderstandings of policy discussions.

==Structure of modern US institutions==

The Fed is largely concerned with policies related to the issuance of loans (including reserve rate and interest rates), along with other policies that determine the size and rate of growth of the money supply (such as buying and selling government bonds), whereas the Treasury deals directly with minting and printing as well as budgeting the government.

===Federal Reserve===
Monetary policy in the US is determined and implemented by the US Federal Reserve System, commonly referred to as the Federal Reserve. Established in 1913 by the Federal Reserve Act to provide central banking functions, the Federal Reserve System is a quasi-public institution. Ostensibly, the Federal Reserve Banks are 12 private banking corporations; they are independent in their day-to-day operations, but legislatively accountable to Congress through the auspices of Federal Reserve Board of Governors.

The Board of Governors is an independent governmental agency consisting of seven officials and their support staff of over 1800 employees headquartered in Washington, D.C. It is independent in the sense that the Board currently operates without official obligation to accept the requests or advice of any elected official with regard to actions on the money supply, and its methods of funding also preserve independence. The Governors are nominated by the President of the United States, and nominations must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. There is very strong economic consensus that independence from political influence is good for monetary policy.

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is composed of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and 5 out of the 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents; the monetary policy is implemented by all twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks. The presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks are nominated by each bank&#x27;s respective Board of Directors, but must also be approved by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board is generally considered to have the most important position, followed by the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Federal Reserve System is primarily funded by interest collected on their portfolio of securities from the US Treasury, and the Fed has broad discretion in drafting its own budget, but, historically, nearly all the interest the Federal Reserve collects is rebated to the government each year.

The Federal Reserve&#x27;s present-day &quot;dual mandate&quot; monetary policy objectives to keep prices stable and unemployment low has replaced past practices under a gold standard where the main concern was the gold equivalent of the local currency, or under a gold exchange standard where the concern is fixing the exchange rate versus another gold-convertible currency (previously practiced worldwide under the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944 via fixed exchange rates to the U.S. dollar).

The Fed operationalizes its goal of a stable price level as a 2% annual inflation target. In August 2020, after undershooting its 2% inflation target for years, the Fed announced it would be allowing inflation to temporarily rise higher, in order to target an average of 2% over the longer term.

===U.S. Treasury===


The Treasury is the ultimate agency on fiscal policy and is responsible for printing &amp; minting federal reserve notes and treasurys. A United States Treasury security is an IOU from the US Government. It is a government debt instrument issued by the United States Department of the Treasury to finance government spending as an alternative to taxation. Treasury securities are often referred to simply as &quot;Treasuries&quot;. Since 2012 the management of government debt has been arranged by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, succeeding the Bureau of the Public Debt.

===Private commercial banks===

When money is deposited in a bank, it can then be lent out to another person. If the initial deposit was $100 and the bank lends out $100 to another customer the money supply has increased by $100. However, because the depositor can ask for the money back, banks have to maintain minimum reserves to service customer needs. If the reserve requirement is 10% then, in the earlier example, the bank can lend $90 and thus the money supply increases by only $90. The reserve requirement therefore acts as a limit on this multiplier effect. Because the reserve requirement only applies to the more narrow forms of money creation (corresponding to M1), but does not apply to certain types of deposits (such as time deposits), reserve requirements play a limited role in monetary policy.

==Money creation==

As on Nov 2021 the US government maintains over US$2214.3 billion in cash money (primarily Federal Reserve Notes) in circulation throughout the world, up from a sum of less than $30 billion in 1959. Below is an outline of the process which is currently used to control the amount of money in the economy. The amount of money in circulation generally increases to accommodate money demanded by the growth of the country&#x27;s production. The process of money creation usually goes as follows:
# Banks go through their daily transactions. Of the total money deposited at banks, significant and predictable proportions often remain deposited, and may be referred to as &quot;core deposits&quot;. Banks use the bulk of &quot;non-moving&quot; money (their stable or &quot;core&quot; deposit base) by loaning it out. Banks have a legal obligation to keep a certain fraction of bank deposit money on-hand at all times.
# In order to raise additional money to cover excess spending, Congress increases the size of the National Debt by issuing securities typically in the form of a Treasury Bond (see United States Treasury security). It offers the Treasury security for sale, and someone pays cash to the government in exchange. Banks are often the purchasers of these securities, and these securities currently play a crucial role in the process.
# The 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, which consists of the heads of the Federal Reserve System (the seven Federal governors and five bank presidents), meets eight times a year to determine how they would like to influence the economy. They create a plan called the country&#x27;s &quot;monetary policy&quot; which sets targets for things such as interest rates.
# Every business day, the Federal Reserve System engages in Open market operations. If the Federal Reserve wants to increase the money supply, it will buy securities (such as U.S. Treasury Bonds) anonymously from banks in exchange for dollars. If the Federal Reserve wants to decrease the money supply, it will sell securities to the banks in exchange for dollars, taking those dollars out of circulation. When the Federal Reserve makes a purchase, it credits the seller&#x27;s reserve account (with the Federal Reserve). The money that it deposits into the seller&#x27;s account is not transferred from any existing funds, therefore it is at this point that the Federal Reserve has created High-powered money.
# By means of open market operations, the Federal Reserve affects the free reserves of commercial banks in the country. Anna Schwartz explains that &quot;if the Federal Reserve increases reserves, a single bank can make loans up to the amount of its excess reserves, creating an equal amount of deposits&quot;.
# Since banks have more free reserves, they may loan out the money, because holding the money would amount to accepting the cost of foregone interest. When a loan is granted, a person is generally granted the money by adding to the balance on their bank account.
# This is how the Federal Reserve&#x27;s high-powered money is multiplied into a larger amount of broad money, through bank loans; as written in a particular case study, &quot;as banks increase or decrease loans, the nation&#x27;s (broad) money supply increases or decreases.&quot; Once granted these additional funds, the recipient has the option to withdraw physical currency (dollar bills and coins) from the bank, which will reduce the amount of money available for further on-lending (and money creation) in the banking system.
# In many cases, account-holders will request cash withdrawals, so banks must keep a supply of cash handy. When they believe they need more cash than they have on hand, banks can make requests for cash with the Federal Reserve. In turn, the Federal Reserve examines these requests and places an order for printed money with the US Treasury Department. The Treasury Department sends these requests to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (to make dollar bills) and the Bureau of the Mint (to stamp the coins).
# The U.S. Treasury sells this newly printed money to the Federal Reserve for the cost of printing. This is about 6 cents per bill for any denomination. Aside from printing costs, the Federal Reserve must pledge collateral (typically government securities such as Treasury bonds) to put new money, which does not replace old notes, into circulation. This printed cash can then be distributed to banks, as needed.

Though the Federal Reserve authorizes and distributes the currency printed by the Treasury (the primary component of the narrow monetary base), the broad money supply is primarily created by commercial banks through the money multiplier mechanism. One textbook summarizes the process as follows:

&quot;The Fed&quot; controls the money supply in the United States by controlling the amount of loans made by commercial banks. New loans are usually in the form of increased checking account balances, and since checkable deposits are part of the money supply, the money supply increases when new loans are made ...

This type of money is convertible into cash when depositors request cash withdrawals, which will require banks to limit or reduce their lending. The vast majority of the broad money supply throughout the world represents current outstanding loans of banks to various debtors. A very small amount of U.S. currency still exists as &quot;United States Notes&quot;, which have no meaningful economic difference from Federal Reserve notes in their usage, although they departed significantly in their method of issuance into circulation. The currency distributed by the Federal Reserve has been given the official designation of &quot;Federal Reserve Notes&quot;.

==Uncertainties==
A few of the uncertainties involved in monetary policy decision making are described by the federal reserve:
*While these policy choices seem reasonably straightforward, monetary policy makers routinely face certain notable uncertainties. First, the actual position of the economy and growth in aggregate demand at any time are only partially known, as key information on spending, production, and prices becomes available only with a lag. Therefore, policy makers must rely on estimates of these economic variables when assessing the appropriate course of policy, aware that they could act on the basis of misleading information. Second, exactly how a given adjustment in the federal funds rate will affect growth in aggregate demand—in terms of both the overall magnitude and the timing of its impact—is never certain. Economic models can provide rules of thumb for how the economy will respond, but these rules of thumb are subject to statistical error. Third, the growth in aggregate supply, often called the growth in potential output, cannot be measured with certainty.
*In practice, as previously noted, monetary policy makers do not have up-to-the-minute information on the state of the economy and prices. Useful information is limited not only by lags in the collection and availability of key data but also by later revisions, which can alter the picture considerably. Therefore, although monetary policy makers will eventually be able to offset the effects that adverse demand shocks have on the economy, it will be some time before the shock is fully recognized and—given the lag between a policy action and the effect of the action on aggregate demand—an even longer time before it is countered. Add to this the uncertainty about how the economy will respond to an easing or tightening of policy of a given magnitude, and it is not hard to see how the economy and prices can depart from a desired path for a period of time.
*The statutory goals of maximum employment and stable prices are easier to achieve if the public understands those goals and believes that the Federal Reserve will take effective measures to achieve them.
*Although the goals of monetary policy are clearly spelled out in law, the means to achieve those goals are not. Changes in the FOMC&#x27;s target federal funds rate take some time to affect the economy and prices, and it is often far from obvious whether a selected level of the federal funds rate will achieve those goals.

==Opinions of the Federal Reserve==
The Federal Reserve is lauded by some economists, while being the target of scathing criticism by other economists, legislators, and sometimes members of the general public. The former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Ben Bernanke, is one of the leading academic critics of the Federal Reserve&#x27;s policies during the Great Depression.

===Achievements===
One of the functions of a central bank is to facilitate the transfer of funds through the economy, and the Federal Reserve System is largely responsible for the efficiency in the banking sector. There have also been specific instances which put the Federal Reserve in the spotlight of public attention. For instance, after the stock market crash in 1987, the actions of the Fed are generally believed to have aided in recovery. Also, the Federal Reserve is credited for easing tensions in the business sector with the reassurances given following the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States.

===Criticisms===
The Federal Reserve has been the target of various criticisms, involving: accountability, effectiveness, opacity, inadequate banking regulation, and potential market distortion. Federal Reserve policy has also been criticized for directly and indirectly benefiting large banks instead of consumers. For example, regarding the Federal Reserve&#x27;s response to the 2007–2010 financial crisis, Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz explained how the U.S. Federal Reserve was implementing another monetary policy—creating currency—as a method to combat the liquidity trap.

By creating $600 billion and inserting this directly into banks the Federal Reserve intended to spur banks to finance more domestic loans and refinance mortgages. However, banks instead were spending the money in more profitable areas by investing internationally in emerging markets. Banks were also investing in foreign currencies which Stiglitz and others point out may lead to currency wars while China redirects its currency holdings away from the United States.

====Auditing====
The Federal Reserve is subject to different requirements for transparency and audits than other government agencies, which its supporters claim is another element of the Fed&#x27;s independence. Although the Federal Reserve has been required by law to publish independently audited financial statements since 1999, the Federal Reserve is not audited in the same way as other government agencies. Some confusion can arise because there are many types of audits, including: investigative or fraud audits; and financial audits, which are audits of accounting statements; there are also compliance, operational, and information system audits.

The Federal Reserve&#x27;s annual financial statements are audited by an outside auditor. Similar to other government agencies, the Federal Reserve maintains an Office of the Inspector General, whose mandate includes conducting and supervising &quot;independent and objective audits, investigations, inspections, evaluations, and other reviews of Board programs and operations&quot;. The Inspector General&#x27;s audits and reviews are available on the Federal Reserve&#x27;s website.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has the power to conduct audits, subject to certain areas of operations that are excluded from GAO audits; other areas may be audited at specific Congressional request, and have included bank supervision, government securities activities, and payment system activities. The GAO is specifically restricted any authority over monetary policy transactions; the New York Times reported in 1989 that &quot;such transactions are now shielded from outside audit, although the Fed influences interest rates through the purchase of hundreds of billions of dollars in Treasury securities.&quot; As mentioned above, it was in 1999 that the law governing the Federal Reserve was amended to formalize the already-existing annual practice of ordering independent audits of financial statements for the Federal Reserve Banks and the Board; the GAO&#x27;s restrictions on auditing monetary policy continued, however.

Congressional oversight on monetary policy operations, foreign transactions, and the
FOMC operations is exercised through the requirement for reports and through semi-annual monetary policy hearings. Scholars have conceded that the hearings did not prove an effective means of increasing oversight of the Federal Reserve, perhaps because &quot;Congresspersons prefer to bash an autonomous and secretive Fed for economic misfortune rather than to share the responsibility for that misfortune with a fully accountable Central Bank&quot;, although the Federal Reserve has also consistently lobbied to maintain its independence and freedom of operation.

====Fulfillment of wider economic goals====
By law, the goals of the Fed&#x27;s monetary policy are: high employment, sustainable growth, and stable prices.

Critics say that monetary policy in the United States has not achieved consistent success in meeting the goals that have been delegated to the Federal Reserve System by Congress. Congress began to review more options with regard to macroeconomic influence beginning in 1946 (after World War II), with the Federal Reserve receiving specific mandates in 1977 (after the country suffered a period of stagflation).

Throughout the period of the Federal Reserve following the mandates, the relative weight given to each of these goals has changed, depending on political developments. In particular, the theories of Keynesianism and monetarism have had great influence on both the theory and implementation of monetary policy, and the &quot;prevailing wisdom&quot; or consensus view of the economic and financial communities has changed over the years.

* Elastic currency (magnitude of the money multiplier): the success of monetary policy is dependent on the ability to strongly influence the supply of money available to the citizens. If a currency is highly &quot;elastic&quot; (that is, has a higher money multiplier, corresponding to a tendency of the financial system to create more broad money for a given quantity of base money), plans to expand the money supply and accommodate growth are easier to implement. Low elasticity was one of many factors that contributed to the depth of the Great Depression: as banks cut lending, the money multiplier fell, and at the same time the Federal Reserve constricted the monetary base. The depression of the late 1920s is generally regarded as being the worst in the country&#x27;s history, and the Federal Reserve has been criticized for monetary policy which worsened the depression. Partly to alleviate problems related to the depression, the United States transitioned from a gold standard and now uses a fiat currency; elasticity is believed to have been increased greatly.

* High employment – Unemployment has experienced significant increases on occasion, despite the efforts of the Federal Reserve. These periods include the early 1990s recession caused by the savings and loan crisis, the bursting of the dot-com bubble and the 2006 bursting of the housing bubble plus the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis. In some cases, the Federal Reserve intentionally sacrificed employment levels in order to rein in spiralling inflation, as was the case for the Early 1980s recession, which was induced to alleviate a stagflation problem.
* Stable prices – While some economists would regard any consistent inflation as a sign of unstable prices, policymakers could be satisfied with 1 or 2%; the consensus of &quot;price stability&quot; constituting long-run inflation of 1–2% is, however, a relatively recent development, and a change that has occurred at other central banks throughout the world. Inflation has averaged a 4.2% increase &quot;annually&quot; following the mandates applied in 1977; historic inflation since the establishment of the Federal Reserve in 1913 has averaged 3.4%. In contrast, some research indicates that average inflation for the 250 years before the system was near zero percent, though there were likely sharper upward and downward spikes in that timeframe as compared with more recent times. Central banks in some other countries, notably the German Bundesbank, had considerably better records of achieving price stability drawing on experience from the two episodes of hyperinflation and economic collapse under the country&#x27;s previous central bank.

Inflation worldwide has fallen significantly since former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker began his tenure in 1979, a period which has been called the Great Moderation; some commentators attribute this to improved monetary policy worldwide, particularly in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. BusinessWeek notes that inflation has been relatively low since mid-1980s and it was during this time that Volcker wrote (in 1995), &quot;It is a sobering fact that the prominence of central banks [such as the Federal Reserve] in this century has coincided with a general tendency towards more inflation, not less. By and large, if the overriding objective is price stability, we did better with the nineteenth-century gold standard and passive central banks, with currency boards, or even with &#x27;free banking.&#x27;.&quot;

* Sustainable growth – The growth of the economy may not be sustainable as the ability for households to save money has been on an overall decline and household debt is consistently rising.

====Causes of The Great Depression====

Monetarists believe that the Great Depression started as an ordinary recession, but that significant policy mistakes by monetary authorities (especially the Federal Reserve) caused a shrinking of the money supply, which greatly exacerbated the economic situation, causing a recession to descend into the Great Depression.

====Public confusion====

The concepts involved in monetary policy may be widely misunderstood in the general public, as evidenced by the volume of literature on topics such as &quot;Federal Reserve conspiracy&quot; and &quot;Federal Reserve fraud&quot;.

The Federal Reserve has established a library of information on their websites, however, many experts have spoken about the general level of public confusion that still exists on the subject of the economy; this lack of understanding of macroeconomic questions and monetary policy, however, exists in other countries as well. Critics of the Fed widely regard the system as being &quot;opaque&quot;, and one of the Fed&#x27;s most vehement opponents of his time, Congressman Louis T. McFadden, even went so far as to say that &quot;Every effort has been made by the Federal Reserve Board to conceal its powers. ... &quot;

There are, on the other hand, many economists who support the need for an independent central banking authority, and some have established websites that aim to clear up confusion about the economy and the Federal Reserve&#x27;s operations. The Federal Reserve website itself publishes various information and instructional materials for a variety of audiences.

====Criticism of government interference====
Some economists, especially those belonging to the heterodox Austrian School, criticize the idea of even establishing monetary policy, believing that it distorts investment. Friedrich Hayek won the Nobel Prize for his elaboration of the Austrian business cycle theory.

Briefly, the theory holds that an artificial injection of credit, from a source such as a central bank like the Federal Reserve, sends false signals to entrepreneurs to engage in long-term investments due to a favorably low interest rate. However, the surge of investments undertaken represents an artificial boom, or bubble, because the low interest rate was achieved by an artificial expansion of the money supply and not by savings. Hence, the pool of real savings and resources have not increased and do not justify the investments undertaken.

These investments, which are more appropriately called &quot;malinvestments&quot;, are realized to be unsustainable when the artificial credit spigot is shut off and interest rates rise. The malinvestments and unsustainable projects are liquidated, which is the recession. The theory demonstrates that the problem is the artificial boom which causes the malinvestments in the first place, made possible by an artificial injection of credit not from savings.

According to Austrian economics, without government intervention, interest rates will always be an equilibrium between the time-preferences of borrowers and savers, and this equilibrium is simply distorted by government intervention. This distortion, in their view, is the cause of the business cycle. Some Austrian economists—but by no means all—also support full reserve banking, a hypothetical financial/banking system where banks may not lend deposits. Others may advocate free banking, whereby the government abstains from any interference in what individuals may choose to use as money or the extent to which banks create money through the deposit and lending cycle.

====Reserve requirement====
The Federal Reserve regulates banking, and one regulation under its direct control is the reserve requirement which dictates how much money banks must keep in reserves, as compared to its demand deposits. Banks use their observation that the majority of deposits are not requested by the account holders at the same time.

Until March 2020 the Federal Reserve required that banks keep 10% of their deposits on hand, but in March 2020 the reserve requirement was reduced to zero. Some countries have no nationally mandated reserve requirements—banks use their own resources to determine what to hold in reserve, however their lending is typically constrained by other regulations. Other factors being equal, lower reserve percentages increases the possibility of Bank runs, such as the widespread runs of 1931. Low reserve requirements also allow for larger expansions of the money supply by actions of commercial banks—currently the private banking system has created much of the broad money supply of US dollars through lending activity.

Monetary policy reform calling for 100% reserves has been advocated by economists such as: Irving Fisher, Frank Knight, many ecological economists along with economists of the Chicago School and Austrian School. Despite calls for reform, the nearly universal practice of fractional-reserve banking has remained in the United States.
====Monetary policy and debt====

In 2005, the Federal Reserve held approximately 9% of the national debt as assets against the liability of printed money. In previous periods, the Federal Reserve has used other debt instruments, such as debt securities issued by private corporations. During periods when the national debt of the United States has declined significantly (such as happened in fiscal years 1999 and 2000), monetary policy and financial markets experts have studied the practical implications of having &quot;too little&quot; government debt: both the Federal Reserve and financial markets use the price information, yield curve and the so-called risk free rate extensively.

Experts are hopeful that other assets could take the place of National Debt as the base asset to back Federal Reserve notes, and Alan Greenspan, long the head of the Federal Reserve, has been quoted as saying, &quot;I am confident that U.S. financial markets, which are the most innovative and efficient in the world, can readily adapt to a paydown of Treasury debt by creating private alternatives with many of the attributes that market participants value in Treasury securities.&quot; In principle, the government could still issue debt securities in significant quantities while having no net debt, and significant quantities of government debt securities are also held by other government agencies.

Although the U.S. government receives income overall from seigniorage, there are costs associated with maintaining the money supply. Leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly, claims that &quot;over 95% of our [broad] money supply [in the United States] is created by the private banking system (demand deposits) and bears interest as a condition of its existence&quot;, a conclusion drawn from the Federal Reserve&#x27;s ultimate dependence on increased activity in fractional reserve lending when it exercises open market operations. Economist Eric Miller criticizes Daly&#x27;s logic because money is created in the banking system in response to demand for the money, which justifies cost.

Thus, use of expansionary open market operations typically generates more debt in the private sector of society (in the form of additional bank deposits). The private banking system charges interest to borrowers as a cost to borrow the money. The interest costs are borne by those that have borrowed, and without this borrowing, open market operations would be unsuccessful in maintaining the broad money supply, though alternative implementations of monetary policy could be used. Depositors of funds in the banking system are paid interest on their savings (or provided other services, such as checking account privileges or physical security for their &quot;cash&quot;), as compensation for &quot;lending&quot; their funds to the bank.

Increases (or contractions) of the money supply corresponds to growth (or contraction) in interest-bearing debt in the country.

====Criticism of private sector involvement====
Historically and to the present day, various social and political movements (such as social credit) have criticized the involvement of the private sector in &quot;creating money&quot;, claiming that only the government should have the power to &quot;make money&quot;. Some proponents also support full reserve banking or other non-orthodox approaches to monetary policy. Various terminology may be used, including &quot;debt money&quot;, which may have emotive or political connotations. These are generally considered to be akin to conspiracy theories by mainstream economists and ignored in academic literature on monetary policy.

<text>A tribute (; from Latin &quot;tributum&quot;, &quot;contribution&quot;) is wealth, often in kind, that a party gives to another as a sign of submission, allegiance or respect. Various ancient states exacted tribute from the rulers of lands which the state conquered. In the case of alliances, lesser parties may pay tribute to more powerful parties as a sign of allegiance. Tributes are different from taxes, as they are not collected in the same regularly routine manner that taxes are. Further, with tributes, a recognition of political submission by the payer to the payee is uniquely required.

== Overview ==
The Aztec Empire is another example, as it received tribute from the various city-states and provinces that it conquered.

Ancient China received tribute from various states such as Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Borneo, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Myanmar and Central Asia.

=== Tributes as a form of government ===
The Aztecs used tributes as a means for maintaining control over conquered areas. This meant that rather than replacing existing political figures with Aztec rulers or colonizing newly conquered areas, the Aztecs would simply collect tributes. Ideally, there was no interference in the local affairs of conquered peoples unless these tributes were not paid.

There were two types of provinces that paid tribute to the Aztec Empire. First, there were strategic provinces. These provinces were considered client states, as they consensually paid tributes in exchange for good relations with the Aztecs. Second, there were tributary provinces or tributary states. These provinces were mandated to pay a regular tribute, whether they wanted to or not.

=== The hierarchy of tribute collection ===
Many different levels of Aztec officials were involved in managing the empire&#x27;s tribute system. The lowest ranking officials were known as &quot;calpixque&quot;. Their job was to collect, transport, and receive tributes from each province. Sometimes one calpixque was assigned to an entire province. Other times, multiple calpixques were assigned to each province. This was done to ensure that there was one calpixque present at each of the provinces&#x27; various towns. One rank higher than the calpixque were the &quot;huecalpixque&quot;. They served as managers of the calpixque. Above the huecalpixque were the &quot;petlacalcatl&quot;. Based in Tenochtitlan, they oversaw the entire tribute system. There was also a military trained official known as the &quot;cuahtlatoani&quot;. They were only involved when newly conquered provinces resisted paying tribute.

=== Types of tributes ===
Natural resources were in high demand throughout the Aztec Empire because they were crucial for construction, weaponry and religious ceremonies. Certain regions of Mexico with higher quantities of natural resources were able to pay a larger tribute. The basin of Mexico, for instance, had a large resource pool of obsidian and salt ware. This increased usefulness of such regions and played a role in their social status and mobility throughout the empire. 

As expansion continued with tribute, the demand for warriors to serve the Empire in their efforts to take control of nearby city/state regions increased drastically. &quot;Land belonged to the city-state ruler, and in return for access to land commoners were obliged to provide their lord with tribute in goods and rotational labor service. They could also be called on for military service and construction projects.&quot; It was very common to be called for military service, as it was vital to the expansion of the Aztec Empire.

Tributes to the Aztec Empire were also made through gold, silver, jade and other metals that were important to Aztec culture and seen as valuable.

== China ==
China often received tribute from the states under the influence of Confucian civilization and gave them Chinese products and recognition of their authority and sovereignty in return. There were several tribute states to the Chinese-established empires throughout ancient history, including neighboring countries such as Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Borneo, Indonesia and Central Asia. This tributary system and relationship are well known as Jimi () or Cefeng (), or Chaogong (). In Japanese, the tributary system and relationship is referred to as Shinkou (), Sakuhou () and Choukou ().

According to the Chinese &quot;Book of Han&quot;, the various tribes of Japan (constituting the nation of Wa) had already entered into tributary relationships with China by the first century. However, Japan ceased to present tribute to China and left the tributary system during the Heian period without damaging economic ties. Although Japan eventually returned to the tributary system during the Muromachi period in the reign of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, it did not recommence presenting tribute, and it did not last after Yoshimitsu&#x27;s death (Note that Ashikaga Yoshimitsu was a Shogun, hence technically, he was not the head of the state. Hence, this made him subordinate to both the emperor of Japan and the Chinese emperor at the same time. The Japanese emperor continued to refuse to join the tributary system).

According to the Korean historical document &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot; (), Goguryeo sent a diplomatic representative to the Han dynasty in 32 AD, and Emperor Guangwu of Han officially acknowledged Goguryeo with a title. The tributary relationship between China and Korea was established during the Three Kingdoms of Korea, but in practice it was only a diplomatic formality to strengthen legitimacy and gain access to cultural goods from China. This continued under different dynasties and varying degrees until China&#x27;s defeat in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895. 

The relationship between China and Vietnam was a &quot;hierarchic tributary system&quot;. China ended its suzerainty over Vietnam with the Treaty of Tientsin (1885) following the Sino-French War. Thailand was always subordinate to China as a vassal or a tributary state since the Sui dynasty until the Taiping Rebellion of the late Qing dynasty in the mid-19th century.

Some tributaries of imperial China encompasses suzerain kingdoms from China in East Asia has been prepared. Before the 20th century, the geopolitics of East and Southeast Asia were influenced by the Chinese tributary system. This assured them their sovereignty and the system assured China the incoming of certain valuable assets. &quot;The theoretical justification&quot; for this exchange was the Mandate of Heaven, that stated the fact that the emperor of China was empowered by the heavens to rule, and with this rule the whole mankind would end up being beneficiary of good deeds. Most of the Asian countries joined this system voluntary.

==Islamic Caliphate==

The Islamic Caliphate introduced a new form of tribute, known as the &#x27;jizya&#x27;, that differed significantly from earlier Roman forms of tribute. According to Patricia Seed:

Christians of the Iberian Peninsula translated the term &#x27;jizya&#x27; as &quot;tributo&quot;. This form of tribute was later also applied by the Spanish empire to their territories in the New World.

<doc id="164394" wikidata="Q1345065" url="?curid=164394" title="Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation">
<text>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is a United States government corporation supplying deposit insurance to depositors in American commercial banks and savings banks. The FDIC was created by the Banking Act of 1933, enacted during the Great Depression to restore trust in the American banking system. More than one-third of banks failed in the years before the FDIC&#x27;s creation, and bank runs were common. The insurance limit was initially US$2,500 per ownership category, and this has been increased several times over the years. Since the enactment of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010, the FDIC insures deposits in member banks up to $250,000 per ownership category. FDIC insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the government of the United States, and according to the FDIC, &quot;since its start in 1933 no depositor has ever lost a penny of FDIC-insured funds&quot;.

Deposits placed with non-bank fintech financial technology companies are not protected by the FDIC against failure of the fintech company. If the company places the money in an FDIC-insured bank account consumers are protected only under some conditions.

The FDIC is not supported by public funds; member banks&#x27; insurance dues are its primary source of funding. The FDIC charges premiums based upon the risk that the insured bank poses. When dues and the proceeds of bank liquidations are insufficient, it can borrow from the federal government, or issue debt through the Federal Financing Bank on terms that the bank decides.

, the FDIC provided deposit insurance at 4,517 institutions. As of Q3 2024, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) stood at $129.2 billion, or a 1.21% reserve ratio.

The FDIC also examines and supervises certain financial institutions for safety and soundness, performs certain consumer-protection functions, and manages receiverships of failed banks. Quarterly reports are published indicating details of the banks&#x27; financial performance, including leverage ratio (but not CET1 Capital Requirements &amp; Liquidity Coverage Ratio as specified in Basel III).

==Membership requirements==
To qualify for deposit insurance, member banks must follow certain liquidity and reserve requirements. Banks are classified in five groups according to their risk-based capital ratio:
* Well capitalized: 10% or higher
* Adequately capitalized: 8% or higher
* Undercapitalized: less than 8%
* Significantly undercapitalized: less than 6%
* Critically undercapitalized: less than 2%

When a bank becomes undercapitalized, the institution&#x27;s primary regulator issues a warning to the bank. When the number drops below 6%, the primary regulator can change management and force the bank to take other corrective action. When the bank becomes critically undercapitalized the chartering authority closes the institution and appoints the FDIC as receiver of the bank.

==Insurance coverage==
The FDIC insures deposits at member banks in the event that a bank fails—that is, the bank&#x27;s regulating authority decides that it no longer meets the requirements for remaining in business.

===Covered deposits===

FDIC deposit insurance covers deposit accounts, which, by the FDIC definition, include:
* checking accounts and negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts (interest-bearing checking accounts with a hold option)
* savings accounts and money market deposit accounts (MMDAs, i.e., higher-interest savings accounts subject to check-writing restrictions)
* time deposits including certificates of deposit (CDs)
* outstanding cashier&#x27;s checks, interest checks, and other negotiable instruments drawn on the accounts of the bank
* accounts denominated in foreign currencies
Accounts at different banks are insured separately. All branches of a bank are considered to form a single bank. Also, an Internet bank that is part of a brick and mortar bank is not considered to be a separate bank, even if the name differs. Non-US citizens are also covered by FDIC insurance as long as their deposits are in a domestic office of an FDIC-insured bank.

The FDIC publishes a guide which sets forth the general characteristics of FDIC deposit insurance, and addresses common questions asked by bank customers about deposit insurance.

===Items not insured===
Only the above types of accounts are insured. Some types of uninsured products, even if purchased through a covered financial institution, are:

* Stocks, bonds, and mutual funds including money funds
** The Securities Investor Protection Corporation, a separate institution chartered by Congress, provides protection against the loss of many types of such securities in the event of a brokerage failure, but &quot;not&quot; against a decrease in their values.
** Exceptions have occurred, such as the FDIC bailout of bondholders of Continental Illinois.
* Investments backed by the U.S. government, such as Treasury securities
* The contents of safe deposit boxes.
*: Even though the word deposit appears in the name, under federal law a safe deposit box is not a deposit account – it is merely a secured storage space rented by an institution to a customer.
* Insurance and annuity products, such as life, auto and homeowner&#x27;s insurance.

Deposit accounts are insured only against the failure of a member bank. Deposit losses that occur in the course of the bank&#x27;s business, such as theft, fraud or accounting errors, must be addressed through the bank or state or federal law. 

Deposit insurance also does not cover the failure of non-bank entities that use a bank to offer financial services, e.g. fintech financial technology companies. If the company places the money in an FDIC-insured bank account consumers are protected only under some conditions.

===Ownership categories===
Each ownership category of a depositor&#x27;s money is insured separately up to the insurance limit, and separately at each bank. Thus a depositor with $250,000 in each of three ownership categories at each of two banks would have six different insurance limits of $250,000, for total insurance coverage of $1,500,000. The distinct ownership categories are:
* Single accounts (accounts not falling into any other category)
* Certain retirement accounts (including Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs))
* Joint accounts (accounts with more than one owner with equal rights to withdraw)
* Revocable and irrevocable trust accounts (containing the words &quot;Payable on death&quot;, &quot;In trust for&quot;, etc.)
* Employee Benefit Plan accounts (deposits of a pension plan)
* Corporation/partnership/unincorporated association accounts
* Government accounts

All amounts that a particular depositor has in accounts in any particular ownership category at a particular bank are added together and are insured up to $250,000.

For joint accounts, each co-owner is assumed (unless the account specifically states otherwise) to own the same fraction of the account as does each other co-owner (even though each co-owner may be eligible to withdraw all funds from the account). Thus if three people jointly own a $750,000 account, the entire account balance is insured because each depositor&#x27;s $250,000 share of the account is insured.

The owner of a revocable trust account is generally insured up to $250,000 for each unique beneficiary (subject to special rules if there are more than five of them). Thus if there is a single owner of an account that is specified as in trust for (payable on death to, etc.) three different beneficiaries, the funds in the account are insured up to $750,000.

On January 21, 2022, the Board of Directors passed a Final Rule to simplify the Ownership Categories by combining Revocable and Irrevocable Trusts into a single ownership category. The policy came into effect on April 4, 2022.

On April 1, 2024, the Board of Directors changed how accounts held under the same name would be insured.

==Funds==

The FDIC receives no funding from the federal budget. Instead it assesses premiums on each member and accumulates them in a Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) that it uses to pay its operating costs and the depositors of failed banks. The amount of each bank&#x27;s premiums is based on its balance of insured deposits and the degree of risk that it poses to the FDIC. The DIF is fully invested in Treasury securities and therefore earns interest that supplements the premiums. Under the Dodd–Frank Act of 2010, the FDIC is required to fund the DIF to at least 1.35% of all insured deposits; in 2020, the amount of insured deposits was approximately $8.9 trillion and therefore the fund requirement was $120 billion. During two banking crises—the savings and loan crisis and the 2007–2008 financial crisis—the FDIC has expended its entire insurance fund. On these occasions it has met insurance obligations directly from operating cash, or by borrowing through the Federal Financing Bank. Another option, which it has never used, is a direct line of credit with the Treasury on which it can borrow up to $100 billion.
Between 1989 and 2006, there were two separate FDIC reserve funds: the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF), and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). This division reflected the FDIC&#x27;s assumption of responsibility for insuring savings and loan associations after another federal insurer, the FSLIC, was unable to recover from the savings and loan crisis. The existence of two separate funds for the same purpose led banks to shift business from one to the other, depending on the benefits each could provide. In the 1990s, SAIF premiums were, at one point, five times higher than BIF premiums; several banks attempted to qualify for the BIF, with some merging with institutions qualified for the BIF to avoid the higher premiums of the SAIF. This drove up the BIF premiums as well, resulting in a situation where both funds were charging higher premiums than necessary.

Then-Chair of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan was a critic of the system, saying, &quot;We are, in effect, attempting to use government to enforce two different prices for the same itemnamely, government-mandated deposit insurance. Such price differences only create efforts by market participants to arbitrage the difference.&quot; Greenspan proposed &quot;to end this game and merge SAIF and BIF&quot;. In February 2006, President George W. Bush signed into law the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (FDIRA). Among other purposes, the act merged the BIF and SAIF into a single fund.

As of December 31, 2022, the balance of FDIC&#x27;s Deposit Insurance Fund is $128.2 billion. The year-end balance has increased every year since 2009.

==Resolution of insolvent banks==

Upon a determination that a bank is insolvent, its chartering authority—either a state banking department or the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency—closes it and appoints the FDIC as receiver. In its role as a receiver the FDIC is tasked with protecting the depositors and maximizing the recoveries for the creditors of the failed institution. The FDIC as receiver is functionally and legally separate from the FDIC acting in its corporate role as deposit insurer. Courts have long recognized these dual and separate capacities as having distinct rights, duties and obligations.

The goals of receivership are to market the assets of a failed institution, liquidate them, and distribute the proceeds to the institution&#x27;s creditors. The FDIC as receiver succeeds to the rights, powers, and privileges of the institution and its stockholders, officers, and directors. It may collect all obligations and money due to the institution, preserve or liquidate its assets and property, and perform any other function of the institution consistent with its appointment. It also has the power to merge a failed institution with another insured depository institution and to transfer its assets and liabilities without the consent or approval of any other agency, court, or party with contractual rights. It may form a new institution, such as a bridge bank, to take over the assets and liabilities of the failed institution, or it may sell or pledge the assets of the failed institution to the FDIC in its corporate capacity.

The two most common ways for the FDIC to resolve a closed institution and fulfill its role as a receiver are:
* Purchase and assumption agreement (P&amp;A), in which deposits (liabilities) are assumed by an open bank, which also purchases some or all of the failed bank&#x27;s loans (assets). The bank&#x27;s assets that convey to the FDIC as receiver are sold and auctioned through various methods, including online, and using contractors.
* Deposit payoff: As soon as the appropriate chartering authority closes the bank or thrift, the FDIC is appointed receiver. The FDIC as insurer pays all of the failed institution&#x27;s depositors with insured funds the full amount of their insured deposits. Depositors with uninsured funds and other general creditors (such as suppliers and service providers) of the failed institution do not receive either immediate or full reimbursement; instead, the FDIC as receiver issues them receivership certificates. A receivership certificate entitles its holder to a portion of the receiver&#x27;s collections on the failed institution&#x27;s assets.

Originally the only resolution method was to establish a temporary deposit insurance national bank that assumed the failed bank&#x27;s deposits on behalf of the FDIC. This method fell into disuse after the law was revised in 1935 to allow the other options above, although it has been used occasionally when the FDIC determines that it is the most practical way to continue banking service to the failed bank&#x27;s community.

In 1991, to comply with legislation, the FDIC amended its failure resolution procedures to decrease the costs to the deposit insurance funds. The procedures require the FDIC to choose the resolution alternative that is least costly to the deposit insurance fund of all possible methods for resolving the failed institution. Bids are submitted to the FDIC where they are reviewed and the least cost determination is made.

===Resolution plans===

To assist the FDIC in resolving an insolvent bank, covered institutions are required to submit a resolution plan which can be activated if necessary. In addition to the Bank Holding Company (&quot;BHC&quot;) resolution plans required under the Dodd Frank Act under Section 165(d), the FDIC requires a separate Covered Insured Depository Institution (&quot;CIDI&quot;) resolution plan for US insured depositories with assets of $50 billion or more. Most of the largest, most complex BHCs are subject to both rules, requiring them to file a 165(d) resolution plan for the BHC that includes the BHC&#x27;s core businesses and its most significant subsidiaries (i.e., &quot;material entities&quot;), as well as one or more CIDI plans depending on the number of US bank subsidiaries of the BHC that meet the $50 billion asset threshold.

On December 17, 2014, the FDIC issued guidance for the 2015 resolution plans of CIDIs of large bank holding companies (BHCs). The guidance provides clarity on the assumptions that are to be made in the CIDI resolution plans and what must be addressed and analyzed in the 2015 CIDI resolution plans including:
* The assumption that the CIDI must fail.
* The cause of CIDI failure must be a core business loss or impairment.
* At least one &quot;multiple acquirer strategy&quot; is required in the plan.
* A deep level of granularity is expected in the plan.
* Sales strategies must be feasible and supported by considerable acquirer detail.
* A detailed financial and liquidity analysis is needed.
* Key legal issues must be considered.
* Resolution obstacles must be addressed.
* The CIDI must be insolvent at the start of resolution.

==Board of directors==
The board of directors is the governing body of the FDIC. The board is composed of five members, three appointed by the president of the United States with the consent of the United States Senate and two &quot;ex officio&quot; members. The three appointed members each serve six-year terms. These may continue to serve after the expiration of their terms of office until a successor has taken office. No more than three members of the board may be of the same political affiliation.

The president, with the consent of the Senate, also designates one of the appointed members as chairman of the board, to serve a five-year term and one of the appointed members as vice chairman of the board. The two ex officio members are the Comptroller of the Currency and the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

==History==
===Panics of 1893 and 1907 and the Great Depression: 1893–1933===

Without deposit insurance, bank depositors took the risk that their bank could run out of cash due to losses on its loans or an unexpected surge in withdrawals, leaving them with few options to recover their money. The failure of one bank might shift losses and withdrawal demands to others and spread into a panic. During the Panics of 1893 and 1907, many banks filed bankruptcy due to bank runs. Both of the panics renewed discussion on deposit insurance. In 1893, William Jennings Bryan presented a bill to Congress proposing a national deposit insurance fund. No action was taken, as the legislature paid more attention to the agricultural depression at the time.

After 1907, eight states established deposit insurance funds. Due to the lax regulation of banks and the widespread inability of banks to branch, small, local unit banks—often with poor financial health—grew in numbers, especially in the western and southern states. In 1921, there were about 31,000 banks in the US. The Federal Reserve Act initially included a provision for nationwide deposit insurance, but it was removed from the bill by the House of Representatives. From 1893 to the FDIC&#x27;s creation in 1933, 150 bills were submitted in Congress proposing deposit insurance.

The problem of bank instability was already apparent before the onset of the Great Depression. From 1921 to 1929, approximately 5,700 bank failures occurred, concentrated in rural areas. Nearly 10,000 failures occurred from 1929 to 1933, or more than one-third of all U.S. banks. A panic in February 1933 spread so rapidly that most state governments ordered the closure of all banks.

===Establishment of the FDIC: 1933===
President Franklin D. Roosevelt himself was dubious about insuring bank deposits, saying, &quot;We do not wish to make the United States Government liable for the mistakes and errors of individual banks, and put a premium on unsound banking in the future.&quot; Bankers likewise opposed insurance, arguing that it would create a moral hazard for bankers and depositors, and even denounced it as socialist. Yet public support was overwhelmingly in favor. On June 16, 1933, Roosevelt signed the 1933 Banking Act into law, creating the FDIC. The initial plan set by Congress in 1934 was to insure deposits up to $2,500 ($ today) and adoption of a more generous, long-term plan after six months. However, the latter plan was abandoned for an increase of the insurance limit to $5,000 ().

The 1933 Banking Act:
* Established the FDIC as a temporary government corporation.
* Gave the FDIC authority to provide deposit insurance to banks
* Gave the FDIC the authority to regulate and supervise state non-member banks
* Funded the FDIC with loans in the form of stock contributions from the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Banks
* Extended federal oversight to all commercial banks for the first time
* Separated commercial and investment banking (Glass–Steagall Act)
* Prohibited banks from paying interest on checking accounts
* Allowed national banks to branch statewide, if allowed by state law.

The Banking Act of 1935 made the FDIC a permanent agency of the government and provided permanent deposit insurance maintained at the $5,000 level.

===Historical insurance limits===
The per-depositor insurance limit has increased over time to accommodate inflation.

* 1934: $2,500
* 1935: $5,000
* 1950: $10,000
* 1966: $15,000
* 1969: $20,000
* 1974: $40,000
* 1980: $100,000
* 2008: $250,000

Congress approved a temporary increase in the deposit insurance limit from $100,000 to $250,000, which was effective from October 3, 2008, through December 31, 2010. On May 20, 2009, the temporary increase was extended through December 31, 2013. The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L.111-203), which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, made the $250,000 insurance limit permanent, and extended the guarantee retroactively to January 1, 2008, meaning it covered uninsured deposits banks like IndyMac. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (P.L.109-171) allows for the boards of the FDIC and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to consider inflation and other factors every five years beginning in 2010 and, if warranted, to adjust the amounts under a specified formula.

FDIC-insured institutions are permitted to display a sign stating the terms of its insurance—that is, the per-depositor limit and the guarantee of the United States government. The FDIC describes this sign as a symbol of confidence for depositors. As part of a 1987 legislative enactment, Congress passed a measure stating &quot;it is the sense of the Congress that it should reaffirm that deposits up to the statutorily prescribed amount in federally insured depository institutions are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States&quot;, and similar language is used in , a 1989 amendment to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.

===S&amp;L and bank crisis of the 1980s===
Federal deposit insurance received its first large-scale test since the Great Depression in the late 1980s and early 1990s during the savings and loan crisis (which also affected commercial banks and savings banks).

The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) had been created to insure deposits held by savings and loan institutions (&quot;S&amp;Ls&quot;, or &quot;thrifts&quot;). Because of a confluence of events, much of the S&amp;L industry was insolvent, and many large banks were in trouble as well. FSLIC&#x27;s reserves were insufficient to pay off the depositors of all of the failing thrifts, and fell into insolvency. FSLIC was abolished in August 1989 and replaced by the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). On December 31, 1995, the RTC was merged into the FDIC, and the FDIC became responsible for resolving failed thrifts. Supervision of thrifts became the responsibility of a new agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision (credit unions remained insured by the National Credit Union Administration). The primary legislative responses to the crisis were the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). Federally chartered thrifts are now regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and state-chartered thrifts by the FDIC.

The final combined total for all direct and indirect losses of FSLIC and RTC resolutions was an estimated $152.9 billion. Of this total amount, U.S. taxpayer losses amounted to approximately $123.8 billion (81% of the total costs).

When the FDIC&#x27;s Bank Insurance Fund was exhausted in 1990, it received authority from Congress to borrow through the Federal Financing Bank (FFB). Using this facility, the FDIC borrowed $15 billion to strengthen the fund, and repaid the debt by 1993.

===2007–2008 financial crisis===
The FDIC faced its greatest challenge from the 2007–2008 financial crisis. From 2008 to 2017 a total of 528 member institutions failed, with the annual number peaking at 157 in 2010. These included the largest failure to date, Washington Mutual, and the sixth largest, IndyMac. Wachovia, another large bank, avoided failure through last-minute merger arrangements at the FDIC&#x27;s insistence. At the height of the crisis in late 2008, Treasury secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve officials Ben Bernanke and Timothy Geithner proposed that the FDIC should guarantee debts across the US financial sector, including investment banks. Chairman Sheila Bair resisted, and after negotiations the FDIC instead announced a Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program that guaranteed deposits and unsecured debt instruments used for day-to-day payments. To promote depositor confidence, Congress temporarily raised the insurance limit to $250,000.

Although most failures were resolved through merger or acquisition, the FDIC&#x27;s insurance fund was exhausted by late 2009. The largest FDIC payout for that year was for the failure of Florida-based BankUnited FSB, which cost the fund $5.6 billion out of $17 billion at the start of the year. Rather than borrowing from the FFB or the Treasury, the FDIC demanded three years of advance premiums from its member institutions and operated the fund with a negative net balance.

The Dodd–Frank Act of 2010 created new authorities for the FDIC to address risks associated with systemically important financial institutions. These institutions were required to submit resolution plans, or &quot;living wills,&quot; which the FDIC would execute in the event of their failure. A new division, the Office of Complex Financial Institutions, was created to administer these responsibilities. The act also made the insurance limit increase permanent and required the FDIC to submit a restoration plan whenever the insurance fund balance falls below 1.35% of insured deposits. The insurance fund returned to a positive balance at the start of 2011 and reached its required balance in 2018. That year also saw no bank failures for the first time since the crisis.

<doc id="164395" wikidata="Q726823" url="?curid=164395" title="The Stunt Man">
<text>The Stunt Man is a 1980 American satirical psychological black comedy film starring Peter O&#x27;Toole, Steve Railsback and Barbara Hershey, and directed by Richard Rush. The film was adapted by Lawrence B. Marcus and Rush from the 1970 novel by Paul Brodeur. It tells the story of a young fugitive who hides as a stunt double on the set of a World War I movie whose charismatic director will do seemingly anything for the sake of his art. The line between illusion and reality is blurred as scenes from the inner movie cut seamlessly to &quot;real life&quot; and vice versa. There are examples of &quot;movie magic&quot;, where a scene of wartime carnage is revealed as just stunt men and props, and where a shot of a crying woman becomes, with scenery, props and soundtrack, a portrait of a grieving widow at a Nazi rally. The protagonist begins to doubt everything he sees and hears, and at the end is faced with real danger when a stunt seems to go wrong.

It was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Actor in a Leading Role (Peter O&#x27;Toole), Best Director (Richard Rush), and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. However, due to its limited release, it never earned much attention from audiences at large. As O&#x27;Toole remarked in a DVD audio commentary, &quot;The film wasn&#x27;t released. It escaped.&quot; The film has since developed a cult following.

==Plot==

Cameron, a Vietnam veteran who is wanted for attempted murder, is caught by police but escapes. Crossing a bridge, he dodges a car that seems to be trying to run him down; when he turns around, the car has disappeared. A helicopter flies close to the bridge and a man inside looks at Cameron. Later, Cameron is attracted to a movie shoot — a World War I battle scene. Afterwards, he notices an older woman who walks through the set greeting the actors, then falls in the water. Cameron dives in to rescue her and is horrified when she pulls off her face — a mask. She is the movie&#x27;s leading actress, Nina Franklin, testing make-up for scenes set late in her character&#x27;s life.

The director, Eli Cross, the man in the helicopter, descends from the sky on his camera crane. He offers Cameron a job, explaining that their last stunt man just ran a car off a bridge. They haven&#x27;t found the body, and Eli can&#x27;t afford the production delays if police get involved. The police chief is aware of the accident but Eli convinces him that Cameron is the stuntman. Cameron accepts the job. Eli shows the police film footage that seems to show that Cameron was never on the bridge.

Denise, the film&#x27;s hair stylist, dyes Cameron&#x27;s hair in order to make him resemble the leading man, Raymond Bailey, and harder to recognize. Cameron is convinced Eli is selling him out to the police but Eli reassures him that he is not. Cameron learns from Chuck, the stunt coordinator, and films a scene where he is chased across the roof of a large building and falls through a skylight into a bordello. At the same time, Cameron gets involved with Nina, who once had a romance with Eli, who becomes jealous of Cameron.

The last shoot at the current location involves Cameron&#x27;s most difficult stunt, driving off a bridge and escaping under water — the same scene Burt was shooting when he died. Cameron believes Eli is trying to kill him, and will use the stunt to make it look like an accident.

The morning before the shoot Cameron tells Nina he planned to open an ice cream shop when he got home from Vietnam with a friend, but his friend did not want Cameron around because Cameron&#x27;s girlfriend had left Cameron for the friend. Enraged, Cameron destroyed the ice cream shop. When a cop showed up, Cameron knocked him out, leaving his head freezing in a bucket of ice cream, resulting in an attempted murder charge. Nina and Cameron plan to escape together: Nina will hide in the trunk of the car, which Cameron will drive away in the morning instead of driving off the bridge.

Chuck has planted an explosive in one of the tires to make the car&#x27;s tumble look more realistic. Cameron starts the scene too early. The car goes into the water when Chuck triggers the exploding tire, and Cameron scrambles to reach Nina in the trunk, until he looks out the window and sees Nina with Eli on the bridge. The air bottle Cameron is supposed to use to breathe seems to have been sabotaged, but he is able to get out of the car anyway. Cameron emerges and notices there were divers in the water with him all the time. Nina tells him that she was found in the trunk hours before the shoot, and Eli told her Cameron had decided to do the stunt. Eli explains that he would not let Cameron run off thinking he was trying to kill him. The best way to convince Cameron of Eli&#x27;s good will, Eli felt, was to make sure Cameron got through the stunt in one piece. Cameron, though furious, is amused and relieved to survive. Cameron and Eli bicker over Cameron&#x27;s pay and plan to catch a plane to the production&#x27;s next location.

==Cast==
==Production==
Shortly after Paul Brodeur published the original novel, his Harvard University classmate Frederick Wiseman initially agreed to direct an adaptation but quickly departed the project. Columbia Pictures held on to the film rights to the novel, and considered either Arthur Penn or François Truffaut to direct it. They both expressed interest but declined in favor of other projects, although they did incorporate elements of the film into their projects &quot;Day for Night&quot; (1973) and &quot;Night Moves&quot; (1975).

Columbia Pictures finally offered the film to Richard Rush on the strength of the success of his previous film, &quot;Getting Straight&quot;. Rush initially rejected, then ultimately accepted directing &quot;The Stunt Man.&quot; In July 1971, Columbia announced that Rush would direct the film with William Castle as executive producer. Rush then penned a 150-page treatment different from the book; in the novel, the characters were all crazy, and in the screenplay, they were instead &quot;sane in a world gone mad.&quot; Columbia executives then rejected the script, saying it was difficult to find a genre to place it in. Said Rush: &quot;They couldn&#x27;t figure out if it was a comedy, a drama, if it was a social satire, if it was an action adventure...and, of course, the answer was, &#x27;Yes, it&#x27;s all those things.&#x27; But that isn&#x27;t a satisfactory answer to a studio executive.&quot; Rush then bought the film rights from Columbia Rush and Lawrence B. Marcus completed a screenplay nine months later, but could not convince any other studios to fund the film. shopped the film to other studios, to no avail.

Rush spent the next several years unsuccessfully pitching both &quot;The Stunt Man&quot; and &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1975), which he had optioned from Michael Douglas, to different studios. Rush was finally offered several deals to finance &quot;The Stunt Man&quot; in 1976, but they collapsed after Warner Bros. Pictures began developing a similarly titled film called &quot;The Stuntman&quot;. Rush challenged Warner Bros. to Motion Picture Association of America arbitration which also delayed &quot;The Stuntman&quot; for several years and forced Warner Bros. to change its title to &quot;Hooper&quot; (1978). Trans World Entertainment agreed to finance the film and principal photography was planned to begin in San Diego on October 17, 1977. The production was cancelled at the last minute after Rush and Ely Landau could not agree on casting. Funding for the picture finally came in 1978 from Melvin Simon, who had made a fortune in real estate.

Production began in the summer of 1978. Many scenes were filmed in and around the historic Hotel del Coronado in Coronado, California. The film was delayed after Rush suffered a heart attack in the autumn of 1979. Although the film was completed in August 1980, it still could not find a distributor. Simon booked the film at a single cinema in Seattle, followed by two more in Dallas and Westwood, Los Angeles. 20th Century Fox finally agreed to distribute the film on November 3, 1980, after it won the Grand Prize at the Montreal World Film Festival.

Peter O&#x27;Toole mentions in his DVD commentary that he based his character on David Lean who directed him in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;.

==Reception==
Reviewing it upon its release, Roger Ebert wrote &quot;there was a great deal in it that I admired... [but] there were times when I felt cheated&quot;. He gave the film two stars but noted that others had &quot;highly recommended&quot; it. In an October 17, 1980, review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin noted &quot;the film&#x27;s cleverness is aggressive and cool,&quot; but concluded that although &quot;the gamesmanship of &quot;The Stunt Man&quot; is fast and furious... gamesmanship is almost all it manages to be&quot;. Jay Scott called it &quot;[t]he best movie about making a movie ever made, but the achievement merely begins there. ... Imagine a picture an eight-year-old and Wittgenstein could enjoy with equal fervor.&quot; Pauline Kael considered it &quot;a virtuoso piece of kinetic moviemaking&quot; and rated it one of year&#x27;s best films; she called O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s comic performance &quot;peerless&quot;.

, the comedy drama film held a 91% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 43 reviews. The critics consensus states, &quot;The Stunt Man is a preposterously entertaining thriller with a clever narrative and Oscar-worthy (nomination, at least!) Peter O&#x27;Toole performance.&quot;

<doc id="164396" wikidata="Q2543870" url="?curid=164396" title="Tribute (play)">
<text>Tribute is a play by Bernard Slade.

The play focuses on Scottie Templeton, a popular actor who has spent his life shirking responsibility. When he discovers he is terminally ill with leukemia, he attempts to reconnect with his long-estranged son.
==Production==
The play had pre-Broadway runs in Boston at the Colonial Theatre, and Toronto at the Royal Alexandra Theatre. 

The play opened on Broadway on June 1, 1978 after 4 previews at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre, and closed on December 2, 1978 after 212 performances. The play was directed by Arthur Storch and starred Jack Lemmon, who had committed to do the play through November 1978. The cast included Robert Picardo, Catherine Hicks, and Rosemary Prinz. Lemmon was nominated for the Tony and Drama Desk Award for his performance.

Before the play opened on Broadway, producer Morton Gottlieb and author Bernard Slade, had sold the movie rights to Paramount for over $1 million. On the opening night party at Tavern on the Green, Gottlieb gave out checks to investors, for payment in full, without help from the movie sale. 

In 1980, Slade adapted his play for a feature film directed by Bob Clark, with Lemmon recreating his performance in the lead role. The supporting cast included Robby Benson as Jud Templeton, Lee Remick as Maggie Stratton, Colleen Dewhurst as Gladys Petrelli, John Marley, and Kim Cattrall.

<doc id="164397" wikidata="Q1410030" url="?curid=164397" title="Glass–Steagall legislation">
<text>The Glass–Steagall legislation describes four provisions of the United States Banking Act of 1933 separating commercial and investment banking. The article 1933 Banking Act describes the entire law, including the legislative history of the provisions covered.

As with the Glass–Steagall Act of 1932, the common name comes from the names of the Congressional sponsors, Senator Carter Glass and Representative Henry B. Steagall.

The separation of commercial and investment banking prevented securities firms and investment banks from taking deposits and commercial Federal Reserve member banks from:
* dealing in non-governmental securities for customers;
* investing in non-investment grade securities for themselves;
* underwriting or distributing non-governmental securities;
* affiliating (or sharing employees) with companies involved in such activities.

Starting in the early 1960s, federal banking regulators&#x27; interpretations of the Act permitted commercial banks, and especially commercial bank affiliates, to engage in an expanding list and volume of securities activities. Congressional efforts to &quot;repeal the Glass–Steagall Act&quot;, referring to those four provisions (and then usually to only the two provisions that restricted affiliations between commercial banks and securities firms), culminated in the 1999 Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA), which repealed the two provisions restricting affiliations between banks and securities firms.

By that time, many commentators argued Glass–Steagall was already &quot;dead&quot;. Most notably, Citibank&#x27;s 1998 affiliation with Salomon Smith Barney, one of the largest U.S. securities firms, was permitted under the Federal Reserve Board&#x27;s then existing interpretation of the Glass–Steagall Act. In November 1999, President Bill Clinton publicly declared &quot;the Glass–Steagall law is no longer appropriate&quot;.

Some commentators have stated that the GLBA&#x27;s repeal of the affiliation restrictions of the Glass–Steagall Act was an important cause of the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics laureate Joseph Stiglitz argued that the effect of the repeal was &quot;indirect&quot;: &quot;[w]hen repeal of Glass-Steagall brought investment and commercial banks together, the investment-bank culture came out on top&quot;. Economists at the Federal Reserve, such as Chairman Ben Bernanke, have argued that the activities linked to the financial crisis were not prohibited (or, in most cases, even regulated) by the Glass–Steagall Act.

==Sponsors==

The sponsors of both the Banking Act of 1933 and the Glass–Steagall Act of 1932 were southern Democrats: Senator Carter Glass of Virginia (who by 1932 had served in the House and the Senate, and as the Secretary of the Treasury); and Representative Henry B. Steagall of Alabama, who had served in the House for the preceding 17 years.

==Legislative history==
Between 1930 and 1932, Senator Carter Glass (D-VA) introduced several versions of a bill (known in each version as the Glass bill) to regulate or prohibit the combination of commercial and investment banking and to establish other reforms (except deposit insurance) similar to the final provisions of the 1933 Banking Act. On June 16, 1933, President Roosevelt signed the bill into law. Glass originally introduced his banking reform bill in January 1932. It received extensive critiques and comments from bankers, economists, and the Federal Reserve Board. It passed the House on February 16, 1932, the Senate on February 19, 1932, and signed into law by President Hoover eight days later. The Senate passed a version of the Glass bill that would have required commercial banks to eliminate their securities affiliates.

The final Glass–Steagall provisions contained in the 1933 Banking Act reduced from five years to one year the period in which commercial banks were required to eliminate such affiliations. Although the deposit insurance provisions of the 1933 Banking Act were very controversial, and drew veto threats from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, President Roosevelt supported the Glass–Steagall provisions separating commercial and investment banking, and Representative Steagall included those provisions in his House bill that differed from Senator Glass&#x27;s Senate bill primarily in its deposit insurance provisions. Steagall insisted on protecting small banks while Glass felt that small banks were the weakness to U.S. banking.

Many accounts of the Act identify the Pecora Investigation as important in leading to the Act, particularly its Glass–Steagall provisions, becoming law. While supporters of the Glass–Steagall separation of commercial and investment banking cite the Pecora Investigation as supporting that separation, Glass–Steagall critics have argued that the evidence from the Pecora Investigation did not support the separation of commercial and investment banking.

This source states that Senator Glass proposed many versions of his bill to Congress known as the Glass Bills in the two years prior to the Glass–Steagall Act being passed. It also includes how the deposit insurance provisions of the bill were very controversial at the time, which almost led to the rejection of the bill once again.

The previous Glass Bills before the final revision all had similar goals and brought up the same objectives, which were to separate commercial from investment banking, bring more banking activities under Federal Reserve supervision, and to allow branch banking. In May 1933, Steagall&#x27;s addition of allowing state-chartered banks to receive federal deposit insurance and shortening the time in which banks needed to eliminate securities affiliates to one year was known as the driving force of what helped the Glass–Steagall act to be signed into law.

==Separating commercial and investment banking==

The Glass–Steagall separation of commercial and investment banking was in four sections of the 1933 Banking Act (sections 16, 20, 21, and 32). The Banking Act of 1935 clarified the 1933 legislation and resolved inconsistencies in it. Together, they prevented commercial Federal Reserve member banks from:
* dealing in non-governmental securities for customers
* investing in non-investment grade securities for themselves
* underwriting or distributing non-governmental securities
* affiliating (or sharing employees) with companies involved in such activities

Conversely, Glass–Steagall prevented securities firms and investment banks from taking deposits.

The law gave banks one year after the law was passed on June 16, 1933, to decide whether they would be a commercial bank or an investment bank. Only 10 percent of a commercial bank&#x27;s income could stem from securities. One exception to this rule was that commercial banks could underwrite government-issued bonds.

There were several &quot;loopholes&quot; that regulators and financial firms were able to exploit during the lifetime of Glass–Steagall restrictions. Aside from the Section 21 prohibition on securities firms taking deposits, neither savings and loans nor state-chartered banks that did not belong to the Federal Reserve System were restricted by Glass–Steagall. Glass–Steagall also did not prevent securities firms from owning such institutions. S&amp;Ls and securities firms took advantage of these loopholes starting in the 1960s to create products and affiliated companies that chipped away at commercial banks&#x27; deposit and lending businesses.

While permitting affiliations between securities firms and companies other than Federal Reserve member banks, Glass–Steagall distinguished between what a Federal Reserve member bank could do directly and what an affiliate could do. Whereas a Federal Reserve member bank could not buy, sell, underwrite, or deal in any security except as specifically permitted by Section 16, such a bank could affiliate with a company so long as that company was not &quot;engaged principally&quot; in such activities. Starting in 1987, the Federal Reserve Board interpreted this to mean a member bank could affiliate with a securities firm so long as that firm was not &quot;engaged principally&quot; in securities activities prohibited for a bank by Section 16. By the time the GLBA repealed the Glass–Steagall affiliation restrictions, the Federal Reserve Board had interpreted this &quot;loophole&quot; in those restrictions to mean a banking company (Citigroup, as owner of Citibank) could acquire one of the world&#x27;s largest securities firms (Salomon Smith Barney).

By defining commercial banks as banks that take in deposits and make loans and investment banks as banks that underwrite and deal with securities the Glass–Steagall act explained the separation of banks by stating that commercial banks could not deal with securities and investment banks could not own commercial banks or have close connections with them. With the exception of commercial banks being allowed to underwrite government-issued bonds, commercial banks could only have 10 percent of their income come from securities.

==Decline and repeal==
It was not until 1933 that the separation of commercial banking and investment banking was considered controversial. There was a belief that the separation would lead to a healthier financial system. As time passed, however, the separation became so controversial that in 1935, Senator Glass himself attempted to &quot;repeal&quot; the prohibition on direct bank underwriting by permitting a limited amount of bank underwriting of corporate debt.

In the 1960s, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued aggressive interpretations of Glass–Steagall to permit national banks to engage in certain securities activities. Although most of these interpretations were overturned by court decisions, by the late 1970s, bank regulators began issuing Glass–Steagall interpretations that were upheld by courts and that permitted banks and their affiliates to engage in an increasing variety of securities activities. Starting in the 1960s, banks and non-banks developed financial products that blurred the distinction between banking and securities products, as they increasingly competed with each other.

Separately, starting in the 1980s, Congress debated bills to repeal Glass–Steagall&#x27;s affiliation provisions (Sections 20 and 32). Some believe that major U.S. financial sector firms established a favorable view of deregulation in American political circles, and in using its political influence in Congress to overturn key provisions of Glass-Steagall and to dismantle other major provisions of statutes and regulations that govern financial firms and the risks they may take.
In 1999 Congress passed the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, to repeal them. Eight days later, President Bill Clinton signed it into law.

==Aftermath of repeal==
After the financial crisis of 2007–2008, some commentators argued that the repeal of Sections 20 and 32 had played an important role in leading to the housing bubble and financial crisis. Economics Nobel Memorial laureate Joseph Stiglitz, for instance, argued that &quot;[w]hen repeal of Glass-Steagall brought investment and commercial banks together, the investment-bank culture came out on top&quot;, and banks which had previously been managed conservatively turned to riskier investments to increase their returns. Another laureate, Paul Krugman, contended that the repealing of the act &quot;was indeed a mistake&quot;; however, it was not the cause of the financial crisis.

Other commentators believed that these banking changes had no effect, and the financial crisis would have happened the same way if the regulations had still been in force. Lawrence J. White, for instance, noted that &quot;it was not [commercial banks&#x27;] investment banking activities, such as underwriting and dealing in securities, that did them in&quot;.

At the time of the repeal, most commentators believed it would be harmless. Because the Federal Reserve&#x27;s interpretations of the act had already weakened restrictions previously in place, commentators did not find much significance in the repeal, especially of sections 20 and 32. Instead, the five year anniversary of its repeal was marked by numerous sources explaining that the GLBA had not significantly changed the market structure of the banking and securities industries. More significant changes had occurred during the 1990s when commercial banking firms had gained a significant role in securities markets through &quot;Section 20 affiliates&quot;.

The perception is that the Glass-Steagall Act created a sense of accountability among investors within the financial management industry, encouraging them to (in effect) shy away from ultra-risky transactions that could lead to financial meltdown. It provided litigators validation involving cases against such sub-prime investment instruments on behalf of their clients who were impacted by such injustices. 

Without formal and defensible protection as detailed in the Glass-Steagall Act, investment companies felt at liberty to move toward unscrupulous investment tactics that had occurred prior to 2009 involving sub-prime mortgages. Thus a cultural shift was certainly in order after its repeal regardless of the loopholes that existed prior. Although the magnitude may be questionable, the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act is considered a factor in the global financial crisis revealed in 2008.

==Post-financial crisis reform debate==

Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, legislators unsuccessfully tried to reinstate Glass–Steagall Sections 20 and 32 as part of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Both in the United States and elsewhere around the world, banking reforms have been proposed that refer to Glass–Steagall principles. These proposals include issues of &quot;ringfencing&quot; commercial banking operations and narrow banking proposals that would sharply reduce the permitted activities of commercial banks - institutions that provide capital liquidity to investment management firms to shore up over-inflated market valuation of securities (whether debt or equity). Reconciliation of over-committed funds is possible by filing claims to the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Company) - hence further increasing the federal budget deficit.
