<text>The Airbus A330 is a wide-body aircraft developed and produced by Airbus.

Airbus began developing larger A300 derivatives in the mid–1970s, giving rise to the A330 twinjet as well as the Airbus A340 quadjet, and launched both designs along with their first orders in June 1987. The A330-300, the first variant, took its maiden flight in November 1992 and entered service with Air Inter in January 1994. The A330-200, a shortened longer-range variant, followed in 1998 with Canada 3000 as the launch operator.
The A330 shares many underpinnings with the airframe of the early A340 variants, most notably the same wing components, and by extension the same structure. However, the A330 has two main landing gear legs instead of three, lower weights, and slightly different fuselage lengths. Both airliners have fly-by-wire controls as well as a similar glass cockpit to increase the commonality. The A330 was Airbus&#x27;s first airliner to offer a choice of three engines: the General Electric CF6, Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000, or the Rolls-Royce Trent 700. The A330-300 has a range of with 277 passengers, while the shorter A330-200 can cover with 247 passengers. Other variants include the A330-200F dedicated freighter, the A330 MRTT military tanker, and the ACJ330 corporate jet. The A330 MRTT was proposed as the EADS/Northrop Grumman KC-45 for the US Air Force&#x27;s KC-X competition, but lost to the Boeing KC-46 in appeal after an initial win.
In July 2014, Airbus announced the re-engined A330neo (&quot;new engine option&quot;) comprising A330-800 and -900, which entered service with TAP Air Portugal in December 2018. With the exclusive, more efficient Trent 7000 turbofan and improvements including sharklets, it offers up to 14% better fuel economy per seat. The first-generation A330s (-200, -200F, and -300) are now called A330ceo (&quot;current engine option&quot;).
Delta Air Lines is the largest operator with 74 airplanes in its fleet . A total of 1,863 orders have been placed for the A330 family, of which 1,623 have been delivered and 1,461 are in service with 149 operators. The global A330 fleet had accumulated more than 65 million flight hours since its entry into service. The A330 is the second most delivered wide-body airliner after the Boeing 777. It competes with the Boeing 767 and the 787. It is complemented by the larger Airbus A350, which succeeded the four-engined A340. , the Airbus A330 has been involved in 46 aviation accidents and incidents, including 14 hull-losses (10 due to flight related accidents and 4 due to criminal related accidents), for a total of 339 fatalities.

==Development==

===Background===

Airbus&#x27;s first airliner, the A300, was envisioned as part of a diverse family of commercial aircraft. Pursuing this goal, studies began in the early 1970s into derivatives of the A300. Before introducing the A300, Airbus identified nine possible variations designated B1 through B9. A tenth variant, the A300B10, was conceived in 1973 and developed into the longer-range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on single-aisle (SA) studies, conceiving a family of airliners later known as the Airbus A320 family, the first commercial aircraft with digital fly-by-wire controls. During these studies Airbus turned its focus back to the wide-body aircraft market, simultaneously working on both projects.

In the mid 1970s, Airbus began development of the A300B9, a larger derivative of the A300, which would eventually become the A330. The B9 was essentially a lengthened A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful turbofan engines available. It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes. Offering the same range and payload as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 but with 25 per cent better fuel efficiency, the B9 was seen as a viable replacement for the DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar trijets. It was also considered as a medium-ranged successor to the A300.

At the same time, a 200-seat four-engine version, the B11 (which would eventually become the A340) was also under development. The B11 was originally planned to take the place of narrow-body Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s then in commercial use, but would later evolve to target the long-range, wide-body trijet replacement market. To differentiate from the SA series, the B9 and B11 were re-designated as the TA9 and TA11, with TA standing for &quot;twin aisle&quot;. Development costs were reduced by the two aircraft using the same fuselage and wing, with projected savings of US$500 million. Another factor was the split preference of those within Airbus and, more importantly, those of prospective customers; twinjets were favoured in North America, quad-jets desired in Asia, and operators had mixed views in Europe. Airbus ultimately found that most potential customers favoured four engines for their exemption from existing twinjet range restrictions and their ability to be ferried with one inactive engine. As a result, development plans prioritised the four-engined TA11 ahead of the TA9.

===Design effort===
The first specifications for the TA9 and TA11, aircraft that could accommodate 410 passengers in a one-class layout, emerged in 1982. They showed a large underfloor cargo area that could hold five cargo pallets or sixteen LD3 cargo containers in the forward, and four pallets or fourteen LD3s in the aft hold—double the capacity of the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar or DC-10, and longer than the Airbus A300. By June 1985, the TA9 and TA11 had received more improvements, including the adoption of the A320 flight deck, digital fly-by-wire (FBW) control system, and side-stick control. Airbus had developed a common cockpit for their aircraft models to allow quick transition by pilots. The flight crews could transition from one type to another after only one week&#x27;s training, which reduces operator costs. The two TAs would use the vertical stabiliser, rudder, and circular fuselage sections of the A300-600, extended by two barrel sections.

Airbus briefly considered the variable camber wing, a concept that requires changing the wing profile for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by British Aerospace (BAe), now part of BAE Systems, at Hatfield and Bristol. Airbus estimated this would yield a two per cent improvement in aerodynamic efficiency, but the feature was rejected because of cost and difficulty of development. A true laminar flow wing (a low-drag shape that improves fuel efficiency) was also considered but rejected.

With necessary funding available, the Airbus Supervisory Board approved the development of the A330 and A340 with potential customers on 27 January 1986. Its chairman Franz Josef Strauss stated afterwards that Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9, now officially designated as the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments. The designations were originally reversed and were switched so the quad-jet airliner would have a &quot;4&quot; in its name. Airbus hoped for five airlines to sign for both the A330 and A340, and on 12 May sent sale proposals to the most likely candidates, including Lufthansa and Swissair.

====Engines====
From the beginning of the TA9&#x27;s development, a choice of engines from the three major engine manufacturers, Rolls-Royce, Pratt &amp; Whitney, and GE Aviation, was planned. GE Aviation first offered the CF6-80C2. However, later studies indicated that more thrust was needed to increase the initial power capability from . GE enlarged the CF6-80C2 fan from and reduced the number of fan blades from 38 to 34 to create the CF6-80E1 with a thrust of .

Rolls-Royce initially wanted to use the Trent 600 to power Airbus&#x27;s newest twinjet and the upcoming McDonnell Douglas MD-11. However, the company later agreed to develop an engine solely for the A330, the Trent 700, with a larger diameter and of thrust. The A330 became the first Airbus aircraft for which Rolls-Royce supplied engines.

Similarly, Pratt &amp; Whitney signed an agreement that covered the development of the A330-exclusive PW4168. The company increased the fan size from to , enabling the engine to deliver of thrust. Like the CF6-80E1, 34 blades were used instead of the 38 found on the smaller PW4000 engines.

===Production and testing===
In preparation for the production of the A330 and the A340, Airbus&#x27;s partners invested heavily in new facilities. In south-western England, BAe made a £7 million investment in a three-storey technical centre with of floor area at Filton. In north Wales, BAe also spent £5 million on a new production line at its Broughton wing production plant. In Germany, Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) invested DM400 million ($225 million) on manufacturing facilities in the Weser estuary, including at Bremen, Einswarden, Varel, and Hamburg. France saw the biggest investments, with Aérospatiale constructing a new Fr.2.5 billion ($411 million) final-assembly plant adjacent to Toulouse-Blagnac Airport in Colomiers; by November 1988, the pillars for the new &quot;Clément Ader&quot; assembly hall had been erected. The assembly process featured increased automation, such as robots drilling holes and installing fasteners during the wing-to-fuselage mating process.

On 12 March 1987, Airbus received the first orders for the twinjet. Domestic French airline Air Inter placed five firm orders and fifteen options, while Thai Airways International requested eight aircraft, split evenly between firm orders and options. Airbus announced the next day that it would formally launch the A330 and A340 programmes by April 1987, with deliveries of the A340 to begin in May 1992 and A330 deliveries to start in 1993. Northwest Airlines signed a letter of intent for twenty A340s and ten A330s on 31 March. In 2001, the program cost with the A340 was .

BAe eventually received £450 million of funding from the UK government, well short of the £750 million it had originally requested for the design and construction of the wings. The German and French governments also provided funding. Airbus issued subcontracts to companies in Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Greece, Italy, India, Japan, South Korea, Portugal, the United States, and the former Yugoslavia. With funding in place, Airbus launched the A330 and A340 programmes on 5 June 1987, just before the Paris Air Show. At that time, the order book stood at 130 aircraft from ten customers, including lessor International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC). Of the order total, forty-one were for A330s. In 1989, Asian carrier Cathay Pacific joined the list of purchasers, ordering nine A330s and later increasing this number to eleven.

The wing-to-fuselage mating of the first A330, the tenth airframe of the A330 and A340 line, began in mid February 1992. This aircraft, coated with anti-corrosion paint, was rolled out on 31 March without its General Electric CF6-80E1 engines, which were installed by August. During a static test, the wing failed just below requirement; BAe engineers later resolved the problem. At the 1992 Farnborough Airshow, Northwest deferred delivery of sixteen A330s to 1994, following the cancellation of its A340 orders.

The first completed A330 was rolled out on 14 October 1992, with the maiden flight following on 2 November. Weighing , including of test equipment, the A330 became the largest twinjet to have flown until the first flight of the Boeing 777. The flight lasted five hours and fifteen minutes during which speed, height, and other flight configurations were tested. Airbus intended the test flight programme to comprise six aircraft flying a total of 1,800 hours. On 21 October 1993, the A330 received the European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certifications simultaneously after 1,114 cumulative airborne test hours and 426 test flights. At the same time, weight tests came in favourable, showing the plane was underweight.

On 30 June 1994, a fatal crash occurred during certification of the Pratt &amp; Whitney engine when an A330 crashed near Toulouse. Both pilots and the five passengers died. The flight was designed to test autopilot response during a one-engine-off worst-case scenario with the centre of gravity near its aft limit. Shortly after takeoff, the pilots had difficulty setting the autopilot, and the aircraft lost speed and crashed. An investigation by an internal branch of &quot;Direction Générale d&#x27;Aviation&quot; concluded that the accident resulted from slow response and incorrect actions by the crew during the recovery. This led to a revision of A330 operating procedures.

===Entry into service===

Air Inter became the first operator of the A330, having put the aircraft into service on 17 January 1994 between Orly Airport, Paris, and Marseille. Deliveries to Malaysia Airlines (MAS) and Thai Airways International were postponed to address delamination of the composite materials in the PW4168 engine&#x27;s thrust reverser assembly. Thai Airways received its first A330 during the second half of the year, operating it on routes from Bangkok to Taipei and Seoul. Cathay Pacific received its Trent 700 A330s following the certification of that engine on 22 December 1994. MAS received its A330 on 1 February 1995 and then rescheduled its other ten orders. Its initial range was around 4,000 nautical miles but subsequent refinements increased the range of newer models to 5,000 nautical miles and by 2015, the range was 6,100 nautical miles.

===Shrinking the -300: the -200 ===

In response to a decline in A330-300 sales, increased market penetration by the Boeing 767-300ER, and airline requests for increased range and smaller aircraft, Airbus developed the A330-200. Known as the A329 and A330M10 during development, the A330-200 would offer nine per cent lower operating costs than the Boeing 767-300ER. The plane was aimed at the sector, where Airbus predicted demand for 800 aircraft between 1995 and 2015. The project, with US$450 million in expected development costs, was approved by the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board on 24 November 1995.
The A330-200 first flew on 13 August 1997. The sixteen-month certification process involved logging 630 hours of test flights. The A330-200&#x27;s first customer was ILFC; these aircraft were leased by Canada 3000, who became the type&#x27;s first operator.

As Airbus worked on its A330-200, hydraulic pump problems were reported by both A330 and A340 operators. This issue was the suspected cause of a fire that destroyed an Air France A340-200 in January 1994. On 4 January of that year, a Malaysia Airlines A330-300, while undergoing regular maintenance at Singapore Changi Airport, was consumed by a fire that started in the right-hand main undercarriage well. The incident caused US$30 million in damage, and the aircraft took six months to repair. Consequently, operators were advised to disable electrical pumps in January 1997.

===Proposed variants===
; A330-400/600
In 1996, Airbus evaluated a 12-frame stretch which would be able to carry 380 passengers over almost , the -400, and a &quot;super-stretch&quot; using the A340-600&#x27;s 22-frame stretch and powered by engines, the -600.

; A330-100/500
In February 2000, it was reported that a 250-seat A330-100 replacement for the A300/A310 could be launched by year end for 2003 deliveries. Shortened and keeping its fly-by-wire cockpit and systems, with a cleaner A300-600 wing with sealed control surfaces and winglets and at least two new engine types among the GE CF6-80, the PW4000 and the A340-500/600&#x27;s Trent 500 aimed for 5% better SFC than the A300-600. Its wing allowed a MTOW and (; ) range. In May, the 210-260 seat design had evolved towards keeping the A330 span wing and engines for a 195 t MTOW and range. Interested customers included Singapore Airlines, Lufthansa and Hapag-Lloyd.

Announced in July at Farnborough Air Show, the -500 first flight was targeted for early 2003 and introduction in early 2004. ILFC would take 10 if it was launched and CIT was interested too. The eight-frame shrink would carry 222 in three classes or 266 in two classes. Its initial range would be followed by derated versions for . The market was lukewarm as airlines like Lufthansa, Hapag-Lloyd and Singapore Airlines were unimpressed by the long-range A330-500, favouring a more refined short-range design. Lack of airline demand made lessors interest wane and as ILFC would order as 30 -500s, it would be with converting rights to larger A330-200/300.
; A330-200Lite
To compete with Boeing&#x27;s 7E7 (later 787), Airbus offered a minimum-change derivative called the A330-200&quot;Lite&quot; in 2004. As the name indicated, this proposed variant would have had a lower maximum takeoff weight of , coupled with de-rated engines, giving a range of . It was aimed at Singapore Airlines, who had looked to replace its Airbus A310-300s. The variant was also to be a replacement for Airbus A300-600Rs and early Boeing 767s. Airlines, however, were not satisfied with the compromised aircraft; the company instead proceeded with an entirely new aircraft, the A350 XWB.

===Further developments===
Initially, the GE90 was only one of three Boeing 777 options, and GE Aviation then-CEO Brian H. Rowe would have paid for the development of putting it on an A330; however, Airbus&#x27; strategy for long-haul was the four-engine A340, missing the market favouring twins.

Responding to lagging A300-600F and A310F sales, Airbus began marketing the Airbus A330-200F, a freighter derivative of the A330-200, around 2001. The freighter has a range of with a payload, or with . The plane utilises the same nosegear as the passenger version; however, it is attached lower in the fuselage and housed in a distinctive bulbous &quot;blister fairing&quot;. This raises the aircraft&#x27;s nose so that the cargo deck is level during loading, as the standard A330&#x27;s landing gear results the plane having a nose-down attitude while on the ground.

The A330-200F made its maiden flight on 5 November 2009. This marked the start of a four-month, 180-hour certification programme. JAA and FAA certifications were expected by March the following year although approval by the JAA was delayed until April. The first delivery was subsequently made to the Etihad Airways cargo division, Etihad Cargo, in July 2010.

On 25 September 2013, at the Aviation Expo China (Beijing Airshow), Airbus announced a new lower weight A330-300 variant, optimised for use on domestic and regional routes in high growth markets with large populations and concentrated traffic flows; China and India were recognised as prime targets. This variant could carry up to 400 passengers. The increased efficiency, however, comes more from the installation of more seats than any weight reduction. On relatively short, yet congested routes, the A330 competes against single-aisle jetliners. While the A330&#x27;s operating costs in these conditions are not far above those of the Boeing 737 or Airbus A321, the A320neo and 737 MAX promise more efficiency. Where the frequency of flights cannot be increased, using larger aircraft, such as the A330, is the only available option to increase capacity. The first customer for the A330 Regional was announced as Saudia at the 2015 Paris Air Show. In 2018, the unit cost of an A330-200 was US$238.5M, US$264.2M for an A330-300 and US$241.7M for an A330-200F.

===New Engine Option===

The A330neo (&quot;neo&quot; for &quot;New Engine Option&quot;) is a development from the initial A330 (now A330&quot;ceo&quot; — &quot;Current Engine Option&quot;). A new version with modern engines developed for the Boeing 787 was called for by owners of the current A330. It was launched in July 2014 at the Farnborough Airshow, promising 14% better fuel economy per seat. It will use the larger Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 exclusively. Its two versions are based on the A330-200 and -300: the -800 should cover with 257 passengers while the -900 should cover with 287 passengers. The -900 made its first flight on 19 October 2017, received its EASA type certificate on 26 September 2018, and was first delivered to TAP Air Portugal on 26 November. The -800 made its first flight on 6 November 2018, aiming for a mid 2019 type certification and delivery in the first half of 2020.

===Production===

Airbus announced in February 2011 that it intended to raise production rates from seven-and-a-half/eight per month to nine per month in 2012, and ten in 2013. Production increased to 10 aircraft per month in April 2013, the highest for any Airbus wide-body aircraft. In 2012, Airbus expected the A330 to continue selling until at least 2020, with the A350-900 expected to replace the A330-300.

On 19 July 2013, Airbus delivered its 1000th A330 to Cathay Pacific. The A330 became the first Airbus wide-body airliner to reach 1,000 deliveries, and the fourth wide-body to achieve the milestone after the Boeing 747, 767, and 777. As of January 2019, a total of 1,496 A330ceos had been ordered, with 1,437 delivered.

In December 2014, Airbus announced that it would reduce A330 production to nine aircraft per month from ten, because of falling orders. Airbus did not rule out any further production cuts. The announcement led to an immediate drop in Airbus Group&#x27;s stock price because the company derived a significant percentage of its cash flow and net profit from the A330 program; the A330&#x27;s financial impact was magnified amid problems in the A350 and A380 programs. In February 2015, Airbus announced another production rate cut to six aircraft per month in the first quarter of 2016. This would extend A330ceo production to July 2017, allowing for a smooth transition to A330neo production, which was set to start in spring 2017. In February 2016, Airbus announced it would re-increase the production rate from 6 to 7 per month, in response to new A330 orders.

In April 2018, as a result of weakening demand, Airbus announced further rate cuts to 4-5 aircraft a month (50 per year) in 2019. In 2019, Airbus delivered 53 A330s (including 41 A330neos), including some delayed from 2018, and was set to reach a rate of 40 per year, to reflect softer demand for wide-bodies, as the backlog reached 331 (including 293 A330neos) − or years&#x27; worth of production.

The last A330-200 was delivered to OpenSkies (operating for LEVEL) on October 1, 2019, registered F-HLVN (subsequently reregistered EC-NNH in 2021).
The last A330-300 built was registered EI-EIN and flown to Brussels Airport on February 28, 2020; Aer Lingus took delivery on 4 March 2020. At the time, four completed A330-300s for troubled Hong Kong Airlines were still undelivered.
A330 MRTT/KC-30B and BelugaXL production both continue alongside that of the A330neo.

The COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for new jets in 2020, and Airbus cut its monthly production from 4.5 to 2 A330s.
In September 2020, the A330 reached a milestone of 1500 deliveries, Airbus&#x27;s first twin-aisle aircraft to do so, and the third overall after the Boeing 747 and 777.

==Design==


The A330 is a medium-size, wide-body aircraft, with two engines suspended on pylons under the wings. A two-wheel nose undercarriage and two four-wheel bogie main legs built by Messier-Dowty support the aeroplane on the ground. Its MTOW grew from at introduction to in 2015, enhancing its payload-range performance. John Leahy states that originally the A330 was intentionally being held down in takeoff weight and performance in order to avoid overlapping with the A340.

The airframe of the A330 features a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a wing virtually identical to that of the A340-200/300. On the A330-300, one engine is installed at the inboard pylon while the outboard pylon position is not used; for the A340-300, both engine pylons are used, which allows the A340-300 wing to sustain a higher (wing-limited) MTOW. This is as the A340&#x27;s two engines at each wing provide a more equal force distribution (engine weight) over the wing, while also the total engine weight counteracting moment is located more outboard with more engine weight located further outboard on the wing, hence the wing root bending moment with equal TOW is less on the A340-300 than on the A330-300. The A340 has a longer range and heavier payload, while the A330 has better fuel economy over the same distance.

The wings were designed and manufactured by BAe, which developed a long slender wing with a very high aspect ratio to provide high aerodynamic efficiency. The wing is swept back at 30 degrees and, along with other design features, allows a maximum operating Mach number of 0.86. To reach a long span and high aspect ratio without a large weight penalty, the wing has relatively high thickness-to-chord ratio of 11.8% or 12.8%. Jet airliners have Thickness-to-chord ratios ranging from 9.4% (MD-11 or Boeing 747) to 13% (Avro RJ or 737 Classic). Each wing also has a tall winglet instead of the wingtip fences found on earlier Airbus aircraft.

The shared wing design with the A340 allowed the A330 to incorporate aerodynamic features developed for the former aircraft. The failure of International Aero Engines&#x27; radical ultra-high-bypass V2500 &quot;SuperFan&quot;, which had promised around 15 per cent fuel burn reduction for the A340, led to multiple enhancements including wing upgrades to compensate. Originally designed with a span, the wing was later extended to and finally to . At , the wingspan is similar to that of the larger Boeing 747-200, but with 35 percent less wing area.

The A330 and A340 fuselage is based on that of the Airbus A300-600, with many common parts, and has the same external and cabin width: and . Typical seating arrangements are 2–2–2 six-abreast in business class and 2–4–2 eight-abreast in economy class. The fin, rudder, elevators, horizontal tail plane (used as fuel tank), flaps, ailerons, and spoilers are made of composite materials, making 10% of the structure weight. When necessary, the A330 uses the Honeywell 331–350C auxiliary power unit (APU) to provide pneumatics and electrical power.

The A330 shares the same glass cockpit flight deck layout as the A320 and the A340, featuring electronic instrument displays rather than mechanical gauges. Instead of a conventional control yoke, the flight deck features side-stick controls, six main displays, and the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS), which covers navigation and flight displays, as well as the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM). Apart from the flight deck, the A330 also has the fly-by-wire system common to the A320 family, the A340, the A350, and the A380. It also features three primary and two secondary flight control systems, as well as a flight envelope limit protection system which prevents maneuvers from exceeding the aircraft&#x27;s aerodynamic and structural limits.

==Operational history==
Airbus intended the A330 to compete in the Extended-range Twin-engine Operation Performance Standards (ETOPS) market, specifically with the Boeing 767. (ETOPS is a standard that allows longer range flights away from a diversion airport for aircraft that have met special design and testing standards.) Instead of the &quot;ETOPS out of the box&quot; or &quot;Early ETOPS&quot; approach taken by Boeing with its 777, Airbus gradually increased ETOPS approval on the A330 using in-service experience. Airbus suggested that the A340 and the A330 were essentially identical except for their engine number, and that the A340&#x27;s experience could be applied to the A330&#x27;s ETOPS approval. The plans were for all three engine types to enter service with 90-minute approval, before increasing to 120 minutes after the total A330 fleet accumulated 25,000 flight hours, and then to 180 minutes after 50,000 flight hours, in 1995. Aer Lingus and Cathay Pacific were two important airlines assisting Airbus in this endeavour by building up in-service flight hours on over-ocean flights. In November 2009, the A330 became the first aircraft to receive ETOPS–240 approval, which has since been offered by Airbus as an option.

, the global A330 fleet of 1,471 aircraft had 12 years average aircraft age (≈2.5 years for A330neo), opened more than 350 new city pairs since the launch of the Boeing 787 in 2011, and accumulated more than 65 million flight hours since its entry into service with 99.2% operational reliability.

==Variants==
With the launch of Airbus A330neo, the existing members of the Airbus A330 family (A330-200, 200F, 300, and MRTT) received the Airbus A330ceo (&quot;current engine option&quot;) name.

The A330-200 is a shortened, longer-range variant, which entered service in 1998 with Canada 3000. The typical range with 253 passengers in a three-class configuration is . The A330-200 is ten fuselage frames shorter than the original −300, with a length of . To compensate for the smaller moment arm of the shorter fuselage, the vertical stabiliser height of the -200 was increased by . The −200&#x27;s wing was also modified; structural strengthening of the wing allowed the maximum takeoff weight of the −200 to be increased to . The −200 is offered with three engine types similar to those found on the −300, namely the General Electric CF6-80E, Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000, or Rolls-Royce Trent 700. Airbus also boosted fuel capacity to by adding the centre section fuel tank, standard in the A340.

A new vertical stabiliser was introduced in 2004 beginning with MSN 555. This newer fin is shorter in height by and was derived from the design of the vertical stabiliser of the A340-500 and -600, later becoming standard on all new A330-200s.

In 2008, Airbus released plans for a higher gross weight version of the A330-200 to more effectively compete against the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The new-build A330-200HGW had a 5 tonne increase in Maximum Takeoff Weight, allowing a range increase and a payload increase. Korean Air became the first customer on 27 February 2009 with an order for six −200HGWs. Deliveries of the first aircraft started in 2010.

In mid 2012, Airbus proposed another version of the −200 with the maximum gross weight increased by to . This version had its range extended by and carried more payload. It saw engine and aerodynamic improvements reducing its fuel burn by about 2%. In November 2012, it was announced that the gross weight was to be further increased to with the range extended by over the version. It was certified by the EASA on 8 September 2015.

As a result of its vastly increased range while still maintaining the fuel efficiency of the larger A330-300, the A330-200 came into internal competition with the initial A340 variants; the A330-200 proved much more popular than the A340-200 which carried fewer passengers and its only advantage was an extra range of 2000 miles that most airline routes did not need; the A330-200 managed to approach (though not match) the range of the A340-300 which did have a higher passenger capacity. This in turn led to Airbus making significant changes for subsequent A340 variants for significantly increased capacity and further range to distinguish the resultant A340-500/600 from the A330 family. The A330−200 competes with the Boeing 767-300ER and the new 787-8.

In 1998, a newly delivered -200 was valued $94 million, rose over $100 million in 2005 but lowered at almost $75 million in 2019 as the market favours the -300 and the A330neo. The 2018 list price was US$238.5 million. , 661 of the −200 had been ordered, 656 of which had been delivered, with 572 aircraft in operation.

====A330-200F====
The A330-200F is an all-cargo derivative of the A330-200 capable of carrying over or up to . To overcome the standard A330&#x27;s nose-down body angle on the ground, the A330F uses a revised nose undercarriage layout to provide a level deck during cargo loading. The normal A330-200 undercarriage is used, but its attachment points are lower in the fuselage, thus requiring a distinctive blister fairing on the nose to accommodate the retracted nose gear. Power is provided by two Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000 or Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines. General Electric does not offer an engine for the A330-200F.

And unlike the passenger variant, the A330-200F does not offer a centre tank as a standard equipment in order to save the weight of the inerting system, reducing fuel capacity by 41,560 litres. However, it is still offered as an optional equipment per customer needs.

 Airbus had delivered 38 aircraft with no outstanding orders. The list price is $241.7 million. As well as new-build freighters, Airbus has proposed passenger-to-freighter conversions of existing −200 airliners. The A330-200F is sized between the 767-300F and 777F, but trails both Boeing models in orders and deliveries.

====A330-300====
Powered by two General Electric CF6-80E1, Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000, or Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines, the long −300 has a range of , typically carries 277 passengers with a 440 exit limit and 32 LD3 containers. It received European and American certification on 21 October 1993 after 420 test flights over 1,100 hours. The −300 entered service on 16 January 1994. The A330-300 is based on a stretched A300 fuselage but with new wings, stabilisers and fly-by-wire systems.

In 2010, Airbus offered a new version of the −300 with the maximum gross weight increased by two tonnes to 235 t. This enabled extension of the range as well as 1.2 t increase in payload. In mid 2012, Airbus proposed another increase of the maximum gross weight to 240 t. It is planned to be implemented by mid 2015. This −300 version will have the range extended by and will carry 5 t more payload. It will include engine and aerodynamic improvements reducing its fuel burn by about 2%. In November 2012, it was further announced that the gross weight will increase from 235 t to 242 t, and the range will increase by to . Airbus is also planning to activate the central fuel tank for the first time for the −300 model.

As of December 2020, a total of 779 of the -300 had been ordered, 771 of which had been delivered, with 742 in operation. The 2015 list price is $264 million. The closest competitors have been the Boeing 767-400ER, 787-9, and the now out-of-production McDonnell Douglas MD-11.

====A330-300HGW====
In 2000, it was reported that Airbus was studying an A330-300 version with a higher gross weight. It was named A330-300HGW and had a takeoff weight of , greater than the -300&#x27;s weight at the time. The version would have a strengthened wing and additional fuel capacity from a centre section fuel tank. The A330-300HGW&#x27;s range was increased to over . Among those that showed interest was leasing company ILFC, which sought airliners that could fly from the US West Coast to Europe.

Power was to be supplied by all three engines offered to A330-200 and A330-300 with lower gross weight. Airbus also considered using the new Engine Alliance GP7000 engine for the A330-300HGW, which would have been the engine&#x27;s first twinjet application. The −300HGW was to enter airline service in 2004. However, the -300HGW programme was not launched and quietly disappeared.

The 240-tonne A330 reappeared years later when Airbus announced at the 2012 Farnborough Airshow that it would be an available option for both the A330-300 and the A330-200. In November 2012, the maximum take off weight was further increased to 242 tonnes. The first of these aircraft was delivered to Delta Air Lines on 28 May 2015.

====A330 Regional====
In September 2013, Airbus announced a version of the A330-300, named &quot;A330 Regional&quot; or &quot;A330-300 Regional&quot;. The A330 Regional has seating for up to around 400 passengers, with reduced engine thrust, reduced maximum takeoff weight of , and reduced range of . It is said that the maximum takeoff weight of these aircraft is an &quot;easy upgrade to &quot;, which is the extended range version with range of . It is said to provide up to 26% lower operating costs than the longer range version A330-300.

On 18 August 2016, Airbus delivered the first A330 Regional to Saudia.

====A330P2F====
The A330P2F freighter conversion programme was launched at the 2012 Singapore Airshow with the support of Airbus, their Dresden-based Elbe Flugzeugwerke (EFW) joint venture and Singapore-based engineering firm ST Aerospace. Targeting a 2016 introduction, Airbus then estimated a market requirement for 2,700 freighters over 20 years, half of these mid sized, including 900 conversions.

The A330-300P2F, adapted for express delivery and e-commerce lower densities, can carry up to over . Following flight tests in October 2017 and EASA supplemental type certificate awarded in November, the first was delivered to DHL on 1 December.

The A330-200P2F can carry over . Following June Flight tests and the STC in July, the first was delivered to EgyptAir Cargo on 3 August 2018.

The P2F version of the A330 retains the passenger aircraft&#x27;s geometry and incorporates a powered cargo loading system to enable pallets to be moved &quot;uphill&quot; on the main cargo deck, and therefore does not have the distinctive nose blister, or &quot;bulge&quot;, of the factory delivered A330-200F.

On 3 March 2022, Air Transport Services Group (ATSG), an air freighter lessor, committed to acquiring 29 Airbus A330-300 Passenger-to-Freighter (P2F) conversion slots from EFW with deliveries in the 2023 to 2027 timeframe. The aircraft will be converted mainly at EFW&#x27;s facility in Dresden, Germany, and at a new conversion site in Shanghai, China.

===A330neo===
==== A330-800 ====

The Airbus A330-800 is based on the A330-200, with, cabin modifications, larger Trent 7000 engines and aerodynamic improvements. The A330-800s maiden flight took place on 6 November 2018. The first two A330-800s were delivered to their launch customer Kuwait Airways in October 2020.

====A330-900====
The Airbus A330-900 maintains the A330-300&#x27;s fuselage dimensions with 10 more seats thanks to cabin optimisation. With modern Trent 7000 engines and redesigned winglets, it should burn 14% less fuel per seat than the A330-300 over a distance of . It should travel with 287 passengers in a standard configuration. The A330-900 made its maiden flight on 19 October 2017 and received its EASA type certificate on 26 September 2018; it entered service with its launch customer, TAP Air Portugal, on 15 December 2018.

===BelugaXL (large cargo freighter)===

Airbus started design of a replacement aircraft for the Beluga in November 2014. The BelugaXL A330-743L is based on the Airbus A330, and has 30% more space than its predecessor. Like the Beluga, the BelugaXL features an extension on its fuselage top, but can accommodate two A350 wings instead of one. The new aircraft rolled out of the assembly line on 4 January 2018, making its maiden flight on 19 July 2018. It began ferrying cargo between different Airbus factories in January 2020.

===Corporate jet variants===
====ACJ330====
The A330-200 is available as an ultra-long-range Airbus Corporate Jet known as the A330-200 Prestige, with a range of and a capacity of 50 passengers.

====ACJ330neo====
A corporate jet version of the new A330neo capable of flying 25 passengers or 21 hours, enough to fly non-stop from Europe to Australia.

===Military variants===

====Airbus A330 MRTT====
The Airbus A330 MRTT is the Multi-Role Transport and Tanker (MRTT) version of the A330-200, designed for aerial refuelling and strategic transport. , approximately 60 orders had been placed for the A330 MRTT by air forces of thirteen countries.

====EADS/Northrop Grumman KC-45====
The EADS/Northrop Grumman KC-45 was a proposed version of the A330 MRTT for the United States Air Force (USAF)&#x27;s KC-X aerial refuelling programme. In February 2008, the USAF selected the aircraft to replace the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker. The replacement process was mired in controversy, instances of corruption, and allegations of favouritism. In July 2010, EADS submitted a tanker bid to the USAF without Northrop Grumman as a partner. However, on 24 February 2011, the USAF picked the Boeing KC-767 proposal, later named KC-46, as the winner because of its lower cost.

==Operators==
, a total of 1,461 A330 family aircraft, comprising 549 A330-200s, 38 -200Fs, 723 -300s, 7 -800s and 144 -900s, are in airline service with 149 operators. The five largest operators were Delta Air Lines (74), Turkish Airlines (60), China Eastern Airlines (56), Air China (47) and Cathay Pacific (41).

By 2012, the 830 A330s in service with over 90 operators had accumulated five million revenue flights and 20 million flight hours, with a dispatch reliability above 99%. In November 2017, 1,190 were transporting passengers with 106 airlines (the top 29 operated two-thirds of the fleet), consisting of 530 -200s and 660 A330-300s, mainly high-gross-weight, with 36 original shorter-range A330-300s, half of them built since January 2010. Its average sector is ; the longest flight for the -200 was , from Buenos Aires to Rome, by Aerolíneas Argentinas, and , from Paris to Reunion, by Corsair and French Blue for the -300.
Of operators of at least five A330s, 17 have ordered A350-900s, 11 have ordered 787-8/9s, 13 both, 3 have ordered A330neos and 2 both A330neos and A350s; 14 haven&#x27;t yet decided on a replacement. By August 2019, the A330 was operated between over 400 airports in the world, by more than 120 operators, while its average dispatch reliability was over 99% and annual utilization up to 6,000 flight hours. The 1,500th airplane, an A330-900 (A330neo), was delivered to Delta Air Lines on 21 September 2020. In June 2023, the A330 became the second most delivered wide-body airliner after the Boeing 777. In May 2024, the A330 became the second wide-body airliner after the Boeing 777 to reach 1,600 deliveries.

===Orders and deliveries===
, A330 family aircraft orders stood at 1,863 of which 1,623 had been delivered, excluding 2 A330-900 delivered to Air Belgium via Airbus Financial Services.

==Accidents and incidents==
, the Airbus A330 has been involved in 46 aviation accidents and incidents, including 14 hull-losses (10 due to flight related accidents and 4 due to criminal related accidents), for a total of 339 fatalities.

=== Accidents ===
The A330&#x27;s first fatal accident occurred on 30 June 1994 near Toulouse on a test flight when an Airbus-owned A330-300 crashed while simulating an engine failure on climbout, killing all seven on board. Airbus subsequently advised A330 operators to disconnect the autopilot and limit pitch attitude in the event of an engine failure at low speed.

The second fatal and deadliest accident, and first while in commercial service, occurred on 1 June 2009 when Air France Flight 447, an A330-200 registered as F-GZCP, en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris with 228 people on board, crashed in the Atlantic Ocean northeast of the islands of Fernando de Noronha, with no survivors. Malfunctioning pitot tubes provided an early focus for the investigation, as the aircraft involved had Thales-built &quot;–AA&quot; models known to indicate faulty airspeed data during icing conditions. In July 2009, Airbus advised A330 and A340 operators to replace Thales pitots with equivalents manufactured by Goodrich. Investigators later determined that the inadequate response of the pilots to both a loss of airspeed data from malfunctioning pitot tubes and subsequent autopilot disengagement followed by incorrect reaction by the pilot flying resulted in Flight 447 entering into an aerodynamic stall.

On 12 May 2010, Afriqiyah Airways Flight 771, an A330-200 registered as 5A-ONG, crashed on approach to Tripoli International Airport, Libya, on a flight from O. R. Tambo International Airport, Johannesburg, South Africa. Of the 104 people on board, all but one nine-year-old Dutch child died. The cause of the crash was determined to be pilot error.

On 23 October 2022, Korean Air Flight 631, an Airbus A330-300 registered as HL7525, operating from Seoul to Cebu, crash landed and overshot the runway while landing in poor weather at night.

=== Incidents ===
; Engine related
Several in-flight shutdowns of Trent 700–powered A330-300s have occurred. On 11 November 1996, engine failure on a Cathay Pacific flight forced it back to Ho Chi Minh City. On 17 April 1997, Dragonair experienced an engine shutdown on an A330, caused by carbon clogging the oil filter. As a result, Cathay Pacific self-suspended its 120-minute ETOPS clearance. Another engine failure occurred on 6 May during climbout with a Cathay Pacific A330, due to a bearing failure in a Hispano-Suiza-built gearbox. Three days later, a Cathay Pacific A330 on climbout during a Bangkok–Hong Kong flight experienced an oil pressure drop and a resultant engine spool down, forcing a return to Bangkok. The cause was traced to metal contamination in the engine&#x27;s master chip. Following a fifth engine failure on 23 May, Cathay Pacific and Dragonair voluntarily grounded their A330 fleets for two weeks, causing major disruption as Cathay&#x27;s eleven A330s made up fifteen per cent of its passenger capacity. Rolls-Royce and Hispano-Suiza developed a redesigned lubrication system to fix the problem.

Other engines have issues too: on 14 July 2015, an Asiana PW4000 was shut down in flight, on 15 January 2017, an Air Europa CF6 was shut down in flight, on 28 December 2017, an Aer Lingus CF6 was shut down in flight, on 18 January 2018, a Malaysia Airlines PW4000 was shut down in flight, on 13 February 2018, a Delta Air Lines PW4000 caught fire, on April 18, 2018, another Delta Air Lines PW4000 caught fire, on 29 May 2018, a Delta Air Lines PW4000 had engine vibrations, on 1 June 2018, a Qantas CF6 was shut down in flight, on 1 October 2018, a China Airlines CF6 had an engine problem, and on 5 November 2018, a Brussels Airlines PW4000 was shut down in flight.

; Flight data related
In 2008, Air Caraïbes reported two incidents of pitot tube icing malfunctions on its A330s.

On 7 October 2008, Qantas Flight 72, an A330-300, suffered a rapid loss of altitude in two sudden uncommanded pitch-down manoeuvres while from the RAAF Learmonth air base in northwestern Australia. After declaring an emergency, the crew landed the aircraft safely at Learmonth. It was later determined that the incident, which caused 106 injuries, 14 of them serious, was the result of a design flaw of the plane&#x27;s Air Data Inertial Reference Unit and a limitation of the aircraft&#x27;s flight computer software.

; Fuel system related
On 24 August 2001, Air Transat Flight 236, an A330-200, developed a fuel leak over the Atlantic Ocean due to an incorrectly installed hydraulic part and was forced to glide for over 15 minutes to an emergency landing in the Azores.

On 13 April 2010, Cathay Pacific Flight 780, an A330-300, from Surabaya Juanda International Airport to Hong Kong landed safely after contaminated fuel caused both engines to fail. Fifty-seven passengers and six crew members were injured. Its two pilots received the Polaris Award from the International Federation of Air Line Pilots&#x27; Associations for their heroism and airmanship.

; Chemical and fire related
On 15 March 2000, a Malaysia Airlines A330-300 suffered structural damage due to leaking oxalyl chloride, a corrosive chemical substance that had been improperly labeled before shipping. The aircraft was written off.

On 27 August 2019, an Air China A330-300 at Beijing Capital International Airport caught fire while at the gate. The passengers and crew were safely evacuated. The airplane was likely damaged beyond repair.

; Hijackings and war related
The two hijackings involving the A330 have resulted in one fatality, namely the hijacker of Philippine Airlines Flight 812 on 25 May 2000, who jumped out of the aircraft to his death. The hijacking of Sabena Flight 689 on 13 October 2000 ended with no casualties when Spanish police took control of the aircraft. On 24 July 2001, two unoccupied SriLankan Airlines A330s were destroyed amid an attack on Bandaranaike International Airport, in Colombo, Sri Lanka, by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. On 25 December 2009, passengers and crew subdued a man who attempted to detonate explosives in his underwear on an A330-300 operating Northwest Airlines Flight 253.

On 15 July 2014, a Libyan Airlines A330 was severely damaged in the fighting in Libya and sustained bullet holes in the fuselage. On 20 July 2014, two Afriqiyah Airways Airbus A330s were hit by an RPG at Tripoli International Airport. One was completely destroyed in the ensuing fire.

On 15 April 2023, a Saudia A330 registered HZ-AQ30 was destroyed in Sudan bombings during an ongoing military coup.

<text>Vincent Voiture (; 24 February 1597 – 26 May 1648), French Mannerist and Baroque &quot;Précieuses&quot; poet and writer of prose, was the son of a rich wine merchant of Amiens. He was introduced by a schoolfellow, the count Claude d&#x27;Avaux, to Gaston, Duke of Orléans, and accompanied him to Brussels and Lorraine on diplomatic missions.

Although a follower of the Duke of Orléans, he won the favour of Cardinal Richelieu, and was one of the earliest members of the Académie française. He also received appointments and pensions from Louis XIII and Anne of Austria.

He published nothing in book form, but his verses and his prose letters (published after his death by his nephew) were the delight of the coteries, and were copied, handed about and admired more perhaps than the work of any contemporary. He had been early introduced by Chaudebonne to the &quot;Hôtel de Rambouillet&quot;, where he became a close friend of Julie d&#x27;Angennes, the daughter of Charles d&#x27;Angennes and Catherine de Vivonne, &quot;marquis&quot; and &quot;marquise de Rambouillet&quot;. His ingenuity in providing amusement for the members of the circle ensured his popularity, which was never seriously threatened except by Antoine Godeau (nicknamed &quot;le Nain de Julie&quot;), and this rivalry ceased when Richelieu appointed Godeau bishop of Grasse.

When at the desire of the duc de Montausier, nineteen poets contributed to the &quot;Guirlande de Julie&quot;, which was to decide the much-fêted Julie in favour of his suit, Voiture did not take part. The quarrel between the &quot;Uranistes&quot; and the &quot;Jobelins&quot; arose over the respective merits of a sonnet of Voiture addressed to a certain &quot;Uranie&quot;, and of another composed by Isaac de Benserade, till then unknown, on the subject of &quot;Job&quot;.

Another famous piece of his of the same kind, &quot;La Belle Matineuse&quot;, is less exquisite, but still admirable, and Voiture stands in the highest rank of writers of &quot;vers de société&quot;. His prose letters are full of lively wit, and, in some cases, as in the letter on Richelieu&#x27;s policy (Letter LXXIV), show considerable political penetration. He ranks with Jean de Balzac as the chief director of the reform in French prose which accompanied that of Malherbe in French verse.

Voiture&#x27;s death, on 26 May 1648, at the outbreak of the Fronde, marked the beginning of the end of the society to which he was accustomed.

<doc id="164943" wikidata="Q1368276" url="?curid=164943" title="Paul Pellisson">
<text>Paul Pellisson (30 October 1624 – 7 February 1693) was a French author, associated with the Baroque &quot;Précieuses&quot; movement.

Pellisson was born in Béziers, of a distinguished Calvinist family. He studied law at Toulouse, and practised at the bar of Castres. Going to Paris with letters of introduction to Valentin Conrart, a fellow Calvinist, he was introduced to the members of the Académie française. Pellisson undertook to be their historian, and in 1653 published a &quot;Relation contenant l&#x27;histoire de l’Académie française&quot;. He was rewarded with a promise of the next vacant place and permission to be present at their meetings.

In 1657 Pellisson became secretary to the minister of finance, Nicolas Fouquet, but when, in 1661, Fouquet was arrested, his secretary was imprisoned in the Bastille. Pellisson had the courage to stand by his fallen patron, in whose defence he issued his celebrated &quot;Mémoire&quot; in 1661, with the title &quot;Discours au roi, par un de ses fidèles sujets sur le procès de M. de Fouquet&quot;, in which the facts in favour of Fouquet are marshalled with great skill. Another pamphlet, &quot;Seconde défense de M. Fouquet&quot;, followed.

Pellisson was released in 1666, and sought the royal favour. He became official historian to the king, and in that capacity wrote a fragmentary &quot;Histoire de Louis XIV&quot;, covering the years 1660 to 1670. In 1670 he was converted to Catholicism and obtained rich ecclesiastical preferment.

He was very intimate with Mlle de Scudéry, in whose novels he figures as &quot;Herminius&quot; and &quot;Acante&quot;. He had many friends, and Bussy-Rabutin&#x27;s described him as &quot;&quot;encore plus honnête homme que bel esprit&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="164945" wikidata="Q184963" url="?curid=164945" title="Edo period">
<text>The , also known as the , is the period between 1600 or 1603 and 1868 in the history of Japan, when the country was under the rule of the Tokugawa shogunate and some 300 regional &quot;daimyo&quot;, or feudal lords. Emerging from the chaos of the Sengoku period, the Edo period was characterized by prolonged peace and stability, urbanization and economic growth, strict social order, isolationist foreign policies, and popular enjoyment of arts and culture.

In 1600, Tokugawa Ieyasu prevailed at the Battle of Sekigahara and established hegemony over most of Japan, and in 1603 was given the title &quot;shogun&quot; by Emperor Go-Yōzei. Ieyasu resigned two years later in favor of his son Hidetada, but maintained power, and defeated the primary rival to his authority, Toyotomi Hideyori, at the Siege of Osaka in 1615 before his death the next year. Peace generally prevailed from this point on, making samurai largely redundant. Tokugawa shoguns continued Ieyasu&#x27;s policies of conformity, including a formalization of social classes in a strict hierarchy. By 1639, all foreigners were expelled under the policy of &quot;sakoku&quot;, with the exception of Dutch traders on the island of Dejima in Nagasaki, beginning a period of isolation. From 1635, &quot;daimyō&quot; had to spend alternating years in the capital Edo, where their family was required to reside permanently, in a system of &quot;alternate attendance&quot; in order to keep them in check.

During the Edo period, merchants greatly prospered, and laid the foundation for Japan&#x27;s later &quot;zaibatsu&quot; business conglomerates. Despite general restrictions on travel within the country, &quot;daimyō&quot; processions to and from Edo developed a network of roads and inns. A commoner culture emerged in Edo and cities such as Ōsaka and Kyōto, and art forms such as &quot;kabuki&quot; and &quot;ukiyo-e&quot; flourished. Japanese scholars developed schools of neo-Confucian philosophy, and samurai, now mostly employed as administrators, formalized their code of morality in the &quot;bushido&quot; code. In 1853, Japan was opened to Western trade by United States Commodore Matthew C. Perry, beginning the &quot;Bakumatsu&quot; (&quot;end of the &quot;bakufu&quot;&quot;) era. The Edo period came to an end in 1868 with the Meiji Restoration and the Boshin War, which restored imperial rule to Japan.

== Consolidation of the shogunate ==
A revolution took place from the time of the Kamakura shogunate, which existed with the Tennō&#x27;s court, to the Tokugawa, when the &quot;samurai&quot; became the unchallenged rulers in what historian Edwin O. Reischauer called a &quot;centralized feudal&quot; form of the shogunate. Instrumental in the rise of the new bakufu was Tokugawa Ieyasu, the main beneficiary of the achievements of Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Already a powerful &quot;daimyo&quot; (feudal lord), Ieyasu profited by his transfer to the rich Kantō area. He maintained two million &quot;koku&quot;, or thirty-six hectares of land, a new headquarters at Edo, a strategically situated castle town (the future Tokyo), and also had an additional two million &quot;koku&quot; of land and thirty-eight vassals under his control. After Hideyoshi&#x27;s death, Ieyasu moved quickly to seize control of the Toyotomi clan.

Ieyasu&#x27;s victory over the western &quot;daimyo&quot; at the Battle of Sekigahara (October 21, 1600, or in the old Japanese calendar, on the 15th day of the ninth month of the fifth year of the Keichō era) gave him control of all Japan. He rapidly abolished numerous enemy &quot;daimyo&quot; houses, reduced others, such as that of the Toyotomi, and redistributed the spoils of war to his family and allies. Ieyasu still failed to achieve complete control of the western &quot;daimyo&quot;, but his assumption of the title of &quot;shōgun&quot; helped consolidate the alliance system. After further strengthening his power base, Ieyasu installed his son Hidetada (1579–1632) as &quot;shōgun&quot; and himself as retired &quot;shōgun&quot; in 1605. The Toyotomi were still a significant threat, and Ieyasu devoted the next decade to their eradication. In 1615, the Tokugawa army destroyed the Toyotomi stronghold at Osaka.

The Tokugawa (or Edo) period brought 250 years of stability to Japan. The political system evolved into what historians call &quot;bakuhan&quot;, a combination of the terms &quot;bakufu&quot; and &quot;han&quot; (domains) to describe the government and society of the period. In the &quot;bakuhan&quot;, the &quot;shōgun&quot; had national authority, and the &quot;daimyo&quot; had regional authority. This represented a new unity in the feudal structure, which featured an increasingly large bureaucracy to administer the mixture of centralized and decentralized authorities. The Tokugawa became more powerful during their first century of rule: land redistribution gave them nearly seven million &quot;koku&quot;, control of the most important cities, and a land assessment system reaping great revenues.

The feudal hierarchy was completed by the various classes of &quot;daimyo&quot;. Closest to the Tokugawa house were the &quot;shinpan&quot;, or &quot;related houses&quot;. There were twenty-three &quot;daimyo&quot; on the borders of Tokugawa lands, all directly related to Ieyasu. The shinpan held mostly honorary titles and advisory posts in the bakufu. The second class of the hierarchy was the &quot;fudai&quot;, or &quot;house &quot;daimyo&quot;&quot;, rewarded with lands close to the Tokugawa holdings for their faithful service. By the 18th century, 145 &quot;fudai&quot; controlled much smaller &quot;han&quot;, the greatest assessed at 250,000 &quot;koku&quot;.

Members of the &quot;fudai&quot; class staffed most of the major bakufu offices. Ninety-seven &quot;han&quot; formed the third group, the &quot;tozama&quot; (outside vassals), former opponents or new allies. The &quot;tozama&quot; were located mostly on the peripheries of the archipelago and collectively controlled nearly ten million &quot;koku&quot; of productive land. Because the &quot;tozama&quot; were the least trusted of the &quot;daimyo&quot;, they were the most cautiously managed and generously treated, although they were excluded from central government positions.

The Tokugawa shogunate not only consolidated their control over a reunified Japan, but also had unprecedented power over the emperor, the court, all &quot;daimyo,&quot; and the religious orders. The emperor was held up as the ultimate source of political sanction for the &quot;shōgun&quot;, who ostensibly was the vassal of the imperial family. The Tokugawa helped the imperial family recapture its old glory by rebuilding its palaces and granting it new lands. To ensure a close tie between the imperial clan and the Tokugawa family, Ieyasu&#x27;s granddaughter was made an imperial consort in 1619.

A code of laws was established to regulate the &quot;daimyo&quot; houses. The code encompassed private conduct, marriage, dress, types of weapons, and numbers of troops allowed; required feudal lords to reside in Edo every other year (the &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot; system); prohibited the construction of ocean-going ships; restricted castles to one per domain (&quot;han&quot;) and stipulated that bakufu regulations were the national law. Although the &quot;daimyo&quot; were not taxed per se, they were regularly levied for contributions to military and logistical support and for public works such as projects as castles, roads, bridges, and palaces.

The various regulations and levies not only strengthened the Tokugawa but also depleted the wealth of the &quot;daimyo&quot;, thus weakening their threat to the central administration. The &quot;han&quot;, once military-centered domains, became mere local administrative units. The &quot;daimyo&quot; had full administrative control over their territory and their complex systems of retainers, bureaucrats, and commoners. Loyalty was exacted from religious foundations, already greatly weakened by Nobunaga and Hideyoshi, through a variety of control mechanisms.

==Foreign trade relations==

Like Hideyoshi, Ieyasu encouraged foreign trade but also was suspicious of outsiders. He wanted to make Edo a major port, but once he learned that the Europeans favoured ports in Kyūshū and that China had rejected his plans for official trade, he moved to control existing trade and allowed only certain ports to handle specific kinds of commodities.
The beginning of the Edo period coincides with the last decades of the Nanban trade period during which intense interaction with European powers, on the economic and religious plane, took place. It is at the beginning of the Edo period that Japan built its first ocean-going warships, such as the &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot;, a 500-ton galleon-type ship that transported a Japanese embassy headed by Hasekura Tsunenaga to the Americas and then to Europe. Also during that period, the &quot;bakufu&quot; commissioned around 720 Red Seal Ships, three-masted and armed trade ships, for intra-Asian commerce. Japanese adventurers, such as Yamada Nagamasa, used those ships throughout Asia.

The &quot;Christian problem&quot; was, in effect, a problem of controlling both the Christian &quot;daimyo&quot; in Kyūshū and their trade with the Europeans. By 1612, the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s retainers and residents of Tokugawa lands had been ordered to forswear Christianity. More restrictions came in 1616 (the restriction of foreign trade to Nagasaki and Hirado, an island northwest of Kyūshū), 1622 (the execution of 120 missionaries and converts), 1624 (the expulsion of the Spanish), and 1629 (the execution of thousands of Christians).

Finally, the Closed Country Edict of 1635 prohibited any Japanese from travelling outside Japan or, if someone left, from ever returning. In 1636, the Dutch were restricted to Dejima, a small artificial island—and thus, not true Japanese soil—in Nagasaki&#x27;s harbor.

The shogunate perceived Christianity to be an extremely destabilizing factor, and so decided to target it. The Shimabara Rebellion of 1637–1638, in which discontented Catholic samurai and peasants rebelled against the bakufu—and Edo called in Dutch ships to bombard the rebel stronghold—marked the end of the Christian movement. During the Shimabara Rebellion an estimated 37,000 people (mostly Christians) were massacred. In 50 years, the Tokugawa shoguns reduced the amount of Christians to near zero in Japan.

Some Christians survived by going underground, the so-called Kakure Kirishitan. Soon thereafter, the Portuguese were permanently expelled. Members of the Portuguese diplomatic mission were executed. All Japanese subjects were ordered to register at a Buddhist or Shinto temple. The Dutch and Chinese were restricted, respectively, to Dejima and to a special quarter in Nagasaki. Besides small trade of some outer &quot;daimyo&quot; with Korea and the Ryukyu Islands, to the southwest of Japan&#x27;s main islands, by 1641, foreign contacts were limited by the policy of &quot;sakoku&quot; to Nagasaki.

The last Jesuit was either killed or committed apostasy by 1644. By the 1660s, Christianity was almost completely eradicated. Its external political, economic, and religious influence on Japan became quite limited. Only China, the Dutch East India Company, and for a short period, the Portuguese, Spanish and English, enjoyed the right to visit Japan during this period, for commercial purposes only, and they were restricted to the Dejima port in Nagasaki. Other Europeans who landed on Japanese shores were put to death without trial.

==Society==
During the Tokugawa period, the social order, based on inherited position rather than personal merits, was rigid and highly formalized. At the top were the emperor and court nobles (&quot;kuge&quot;), together with the &quot;shōgun&quot; and &quot;daimyo&quot;. Older scholars believed that there were of &quot;samurai, peasants (&quot;hyakushō&quot;), craftsmen, and merchants (&quot;chōnin&quot;)&quot; under the daimyo, with 80% of peasants under the 5% samurai class, followed by craftsmen and merchants. However, various studies have revealed since about 1995 that the classes of peasants, craftsmen, and merchants under the samurai are equal, and the old hierarchy chart has been removed from Japanese history textbooks. In other words, peasants, craftsmen, and merchants are not a social pecking order, but a social classification.

Only the peasants lived in rural areas. Samurai, craftsmen and merchants lived in the cities that were built around &quot;daimyo&quot; castles, each restricted to their own quarter. Edo society had an elaborate social structure, in which every family knew its place and level of prestige.

At the top were the Emperor and the court nobility, invincible in prestige but weak in power. Next came the shōgun, &quot;daimyo&quot; and layers of feudal lords whose rank was indicated by their closeness to the Tokugawa. They had power. The &quot;daimyo&quot; comprised about 250 local lords of local &quot;han&quot; with annual outputs of 50,000 or more bushels of rice. The upper strata was much given to elaborate and expensive rituals, including elegant architecture, landscaped gardens, Noh drama, patronage of the arts, and the tea ceremony.

Then came the 400,000 warriors, called &quot;samurai&quot;, in numerous grades and degrees. A few upper samurai were eligible for high office; most were foot soldiers. Since there was very little fighting, they became civil servants paid by the daimyo, with minor duties. The samurai were affiliated with senior lords in a well-established chain of command. The shogun had 17,000 samurai retainers; the daimyo each had hundreds. Most lived in modest homes near their lord&#x27;s headquarters, and lived off of hereditary rights and stipends. Together these high status groups comprised Japan&#x27;s ruling class making up about 6% of the total population.

After a long period of inner conflict, the first goal of the newly established Tokugawa government was to pacify the country. It created a balance of power that remained fairly stable for the next 250 years, influenced by Confucian principles of social order. Most samurai lost their direct possession of the land: the &quot;daimyo&quot; took over their land. The samurai had a choice: give up their sword and become peasants, or move to the city of their feudal lord and become a paid retainer. Only a few land samurai remained in the border provinces of the north, or as direct vassals of the &quot;shōgun&quot;, the 5,000 so-called . The &quot;daimyo&quot; were put under tight control of the shogunate. Their families had to reside in Edo; the &quot;daimyo&quot; themselves had to reside in Edo for one year and in their province (&quot;han&quot;) for the next. This system was called &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot;.

Lower orders divided into two main segments—the peasants—80% of the population—whose high prestige as producers was undercut by their burden as the chief source of taxes. They were illiterate and lived in villages controlled by appointed officials who kept the peace and collected taxes.
The family was the smallest legal entity, and the maintenance of family status and privileges was of great importance at all levels of society. The individual had no separate legal rights. The 1711 &quot;Gotōke reijō&quot; was compiled from over 600 statutes promulgated between 1597 and 1696.

Outside the four classes were the so-called &quot;eta&quot; and &quot;hinin&quot;, those whose professions broke the taboos of Buddhism. &quot;Eta&quot; were butchers, tanners and undertakers. &quot;Hinin&quot; served as town guards, street cleaners, and executioners. Other outsiders included the beggars, entertainers, and prostitutes. The word &quot;eta&quot; literally translates to &quot;filthy&quot; and &quot;hinin&quot; to &quot;non-humans&quot;, a thorough reflection of the attitude held by other classes that the &quot;eta&quot; and &quot;hinin&quot; were not even people.

&quot;Hinin&quot; were only allowed inside a special quarter of the city. Other persecution of the hinin included disallowing them from wearing robes longer than knee-length and the wearing of hats. Sometimes &quot;eta&quot; villages were not even printed on official maps. A sub-class of hinin who were born into their social class had no option of mobility to a different social class whereas the other class of hinin who had lost their previous class status could be reinstated in Japanese society.

On the other hand, in practice, both &quot;eta&quot; and &quot;hinin&quot; were recognized as owners of fields, some with very large incomes (&quot;koku&quot;) and some economic power. Their chief held the title of and had the authority to issue orders to &quot;eta&quot; and &quot;hinin&quot; throughout the country, as well as jurisdiction within the &quot;eta&quot; and &quot;hinin&quot;.

In the 19th century the umbrella term &quot;burakumin&quot; was coined to name the &quot;eta&quot; and &quot;hinin&quot; because both classes were forced to live in separate village neighborhoods. The &quot;eta&quot;, &quot;hinin&quot; and &quot;burakumin&quot; classes were officially abolished in 1871. However, their cultural and societal impact, including some forms of discrimination, continues into modern times.

==Economic development==

The Edo period passed on a vital commercial sector to be in flourishing urban centers, a relatively well-educated elite, a sophisticated government bureaucracy, productive agriculture, a closely unified nation with highly developed financial and marketing systems, and a national infrastructure of roads. Economic development during the Tokugawa period included urbanization, increased shipping of commodities, a significant expansion of domestic and, initially, foreign commerce, and a diffusion of trade and handicraft industries. The construction trades flourished, along with banking facilities and merchant associations. Increasingly, &quot;han&quot; authorities oversaw the rising agricultural production and the spread of rural handicrafts.

===Population===

By the mid-18th century, Edo had a population of more than one million, likely the biggest city in the world at the time. Osaka and Kyoto each had more than 400,000 inhabitants. Many other castle towns grew as well. Osaka and Kyoto became busy trading and handicraft production centers, while Edo was the center for the supply of food and essential urban consumer goods. Around the year 1700, Japan was perhaps the most urbanized country in the world, at a rate of around 10–12%. Half of that figure would be samurai, while the other half, consisting of merchants and artisans, would be known as &quot;chōnin&quot;.

In the first part of the Edo period, Japan experienced rapid demographic growth, before leveling off at around 30 million. Between the 1720s and 1820s, Japan had almost zero population growth, often attributed to lower birth rates in response to widespread famine (Great Tenmei famine 1782–1788), but some historians have presented different theories, such as a high rate of infanticide artificially controlling population.

At around 1721, the population of Japan was close to 30 million and the figure was only around 32 million around the Meiji Restoration around 150 years later. From 1721, there were regular national surveys of the population until the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate. In addition, regional surveys, as well as religious records initially compiled to eradicate Christianity, also provide valuable demographic data.

===Economy and financial services===

The Tokugawa era brought peace, and that brought prosperity to a nation of 31 million, 80% of them rice farmers. Rice production increased steadily, but population remained stable. Rice paddies grew from 1.6 million chō in 1600 to 3 million by 1720. Improved technology helped farmers control the all-important flow of water to their paddies. The daimyos operated several hundred castle towns, which became loci of domestic trade.

The system of &quot;sankin kōtai&quot; meant that daimyos and their families often resided in Edo or travelled back to their domains, giving demand to an enormous consumer market in Edo and trade throughout the country. Samurai and daimyos, after prolonged peace, were accustomed to more elaborate lifestyles. To keep up with growing expenditures, the &quot;bakufu&quot; and daimyos often encouraged commercial crops and artifacts within their domains, from textiles to tea. The concentration of wealth also led to the development of financial markets.

As the shogunate only allowed &quot;daimyos&quot; to sell surplus rice in Edo and Osaka, large-scale rice markets developed there. Each daimyo also had a capital city, located near the one castle they were allowed to maintain. Daimyos would have agents in various commercial centers, selling rice and cash crops, often exchanged for paper credit to be redeemed elsewhere. Merchants invented credit instruments to transfer money, and currency came into common use. In the cities and towns, guilds of merchants and artisans met the growing demand for goods and services.
The merchants benefited enormously, especially those with official patronage. However, the Neo-Confucian ideology of the shogunate focused the virtues of frugality and hard work; it had a rigid class system, which emphasized agriculture and despised commerce and merchants. A century after the Shogunate&#x27;s establishment, problems began to emerge. The samurai, forbidden to engage in farming or business but allowed to borrow money, borrowed too much, some taking up side jobs as bodyguards for merchants, debt collectors, or artisans.

The &quot;bakufu&quot; and &quot;daimyos&quot; raised taxes on farmers, but did not tax business, so they too fell into debt, with some merchants specializing in loaning to daimyos. Yet it was inconceivable to systematically tax commerce, as it would make money off &quot;parasitic&quot; activities, raise the prestige of merchants, and lower the status of government. As they paid no regular taxes, the forced financial contributions to the daimyos were seen by some merchants as a cost of doing business. The wealth of merchants gave them a degree of prestige and even power over the daimyos.

By 1750, rising taxes incited peasant unrest and even revolt. The nation had to deal somehow with samurai impoverishment and treasury deficits. The financial troubles of the samurai undermined their loyalties to the system, and the empty treasury threatened the whole system of government. One solution was reactionary—cutting samurai salaries and prohibiting spending for luxuries. Other solutions were modernizing, with the goal of increasing agrarian productivity.

The eighth Tokugawa shogun, Yoshimune (in office 1716–1745) had considerable success, though much of his work had to be done again between 1787 and 1793 by the shogun&#x27;s chief councilor Matsudaira Sadanobu (1759–1829). Other shoguns debased the coinage to pay debts, which caused inflation. Overall, while commerce (domestic and international) was vibrant and sophisticated financial services had developed in the Edo period, the shogunate remained ideologically focused on honest agricultural work as the basis of society and never sought to develop a mercantile or capitalistic country.

By 1800, the commercialization of the economy grew rapidly, bringing more and more remote villages into the national economy. Rich farmers appeared who switched from rice to high-profit commercial crops and engaged in local money-lending, trade, and small-scale manufacturing. Wealthy merchants were often forced to &quot;lend&quot; money to the shogunate or daimyos (often never returned). They often had to hide their wealth, and some sought higher social status by using money to marry into the samurai class. There is some evidence that as merchants gained greater political influence in the late Edo period, the rigid class division between samurai and merchants began to break down.

A few domains, notably Chōshū and Satsuma, used innovative methods to restore their finances, but most sunk further into debt. The financial crisis provoked a reactionary solution near the end of the &quot;Tempo era&quot; (1830–1843) promulgated by the chief counselor Mizuno Tadakuni. He raised taxes, denounced luxuries and tried to impede the growth of business; he failed and it appeared to many that the continued existence of the entire Tokugawa system was in jeopardy.

====Agriculture====
Rice was the base of the economy. About 80% of the people were rice farmers. Rice production increased steadily, but population remained stable, so prosperity increased. Rice paddies grew from 1.6 million chō in 1600 to 3 million by 1720. Improved technology helped farmers control the all-important flow of irrigation to their paddies. The &quot;daimyo&quot; operated several hundred castle towns, which became loci of domestic trade.

Large-scale rice markets developed, centered on Edo and Ōsaka. In the cities and towns, guilds of merchants and artisans met the growing demand for goods and services. The merchants, while low in status, prospered, especially those with official patronage. Merchants invented credit instruments to transfer money, currency came into common use, and the strengthening credit market encouraged entrepreneurship. The &quot;daimyo&quot; collected the taxes from the peasants in the form of rice. Taxes were high, often at around 40%-50% of the harvest. The rice was sold at the &quot;fudasashi&quot; market in Edo. To raise money, the &quot;daimyo&quot; used forward contracts to sell rice that was not even harvested yet. These contracts were similar to modern futures trading.

It was during the Edo period that Japan developed an advanced forest management policy. Increased demand for timber resources for construction, shipbuilding and fuel had led to widespread deforestation, which resulted in forest fires, floods and soil erosion. In response the &quot;shōgun&quot;, beginning around 1666, instituted a policy to reduce logging and increase the planting of trees. The policy mandated that only the &quot;shōgun&quot; and &quot;daimyo&quot; could authorize the use of wood. By the 18th century, Japan had developed detailed scientific knowledge about silviculture and plantation forestry.

==Artistic and intellectual development==
=== Education ===

The first shogun Ieyasu set up Confucian academies in his &quot;shinpan&quot; domains and other &quot;daimyos&quot; followed suit in their own domains, establishing what&#x27;s known as &quot;han&quot; schools (藩校, &quot;hankō&quot;). Within a generation, almost all samurai were literate, as their careers often required knowledge of literary arts. These academies were staffed mostly with other samurai, along with some buddhist and shinto clergymen who were also learned in Neo-Confucianism and the works of Zhu Xi.When the clergy of Shinto religion were alive, samurai, Buddhist monks were also there. Beyond kanji (Chinese characters), the Confucian classics, calligraphy, basic arithmetics, and etiquette, the samurai also learned various martial arts and military skills in schools.

The &quot;chōnin&quot; (urban merchants and artisans) patronized neighborhood schools called &quot;terakoya&quot; (寺子屋, &quot;temple schools&quot;). Despite being located in temples, the &quot;terakoya&quot; curriculum consisted of basic literacy and arithmetic, instead of literary arts or philosophy. High rates of urban literacy in Edo contributed to the prevalence of novels and other literary forms. In urban areas, children were often taught by masterless samurai, while in rural areas priests from Buddhist temples or Shinto shrines often did the teaching. Unlike in the cities, in rural Japan, only children of prominent farmers would receive education.

In Edo, the shogunate set up several schools under its direct patronage, the most important being the neo-Confucian acting as a de facto elite school for its bureaucracy but also creating a network of alumni from the whole country. Besides Shoheikō, other important directly run schools at the end of the shogunate included the , specialized in Japanese domestic history and literature, influencing the rise of , and the , focusing on Chinese medicine.

One estimate of literacy in Edo suggest that up to a fifth of males could read, along with a sixth of women. Another estimate states that 40% of men and 10% of women by the end of the Edo period were literate. According to another estimate, around 1800, almost 100% of the samurai class and about 50% to 60% of the &quot;chōnin&quot; (craftsmen and merchants) class and &quot;nōmin&quot; (peasants) class were literate. Some historians partially credited Japan&#x27;s relatively high literacy rates for its fast development after the Meiji Restoration.

As the literacy rate was so high that many ordinary people could read books, books in various genres such as cooking, gardening, travel guides, art books, scripts of &quot;bunraku&quot; (puppet theatre), &quot;kibyōshi&quot; (satirical novels), &quot;sharebon&quot; (books on urban culture), &quot;kokkeibon&quot; (comical books), &quot;ninjōbon&quot; (romance novel), &quot;yomihon&quot; and &quot;kusazōshi&quot; were published. There were 600 to 800 rental bookstores in Edo, and people borrowed or bought these woodblock print books. The best-selling books in this period were &quot;Kōshoku Ichidai Otoko&quot; (&quot;Life of an Amorous Man&quot;) by Ihara Saikaku, &quot;Nansō Satomi Hakkenden&quot; by Takizawa Bakin and &quot;Tōkaidōchū Hizakurige&quot; by Jippensha Ikku and these books were reprinted many times.

=== Philosophy and religion ===

The flourishing of Neo-Confucianism was the major intellectual development of the Tokugawa period. Confucian studies had long been kept active in Japan by Buddhist clerics, but during the Tokugawa period, Confucianism emerged from Buddhist religious control. This system of thought increased attention to a secular view of man and society. The ethical humanism, rationalism, and historical perspective of neo-Confucian doctrine appealed to the official class. By the mid-17th century, neo-Confucianism was Japan&#x27;s dominant legal philosophy and contributed directly to the development of the (national learning) school of thought.

Advanced studies and growing applications of neo-Confucianism contributed to the transition of the social and political order from feudal norms to class- and large-group-oriented practices. The rule of the people or Confucian man was gradually replaced by the rule of law. New laws were developed, and new administrative devices were instituted. A new theory of government and a new vision of society emerged as a means of justifying more comprehensive governance by the bakufu.

Each person had a distinct place in society and was expected to work to fulfill his or her mission in life. The people were to be ruled with benevolence by those whose assigned duty it was to rule. Government was all-powerful but responsible and humane. Although the class system was influenced by neo-Confucianism, it was not identical to it. Whereas soldiers and clergy were at the bottom of the hierarchy in the Chinese model, in Japan, some members of these classes constituted the ruling elite.

Members of the samurai class adhered to bushi traditions with a renewed interest in Japanese history and cultivation of the ways of Confucian scholar-administrators. A distinct culture known as &quot;chōnindō&quot; (&quot;the way of the townspeople&quot;) emerged in cities such as Osaka, Kyoto, and Edo. It encouraged aspiration to bushido qualities—diligence, honesty, honor, loyalty, and frugality—while blending Shinto, neo-Confucian, and Buddhist beliefs. Study of mathematics, astronomy, cartography, engineering, and medicine were also encouraged. Emphasis was placed on quality of workmanship, especially in the arts.

Buddhism and Shinto were both still important in Tokugawa Japan. Buddhism, together with neo-Confucianism, provided standards of social behavior. Although Buddhism was not as politically powerful as it had been in the past, Buddhism continued to be espoused by the upper classes. Proscriptions against Christianity benefited Buddhism in 1640 when the bakufu ordered everyone to register at a temple. The rigid separation of Tokugawa society into han, villages, wards, and households helped reaffirm local Shinto attachments. Shinto provided spiritual support to the political order and was an important tie between the individual and the community. Shinto also helped preserve a sense of national identity.

Shinto eventually assumed an intellectual form as shaped by neo-Confucian rationalism and materialism. The kokugaku movement emerged from the interactions of these two belief systems. Kokugaku contributed to the emperor-centered nationalism of modern Japan and the revival of Shinto as a national creed in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Kojiki, Nihon Shoki, and Man&#x27;yōshū were all studied anew in the search for the Japanese spirit. Some purists in the kokugaku movement, such as Motoori Norinaga, even criticized the Confucian and Buddhist influences — in effect, foreign influences — for contaminating Japan&#x27;s ancient ways. According to them, Japan was the land of the kami and, as such, had a special destiny.

During the period, Japan studied Western sciences and techniques (called &quot;rangaku&quot;, &quot;Dutch studies&quot;) through the information and books received through the Dutch traders in Dejima. The main areas that were studied included geography, medicine, natural sciences, astronomy, art, languages, physical sciences such as the study of electrical phenomena, and mechanical sciences as exemplified by the development of Japanese clockwatches, or wadokei, inspired by Western techniques. Among those who studied mechanical science at that time, Tanaka Hisashige, the founder of Toshiba, is worthy of special mention. Because of the technical originality and sophistication of his Myriad year clock and &quot;karakuri&quot; puppet, they are difficult to restore even today, and are considered to be a highly mechanical heritage prior to Japan&#x27;s modernization.

=== Art, culture and entertainment ===

In the field of art, the Rinpa school became popular. The paintings and crafts of the Rinpa school are characterized by highly decorative and showy designs using gold and silver leaves, bold compositions with simplified objects to be drawn, repeated patterns, and a playful spirit. Important figures in the Rinpa school include Hon&#x27;ami Kōetsu, Tawaraya Sōtatsu, Ogata Kōrin, Sakai Hōitsu and Suzuki Kiitsu. Other than the Rinpa school, Maruyama Ōkyo and Itō Jakuchū are famous for their realistic painting techniques. They produced their works under the patronage of wealthy merchants newly emerging from the economic development of this period. Following the Azuchi-Momoyama period, the painters of the Kano school drew pictures on the walls and fusumas of castles and temples with the support of powerful people.
Due to the end of the period of civil war and the development of the economy, many crafts with high artistic value were produced. Among the samurai class, arms came to be treated like works of art, and Japanese sword mountings and Japanese armour beautifully decorated with lacquer of &quot;maki-e&quot; technique and metal carvings became popular. Each &quot;han&quot; (daimyo domain) encouraged the production of crafts to improve their finances, and crafts such as furnishings and &quot;inro&quot; beautifully decorated with lacquer, metal or ivory became popular among rich people. The Kaga Domain, which was ruled by the Maeda clan, was especially enthusiastic about promoting crafts, and the area still boasts a reputation that surpasses Kyoto in crafts even today.

For the first time, urban populations had the means and leisure time to support a new mass culture. Their search for enjoyment became known as &quot;ukiyo&quot; (the floating world), an ideal world of fashion, popular entertainment, and the discovery of aesthetic qualities in objects and actions of everyday life. This increasing interest in pursuing recreational activities helped to develop an array of new industries, many of which could be found in an area known as Yoshiwara. The district was known for being the center of Edo&#x27;s developing sense of elegance and refinement. Established in 1617 as the city&#x27;s shogunate-sanctioned prostitution district, it kept this designation about 250 years. Yoshiwara was home to mostly women who, due to unfortunate circumstances, found themselves working in this secluded environment.

Professional female entertainers (&quot;geisha&quot;), music, popular stories, &quot;Kabuki&quot; (theater) and &quot;bunraku&quot; (puppet theater), poetry, a rich literature, and art, exemplified by beautiful woodblock prints (known as &quot;ukiyo-e&quot;), were all part of this flowering of culture. Literature also flourished with the talented examples of the playwright Chikamatsu Monzaemon (1653–1724) and the poet, essayist, and travel writer Matsuo Bashō (1644–1694).
Ukiyo-e is a genre of painting and printmaking that developed in the late 17th century, at first depicting the entertainments of the pleasure districts of Edo, such as courtesans and kabuki actors. Harunobu produced the first full-colour &quot;nishiki-e&quot; prints in 1765, a form that has become synonymous to most with ukiyo-e. The genre reached a peak in technique towards the end of the century with the works of such artists as Kiyonaga and Utamaro. As the Edo period came to an end a great diversity of genres proliferated: warriors, nature, folklore, and the landscapes of Hokusai and Hiroshige. The genre declined throughout the rest of the century in the face of modernization that saw ukiyo-e as both old-fashioned and laborious to produce compared to Western technologies. Ukiyo-e was a primary part of the wave of Japonisme that swept Western art in the late 19th century.

The Edo period was characterized by an unprecedented series of economic developments (despite termination of contact with the outside world) and cultural maturation, especially in terms of theater, music, and other entertainment. For example, a poetic meter for music called kinsei kouta-chō was invented during this time and is still used today in folk songs. Music and theater were influenced by the social gap between the noble and commoner classes, and different arts became more defined as this gap widened.

Several different types of kabuki emerged. Some, such as shibaraku, were only available at a certain time of year, while some companies only performed for nobles. Fashion trends, satirization of local news stories, and advertisements were often part of kabuki theater, as well. Along with kabuki, storytelling entertainments were popular among the common people, and people enjoyed rakugo, a comical story, and kōdan, a historical story, in a dedicated theater called yose. The most popular sport was sumo.

Eating out became popular due to urbanization. Particularly popular among ordinary people were stalls serving fast food such as soba, sushi, tempura, and unagi, tofu restaurants, teahouses and izakaya (Japanese-style pubs). A number of ryotei also opened to serve high-class food. People enjoyed eating at restaurants by buying books that listed restaurant ratings that imitated sumo rankings.

Gardening was a popular pastime. Especially in Edo, residences of daimyo (feudal lords) of each domain were gathered, and many gardeners existed to manage these gardens, which led to the development of horticultural techniques. Among people, cherry blossoms, morning glories, Japanese irises and chrysanthemums were especially popular, and bonsai using deep pots became popular. Not only did people buy plants and appreciate flowers, but they were also enthusiastic about improving the varieties of flowers, so specialized books were published one after another. For example, Matsudaira Sadatomo produced 300 varieties of iris and published a technical book.

Traveling became popular among people because of the improvement of roads and post towns. The main destinations were famous temples and Shinto shrines around the country, and eating and drinking at the inns and prostitution were one of the main attractions. What people admired most was the visit to Ise Grand Shrine and the summit of Mount Fuji, which are considered the most sacred places in Japan. The Ise Grand Shrine in particular has been visited by an enormous number of visitors.

Historical documents record that 3.62 million people visited the shrine in 50 days in 1625. 1.18 million people visited it in three days in 1829 when the grand festival held every 20 years (&quot;Shikinen Sengu&quot;) was held. It was a once-in-a-lifetime event for people living in remote areas, so they set up a joint fund for each village, saved their travel expenses, and went on a group trip. Local residents of Ise Grand Shrine and Mount Fuji used to send specialized advertising personnel to various parts of Japan to solicit trips to local areas to make money from tourism.


=== Fashion ===

Clothing acquired a wide variety of designs and decorative techniques, especially for kimono worn by women. The main consumers of kimono were the samurai who used lavish clothing and other material luxuries to signal their place at the top of the social order. Driven by this demand, the textile industry grew and used increasingly sophisticated methods of weaving, dyeing, and embroidery. Over this period, women adopted brighter colours and bolder designs, whereas women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s kimono had been very similar. The rise of a merchant class fuelled more demand for elaborate costumes. While ordinary kimono would usually be created by women at home, luxurious silk kimono were designed and created by specialist artists who were usually men.

A kind of kimono specific to the military elite is the or &quot;palace court style&quot;, which would be worn in the residence of a military leader (a or ). These would have landscape scenes, among which there are other motifs usually referencing classic literature. Samurai men would dress with a more understated design with geometrical designs concentrated around the waist. The , or sleeping kimono, is a thickly wadded form of wearable bedding, usually with simple designs.

A style called had rich decoration from the waist down only, and family emblems on the neck and shoulders. These would be worn by women of the merchant class. The kimono of merchant-class women were more subdued than those of the samurai, but still with bold colours and designs representing nature.

Red was a popular colour for wealthy women, partly because of its cultural association with youth and passion, and partly because the dyederived from safflowerwas very expensive, so a bright red garment was an ostentatious display of wealth. Indian fabrics, brought to Japan by Dutch importers, were received with enthusiasm and found many uses. Japanese designers started printing designs that were influenced by the Indian patterns. Some garments used fabric imported from Britain or France. Ownership of these exotic textiles signified wealth and taste, but they were worn as undergarments where the designs would not be seen.

Inro and netsuke became popular as accessories among men. Originally, inro was a portable case to put a seal or medicine, and netsuke was a fastener attached to the case, and both were practical tools. However, from the middle of the Edo period, products with high artistic value appeared and became popular as male accessories. Especially samurai and wealthy merchants competed to buy inro of high artistic value. At the end of the Edo period, the artistic value of inro further increased and it came to be regarded as an art collection.

==End of the shogunate==
===Decline of the Tokugawa===


The end of this period is specifically called the late Tokugawa shogunate. The cause for the end of this period is controversial but is often recounted as resulting from the forced opening of Japan to the world, by Commodore Matthew Perry of the US Navy, whose armada (known by the Japanese as &quot;the black ships&quot;) fired weapons from Edo Bay. Several artificial land masses were created to block the range of the armada, and this land remains in what is presently called the Odaiba district.

The Tokugawa did not eventually collapse simply because of intrinsic failures. Foreign intrusions helped to precipitate a complex political struggle between the &quot;bakufu&quot; and a coalition of its critics. The continuity of the anti-&quot;bakufu&quot; movement in the mid-19th century would finally bring down the Tokugawa. Historians consider that a major contributing factor to the decline of the Tokugawa was &quot;poor management of the central government by the &quot;shōgun&quot;, which caused the social classes in Japan to fall apart&quot;. From the outset, the Tokugawa attempted to restrict families&#x27; accumulation of wealth and fostered a &quot;back to the soil&quot; policy, in which the farmer, the ultimate producer, was the ideal person in society.

The standard of living for urban and rural dwellers alike grew significantly during the Tokugawa period. Better means of crop production, transport, housing, food, and entertainment were all available, as was more leisure time, at least for urban dwellers. The literacy rate was high for a preindustrial society (by some estimates the literacy rate in the city of Edo was 80 percent), and cultural values were redefined and widely imparted throughout the samurai and &quot;chōnin&quot; classes.

Despite the reappearance of guilds, economic activities went well beyond the restrictive nature of the guilds, and commerce spread and a money economy developed. Although government heavily restricted the merchants and viewed them as unproductive and usurious members of society, the samurai, who gradually became separated from their rural ties, depended greatly on the merchants and artisans for consumer goods, artistic interests, and loans. In this way, a subtle subversion of the warrior class by the &quot;chōnin&quot; took place.

A struggle arose in the face of political limitations that the &quot;shōgun&quot; imposed on the entrepreneurial class. The government ideal of an agrarian society failed to square with the reality of commercial distribution. A huge government bureaucracy had evolved, which now stagnated because of its discrepancy with a new and evolving social order. Compounding the situation, the population increased significantly during the first half of the Tokugawa period. Although the magnitude and growth rates are uncertain, there were at least 26 million commoners and about four million members of samurai families and their attendants when the first nationwide census was taken in 1721. Drought, followed by crop shortages and starvation, resulted in twenty great famines between 1675 and 1837. During the Tokugawa period, there were 154 famines, of which 21 were widespread and serious.

The Great Tenmei famine (1782 until 1788) was the worst famine in the Edo period. Many crops were damaged due to bad weather, serious cold and the 1783 eruption of Mount Asama. A worsening factor of the Great Tenmei famine was a drop in global temperatures due to the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Laki in 1783. The spread of the famine was largely due to mismanagement of the Shogunate and the clan.

Peasant unrest grew, and by the late 18th century, mass protests over taxes and food shortages had become commonplace. Newly landless families became tenant farmers, while the displaced rural poor moved into the cities. As the fortunes of previously well-to-do families declined, others moved in to accumulate land, and a new, wealthy farming class emerged. Those people who benefited were able to diversify production and to hire laborers, while others were left discontented. Many samurai fell on hard times and were forced into handicraft production and wage jobs for merchants.

Although Japan was able to acquire and refine a wide variety of scientific knowledge, the rapid industrialization of the West during the 18th century created a material gap in terms of technologies and armament between Japan and the West, forcing it to abandon its policy of seclusion, which contributed to the end of the Tokugawa regime.

Western intrusions were on the increase in the early 19th century. Russian warships and traders encroached on Karafuto (called Sakhalin under Russian and Soviet control) and on the Kuril Islands, the southernmost of which are considered by the Japanese as the northern islands of Hokkaidō. A British warship entered Nagasaki harbour searching for enemy Dutch ships in 1808, and other warships and whalers were seen in Japanese waters with increasing frequency in the 1810s and 1820s. Whalers and trading ships from the United States also arrived on Japan&#x27;s shores. Although the Japanese made some minor concessions and allowed some landings, they largely attempted to keep all foreigners out, sometimes using force. &quot;Rangaku&quot; became crucial not only in understanding the foreign &quot;barbarians&quot; but also in using the knowledge gained from the West to fend them off.

By the 1830s, there was a general sense of crisis. Famines and natural disasters hit hard, and unrest led to a peasant uprising against officials and merchants in Osaka in 1837. Although it lasted only a day, the uprising made a dramatic impression. Remedies came in the form of traditional solutions that sought to reform moral decay rather than address institutional problems. The &quot;shōgun&quot;″s advisers pushed for a return to the martial spirit, more restrictions on foreign trade and contacts, suppression of &quot;rangaku&quot;, censorship of literature, and elimination of &quot;luxury&quot; in the government and samurai class.

Others sought the overthrow of the Tokugawa and espoused the political doctrine of &quot;sonnō jōi&quot; (revere the emperor, expel the barbarians), which called for unity under imperial rule and opposed foreign intrusions. The &quot;bakufu&quot; persevered for the time being amidst growing concerns over Western successes in establishing colonial enclaves in China following the First Opium War of 1839–1842. More reforms were ordered, especially in the economic sector, to strengthen Japan against the Western threat.

Japan turned down a demand from the United States, which was greatly expanding its own presence in the Asia-Pacific region, to establish diplomatic relations when Commodore James Biddle appeared in Edo Bay with two warships in July 1846.

===End of seclusion===

When Commodore Matthew C. Perry&#x27;s four-ship squadron appeared in Edo Bay in July 1853, the bakufu was thrown into turmoil. The chairman of the senior councillors, Abe Masahiro (1819–1857), was responsible for dealing with the Americans. Having no precedent to manage this threat to national security, Abe tried to balance the desires of the senior councillors to compromise with the foreigners, of the emperor who wanted to keep the foreigners out, and of the &quot;daimyo&quot; who wanted to go to war. Lacking consensus, Abe decided to compromise by accepting Perry&#x27;s demands for opening Japan to foreign trade while also making military preparations. In March 1854, the Treaty of Peace and Amity (or Treaty of Kanagawa) opened two ports to American ships seeking provisions, guaranteed good treatment to shipwrecked American sailors, and allowed a United States consul to take up residence in Shimoda, a seaport on the Izu Peninsula, southwest of Edo. The Treaty of Amity and Commerce Between the U.S. and Japan (Harris Treaty), opening still more areas to American trade, was forced on the &quot;bakufu&quot; five years later.

The resulting damage to the &quot;bakufu&quot; was significant. The devalued price for gold in Japan was one immediate, enormous effect. The European and American traders purchased gold for its original price on the world market and then sold it to the Japanese for triple the price. Along with this, cheap goods from these developed nations, like finished cotton, flooded the market forcing many Japanese out of business. Debate over government policy was unusual and had engendered public criticism of the &quot;bakufu&quot;. In the hope of enlisting the support of new allies, Abe, to the consternation of the &quot;fudai&quot;, had consulted with the &quot;shinpan&quot; and &quot;tozama daimyo&quot;, further undermining the already weakened &quot;bakufu&quot;. In the Ansei Reform (1854–1856), Abe then tried to strengthen the regime by ordering Dutch warships and armaments from the Netherlands and building new port defenses. In 1855, a naval training school with Dutch instructors was set up at Nagasaki, and a Western-style military school was established at Edo; by the next year, the government was translating Western books. Opposition to Abe increased within &quot;fudai&quot; circles, which opposed opening &quot;bakufu&quot; councils to &quot;tozama daimyo&quot;, and he was replaced in 1855 as chairman of the senior councilors by Hotta Masayoshi (1810–1864).

At the head of the dissident faction was Tokugawa Nariaki, who had long embraced a militant loyalty to the emperor along with anti-foreign sentiments, and who had been put in charge of national defense in 1854. The Mito school—based on neo-Confucian and Shinto principles—had as its goal the restoration of the imperial institution, the turning back of the West, and the founding of a world empire under the divine imperial house.

In the final years of the Tokugawas, foreign contacts increased as more concessions were granted. The new treaty with the United States in 1859 allowed more ports to be opened to diplomatic representatives, unsupervised trade at four additional ports, and foreign residences in Osaka and Edo. It also embodied the concept of extraterritoriality (foreigners were subject to the laws of their own countries but not to Japanese law). Hotta lost the support of key &quot;daimyo&quot;, and when Tokugawa Nariaki opposed the new treaty, Hotta sought imperial sanction. The court officials, perceiving the weakness of the &quot;bakufu&quot;, rejected Hotta&#x27;s request and thus suddenly embroiled Kyoto and the emperor in Japan&#x27;s internal politics for the first time in many centuries. When the &quot;shōgun&quot; died without an heir, Nariaki appealed to the court for support of his own son, Tokugawa Yoshinobu (or Keiki), for &quot;shōgun&quot;, a candidate favored by the &quot;shinpan&quot; and &quot;tozama daimyo&quot;. The &quot;fudai&quot; won the power struggle, however, installing Tokugawa Yoshitomi, arresting Nariaki and Keiki, executing Yoshida Shōin (1830–1859), a leading &quot;sonnō-jōi&quot; intellectual who had opposed the American treaty and plotted a revolution against the bakufu, and signing treaties with the United States and five other nations, thus ending more than 200 years of exclusion.

Recently some scholars have suggested that there were more events that spurred this opening of Japan. Yoshimune, eighth Tokugawa &quot;shōgun&quot; from 1716 to 1745, started the first Kyōhō reforms in an attempt to gain more revenue for the government. In 1767 to 1786 Tanuma Okitsugu also initiated some unorthodox economic reforms to expand government income. This led his conservative opponents to attack him and take his position as he was forced from government in disgrace. Similarly, Matsudaira Sadanobu launched the Kansei Reforms in 1787–1793 to stabilize rice prices, cut government costs, and increase revenues. The final economic reform of the Tenpō era of 1841–1843 had similar objectives. Most were ineffective and only worked in some areas. These economic failings would also have been a force in the opening of Japan, as Japanese businessmen desired larger markets. Some scholars also point to internal activism for political change. The Mito school had long been an active force in demanding political changes, such as restoring the powers of the Emperor. This anger can also be seen in the poetry of Matsuo Taseko (a woman who farmed silkworms in the Ina Valley) from Hirata Atsutane&#x27;s School of National Learning:
This inspired many anti-Tokugawa activists as they blamed the bakufu for impoverishing the people and dishonoring the emperor.
===Bakumatsu modernization and conflicts===
During the last years of the &quot;bakufu&quot;, or &quot;bakumatsu&quot;, the &quot;bakufu&quot; took strong measures to try to reassert its dominance, although its involvement with modernization and foreign powers was to make it a target of anti-Western sentiment throughout the country.

The army and the navy were modernized. A naval training school was established in Nagasaki in 1855. Naval students were sent to study in Western naval schools for several years, starting a tradition of foreign-educated future leaders, such as Admiral Enomoto. French naval engineers were hired to build naval arsenals, such as Yokosuka and Nagasaki. By the end of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1868, the Japanese navy of the &quot;shōgun&quot; already possessed eight Western-style steam warships around the flagship &quot;Kaiyō Maru&quot;, which were used against pro-imperial forces during the Boshin War under the command of Admiral Enomoto. A French military mission was established to help modernize the armies of the &quot;bakufu&quot;.Revering the emperor as a symbol of unity, extremists wrought violence and death against the Bakufu and Han authorities and foreigners. Foreign naval retaliation in the Anglo-Satsuma War led to still another concessionary commercial treaty in 1865, but Yoshitomi was unable to enforce the Western treaties. A &quot;bakufu&quot; army was defeated when it was sent to crush dissent in the Satsuma and Chōshū Domains in 1866. Finally, in 1867, Emperor Kōmei died and was succeeded by his underaged son Emperor Meiji.

Tokugawa Yoshinobu reluctantly became head of the Tokugawa house and &quot;shōgun&quot;. He tried to reorganize the government under the emperor while preserving the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s leadership role. Fearing the growing power of the Satsuma and Chōshū &quot;daimyo&quot;, other &quot;daimyo&quot; called for returning the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s political power to the emperor and a council of &quot;daimyo&quot; chaired by the former Tokugawa &quot;shōgun&quot;. Yoshinobu accepted the plan in late 1867 and resigned, announcing an &quot;imperial restoration&quot;. The Satsuma, Chōshū, and other &quot;han&quot; leaders and radical courtiers, however, rebelled, seized the imperial palace, and announced their own restoration on January 3, 1868.

Following the Boshin War (1868–1869), the &quot;bakufu&quot; was abolished, and Yoshinobu was reduced to the ranks of the common &quot;daimyo&quot;. Resistance continued in the North throughout 1868, and the &quot;bakufu&quot; naval forces under Admiral Enomoto Takeaki continued to hold out for another six months in Hokkaidō, where they founded the short-lived Republic of Ezo.

Although the Edo Period would soon end, Bushido values would continue to influence Japanese society long after the samurai ceased to exist.

The Edo Period would also have a lasting impact on modern art and culture. The Edo Period lives on in plays, books, anime, and especially jidaigeki (historical period dramas), such as the classic samurai films of Akira Kurosawa. Kurosawa&#x27;s films would influence Spaghetti Westerns, and even Star Wars.

<text>Janet Miriam Caldwell (September 7, 1900August 30, 1985) was a British-born American novelist and prolific author of popular fiction under the pen names Taylor Caldwell, Marcus Holland and Max Reiner. She was also known by a variation of her married name, J. Miriam Reback.

In her fiction, she often used real historical events or persons. Taylor Caldwell&#x27;s best-known works include &quot;Dynasty of Death&quot;, &quot;Dear and Glorious Physician&quot; (about Saint Luke), &quot;Ceremony of the Innocent&quot;, &quot;Pillar of Iron&quot; (about Cicero), &quot;The Earth is the Lord&#x27;s&quot; (about Genghis Khan) and &quot;Captains and the Kings&quot;. Her last major novel, &quot;Answer As a Man&quot;, appeared in 1980.

==Biography==

Janet Miriam Caldwell was born in Manchester, England, into a family of Scottish background. Her family descended from the Scottish clan of MacGregor of which the Taylors are a subsidiary clan. At the age of six, she won a medal for an essay on Charles Dickens.

In 1907, she emigrated to the United States with her parents, Arthur Frank Caldwell and Annie ( Marks) Caldwell, and her younger brother. Her father died shortly after the move, and the family struggled. At the age of eight she started to write stories, and in fact wrote her first novel, &quot;The Romance of Atlantis&quot;, at the age of twelve (although it remained unpublished until 1975). She continued to write prolifically, however, despite ill health.

In 1918–19, she served in the United States Navy Reserve. In 1919, she married William F. Combs. In 1920, they had a daughter, Mary Margaret (known as &quot;Peggy&quot;). From 1923 to 1924, Caldwell worked as a court reporter in the New York State Department of Labor in Buffalo, New York. In 1924, she went to work for the United States Department of Justice, as a member of the Board of Special Inquiry (an immigration tribunal) in Buffalo.

In 1931, she graduated from the University of Buffalo. She and Combs divorced in 1931. Caldwell then married her second husband, Marcus Reback, who worked for the US Immigration and Naturalization Service. She had a second child with Reback, a daughter Judith Ann, in 1932. The Rebacks were married for 40 years, until his death in 1970.

In 1934, she began to work on the novel &quot;Dynasty of Death&quot;, which she and Reback completed in collaboration. It was published in 1938 and became a best-seller. &quot;Taylor Caldwell&quot; was presumed to be a man, and there was some public stir when the author was revealed to be a woman. Over the next 43 years, she published 42 more novels, many of them best-sellers. For instance, &quot;This Side of Innocence&quot; was the biggest fiction seller of 1946, spending more than six months on the New York Times Fiction Best Seller list, including nine weeks at #1.

(In 1947, according to &quot;Time&quot;, her husband Marcus Reback discarded and burned the manuscripts of 140 unpublished novels.)

Her published works sold an estimated 30 million copies. She became wealthy, traveling to Europe and elsewhere, although she still lived near Buffalo.

Her books were big sellers right up to the end of her career. In 1979, she signed a two-novel deal for $3.9 million.

During her career as a writer, she received several awards:
* The National League of American Pen Women gold medal (1948)
* The &quot;Buffalo Evening News&quot; Award (1949)
* The &quot;Grand Prix Chatvain&quot; (1950)

She was an outspoken conservative and for a time wrote for the John Birch Society&#x27;s monthly journal &quot;American Opinion&quot; and even associated with the antisemitic Liberty Lobby. Caldwell was even involved in the founding of the New York Conservative Party.

Her memoir, &quot;On Growing Up Tough&quot;, appeared in 1971, consisting of many edited-down articles from &quot;American Opinion&quot;. Around 1970, she became interested in reincarnation. She had become friends with well-known occultist author Jess Stearn, who suggested that the vivid detail in her many historical novels was actually subconscious recollection of previous lives. She agreed to be hypnotized and undergo &quot;past life regression&quot; to disprove reincarnation. However, according to Stearn&#x27;s book, &quot;The Search for a Soul – Taylor Caldwell&#x27;s Psychic Lives&quot; (1973), Caldwell instead began to recall her own past lives – eleven in all, including one on the &quot;lost&quot; continent of Atlantis.

In 1972, she married William Everett Stancell, a retired real estate developer, but divorced him in 1973. In 1978, she married William Robert Prestie, a Canadian 17 years her junior. This led to difficulties with her children. She had a long dispute with her daughter Judith Goodman over the estate of Judith&#x27;s father. In 1979, Judith died by suicide at the age of 47.

Also in 1979, Caldwell suffered a stroke, which left her unable to speak, though she could still write (she had been deaf since about 1965). Her daughter Mary Margaret Fried accused Prestie of abusing and exploiting Caldwell, and there was a legal battle over her substantial assets.

==Death==

Taylor Caldwell died of pulmonary failure, secondary to lung cancer, in Greenwich, Connecticut on August 30, 1985, aged 84. She had suffered a stroke in May 1980 that had left her paralyzed and speechless.

== Writings ==

&quot;Dynasty of Death&quot; was her first published work, a family saga lasting from 1837 to World War I, about two families in western Pennsylvania who rise to control a great armaments business. The story was continued in &quot;The Eagles Gather&quot; (1940) and &quot;The Final Hour&quot; (1944).

As a writer Caldwell was praised for her intricately plotted and suspenseful stories, which depicted family tensions and the development of the U.S. from an agrarian society into the leading industrial state of the world. Caldwell&#x27;s heroes are self-made men of pronounced ethnic background, such as the German immigrants in &quot;The Strong City&quot; (1942) and &quot;The Balance Wheel&quot; (1951). Her themes are ethnic, religious and personal intolerance (&quot;The Wide House&quot;, 1945), the failure of parental discipline (&quot;Let Love Come Last&quot;, 1949) and the conflict between the desire for power and money and the human values of love and sense of family (&quot;Melissa&quot; (1948), &quot;A Prologue to Love&quot; (1962), and &quot;Bright Flows the River&quot; (1978).

In her later works, Caldwell explored the American Dream and wrote stories of the &quot;rags to riches&quot; course of life. Among these was her last great best-seller, &quot;Captains and the Kings&quot; (1972), which chronicles the rise to wealth of a poor Irish immigrant to America in the 1800s. &quot;Captains and the Kings&quot; was made into a television mini-series in 1976. Another was her last novel, &quot;Answer As a Man&quot; (1980). In 1952, she wrote &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot;, set in a dystopia where North America has become a Communist dictatorship.

She wrote many historical novels, including several about famous religious figures. &quot;Dear and Glorious Physician&quot; (1959) was about Saint Luke; &quot;Great Lion of God&quot; (1970) was about Saint Paul; and &quot;I, Judas&quot; (1977) was about Judas Iscariot.

In &quot;The Earth Is the Lord&#x27;s&quot; (1941), she fictionalized Genghis Khan; in &quot;The Arm and the Darkness&quot; (1943), Cardinal Richelieu; in &quot;A Pillar of Iron&quot; (1965), the Roman senator and orator Cicero; and in &quot;Glory and the Lightning&quot; (1974), Aspasia, mistress of the Athenian leader Pericles.

Caldwell addressed religious themes in several works. &quot;Answer As a Man&quot; begins with the church bells and ends with an evocation of renewed faith. &quot;Dialogues with the Devil&quot; (1967) is a correspondence between Lucifer and Michael the Archangel. Mixed into this dialogue are old tales, stories of a lost continent and of other worlds, and theological speculations.

== Social philosophy ==


The nature of human beings never changes; it is immutable. The present generation of children and the present generation of young adults from the age of thirteen to eighteen is, therefore, no different from that of their great-great-grandparents. Political fads come and go; theories rise and fall; the scientific &#x27;truth&#x27; of today becomes the discarded error of tomorrow. Man&#x27;s ideas change, but not his inherent nature. That remains. So, if the children are monstrous today – even criminal – it is not because their natures have become polluted, but because they have not been taught better, nor disciplined. – On Growing Up Tough, chapter The Purple Lodge
In her 1957 social/political article &quot;Honoria&quot; she chronicles the rise and fall of the fictitious country she calls &quot;Honoria&quot;. She ends the article with a very foreboding rebuke of society. &quot;It is a stern fact of history that no nation that rushed to the abyss ever turned back. Not ever, in the long history of the world. We are now on the edge of the abyss. Can we, for the first time in history, turn back? It is up to you.&quot;

Many of Caldwell&#x27;s books centered on the idea that a small cabal of rich, powerful men secretly control the world.

<doc id="164952" wikidata="Q181156" url="?curid=164952" title="Software design pattern">
<text>In software engineering, a software design pattern or design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in many contexts in software design. A design pattern is not a rigid structure to be transplanted directly into source code. Rather, it is a description or a template for solving a particular type of problem that can be deployed in many different situations. Design patterns can be viewed as formalized best practices that the programmer may use to solve common problems when designing a software application or system.

Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved. Patterns that imply mutable state may be unsuited for functional programming languages. Some patterns can be rendered unnecessary in languages that have built-in support for solving the problem they are trying to solve, and object-oriented patterns are not necessarily suitable for non-object-oriented languages.

Design patterns may be viewed as a structured approach to computer programming intermediate between the levels of a programming paradigm and a concrete algorithm.

==History==

Patterns originated as an architectural concept by Christopher Alexander as early as 1977 in A Pattern Language (c.f. his article, &quot;The Pattern of Streets,&quot; JOURNAL OF THE AIP, September, 1966, Vol. 32, No. 5, pp. 273–278). In 1987, Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham began experimenting with the idea of applying patterns to programming – specifically pattern languages – and presented their results at the OOPSLA conference that year. In the following years, Beck, Cunningham and others followed up on this work.

Design patterns gained popularity in computer science after the book &quot;Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software&quot; was published in 1994 by the so-called &quot;Gang of Four&quot; (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides), which is frequently abbreviated as &quot;GoF&quot;. That same year, the first Pattern Languages of Programming Conference was held, and the following year the Portland Pattern Repository was set up for documentation of design patterns. The scope of the term remains a matter of dispute. Notable books in the design pattern genre include:
* 
* 
* 
* 

Although design patterns have been applied practically for a long time, formalization of the concept of design patterns languished for several years.

== Practice ==

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing proven development paradigms. Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become apparent until later in the implementation. Freshly written code can often have hidden, subtle issues that take time to be detected; issues that sometimes can cause major problems down the road. Reusing design patterns can help to prevent such issues, and enhance code readability for those familiar with the patterns.

Software design techniques are difficult to apply to a broader range of problems. Design patterns provide general solutions, documented in a format that does not require specifics tied to a particular problem.

In 1996, Christopher Alexander was invited to give a Keynote Speech to the 1996 OOPSLA Convention. Here he reflected on how his work on Patterns in Architecture had developed and his hopes for how the Software Design community could help Architecture extend Patterns to create living structures that use generative schemes that are more like computer code.

==Motif==

A pattern describes a &quot;design motif&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;prototypical micro-architecture&quot;, as a set of program constituents (e.g., classes, methods...) and their relationships. A developer adapts the motif to their codebase to solve the problem described by the pattern. The resulting code has structure and organization similar to the chosen motif.

==Domain-specific patterns==

Efforts have also been made to codify design patterns in particular domains, including the use of existing design patterns as well as domain-specific design patterns. Examples include user interface design patterns, information visualization, secure design, &quot;secure usability&quot;, Web design and business model design.

The annual Pattern Languages of Programming Conference proceedings include many examples of domain-specific patterns.

== Object-oriented programming ==

Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved. Patterns that imply mutable state may be unsuited for functional programming languages. Some patterns can be rendered unnecessary in languages that have built-in support for solving the problem they are trying to solve, and object-oriented patterns are not necessarily suitable for non-object-oriented languages.

==Examples==
Design patterns can be organized into groups based on what kind of problem they solve. Creational patterns create objects. Structural patterns organize classes and objects to form larger structures that provide new functionality. Behavioral patterns provide communication between objects and realizing these patterns.

=== Creational patterns ===
=== Structural patterns ===
=== Behavioral patterns ===
=== Concurrency patterns ===
==Documentation==
The documentation for a design pattern describes the context in which the pattern is used, the forces within the context that the pattern seeks to resolve, and the suggested solution. There is no single, standard format for documenting design patterns. Rather, a variety of different formats have been used by different pattern authors. However, according to Martin Fowler, certain pattern forms have become more well-known than others, and consequently become common starting points for new pattern-writing efforts. One example of a commonly used documentation format is the one used by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides in their book &quot;Design Patterns&quot;. It contains the following sections:

*Pattern Name and Classification: A descriptive and unique name that helps in identifying and referring to the pattern.
*Intent: A description of the goal behind the pattern and the reason for using it.
*Also Known As: Other names for the pattern.
*Motivation (Forces): A scenario consisting of a problem and a context in which this pattern can be used.
*Applicability: Situations in which this pattern is usable; the context for the pattern.
*Structure: A graphical representation of the pattern. Class diagrams and Interaction diagrams may be used for this purpose.
*Participants: A listing of the classes and objects used in the pattern and their roles in the design.
*Collaboration: A description of how classes and objects used in the pattern interact with each other.
*Consequences: A description of the results, side effects, and trade offs caused by using the pattern.
*Implementation: A description of an implementation of the pattern; the solution part of the pattern.
*Sample Code: An illustration of how the pattern can be used in a programming language.
*Known Uses: Examples of real usages of the pattern.
*Related Patterns: Other patterns that have some relationship with the pattern; discussion of the differences between the pattern and similar patterns.

==Criticism==

Some suggest that design patterns may be a sign that features are missing in a given programming language (Java or C++ for instance). Peter Norvig demonstrates that 16 out of the 23 patterns in the &quot;Design Patterns&quot; book (which is primarily focused on C++) are simplified or eliminated (via direct language support) in Lisp or Dylan. Related observations were made by Hannemann and Kiczales who implemented several of the 23 design patterns using an aspect-oriented programming language (AspectJ) and showed that code-level dependencies were removed from the implementations of 17 of the 23 design patterns and that aspect-oriented programming could simplify the implementations of design patterns.

Inappropriate use of patterns may unnecessarily increase complexity. FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition offers a humorous example of over-complexity introduced by design patterns.

By definition, a pattern must be programmed anew into each application that uses it. Since some authors see this as a step backward from software reuse as provided by components, researchers have worked to turn patterns into components. Meyer and Arnout were able to provide full or partial componentization of two-thirds of the patterns they attempted.

In order to achieve flexibility, design patterns may introduce additional levels of indirection, which may complicate the resulting design and decrease runtime performance.
== Relationship to other topics ==
Software design patterns offer finer granularity compared to software architecture patterns and software architecture styles, as design patterns focus on solving detailed, low-level design problems within individual components or subsystems. Examples include Singleton, Factory Method, and Observer. 

Software Architecture Pattern refers to a reusable, proven solution to a recurring problem at the system level, addressing concerns related to the overall structure, component interactions, and quality attributes of the system. Software architecture patterns operate at a higher level of abstraction than design patterns, solving broader system-level challenges. While these patterns typically affect system-level concerns, the distinction between architectural patterns and architectural styles can sometimes be blurry. Examples include Circuit Breaker. 

Software Architecture Style refers to a high-level structural organization that defines the overall system organization, specifying how components are organized, how they interact, and the constraints on those interactions. Architecture styles typically include a vocabulary of component and connector types, as well as semantic models for interpreting the system&#x27;s properties. These styles represent the most coarse-grained level of system organization. Examples include Layered Architecture, Microservices, and Event-Driven Architecture.

<text>A purity test is a self-graded survey that assesses the participants&#x27; supposed degree of innocence in worldly matters (sex, drugs, deceit, and other activities assumed to be vices), generally on a percentage scale with 100% being the most and 0% being the least pure. Online purity tests were among the earliest of Internet memes, popular on Usenet beginning in the early 1980s. However, similar types of tests circulated under various names long before the existence of the Internet.

==Historical examples==
The &quot;Rice Thresher&quot; student newspaper in 1924 published the results of an informal ten-question survey of 119 female undergraduate students at Rice University, with questions like &quot;Have you ever been drunk?&quot;, &quot;Did you ever dance conspicuously?&quot;, and &quot;Have you ever done anything that you wouldn&#x27;t tell your mother?&quot; The test has periodically been revisited and revised by the Thresher, usually on its satirical &quot;Backpage,&quot; with expanded lists of questions that students can take and score on their own, starting with a list of 100 questions in 1988. An official website was created for the 2012 edition by the newspaper staff.

The Columbia University humor magazine, &quot;The Jester&quot;, reported in its October 1935 issue on a campus wide &quot;purity test&quot; conducted at Barnard College in 1935. The issue of &quot;The Jester&quot; was briefly censored, with distribution curtailed until the director of activities at the university could review the article. According to the editor-in-chief of &quot;The Jester&quot;, &quot;We printed the survey to clear up some of the misconceptions that Columbia and the outside world have about Barnard girls,&quot; he said. &quot;The results seem to establish that Barnard girls are quite regular. I fail to see anything off-color in the story. It&#x27;s a sociological study.&quot;

In 1936, &quot;The Indian Express&quot; reported that students at Toronto University were &quot;under-going a &#x27;purity test&#x27;, which took &quot;the form of twenty very personal questions, designed to determine the state of their morals and their &#x27;purity ratio&#x27;. For example, so many marks are lost for smoking, drinking, and every time the sinner kisses a girl or boy. Then, after truthfully answering all the questions, the total number of bad marks are added up and subtracted from a hundred. What is left, if any, is the &#x27;purity ratio&#x27;. The test is unofficial and just what it will prove when completed nobody knows.&quot;

Alan Dundes, a professor of anthropology and folklore at the University of California, Berkeley, and Carl R. Pagter included examples of purity tests in their 1975 book &quot;Work Hard and You Shall Be Rewarded: Urban Folklore from the Paperwork Empire&quot;. They noted, &quot;An indication of the particular sexual activities that are valued is provided by various versions of a questionnaire parody entitled &#x27;Virtue Test&#x27; or &#x27;Official Purity Test&#x27; or the like. It is obviously doubtful whether anyone would answer the questions posed on the test in an honest and truthful fashion. Nevertheless, the questions themselves serve to reveal a good deal about the American male&#x27;s sexual fantasy life.&quot; Dundes and Pagter&#x27;s book reprints a &quot;Virtue Test&quot; circulated at Indiana University in 1939 and a more contemporary &quot;Official Purity Test&quot; circulated at California Institute of Technology.

In 1976, a teacher at La Grange High School in Texas was fired for distributing a 1966 purity test, which had appeared in the Ask Ann Landers column, to her students. The questions on the test ranged from &quot;Ever said &#x27;I love you&#x27;?&quot; to &quot;Ever had group sex?&quot; The teacher sued the school district and was awarded $71,000 in back pay and damages.

==Description==

Most purity tests have possible scores anywhere from 0% to 100%. Purity tests ask numerous personal questions of their users, most commonly about the use of alcohol and illicit substances; sexual acts with members of the opposite or same-sex; other illicit or illegal activities, and the above actions in an odd or &quot;kinky&quot; context. These tests typically have anywhere from 50 to 2000 questions.

Many popular purity tests encourage participation in a social situation (one person reading a purity test aloud while others mark down their &quot;yeses&quot; for later ). The tests often acknowledge that some may use them as a checklist for things to do, try, or accomplish.

One test is The Unisex Purity Test (or, simply, the Purity Test). First written before 1980 in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Baker House, the first incarnation had two parallel versions, 100 questions each; one for male, and one for female. The next iteration (247 questions, written at Carnegie Mellon University in 1983) heralded the merging of the gendered versions, making it unisex. Over the next decade or so, many re-writes and expansions commenced, a 2000-question version being written in 1995.

<text>Food coloring, color additive or colorant is any dye, pigment, or substance that imparts color when it is added to food or beverages. Colorants can be supplied as liquids, powders, gels, or pastes. Food coloring is commonly used in commercial products and in domestic cooking.

Food colorants are also used in various non-food applications, including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, home craft projects, and medical devices. Some colorings may be natural, such as with carotenoids and anthocyanins extracted from plants or cochineal from insects, or may be synthesized, such as tartrazine yellow.

In the manufacturing of foods, beverages and cosmetics, the safety of colorants is under constant scientific review and certification by national regulatory agencies, such as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and by international reviewers, such as the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives.

==Purpose of food coloring==

People associate certain colors with certain flavors, and the color of food can influence the perceived flavor in anything from candy to wine. Sometimes, the aim is to simulate a color that is perceived by the consumer as natural, such as adding red coloring to glacé cherries (which would otherwise be beige), but sometimes it is for effect, like the green ketchup that Heinz launched in 2000. Color additives are used in foods for many reasons including:
* To make food more attractive, appealing, appetizing, and informative
* Offsetting color loss over time due to exposure to light, air, temperature extremes, moisture and storage conditions
* Correcting natural variations in color
* Enhancing colors that occur naturally
* Providing color to colorless and &quot;fun&quot; foods
* Allowing products to be identified at sight, like candy flavors or medicine dosages

==Natural food dyes==
===History===
The addition of colorants to foods is thought to have occurred in Egyptian cities as early as 1500 BC, when candy makers added natural extracts and wine to improve the products&#x27; appearance. During the Middle Ages, the economy in the European countries was based on agriculture, and the peasants were accustomed to producing their own food locally or trading within the village communities. Under feudalism, aesthetic aspects were not considered, at least not by the vast majority of the generally very poor population. This situation changed with urbanization at the beginning of the Modern Age, when trade emerged—especially the import of precious spices and colors. One of the first food laws, created in Augsburg, Germany, in 1531, concerned spices or colorants and required saffron counterfeiters to be burned to death.

===Natural colorants===
Carotenoids (E160, E161, E164), chlorophyllin (E140, E141), anthocyanins (E163), and betanin (E162) comprise four main categories of plant pigments grown to color food products. Other colorants or specialized derivatives of these core groups include:
* Annatto (E160b), a reddish-orange dye made from the seed of the achiote
* Caramel coloring (E150a-d), made from caramelized sugar
* Carmine (E120), a red dye derived from the cochineal insect, &quot;Dactylopius coccus&quot;
* Elderberry juice (E163)
* Lycopene (E160d)
* Paprika (E160c)
* Turmeric/curcumin (E100)

Blue colors are rare. The pigment genipin, present in the fruit of &quot;Gardenia jasminoides&quot;, can be treated with amino acids to produce the blue pigment gardenia blue, which is approved for use in Japan, but not the EU or the US.

To ensure reproducibility, the colored components of these substances are often provided in highly purified form. For stability and convenience, they can be formulated in suitable carrier materials (solid and liquids). Hexane, acetone, and other solvents break down cell walls in the fruit and vegetables and allow for maximum extraction of the coloring. Traces of these may still remain in the finished colorant, but they do not need to be declared on the product label. These solvents are known as carry-over ingredients.

===Chemical structures of representative natural colorants===
==Artificial food colorants==
===History===
With the onset of the industrial revolution, people became dependent on foods produced by others. These new urban dwellers demanded food at low cost. Analytical chemistry was still primitive and regulations few. The adulteration of foods flourished. Heavy metal and other inorganic element-containing compounds turned out to be cheap and suitable to &quot;restore&quot; the color of watered-down milk and other foodstuffs, some more lurid examples being:
* Red lead (Pb3O4) and vermillion (HgS) were routinely used to color cheese and confectionery.
* Copper arsenite (CuHAsO3) was used to recolor used tea leaves for resale. It also caused two deaths when used to color a dessert in 1860.

Sellers at the time offered more than 80 artificial coloring agents, some invented for dyeing textiles, not foods. Many color additives had never been tested for toxicity or other adverse effects. Historical records show that injuries, even deaths, resulted from tainted colorants. In 1851, about 200 people were poisoned in England, 17 of them fatally, directly as a result of eating adulterated lozenges. In 1856, mauveine, the first synthetic color, was developed by Sir William Henry Perkin and by the turn of the century, unmonitored color additives had spread through Europe and the United States in all sorts of popular foods, including ketchup, mustard, jellies, and wine. Originally, these were dubbed &#x27;coal-tar&#x27; colors because the starting materials were obtained from bituminous coal.

Synthetic dyes are often less costly and technically superior to natural dyes.

===Chemical structures of representative artificial colorants===
==Regulation==

===History: 19th and 20th centuries===
Concerns over food safety led to numerous regulations throughout the world. German food regulations released in 1882 stipulated the exclusion of dangerous &quot;minerals&quot; such as arsenic, copper, chromium, lead, mercury, and zinc, which were frequently used as ingredients in colorants. In contrast to today&#x27;s regulatory guidelines, these first laws followed the principle of a negative listing (substances not allowed for use); they were already driven by the main principles of today&#x27;s food regulations all over the world, since all of these regulations follow the same goal: the protection of consumers from toxic substances and from fraud. In the United States, the reduced the permitted list of synthetic colors from 700 down to seven. The seven dyes initially approved were Ponceau 3R (FD&amp;C Red No. 1), amaranth (FD&amp;C Red No. 2), erythrosine (FD&amp;C Red No. 3), indigotine (FD&amp;C Blue No. 2), light green SF (FD&amp;C Green No. 2), naphthol yellow 1 (FD&amp;C Yellow No. 1), and orange 1 (FD&amp;C Orange No. 1). Even with updated food laws, adulteration continued for many years.

In the 20th century, improved chemical analysis and testing led to the replacement of the negative lists by positive listings. Positive lists consist of substances allowed to be used for the production and the improvement of foods. Most prevailing legislations are based on positive listing. Positive listing implies that substances meant for human consumption have been tested for their safety, and that they have to meet specified purity criteria prior to their approval by the corresponding authorities. In 1962, the first EU directive (62/2645/EEC) approved 36 colorants, of which 20 were naturally derived and 16 were synthetic. This directive did not list which food products the colorants could or could not be used in. At that time, each member state could designate where certain colors could and could not be used. In Germany, for example, quinoline yellow was allowed in puddings and desserts, but tartrazine was not. The reverse was true in France. This was updated in 1989 with 89/107/EEC, which concerned food additives authorized for use in foodstuffs.

===Status as of 2024===
Naturally derived colors, most of which have been used traditionally for centuries, are exempt from certification by several regulatory bodies throughout the world, such as the FDA. Included in the exempt category are colors or pigments from vegetables, minerals, or animals, such as annatto extract (yellow), beets (purple), beta-carotene (yellow to orange), and grape skin extract (purple).

Synthetic food colorings are typically less expensive to manufacture, but require closer scientific scrutiny for safety and are certified for use in food manufacturing in the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union.

===Global market===
The global market for food coloring is anticipated to grow from $4.6 billion in 2023 to $6 billion by 2028. This expansion is primarily driven by increasing consumer demand for visually appealing food products. Home chefs, particularly those active on social media, are seeking vibrant colors to enhance the aesthetic appeal of their homemade snacks and treats. Additionally, large food brands incorporate vivid colors into their products to stand out in a competitive market.

While the demand for food coloring is rising, there are growing concerns about its potential health implications. Some localities, such as California, have implemented regulations restricting certain artificial dyes due to concerns about their impact on children&#x27;s behavior.

===National regulations===

====Canada====
Canada has published food and drug regulations covering food colorants.

Food in Canada cannot be sold with more than:

* 100 ppm of fast green FCF or brilliant blue FCF. or any combination
* 300 ppm of allura red, amaranth, erythrosine, indigotine, sunset yellow FCF or tartrazine and Fast Green FCF or brilliant blue FCF combined
* 150 ppm of ponceau SX dye.

====European Union====
In the European Union, E numbers are used for all additives, both synthetic and natural, that are approved in food applications. E numbers beginning with 1, such as E100 (turmeric) or E161b (lutein), are allocated to colorants. The safety of food colors and other food additives in the EU is evaluated by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Color Directive 94/36/EC, enacted by the European Commission in 1994, outlines permitted natural and artificial colors with their approved applications and limits in different foodstuffs. This is binding on all member countries of the EU; any changes have to be implemented into national laws by a specified deadline. In non-EU member states, food additives are regulated by national authorities, which usually, but not always, try to harmonize with EU regulations. Most other countries have their own regulations and list of food colors which can be used in various applications, including maximum daily intake limits.

Permitted synthetic colorants in the EU include E numbers 102–143 which cover the range of artificial colors. The EU maintains a list of currently allowed additives. Some artificial dyes approved for food use in the EU include:

* E104: Quinoline yellow
* E122: Carmoisine
* E124: Ponceau 4R
* E131: Patent blue V
* E142: Green S

The three synthetic colors Orange B, Citrus Red No. 2 and FD&amp;C Green No. 3 are not permitted in the EU, and neither is the natural toasted partially defatted cooked cottonseed flour.

====India====
The Food Safety and Standard Act, 2006 in India generally permits eight artificial colorings in food:

====United States====
The FDA permitted colors are classified as subject to certification or exempt from certification in Code of Federal Regulations – Title 21 Part 73 &amp; 74, both of which are subject to rigorous safety standards prior to their approval and listing for use in foods.

In the United States, FD&amp;C numbers (which indicate that the FDA has approved the colorant for use in foods, drugs and cosmetics) are given to approved synthetic food dyes that do not exist in nature.

Permitted synthetic colorants include the following seven artificial colorings (the most common in bold). The lakes of these colorings are also permitted except the lake of Red No. 3.
* FD&amp;C Blue No. 1 – Brilliant blue FCF, E133 (blue shade)
* FD&amp;C Blue No. 2 – Indigotine, E132 (indigo shade)
* FD&amp;C Green No. 3 – Fast green FCF, E143 (turquoise shade)
* FD&amp;C Red No. 3 – Erythrosine, E127 (pink shade, commonly used in glacé cherries)
* FD&amp;C Red No. 40 – Allura red AC, E129 (red shade)
* FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 – Tartrazine, E102 (yellow shade)
* FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6 – Sunset yellow FCF, E110 (orange shade)

Two dyes are allowed by the FDA for limited applications:

* Citrus red 2 (orange shade) – allowed only to color orange peels.
* Orange B (red shade) – allowed only for use in hot dog and sausage casings (not produced after 1978, but not delisted)

Many dyes have been delisted for a variety of reasons, ranging from poor coloring properties to regulatory restrictions. Some of these delisted food colorants are:

* FD&amp;C Red No. 2 – Amaranth, E123
* FD&amp;C Red No. 4 – Scarlet GN, E125
* FD&amp;C Red No. 32 was used to color Florida oranges.
* FD&amp;C Orange Number 1 was one of the first water-soluble dyes to be commercialized, and one of seven original food dyes allowed under the Pure Food and Drug Act of June 30, 1906.
* FD&amp;C Orange No. 2 was used to color Florida oranges.
* FD&amp;C Yellow No. 1, 2, 3, and 4
* FD&amp;C Violet No. 1

===Global harmonization===
Since the beginning of the 1960s, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives has promoted the development of international standards for food additives, not only by its toxicological assessments, which are continuously published by the World Health Organization in a &quot;Technical Report Series&quot;, but furthermore by elaborating appropriate purity criteria, which are laid down in the two volumes of the &quot;Compendium of Food Additive Specifications&quot; and their supplements. These specifications are not legally binding but very often serve as a guiding principle, especially in countries where no scientific expert committees have been established.

To further regulate the use of these evaluated additives, in 1962 the WHO and FAO created an international commission, the Codex Alimentarius, which is composed of authorities, food industry associations and consumer groups from all over the world. Within the Codex organization, the Codex Committee for Food Additives and Contaminants is responsible for working out recommendations for the application of food additives: the General Standard for Food Additives. In the light of the World Trade Organizations General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the Codex Standard, although not legally binding, influences food color regulations all over the world.

===Safety evaluation===
A 2023 update by the FDA on food colorants required safety assurances by manufacturers and restrictions on the types of foods in which colorants are used, their maximum amounts and labeling, batch certification, and the amount needed to attain the desired food coloring. Scientific consensus regards that food color additives are safe under the restrictions for use, and that most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods with color ingredients; some individual studies, however, indicate that certain children may have allergic sensitivities to colorants. In October 2023, the state of California banned the colorant, Red 3, in food products starting in 2027.

In the 20th century, widespread public belief that artificial food coloring causes ADHD-like hyperactivity in children originated from Benjamin Feingold, a pediatric allergist from California, who proposed in 1973 that salicylates, artificial colors, and artificial flavors cause hyperactivity in children. However, there is no clinical evidence to support broad claims that food coloring causes food intolerance and ADHD-like behavior in children. It is possible that certain food colorings may act as a trigger in those who are genetically predisposed.

Concerns were expressed again in 2011 that food colorings may cause ADHD-like behavior in children; a 2015 literature review found the evidence inconclusive. The UK Food Standards Agency examined the effects of tartrazine, allura red, ponceau 4R, quinoline yellow, sunset yellow and carmoisine on children. These colorants are found in beverages. The study found &quot;a possible link between the consumption of these artificial colours and a sodium benzoate preservative and increased hyperactivity&quot; in the children; the advisory committee to the FSA that evaluated the study also determined that because of study limitations, the results could not be extrapolated to the general population, and further testing was recommended. After continuous review as of 2024, the FSA stated that the above artificial food colors may induce hyperactivity in some children. Food and drink products containing any of the six designated colors must warn consumers on the package labels, stating &quot;May have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children&quot;.

The European regulatory community, with an emphasis on the precautionary principle, required labeling and temporarily reduced the acceptable daily intake for the food colorings; the UK FSA called for voluntary withdrawal of the colorings by food manufacturers. However, in 2009, the European Food Safety Authority re-evaluated the data at hand and determined that &quot;the available scientific evidence does not substantiate a link between the color additives and behavioral effects&quot; for any of the dyes.

===Titanium dioxide===
In 2016, EFSA updated its safety assessment of titanium dioxide (E 171), concluding that it can no longer be considered safe as a food additive. As of 2024, the FDA was evaluating a petition to exclude titanium dioxide from use in foods, beverages or cosmetics in the United States.

<text>Jan or Johannes Swammerdam (February 12, 1637 – February 17, 1680) was a Dutch biologist and microscopist. His work on insects demonstrated that the various phases during the life of an insect—egg, larva, pupa, and adult—are different forms of the same animal. As part of his anatomical research, he carried out experiments on muscle contraction. In 1658, he was the first to observe and describe red blood cells. He was one of the first people to use the microscope in dissections, and his techniques remained useful for hundreds of years.

==Education==

Johannes Swammerdam was baptized on 15 February 1637 in the Oude Kerk Amsterdam. His father Jan (or Johannes) Jacobsz (-1678) was an apothecary and an amateur collector of minerals, coins, fossils, and insects from around the world. In 1632 he married Baartje Jans (-1660) in Weesp. The couple lived across the Montelbaanstoren, near the harbour, the headquarter and the warehouses of the Dutch West India Company where an uncle worked. Some of their children were buried in the Walloon church, likewise Jan himself (who never married) and his father.

As a youngster, Swammerdam had helped his father to take care of his curiosity collection. Despite his father&#x27;s wish that he should study theology Swammerdam started to study medicine in 1661 at the University of Leiden. He studied under the guidance of Johannes van Horne and Franciscus Sylvius. Among his fellow students were Frederik Ruysch, Reinier de Graaf, Ole Borch, Theodor Kerckring, Steven Blankaart, Burchard de Volder, Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus and Niels Stensen. While studying medicine Swammerdam started his own collection of insects.

In 1663 Swammerdam moved to France to continue his studies. It seems together with Steno. He studied for one year at the Protestant University of Saumur, under the guidance of Tanaquil Faber. Subsequently, he studied in Paris at the scientific academy of Melchisédech Thévenot. 1665 he returned to the Dutch Republic and joined a group of physicians who performed dissections and published their findings. Between 1666 and 1667 Swammerdam concluded his study of medicine at the University of Leiden; he received his doctorate in medicine in 1667 under van Horne for his dissertation on the mechanism of respiration, published under the title &quot;De respiratione usuque pulmonum&quot;.

Together with van Horne, he researched the anatomy of the uterus. The result of this research was published under the title &quot;Miraculum naturae sive uteri muliebris fabrica&quot; in 1672. Swammerdam accused Reinier de Graaf of taking credit of discoveries he and Van Horne had made earlier regarding the importance of the ovary and its eggs.
He used waxen injection techniques and a single-lens microscope made by Johannes Hudde.

== Research into insects ==
While studying medicine Swammerdam had started to dissect insects and after qualifying as a doctor, he focused on them. His father pressured him to earn a living, but Swammerdam persevered and in late 1669 published &quot;Historia insectorum generalis ofte Algemeene verhandeling van de bloedeloose dierkens&quot; (&quot;The General History of Insects, or General Treatise on little Bloodless Animals&quot;). The treatise summarised his study of insects he had collected in France and around Amsterdam. He countered the prevailing Aristotelian notion that insects were imperfect animals that lacked internal anatomy. Following the publication his father withdrew all financial support. As a result, Swammerdam was forced, at least occasionally, to practice medicine in order to finance his own research. He obtained leave at Amsterdam to dissect the bodies of those who died in the hospital.

At university Swammerdam engaged deeply in the religious and philosophical ideas of his time. He categorically opposed the ideas behind spontaneous generation, which held that God had created some creatures, but not insects. Swammerdam argued that this would blasphemously imply that parts of the universe were excluded from God&#x27;s will. In his scientific study, Swammerdam tried to prove that God&#x27;s creation happened time after time, and that it was uniform and stable. Swammerdam was much influenced by René Descartes, whose natural philosophy had been widely adopted by Dutch intellectuals. In &quot;Discours de la Methode&quot; Descartes had argued that nature was orderly and obeyed fixed laws, thus nature could be explained rationally.

Swammerdam was convinced that the creation, or generation, of all creatures obeyed the same laws. Having studied the reproductive organs of men and women at university he set out to study the generation of insects. He had devoted himself to studying insects after discovering that the bee was indeed a queen bee. Swammerdam knew this because he had found eggs inside the creature. But he did not publish this finding. Swammerdam corresponded with Matthew Slade and Paolo Boccone and was visited by Willem Piso, Nicolaas Tulp and Nicolaas Witsen. He showed Cosimo III de&#x27; Medici, accompanied by Thévenot, another revolutionary discovery. Inside a caterpillar the limbs and wings of the butterfly could be seen (now called the imaginal discs).

When Swammerdam published &quot;The General History of Insects, or General Treatise on little Bloodless Animals&quot; later that year he not only did away with the idea that insects lacked internal anatomy but also attacked the Christian notion that insects originated from spontaneous generation and that their life cycle was a metamorphosis. Swammerdam maintained that all insects originated from eggs and their limbs grew and developed slowly. Thus there was no distinction between insects and so-called &quot;higher animals&quot;. Swammerdam declared war on &quot;vulgar errors&quot; and the symbolic interpretation of insects was, in his mind, incompatible with the power of God, the almighty architect.
Swammerdam, therefore, dispelled the seventeenth-century notion of metamorphosis —the idea that different life stages of an insect (e.g. caterpillar and butterfly) represent different individuals or a sudden change from one type of animal to another.
==Spirituality==
Swammerdam suffered a crisis of conscience; his father repudiated the study of insects. Having believed that his scientific research was a tribute to the Creator, he started to fear that he may be worshipping the idol of curiosities. In 1673 Swammerdam briefly fell under the influence of the Flemish mystic Antoinette Bourignon. His 1675 treatise on the mayfly, entitled &quot;Ephemeri vita&quot;, included devout poetry and documented his religious experiences. Swammerdam found comfort in the arms of Bourignon&#x27;s sect in Nordstrand, Germany. Swammerdam traveled to Copenhagen to visit the mother of Nicolaus Steno, but was back in Amsterdam in early 1676. In a letter to Henry Oldenburg, he explained &quot;I was never at any time busier than in these days, and the chief of all architects has blessed my endeavors&quot;.

== &quot;Bybel der natuure&quot; ==

His religious crisis only interrupted his scientific research briefly and until his premature death aged 43, he worked on what was to become his main work. It remained unpublished when he died in 1680 and was published as &quot;Bybel der natuure&quot; posthumously in 1737 by the Leiden University professor Herman Boerhaave. Convinced that all insects were worth studying, Swammerdam had compiled an epic treatise on as many insects as he could, using the microscope and dissection. Inspired by Marcello Malpighi, in &quot;De Bombyce&quot; Swammerdam described the anatomy of silkworms, mayflies, ants, stag beetles, cheese mites, bees and many other insects. His scientific observations were infused by his belief in God, the almighty creator. Swammerdam&#x27;s praise of the louse went on to become a classic:

Herewith I offer you the Omnipotent Finger of God in the anatomy of a louse: wherein you will find miracle heaped on miracle and see the wisdom of God clearly manifested in a minute point. 

===Research on bees===
Since ancient times it had been asserted that the queen bee was male, and ruled the hive. In 1586 Luis Mendez de Torres had first published the finding that the hive was ruled by a female, but Torres had maintained that she produced all other bees in the colony through a &quot;seed&quot;. In 1609 Charles Butler had recorded the sex of drones as male, but he wrongly believed that they mated with worker bees. In &quot;Biblia naturae&quot; the first visual proof was published that his contemporaries had mistakenly identified the queen bee as male. Swammerdam also provided evidence that the queen bee is the sole mother of the colony. 

Swammerdam had engaged in five intense years of beekeeping. He had found that drones were masculine, and had no stinger. Swammerdam identified the worker bees as &quot;natural eunuchs&quot; because he was unable to detect ovaries in them, but described them as nearer to the nature of the female. Swammerdam had produced a drawing of the queen bee&#x27;s reproductive organs, as observed through the microscope. The drawing Swammerdam produced of the internal anatomy of the queen bee was only published in 1737. His drawing of the honeycomb geometry was first published in &quot;Biblia naturae&quot;, but had been referenced by Giacomo Filippo Maraldi in his 1712 book. Details of Swammerdam&#x27;s research on bees had already been published elsewhere because he had shared his findings with other scientists in correspondence. Among others, Swammerdam&#x27;s research had been referenced by Nicolas Malebranche in 1688.

===Research on muscles===

In &quot;Biblia naturae&quot; Swammerdam&#x27;s research on muscles was published. Swammerdam played a key role in the debunking of the balloonist theory, the idea that &#x27;moving spirits&#x27; are responsible for muscle contractions. The idea, supported by the Greek physician Galen, held that nerves were hollow and the movement of spirits through them propelled muscle motion. René Descartes furthered the idea by basing it on a model of hydraulics, suggesting that the spirits were analogous to fluids or gasses and calling them &#x27;animal spirits&#x27;. In the model, which Descartes used to explain reflexes, the spirits would flow from the ventricles of the brain, through the nerves, and to the muscles to animate the latter. According to this hypothesis, muscles would grow larger when they contract because of the animal spirits flowing into them. To test this idea, Swammerdam placed severed frog thigh muscle in an airtight syringe with a small amount of water in the tip. He could thus determine whether there was a change in the volume of the muscle when it contracted by observing a change in the level of the water (image at right). When Swammerdam caused the muscle to contract by irritating the nerve, the water level did not rise but rather was lowered by a minute amount; this showed that no air or fluid could be flowing into the muscle. The idea that nerve stimulation led to the movement had important implications for neuroscience by putting forward the idea that behavior is based on stimuli.

Swammerdam&#x27;s research had been referenced before its publication by Nicolas Steno, who had visited Swammerdam in Amsterdam. Swammerdam&#x27;s research concluded after Steno had published the second edition of &quot;Elements of Myology&quot; in 1669, which is referenced in &quot;Biblia naturae&quot;. A letter from Steno to Malpighi from 1675 suggests that Swammerdam&#x27;s findings on muscle contraction had caused his crisis of consciousness. Steno sent Malpighi the drawings Swammerdam had done of the experiments, saying &quot;when he had written a treatise on this matter he destroyed it and he has only preserved these figures. He is seeking God, but not yet in the Church of God.&quot;

==Legacy==

Together with his father he collected 6,000 objects in 27 drawer cabinets. Swammerdam&#x27;s &quot;Historia insectorum generalis&quot; was widely known and applauded before he died. Two years after his death in 1680 it was translated into French and in 1685 it was translated into Latin. John Ray, author of the 1705 &quot;Historia insectorum&quot;, praised Swammerdam&#x27; methods, they were &quot;the best of all&quot;. Though Swammerdam&#x27;s work on insects and anatomy was significant, many current histories remember him as much for his methods and skill with microscopes as for his discoveries. He developed new techniques for examining, preserving, and dissecting specimens, including wax injection to make viewing blood vessels easier. A method he invented for the preparation of hollow human organs was later much employed in anatomy. He had corresponded with contemporaries across Europe and his friends Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Nicolas Malebranche used his microscopic research to substantiate their own natural and moral philosophy. But Swammerdam has also been credited with heralding the natural theology of the 18th century, were God&#x27;s grand design was detected in the mechanics of the Solar System, the seasons, snowflakes and the anatomy of the human eye. An English translation of his entomological works by T. Floyd was published in 1758.

No authentic portrait of Jan Swammerdam is extant nowadays. The portrait shown in the header is derived from the painting &quot;The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Tulp&quot; by Rembrandt and represents the leading Amsterdam physician Hartman Hartmanzoon (1591–1659).

<doc id="164969" wikidata="Q23361" url="?curid=164969" title="Magdeburg hemispheres">
<text>The Magdeburg hemispheres are a pair of large copper hemispheres with mating rims that were used in a famous 1654 experiment to demonstrate the power of atmospheric pressure. When the rims were sealed with grease and the air was pumped out, the sphere contained a vacuum and could not be pulled apart by teams of horses. Once the valve was opened, air rushed in and the hemispheres were easily separated. The Magdeburg hemispheres were invented by German scientist and mayor of Magdeburg, Otto von Guericke, to demonstrate the air pump that he had invented and the concept of atmospheric pressure. 

Speculation varied about the contents of the sphere. Many thought it was simply empty, while others argued the vacuum contained air or some finer aerial substance. Sound did not transmit through the sphere, indicating that sound needed a medium in order to be heard, while light did not. 

The first artificial vacuum had been produced a few years earlier by Evangelista Torricelli and inspired Guericke to design the world&#x27;s first vacuum pump, which consisted of a piston and cylinder with one-way flap valves. The hemispheres became popular in physics lectures as an illustration of the strength of air pressure, and are still used in education. The original hemispheres are on display in the Deutsches Museum in Munich.

Aside from its scientific importance, the experiment served to prove the recovery of the city of Magdeburg, which only two decades earlier had undergone the Sack of Magdeburg - considered the worst atrocity of the Thirty Years&#x27; War - when 20,000 of its inhabitants were massacred, and only 4,000 remained at the end of the war in 1648. Von Guericke was concerned with both aspects of the experiment, in his double capacity as a leading scientist and as the mayor who worked tirelessly to restore the city&#x27;s wealth.

==Overview==
The Magdeburg hemispheres, around 50 cm (20 inches) in diameter, were designed to demonstrate the vacuum pump that Guericke had invented. One of them had a tube connection to attach the pump, with a valve to close it off. When the air was sucked out from inside the hemispheres, and the valve was closed, the hose from the pump could be detached, and they were held firmly together by the air pressure of the surrounding atmosphere.

The force holding the hemispheres together was equal to the area bounded by the joint between the hemispheres, a circle with a diameter of 50 cm, multiplied by the difference in air pressure between the inside and the outside. It is unclear how strong a vacuum Guericke&#x27;s pump was able to achieve, but if it was able to evacuate all of the air from the inside, the hemispheres would have been held together with a force of around , equivalent to lifting a car or small elephant; a dramatic demonstration of the pressure of the atmosphere.

== Demonstrations ==
 Guericke&#x27;s demonstration was performed on 8 May 1654 in front of the Imperial Diet, and the Emperor Ferdinand III in Regensburg. Thirty horses, in two teams of fifteen, could not separate the hemispheres until the valve was opened to equalize the air pressure. In 1656 he repeated the demonstration with sixteen horses (two teams of eight) in his hometown of Magdeburg, where he was mayor. He also took the two spheres, hung the two hemispheres with a support, and removed the air from within. He then strapped weights to the spheres, but the spheres would not budge. Gaspar Schott was the first to describe the experiment in print in his &quot;Mechanica Hydraulico-Pneumatica&quot; (1657). In 1663 (or, according to some sources, in 1661) the same demonstration was given in Berlin before Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg with twenty-four horses.

The experiment became a popular way to illustrate the principles of air pressure, and many smaller copies of the hemispheres were made, and are used to this day in science classes. Reenactments of von Guericke&#x27;s experiment of 1654 are performed in locations around the world by the Otto von Guericke Society. On 18 March 2000, a demonstration using sixteen horses was conducted in Great Torrington by Barometer World.

The experiment has been commemorated on three German stamps.

After learning about Guericke&#x27;s pump through Schott&#x27;s book, Robert Boyle worked with Robert Hooke to design and build an improved air pump. From this, through various experiments, they formulated what is called Boyle&#x27;s law, which states that the volume of a body of an ideal gas is inversely proportional to its pressure. Much later the ideal gas law was formulated in 1834.

<text>Hydrography is the branch of applied sciences which deals with the measurement and description of the physical features of oceans, seas, coastal areas, lakes and rivers, as well as with the prediction of their change over time, for the primary purpose of safety of navigation and in support of all other marine activities, including economic development, security and defense, scientific research, and environmental protection.

==History==

The origins of hydrography lay in the making of charts to aid navigation, by individual mariners as they navigated into new waters. These were usually the private property, even closely held secrets, of individuals who used them for commercial or military advantage. As transoceanic trade and exploration increased, hydrographic surveys started to be carried out as an exercise in their own right, and the commissioning of surveys was increasingly done by governments and special hydrographic offices. National organizations, particularly navies, realized that the collection, systematization and distribution of this knowledge gave it great organizational and military advantages. Thus were born dedicated national hydrographic organizations for the collection, organization, publication and distribution of hydrography incorporated into charts and sailing directions.

Prior to the establishment of the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office, Royal Navy captains were responsible for the provision of their own charts. In practice this meant that ships often sailed with inadequate information for safe navigation, and that when new areas were surveyed, the data rarely reached all those who needed it. The Admiralty appointed Alexander Dalrymple as Hydrographer in 1795, with a remit to gather and distribute charts to HM Ships. Within a year existing charts from the previous two centuries had been collated, and the first catalog published. The first chart produced under the direction of the Admiralty, was a chart of Quiberon Bay in Brittany, and it appeared in 1800.

Under Captain Thomas Hurd the department received its first professional guidelines, and the first catalogs were published and made available to the public and to other nations as well. In 1829, Rear-Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort, as Hydrographer, developed the eponymous Scale, and introduced the first official tide tables in 1833 and the first &quot;Notices to Mariners&quot; in 1834. The Hydrographic Office underwent steady expansion throughout the 19th century; by 1855, the Chart Catalogue listed 1,981 charts giving a definitive coverage over the entire world, and produced over 130,000 charts annually, of which about half were sold.

The word &quot;hydrography&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek ὕδωρ (&quot;hydor&quot;), &quot;water&quot; and γράφω (&quot;graphō&quot;), &quot;to write&quot;.

==Overview==

Large-scale hydrography is usually undertaken by national or international organizations which sponsor data collection through precise surveys and publish charts and descriptive material for navigational purposes. The science of oceanography is, in part, an outgrowth of classical hydrography. In many respects the data are interchangeable, but marine hydrographic data will be particularly directed toward marine navigation and safety of that navigation. Marine resource exploration and exploitation is a significant application of hydrography, principally focused on the search for hydrocarbons.

Hydrographical measurements include the tidal, current and wave information of physical oceanography. They include bottom measurements, with particular emphasis on those marine geographical features that pose a hazard to navigation such as rocks, shoals, reefs and other features that obstruct ship passage. Bottom measurements also include collection of the nature of the bottom as it pertains to effective anchoring. Unlike oceanography, hydrography will include shore features, natural and manmade, that aid in navigation. Therefore, a hydrographic survey may include the accurate positions and representations of hills, mountains and even lights and towers that will aid in fixing a ship&#x27;s position, as well as the physical aspects of the sea and seabed.

Hydrography, mostly for reasons of safety, adopted a number of conventions that have affected its portrayal of the data on nautical charts. For example, hydrographic charts are designed to portray what is safe for navigation, and therefore will usually tend to maintain least depths and occasionally de-emphasize the actual submarine topography that would be portrayed on bathymetric charts. The former are the mariner&#x27;s tools to avoid accident. The latter are best representations of the actual seabed, as in a topographic map, for scientific and other purposes. Trends in hydrographic practice since c. 2003–2005 have led to a narrowing of this difference, with many more hydrographic offices maintaining &quot;best observed&quot; databases, and then making navigationally &quot;safe&quot; products as required. This has been coupled with a preference for multi-use surveys, so that the same data collected for nautical charting purposes can also be used for bathymetric portrayal.
Even though, in places, hydrographic survey data may be collected in sufficient detail to portray bottom topography in some areas, hydrographic charts only show depth information relevant for safe navigation and should not be considered as a product that accurately portrays the actual shape of the bottom. The soundings selected from the raw source depth data for placement on the nautical chart are selected for safe navigation and are biased to show predominantly the shallowest depths that relate to safe navigation. For instance, if there is a deep area that can not be reached because it is surrounded by shallow water, the deep area may not be shown. The color filled areas that show different ranges of shallow water are not the equivalent of contours on a topographic map since they are often drawn seaward of the actual shallowest depth portrayed. A bathymetric chart does show marine topology accurately. Details covering the above limitations can be found in Part 1 of Bowditch&#x27;s American Practical Navigator. Another concept that affects safe navigation is the sparsity of detailed depth data from high resolution sonar systems. In more remote areas, the only available depth information has been collected with lead lines. This collection method drops a weighted line to the bottom at intervals and records the depth, often from a rowboat or sail boat. There is no data between soundings or between sounding lines to guarantee that there is not a hazard such as a wreck or a coral head waiting there to ruin a sailor&#x27;s day. Often, the navigation of the collecting boat does not match today&#x27;s GPS navigational accuracies. The hydrographic chart will use the best data available and will caveat its nature in a caution note or in the legend of the chart.

A hydrographic survey is quite different from a bathymetric survey in some important respects, particularly in a bias toward least depths due to the safety requirements of the former and geomorphologic descriptive requirements of the latter. Historically, this could include echosoundings being conducted under settings biased toward least depths, but in modern practice hydrographic surveys typically attempt to best measure the depths observed, with the adjustments for navigational safety being applied after the fact.

Hydrography of streams will include information on the stream bed, flows, water quality and surrounding land. Basin or interior hydrography pays special attention to rivers and potable water although if collected data is not for ship navigational uses, and is intended for scientific usage, it is more commonly called &quot;hydrometry&quot; or &quot;hydrology&quot;.

Hydrography of rivers and streams is also an integral part of water management. Most reservoirs in the United States use dedicated stream gauging and rating tables to determine inflows into the reservoir and outflows to irrigation districts, water municipalities and other users of captured water. River/stream hydrographers use handheld and bank mounted devices, to capture a sectional flow rate of moving water through a section and or current.

=== Equipment ===
Uncrewed Surface Vessels (USVs) and are commonly used for hydrographic surveys - they are often equipped with some sort of sonar. Single-beam echosounders, multibeam echosounders, and side scan sonars are all frequently used in hydrographic applications. The knowledge gained from these surveys aid in disaster planning, port and harbor maintenance, and various other coastal planning activities.

==Organizations==
Hydrographic services in most countries are carried out by specialized hydrographic offices. The international coordination of hydrographic efforts lies with the International Hydrographic Organization.

The United Kingdom Hydrographic Office is one of the oldest, supplying a wide range of charts covering the globe to other countries, allied military organizations and the public.

In the United States, the hydrographic charting function has been carried out since 1807 by the Office of Coast Survey of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration within the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

<text>A terrella () is a small magnetised model ball representing the Earth, that is thought to have been invented by the English physician William Gilbert while investigating magnetism, and further developed 300 years later by the Norwegian scientist and explorer Kristian Birkeland, while investigating the aurora.

Terrellas have been used until the late 20th century to attempt to simulate the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere, but have now been replaced by computer simulations.

==William Gilbert&#x27;s terrella==

William Gilbert, the royal physician to Queen Elizabeth I, devoted much of his time, energy and resources to the study of the Earth&#x27;s magnetism. It had been known for centuries that a freely suspended compass needle pointed north. Earlier investigators (including Christopher Columbus) found that direction deviated somewhat from true north, and Robert Norman showed the force on the needle was not horizontal but slanted into the Earth.

William Gilbert&#x27;s explanation was that the Earth itself was a giant magnet, and he demonstrated this by creating a scale model of the magnetic Earth, a &quot;terrella&quot;, a sphere formed out of a lodestone. Passing a small compass over the terrella, Gilbert demonstrated that a horizontal compass would point towards the magnetic pole, while a dip needle, balanced on a horizontal axis perpendicular to the magnetic one, indicated the proper &quot;magnetic inclination&quot; between the magnetic force and the horizontal direction. Gilbert later reported his findings in De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure, published in 1600.

==Kristian Birkeland&#x27;s terrella==

Kristian Birkeland was a Norwegian physicist who, around 1895, tried to explain why the lights of the polar aurora appeared only in regions centered at the magnetic poles.

He simulated the effect by directing cathode rays (later identified as electrons) at a terrella in a vacuum tank, and found they indeed produced a glow in regions around the poles of the terrella. Because of residual gas in the chamber, the glow also outlined the path of the particles. Neither he nor his associate Carl Størmer (who calculated such paths) could understand why the actual aurora avoided the area directly above the poles themselves. Birkeland believed the electrons came from the Sun, since large auroral outbursts were associated with sunspot activity.

Birkeland constructed several terrellas. One large terrella experiment was reconstructed in Tromsø, Norway.

==Other terrellas==
The German Baron Carl Reichenbach (1788–1869) also experimented with a terrella. He used an electromagnet, placed within a large hollow iron sphere, and this was examined in the darkroom under varying degrees of electrification.

Brunberg and Dattner in Sweden, around 1950, used a terrella to simulate trajectories of particles in the Earth&#x27;s field. Podgorny in the Soviet Union, around 1972, built terrellas at which a flow of plasma was directed, simulating the solar wind. Hafiz-Ur Rahman at the University of California, Riverside conducted more realistic experiments around 1990. All such experiments are difficult to interpret, and are never able to scale all the parameters needed to properly simulate the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere, which is why such experiments have now been completely replaced by computer simulations.

Recently the terrella experiments have been further developed by a team of physicists at the Institute of Planetology and Astrophysics in Grenoble, France to create the &quot;planeterrella&quot; which uses two magnetised spheres which can be manipulated to recreate several different auroral phenomena.

<text>Garret Desmond FitzGerald (9 February 192619 May 2011) was an Irish Fine Gael politician, economist, and barrister who served twice as Taoiseach, serving from 1981 to 1982 and 1982 to 1987. He served as Leader of Fine Gael from 1977 to 1987 and was twice Leader of the Opposition between 1977 and 1982; he was previously Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1973 to 1977. FitzGerald served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1969 to 1992 and was a Senator for the Industrial and Commercial Panel from 1965 to 1969.

He was the son of Desmond FitzGerald, the first foreign minister of the Irish Free State. At the time of his death, FitzGerald was president of the Institute of International and European Affairs and a columnist for &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, and had made occasional appearances on television programmes.

== Early life ==
Garret FitzGerald was born in Ballsbridge, Dublin, in 1926, son of Desmond FitzGerald and Mabel McConnell Fitzgerald. His mother was involved in politics; it was through her that his father also became political. He had three elder brothers, Desmond (1911–1987), Pierce (1914–1986), and Fergus (1920–1983). His father was born and raised in London and was the Minister for External Affairs at the time of his son&#x27;s birth. He was the son of a labourer who had emigrated from Skeheenarinky in County Tipperary, joined the Irish Volunteers in 1914, and fought during the 1916 Easter Rising. FitzGerald senior had been active in Sinn Féin during the Irish War of Independence and had been one of the founders of Cumann na nGaedheal. The party was formed to support the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, which created the Irish Free State.

Although a senior figure on the pro-treaty side of Ireland&#x27;s political divide, FitzGerald senior had remained friendly with anti-Treaty republicans, such as Belfast man Seán MacEntee, a minister in Éamon de Valera&#x27;s government and father-in-law of Conor Cruise O&#x27;Brien. The families of Patrick McGilligan and Ernest Blythe were also frequent visitors to the FitzGerald household. FitzGerald&#x27;s mother, the former Mabel Washington McConnell, was a nationalist and republican of Ulster Protestant descent. However, later in life she converted to Catholicism. Her son would later describe his political objective as the creation of a pluralist Ireland where the northern Protestants of his mother&#x27;s family tradition and the southern Catholics of his father&#x27;s could feel equally at home.

FitzGerald was educated at the Jesuit Belvedere College and University College Dublin (UCD), from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts honours degree in history, French and Spanish in 1946, later returning to complete a PhD in economics which he obtained in 1968; his doctoral thesis was published the following year, titled &quot;Planning in Ireland&quot;. He was deeply interested in the politics of the Spanish Civil War and World War II. A bright student who counted among his contemporaries in UCD his future political rival, Charles Haughey, who also knew Joan O&#x27;Farrell (1923–1999), a Liverpool-born fellow student, whom FitzGerald married in 1947. Their children were John, Mary, and Mark.

Following his university education, in 1947, he started working with Aer Lingus, the state airline of Ireland, and became an authority on the strategic economic planning of transport. During this time, he wrote many newspaper articles, was the Irish correspondent for British magazine &quot;The Economist&quot;, and was encouraged to write on National Accounts and economics by the features editor in &quot;the Irish Times&quot;. He remained with Aer Lingus until 1958; the following year, after undertaking a study of the economics of Irish industry at Trinity College Dublin, he became a lecturer in economics at UCD.

FitzGerald qualified as a barrister, from the King&#x27;s Inns of Ireland, and spoke French fluently.

== Early political life ==
FitzGerald was eager to enter politics. Despite his pro-Treaty roots, several members of Fianna Fáil, including Charles Haughey and Michael Yeats, suggested that he should join that party. Ultimately, FitzGerald made his entry into party politics under the banner of Fine Gael, of which his father had been a founding member. He attached himself to the party&#x27;s liberal wing, which rallied around the Just Society programme written by Declan Costello. FitzGerald was elected to Seanad Éireann for the Industrial and Commercial Panel in 1965 and soon built up his political profile. FitzGerald was elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1969 general election, for the Dublin South-East constituency, the same year he obtained his PhD for a thesis later published under the title &quot;Planning in Ireland&quot;. He became an important figure almost immediately in the parliamentary party, and his liberal ideas were seen as a counterweight to the conservative leader, Liam Cosgrave. The difference in political outlook and FitzGerald&#x27;s ambitions for the Fine Gael leadership resulted in profound tensions between the two men. In his leadership address to the 1972 Fine Gael Ardfheis in Cork, Cosgrave referred to the &quot;mongrel foxes&quot; who should be rooted out of the party, a reference seen by many as an attack on FitzGerald&#x27;s efforts to unseat him as leader.

FitzGerald was an opponent of the US bombing of North Vietnam.

== Minister for Foreign Affairs (1973–1977) ==

After the 1973 general election, Fine Gael entered office in a coalition government with the Labour Party, with Liam Cosgrave as Taoiseach. FitzGerald hoped that he would take over as Minister for Finance, particularly after a good performance in a pre-election debate with the then Minister for Finance George Colley. However, the position went to Richie Ryan, with FitzGerald becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs. FitzGerald&#x27;s father had held that same post in a government led by Liam Cosgrave&#x27;s father W. T. Cosgrave, fifty years earlier. His appointment to Iveagh House (the headquarters of the Department of Foreign Affairs) would have a significant effect on FitzGerald&#x27;s career and the future of Fine Gael. Cosgrave was suspicious of FitzGerald&#x27;s liberal ideas and believed that he had designs on the leadership. During his period at Foreign Affairs, FitzGerald developed a good relationship with Liam Cosgrave, and all the tension between them in opposition disappeared.

The minister&#x27;s role had changed substantially since his father&#x27;s day. Ireland was no longer a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, but had in 1973 joined the European Economic Community (EEC), the organisation which would later become the European Union (EU). FitzGerald, firmly ensconced as Foreign Minister, was free from any blame due to other Ministers&#x27; mishandling of the economy. If anything, his tenure at the Department of Foreign Affairs helped him eventually achieve the party&#x27;s leadership. His innovative views, energy and fluency in French won him – and through him, Ireland – a status in European affairs far exceeding the country&#x27;s size and ensured that the first Irish Presidency of the European Council in 1975 was a noted success.

FitzGerald&#x27;s policy towards church-state relations, however, brought him into a confrontation with the Roman Catholic church, whose &quot;special position&quot; in the Republic had been enshrined in the constitution until the Referendum of December 1972. FitzGerald, in 1973, met the Cardinal Secretary of State, Agostino Casaroli, and proposed to modify the Republic&#x27;s Constitution further to remove laws with overtly Catholic foundations, such as the bans on divorce and contraception, as well as to relax the public stigmas in Northern Ireland towards mixed religious marriages and integrated education. Casaroli initially seemed receptive, and the government formally submitted the proposal to the Vatican. FitzGerald&#x27;s vision caused great consternation among the church&#x27;s hierarchy, however, and in 1977, Pope Paul VI personally met with FitzGerald to tell him that &quot;Ireland was a Catholic country – perhaps the only one left – and it should stay that way. Laws should not be changed in any way that would make the country less Catholic.&quot;

== Leadership of Fine Gael ==
In 1977, the National Coalition of Fine Gael and Labour suffered a disastrous electoral defeat in the general election. Liam Cosgrave resigned as party leader, and FitzGerald was chosen by acclamation to succeed him. In his new role as Leader of the Opposition and party leader, he set about modernising and revitalising Fine Gael. He immediately appointed a General-Secretary to oversee all of this, a tactic copied from Fianna Fáil. Under FitzGerald, Fine Gael experienced a rapid rise in support and popularity. After the November 1982 election, it held only five seats fewer than Fianna Fáil (the parties&#x27; closest-ever margin until 2011; at times Fianna Fáil was far larger, on one occasion well over twice as large), with Fine Gael in the Oireachtas (i.e. including the Seanad) larger than Fianna Fáil, which had been the dominant force in Irish politics for 40 years.

== Taoiseach (1981–1982) ==

By the time of the 1981 general election, Fine Gael had a party machine that could easily match Fianna Fáil&#x27;s. The party won 65 seats and formed a minority coalition government with the Labour Party and the support of several Independent TDs. FitzGerald was elected Taoiseach on 30 June 1981. To the surprise of many, FitzGerald excluded Richie Ryan, Richard Burke and Tom O&#x27;Donnell, former Fine Gael stalwarts, from the cabinet.

Two fundamental problems faced FitzGerald during his first period: Northern Ireland and the worsening economic situation. A protest march in support of the H-Block hunger strikers in July 1981 was harshly dealt with by FitzGerald. On one occasion where he met with relatives of the hunger strikers, he refused to meet the family of Bobby Sands, an MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and O/C of the Provisional IRA hunger strikers, and the first to die on this strike, along with the sister of Raymond McCreesh, who had died on 21 May. During the meeting, two of Thomas McElwee&#x27;s sisters, Mary and Nora, broke down and left. Mary McElwee told the media outside that &quot;he&#x27;s doing nothing, he&#x27;s asking for suggestions&quot;. FitzGerald then ordered Gardaí to remove the families from the meeting. FitzGerald&#x27;s response was, in the words of Eamonn Sweeney, to &quot;lay all the blame for the hunger strikers on the republican movement and to suggest an immediate unilateral end to their military campaign&quot;.

The economic crisis was also much worse than FitzGerald had feared. Fine Gael had to scrap its plans for tax cuts in the run-up to the election, and a draconian mid-year budget was introduced almost immediately. The July Budget seemed exceptionally austere for a government dependent on Independent TDs support. However, the second budget introduced by John Bruton led to the government&#x27;s defeat in the Dáil on the evening of 27 January 1982.

In light of this loss of supply, FitzGerald went to Áras an Uachtaráin to request an immediate dissolution of the Dáil from the president, Patrick Hillery. When he got there, he was informed that senior opposition figures (and some Independent TDs), including the Opposition leader (and ex-Taoiseach) Charles Haughey, Brian Lenihan and Sylvester Barrett, had made a series of telephone calls demanding that Hillery refuse the dissolution, as he was constitutionally allowed to do when it was advised by a Taoiseach who has &quot;ceased to retain the support of a majority in Dáil Éireann.&quot; Had Hillery done so, it would have forced FitzGerald&#x27;s resignation as Taoiseach and enabled the Dáil to nominate someone else for the post—presumably Haughey. Hillery is said to have angrily rejected such pressure, regarding it as gross misconduct. He granted FitzGerald the dissolution.

In the subsequent general election in February 1982, Fine Gael lost only two seats but was out of office. However, a third general election within eighteen months in November 1982 resulted in FitzGerald being returned as Taoiseach for a second time, heading a Fine Gael–Labour coalition with a working majority.

== Taoiseach (1982–1987) ==

Deep economic recession dominated FitzGerald&#x27;s second term as well as his first. Pursuing &quot;fiscal rectitude&quot; to reduce a high national debt required a firmer control of public spending than Labour found easy to accept. The harmonious relationship the Taoiseach developed with his Tánaiste, Dick Spring, successfully avoided a collapse of the coalition for more than four years, despite tensions between other Ministers, and enabled the government to survive. Fine Gael wanted to revive the economy by controlling public spending and imposing cutbacks to reduce the public budget deficit.

The measures proposed by FitzGerald&#x27;s Minister for Finance, Alan Dukes, were utterly unacceptable to the Labour Party, which was under enormous pressure from its support base to maintain public services. The two parties in government found themselves in a stalemate position. They stopped the financial crisis from worsening but could not take the decisive action that would generate economic growth. With negligible economic growth and large-scale unemployment, the FitzGerald government was deeply unpopular with the public.

When FitzGerald attended a Bilderberg meeting in 1985, his rival Haughey suggested it had links with NATO, thus contravening Ireland&#x27;s official position of neutrality.

=== Constitutional reform ===
As Taoiseach for a second time, FitzGerald advocated a liberalisation of Irish society to create what he called the non-sectarian nation of &quot;Tone and Davis&quot;. The Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, which &quot;[acknowledged] the right to life of the unborn&quot;, was approved in a referendum against the recommendation of FitzGerald. A proposal to allow divorce was defeated in a 1986 referendum; however, the law on contraception was liberalised under the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act 1985.

=== Northern Ireland ===
FitzGerald set up the New Ireland Forum in 1983, which brought together representatives of the constitutional political parties in the Republic and the nationalist SDLP from Northern Ireland. Although the Unionist parties declined his invitation to join, and the Forum&#x27;s conclusions proposing various forms of association between Northern Ireland and the Republic were rejected outright by British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, the Forum provided the impetus for the resumption of serious negotiations between the Irish and British governments, which culminated in the Anglo-Irish Agreement of November 1985. This agreement provided for a mechanism by which the British government could consult the Republic of Ireland regarding the governance of Northern Ireland, and was bitterly opposed by Unionists in Northern Ireland, whose MPs all resigned their seats in the British Parliament in protest. New elections were required to be held in Northern Ireland, in which the unionists lost the seat of Newry and Armagh to Seamus Mallon of the SDLP. During this period, on 15 March 1984, he was also invited to address a joint session of the United States Congress, the fourth Irish leader to do so.

His government had also passed the Extradition Act 1987, which ended the long-standing defence against extradition of suspects who could plead that an act of violence in Northern Ireland or Britain was a political offence.

While the agreement was repudiated and condemned by Unionists, it was said to become the basis for developing trust and joint action between the governments, which in time would ultimately bring about the Downing Street Declaration of 1993 and the subsequent republican and loyalist cease-fires.

=== Infighting and declining support ===
FitzGerald attempted to reshuffle his cabinet in February 1986, but certain ministers resisted – notably Barry Desmond, who refused to move from his Health and Social Welfare portfolio. The eventual outcome of the cabinet changes further undermined FitzGerald&#x27;s authority. The new Progressive Democrats party was launched later that year by Desmond O&#x27;Malley out of the divisions within Fianna Fáil. It struck an immediate chord with many disenchanted Fine Gael supporters who had tired of the failure to address the economic crisis fully and who yearned for a coherent right-wing policy from FitzGerald. Seeing their party&#x27;s support base under attack from the right only strengthened the resolve of FitzGerald&#x27;s Fine Gael colleagues to break with the Labour Party approach, despite their leader&#x27;s close empathy with Labour.

Stymied by the economic crisis, FitzGerald tried to rescue some of his ambitions to reform the state, and he proposed, in the middle of 1986, a referendum to change the constitution to allow for divorce. The proposed amendment was mired in controversy, and the many accompanying legal changes needed were not presented. Haughey skilfully opposed the referendum along with the Roman Catholic Church and landed interests worried about property rights.

In January 1987, the Labour Party members of the government withdrew from the government over disagreements due to budget proposals. Lacking a parliamentary majority, FitzGerald sought a dissolution of the Dáil, which was granted, continuing to lead a minority Fine Gael government until after the election. In the 1987 general election, Fine Gael stood on the proposed stringent budgetary cutbacks that Labour had blocked for four years. Fianna Fáil returned to office in March 1987 after Fine Gael was heavily defeated in the election. The Progressive Democrats won 14 seats, mainly from Fine Gael. Although Haughey did not have an overall majority, when it came to the Dáil vote on the nomination of Taoiseach, the Independent left-wing TD Tony Gregory voted against FitzGerald but abstained on Haughey, seeing Haughey as the &quot;lesser of two evils&quot;. This was because of Gregory&#x27;s opposition to the Anglo-Irish agreement and his strong personal dislike for FitzGerald. Haughey was elected Taoiseach on the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle.

== Post-Taoiseach period ==

FitzGerald retired as leader of Fine Gael immediately after the Dáil elected Haughey as Taoiseach; the parliamentary party elected Alan Dukes in his place. His autobiography appeared in 1991, immediately becoming a best-seller. He retired completely from politics at the 1992 general election. His wife, Joan, predeceased him in 1999 after a long illness.

After that, FitzGerald wrote a weekly column every Saturday in &quot;The Irish Times&quot; and lectured widely at home and abroad on public affairs. He came out of retirement to campaign for a &quot;yes&quot; vote in the second Irish referendum on the EU&#x27;s Treaty of Nice, held in 2002. He held the post of Chancellor of the National University of Ireland from 1997 to 2009. In March 2000, FitzGerald was on the board of directors of &quot;Election.com&quot; when it conducted the world&#x27;s first public election ever held over the Internet, Arizona&#x27;s Democratic primary; in that primary, voter turnout increased more than 500% over the 1996 primary.

FitzGerald took a leading part in the campaign for a second referendum on the EU&#x27;s Treaty of Lisbon in 2009. He argued for Ireland to continue with European integration. FitzGerald had been scathing of the record of the Fianna Fáil–led government since 1997 on the economy and the national finances. In his &quot;Irish Times&quot; column, he was a frequent critic of the loss of competitiveness and the inflation caused by the tax cuts and excessive public spending increases of the Celtic Tiger era. In 2009, FitzGerald received a new ministerial car, the first and only one to be purchased by the state since an economic recession hit Ireland in 2008. In 2010, FitzGerald appeared on RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;Top 40 Irishmen&quot; list.

He was vice-president of the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland for his last 20 years.

== Finances ==
In early 1999, it emerged that some six years earlier, Allied Irish Banks (AIB) and Ansbacher Banks wrote off debts of almost IR£200,000 owed by FitzGerald, following the collapse of the aircraft leasing company, Guinness Peat Aviation (GPA), in which he was a shareholder. The chairman of AIB at the time, Peter Sutherland, was also a former director of GPA and had served as Attorney General under FitzGerald, prior to FitzGerald appointing him as Ireland&#x27;s member of the European Commission. The Moriarty Tribunal investigated this matter, and compared the treatment by AIB of FitzGerald with their treatment of Charles Haughey. They found evidence that he had worked to compromise his indebtedness with AIB and no evidence of any wrongdoing.

== Illness and death ==
On 5 May 2011, it was reported that FitzGerald was seriously ill in a Dublin hospital. Newly elected Fine Gael Taoiseach Enda Kenny sent his regards and called him an &quot;institution&quot;; on 6 May he was put on a ventilator. On 19 May, after suffering from pneumonia, he died at the Mater Private Hospital in Dublin, at the age of 85.

In a statement, Irish president Mary McAleese hailed FitzGerald as &quot;a man steeped in the history of the State who constantly strove to make Ireland a better place for all its people&quot;. Taoiseach Enda Kenny paid homage to &quot;a truly remarkable man who made a truly remarkable contribution to Ireland&quot;. Henry Kissinger, the former US secretary of state who served as an to FitzGerald in the 1970s, recalled &quot;an intelligent and amusing man who was dedicated to his country&quot;.

His death occurred on the third day of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s state visit to the Republic of Ireland, an event designed to mark the completion of the Northern Ireland peace process that had been &quot;built on the foundations&quot; of FitzGerald&#x27;s Hillsborough Agreement with Margaret Thatcher in 1985. In a personal message, the Queen offered her sympathies and said she was &quot;saddened&quot; to learn of FitzGerald&#x27;s death. British prime minister David Cameron, who was also in Ireland, paid tribute to FitzGerald&#x27;s &quot;huge contribution to the peace process bringing reconciliation for all that had happened in the past&quot;. On his visit to Dublin, US president Barack Obama offered condolences on FitzGerald&#x27;s death; he spoke of &quot;someone who believed in the power of education; someone who believed in the potential of youth; most of all, someone who believed in the potential of peace and who lived to see that peace realised&quot;.

FitzGerald was buried at Shanganagh Cemetery.

=== Remembrance ===
In February 2012, Young Fine Gael (YFG) announced that its annual summer school would be renamed the Garret FitzGerald YFG Summer School.

<text>Loss of supply occurs where a government in a parliamentary democracy using the Westminster System or a system derived from it is denied a supply of treasury or exchequer funds, by whichever house or houses of parliament or head of state is constitutionally entitled to grant and deny supply. A defeat on a budgetary vote is one way by which supply can be denied. Loss of supply is typically interpreted as indicating a loss of confidence in the government. Not all money bills are necessarily supply bills. For instance, in Australia, supply bills are defined as &quot;bills which are required by the Government to carry on its day-to-day business&quot;.

When a loss of supply occurs, a prime minister is generally required either by constitutional convention or by explicit constitutional instruction to either resign immediately or seek a parliamentary dissolution.

Some constitutions, however, do not allow the option of parliamentary dissolution but rather require the government to be dissolved or to resign.

A similar deadlock can occur within a presidential system, where it is also known as a budget crisis. In contrast to parliamentary systems, the failure of the legislature to authorize spending may not in all circumstances result in an election, because some such legislatures enjoy fixed terms and so cannot be dissolved before a date of termination, which can result in a prolonged crisis.

A deadlock between a head of state and the legislative body can give rise and cause for a head of state to prematurely dismiss the elected government, requiring it to seek re-election. If a government maintains the support of a majority of legislators or the elected parliamentary representatives, the blocking of supply by a head of state would be seen as an abuse of authority and power. Many western countries have removed or restricted the right of a head of state to block supply or veto a government budget unless there is overwhelming justification and cause for such action.

==Examples of the threat or loss of supply==
* In 1909, the UK House of Lords voted against the &quot;People&#x27;s Budget&quot;, precipitating two general elections and the Parliament Act 1911, which limited the power of the Lords.
* In the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, the elected Senate delayed voting on a bill to authorize supply for the government demanding that the Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, call an election for the House of Representatives. Whitlam was dismissed by the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, on the basis of his refusal to either resign or request a dissolution.
* In December 1979 in Canada, the Progressive Conservative government of Joe Clark was defeated on a budget vote. Clark called the 1980 Canadian federal election as a result. Pierre Trudeau and the Liberals won a majority of seats in the House of Commons of Canada. Clark resigned as prime minister and was replaced by Trudeau.
* In September 1980, the Italian Chamber of Deputies rejected a budget bill proposed by the second Cossiga government in a 298-297 vote taken by secret ballot. Francesco Cossiga consequently resigned as prime minister and was replaced by Arnaldo Forlani.
* The defeat of Garret FitzGerald&#x27;s government in a budget vote in Dáil Éireann in the Republic of Ireland in 1982. FitzGerald immediately sought and was granted a Dáil dissolution.
*On 9 March 2011, the Legislative Council of Hong Kong blocked a resolution for provisional appropriations, which, before 2011, had always been a matter of formality. Resolutions for provisional appropriations had never been voted by division until 2011. The government decided, on the following day, to table another resolution with a minor change being made merely for the sake of circumventing procedural requirements that a negatived question cannot be tabled again.
*On 10 December 2012, the Maltese Parliament rejected the budget bill for the 2013 fiscal year in a 35-34 vote taken by rising vote. Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi consequently advised the President to dissolve Parliament and called elections for 9 March of the following year.
* On 13 February 2019, the Spanish Government lost a vote on a budget bill, 191-158, thanks to two allies of the Government, Republican Left of Catalonia and the Catalan European Democratic Party, siding against it. A snap election was immediately called, which eventually led to a new election of a second Sánchez Government. Both of those parties eventually sided with the new Government to pass the 2021 Budget.

<doc id="164992" wikidata="Q172744" url="?curid=164992" title="Juan Pablo Montoya">
<text>Juan Pablo Montoya Roldán (; born 20 September 1975) is a Colombian racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to , IndyCar between 1999 and 2022, and the NASCAR Cup Series between 2006 and 2024. Montoya won seven Formula One Grands Prix across six seasons. In American open-wheel racing, Montoya won the CART Championship Series in 1999 with Chip Ganassi Racing (CGR) and is a two-time winner of the Indianapolis 500. In endurance racing, Montoya won the IMSA SportsCar Championship in 2019 with Team Penske and is a three-time winner of the 24 Hours of Daytona with CGR.

Montoya began kart racing at the age of five, progressing to car racing in Colombia and Mexico at age 17, finishing runner-up in the Copa Formula Renault and winning the Nationale Tournement Swift GTI Championship. He also competed in the Barber Saab Pro Series, the Formula Vauxhall Lotus Championship and the British Formula 3 Championship. In 1997 and 1998, Montoya raced in the International Formula 3000 for RSM Marko and then Super Nova Racing, winning seven races and the 1998 Drivers&#x27; Championship. He debuted in CART in 1999 with CGR, winning the series championship as a rookie in 1999. During the 2000 CART season, Montoya&#x27;s car suffered from unreliability, but still won three races for ninth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. That year also saw him win the Indianapolis 500 (in the rival Indy Racing League (IRL)) in his first attempt.

He first drove in Formula One with the Williams team in the 2001 season and won his first race in that year&#x27;s . Montoya qualified on pole position seven times in the championship and won two races in the season that put him third in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship in both years. He fell to fifth in the 2004 World Drivers&#x27; Championship but won the season-ending . At the start of the season, Montoya moved to McLaren and finished fourth with three victories. Montoya left F1 in the 2006 season, after that year&#x27;s and began competing in NASCAR for CGR in late 2006. During his seven-year NASCAR career, Montoya won the 2007 Telcel-Motorola Mexico 200, the 2007 Toyota/Save Mart 350 and the 2010 Heluva Good! Sour Cream Dips at the Glen. He qualified for the Chase for the Sprint Cup in 2009 and finished a career-high eighth in that season&#x27;s points standings. Montoya would later make one-off NASCAR appearances, twice in 2014 for Team Penske and once in 2024 for 23XI Racing.

For the 2014 season, Montoya moved to the IndyCar Series with Penske, winning once. In 2015 he won two races (including the Indianapolis 500) and finished second in the championship to Scott Dixon. His final series victory came in 2016. He made his IMSA debut for Penske at the 2017 Petit Le Mans, competing full-time from 2018 to 2020. Paired with Dane Cameron, Montoya won the IMSA championship in the Prototype class in 2019. Montoya has also won the 6 Hours of Bogotá three times as well as the individual event of the Race of Champions in 2017.

==Early life==

Montoya was born on the morning of 20 September 1975, in a Bogotá hospital, to middle-class parents Pablo (an architect who enjoyed motor racing and amateur go-karting) and his wife Libia Roldán de Montoya (). He is the family&#x27;s eldest child, with two younger brothers and a sister. Montoya&#x27;s grandfather Santiago worked in real estate, while his uncle Diego raced sports cars. The family lived in the San José de Bavaria neighbourhood in Bogotá&#x27;s northern outskirts. Montoya attended the private schools Colegio Gimnasio Bilingue Campestre and later the Colegio San Tarsicio after his test scores were too low and he was a Boy Scout. He spent four days a week on his education and three days racing by the end of his schooling.

==Junior racing career==

Aged five, Montoya began kart racing when his father brought him a go-kart, taught him to drive and trained at the Kartódromo Cajica outside of Bogota. His father mentored him, discreetly remortgaging the house without his wife&#x27;s knowledge to finance his son&#x27;s career or rearranging finances and obtaining sponsorship until Formula 3000 (F3000). Montoya got funding working as a delivery boy for his father, learnt racecraft and mechanical engineering from him, and was inspired by drivers Roberto Guerrero and Ayrton Senna. He raced in a self-organised karting championship due to the Colombian Karting Federation&#x27;s financial problems. Montoya won the 1984 Colombian Children&#x27;s National Karting Championship, was second in the 1985 Colombian National Karting Championship and won the following year&#x27;s local and national titles. Montoya won numerous championships in the Kart Komet category&#x27;s local and national divisions from 1987 to 1989. He raced in the World Karting Junior Championship in 1990 and 1991, respectively. Montoya won four national championships and finished second three times.

He began car racing in 1992, and travelled to the United States that September to attend a three-day Skip Barber Racing School at Sonoma Raceway under the tutelage of lead instructor Vic Elford. Montoya then returned to Colombia to drive a Van Diemen car in the 1600cc Copa Formula Renault after series officials rejected him for being inexperienced and for being an aggressive driver until the withdrawal of one driver enabled his entry. He took four wins and five pole positions for second in the eight-race championship. Montoya won the eight-round Nationale Tournement Swift GTI Championship in a Suzuki Swift in 1993, winning seven races and seven poles. He was second in the ten-race Lada Samara Cup with five wins and three pole positions and he won his class in the 1994 Karting SudAm 125 Championship. After his father determined that his son could better himself outside of Colombia because of the country&#x27; lack of race tracks and senior championships, Montoya entered the American-based Barber Saab Pro Series in 1994 featuring normally aspirated cars, winning two races, two poles and eleven top-ten finishes for third overall with 114 points. He also raced for the Osaka team in Mexico, finishing third overall in the local sports car prototype division and earning three wins and four pole positions in the Nissan-powered single seater Formula N support category.

Montoya continued racing instead of attending university after graduating from high school in 1995. His father was told that Montoya had to move to Europe to further his career, and Montoya&#x27;s coach, Peter Argetsinger, got him introduced to Jackie and Paul Stewart, who tested him at the Silverstone Circuit in England. After Jackie Stewart suggested that Montoya do a year&#x27;s junior racing, they put him in Paul Stewart Racing&#x27;s (PWR) Formula Vauxhall Lotus Championship team rather than the British Formula 3 Championship. He initially struggled but improved after being taught to better use his energy and to drive smoother by Jackie Stewart. He won three of the season&#x27;s 14 races (all from pole position) and five podium finishes for third in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 125 points. In October 1995, he finished ninth in the International Formula 3 Cup at Donington Park, and won the 6 Hours of Bogotá endurance race with co-drivers Jorge Cortés and Diego Guzmán in Spice&#x27;s No. 45 Group C car.

Montoya advanced to the British Formula 3 Championship in 1996, driving a Fortec Motorsport-entered Dallara F396-Mitsubishi car after South American sponsorship was obtained when driver Cristiano da Matta had funding problems and PWR&#x27;s plans to run three vehicles fell through due to structural and competitiveness concerns. Despite feeling uncomfortable in the underpowered car and making mistakes, he took two wins, five podium finishes and a pole position to end the 16-race season fifth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 137 points. That year saw Montoya finished fourth in the Masters of Formula 3 at Circuit Zandvoort. He replaced Jan Magnussen in the International Touring Car Championship&#x27;s double header round at Silverstone, driving Mercedes-AMG&#x27;s Mercedes-Benz C-Klasse and retired from both races. Montoya retired from the Macau Grand Prix but won his second 6 Hours of Bogotá with Jorge Arango and Cortés.

For 1997, he wanted to move to the International F3000 Championship—Formula One&#x27;s (F1) feeder series— and accepted an offer from team owner Helmut Marko to drive for his RSM Marko squad in F3000 after budgetary issues stopped Super Nova Racing owner David Sears from signing him. Marko advised Montoya to eat healthily and exercise more in order to boost his performance and handle heavier cars better, but he was hesitant and occasionally fell behind owing to a lack of mental fortitude. He won three races driving the Lola T96/50-Zytek car at the Pau Grand Prix, the A1-Ring and the Circuito de Jerez and took two pole positions. Montoya made errors that lost him two race victories, and was mathematically eliminated from championship contention after finishing third in the season&#x27;s penultimate round at Mugello Circuit, which Ricardo Zonta won. He was second in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 37.5 points and was the series&#x27; highest-placed rookie. Outside of F3000, Montoya won the 6 Hours of Bogotá for the third time, alongside Cortés and Guzmán.

In November 1997, Williams Grand Prix Engineering team owner Frank Williams invited him to a shootout between Soheil Ayari, Nicolas Minassian and Max Wilson at the Circuit de Catalunya to decide who would be its F1 test driver. He got the role and covered in 1998 as well as studying telemetry for drivers Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Jacques Villeneuve. Montoya joined Super Nova Racing for the 1998 International F3000 Championship after a character clash with Marko and declined Marko&#x27;s offer to become his manager, who paid Sears for Montoya to race at Super Nova. During a season-long rivalry with West Competition Team driver Nick Heidfeld, he won four races (at Catalunya, Silverstone, Pau and the Autodromo di Pergusa), took nine podium finishes and seven pole positions. Montoya won the championship by finishing third in the season finale at the Nürburgring and ended the 12-race season with 65 points.

==CART and first Indianapolis 500 win==

He made his Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) debut in 1999 for Chip Ganassi Racing (CGR) on a three-year contract after Williams signed double CART champion Alex Zanardi from CGR to drive for them instead of Montoya because Williams wanted a more experienced driver and thought Montoya needed more development. Montoya could not drive for the Jordan, Stewart, Minardi and Sauber teams because he was under contract to Williams, but Frank Williams enabled CGR owner Chip Ganassi and team manager Mo Nunn to sign him.

He drove the No. 4 Reynard 99I-Honda car, and was advised on oval track racing by Ganassi, Nunn and teammate Jimmy Vasser. Montoya won his first CART race, the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach, in the season&#x27;s third round. He then won the Bosch Spark Plug Grand Prix at Nazareth Speedway from pole position, leading a race-high 210 laps to take the championship lead from Greg Moore, and became the first rookie to win three successive races after leading 93 laps in the Rio 200. Montoya later took two pole positions and a top-three finish at Portland International Raceway due to a penalty and fuel strategy. Montoya then won the Grand Prix of Cleveland at Burke Lakefront Airport from pole position, but reliability issues and accidents over the next four races lost him the championship lead to Dario Franchitti. He won the next three races at Mid-Ohio, Chicago and Vancouver to retake the championship lead, but two more accidents and Franchitti&#x27;s better performance over the next three events put him nine points behind going into the season-ending Marlboro 500 at California Speedway. He finished fourth and Franchitti tenth, finishing the season with the same number of points as Franchitti (212) but winning the championship, with seven victories to Franchitti&#x27;s three. Montoya became CART&#x27;s youngest champion, the second rookie champion after Nigel Mansell and was Rookie of the Year.

Montoya switched to an Lola B2K/00-Toyota car for the 2000 season, which was marred by unreliability. Montoya struggled in the first four races, but improved to claim four consecutive pole positions and Toyota&#x27;s first CART victory in the rain-delayed Miller Lite 225 at the Milwaukee Mile after leading a race-high 179 laps from pole position. He won the Michigan 500 at Michigan International Speedway with a last-lap overtake on Michael Andretti and held him off by 0.040 seconds. Montoya&#x27;s performance was hampered by mechanical issues in the following five races, despite taking pole position in Chicago. He took his third (and final) victory of the season from pole position in the Motorola 300 at Gateway International Raceway. Montoya finished second in Houston and qualified first at Surfers Paradise in the final three events for ninth overall with 126 points.

He drove CGR&#x27;s No. 9 G-Force GF05-Oldsmobile Aurora in the Indianapolis 500 (part of the Indy Racing League) in May. Starting second, Montoya led 167 of the race&#x27;s 200 laps to become the first rookie winner since Graham Hill in 1966.

==Formula One==

=== 2001–2004 (Williams) ===
Montoya left CGR with Ganassi&#x27;s approval and debuted in F1 with Williams in its FW23-BMW car in the 2001 season after signing a two-year contract in mid-2000 to replace Jenson Button. He began losing weight to appease senior Williams officials and to become more race ready, and became acquainted with tracks he had not raced on by playing simulation video games. Montoya&#x27;s car was powerful and capable of challenging for victories, but it was unreliable, and he was frequently involved in accidents; this became less common after the , when he was involved in a physical altercation with Villeneuve, when Frank Williams spoke to Montoya, and his performances improved. His Michelin tyres exposed him to understeer due to severe tyre sensitivity, which was rectified. Montoya began lapping faster than teammate Ralf Schumacher, with whom he had a cool relationship and the car was built to his liking, as he began improving on car setup and qualifying.

He led the (the season&#x27;s third round) after passing Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher until a rear-end collision with Arrows&#x27; Jos Verstappen (whom he had just lapped) forced him to retire. Montoya earned his first podium result and points by placing second in the two races later. He repeated the feat four rounds later at the and added points two races later by finishing fourth in the . Montoya took his maiden pole position at the and led until a refuelling issue at a pit stop forced him to retire with an engine failure. His second career pole position was at the , although he stalled at the start due to more engine trouble. Montoya began the from pole position and led 29 of its 53 laps in his maiden victory and the first for a Colombian in F1. He finished second in the season-ending for sixth in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship (WDC) with 31 points.

Montoya remained at Williams for the 2002 season. His FW24-BMW car was faster in qualifying but slower in the race because his Michelin tyres wore out faster than the Bridgestone compounds. Montoya scored points in the first six races, including podiums in Australia, Malaysia, Spain and Austria and qualified on pole position in Brazil, where he collided with Michael Schumacher on the first lap. He took pole position for the next five races, retiring from the first three and scored points in the last two, including a podium finish at the . Montoya claimed two more podium finishes in Germany, Belgium and took pole position in Italy during the final six rounds. He was third in the WDC with 50 points.

Montoya signed a two-year contract extension to stay with Williams through the end of the 2004 season in mid-2002. His FW25-BMW car was enhanced during the 2003 championship, with the consequent mechanical and aerodynamic changes making it F1&#x27;s fastest car, particularly when racing in hotter conditions due to benefitting from the Michelin tyres that the team used. He led the season-opening until a late-race spin cost him the win to McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard and dropped him to second. Montoya added seven more points in the following five races, finishing seventh in San Marino and fourth in Spain. Engineer Frank Dernie&#x27;s mid-season improvements made the FW25 car competitive, and Montoya won the . Montoya would put together a title challenge by finishing on the podium in the next seven races, a run that included winning his second and final race of 2003, the , by over a minute from pole position, a result which moved him into second position in the WDC. His performance declined after the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile required Michelin to redesign their tyres after it announced changes to the methodology of measuring tyre width, and he was mathematically eliminated from title contention at the season&#x27;s penultimate round when a drive-through penalty for a third lap collision with Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello at the left him to finish down in sixth place. Montoya would end his strongest season in F1 third in the WDC with 82 points, 11 points short of the title.

Montoya&#x27;s FW26-BMW 2004 car was slow and did not have enough downforce to give him confidence driving into corners as Williams switched from a single-keel to a twin-keel chassis design as well as a front wing design dubbed the &quot;Walrus nose&quot; that was dropped for a more conventional design before the . He gained points in all but two of the first seven rounds, finishing second in Malaysia and third in San Marino. Montoya was disqualified from fifth in the because his Williams car had oversized brake ducts and was disqualified from the following for changing cars on the starting grid too late in the time available. After that, he scored points in eight of the final nine races, including winning the season-ending . Montoya took fifth in the WDC with 58 points.

=== 2005–2006 (McLaren) ===

His relationship with Williams worsened when he verbally abused their engineers over the radio, believing that pit stop tactics during the 2003 French Grand Prix allowed his teammate Ralf Schumacher to win. Montoya signed a contract with McLaren to replace Coulthard for the 2005 season in August 2003; Frank Williams rejected McLaren team principal Ron Dennis&#x27; offer to release Montoya immediately because he did not want to do it a year before his existing contract with Williams expired. He was also upset that Williams might keep Ralf Schumacher, which he believed would stop him from becoming World Champion. Montoya spent time during the off-season losing weight and raising his fitness levels by switching to a new training regimen and a low-carbohydrate diet to improve his performance after encouragement from Dennis.
Kimi Räikkönen was his teammate and had a cordial personal relationship with him. Montoya&#x27;s MP4-20 car struggled to quickly generate heat into its tyres, limiting its effectiveness in qualifying early in the season. Subsequent car modifications, such as suspension tweaks, allowed him to be gentle on the tyres and extract extra speed. After scoring points in the first two races, he missed the Bahrain and San Marino Grands Prix due to a hairline fracture in his left scapula, and was replaced by Pedro de la Rosa and Alexander Wurz, respectively. Montoya was not fully recovered when he returned, and scored points in three of the next six races before being disqualified from the for passing a red light at the end of the pit lane. He did, however, win the and took podium finishes in both the German and . Montoya won the from pole position, then scored a second consecutive pole in Belgium before winning his third (and final) race of 2005 in Brazil. He could not help McLaren win the World Constructors&#x27; Championship as he retired on the first lap of the after hitting the barrier to avoid an accident and struck a raised drain cover at the while running fourth. Montoya was fourth in the WDC with 60 points.
Montoya remained at McLaren for the 2006 season, but it did not exercise their option to keep him for the 2007 championship in December 2005 since he had a strained relationship with both Dennis and Martin Whitmarsh. He struggled to drive the MP4-21 car because of its understeer, tyre temperature warming problems, and power loss caused by the switch from V10 to V8 engine regulations. Montoya was outpaced by Räikkönen, and scored points in five of the first nine races, including a third-place in San Marino and a second-place in Monaco. He was involved in an eight-car accident on the first lap of the , colliding with the rear of Räikkönen&#x27;s car and then going into Button&#x27;s Honda. Montoya left F1 following the race and was replaced by De La Rosa for the rest of the season. He was eighth in the WDC with 26 points.

==NASCAR==
===2006–2009===
Montoya did not want to race for McLaren and preferred American-based racing; he despised F1&#x27;s politics and its car and team-based focus on victory. He discussed moving to NASCAR with CGR with Felix Sabates in June 2006. Montoya spoke with his father, who persuaded him to switch series, and signed a multi-year contract on 9 July to replace Casey Mears in CGR&#x27;s No. 42 Dodge Charger from the start of 2007; Ganassi did not want to sign a younger driver. He informed Dennis of the news and was promptly sidelined from McLaren since he made the statement without informing the team first. Montoya was released from his McLaren contract four weeks early thanks to DaimlerChrysler&#x27;s intervention and a rumoured $5 million compensation from Ganassi. He rejected an offer to return to F1 with Toro Rosso after telling team principal Franz Tost that he was focused on NASCAR. Montoya began an intensive training regimen to prepare for the following season, and was advised by other NASCAR drivers, including Mark Martin on how to give drivers space.

Montoya made his stock car racing debut in the Food World 250 (part of the ARCA Re/Max Series developmental championship) at Talladega Superspeedway as preparation for his first full-time NASCAR season, starting second and finishing third. Montoya entered the following Prairie Meadows 250 at Iowa Speedway, finishing 24th after starting third due to a collision with Steve Wallace. He made his NASCAR debut in the Sam&#x27;s Town 250 of the Busch Series at Memphis Motorsports Park, driving CGR&#x27;s No. 42 Dodge, and competed in the final three 2006 Busch Series races. Montoya had his best Busch Series start and finish of 2006 at Memphis, starting ninth and finishing eleventh. He made his Nextel Cup Series debut in CGR&#x27;s No. 30 Dodge at Homestead–Miami Speedway in the season-ending Ford 400 because Ganassi did not put him in Mears&#x27; No. 42 car to ensure his qualification. Montoya started 29th at Homestead, but his car caught fire after Ryan Newman hit the back of his vehicle, sending him into the barrier.

Constant testing prepared him for his first full-time NASCAR season in 2007, and developed a rapport with his crew chief Donnie Wingo. Montoya frustrated approaching drivers by blocking them when he was one lap down. He was outperformed by both the Hendrick Motorsports and Joe Gibbs Racing teams resource-wise and had difficulty handling the Dodge Avenger model of the Car of Tomorrow that was unbalanced when amongst packs of cars. Wingo sent Montoya onto a track early in the season in a car with understeer before modifying its setup to boost speed by allowing the rear end to swing out through corners.

He qualified 36th for the season-opening Daytona 500, finishing 19th following handling issues and avoiding a multi-car accident on its final lap. Following three sub-par races, Montoya earned his first career top-five finish in the Kobalt Tools 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway that March. He finished seventh in the Samsung 500 at Texas Motor Speedway after colliding with Tony Stewart. Montoya started 32nd in the Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Infineon Raceway and led the final seven laps after passing Jamie McMurray for his first career Cup Series victory, becoming the series&#x27; first foreign-born winner since Earl Ross in 1974. He started and finished second in the Brickyard 400 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway four races later. The rest of the season yielded two top-tens at Dover International Speedway and Martinsville Speedway for 20th in the final championship standings with 3,487 points. He won rookie of the year honours by 24 points over David Ragan.

Montoya drove the No. 42 CGR Dodge in 17 Busch Series races in 2007 to gain experience on tracks where he also competed in the Cup Series. He led a race-high 43 laps in the Telcel-Motorola Mexico 200 at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez before bumping his CGR teammate Scott Pruett with eight laps remaining for his first NASCAR victory and become the first foreign-born NASCAR winner since Ron Fellows in 2001. Montoya finished two more races in the top ten, at Atlanta and Talladega, and his best start of the season was second at Watkins Glen International, where he finished 33rd following a crash. He drove for CGR in the renamed Nationwide Series for two rounds late in the 2008 season, finishing outside the top ten in both races.

He returned to drive CGR&#x27;s No. 42 car for the 2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. Montoya was 32nd in the Daytona 500 despite running as high as second late in the race. CGR&#x27;s decline in performance meant he had no top ten finishes or qualified within the top ten, leading to criticism from Ganassi. Jimmy Elledge became Montoya&#x27;s crew chief after Wingo was moved to teammate Reed Sorenson&#x27;s squad before being replaced by Brian Pattie. This irritated Montoya, who openly questioned CGR&#x27;s commitment, and he requested a face-to-face meeting with Ganassi in May 2008, during which his feelings were soothed. They promised to work together regularly to make Montoya more competitive. His best season result was a second-place finish in the Aaron&#x27;s 499 at Talladega. Although Montoya continued to struggle performance-wise attributed in part to the closure of teammate Franchitti&#x27;s squad due to sponsorship issues, he finished in the top ten at both road course races (sixth and fourth in the Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Infineon and the Centurion Boats at the Glen at Watkins Glen, respectively). He took pole position for the Camping World RV 400 at Kansas Speedway, but his lap was disallowed due to excessive gas pressure in his rear shock absorbers. Montoya was 25th in the final championship standings, with 3,329 points.

Due to the Great Recession, CGR merged with Dale Earnhardt, Inc. (DEI) before the 2009 season to form Earnhardt Ganassi Racing (EGR), and Montoya began driving a Chevrolet Impala run by DEI. He rejected offers from other NASCAR teams, and a contract from Tost to return to F1 with Toro Rosso since his family felt comfortable in the United States. During the season, Montoya won no races but was more competitive and consistent with ten top-ten finishes and improved his qualifying performances in the first 26 races, and drove better on most types of tracks (including oval tracks) by racing conservatively and Pattie convincing him to replace aggressive race setups and on-track risks with long-term thinking and intelligent driving. This was due to his car&#x27;s increased power, his developing experience and patience, and Pattie&#x27;s calm demeanour. Montoya had been enough acquainted with the Car of Tomorrow by mid-2009, when he adjusted his driving style to slow down in order to be faster. In the Aaron&#x27;s 499 at Talladega, he qualified on pole for the first time in his Cup Series career before finishing second in the Sunoco Red Cross Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono Raceway. He was 10th in points after the second race at Richmond Raceway and qualified for the Chase for the Sprint Cup. A pole position in the Sylvania 300 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway along with six top-ten finishes put him as high as third place in the standings but was eliminated from title contention after a series of accidents. He was eighth overall with 6,252 points.

===2010–2014===
Montoya returned to race with EGR for the 2010 season but a new car spoiler slowed him. He qualified better and increased his average finishing position over the first 21 races of the season, with eight top-ten finishes, two pole positions, and the took the lead of races more frequently due to faster pace. Montoya missed out on the Sprint Cup Chase due to a series of accident, a lack of consistency, and a poor team strategy. Montoya qualified on pole for both the Lenox Industrial Tools 301 in New Hampshire and the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis, but crashed in both races. Montoya started third in the Heluva Good! Sour Cream Dips at the Glen at Watkins Glen and led 74 of the race&#x27;s 90 laps to take his second (and final) Cup Series victory. The rest of the season saw him claim five more top-ten finishes and pole position for the AMP Energy Juice 500 at Talladega. He was 17th in the final standings with 4,118 points.

Montoya returned to the Sprint Cup Series for a fifth full-time season with EGR in the 2011 championship, but his performance suffered as a result of NASCAR mandating a nose change. He started 13th in the Daytona 500 and led for five laps before finishing sixth. Montoya finished third in the Kobalt Tools 400 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway two races later, his best finish of the season. Montoya qualified on pole position for the Auto Club 400 at Auto Club Speedway and in the Crown Royal Presents the Matthew and Daniel Hansen 400 at Richmond in his first short oval track pole. Following Montoya&#x27;s inconsistency in the first half of the season, which saw him drop down the points standings throughout the year, Ganassi replaced Pattie as the driver&#x27;s crew chief by Jim Pohlman without Montoya&#x27;s substantial participation before the Brickyard 400 that July. He ended the 36-race season 21st overall with 932 points after eight top-ten finishes and no race wins.

He approached EGR regarding a long-term contract renewal in early 2011, expressing his desire to remain with the team, particularly Ganassi. He remained with EGR for the 2012 season and was assigned Chris Heroy as his new crew chief after Ganassi restructured his team. Montoya&#x27;s trailing arm snapped during the season-opening Daytona 500, causing him to crash sideways into the rear of a jet dryer transporting jet fuel and catching fire. During the season, he only had two top-ten finishes, which were eighth-place finishes at Bristol Motor Speedway and Michigan. Montoya had his best start of the season with pole position in both the Pennsylvania 400 at Pocono and in the Finger Lakes 355 at The Glen at Watkins Glen. He was 22nd in the drivers&#x27; standings with a total of 810 points.

Montoya remained with EGR for the 2013 season, driving the Generation 6 Chevrolet SS and switching engine manufacturers from Richard Childress Racing to Hendrick Motorsports. He was slowed by mechanical problems and was involved in crashes in five of the first seven races of the season. Montoya started sixth and finished fourth in the Toyota Owners 400 at Richmond after leading 67 laps due to a late race caution. Four races later, he took his best result of the season with a second-place finish in the FedEx 400 at Dover after leading 19 laps and being overtaken by Stewart with three laps to go. Montoya was set to finish second in the Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Sonoma but he ran out of fuel on the final lap and finished 34th. The rest of the season saw him secure five more top-ten finishes, with a best performance of third at Bristol. Montoya finished his final full-time Sprint Cup Series season 21st in the points standings, with 891.

Midway through the 2014 Sprint Cup Series, he drove Team Penske&#x27;s third No. 12 Ford Fusion in two races (the Quicken Loans 400 in Michigan and the Brickyard 400 in Indianapolis). Montoya finished outside of the top ten positions in both races.

===2024===
Although he had stepped away from full-time racing and concentrated on podcasting and mentoring his son Sebastián in his racing career, Montoya returned to NASCAR after a ten-year absence to compete on a one-off basis at the 2024 Go Bowling at The Glen driving 23XI Racing&#x27;s No. 50 Toyota Camry XSE after accepting an offer from team president Steve Lauletta. He qualified 34th for the race and finished in 32nd.

==IndyCar Series==
===2014–2016===
He was told in August 2013 that EGR would not renew his contract for the 2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, and talked to Andretti Autosport about driving for them in the IndyCar Series as well as Furniture Row Racing in lieu of Kurt Busch in NASCAR, but he declined both offers. Montoya joined Penske in the 2014 IndyCar Series after meeting president Tim Cindric at Michigan that year. He shed since the previous summer, modified his workout programme to increase his fitness in order to cope with the demands of open-wheel car racing, which he had to reacquaint himself with, and Team Penske acquired sponsorship financing to run his car in eight of the planned races.

Montoya drove the No. 2 Dallara DW12-Chevrolet car. He performed well on oval circuits but qualified worse on road and street circuits due to a lack of pre-season testing on Firestone&#x27;s alternate Red compound tyre, which was not made accessible to teams by the manufacturer or IndyCar, but could improve his finishing position. Montoya had five top-ten finishes in the season&#x27;s first ten races, including a second-place in the first race at the Grand Prix of Houston. He qualified on pole for the Pocono IndyCar 500 and overtook Tony Kanaan with four laps remaining to win the fastest 500-mile race in IndyCar history with an average speed of and his first IndyCar victory in nearly 14 years. Montoya finished the season with three more top-fives, including a second-place at Milwaukee, and was fourth overall with 586 points.

He continued driving for Penske in the 2015 IndyCar Series, improving his performance in qualifying from the previous season. Montoya started fourth and led the final 27 laps of the season-opening Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg, holding off Penske teammate Will Power to win the race and take the points lead. He qualified on pole for the Indy Grand Prix of Louisiana at NOLA Motorsports Park and led 31 laps before pit stops and two caution periods dropped him to fifth place. Montoya then finished third in the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach and the Grand Prix of Indianapolis. His season highlight was winning the Indianapolis 500 for the second time. Montoya battled Power and CGR&#x27;s Scott Dixon for the win in the final laps, eventually passing Power with three laps to go. Following that, he continuously finished in the top ten in the next six rounds as he drove conservatively until an accident at Iowa caused by suspension failure dropped him to 24th, although he retained the points lead due to other drivers&#x27; issues. Montoya&#x27;s third-place finish at Pocono made him one of six drivers eligible for the championship at the season-ending GoPro Grand Prix of Sonoma. He finished sixth following a collision with Power and ended the season with the same number of points as Dixon (556) but lost the championship on tiebreak to Dixon, who had won three races to Montoya&#x27;s two.

For the 2016 IndyCar Series, he raced for Penske. Montoya&#x27;s average qualifying performance dropped from the previous season, however he occasionally raced quicker during a race after a poor qualifying. He started third and led 44 of the 110 laps of the Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg before passing teammate Simon Pagenaud to win. Montoya started third and led 56 laps in the following Desert Diamond West Valley Phoenix Grand Prix in Phoenix when a flat tyre forced an early pit stop and left him to ninth place, moving Pagenaud into the championship lead. He took three more top-tens before an early racing collision in the Indianapolis 500 left him in 33rd, putting him in a points deficit. Montoya end the season with five top-tens, and he placed third at Sonoma for eighth in the drivers&#x27; standings with 433 points.

===2017–2022===
Cindric informed him in July 2016 that his future at Penske did not necessarily imply that he would race for them full-time in IndyCar. Montoya was given a spot in Penske&#x27;s fifth entry for the 2017 Indianapolis 500, but he discussed returning to CGR as well as joining Ed Carpenter Racing, A. J. Foyt Racing, or Andretti Autosport for the entire season. He did not reach an agreement with any other teams and remained at Penske for the Indianapolis 500 because he felt the team would give him the best chance of winning. Montoya entered both the IndyCar Grand Prix and the Indianapolis 500 in the 2017 IndyCar Series. He finished tenth in the first round and sixth in the Indianapolis 500 despite running out of fuel before a pit stop.

IndyCar chose Montoya to be the test driver of Chevrolet&#x27;s specification of the Dallara universal aerodynamic kit at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course, Iowa Speedway, and a street circuit simulation at Sebring International Raceway before the kit&#x27;s debut in the 2018 season. He talked about driving for Schmidt Peterson Motorsports in the 2018 Indianapolis 500, but team owner Sam Schmidt was told that team owner Roger Penske had vetoed such an agreement. Montoya would miss the race, focusing solely on his sports car career. Montoya talked to McLaren CEO Zak Brown about racing for his team in the 2019 Indianapolis 500, but could not do so as he was under contract to Penske.

Montoya drove Arrow McLaren SP&#x27;s No. 86 Dallara-Chevrolet third car in the 2021 IndyCar Series for the GMR Grand Prix and the Indianapolis 500. He qualified outside the top 20 in both races and finished 21st and 9th, respectively. Montoya drove the No. 6 Arrow McLaren SP car in both the GMR Grand Prix and the Indianapolis 500 during the 2022 season. He finished 24th in the weather-affected GMR Grand Prix following an accident, and 11th in the Indianapolis 500 after starting 30th.

==Sports car racing==

Montoya made his professional endurance debut in the 2007 24 Hours of Daytona (part of the Rolex Sports Car Series), winning after 668 laps in the No. 1 Chip Ganassi Racing with Felix Sabates (CGRFS) Riley MkXI-Lexus Daytona Prototype (DP) car he shared with Salvador Durán and Pruett. The following year, he won the 2008 24 Hours of Daytona for the second successive year, this time with Franchitti, Pruett and Memo Rojas after 695 laps. Montoya returned to CGRFS for the 2009 24 Hours of Daytona, partnering with Pruett and Rojas in a Riley MkXX-Lexus DP car and finishing second overall after losing the win to Brumos Racing by a record-close 0.167 seconds. He partook in the 24 Hours of Daytona in the No. 2 Riley MkXX-BMW with Dixon, Franchitti and McMurray from 2010 to 2012. They were 37th in 2010 after mechanical failure, but came second and fourth in 2011 and 2012, respectively.

Montoya, Dixon, and McMurray finished fourth in the Rolex Sports Car Series&#x27; three-hour Brickyard Grand Prix in Indianapolis in July 2012. He, Charlie Kimball, Pruett and Rojas won the 2013 24 Hours of Daytona in CGRFS&#x27; No. 01 Riley MkXXVI-BMW DP car, completing 709 laps. Montoya was invited by Porsche to participate in the post-season FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) rookie test in a 919 Hybrid at the Bahrain International Circuit in November 2015. He guest tested a Risi Competizione-entered Ferrari 488 GTE in a test session at Sebring the month before the 2017 12 Hours of Sebring (part of the IMSA SportsCar Championship). To prepare for the 2018 IMSA SportsCar Championship in an Acura ARX-05 car in the Daytona Prototype International (DPi) category, Montoya drove the final round of the 2017 season, the Petit Le Mans, in the No. 6 Oreca 07-Gibson Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) car alongside Hélio Castroneves and Pagenaud. Their car started on pole position and finished third overall after Castroneves collided with Matteo Cressoni&#x27;s Ferrari.

He officially joined Penske&#x27;s IMSA programme in August 2017, having previously expressed interest in IMSA. Montoya shared the No. 6 car by Dane Cameron for the season and Pagenaud for three endurance races. Mechanical issues hampered his performance in the first two races, the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring. Montoya took pole position for the BUBBA Burger Sports Car Grand Prix and led 23 laps before finishing fifth. He finished in the top ten five more times before crashing in the second hour of the Petit Le Mans, leaving his car 32nd overall. Montoya was fifth in both the Prototype Drivers&#x27; Championship (251 points) and the North American Endurance Cup (NAEC). In June, he made his 24 Hours of Le Mans début in United Autosports&#x27; No. 32 Ligier JS P217-Gibson car with Hugo de Sadeleer and Will Owen. The car finished third in LMP2 and seventh overall.

Montoya returned to Penske for the 2019 season in the new DPi category, accompanied by Cameron for the year and Pagenaud for three endurance events. His performance improved as he and Cameron focused more on a common chassis setup that did not favour one driver over another. Montoya finished no worse than ninth in the first three races of the season before his first IMSA victory in the Acura Sports Car Challenge at Mid-Ohio after leading 88 laps from third. He took his second successive win in the Chevrolet Sports Car Classic in Detroit, starting from pole position. Montoya then took three straight podium finishes before winning the Monterey Grand Prix at Laguna Seca after leading a race-high 75 laps. Finishing fourth at the season-ending Petit Le Mans earned him and Cameron the DPi Drivers&#x27; Championship with 302 points, and they were sixth in the NAEC.

For the 2020 championship, Montoya returned to Penske&#x27;s programme and was paired with Cameron for that year, with Pagenaud serving as the endurance driver. He started the season fourth at the 24 Hours of Daytona and finished no worse than ninth in the final eight rounds and qualifying on pole three times. He took sixth in the DPi Drivers&#x27; Championship with 247 points and was third in the NAEC. Montoya drove the No. 21 DragonSpeed USA Oreca 07-Gibson entry for the 2020 24 Hours of Le Mans alongside Timothé Buret and Rojas after an arrangement with Pipo Derani fell through. The car was retired after 192 laps due to a misfire.

Montoya joined Meyer Shank Racing with Curb-Agajanian in the 2021 IMSA SportsCar Championship as an endurance driver of its No. 60 Acura ARX-05 car alongside A. J. Allmendinger, Cameron, Castroneves, and Olivier Pla and was part of DragonSpeed USA&#x27;s No. 21 WEC team with Ben Hanley and Henrik Hedman. He finished in the top ten of all three IMSA races he entered. Montoya finished fourth in the Endurance Trophy for LMP2 Pro/Am Drivers with 138 points in the 2021 WEC season after finishing no lower than fifth in each of the season&#x27;s six races and winning his class in the 2021 24 Hours of Le Mans. He was invited to compete in the European Le Mans Series&#x27; (ELMS) 4 Hours of Monza for DragonSpeed with Hanley and Hedman in July, finishing 17th overall.

Montoya shared the No. 81 DragonSpeed – 10Star Oreca LMP2 car for six points-scoring races in the 2022 IMSA SportsCar Championship with Hedman and his son Sebastián. He finished no lower than eighth in class in those six events and won his category in the Lexus Grand Prix at Mid-Ohio. Montoya finished fourth in the LMP2 Drivers&#x27; Championship with 1878 points and seventh in the NAEC. He was scheduled to enter three races of the 2023 IMSA SportsCar Championship in Rick Ware Racing&#x27;s No. 51 Oreca car alongside Eric Lux. Montoya returned to compete with DragonSpeed in the entire ELMS season in 2023 alongside Hedman and Sebastián, ending the season seventh in the LMP2 Pro-Am points standings with 44 scored and a best class finish of fifth twice.

== Race of Champions ==

Montoya has twice competed in the Race of Champions. He had previously declined invites to the event, but agreed to compete in the 2017 Race of Champions at Marlins Park in Miami on his wife&#x27;s suggestion, and won the Race of Champions by defeating Tom Kristensen 2–0 in the final. Team Colombia&#x27;s Montoya and Gabby Chaves were eliminated in the Nations Cup semi-finals by Team Germany&#x27;s Sebastian Vettel. He was eliminated by Kristensen in the Race of Champions quarterfinals, and he and Castroneves finished second against Team Germany&#x27;s Timo Bernhard and René Rast in the Nations Cup at the King Fahd International Stadium in Riyadh in 2018.

==Driving style==

He has had an aggressive driving style since childhood, which led to him being involved in numerous incidents in NASCAR. Driver Derek Daly wrote that Montoya lacked technical knowledge of a racing car because he was not taught by a championship or a racing squad and needed two or three engineers to compensate for his inability to provide accurate technical feedback, which became more apparent as his F1 career progressed. He observed that the driver denied having such a flaw and frequently blamed other variables for his poor performance. Daly, however, stated that Montoya relied heavily on reflexes and intuition during his youth racing and CART career. &quot;Autosport&quot;&#x27;s Nigel Roebuck observed in November 2004 that Montoya was emotionally driven and impervious to being pressured from behind.

==Non-racing ventures and recognition==
Montoya has been represented by the management firms CSS Stellar and William Morris Agency. He has been an ambassador for the Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer, and the Miami Grand Prix. Montoya was made a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations (UN) in October 2001 and helped to raise funding for the World Food Programme to feed children displaced by the Colombian conflict. Upon becoming an UN Goodwill Ambassador, he and his wife established the non-profit Fundación Formula Sonrisas (English: Formula Smiles Foundation) in 2003 and focuses on reducing gender and social inequality by educating children living in the deprived areas of Colombia through sport and physical education.

Montoya married law graduate Connie Freydell in Cartagena, Colombia on 26 October 2002. They have three children, one of them, Sebastián, is also a racing driver. He builds and flies radio-controlled aircraft. Montoya made a cameo appearance as a racing driver in the 2001 film &quot;Driven.&quot; He began working for Motorsport.tv as a presenter providing insight and opinions in news programmes and be part of its creative team for long-form documentaries in May 2021. In early November 2013, the Internal Revenue Service stated that he owed US$2.7 million in additional taxes and penalties due to disallowed deductions from 2007 and 2008. Montoya stated that he had earned $800,000 more than his reported income, but filed a challenge to the audit in the United States Tax Court.

He received the Order of Boyacá and the Order of José Acevedo y Gómez in 1999; the Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year in 2000; the Rookie of the Year and the International Driver of the Year at the Autosport Awards in 2001 and 2003; and the Colombian Athlete of the Year in 2001; Montoya also won the Laureus World Sports Award for Breakthrough of the Year, the Ibero-American Community Trophy as the best Ibero-American athlete and the Lorenzo Bandini Trophy &quot;in recognition of his achievements for his debut season in Formula One last year&quot; in 2002. He was voted the top Latin American driver at the Premios Fox Sports Awards in both 2003 and 2005. Montoya was inducted into the Miami Sports Hall of Champions in 2011 and the Long Beach Motorsports Walk of Fame in 2018. The Kartódromo Juan Pablo Montoya in Tocancipá is named after him.

<doc id="164993" wikidata="Q507991" url="?curid=164993" title="Algernon Blackwood">
<text>Algernon Henry Blackwood, CBE (14 March 1869 – 10 December 1951) was an English broadcasting narrator, journalist, novelist and short story writer, and among the most prolific ghost story writers in the history of the genre. The literary critic S. T. Joshi stated, &quot;His work is more consistently meritorious than any weird writer&#x27;s except Dunsany&#x27;s&quot; and that his short story collection &quot;Incredible Adventures&quot; (1914) &quot;may be the premier weird collection of this or any other century&quot;.

==Life and work==
Blackwood was born in Shooter&#x27;s Hill (now part of southeast London, then part of northwest Kent). Between 1871 and 1880, he lived at Crayford Manor House, Crayford and he was educated at Wellington College. His father, Sir Stevenson Arthur Blackwood, was a Post Office administrator; his mother, Harriet Dobbs, was the widow of the 6th Duke of Manchester. According to Peter Penzoldt, his father, &quot;though not devoid of genuine good-heartedness, had appallingly narrow religious ideas&quot;. After Algernon read the work of a Hindu sage left behind at his parents&#x27; house, he developed an interest in Buddhism and other eastern philosophies.

Blackwood had a varied career, working as a dairy farmer in Canada, where he also operated a hotel for six months, as a newspaper reporter in New York City, bartender, model, journalist for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, private secretary, businessman, and violin teacher. During his time in Canada, he also became one of the founding members of Toronto Theosophical Society in February 1891. Throughout his adult life, he was an occasional essayist for periodicals. In his late thirties, he moved back to England and started to write stories of the supernatural. He was successful, writing at least ten original collections of short stories and later telling them on radio and television. He also wrote 14 novels, several children&#x27;s books and a number of plays, most of which were produced, but not published. He was an avid lover of nature and the outdoors, as many of his stories reflect. To satisfy his interest in the supernatural, he joined The Ghost Club. He never married; according to his friends he was a loner, but also cheerful company.

Jack Sullivan stated that &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s life parallels his work more neatly than perhaps that of any other ghost story writer. Like his lonely but fundamentally optimistic protagonists, he was a combination of mystic and outdoorsman; when he wasn&#x27;t steeping himself in occultism, including Rosicrucianism, or Buddhism he was likely to be skiing or mountain climbing.&quot; Blackwood was a member of one of the factions of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, as was his contemporary Arthur Machen. Cabalistic themes influence his novel &quot;The Human Chord&quot;.

His two best-known stories are probably &quot;The Willows&quot; and &quot;The Wendigo&quot;. He would also often write stories for newspapers at short notice, with the result that he was unsure exactly how many short stories he had written and there is no sure total. Though Blackwood wrote a number of horror stories, his most typical work seeks less to frighten than to induce a sense of awe. Good examples are the novels &quot;The Centaur&quot;, which reaches a climax with a traveller&#x27;s sight of a herd of the mythical creatures; and &quot;Julius LeVallon&quot; and its sequel &quot;The Bright Messenger&quot;, which deal with reincarnation and the possibility of a new, mystical evolution of human consciousness. In correspondence with Peter Penzoldt, Blackwood wrote,
My fundamental interest, I suppose, is signs and proofs of other powers that lie hidden in us all; the extension, in other words, of human faculty. So many of my stories, therefore, deal with extension of consciousness; speculative and imaginative treatment of possibilities outside our normal range of consciousness... Also, all that happens in our universe is &quot;natural&quot;; under Law; but an extension of our so limited normal consciousness can reveal new, extra-ordinary powers etc., and the word &quot;supernatural&quot; seems the best word for treating these in fiction. I believe it possible for our consciousness to change and grow, and that with this change we may become aware of a new universe. A &quot;change&quot; in consciousness, in its type, I mean, is something more than a mere extension of what we already possess and know.
==Autobiography==

Blackwood wrote an autobiography of his early years, &quot;Episodes Before Thirty&quot; (1923), and there is a biography, &quot;Starlight Man,&quot; by Mike Ashley ().

==Death==
Blackwood died after experiencing several strokes. Officially his death on 10 December 1951 was from cerebral thrombosis, with arteriosclerosis as a contributing factor. He was cremated at Golders Green crematorium. A few weeks later his nephew took his ashes to Saanenmöser Pass in the Swiss Alps, and scattered them in the mountains that he had loved for more than forty years.

==Legacy==

H. P. Lovecraft included Blackwood as one of the &quot;Modern Masters&quot; in the section of that name in &quot;Supernatural Horror in Literature&quot;. In &quot;The Books in My Life&quot;, Henry Miller chose Blackwood&#x27;s &quot;The Bright Messenger&quot; as &quot;the most extraordinary novel on psychoanalysis, one that dwarfs the subject.&quot; Authors who have been influenced by Blackwood&#x27;s work include William Hope Hodgson, George Allan England, H. Russell Wakefield, &quot;L. Adams Beck&quot; (Elizabeth Louisa Moresby), Margery Lawrence, Evangeline Walton, Ramsey Campbell and Graham Joyce.

In the first draft of his guidance notes to translators of his work, &quot;Nomenclature of The Lord of the Rings&quot;, J. R. R. Tolkien stated that he derived the phrase &quot;crack of doom&quot; from an unnamed story by Blackwood. In her book, &quot;Tolkien&#x27;s Modern Reading&quot;, Holly Ordway states that this unnamed Blackwood work is his 1909 novel &quot;The Education of Uncle Paul&quot;. She explains that the children of Paul&#x27;s sister, who he is visiting, tell him of the &quot;crack between Yesterday and To-morrow&quot;, and that &quot;if we&#x27;re &quot;very&quot; quick, we can find the crack and slip through... And, once inside there, there&#x27;s no time, of course... &quot;Anything&quot; may happen, and &quot;everything&quot; come true.&quot; Ordway comments that this would have attracted Tolkien because of his interest in travelling back in time.

Frank Belknap Long&#x27;s 1928 story &quot;The Space-Eaters&quot; alludes to Blackwood&#x27;s fiction. Clark Ashton Smith&#x27;s story &quot;Genius Loci&quot; (1933) was inspired by Blackwood&#x27;s story &quot;The Transfer&quot;. The plot of Caitlin R. Kiernan&#x27;s novel &quot;Threshold&quot; (2001) is influenced by Blackwood&#x27;s work. Kiernan has cited Blackwood as an important influence on her writing. Blackwood appears as a character in the novel &quot;The Curse of the Wendigo&quot; by Rick Yancey.

==Critical studies==

An early essay on Blackwood&#x27;s work was &quot;Algernon Blackwood: An Appreciation,&quot; by Grace Isabel Colbron (1869–1943), which appeared in &quot;The Bookman&quot; in February 1915.

Peter Penzoldt devotes the final chapter of &quot;The Supernatural in Fiction&quot; (1952) to an analysis of Blackwood&#x27;s work and dedicates the book &quot;with deep admiration and gratitude, to Algernon Blackwood, the greatest of them all&quot;. A critical analysis of Blackwood&#x27;s work appears in Jack Sullivan, &quot;Elegant Nightmares: The English Ghost Story From Le Fanu to Blackwood&quot;, 1978.

David Punter has written two essays on Blackwood. There is a critical essay on Blackwood&#x27;s work in S. T. Joshi&#x27;s &quot;The Weird Tale&quot; (1990). Edward Wagenknecht analyses Blackwood&#x27;s work in his book &quot;Seven Masters of Supernatural Fiction&quot;. Eugene Thacker, in his &quot;Horror of Philosophy&quot; series of books, discusses Blackwood&#x27;s stories &quot;The Willows&quot; and &quot;The Man Whom The Trees Loved&quot; as examples of how supernatural horror poses philosophical questions regarding the relation between human beings and the &quot;cosmic indifference&quot; of the world. 

Christopher Matthew Scott analyzes Blackwood&#x27;s use of Christian symbolism and story setting as connected to the author&#x27;s biography; describing a spiritual progression up from hellish city, through garden, forest, and mountain. Brian R. Hauser discusses Blackwood&#x27;s John Silence in the context of figures made popular by 1990s cinematic narratives, grouping him with Ichabod Crane and Fox Mulder, and classifying him as an early example of the supernatural detective whose investigation of a traumatized space mirrors a psychoanalyst&#x27;s investigation of a traumatized psyche. Henry Bartholomew includes the &quot;dark ecology&quot; of Blackwood&#x27;s &quot;Pan&#x27;s Garden&quot; in his discussion of speculative realism and the gothic.

<doc id="164997" wikidata="Q1087845" url="?curid=164997" title="Jacen Solo">
<text>Jacen Solo is a fictional character in literature based on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film series, set in what is now designated as the original-canon &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; continuity. The son of Han Solo and Leia Organa Solo, as well as the nephew of Luke Skywalker, he is a major character in several novels, particularly the &quot;New Jedi Order&quot; series. He becomes the antagonist of the &quot;Legacy of the Force&quot; series under the name Darth Caedus. Jacen&#x27;s other familial connections of note to his native continuity include being the brother of Jaina Solo and Anakin Solo as well as the cousin of Ben Skywalker.

Jacen has been noted as an influence for Kylo Ren, the canonical son of Han and Leia and villain of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; sequel trilogy, and Jacen Syndulla, the canonical son of Kanan Jarrus and Hera Syndulla from the epilogue series finale of &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;, later portrayed by Evan Whitten in &quot;Ahsoka&quot;.

==Fictional history==
===Childhood===
Jacen Solo was created for the &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy of novels by Timothy Zahn, set about five years after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. He is introduced as one of an unnamed pair of twins Leia is pregnant with in the first installment of the trilogy, the 1991 novel &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot;. In the third installment, the 1993 novel &quot;The Last Command&quot;, he is born five minutes after his sister Jaina on Coruscant. The twins, and eventually their younger brother Anakin, were sent to live at various safe havens, under the protection of Leia&#x27;s handmaiden, Winter.

In &quot;Jedi Search&quot;, the twins returned to Coruscant at age three and had many adventures there. Once, they became lost in the underworld of Imperial City with C-3PO, but they were quickly rescued and returned to their mother, the Chief of State of the New Republic.

In &quot;The Crystal Star&quot;, all three children were abducted, together with many other children with Force abilities, by Hethrir. Hethrir tried to brainwash them into becoming Dark Jedi in order to bring about the rebirth of the Galactic Empire, but the children defeated their captor.

===Jedi Academy years===

In the &quot;Young Jedi Knights&quot; series, Jacen travels to Yavin 4 with his sister to begin his Jedi training. Jacen discovers a strong connection to the Living Force — the concentration on the present moment — and can communicate with and calm many of the jungle creatures near the Academy. He even keeps a small menagerie of animals in his room in the Great Massassi Temple. He and his sister befriend the Wookiee Lowbacca (nicknamed Lowie by his friends) and the warrior princess Tenel Ka.

In &quot;Heirs of the Force&quot; and &quot;Shadow Academy&quot;, Jacen and Jaina discover a crashed TIE fighter from the Battle of Yavin. Jaina installs a hyperdrive in the downed starfighter and begins fixing it to fly again. Jacen, Lowbacca, and Tenel Ka help her to practice their Force skills until all are held captive by the TIE&#x27;s original pilot, Qorl, who had been living in the jungle for two decades. They eventually escape, but so does Qorl, leaving the jungle moon behind and searching for any remnants of the Galactic Empire. Qorl discovers the Shadow Academy, a training ground for Dark Jedi commanded by one of Luke Skywalker&#x27;s fallen students, Brakiss, along with the remains of the Dathomiri Nightsisters. These elements of the so-called Second Imperium kidnap Jacen, Jaina and Lowbacca, but they resist the dark side and are rescued by Luke Skywalker and Tenel Ka.

The friends return to Coruscant for a short vacation, and are reunited with the twins&#x27; childhood friend Zekk. They are forced to fight Jacen and Jaina several times, and the twins and their friends finally progress far enough to be tasked with building their first lightsabers. Jacen uses a corusca gem he had gained earlier for his focusing crystal.

Jacen&#x27;s hard-learned lesson hits home once again in &quot;Lightsabers&quot;, when Tenel Ka rushes to complete her lightsaber to keep up with her friends. She uses an imperfect crystal and her blade shorts out in a sparring match with Jacen. His lightsaber passes through thin air where her weapon had been seconds before and severs the young woman&#x27;s arm. Though she bears him no ill will for the accident, Jacen is wracked with guilt.

In &quot;Darkest Knight&quot;, the twins and Tenel Ka go to Kashyyyk with Lowbacca to witness his sister&#x27;s adulthood rites. In &quot;Jedi Under Siege&quot;, the Jedi trainees and the Shadow Academy have their final confrontation on Yavin 4. The twins, with help from Luke and Zekk, bring down the Shadow Academy and the Second Imperium forever.

Throughout the series, Jacen and Jaina continue their training at Yavin 4, meeting new friends like Raynar Thul. They cannot convince Zekk to stay at the Academy with them, but Jacen and Jaina remain friends with him. With his and Raynar&#x27;s help, they discover a threat to the New Republic: the Diversity Alliance, an alien, anti-human group. The Alliance is building up massive support among peoples that had been oppressed by the Empire. They are led by a Twi&#x27;lek Nolaa Tarkona, the sister of Oola, who was murdered by Jabba the Hutt in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;.

In &quot;Jedi Bounty&quot;, Jacen, Jaina, and their friends are briefly held captive on Ryloth and have to escape to its harsh surface. They have gone there in an attempt to rescue Lowbacca, who had misguidedly joined the anti-human Diversity Alliance. In the following book, &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Plague&quot;, they get to the bottom of a plot they had suspected all along, and catch up with Raynar&#x27;s father, Bornan Thul, to race the Diversity Alliance fleet to an Imperial storehouse hidden in the deep core. There is hidden a supply of deadly diseases created by General Evir Derricote almost two decades before. Tarkona wishes to unleash a plague against humans and wipe them all out, but the Jedi and Alliance dissidents defeat her. She succumbs to one of the diseases herself on a faraway planet. Bornan Thul dies from one of the plagues right before his son&#x27;s eyes.

In &quot;Return to Ord Mantell&quot;, they go on a trip with their father to the titular planet to watch a race. There, they run into Czethros, a bounty hunter who once hunted Han. They are ambushed by agents, but are helped by Anja Gallandro, a young woman who wields a lightsaber, though she is not a Jedi. Although attracted to Tenel Ka, Jacen becomes infatuated with the older woman. Anja had blamed Han Solo for killing her father, but Solo reveals that her father died in a trap while finding treasure.

In &quot;Trouble on Cloud City&quot;, they discover Czethros is a minor leader of Black Sun, and is trying to gather enough power to overcome the New Republic. Jacen, Tenel Ka, and Lowbacca are ambushed by several Black Sun mercenaries, and Jacen is almost killed.

In &quot;Crisis at Crystal Reef&quot;, Jaina attempts to help Kessel and capture Czetheros while Jacen rushes to help Anja with her spice addiction and help her with Black Sun. With help, Anja beats her addiction and accepts her father&#x27;s death. Jacen thinks Anja has Jedi potential, but it turns out she didn&#x27;t. He gets over his infatuation with Anja when she goes to work for Lando.

===Yuuzhan Vong War===
In the &quot;New Jedi Order&quot; series, Luke takes Jacen as his Jedi apprentice. Jacen learns much from Luke, though they disagree on many philosophical issues. Jacen believes in the Force not only as a tool, but as part of something greater. He tells his brother Anakin that the Force is a guide to find one&#x27;s place in destiny.

When the Yuuzhan Vong attack the New Republic in &quot;Dark Tide: Onslaught&quot;, Jacen comes to believe that many Jedi are handling the threat too aggressively. He abandons his powers temporarily to contemplate the Force and butts heads with his father over the morality of &#x27;pirate&#x27; attacks on Peace Brigade vessels. Only his love for his mother brings Jacen back into the front lines of the battle. Eventually, Han and Jacen make their peace, the former declaring that while he doesn&#x27;t always understand his son, he is proud of him.

In &quot;Star by Star&quot; Jacen joins a daring mission to Myrkr. A Jedi strike force, led by Anakin, is to infiltrate a Yuuzhan Vong cloning facility where the invaders craft deadly Jedi-hunting beasts called Voxyn. The mission is a disaster, ending with Anakin&#x27;s death, in which Jaina reacts by touching the dark side of the Force. Forced into the leadership position, Jacen uses the Force Meld to bind the team together into a cohesive fighting unit. After destroying the voxyn queen, Jacen is captured by the Yuuzhan Vong army under the command of Vergere and Nom Anor. Jacen disappears, along with his presence in the Force.

In &quot;Traitor&quot;, Jacen awakes to find himself in the Embrace of Pain, a rack-like torture device favored by the Yuuzhan Vong. The torture nearly breaks Jacen&#x27;s spirit, until he learns to use the pain he suffers to sustain himself. He remains under the care and tutelage of the avian Vergere, who he learns had once been a Jedi of the Old Republic, and who had even met his grandfather, Anakin Skywalker.
He is put to work on Yuuzhan Vong ship, where he uses a number of herbs to heal slaves and get his captors to trust him. Using the implanted slave seed beneath his flesh as a conduit, Jacen communicates with the living instruments of Yuuzhan Vong technology. He uses this connection to stage a daring escape from captivity, commanding Yuuzhan Vong amphistaffs to surround him like living armor.

Jacen and Vergere flee to Coruscant. The planet&#x27;s entire surface is undergoing a radical transformation. Yuuzhan Vong organic growths cover the once gleaming metropolis, remaking the planet into a Yuuzhan Vong paradise. The world is to be their new capital, a recreation of the planet that had spawned them, Yuuzhan&#x27;tar.

Vergere removes the slave seed from Jacen, but he can still sense the Yuuzhan Vong. Jacen is later surrounded by Yuuzhan Vong warriors whom Vergere had led to him. Wanting revenge, Jacen channels his hatred for Vergere into Force lightning; he is frightened by this connection to the dark side, however, and runs away. Vergere finds him in his destroyed home and gives him back full use of the Force. He is once again surrounded by Yuuzhan Vong captors; left with no choice, he surrenders and agrees to join their cause. He becomes the &quot;khattazz al&#x27;Yun,&quot; or Avatar of God. Nom Anor intends to use Jacen to sacrifice Jaina, thus fulfilling an ancient Yuuzhan Vong prophecy.

Jacen&#x27;s true allegiance is his own, however. During a test of Jacen&#x27;s faith, the Yuuzhan Vong orders him to sacrifice captured Jedi Ganner Rhysode. Instead, the two Jedi turn against their captors. As Ganner holds off the Yuuzhan Vong, Jacen confronts the World Brain. The malevolent entity remembers the bond that Jacen had forged earlier, and Jacen suggests to it to work against the Yuuzhan Vong.

Ganner dies that day, though Jacen escapes with Vergere. He returns to the dwindling New Republic territories a different man: haggard, thin and hardened. He goes on a much needed vacation, but returns to frontline combat aboard the cruiser &quot;Ralroost&quot;. His ability to start the Jedi Meld is a large asset to Admiral Kre&#x27;fey, and Jacen joined the Alliance Fleet with elements of Garm Bel Iblis&#x27;s forces in a large-scale deception at Ebaq 9. The battle ends in a victory, but results in Vergere&#x27;s death. Her spectral form appears to him soon after.

As the newly formed Galactic Alliance emerged, Jacen accompanied his uncle Luke Skywalker into the Unknown Regions to seek a solution to the Yuuzhan Vong menace. Jacen would be instrumental in the search for Zonama Sekot and in the efforts to convince the living planet to join the fight against the Yuuzhan Vong. Jacen kills Supreme Overlord Onimi, who had been using Supreme Overlord Shimrra as a puppet, in a spectacular confrontation where the Force uses Jacen as a conduit to defeat Onimi, considering that Jacen was almost killed with just one hit by Shimrra himself, and in that moment Jacen started believing that he is beyond good and evil, marking the beginning of his fall. After the grueling final confrontation and the war&#x27;s end, Jacen tells Luke that he had decided to travel the galaxy to learn more about the Force.
While on his five-year journey Jacen enters a realm of the Force known as beyond shadows, thanks to his training with a sect called the Mind Walkers. 
In this realm Jacen gazes into the Pool of Knowledge that holds the Throne of Balance, (where in all future events are shown)
Jacen sees a dark man ruling the Galaxy and becomes determined to prevent this evil future. 
Following this experience, Jacen begins his descent to the dark side of the Force.

===Dark Nest Crisis===
In &quot;Dark Nest&quot;, Jacen feels an urge through the Force and follows his sister to the Unknown Regions to help the insectoid Killik against an invading Chiss force. He returns to Galactic Alliance space after his parents, resulting in his uncle and aunt to come for him, Jaina, and the other Jedi. He then travels to the Hapes Cluster to ask Tenel Ka to assist with the Chiss/Killik conflict, believing that the fleet could act as a buffer between the two armies. She obliges and sends a fleet of Hapan Battle Dragons to protect the Killiks.

In &quot;The Unseen Queen&quot;, Tenel Ka gives birth to his daughter, Allana, who is then attacked by the Gorog. Jacen successfully repels the attack and keeps his daughter safe. Possessed with a strong fear of his daughter or Tenel Ka being harmed, Jacen uses the Force to send Tenel Ka&#x27;s grandmother (the person behind the attack) into a coma. Immediately afterward, he sees a vision of a neverending war that will destroy the galaxy, with the Killiks at the heart of it. Determined to save his daughter and the galaxy from his vision, he sets out to provoke the Chiss into destroying the Killiks. Jacen later reveals that he never knew who started the war in his vision.

In &quot;The Swarm War&quot;, Luke Skywalker takes his nephew&#x27;s advice so many times that he even listens when Jacen tells him that he is not ready to face Lomi Plo, the Dark Queen of the Gorog. Jacen, Mara and Luke know that doubt and fear would make Lomi Plo invisible to her enemy. Jacen, along with R2-D2, helps Luke conquer some of his fears about Mara&#x27;s involvement with the death of his mother, and then accompanies him to face Plo.

During the fight with Plo, Luke falters for a moment when Mara is injured, and doubt enters his mind. Plo then holds him in place, unable to move. In that instant, Jacen is critically wounded by Plo while saving Mara Skywalker&#x27;s life. A well-placed shot from Mara injures Plo, after which Mara tends to Jacen&#x27;s wounds. While he and Mara recover, Jacen beseeches Luke to embrace his darker emotions. Luke refuses and goes back to the true Jedi way, defeating the Dark Queen and Raynar Thul without using the dark side.

In the latter novel, Jacen joins his uncle in watching holovideos of his grandparents, Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala; in particular, he sees Anakin fall to the dark side and Padmé die in childbirth partly as a result of Anakin&#x27;s treachery. (These scenes are first portrayed in &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;). Jacen actually sympathizes with Anakin&#x27;s desire to protect his wife, and reminds Luke that Anakin was a fallible human being.

===&quot;Legacy of the Force&quot;===
In &quot;Betrayal&quot;, Jacen starts training his young cousin Ben in the ways of the Force. After a successful mission to Adumar that ends in a life-threatening attack, they return for a dinner party at his parents&#x27; new home. There, Han voices his concern over Corellia trying to gain independence. Luke orders Jacen and Ben to disable the Centerpoint Station, an ancient artifact that Corellian leader (and Han&#x27;s cousin) Thrackan Sal-Solo is trying to use to his advantage. Ben disables the station while Jacen keeps Thrackan busy, ensuring the Galactic Alliance&#x27;s partial victory as another fleet built in secret spoils the main attack.

While travelling to a subterranean base, Ben and Nelani, a Jedi Knight, are forced out of a mining car. Their guide, Brisha Syo creates a dark side phantom of Luke Skywalker, who attacks and very nearly kills Jacen. Eventually, Brisha stops the projections and takes Jacen to an office, where Darth Vectivus, the supposed Sith Lord they are hunting, lives. After fighting Force projections with Ben, Nelani catches up with them. Brisha is revealed to be Lumiya, the Dark Lady of the Sith. She reveals that Vergere is a Sith apprentice, and that Jacen has already received Sith training. Lumiya says that Jacen is going to become the next Sith Lord. Unsure of his next move, Jacen uses the Force to create visions of the future. In each vision in which Lumiya is arrested, the galaxy is consumed in an endless war that eventually places Jacen against Luke. In the vision, Jacen kills his uncle.

Horrified, Jacen spares Lumiya. Nelani then tries to arrest the Sith, but Jacen intervenes. Jacen realizes that Nelani will, if allowed to survive, possibly fulfill the dark vision he had seen. He then fights and kills her, asking her forgiveness before striking the fatal blow. He agrees to consider what Lumiya had said and leaves the asteroid with an unconscious Ben. Jacen then erases Ben&#x27;s memories of Lumiya and tells him that both she and Nelani had been killed by dark side phantoms. They return to Coruscant; however, after Jacen departs, Lumiya says that she had won.

In &quot;Bloodlines&quot;, fully pledged to Lumiya, Jacen becomes head of the GFFA&#x27;s newly formed secret police, the Galactic Alliance Guard. With Ben at his side, he begins rounding up Corellians for internment and deportation. During an interrogation of a suspected assassin (who turns out to be Ailyn Vel, Boba Fett&#x27;s daughter), Jacen tries to use the Force to extract information from her and kills her accidentally in the process.

In &quot;Tempest&quot;, Jacen also takes command of Rogue Squadron while it participates in the blockade of Corellia. He shoots down a civilian freighter that was attempting to run the blockade, and had fired on him, then relieves his sister from duty because she had refused to do it. He also uses the &quot;Anakin Solo&quot; to fire upon the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;, while both his sister and his parents are on board. He believes his parents to have been involved in a failed attempt to assassinate Tenel Ka; the Solos had in fact been set up by Dur Gejjen, Prime Minister of Corellia.

In &quot;Sacrifice&quot;, Lumiya says she is pleased by his progress, but instructs him that to truly become a Sith he would have to undergo the Trial of Sacrifice: to kill that which he loves most. Doing this, he believes, would allow him to use the powers of the Sith without becoming evil and would &quot;immortalize his love&quot; for his sacrifice. Jacen decides there is only one way to fulfill this last obstacle: he would have to kill Tenel Ka and their daughter Allana. Nevertheless, after Ben tells Mara that he overheard Jacen communicating with Lumiya, Mara tracks Jacen down in the Hapes Consortium. After a long and heated battle, Jacen kills Mara Jade; the sacrifice necessary to becoming a Sith Lord is not Jacen&#x27;s love, but Ben&#x27;s. Ben suspects Jacen almost immediately, upon meeting Jacen at his mother&#x27;s body. Eventually, Jacen chooses the Sith name Darth Caedus.

By &quot;Fury&quot;, Darth Caedus is the principal antagonist of the series, and the declared enemy of nearly every other major character: His parents and sister have disowned him, Luke is sworn to redeem him, and Ben is driven to seek justice for his mother. In the novel, Caedus kidnaps Allana so Tenel Ka and the Hapans won&#x27;t decide to leave the government, but Han, Leia, Luke, Jaina, Ben, and their allies save Allana. After saving Allana, Leia tells Caedus to become a Jedi again, but he refuses. Han and Leia later find out Allana is Caedus and Tenel Ka&#x27;s child. At the end, Jaina plans to have training from Boba Fett to help her face off against Caedus, despite her parents once being foes with Fett.

In &quot;Revelation&quot;, Caedus takes on a new apprentice, Tahiri Veila to replace Ben and turns to the task of ending the war. He entices the Imperial Remnant to join him in an attack on the planet Fondor. Although Admiral Niathal wants to offer the planet the chance to surrender, Caedus is determined to make an example of Fondor by crippling the shipyards and its planetary government. After previously sharing military secrets, which leads to hundreds of deaths and compromises the battle plan at Fondor, Niathal arranges a cease-fire without consulting Caedus. Enraged at this treason, Caedus orders the fleet to ignore Niathal&#x27;s orders and bombard the major cities. Niathal orders all ships loyal to her to attack the &quot;Anakin Solo&quot;. Two-thirds of the fleet side with Caedus, while the rest ally themselves with Niathal. When the Imperial Remnant refuses to assist Caedus, his new apprentice assassinates Imperial Head of State Gilad Pellaeon and turns control over to the Moffs who then come to aid Jacen. A mysterious fleet led by Admiral Daala, loyal to Pellaeon, appears, accompanied by one hundred Mandalorian mercenaries and together, owing to Daala&#x27;s experimental weapons, they send the Galactic Alliance Fleet into retreat.

Caedus then takes control of Coruscant and claims sole control of the Galactic Alliance.

In &quot;Invincible&quot;, Jaina takes it upon herself to defeat her brother. Caedus&#x27;s meditations are disrupted by Luke Skywalker, in an attempt to hide Jaina&#x27;s attack. Jaina, accompanied by several Mandalorian commandos, confronts Caedus, who quickly dispatches the Mandalorians, while Jaina acts as a sniper. When she finally runs out of ammunition, she seizes a Mandalorian saber and severs Caedus&#x27; arm. Jaina withdraws, however, due to her own injuries. After escaping an attack led by Luke Skywalker on the bridge of the &quot;Anakin Solo&quot;, Caedus sees a vision of his daughter Allana on a white throne in a time of peace. This vision convinces Caedus that he has won — he would bring peace to the galaxy, and prevent his visions of war and suffering from coming true.

At the book&#x27;s climax, Caedus and Jaina face off in a final lightsaber duel aboard Caedus&#x27; flagship, the &quot;Anakin Solo&quot;. In the midst of the duel, Caedus comes back to the light and attempts to persuade Jaina of his intentions to protect Tenel Ka and Allana. Jaina refuses to listen, however, and attacks him after he deactivates and holsters his lightsaber. She later slams the door shut in his face when he tries to leave the fight. After a grueling battle in which both are seriously injured, Jacen is defeated when Jaina severs his Achilles tendon and stabs him in the heart. As he dies, Jacen reaches out to both his former lover and his child through the Force, warning them to flee from an approaching bio-warfare attack designed by the Imperial Remnant to kill them. In this act of selflessness, Jaina sees the remnants of the good man her brother had once been. Following Caedus&#x27;s death and the war&#x27;s end, the Galactic Alliance emerges victorious over the Confederation and peace is restored to the galaxy, just as Jacen had foreseen through a vision in the Force.

===&quot;Fate of the Jedi&quot;===
Though Jacen makes few true appearances in the &quot;Fate of the Jedi&quot;, which follows the &quot;Legacy of the Force&quot; series, his legacy is felt throughout the series, as Luke Skywalker is arrested for negligence of duty and is sentenced to a ten-year exile, in which alongside his son Ben, he tries to ascertain the circumstances of how and why Jacen turned to the dark side.

Jacen&#x27;s spirit makes its first appearance in &quot;Abyss&quot;, wherein he warns Luke and Ben about Abeloth, the main antagonist of the series.

Then, in the final novel &quot;Apocalypse&quot;, Jacen&#x27;s spirit (along with Mara&#x27;s) provides aid to Luke as he partners with Darth Krayt in the final battle against Abeloth. Following Abeloth&#x27;s destruction, Jacen reveals that Krayt was the dark figure he saw in his vision of the future and the source of his downfall; he saw his daughter Allana standing next to Krayt. In response, Krayt insists that while Caedus&#x27;s actions simply delayed the Sith, and they are eventually going to succeed in their planned takeover of the galaxy.

In aiding the Jedi against Abeloth, Jacen posthumously redeems himself; however, he still refers to his fate as damnation. While Luke does not forgive his nephew for his complicity in Mara&#x27;s death, he does receive an understanding of what led Jacen to that point.

===&quot;Star Wars: Legacy&quot;===
The second volume of the &quot;Legacy&quot; comic series, set about 140 years after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, features Jacen&#x27;s descendant Ania Solo as the protagonist. In general, the descendants of Jacen, Jaina and Ben are main characters in this era, set when and after Darth Krayt takes over the galaxy. Although they themselves do not appear in person as spirits, older characters like Luke and Mara do.

==Reception==
IGN listed Jacen as #17 on their list of the top 100 &quot;Star Wars&quot; heroes, saying that he had a more &quot;profound effect&quot; than any of the other Solo children on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; setting. Jesse Schedeen, writing for IGN, also listed Darth Caedus as #5 in a reader-inspired list of top &quot;Star Wars&quot; villains, and called his &quot;defining moment of villainy&quot; his murder of Mara Jade. UGO.com listed Jacen as their top &quot;Star Wars&quot; expanded universe character, calling him &quot;one of the most fearsome - and most tragic - villains in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe&quot;.

==Legacy==
With the sequel film &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; in production, in April 2014 most of the licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels and comics produced since the 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot; were declared non-canon to the franchise. The epilogue of &quot;Family Reunion – and Farewell&quot;, the series finale of &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;, introduced a character named Jacen Syndulla by series creator Dave Filoni in honor of Jacen Solo.

<text>Eduardo Nicanor Frei Montalva (; 16 January 1911 – 22 January 1982) was a Chilean political leader. In his long political career, he was Minister of Public Works, president of his Christian Democratic Party, senator, President of the Senate, and the 27th president of Chile from 1964 to 1970. His eldest son, Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, also became president of Chile (1994–2000).

Frei&#x27;s Christian Democratic Party supported the Armed Forces intervention to remove his successor Salvador Allende from office in 1973, after the Chamber of Deputies, on 22 August 1973, accused Allende of violating the Constitution. He was later a vocal opponent of the Augusto Pinochet regime. On 22 January 1982, Frei died in Santiago, Chile, following surgery. Assassination was suspected by some but has never been proven.
On 18 August 2023, the Supreme Court ruled out the assassination charges and declared innocent all those accused.

== Early life ==
Eduardo Frei Montalva was born in Santiago on 16 January 1911, the son of Eduard Frei Schlinz, a Swiss-born ethnic German from Feldkirch, Austria, and Victoria Montalva Martínez. In 1914, his family moved to Lontué, where his father had been hired as an accountant at a winery. In addition, his other two siblings, Arturo and Irene, were born. He attended the Escuela Pública de Lontué (Public School of Lontué). The winery San Pedro is still well known in Lontué and Molina 200 km south of Santiago and was founded in 1865 by the brothers Bonifacio and José Gregorio Correa Albano.

In 1919 the family returned to Santiago and Eduardo, as a young man, entered the boarding school Seminario Conciliar de Santiago where he remained until 1922. In 1923, he entered Instituto de Humanidades Luis Campino, where he graduated in 1928, at the age of 17.

As an 18-year-old, he entered Universidad Católica School of Law in 1929. For two years, he had been visiting María, the sister of his friend, Alfredo Ruiz-Tagle. He attended high school and went on to study law, graduating as a lawyer in 1933. He married María Ruiz-Tagle with whom he had 7 children. His eldest son, Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, was President of Chile from 1994 to 2000.

== Political career ==
He began his political career in the Conservative Party, but was among a group of young men who founded their own party in 1938: the Falange Nacional. He was minister of Public Works in 1945, and in 1949, Frei was elected senator for Atacama and Coquimbo. The same year he published “Historia de los Partidos Políticos Chilenos” (“History of Chilean Political Parties”) in collaboration with Albert Edwards Vives. In 1950, he traveled to New York as a UN delegate. In 1952, at 41 years of age, Frei Montalva announced his first candidacy in the presidential elections.

The 1952 election was won by Carlos Ibáñez del Campo. Later, President Ibañez requested Frei to organize an executive committee. However, this never came to be. In 1954, the UN appointed him President of the Commission in charge of elaborating the report of the Conference of Chancellors held in Rio de Janeiro. Some of its members were: Carlos Lleras Restrepo, former President of Colombia, and Raúl Prebisch director of ECLAC. The report served as a basis for subsequent studies on economic development and the integration of Latin America. In 1956 he was elected Senator in Santiago by first majority.

On 27 July 1957, the Falange Nacional became the Christian Democratic Party of Chile, and he became the undisputed leader. Frei Montalva was offered once more the candidacy for president of the Republic in the 1958 elections. Jorge Alessandri Rodríguez was elected president while Eduardo Frei Montalva took only third place.

During these years he published three more books: “Sentido y Forma de una Política” (“Meaning and Shape of Politics”), “La Verdad Tiene Su Hora” (“Truth Has Its Time”), and “Pensamiento y Acción” (“Thought and Action”). In 1960, he lectured at conference “The Mission of Universities in Latin America” in Montevideo; a widely promoted conference at that time. In 1961, he was elected President of the First World Christian Democratic Party Congress, held in Santiago, Chile. The congress was attended by delegations from throughout Latin America, European, North American, and African countries. That year he was invited as special guest to a seminar on the problems of Developing Nations, held at Oxford University. The seminar was attended by delegates from all over the world.

Between 1960 and 1962, he lectured at Columbia University on problems in Latin America. In 1962, he gave a conference at Notre Dame University on the development and the integration of Latin American countries. He ran for president again in 1964. Declassified documents show that from 1962 through 1964, the CIA spent a total of $2.6 million to finance his presidential campaign and spent $3 million in anti-Allende propaganda &quot;to scare voters away from Allende&#x27;s FRAP coalition&quot;. The CIA considered its role in the victory of Frei a great success.

That year he was elected with his &quot;Revolución en Libertad&quot; (&quot;Revolution in Liberty&quot;) slogan by a large margin (56%), defeating Socialist candidate Salvador Allende who only received 39% of the vote, but who subsequently won the 1970 Chilean presidential election.

==Administration==
Frei&#x27;s administration began many reforms in Chilean society. &quot;Promoción Popular&quot; (Social Promotion), &quot;Reforma Agraria&quot; (Agrarian Reform), &quot;Reforma Educacional&quot; (Education Reform), and &quot;Juntas de Vecinos&quot; (Neighborhood Associations) were some of his main projects. He also took measures to rationalize drug supply. On 4 September 1964, having one of the highest turnouts in Chilean history, Frei Montalva was elected President of the Republic of Chile. He took office two months later, on November 4.

The Frei presidency did much to tackle poverty, as characterised by the growing share of wages as a proportion of GNP. By the end of the Frei presidency, the wage and salaried sector received close to 51% of GNP, compared with 42% at the end of the Alessandri presidency. This positive redistribution of wealth was encouraged by government policies, particularly in the rural sector, where wages rose by 40% in real terms. Between 1964 and 1970, total enrollment in education increased by 46%, while around 250,000 houses were built, mostly for the poor.

Frei&#x27;s administration also introduced a wealth tax and carried out a property tax reassessment in order to make the taxation system more progressive. Taxes as a percentage of GNP increased 12.8% in 1964 to 21.2% in 1970. The social reforms introduced by Frei&#x27;s government led to a huge increase in public expenditure, which rose as a proportion of GNP from 35.7% in 1965 to 46.9% in 1970. Expenditures on education, agriculture, and housing rose went up considerably, with spending on housing increasing by 70% in real terms in 1965 alone.

During Frei&#x27;s six years in office, an average of 40,000 housing units were constructed each year, and a total of 100,000 lots were assigned. Investments in primary care clinics and hospitals were also carried out, with 20 clinics and 16 hospitals built between 1965 and 1969.

In 1965, he started a presidential tour through France, the United Kingdom, Federal Republic of Germany, Italy and the Vatican. During this time, he also visited countries in Latin America such as: Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Venezuela; places where he delivered important speeches on international issues.

On his return, he initiated important plans involving housing, education, reforestation, land reform, health, and the nationalization of copper. The Comisión Nacional de Cultura (National Culture Commission), the Consejería Nacional de la Promoción Popular and the Juntas de Vecinos (“Neighborhood Committees”) were also created.

One area of reform given high priority by the Frei Administration was the fostering of networks of local, self-help organisations (especially among the “unorganised” residents of the shantytowns), which was placed under a national supervisory council. As a result of the government&#x27;s actions, mothers&#x27; centres, sports associations, youth clubs, residents’ committees, and parents&#x27; groups proliferated, with an estimated 20,000 units of this type in existence by 1970, according to government figures. Half of these new units were mothers&#x27; centres, with an estimated membership of 45,000 women, and the government claimed to have distributed 70,000 sewing machines to these centres. According to Frei, these measures had given “a new form of life and hope” to hundreds of thousands of people.

Improvements were also made in areas such as housing, education and medical care. Between 1964 and 1970, around 260,000 houses were constructed (around a third by the state housing corporation CORVI) and about 200,000 housing solutions were claimed (referring to the provision of sites for self-help housing projects). The number of hospitals (and beds) doubled under the PDC, and spending on education as a proportion of public expenditure rose from one-seventh to one-fifth. Around 3,000 new schools were built throughout the country, and by 1970 95% of children in the relevant age group were covered by primary education. Expenditure on scholarships and school loans was doubled, and school enrollment was raised from 1.8 million to 2.9 million.

Expenditure on education doubled, the number of years of basic education was increased from six to eight, and a two-shift school-day was introduced that doubled the capacity of the country&#x27;s system. Frei&#x27;s initiatives in education led to increased rates of enrollment in both primary and secondary education, with primary school coverage reaching 90% in the majority of rural and urban areas by 1970, while secondary school coverage reached 49% in 1970, compared with 18% at the start of the 1960s.

A new law establishing work-accident and occupational disease insurance was signed into law in January 1968, providing for compulsory coverage of all salaried employees and wage earners, including apprentices and domestic servants. In March that year, a piece of legislation creating government-sponsored health insurance for public and private salaried employees and their dependents was signed into law.

Basic health services were expanded with the training of community health workers, the building of rural health clinics, and the shifting of financial and personnel resources from hospitals to community health centres. These efforts contributed to a steep decline in infant mortality in Chile during the 1960s–1970s.

Much attention was also given to the improvement of social and economic conditions in the countryside. Both rural unionisation and agrarian reform were accelerated, with the government starting to expropriate estates in a serious way. Family allowance for farmers was doubled, the agricultural minimum wage was raised to the same level as its urban equivalent, and an agrarian reform law signed by Frei in July 1967 made all farms of more than eighty “basic” hectares liable to expropriation. The Frei Administration had thus made a major start to land reform, a policy continued by the Allende Government.

The agrarian reform carried out by the Frei Government organized the reformed sector according to a temporary system established in the law, whereby the expropriated estates became asentamientos. This was a legal form in which the farm operated as a joint enterprise between the state and the peasants who had lived in the former latifundia (extensive agricultural estates), with the state providing the credits, land, and technical assistance, and the peasants their labor. After an indeterminate period, the land would be made available for subdivision into small private plots, if the peasants wished. According to one study, the percentage of the population living below the poverty line steadily fell; from 39% in 1965 to 17% in 1970.

During his administration 8 workers were killed in El Salvador mine and 11 squatters in the Massacre of Puerto Montt. His Minister of the Interior, Edmundo Pérez Zujovic was politically blamed for the deaths. On 21 October 1969 the Tacnazo insurrection, occurred—a brief non-violent demonstration of the Tacna artillery regiment in Santiago, led by General Roberto Viaux.

In 1966, the Andean Group, officially created through its Declaration, signed in January 1965. However, the group culminated with the famous speech delivered by Frei Montalva in Plaza Bolívar, Bogota. The same year the pacts on Chilean copper were signed.

In January 1967 the National Congress refused his constitutional permission to travel to the United States where he had been invited by President Lyndon B. Johnson. In April 1967, he participated in the Meeting of Presidents from American countries, carried out in Montevideo, Uruguay.

In 1970, he was awarded with the Doctor Honoris Causa title by the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. On November 4, he left office, handing over the Presidency to Salvador Allende.

==Support of the coup d&#x27;etat against Allende==
After Allende&#x27;s 1970 victory, Frei became convinced of what he called a &quot;totalitarian project&quot; to impose a Communist tyranny. In 1971, he gave conferences at universities in Dayton, Ohio, Boston, and the Council of the Americas in New York, denouncing in all of them the actions of the Allende government that were allegedly violating the Constitution and the laws of Chile.

In the March 1973 parliamentary elections he was elected Senator for Santiago by a first majority. He was afterwards elected President of the Senate and became the leader of the opposition to Allende. On 6 July 1973, he met with the executive directors of the industrialists’ association (SOFOFA). They told Frei that the country was disintegrating and that if urgent measures were not taken, Chile would fall under a bloody Cuban-style Marxist dictatorship. Frei responded: &quot;There is nothing that can be done by myself, by the Congress, or by any civilian. Unfortunately, this problem can only be fixed with guns.&quot; Instead of going to the Congress, we should go to the regiments. &quot;I fully share your apprehensions, and I advise you to state them plainly to commanders-in-chief of the Armed Forces, hopefully today.&quot;

On 11 September 1973, during the coup d’etát President Allende died by suicide in the presidential palace, La Moneda, as the Armed Forces seized power. Frei’s Christian Democratic Party supported the Armed Forces intervention to remove Allende from office in 1973, after the Chamber of Deputies, on 22 August 1973, accused Allende of violating the Constitution.

In November 1973 Frei wrote a historic letter to Mariano Rumor, President of the International Christian Democrats, endorsing the Armed Forces intervention and denouncing what he alleged was an attempt by Allende to impose a Communist dictatorship in Chile.

Between 1973 and 1977, Frei Montalva was invited to different countries and participated in conferences, such as the Atlantic Conference in 1976. In 1975 he published his book &quot;El Mandato de la Historia y las Exigencias del Porvenir&quot; (“The Mandate of History and Demands of the Future“), and in 1977 his quintessential book &quot;América Latina: Opción y Esperanza&quot; (“Latin America: Option and Hope”) which has been translated into several languages.

In the period between 1977 and 1982, he was invited to participate in the Brandt Commission, led by Willy Brandt. As a member, he attended meetings held in Germany, Switzerland, Mali, United States, Malaysia, France, Austria, Belgium, and Great Britain. As a Brandt Commission delegate he engaged with important executives from IDB, OAS, and ECLAC.

In 1980, he participated in the Meeting of Former Democrat Presidents of Latin America held in Caracas, Venezuela. In 1981, he was invited to the Club of Rome International Conference on the “Alternatives for Humanity: Latin America Mission” also held in Caracas. His last book &quot;El Mensaje Humanista&quot; (“The Humanist Message”) was published.

Later, Frei became an opponent of Pinochet&#x27;s military government. He opposed the extension of Pinochet&#x27;s presidency in 1981, leading a rally against it.

==Death==

In 1981, Frei was suffering from chronic acid reflux, stemming from a hiatal hernia, an unpleasant but not life-threatening condition. He was operated on for the condition, but died in Santiago on 22 January 1982, six days after his 71st birthday. His death at the time was attributed to septicaemia stemming from surgery. He was buried in the Cementerio General de Santiago.

It was later alleged that Frei had been poisoned by DINA, the intelligence service of the military government, with a toxin produced by biochemist Eugenio Berrios. After it was reported that researchers from the University of Ghent in Belgium had discovered traces of mustard gas in Frei&#x27;s body, the former president&#x27;s family filed a lawsuit.

Frei&#x27;s personal doctor, Patricio Rojas, who was also his Minister of the Interior, denied the accusations. &quot;El Mercurio&quot; columnist Hermógenes Pérez de Arce disputed the existence of the Belgian report, citing a denial by the university&#x27;s chief of communications, Tom de Smedt, that an investigation had been done at the university. Tissue samples sent to FBI labs and to the labs at the University of Ghent showed no evidence of toxic substances. A Chilean doctor reportedly found residues of sulfonic salts, which can be the result of the decomposition of mustard gas but can also be the result of the decomposition of a corpse.

In December 2009, six individuals were arrested for their roles in the alleged assassination.

Judge Alejandro Madrid based his decision on a report that determined that low doses of thallium and mustard gas were administered to Frei over an extended period while he was hospitalized at the Santa María Clinic in Santiago, and that these toxic substances had the effect of decreasing Frei&#x27;s immune system, making him too weak to survive his surgery.

The report was widely criticized by the surgical team in &quot;El Mercurio&quot; and &quot;La Segunda&quot;, newspapers owned by the Edwards family, who had brokered the coup and maintained strong ties to the CIA and Pinochet&#x27;s government. The Appeals Court suspended Judge Madrid from the case, and the accused were freed on bail.

The case was re-opened in 2010 after a failed attempt to disqualify Judge Madrid.

On 30 January 2019, the six suspects were found guilty of homicide and given sentences ranging from 3 to 10 years in prison. On 25 January 2021, the convictions would be overturned by a Chile Appeals Court three judge panel which found that Montalva was not a homicide victim. The Supreme Court of Chile would also find that Frei was not a homicide victim on 18 August 2023 as well.

<doc id="165000" wikidata="Q442130" url="?curid=165000" title="Anna Katharine Green">
<text>Anna Katharine Green (November 11, 1846 – April 11, 1935) was an American poet and novelist. She was one of the first writers of detective fiction in America and distinguished herself by writing well plotted, legally accurate stories. Green has been called &quot;the mother of the detective novel&quot;.

==Life and work==
Green was born in Brooklyn, New York on November 11, 1846. She had an early ambition to write romantic verse and corresponded with Ralph Waldo Emerson. When her poetry failed to gain recognition, she produced her first and best known novel, &quot;The Leavenworth Case&quot; (1878), praised by Wilkie Collins, and the hit of the year. She became a bestselling author, eventually publishing 37 books over 40 years.

On November 25, 1884, Green married the actor and stove designer, and later noted furniture maker, Charles Rohlfs (1853 – 1936). Rohlfs toured in a dramatization of Green&#x27;s &quot;The Leavenworth Case&quot;. After his theater career faltered, he became a furniture maker in 1897, and Green collaborated with him on some of his designs. Together they had one daughter and two sons: Rosamund Rohlfs, Roland Rohlfs, and Sterling Rohlfs. Her daughter Rosamund married Robert Twitty Palmer.

Green died on April 11, 1935, in Buffalo, New York, at the age of 88. Her husband died the following year.

==Critical response==
Though Green&#x27;s book &quot;The Leavenworth Case&quot; is frequently cited as the first mystery written by an American woman, &quot;The Dead Letter&quot; by Seeley Regester was published earlier (1866).

In a discussion of women writers of detective fiction, scholar Ellen Higgins in 1994 chronicled the work of Green as popularizing the genre a decade before Arthur Conan Doyle brought out his first Sherlock Holmes story. &quot;I only found out afterward that some people were a little upset with it because they don&#x27;t want to hear about women competing with the master&quot;, Higgins said.

Green is credited with shaping detective fiction into its classic form, and developing the series detective. Her main character was detective Ebenezer Gryce of the New York Metropolitan Police Force, but in three novels he is assisted by the nosy society spinster Amelia Butterworth, the prototype for Miss Marple, Miss Silver and other creations. She also invented the &#x27;girl detective&#x27;: in the character of Violet Strange, a debutante with a secret life as a sleuth. Indeed, as journalist Kathy Hickman writes, Green &quot;stamped the mystery genre with the distinctive features that would influence writers from Agatha Christie and Conan Doyle to contemporary authors of suspenseful &quot;whodunits&quot;. In addition to creating elderly spinster and young female sleuths, Green&#x27;s innovative plot devices included dead bodies in libraries, newspaper clippings as &quot;clews&quot;, the coroner&#x27;s inquest, and expert witnesses. Yale Law School once used her books to demonstrate how damaging it can be to rely on circumstantial evidence. Written in 1878, her first book, &quot;The Leavenworth Case: A Lawyer&#x27;s Story,&quot; sparked a debate in the Pennsylvania State Senate over whether the book could &quot;really have been written by a woman&quot;.

Green was in some ways a progressive woman for her time—succeeding in a genre dominated by male writers—but she did not approve of many of her feminist contemporaries, and she was opposed to women&#x27;s suffrage.

==Legacy==
In 2002, Buffalo Literary Walking Tours began an annual series of weekend walking tours highlighting authors with local connections. Green is included along with Mark Twain, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Herman Melville, Taylor Caldwell, and others.

Green&#x27;s short story &quot;The Intangible Clue&quot; featuring Violet Strange was adapted by Chris Harrald for the second series of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s drama series &quot;The Rivals&quot; and starred Jeany Spark as Violet Strange.

<doc id="165008" wikidata="Q192706" url="?curid=165008" title="William Gilbert (physicist)">
<text>William Gilbert (; 24 May 1544? – 30 November 1603), also known as Gilberd, was an English physician, physicist and natural philosopher. He passionately rejected both the prevailing Aristotelian philosophy and the Scholastic method of university teaching. He is remembered today largely for his book &quot;De Magnete&quot; (1600).

A unit of magnetomotive force, also known as magnetic potential, was named the &quot;Gilbert&quot; in his honour; it has now been superseded by the Ampere-turn.

== Life and work ==

Gilbert was born in Colchester to Jerome Gilberd, a borough recorder. He was educated at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. After gaining his MD from Cambridge in 1569, and a short spell as bursar of St John&#x27;s College, he left to practice medicine in London, and he travelled on the continent. In 1573, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. In 1600, he was elected President of the college. He was Elizabeth I&#x27;s own physician from 1601 until her death in 1603, and James VI and I renewed his appointment.

His primary scientific work – much inspired by earlier works of Robert Norman – was &quot;De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure&quot; (&quot;On the Magnet and Magnetic Bodies, and on the Great Magnet the Earth&quot;) published in 1600. In this work, he describes many of his experiments with his model Earth called the terrella. From these experiments, he concluded that Earth was itself magnetic, and that this was the reason why compasses point north (previously, some people believed that it was the pole-star Polaris, or a large magnetic island on the north pole that attracted the compass). He was the first person to argue that the center of Earth was iron, and he considered an important and related property of magnets, being that they can be cut, each forming a new magnet with north and south poles.

In Book 6, Chapter 3, he argues in support of diurnal rotation though he does not talk about heliocentrism, stating that it is an absurdity to think that the immense celestial spheres (doubting even that they exist) rotate daily, as opposed to the diurnal rotation of the much-smaller Earth. He also posits that the &quot;fixed&quot; stars are at remote variable distances rather than fixed to an imaginary sphere. He states that, situated &quot;in thinnest aether, or in the most subtle fifth essence, or in vacuity – how shall the stars keep their places in the mighty swirl of these enormous spheres composed of a substance of which no one knows aught?&quot;

The English word &quot;electricity&quot; was first used in 1646 by Sir Thomas Browne, derived from Gilbert&#x27;s 1600 Neo-Latin &quot;electricus&quot;, meaning &quot;like amber&quot;. The term had been in use since the 13th century, but Gilbert was the first to use it to mean &quot;like amber in its attractive properties&quot;. He recognized that friction with these objects removed a so-called &quot;effluvium&quot;, which would cause the attraction effect in returning to the object, though he did not realize that this substance (electric charge) was universal to all materials.

In his book, he also studied static electricity using amber; amber is called &quot;elektron&quot; in Greek, so Gilbert decided to call its effect the &quot;electric force&quot;. He invented the first electrical measuring instrument, the electroscope, in the form of a pivoted needle he called the &quot;versorium&quot;.

Like other people of his day, he believed that crystal (clear quartz) was an especially hard form of water, formed from compressed ice:

Gilbert argued that electricity and magnetism were not the same thing. For evidence, he (incorrectly) pointed out that, while electrical attraction disappeared with heat, magnetic attraction did not (although it is proven that magnetism does in fact become damaged and weakened with heat). Hans Christian Ørsted and James Clerk Maxwell showed that both effects were aspects of a single force: electromagnetism. Maxwell surmised this in his &quot;A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism&quot; after much analysis.

Gilbert&#x27;s magnetism was the invisible force that many other natural philosophers seized upon, incorrectly, as governing the motions that they observed. While not attributing magnetism to attraction among the stars, Gilbert pointed out the motion of the skies was due to Earth&#x27;s rotation, and not the rotation of the spheres, 20 years before Galileo (but 57 years after Copernicus, who stated it openly in his work &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot;, which was published in 1543) (see external reference below). Gilbert made the first attempt to map the surface markings on the moon in the 1590s. His chart, made without the use of a telescope, showed outlines of dark and light patches on the moon&#x27;s face. Contrary to most of his contemporaries, Gilbert believed that the light spots on the moon were water, and the dark spots were land.
Besides Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;De Magnete&quot;, there appeared at Amsterdam in 1651 a quarto volume of 316 pages entitled &quot;De Mundo Nostro Sublunari Philosophia Nova&quot; (New Philosophy about our Sublunary World), edited – some say by his brother William Gilbert Junior, and others say, by the eminent English scholar and critic John Gruter – from two manuscripts found in the library of Sir William Boswell. According to John Davy, &quot;this work of Gilbert&#x27;s, which is so little known, is a very remarkable one both in style and matter; and there is a vigor and energy of expression belonging to it very suitable to its originality. Possessed of a more minute and practical knowledge of natural philosophy than Bacon, his opposition to the philosophy of the schools was more searching and particular, and at the same time probably little less efficient.&quot; In the opinion of Prof. John Robison, &quot;De Mundo&quot; consists of an attempt to establish a new system of natural philosophy upon the ruins of the Aristotelian doctrine.

William Whewell says in his &quot;History of the Inductive Sciences&quot; (1859):
Gilbert, in his work, &quot;De Magnete&quot; printed in 1600 has only some vague notions that the magnetic virtue of the earth in some way determines the direction of the earth&#x27;s axis, the rate of its diurnal rotation, and that of the revolution of the moon about it. Gilbert died in 1603, and in his posthumous work (&quot;De Mundo nostro Sublunari Philosophia nova&quot;, 1631) we have already a more distinct statement of the attraction of one body by another. &quot;The force which emanates from the moon reaches to the earth, and, in like manner, the magnetic virtue of the earth pervades the region of the moon: both correspond and conspire by the joint action of both, according to a proportion and conformity of motions, but the earth has more effect in consequence of its superior mass; the earth attracts and repels, the moon, and the moon within certain limits, the earth; not so as to make the bodies come together, as magnetic bodies do, but so that they may go on in a continuous course.&quot; Though this phraseology is capable of representing a good deal of the truth, it does not appear to have been connected... with any very definite notions of mechanical action in detail.
Gilbert died on 30 November 1603 in London. His cause of death is thought to have been the bubonic plague.

Gilbert was buried in his home town, in Holy Trinity Church, Colchester. His marble wall monument can still be seen in this Saxon church, now deconsecrated and used as a café and market.

== Commentary on Gilbert ==
Francis Bacon never accepted Copernican heliocentrism, and was critical of Gilbert&#x27;s philosophical work in support of the diurnal motion of Earth. Bacon&#x27;s criticism includes the following two statements. The first was repeated in three of his works, namely &quot;In the Advancement of Learning&quot; (1605), &quot;Novum Organum&quot; (1620), and &quot;De Augmentis&quot; (1623). The more severe second statement is from &quot;History of Heavy and Light Bodies&quot; published after Bacon&#x27;s death.
The Alchemists have made a philosophy out of a few experiments of the furnace and Gilbert our countryman hath made a philosophy out of observations of the lodestone.
[Gilbert] has himself become a magnet; that is, he has ascribed too many things to that force and built a ship out of a shell. 
Thomas Thomson writes in his &quot;History of the Royal Society&quot; (1812):

The magnetic laws were first generalized and explained by Dr. Gilbert, whose book on magnetism published in 1600, is one of the finest examples of inductive philosophy that has ever been presented to the world. It is the more remarkable, because it preceded the &quot;Novum Organum&quot; of Bacon, in which the inductive method of philosophizing was first explained.
William Whewell writes in his &quot;History of the Inductive Sciences&quot; (1837/1859):
Gilbert... repeatedly asserts the paramount value of experiments. He himself, no doubt, acted up to his own precepts; for his work contains all the fundamental facts of the science [of magnetism], so fully examined, indeed, that even at this day we have little to add to them.
Historian Henry Hallam wrote of Gilbert in his &quot;Introduction to the Literature of Europe in the Fifteenth, Sixteenth, and Seventeenth Centuries&quot; (1848):

The year 1600 was the first in which England produced a remarkable work in physical science; but this was one sufficient to raise a lasting reputation to its author. Gilbert, a physician, in his Latin treatise on the magnet, not only collected all the knowledge which others had possessed on that subject, but became at once the father of experimental philosophy in this island, and by a singular felicity and acuteness of genius, the founder of theories which have been revived after the lapse of ages, and are almost universally received into the creed of the science. The magnetism of the earth itself, his own original hypothesis, &quot;nova illa nostra et inaudita de tellure sententia&quot; [our new and unprecedented view of the planet]... was by no means one of those vague conjectures that are sometimes unduly applauded... He relied on the analogy of terrestrial phenomena to those exhibited by what he calls a &quot;terrella&quot;, or artificial spherical magnet. ...Gilbert was also one of our earliest Copernicans, at least as to the rotation of the earth; and with his usual sagacity inferred, before the invention of the telescope, that there are a multitude of fixed stars beyond the reach of our vision.
Walter William Bryant of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, wrote in his book (1920):

When Gilbert of Colchester, in his “New Philosophy,” founded on his researches in magnetism, was dealing with tides, he did not suggest that the moon attracted the water, but that “subterranean spirits and humors, rising in sympathy with the moon, cause the sea also to rise and flow to the shores and up rivers”. It appears that an idea, presented in some such way as this, was more readily received than a plain statement. This so-called philosophical method was, in fact, very generally applied, and Kepler, who shared Galileo’s admiration for Gilbert’s work, adopted it in his own attempt to extend the idea of magnetic attraction to the planets.

<doc id="165015" wikidata="Q211959" url="?curid=165015" title="Metal detector">
<text>A metal detector is an instrument that detects the nearby presence of metal. Metal detectors are useful for finding metal objects on the surface, underground, and under water. A metal detector consists of a control box, an adjustable shaft, and a variable-shaped pickup coil. When the coil nears metal, the control box signals its presence with a tone, numerical reading, light, or needle movement. Signal intensity typically increases with proximity and/or metal size/composition. A common type are stationary &quot;walk through&quot; metal detectors used at access points in prisons, courthouses, airports and psychiatric hospitals to detect concealed metal weapons on a person&#x27;s body.

The simplest form of a metal detector consists of an oscillator producing an alternating current that passes through a coil producing an alternating magnetic field. If a piece of electrically conductive metal is close to the coil, eddy currents will be induced (inductive sensor) in the metal, and this produces a magnetic field of its own. If another coil is used to measure the magnetic field (acting as a magnetometer), the change in the magnetic field due to the metallic object can be detected.

The first industrial metal detectors came out in the 1960s. They were used for finding minerals among other things. Metal detectors help find land mines. They also detect weapons like knives and guns, which is important for airport security. People most commonly use them to search for buried objects, like in archaeology and treasure hunting. Metal detectors are also used to detect foreign bodies in food, and in the construction industry to detect steel reinforcing bars in concrete and pipes and wires buried in walls and floors.

==History and development==
In 1841, Professor Heinrich Wilhelm Dove published an invention he called the &quot;differential inductor&quot;. It was a 4-coil induction balance, with 2 glass tubes each having 2 well-insulated copper wire solenoids wound around them. Charged Leyden jars (high-voltage capacitors) were discharged through the 2 primary coils; this current surge induced a voltage in the secondary coils. When the secondary coils were wired in opposition, the induced voltages cancelled as confirmed by the Professor holding the ends of the secondary coils. When a piece of metal was placed inside one glass tube the Professor received a shock. This then was the first magnetic induction metal detector, and the first pulse induction metal detector.

In late 1878 and early 1879, Professor (of music) David Edward Hughes published his experiments with the 4-coil induction balance. He used his own recent invention the microphone and a ticking clock to generate regular pulses and a telephone receiver as detector. To measure the strength of the signals he invented a coaxial 3-coil induction balance which he called the &quot;electric sonometer&quot;. Hughes did much to popularize the induction balance, quickly leading to practical devices that could identify counterfeit coins. In 1880 Mr. J. Munro, C.E. suggested the use of the 4-coil induction balance for metal prospecting. Hughes&#x27;s coaxial 3-coil induction balance would also see use in metal detecting.

In July 1881, Alexander Graham Bell initially used a 4-coil induction balance to attempt to locate a bullet lodged in the chest of American President James Garfield. After much experimenting the best bullet detection range he achieved was only 2 inches (5 centimeters). He then used his own earlier discovery, the partially overlapping 2-coil induction balance, and the detection range increased to 5 inches (12 centimeters). But the attempt was still unsuccessful because the metal coil spring bed Garfield was lying on confused the detector. Bell&#x27;s 2-coil induction balance would go on to evolve into the popular double D coil.

On December 16, 1881, Captain Charles Ambrose McEvoy applied for British Patent No. 5518, Apparatus for Searching for Submerged Torpedoes, &amp;c., which was granted Jun 16 1882. His US269439 patent application of Jul 12 1882 was granted Dec 19 1882. It was a 4-coil induction balance for detecting submerged metallic torpedoes and iron ships and the like. Given the development time involved this may have been the earliest known device specifically constructed as a metal detector using magnetic induction.

In 1892, George M. Hopkins described an orthogonal 2-coil induction balance for metal detecting.

In 1915, Professor Camille Gutton developed a 4-coil induction balance to detect unexploded shells in farmland of former battlefields in France. Unusually both coil pairs were used for detection. The 1919 photo at the right is a later version of Gutton&#x27;s detector.

=== Modern developments ===
The modern development of the metal detector began in the 1920s. Gerhard Fischer had developed a system of radio direction-finding, which was to be used for accurate navigation. The system worked extremely well, but Fischer noticed there were anomalies in areas where the terrain contained ore-bearing rocks. He reasoned that if a radio beam could be distorted by metal, then it should be possible to design a machine which would detect metal using a search coil resonating at a radio frequency. In 1925 he applied for, and was granted, the first patent for an electronic metal detector. Although Gerhard Fischer was the first person granted a patent for an electronic metal detector, the first to apply was Shirl Herr, a businessman from Crawfordsville, Indiana. His application for a hand-held Hidden-Metal Detector was filed in February 1924, but not patented until July 1928. Herr assisted Italian leader Benito Mussolini in recovering items remaining from the Emperor Caligula&#x27;s galleys at the bottom of Lake Nemi, Italy, in August 1929. Herr&#x27;s invention was used by Admiral Richard Byrd&#x27;s Second Antarctic Expedition in 1933, when it was used to locate objects left behind by earlier explorers. It was effective up to a depth of eight feet.
However, it was one Lieutenant Józef Stanisław Kosacki, a Polish officer attached to a unit stationed in St Andrews, Fife, Scotland, during the early years of World War II, who refined the design into a practical Polish mine detector.
These units were still quite heavy, as they ran on vacuum tubes, and needed separate battery packs.

The design invented by Kosacki was used extensively during the Second Battle of El Alamein when 500 units were shipped to Field Marshal Montgomery to clear the minefields of the retreating Germans, and later used during the Allied invasion of Sicily, the Allied invasion of Italy and the Invasion of Normandy.

As the creation and refinement of the device was a wartime military research operation, the knowledge that Kosacki created the first practical metal detector was kept secret for over 50 years.

===Beat frequency induction===
Many manufacturers of these new devices brought their own ideas to the market. White&#x27;s Electronics of Oregon began in the 1950s by building a machine called the Oremaster Geiger Counter. Another leader in detector technology was Charles Garrett, who pioneered the BFO (beat frequency oscillator) machine. With the invention and development of the transistor in the 1950s and 1960s, metal detector manufacturers and designers made smaller, lighter machines with improved circuitry, running on small battery packs. Companies sprang up all over the United States and Britain to supply the growing demand. Beat Frequency Induction requires movement of the detector coil; akin to how swinging a conductor near a magnet induces an electric current.

===Refinements===
Modern top models are fully computerized, using integrated circuit technology to allow the user to set sensitivity, discrimination, track speed, threshold volume, notch filters, etc., and hold these parameters in memory for future use. Compared to just a decade ago, detectors are lighter, deeper-seeking, use less battery power, and discriminate better.

State-of-the-art metal detectors have further incorporated extensive wireless technologies for the earphones, connect to Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth devices. Some also utilize built in GPS locator technology to keep track of searching location and the location of items found. Some connect to smartphone applications to further extend functionality.

===Discriminators===
The biggest technical change in detectors was the development of a tunable induction system. This system involved two coils that are electro-magnetically tuned. One coil acts as an RF transmitter, the other as a receiver; in some cases these can be tuned to between 3 and 100 kHz. When metal is in their vicinity, a signal is detected owing to eddy currents induced in the metal. What allowed detectors to discriminate between metals was the fact that every metal has a different phase response when exposed to alternating current; longer waves (low frequency) penetrate ground deeper, and select for high-conductivity targets like silver, and copper; than shorter waves (higher frequency) which, while less ground penetrating, select for low-conductivity targets like iron. Unfortunately, high frequency is also sensitive to ground mineralization interference. This selectivity or discrimination allowed detectors to be developed that could selectively detect desirable metals, while ignoring undesirable ones.

Even with discriminators, it was still a challenge to avoid undesirable metals, because some of them have similar phase responses (e.g. tinfoil and gold), particularly in alloy form. Thus, improperly tuning out certain metals increased the risk of passing over a valuable find. Another disadvantage of discriminators was that they reduced the sensitivity of the machines.

===New coil designs===
Coil designers also tried out innovative designs. The original induction balance coil system consisted of two identical coils placed on top of one another. Compass Electronics produced a new design: two coils in a D shape, mounted back-to-back to form a circle. The system was widely used in the 1970s, and both concentric and double D type (or widescan as they became known) had their fans. Another development was the invention of detectors which could cancel out the effect of mineralization in the ground. This gave greater depth, but was a non-discriminate mode. It worked best at lower frequencies than those used before, and frequencies of 3 to 20 kHz were found to produce the best results. Many detectors in the 1970s had a switch which enabled the user to switch between the discriminate mode and the non-discriminate mode. Later developments switched electronically between both modes. The development of the induction balance detector would ultimately result in the motion detector, which constantly checked and balanced the background mineralization.

===Pulse induction===
At the same time, developers were looking at using a different technique in metal detection called pulse induction. Unlike the beat frequency oscillator or the induction balance machines, which both used a uniform alternating current at a low frequency, the pulse induction (PI) machine simply magnetized the ground with a relatively powerful, momentary current through a search coil. In the absence of metal, the field decayed at a uniform rate, and the time it took to fall to zero volts could be accurately measured. However, if metal was present when the machine fired, a small eddy current would be induced in the metal, and the time for sensed current decay would be increased. These time differences were minute, but the improvement in electronics made it possible to measure them accurately and identify the presence of metal at a reasonable distance. These new machines had one major advantage: they were mostly impervious to the effects of mineralization, and rings and other jewelry could now be located even under highly mineralized black sand. The addition of computer control and digital signal processing have further improved pulse induction sensors.

One particular advantage of using a pulse induction detector includes the ability to ignore the minerals contained within heavily mineralized soil; in some cases the heavy mineral content may even help the PI detector function better. Where a VLF detector is affected negatively by soil mineralization, a PI unit is not.

==Uses==

Large portable metal detectors are used by archaeologists and treasure hunters to locate metallic items, such as jewelry, coins, clothes buttons and other accessories, bullets, and other various artifacts buried beneath the surface.

=== Archaeology ===
Metal detectors are widely used in archaeology with the first recorded use by military historian Don Rickey in 1958 who used one to detect the firing lines at Little Big Horn. However archaeologists oppose the use of metal detectors by &quot;artifact seekers&quot; or &quot;site looters&quot; whose activities disrupt archaeological sites. The problem with use of metal detectors in archaeological sites or hobbyist who find objects of archeological interest is that the context that the object was found in is lost and no detailed survey of its surroundings is made. Outside of known sites the significance of objects may not be apparent to a metal detector hobbyist.

====England and Wales====
In England and Wales, metal detecting is legal provided that the landowner has granted permission and that the area is not a Scheduled Ancient Monument, a site of special scientific interest (SSSI), or covered by elements of the Countryside Stewardship Scheme.

The Treasure Act 1996 governs whether or not items that have been discovered are defined as treasure. 
Finders of items that the Act defines as treasure must report their finds to the local coroner.
If they discover items which are not defined as treasure but that are of cultural or historical interest, finders can voluntarily report them to the Portable Antiquities Scheme and the UK Detector Finds Database.

====France====
The sale of metal detectors is allowed in France. The first use of metal detectors in France which led to archaeological discoveries occurred in 1958: people living in the city of Graincourt-lès-Havrincourt who were seeking copper from World War I bombshell with military mine detector found a Roman silver treasure. The French law on metal detecting is ambiguous because it refers only to the objective pursued by the user of a metal detector. The first law to regulate the use of metal detectors was Law No. 89–900 of 18 December 1989. This last is resumed without any change in Article L. 542–1 of the code of the heritage, which states that &quot;no person may use the equipment for the detection of metal objects, for the purpose of research monuments and items of interest prehistory, history, art and archeology without having previously obtained an administrative authorization issued based on the applicant&#x27;s qualification and the nature and method of research.&quot;

Outside the research of archaeological objects, using a metal detector does not require specific authorization, except that of the owner of the land. Asked about Law No. 89–900 of 18 December 1989 by a member of parliament, Jack Lang, Minister of Culture at the time, replied by letter the following: &quot;The new law does not prohibit the use of metal detectors but only regulates the use. If the purpose of such use is the search for archaeological remains, prior authorization is required from my services. Apart from this case, the law ask to be reported to the appropriate authorities an accidental discovery of archaeological remains.&quot; The entire letter of Jack Lang was published in 1990 in a French metal detection magazine, and then, to be visible on the internet, scanned with permission of the author of the magazine on a French metal detection website.

====Northern Ireland====
In Northern Ireland, it is an offence to be in possession of a metal detector on a scheduled or a State Care site without a licence from the Department for Communities. It is also illegal to remove an archaeological object found with a detector from such a site without written consent.

====Republic of Ireland====
In the Republic of Ireland, laws against metal detecting are very strict: it is illegal to use a detection device to search for archaeological objects anywhere within the State or its territorial seas without the prior written consent of the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, and it is illegal to promote the sale or use of detection devices for the purposes of searching for archaeological objects.

====Scotland====
Under the Scots law principle of &quot;bona vacantia&quot;, the Crown has claim over any object of any material value where the original owner cannot be traced. There is also no 300 year limit to Scottish finds. Any artifact found, whether by metal detector survey or from an archaeological excavation, must be reported to the Crown through the Treasure Trove Advisory Panel at the National Museums of Scotland. The panel then determines what will happen to the artifacts. Reporting is not voluntary, and failure to report the discovery of historic artifacts is a criminal offence in Scotland.

====United States====
The sale of metal detectors is allowed in the United States. People can use metal detectors in public places (parks, beaches, etc.) and on private property with the permission of the owner of the site. In the United States, cooperation between archeologists hunting for the location of colonial-era Native American villages and hobbyists has been productive.

===As a hobby===

There are various types of hobby activities involving metal detectors:
* Coin shooting is specifically targeting coins. Some coin shooters conduct historical research to locate sites with potential to give up historical and collectible coins.
* Prospecting is looking for valuable metals like gold, silver, and copper in their natural forms, such as nuggets or flakes.
* Metal detectors are also used to search for discarded or lost, valuable man-made objects such as jewelry, mobile phones, cameras and other devices. Some metal detectors are waterproof, to allow the user to search for submerged objects in areas of shallow water. 
* General metal detecting is very similar to coin shooting except the user is after any type of historical artifact. Detectorists may be dedicated to preserving historical artifacts, and often have considerable expertise. Coins, bullets, buttons, axe heads, and buckles are just a few of the items that are commonly found by relic hunters; in general the potential is far greater in Europe and Asia than in many other parts of the world. More valuable finds in Britain alone include the Staffordshire Hoard of Anglo-Saxon gold, sold for £3,285,000, the gold Celtic Newark Torc, the Ringlemere Cup, West Bagborough Hoard, Milton Keynes Hoard, Roman Crosby Garrett Helmet, Stirling Hoard, Collette Hoard and thousands of smaller finds.
* Beach combing is hunting for lost coins or jewelry on a beach. Beach hunting can be as simple or as complicated as one wishes to make it. Many dedicated beach hunters also familiarize themselves with tide movements and beach erosion.
* Metal detecting clubs exist for hobbyists to learn from others, show off finds from their hunts and to learn more about the hobby.

Hobbyists often use their own metal detecting lingo when discussing the hobby with others.

====Politics and conflicts in the metal detecting hobby in the United States====
The metal detecting community and professional archaeologists have different ideas related to the recovery and preservation of historic finds and locations. Archaeologists claim that detector hobbyists take an artifact-centric approach, removing these from their context resulting in a permanent loss of historical information. Archaeological looting of places like Slack Farm in 1987 and Petersburg National Battlefield serve as evidence against allowing unsupervised metal detecting in historic locations.

===Security screening===
In 1926, two Leipzig, Germany scientists installed a walk-though enclosure at a factory, to ensure that employees were not exiting with prohibited metallic items.

A series of aircraft hijackings led the United States in 1972 to adopt metal detector technology to screen airline passengers, initially using magnetometers that were originally designed for logging operations to detect spikes in trees. The Finnish company Outokumpu adapted mining metal detectors in the 1970s, still housed in a large cylindrical pipe, to make a commercial walk-through security detector. The development of these systems continued in a spin-off company and systems branded as Metor Metal Detectors evolved in the form of the rectangular gantry now standard in airports. In common with the developments in other uses of metal detectors both alternating current and pulse systems are used, and the design of the coils and the electronics has moved forward to improve the discrimination of these systems. In 1995 systems such as the Metor 200 appeared with the ability to indicate the approximate height of the metal object above the ground, enabling security personnel to more rapidly locate the source of the signal. Smaller hand held metal detectors are also used to locate a metal object on a person more precisely.

=== Industrial metal detectors ===

Contamination of food by metal shards from broken processing machinery during the manufacturing process is a major safety issue in the food industry. Most food processing equipment is made of stainless steel, and other components made of plastic or elastomers can be manufactured with embedded metallic particles, allowing them to be detected as well. Metal detectors for this purpose are widely used and integrated into the production line.

Current practice at garment or apparel industry plants is to apply metal detecting after the garments are completely sewn and before garments are packed to check whether there is any metal contamination (needle, broken needle, etc.) in the garments. This needs to be done for safety reasons.

The industrial metal detector was developed by Bruce Kerr and David Hiscock in 1947. The founding company Goring Kerr
pioneered the use and development of the first industrial metal detector. Mars Incorporated was one of the first customers of Goring Kerr using their Metlokate metal detector to inspect Mars bars.

The basic principle of operation for the common industrial metal detector is based on a 3-coil design. This design utilizes an AM (amplitude modulated) transmitting coil and two receiving coils one on either side of the transmitter. The design and physical configuration of the receiving coils are instrumental in the ability to detect very small metal contaminates of 1 mm or smaller. Today modern metal detectors continue to utilize this configuration for the detection of tramp metal.

The coil configuration is such that it creates an opening whereby the product (food, plastics, pharmaceuticals, etc.) passes through the coils. This opening or aperture allows the product to enter and exit through the three-coil system, producing an equal but mirrored signal on the two receiving coils. The resulting signals are summed together effectively nullifying each other. Fortress Technology innovated a new feature, that allows the coil structure of their BSH Model to ignore the effects of vibration, even when inspecting conductive products.

When a metal contaminant is introduced into the product an unequal disturbance is created. That creates a very small electronic signal. After suitable amplification a mechanical device mounted to the conveyor system is signaled to remove the contaminated product from the production line. This process is completely automated and allows manufacturing to operate uninterrupted.

===Civil engineering===

In civil engineering, special metal detectors (cover meters) are used to locate reinforcement bars inside walls.

The most common type of metal detector is a hand-held metal detector or coil-based detectors using oval-shaped disks with built-in copper coils. The search coil works as sensing probe and must be moved over the ground to detect potential metal targets buried underground. When the search coil detects metal objects, the device gives an audible signal via speaker or earphone. In most units, the feedback is an analog or digital indicator.

The metal detectors were first invented and manufactured commercially in the United States by Fisher Labs in the 1930s; other companies like Garrett established and developed the metal detectors in terms of technology and features in the following decades.

=== Military ===

The first metal detector proved inductance changes to be a practical metal detection technique, and it served as the prototype for all subsequent metal detectors.

Initially these machines were huge and complex. After Lee de Forest invented the triode in 1907 metal detectors used vacuum tubes to operate and became more sensitive but still quite cumbersome. One of the early common uses of the first metal detectors, for example, was the detection of landmines and unexploded bombs in a number of European countries following the First and Second World Wars.

==== Uses and benefits ====
Metal detectors can be used for several military uses, including:

*Exposing mines planted during the war or after the end of the war
*Detecting dangerous explosives and cluster bombs dangerous to people&#x27;s lives
*Hand-held metal detectors can be used to search people for weapons and explosives

==== War mine detection ====
Demining, also known as mine removal, is the method of clearing a field of landmines. The aim of military operations is to clear a path through a minefield as quickly as possible, which is mostly accomplished using equipment like mine plows and blast waves.

Humanitarian demining aims to clear all landmines to a certain depth and make the land secure for human use. Landmine detection techniques have been studied in various forms. Detection of mines can be done by a specially designed metal detector tuned to detect mines and bombs. Electromagnetic technologies have been used in conjunction with ground-penetrating radar. Specially trained dogs are often used to focus the search and confirm that an area has been cleared, mines are often cleared using mechanical equipment such as flails and excavators.

=== First idea ===
The first metal detector was likely the simple electric conduction metal detector ca. 1830. Electric conduction was also used to locate metal ore bodies by measuring the conductivity between metal rods driven into the ground.

In 1862, Italian General Giuseppe Garibaldi was wounded in the foot. It was difficult to distinguish between bullet, bone, and cartilage. So Professor Favre of Marseilles quickly built a simple probe that was inserted into the track of the bullet. It had two sharp points connected to a battery and a bell. Contact with metal completed the circuit and rang the bell. In 1867, Mr. Sylvan de Wilde had a similar detector and an extractor also wired to a bell.
In 1870, Gustave Trouvé, a French electrical engineer also had a similar device however his buzzer made a different sound for lead and iron.
The electric bullet locators were in use until the advent of X-rays.

=== Technology development ===

====Gerhard Fischer====

Gerhard Fischer developed a portable metal detector in 1925. His model was first marketed commercially in 1931; he was responsible for the first large-scale hand-held metal detector development.

Gerhard Fisher studied electronics at the University of Dresden before emigrating to the United States. When working as a research engineer in Los Angeles, he came up with the concept of a portable metal detector while working with aircraft radio detection finders. Fisher shared the concept with Albert Einstein, who foresaw the widespread use of hand-held metal detectors.

Fisher, the founder of Fisher Research Laboratory, was contracted by the Federal Telegraph Company and Western Air Express to establish airborne direction finding equipment in the late 1920s. He received some of the first patents in the area of radio-based airborne direction finding. He came across some unusual errors in the course of his work; once he figured out what was wrong, he had the foresight to apply the solution to a totally unrelated area, metal and mineral detection.&quot;

Fisher received the patent for the first portable electronic metal detector in 1925. In 1931, he marketed his first Fisher device to the general public, and he established a famous Fisher Labs company that started to manufacture and develop hand-held metal detectors and sell it commercially.

====Charles Garrett====

Despite the fact that Fisher was the first to receive a patent for an electronic metal detector, he was only one of many who improved and mastered the device. Charles Garrett, the founder of Garrett Metal Detectors, was another key figure in the creation of today&#x27;s metal detectors.

Garrett, an electrical engineer by profession, began metal detecting as a pastime in the early 1960s. He tried a number of machines on the market but couldn&#x27;t find one that could do what he needed. As a result, he started developing his own metal detector. He was able to develop a system that removed oscillator drift, as well as many special search coils that he patented, both of which effectively revolutionized metal detector design at the time.

==== To present day ====

In the 1960s, the first industrial metal detectors were produced, and they were widely used for mineral prospecting and other industrial purposes. De-mining (the detection of landmines), the detection of weapons such as knives and guns (particularly in airport security), geophysical prospecting, archaeology, and treasure hunting are just some of the applications.

Metal detectors are also used to detect foreign bodies in food, as well as steel reinforcement bars in concrete and pipes. The building industry uses them to find wires buried in walls or floors.

=== Discriminators and circuits ===
The development of transistors, discriminators, modern search coil designs, and wireless technology significantly impacted the design of metal detectors as we know them today: lightweight, compact, easy-to-use, and deep-seeking systems. The invention of a tunable induction device was the most significant technological advancement in detectors. Two electro-magnetically tuned coils were used in this method. One coil serves as an RF transmitter, while the other serves as a receiver; in some situations, these coils may be tuned to frequencies ranging from 3 to 100 kHz.

Due to eddy currents induced in the metal, a signal is detected when metal is present. The fact that every metal has a different phase response when exposed to alternating current allowed detectors to differentiate between metals. Longer waves (low frequency) penetrate the ground deeper and select for high conductivity targets like silver and copper, while shorter waves (higher frequency) select for low conductivity targets like iron. Unfortunately, ground mineralization interference affects high frequency as well. This selectivity or discrimination allowed the development of detectors that can selectively detect desirable metals.

Even with discriminators, avoiding undesirable metals was difficult because some of them have similar phase responses (for example, tinfoil and gold), particularly in alloy form. As a result, tuning out those metals incorrectly increased the chance of missing a valuable discovery. Discriminators also had the downside of lowering the sensitivity of the devices.

<text>The ampere-turn (symbol A⋅t) is the MKS (metre–kilogram–second) unit of magnetomotive force (MMF), represented by a direct current of one ampere flowing in a single-turn loop. &quot;Turns&quot; refers to the winding number of an electrical conductor composing an electromagnetic coil. 
For example, a current of flowing through a coil of 10 turns produces an MMF of .
The corresponding physical quantity is &quot;NI&quot;, the product of the number of turns, &quot;N&quot;, and the current, &quot;I&quot;; it has been used in industry, specifically, US-based coil-making industries.

By maintaining the same current and increasing the number of loops or turns of the coil, the strength of the magnetic field increases because each loop or turn of the coil sets up its own magnetic field. The magnetic field unites with the fields of the other loops to produce the field around the entire coil, making the total magnetic field stronger. 

The strength of the magnetic field is not linearly related to the ampere-turns when a magnetic material is used as a part of the system. Also, the material within the magnet carrying the magnetic flux &quot;saturates&quot; at some point, after which adding more ampere-turns has little effect. 

The ampere-turn corresponds to gilberts, the corresponding CGS unit.

In Thomas Edison&#x27;s laboratory Francis Upton was the lead mathematician. Trained with Helmholtz in Germany, he used &quot;weber&quot; as the name of the unit of current, modified to &quot;ampere&quot; later:
:When conducting his investigations, Upton always noted the Weber turns and with his other data had all that was necessary to put the results of his work in proper form.
:He discovered that a Weber turn (that is, an ampere turn) was a constant factor, a given number of which always produced the same effect magnetically.

<text>The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale is a futuristic dystopian novel by Canadian author Margaret Atwood published in 1985. It is set in a near-future New England in a patriarchal, totalitarian theonomic state known as the Republic of Gilead, which has overthrown the United States government. Offred is the central character and narrator and one of the &quot;Handmaids&quot;: women who are forcibly assigned to produce children for the &quot;Commanders&quot;, who are the ruling class in Gilead.

The novel explores themes of powerless women in a patriarchal society, loss of female agency and individuality, suppression of reproductive rights, and the various means by which women resist and try to gain individuality and independence. The title echoes the component parts of Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, which is a series of connected stories (such as &quot;The Merchant&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;The Parson&#x27;s Tale&quot;). It also alludes to the tradition of fairy tales where the central character tells her story.

&quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; won the 1985 Governor General&#x27;s Award and the first Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1987; it was also nominated for the 1986 Nebula Award, the 1986 Booker Prize, and the 1987 Prometheus Award. In 2022, &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; was included on the &quot;Big Jubilee Read&quot; list of 70 books by Commonwealth authors, selected to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The book has been adapted into a 1990 film, a 2000 opera, a 2017 television series, and other media. A sequel novel, &quot;The Testaments&quot;, was published in 2019.

==Plot summary==
After staging an attack killing the president of the United States and most of Congress, a radical political group called the &quot;Sons of Jacob&quot; uses theonomic ideology to launch a revolution. The Constitution is suspended, newspapers are censored, and the United States of America is reformed into a military dictatorship known as the Republic of Gilead. The new regime quickly consolidates its power, overtaking all other religious groups, including Christian denominations.

The regime reorganizes society using a peculiar interpretation of some Old Testament ideas, and a new militarized, hierarchical model of social and religious fanaticism among its newly created social classes. One of the most significant changes is the limitation of women&#x27;s rights. Women become the lowest-ranking class and are not allowed to own money or property, or to read and write. Most significantly, women are deprived of control over their own reproductive functions. Though the regime controls most of the country, various rebel groups remain active.

The story is told in first-person narration by a woman named Offred, a criminal guilty of trying to escape to Canada with a forged passport alongside her husband and 5-year-old daughter; she is also considered an adulterer for being married to a divorced man. Her marriage was forcibly dissolved, and her daughter was taken from her. Instead of being sentenced under the Republic of Gilead&#x27;s draconian criminal justice system, Offred accepted training to become a &quot;Handmaid&quot; at the Rachel and Leah Centre, an alternative only available to fertile women: environmental pollution and radiation have drastically affected fertility, and she is one of the few remaining women who can conceive. She has been assigned to produce children for the &quot;Commanders&quot;, the ruling class of men, and is made a Handmaid, a role based on the biblical story of Rachel and her handmaid Bilhah. 

Women are classed socially and follow a strict dress code, ranked highest to lowest: the Commanders&#x27; Wives in sky blue, their unmarried daughters in white, the Handmaids in red with highly visible large white bonnets, the Aunts (who train and indoctrinate the Handmaids) in brown, the Marthas (cooks and maids, possibly unmarried sterile women past child-bearing years) in green, Econowives (the wives of lower-ranking men who handle everything in the domestic sphere) in blue, red and green stripes, and widows in black.

Offred details her life starting with her third assignment as a Handmaid to a Commander. Interspersing narratives of her present-day experiences are flashbacks of her life before and during the beginning of the revolution, including her failed escape, indoctrination by the Aunts, and her friend Moira&#x27;s escape from the indoctrination facility. At her new home, she is treated poorly by the Commander&#x27;s wife, Serena Joy, a former Christian media personality who supported women&#x27;s domesticity and subordinate role well before Gilead was established.

To Offred&#x27;s surprise, the Commander asks to see her outside of the &quot;Ceremony&quot;, ritualized rape conducted during the Handmaids’ likely fertile period each month, with the wives present, intended to result in conception. His request to see her in the library is illegal in Gilead, but they meet nevertheless. They mostly play &quot;Scrabble&quot; and Offred is allowed to ask favors of him, such as information or material items. He asks Offred to kiss him as if she meant it and tells her about his strained relationship with his wife. Finally, he gives her lingerie and takes her to a covert, government-run brothel using Jezebels, women forced into sanctioned sex slavery. Offred unexpectedly encounters an emotionally-broken Moira there, who tells her that those found breaking the law are sent to the &quot;Colonies&quot; to clean up toxic waste or are allowed to work as Jezebels as punishment.

In the days between her visits to the Commander, Offred also learns her shopping partner, a woman called Ofglen, is with the Mayday resistance, an underground network working to overthrow Gilead&#x27;s government. Not knowing of Offred&#x27;s criminal acts with her husband, Serena begins to suspect that he is infertile, so she arranges for Offred to have sex with Nick, the Commander&#x27;s personal servant, who had attempted to talk to her before and shown interest. Serena offers Offred information about her daughter in exchange. She later brings her a photograph of Offred&#x27;s daughter which leaves Offred feeling dejected believing she has been erased from her daughter&#x27;s life.

After their initial sexual encounter, Offred and Nick begin to meet on their own initiative as well; she discovers that she enjoys these intimate moments despite memories of her husband, and shares potentially dangerous information about her past with him. Offred later tells Nick that she thinks she is pregnant.

Offred hears from a new walking partner that Ofglen has disappeared (reported as a suicide). She contemplates suicide when Serena finds evidence of the illegal relationship with the Commander. Shortly afterward, men arrive at the house wearing uniforms of the secret police, known as the Eyes of God or simply &quot;Eyes&quot;, to take her away. As she is led to a waiting van, Nick tells her to trust him and go with the men. Offred is unsure if Nick or the men are Eyes or secretly members of Mayday, or if they are here to capture her or aid in her escape; she ultimately enters the van. Her future is left uncertain while Serena and the Commander are left bereft in their house, each thinking about the repercussions of Offred&#x27;s capture on their lives.

The novel concludes with a metafictional epilogue, described as a partial transcript of an international historical association conference taking place in the year 2195. The male keynote speaker explains that Offred&#x27;s narrative was originally recorded on a set of audio cassettes, a technology roughly 200 years out of date at that time, and later transcribed by historians. The speaker appears to be very dismissive of the misogyny of Gilead and interprets the story&#x27;s title as a sexist joke. He also comments on the difficulty of authenticating the account, due to how few records have survived from the early years of Gilead&#x27;s existence, and speculates on the eventual fates of Offred and her acquaintances.

== Background ==
Fitting with her statements that &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; is a work of speculative fiction, not science fiction, Atwood&#x27;s novel offers a satirical view of various social, political, and religious trends of the United States in the 1980s. Her motivation for writing the novel was her belief that in the 1980s, the religious right was discussing what they would do with/to women if they took power, including the Moral Majority, the Christian Coalition, and the Ronald Reagan administration. Atwood questions what would happen if these trends, and especially &quot;casually held attitudes about women&quot; were taken to their logical end.

Atwood argues that all of the scenarios offered in &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; have actually occurred in real life—in an interview she gave regarding her later novel &quot;Oryx and Crake&quot;, Atwood maintains that &quot;As with &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, I didn&#x27;t put in anything that we haven&#x27;t already done, we&#x27;re not already doing, we&#x27;re seriously trying to do, coupled with trends that are already in progress... So all of those things are real, and therefore the amount of pure invention is close to nil.&quot; Atwood was known to carry around newspaper clippings to her various interviews to support her fiction&#x27;s basis in reality. Atwood has explained that &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; is a response to those who say the oppressive, totalitarian, and religious governments that have taken hold in other countries throughout the years &quot;can&#x27;t happen here&quot;—but in this work, she has tried to show how such a takeover might play out.

Atwood was also inspired by the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1978–79 that saw a theocracy established that drastically reduced the rights of women and imposed a strict dress code on Iranian women, very much like that of Gilead. In &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, a reference is made to the Islamic Republic of Iran in the form of the history book &quot;Iran and Gilead: Two Late Twentieth Century Monotheocracies&quot; mentioned in the endnotes describing the historians&#x27; convention in 2195. Atwood&#x27;s picture of a society ruled by men who professed high moral principles, but are in fact self-interested and selfish was inspired by observing Canadian politicians in action, especially in her hometown of Toronto, who frequently profess in a very sanctimonious manner to be acting from the highest principles of morality while in reality the opposite is the case.

During the Second World War, Canadian women took on jobs in the place of men serving in the military that they were expected to yield to men once the war was over. After 1945, not all women wanted to return to their traditional roles as housewives and mothers, leading to a male backlash. Atwood was born in 1939, and while growing up in the 1950s she saw first-hand the complaints against women who continued to work after 1945 and of women who unhappily gave up their jobs, which she incorporated into her novel. The way in which the narrator is forced into becoming an unhappy housewife after she loses her job, in common with all the other women of Gilead, was inspired by Atwood&#x27;s memories of the 1950s.

Atwood&#x27;s inspiration for the Republic of Gilead came from her study of early American Puritans while at Harvard, which she attended on a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship. Atwood argues that the modern view of the Puritans—that they came to America to flee religious persecution in England and set up a religiously tolerant society—is misleading, and that instead, these Puritan leaders wanted to establish a monolithic theonomy where religious dissent would not be tolerated.

Atwood has a personal connection to the Puritans, and she dedicates the novel to her own ancestor Mary Webster, who was accused of witchcraft in Puritan New England but survived her hanging. Due to the totalitarian nature of Gileadean society, Atwood, in creating the setting, drew from the &quot;utopian idealism&quot; present in 20th-century régimes, such as Cambodia and Romania, as well as earlier New England Puritanism. Atwood has argued that a coup, such as the one depicted in &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, would misuse religion in order to achieve its own ends.

Atwood, in regards to those leading Gilead, further stated:
I don&#x27;t consider these people to be Christians because they do not have at the core of their behaviour and ideologies what I, in my feeble Canadian way, would consider to be the core of Christianity ... and that would be not only love your neighbours but love your enemies. That would also be &quot;I was sick and you visited me not&quot; and such and such ...And that would include also concern for the environment, because you can&#x27;t love your neighbour or even your enemy, unless you love your neighbour&#x27;s oxygen, food, and water. You can&#x27;t love your neighbour or your enemy if you&#x27;re presuming policies that are going to cause those people to die. ... Of course faith can be a force for good and often has been. So faith is a force for good particularly when people are feeling beleaguered and in need of hope. So you can have bad iterations and you can also have the iteration in which people have got too much power and then start abusing it. But that is human behaviour, so you can&#x27;t lay it down to religion. You can find the same in any power situation, such as politics or ideologies that purport to be atheist. Need I mention the former Soviet Union? So it is not a question of religion making people behave badly. It is a question of human beings getting power and then wanting more of it.

In the same vein, Atwood also declared that &quot;In the real world today, some religious groups are leading movements for the protection of vulnerable groups, including women.&quot; Atwood draws connections between the ways in which Gilead&#x27;s leaders maintain their power and other examples of actual totalitarian governments. In her interviews, Atwood offers up Afghanistan as an example of a religious theocracy forcing women out of the public sphere and into their homes, as in Gilead.

The &quot;state-sanctioned murder of dissidents&quot; was inspired by the Philippines under President Ferdinand Marcos, and the last General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s obsession with increasing the birth rate (Decree 770) led to the strict policing of pregnant women and the outlawing of birth control and abortion. However, Atwood clearly explains that many of these actions were not just present in other cultures and countries, &quot;but within Western society, and within the &#x27;Christian&#x27; tradition itself&quot;.

The Republic of Gilead struggles with infertility, making Offred&#x27;s services as a Handmaid vital to producing children and thus reproducing the society. Handmaids themselves are &quot;untouchable&quot;, but their ability to signify status is equated to that of slaves or servants throughout history. Atwood connects their concerns with infertility to real-life problems our world faces, such as radiation, chemical pollution, and sexually transmitted disease (HIV/AIDS is specifically mentioned in the &quot;Historical Notes&quot; section at the end of the novel, which was a relatively new disease at the time of Atwood&#x27;s writing whose long-term impact was still unknown). Atwood&#x27;s strong stance on environmental issues and their negative consequences for our society has presented itself in other works such as her &quot;MaddAddam&quot; trilogy, and refers back to her growing up with biologists and her own scientific curiosity.

==Characters==
===Offred===
Offred is the protagonist and narrator who takes the readers through life in Gilead. She was labelled a &quot;wanton woman&quot; when Gilead was established because she had married a man who was divorced. All divorces were nullified by the new government, meaning her husband was now considered still married to his first wife, making Offred an adulteress. In trying to escape Gilead, she was separated from her husband and daughter.

She is part of the first generation of Gilead&#x27;s women, those who remember pre-Gilead times. Proved fertile, she is considered an important commodity and has been placed as a &quot;Handmaid&quot; in the home of &quot;the Commander&quot; and his wife Serena Joy, to bear a child for them (Serena Joy is believed to be infertile). Readers are able to see Offred&#x27;s resistance to the Republic of Gilead on the inside through her thoughts.

Sometimes Offred has thoughts most readers would disagree with, such as the Ceremony not being rape because she agreed to be a Handmaid, despite the implication that she had no real choice (the alternative may have been execution, or hard labour cleaning nuclear waste). This may be a belief she has adapted to lessen her mental strain, or may be due to brainwashing during her Handmaid training.

Offred is a slave name that describes her function: she is &quot;of Fred&quot; (i.e., she belongs to Fred – presumed to be the name of the Commander – and is considered a concubine). In the novel, Offred says that she is &quot;not&quot; a concubine, but a tool; a &quot;two-legged womb&quot;. The Handmaids&#x27; names say nothing about who the women really are; their only identity is as the Commander&#x27;s property. &quot;Offred&quot; is also a pun on the word &quot;offered&quot;, as in &quot;offered as a sacrifice&quot;, and &quot;of red&quot; because the red dress assigned for the Handmaids in Gilead.

In Atwood&#x27;s original novel, Offred&#x27;s real name is never revealed. In Volker Schlöndorff&#x27;s 1990 film adaptation Offred was given the real name Kate, while the television series gave her the real name June.

The women in training to be Handmaids whisper names across their beds at night. The names are &quot;Alma. Janine. Dolores. Moira. June&quot;, and all are later accounted for except June. In addition, one of the Aunts tells the Handmaids-in-training to stop &quot;mooning and June-ing&quot;. From this and other references, some readers have inferred that her birth name could be &quot;June&quot;. Academic Madonne Miner suggests that &quot;June&quot; is a pseudonym. As &quot;Mayday&quot; is the name of the Gilead resistance, June could be an invention by the protagonist. The Nunavut conference covered in the epilogue takes place in June.

When the Hulu TV series chose to state outright that Offred&#x27;s real name is June, Atwood wrote that it was not her original intention to imply that Offred&#x27;s real name is June &quot;but it fits, so readers are welcome to it if they wish&quot;. The revelation of Offred&#x27;s real name serves only to humanize her in the presence of the other Handmaids.

===Commander===
The Commander says that he was a scientist and was previously involved in something similar to market research before Gilead&#x27;s inception. Later, it is hypothesized, but not confirmed, that he might have been one of the architects of the Republic and its laws. Presumably, his first name is &quot;Fred&quot;, though that, too, may be a pseudonym. He engages in forbidden intellectual pursuits with Offred, such as playing &quot;Scrabble&quot;, and introduces her to a secret club that serves as a brothel for high-ranking officers.

He shows his softer side to Offred during their covert meetings and confesses of being &quot;misunderstood&quot; by his wife. Offred learns that the Commander carried on a similar relationship with his previous Handmaid, who later killed herself when his wife found out.

In the epilogue, Professor Pieixoto speculates that one of two figures, both instrumental in the establishment of Gilead, may have been the Commander, based on the name &quot;Fred&quot;. It is his belief that the Commander was a man named Frederick R. Waterford who was killed in a purge shortly after Offred was taken away, charged with harbouring an enemy agent.

===Serena Joy===
Serena Joy is a former televangelist and the Commander&#x27;s Wife in the fundamentalist theonomy. Her real name is Pam and she is fond of gardening and knitting. The state took away her power and public recognition, and she tries to hide her past as a television figure. Offred identifies Serena Joy by recalling seeing her on TV when she was a little girl early on Saturday mornings while waiting for the cartoons to air.

Believed to be sterile (although the suggestion is made that the Commander is sterile, Gileadean laws attribute sterility only to women), she is forced to accept that he has use of a Handmaid. She resents having to take part in &quot;The Ceremony&quot;, a monthly fertility ritual. She strikes a deal with Offred to arrange for her to have sex with Nick in order to become pregnant. According to Professor Pieixoto in the epilogue, &quot;Serena Joy&quot; or &quot;Pam&quot; are pseudonyms. The character&#x27;s real name is implied to be Thelma.

===Ofglen===
Ofglen is a neighbour of Offred&#x27;s and a fellow Handmaid. She is partnered with Offred to do the daily shopping. Handmaids are never alone and are expected to police each other&#x27;s behaviour. Ofglen is a secret member of the Mayday resistance. In contrast to Offred, she is daring. She knocks out a Mayday spy who is to be tortured and killed in order to save him the pain of a violent death. Offred is told that when Ofglen vanishes, it is because she has committed suicide before the government can take her into custody due to her membership in the resistance, possibly to avoid giving away any information.

A new Handmaid, also called Ofglen, takes Ofglen&#x27;s place, and is assigned as Offred&#x27;s shopping partner. She threatens Offred against any thought of resistance. In addition, she breaks protocol by telling her what happened to the previous Ofglen.

===Nick===
Nick is the Commander&#x27;s chauffeur, who lives above the garage. Right from the start, Nick comes across as a daring character as he smokes and tries to engage with Offred, both forbidden activities. By Serena Joy&#x27;s arrangement, he and Offred start a sexual relationship to increase her chance of getting pregnant. If she were unable to bear the Commander a child, she would be declared sterile and shipped to the ecological wastelands of the Colonies. Offred begins to develop feelings for him. Nick is an ambiguous character, and Offred does not know if he is a party loyalist or part of the resistance, though he identifies himself as the latter. The epilogue suggests that he really was part of the resistance, and aided Offred in escaping the Commander&#x27;s house.

===Moira===
Moira has been a close friend of Offred&#x27;s since college. In the novel, their relationship represents a female friendship that the Republic of Gilead tries to block. A lesbian, she has resisted the homophobia of Gileadean society. Moira is taken to be a Handmaid soon after Offred. She finds the life of a Handmaid unbearably oppressive and risks engaging with the guards just to defy the system. She escapes by stealing an Aunt&#x27;s pass and clothes, but Offred later finds her working as a prostitute in a party-run brothel. She was caught and chose the brothel rather than to be sent to the Colonies. Moira exemplifies defiance against Gilead by rejecting every value that is forced onto the citizens.

===Luke===
Luke was Offred&#x27;s husband before the formation of Gilead. He was married when he first started a relationship with Offred and divorced his first wife to marry her. Under Gilead, all divorces were retroactively nullified, resulting in Offred being considered an adulteress and their daughter illegitimate. Offred was forced to become a Handmaid and her daughter was given to a loyalist family. Since their attempt to escape to Canada, Offred has heard nothing of Luke. She wavers between believing him dead or imprisoned.

===Professor Pieixoto===
Pieixoto is the &quot;co-discoverer [with Professor Knotly Wade] of Offred&#x27;s tapes&quot;. In his presentation at an academic conference set in 2195, he talks about &quot;the &#x27;Problems of Authentication in Reference to &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;. Pieixoto is the person who is retelling Offred&#x27;s story, and so makes the narration even more unreliable than it was originally.

===Aunt Lydia===
Aunt Lydia appears in flashbacks where her instructions frequently haunt Offred. Aunt Lydia works at the &#x27;Red Center&#x27; where women receive instructions for a life as a Handmaid. Throughout the narrative, Aunt Lydia&#x27;s pithy pronouncements on code of conduct for the Handmaids shed light on the philosophy of subjugation of women practised in Gilead. Aunt Lydia appears to be a true believer of Gilead&#x27;s religious philosophy and seems to take her job as a genuine calling.

In the sequel &quot;The Testaments&quot;, however, Aunt Lydia is revealed to have been aiding anti-Gilead resistance networks. Her actions in releasing internal information to selected contacts instigates an internal purge that demolishes Gilead&#x27;s ability to function and restores the United States. She also writes an autobiography of her life, which she hides in a copy of Cardinal John Henry Newman&#x27;s &quot;Apologia Pro Vita Sua&quot; in the restricted section of the Ardua Hall library.

===Cora===
A Martha (female domestic servants are called Marthas) who works at the Commander&#x27;s house because she is infertile. She hopes that Offred will get pregnant as she desires to help raise a child. She is friendly towards Offred and even covers up for her when she finds her lying on the floor one morning—a suspicious occurrence by Gilead&#x27;s standards, worthy of being reported.

=== Rita ===
Rita is a Martha at the Commander&#x27;s house. Her job is cooking and housekeeping and she is one of the members of the &quot;household&quot;. At the start of the novel, Rita has a contempt for Offred and though she is responsible for keeping Offred well fed, she believes a Handmaid should prefer going to the Colonies over working as a sexual slave.

==Setting==
The novel is set in an indeterminate dystopian future, speculated to be around the year 2005, with a fundamentalist theonomy ruling the territory of what had been the United States but is now the Republic of Gilead. The fertility rates in Gilead have diminished due to environmental toxicity and fertile women are a valuable commodity owned and enslaved by the powerful elite. Individuals are segregated by categories and dressed according to their social functions. Complex dress codes play a key role in imposing social control within the new society and serve to distinguish people by sex, occupation, and caste.

The action takes place in what once was the Harvard Square neighbourhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts; Atwood studied at Radcliffe College, located in this area. As a researcher, Atwood spent a lot of time in the Widener Library at Harvard which in the novel serves as a setting for the headquarters of the Gilead Secret Service.

==Gilead society==
===Religion===
Bruce Miller, the creator and executive producer of &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; television serial, declared with regard to Atwood&#x27;s book, as well as his series, that Gilead is &quot;a society that&#x27;s based kind of in a perverse misreading of Old Testament laws and codes&quot;. The author explains that Gilead tries to embody the &quot;utopian idealism&quot; present in 20th-century regimes, as well as earlier New England Puritanism. Both Atwood and Miller stated that the people running Gilead are &quot;not genuinely Christian&quot;.

The group running Gilead, according to Atwood, is &quot;not really interested in religion; they&#x27;re interested in power&quot;. In her prayers to God, Offred reflects on Gilead and prays &quot;I don&#x27;t believe for an instant that what&#x27;s going on out there is what You meant... I suppose I should say I forgive whoever did this, and whatever they&#x27;re doing now. I&#x27;ll try, but it isn&#x27;t easy.&quot; Margaret Atwood, writing on this, says that &quot;Offred herself has a private version of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer and refuses to believe that this regime has been mandated by a just and merciful God.&quot;

Christian churches that do not support the actions of the Sons of Jacob are systematically demolished, and the people living in Gilead are never seen attending church. Christian denominations, including Quakers, Baptists, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, and Roman Catholics, are specifically named as enemies of the Sons of Jacob. Nuns who refuse conversion are considered &quot;unwomen&quot; and banished to the Colonies, owing to their reluctance to marry and refusal (or inability) to bear children. Priests unwilling to convert are executed and hanged from the Wall. Atwood pits Quaker Christians against the regime by having them help the oppressed, something she feels they would do in reality: &quot;The Quakers have gone underground, and are running an escape route to Canada, as—I suspect—they would.&quot;

Jews are named an exception and classified Sons of Jacob. Offred observes that Jews refusing to convert are allowed to emigrate from Gilead to Israel, and most choose to leave. However, in the epilogue, Professor Pieixoto reveals that many of the emigrating Jews ended up being dumped into the sea while on the ships ostensibly tasked with transporting them to Israel, due to privatization of the &quot;repatriation program&quot; and capitalists&#x27; effort to maximize profits. Offred mentions that many Jews who chose to stay were caught secretly practising Judaism and executed.

===Women===
;Wives: The top social level permitted to women, achieved by marriage to higher-ranking officers (Commanders). Wives always wear blue dresses and cloaks, suggesting traditional depictions of the Virgin Mary in historic Christian art. When a Commander dies, his Wife becomes a Widow and must dress in black until/unless she remarries.

;Daughters: The natural or adopted children of the ruling class. They wear white until marriage, which is arranged by the government. The narrator&#x27;s daughter may have been adopted by an infertile Wife and Commander, and she is shown in a photograph wearing a long white dress.

;Handmaids

:Fertile women whose social function is to bear children for infertile wives. Handmaids dress in ankle-length red dresses, white caps, and heavy boots. In summer, they change into lighter-weight (but still ankle-length) dresses and slatted shoes. When in public, in winter, they wear ankle-length red cloaks, red gloves, and heavy white bonnets, which they call &quot;wings&quot;. The sides of the bonnets stick out like wings, blocking their peripheral vision and shielding their faces from view. Handmaids are women of proven fertility who have broken the law. The law includes both gender crimes, such as lesbianism, and religious crimes, such as adultery (redefined to include sexual relationships with divorced partners since divorce is no longer legal). The Republic of Gilead justifies the use of the Handmaids for procreation by referring to two biblical stories: Genesis 30:1–13 and Genesis 16:1–4. In the first story, Jacob&#x27;s infertile wife Rachel offers up her handmaid Bilhah to be a surrogate mother on her behalf, and then her sister Leah does the same with her own handmaid Zilpah (even though Leah has already given Jacob many sons). In the other story, which appears earlier in Genesis but is cited less frequently, Abraham has sex with his wife&#x27;s handmaid, Hagar. Handmaids are assigned to Commanders and live in their houses. When unassigned, they live at training centres. Handmaids who successfully bear children continue to live at their Commander&#x27;s house until their children are weaned, at which point they are sent to a new assignment to a new Commander. Those who produce children will never be declared &quot;unwomen&quot; or sent to the Colonies, even if they never have another baby.

;Aunts: Trainers of the Handmaids. They dress in brown. Aunts promote the role of Handmaid as an honourable way for a sinful woman to redeem herself. They police the Handmaids, beating some and ordering the maiming of others. The Aunts have an unusual amount of autonomy, compared to other women of Gilead. They are the only class of women permitted to read and write, although this is only to fulfil the administrative aspect of their role.

; Marthas: They are older, infertile women who have domestic skills and are compliant, making them suitable as servants within the households of the Commanders and their families. They dress in green. The title of &quot;Martha&quot; is based on the account of Jesus at the home of Martha and Mary (Gospel of Luke 10:38–42), in which Mary listens to Jesus while her sister Martha works at &quot;all the preparations that had to be made&quot;. The duties of Marthas may be tasked to Guardians of the Faith, paramilitary officers who police Gilead&#x27;s civilian population and guard the Commanders, wherever conflict with Gilead&#x27;s laws may arise, such as with cleaning a Commander&#x27;s study where Marthas could obtain literature.

; Econowives: Women married to men of lower-rank, not members of the elite. They are expected to perform all the female functions: domestic duties, companionship, and child-bearing. Their dress is multicoloured red, blue, and green to reflect these multiple roles, and is made of notably cheaper material.

The division of labour among the women generates some resentment. Marthas, Wives and Econowives perceive Handmaids as promiscuous and are taught to scorn them. Offred mourns that the women of the various groups have lost their ability to empathize with each other.

===The Ceremony===
&quot;The Ceremony&quot; is a non-marital sexual act sanctioned for reproduction. The ritual requires the Handmaid to lie on her back between the legs of the Wife during the sex act as if they were one person. The Wife has to invite the Handmaid to share her power this way; many Wives consider this both humiliating and offensive. Offred describes the ceremony:

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; received critical acclaim, helping to cement Atwood&#x27;s status as a prominent writer of the 20th century. Not only was the book deemed well-written and compelling, but Atwood&#x27;s work was notable for sparking intense debates both in and out of academia. Atwood maintains that the Republic of Gilead is only an extrapolation of trends already seen in the United States at the time of her writing, a view supported by other scholars studying &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;. Many have placed &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; in the same category of dystopian fiction as &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot;, a categorization that Atwood has accepted and reiterated in many articles and interviews.

Even today, many reviewers hold that Atwood&#x27;s novel remains as foreboding and powerful as ever, largely because of its basis in historical fact. Yet when her book was first published in 1985, not all reviewers were convinced of the &quot;cautionary tale&quot; Atwood presented. For example, Mary McCarthy&#x27;s 1986 &quot;New York Times&quot; review argued that &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; lacked the &quot;surprised recognition&quot; necessary for readers to see &quot;our present selves in a distorting mirror, of what we may be turning into if current trends are allowed to continue&quot;.

====Genre classification====

&quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; is a feminist dystopian novel, combining the characteristics of dystopian fiction: &quot;a genre that projects an imaginary society that differs from the author&#x27;s own, first, by being significantly worse in important respects and second by being worse &quot;because&quot; it attempts to reify some utopian ideal&quot;, with the feminist utopian ideal which: &quot;sees men or masculine systems as the major cause of social and political problems (e.g. war), and presents women as not only at least the equals of men but also as the sole arbiters of their reproductive functions&quot;.

&quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; notes that dystopian images are almost invariably images of future society, &quot;pointing fearfully at the way the world is supposedly going in order to provide urgent propaganda for a change in direction&quot;. Atwood&#x27;s stated intent was indeed to dramatize potential consequences of current trends.

In 1985, reviewers hailed the book as a &quot;feminist &quot;1984&quot;&quot;, citing similarities between the totalitarian regimes under which both protagonists live, and &quot;the distinctively modern sense of nightmare come true, the initial paralyzed powerlessness of the victim unable to act&quot;. Scholarly studies have expanded on the place of &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; in the dystopian and feminist traditions.

The classification of utopian and dystopian fiction as a sub-genre of the collective term, speculative fiction, alongside science fiction, fantasy, and horror is a relatively recent convention. Dystopian novels have long been discussed as a type of science fiction; however, with publication of &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, Atwood distinguished the terms science fiction and speculative fiction quite intentionally. In interviews and essays, she has discussed why, observing:

Atwood acknowledges that others may use the terms interchangeably, but she notes her interest in this type of work is to explore themes in ways that &quot;realistic fiction&quot; cannot do.

Among a few science fiction aficionados, however, Atwood&#x27;s comments were considered petty and contemptuous. (The term speculative fiction was indeed employed that way by certain New Wave writers in the 1960s and early 1970s to express their dissatisfaction with traditional or establishment science fiction.) Hugo-winning science fiction critic David Langford observed in a column: &quot;&quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; won the very first Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1987. She&#x27;s been trying to live this down ever since.&quot;

===Reception in schools===
Atwood&#x27;s novels, and especially her works of speculative fiction, &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;Oryx and Crake&quot;, are frequently offered as examples for the final, open-ended question on the American Advanced Placement English Literature and Composition exam each year. As such, her books are often assigned in high-school classrooms to students taking this Advanced Placement course, despite the mature themes the work presents. Atwood herself has expressed surprise that her books are being assigned to high-school audiences, largely due to her own censored education in the 1950s, but she has assured readers that this increased attention from high-school students has not altered the material she has chosen to write about since.

==== Censorship in the United States ====

The American Library Association lists &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; as number 37 on the &quot;100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000&quot;. In 2019, &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; is still listed as the seventh-most challenged book because of profanity, vulgarity, and sexual overtones. Atwood participated in discussing &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; as the subject of an ALA discussion series titled &quot;One Book, One Conference&quot;.
*In 2009 a parent in Toronto accused the book of being anti-Christian and anti-Islamic because the women are veiled and polygamy is allowed. Rushowy reports that &quot;The Canadian Library Association says there is &#x27;no known instance of a challenge to this novel in Canada&#x27; but says the book was called anti-Christian and pornographic by parents after being placed on a reading list for secondary students in Texas in the 1990s.&quot;
* A 2012 challenge as required reading for a Page High School International Baccalaureate class and as optional reading for Advanced Placement reading courses at Grimsley High School in Greensboro, North Carolina because the book is &quot;sexually explicit, violently graphic and morally corrupt&quot;. Some parents thought the book is &quot;detrimental to Christian values&quot;.
*In November 2012, two parents protested against the inclusion of the book on a required reading list in Guilford County, North Carolina. The parents presented the school board with a petition signed by 2,300 people, prompting a review of the book by the school&#x27;s media advisory committee. According to local news reports, one of the parents said &quot;she felt Christian students are bullied in society, in that they&#x27;re made to feel uncomfortable about their beliefs by non-believers. She said including books like &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; contributes to that discomfort, because of its negative view on religion and its anti-biblical attitudes toward sex.&quot;
*In November 2021 in Goddard, Kansas, &quot;The Goddard school district has removed more than two dozen books from circulation in the district&#x27;s school libraries, citing national attention and challenges to the books elsewhere.&quot;

In May 2022, Atwood announced that, in a joint project undertaken with Penguin Random House, an &quot;unburnable&quot; copy of the book would be produced and auctioned off, the project intended to &quot;stand as a powerful symbol against censorship&quot;. On 7 June 2022, the unique, &quot;unburnable&quot; copy was sold through Sotheby&#x27;s in New York for $130,000.

The book has been banned in school libraries in Florida, Missouri, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

==== In higher education ====
In institutions of higher education, professors have found &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; to be useful, largely because of its historical and religious basis and Atwood&#x27;s captivating delivery. The novel&#x27;s teaching points include: introducing politics and the social sciences to students in a more concrete way; demonstrating the importance of reading to our freedom, both intellectual and political; and acknowledging the &quot;most insidious and violent manifestations of power in Western history&quot; in a compelling manner.

The chapter entitled &quot;Historical Notes&quot; at the end of the novel also represents a warning to academics who run the risk of misreading and misunderstanding historical texts, pointing to the satirized Professor Pieixoto as an example of a male scholar who has taken over and overpowered Offred&#x27;s narrative with his own interpretation.

===Academic reception===

====Feminist analysis====
Much of the discussion about &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; has centred on its categorization as feminist literature. Atwood does not see the Republic of Gilead as a purely feminist dystopia, as not all men have greater rights than women. Instead, this society presents a typical dictatorship: &quot;shaped like a pyramid, with the powerful of both sexes at the apex, the men generally outranking the women at the same level; then descending levels of power and status with men and women in each, all the way down to the bottom, where the unmarried men must serve in the ranks before being awarded an Econowife&quot;.

Econowives are women expected to carry out child-bearing, domestic duties, and traditional companionship; they are married to men that don&#x27;t belong to the elite. When asked about whether her book was feminist, Atwood stated that the presence of women and what happens to them are important to the structure and theme of the book. This aisle of feminism, by default, would make a lot of books feminist. However, she is adamant in her stance that her book did not represent the brand of feminism that victimizes or strips women of moral choice.

Atwood has argued that while some of the observations that informed the content of &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; may be feminist, her novel is not meant to say &quot;one thing to one person&quot; or serve as a political message—instead, &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; is &quot;a study of power, and how it operates and how it deforms or shapes the people who are living within that kind of regime&quot;.

Some scholars have offered a feminist interpretation, connecting Atwood&#x27;s use of religious fundamentalism in the pages of &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; to a condemnation of its presence in current American society. Atwood goes on to describe her book as not a critique of religion, but a critique of the &quot;use&quot; of religion as a &quot;front for tyranny&quot;. Others have argued that &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; critiques typical notions of feminism, as Atwood&#x27;s novel appears to subvert the traditional &quot;women helping women&quot; ideals of the movement and turns toward the possibility of &quot;the matriarchal network ... and a new form of misogyny: women&#x27;s hatred of women&quot;.

Scholars have analyzed and made connections to patriarchal oppression in &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; and oppression of women today. Aisha Matthews tackles the effects of institutional structures that oppress woman and womanhood and connects those to the themes present in &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;. She first asserts that structures and social frameworks, such as the patriarchy and societal role of traditional Christian values, are inherently detrimental to the liberation of womanhood. She then makes the connection to the relationship between Offred, Serena Joy, and the Commander, explaining that through this &quot;perversion of traditional marriage, the Biblical story of Rachel, Jacob, and Bilhah is taken too literally&quot;. Their relationship and other similar relationships in &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; mirror the effects of patriarchal standards of womanliness.

;Sex and occupation
In the world of &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, the sexes are strictly divided. Gilead&#x27;s society values white women&#x27;s reproductive commodities over those of other ethnicities. Women are categorized &quot;hierarchically according to class status and reproductive capacity&quot; as well as &quot;metonymically colour-coded according to their function and their labour&quot;. The Commander expresses his personal opinion that women are considered inferior to men, as the men are in a position where they have power to control society.

Women are segregated by clothing, as are men. With rare exceptions, men wear military or paramilitary uniforms. All classes of men and women are defined by the colours they wear, drawing on colour symbolism and psychology. All lower-status individuals are regulated by this dress code. All &quot;non-persons&quot; are banished to the &quot;Colonies&quot;. Sterile, unmarried women are considered to be non-persons. Both men and women sent there wear grey dresses.

The women, particularly the Handmaids, are stripped of their individual identities as they lack formal names, taking on their assigned Commander&#x27;s first name in most cases.

;Unwomen
Sterile women, the unmarried, some widows, feminists, lesbians, nuns, and politically dissident women: all women who are incapable of social integration within the Republic&#x27;s strict gender divisions. Gilead exiles Unwomen to &quot;the Colonies&quot;, areas both of agricultural production and deadly pollution. Joining them are Handmaids who fail to bear a child after three two-year assignments.

;Jezebels
Jezebels are women who are forced to become prostitutes and entertainers. They are available only to the Commanders and to their guests. Offred portrays Jezebels as attractive and educated; they may be unsuitable as Handmaids due to temperament. They have been sterilized, a surgery that is forbidden to other women. They operate in unofficial but state-sanctioned brothels, unknown to most women.

Jezebels, whose title comes from Jezebel in the Bible, dress in the remnants of sexualized costumes from &quot;the time before&quot;, such as cheerleaders&#x27; costumes, school uniforms, and Playboy Bunny costumes. Jezebels can wear make-up, drink alcohol and socialize with men, but are tightly controlled by the Aunts. When they pass their sexual prime or their looks fade, they are discarded without any precision as to whether they are killed or sent to the Colonies.

====Philosophical analysis====
Many elements of Gilead recall details from Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;. Gilead&#x27;s social hierarchy of commanders, guardians, Marthas and handmaids, for example, has similarities to Plato&#x27;s social hierarchy of philosopher-guardians, auxiliary-guardians and producers. Both societies are also home to a state-based eugenics program, and see gymnasiums used as educational spaces in which women are socialized into new gender roles. The powers that be in Gilead legitimize their rule through the extensive use of propaganda, much as Plato&#x27;s rulers ensure co-operation on the part of the public by propagating a noble lie.

According to philosopher Andy Lamey, rather than straightforward allusions, the similarities to Plato are combined with features that differ, at times dramatically, from Plato&#x27;s original. As Lamey writes, &quot;the result is that Atwood&#x27;s dystopia deliberately calls to mind a distorted version of Platonism, one that differs in ways large and small from the original.&quot; In the case of gymnasiums, for example, in Plato they see women socialized into roles that make them the equal of men, while in Gilead they are where handmaids are first taught their duties.

Vernon Provençal has suggested that the novel is a satire of Platonism. Lamey, however, argues that this interpretation cannot explain why the book contains distorted references to philosophies beyond Platonism. Two such references are evident in mottos that handmaids are forced to repeat during their training. &quot;Pen is envy&quot; is a corrupt rendering of Freud&#x27;s notion of penis envy, while &quot;From each according to her ability; to each according to his needs&quot; is a garbled version of Marx&#x27;s slogan &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.&quot; Lamey argues that such allusions, rather than satirizing the philosophies in question, see Gilead employ a practice frequently used by actual dictatorships, that of seeking to bolster their prestige and legitimacy by twisting ideas already in circulation to suit their own ends.

====Race analysis====
African Americans, the main non-White ethnic group in this society, are called the Children of Ham. A state TV broadcast mentions they have been relocated &quot;en masse&quot; to &quot;National Homelands&quot; in North Dakota, which are suggestive of the apartheid-era homelands (Bantustans) set up by South Africa or forced death marches. Ana Cottle characterized &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; as &quot;White feminism&quot;, noting that Atwood does away with Black people in a few lines by relocating the &quot;Children of Ham&quot; while borrowing heavily from the African-American experience and applying it to White women, specifically Gilead&#x27;s explicit anti-literacy laws, which was borrowed from real life anti-literacy campaigns in the United States, alongside the removal of surnames among handmaids, an ode to how enslaved Africans were not given last names until Emancipation.

It is implied that a total genocide has been committed against Native Americans living in territories under the rule of Gilead. Jews were given a choice between converting to the state religion or being &quot;repatriated&quot; to Israel. Converts who were subsequently discovered with any symbolic representations or artifacts of Judaism were executed, and the repatriation scheme was privatized, with the result that many Jews died en route to Israel.

<text>Daniel Mayer Cherkoss (August 12, 1927 – March 27, 2006), known by his pen name Dan Curtis, was an American television and film director, screenwriter, and producer. He was best known as the creator of the gothic soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; (1966–71), and for directing the epic World War II miniseries &quot;The Winds of War&quot; (1983) and &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; (1988).

He also directed three feature films – the &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; spinoffs &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot; (1970) and &quot;Night of Dark Shadows&quot; (1971), and the supernatural horror &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot; (1976).

Curtis was nominated for five Primetime Emmy Awards, winning Outstanding Limited Series for &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;, for which he also won the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Dramatic Specials.

Curtis&#x27;s series of macabre films include &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot;, &quot;Night of Dark Shadows&quot;, &quot;The Night Stalker&quot; (for many years holding the record ratings of the most-watched TV movie—and inspired the series &quot;&quot;), &quot;Intruders&quot;, &quot;The Night Strangler&quot;, &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot;, &quot;Trilogy of Terror&quot; and its belated sequel &quot;Trilogy of Terror II&quot;, &quot;The Norliss Tapes&quot; (a 1973 pilot for an unproduced series starring Roy Thinnes), &quot;Curse of the Black Widow&quot;, &quot;Dead of Night&quot;, and &quot;Scream of the Wolf&quot;. He worked frequently with sci-fi/horror writers Richard Matheson and William F. Nolan. Curtis was producer and/or director of several television adaptations of classic horror texts including &quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1968), &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1973), &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (1973), &quot;Dracula&quot; (1974), and &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; (1974).

In 1978, Curtis made a departure from his usual macabre offerings, when he wrote, produced, and directed the sentimental NBC television film &quot;When Every Day Was the Fourth of July&quot;. Although fictionalized, the film was semi-autobiographical, based on his childhood growing up in Bridgeport, Connecticut, in the 1930s. The film was originally intended to be a pilot for a potential series, but when the series was not picked up by the NBC network, Curtis produced and directed the 1980 television movie sequel &quot;The Long Days of Summer&quot;, this time airing on the ABC network.

His 1983 miniseries &quot;The Winds of War&quot;, the most watched miniseries in American television history, was nominated for four Emmy Awards.

Curtis also directed the &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; miniseries, which was the continuation of &quot;The Winds of War&quot;. The program was 30 hours in length, split into two segments. Chapters I-VII aired in November 1988. The remaining five parts, Chapters VIII-XII, were billed as &quot;The Final Chapter&quot;, and aired in May 1989. The miniseries received 15 Emmy Award nominations, including for best actor (John Gielgud), actress (Jane Seymour), supporting actor (Barry Bostwick), and supporting actress (Polly Bergen). The show won Emmys for best miniseries, special effects, and single-camera production editing.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; profiled Curtis while in post-production on &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;.

Curtis&#x27;s rights to &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; remain with his estate, which signed a deal with Warner Bros. for a new &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; movie. The film stars Johnny Depp as Barnabas Collins, was directed by Tim Burton, and was released in May 2012. After the film&#x27;s end credits, there is a dedication to Dan Curtis.

In 2023, he was inducted into the Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Awards&#x27; Monster Kid Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Born Daniel Cherkoss in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Curtis attended Syracuse University before becoming a syndicated television show salesman.

Curtis died on March 27, 2006, at his home in Brentwood, Los Angeles, California, twenty days after the death of his wife Norma.
He was survived by two daughters.

<doc id="165046" wikidata="Q1166225" url="?curid=165046" title="Dark Shadows">
<text>Dark Shadows is an American gothic soap opera that aired weekdays on the ABC television network from June 27, 1966, to April 2, 1971. The show depicted the lives, loves, trials, and tribulations of the wealthy Collins family of Collinsport, Maine, where a number of supernatural occurrences take place.

The series became popular when vampire Barnabas Collins (Jonathan Frid) was introduced ten months into its run. It would also feature ghosts, werewolves, zombies, man-made monsters, witches, warlocks, time travel, and a parallel universe. A small company of actors each played many roles; as actors came and went, some characters were played by more than one actor. The show was distinguished by its melodramatic performances, atmospheric interiors, numerous dramatic plot twists, broad cosmos of characters, and heroic adventures. Unusual among the soap operas of its time, which were aimed primarily at adults, &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; developed a large teenage audience and a dedicated cult following. By 1969, it had become ABC&#x27;s highest-rated daytime series.

The original network run of the show amassed 1,225 episodes. The success of the series spawned a media franchise that has included two feature films (&quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot; in 1970 and &quot;Night of Dark Shadows&quot; in 1971), a 1991 TV remake, an unsprouted 2004 remake pilot, a 2012 film reboot directed by Tim Burton, and numerous spin-off novels and comics. Since 2006, the series has continued as a range of audio dramas produced by Big Finish Productions, featuring members of the original cast including David Selby, Lara Parker, and Kathryn Leigh Scott.

&quot;TV Guide&quot;″s list of all-time Top Cult Shows ranked the series #19 in 2004, and #23 in 2007.

==History==
Creator Dan Curtis claimed he had a dream in 1965 of a mysterious young woman on a train. The following day Curtis told his wife of the dream and pitched the idea as a TV series to ABC. Network officials greenlit production and Curtis began hiring crew members.

Art Wallace was hired to create a story from Curtis&#x27;s dream sequence. Wallace wrote the story bible &quot;Shadows on the Wall&quot;, the proposed title for the show, later changed to &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. Robert Costello was added as a line producer, and Curtis took on the creator and executive producer roles. Lela Swift, John Sedwick, and Henry Kaplan all agreed to be directors for the new series. Robert Cobert created the musical score and Sy Tomashoff designed the set.

===Broadcast history===
Perhaps one of ABC&#x27;s first truly popular daytime series, along with the game show &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; (which had moved from its original home NBC in 1968), &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; found its demographic niche in teenagers coming home from school in time to watch the show at 4 p.m. Eastern/3 p.m. Central, where it aired for almost all of its network run, the exception being a 15-month stretch between April 1967 and July 1968, when it aired a half-hour earlier. Originally, it was aired in black-and-white, but the show went into color starting with the episode broadcast on August 11, 1967. It became one of ABC&#x27;s first daytime shows to win the rating for its timeslot, leading to the demise of NBC&#x27;s original &quot;Match Game&quot; and Art Linkletter&#x27;s long-running &quot;House Party&quot; on CBS, both in 1969.

&quot;Dark Shadows&quot; began with a 4.1 rating in the 1965–66 TV season, tying for thirteenth place out of eighteen daytime dramas. The audience figures only improved slightly, to 4.3, in 1966–67. 1966 was a volatile year for soaps, and many ended their runs between the premiere date of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; in June and the month of December. By that time, six months had passed, and &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; had failed to gain major traction. In June, it ranked #13 out of 18 soaps, and by December, the lower-rated offerings were gone and the show officially ranked #13 out of 13 soaps. &quot;The show was limping along, really limping&quot;, head writer Sam Hall remembered, &quot;and ABC said, &#x27;We&#x27;re canceling it. Unless you pick up in 26 weeks, you&#x27;re finished.&#x27; [Series creator Dan Curtis] had always wanted to do a vampire picture, so he decided to bring a vampire — Barnabas Collins — to the series.&quot;
Barnabas was introduced in April 1967 and the fan response was swift and immediate. Coupled with a time slot change to 3:30 Eastern/2:30 Central, the fortunes of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; rebounded, as many more teenagers found the program after tuning out the other offerings that may have been too &quot;boring&quot; to them. By May 1968, the series was still in last place (out of 12 offerings), but rose to a 7.3 rating, the rough equivalent (at that time) of gaining the viewership of three million households in the span of one year. &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; would return to its 4 p.m. Eastern/3 p.m. Central time slot in July 1968, without losing much of its audience at all. &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, which was launched by ABC in July 1968 in the 3:30 slot, also sought to reach the newfound young demographic.

The series reached its peak in popularity during a storyline set in the year 1897, broadcast from March 1969. By the end of May, &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; was ABC&#x27;s most popular soap opera, and by late 1969 it was reaching between 7 and 9 million viewers on any given day, and ranking 11th out of a total 15 daytime dramas in that time period.

In November 1969, after nine months of some of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;″ most intricate, intelligent storylines, the 1897 storyline came to an end. With ratings at an all-time high, the writers were under pressure to hold the audience. Their next storyline, known as &quot;The Leviathans&quot;, proved to be a thematic misstep for the show and one from which it never recovered. Fans tended to dislike the portrayal of Barnabas as the pawn of some greater power. They were more interested in the archetypes of classic horror—the vampire, the witch, the werewolf—than in off-camera suggestion. The launch of &quot;Somerset&quot; in March 1970, a much-publicized spin-off of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Another World&quot;, also hurt the series considerably.

The release of the film &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot; in September of that year is also thought to have caused TV ratings to fall, possibly due to parents, attending the film with their children, discouraging their choice of television viewing material due to the amount of blood spilled on screen. Beginning in the fall of 1970, several ABC stations across the country dropped the show due to falling viewership. Within six months, ratings dropped from 7.3 to 5.3., though the ratings improved in its final weeks. The series was canceled on April 2, 1971, and replaced the following Monday with a new version of the game show &quot;Password&quot;. The last minute of the final episode included a voiceover by actor Thayer David wrapping up many of the plotlines on the show.

The original cast reunited in 2003 for a special reunion play recorded for MPI, and in 2006 resumed production of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; audio dramas for Big Finish (see below). These dramas have been ongoing for 10 seasons.

==Production==
===Casting===

Curtis set out to find the actress to play the girl on the train. Alexandra Isles (then Alexandra Moltke), a young actress with little experience, was discovered and cast in the role of Victoria Winters, an orphan who journeys to the mysterious, fictional town of Collinsport, Maine, to unravel the mysteries of her past.

Veteran film star Joan Bennett was soon cast as Victoria&#x27;s employer Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, a woman who had not left her home in over eighteen years. Stage actor Louis Edmonds was cast as Elizabeth&#x27;s brother, a widower, Roger Collins. Another stage actress, Nancy Barrett, was then cast as Elizabeth&#x27;s headstrong daughter Carolyn Stoddard, and child actor David Henesy was cast as Roger&#x27;s troubled son David Collins.

As production on the series continued, many new and mysterious characters, played by unfamiliar actors and actresses, were introduced, but two early cast changes brought stage actors David Ford and Thayer David into the ensemble. Thayer David would go on to play several formidable villains over the course of the series. Michael Currie, as Constable Jonas Carter, was shortly replaced by veteran actor Dana Elcar, as Sheriff George Patterson. Most of the actors played multiple characters, and those characters often returned through flashbacks, the use of parallel timelines, or as ghosts.

====Main cast====
Character names noted with * indicates appearance of a counterpart in an alternate reality known as &quot;Parallel Time&quot; during episodes 969 to 1060 or 1186 to 1245.

===Locations===
Both theatrical films, &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot; (1970) and &quot;Night of Dark Shadows&quot; (1971), were shot primarily on location at the Lyndhurst estate in Tarrytown, New York. For the TV series, Essex, Connecticut was the locale used for the town of Collinsport. Among the locations sited there are the Collinsport Wharf, Main Street, and the Evans Cottage. The Griswold Inn in Essex was used for the Collinsport Inn, and the town post office was used for the Collinsport Police Station. The Collinwood stand-in mansion used for the TV series is the Carey Mansion in Newport, Rhode Island, until August 2009 used by Salve Regina University. The exteriors for the &quot;Old House,&quot; aka Collins House (the original Collinwood mansion) were filmed at Spratt Mansion, which was also located on the Lyndhurst estate; this mansion was destroyed by fire in 1969. The Lockwood-Mathews Mansion in South Norwalk, Connecticut, was also used for some scenes in &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot;. Some outdoors shots for the series were filmed in the famous Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, not far from the Lyndhurst Mansion.

All of the interiors of the TV series were shot on sound stages at various ABC-owned studios in Manhattan. The early episodes were shot at ABC Studio TV-2 at 24 West 67th Street, and the rest of the episodes were shot at the smaller ABC Studio TV-16 at 433 West 53rd Street, now demolished; as of 2022, it is the site of a six-story, 60-unit apartment building.

===Special effects===
Working within the constraints of the live-to-tape format—with almost every scene done in one take—&quot;Dark Shadows&quot; displayed an unusually inventive use of costume, make-up, and in particular, special effects. Both time travel and ghosts allowed characters killed in earlier sequences to return, often in period clothing. Séances held in the old mansion were often visited by ghostly apparitions of quivering ectoplasm. Dream sequences included colorful psychedelic spectacles superimposed over ethereal, fog-filled fantasies. Individuals of normal appearance were transformed into hideous creatures of the netherworld. One episode was carefully edited so that a closeup of a clock on the set showed the exact time viewers in the Central time zone saw the clock.

===Music===
Of particular note is Robert Cobert&#x27;s music score, which broke new ground for a television program. In September 1969, the original soundtrack to &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, credited to the Robert Cobert Orchestra and featuring 16 tracks written or co-written by Cobert, reached no. 18 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top 200 album chart. The song &quot;Quentin&#x27;s Theme&quot; earned Cobert a Grammy nomination for Best Instrumental Theme, but lost to John Barry&#x27;s theme for &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;. A recording of &quot;Quentin&#x27;s Theme&quot; by the Charles Randolph Grean Sounde was released as a single, and in August 1969, when the TV series was something of a phenomenon, it peaked at no. 13 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 chart, no. 3 on its Easy Listening chart, and no. 5 for 3 weeks in Canada.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Dark Shadows&quot; had a rocky beginning. Critics were quick to deem the series boring for its heavy use of unknown actress Isles and the slow pace. &quot;Variety&quot;, in its review on June 29, 1966, of the first episode of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;: &quot;Writer Art Wallace took so much time getting into his story that the first episode of the Neo Gothic soaper added up to one big contemporary yawn.&quot; The earliest episodes concerned menacing but unfulfilled conflicts, threatened revenge, then an attempted murder, and, finally, a murder. The supernatural elements that later made the show a hit, were slow to appear and only hinted at until episodes 52 and 70 in which the audience finally sees compelling evidence of a ghost.

==Media==
===Home media===
Unlike some other soap operas of its era, the episodes of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; all were preserved in some format, although one episode exists only as an audio recording and several color episodes only have black and white kinescopes available.

MPI Home Video currently holds the home media rights to the series. All episodes were issued on VHS from 1989 through 1995. Episodes 210–1245 (Barnabas&#x27; arrival through to the end of the series) have been released on DVD in 26 &quot;Collections&quot; from 2002 through 2006. Episodes 1–209 were released in 2007 under the title of &quot;Dark Shadows: The Beginning&quot;. On April 3, 2012, MPI re-released the 32 &quot;Collections&quot;. The first (and sometimes, the second) collection (from Barnabas&#x27;s introduction) has been released internationally, but due to generally low sales, this has been the extent of the international release of the series.

On April 10, 2012, MPI released a &quot;Limited Edition Complete Series&quot; box set in the shape of a coffin. The 131 DVDs are housed in 22 individual plastic cases, with the spines looking upward to show the entire body of Barnabas lying asleep in his coffin. Only 2,500 numbered copies of these were made, with each set including a limited edition card signed by original series star Jonathan Frid. A similar but unlimited &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; set was subsequently released on July 10, 2012, without the limited edition card signed by Jonathan Frid and without the serial limitation number plate on the bottom of the box.

===Films===

MGM released a feature film titled &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot; in 1970. Dan Curtis directed it, and Sam Hall and Gordon Russell wrote the screenplay. Many cast members from the soap opera, including Jonathan Frid, Grayson Hall, Roger Davis, and Kathryn Leigh Scott, reprised their roles. 1971 saw the release of &quot;Night of Dark Shadows&quot;, also directed by Dan Curtis and written by Curtis and Sam Hall. Actors included David Selby, Grayson Hall, Kate Jackson, and Lara Parker, among others.

During the filming of &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot; in 1970, several actors were written out of the TV series so that they would be available to shoot the movie. Kathryn Leigh Scott was absent from 30 episodes (986 to 1015); Jonathan Frid was absent from 28 episodes (983 to 1010); Grayson Hall was absent from 21 episodes (986 to 1006); John Karlen was absent from 21 episodes (990 to 1010); Nancy Barrett was absent from 20 episodes (991 to 1010): Louis Edmonds was absent from 17 episodes (991 to 1008); Don Briscoe was absent from 15 episodes (986 to 1000); Joan Bennett was absent from 15 episodes (991 to 1006); and David Henesy was absent from 9 episodes (993 to 1001).

===Novels===
There have been two series of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; novels. The first, released during the show&#x27;s original run, were all penned by romance writer Marilyn Ross, a pseudonym for author Dan Ross, and were published by Paperback Library. Ross also wrote a novelization of the theatrical film &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot;.

The second series of novels were written by Lara Parker, Stephen Mark Rainey, and Elizabeth Massie.

===Other books===
===Magazines===
During its original run, &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; was featured in many magazines, including &quot;Afternoon TV&quot;, &quot;Castle of Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;Daytime TV&quot;, and &quot;Famous Monsters of Filmland&quot;. Even after the show ended, it received coverage in genre magazines of the 1970s, like &quot;Monsters of the Movies&quot;.

In 2003, a two-part article titled &quot;Collecting &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;: Return to Collinwood&quot;, written by Rod Labbe, appeared in &quot;Autograph Collector&quot; magazine; it was the first major article to chronicle the show in years. In 2005, &quot;Scary Monsters Magazine&quot; devoted an entire issue (#55) to &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. Included were full-length interviews with cast members Marie Wallace, David Selby, and Kathryn Leigh-Scott, as well as &quot;Don&#x27;t Open That Coffin! A Baby Boomer&#x27;s Adventures in the Land of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;!&quot; Both the &quot;Autograph Collector&quot; and &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; articles were penned by freelance writer Rod Labbe, who once ran a fan club for Dennis Patrick (Jason McGuire, Paul Stoddard) in 1969–70.

Labbe also contributes to &quot;Fangoria&quot; magazine and is currently doing a series of full-length interviews with surviving original cast members, leading up to the release of Burton&#x27;s film. Labbe&#x27;s interview with Jerry Lacy, who played the nefarious Reverend Trask, appeared in issue #296. His second, with Kathryn Leigh-Scott, was in issue #304. The latest, a Chris Pennock (Jeb Hawkes, a.k.a. &quot;The Leviathan&quot;) profile, is scheduled to run in issue #310. He has already interviewed Marie Wallace (Eve and Jenny Collins) for a future issue, with more to come. A lengthier version of Kathryn&#x27;s interview can be found on her website.

===Comics===

From March 14, 1971, to March 11, 1972, the Newspaper Enterprise Association syndicated a &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; comic strip by illustrator Kenneth Bruce Bald (credited as &quot;K. Bruce&quot; because of contractual obligations) to dozens of newspapers across the United States. In 1996, Pomegranate Press, Ltd. published &quot;Dark Shadows: The Comic Strip Book&quot; (), which collected the entire 52-week run of the daily and Sunday strip.

Gold Key Comics released 35 issues of a regular &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; comic book, mostly written by John Warner, which ran for years after the cancellation of the series on ABC (1969–1976); and in 1991, Innovation Publishing released a short-lived comic book series based on the NBC-TV revival show. Hermes Press has released a five-volume archive reprint series of the Gold Key series in 2010–2011. Additionally, Dynamite Entertainment launched a new monthly series of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; comic books in October 2011.

===Other media===
There have also been two board games, a few coloring books, two jigsaw puzzles, and a View-Master reel.

===Syndication===
Due to an FCC rule prohibiting networks from keeping their syndication holdings, it wasn&#x27;t until 1975 that the ABC-spun Worldvision Enterprises released 130 episodes to syndication. Eventually, all but the pre-Barnabas and approximately the last year&#x27;s episodes were part of the package. During the 1980s, PBS was heavily involved in rebroadcasting the series. In 1992, the cable network the Sci-Fi Channel (now Syfy) acquired the entire run of episodes. The channel stopped airing &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; in 2003.

Online streaming site Netflix carried the series previous to 2012, but then dropped all but 160 episodes. The series was completely removed in early 2014. In June 2012, episodes 210-249 of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, covering the introduction of Barnabas Collins, were made available for streaming online video on Hulu, then a free service like YouTube. In October 2013, 200 episodes were offered on Hulu Plus, the new Hulu subscription service. As of April 2015, the non-subscription part of the service was discontinued and some of it was merged into the subscription side, dropping the Hulu Plus title and going by simply Hulu. After several years, the series was removed as of the summer of 2020.

Both the original soap opera and prime-time versions have aired on the Decades TV Network. Decades was known for its Halloween marathons of the show throughout the late 2010s that the network called The Binge. In 2018, 260 episodes of the program started airing at 12AM ET/11PM Central on weeknights. The MPI Media Group, who has the rights to the show&#x27;s distribution, started a pay streaming service dedicated specifically to the program in October 2017. In January 2018, Amazon Prime was the first streaming service to carry every episode at once. However, in late 2019 it moved to the site&#x27;s IMDb TV Channel accompanied by commercials. The free ad-supported Tubi TV acquired rights to all 1,225 episodes in January 2020 and in September, the similar Pluto TV added a &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; channel.

===Audio drama===

Based on a 2003 stage play performed at a &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; convention, &quot;Return to Collinwood&quot; is an audio drama written by Jamison Selby and Jim Pierson, and starring David Selby, Kathryn Leigh Scott, John Karlen, Nancy Barrett, Lara Parker, Roger Davis, Marie Wallace, Christopher Pennock, Donna Wandrey, James Storm, and Terry Crawford. The show is available on CD.

====Big Finish Productions====
In 2006, Big Finish Productions continued the &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; saga with an original series of audio dramas, starring the original cast. The first season featured David Selby (Quentin Collins), Lara Parker (Angelique), Kathryn Leigh Scott (Maggie Evans), and John Karlen (Willie Loomis). Robert Rodan, who played Adam in the original series, also appears in the fourth story, playing a new character. Barnabas Collins is played by Andrew Collins. A second series was released in 2010. In addition to the cast&#x27;s returning from Series One, &quot;Kingdom of the Dead&quot; also featured Lysette Anthony, Alec Newman, Lizzie Hopley, Jerry Lacy, and David Warner.
Big Finish has also produced a series of dramatic story readings based on the series, with arguably the most notable being the 2010 release &quot;The Night Whispers&quot;, in which Jonathan Frid reprised the role of Barnabas.

In January 2015, Big Finish began releasing the full-cast &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; serial &quot;Bloodlust&quot; in twice-weekly installments, as to emulate the initial soap opera format of the show.

==Revivals==

===1991 TV series===

In 1991, MGM Television produced a short-lived prime-time remake that aired on NBC from January 13 to March 22. The revival was a lavish, big-budget, weekly serial combining Gothic romance and stylistic horror. Although it was a huge hit at its introduction (watched by almost 1 in 4 households, according to official ratings during that time period), the onset of the Gulf War caused NBC to continually preempt or reschedule the episodes, resulting in declining ratings. It was canceled after the first season. The final episode ended with a cliffhanger: Victoria Winters (Joanna Going)&#x27;s learning that Barnabas Collins (Ben Cross) was a 200-year-old vampire.

It also starred veterans Jean Simmons (as Elizabeth Collins Stoddard) and Roy Thinnes (as Roger Collins), British character actress Lysette Anthony (as Angelique Collins), Barbara Steele (as Julia Hoffman), and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (as David Collins).

===2004 TV pilot===

Plans for another revival series (or film) have been discussed off and on since the 1991 series&#x27; demise, including a TV miniseries to wrap up the plotlines of the canceled NBC series and a feature film, co-written by Dan Curtis and Barbara Steele, utilizing the 1991 cast. In 2004, a pilot for a new WB network &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; series, starring Marley Shelton as Victoria Winters and Alec Newman as Barnabas Collins, was written and shot, but never picked up. The pilot has been screened at the &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; Festival conventions with Dan Curtis Productions&#x27; blessing, and it can now be found online. This pilot was produced by Warner Bros. Television.

===2012 film===
In 2012, Warner Bros. produced a film adaptation of the soap opera. Tim Burton directed the film, and Johnny Depp, finally realizing one of his childhood fantasies, starred as Barnabas Collins. However, the film treated the stories comedically, and was not the hoped-for major success.

===&quot;Reincarnation&quot;===
In September 2019, it was announced that The CW and Warner Bros. Television were developing a continuation of the original series called &quot;Dark Shadows: Reincarnation&quot;, written by Mark B. Perry. Perry would also serve as executive producer along with Amasia Entertainment&#x27;s Michael Helfant, Bradley Gallo and Tracy Mercer, as well as Tracy and Cathy Curtis. Perry said, &quot;As a first-generation fan, it&#x27;s been a dream of mine to give &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; the &quot;Star Trek&quot; treatment since way back in the &#x27;80s when &quot;Next Generation&quot; was announced, so I&#x27;m beyond thrilled and humbled to be entrusted with this resurrection.&quot; In November 2020, &quot;TVLine&quot; reported that the series was no longer in development. In August 2021, Perry revealed that the project was retooled with the intention to shop it to networks again.

<doc id="165047" wikidata="Q466244" url="?curid=165047" title="Gale Storm">
<text>Josephine Owaissa Cottle (April 5, 1922 – June 27, 2009), known professionally as Gale Storm, was an American actress and singer. After a film career from 1940 to 1952, she starred in two popular television programs of the 1950s, &quot;My Little Margie&quot; and &quot;The Gale Storm Show&quot;. Six of her songs were top ten hits. Storm&#x27;s greatest recording success was a cover version of &quot;I Hear You Knockin&#x27;,&quot; which hit No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in 1955.

==Early life==
Storm was born in Bloomington, Texas, United States. The youngest of five children, she had two brothers and two sisters. Her father, William Walter Cottle, died after a year-long illness when she was only 17 months old, and her mother, Minnie Corina Cottle, struggled to raise the children alone. 

Storm attended Holy Rosary School in what is now Midtown, Houston. She performed in the drama club at both Albert Sidney Johnston Junior High School and San Jacinto High School. 

When Storm was 17, two of her teachers urged her to enter a contest on &quot;Gateway to Hollywood&quot;, broadcast from the CBS Radio studios in Hollywood. First prize was a one-year contract with a movie studio, which she won, and was immediately given the stage name Gale Storm. Her performing partner (and future husband), Lee Bonnell from South Bend, Indiana, became known as Terry Belmont.

==Career==

Storm had a role in the radio version of &quot;Big Town&quot;. After winning the contest in 1940, Storm made several films for the RKO Radio Pictures studio. Her first was &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot;, playing opposite Jimmy Lydon and Freddie Bartholomew. She worked steadily in low-budget films released during this period. In 1941, she sang in several soundies, three-minute musicals produced for &quot;movie jukeboxes&quot;.

She acted and sang in Monogram Pictures&#x27; Frankie Darro series, and played ingénue roles in other Monogram features with the East Side Kids, Edgar Kennedy, and the Three Stooges, most notably in the film &quot;Swing Parade of 1946&quot;. Monogram had always relied on established actors with reputations, but in Gale Storm, the studio finally had a star of its own. She played the lead in the studio&#x27;s most elaborate productions, both musical and dramatic. She shared top billing in Monogram&#x27;s &quot;The Crime Smasher&quot; (1943), opposite Edgar Kennedy, Richard Cromwell, and Frank Graham in the role of Jones, a character derived from network radio.

Storm starred in a number of films, including the romantic comedies &quot;G.I. Honeymoon&quot; (1945) and &quot;It Happened on Fifth Avenue&quot; (1947), the Western &quot;Stampede&quot; (1949), and the 1950 film-noir dramas &quot;The Underworld Story&quot; and &quot;Between Midnight and Dawn&quot;. U.S. audiences warmed to Storm and her fan mail increased. She performed in more than three dozen motion pictures for Monogram, experience which made possible her success in other media.

In the 1950s, she made singing appearances on such television variety programs as &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom.&quot;

In 1950, Storm made her television debut in &quot;Hollywood Premiere Theatre&quot; on ABC. From 1952 to 1955, she starred in &quot;My Little Margie&quot;, with former silent film actor Charles Farrell as her father. The series began as a summer replacement for &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; on CBS Television, but ran for 126 episodes on NBC and then CBS. The series was broadcast on CBS Radio from December 1952 to August 1955 with the same actors. Her popularity was capitalized on when she served as hostess of the &quot;NBC Comedy Hour&quot; in the winter of 1956. 

In 1956, Storm starred in a situation comedy, &quot;The Gale Storm Show&quot; (&quot;Oh! Susanna&quot;), featuring another silent movie star, ZaSu Pitts. The show ran for 143 episodes on CBS and ABC between 1956 and 1960. Storm appeared regularly on other television programs in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1957 she was both a panelist and a &quot;mystery guest&quot; on CBS&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;

==Recording artist==

In Gallatin, Tennessee, in November 1954, a 10-year-old girl, Linda Wood, was watching Storm on a Sunday night television variety show, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;, hosted by Gordon MacRae, singing one of the popular songs of the day. Linda&#x27;s father asked her who was singing and was told it was Gale Storm from &quot;My Little Margie&quot;. Linda&#x27;s father Randy Wood was president of Dot Records, and he liked Storm so much that he called to sign her before the end of the television show. Her first record, &quot;I Hear You Knockin&#x27;&quot;, a cover of a rhythm and blues hit by Smiley Lewis, sold over a million copies.

The follow-up was a two-sided hit, with Storm covering Dean Martin&#x27;s &quot;Memories Are Made of This&quot; backed with her cover of Gloria Mann&#x27;s &quot;Teen Age Prayer&quot;. That was followed by a hit cover of Frankie Lymon&#x27;s &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;. Storm&#x27;s subsequent record sales began to slide, but soon rebounded with a cover of fellow Dot Records recording artist Bonnie Guitar&#x27;s haunting ballad &quot;Dark Moon&quot; that went to No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Storm had several other hits, headlined in Las Vegas and appeared in numerous stage plays. Storm recorded for five years with Dot Records, then gave up recording because of her husband&#x27;s concerns with the time she had to devote to that career.

==Personal life==
Storm was married and widowed twice. In 1941, while still a teenager, she married Lee Bonnell (1918–1986), then an actor and later a businessman. They had four children: Peter, Phillip, Paul, and Susanna. In 1988, two years after she was widowed, she married Paul Masterson (1917–1996), who also predeceased her.

In her fifties, Storm struggled with alcoholism. She later said:
Storm later became an active member of the South Shores Baptist Church. She once said: &quot;Life has been good and I thank God for His many blessings and the happy life He has given to me.&quot; Storm was a registered Republican and campaigned for U.S. Senator Barry M. Goldwater in the 1960s.

==Later years==
Storm appeared on two episodes of &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law,&quot; 1964 and 1965. Storm made occasional television appearances from 1979 to 1989, such as &quot;The Love Boat&quot; and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;.

In 1981, she published her autobiography, &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Down Yet&quot;, which described her battle with alcoholism. She was also interviewed by author David C. Tucker for &quot;The Women Who Made Television Funny: Ten Stars of 1950s Sitcoms&quot;, published in 2007 by McFarland and Company.

Storm continued to make personal appearances and autographed photos at fan conventions, along with Charles Farrell from the &quot;My Little Margie&quot; series. She also attended events such as the Memphis Film Festival, Cinecon, the Friends of Old-Time Radio and the Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention.

==Death==
After the death of her second husband in 1996, Storm lived alone in Monarch Beach, California, near two of her sons and their families, until failing health forced her into a convalescent home in Danville, California. She died there on June 27, 2009, aged 87.

Storm has three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to television, recordings, and radio.

<doc id="165050" wikidata="Q824262" url="?curid=165050" title="New Jersey Route 71">
<text>Route 71 is a state highway in New Jersey that runs near the shore in Monmouth County. It begins at Route 35 in Brielle just north of the Manasquan River and the Ocean County line and heads north to Route 35 in Eatontown with a four block concurrency with Route 35 in Belmar. Monmouth University is located off Route 71 in West Long Branch.

Route 71 is the former alignment of State Highway Route 4 and Route 35. In 1927, the alignment became the designation of State Highway Route 4-N. This alignment remained intact until the state highway renumbering in 1953, when it became Route 71. The route has remained virtually unchanged since. Route 71 was also to serve as the eastern terminus of Route 33 in Neptune, but this never came to be.

==Route description==

Route 71 begins at large grade-separated interchange with Route 35 in the community of Brielle. The route heads northward through Brielle as Union Avenue, passing through the commercial district and residential after the intersection of Union Lane. Route 71 continues northward through Brielle as a two-lane highway before beginning a parallel with NJ Transit&#x27;s North Jersey Coast Line. After entering Manasquan, the highway enters a large commercial district and crosses over the Stockton Brook before curving onto 7th Avenue. After the intersection of Sea Girt Avenue (CR 49), Route 71 enters Sea Girt. The route continues north through Sea Girt until the intersection of 8th Avenue (CR 20), where it briefly enters Wall Township. There, the route crosses over the North Branch of the Wreck Pond and enters Spring Lake Heights. Route 71 quickly passes the Spring Lake Golf Club and the nearby Spring Lake Train Station before entering the downtown area of Spring Lake Heights.
Most of Spring Lake Heights is residential, with a large condominium complex surrounding the southbound direction on Route 71. The highway continues northward, intersecting with Allaire Road (CR 524) and passes Marucci Park. Route 71 intersects with 18th Avenue (CR 30), where the highway enters Belmar. After crossing the intersection of 16th Avenue (CR 18), Route 71 enters the downtown area of Belmar, intersecting with River Road (Route 35). There, Route 35/Route 71 runs concurrently through Belmar, passing the local Belmar Train Station. At the intersection of 8th Avenue, Route 71 turns off to the east while Route 35 continues north on River Road and crosses parallel to Route 35 over the Shark River and enters Avon-by-the-Sea, becoming Main Street. There, the two routes continue to parallel, with Route 71 becoming a divided one-way street through Avon-by-the-Sea. The route continues northward through the residential seashore community, crossing the Sylvan Creek and entering Bradley Beach. Through Bradley Beach, Route 71 intersects with Brinley Avenue (CR 2), which serves access to the Bradley Beach Train Station. The highway continues northward through the residential district, and enters Neptune. There, Route 71 intersects with the eastern terminus of the cross-state Route at Corlies Avenue before entering the large city of Asbury Park.
Through Asbury Park, Route 71 intersects with several local streets at traffic lights as Main Street. The route intersects with Asbury Avenue (CR 16). After crossing through Sunset Park, Route 71 approaches Deal Lake, where the highway turns to the east along Deal Lake Drive. Route 71&#x27;s right-of-way on Main Street becomes CR 15 and Route 71 continues through the lakeshore community as a two-lane arterial. Soon after, Route 71 turns north on Park Avenue, crosses over Deal Lake and enters Loch Arbour. However, the highway heads northward into Allenhurst soon after. Route 71, now known as Norwood Avenue, crosses out of Allenhurst after an intersection of Cedar Avenue, entering Deal. Before the intersection of Roseld Avenue, the highway becomes a divided one with a center median. The route continues this way through the residential portions of Deal, crossing into the Ocean Township-Deal border. There, the route comes back together, crossing over the North Jersey Coast Line once again near the Elberon Train Station. Route 71 continues along the Ocean Township–Long Branch border until entering the West Long Branch-Long Branch border near Whale Pond Brook. At that point, Route 71 serves as the main road to access Monmouth University. At the intersection of Cedar Avenue, Norwood Avenue ends, and Route 71 northbound turns westward along Cedar Avenue, fully entering West Long Branch. The route crosses through Monmouth University and enters the residential area of West Long Branch, intersecting with Locust Avenue/Monmouth Road (CR 15) and Wall Street (CR 32) within a mile of each other. At the intersection of Locust Avenue/Monmouth Road (CR 15), Route 71 turns to the northwest through a residential area.
Route 71 parallels the Glenwood Cemetery before intersecting with Route 36. Here, Route 71 continues northwestward on Monmouth Road through large commercial complexes and the local country club. The highway continues northward, bordering Eatontown to the southwest and Oceanport, where it enters a local residential area and intersects with Eatontown Boulevard (CR 547), which become concurrent. Route 71 and CR 547 fully enter Eatontown as Broad Street, heading westward as CR 547 splits from Route 71 by turning southwest on Wyckoff Road. The highway continues into the commercial district of Eatontown, where it intersects with Main Street (Route 35) once again but Route 71 terminates.

==History==
From Long Branch to Deal Lake, the road was maintained as part of the Long Branch and Deal Turnpike, which also stretched north along Norwood Avenue and Branchport Avenue. Route 71 originates as part of the Jersey Coast Way, an auto trail running from the Staten Island Ferry to Cape May. This was later an alignment of State Highway Route 4 in the 1920s, which ran from Absecon in Atlantic County northward to Rahway in Union County. Route 4 remained intact through the 1927 state highway renumbering, when Route 4 was realigned onto the current alignment of Route 35 most of its length. The older alignment from Belmar to Eatontown was re-designated as State Highway Route 4 N by the New Jersey State Highway Department. Route 4-N was one of four routes that used the -N suffix from the original numbering. Route 35 was designated on the southern portion, but this got reversed, allowing the designation to be extended to Brielle. The highway department originally planned for maintenance of this section to revert to local maintenance, but years of campaigning by locals prompted the highway department to restore the state highway in 1931. The route remained intact for the next 22 years, until the second state highway renumbering in 1953. Route 35 remained on its basic alignment, but State Highway Route 4-N was renumbered to Route 71. Route 71 has remained virtually unchanged since the 1953 renumbering in terms of its alignment from Brielle to Eatontown. During the time of the proposed Route 33 Freeway from Trenton to Neptune, the intersection with Route 33 in Neptune was to be upgraded to a grade-separated interchange, but this portion was never built after being canned in 1967.

<text>Route 72 is a state highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It runs from the Four Mile Circle with Route 70 in Woodland Township in Burlington County to Long Beach Boulevard (CR 607) in Ship Bottom on Long Beach Island in Ocean County. Route 72 travels through the Pine Barrens as a two-lane undivided road. After an interchange with the Garden State Parkway, the route becomes a four- to six-lane divided highway through built-up areas of Manhawkin and crosses the Manahawkin Bay via the Manahawkin Bay Bridge onto Long Beach Island.

What is now Route 72 was originally designated as Route S40 in 1927, a spur of Route 40 (now Route 70) running from Four Mile to Manahawkin. The road was extended to Ship Bottom by 1941 before it was renumbered to Route 72 in 1953. A realignment that took place in 1969 between US 9 and the Manahawkin Bay Bridge resulted in the designation of Route 180 on the former alignment; this road is now CR 50. Plans in the late 1960s and the 1970s called for a proposed Route 72 freeway, running from the western terminus at Route 70 to the concurrently proposed I-895 at the New Jersey Turnpike in Westampton, connecting Philadelphia&#x27;s northern suburbs with the Jersey Shore. The freeway plans along with I-895 were canceled by the 1980s. The Manahawkin Bay Bridge underwent deck repairs completed in May 2010, with the bridge slated to be rehabilitated and a parallel span to be built to the south.

==Route description==

Route 72 begins at the Four Mile Circle intersection of Route 70, Magnolia Road (CR 644), and Four Mile Road (CR 646) in Woodland Township, Burlington County, heading to the southeast on a two-lane undivided road. The route passes through heavily wooded areas of the Pine Barrens that are a part of the Brendan T. Byrne State Forest. The road passes near a state hospital before coming to an intersection with the northern terminus of CR 563. Past CR 563, the route continues through the Pine Barrens, passing under an abandoned railroad line prior to the intersection of Chatsworth-Barnegat Road (CR 532). Here, Route 72 forms a concurrency with CR 532 and the road enters Barnegat in Ocean County, where it comes to the intersection of Whiting Road (CR 539). From this intersection, Route 72 and CR 532 continue to the intersection of Warren Grove Road (CR 610), where CR 532 splits from the route by heading to the east on Warren Grove Road. A short distance later, the route intersects with West Bay Avenue (CR 554), which continues along Route 72, and turns to the south-southeast through more wooded areas.
The highway enters Stafford Township and passes to the southwest of the residential Ocean Acres community. The route heads to the southwest of Hackensack Meridian Health Southern Ocean Medical Center before it comes to the intersection of Nautilus Drive (CR 111). Past this intersection, Route 72 widens into a four-lane divided highway, intersecting with Lighthouse Drive (CR 105) and Stafford Park Boulevard (CR 2) before coming to an interchange with the Garden State Parkway. Following this interchange, the route enters the Manahawkin area and widens to six lanes as it passes woods to the northeast and business areas to the southwest. Route 72 has an interchange with US 9 and continues southeast through a mix of woods and commercial areas as a four-lane road, with Bay Avenue (CR 50) paralleling the route to the north. The road intersects with Jennings Road (CR 20) and Mill Creek Road (CR 6) before it passes to the north of the Beach Haven West residential development and passes near wetlands. A road provides access to Bay Avenue before Route 72 crosses the Manahawkin Bay on the Manahawkin Bay Bridge, also known as the Dorland J. Henderson Memorial Bridge. After traversing two small islands consisting of a mix of residences and marshland, the road continues into Ship Bottom on Long Beach Island. Upon entering Ship Bottom, the route splits into a one-way pair following West 9th Street eastbound and West 8th Street westbound. Route 72 passes by resort businesses, intersecting with Barnegat Avenue (CR 4) and Central Avenue (CR 89) before ending at the intersection of Long Beach Boulevard (CR 607) a block from the Atlantic Ocean.

Route 72 is a major route providing access to Long Beach Island, a popular Jersey Shore resort, from Philadelphia via Route 70 and from New York City via the Garden State Parkway. As such, the portion of the route east of the Garden State Parkway interchange sees congestion during the summer months. It is also the only road bridge to connect Long Beach Island to the mainland; therefore, in emergency evacuations such as hurricanes, the highway and Manahawkin Bridge becomes clogged.

==History==

What is now Route 72 was originally designated as Route S40 in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering. It was to be a spur of Route 40 that was to run from Route 40 at Four Mile to Route 4 (now US 9) in Manahawkin. By 1941, the route was extended east to the intersection with Long Beach Boulevard in Ship Bottom. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route S40 was renumbered to Route 72. By 1969, Route 72 was moved to a new alignment to the south between US 9 and the Manahawkin Bay Bridge; the old alignment became Route 180. This route was eventually removed from the state highway system and is now CR 50, although more commonly known as &quot;Bay Avenue&quot;.

A freeway was originally proposed for the Route 72 corridor in the late 1960s. The Route 72 freeway was planned to run from the Four Mile Circle to the New Jersey Turnpike in Westampton, where it would connect to the proposed I-895 that would continue to I-95 near Bristol, Pennsylvania. The existing Route 72 would also be widened into a four-lane divided highway. Both I-895 and Route 72 were intended to connect Bucks County, Pennsylvania and the Willingboro area with the Jersey Shore. The proposed freeway for Route 72 was to cost $39 million. However, construction costs and the desire to use money for mass transit led to cancellation of both I-895 and the Route 72 freeway by the 1980s.

In 2000, the Manahawkin Bay Bridge was dedicated the Dorland J. Henderson Memorial Bridge in honor of Dorland J. Henderson, who was one of NJDOT’s top engineers that designed the lighting system for the Manahawkin Bay Bridge. In September 2009, the NJDOT began repairs to the deck of the Manahawkin Bay Bridge. This project, completed in May 2010, cost $4 million and received funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Manahawkin Bay Bridge underwent a rehabilitation project and a parallel bridge was built to the south. Construction began on the project May 3, 2013. The new bridge was completed in 2016 and carried traffic from both directions while the older bridge was rehabilitated. The rehabilitation of the original bridge was completed in 2019, at which point traffic began using both bridges.

<doc id="165057" wikidata="Q824475" url="?curid=165057" title="New Jersey Route 73">
<text>Route 73 is a state highway in the southern part of the U.S. state of New Jersey. It runs as an outer bypass of the Camden area from an intersection with U.S. Route 322 (US 322) in Folsom, Atlantic County, north to the Tacony–Palmyra Bridge in Palmyra, Burlington County, where the road continues into Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as Pennsylvania Route 73 (PA 73). South of the interchange with the Atlantic City Expressway in Winslow Township, Camden County, Route 73 is a two-lane undivided county-maintained road and is signed as County Route 561 Spur (CR 561 Spur), a spur of CR 561. North of the Atlantic City Expressway, the route is maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation and is mostly four lanes, with the portion north of the CR 561 concurrency a divided highway. North of the US 30 interchange near Berlin, Route 73 runs through suburban areas of the Delaware Valley metropolitan area, intersecting Route 70 in Marlton, the New Jersey Turnpike and Interstate 295 (I-295) in Mount Laurel Township, Route 38 and Route 41 in Maple Shade Township, Route 90 in Cinnaminson Township, and US 130 in Pennsauken Township.

What is today Route 73 between the Tacony–Palmyra Bridge and Berlin was legislated as Route S41 in 1927, a spur of Route 41. An extension of this spur called Route S41A was designated in 1938 to continue south from Berlin to Route 42 (now US 322) in Folsom. In 1953, both these routes became Route 73 in order to match PA 73. The portion of Route 73 between Berlin and the Atlantic City Expressway became a state highway by 1969. By the 2000s, Route 73 was extended south along CR 561 Spur to US 322. Several traffic circles along Route 73 have been modified or replaced over time. Among these was the Berlin Circle, which was turned into an at-grade intersection in 2006. The Marlton Circle at Route 70, which was modified in 1974 to allow Route 73 to pass through the circle, was replaced with an interchange completed in 2011.

==Route description==
===US 322 to Atlantic City Expressway===
Route 73 begins at an intersection with US 322 (Black Horse Pike) in Folsom, Atlantic County, heading to the northwest on Blue Anchor Road, a two-lane undivided county-maintained road signed as CR 561 Spur. This portion of the route is officially considered a part of Route 73 but is not signed as such, with signs directing motorists north on CR 561 Spur to reach Route 73. The road runs through forested areas of the Pine Barrens with some homes and farms, coming to a crossroads with Route 54. Following this intersection, the road continues northwest as Mays Landing Road, crossing the Beesleys Point Secondary railroad line operated by the Cape May Seashore Lines railroad at-grade. It enters a small corner of Hammonton before it heads into Winslow Township in Camden County. Here, Route 73 crosses the Southern Railroad of New Jersey&#x27;s Southern Running Track railroad line at-grade and intersects CR 725. From this point, the road heads north to a partial interchange with the Atlantic City Expressway that has access from southbound Route 73 to the eastbound Atlantic City Expressway and from the westbound Atlantic City Expressway to northbound Route 73.

===Atlantic City Expressway to Route 70===

After the Atlantic City Expressway, Route 73 becomes officially signed and maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation, although CR 561 Spur is still signed along the route. It heads to the north as a four-lane undivided road, passing through wooded areas with some residences and businesses and crosses CR 723, which provides access to the westbound Atlantic City Expressway and from the eastbound Atlantic City Expressway. The route continues to an intersection with CR 561, where it briefly widens into a four-lane divided highway. At this junction, CR 561 Spur ends and Route 73 forms a concurrency with CR 561. The road intersects CR 722 and CR 721, becoming Camden Road at the latter junction. It heads north through more rural areas, meeting CR 720. CR 561C, a former segment of CR 561, splits from Route 73 by heading north through the community of Cedar Brook while Route 73 and CR 561 bypass the community to the east, crossing under Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; (CSAO) Beesleys Point Secondary railroad line.

North of Cedar Brook, the route traverses CR 536, becoming Cedarbrook Road. It intersects CR 680 and CR 711 before widening into a divided highway prior to a junction where CR 712 heads northeast and CR 561 splits from Route 73 by heading north on Cedarbrook Road. Past this intersection, Route 73 becomes an unnamed road and encounters CR 710 at a four-way intersection. A short distance later, the route enters Waterford Township and comes to a modified cloverleaf interchange with US 30 (White Horse Pike) and CR 536 Spur.
Following US 30, Route 73 passes through a small corner of Berlin Boro before it goes under NJ Transit&#x27;s Atlantic City Line west of the Atco station. At the railroad underpass, the route enters Berlin Township and meets CR 534 at a crossroad. After the intersection with this route, the road proceeds back into Berlin Boro, where the route runs through a mix of residences and businesses. Route 73 widens to a six-lane highway and comes to the former Berlin Circle, where it meets both CR 689 and CR 708. From here, the road turns north and reenters Berlin Township as a four-lane divided highway, continuing through developed areas and intersecting CR 692. Prior to the junction with CR 693, the route enters Voorhees Township, where it encounters CR 675 before passing east of Virtua Voorhees Hospital.

At the intersection with CR 671, Route 73 comes into Evesham Township, Burlington County. In Evesham, it heads to a junction with CR 544 before coming to Marlton, where it passes west of The Promenade at Sagemore shopping center and Virtua Marlton Hospital before turning northwest at CR 607. The route intersects CR 600 and CR 620 before meeting Route 70 at a partial cloverleaf interchange that was formerly the Marlton Circle.

===Route 70 to Tacony–Palmyra Bridge===
Past the Route 70 interchange, Route 73 continues through suburban commercial areas, crossing the unsigned CR 674, and heading into Mount Laurel Township. The route comes to an intersection with CR 616, where it turns to the northwest. A short distance later, the road has a double trumpet interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike. Following this interchange, Route 73 widens into a six-lane divided highway and encounters CR 673 before coming to a cloverleaf interchange with I-295. From the I-295 interchange, the route goes into Maple Shade Township. Route 73 comes to two exits for Route 38 and Route 41 within a short distance of each other. After Route 41, the road intersects CR 610 and bypasses the center of Maple Shade to the east as a four-lane divided highway. The route has an interchange with CR 537 and runs under CSAO&#x27;s Pemberton Industrial Track railroad line before turning northwest and paralleling the North Branch of the Pennsauken Creek, meeting CR 609.

Route 73 enters Cinnaminson Township, where the Route 90 freeway splits from the road before crossing over the South Branch of the Pennsauken Creek into Pennsauken Township, Camden County. In Pennsauken, the route has exits with CR 644 and US 130. Route 73 briefly enters Cinnaminson Township, Burlington County, again before crossing into Palmyra at the bridge over the Pennsauken Creek. In Palmyra, the road has an interchange with CR 543 before running under NJ Transit&#x27;s River Line. The route comes to the intersection with Temple Boulevard, where it becomes maintained by the Burlington County Bridge Commission and comes to the northbound toll plaza for the Tacony–Palmyra Bridge. A short distance later, the road traverses the Delaware River on the Tacony–Palmyra Bridge, a combination steel tied-arch bridge and drawbridge with two northbound lanes and one southbound lane, where it continues into Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as PA 73. The Tacony–Palmyra Bridge was designed by Ralph Modjeski, who also engineered the Ben Franklin Bridge and the Manhattan Bridge, that opened to traffic in 1929, replacing a ferry service across the Delaware River.

Route 73 serves as a main road in South Jersey that helps provide access between the Philadelphia area and the southern part of the Jersey Shore as well as connections to several local roads. It has been rated one of the worst roads in the state in terms of traffic, accidents, and driver aggression.

==History==
In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, a spur of Route 41 called Route S41 was legislated to run from the Tacony–Palmyra Bridge south to Berlin along what is today Route 73. A southern extension of Route S41 called Route S41A was proposed to run from Berlin south to Route 42 (now US 322) in Folsom in 1938. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route S41 and Route S41A were renumbered to Route 73 in order to match PA 73. With the establishment of the 500-series county routes in 1952, the current alignment of Route 73 between Berlin and Blue Anchor became a part of CR 561 while it became CR 561 Spur between Blue Anchor and Folsom. By 1969, Route 73 was designated south of Berlin along CR 561 and CR 561 Spur to the Atlantic City Expressway. By the 2000s, Route 73 was extended south along with CR 561 Spur from the Atlantic City Expressway to US 322.

Over the years, several traffic circles have been modified or replaced along Route 73. The Marlton Circle at Route 70 in Marlton was modified in 1974 to allow Route 73 to run directly straight through the circle. This circle became known for traffic backups and was replaced with an interchange. Construction on this interchange, which cost $31 million, began in April 2009. In May 2010, the circle was eliminated with a temporary at-grade intersection constructed while the Route 73 bridge over Route 70 was being built. The interchange was completed in June 2011. A traffic circle that existed at the intersection of Route 38 and Route 41 in Maple Shade Township was removed by the 1960s and replaced by the current set of interchanges. In addition, the Berlin Circle in Berlin was replaced by an at-grade intersection between August 2005 and September 2006 at a cost of $73 million.

<doc id="165059" wikidata="Q1062893" url="?curid=165059" title="Sacramental character">
<text>Some Christian denominations believe that a sacramental character, an indelible spiritual &quot;mark&quot; (the meaning of the word &quot;character&quot; in Latin), is imprinted by any of three of the seven sacraments: baptism, confirmation, and holy orders.

== History ==
The doctrine was expressed by Augustine of Hippo in his religious controversies. The doctrine of the sacramental character was dogmatically defined by the Catholic Church at the 16th century Council of Trent.

==Teaching by Christian denomination==
===Catholicism===
This teaching is expressed as follows in the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; (1992):

If it is doubtful whether a person has received the sacrament, the sacrament may be administered conditionally (using words such as for conditional baptism: &quot;If thou art not baptized, I baptize thee in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&quot;). However, such an administration is only valid and effective to the extent that no valid administration of the same sacrament has already occurred, as it does not in any event constitute an effective repetition of a valid previous administration of that sacrament.

The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;, explains as follows the significance of the image of &quot;seal&quot;, used as an alternative to that of &quot;character&quot;:

===Lutheranism===
Lutheran theologian Wolfhart Pannenberg stated that &quot;in terms of the thought of promise and sending that constantly govern the ordained and claim them for Christ&#x27;s service, we no longer need to oppose [indelible character] on the Lutheran side, since this point of view finds expression in the Lutheran churches, too. Here there is no repetition of ordination&quot;.

===US Episcopal Church===
The Book of Common Prayer of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America teaches that &quot;The bond which God establishes in Baptism is indissoluble&quot;.

=== Eastern Orthodoxy ===
In Eastern Orthodoxy, opinion on this concept vary. 

Rodopoulos discusses the theory of what he calls the &quot;ineradicable nature of priesthood&quot;, which is the theory that &quot;ordination is ineradicable, and should a defrocked priest be restored, his ordination is not repeated&quot;. Rodopoulos states that &quot;[t]he [Eastern] Orthodox Church has not declared officially on this matter. The Church of Rome established this doctrine at the Council of Trent (1545 – 1563)&quot;. Rodopoulos adds: &quot;Only some [Eastern] Orthodox theologians, influenced by Roman Catholic teachings, have accepted this theory. The long-standing practice of the Church, however, as well as its teaching on grace, reject the theory of the ineradicable nature of the priesthood. Priest who are defrocked return to the ranks of the laity or monks&quot;.

Calivas believes that &quot;[t]he character of ordination is indelible&quot;. 

Scouteris considers that &quot;no evidence concerning the indelible mark theory can be found in Patristic teaching. On the contrary, the canonical data leave no doubt that a defrocked priest or bishop, after the decision of the Church to take back his priesthood, returns to the rank of the laity. The anathematized or the defrocked are in no way considered to maintain their priesthood&quot;.

<doc id="165060" wikidata="Q2515419" url="?curid=165060" title="Constitution of the Irish Free State">
<text>The Constitution of the Irish Free State () was adopted by Act of Dáil Éireann sitting as a constituent assembly on 25 October 1922. In accordance with Article 83 of the Constitution, the Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922 of the British Parliament, which came into effect upon receiving the royal assent on 5 December 1922, provided that the Constitution would come into effect upon the issue of a Royal Proclamation, which was done on 6 December 1922. In 1937 the Constitution of the Irish Free State was replaced by the modern Constitution of Ireland following a referendum.

As enacted, the Constitution of the Irish Free State was firmly shaped by the requirements of the Anglo-Irish Treaty that had been negotiated between the British government and Irish leaders in 1921. However, following a change of government in 1932 and the adoption of the Statute of Westminster a series of amendments progressively removed many of the provisions that had been required by the Treaty.

The Constitution established a parliamentary system of government under a form of constitutional monarchy, and contained guarantees of certain fundamental rights. It was intended that the constitution would be a rigid document that, after an initial period, could be amended only by referendum. However, amendments were made to the Constitution&#x27;s amendment procedure, so that all amendments could be and were in fact made by a simple Act of the Oireachtas (parliament).

==Background and enactment==
===Debate on whether a written constitution was required===

Whether or not the Irish Free State would have a written constitution was the subject of some debate when the Irish Free State (Saorstát Éireann) Bill was introduced to the Provisional Parliament by President Cosgrave. The Labour leader, Thomas Johnson, remarked:

Another reason put forward not to adopt a written constitution was that constitutional conventions between members of the British Commonwealth were evolving and there was likely to be an Imperial Conference on the matter before long. The Labour leader also objected to the manner in which the Provisional Parliament was being described as a &quot;constituent assembly&quot; when in fact it was not acting of its &quot;free volition&quot; and thereby at liberty to adopt a constitution. He compared it to re-establishing Poynings&#x27; Law.

Nonetheless, there were counter arguments in favour of adopting a written constitution. Irish nationalists who fought the War of Independence believed themselves to be fighting on behalf of a newly formed state called the Irish Republic. The Irish Republic had its own president, an elected assembly called Dáil Éireann, and a judicial system in the form of the Dáil Courts. This republic was recognised by the revolutionary government in Russia. In the negotiations leading to the Anglo-Irish Treaty the British government insisted that the new Irish state must remain within the Commonwealth and not be a republic. Furthermore, while the Irish Republic had a constitution, of sorts, in the form of the Dáil Constitution, this was a very brief document and had been intended to be only provisional. It was therefore the prevalent view that when, in 1921, the British government agreed to the creation of a largely independent Irish state, that a new constitution was needed. The Anglo-Irish Treaty made a number of requirements of the new constitution. Among these were that:

* the new state would be called the Irish Free State and would be a dominion of the British Commonwealth;
* the King would be the head of state and would be represented by a Governor General;
* members of the Oireachtas (parliament) would swear an oath of allegiance to the Irish Free State and declare their fidelity to the King. This Free State Oath of Allegiance was controversial; and
* Northern Ireland would be included in the Irish Free State unless its Parliament decided to &quot;opt out&quot; (which it did).

===Legislative competence===

On 31 March 1922, an act of the United Kingdom Parliament called the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922 was passed. It gave the force of law to the Anglo-Irish Treaty. It also provided by for the election of a body to be called the &quot;House of the Parliament&quot;, sometimes called the &quot;Provisional Parliament&quot;, to which the Provisional Government established under that act would be responsible. The act gave no power to the Provisional Parliament to enact a constitution for the Irish Free State. In due course, &quot;the House of the Parliament,&quot; provided for by that act, was elected and met on 9 September 1922, and calling itself Dáil Éireann, proceeded to sit as a constituent assembly for the settlement of what became the Constitution of the Irish Free State.

===Constitution Committee===
Shortly after the British evacuated their troops from Dublin Castle in January 1922, Michael Collins set about establishing a committee to draft a new constitution for the nascent Irish Free State which would come into being in December 1922. Mr Collins chaired the first meeting of that committee and at that point (he died before the constitution was finalised) was its chairman. Darrell Figgis, the vice-chairman became acting chair. The committee produced three draft texts, designated A, B and C. A was signed by Figgis, James McNeill and John O&#x27;Byrne. B was signed by James G. Douglas, C.J. France and Hugh Kennedy and it differed substantially from A only in proposals regarding the Executive. This difference was intended by Douglas to permit the anti-treaty faction a say in the final proposed constitution before its submission to the British Government. As such it was, according to Douglas, an attempt to ameliorate the pro- and anti-treaty split. Draft C was the most novel of the three. It was signed by Alfred O&#x27;Rahilly and James Murnaghan, and provided for the possibility of representation for the people of the northern counties in the Dáil in the event of that area opting out of the proposed free state. The Irish text was then drafted as a translation of the English text. The Irish language version was drafted by a committee which included the Minister for Education, Eoin MacNeill; the Leas-Cheann Comhairle (deputy speaker), Pádraic Ó Máille; the Clerk of the Dáil, Colm Ó Murchadha; Piaras Béaslaí; Liam Ó Rinn and Professors Osborn Bergin and T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly.

===Method of adoption===
As a practical matter, the process of drafting the constitution began with the establishment by Michael Collins of the committee to draft a new constitution. This started shortly after the Provisional Government was established in January 1922. In subsequent months members of the Provisional Government negotiated the draft constitution with the British authorities. After that process was completed, a bill entitled the &quot;Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Éireann) Bill&quot; was introduced into Dáil Éireann (the Third Dáil) in September 1922, the Dáil sitting as a &quot;constituent assembly&quot;. It was enacted by the Third Dáil on 25 October 1922.

Article 83 of the constitution provided that &quot;The passing and adoption of this Constitution by the Constituent Assembly and the British Parliament shall be announced as soon as may be, and not later than the sixth day of December, Nineteen hundred and twenty-two, by Proclamation of His Majesty, and this Constitution shall come into operation on the issue of such Proclamation.&quot;

The British Parliament then passed the Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922, which came into force on 5 December 1922. This act recited that the House of Parliament constituted pursuant to the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act, 1922, sitting as a constituent assembly for the settlement of the Constitution of the Irish Free State, had passed the measure set forth in the schedule to the act, (namely the constitution adopted by Dáil Éireann), which it then referred to as &quot;the Constituent Act&quot;. It then provided that the Constituent Act should be the Constitution of the Irish Free State and should come into operation on the same being proclaimed by His Majesty in accordance with Article 83 of the constitution.

The Royal Proclamation bringing the constitution into force was made on 6 December 1922. Referring to the constitution as a &quot;Measure&quot; whereby the constitution appearing as the First Schedule to the Constituent Act was declared to be the Constitution of the Irish Free State, the Royal Proclamation went on to &quot;announce and proclaim that the Constitution of the Irish Free State as the same was passed and adopted by the said Constituent Assembly has been passed and adopted by Parliament&quot;. The 6 December 1922 was the latest possible date allowed for by the Anglo-Irish Treaty for the continued authority of the Provisional Government set up by the treaty pending &quot;the constitution of a Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State&quot;. On this date also the members of the Dáil took the Oath of Allegiance, and nominated the members of the Executive Council (the cabinet).

===Incorporation of the treaty===

The &quot;Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Éireann) Act 1922&quot; contained two schedules. One schedule contained the new constitution, and the other the text of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. As enacted in 1922, Section 2 of the act provided for the supremacy of the treaty&#x27;s provisions, voiding any part of the Constitution or other Free State law that was &quot;repugnant&quot; to it. Similarly, both Section 2 of the act and Article 50 of the constitution provided that no constitutional amendment would stand so far as it violated the terms of the treaty.

The enactment by the British Parliament of the Statute of Westminster in 1931 changed the legal framework as understood by the British. The statute was designed to increase the legislative autonomy of all the dominions. In contrast with certain of the other dominions, the statute did not specifically place any reservation on this power as exercisable by the Free State, and thus granted it the power to alter Irish law in any way it chose. The new government under Éamon de Valera soon used this new freedom to enact the &quot;Constitution (Removal of Oath) Act 1933&quot;. Besides abolishing the Oath of Allegiance, a requirement of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the act also expressly repealed the provisions both of the constitution proper and of the &quot;Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Éireann) Act 1922&quot; that required compliance with the treaty. Subsequent legislation soon began to dismantle other constitutional provisions that had been required or limited by the treaty&#x27;s terms.

===Constitution&#x27;s authority===

Under British constitutional legal theory, the &quot;Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Éireann) Act 1922&quot; held the force of law because of the enactment of the United Kingdom&#x27;s &quot;Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922&quot;. However, under Irish law the constitution &quot;derived its authority not from the Act of the imperial parliament passed on the 5th December, 1922, or from the proclamation made on the 6th December, 1922, but from the Act of Dáil Éireann sitting as a constituent assembly passed on the 25th October, 1922&quot;.

==Main provisions==

===Structure===

As enacted, the Constitution proper consisted of 83 separate articles, totalling around 7,600 words. The &quot;Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Éireann) Act 1922&quot; consisted of only a short preamble and three short sections, but was a far longer document because, as noted above, it included as schedules the full text of both the constitution proper and the Anglo-Irish Treaty.

The articles of the Constitution proper were not grouped together under headings, save for the final ten articles (which came under the title of &quot;Transitory Provisions&quot;). However, divided by subject matter the articles of the Constitution broke down roughly as follows:

* Introductory provisions (Arts. 1–4)
* Fundamental rights (Arts. 5–10)
* Legislature (Arts. 13–46)
** Dáil Éireann (Arts. 26–29)
** The Senate (Arts. 30–34)
* Initiative and referendum (Arts. 47–48)
* Constitutional amendments (Art. 50)
* Cabinet (Arts. 51–59)
* Governor-General (Art. 60)
* Regulation of state finances (Arts. 61–63)
* Courts (Arts. 64–72)
* Transitory Provisions (Arts. 73–83)
===Preamble===

The constitution itself had no preamble. However, the &quot;Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Éireann) Act 1922&quot; began with the following words:

===Characteristics of the state===

* Commonwealth membership: Article 1 stated that the state would be a &quot;co-equal member&quot; of the British Commonwealth.
* Popular sovereignty: It was stated that the &quot;all powers of government... are derived from the people of Ireland&quot; (Article 2).
* Citizenship: The constitution provided that those living in the state at the time of its coming into force who had been born in Ireland, had parents born in Ireland or had been resident in the state for seven years would become citizens. However anyone who was the citizen of another state could choose not to become an Irish citizen (Article 3).
* National language: It was provided that Irish was the &quot;National Language&quot; but English was &quot;equally recognised as an official language&quot; (Article 4). The constitution included the terms &quot;Saorstát Éireann&quot; (as one name for the Irish Free State), &quot;Oireachtas&quot; (for the legislature), and &quot;Dáil Éireann&quot; and &quot;Seanad Éireann&quot; (for the houses of the legislature), all of which were intended for use even in English speech.

===Individual rights===

Unlike the then constitutions of Australia and Canada, the constitution included a bill of rights, in Articles 6–10. Rights were also protected by a number of provisions contained in other articles.

* Prohibition of titles of nobility: It was provided that no title of honour, including knighthoods and peerages, could be conferred on an Irish citizen in respect of any services rendered in or in relation to the Irish Free State without the consent of the Executive Council (Article 5).
* Liberty and &quot;habeas corpus&quot;: Article 6 provided that no-one could be deprived of liberty except in accordance with the law, and that &quot;habeas corpus&quot; would be upheld. The military forces were granted an exemption from this article during time of war or rebellion.
* Inviolability of the home: The home could not be entered except in accordance with the law (Article 7).
* Freedom of conscience and worship: Protected by Article 9 subject to &quot;public order and morality&quot; (Article 8).
* Prohibition of establishment: The state could not &quot;endow&quot; any religion (Article 8).
* Religious discrimination: The state could not discriminate on religious grounds (Article 8).
* Freedom of speech, assembly and association: All guaranteed subject to &quot;public morality&quot;. Laws regulating freedom of assembly and association could not be discriminatory (Article 9).
* Right to education: Free elementary education guaranteed to all citizens (Article 10).
* Trial by jury: Guaranteed by Article 72, which granted an exemption for minor offences and offences triable by court martial.

The constitution empowered the courts to strike down laws they found to be unconstitutional. However judicial review of legislation was made largely meaningless by the ease with which the Oireachtas could alter the constitution. Furthermore, as the state had only recently seceded from the UK, Irish judges were trained in British jurisprudence. To this tradition, founded on deference to the legislature and parliamentary sovereignty, constitutional review was an alien concept. This meant that despite the adoption of a new, more rigid constitution in 1937, constitutional review did not become a significant feature of Irish jurisprudence until the 1960s. During the entire period of the Free State, only two pieces of legislation were declared by the courts to be unconstitutional.

The Free State had significant problems with public order in early years. It was founded during the Irish Civil War which did not come to an end until May 1923, and thereafter there were continuing problems of public disorder and subversive activities by the Irish Republican Army (IRA). This situation led to an erosion of civil rights in the new state. During the Civil War a law provided the death penalty for the crime of unlawful possession of a firearm, and more than seventy people were executed for the offence. Strong security measures continued to be used after the war&#x27;s conclusion; these included internment of former rebels and the punishment of flogging for arson and armed robbery, introduced in 1924.

In 1931, acting in response to IRA violence, the Oireachtas adopted Amendment No. 17 of the constitution. This added a sweeping set of provisions called Article 2A to the constitution. Article 2A was very large, consisting of five parts and 34 sections. Among other provisions it granted powers of arrest, detention and trial of people before military tribunals not bound by normal rules of evidence, despite the fact that many crimes triable before the tribunals carried a mandatory death sentence. To protect itself from being undermined by the courts, Article 2A was drafted to state that it took precedence over all other provisions of the constitution (save Article 1).

The provisions for military tribunals were challenged in 1935 in the case of The State (Ryan) v. Lennon. In this case the majority of the Supreme Court reluctantly held that, because Amendment No. 17 had been duly adopted in accordance with the correct procedure, it was not open to the judges to strike it down. However Chief Justice Kennedy disagreed, arguing, in a dissenting opinion, that the Article 2A violated natural law.

=== Economic and social rights ===
The drafting committee considered the inclusion of economic and social rights in the Irish constitution. C.J. France proposed provisions to ensure state control of natural resources. He further proposed that the state would capture the &quot;unearned increment&quot; arising from land value increases, thereby checking speculation in land and promoting investment in industrial development. During the parliamentary debates on the constitution, Labour TDs such as Tom Johnson and T.J. O’Connell proposed the inclusion of modest welfare measures as well as provisions to protect children&#x27;s rights.

These proposals met with opposition. The economist, George O’Brien, and Archbishop Harty both questioned the social provisions&#x27; economic viability as well as their political viability given their potential to alienate conservative, land-owning supporters of the Treaty. British law officers further objected to the &quot;Soviet character&quot; of the constitution&#x27;s declaration of &quot;economic sovereignty&quot;. The Provisional Government dropped the offending provisions.

Ultimately, the 1922 Constitution was limited to two &quot;programmatic declarations&quot; only, one specifying a pre-existing right to elementary education (Article 10) and the other providing for the possibility of state ownership of national resources (Article 11).

===Organs of government===

The constitution provided for a parliamentary system of government. The legislature was called the Oireachtas, consisting of the monarch and two houses: the Chamber of Deputies, to be known generally as Dáil Éireann, was established as the lower house, and the Senate, to be known generally as Seanad Éireann, as the upper house. The Seanad had only limited powers of delay so the Dáil was the dominant house.

Executive authority was vested in the King and exercised by the Governor-General of the Irish Free State, who would appoint an Executive Council to &quot;aid and advise&quot; him. The Executive Council was headed by a prime minister, the President of the Executive Council. In practice, however, the President was nominated by the Dáil and formally appointed by the Governor-General. The President then nominated the remaining members of the Executive Council. The Dáil was empowered to dismiss it by a vote of no confidence. With few exceptions, the Governor-General was required to act on the Executive Council&#x27;s advice.

The constitution provided that the judiciary would consist of the Supreme Court, the High Court, and any lower courts established by law.

===Initiative and referendum===

As originally adopted the constitution contained (in Articles 47, 48 and 50) innovative provisions for direct democracy but, owing to constitutional amendments, these provisions were never permitted to come into effect. The provisions stated that the referendum and initiative would operate on the same franchise as the Dáil; this was universal suffrage beginning at the age of 21. The constitution provided for three forms of direct democracy:

* Constitutional referendum: After an initial period all constitutional amendments would be subject to a mandatory, binding referendum. An amendment would not be deemed to have been passed unless at least a majority of registered voters participated in the referendum and the votes in favour were equal to either: (1) a majority &quot;of all eligible voters&quot;, or (2) a two-thirds majority of &quot;votes cast&quot;. This provision was stricter than the modern Constitution of Ireland, which merely requires a majority of votes cast.
* Veto of legislation: Once a bill had been approved by both houses of the Oireachtas (or just by the Dáil, if it had over-ridden the Senate) its enactment into law could be suspended if, within seven days, either a majority of the Senate or 40% of all members of the Dáil so requested. There would then be a further period of ninety days within which either 5% of all registered voters, or a 60% majority in the Senate, could demand a referendum on the bill. The referendum would be decided by a majority of votes cast. If rejected the bill would not become law. These provisions did not apply to money bills or bills declared by both houses to be &quot;necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety&quot;.
* Initiative: Ordinary citizens would have the right, through an initiative process, to draft both constitutional amendments and ordinary laws, and insist that they be submitted to a referendum. The constitution provided a general frame-work for how the initiative would work, empowering the Oireachtas to fill in the details with legislation. It required that a proposal could be initiated by a petition of 50,000 registered voters. Once initiated a proposal would be referred to the Oireachtas, but if the Oireachtas did not adopt the law it would be obliged to submit it to a binding referendum. The constitution gave the Oireachtas two years to adopt a law allowing voters to introduce initiatives. However, after this time voters had power to force the issue. This is because the initiative process itself could then by made the subject of an initiative. After two years the introduction of an initiative process would be put to a referendum if demanded by a petition of not less than 75,000 voters on the register (not more than fifteen thousand of whom could be voters in any one constituency).

The Achilles&#x27; heel of the direct democracy provisions was contained in Article 50 which provided that, for eight years after the constitution came into force, the Oireachtas could amend the constitution without a referendum. As interpreted by the courts, this even included the power to amend the article itself and extend this period.

The Oireachtas did not adopt legislation providing for the initiative within the two years stipulated by the constitution and, eventually, a petition of 96,000 signatures was gathered by the opposition to trigger a referendum forcing the Oireachtas to introduce an initiative process. The Oireachtas responded by removing all provisions for direct democracy from the constitution, save for the requirement that, once the eight-year transitional period had passed, it would be necessary to hold referendums on all constitutional amendments. Then in 1929 the Oireachtas extended this period to sixteen years. This meant that, by the time the constitution was replaced in 1937, the provisions for the constitutional referendum had still not come into force.

==Amendments==

===Method of amendment===

The procedure for adopting constitutional amendments was laid out in Article 50. This foresaw that amendments would first be approved by both houses of the Oireachtas, then submitted to a referendum, and finally receive the royal assent from the Governor-General. However, as already noted, the requirement for a referendum was postponed by the Oireachtas so that during the entire period of the Irish Free State the Constitution could be amended by means of an ordinary law. As noted above it was originally provided that any amendments that violated the Anglo-Irish Treaty would be inadmissible, but this sole restriction was removed in 1933.

The Oireachtas readily used its powers of amendment so that, during the 15 years of the Constitution&#x27;s operation, 25 formal constitutional amendments were made. This can be contrasted with the fact that, during its first 60 years, the current Constitution of Ireland was amended only 16 times. In addition to the adoption of constitutional amendments, the courts ruled that the Oireachtas could also implicitly amend the constitution. When the Oireachtas adopted the Public Safety Act 1927, which affected civil rights, it included a section requiring that should the act be found to be unconstitutional it would be treated as a constitutional amendment. Section 3 of the act provided that:

In the &quot;Attorney General v. McBride&quot; (1928) it was ruled that this kind of section was unnecessary because even if a law did not contain such a provision it could be interpreted as a tacit amendment of the constitution anyway, owing to the doctrine of implied repeal. This meant that, in addition to formal amendments, almost any act of the Oireachtas could be considered an amendment of the constitution. The long process of amendment that occurred until 1937 meant that, by the time it was replaced that, according to President (of the Executive Council) Éamon de Valera, the constitution had become a &quot;tattered and torn affair&quot;.

While Article 50 provided for the amendment of the constitution proper, there was no explicit provision in any law for the amendment of the &quot;Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Éireann) Act 1922&quot;. Some jurists therefore maintained that the Oireachtas did not have power to amend the Act; rather, if it were possible to alter the law at all, it might be necessary to request the British Parliament to do so, or to elect another constituent assembly. Chief Justice Kennedy was among those who took the view that the act could not be altered by the Oireachtas. Nonetheless, changes were eventually made to the act, when the Oireachtas passed the Constitution (Removal of Oath) Act 1933, and it was superseded with the adoption of the 1937 constitution. The 1922 Act was formally repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 2007.

When the new constitution was drafted lessons had been learned from the Free State constitution. It too granted the Oireachtas a temporary power to make constitutional amendments by ordinary law, but, unlike the Free State constitution, it expressly forbade the legislature from using this power to extend the transitional period. Article 46 of the new constitution required that constitutional amendments be approved by referendum while Article 51 of the Transitory Provisions suspended this requirement for an initial three years (beginning when the first president assumed office). However, Article 51 forbade the legislature from amending either itself or Article 46. In the event the Oireachtas used its transitional power only twice, when it adopted the First Amendment and the Second Amendment. The new constitution then settled down and was not amended again for thirty years. Another difference from the Free State constitution is that the modern constitution requires constitutional amendments to be expressly identified as such. Every amendment must have the long title &quot;An Act to amend the Constitution&quot;.

===Subjects of amendments===
Some amendments made minor changes, such as removing the requirement that elections occur on a public holiday, but others were more radical. These included extending the term of the Dáil in 1927, the abolition of the initiative and of direct elections to the Senate in 1928, extending the period during which the Oireachtas could amend the constitution in 1928, and the introduction of provisions for trial by military tribunals in 1931. From 1933 onwards a series of further amendments were made that gradually dismantled the Treaty settlement by, for example, abolishing the Oath of Allegiance and the office of Governor General. Because a majority of its members disagreed with this process, the Senate was abolished in 1936.

===List of amendments===
In each case but one, the acts amending the Constitution were titled in the form Constitution (Amendment No. 1) Act 1925. The exception is Constitution (Removal of Oath) Act 1933, which does not have a number. The acts are listed below in order of their enactment, but the numbering of constitutional amendments coincides with the order in which they were introduced as bills, so that the sequence does not follow in strict order. There were no Amendments numbered 18, 19 or 25. In addition, &quot;ordinary&quot; Acts of the Oireachtas could modify the constitution. The amendments effected by these acts all lapsed in 1937 with the repeal of the Constitution of the Irish Free State and adoption of the Constitution of Ireland, and the acts themselves were formally repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 2016.

<doc id="165062" wikidata="Q2224989" url="?curid=165062" title="Newcomen atmospheric engine">
<text>The atmospheric engine was invented by Thomas Newcomen in 1712, and is often referred to as the Newcomen fire engine (see below) or simply as a Newcomen engine. The engine was operated by condensing steam drawn into the cylinder, thereby creating a partial vacuum which allowed the atmospheric pressure to push the piston into the cylinder. It was historically significant as the first practical device to harness steam to produce mechanical work. Newcomen engines were used throughout Britain and Europe, principally to pump water out of mines. Hundreds were constructed throughout the 18th century.

James Watt&#x27;s later engine design was an improved version of the Newcomen engine that roughly doubled fuel efficiency. Many atmospheric engines were converted to the Watt design, for a price which was based on a fraction of the fuel-savings. As a result, Watt is today better known than Newcomen in relation to the origin of the steam engine.

==Precursors==
Prior to Newcomen a number of small steam devices of various sorts had been made, but most were essentially novelties. Around 1600 a number of experimenters used steam to power small fountains working like a coffee percolator. First a container was filled with water via a pipe, which extended through the top of the container to nearly the bottom. The bottom of the pipe would be submerged in the water, making the container airtight. The container was then heated to make the water boil. The steam generated pressurized the container, but the inner pipe, immersed at the bottom by liquid, and lacking an airtight seal at top, remained at a lower pressure; expanding steam forced the water at the bottom of the container into and up the pipe to spurt out of a nozzle on top. These devices had limited effectiveness but illustrated the principle&#x27;s viability.

In 1606, the Spaniard, Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont demonstrated and was granted a patent for a steam powered water pump. The pump was successfully used to drain the inundated mines of Guadalcanal, Spain.

In 1662 Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester, published a book containing several ideas he had been working on. One was for a steam-powered pump to supply water to fountains; the device alternately used a partial vacuum and steam pressure. Two containers were alternately filled with steam, then sprayed with cold water making the steam within condense; this produced a partial vacuum that would draw water through a pipe up from a well to the container. A fresh charge of steam under pressure then drove the water from the container up another pipe to a higher-level header before that steam condensed and the cycle repeated. By working the two containers alternately, the delivery rate to the header tank could be increased.

===Savery&#x27;s &quot;Miner&#x27;s Friend&quot;===
In 1698 Thomas Savery patented a steam-powered pump he called the &quot;Miner&#x27;s Friend&quot;, essentially identical to Somerset&#x27;s design and almost certainly a direct copy. The process of cooling and creating the vacuum was fairly slow, so Savery later added an external cold water spray to quickly cool the steam.

Savery&#x27;s invention cannot be strictly regarded as the first steam &quot;engine&quot; since it had no moving parts and could not transmit its power to any external device. There were evidently high hopes for the Miner&#x27;s Friend, which led Parliament to extend the life of the patent by 21 years, so that the 1699 patent would not expire until 1733. Unfortunately, Savery&#x27;s device proved much less successful than had been hoped.

A theoretical problem with Savery&#x27;s device stemmed from the fact that a vacuum could only raise water to a maximum height of about ; to this could be added another , or so, raised by steam pressure. This was insufficient to pump water out of a mine. In Savery&#x27;s pamphlet, he suggests setting the boiler and containers on a ledge in the mineshaft and even a series of two or more pumps for deeper levels. Obviously these were inconvenient solutions and some sort of mechanical pump working at surface level – one that lifted the water directly instead of &quot;sucking&quot; it up – was desirable. Such pumps were common already, powered by horses, but required a vertical reciprocating drive that Savery&#x27;s system did not provide. The more practical problem concerned having a boiler operating under pressure, as demonstrated when the boiler of an engine at Wednesbury exploded, perhaps in 1705.

===Denis Papin&#x27;s experimental steam cylinder and piston===
Louis Figuier in his monumental work gives a full quotation of Denis Papin&#x27;s paper published in 1690 in &quot;Acta eruditorum&quot; at Leipzig, entitled &quot;Nouvelle méthode pour obtenir à bas prix des forces considérables&quot; (A new method for cheaply obtaining considerable forces). It seems that the idea came to Papin whilst working with Robert Boyle at the Royal Society in London. Papin describes first pouring a small quantity of water into the bottom of a vertical cylinder, inserting a piston on a rod and after first evacuating the air below the piston, placing a fire beneath the cylinder to boil the water away and create enough steam pressure to raise the piston to the top end of the cylinder. The piston was then temporarily locked in the upper position by a spring catch engaging a notch in the rod. The fire was then removed, allowing the cylinder to cool, which condensed steam back into water, thus creating a vacuum beneath the piston. To the end of the piston rod was attached a cord passing over two pulleys and a weight hung down from the cord&#x27;s end. Upon releasing the catch, the piston was sharply drawn down to the bottom of the cylinder by the pressure differential between the atmosphere and the created vacuum; enough force was thus generated to raise a weight. &quot;Several of his papers were put before the Royal Society between 1707 and 1712 [including] a description of his 1690 atmospheric steam engine, similar to that built and [subsequently] put into use by Thomas Newcomen in 1712.&quot;

==Introduction and spread==

Newcomen took forward Papin&#x27;s experiment and made it workable, although little information exists as to exactly how this came about. The main problem to which Papin had given no solution was how to make the action repeatable at regular intervals. The way forward was to provide, as Savery had, a boiler capable of ensuring the continuity of the supply of steam to the cylinder, providing the vacuum power stroke by condensing the steam, and disposing of the water once it had been condensed. The power piston was hung by chains from the end of a rocking beam. Unlike Savery&#x27;s device, pumping was entirely mechanical, the work of the steam engine being to lift a weighted rod slung from the opposite extremity of the rocking beam. The rod descended the mine shaft by gravity and drove a force pump, or pole pump (or most often a gang of two) inside the mineshaft. The suction stroke of the pump was only for the length of the upward (priming) stroke, there consequently was no longer the 30-foot restriction of a vacuum pump and water could be forced up a column from far greater depths. The boiler supplied the steam at extremely low pressure and was at first located immediately beneath the power cylinder but could also be placed behind a separating wall with a connecting steam pipe. Making all this work needed the skill of a practical engineer; Newcomen&#x27;s trade as an &quot;ironmonger&quot; or metal merchant would have given him significant practical knowledge of what materials would be suitable for such an engine and brought him into contact with people having even more detailed knowledge.

The earliest examples for which reliable records exist were two engines in the Black Country, of which the more famous was that erected in 1712 at the Conygree Coalworks in Bloomfield Road Tipton now the site of &quot;The Angle Ring Company Limited&quot;, Tipton. This is generally accepted as the first successful Newcomen engine and followed by one built a mile and a half east of Wolverhampton. Both these were used by Newcomen and his partner John Calley to pump out water-filled coal mines. A working replica can today be seen at the nearby Black Country Living Museum, which stands on another part of what was Lord Dudley&#x27;s Conygree Park.
Another Newcomen engine was in Cornwall. Its location is uncertain, but it is known that one was in operation at Wheal Vor mine in 1715.
Soon orders from wet mines all over England were coming in, and some have suggested that word of his achievement was spread through his Baptist connections. Since Savery&#x27;s patent had not yet run out, Newcomen was forced to come to an arrangement with Savery and operate under the latter&#x27;s patent, as its term was much longer than any Newcomen could have easily obtained. During the latter years of its currency, the patent belonged to an unincorporated company, &quot;The Proprietors of the Invention for raising water by fire&quot;.

Although its first use was in coal-mining areas, Newcomen&#x27;s engine was also used for pumping water out of the metal mines in his native West Country, such as the tin mines of Cornwall. By the time of his death, Newcomen and others had installed over a hundred of his engines, not only in the West Country and the Midlands but also in north Wales, near Newcastle and in Cumbria. Small numbers were built in other European countries, including in France, Belgium, Spain, and Hungary, also at Dannemora, Sweden. Evidence of the use of a Newcomen Steam Engine associated with early coal mines was found in 2010 in Midlothian, VA (site of some of the first coal mines in the US).

==Technical details==

===Components===
Although based on simple principles, Newcomen&#x27;s engine was rather complex and showed signs of incremental development, problems being empirically addressed as they arose. It consisted of a boiler A, usually a haystack boiler, situated directly below the cylinder. This produced large quantities of very low pressure steam, no more than – the maximum allowable pressure for a boiler that in earlier versions was made of copper with a domed top of lead and later entirely assembled from small riveted iron plates. The action of the engine was transmitted through a rocking &quot;Great balanced Beam&quot;, the fulcrum E of which rested on the very solid end-gable wall of the purpose-built engine house with the pump side projecting outside of the building, the engine being located &quot;in-house&quot;. The pump rods were slung by a chain from the arch-head F of the great beam. From the in-house arch-head D was suspended a piston P working in a cylinder B, the top end of which was open to the atmosphere above the piston and the bottom end closed, apart from the short admission pipe connecting the cylinder to the boiler; early cylinders were made of cast brass, but cast iron was soon found more effective and much cheaper to produce. The piston was surrounded by a seal in the form of a leather ring, but as the cylinder bore was finished by hand and not absolutely true, a layer of water had to be constantly maintained on top of the piston. Installed high up in the engine house was a water tank C (or &quot;header tank&quot;) fed by a small in-house pump slung from a smaller arch-head. The header tank supplied cold water under pressure via a &quot;stand-pipe&quot; for condensing the steam in the cylinder with a small branch supplying the cylinder-sealing water; at each top stroke of the piston excess warm sealing water overflowed down two pipes, one to the in-house well and the other to feed the boiler by gravity.

===Operation===
The pump equipment was heavier than the steam piston, so that the position of the beam at rest was pump-side down/engine-side up, which was called &quot;out of the house&quot;.

To start the engine, the regulator valve V was opened and steam admitted into the cylinder from the boiler, filling the space beneath the piston. The regulator valve was then closed and the water injection valve V&#x27; briefly snapped open and shut, sending a spray of cold water into the cylinder. This condensed the steam and created a partial vacuum under the piston. Pressure differential between the atmosphere above the piston and the partial vacuum below then drove the piston down making the power stroke, bringing the beam &quot;into the house&quot; and raising the pump gear.

Steam was then readmitted to the cylinder, destroying the vacuum and driving the condensate down the sinking or &quot;eduction&quot; pipe. As the low pressure steam from the boiler flowed into the cylinder, the weight of the pump and gear returned the beam to its initial position whilst at the same time driving the water up from the mine.

This cycle was repeated around 12 times per minute.

====Snifting valve====
Newcomen found that his first engine would stop working after a while, and eventually discovered that this was due to small amounts of air being admitted to the cylinder with the steam. Water usually contains some dissolved air, and boiling the water released this with the steam. This air could not be condensed by the water spray and gradually accumulated until the engine became &quot;wind logged&quot;. To prevent this, a release valve called a &quot;snifting clack&quot; or snifter valve was included near the bottom of the cylinder. This opened briefly when steam was first introduced, and non-condensable gas was driven from the cylinder. Its name was derived from the noise it made when it operated to release the air and steam &quot;like a Man snifting with a Cold&quot;.

===Automation ===

In early versions, the valves or &quot;plugs&quot; as they were then called, were operated manually by the &quot;plug man&quot; but the repetitive action demanded precise timing, making automatic action desirable. This was obtained by means of a &quot;plug tree&quot; which was a beam suspended vertically alongside the cylinder from a small arch head by crossed chains, its function being to open and close the valves automatically when the beam reached certain positions, by means of tappets and escapement mechanisms using weights. On the 1712 engine, the water feed pump was attached to the bottom of the plug tree, but later engines had the pump outside suspended from a separate small arch-head. There is a common legend that in 1713 a &quot;cock boy&quot; named Humphrey Potter, whose duty it was to open and shut the valves of an engine he attended, made the engine self-acting by causing the beam itself to open and close the valves by suitable cords and catches (known as the &quot;potter cord&quot;); however the plug tree device (the first form of valve gear) was very likely established practice before 1715, and is clearly depicted in the earliest known images of Newcomen engines by Henry Beighton (1717) (believed by Hulse to depict the 1714 Griff colliery engine) and by Thomas Barney (1719) (depicting the 1712 Dudley Castle engine). Because of the very heavy steam demands, the engine had to be periodically stopped and restarted, but even this process was automated by means of a buoy rising and falling in a vertical stand pipe fixed to the boiler. The buoy was attached to the &quot;scoggen&quot;, a weighted lever that worked a stop blocking the water injection valve shut until more steam had been raised.

===Pumps===
Most images show only the engine side, giving no information on the pumps. Current opinion is that at least on the early engines, dead-weight force pumps were used, the work of the engine being solely to lift the pump side ready for the next downwards pump stroke. This is the arrangement used for the Dudley Castle replica which effectively works at the original stated rate of 12 strokes per minute/ lifted per stroke. The later Watt engines used lift pumps powered by the engine stroke and it may be that later versions of the Newcomen engine did so too.

==Development and application==

Towards the close of its career, the atmospheric engine was much improved in its mechanical details and its proportions by John Smeaton, who built many large engines of this type during the 1770s. The urgent need for an engine to give rotary motion was making itself felt and this was done with limited success by Wasborough and Pickard using a Newcomen engine to drive a flywheel through a crank. Although the principle of the crank had long been known, Pickard managed to obtain a 12-year patent in 1780 for the specific application of the crank to steam engines; this was a setback to Boulton and Watt who bypassed the patent by applying the sun and planet motion to their advanced double-acting rotative engine of 1782.

By 1725 the Newcomen engine was in common use in mining, particularly collieries. It held its place with little material change for the rest of the century. Use of the Newcomen engine was extended in some places to pump municipal water supply; for instance the first Newcomen engine in France was built at Passy in 1726 to pump water from the Seine to the city of Paris. It was also used to power machinery indirectly, by returning water from below a water wheel to a reservoir above it, so that the same water could again turn the wheel. Among the earliest examples of this was at Coalbrookdale. A horse-powered pump had been installed in 1735 to return water to the pool above the Old Blast Furnace. This was replaced by a Newcomen engine in 1742–3. Several new furnaces built in Shropshire in the 1750s were powered in a similar way, including Horsehay and Ketley Furnaces and Madeley Wood or Bedlam Furnaces. The latter does not seem to have had a pool above the furnace, merely a tank into which the water was pumped. In other industries, engine-pumping was less common, but Richard Arkwright used an engine to provide additional power for his cotton mill.

Attempts were made to drive machinery by Newcomen engines, but these were unsuccessful, as the single power stroke produced a very jerky motion.

==Successor==
The main problem with the Newcomen design was that it used energy inefficiently, and was therefore expensive to operate. After the water vapor within was cooled enough to create the vacuum, the cylinder walls were cold enough to condense some of the steam as it was admitted during the next intake stroke. This meant that a considerable amount of fuel was being used just to heat the cylinder back to the point where the steam would start to fill it again. As the heat losses were related to the surfaces, while useful work related to the volume, increases in the size of the engine increased efficiency, and Newcomen engines became larger in time. However, efficiency did not matter very much within the context of a colliery, where coal was freely available.

Newcomen&#x27;s engine was only replaced when James Watt improved it in 1769 to avoid this problem (Watt had been asked to repair a model of a Newcomen engine by Glasgow University; a small model that exaggerated the problem). In the Watt steam engine, condensation took place in an exterior condenser unit, attached to the steam cylinder via a pipe. When a valve on the pipe was opened, the vacuum in the condenser would, in turn, evacuate that part of the cylinder below the piston. This eliminated the cooling of the main cylinder walls and such, and dramatically reduced fuel use. It also enabled the development of a double-acting cylinder, with both upwards and downwards power strokes, increasing amount of power from the engine without a great increase in the size of the engine.

Watt&#x27;s design, introduced in 1769, did not eliminate Newcomen engines immediately. Watt&#x27;s vigorous defence of his patents resulted in the continued use of the Newcomen engine in an effort to avoid royalty payments. When his patents expired in 1800, there was a rush to install Watt engines, and Newcomen engines were eclipsed, even in collieries.

==Surviving examples==

The Newcomen Memorial Engine can be seen operating in Newcomen&#x27;s home town of Dartmouth, where it was moved in 1963 by the Newcomen Society. This is believed to date from 1725, when it was initially installed at the Griff Colliery near Coventry.

An engine was installed at a colliery in Ashton-under-Lyne in about 1760. Known locally as &quot;Fairbottom Bobs&quot; it is now preserved at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan.

The only Newcomen-style engine still extant in its original location is at what is now the Elsecar Heritage Centre, near Barnsley in South Yorkshire. This was probably the last commercially used Newcomen-style engine, as it ran from 1795 until 1923. The engine underwent extensive conservation works, together with its original shaft and engine-house, which were completed in autumn 2014.

There are two static examples of a Newcomen Engine. One is in the Science Museum, London. A second example is in the National Museum of Scotland. Formerly at Caprington Colliery at Kilmarnock.

Another example, originally used at Farme Colliery is on display at Summerlee, Museum of Scottish Industrial Life; unusually it was used for winding rather than water pumping, and had been in operation for almost a century when examined in situ in 1902.
In 1986, a full-scale operational replica of the 1712 Newcomen Steam Engine was completed at the Black Country Living Museum in Dudley. It is the only full-size working replica of the engine in existence and is believed to be a couple of miles away from the site of the first completed engine, erected in 1712. The &#x27;fire engine&#x27; as it was known, is an impressive brick building from which a wooden beam projects through one wall. Rods hang from the outer end of the beam and operate pumps at the bottom of the mine shaft which raise the water to the surface. The engine itself is simple, with only a boiler, a cylinder and piston and operating valves. A coal fire heats the water in the boiler which is little more than a covered pan and the steam generated then passes through a valve into the brass cylinder above the boiler. The cylinder is more than 2 metres long and 52 centimetres in diameter. The steam in the cylinder is condensed by injecting cold water and the vacuum beneath the piston pulls the inner end of the beam down and causes the pump to move.

<text>The Watt steam engine design was an invention of James Watt that became synonymous with steam engines during the Industrial Revolution, and it was many years before significantly new designs began to replace the basic Watt design.

The first steam engines, introduced by Thomas Newcomen in 1712, were of the &quot;atmospheric&quot; design. At the end of the power stroke, the weight of the object being moved by the engine pulled the piston to the top of the cylinder as steam was introduced. Then the cylinder was cooled by a spray of water, which caused the steam to condense, forming a partial vacuum in the cylinder. Atmospheric pressure on the top of the piston pushed it down, lifting the work object. James Watt noticed that it required significant amounts of heat to warm the cylinder back up to the point where steam could enter the cylinder without immediately condensing. When the cylinder was warm enough that it became filled with steam the next power stroke could commence.

Watt realised that the heat needed to warm the cylinder could be saved by adding a separate condensing cylinder. After the power cylinder was filled with steam, a valve was opened to the secondary cylinder, allowing the steam to flow into it and be condensed, which drew the steam from the main cylinder causing the power stroke. The condensing cylinder was water cooled to keep the steam condensing. At the end of the power stroke, the valve was closed so the power cylinder could be filled with steam as the piston moved to the top. The result was the same cycle as Newcomen&#x27;s design, but without any cooling of the power cylinder which was immediately ready for another stroke.

Watt worked on the design over a period of several years, introducing the condenser, and introducing improvements to practically every part of the design. Notably, Watt performed a lengthy series of trials on ways to seal the piston in the cylinder, which considerably reduced leakage during the power stroke, preventing power loss. All of these changes produced a more reliable design which used half as much coal to produce the same amount of power.

The new design was introduced commercially in 1776, with the first example sold to the Carron Company ironworks. Watt continued working to improve the engine, and in 1781 introduced a system using a sun and planet gear to turn the linear motion of the engines into rotary motion. This made it useful not only in the original pumping role, but also as a direct replacement in roles where a water wheel would have been used previously. This was a key moment in the industrial revolution, since power sources could now be located anywhere instead of, as previously, needing a suitable water source and topography. Watt&#x27;s partner Matthew Boulton began developing a multitude of machines that made use of this rotary power, developing the first modern industrialized factory, the Soho Foundry, which in turn produced new steam engine designs. Watt&#x27;s early engines were like the original Newcomen designs in that they used low-pressure steam, and all of the power was produced by atmospheric pressure. When, in the early 1800s, other companies introduced high-pressure steam engines, Watt was reluctant to follow suit due to safety concerns. Wanting to improve on the performance of his engines, Watt began considering the use of higher-pressure steam, as well as designs using multiple cylinders in both the double-acting concept and the multiple-expansion concept. These double-acting engines required the invention of the parallel motion, which allowed the piston rods of the individual cylinders to move in straight lines, keeping the piston true in the cylinder, while the walking beam end moved through an arc, somewhat analogous to a crosshead in later steam engines.

==Introduction==
In 1698, the English mechanical designer Thomas Savery invented a pumping appliance that used steam to draw water directly from a well by means of a vacuum created by condensing steam. The appliance was also proposed for draining mines, but it could only draw fluid up approximately , meaning it had to be located within this distance of the mine floor being drained. As mines became deeper, this was often impractical. It also consumed a large amount of fuel compared with later engines.
The solution to draining deep mines was found by Thomas Newcomen who developed an &quot;atmospheric&quot; engine that also worked on the vacuum principle. It employed a cylinder containing a movable piston connected by a chain to one end of a rocking beam that worked a mechanical lift pump from its opposite end. At the bottom of each stroke, steam was allowed to enter the cylinder below the piston. As the piston rose within the cylinder, drawn upward by a counterbalance, it drew in steam at atmospheric pressure. At the top of the stroke the steam valve was closed, and cold water was briefly injected into the cylinder as a means of cooling the steam. This water condensed the steam and created a partial vacuum below the piston. The atmospheric pressure outside the engine was then greater than the pressure within the cylinder, thereby pushing the piston into the cylinder. The piston, attached to a chain and in turn attached to one end of the &quot;rocking beam&quot;, pulled down the end of the beam, lifting the opposite end of the beam. Hence, the pump deep in the mine attached to opposite end of the beam via ropes and chains was driven. The pump pushed, rather than pulled the column of water upward, hence it could lift water any distance. Once the piston was at the bottom, the cycle repeated.

The Newcomen engine was more powerful than the Savery engine. For the first time water could be raised from a depth of over . The first example from 1712 was able to replace a team of 500 horses that had been used to pump out the mine. Seventy-five Newcomen pumping engines were installed at mines in Britain, France, Holland, Sweden and Russia. In the next fifty years only a few small changes were made to the engine design.

While Newcomen engines brought practical benefits, they were inefficient in terms of the use of energy to power them. The system of alternately sending jets of steam, then cold water into the cylinder meant that the walls of the cylinder were alternately heated, then cooled with each stroke. Each charge of steam introduced would continue condensing until the cylinder approached working temperature once again. So at each stroke part of the potential of the steam was lost.

==Separate condenser==

In 1763, James Watt was working as instrument maker at the University of Glasgow when he was assigned the job of repairing a model Newcomen engine and noted how inefficient it was.

In 1765, Watt conceived the idea of equipping the engine with a separate condensation chamber, which he called a &quot;condenser&quot;. Because the condenser and the working cylinder were separate, condensation occurred without significant loss of heat from the cylinder. The condenser remained cold and below atmospheric pressure at all times, while the cylinder remained hot at all times.

Steam was drawn from the boiler to the cylinder under the piston. When the piston reached the top of the cylinder, the steam inlet valve closed and the valve controlling the passage to the condenser opened. The condenser being at a lower pressure, drew the steam from the cylinder into the condenser where it cooled and condensed from water vapour to liquid water, maintaining a partial vacuum in the condenser that was communicated to the space of the cylinder by the connecting passage. External atmospheric pressure then pushed the piston down the cylinder.

The separation of the cylinder and condenser eliminated the loss of heat that occurred when steam was condensed in the working cylinder of a Newcomen engine. This gave the Watt engine greater efficiency than the Newcomen engine, reducing the amount of coal consumed while doing the same amount of work as a Newcomen engine.

In Watt&#x27;s design, the cold water was injected only into the condensation chamber. This type of condenser is known as a &quot;jet condenser&quot;. The condenser is located in a cold water bath below the cylinder. The volume of water entering the condenser as spray absorbed the latent heat of the steam, and was determined as seven times the volume of the condensed steam. The condensate and the injected water was then removed by the air pump, and the surrounding cold water served to absorb the remaining thermal energy to retain a condenser temperature of and the equivalent pressure of .

At each stroke the warm condensate was drawn off from the condenser and sent to a hot well by a vacuum pump, which also helped to evacuate the steam from under the power cylinder. The still-warm condensate was recycled as feedwater for the boiler.

Watt&#x27;s next improvement to the Newcomen design was to seal the top of the cylinder and surround the cylinder with a jacket. Steam was passed through the jacket before being admitted below the piston, keeping the piston and cylinder warm to prevent condensation within it. The second improvement was the utilisation of steam expansion against the vacuum on the other side of the piston. The steam supply was cut during the stroke, and the steam expanded against the vacuum on the other side. This increased the efficiency of the engine, but also created a variable torque on the shaft which was undesirable for many applications, in particular pumping. Watt therefore limited the expansion to a ratio of 1:2 (i.e. the steam supply was cut at half stroke). This increased the theoretical efficiency from 6.4% to 10.6%, with only a small variation in piston pressure. Watt did not use high pressure steam because of safety concerns.

These improvements led to the fully developed version of 1776 that actually went into production.

==The partnership of Matthew Boulton and James Watt==

The separate condenser showed dramatic potential for improvements on the Newcomen engine but Watt was still discouraged by seemingly insurmountable problems before a marketable engine could be perfected. It was only after entering into partnership with Matthew Boulton that such became reality. Watt told Boulton about his ideas on improving the engine, and Boulton, an avid entrepreneur, agreed to fund development of a test engine at Soho, near Birmingham. At last Watt had access to facilities and the practical experience of craftsmen who were soon able to get the first engine working. As fully developed, it used about 75% less fuel than a similar Newcomen one.

In 1775, Watt designed two large engines: one for the Bloomfield Colliery at Tipton, completed in March 1776, and one for John Wilkinson&#x27;s ironworks at Broseley in Shropshire, which was at work the following month. A third engine, at Stratford-le-Bow in east London, was also working that summer.

Watt had tried unsuccessfully for several years to obtain an accurately bored cylinder for his steam engines, and was forced to use hammered iron, which was out of round and caused leakage past the piston. Joseph Wickham Roe stated in 1916: &quot;When [John] Smeaton saw the first engine he reported to the Society of Engineers that &#x27;Neither the tools nor the workmen existed who could manufacture such a complex machine with sufficient precision.

In 1774, John Wilkinson invented a boring machine in which the shaft that held the cutting tool was supported on both ends and extended through the cylinder, unlike the cantilevered borers then in use. Boulton wrote in 1776 that &quot;Mr. Wilkinson has bored us several cylinders almost without error; that of 50 inches diameter, which we have put up at Tipton, does not err on the thickness of an old shilling in any part&quot;.

Boulton and Watt&#x27;s practice was to help mine-owners and other customers to build engines, supplying men to erect them and some specialised parts. However, their main profit from their patent was derived from charging a licence fee to the engine owners, based on the cost of the fuel they saved. The greater fuel efficiency of their engines meant that they were most attractive in areas where fuel was expensive, particularly Cornwall, for which three engines were ordered in 1777, for the Wheal Busy, Ting Tang, and Chacewater mines.

==Later improvements==

The first Watt engines were atmospheric pressure engines, like the Newcomen engine but with the condensation taking place separate from the cylinder. Driving the engines using both low pressure steam and a partial vacuum raised the possibility of reciprocating engine development. An arrangement of valves could alternately admit low pressure steam to the cylinder and then connect with the condenser. Consequently, the direction of the power stroke might be reversed, making it easier to obtain rotary motion. Additional benefits of the double acting engine were increased efficiency, higher speed (greater power) and more regular motion.

Before the development of the double acting piston, the linkage to the beam and the piston rod had been by means of a chain, which meant that power could only be applied in one direction, by pulling. This was effective in engines that were used for pumping water, but the double action of the piston meant that it could push as well as pull. This was not possible as long as the beam and the rod were connected by a chain. Furthermore, it was not possible to connect the piston rod of the sealed cylinder &quot;directly&quot; to the beam, because while the rod moved vertically in a straight line, the beam was pivoted at its centre, with each side inscribing an arc. To bridge the conflicting actions of the beam and the piston, Watt developed his parallel motion. This device used a four bar linkage coupled with a pantograph to produce the required straight line motion much more cheaply than if he had used a slider type of linkage. He was very proud of his solution.

Having the beam connected to the piston shaft by a means that applied force alternately in both directions also meant that it was possible to use the motion of the beam to turn a wheel. The simplest solution to transforming the action of the beam into a rotating motion was to connect the beam to a wheel by a crank, but because another party had patent rights on the use of the crank, Watt was obliged to come up with another solution. He adopted the epicyclic sun and planet gear system suggested by an employee William Murdoch, only later reverting, once the patent rights had expired, to the more familiar crank seen on most engines today. The main wheel attached to the crank was large and heavy, serving as a flywheel which, once set in motion, by its momentum maintained a constant power and smoothed the action of the alternating strokes. To its rotating central shaft, belts and gears could be attached to drive a great variety of machinery.

Because factory machinery needed to operate at a constant speed, Watt linked a steam regulator valve to a centrifugal governor which he adapted from those used to automatically control the speed of windmills. The centrifugal was not a true speed controller because it could not hold a set speed in response to a change in load.

These improvements allowed the steam engine to replace the water wheel and horses as the main sources of power for British industry, thereby freeing it from geographical constraints and becoming one of the main drivers in the Industrial Revolution.

Watt was also concerned with fundamental research on the functioning of the steam engine. His most notable measuring device, still in use today, is the Watt indicator incorporating a manometer to measure steam pressure within the cylinder according to the position of the piston, enabling a diagram to be produced representing the pressure of the steam as a function of its volume throughout the cycle.

==Preserved Watt engines==
The oldest surviving Watt engine is &quot;Old Bess&quot; of 1777, now in the Science Museum, London. 
The oldest working engine in the world is the Smethwick Engine, brought into service in May 1779 and now at Thinktank in Birmingham (formerly at the now defunct Museum of Science and Industry, Birmingham).
The oldest still in its original engine house and still capable of doing the job for which it was installed is the 1812 Boulton and Watt engine at the Crofton Pumping Station in Wiltshire. This was used to pump water for the Kennet and Avon Canal; on certain weekends throughout the year the modern pumps are switched off and the two steam engines at Crofton still perform this function.
The oldest extant rotative steam engine, the Whitbread Engine (from 1785, the third rotative engine ever built), is located in the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, Australia.
A Boulton-Watt engine of 1788 may be found in the Science Museum, London, while an 1817 blowing engine, formerly used at the Netherton ironworks of M W Grazebrook now decorates Dartmouth Circus, a traffic island at the start of the A38(M) motorway in Birmingham.

The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan houses a replica of a 1788 Watt rotative engine. It is a full-scale working model of a Boulton-Watt engine. The American industrialist Henry Ford commissioned the replica engine from the English manufacturer Charles Summerfield in 1932. The museum also holds an original Boulton and Watt atmospheric pump engine, originally used for canal pumping in Birmingham, illustrated below, and in use in situ at the Bowyer Street pumping station, from 1796 until 1854, and afterwards removed to Dearborn in 1929.

Another one is preserved at Fumel factory, France.

== Watt engine produced by Hathorn, Davey and Co ==
In the 1880s, Hathorn Davey and Co / Leeds produced a 1 hp / 125 rpm atmospheric engine with external condenser but without steam expansion. It has been argued that this was probably the last commercial atmospheric engine to be manufactured. As an atmospheric engine, it did not have a pressurised boiler. It was intended for small businesses.
== Recent developments ==
Watt&#x27;s Expansion Engine is generally considered as of historic interest only. There are however some recent developments which may lead to a renaissance of the technology. Today, there is an enormous amount of waste steam and waste heat with temperatures between generated by industry. In addition, solarthermal collectors, geothermal energy sources and biomass reactors produce heat in this temperature range. There are technologies to utilise this energy, in particular the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). In principle, these are steam turbines which do not use water but a fluid (a refrigerant) which evaporates at temperatures below . Such systems are however fairly complex. They work with pressures of , so that the whole system has to be completely sealed.

The Expansion Engine can offer significant advantages here, in particular for lower power ratings of 2 to 100 kW: with expansion ratios of 1:5, the theoretical efficiency reaches 15%, which is in the range of ORC systems. The Expansion Engine uses water as working fluid which is simple, cheap, non-toxic, non-flammable and non-corrosive. It works at pressure near and below atmospheric, so that sealing is not a problem. And it is a simple machine, implying cost effectiveness. Researchers from the University of Southampton / UK are currently developing a modern version of Watt&#x27;s engine in order to generate energy from waste steam and waste heat. They improved the theory, demonstrating that theoretical efficiencies of up to 17.4% (and actual efficiencies of 11%) are possible. 
In order to demonstrate the principle, a 25 watt experimental model engine was built and tested. The engine incorporates steam expansion as well as new features such as electronic control. The picture shows the model built and tested in 2016. Currently, a project to build and test a scaled-up 2 kW engine is under preparation.

<text>Colin Charles Baker (born 8 June 1943) is an English actor. He played Paul Merroney in the BBC television drama series &quot;The Brothers&quot; from 1974 to 1976 and the sixth incarnation of the Doctor in the long-running science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; from 1984 to 1986. Baker&#x27;s tenure as the Doctor proved to be a controversial era for the series, which included a hiatus in production and his subsequent replacement on the orders of BBC executives. His performances as the Sixth Doctor in audio plays published by Big Finish Productions have been generally well received by fans.

==Early life==
Colin Charles Baker was born on 8 June 1943 in Waterloo, London. He moved north to Rochdale with his family when he was 3 years old. He was educated at St Bede&#x27;s College, Manchester, where he passed A&#x27; Levels in French, Latin and Greek. Particularly strong in Latin and Greek, Baker achieved 2 A grades. He studied law at a London college and subsequently trained to become a solicitor. At the age of 23, Baker enrolled at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA).

==Career==
===Early work in television===

Baker&#x27;s numerous television roles in the early 1970s included a supporting role in a 1970 BBC &quot;adaptation&quot; of Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s trilogy &quot;The Roads to Freedom&quot;, a leading role as Count Steinbock in their adaptation of &quot;Cousin Bette&quot; the following year, playing opposite Margaret Tyzack and Helen Mirren. In 1972 he played Anatole Kuragin, opposite Anthony Hopkins in the BBC adaptation of &quot;War and Peace&quot;. His regular television work continued and in &quot;Fall of Eagles&quot;, Baker appeared as Crown Prince Wilhelm of the German Empire.

By far his most prominent role to date came in 1974, playing the ruthless banker Paul Merroney in the BBC Sunday evening series &quot;The Brothers&quot;. Baker joined the series half-way through its run, as Merroney became one of the leading characters over three and a half series from 1974–76.

After &quot;The Brothers&quot;, he worked regularly in theatre and his television work became less frequent, although he guest-starred as Bayban the Butcher in a 1980 episode of &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;, &quot;City at the Edge of the World&quot;. He had further guest roles on television and in 1983 featured in a BBC production of A.J. Cronin&#x27;s &quot;The Citadel&quot;.

===&quot;Doctor Who&quot; (1984–1986)===
Baker made his first appearance in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as Commander Maxil in the Peter Davison-era story &quot;Arc of Infinity&quot; (1983). He then became the second of three actors to be cast as the Doctor by producer John Nathan-Turner. Baker&#x27;s first appearance in the starring role occurred in the final moments of &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot; (1984), where he delivered his first few lines. He then made his full story debut the following week in &quot;The Twin Dilemma&quot;. The serial, and Baker&#x27;s portrayal of the Doctor, caused immediate controversy, with one scene in which the Doctor attempts to strangle his companion, Peri Brown. According to &quot;PopMatters&quot;, &quot;Colin Baker&#x27;s first appearance was just out-and-out dislikable, showcasing a hubris and harshness that was heretofore unseen in the Doctor&#x27;s emotional canon.&quot;

Baker&#x27;s era was interrupted by an 18-month hiatus which was announced in February 1985, midway through transmission of Season 22, his first full season. The Controller of BBC1 at the time, Michael Grade, criticised &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, saying that the programme had become overly violent in 1985. Grade later admitted that he &quot;hated&quot; the series, which he described as a &quot;very clunky studio show&quot;. One new &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story, &quot;Slipback&quot;, was produced for radio during the hiatus, which starred Baker and his regular television companion Nicola Bryant.

&quot;Doctor Who&quot; returned to television for its 23rd season in September 1986. The season featured a reduction in episodes, was made entirely on video for location scenes and was produced as a 14-episode-long serial called &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot;. This serial was a meta-textual reference to the fact that the series itself was &quot;on trial&quot; at this time. In 1986 Baker told an interviewer: &quot;Tom Baker did it for seven years. ... There&#x27;s a part of me which likes to have a tilt at records. I would like to think that maybe I&#x27;d still be doing it in eight years&#x27; time.&quot; Later that year the series was recommissioned, but Nathan-Turner was ordered to change the actor playing the Doctor. Although sources have attributed this decision to Grade, he denied this in 2022. The BBC&#x27;s Head of Series, Jonathan Powell, later said that the BBC was looking for &quot;one last chance saloon, for an actor who would take off with the public.&quot; Peter Davison argued in 2018 that the decision was more to do with the executives wanting to get rid of Nathan-Turner, saying: &quot;I was upset about what happened, really – because, first of all, it wasn&#x27;t to do with Colin, I know that. It was to do with other issues. The power structure in the BBC had changed and they didn&#x27;t want John Nathan-Turner around is the truth of it.&quot;

Baker was removed from the part after starring in only eleven stories and just short of three years in the series, including the hiatus, making his tenure as the Doctor the shortest at that point. After his sacking, Baker was offered a single four-part story that would end in his character&#x27;s regeneration, but he refused the offer. In response, Baker offered to do the entirety of the following season and regenerate at its conclusion, but the BBC never responded to his letter. Instead, his replacement, Sylvester McCoy, played the injured Sixth Doctor in a blonde wig as he regenerates in the opening minutes of &quot;Time and the Rani&quot;, his face hidden by video effects as the regeneration process occurs. In an interview in 2019, Baker expressed regret for not returning for the scene, stating that he was &quot;brutally selfish at the time&quot; and that he was not thinking about the fans.

On 4 September 2011 at Riverside Studios, Hammersmith, London, Baker accepted the presidency of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Appreciation Society, which had previously been held by Jon Pertwee and Nicholas Courtney. He was elected following an online poll of the society&#x27;s members where he won more votes than all the other candidates combined.

===&quot;Doctor Who&quot; appearances in other media===
From 5 June to 19 August 1989, Baker agreed to appear as the Doctor once more, in the stage play &quot;Doctor Who – The Ultimate Adventure&quot;, taking over from original lead Jon Pertwee who had fallen ill.

In 1992, Baker became the first Doctor to write a published &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story, &quot;The Deal&quot;, as part of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;″s &quot;Brief Encounters&quot; series. He wrote a second &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; the following year. Both featured the Sixth Doctor and Mel. In 1994 Baker wrote a comic strip, &quot;The Age of Chaos&quot; featuring the Sixth Doctor and Frobisher, and in 2001 contributed a story entitled &quot;The Wings of A Butterfly&quot; to a charity short story anthology based on Doctor Who, &quot;Missing Pieces&quot;. He also presented special &quot;Doctor Who&quot; videotape releases &quot;Cybermen – The Early Years&quot; in 1992 and &quot;The Colin Baker Years&quot; in 1994, with the latter a look back at his tenure on the series highlighted by clips and his memories.

Baker has reprised the role on television only twice after his official run ended, in the 1993 &quot;Children in Need&quot; charity special &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot; alongside Pertwee, Tom Baker, Peter Davison and Sylvester McCoy, and in the 2022 special &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot; alongside David Bradley, Davison, Paul McGann, McCoy and Jodie Whittaker. He reprised the role again in &quot;Tales of the TARDIS&quot;.

In 1997, Baker provided audio dialogue for the BBC video game &quot;Doctor Who: Destiny of the Doctors&quot;.

1999 saw Baker voice his first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio adventure for Big Finish Productions, &quot;The Sirens of Time&quot;. As of , Baker has appeared as the Sixth Doctor in 166 releases, with more planned for the future. These audio plays are generally well received by fans and in a poll conducted by &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;, Baker was voted the &quot;greatest&quot; of the Doctors in this format. He also reprised the role of Commander Maxil in the &quot;Gallifrey&quot; audio series story &quot;Appropriation&quot; in 2006; in 2022, he played alternate versions of the Fifth Doctor (known as the Doctor of War) in the &quot;Doctor Who Unbound&quot; series and the Curator in &quot;The Eighth Doctor Adventures&quot;.

In recent years, Baker has appeared on a number of DVD releases of his episodes, featuring in either &quot;making-of&quot; documentaries or commentaries. The documentary &quot;Trials and Tribulations&quot;, included in the 2008 DVD release of &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; examines his turbulent three years on the show.

In November 2013, Baker co-starred in the one-off 50th anniversary comedy homage &quot;The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot&quot;.

In the final episode of Jodie Whittaker’s tenure as the Doctor, Baker returned for a cameo appearance alongside Davison, McCoy and Paul McGann as a manifestation of the Doctor’s subconscious.

From 2023 onwards, Baker hosts the Big Finish produced podcast &quot;Into the TARDIS&quot;, presenting the various audio stories broadcast in the series.

===After &quot;Doctor Who&quot;===

Since leaving &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Baker has spent much of his time on the stage with appearances throughout the country in plays as diverse as Peter Nichols&#x27; &quot;Privates on Parade&quot;, Ira Levin&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Deathtrap&quot;&quot;, Ray Cooney&#x27;s &quot;Run for Your Wife&quot; and Ariel Dorfman&#x27;s &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot;. For many years he has been a pantomime stalwart. In 2000 he appeared in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; alongside actress Louise Jameson who had previously played the Fourth Doctor&#x27;s companion Leela. In 2003 he starred in the Carl Rosa Opera Company&#x27;s production of operetta &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, directed by Timothy West. In 2008, he toured with ex-wife Liza Goddard in &quot;She Stoops To Conquer&quot;. Other theatre appearances have seen Baker tackle the role of Inspector Morse in &quot;House of Ghosts&quot; and a UK tour of &quot;The Woman in White&quot;.

In 1991, Baker played a Doctor-like character in the BBV video series &quot;The Stranger&quot;. This character appeared in six video adventures as well four audio stories. Another standalone BBV drama entitled &quot;The Airzone Solution&quot; appeared in 1993 and featured former &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actors Jon Pertwee, Peter Davison and Sylvester McCoy.

Television work through the 1990s included guest appearances in the BBC&#x27;s medical drama &quot;Casualty&quot;, &quot;The Knock&quot;, &quot;Dangerfield&quot;, the first episode of &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot;, Channel 4&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot; and as himself as the resident celebrity in &#x27;Dictionary Corner&#x27; on the daytime quiz show &quot;Countdown&quot;, also on Channel 4.

In 2003, Baker appeared on &quot;Top Gear&quot;, participating on a one-lap run on the Top Gear track in a Honda Civic hatchback. Baker competed against a Klingon, a Cyberman, a Dalek, Darth Vader and Ming the Merciless. Baker came in 4th position, with the Cyberman coming 1st.

A 2005 guest appearance in comedy sketch show &quot;Little Britain&quot; was never transmitted but can be seen in the deleted scenes special feature on the &quot;Little Britain&quot; series 3 DVD. Other television appearances have seen Baker appear in &quot;Kingdom&quot;, &quot;Hustle&quot; and &quot;Doctors&quot;.

Away from his &quot;Doctor Who&quot; work for Big Finish Productions (see above), Baker appeared in the audio dramas &quot;Sapphire and Steel: The Mystery of the Missing Hour&quot; and the 3 part &quot;Earthsearch Mindwarp&quot;. The latter, based on a James Follett novel, was broadcast on the digital radio station BBC 7 in 2006.

In 2010, Baker narrated and provided additional voices for the audiobook version of the sci-fi/comedy novel, &quot;Kangazang! Remote Possibilities&quot;. Written by Terry Cooper, and published by Candy Jar Books.

Baker&#x27;s film work over the years includes &quot;The Harpist&quot; (1999), &quot;The Asylum&quot; (2000) and &quot;D&#x27;Artagnan et les trois mousquetaires&quot; (2005). 
Since 1995 Baker has written a regular weekly column for local newspaper &quot;Bucks Free Press&quot;. A compilation of his articles from 1995 to 2009 were published in the book, &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot;.

Baker participated in the 12th series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, finishing in 8th place out of 12 celebrities.

==Personal life==

Baker&#x27;s first wife was actress Liza Goddard who had appeared with him in the TV series &quot;The Brothers&quot;. Their marriage lasted 18 months and ended in divorce. With his second wife, Marion Wyatt, an actress, whom he married in 1982, Baker has four daughters: Lucy, Bindy (an accomplished singer), Lalla and Rosie. They also had a son, Jack, who died of sudden infant death syndrome. His wife and daughters appeared in &quot;The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot&quot; as themselves.
