<text>Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is a conceptualisation of the needs (or goals) that motivate human behaviour, which was proposed by the American psychologist Abraham Maslow. According to Maslow’s original formulation, there are five sets of basic needs that are related to each other in a hierarchy of prepotency (or strength). Typically, the hierarchy is depicted in the form of a pyramid although Maslow was not himself responsible for the iconic diagram. The pyramid begins at the bottom with physiological needs (the most prepotent of all) and culminates at the top with self-actualization needs. In his later writings, Maslow added a sixth level of ‘meta-needs’ and metamotivation.

The hierarchy of needs developed by Maslow is one of his most enduring contributions to psychology. The hierarchy of needs remains a popular framework and tool in higher education, business and management training, sociology research, healthcare, counselling and social work. Although widely used and researched, the hierarchy of needs has been criticized for its lack of conclusive supporting evidence and its validity remains contested.

== Historical development ==
Maslow proposed his hierarchy of needs in his 1943 paper &quot;A Theory of Human Motivation&quot; in the journal &quot;Psychological Review&quot;. The theory is a classification system intended to reflect the universal needs of society as its base, then proceeding to more acquired emotions. The hierarchy is split between deficiency needs and growth needs, with two key themes involved within the theory being individualism and the prioritization of needs. 

According to Maslow’s original formulation, there are five sets of basic needs: physiological, safety, love, esteem and self-actualization. These needs are related to each other in a hierarchy of prepotency (or strength) beginning with the physiological needs that are the most prepotent of all. If the physiological needs are fulfilled, a new set of safety needs emerges. If both the physiological and safety needs are fairly well gratified, the prepotent (‘higher’) need of love (both its giving and receiving) then emerges. The next need is esteem, and finally self-actualization. Maslow also coined the term &quot;metamotivation&quot; to describe the motivation of people who go beyond the scope of basic needs and strive for constant betterment.

The hierarchy suggests a rigid separation of needs, but Maslow stressed that a need does not require being satisfied 100% before the next need emerges. Instead, “a more realistic description of the hierarchy would be in terms of decreasing percentages of satisfaction as we go up the hierarchy of prepotency”.

=== Pyramid ===
Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs is often portrayed in the shape of a pyramid, with the largest, most fundamental needs at the bottom, and the need for self-actualization and transcendence at the top. However, Maslow himself never created a pyramid to represent the hierarchy of needs. 
The most fundamental four layers of the pyramid contain what Maslow called &quot;deficiency needs&quot; or &quot;d-needs&quot;: esteem, friendship and love, security, and physical needs. If these &quot;deficiency needs&quot; are not met – except for the most fundamental (physiological) need – there may not be a physical indication, but the individual will feel anxious and tense. Deprivation is what causes deficiency, so when one has unmet needs, this motivates them to fulfill what they are being denied. 

The human brain is a complex system and has parallel processes running at the same time, thus many different motivations from various levels of Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy can occur at the same time. Maslow spoke clearly about these levels and their satisfaction in terms such as &quot;relative&quot;, &quot;general&quot;, and &quot;primarily&quot;. Instead of stating that the individual focuses on a certain need at any given time, Maslow stated that a certain need &quot;dominates&quot; the human organism. Thus Maslow acknowledged the likelihood that the different levels of motivation could occur at any time in the human mind, but he focused on identifying the basic types of motivation and the order in which they would tend to be met. In addition to his anthropological studies, Maslow drew on animal data that &quot;studied and observed monkeys [...] noticing their unusual pattern of behavior that addressed priorities based on individual needs&quot;.

=== Alternative illustrations of hierarchy ===

In contrast to the well-known pyramid, a number of alternative schematic illustrations of the hierachy of needs have been developed. One of the earliest, in 1962, shows a more dynamic hierarchy in terms of &#x27;waves&#x27; of different needs overlapping at the same time. As illustrated, the peak of an earlier main set of needs must be passed before the next &#x27;higher&#x27; need can begin to assume a dominant role.

Other schematic illustrations of the hierarchy use overlapping triangles to depict the interaction of the different needs. One such updated hierarchy proposes that self-actualization is removed from its privileged place atop the
pyramid because it is largely subsumed within status (esteem) and mating-related motives in the new framework.

== Needs ==
=== Physiological needs ===
Physiological needs are the base of the hierarchy. These needs are the biological component for human survival. According to Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs, physiological needs are factored into internal motivation. According to Maslow&#x27;s theory, humans are compelled to satisfy physiological needs first to pursue higher levels of intrinsic satisfaction. To advance higher-level needs in Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy, physiological needs must be met first. This means that if a person is struggling to meet their physiological needs, they are unwilling to seek safety, belonging, esteem, and self-actualization on their own.

Physiological needs include: Air, Water, Food, Heat, Clothes, Reproduction, Shelter and Sleep. Many of these physiological needs must be met for the human body to remain in homeostasis. Air, for example, is a physiological need; a human being requires air more urgently than higher-level needs, such as a sense of social belonging. Physiological needs are critical to &quot;meet the very basic essentials of life&quot;. This allows for cravings such as hunger and thirst to be satisfied and not disrupt the regulation of the body.

=== Safety needs ===
Once a person&#x27;s physiological needs are satisfied, their safety needs take precedence and dominate behavior. In the absence of physical safety – due to war, natural disaster, family violence, childhood abuse, etc. and/or in the absence of economic safety – (due to an economic crisis and lack of work opportunities) these safety needs manifest themselves in ways such as a preference for job security, grievance procedures for protecting the individual from unilateral authority, savings accounts, insurance policies, disability accommodations, etc. This level is more likely to predominate in children as they generally have a greater need to feel safe – especially children who have disabilities. Adults are also impacted by this, typically in economic matters; &quot;adults are not immune to the need of safety&quot;. It includes shelter, job security, health, and safe environments. If a person does not feel safe in an environment, they will seek safety before attempting to meet any higher level of survival. This is why the &quot;goal of consistently meeting the need for safety is to have stability in one&#x27;s life&quot;, stability brings back the concept of homeostasis for humans which our bodies need.

Safety needs include:
* Health
* Personal security
* Emotional security
* Financial security

=== Love and social needs ===
After physiological and safety needs are fulfilled, the third level of human needs is interpersonal and involves feelings of belongingness. According to Maslow, humans possess an effective need for a sense of belonging and acceptance among social groups, regardless of whether these groups are large or small; being a part of a group is crucial, regardless if it is work, sports, friends or family. The sense of belongingness is &quot;being comfortable with and connection to others that results from receiving acceptance, respect, and love.&quot; For example, some large social groups may include clubs, co-workers, religious groups, professional organizations, sports teams, gangs or online communities. Some examples of small social connections include family members, intimate partners, mentors, colleagues, and confidants. Humans need to love and be loved – both sexually and non-sexually – by others according to Maslow. Many people become susceptible to loneliness, social anxiety, and clinical depression in the absence of this love or belonging element. This need is especially strong in childhood and it can override the need for safety as witnessed in children who cling to abusive parents. Deficiencies due to hospitalism, neglect, shunning, ostracism, etc. can adversely affect the individual&#x27;s ability to form and maintain emotionally significant relationships in general. 
Mental health can be a huge factor when it comes to an individual&#x27;s needs and development. When an individual&#x27;s needs are not met, it can cause depression during adolescence. When an individual grows up in a higher-income family, it is much more likely that they will have a lower rate of depression. This is because all of their basic needs are met. Studies have shown that when a family goes through financial stress for a prolonged time, depression rates are higher, not only because their basic needs are not being met, but because this stress strains the parent-child relationship. The parent(s) is stressed about providing for their children, and they are also likely to spend less time at home because they are working more to make more money and provide for their family.

Social belonging needs include:
* Family
* Friendship
* Intimacy
*Trust
*Acceptance
*Receiving and giving love and affection

In certain situations, the need for belonging may overcome the physiological and security needs, depending on the strength of the peer pressure. In contrast, for some individuals, the need for self-esteem is more important than the need for belonging; and for others, the need for creative fulfillment may supersede even the most basic needs.

=== Esteem needs ===
Esteem is the respect, and admiration of a person, but also &quot;self-respect and respect from others&quot;. Most people need stable esteem, meaning that which is soundly based on real capacity or achievement. Maslow noted two versions of esteem needs. The &quot;lower&quot; version of esteem is the need for respect from others and may include a need for status, recognition, fame, prestige, and attention. The &quot;higher&quot; version of esteem is the need for self-respect, and can include a need for strength, competence, mastery, self-confidence, independence, and freedom. This &quot;higher&quot; version takes guidelines, the &quot;hierarchies are interrelated rather than sharply separated&quot;. This means that esteem and the subsequent levels are not strictly separated; instead, the levels are closely related.

Esteem comes from day-to-day experiences which provide a learning opportunity that allows us to discover ourselves. This is incredibly important for children, which is why giving them &quot;the opportunity to discover they are competent and capable learners&quot; is crucial. To boost this, adults must provide opportunities for children to have successful and positive experiences to give children a greater &quot;sense of self&quot;. Adults, especially parents and educators must create and ensure an environment for children that is supportive and provides them with opportunities that &quot;helps children see themselves as respectable, capable individuals&quot;. It can also be found that &quot;Maslow indicated that the need for respect or reputation is most important for children ... and precedes real self-esteem or dignity&quot;, which reflects the two aspects of esteem: for oneself and others.

=== Cognitive needs ===
It has been suggested that Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs can be extended after esteem needs into two more categories: cognitive needs and aesthetic needs. Cognitive needs crave meaning, information, comprehension and curiosity – this creates a will to learn and attain knowledge.  From an educational viewpoint, Maslow wanted humans to have intrinsic motivation to become educated people. People have cognitive needs such as creativity, foresight, curiosity, and meaning. Individuals who enjoy activities that require deliberation and brainstorming have a greater need for cognition. Individuals who are unmotivated to participate in the activity, on the other hand, have a low demand for cognitive abilities.

=== Aesthetic needs ===
After reaching one&#x27;s cognitive needs, it would progress to aesthetic needs to beautify one&#x27;s life. This would consist of having the ability to appreciate the beauty within the world around one&#x27;s self, on a day-to-day basis. According to Maslow&#x27;s theories, to progress toward Self-Actualization, humans require beautiful imagery or novel and aesthetically pleasing experiences. Humans must immerse themselves in nature&#x27;s splendor while paying close attention to their surroundings and observing them in order to extract the world&#x27;s beauty. One would accomplish this by making their environment pleasant to look at or be around. They might discover personal style choices that they feel represent them and make their environment a place that they fit well into. This higher level of need to connect with nature results in a sense of intimacy with nature and all that is endearing. Aesthetic needs also relate to beautifying oneself. This would consist of improving one&#x27;s physical appearance to ensure its beauty to balance the rest of the body. This is done by making and finding ways one wants to dress and express oneself through personal beauty and grooming standards and ideas.

=== Self-actualization ===

&quot;What a man can be, he must be.” This quotation forms the basis of the perceived need for self-actualization. This level of need refers to the realization of one&#x27;s full potential. Maslow describes this as the desire to accomplish everything that one can, to become the most that one can be. People may have a strong, particular desire to become an ideal parent, succeed athletically, or create paintings, pictures, or inventions. To understand this level of need, a person must not only succeed in the previous needs but master them. Self-actualization can be described as a value-based system when discussing its role in motivation. Self-actualization is understood as the goal or explicit motive, and the previous stages in Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy fall in line to become the step-by-step process by which self-actualization is achievable; an explicit motive is the objective of a reward-based system that is used to intrinsically drive the completion of certain values or goals. Individuals who are motivated to pursue this goal seek and understand how their needs, relationships, and sense of self are expressed through their behavior. Self-actualization needs include:
* Partner acquisition
* Parenting
* Utilizing and developing talents and abilities
* Pursuing goals

=== Transcendence needs ===
Maslow later subdivided the triangle&#x27;s top to include self-transcendence, also known as spiritual needs. Spiritual needs differ from other types of needs in that they can be met on multiple levels. When this need is met, it produces feelings of integrity and raises things to a higher plane of existence. In his later years, Maslow explored a further dimension of motivation, while criticizing his original vision of self-actualization. Maslow tells us that by transcending you have a set of roots in your current culture but you are able to look over it as well and see other viewpoints and ideas. By these later ideas, one finds the fullest realization in giving oneself to something beyond oneself—for example, in altruism or spirituality. He equated this with the desire to reach the infinite. &quot;Transcendence refers to the very highest and most inclusive or holistic levels of human consciousness, behaving and relating, as ends rather than means, to oneself, to significant others, to human beings in general, to other species, to nature, and to the cosmos.&quot;

== Criticism ==
=== Blackfoot influence ===
Maslow&#x27;s early (1938) anthropological research included a fieldtrip to the Blackfoot people (Siksika Nation) in southern Alberta, Canada. Based on his observations of their peaceful and cooperative way of life (in contrast to American society), Maslow concluded that human destructiveness and aggression is largely culturally determined and “most probably a secondary, reactive consequence of thwarting of or threat to the basic human needs”. However, claims have been made that Maslow had failed to acknowledge the influence of the Blackfoot philosophy in developing the hierarchy of needs.

According to Kaufman, while acknowledging that Maslow learned much from the Blackfoot people, “there is nothing in these writings to suggest he borrowed or stole ideas for his hierarchy of needs”. Without wishing to discredit Maslow, Blackfoot elders and scholars have argued that Maslow did not really understand the Blackfoot philosophy. &quot;It is not that Maslow got the hierarchy wrong or upside down, it is rather that he did not understand the circular nature in which all beings in Siksika society are interconnected and integrated. They surround each other and needs are met through these connections&quot;.

=== Self-actualizing people ===
Maslow studied people such as Albert Einstein, Jane Addams, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Baruch Spinoza, rather than mentally ill or neurotic people, writing that &quot;the study of crippled, stunted, immature, and unhealthy specimens can yield only a cripple psychology and a cripple philosophy&quot;.

=== Ranking ===
==== Global ranking ====
In a 1976 review of Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs, little evidence was found for the specific ranking of needs that Maslow described or for the existence of a definite hierarchy at all. This refutation was claimed to be supported by the majority of longitudinal data and cross-sectional studies at the time, with the limited support for Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy criticized due to poor measurement criteria and selection of control groups.

In 1984, the order in which the hierarchy is arranged was criticized as being ethnocentric by Geert Hofstede. In turn, Hofstede&#x27;s work was criticized by others. Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs was argued as failing to illustrate and expand upon the difference between the social and intellectual needs of those raised in individualistic societies and those raised in collectivist societies. The needs and drives of those in individualistic societies tend to be more self-centered than those in collectivist societies, focusing on the improvement of the self, with self-actualization being the apex of self-improvement. In collectivist societies, the needs of acceptance and community will outweigh the needs for freedom and individuality.

Criticisms towards the theory have also been expressed on the lack of consideration towards individualism and collectivism in the context of spirituality.

==== Sex ranking ====
The position and value of sex within Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy have been a source of criticism. Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy places sex in the physiological needs category, alongside food and breathing. Some critics argue that this placement of sex neglects the emotional, familial, and evolutionary implications of sex within the community, although others point out that this critique could apply to all of the basic needs. However, Maslow himself acknowledged that the satisfaction of sexual desire was likely linked to other social motives as well. Furthermore, it is recognized that physiological needs such as sex and hunger can be related to higher-order motivations.

=== Cultural and individual variations ===
Although recent research appears to validate the existence of universal human needs, as well as shared ordering of the way in which people seek and satisfy needs, the exact hierarchy proposed by Maslow is called into question. The most common criticism is the expectation that different individuals, with similar backgrounds and at similar junctures in their respective lives, when faced with the same situation, would end up taking the same decision. Instead of that, a common observation is that humans are driven by a unique set of motivations, and their behavior cannot be reliably predicted based on the Maslowian principles. 

The classification of the higher-order (self-esteem and self-actualization) and lower-order (physiological, safety, and love) needs is not universal and may vary across cultures due to individual differences and availability of resources in the region or geopolitical entity/country.

In a 1997 study, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of a thirteen-item scale showed there were two particularly important levels of needs in the US during the peacetime of 1993 to 1994: survival (physiological and safety) and psychological (love, self-esteem, and self-actualization). In 1991, a retrospective peacetime measure was established and collected during the Persian Gulf War, and US citizens were asked to recall the importance of needs from the previous year. Once again, only two levels of needs were identified; therefore, people have the ability and competence to recall and estimate the importance of needs. For citizens in the Middle East (Egypt and Saudi Arabia), three levels of needs regarding importance and satisfaction surfaced during the 1990 retrospective peacetime. These three levels were completely different from those of US citizens.

Changes regarding the importance and satisfaction of needs from the retrospective peacetime to wartime due to stress varied significantly across cultures (the US vs. the Middle East). For the US citizens, there was only one level of needs, since all needs were considered equally important. With regards to satisfaction of needs during the war, in the US there were three levels: physiological needs, safety needs, and psychological needs (social, self-esteem, and self-actualization). During the war, the satisfaction of physiological needs and safety needs were separated into two independent needs, while during peacetime, they were combined as one. For the people of the Middle East, the satisfaction of needs changed from three levels to two during wartime.

A study of the ordering of needs in Asia found differences between the ordering of lower and higher order needs. For instance, community (related to belongingness and considered a lower order need in Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy) was found to be the highest order need across Asia, followed closely by self-acceptance and growth.

A 1981 study looked at how Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy might vary across age groups. A survey asked participants of varying ages to rate a set number of statements from most important to least important. The researchers found that children had higher physical need scores than the other groups, the love need emerged from childhood to young adulthood, the esteem need was highest among the adolescent group, young adults had the highest self-actualization level, and old age had the highest level of security, it was needed across all levels comparably. The authors argued that this suggested Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy may be limited as a theory for developmental sequence since the sequence of the love need and the self-esteem need should be reversed according to age.

The hierarchy of needs has been criticized from an Islamic point of view.

<text>The president of Tajikistan is the head of state of the Republic of Tajikistan. The president heads the executive branch of the country&#x27;s government and is the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Tajikistan. He is widely considered a dictator.

==History of the presidency==
The first president of Tajikistan was Qahhor Mahkamov, who held the position of First Secretary of the Communist Party of Tajikistan and was appointed President of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic in November 1990. Mahkamov served both as First Secretary and President but was forced to resign in August 1991 due to the unpopularity of his support for the August Coup of 1991 in Moscow and the resulting street demonstrations in Dushanbe. From 1991 to 1992 the post of the president changed hands several times due to the political changes and uncertainty following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and ensuing social unrest and violence in the Tajikistani Civil War. Since 1994, Emomali Rahmon has held the position of the presidency. The presidential elections were last held in 2020. Presidential elections in Tajikistan have consistently been criticized by international observers as unfair and favoring the ruling party.

==Constitutional role==
The president of Tajikistan is the head of the state and the highest ranking chief government official in the country. The president is elected by a national vote and was historically limited to one seven-year term which can only be renewed once, until the abolishment of term limits. The president is also the supreme commander-in-chief of the Tajik National Army.
In addition to the executive office of the president, there is a Security Council that advises the president on matters of national security. As Supreme Commander-in-Chief, he also is entitled to use the Center for the Management of the Armed Forces (opened on National Army Day in 2018), which would serve as the main military command center for the president, similarly to the Russian Armed Forces National Defense Management Center. 

===Executive office===
The office of the president consisting of 5 departments and 24 offices is the executive arm of the president, including, inter alia, the following are the most important ones: 
* Department of the Constitutional Rights of Citizens
* Department of Public Affairs, Information and Cultural Affairs 
* Department of Social Policy 
* Department of Economic Policy

The president also has five state advisors who aide the president on policy issues:

*State Advisor on Economic Issues 
*State Advisor on International Affairs
*State Advisor on Science and Social issues
*State Advisor on Public Affairs Information and Culture and State 
*State Advisor on Defense and Law Enforcement

==Presidential standard==
The standard of the president of the Republic of Tajikistan is the official symbol of the office of president in the country. It was made a legal state symbol in accordance with an amendment to Law No. 192 on July 28, 2006. It was introduced in time for the inauguration ceremony for Emomali Rahmon in his third term as head of state. The standard is a rectangular panel consisting of three horizontally arranged color bars which are similar to the colors on the Flag of Tajikistan. In it, there is a symbolic &quot;Derafsh Kaviani&quot; banner the center, with its upper part having spear, symbolizing the will and power of the authorities for the defense of the country. The banner is four-sided and has four branches inside (which represents the four regions of Tajikistan), while the center depicts a winged lion with a crown and seven stars, which are the basis of the emblem of Tajikistan. The Derafsh Kaviani is embroidered with two gold threads on both sides of the standard.

==Residence==
Since 2008, the Palace of Nations (also called the &quot;Kohi Millat&quot; or the &quot;White House&quot;) has been the official residence of the president of Tajikistan. The president often receives foreign dignitaries and public official at the palace, as well as holds public events at its main hall. Its construction was dedicated to Tajik historic king Ismail Samani. It opened in August 2008, hosting an SCO summit in its first day. The palace is portrayed on the back of a 500 Somoni banknote.

Up until 2008, the presidential residence was located in a different location, in building that was built in 1957 (to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution), and formerly served as the headquarters of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Tajikistan. In the Soviet era, it had hosted dignitaries such as Raul Castro, Ho Chi Minh, Nikita Khrushchev, Leonid Brezhnev, and Boris Yeltsin. In 2017, the building became the temporary office of the Mayor of Dushanbe. It became the presidential residence in 1992. In February 2020, it was announced that the former palace would be demolished.

== Selection process ==
=== Elections ===
The president of Tajikistan is elected for a seven-year term (Exception for Founder of peace and national Unity — Leader of the Nation) using the two-round system; if no candidate receives over 50% of all votes cast, a second round is held between 15 and 31 days later between the two candidates who received the most votes. For the result to be validated, voter turnout must exceed 50%; if it falls below the threshold, fresh elections will be held.

====Latest election====
=== Inauguration ceremony ===
The inauguration ceremony takes place at the Kokhi Somon Palace in Dushanbe. Following the ceremony, a military parade of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Tajikistan is held on Dousti Square. The minister of defence reads the oath of the allegiance to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief during the ceremony before the troops of the National Army march off. A 30-gun salute is fired to mark the occasion. The following years saw inauguration ceremonies held:

* 1994
* 1999 - The ceremony was attended by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
* 18 November 2006
* 16 November 2013
* 30 October 2020 - The ceremony was held amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Tajikistan.

<text>Harry Dean Stanton (July 14, 1926 – September 15, 2017) was an American actor. In a career that spanned more than six decades, Stanton played supporting roles in films including &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; (1967), &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot; (1970), &quot;Dillinger&quot; (1973), &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974), &quot;Alien&quot; (1979), &quot;Escape from New York&quot; (1981), &quot;Christine&quot; (1983), &quot;Repo Man&quot; (1984), &quot;One Magic Christmas&quot; (1985), &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; (1986), &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1988), &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; (1990), &quot;The Straight Story&quot; (1999), &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (1999), &quot;The Man Who Cried&quot; (2000), &quot;Alpha Dog&quot; (2006), &quot;Inland Empire&quot; (2006), &quot;Rango&quot; (2011), &quot;The Avengers&quot; (2012), and &quot;Seven Psychopaths&quot; (2012). He had rare lead roles in &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; (1984) and in &quot;Lucky&quot; (2017).

==Early life==
Stanton was born in West Irvine, Kentucky, to Sheridan Harry Stanton, a tobacco farmer and barber, and Ersel (née Moberly), a cook. His parents divorced when Stanton was in high school; both later remarried.

Stanton had two younger brothers and a younger half-brother. His family had a musical background. Stanton attended Lafayette High School and the University of Kentucky in Lexington where he performed at the Guignol Theatre under the direction of theater director Wallace Briggs, and studied journalism and radio arts. &quot;I could have been a writer,&quot; he told an interviewer for a 2011 documentary, &quot;Harry Dean Stanton: Crossing Mulholland&quot;, in which he sings and plays the harmonica. &quot;I had to decide if I wanted to be a singer or an actor. I was always singing. I thought if I could be an actor, I could do all of it.&quot; Briggs encouraged him to leave the university and become an actor. He studied at the Pasadena Playhouse in Pasadena, California, where his classmates included his friends Tyler MacDuff and Dana Andrews.

During World War II, Stanton served in the United States Navy, including a stint as a cook aboard the USS &quot;LST-970&quot;, a Landing Ship, Tank, during the Battle of Okinawa.

==Career==

Stanton made his first television appearance in 1954 in &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot;. He played Stoneman in the &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot; 1959 episode &quot;Treasure Trail&quot;, credited under Dean Stanton. He made his film debut in 1957 in the Western &quot;Tomahawk Trail&quot;. He appeared (uncredited) as a complaining BAR man at the beginning of the 1959 film &quot;Pork Chop Hill&quot; starring Gregory Peck. Then in 1962, he had a very small part in &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;, portraying one of Charlie Gant&#x27;s (Eli Wallach) gang. The following year he had a minor role as a poetry-reciting beatnik in &quot;The Man from the Diner&#x27;s Club&quot;. Early in his career, he took the name Dean Stanton to avoid confusion with the actor Harry Stanton.

His breakthrough part came with the lead role in Wim Wenders&#x27; &quot;Paris, Texas&quot;. Playwright Sam Shepard, who wrote the film&#x27;s script, had spotted Stanton at a bar in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1983 while both were attending a film festival in that city. The two fell into conversation. &quot;I was telling him I was sick of the roles I was playing,&quot; Stanton recalled in a 1986 interview. &quot;I told him I wanted to play something of some beauty or sensitivity. I had no inkling he was considering me for the lead in his movie.&quot; Not long afterward, Shepard phoned him in Los Angeles to offer Stanton the part of the protagonist, Travis, &quot;a role that called for the actor to remain largely silent ... as a lost, broken soul trying to put his life back together and reunite with his estranged family after having vanished years earlier.&quot;

Stanton appeared in indie and cult films such as &quot;Two-Lane Blacktop&quot; (1971), &quot;Cockfighter&quot; (1974), &quot;Escape from New York&quot; (1981), &quot;Repo Man&quot; (1984), &quot;The Straight Story&quot; (1999), and &quot;Inland Empire&quot; (2006), as well as mainstream Hollywood productions, including &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot;, (1967), &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot; (1970), &quot;Dillinger&quot; (1973), &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974), &quot;Alien&quot; (1979), &quot;The Rose&quot; (1979), &quot;Private Benjamin&quot; (1980), &quot;Young Doctors in Love&quot; (1982), &quot;Christine&quot; (1983), &quot;Red Dawn&quot; (1984), &quot;One Magic Christmas&quot; (1985), &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; (1986), &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1988), &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; (1990), &quot;Down Periscope&quot; (1996), &quot;Fire Down Below&quot; (1997), &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (1999), &quot;The Man Who Cried&quot; (2000), &quot;Alpha Dog&quot; (2006), and &quot;Rango&quot; (2011). He was a favorite actor of the directors Sam Peckinpah, John Milius, David Lynch, and Monte Hellman, and was also close friends with Francis Ford Coppola and Jack Nicholson. He was best man at Nicholson&#x27;s wedding in 1962.

Stanton was a favorite of film critic Roger Ebert, who said that &quot;no movie featuring either Harry Dean Stanton or M. Emmet Walsh in a supporting role can be altogether bad.&quot; However, Ebert later admitted that &quot;Dream a Little Dream&quot; (1989), in which Stanton appeared, was a &quot;clear violation&quot; of this rule.

He had eight appearances between 1958 and 1968 on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, four on the network&#x27;s &quot;Rawhide&quot;, three on &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, two on &quot;Bonanza&quot;, and an episode of &quot;The Rifleman&quot;. 
He played the wrongly accused Lucius Brand (credited as Dean Stanton) in &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; S3 E7 &quot;The Night of the Hangman&quot; (1967). He later had a cameo in &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; (having previously appeared with Jon Cryer in &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; and with Charlie Sheen in &quot;Red Dawn&quot;). Beginning in 2006, Stanton featured as Roman Grant, the manipulative leader/prophet of a polygamous sect on the HBO television series &quot;Big Love&quot;.

Stanton also occasionally toured nightclubs as a singer and guitarist, playing mostly country-inflected cover tunes. He appeared in the Dwight Yoakam music video for &quot;Sorry You Asked&quot;, portrayed a cantina owner in a Ry Cooder video for &quot;Get Rhythm&quot;, and participated in the video for Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Dreamin&#x27; of You&quot;. He worked with a number of musical artists, Dylan, Art Garfunkel, and Kris Kristofferson among them, and played harmonica on The Call&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;Let the Day Begin&quot;.

In 2010, Stanton appeared in an episode of the TV series &quot;Chuck&quot;, reprising his role in the 1984 film &quot;Repo Man&quot;. In 2011, the Lexington Film League created an annual festival, the Harry Dean Stanton Fest, to honor Stanton in the city where he spent much of his adolescence. In 2012, he had a brief cameo in &quot;The Avengers&quot; and a key role in the action-comedy &quot;Seven Psychopaths&quot;. He also appeared in the Arnold Schwarzenegger action film &quot;The Last Stand&quot; (2013). Stanton was the subject of a 2013 documentary, &quot;Harry Dean Stanton: Partly Fiction&quot;, directed by Sophie Huber and featuring film clips, interviews with collaborators (including Wenders, Shepard, Kris Kristofferson, and David Lynch), and Stanton&#x27;s singing.

In 2017, he appeared in &quot;Twin Peaks: The Return&quot;, a continuation of David Lynch&#x27;s 1990–91 television series. Stanton reprised his role as Carl Rodd from &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot;. His last on-screen appearances are as a sheriff in &quot;Frank &amp; Ava&quot; and a starring role as a 90-year-old man nicknamed &quot;Lucky&quot; and his struggles against encroaching old age in &quot;Lucky&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Stanton was never married, though he had a short relationship with actress Rebecca De Mornay in 1981–82. &quot;I might have had two or three [kids] out of marriage,&quot; he once told the Associated Press. &quot;But that&#x27;s another story.&quot;

Stanton died aged 91 on September 15, 2017, from heart failure, at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. A small marker containing his cremated remains was established in a cemetery in Nicholasville, Kentucky.

==In popular culture==
Stanton was celebrated in &quot;I Want That Man&quot;, a 1989 song recorded by Deborah Harry which begins with the line &quot;I want to dance with Harry Dean&quot;. In her memoir, Harry writes that Stanton heard the song and arranged to meet her at a club in London.

Stanton is mentioned in the 2013 song &quot;Christmas in L.A.&quot; by The Killers. The song&#x27;s music video begins with a dialogue between the voices of Owen Wilson and Harry Dean Stanton.

Pop Will Eat Itself released a track titled &quot;Harry Dean Stanton&quot; on their album &quot;The Looks or the Lifestyle?&quot; His lead role in the film &quot;Paris, Texas&quot;, was memorialized in Hayes Carll&#x27;s 2019 song &quot;American Dream&quot; with the lyrics, &quot;like Harry Dean Stanton on a drive-in screen, a tumbleweed blowing through Paris, Texas, he fell down into the American dream.&quot;

Ian McNabb recorded the song &quot;Harry Dean Stanton&quot; on his album &quot;Utopian&quot;, released in January 2021. McNabb noted the following about the track: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know too much about him and didn&#x27;t really want to because I knew I had to write a song using his name as the title, so I wrote these lyrics for and around him – I imagined what it must be like to be him – while dropping some of my own experiences into the narrative. I was lurking around Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot; and &quot;Lenny Bruce&quot; – I wanted that atmosphere. I&#x27;ve never claimed to be original.&quot;

<text>Almon Brown Strowger (; February 11, 1839 – May 26, 1902) was an American inventor who gave his name to the Strowger switch, an electromechanical telephone exchange technology that his invention and patent inspired.

== Early years ==

Strowger was born in Penfield, New York, near Rochester, the grandson of the second settler and first miller in Penfield. Little is known about his early life. It is said that if his mother gave her children a task, Strowger and his brothers would often try to devise a machine to do the task for them. He taught school in Penfield for a time. 

In October 1861, he enlisted as a Musician in Company A, 8th New York Cavalry Regiment, to fight in the American Civil War. He was promoted to Sergeant and Chief Trumpeter of the regiment in February 1864, and ended the war as a Second Lieutenant. He was wounded in action at the Third Battle of Winchester in 1864, and discharged later that year. 

After the Civil War, it appears he first became a country school teacher before he became an undertaker. He is variously attributed as living in El Dorado, Kansas, or Topeka, Kansas, and finally Kansas City, Missouri. It is not clear where his idea of an automatic telephone exchange was originally conceived, but his patent application identifies him as being a resident of Kansas City, Missouri, on March 10, 1891.

== Rotary dialing ==
A commonly told story holds that Strowger believed that his undertaking business was losing clients to a competitor whose wife was a local telephone operator and was preventing telephone calls from being routed to Strowger&#x27;s business and re-routing them to her husband&#x27;s business instead, following his discovery in the newspaper that a friend&#x27;s funeral was being handled elsewhere. Motivated to remove the intermediary operator, he invented the first automatic telephone exchange in 1889; he received its patent in 1891. It is reported that he initially constructed a model of his invention from a round collar box and some straight pins.

== Finances ==

While he may have come up with the idea, he was not alone in his endeavors and sought the assistance of his nephew William and others with a knowledge of electricity and money to realise his concepts. With this help the Strowger Automatic Telephone Exchange Company was formed and it installed and opened the first commercial exchange in (his then home town of) La Porte, Indiana, on November 3, 1892, with about 75 subscribers and capacity for 99. He married Susan A. (1846–1921) from Massachusetts in 1897 as his second wife. Strowger sold his patents to his associates in 1896 for $1,800 (about $59,000 in 2021) and sold his share in the Automatic Electric Company for $10,000 (about $330,000 in 2021) in 1898. His patents were subsequently sold to Bell Systems for $2.5 million in 1916 (about $63,000,000 in 2021).

The company&#x27;s engineers continued development of Strowger&#x27;s designs and submitted several patents in the names of its employees. It also underwent several name changes. Strowger himself seems to have not taken part in this further development. He subsequently moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, and appears to have returned to being an undertaker, as H.P. Bussey Funeral Home records report an unidentified body being moved &quot;for Mr. Strowger&quot; in December 1899. The same funeral home subsequently buried Strowger himself. Strowger was a man of some wealth at his death and was reported as owning at least a city block of property.

== Death ==

He died, aged 63, of an aneurysm after suffering from anemia, at St. Petersburg, Pinellas County, Florida; he was buried in Greenwood Cemetery the next day. His grave is marked with the traditional white headstone with an inscription that reads: &quot;Lieut. A.B. Strowger, Co. A, 8 NY Cav.&quot;

He was survived by his widow Susan A. Strowger (1846–1921). After her death in Tampa, Florida, on April 14, 1921, her obituary appeared in the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot;, claiming she had additional &quot;revolutionary&quot; Strowger designs, but she had refused to make them public while she was alive because only others would profit from her husband&#x27;s designs. She had claimed that her husband had only received $10,000 for his invention, when he should have received $1,000,000.

== Legacy ==

A bronze plaque, to commemorate his invention, was placed on his grave in 1945 by telephone company officials. Strowger was admitted to the hall of fame of the U.S. Independent Telephone Association (now called the USTA) in 1965. Apart from his invention, his name has also been given to a locomotive and a company business award.

In 2003, the Verizon Foundation awarded $4500 to Pinellas Heritage, Inc. and the Pinellas Genealogy Society in Strowger&#x27;s memory. The funds were used to develop a website to impart the history of the cemetery where Strowger is buried, and to restore two Civil War memorials. The Greenwood Cemetery project won an organization achievement award from the Florida Trust for Historic Preservation.

<text>John Smith (baptized 6 January 1580 – 21 June 1631) was an English soldier, explorer, colonial governor, admiral of New England, and author. Following his return to England from a life as a soldier of fortune and as a slave, he played an important role in the establishment of the colony at Jamestown, Virginia, the first permanent English settlement in North America, in the early 17th century. He was a leader of the Virginia Colony between September 1608 and August 1609, and he led an exploration along the rivers of Virginia and the Chesapeake Bay, during which he became the first English explorer to map the Chesapeake Bay area. Later, he explored and mapped the coast of New England. He was knighted for his services to Sigismund Báthory, Prince of Transylvania, and his friend Mózes Székely.

Jamestown was established on May 14, 1607. Smith trained the first settlers to work at farming and fishing, thus saving the colony from early devastation. He publicly stated, &quot;He that will not work, shall not eat&quot;, alluding to 2 Thessalonians 3:10. Harsh weather, a lack of food and water, the surrounding swampy wilderness, and attacks from Native Americans almost destroyed the colony. With Smith&#x27;s leadership, however, Jamestown survived and eventually flourished. Smith was forced to return to England after being injured by an accidental explosion of gunpowder in a canoe.

Smith&#x27;s books and maps were important in encouraging and supporting English colonization of the New World. Having named the region of New England, he stated: &quot;Here every man may be master and owner of his owne labour and land. ...If he have nothing but his hands, he may...by industries quickly grow rich.&quot; Smith died in London in 1631.

==Early life==
Smith&#x27;s exact birth date is unclear. He was baptized on 6 January 1580 at Willoughby, near Alford, Lincolnshire, where his parents rented a farm from Lord Willoughby. He claimed descent from the ancient Smith family of Cuerdley, Lancashire, and was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School, Louth, from 1592 to 1595. Smith was initially set on a path to apprentice with a merchant in the Hanseatic League merchant seaport of King&#x27;s Lynn in Norfolk. However, he found himself ill-suited for the monotonous life of a tradesman and the confines of a counting house. Peter Firstbrook, the biographer of John Smith, posits that Smith&#x27;s brief stint as an apprentice to a merchant in the seaport of King&#x27;s Lynn sparked his adventurous spirit. 

Smith set off to sea at age 16 after his father died. He served as a mercenary in the army of Henry IV of France against the Spaniards, fighting for Dutch independence from King Philip II of Spain. He then went to the Mediterranean where he engaged in trade and piracy, and later fought against the Ottoman Turks in the Long Turkish War. He was promoted to cavalry captain while fighting for the Austrian Habsburgs in Hungary in the campaign of Michael the Brave in 1600 and 1601. After the death of Michael the Brave, he fought for Radu Șerban in Wallachia against Ottoman vassal Ieremia Movilă. Smith reputedly killed and beheaded three Ottoman challengers in single-combat duels, for which he was knighted by the Prince of Transylvania and given a horse and a coat of arms showing three Turks&#x27; heads.

In 1602 he was wounded in a skirmish with the Crimean Tatars, captured, and, taken to a slave market, and then sold. He was sent as an enslaved gift to a woman in Constantinople (Istanbul), Charatza Tragabigzanda, who sent him to perform agricultural work and to be converted to Islam in Rostov. During one of the regular beatings his slavemaster gave him, Smith killed the slavemaster and escaped from Ottoman territory into Muscovy. Smith traveled through the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Europe, and Africa, reaching England in 1604. 

==In Jamestown==

In 1606, Smith became involved with the Virginia Company of London&#x27;s plan to colonize Virginia for profit, and King James had already granted a charter. The expedition set sail on &quot;Discovery&quot;, &quot;Susan Constant&quot;, and &quot;Godspeed&quot; on 20 December 1606. His page was a 12-year-old boy named Samuel Collier, or &quot;Dutch Samuel&quot;.

During the voyage, Smith was charged with mutiny, and Captain Christopher Newport (in charge of the three ships) had planned to execute him. These events happened approximately when the expedition stopped in the Canary Islands for resupply of water and provisions. Smith was under arrest for most of the trip. However, they landed at Cape Henry on 26 April 1607 and unsealed orders from the Virginia Company designating Smith as one of the leaders of the new colony, thus sparing him from the gallows.

By the summer of 1607, the colonists were still living in temporary housing. The search for a suitable site ended on 14 May 1607 when Captain Edward Maria Wingfield, president of the council, chose the Jamestown site as the location for the colony. After the four-month ocean trip, their food stores were sufficient only for each to have a cup or two of grain-meal per day, and someone died almost every day due to swampy conditions and widespread disease. By September, more than 60 had died of the 104 who left England.

In early January 1608, nearly 100 new settlers arrived with Captain Newport on the First Supply, but the village was set on fire through carelessness. That winter, the James River froze over, and the settlers were forced to live in the burned ruins. During this time, they wasted much of the three months that Newport and his crew were in port loading their ships with iron pyrite (fool&#x27;s gold). Food supplies ran low, although the Native Americans brought some food, and Smith wrote that &quot;more than half of us died&quot;. Smith spent the following summer exploring Chesapeake Bay waterways and producing a map that was of great value to Virginia explorers for more than a century.

In October 1608, Newport brought a second shipment of supplies along with 70 new settlers, including the first women. Some German, Polish, and Slovak craftsmen also arrived, but they brought no food supplies. Newport brought a list of counterfeit Virginia Company orders which angered Smith greatly. One of the orders was to crown Indian leader Powhatan emperor and give him a fancy bedstead. The Company wanted Smith to pay for Newport&#x27;s voyage with pitch, tar, sawed boards, soap ashes, and glass.

After that, Smith tried to obtain food from the local Natives, but it required threats of military force for them to comply. Smith discovered that there were those among both the settlers and the Natives who were planning to take his life, and he was warned about the plan by Pocahontas. He called a meeting and threatened those who were not working &quot;that he that will not work shall not eat.&quot; After that, the situation improved and the settlers worked with more industry.

===Encounter with the Powhatan tribe===

Native Americans led by Opechancanough captured Smith in December 1607 while he was seeking food along the Chickahominy River, and they took him to meet Chief Powhatan (Opechancanough&#x27;s older brother) at Werowocomoco, the main village of the Powhatan Confederacy. The village was on the north shore of the York River about north of Jamestown and downstream from where the river forms from the Pamunkey River and the Mattaponi River at West Point, Virginia. Smith was removed to the hunters&#x27; camp, where Opechancanough and his men feasted him and otherwise treated him like an honoured guest. Protocol demanded that Opechancanough inform Chief Powhatan of Smith&#x27;s capture, but the paramount chief also was on a hunt and therefore unreachable. Absent interpreters or any other means of effectively interviewing the Englishman, Opechancanough summoned his seven highest-ranking kwiocosuk, or shamans, and convened an elaborate, three-day divining ritual to determine whether Smith&#x27;s intentions were friendly. Finding it a good time to leave camp, Opechancanough took Smith and went in search of his brother, at one point visiting the Rappahannock tribe who had been attacked by a European ship captain a few years earlier.

In 1860, Boston businessman and historian Charles Deane was the first scholar to question specific details of Smith&#x27;s writings. Smith&#x27;s version of events is the only source and skepticism has increasingly been expressed about its veracity. One reason for such doubt is that, despite having published two earlier books about Virginia, Smith&#x27;s earliest surviving account of his rescue by Pocahontas dates from 1616, nearly 10 years later, in a letter entreating Queen Anne to treat Pocahontas with dignity. The time gap in publishing his story raises the possibility that Smith may have exaggerated or invented the event to enhance Pocahontas&#x27; image. However, professor Leo Lemay of the University of Delaware points out that Smith&#x27;s earlier writing was primarily geographical and ethnographic in nature and did not dwell on his personal experiences; hence, there was no reason for him to write down the story until this point.

Henry Brooks Adams attempted to debunk Smith&#x27;s claims of heroism. He said that Smith&#x27;s recounting of the story of Pocahontas had been progressively embellished, made up of &quot;falsehoods of an effrontery seldom equaled in modern times&quot;. There is consensus among historians that Smith tended to exaggerate, but his account is consistent with the basic facts of his life. Some have suggested that Smith believed that he had been rescued, when he had in fact been involved in a ritual intended to symbolize his death and rebirth as a member of the tribe. David A. Price notes in &quot;Love and Hate in Jamestown&quot; that this is purely speculation, since little is known of Powhatan rituals and there is no evidence for any similar rituals among other Native American tribes. Smith told a similar story in &quot;True Travels&quot; (1630) of having been rescued by the intervention of a young girl after being captured in 1602 by Turks in Hungary. Karen Kupperman suggests that he &quot;presented those remembered events from decades earlier&quot; when telling the story of Pocahontas. Whatever really happened, the encounter initiated a friendly relationship between the Native Americans and colonists near Jamestown. As the colonists expanded farther, some of the tribes felt that their lands were threatened, and conflicts arose again.

In 1608, Pocahontas is said to have saved Smith a second time. Chief Powhatan invited Smith and some other colonists to Werowocomoco on friendly terms, but Pocahontas came to the hut where they were staying and warned them that Powhatan was planning to kill them. They stayed on their guard and the attack never came. Also in 1608, Polish craftsmen were brought to the colony to help it develop. Smith wrote that two Poles rescued him when he was attacked by an Algonquian tribesman.

===Smith&#x27;s explorations of the Chesapeake Bay===
In the summer of 1608, Smith left Jamestown to explore the Chesapeake Bay region and search for badly needed food, covering an estimated . These explorations are commemorated in the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail, established in 2006. In his absence, Smith left his friend Matthew Scrivener as governor in his place, a young gentleman adventurer from Sibton Suffolk who was related by marriage to the Wingfield family, but he was not capable of leading the people. Smith was elected president of the local council in September 1608.

===Influx of settlers===
Some of the settlers eventually wanted Smith to abandon Jamestown, but he refused. Some deserted to the Indian villages, but Powhatan&#x27;s people also followed Smith&#x27;s law of &quot;he who works not, eats not&quot;. This lasted &quot;till they were near starved indeed&quot;, in Smith&#x27;s words, and they returned home.

In the spring of 1609, Jamestown was beginning to prosper, with many dwellings built, acres of land cleared, and much other work done. Then in April, they experienced an infestation of rats, along with dampness which destroyed all their stored corn. They needed food badly and Smith sent a large group of settlers to fish and others to gather shellfish downriver. They came back without food and were willing enough to take the meager rations offered them. This angered Smith and he ordered them to trade their guns and tools for fruit from the Indians and ordered everyone to work or be banished from the fort.

The weeks-long emergency was relieved by the arrival of an unexpected ship captained by Samuel Argall. He had items of food and wine which Smith bought on credit. Argall also brought news that the Virginia Company of London was being reorganized and was sending more supplies and settlers to Jamestown, along with Lord De la Warr to become the new governor.
In a May 1609 voyage to Virginia, Virginia Company treasurer Sir Thomas Smith arranged for about 500 colonists to come along, including women and children. A fleet of nine ships set sail. One sank in a storm soon after leaving the harbour, and the &quot;Sea Venture&quot; wrecked on the Bermuda Islands with flotilla admiral Sir George Somers aboard. They finally made their way to Jamestown in May 1610 after building the &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Patience&quot; to take most of the passengers and crew of the &quot;Sea Venture&quot; off Bermuda, with the new governor Thomas Gates on board.

In August 1609, Smith was quite surprised to see more than 300 new settlers arrive, which did not go well for him. London was sending new settlers with no real planning or logistical support. Then in May 1610, Somers and Gates finally arrived with 150 people from the &quot;Sea Venture&quot;. Gates soon found that there was not enough food to support all in the colony and decided to abandon Jamestown. As their boats were leaving the Jamestown area, they met a ship carrying the new governor Lord De la Warr, who ordered them back to Jamestown. Somers returned to Bermuda with the &quot;Patience&quot; to gather more food for Jamestown but died there. The &quot;Patience&quot; then sailed for England instead of Virginia, captained by his nephew.

Smith was severely injured by a gunpowder explosion in his canoe, and he sailed to England for treatment in mid-October 1609. He never returned to Virginia. Colonists continued to die from various illnesses and disease, with an estimated 150 surviving that winter out of 500 residents. The Virginia Company, however, continued to finance and transport settlers to sustain Jamestown. For the next five years, Governors Gates and Sir Thomas Dale continued to keep strict discipline, with Sir Thomas Smith in London attempting to find skilled craftsmen and other settlers to send.

==New England==

In 1614, Smith returned to America in a voyage to the coasts of Maine and Massachusetts Bay. He named the region &quot;New England&quot;. The commercial purpose was to take whales for fins and oil and to seek out mines of gold or copper, but both of these proved impractical so the voyage turned to collecting fish and furs to defray the expense. Most of the crew spent their time fishing, while Smith and eight others took a small boat on a coasting expedition during which he traded rifles for 11,000 beaver skins and 100 each of martins and otters.

Smith collected a ship&#x27;s cargo worth of &quot;Furres… traine Oile and Cor-fish&quot; and returned to England. The expedition&#x27;s second vessel under the command of Thomas Hunt stayed behind and captured a number of Indians as slaves, including Squanto of the Patuxet. Smith was convinced that Hunt&#x27;s actions were directed at him; by inflaming the local population, Smith said, he could &quot;prevent that intent I had to make a plantation there&quot;, keeping the country in &quot;obscuritie&quot; so that Hunt and a few merchants could monopolize it. According to Smith, Hunt had taken his maps and notes of the area to defeat&#x27;s Smith&#x27;s settlement plans. He could not believe that Hunt was driven by greed since there was &quot;little private gaine&quot; to be gotten; Hunt &quot;sold those silly Salvages for Rials of eight.&quot;

Smith published a map in 1616 based on the expedition which was the first to bear the label &quot;New England&quot;, though the Indian place names were replaced by the names of English cities at the request of Prince Charles. The settlers of Plymouth Colony adopted the name that Smith gave to that area, and other place names on the map survive today, such as the Charles River (marked as The River Charles) and Cape Ann (Cape Anna).
Smith made two attempts in 1614 and 1615 to return to the same coast. On the first trip, a storm dismasted his ship. In the second attempt, he was captured by French pirates off the coast of the Azores. He escaped after weeks of captivity and made his way back to England, where he published an account of his two voyages as &quot;A Description of New England&quot;. He remained in England for the rest of his life.

Smith compared his experiences in Virginia with his observations of New England and offered a theory of why some English colonial projects had failed. He noted that the French had been able to monopolize trade in a very short time, even in areas nominally under English control. The people inhabiting the coasts from Maine to Cape Cod had &quot;large corne fields, and great troupes of well proportioned people&quot;, but the French had obtained everything that they had to offer in trade within six weeks. This was due to the fact that the French had created a great trading network which they could exploit, and the English had not cultivated these relations. Where once there was inter-tribal warfare, the French had created peace in the name of the fur trade. Former enemies such as the Massachuset and the Abenaki &quot;are all friends, and have each trade with other, so farre as they have society on each others frontiers.&quot;

Smith believed that it was too late to reverse this reality even with diplomacy, and that what was needed was military force. He suggested that English adventurers should rely on his own experience in wars around the world and his experience in New England where his few men could engage in &quot;silly encounters&quot; without injury or long term hostility. He also compared the experience of the Spaniards in determining how many armed men were necessary to effect Indian compliance.

==Death and burial==
John Smith died on 21 June 1631 in London. He was buried in 1633 in the south aisle of Saint Sepulchre-without-Newgate Church, Holborn Viaduct, London. The church is the largest parish church in the City of London, dating from 1137. Captain Smith is commemorated in the south wall of the church by a stained glass window.

==Legacy==
===New Hampshire===
The Captain John Smith Monument currently lies in disrepair off the coast of New Hampshire on Star Island, part of the Isles of Shoals. The original monument was built in 1864 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Smith&#x27;s visit to what he named Smith&#x27;s Isles. It was a series of square granite slabs atop one another, with a small granite pillar at the top (see adjacent image). The pillar featured three carved faces, representing the severed heads of three Turks that Smith lopped off in combat during his stint as a soldier in Transylvania.

In 1914, the New Hampshire Society of Colonial Wars partially restored and rededicated the monument for the 300th anniversary celebration of his visit. The monument had weathered so badly in the harsh coastal winters that the inscription in the granite had worn away. Contemporary newspapers reported dedication of &quot;a bronze tablet&quot; honouring Smith, and dedication of the Tucke Monument.

In 2014, a new monument honouring Smith was dedicated at Rye Harbor State Park, an 18-ton obelisk measuring &quot;&quot;—in commemoration of the year 1614; —in height.

Many critics judge Smith&#x27;s character and credibility as an author based solely on his description of Pocahontas saving his life from the hand of Powhatan. Most of the scepticism results from the differences between his narratives. His earliest text is &quot;A True Relation of Virginia&quot;, submitted for publication in 1608, the year after his experiences in Jamestown. The second was &quot;The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles&quot;, which was published in 1624. The publication of letters, journals, and pamphlets from the colonists was regulated by the companies that sponsored the voyage, in that the communications must go &quot;directly to the company&quot; because no one was to &quot;write any letter of anything that may discourage others&quot;. Smith violated this regulation by first publishing &quot;A True Relation&quot; as an unknown author. Leo Lemay theorizes that the editor of &quot;The Generall Historie&quot; might have cut out &quot;references to the Indians&#x27; hostility, to bickering among the leaders of Virginia Company, and to the early supposed mutiny&quot; of Smith on the voyage to Virginia.

The Pocahontas episode is subject to the most scrutiny by critics, for it is missing from &quot;A True Relation&quot; but it does appear in &quot;The Generall Historie&quot;. According to Lemay, important evidence of Smith&#x27;s credibility is the fact that &quot;no one in Smith&#x27;s day ever expressed doubt&quot; about the story&#x27;s veracity, and many people who would have known the truth &quot;were in London in 1616 when Smith publicised the story in a letter to the queen&quot;, including Pocahontas herself.

Smith focuses heavily on Indians in all of his works concerning the New World. His relationship with the Powhatan tribe was an important factor in preserving the Jamestown colony from sharing the presumed fate of the Roanoke Colony.

===Promoter of North American colonization===
One of Smith&#x27;s main incentives in writing about his New World experiences and observances was to promote English colonization. Lemay claims that many promotional writers sugar-coated their depictions of America in order to heighten its appeal, but he argues that Smith was not one to exaggerate the facts. He argues that Smith was very straightforward with his readers about both the dangers and the possibilities of colonization. Instead of proclaiming that there was an abundance of gold in the New World, as many writers did, Smith illustrated that there was abundant monetary opportunity in the form of industry. Lemay argues that no motive except wealth would attract potential colonists away from &quot;their ease and humours at home&quot;. &quot;Therefore, he presented in his writings actual industries that could yield significant capital within the New World: fishing, farming, shipbuilding, and fur trading&quot;.

Smith insists, however, that only hard workers would be able to reap the benefits of wealth which the New World afforded. He did not understate the dangers and toil associated with colonization. He declared that only those with a strong work ethic would be able to &quot;live and succeed in America&quot; in the face of such dangers.

===Additional works===
&quot;A Map of Virginia&quot; is focused centrally on the observations that Smith made about the Native Americans, particularly regarding their religion and government. This specific focus would have been Smith&#x27;s way of adapting to the New World by assimilating the best parts of their culture and incorporating them into the colony. &quot;A Map of Virginia&quot; was not just a pamphlet discussing the observations that Smith made, but also a map which Smith had drawn himself, to help make the Americas seem more domestic. As Lemay remarks, &quot;maps tamed the unknown, reduced it to civilisation and harnessed it for Western consciousness,&quot; promoting Smith&#x27;s central theme of encouraging the settlement of America. Many &quot;naysayers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century&quot; have made the argument that Smith&#x27;s maps were not reliable because he &quot;lacked a formal education in cartography&quot;. That allegation, however, was proved false by the fact that Smith was a &quot;master in his chosen fields of experience&quot;.

&quot;The Proceedings of the English Colony In Virginia&quot; was a compilation of other writings; it narrates the colony&#x27;s history from December 1609 to the summer of 1610, and Smith left the colony in October 1609 due to a gunpowder accident. The writing style of &quot;The Proceedings&quot; is thought to be better constructed than &quot;A Map of Virginia&quot;.

==In popular culture==

John Smith was honoured on two of the three stamps of the Jamestown Exposition Issue held 26 April – 1 December 1907 at Norfolk, Virginia to commemorate the founding of the Jamestown settlement. The 1-cent John Smith, inspired by the Simon de Passe engraving of the explorer was used for the 1-cent postcard rate. The 2-cent Jamestown landing stamp paid the first-class domestic rate. 
Captain Smith has featured in popular media several times during the 20th and 21st century.
* Smith was portrayed by Anthony Dexter in the 1953 independent low-budget film &quot;Captain John Smith and Pocahontas&quot;.
* A fictionalized version of Smith appears in James A. Michener&#x27;s 1978 novel &quot;Chesapeake&quot;.
* Smith is one of the main characters in Disney&#x27;s 1995 animated film &quot;Pocahontas&quot; and its 1998 straight-to-video sequel &quot;Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World&quot;. He is voiced by Mel Gibson in the first movie and by his younger brother Donal Gibson in the sequel.
* Smith and Pocahontas are central characters in the 2005 Terrence Malick film &quot;The New World&quot;, in which he was portrayed by Colin Farrell.
* Country singer Blake Shelton played the Disney version in an unaired &quot;Cut for Time&quot; sketch on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.
* In &quot;A Different Flesh&quot; by Harry Turtledove, an anthology set in an alternate timeline where the New World is inhabited by &quot;Homo erectus&quot; and Pleistocene megafauna, John Smith is mentioned as having been killed by &#x27;sims&#x27; shortly after the establishment of Jamestown in Virginia.

<text>Freedom of information laws allow access by the general public to data held by national governments and, where applicable, by state and local governments. The emergence of freedom of information legislation was a response to increasing dissatisfaction with the secrecy surrounding government policy development and decision making. In recent years Access to Information Act has also been used. They establish a &quot;right-to-know&quot; legal process by which requests may be made for government-held information, to be received freely or at minimal cost, barring standard exceptions. Also variously referred to as open records, or sunshine laws (in the United States), governments are typically bound by a duty to publish and promote openness. In many countries there are constitutional guarantees for the right of access to information, but these are usually unused if specific support legislation does not exist. Additionally, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16 has a target to ensure public access to information and the protection of fundamental freedoms as a means to ensure accountable, inclusive and just institutions.

==Introduction==

Over 100 countries around the world have implemented some form of freedom of information legislation. Sweden&#x27;s Freedom of the Press Act of 1766 is the oldest in the world.

Most freedom of information laws exclude the private sector from their jurisdiction thus information held by the private sector cannot be accessed as a legal right. This limitation has serious implications because the private sector performs many functions which were previously the domain of the public sector. As a result, information that was previously public is now within the private sector, and the private contractors cannot be forced to disclose information.

Other countries are working towards introducing such laws, and many regions of countries with national legislation have local laws. For example, all U.S. states have laws governing access to public documents belonging to the state and local taxing entities. Additionally, the U.S. Freedom of Information Act governs record management of documents in the possession of the federal government.

A related concept is open meetings legislation, which allows access to government meetings, not just to the records of them. In many countries, privacy or data protection laws may be part of the freedom of information legislation; the concepts are often closely tied together in political discourse.

A basic principle behind most freedom of information legislation is that the burden of proof falls on the body &quot;asked&quot; for information, not the person &quot;asking&quot; for it. The person making the request does not usually have to give an explanation for their actions, but if the information is not disclosed a valid reason has to be given.

In 2015 The UNESCO General Conference voted to designate 28 Sep as “International Day for the Universal Access to Information” or, as it is more commonly known, Access to Information Day. The date had previously been celebrated as “Right to Know Day” since 2002. The UNESCO resolution recommends approval by the UN General Assembly.
 On 15 October 2019, the UN General Assembly adopted by consensus resolution A/RES/74/5 proclaiming 28 September as the International Day for Universal Access to Information.

==Legislation by country==
===Albania===

In Albania, the constitution of 1998 guarantees the right of access to information; the legislation for supporting this is Law no. 119/2014 &quot;On the right to information&quot; (Ligji nr. 119/2014 &quot;Për të drejtën e informimit&quot;). The law regulates the right of access to information being produced or held by public sector. The rules contained in this law are designated to ensure the public access to information, in the framework of assuming the rights and freedoms of the individual in practice, as well as establishing views on the state and society situation. This law aims also at encouraging integrity, transparency and accountability of the public sector bodies. Every person shall, where deemed that the rights provided for in this law have been violated, be entitled to file a complaint administratively to the Information and Data Protection Commissioner&#x27;s Office.

===Argentina===
In Argentina, the Access to public information Act (Ley 27.275) was adopted in 2016.

===Armenia===

The Law on Freedom of Information was unanimously approved by the Parliament on 23 September 2003 and went into force in November 2003.

===Australia===
In Australia, the was passed at the federal level in 1982, applying to all &quot;ministers, departments and public authorities&quot; of the Commonwealth. The act was amended in 2010 under the Rudd Government, establishing the government office of the information commissioner, to further promote freedom of information.

There is similar legislation in all states and territories:
* Australian Capital Territory, the 
* New South Wales, the 
* Northern Territory, the 
* Queensland, the 
* South Australia, the 
* Tasmania, the 
* Victoria, the 
* Western Australia, the 

=== Austria ===
&quot;Austria’s government has frequently been criticized for inadequate transparency. Official secrecy remains enshrined in the constitution, and Austria’s overall legal framework on access to information is weak&quot; writes the NGO Freedom House in its 2022 and 2023 reports. Reporters without Borders (RSF): &quot;In Austria, press freedom has been undermined by various political pressures or restrictions on access to information.&quot;

In the context of a newly proposed public access law that has yet to be passed by parliament, Transparency International writes: &quot;More than 110 countries have already created freedom of information – Nonsense that this should not be possible in Austria.&quot;

===Azerbaijan===

In Azerbaijan, a Law on Access to Information was approved in 2005. It has gone into effect. Previously in 1998 there was accepted Law on Freedom on Information, but the Law of 2005 provided more detailed and secured regulation for access to official information.

===Bangladesh===
On 21 October 2008, the Caretaker Government of Bangladesh issued in the Bangladesh Gazette the Right to Information Ordinance (No. 50 of 2008), based loosely on the Indian Right to Information Act, 2005. The Ordinance was passed by the current government of Bangladesh in the first session of this parliament on 29 March 2009. The A2i programme is a part of the Vision 2021, a political manifesto of the Bangladesh Awami League party before winning the National Elections of 2008.

===Belgium===
Article 32 of the Constitution was amended in 1993 to include a right of access to documents held by the government.

===Belize===
In Belize, the was passed in 1998 was amended in 2000 and is currently in force, though a governmental commission noted that &quot;not much use has been made of the Act&quot;.

===Bhutan===
The National Assembly of Bhutan passed an RTI Bill in February 2014. Its purpose is to curb corruption by providing the public with the right to access information.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===

Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) was the first country in the Balkan region to adopt a Freedom of Information Act. or FOIA – was adopted by the Parliament Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 17 November 2000. Both federal entities – the Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina – passed freedom of information laws in 2001, the and respectively.

The FOIA Act changed on the BiH state level two times. The first alteration was passed in 2006, enabling stronger legal protection within the framework of administrative law of BiH. The second alteration was passed in December 2009, which enforced legal penalties for prescribed violations.

===Brazil===

In Brazil, the Article 5, XXXIII, of the Constitution sets that &quot;everyone shall have the right to receive information of his own interest or of public interest from public entities, which shall be given within the time prescribed by law&quot;. Also, article 22 of the Federal law nº 8.159/1991 grants the right to &quot;full access to public documents&quot;.
A statute passed in 2011 and that will enter into force in 2012 (Federal Law 12.527/2011, promulgated on 28 November 2011) regulates the manner and the timetable for the information to be given by the State.

===Bulgaria===

In Bulgaria, the was passed in 2000, following a 1996 recommendation from the Constitutional Court to implement such a law.

===Canada===

In Canada, the allows citizens to demand records from federal bodies. The act came into force in 1983, under the Pierre Trudeau government, permitting Canadians to retrieve information from government files, establishing what information could be accessed, mandating timelines for response. This is enforced by the Information Commissioner of Canada.

There is also a complementary that was introduced in 1983. The purpose of the &quot;Privacy Act&quot; is to extend the present laws of Canada that protect the privacy of individuals with respect to personal information about themselves held by a federal government institution and that provide individuals with a right of access to that information. It is a Crown copyright. Complaints for possible violations of the Act may be reported to the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.

Canadian access to information laws distinguish between access to records generally and access to records that contain personal information about the person making the request. Subject to exceptions, individuals have a right of access to records that contain their own personal information under the &quot;Privacy Act&quot; but the general public does not have a right of access to records that contain personal information about others under the &quot;Access to Information Act&quot;.
Each province and territory in Canada has its own access to information legislation. In all cases, this is also the provincial public sector privacy legislation. For example:
* Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Alberta)
* Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (British Columbia)
* Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Manitoba)
* Right to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (New Brunswick)
* Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Newfoundland and Labrador)
* Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Northwest Territories)
* Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Nova Scotia)
* Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Nunavut)
* Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Ontario)
* Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Prince Edward Island)
* Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Saskatchewan)
* Act respecting access to documents held by public bodies and the protection of personal information (Quebec)
* Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Yukon)

From 1989 to 2008, requests made to the federal government were catalogued in the Coordination of Access to Information Requests System.

A 393-page report released in September 2008, sponsored by several Canadian newspaper groups, compares Canada&#x27;s Access to Information Act to the FOI laws of the provinces and of 68 other nations.

In 2009, The Walrus (magazine) published a detailed history of FOI in Canada.

===Cayman Islands===

The Freedom of Information Law was passed in 2007 and was brought into force in January 2009.

===Chile===
In Chile, article 8 of the Constitution provides for the freedom of information. A law titled Law on Access to Public Information (&quot;Ley de Acceso a la Información Pública&quot;) took effect on 20 April 2009.

===China===
In April 2007, the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China promulgated the &quot;Regulations of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on Open Government Information&quot; (中华人民共和国政府信息公开条例), which came into effect on 1 May 2008.

===Colombia===
The Colombian constitution grants the right of access to public information through &quot;Law 57 of 1985&quot; which thereby mandates the publishing of acts and official documents. This is implemented and applies to documents that belong to official facilities (offices or the like). Additionally there is the anti corruption statement of &quot;Law 190 of 1955&quot; also known as &quot;anti corruption act&quot; which in its 51st article mandates public offices to list in visible area all the contracts and purchases made by month. The latter taking place slowly. A more modern law, the &quot;Ley de transparencia y del derecho de acceso a la información pública nacional&quot; its at its final stages.

Article 23 of the constitution states that &quot;Every person has the right to present petitions to the authorities for the general or private interest and to secure their prompt resolution. The legislative body may regulate the presentation of petitions to private organisations in order to guarantee fundamental rights.&quot;

This article justifies the existence of a jurisdictional mechanism known a petition action. This action is regulated by the law 1755 of 2015 and is considered by the Colombian Judicial Doctrine as a fundamental human right. According to the law all petitions should be fully addressed in 15 business days. If not addressed the official in charge of resolving the petition may be charged with misconduct.

===Cook Islands===
Access to official information is governed by the Official Information Act 2008. The law is based heavily on the New Zealand legislation.

===Croatia===

In Croatia, the (&quot;Act on the Right of Access to Information&quot;) first introduced in 2003 extends to all public authorities.

===Cyprus===
The right of access to information in Cyprus is guaranteed in constitutional provisions on freedom of expression. The No. 184(I)/2017 law on access to information in the southern part of the Republic of Cyprus of the country has been published on 22 December 2017. A law that falls below Council of Europe standards in the Northern occupied part of Cyprus. The right to access to public information is provided in different ways in the two parts of the island, in which Cyprus is de facto divided.

As to 2011, a research by the Open Cyprus Project showed that there was a level of 75% of administrative silence island-wide, in response to information requests. Over half of the respondents to this survey stated that, in practice, access to key documents is not possible.

Since late 2013, a draft law on the Right to Access Public Information was being discussed in the Parliament of the Republic of Cyprus.

On 22 December 2017 the law has finally been approved (Law number 184(I)/2017 Law on the Right of Access to Information of the Public Sector).

===Czech Republic===
In the Czech Republic, the (&quot;Act No. 106/1999 Coll. on Free Access to Information&quot;) covers the &quot;state agencies, territorial self-administration authorities and public institutions managing public funds&quot; as well as any body authorised by the law to reach legal decisions relating to the public sector, to the extent of such authorisation.

===Denmark===
Access to Public Administration Files Act of 1985 is a Danish act passed by the Folketing concerning public access to governmental records. The Act came into force in 1987 and repealed the Public Records Act of 1970. New version of the Act came into force on 1 January 2014. Denmark is considered to be a historic pioneer in the field of FOI along with Sweden, Finland and Norway.
There is no constitutional basis in the Constitution of Denmark for the right of the public to information. Denmark scores 64 points in Global Right to Information Rating.

====Scope====
According to the Act of 1985, Section 4 Part 1 states that “any person may ask to see documents received or issued by an administrative authority.” Information concerning administrative matters of the public administration; electricity and heating utilities as well as private bodies receiving public funding or performing public function can be acquired. Yet, the information concerning activities of judicial branch and legislators is not accessible.

====Procedure====
Reasons do not have to be given while making a request; however, the authorities can ask for additional information regarding document. The requests are supposed to be handled as soon as possible; if within period of 10 days response to an application was not provided, the authority has to inform on reasons for the delay as well as expected date for a decision. More detailed procedures are not laid down in the Act.

====Exceptions====
Access to information is limited by “the obligation to maintain secrecy.” Considerations of State security, defence, foreign policy, external economic interests as well as public financial interests can limit the granting of access to the information.
Registers and records processed electronically are excluded from the administrative documents that can be given access to. Section 10 outlines other areas excluded from access, such as records of meetings of the Council of State, minutes, as well as documents prepared for such meetings; correspondence between ministries concerning legislation and material used for scientific research or public statistics.

====Appeals====
Decision to grant or not to grant access can be appealed. Decisions can also be appealed externally to Folketingets Ombudsman. Ombudsman can also deliver opinions and review decisions; however, these are not binding even though generally followed. Ombudsman receives 200–300 complaints annually; approximately 15 percent of complaints are ruled in favour of appellants.

====Revisions====
The exemption regarding EU documents was taken out of the Act in 1991. Amendments were also made in 2000; they concerned data on the employees of the Government. In January 2014 new Public Records Act was enforced. The new act was highly debated since it was considered to limit transparency in the Government and legislative proceedings; Denmark received one point less in the category of Political Environment when compared with the Freedom of the Press report of 2015. The new legislation caused demonstrations and protests. It can be regarded as a response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. After the Public Records Act of 2013 came into effect, public access to information regarding the Intelligence Services instead of falling under the Public Records Act is now managed by the Act on the Security and Intelligence Service as well as the Act on the Defense Intelligence Service. In addition, the access to legislative process was further restricted. According to the new Act documents in the drafting stage are not to be accessed as well as “other corresponding political activities,” so restriction is not concerning only Bills. In the future, it will not be possible to find the calendars of ministers being published. Nevertheless, the Act was created while keeping in mind the strengthening the project of the Open Government; the list of institutions covered by the Act was extended as well as list of public-private institutions and companies.

===Dominican Republic===
Hipólito Mejía approved (&quot;Law number 200-04 – Law on Access to Information&quot;) on 28 July 2004, which allows public access to information from the government and private organisations that receive public money to conduct state business. Rough drafts and projects that are not part of an administrative procedure are not included.

===Ecuador===
In Ecuador, the of 2004 declares that the right of access to information is guaranteed by the state.

===El Salvador===
In El Salvador, the was given assent by The Legislative Assembly of El Salvador on 3 March 2011.

===Estonia===
In Estonia, the of 2000 seeks to &quot;ensure that the public and every person has the opportunity to access information intended for public use, based on the principles of a democratic and social rule of law and an open society, and to create opportunities for the public to monitor the performance of public duties&quot;. It extends to all &quot;holders of information&quot;, covering all state and local government bodies, legal persons in public law and legal persons in private law if they are performing public duties (providing health, education etc.).

===Europe===
In matters concerning the local, national and transboundary environment, the Aarhus convention grants the public rights regarding access to information, public participation and access to justice in governmental decision-making processes. It focuses on interactions between the public and public authorities.

====Council of Europe====
The recognition of the right to access to public information under Article 10 (including &quot;freedom (..) to receive (..) information&quot;) of the European Convention on Human Rights was one of subjects in &quot;Guerra v. Italy&quot; case before the European Court of Human Rights in 1998. The majority considered Article 10 was not applicable to the complaint. However, the court found that in the specific case, which included living near a high-risk factory, not providing information was in violation of Article 8 (respect to private and family life). Besides, two judges expressed a dissent on applicability of Article 10, and further six judges reserved a possibility, that in other circumstances, right to access to information could be protected by Article 10.

The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has considered in 1996, that &quot;public access to clear and full information on this subject [Chernobyl disaster]—and many others for that matter—must be viewed as a basic human right&quot;. In 2009, CoE Convention on Access to Official Documents was opened for signature.

====European Union====

=====Right of access to documents of the Union=====
 and give ″[a]ny citizen of the Union, and any natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in a Member State, [...] a right of access to documents of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union, whatever their medium.&quot; It follows from Article 15 TFEU that this right is &quot;subject to the principles and the conditions to be defined&quot; in legislation.

 further defines this right of access to documents of the three institutions; for most other EU bodies and agencies, there is a provision in the legal act establishing them which makes Regulation No 1049/2001 applicable to them as well. In some other cases, specific rules apply (e.g. to the EESC, the CoR, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors and the ECB). &quot;Document&quot; is defined broadly and it is assumed that all documents, even if classified, may be subject to right of access unless it falls under one of the exceptions. If access is refused, the applicant is allowed a confirmatory request. A complaint against a refusal can be made with the European Ombudsman and/or an appeal can be brought before the European General Court.

=====Re-use of public sector information=====
In addition, sets out the rules and practices for accessing public sector information resources for further exploitation. This directive has been reviewed in 2013 by 

=====Register of lobbyists=====
Since 2008, the European Commission operates the Register of Interest representatives, a voluntary register of lobbyists at the European union.

=====Access to Environmental Information=====
Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and Council provides for citizens of each country to have freedom of access to information on the environment, in line with the requirements of the Aarhus Convention. Governments are required to transcribe the directive into national legislation (for example, in the United Kingdom, the Environmental Information Regulations 2004).

=====Personal data=====
Directive 95/46/EC, the Data Protection directive, provides a variety of rights in relation to personal data, including a right of access. This has been transcribed into national legislation through, for example, the Data Protection Act 1998 (United Kingdom) and the Data Protection 2003 (Ireland).

===Finland===
In Finland, the (&quot;Act on the Openness of Public Documents&quot; of 1951) established the openness of all records and documents in the possession of officials of the state, municipalities, and registered religious communities. Exceptions to the basic principle could only be made by law, or by an executive order for specific enumerated reasons such as national security. The openness of unsigned draft documents was not mandated, but up to the consideration of the public official. This weakness of the law was removed when the law was revised in the 1990s. The revised law, the (&quot;Act on the Openness of Government Activities&quot; of 1999), called in short &quot;Publicity Act&quot; () also extended the principle of openness to corporations that perform legally mandated public duties, such as pension funds and public utilities, and to computer documents.

The Publicity Act establishes a process by which any person may access any record in possession of an authority. The person may ask the authority for the document in person or in writing. When making the request, the requester needs to specify the document so that it can be identified. However, the authority is liable to assist the person with its document registers and indices in this task. After receiving the request, the authority has two weeks to give the document. If the decision is negative, and document is withheld, the requester may appeal to the administrative court. The document may be given orally, for reading and copying in the authority&#x27;s premises or as an electronic or paper copy, as requested by the person. However, the copying may be declined if it would be unfeasible because of the large number of documents or otherwise technically difficult. There are also a number of limitations on the release of electronic documents designed for the protection of the individual privacy.

The reasons for withholding a document are listed in the article 24 of the Act. They may be grouped to three categories: automatic non-openness, conditional non openness or conditional openness. The documents where automatic non-openness is prescribed remain withheld in all cases. In the case of conditional non-openness, the reasonability of the non-openness is reviewed case-by-case by the authority and, if appeals are made, by the court. In the third category, openness is a rule, and the reason for non-openness needs to be established by the authority.

The absolute reasons for non-openness are (subpoint of Article 24 in captions)
*Documents of the foreign policy committee of the Council of State, foreign policy memos of the foreign ministry on political status, negotiations with foreign governments or organisations and diplomatic cryptograms, unless released by the ministry (1)
*registers held by law enforcement for investigation and prevention of crimes, as well as passport or ID card photos and biometric information on them (4)
*statistics and other documents on economic policy that might affect financial markets, until they are released to public (13)
*documents handed over to a statistical authority for the compilation of statistics and documents handed over voluntarily to an authority for purposes of research and statistics (16)
*documents containing medical information, information on sexual orientation or information pertaining to a customer of labour administration or of social services (25)

*documents identifying an anonymous witness (31a)
*documents containing information on individual&#x27;s political opinions, hobbies, personal habits, membership and activities in associations, family life or opinions uttered within private life. However, information on having held positions of responsibility held or having been a candidate for them is public, as well as being aa founding member of a political party or electoral association. (32)

Conditional non-openness is mandated for the following categories of documents, unless it is &quot;obviously clear&quot; that the protected interest is not endangered
* documents concerning international relations of Finland, Finnish institutions or Finnish persons, unless it is obviously clear that no harm will befall on Finnish foreign relations now or in the future (2)
* documents concerning criminal investigations or pending prosecutions until the investigation is over or the prosecution has pleaded, unless it is obviously clear that the investigation or the prosecution is not harmed and no private person will suffer material harm nor suffering (3)
* documents on security of buildings, facilities, communications or information systems, unless it is obviously clear that the security is not endangered (7)
* all documents of Finnish Security Intelligence Service and other documents concerning state security, unless it is obviously clear that state security is not endangered (9)
* documents concerning national defence or military intelligence, unless it is obviously clear that national defence is in no way harmed or endangered (10)
* documents, records and data used as a basis for or concerning an academic thesis, scientific or scholarly research or product development, unless it is obviously clear that the research, development or study, their proper evaluation, the student or the researcher or the funder of the work are not harmed (21)
*documents concerning a refugee or an applicant for a visa, residence permit or an asylum, unless it is obviously clear that the person or his loved ones are not harmed (24)
*information contained in the criminal register and in other registers held by authorities overseeing the execution of punishments, as well as documents of authorities if they contain personal information on persons who have lost their personal freedom or who participate in witness protection programme, unless it is obviously clear that the security, future employment and social reintegration of the person will not be endangered and there is a valid reason for releasing the specific information in question (28)

Conditional openness is prescribed for the following categories of information:
*technical and tactical methods of police, Finnish Border Guard and prison authorities, if their release would make the work of such authorities more difficult (5)
*administrative complaints during their handling, if their release would harm investigation or be likely to cause suffering or harm to a party in the matter, unless grave reasons exist for release of information (6)
*information on civil defence or rescue preparations and on safety investigations, if the release would endanger rescue work, civil defence preparations, safety or security or their continued development, or would endanger getting information in future safety investigations, or would hurt the victims of an accident, their memory or their loved ones (8)
*information on financial, monetary, labour or fiscal policy measures or their preparations or pre-studies if the release would defeat the purpose of such measures, endanger the negotiation position of the state or otherwise cause great harm to the management of such policies (11)
*studies conducted by regulatory authorities of financial and pension institutions, if the studies include information on the regulated bodies and the release would endanger the proper functioning of financial markets (12)
*documents containing information on endangered species or valuable natural areas, if the release would endanger their preservation (14)
*documents pertaining to an investigation or other control measure by an authority if the release would endanger the regulatory control measure or its purpose (15)
*detailed returns of political candidates on their campaign funding (15)
*business and professional secrets of public bodies, if a competing the body would suffer economic harm, or a public or private body pursuing competing or similar activities would gain a competitive advantage by the release or if the possibilities of a body bound by the Publicity Act to make advantageous purchases or other financial arrangements would be harmed (17)
*documents used by a public body in a collective bargaining or labour action if the release would harm the public body as the employer (18)
*documents used for preparation of a legal action, if the release would harm a public body as a party to a suit (19)
*documents containing information on entrance examination or other examination or test, if the release would defeat the purpose of the test or exam or prevent its future use (22)
* documents containing sensitive information on the private life of a suspect, plaintiff, witness or other party to a criminal investigation, or information on the victim that would hurt the victim&#x27;s memory or her loved ones, unless the release is necessary to conduct the work of an authority (26)

Non-open information remains non-open for 25 years after it was created or obtained by an authority. Documents that are non-open to protect the privacy of an individual remain non-open for 50 years after the protected individual has died.

If information is still, after 25 years, valid and describes a security measure of a building, facility, system or method or it is still part of a plan used for national defence or civil defence, it remains non-open as long as the information is pertinent for the purpose. The same indefinite non-openness applies to all documents under international security obligations, if the release might still affect Finnish foreign relations negatively. The non-openness of other documents may be prolonged up to 55 years by the Council of State, if necessary to safeguard a protected interest.

===France===
In France, the accountability of public servants is a constitutional right, according to the &quot;Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen&quot;.

The implementing legislation is the (&quot;Act No. 78-753 of 17 July 1978. On various measures for improved relations between the Civil Service and the public and on various arrangements of administrative, social and fiscal nature&quot;). It sets as a general rule that citizens can request a copy of any administrative document (in paper, digitised or other form), and establishes the &quot;Commission d’Accès aux Documents Administratifs&quot;, an independent administrative authority, to oversee the process, although no administration is required to accept those request.

===Georgia===

In Georgia, the General Administrative Code contains a .

===Germany===
In Germany, the federal government passed a freedom of information law on 5 September 2005; it was last updated on 7 August 2013. The law grants each person an unconditional right to access official federal information. No legal, commercial, or any other kind of justification is necessary.

Thirteen of the sixteen Bundesländer—Baden-Württemberg, Berlin, Brandenburg, Bremen, Hamburg, Hesse, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Rheinland-Pfalz, Saarland, Sachsen-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein and Thüringen—have approved individual &quot;&quot; (Freedom of Information laws).

===Greece===
In Greece, the 1975 Greek Constitution guaranteed the right of access to administrative documents and the right of citizens to obtain information. However it was not until 1986 that the first law was passed to provide for access to information.

Article 16 (Right to Access Administrative Documents—Δικαίωμα γνώσης διοικητικών εγγράφων) of Law 1599/1986 (State-citizenry Relationship—Σχέσεις Κράτους-πολίτη) introduced the right of all citizens to read most administrative documents. This right is now codified as article 5 (Access to documents—Πρόσβαση σε έγγραφα) of the Administrative Procedural Code (Κώδικας Διοικητικής Διαδικασίας), Law 2690/1999. Under this article, citizens have a right to know the content of administrative documents. Administrative documents are defined as those produced by public sector entities, such as reports, studies, minutes, statistical data, circulars, instructions, responses, consultatory responses, and decisions. In addition, citizens with a legitimate interest may also access &quot;private&quot; documents stored by public services. The right cannot be exercised if the document concerns the private or family lives of others, or if the document&#x27;s confidentiality is safeguarded by specific legal provisions. Furthermore, the public body can refuse access if the document refers to discussions in the Cabinet, or if accessing the document can seriously hamper criminal or administrative violation investigations carried out by judicial, police, or military authorities.

Citizens may study the documents at the place where they are archived, or they may obtain a copy at their own cost. Access to one&#x27;s own medical data is provided with the help of a doctor. Access to documents should take into account whether they be covered by copyright, patent, or trade secret regulations.

In addition, Law 3448/2006, on the reuse of public sector information, harmonises the national laws with the requirements on the European Union Directive 2003/98/EC.

===Guyana===

Guyana has a freedom of information act, which came into force in 2013, but it has relatively weak provisions.A commission tasked with ensuring asset declarations by government officials has begun functioning since 2018.Guyana also entered into the EITI, which guarantees the transparency of the proceeds of oil reserves of countries.

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong there are no laws specifically enacted to guarantee the freedom of information.

Since March 1995, the Government of Hong Kong has promulgated a &quot;Code on Access to Information&quot; to serve a similar purpose. This code, like other internal regulations of the Government, was not legislated by the Legislative Council and has a minimal legal status. It requires government agencies listed in its appendix to appoint Access to Information Officers to answer citizens&#x27; requests for governmental records. A fee may be charged prior to the release of information. The code does not require the government to archive information.

===Hungary===
In Hungary, the of 1992 extends a right of access to all data of public interest, defined as any information processed by a body performing a governmental function. Complaints and contested applications may be appealed to the Data Protection Commissioner (until 2011) or to the court.

In 2005 the Parliament adopted the (Act XC of 2005). The Act has three basic parts: 1. electronic disclosure of certain data by public sector bodies, 2. publicity of legislation and 3. openness of Court decisions.

From 2010 on the Second Orbán Government have changed considerable parts of the legislation, changing the constitution and by releasing a completely rewritten law (Act CXII of 2011 ). The move discontinued the Data Protection Commissioner office (in January 2012 the European Commission launched infringement proceedings against Hungary for the abolition of the position and for violation of doing it mid-term), and moved data protection into the &quot;National Authority of Data Protection and Freedom of Information&quot; (NAIH) government body, run a leader loyal to the government; the results were that controversial data is withheld without merit and needs to be forced out by lengthy and costly court process. 

Legally the law withholds openness of public data (Section III and IV) and protection of personal data (section II).

===Iceland===
In Iceland the Information Act (Upplýsingalög) Act no. 50/1996 gives access to public information.

===India===
The Right to Information Act (RTI Act) was passed by Parliament on 11 May 2005 and was published in the gazette of India on 15 June 2005. It came into effect on 12 October 2005 replacing the erstwhile Freedom of information Act, 2002. The Supreme Court of India had, in several Judgments prior to enactment of both Acts, interpreted Indian Constitution to read Right to Information as the Fundamental Right as embodied in Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression and also in Right to Life. RTI Act laid down a procedure to guarantee this right. Under this law all Government Bodies or Government funded agencies have to designate a Public Information Officer (PIO). The PIO&#x27;s responsibility is to ensure that information requested is disclosed to the petitioner within 30 days or within 48 hours in case of information concerning the life or liberty of a person. The law was inspired by previous legislation from select states (among them Tamil Nadu (1997), Goa (1997), Rajasthan (2000), Karnataka (2000), Delhi (2001), Maharashtra (2002) etc.) that allowed the right to information (to different degrees) to citizens about activities of any State Government body.

Legal Aid to Poor
A number of high-profile disclosures revealed corruption in various government schemes such scams in Public Distribution Systems (ration stores), disaster relief, construction of highways etc. The law itself has been hailed as a landmark in India&#x27;s drive towards more openness and accountability.

However the RTI has certain weaknesses that hamper implementation. There have been questions on the lack of speedy appeal to non-compliance to requests. The lack of a central PIO makes it difficult to pin-point the correct PIO to approach for requests. There is also a criticism of the manner in which the Information Commissioners are appointed to head the information commission. It is alleged by RTI Activists that bureaucrats working in close proximity with the government are appointed in the RTI Commissions in a non-transparent manner. The PIO, being an officer of the relevant Government institution, may have a vested interest in not disclosing damaging information on activities of his/her Institution, This therefore creates a conflict of interest. In the state of Maharashtra it was estimated that only 30% of the requests are actually realised under the Maharashtra Right to Information act. The law does not allow disclosure of information that affects national security, defence, and other matters that are deemed of national interest.

===Iran===
The Law on Dissemination of and Free Access to Information was approved by Iranian Parliament in 2008. Its English and Arabic renditions were officially released as part of the government&#x27;s efforts to promote Freedom of Information (FOI) in October 2018.

In 2023 Iranian government charged Etemad after publishing information on denied news by the government around hijab watch guards law obtained by Foia, the government claimed it was top secret.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, the Freedom of Information Act 1997 came into effect in April 1998, one year after its enactment. It provided for members of the public to access information specifically about themselves, amend incorrect information, and request an explanation behind administrative decisions concerning themselves, as well as allowing any person to access records generated by a list of specified public bodies. The Act is seen as having led to a sea-change in the relationship between the citizen, journalists, government departments and public bodies. Disclosure is the default assumption of the Act; bodies can withhold information only by citing exemptions specified in the legislation. Decisions of public bodies in relation to requests for information may be reviewed by the Office of the Information Commissioner.

The 2014 Act was amended by the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003. The amendments introduced fees for non-personal requests and restricted the kinds of material which could be accessed.

The Freedom of Information Act 2014 repealed the 1997 and 2003 Acts, removing most of the restrictions introduced in 2003 and widening the range of bodies covered to all public bodies, unless specifically exempt. It also allowed for the government to prescribe (or designate) other bodies receiving significant public funds, so that the FOI legislation would also apply to them.

===Israel===
In Israel, the Freedom of Information Law, 5758–1998, supported by the Freedom of Information Regulations, 5759–1999, controls freedom of information. It defines the bodies subject to the legislation by a set of listed categories – essentially, most public bodies – and provides for the government to publish a list of all affected bodies. However, this list does not seem to have been made publicly available, if indeed it was ever compiled. Many public bodies are not obliged to follow the law, which limits the potential for use by the public.

The Israeli Freedom of Information Law has, in some cases, actually achieved the opposite intended result. some Government agencies now take the position that a citizen may only request information via FOIL—i.e., an official letter designated as such and including the 95 shekel fee. Thus an Israeli citizen in many cases cannot simply write a letter asking a question, and can be asked to file a FOIL application with a fee and wait the minimum statutory 30 days for a reply, which the agency can extend to 60 days. In many cases FOIL letters are simply ignored, or some laconic response is sent stating the request is either unclear, unspecific, too vague or some other legalese, anything in order to keep the information away from the public. When the 60 days are up, if the anticipated result usually yield nothing significant, the applicant must petition the District Court to compel disclosure, a procedure that requires attorneys to draft pleadings and a payment of (approximately) $420 court fee. A judgement in such FOIL appeals in Israel can take many months, and again the agency can easily avoid disclosure by simply not complying, although risking being charged with contempt of court. While there are some successes in courts compelling Israeli government agencies to disclose information, they are usually in non-controversial areas. The law provides for the expected &quot;security&quot; exemption and an applicant applying for such information can expect not to benefit from FOIL (and also have his or her court appeal rejected). Applicants can sometimes be helped by The Movement for Freedom of Information.

===Italy===

Chapter V of Law No. 241 of 7 August 1990 provides for access to administrative documents. However, the right to access is limited. The law states that those requesting information must have a legal interest. The 1992 regulations require &quot;a personal concrete interest to safeguard in legally relevant situations.&quot; The courts have ruled that this includes the right of environmental groups and local councilors to demand information on behalf of those they represent. It was amended in 2005. The revision appears to adopt the court rulings and relax the interest somewhat to allow access when an individual can show they represent a more general public interest.
&lt;br&gt;
Since 2013, everyone has a right to obtain access to documents, information and data that public entities are obliged to make public if they fail to do so (Article 5, Comma 1, d.l. 33/2013, aka transparency decree).
&lt;br&gt;
Since 2016, everyone has a right to obtain access to documents, information and data that public entities hold (Article 5, Comma 2, d.l. 33/2013). No particular interest is required in this case, but the law states specific limits for this right, mainly to balance it with other public and private rights. In some cases, these limits are absolutes and in other cases they are subject to discretion (art. 5-bis d.l. 33/2013). This legal reform of the transparence decree, implemented with the d.lgs. n. 97/2016, is also known among jurists as FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) and it has added a different and third type of right of access.
&lt;br&gt;
The courts have ruled that the 3 types of access are complementary and do not exclude each other.

===Jamaica===
In Jamaica, the relevant legislation is the .

===Japan===
In Japan, the &quot;Law Concerning Access to Information Held by Administrative Organs&quot; (行政機関の保有する情報の公開に関する法律) was promulgated in 1999. The law was enforced in 2001.

Small town governments, rather than the federal government, were the first to take measures to enact freedom of information as the national government was &quot;not...as eager as local governments to deal with freedom of information legislation&quot;

Local efforts in some ways predate national efforts; In many local governments, regulations about information disclosure (情報公開条例) were established starting from the latter half of the 1980s.

===Latvia===
The Constitution of Latvia states: &quot;Article 100. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression, which includes the right to freely receive, keep and distribute information and to express his or her views. Censorship is prohibited.&quot; The right to access state held information has been repeatedly recognised by the Constitutional Court of Latvia, most notably in its judgment &quot;On Conformity of the Cabinet of Ministers 21 January 1997 Regulations No.46 &quot;On Government Agreements&quot; with the 20 November 1998 &quot;Information Accessibility Law&quot;

The Law on Freedom of Information was signed into law by the State President in November 1998 and has been amended a number of times recently. Any person can ask for information in &quot;any technically feasible form&quot; without having to show a reason. The request can be oral or written. Bodies must respond in 15 days.

===Malta===
On 1 September 2012, Legal Notice 156 of 2012 brought the Freedom of Information Act (Chapter 496 of the Laws of Malta) fully into force, allowing the public (resident citizens of Malta, the EU and the EEA) to submit requests for documents/information held by the Government. FOI requests are submitted free of charge but processing of documents by public authorities may require the public to pay fees which never exceed Eur 40. When access to documents is refused, the FOIA in Malta provides for a complaint and appeal mechanism that can be ultimately resolved through the Courts of Appeal.

===Liberia===
President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf signed the Freedom of Information Act of 2010 into law in October 2010. Liberia became only the fourth country in Africa, and the first in West Africa, to pass such legislation. The law allows both the media and individual citizens to demand information from any public authority or any private authority that carries out government functions.

===North Macedonia===


Article 16 of the Constitution of North Macedonia guarantees &quot;access to information and the freedom of reception and transmission of information&quot;.

The Law on Free Access to Information of Public Character was adopted on 25 January 2006. It is scheduled to go into force in September 2006.The law allows any natural or legal person to obtain information from state and municipal bodies and natural and legal persons who are performing public functions. The requests can be oral, written or electronic. Requests must be responded to in 10 days.

===Malaysia===
The state of Selangor passed the Freedom of Information Enactment (Selangor) 2010 on 1 April 2011, allowing the Malaysian public an access to the state documents including that of local councils, city halls and state government-linked companies. Subsequently, the state of Penang passed the Freedom of Information bill on 4 November 2011, allowing the public to access to state documents. Both states are under the ruling of the federal opposition Pakatan Rakyat.

===Maldives===
The Maldives passed the Right to Information Act (RTI) on 12 January 2014.

===Mexico===
The Constitution was amended in 1977 to include a right of freedom of information. Article 6 says in part, &quot;the right of information shall be guaranteed by the state.&quot; The Supreme Court made a number of decisions further enhancing that right.

The Federal Law of Transparency and Access to Public Government Information was unanimously approved by Congress in April 2002 and signed by President Fox in June 2002. It went into effect in June 2003.

===Moldova===
Article 34 of the Constitution provides for a right of access to information.

The Law of the Republic of Moldova on Access to Information was approved by Parliament in May 2000 and went into force in August 2000. Under the law, citizens and residents of Moldova can demand information from state institutions, organisations financed by the public budget and individuals and legal entities that provide public services and hold official information.

===Montenegro===

A freedom of information law was passed in Montenegro late in 2005, after a process of several years.

===Nepal===
Nepal Government passed a draft of information act in September 2007 on behalf of freedom. Based on that draft, the government enacted a specific law to regulate right to information on 18 July 2007. However, in February 2009 for the protection, promotion and execution of Right to Information in Nepal National Information Commission formed Right to Information Act, 2007.

===Netherlands===
Article 110 of the Constitution states: &quot;In the exercise of their duties government bodies shall observe the principle of transparency in accordance with the rules to be prescribed by Act of Parliament.&quot;

The Dutch act on public access to government information entered into force in 1980 and is updated several times later. Under the act known as the &quot;&quot;, or &quot;Wob&quot; for short, any person can demand information (called &quot;wobbing&quot;) related to an administrative matter if it is contained in documents held by public authorities or companies carrying out work for a public authority. The request can either be written or oral. The authority has two (on environmental issues) or four weeks to respond. The act also obliges the government to provide information &quot;unsolicited&quot; as it is in the interest of good and democratic governance.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the relevant legislation is the Official Information Act 1982. This implemented a general policy of openness regarding official documents and replaced the Official Secrets Act.

===Nigeria===
Former President Goodluck Jonathan signed into law the Freedom of Information (FoI) Bill, awaited for 12 years by media proprietors and practitioners alike, during which the Villa got knocks for filibustering and lawmakers complained of bombardment by campaigners.

The House of Representatives passed the Bill on 24 February 2011, and the Senate dialled up integrity on 16 March as it delivered on promise to pass it.

The harmonised version was passed by both Chambers on 26 May 2011.It was conveyed to Jonathan on 27 May, and he signed it on 28 May 2011, according to a statement Aso Rock issued on Tuesday.

Two states in Nigeria (namely Ekiti and Lagos State) have adopted the Freedom of Information Act at State level but they have extended the response date at State level from 7 days to 14 days. More states are expected to adopt the bill and come up with their own version.

===Norway===
The current freedom of information legislation was enacted 19 May. 2006, and superseded the previous law of 1970 by 1 January 2009. Article 100 of the Constitution gives access to public documents. The basic principle of the law is everyone has the right to access to State and municipal documents and to be present at sittings of courts and elected assemblies.

===Pakistan===

President Pervez Musharraf promulgated the Freedom of Information Ordinance 2002 in October 2002. The law allows any citizen access to public records held by a public body of the federal government including ministries, departments, boards, councils, courts and tribunals. It does not apply to government owned corporations or provincial governments. The bodies must respond within 21 days.

More recently, by virtue of the 18th Amendment of 2010, article 19A has been inserted in the Constitution of Pakistan. It gives the right to access to information the status of a fundamental constitutional right. Article 19A &quot;Right to Information&quot; reads: &quot;Every citizen shall have the right to have access to information in all matters of public importance subject to regulation and reasonable restrictions imposed by law&quot;.

===Paraguay===
The National Constitution of Paraguay enacted in 1992, guarantees the right to be informed and to receive true, responsible, and equitable information (Art. 28). The same article states that public sources of information are free, and that a law will regulate the modalities, time periods, and sanctions “in order to make this right effective”. In practice, this last provision delayed the recognition of the right due to the absence of a law making it “effective”. Congress, government agencies and Courts were reluctant to enforce the right to access public sources of information until 2013. A Supreme Court judgment (No. 1306 of 15 October 2013), marked the beginning of what has been called a “Transparency Spring”.

The ruling from the Supreme Court was made in the context of an Amparo filed by a citizen called Jose Daniel Vargas Tellez, after the San Lorenzo Municipality denied him access to the information about the names, the job descriptions and the wages of all the employees that were working in that public office. The Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeals rejected the Amparo on the grounds that information of that type was considered sensitive by the Data Protection and Privacy Act (Law 1682/02 and 1969/02). The latter rulings were challenged on constitutional grounds and the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Vargas Tellez holding that while this information relating to the identity and wages of public employees and officers constitutes personal propriety data, it is nonetheless registered in a “public source of information”, which makes it available to any citizen who requests it. The right to access to these informations is recognised under the Constitution and international instruments such as the American Convention on Human Rights (Art. 13); The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Art. 19); and the United Nations Convention against Corruption (Art. 13).

Following the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision, and with the support of the civil society and President Horacio Cartes, the first Transparency law was enacted (Law No. 5189/14) requiring all public offices to disclose information regarding the use of public funds to pay salaries. In addition, The Freedom of Information and Government Transparency Law (Law 5282/2014) was enacted in 2014 and a final regulation of 2015 (Executive Decree 4064/15) set the final step in the road to Transparency. These rules expressly recognize that the right to access public information is a human right, which improves the State, promotes citizen participation and public accountability, and serves as a tool to combat corruption. Currently, all requests to access public information can be done online through a single portal, and government offices are obliged to respond within 15 days.

Paraguay became internationally committed to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance after becoming a member of the Open Government Partnership. Presently, most government offices have Transparency offices and can provide information to citizens and receive reports of corruption. The main Executive agency in charge of promoting Electronic Government is the SENATICS.

Art 28 of the Constitution also states that any person affected by the diffusion of a false, distorted, or ambiguous information has the right to demand its rectification or its clarification by the same means and under the same conditions in which it was divulged, without prejudice to the other compensatory rights. There is also a specific law that regulates Habeas Data, and any citizen can request a copy of publicly or privately held information relating to him, and can demand that any inaccurate data found be destroyed.

===Philippines===
On 23 July 2016, Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte signed the executive order on freedom of information to be implemented effectively in all offices under the executive branch of government.

===Pitcairn Islands===
Section 13(4) of the Constitution of the Pitcairn Islands provides that &quot;Freedom of information in Pitcairn shall be provided by Ordinance, which shall reflect the freedom of information legislation of the United Kingdom adapted to the circumstances of Pitcairn&quot;.

The &quot;Freedom of Information Ordinance 2012&quot; implements this requirement.

===Poland===
Article 61 of the Constitution provides for the right to information and mandates that Parliament enact a law setting out this right.

The Law on Access to Public Information was approved in September 2001 and went into effect in January 2002. The Act allows anyone to demand access to public information, public data and public assets held by public bodies, private bodies that exercise public tasks, trade unions and political parties. The requests can be oral or written. The bodies must respond within 14 days.

===Portugal===
The Portuguese Constitution guarantees the right of access to administrative documents in its Article 268, titled &quot;Citizens’ rights and guarantees [before the Administration]&quot;. Its paragraphs (1), (2) and (6) read as following:

&quot;1. Citizens have the right to be informed by the Administration, whenever they so request, as to the progress of the procedures and cases in which they are directly interested, together with the right to be made aware of the definitive decisions that are taken in relation to them.

2. Without prejudice to the law governing matters concerning internal and external security, criminal investigation and personal privacy, citizens also have the right of access to administrative files and records.
6. For the purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2) the law shall lay down a maximum time limit for responses by the Administration.&quot;

The rule enshrined in Art. 268, par. (2) of the Constitution is known as the &quot;principle of open Administration&quot; and it is regulated by Law no. 26/2016 (&quot;Lei n.º 26/2016, de 22 de Agosto&quot;) which also enacts into national law the European Directives no. 2003/4/EC and 2003/98/EC. Art. 15 of this law requires public entities to respond to each request within 10 days and the law&#x27;s Chapter 3 created an independent watchdog to keep track of compliance with its rules, the Commission for Access to Administrative Documents (&quot;Comissão de Acesso aos Documentos Administrativos&quot;).

===Romania===
Since 2001 there is one law on Freedom of Information and one on transparent decision-making processes in public
administration (a sunshine law).

===Serbia===

In Serbia, the gives access to documents of public authorities.

===Seychelles===
The President of the Republic, Mr Danny Faure assented to the Access to Information Act in July 2018. The Access to Information Bill 2018 was published in the Official Gazette on 24 March 2017. The Right of Access to Information is guaranteed under Article 28 of the Constitution of the Republic of Seychelles. This Act gives the public with the constitutional right of access to information held by public authorities performing a governmental function. The Act will is administered and applied by an independent Information Commission, the setting of which has been cleared with the enactment of the Law. The commission is appointed by the President in consultation with the Speaker of the National Assembly on the recommendation of the Constitutional Appointments Authority (CAA).The Information Commission strives to promote awareness, educate and popularise the right to access to information and fosters good governance by enhancing transparency, accountability and integrity in the Public Service and Administration. https://www.infocom.sc/

===Slovakia===
Slovakia passed the Freedom of Information Act in May 2000 (Num. law: 211/2000 Z. z.). Under the law, everybody can demand information from state institutions, organisations, from municipalities, individuals and legal entities financed by the public budget.

===Slovenia===

Slovenia passed the Access to Public Information Act in March 2003. The Act governs the procedure which ensures everyone free access to public information held by state bodies, local government bodies, public agencies, public funds and other entities of public law, public powers holders and public service contractors.

===South Africa===

Section 32 of the Constitution of South Africa guarantees &quot;the right of access to any information held by the state; and any information that is held by another person and that is required for the exercise or protection of any rights.&quot; This right is implemented through the Promotion of Access to Information Act, which was enacted on 2 February 2000. The right of access to &quot;privately&quot; held information is an interesting feature, as most freedom of information laws only cover governmental bodies.

===South Korea===
The Constitutional Court ruled in 1989 that there is a constitutional right to information &quot;as an aspect of the right of freedom of expression and specific implementing legislation to define the contours of the right was not a prerequisite to its enforcement.&quot;

The Act on Disclosure of Information by Public Agencies was enacted in 1996 and went into effect in January 1998. It allows citizens to demand information held by public agencies.

===Sri Lanka===
Sri Lanka&#x27;s Right to Information Act No 12 of 2016 was certified on 4 August 2016. After much debate and many amendments to the draft Bill, the final Act comprising 44 Sections was certified in early August 2016. The implementation of the Act is expected to take time due to the necessity of establishing cadre positions in government institutions to provide information to the general public. The Act is considered to hold many strengths and positive features that would effectively authorize citizens to be actively involved in the process of governance. Moreover, Article 14A(1) introduced by virtue of 19th Amendment to the 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka has paved the way for the recognition of right to information as a fundamental right.

===Sweden===

In Sweden, the Swedish Freedom of the Press Act grants public access to official documents and is included in the Constitution of Sweden. Dating back to 1766, it is the first freedom of information legislation in the modern sense. In modern times the right has become known as the Principle of Public Access (Swedish: &quot;offentlighetsprincipen&quot;).

The Principle of Public Access means that the general public is guaranteed insight into activities pursued by government agencies. All official documents handled by government agencies are public unless they contain information specified as secret under the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act. Each request to take part of official documents is handled individually and classifying documents or information as secret is subject to appeal. The constitution also grants the right for government employees to pass on information without risk of criminal charges or repercussions and the right to attend court proceedings and meetings of legislative assemblies like the Riksdag.

There are a number of exemptions to this principle when the information concerns:
* The security of Sweden or its relations with another state or international organization
* The central fiscal, monetary or currency policy of Sweden
* The inspection, control or other supervisory activities of a public authority
* The interest of preventing or prosecuting crime
* The economic interests of the public institutions
* The protection of the personal or economic circumstances of private subjects
* The preservation of animal or plant species

===Switzerland===

Switzerland is a federal state. Access to federal documents is governed by the Swiss Federal Act on the Principle of Freedom of Information in the Administration, and supervised by the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner. Access to documents at the cantonal level is governed by cantonal laws, which are mostly similar to the federal law.
As of 2018, the cantons of Appenzell Innerrhoden, Glarus, Lucerne, Nidwalden, Obwalden and Thurgau do not have freedom of information legislation.

<text>John Winthrop (January 12, 1588 – March 26, 1649) was an English Puritan lawyer and a leading figure in the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the second major settlement in New England following Plymouth Colony. Winthrop led the first large wave of colonists from England in 1630 and served as governor for 12 of the colony&#x27;s first 20 years. His writings and vision of the colony as a Puritan &quot;city upon a hill&quot; dominated New England colonial development, influencing the governments and religions of neighboring colonies in addition to those of Massachusetts.

Winthrop was born into a wealthy land-owning and merchant family. He trained in the law and became Lord of the Manor at Groton in Suffolk, England. He was not involved in founding the Massachusetts Bay Company in 1628, but he became involved in 1629 when anti-Puritan King Charles I began a crackdown on Nonconformist religious thought. In October 1629, he was elected governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and he led a group of colonists to the New World in April 1630, founding a number of communities on the shores of Massachusetts Bay and the Charles River.

Between 1629 and his death in 1649, he served 18 annual terms as governor or lieutenant-governor and was a force of comparative moderation in the religiously conservative colony, clashing with the more conservative Thomas Dudley and the more liberal Roger Williams and Henry Vane. Winthrop was a respected political figure, and his attitude toward governance seems authoritarian to modern sensibilities. He resisted attempts to widen voting and other civil rights beyond a narrow class of religiously approved individuals, opposed attempts to codify a body of laws that the colonial magistrates would be bound by, and also opposed unconstrained democracy, calling it &quot;the meanest and worst of all forms of government&quot;. The authoritarian and religiously conservative nature of Massachusetts rule was influential in the formation of neighboring colonies, which were formed in some instances by individuals and groups opposed to the rule of the Massachusetts elders.

Winthrop&#x27;s son John was one of the founders of the Connecticut Colony, and Winthrop himself wrote one of the leading historical accounts of the early colonial period. His long list of descendants includes famous Americans, and his writings continue to influence politicians today.

==Life in England==
John Winthrop was born on January 12, 1587/8 to Adam and Anne (née Browne) Winthrop in Edwardstone, Suffolk, England. His birth was recorded in the parish register at Groton. His father&#x27;s family had been successful in the textile business, and his father was a lawyer and prosperous landowner with several properties in Suffolk. His mother&#x27;s family was also well-to-do, with properties in Suffolk and Essex. In 1592, Winthrop&#x27;s father was appointed as auditor at Trinity College, Cambridge. Winthrop&#x27;s uncle John (Adam&#x27;s brother) immigrated to Ireland, and the Winthrop family took up residence at Groton Manor.

Winthrop was first tutored at home by John Chaplin and was assumed to have attended grammar school at Bury St. Edmunds. He was also regularly exposed to religious discussions between his father and clergymen, and thus came to a deep understanding of theology at an early age. He was admitted to Trinity College in December 1602, matriculating at the university a few months later. Among the students with whom he would have interacted were John Cotton and John Wheelwright, two men who also had important roles in New England. He was a close childhood and university friend of William Spring, later a Puritan Member of Parliament with whom he corresponded for the rest of his life. The teenage Winthrop admitted in his diary of the time to &quot;lusts ... so masterly as no good could fasten upon me.&quot; Biographer Francis Bremer suggests that Winthrop&#x27;s need to control his baser impulses may have prompted him to leave school early and marry at an unusually early age.

In 1604, Winthrop journeyed to Great Stambridge in Essex with a friend. They stayed at the home of a family friend, and Winthrop was favorably impressed with their daughter Mary Forth. He left Trinity College to marry her on April 16, 1605, at Great Stambridge. Mary bore him five children, of whom only three survived to adulthood. The oldest of their children was John Winthrop the Younger, who became a governor and magistrate of Connecticut Colony. Their last two children, both girls, died not long after birth, and Mary died in 1615 from complications of the last birth. The couple spent most of their time at Great Stambridge, living on the Forth estate. In 1613, Adam Winthrop transferred the family holdings in Groton to Winthrop, who then became Lord of the Manor at Groton.

===Lord of the Manor===

As lord of the manor, Winthrop was deeply involved in the management of the estate, overseeing the agricultural activities and the manor house. He eventually followed his father in practicing law in London, which would have brought him into contact with the city&#x27;s business elite. He was also appointed to the county commission of the peace, a position that gave him a wider exposure among other lawyers and landowners and a platform to advance what he saw as God&#x27;s kingdom. The commission&#x27;s responsibilities included overseeing countywide issues, including road and bridge maintenance and the issuance of licenses. Some of its members were also empowered to act as local judges for minor offenses, although Winthrop was only able to exercise this authority in cases affecting his estate. The full commission met quarterly, and Winthrop forged a number of important connections through its activities.

Winthrop documented his religious life, keeping a journal beginning 1605 in which he described his religious experiences and feelings. In it, he described his failures to keep &quot;divers vows&quot; and sought to reform his failings by God&#x27;s grace, praying that God would &quot;give me a new heart, joy in his spirit; that he would dwell with me&quot;. He was somewhat distressed that his wife did not share the intensity of his religious feelings, but he eventually observed that &quot;she proved after a right godly woman.&quot; He was more intensely religious than his father, whose diaries dealt almost exclusively with secular matters.

His wife Mary died in 1615, and he followed the custom of the time by marrying Thomasine Clopton soon after on December 6, 1615. She was more pious than Mary had been; Winthrop wrote that she was &quot;truly religious &amp; industrious therein&quot;. Thomasine died on December 8, 1616, from complications of childbirth; the child did not survive.

In approximately 1613 (records indicate that it may have been earlier), Winthrop was enrolled at Gray&#x27;s Inn. There he read the law but did not advance to the Bar. His legal connections introduced him to the Tyndal family of Great Maplestead, Essex, and he began courting Margaret Tyndal in 1617, the daughter of chancery judge Sir John Tyndal and his wife Anne Egerton, sister of Puritan preacher Stephen Egerton. Her family was initially opposed to the match on financial grounds; Winthrop countered by appealing to piety as a virtue which more than compensated for his modest income. The couple were married on April 29, 1618, at Great Maplestead. They continued to live at Groton, although Winthrop necessarily divided his time between Groton and London, where he eventually acquired a highly desirable post in the Court of Wards and Liveries. His eldest son John sometimes assisted Margaret with the management of the estate while he was away.

===Decision to begin voyage and settlement in the American colonies===
In the mid- to late-1620s, the religious atmosphere in England began to look bleak for Puritans and other groups whose adherents believed that the English Reformation was in danger. King Charles I had ascended the throne in 1625, and he had married a Roman Catholic. Charles was opposed to all manner of recusants and supported the Church of England in its efforts against religious groups such as the Puritans that did not adhere fully to its teachings and practices. This atmosphere of intolerance led Puritan religious and business leaders to consider emigration to the New World as a viable means to escape persecution.
The first successful religious colonization of the New World occurred in 1620 with the establishment of the Plymouth Colony on the shores of Cape Cod Bay. Pastor John White led a short-lived effort to establish a colony at Cape Ann in 1624, also on the Massachusetts coast. In 1628, some of the investors in that effort joined with new investors to acquire a land grant for the territory roughly between the Charles and Merrimack Rivers. It was first styled the New England Company, then renamed the Massachusetts Bay Company in 1629 after it acquired a royal charter granting it permission to govern the territory. Shortly after acquiring the land grant in 1628, it sent a small group of settlers led by John Endecott to prepare the way for further migration. John Winthrop was apparently not involved in any of these early activities, which primarily involved individuals from Lincolnshire; however, he was probably aware of the company&#x27;s activities and plans by early 1629. The exact connection is uncertain by which he became involved with the company because there were many indirect connections between him and individuals associated with the company. Winthrop was also aware of attempts to colonize other places; his son Henry became involved in efforts to settle Barbados in 1626, which Winthrop financially supported for a time.

In March 1629, King Charles dissolved Parliament, beginning eleven years of rule without Parliament. This action apparently raised new concerns among the company&#x27;s principals; in their July meeting, Governor Matthew Cradock proposed that the company reorganize itself and transport its charter and governance to the colony. It also worried Winthrop, who lost his position in the Court of Wards and Liveries in the crackdown on Puritans that followed the dissolution of Parliament. He wrote, &quot;If the Lord seeth it wilbe good for us, he will provide a shelter &amp; a hidinge place for us and others&quot;. During the following months, he became more involved with the company, meeting with others in Lincolnshire. By early August, he had emerged as a significant proponent of emigration, and he circulated a paper on August 12 providing eight separate reasons in favor of emigration. His name appears in formal connection with the company on the Cambridge Agreement signed August 26; this document provided means for emigrating shareholders to buy out non-emigrating shareholders of the company.

The company shareholders met on October 20 to enact the changes agreed to in August. Governor Cradock was not emigrating and a new governor needed to be chosen. Winthrop was seen as the most dedicated of the three candidates proposed to replace Cradock, and he won the election. The other two were Richard Saltonstall and John Humphrey; they had many other interests, and their dedication to settling in Massachusetts was viewed as uncertain. Humphrey was chosen as deputy governor, a post that he relinquished the following year when he decided to delay his emigration. Winthrop and other company officials then began the process of arranging a transport fleet and supplies for the migration. He also worked to recruit individuals with special skills that the new colony would require, including pastors to see to the colony&#x27;s spiritual needs.

It was unclear to Winthrop when his wife would come over; she was due to give birth in April 1630, near the fleet&#x27;s departure time. They consequently decided that she would not come over until a later time, and it was not until 1631 that the couple were reunited in the New World. To maintain some connection with his wife during their separation, the couple agreed to think of each other between the hours of 5 and 6 in the evening each Monday and Friday. Winthrop also worked to convince his grown children to join the migration; John Jr. and Henry both decided to do so, but only Henry sailed in the 1630 fleet. By April 1630, Winthrop had put most of his affairs in order, although Groton Manor had not yet been sold because of a long-running title dispute. The legal dispute was only resolved after his departure, and the property&#x27;s sale was finalized by Margaret before she and John Jr. left for the colony.

===Coat of arms===
John Winthrop used a coat of arms that was reportedly confirmed to his paternal uncle by the College of Arms, London in 1592. It was also used by his sons. These arms appear on his tombstone in the King&#x27;s Chapel Burying Ground. It is also the coat of arms for Winthrop House at Harvard University and is displayed on the 1675 house of his youngest son Deane Winthrop at the Deane Winthrop House. The heraldic blazon of arms is &quot;Argent three chevronels Gules overall a lion rampant Sable.&quot;

==Massachusetts Bay Colony==

===Arrival===
On April 8, 1630, four ships left the Isle of Wight carrying Winthrop and other leaders of the colony. Winthrop sailed on the &quot;Arbella&quot;, accompanied by his two young sons Samuel and Stephen. The ships were part of a larger fleet totalling 11 ships that carried about 700 migrants to the colony. Winthrop&#x27;s son Henry Winthrop missed the &quot;Arbella&quot; sailing and ended up on the &quot;Talbot&quot;, which also sailed from Wight. A sermon titled &quot;A Modell of Christian Charitie&quot;, delivered either before or during the crossing, has historically been attributed to Winthrop, but the sermon&#x27;s authorship is disputed; John Wilson or George Phillips, two ministers who sailed with the &quot;Arbella&quot;, may have authored the sermon.

&quot;A Modell of Christian Charitie&quot; described the ideas and plans to keep the Puritan society strong in faith, while also comparing the struggles that they would have to overcome in the New World with the story of Exodus. The sermon used the now-famous phrase &quot;City upon a Hill&quot; to describe the ideals to which the colonists should strive, and that consequently &quot;the eyes of all people are upon us.&quot; The sermon also said, &quot;In all times some must be rich some poore, some highe and eminent in power and dignitie; others meane and in subjection&quot;; that is, all societies include some who are rich and successful and others who are poor and subservient—and both groups were equally important to the colony because both groups were members to the same community.
The fleet arrived at Salem in June and was welcomed by John Endecott. Winthrop and his deputy Thomas Dudley found the Salem area inadequate for a settlement suitable for all of the arriving colonists, and they embarked on surveying expeditions of the area. They first decided to base the colony at Charlestown, but a lack of good water there prompted them to move to the Shawmut Peninsula where they founded what is now the city of Boston. The season was relatively late, and the colonists decided to establish dispersed settlements along the coast and the banks of the Charles River in order to avoid presenting a single point that hostile forces might attack. These settlements became Boston, Cambridge, Roxbury, Dorchester, Watertown, Medford, and Charlestown.

The colony struggled with disease in its early months, losing as many as 200 people to a variety of causes in 1630, including Winthrop&#x27;s son Henry, and about 80 others who returned to England in the spring due to these conditions. Winthrop set an example to the other colonists by working side by side with servants and laborers in the work of the colony. According to one report, he &quot;fell to work with his own hands, and thereby so encouraged the rest that there was not an idle person to be found in the whole plantation.&quot;

Winthrop built his house in Boston where he also had a relatively spacious plot of arable land. In 1631, he was granted a larger parcel of land on the banks of the Mystic River that he called Ten Hills Farm. On the other side of the Mystic was the shipyard owned in absentia by Matthew Cradock, where one of the colony&#x27;s first boats was built, Winthrop&#x27;s &quot;Blessing of the Bay&quot;. Winthrop operated her as a trading and packet ship up and down the coast of New England.

The issue of where to locate the colony&#x27;s capital caused the first in a series of rifts between Winthrop and Dudley. Dudley had constructed his home at Newtown (present-day Harvard Square, Cambridge) after the council had agreed that the capital would be established there. However, Winthrop decided instead to build his home in Boston when asked by its residents to stay there. This upset Dudley, and their relationship worsened when Winthrop criticized Dudley for what he perceived as excessive decorative woodwork in his house. However, they seemed to reconcile after their children were married. Winthrop recounts the two of them, each having been granted land near Concord, going to stake their claims. At the boundary between their lands, a pair of boulders were named the Two Brothers &quot;in remembrance that they were brothers by their children&#x27;s marriage&quot;. Dudley&#x27;s lands became Bedford, and Winthrop&#x27;s Billerica.

===Colonial governance===

The colony&#x27;s charter called for a governor, deputy governor, and 18 assistant magistrates who served as a precursor to the idea of a Governor&#x27;s Council. All these officers were to be elected annually by the freemen of the colony. The first meeting of the General Court consisted of exactly eight men. They decided that the governor and deputy should be elected by the assistants, in violation of the charter; under these rules, Winthrop was elected governor three times. The general court admitted a significant number of settlers, but also established a rule requiring all freemen to be local church members. The colony saw a large influx of immigrants in 1633 and 1634, following the appointment of strongly anti-Puritan William Laud as Archbishop of Canterbury.
When the 1634 election was set to take place, delegations of freemen sent by the towns insisted on seeing the charter, from which they learned that the colony&#x27;s lawmaking authority, the election of governor, and the election of the deputy all rested with the freemen, not with the assistants. Winthrop acceded on the point of the elections, which were thereafter conducted by secret ballot by the freemen, but he also observed that lawmaking would be unwieldy if conducted by the relatively large number of freemen. A compromise was reached in which each town would select two delegates to send to the general court as representatives of its interests. In an ironic twist, Thomas Dudley, an opponent of popular election, won the 1634 election for governor, with Roger Ludlow as deputy. Winthrop graciously invited his fellow magistrates to dinner, as he had done after previous elections.

In the late 1630s, the seeming arbitrariness of judicial decisions led to calls for the creation of a body of laws that would bind the opinions of magistrates. Winthrop opposed these moves, and used his power to repeatedly stall and obstruct efforts to enact them. His opposition was rooted in a strong belief in the common law tradition and the desire, as a magistrate, to have flexibility in deciding cases on their unique circumstances. He also pointed out that adoption of written laws &quot;repugnant to the laws of England&quot; was not allowed in the charter, and that some of the laws to be adopted likely opposed English law. The Massachusetts Body of Liberties was formally adopted during Richard Bellingham&#x27;s governorship in 1641. Some of the laws enacted in Massachusetts were cited as reasons for vacating the colonial charter in 1684.

In the 1640s, constitutional issues arose concerning the power of the magistrates and assistants. In a case involving an escaped pig, the assistants ruled in favor of a merchant who had allegedly taken a widow&#x27;s errant animal. She appealed to the general court, which ruled in her favor. The assistants then asserted their right to veto the general court&#x27;s decision, sparking the controversy. Winthrop argued that the assistants, as experienced magistrates, must be able to check the democratic institution of the general court, because &quot;a democracy is, amongst most civil nations, accounted the meanest and worst of all forms of government.&quot;

Winthrop became the focus of allegations about the arbitrary rule of the magistrates in 1645, when John was formally charged with interfering with local decisions in a case involving the Hingham militia. The case centered around the disputed appointment of a new commander, and a panel of magistrates headed by Winthrop had several parties imprisoned on both sides of the dispute, pending a meeting of the court of assistants. Peter Hobart, the minister in Hingham and one of several Hobarts on one side of the dispute, vociferously questioned the authority of the magistrates and railed against Winthrop specifically for what he characterized as arbitrary and tyrannical actions. Winthrop defused the matter by stepping down from the bench to appear before it as a defendant. He successfully defended himself, pointing out that he had not acted alone, and also that judges are not usually criminally culpable for errors that they make on the bench. He also argued that the dispute in Hingham was serious enough that it required the intervention of the magistrates. Winthrop was acquitted and the complainants were fined.

One major issue that Winthrop was involved in occurred in 1647, when a petition was submitted to the general court concerning the limitation of voting rights to freemen who had been formally admitted to a local church. Winthrop and the other magistrates rejected the appeal that &quot;civil liberty and freedom be forthwith granted to all truly English&quot;, and even fined and imprisoned the principal signers of the petition. William Vassal and Robert Child, two of the signatories, pursued complaints against the Massachusetts government in England over this and other issues.

===Religious controversies===
In 1634 and 1635, Winthrop served as an assistant, while the influx of settlers brought first John Haynes and then Henry Vane to the governorship. Haynes, Vane, Anne Hutchinson, and pastors Thomas Hooker and John Wheelwright all espoused religious or political views that were at odds with those of the earlier arrivals, including Winthrop. Hutchinson and Wheelwright subscribed to the Antinomian view that following religious laws was not required for salvation, while Winthrop and others believed in a more Legalist view. This religious rift is commonly called the Antinomian Controversy, and it significantly divided the colony; Winthrop saw the Antinomian beliefs as a particularly unpleasant and dangerous heresy. By December 1636, the dispute reached into colonial politics, and Winthrop attempted to bridge the divide between the two factions. He wrote an account of his religious awakening and other theological position papers designed to harmonize the opposing views. (It is not known how widely these documents circulated, and not all of them have survived.) In the 1637 election, Vane was turned out of all offices, and Dudley was elected governor.

Dudley&#x27;s election did not immediately quell the controversy. First John Wheelwright and later Anne Hutchinson were put on trial, and both were banished from the colony. (Hutchinson and others founded the settlement of Portsmouth on Rhode Island; Wheelwright founded first Exeter, New Hampshire and then Wells, Maine in order to be free of Massachusetts rule.) Winthrop was active in arguing against their supporters, but Shepard criticized him for being too moderate, claiming that Winthrop should &quot;make their wickedness and guile manifest to all men that they may go no farther and then will sink of themselves.&quot; Hooker and Haynes had left Massachusetts in 1636 and 1637 for new settlements on the Connecticut River (the nucleus of the Connecticut Colony); Vane left for England after the 1637 election, suggesting that he might seek a commission as a governor general to overturn the colonial government. (Vane never returned to the colony, and became an important figure in Parliament before and during the English Civil Wars; he was beheaded after the Restoration.)

In the aftermath of the 1637 election, the general court passed new rules on residency in the colony, forbidding anyone from housing newcomers for more than three weeks without approval from the magistrates. Winthrop vigorously defended this rule against protests, arguing that Massachusetts was within its rights to &quot;refuse to receive such whose dispositions suit not with ours&quot;. Ironically, some of those who protested the policy had been in favor of banishing Roger Williams in 1635. Winthrop was then out of office, and he had a good relationship with Williams. The magistrates ordered Williams&#x27; arrest, but Winthrop warned him, making possible his flight which resulted in the establishment of Providence Plantations. Winthrop and Williams later had an epistolary relationship in which they discussed their religious differences.

===Indian policy===
Winthrop&#x27;s attitude toward the local Indian populations was generally one of civility and diplomacy. He described an early meeting with one local chief:

Chickatabot came with his [chiefs] and squaws, and presented the governor with a hogshead of Indian corn. After they had all dined, and had each a small cup of sack and beer, and the men tobacco, he sent away all his men and women (though the governor would have stayed them in regard of the rain and thunder.) Himself and one squaw and one [chief] stayed all night; and being in English clothes, the governor set him at his own table, where he behaved himself as soberly ... as an Englishman. The next day after dinner he returned home, the governor giving him cheese, and pease, and a mug, and other small things.

The colonists generally sought to acquire title to the lands that they occupied in the early years, although they also practiced a policy that historian Alfred Cave calls &quot;vacuum domicilium (empty of inhabitants)&quot;: if land is not under some sort of active use, does not have fixed habitation, structures, or fences, it was considered to be free for the taking. This also meant that lands, which were only used seasonally by the Indians (e.g., for fishing or hunting) and were empty otherwise, could be claimed. According to Alfred Cave, Winthrop asserted that the rights of &quot;more advanced&quot; peoples superseded the rights of the Indians.

However, cultural differences and trade issues between the colonists and the Indians meant that clashes were inevitable, and the Pequot War was the first major conflict in which the colony engaged. Winthrop sat on the council which decided to send an expedition under John Endecott to raid Indian villages on Block Island in the war&#x27;s first major action. Winthrop&#x27;s communication with Williams encouraged Williams to convince the Narragansetts to side with the colonists against the Pequots, who were their traditional enemies. The war ended in 1637 with the destruction of the Pequots as a tribe, whose survivors were scattered into other tribes or shipped to the West Indies.

===Slavery and the slave trade===
In the aftermath of the Pequot War of 1636–38, many of the captured Pequots warriors were shipped to the West Indies as slaves. Winthrop kept one male and two female Pequots as slaves.

In 1641, the Massachusetts Body of Liberties was enacted, codifying rules about slavery, among many other things. Winthrop was a member of the committee which drafted the code, but his exact role is not known because records of the committee have not survived. C. S. Manegold writes that Winthrop was opposed to the Body of Liberties because he favored a common law approach to legislation.

===Trade and diplomacy===
Rising tensions in England culminated in a civil war and led to a significant reduction in the number of people and provisions arriving in the colonies. The colonists consequently began to expand trade and interaction with other colonies, non-English as well as English. This led to trading ventures with other Puritans on Barbados, a source of cotton, and with the neighboring French colony of Acadia.

French Acadia covered the eastern half of present-day Maine, as well as New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. It was embroiled in a minor civil war between competing administrators; English colonists began trading with Charles de Saint-Étienne de la Tour in 1642, and his opponent Charles de Menou d&#x27;Aulnay warned Boston traders away from de la Tour&#x27;s territories. In June 1643, de la Tour came to Boston and requested military assistance against assaults by d&#x27;Aulnay. Governor Winthrop refused to provide official assistance, but allowed de la Tour to recruit volunteers from the colony for service.

This decision brought on a storm of criticism, principally from the magistrates of Essex County, which was geographically closest to the ongoing dispute. John Endecott was particularly critical, noting that Winthrop had given the French a chance to see the colonial defenses. The 1644 election became a referendum on Winthrop&#x27;s policy, and he was turned out of office. The Acadian dispute was eventually resolved with d&#x27;Aulnay as the victor. In 1646, Winthrop was again in the governor&#x27;s seat when d&#x27;Aulnay appeared in Boston and demanded reparations for damage done by the English volunteers. Winthrop placated the French governor with the gift of a sedan chair, originally given to him by an English privateer.

===Property and family===

In addition to his responsibilities in the colonial government, Winthrop was a significant property owner. He owned the Ten Hills Farm, as well as land that became the town of Billerica, Governors Island in Boston Harbor (now the site of Logan International Airport), and Prudence Island in Narragansett Bay. He also engaged in the fur trade in partnership with William Pynchon, using the ship &quot;Blessing of the Bay&quot;. Governors Island was named for him and remained in the Winthrop family until 1808, when it was purchased for the construction of Fort Winthrop.

The farm at Ten Hills suffered from poor oversight on Winthrop&#x27;s part. The steward of the farm made questionable financial deals that caused a cash crisis for Winthrop. The colony insisted on paying him his salary (which he had refused to accept in the past) as well as his expenses while engaged in official duties. Private subscriptions to support him raised about £500 and the colony also granted his wife of land.

His wife Margaret arrived on the second voyage of the &quot;Lyon&quot; in 1631, but their baby daughter Anne died during the crossing. Two more children were born to the Winthrops in New England before Margaret died on June 14, 1647. Winthrop married his fourth wife Martha Rainsborough some time after December 20, 1647, and before the birth of their only child in 1648. She was the widow of Thomas Coytmore and sister of Thomas and William Rainborowe. Winthrop died of natural causes on March 26, 1649, and is buried in what is now called the King&#x27;s Chapel Burying Ground in Boston. He was survived by his wife Martha and five sons.

==Writings and legacy==
Winthrop rarely published and his literary contribution was relatively unappreciated during his time, yet he spent his life continually producing written accounts of historical events and religious manifestations. His major contributions to the literary world was &quot;The History of New England&quot; (1630–1649, also known as &quot;The Journal of John Winthrop&quot;), which remained unpublished until the late 18th century.

===&quot;The History of New England&quot;===
Winthrop kept a journal of his life and experiences, starting with the voyage across the Atlantic and continuing through his time in Massachusetts, originally written in three notebooks. His account has been acknowledged as the &quot;central source for the history of Massachusetts in the 1630s and 1640s&quot;. The first two notebooks were published in 1790 by Noah Webster. The third notebook was long thought lost but was rediscovered in 1816, and the complete journals were published in 1825 and 1826 by James Savage as &quot;The History of New England from 1630 to 1649. By John Winthrop, Esq. First Governor of the Colony of the Massachusetts Bay. From his Original Manuscripts&quot;. The second notebook was destroyed in a fire at Savage&#x27;s office in 1825; the other two volumes now belong to the Massachusetts Historical Society. Richard Dunn and Laetitia Yeandle produced a modern transcription of the diaries in 1996, combining new analysis of the surviving volumes and Savage&#x27;s transcription of the second notebook.

The journal began as a nearly day-to-day recounting of the ocean crossing. As time progressed, he made entries less frequently and wrote at a greater length so that, by the 1640s, the work began to take the shape of a history. Winthrop wrote primarily of his private accounts: his journey from England, the arrival of his wife and children to the colony in 1631, and the birth of his son in 1632. He also wrote profound insights into the nature of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and nearly all important events of the day. The majority of his early journal entries were not intended to be literary, but merely observations of early New England life. Gradually, the focus of his writings shifted from his personal observations to broader spiritual ideologies and behind-the-scenes views of political matters.

===Other works===
Winthrop&#x27;s earliest publication was likely &quot;The Humble Request of His Majesties Loyal Subjects&quot; (London, 1630), which defended the emigrants&#x27; physical separation from England and reaffirmed their loyalty to the Crown and Church of England. This work was republished by Joshua Scottow in the 1696 compilation &quot;MASSACHUSETTS: or The first Planters of New-England, The End and Manner of their coming thither, and Abode there: In several EPISTLES&quot;.

In addition to his more famous works, Winthrop produced a number of writings, both published and unpublished. While living in England, he articulated his belief &quot;in the validity of experience&quot; in a private religious journal known as his &quot;Experiencia&quot;. He wrote in this journal intermittently between 1607 and 1637 as a sort of confessional, very different in tone and style from the &quot;Journal&quot;. Later in his life, he wrote &quot;A Short Story of the rise, reign, and ruine of the Antinomians, Familists and Libertines, that Infected the Churches of New England&quot; which described the Antinomian controversy surrounding Anne Hutchinson and other in 1636 and 1637. The work was first published in London in 1644. At the time of its publication, there was much discussion about the nature of church governance, and the Westminster Assembly of Divines had recently begun to meet. The evidence which it presented was seen by supporters of Congregationalism as proving the book&#x27;s worth, and by opponents as proving its failings. In some of its editions, it was adapted by opponents of Henry Vane, who had become a leading Independent political leader in the discussion. Vane&#x27;s opponents sought to &quot;tie Toleration round the neck of Independency, stuff the two struggling monsters into one sack, and sink them to the bottom of the sea.&quot;

According to biographer Francis Bremer, Winthrop&#x27;s writings echoed those of other Puritans which &quot;were efforts both to discern the divine pattern in events and to justify the role [which] New Englanders believed themselves called to play.&quot;

===Legacy===

Winthrop was historically credited for writing &quot;A Modell of Christian Charitie&quot; and its reference to a &quot;city upon a hill&quot;, imagery that became an enduring symbol in American political discourse. Many American politicians have cited him in their writings or speeches, going back to revolutionary times. Winthrop&#x27;s reputation suffered in the late 19th and early 20th century, when critics pointed out the negative aspects of Puritan rule, including Nathaniel Hawthorne and H. L. Mencken, and leading to modern assessments of him as a &quot;lost Founding Father&quot;. Political scientist Matthew Holland argues that Winthrop &quot;is at once a significant founding father of America&#x27;s best and worst impulses&quot;, with his calls for charity and public participation offset by what Holland views as rigid intolerance, exclusionism, and judgmentalism.

Winthrop gave a speech to the General Court in July 1645, stating that there are two kinds of liberty: natural liberty to do as one wished, &quot;evil as well as good,&quot; a liberty that he believed should be restrained; and civil liberty to do good. Winthrop strongly believed that civil liberty was &quot;the proper end and object of authority&quot;, meaning that it was the duty of the government to be selfless for the people and promote justice instead of promoting the general welfare. He supported this point of view by his actions, such as when he passed laws requiring the heads of households to make sure that their children and servants received proper education, and for support of teachers from public funds. Winthrop&#x27;s actions were for the unity of the colony because he believed that nothing was more crucial of a colony than working as a single unit that wouldn&#x27;t be split by any force, such as with the case of Anne Hutchinson. He was a leader respected by many, even Richard Dummer, a principal Hutchinsonian disarmed for his activities, who gave 100 pounds to him.

Many modern politicians&#x27;s speeches refer to writings attributed to Winthrop, such as those of John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Michael Dukakis, and Sarah Palin. Reagan described Winthrop as &quot;an early &#x27;Freedom Man&#x27;&quot; who came to America &quot;looking for a home that would be free.&quot;

Winthrop is a major character in Catharine Sedgwick&#x27;s 1827 novel &quot;Hope Leslie&quot;, set in colonial Massachusetts. He also makes a brief appearance in Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; in the chapter entitled &quot;The Minister&#x27;s Vigil.&quot;

Winthrop&#x27;s descendants number thousands today. His son John was the first governor of the Saybrook Colony, and later generations of his family continued to play an active role in New England politics well into the 19th century. Twentieth century descendants include former US Senator from Massachusetts and former Secretary of State John Kerry, educator Charles William Eliot, and Downton Abbey creator, Julian Fellowes. The towns of Winthrop, Massachusetts, and Winthrop, Maine, are named in his honor. Winthrop House at Harvard University and Winthrop Hall at Bowdoin College are named in honor of him and of his descendant John Winthrop, who briefly served as President of Harvard.

He is also the namesake of squares in Boston (downtown and in Charlestown), Cambridge, and Brookline. The Winthrop Building on Water Street in Boston was built on the site of one of his homes and is one of the city&#x27;s first skyscrapers. NYU Langone Hospital in Mineola, New York was named Winthrop Hospital since 1986 named for Winthrop&#x27;s descendant, Robert Winthrop, a retired investment banker, and long time patron and volunteer of the hospital.

A statue of Winthrop by Richard Greenough is one of Massachusetts&#x27; two statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection, Capitol in Washington D.C.

Not long after the death and funeral of Winthrop, early American poet Benjamin Tompson wrote a Funeral Tribute in Winthrop&#x27;s honor, which appeared in his work, &quot;New-Englands Tears&quot;, in 1676. The Tribute was also printed as a broadsheet and circulated in Boston that same year.

<text>The role of information commissioner differs from nation to nation. Most commonly it is a title given to a government regulator in the fields of freedom of information and the protection of personal data in the widest sense. The office often functions as a specialist ombudsman service.

==Australia==
The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) has functions relating to freedom of information and privacy, as well as information policy. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner, which was the national privacy regulator, was integrated into the OAIC on 1 November 2010. There are three independent commissioners in the OAIC: the Australian Information Commissioner, the Freedom of Information Commissioner, and the Privacy Commissioner.

==Bangladesh==
The Information Commission of Bangladesh promotes and protects access to information. It is formed under the Right to Information Act, 2009, whose stated object is to empower the citizens by promoting transparency and accountability in the working of the public and private organizations, with the ultimate aim of decreasing corruption and establishing good governance. The Act creates a regime through which the citizens of the country may have access to information under the control of public and other authorities.

==Canada==
The Information Commissioner of Canada is an independent ombudsman appointed by the Parliament of Canada who investigates complaints from people who believe they have been denied rights provided under Canada&#x27;s &quot;Access to Information Act&quot;. Similar bodies at provincial level include the Information and Privacy Commissioner (Ontario).

== Germany ==
The Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (FfDF) is the federal commissioner not only for data protection but also (since commencement of the German Freedom of Information Act on January 1, 2006) for freedom of information.
==Hong Kong==
The Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) is charged with education and enforcement of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, which first came into force in 1997. The commissioner has the power to investigate and impose fines for violations. Reforms in 2021 gave it powers to investigate and prosecute suspected doxxing incidents.
==India==
The Central Information Commission, and State Information Commissions, receive and inquire into complaints from anyone who has been refused access to any information requested under the Right to Information Act, or whose rights under that Act have otherwise been obstructed, for example by being prevented from submitting a data request or being required to pay an excessive fee.

==Ireland==

The Office of the Information Commissioner () in Ireland was set up under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act 1997, which came into effect in April 1998. The Information Commissioner may conduct reviews of the decisions of public bodies in relation to requests for access to information. Since its creation, the office has been held simultaneously with that of the Ombudsman. The Information Commissioner also holds the role of Commissioner for Environmental Information.

== Switzerland ==

The Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner is responsible for the supervision of federal authorities and private bodies with respect to data protection and freedom of information legislation.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office is responsible for regulating compliance with the Data Protection Act 2018, Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004. The Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 is the responsibility of the Scottish Information Commissioner.

==Other European States==
All other countries of the European Union and the European Economic Area have equivalent officials created under their versions of Directive 95/46. The Europa website gives links to such bodies around Europe.

==Cooperation among information commissioners==
The Global Privacy Enforcement Network is a transnational organization for the coordination of privacy laws among its 59 member states and the European Union.

<text>London Metropolitan University, commonly known as London Met, is a public research university in London, England. The University of North London and London Guildhall University merged in 2002 to create the university. The University&#x27;s roots go back to 1848.

The university has campuses in the City of London and in the London Borough of Islington, a museum, archives and libraries. Special collections include the TUC Library, the Irish Studies Collection and the Frederick Parker Collection.

==History==
London Metropolitan University was formed on 1 August 2002 by the merger of London Guildhall University and the University of North London. In October 2006, the University opened a new Science Centre as part of a £30m investment in its science department at the North campus on Holloway Road, with a &quot;Super Lab&quot; claimed to be one of Europe&#x27;s most advanced science teaching facilities, and 280 workstations equipped with digital audio visual interactive equipment.

===London Guildhall University===
In 1848, Charles James Blomfield, the Bishop of London, called upon the clergy to establish evening classes to improve the moral, intellectual and spiritual condition of young men in London. In response, the bishop Charles Mackenzie, instituted the Metropolitan Evening Classes for Young Men in Crosby Hall, Bishopsgate, London, with student fees at one shilling per session. Subjects on the original curriculum included Greek, Latin, Hebrew, English, History, Mathematics, Drawing and Natural Philosophy. This fledgling college came under royal patronage following the visit of Prince Albert to the classes in 1851. In 1860, the classes moved to Sussex Hall, the former Livery Hall of the Bricklayers&#x27; Company, in Leadenhall Street. By this time, some 800 students were enrolled annually.
In 1861, the classes were reconstituted and named the City of London College. Over the next twenty years, the College was one of the pioneers in the introduction of commercial and technical subjects. The college built new premises in White Street at a cost of £16,000 (contributions were received from Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales) and were opened in 1881. In 1891 the college joined Birkbeck Institute and the Northampton Institute to form the City Polytechnic by a Charity Commissioners&#x27; scheme to facilitate funding for these institutions by the City Parochial Foundation, and to enable the three institutions to work cooperatively. However this attempted federation did not function in practice, as each institution continued to operate more or less independently. The City Polytechnic concept was dissolved in 1906 and the City of London College came under the supervision of London County Council.
In December 1940, the college&#x27;s building was destroyed by a German air raid. City of London College subsequently moved into premises at 84 Moorgate in 1944. In 1948, the City of London College celebrated its centenary with a service of thanksgiving addressed by the Archbishop of Canterbury at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. In 1970 the college merged with Sir John Cass College to form the City of London Polytechnic. In 1977, it also became the home of the Fawcett Society library, afterwards the Women&#x27;s Library.

Under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 the Polytechnic was awarded university status (having previously awarded degrees of the Council for National Academic Awards). It was renamed London Guildhall University, to demonstrate its links with the City of London and the City&#x27;s many guilds/livery companies. It was unassociated with the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, based at the Barbican Centre. It was ranked 30th out of the UK&#x27;s 43 new universities in the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise. In August 2004, in the midst of a contract dispute with former LGU staff following the merger with the University of North London, it was reported that the management of the merged institution had ordered the destruction of the entire print run of a history of the university – &quot;London Guildhall University: From Polytechnic to University&quot; – authored by Sean Glynn, formerly a senior research fellow in the department of Politics and Modern History; the work had been commissioned by Sir Roderick Floud, the President of London Metropolitan University, when Provost of LGU.

The former LGU campus, which was home to London Met&#x27;s Guildhall School of Business and Law until August 2019, was located at the intersection of the City of London financial district and the old East End, near Aldgate East, Tower Hill and Liverpool Street tube stations. There are buildings located at Minories, Jewry Street, Central House, Moorgate, Whitechapel High Street, Calcutta House, Commercial Road and Goulston Street. There is a gymnasium for the use of staff and students at the Whitechapel High St. building, 
===University of North London===

Founded as the Northern Polytechnic Institute in 1896, it merged in 1971 with the North Western Polytechnic which was established in 1929, to become the Polytechnic of North London. Until the passing of the Education Reform Act 1988, the Polytechnic was under the control of the Inner London Education Authority – part of the then Greater London Council and awarded the degrees of the former Council for National Academic Awards. Under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, the institution, a pioneer of widening participation and access to higher education, was granted university status and the right to award its own degrees. Following the merger with London Guildhall University, London Metropolitan University became the largest unitary university in Greater London.

The former UNL campus is now the Holloway campus and is located on Holloway Road, near Holloway Road and Highbury &amp; Islington tube stations.

===Dalai Lama Honorary Doctorate controversy===
In May 2008, London Metropolitan University presented the 14th Dalai Lama with an Honorary Doctorate of Philosophy, for &quot;promoting peace globally&quot;. This move caused controversy among the Chinese public and the overseas Chinese community, who view the Dalai Lama as partly responsible for the 2008 unrest in Tibet. As a result, Chinese migration agents had been reported to &quot;boycott&quot; London Metropolitan University in advising clients who wish to study in the UK. The university&#x27;s Vice-Chancellor, Brian Roper, in July sent a controversial public letter of apology to the Chinese Foreign Ministry via embassy officials. In an interview with the &quot;Global Times&quot;, a worker at a Chinese study abroad agency suggested that the university could repair the offence of the honours by refusing speaking platforms to Tibetan independence groups, such as the university&#x27;s own &quot;Free Tibet Society&quot;. The university has also faced criticism for offering free scholarships specifically reserved for students from the Tibetan exile community in India, Nepal and the West, in a case of non-merit &quot;racial quotas&quot;.

===Student numbers controversy===

In July 2008, it was reported that a financial crisis was looming for the university. London Met had allegedly been misreporting data on student drop-outs for several years and, consequently, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) was proposing to reclaim at least £15 million for the overpayment in 2008–9. In February 2009 the overpayment figure was revised to £56 million by HEFCE, who were seeking to recover the money.

On 19 March 2009, in response to the crisis, vice-chancellor Brian Roper resigned his position with immediate effect but continued to receive his salary until December 2009. In May 2009, Alfred Morris, former vice-chancellor of the University of the West of England and University of Wales, Lampeter, was appointed interim vice-chancellor.

The government announced in May 2009 that there would be an independent inquiry, exploring the possibility that HEFCE had colluded with London Met by failing to query implausibly low drop-out rates. The inquiry concluded in November 2009 and was reported to attribute responsibility to vice-chancellor Brian Roper, along with other senior administrators and the Board of Governors. Following completion of the report, the chair of HEFCE called on &quot;senior staff&quot; and the entire Board of Governors to resign, noting that HEFCE was not convinced that the university&#x27;s management could effectively safeguard public funds. After the deadline indicated by HEFCE chief executive Alan Langlands had expired, rumours circulated among staff and government ministers that HEFCE could withdraw funding, effectively forcing the university to close.

A report commissioned by the university, published in November 2009, found that vice-chancellor Roper bore &quot;the major responsibility and culpability&quot; for the financial situation: Roper and some members of the executive had been aware that the university had been applying its own interpretation of funding rules on student drop-outs – rather than the funding council&#x27;s – since 2003, but had taken no action. The university&#x27;s board of governors and audit committee had an oversight role, which made them ultimately &quot;accountable for a financial failure of this magnitude&quot; and this meant that they &quot;must take overall responsibility&quot;.

===2011 course changes===
In early 2011, London Metropolitan University announced an overhaul of undergraduate education for students entering courses in 2012. This included a reduction in the number of courses from 557 to 160. The announcement also signalled a move from semester-long to year-long modules, and thirty weeks of teaching, a gain of six weeks on the current average. The university argues that the longer learning time will help increase the opportunity for development and guidance before students move to final examinations. There will be a transition to this new course offering in 2011/12 and this has led to applicants for some courses being contacted and offered alternative programmes.

===Proposed alcohol-free zones===
In April 2012, Professor Malcolm Gillies, Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive, was reported to be considering creating alcohol-free zones and events to enable Muslim students (who form 20% of the student population) to take part more comfortably. This provoked criticism from the Muslim Council of Britain and the university&#x27;s Islamic societies, who described the proposal as unhelpful and &quot;divisive&quot;, but positive comments from representatives of the National Union of Students and the Federation of Student Islamic Societies.

===UK Home Office/Border Agency action, and consequences===
On 16 July 2012, the UK Border Agency of the Home Office suspended the university&#x27;s &quot;highly-trusted status&quot; with the Border Agency, a status required in order for the university to be eligible to sponsor both new student visa applications as well as existing student visas, for foreign students from outside of the European Union and the European Economic Area (or Switzerland). The university was one of three institutions to have such a status suspended.

On 30 August 2012, the university&#x27;s highly trusted status was revoked, revoking the university&#x27;s right to sponsor new visa applications for non-EU/EEA foreign students, as well as revoking the existing visas of the university&#x27;s pre-existing non-European foreign students, causing them to be excluded from the university, and leaving thousands with the possibility of being forced to leave the country, unless places with alternative institutions and sponsors are secured.

The Immigration Minister, Damian Green, cited a number of reasons for the decision, including the discovery that more than a quarter of the students in the test sample did not in fact have leave to remain in the UK, that the university did not have and could not provide sufficient proof of English-language proficiency standards for some of its students, and the fact that the university was unable to confirm the attendance of its students, in some 57% of the sampled cases.

In September 2012, the university announced it was beginning legal action against the border agency over the licence issue.

In April 2013, the university regained its licence to sponsor international students for Tier 4 visas.

The High Court case against Home Office was settled in October 2013 after both parties reached an undisclosed settlement. Both parties have refused to comment on the specifics of the settlement. The last minute withdrawal of the case meant that the judicial review against the Home Office, which had been scheduled to start on 17 October 2013, would not proceed any further.

In November 2019, London Metropolitan University released a statement confirmed that University Patron Prince Andrew, Duke of York had resigned.

==Campuses==

The main university campus is on Holloway Road in the London Borough of Islington where five of the University&#x27;s Schools are based. The School of Art, Architecture and Design is based in Aldgate.

==Academic profile==
London Metropolitan offers about 160 degree courses, to students (including 7,000 overseas students from 155 countries). The university also maintains several offices abroad in Beijing, Chennai, Delhi, Dhaka, Lagos and Lahore. The university&#x27;s operations are overseen by a board of governors comprising external members and senior administrative and academic staff.

===Academic departments===
The University&#x27;s academic departments are currently arranged into six schools, where previously there were four faculties each comprising three schools. These are:

:*Guildhall School of Business and Law
:*School of Computing and Digital Media
:*School of Human Sciences
:*School of Social Professions
:*School of Social Sciences
:*School of Art, Architecture and Design

===Scholarships===
The university invests more than £700,000 annually in its scholarship programme to help academically excellent students as well as students with outstanding achievements in various sports disciplines, such as hockey, tennis and basketball. The university gives £1000 for any of its undergraduate international students who achieve &quot;A&quot; grade marks. The university also offers postgraduate scholarships, a range of full tuition scholarships, including some scholarships with free accommodation. Scholarships are offered in conjunction the BBC World Service, International Student House and Mahatma Gandhi Foundation. The university has several student exchange programmes with academic institutions in the US and Europe, with financial support for those who participate through the Erasmus programme.

===Rankings and reputation===

In the past, the university refused to participate in newspaper league tables on the grounds that Universities should be assessed by the UK Government and not (private) newspapers. The new management reversed this policy and in the 2013 rankings (published in 2012), the university was placed 118th out of 120 universities in The Guardian University Guide 2013. In the 2011 Institutional Audit, the Quality Assurance Agency expressed &quot;reasonable confidence&quot; in the &quot;academic standards&quot; of the university&#x27;s awards. In the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise, London Metropolitan was ranked equal 107th out of 132 institutions by the Times Higher Education&#x27;s RAE league table. The university has not fared well in the past national league tables (2014/2015) and has placed last in each respective league table, Guardian University Guide 2015 (116th), Complete University Guide 2015 (123rd) and The Times and Sunday Times University League Table 2014 (121st). The university has fared better in the most recent Guardian University Guide 2024 (85th).

The architecture department was ranked 18th and 20th in 2011 and 2012 in The Guardian University League Tables. American Studies placed 20th, 17th and 18th in 2011, 2012 and more recently, at the newly published Complete University Guide 2013. The law school ranked 87th in 2011 at the Complete University Guide and rose to 85th in 2012, 75th in 2013 and most recently placed 70th out of 98 law schools at the 2014 Complete University Guide. It is also ranked 58th out of 96 in Research Assessment. The School of Art, Architecture and Design (fashion, textile and retail design courses) was ranked 4th in The Guardian University League Tables 2022.

The university also entered the QS World University Rankings (2022) of top universities in the world for the first time, placing in the 801-1000 bracket.

<text>The University of North London (UNL) was a university in London, England, formed from the Polytechnic of North London (PNL) in 1992 when that institution was granted university status. PNL, in turn, had been formed by the amalgamation of the Northern Polytechnic and North-Western Polytechnic in 1971. In 1996, the university celebrated its centenary, dating from the year of the Northern Polytechnic&#x27;s founding. UNL existed until 2002, when it merged with London Guildhall University to form London Metropolitan University. Its former premises now form the university&#x27;s north campus, on Holloway Road and Highbury Grove, Islington.

==Structure==
Under the board of governors, the university was arranged into four faculties each led by a dean and pro vice-chancellor:—

;Faculty of Environmental and Social Studies:
*School of Law, Governance and Information Management (formerly schools of Law and of Information and Communications Studies)
*School of Social Sciences (formerly Policy Studies, Politics and Social Research)
*School of Community Health, Psychology and Social Work (formerly schools of Health and of Social Work)
*School of Geography and Environmental Studies (until 1997)
*School of Architecture and Interior Design
;Faculty of Humanities and Teacher Education: 
*School of Arts and Humanities (formerly Historical, Philosophical and Contemporary Studies)
*School of Area and Language Studies (formerly European and Language Studies)
*School of Education
;Faculty of Science, Computing and Engineering:
*School of Biological and Applied Sciences (formerly Applied Chemistry)
*School of Communications Technology and Mathematical Sciences (formerly schools of Electronic and Communications Engineering and Applied Physics and of Mathematical Studies)
*School of Informatics and Multimedia Technology (formerly Computing)
*School of Health and Sport Science (formerly Life Sciences)
*School of Polymer Technology (founded as the National College of Rubber Technology in 1948)
;The Business School

Faculties organised undergraduate and postgraduate schemes within a university modular framework. An interdisciplinary undergraduate scheme for inter-faculty combined honours degrees was managed centrally by the Academic Registry.

===Learning Centre===
In 1994, the Learning Centre library opened on the site of a former mirror factory. In 1996, the Trades Union Congress library collections, which had been established in 1922, were transferred there. It is the major research library for the study of all aspects of trade unions, collective bargaining and labour history, with both historical and contemporary coverage.

===The Rocket===
The Great Hall was officially opened by the Lord Mayor of London in 1897, as a social and academic events space catering for dances and recitals. By 1929, a proscenium arch and stage were installed and it was renamed the Theatre, playing host to operas and theatrical productions. Throughout the 1980s, it was a solid fixture on the capital&#x27;s gig circuit and an essential stop for touring bands. When electronic dance music and the club scene took hold at the turn of the decade, it was relaunched as the Rocket complex and became one of London&#x27;s leading all-nighter venues.

The 1990s also saw the building divided vertically, creating its two separate floors. In 2015, the Great Hall had its name and grandeur restored, with the Rocket now referring exclusively to the ground floor café bar and adjacent courtyard garden.

===Vice-chancellors===
The vice-chancellor and chief executive was supported by the deputy vice-chancellor (academic) and the deputy vice-chancellor (research and development).
In 2000, the university awarded an honorary degree to Desmond Tutu, Archbishop of Cape Town and primate of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa, in a special ceremony.

Following the merger with London Guildhall (formerly the City of London Polytechnic), London Metropolitan became the largest unitary university in London.

==History==

===Northern Polytechnic Institute===

The Northern Polytechnic opened in Holloway with aid from the City Parochial Foundation and substantial donations from the Worshipful Company of Clothworkers in 1896. Under the terms of its royal charter, its objective was &quot;to promote the industrial skill, general knowledge, health and well-being of young men and women belonging to the poorer classes of Islington [and] to provide for the inhabitants of Islington and the neighbouring parts of north London, and especially for the Industrial Classes, the means of acquiring a sound General, Scientific, Technical and Commercial Education at small cost.&quot;

The founding principal of the institute was the chemist John Thomas Dunn. He appointed Victor Alessandro Mundella as its first Professor of Physics and Head of the Department of Physics and Electrical Engineering.

By 1911, five-year University of London evening degrees were available. The modernist Cecil Stephenson was appointed head of art in 1923 and, from 1925, courses were recognised by the Royal Institute of British Architects.

====NPI alumni====
*Walter Hassan, British automotive engineer and engine specialist for Bentley, Jaguar Cars, and Coventry Climax

===North Western Polytechnic===

The North Western Polytechnic was eventually opened by the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) at Prince of Wales Road, Kentish Town in 1929. The polytechnic later acquired premises at St Pancras, Highbury (Ladbroke House) and 207–225 Essex Road. Concentrating on social sciences, humanities and arts, by 1967, when the printing department transferred to the London College of Printing (a founding member of the London Institute), the North-Western was the largest polytechnic in London.

====NWP alumni====
*Alfred Hayes, professional wrestler under the name &quot;Lord Alfred Hayes&quot;
* Aminu Bashir Wali, Nigerian Minister of Foreign Affairs (2014–2015)
*Alison Weir, author and historian

===Polytechnic of North London===

The Polytechnic of North London was founded by the 1971 merger of the Northern and North-Western polytechnics. Its first director was Terence Miller, former principal of the University of Rhodesia. Until the passing of the Education Reform Act 1988, it came under the control of the Inner London Education Authority, part of the then Greater London Council. Degree awarding authority resided with the former Council for National Academic Awards until the polytechnic, a pioneer of widening participation and access to higher education, was granted university status in 1992.

After leaving Oxford in 1964, the renowned historian A. J. P. Taylor lectured at the polytechnic until his death in 1990.

====The Harrington affair====
In 1984, Patrick Harrington, a prominent member of the National Front and deputy editor of &quot;NF News&quot;, was the subject of protests by fellow students who picketed and boycotted his lectures, arguing that his presence made life intolerable for ethnic minority students. Disputing this, Harrington obtained an injunction which the protesters, backed by the students&#x27; union, ignored. At one stage the president of the National Union of Students, Phil Woolas, reported that the polytechnic was &quot;simply not functioning any more,&quot; with lecturers defying the courts by refusing to give names of students on demonstrations. Two student leaders were sent to prison for 16 days for contempt of the court order preventing them from barring Harrington and the Secretary of State for Education, Sir Keith Joseph, threatened to close the polytechnic down.

In December, David MacDowall, then director, resigned after pressure from the Inner London Education Authority to make a complaint against Harrington for remarks he made in a radio interview. ILEA said the remarks were racist, which Harrington denied. In his resignation letter, MacDowall admitted that he had acted &quot;in a totally fascistic manner&quot; over the issue and wished &quot;all the picketing students the best of luck with their campaign.&quot; Harrington subsequently faced a disciplinary hearing for a television interview in which, in line with NF policy, he questioned the right of black people to citizenship. In January 1985, with a new director, John Beishon, in post and final examinations approaching, the polytechnic, students&#x27; union and Harrington agreed a deal in which his classes would be taught separately in another building. He eventually graduated with a degree in philosophy. Beishon remained at PNL for three years.

<text>A decision cycle or decision loop is a sequence of steps used by an entity on a repeated basis to reach and implement decisions and to learn from the results. The &quot;decision cycle&quot; phrase has a history of use to broadly categorize various methods of making decisions, going upstream to the need, downstream to the outcomes, and cycling around to connect the outcomes to the needs.

==Overview==

A decision cycle is said to occur when an explicitly specified decision model is used to guide a decision and then the outcomes of that decision are assessed against the need for the decision. This cycle includes specification of desired results (the decision need), tracking of outcomes, and assessment of outcomes against the desired results.

==Examples of decision cycles==

* In quality control, PDCA (Plan–Do–Check–Act) is used.
* In science, the scientific method (Observation–Hypothesis–Experiment–Evaluation) can also be seen as a decision cycle.
* In the United States Armed Forces, a theory of an OODA loop (Observe–Orient–Decide–Act) has been advocated by Colonel John Boyd.
* In the lean startup methodology, the Build-Measure-Learn loop is used to guide product development.
* In management, Herbert A. Simon proposed a decision cycle of three steps (Intelligence–Design–Choice). Much later, other scholars expanded his framework to five steps (Intelligence–Design–Choice–Implementation–Learning).
* In design thinking, the design process is often conceived as a decision cycle (or design cycle), such as Robert McKim&#x27;s ETC (Express–Test–Cycle).
* In the Getting Things Done time management method, workflow consists of a cycle of five stages (Collect–Process–Organize–Do–Review).
* In the nursing process, the ADPIE (Assessment–Diagnosis–Planning–Implementation–Evaluation) process is used. Alternatively, the ASPIRE (Assessment–Systematic Nursing Diagnosis–Planning–Implementation–Recheck–Evaluation) model includes an additional stage—Recheck—in between Implementation and Evaluation.
* In psychotherapy, the transtheoretical model posits five stages of intentional change (Precontemplation–Contemplation–Preparation–Action–Maintenance). These stages were initially conceived as linear, but John C. Norcross said that for many people the stages are more appropriately viewed as a cycle (Psych–Prep–Perspire–Persist–Relapse).
* In USAID, the use of a program cycle, &quot;codified in the Automated Directive Systems (ADS) 201, is USAID&#x27;s operational model for planning, delivering, assessing, and adapting development programming in a given region or country to achieve more effective and sustainable results in order to advance U.S. foreign policy&quot;. Relatedly, within the agency there exists resources regarding adaptive management decision cycles.

<doc id="163161" wikidata="Q3080407" url="?curid=163161" title="John Boyd (military strategist)">
<text>John Richard Boyd (January 23, 1927 – March 9, 1997) was a United States Air Force fighter pilot and Pentagon consultant during the second half of the 20th century. His theories have been highly influential in military, business, and litigation strategies and planning.

As part of the Fighter Mafia, Boyd inspired the Lightweight Fighter program (LWF), which produced the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and preceded McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet. Boyd, together with Thomas Christie, created the Energy–Maneuverability theory of aerial combat, which became the world standard for the design of fighter aircraft. He also developed the decision cycle known as the OODA loop, the process by which an entity reacts to an event.

==Early life==
Boyd was born on January 23, 1927, in Erie, Pennsylvania. He was one of five children born to Elsie Beyer Boyd and Hubert Boyd. Hubert was raised Catholic and Elsie was a German Presbyterian.

Boyd enlisted in the Army Air Forces on October 30, 1944, while he was still a junior in high school. After graduation, he completed his basic training and skill training as an aircraft turret mechanic during the waning months of World War II. From January 1946 to January 1947, Boyd served as a swimming instructor in Japan. He attained the rank of sergeant, and served in the Air Force Reserve until he graduated from college. He graduated from the University of Iowa in 1951 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics and later earned a second bachelor&#x27;s degree in industrial engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology.

==Air Force career==
Boyd was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Air Force following completion of the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps program at the University of Iowa. On March 27, 1953, Boyd arrived in Korea as an F-86 Sabre pilot. In the two months until the Korean War armistice on July 27, Boyd flew 22 missions in F-86 Sabres, in which he did not fire his guns or score a kill. After his service in Korea, he was invited to attend the Fighter Weapons School (FWS). Boyd attended the school and graduated at the top of his class. Upon graduation, he was invited to stay at the FWS as an instructor. He became head of the Academic Section and wrote the tactics manual for the school.
Boyd was brought to the Pentagon by Major General Arthur C. Agan Jr. to do mathematical analysis that would support the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle program in order to pass the Office of the Secretary of Defense&#x27;s systems analysis process.
He was dubbed &quot;Forty Second Boyd&quot; for his standing bet as an instructor pilot that beginning from a position of disadvantage, he could defeat any opposing pilot in air combat maneuvering in less than 40 seconds. According to his biographer, Robert Coram, Boyd was also known at different points of his career as &quot;The Mad Major&quot; for the intensity of his passions, as &quot;Genghis John&quot; for his confrontational style of interpersonal discussion, and as the &quot;Ghetto Colonel&quot; for his spartan lifestyle.

During the Vietnam War, he served as Vice Commander of Task Force Alpha and as Commander of the 56th Combat Support Group at Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base in Thailand from April 1972 to April 1973.

==Military theories==
In the early 1960s, Boyd, together with Thomas Christie, a civilian mathematician, created the energy–maneuverability theory, or E-M theory, of aerial combat. A legendary by reputation, Boyd was said to have stolen the IBM 704 computer time to do the millions of calculations necessary to prove the theory. A civilian employee had previously barred Boyd from performing the calculations, but Thomas P. Christie provided Boyd a project number. An investigating inspector general commended Boyd and his computer work. E-M theory became the world standard for the design of fighter aircraft. The Air Force&#x27;s FX project (subsequently the F-15) was then floundering, but Boyd&#x27;s deployment orders to Vietnam were canceled, and he was brought to the Pentagon to redo the tradeoff studies according to E-M theory. His work helped save the project from being a costly dud even though its final product was larger and heavier than he had desired.

With Colonel Everest Riccioni and Pierre Sprey, Boyd formed a small advocacy group within Headquarters USAF that dubbed itself the &quot;Fighter Mafia.&quot; Riccioni was an Air Force fighter pilot assigned to a staff position in Research and Development, and Sprey was a civilian statistician working in systems analysis. While assigned to working on the beginnings of the F-15, then called the Blue Bird, Boyd disagreed with the direction the program was going and proposed an alternative &quot;Red Bird&quot;. The concept was for a clear-weather air-to-air-only fighter with a top speed of Mach 1.6, rather than the Blue Bird&#x27;s Mach 2.5+. The top speed would be sacrificed for lower weight (and therefore better maneuverability and lower cost). Both Boyd and Sprey also argued against an active radar and radar-guided missiles, and they proposed the concept to Air Staff. The proposal went unheeded, and there were no changes to the Blue Bird.

The Secretary of Defense, attracted by the idea of a low cost fighter, gave funding to Riccioni for a study project on the Lightweight Fighter program (LWF), which became the F-16. Both the Department of Defense and the Air Force went ahead with the program and stipulated a &quot;design to cost&quot; basis no more than $3 million per copy over 300 aircraft. The USAF considered the idea of a &quot;hi-lo&quot; mix force structure and expanded the LWF program. The program soon went against the Fighter Mafia&#x27;s vision since it was not the stripped-down air-to-air specialist that they had envisioned but a heavier multi-role fighter-bomber with advanced avionics, an active radar, and radar-guided missiles.
Harry Hillaker, an F-16 designer, remarked that he would have designed the plane differently if he had known that it would become a multi mission aircraft.

Boyd is credited for largely developing the strategy for the invasion of Iraq in the Gulf War of 1991. In 1981, Boyd had presented his briefing, &quot;Patterns of Conflict&quot;, to US Representative Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Cheney. By 1990, Boyd had moved to Florida because of declining health, but Cheney, now Defense Secretary in the George H. W. Bush administration, called Boyd back to work on the plans for Operation Desert Storm. Boyd had substantial influence on the ultimate &quot;left hook&quot; design of the plan.

In a letter to the editor of &quot;Inside the Pentagon&quot;, the former Commandant of the Marine Corps General Charles C. Krulak is quoted as saying, &quot;The Iraqi army collapsed morally and intellectually under the onslaught of American and Coalition forces. John Boyd was an architect of that victory as surely as if he&#x27;d commanded a fighter wing or a maneuver division in the desert.&quot;

===OODA loop===
The observation Boyd made based on his experience in Thailand during the Vietnam War was that in future conflicts, the attrition-firepower model of warfare that had prevailed since the Industrial Revolution would become less important, and the ability to rapidly and accurately acquire and act on information would take on greater importance. The key concept he developed in the early 1970s as a result of this observation was the decision making cycle or OODA loop, the process by which an entity (either an individual or an organization) reacts to an event. The OODA loop has since been used as the core for a theory of litigation strategy that unifies the use of cognitive science and game theory to shape the actions of witnesses and opposing counsel. It has also been proposed as a tool for work-based learning and management education.

===Aerial Attack Study===
Boyd also served to revolutionize air-to-air combat in that he was the author of the Aerial Attack Study, which became the official tactics manual for fighter aircraft. Boyd changed how pilots thought; prior to his tactics manual, pilots had thought that air-to-air combat was far too complex to ever be fully understood. With the release of the Aerial Attack Study, pilots realized that the high-stakes death dance of aerial combat was solved. Boyd said that a pilot going into aerial combat must know two things: the position of the enemy and the velocity of the enemy. Given the velocity of an enemy, a pilot can decide what the enemy can do. When a pilot knows what maneuvers the enemy can perform, he can then decide how to counter any of the other pilot&#x27;s actions.

===Military reform===
Boyd gave testimony to Congress about the status of military reform after Operation Desert Storm.

===Maneuver warfare and Marines===
In January 1980 Boyd gave his briefing &quot;Patterns of Conflict&quot; at the US Marines AWS (Amphibious Warfare School), which led to the instructor, Michael Wyly, and Boyd changing the curriculum. That was with the blessing of General Trainor, who later asked Wyly to write a new tactics manual for the Marines.

Wyly, along with Pierre Sprey, Raymond J. &quot;Ray&quot; Leopold, Franklin &quot;Chuck&quot; Spinney, Jim Burton, and Tom Christie, were described by writer Coram as Boyd&#x27;s &quot;acolytes&quot;.

== Later career ==
At his retirement in 1975, Boyd was awarded the prestigious Harold Brown Award by the US Air Force.

==Death==
Boyd died of cancer in Florida on March 9, 1997, at age 70. He was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery on March 20, 1997. His burial site is Section 60, Gravesite 3660.

==Awards and decorations==
During his lengthy career, Boyd earned many decorations, including:

<doc id="163162" wikidata="Q334029" url="?curid=163162" title="Battle of Bunker Hill">
<text>The Battle of Bunker Hill was fought on June 17, 1775, during the Siege of Boston in the first stage of the American Revolutionary War. The battle is named after Bunker Hill in Charlestown, Massachusetts, which was peripherally involved. It was the original objective of both the colonial and British troops, though the majority of combat took place on the adjacent hill which became known as Breed&#x27;s Hill.

On June 13, 1775, the leaders of the colonial forces besieging Boston learned that the British were planning to send troops out from the city to fortify the unoccupied hills surrounding the city, which would give them control of Boston Harbor. In response, 1,200 colonial troops under the command of William Prescott stealthily occupied Bunker Hill and Breed&#x27;s Hill. They constructed a strong redoubt on Breed&#x27;s Hill overnight, as well as smaller fortified lines across the Charlestown Peninsula.

By daybreak of June 17, the British became aware of the presence of colonial forces on the Peninsula and mounted an attack against them. Two assaults on the colonial positions were repulsed with significant British casualties but the redoubt was captured on their third assault, after the defenders ran out of ammunition. The colonists retreated over Bunker Hill, leaving the British in control of the Peninsula.

The battle was a tactical victory for the British, but it proved to be a sobering experience for them; they incurred many more casualties than the Americans had sustained, including many officers. The battle had demonstrated that inexperienced militia were able to stand up to regular army troops in battle. Subsequently, the battle discouraged the British from any further frontal attacks against well defended front lines. American casualties were much fewer, although their losses included General Joseph Warren and Major Andrew McClary, the final casualty of the battle.

The battle led the British to adopt a more cautious planning and maneuver execution in future engagements, which was evident in the subsequent New York and New Jersey campaign. The costly engagement also convinced the British of the need to hire substantial numbers of Hessian auxiliaries to bolster their strength in the face of the new and formidable Continental Army.

==Geography==
Boston was situated on a peninsula at the time and was largely protected from close approach by the expanses of water surrounding it, which were dominated by British warships. In the aftermath of the battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, the colonial militia of some 15,000 men had surrounded the town and besieged it under the command of Artemas Ward. They controlled the only land access to Boston itself (the Roxbury Neck), but they were unable to contest British domination of the waters of the harbor. The British troops occupied the city, a force of about 6,000 under the command of General Thomas Gage, and they were able to be resupplied and reinforced by sea.

However, the land across the water from Boston contained a number of hills which could be used to advantage. Artillery could be placed on the hills and used to bombard the city until the occupying army evacuated it or surrendered. It was with this in mind that Henry Knox led the noble train of artillery to transport cannon from Fort Ticonderoga.

The Charlestown Peninsula to the north of Boston started from a short, narrow isthmus known as the Charlestown Neck and extended about southeastward into Boston Harbor. Bunker Hill had an elevation of and lay at the northern end of the peninsula. Breed&#x27;s Hill had a height of and was more southerly and nearer to Boston. The American soldiers were at an advantage due to the height of Breed&#x27;s Hill and Bunker Hill, but it also essentially trapped them at the top. The settled part of the town of Charlestown occupied flats at the southern end of the peninsula. At its closest approach, less than separated the Charlestown Peninsula from the Boston Peninsula, where Copp&#x27;s Hill was at about the same height as Breed&#x27;s Hill. The British retreat from Concord had ended in Charlestown, but General Gage did not fortify the hills on the peninsula but instead withdrew his troops to Boston, turning the entire Charlestown Peninsula into a no man&#x27;s land.

==British planning==
The British received reinforcements throughout May until they reached a strength of about 6,000 men. Generals William Howe, John Burgoyne, and Henry Clinton arrived on May 25 aboard . Gage began planning with them to break out of the city, finalizing a plan on June 12. This plan began with taking the Dorchester Neck, fortifying the Dorchester Heights, and then marching on the colonial forces stationed in Roxbury. Once the southern flank had been secured, the Charlestown heights would be taken, and the forces in Cambridge driven away. The attack was set for June 18.

On June 13, the Committee of Safety in Exeter, New Hampshire, notified the Massachusetts Provincial Congress that a New Hampshire gentleman &quot;of undoubted veracity&quot; had overheard the British commanders making plans to capture Dorchester and Charlestown. On June 15, the Massachusetts Committee of Safety decided that additional defenses needed to be erected. General Ward directed General Israel Putnam to set up defenses on the Charlestown Peninsula, specifically on Bunker Hill.

==Prelude to battle==

===Fortification of Breed&#x27;s Hill===

On the night of June 16, colonial Colonel William Prescott led about 1,200 men onto the peninsula in order to set up positions from which artillery fire could be directed into Boston. This force was made up of men from the regiments of Prescott, Putnam (the unit was commanded by Thomas Knowlton), James Frye, and Ebenezer Bridge. At first, Putnam, Prescott, and their engineer Captain Richard Gridley disagreed as to where they should locate their defense. Some work was performed on Bunker Hill, but Breed&#x27;s Hill was closer to Boston and viewed as being more defensible, and they decided to build their primary redoubt there. Prescott and his men began digging a square fortification about on a side with ditches and earthen walls. The walls of the redoubt were about high, with a wooden platform inside on which men could stand and fire over the walls.

The works on Breed&#x27;s Hill did not go unnoticed by the British. General Clinton was out on reconnaissance that night and was aware of them, and he tried to convince Gage and Howe that they needed to prepare to attack the position at daylight. British sentries were also aware of the activity, but most apparently did not think it cause for alarm. A sentry on board spotted the new fortification around 4 a.m. and notified his captain. &quot;Lively&quot; opened fire, temporarily halting the colonists&#x27; work. Admiral Samuel Graves awoke aboard his flagship , irritated by the gunfire that he had not ordered. He stopped it, only to have General Gage countermand his decision when he became fully aware of the situation in the morning. He ordered all 128 guns in the harbor to fire on the colonial position, along with batteries atop Copp&#x27;s Hill in Boston. The barrage had relatively little effect, as the hilltop fortifications were high enough to frustrate accurate aiming from the ships and far enough from Copp&#x27;s Hill to render the batteries there ineffective. The shots that did manage to land, however, were able to kill one American soldier and damage the entire supply of water brought for the troops.

The rising sun also alerted Prescott to a significant problem with the location of the redoubt: it could easily be flanked on either side. He promptly ordered his men to begin constructing a breastwork running down the hill to the east, deciding that he did not have the manpower to also build additional defenses to the west of the redoubt.

===British preparations===
The British generals met to discuss their options. General Clinton had urged an attack as early as possible, and he preferred an attack beginning from the Charlestown Neck that would cut off the colonists&#x27; retreat, reducing the process of capturing the new redoubt to one of starving out its occupants. However, he was outvoted by the other three generals, who were concerned that his plan violated the convention of the time to not allow one&#x27;s army to become trapped between enemy forces. Howe was the senior officer present and would lead the assault, and he was of the opinion that the hill was &quot;open and easy of ascent and in short would be easily carried.&quot; General Burgoyne concurred, arguing that the &quot;untrained rabble&quot; would be no match for their &quot;trained troops&quot;. Orders were then issued to prepare the expedition.

General Gage surveyed the works from Boston with his staff, and Loyalist Abijah Willard recognized his brother-in-law Colonel Prescott. &quot;Will he fight?&quot; asked Gage. &quot;As to his men, I cannot answer for them,&quot; replied Willard, &quot;but Colonel Prescott will fight you to the gates of hell.&quot; Prescott lived up to Willard&#x27;s word, but his men were not so resolute. When the colonists suffered their first casualty, Prescott gave orders to bury the man quickly and quietly, but a large group of men gave him a solemn funeral instead, with several deserting shortly thereafter.

It took six hours for the British to organize an infantry force and to gather up and inspect the men on parade. General Howe was to lead the major assault, driving around the colonial left flank and taking them from the rear. Brigadier General Robert Pigot on the British left flank would lead the direct assault on the redoubt, and Major John Pitcairn would lead the flank or reserve force. It took several trips in longboats to transport Howe&#x27;s initial forces (consisting of about 1,500 men) to the eastern corner of the peninsula, known as Moulton&#x27;s Point. By 2 p.m., Howe&#x27;s chosen force had landed. However, while crossing the river, Howe noted the large number of colonial troops on top of Bunker Hill. He believed these to be reinforcements and immediately sent a message to Gage, requesting additional troops. He then ordered some of the light infantry to take a forward position along the eastern side of the peninsula, alerting the colonists to his intended course of action. The troops then sat down to eat while they waited for the reinforcements.

===Colonists reinforce their positions===
Prescott saw the British preparations and called for reinforcements. Among the reinforcements were Joseph Warren, the popular young leader of the Massachusetts Committee of Safety, and Seth Pomeroy, an aging Massachusetts militia leader. Both of these men held commissions of rank, but chose to serve as infantry. Prescott ordered the Connecticut men under Captain Knowlton to defend the left flank, where they used a crude dirt wall as a breastwork and topped it with fence rails and hay. They also constructed three small v-shaped trenches between this dirt wall and Prescott&#x27;s breastwork. Troops that arrived to reinforce this flank position included about 200 men from the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments under Colonels John Stark and James Reed. Stark&#x27;s men did not arrive until after Howe landed his forces, and thus filled a gap in the defense that Howe could have taken advantage of, had he pressed his attack sooner. They took positions along the breastwork on the northern end of the colonial position. Low tide opened a gap along the Mystic River to the north, so they quickly extended the fence with a short stone wall to the water&#x27;s edge. Colonel Stark placed a stake about in front of the fence and ordered that no one fire until the British regulars passed it. Further reinforcements arrived just before the battle, including portions of Massachusetts regiments of Colonels Brewer, Nixon, Woodbridge, Little, and Major Moore, as well as Callender&#x27;s company of artillery.

Confusion reigned behind the Colonial lines. Many units sent toward the action stopped before crossing the Charlestown Neck from Cambridge, which was under constant fire from gun batteries to the south. Others reached Bunker Hill, but then were uncertain where to go from there and just milled around. One commentator wrote of the scene that &quot;it appears to me there never was more confusion and less command.&quot; General Putnam was on the scene attempting to direct affairs, but unit commanders often misunderstood or even disobeyed orders.

==British assault==
By 3 p.m., the British reinforcements had arrived, which included the 47th Regiment of Foot and the 1st Marines, and the British were ready to march. Brigadier General Pigot&#x27;s force were gathering just south of Charlestown village, and they were already taking casualties from sniper fire from the settlement. Howe asked Admiral Graves for assistance in clearing out the snipers. Graves had planned for such a possibility and ordered a carcass fired into the village, and then sent a landing party to set fire to the town. The smoke billowing from Charlestown lent an almost surreal backdrop to the fighting, as the winds were such that the smoke was kept from the field of battle.

General Howe led the light infantry companies and grenadiers in the assault on the American left flank along the rail fence, expecting an easy effort against Stark&#x27;s recently arrived troops. His light infantry were set along the narrow beach, in column formation, in order to turn the far left flank of the colonial position. The grenadiers were deployed in the center, lining up four deep and several hundred across. Pigot was commanding the 5th, 38th, 43rd, 47th, and 52nd regiments, as well as Major Pitcairn&#x27;s Marines; they were to feint an assault on the redoubt. Just before the British advanced, the American position along the rail fence was reinforced by two pieces of artillery from Bunker Hill.

Howe had intended the advance to be preceded by an artillery bombardment from the field pieces present, but it was soon discovered that these cannon had been supplied with the wrong caliber of ammunition, delaying the assault. Attacking Breed&#x27;s Hill presented an array of difficulties. The hay on the hillside had not been harvested, requiring that the regulars marched through waist-high grass which concealed the uneven terrain beneath. The pastureland of the hillside was covered with crisscrossing rail fences hampering the cohesion of marching formations. The regulars were loaded down with gear wholly unnecessary for the attack, and the British troops were overheating in their wool uniforms under the heat of the afternoon sun, compounded by the nearby inferno from Charlestown.

The colonists withheld their fire until the regulars were within at least 50 paces of their position. As the regulars closed in range, they suffered heavy casualties from colonial fire. The colonists benefited from the rail fence to steady and aim their muskets, and enjoyed a modicum of cover from return fire. Under this withering fire, the light companies melted away and retreated, some as far as their boats. James Abercrombie, commanding the Grenadiers, was fatally wounded. Pigot&#x27;s attacks on the redoubt and breastworks fared little better; by stopping and exchanging fire with the colonists, the regulars were fully exposed and suffered heavy losses. They continued to be harried by snipers in Charlestown, and Pigot ordered a retreat after seeing what happened to Howe&#x27;s advance.

The regulars reformed on the field and marched out again, this time navigating a field strewn with dead and wounded comrades. This time, Pigot was not to feint; he was to assault the redoubt directly, possibly without the assistance of Howe&#x27;s force. Howe advanced against Knowlton&#x27;s position along the rail fence, instead of marching against Stark&#x27;s position along the beach. The outcome of the second attack was very much the same as the first. One British observer wrote, &quot;Most of our Grenadiers and Light-infantry, the moment of presenting themselves lost three-fourths, and many nine-tenths, of their men. Some had only eight or nine men a company left.&quot; Pigot&#x27;s attack did not enjoy any greater success than Howe, and he ordered a retreat after almost 30 minutes of firing ineffective volleys at the colonial position. The second attack had failed.

Meanwhile, confusion continued in the rear of the colonial forces. General Putnam tried with limited success to send additional troops from Bunker Hill to the forward positions on Breed&#x27;s Hill to support the embattled regiments. One colonial observer wrote to Samuel Adams afterwards, &quot;it appears to me that there was never more confusion and less command&quot;. Some companies and leaderless groups of men moved toward the field; others retreated. They were running low on powder and ammunition, and the colonial regiments suffered from a hemorrhage of deserters. By the time that the third attack came, there were only 700–800 men left on Breed&#x27;s Hill, with only 150 in the redoubt. Connecticut&#x27;s Captain John Chester saw an entire company in retreat and ordered his company to aim muskets at them to halt the retreat; they turned about and headed back to the battlefield.

The British rear was also in disarray. Wounded soldiers that were mobile had made their way to the landing areas and were being ferried back to Boston, while the wounded lying on the field of battle were the source of moans and cries of pain. Howe sent word to Clinton in Boston for additional troops. Clinton had observed the first two attacks and sent around 400 men from the 2nd Marines and the 63rd Foot, and followed himself to help rally the troops. In addition to these reserves, he convinced around 200 walking wounded to form up for the third attack.

The third assault was to concentrate squarely on the redoubt, with only a feint on the colonists&#x27; flank. Howe ordered his men to remove their heavy packs and leave all unnecessary equipment behind. He arrayed his forces in column formation rather than the extended order of the first two assaults, exposing fewer men along the front to colonial fire. The third attack was made at the point of the bayonet and successfully carried the redoubt; however, the final volleys of fire from the colonists cost the life of Major Pitcairn. The defenders had run out of ammunition, reducing the battle to close combat. The advantage turned to the British, as their troops were equipped with bayonets on their muskets, while most of the colonists were not. Colonel Prescott, one of the last men to leave the redoubt, parried bayonet thrusts with his normally ceremonial sabre. It is during the retreat from the redoubt that Joseph Warren was killed.

The retreat of much of the colonial forces from the peninsula was made possible in part by the controlled withdrawal of the forces along the rail fence, led by John Stark and Thomas Knowlton, which prevented the encirclement of the hill. Burgoyne described their orderly retreat as &quot;no flight; it was even covered with bravery and military skill&quot;. It was so effective that most of the wounded were saved; most of the prisoners taken by the British were mortally wounded. General Putnam attempted to reform the troops on Bunker Hill; however, the flight of the colonial forces was so rapid that artillery pieces and entrenching tools had to be abandoned. The colonists suffered most of their casualties during the retreat on Bunker Hill. By 5 p.m., the colonists had retreated over the Charlestown Neck to fortified positions in Cambridge, and the British were in control of the peninsula.

==Aftermath==

The British had taken the ground but at a great loss; they had suffered 1,054 casualties (226 dead and 828 wounded), and a disproportionate number of these were officers. The casualty count was the highest suffered by the British in any single encounter during the entire war. General Clinton echoed Pyrrhus of Epirus, remarking in his diary that &quot;A few more such victories would have shortly put an end to British dominion in America.&quot; British dead and wounded included 100 commissioned officers, a significant portion of the British officer corps in America. Much of General Howe&#x27;s field staff was among the casualties. General Gage reported the following officer casualties in his report after the battle (listing lieutenants and above by name):
* 1 lieutenant colonel killed
* 2 majors killed, 3 wounded
* 7 captains killed, 27 wounded
* 9 lieutenants killed, 32 wounded
* 15 sergeants killed, 42 wounded
* 1 drummer killed, 12 wounded

Colonial losses were about 450 in total, of whom 140 were killed. Most of the colonial losses came during the withdrawal. Major Andrew McClary was technically the highest ranking colonial officer to die in the battle; he was hit by cannon fire on Charlestown Neck, the last person to be killed in the battle. He was later commemorated by the dedication of Fort McClary in Kittery, Maine. A serious loss to the Patriot cause, however, was the death of Joseph Warren. He was the President of Massachusetts&#x27; Provincial Congress, and he had been appointed a Major General on June 14. His commission had not yet taken effect when he served as a volunteer private three days later at Bunker Hill. Only 30 men were captured by the British, most of them with grievous wounds; 20 died while held prisoner. The colonials also lost numerous shovels and other entrenching tools, as well as five out of the six cannons that they had brought to the peninsula.

==Political consequences==
When news of the battle spread through the colonies, it was reported as a colonial loss, as the ground had been taken by the enemy, and significant casualties were incurred. George Washington was on his way to Boston as the new commander of the Continental Army, and he received news of the battle while in New York City. The report included casualty figures that were somewhat inaccurate, but it gave Washington hope that his army might prevail in the conflict.

The Massachusetts Committee of Safety sought to repeat the sort of propaganda victory that it won following the battles at Lexington and Concord, so it commissioned a report of the battle to send to England. Their report, however, did not reach England before Gage&#x27;s official account arrived on July 20. His report unsurprisingly caused friction and argument between the Tories and the Whigs, but the casualty counts alarmed the military establishment, and forced many to rethink their views of colonial military capability. King George&#x27;s attitude hardened toward the colonies, and the news may have contributed to his rejection of the Continental Congress&#x27; Olive Branch Petition, the last substantive political attempt at reconciliation. Sir James Adolphus Oughton, part of the Tory majority, wrote to Lord Dartmouth of the colonies, &quot;the sooner they are made to Taste Distress the sooner will [Crown control over them] be produced, and the Effusion of Blood be put a stop to.&quot; About a month after receiving Gage&#x27;s report, the Proclamation of Rebellion was issued in response. This hardening of the British position also strengthened previously weak support for independence among Americans, especially in the southern colonies.

Gage&#x27;s report had a more direct effect on his own career. He was dismissed from office just three days after his report was received, although General Howe did not replace him until October 1775. Gage wrote another report to the British Cabinet in which he repeated earlier warnings that &quot;a large army must at length be employed to reduce these people&quot; which would require &quot;the hiring of foreign troops&quot;.

==Analysis==
General Dearborn published an account of the battle in &quot;Port Folio&quot; magazine years later, after Israel Putnam had died. Dearborn accused General Putnam of inaction, cowardly leadership, and failure to supply reinforcements during the battle, which subsequently sparked a major controversy among veterans of the war and historians. People were shocked by the rancor of the attack, and this prompted a forceful response from defenders of Putnam, including such notables as John and Abigail Adams. It also prompted Putnam&#x27;s son Daniel Putnam to defend his father using a letter of thanks written by George Washington, and statements from Colonel John Trumbull and Judge Thomas Grosvenor in Putnam&#x27;s defense. Historian Harold Murdock wrote that Dearborn&#x27;s account &quot;abounds in absurd misstatements and amazing flights of imagination.&quot; The Dearborn attack received considerable attention because at the time he was in the middle of considerable controversy himself. He had been relieved of one of the top commands in the War of 1812 due to his mistakes. He had also been nominated to serve as Secretary of War by President James Monroe, but was rejected by the United States Senate (which was the first time that the Senate had voted against confirming a presidential cabinet choice).

===Disposition of Colonial forces===

The colonial regiments were under the overall command of General Ward, with General Putnam and Colonel Prescott leading in the field, but they often acted quite independently. This was evident in the opening stages of the battle, when a tactical decision was made that had strategic implications. Colonel Prescott and his staff decided to fortify Breed&#x27;s Hill rather than Bunker Hill, apparently in contravention of orders. The fortification of Breed&#x27;s Hill was more militarily provocative; it would have put offensive artillery closer to Boston, directly threatening the city. It also exposed the forces there to the possibility of being trapped, as they probably could not properly defend against attempts by the British to land troops and take control of Charlestown Neck. If the British had taken that step, they might have had a victory with many fewer casualties. The colonial fortifications were haphazardly arrayed; it was not until the morning that Prescott discovered that the redoubt could be easily flanked, compelling the hasty construction of a rail fence. Furthermore, the colonists did not have the manpower to defend to the west.

Manpower was a further problem on Breed&#x27;s Hill. The defenses were thin toward the northern end of the colonial position and could have been easily exploited by the British (as they had already landed), had reinforcements not arrived in time. The front lines of the colonial forces were generally well-managed, but the scene behind them was significantly disorganized, at least in part due to a poor chain of command and logistical organization. One commentator wrote: &quot;it appears to me there never was more confusion and less command.&quot; Only some of the militias operated directly under Ward&#x27;s and Putnam&#x27;s authority, and some commanders directly disobeyed orders, remaining at Bunker Hill rather than committing to the defense of Breed&#x27;s Hill once fighting began. Several officers were subjected to court martial and cashiered after the battle.

Once combat began, desertion was a chronic issue for the colonial troops. By the time of the third British assault, there were only 700–800 troops left, with only 150 in the redoubt. Colonel Prescott was of the opinion that the third assault would have been repulsed, had his forces in the redoubt been reinforced with more men, or if more supplies of ammunition and powder had been brought forward from Bunker Hill. Despite these issues, the withdrawal of the colonial forces was generally well-managed, recovering most of their wounded in the process, and elicited praise from British generals such as Burgoyne. However, the speed of the withdrawal precipitated leaving behind their artillery and entrenching tools.

===Disposition of British forces===
The British leadership acted slowly once the works were spotted on Breed&#x27;s Hill. It was 2 p.m. when the troops were ready for the assault, roughly ten hours after the &quot;Lively&quot; first opened fire. This leisurely pace gave the colonial forces ample time to reinforce the flanking positions that would have otherwise been poorly defended and vulnerable. Gage and Howe decided that a frontal assault on the works would be a simple matter, although an encircling move, gaining control of Charlestown Neck, would have given them a more rapid and resounding victory. However, the British leadership was excessively optimistic, believing that &quot;two regiments were sufficient to beat the strength of the province&quot;.

The artillery bombardment that was to have preceded the assault did not transpire because the field guns had been supplied with the wrong caliber of ammunition. Once in the field, Howe twice opted to dilute the force attacking the redoubt with flanking assaults against the colonial left. The formations that the British used were not conducive to a successful assault, arrayed in long lines and weighed down by unnecessary heavy gear; many of the troops were immediately vulnerable to colonial fire, which resulted in heavy casualties in the initial attacks. The impetus of any British attack was further diluted when officers opted to concentrate on firing repeated volleys which were simply absorbed by the earthworks and rail fences. The third attack succeeded, when the forces were arrayed in deep columns, the troops were ordered to leave all unnecessary gear behind, the attacks were to be at the point of the bayonet, and the flanking attack was merely a feint.

Following the taking of the peninsula, the British had a tactical advantage that they could have used to press into Cambridge. General Clinton proposed this to Howe, but Howe declined, having just led three assaults with grievous casualties, including most of his field staff among them. The colonial military leaders eventually recognized Howe as a tentative decision-maker, to his detriment. In the aftermath of the Battle of Long Island (1776), he again had tactical advantages that might have delivered Washington&#x27;s army into his hands, but he again refused to act.

Historian John Ferling maintains that, had General Gage used the Royal Navy to secure the narrow neck to the Charleston peninsula, cutting the Americans off from the mainland, he could have achieved a far less costly victory. But he was motivated by revenge over patriot resistance at the Battles of Lexington and Concord and relatively heavy British losses, and he also felt that the colonial militia were completely untrained and could be overtaken with little effort, opting for a frontal assault.

==&quot;The whites of their eyes&quot;==
The famous order &quot;Don&#x27;t fire until you see the whites of their eyes&quot; was popularized in stories about the battle of Bunker Hill. It is uncertain as to who said it there, since various histories, including eyewitness accounts, attribute it to Putnam, Stark, Prescott, or Gridley, and it may have been said first by one and repeated by the others. Modern scholarly consensus is nobody said it at the battle, it is a legend.

It was also not an original statement. The idea dates originally to the general-king Gustavus Adolphus (1594–1632) who gave standing orders to his musketeers &quot;never to give fire, till they could see their own image in the pupil of their enemy&#x27;s eye&quot;. Gustavus Adolphus&#x27;s military teachings were widely admired and imitated and caused this saying to be often repeated. It was used by General James Wolfe on the Plains of Abraham when his troops defeated Montcalm&#x27;s army on September 13, 1759. The earliest similar quotation came from the Battle of Dettingen on June 27, 1743, where Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Andrew Agnew of Lochnaw warned the Royal Scots Fusiliers not to fire until they could &quot;see the white of their e&#x27;en.&quot; The phrase was also used by Prince Charles of Prussia in 1745, and repeated in 1755 by Frederick the Great, and may have been mentioned in histories with which the colonial military leaders were familiar. Whether or not it was actually said in this battle, it was clear that the colonial military leadership were regularly reminding their troops to hold their fire until the moment when it would have the greatest effect, especially in situations where their ammunition would be limited.

==Notable participants==
A significant number of notable American patriots fought in this battle. Henry Dearborn and William Eustis, for example, went on to distinguished military and political careers; both served in Congress, the Cabinet, and in diplomatic posts. Others, like John Brooks, Henry Burbeck, Christian Febiger, Thomas Knowlton, and John Stark, became well known for later actions in the war. Stark became known as the &quot;Hero of Bennington&quot; for his role in the 1777 Battle of Bennington. Free African-Americans also fought in the battle; notable examples include Barzillai Lew, Salem Poor, and Peter Salem. Another notable participant was Daniel Shays, who later became famous for his army of protest in Shays&#x27; Rebellion. Israel Potter was immortalized in &quot;Israel Potter: His Fifty Years of Exile&quot;, a novel by Herman Melville. Colonel John Paterson commanded the Massachusetts First Militia, served in Shays&#x27; Rebellion, and became a congressman from New York. Lt. Col. Seth Read, who served under John Paterson at Bunker Hill, went on to settle Geneva, New York and Erie, Pennsylvania, and was said to have been instrumental in the phrase &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; being added to U.S. coins. George Claghorn of the Massachusetts militia was shot in the knee at Bunker Hill and went on after the war to become the master builder of the USS &quot;Constitution&quot;, &quot;Old Ironsides&quot;, which is the oldest naval vessel in the world that is still commissioned and afloat.

Notable British participants in the battle were: Lt. Col. Samuel Birch, Major John Small, Lord Rawdon, General William Howe, Major John Pitcairn and General Henry Clinton.

==Commemorations==
John Trumbull&#x27;s painting, &quot;The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker Hill&quot; (displayed in lede), was created as an allegorical depiction of the battle and Warren&#x27;s death, not as an actual pictorial recording of the event. The painting shows a number of participants in the battle including a British officer, John Small, among those who stormed the redoubt, yet came to be the one holding the mortally wounded Warren and preventing a fellow redcoat from bayoneting him. He was friends of Putnam and Trumbull. Other central figures include Andrew McClary who was the last man to fall in the battle.

The Bunker Hill Monument is an obelisk that stands high on Breed&#x27;s Hill. On June 17, 1825, the fiftieth anniversary of the battle, the cornerstone of the monument was laid by the Marquis de Lafayette and an address delivered by Daniel Webster. The Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge was specifically designed to evoke this monument. There is also a statue of William Prescott showing him calming his men down.

The National Park Service operates a museum dedicated to the battle near the monument, which is part of the Boston National Historical Park. A cyclorama of the battle was added in 2007 when the museum was renovated.

In nearby Cambridge, a small granite monument just north of Harvard Yard bears this inscription: &quot;Here assembled on the night of June 16, 1775, 1200 Continental troops under command of Colonel Prescott. After prayer by President Langdon, they marched to Bunker Hill.&quot; See footnote for picture. (Samuel Langdon, a Congregational minister, was Harvard&#x27;s 11th president.) Another small monument nearby marks the location of the Committee of Safety, which had become the Patriots&#x27; provisional government as Tories left Cambridge. These monuments are on the lawn to the west of Harvard&#x27;s Littaeur Center, which is itself the west of Harvard&#x27;s huge Science Center. See footnote for map.

Bunker Hill Day, observed every June 17, is a legal holiday in Suffolk County, Massachusetts (which includes the city of Boston), as well as Somerville in Middlesex County. Prospect Hill, site of colonial fortifications overlooking the Charlestown Neck, is now in Somerville, which was previously part of Charlestown. State institutions in Massachusetts (such as public institutions of higher education) in Boston also celebrate the holiday. However, the state&#x27;s FY2011 budget requires that all state and municipal offices in Suffolk County be open on Bunker Hill Day and Evacuation Day.

On June 16 and 17, 1875, the centennial of the battle was celebrated with a military parade and a reception featuring notable speakers, among them General William Tecumseh Sherman and Vice President Henry Wilson. It was attended by dignitaries from across the country. Celebratory events also marked the sesquicentennial (150th anniversary) in 1925 and the bicentennial in 1975.

Over the years the Battle of Bunker Hill has been commemorated on four U.S. Postage stamps.

<text>The Niagara Bible Conference (officially called the &quot;Believers&#x27; Meeting for Bible Study&quot;) was held annually from 1875 to 1897, with the exception of 1884. 

== History ==
The Conference was founded as the Believers&#x27; Meeting for Bible Study in 1875 by evangelical pastors in the United States. The driving force behind the meeting was James H. Brookes, a Presbyterian minister from St. Louis. Brookes publicized the meeting through his magazine &quot;Truth&quot;, and devoted substantial space to summaries of the speeches.

Most of the speakers were dispensationalists, and the Niagara Conference introduced many evangelical Protestants to dispensationalist teaching. The messages generally centered on the doctrines of Christ, the Holy Spirit, the Bible, missions and prophecy. Premillennialism and dispensationalism were defended and taught. 

In 1878, 14 fundamental creeds were established by evangelical pastors. The Niagara Creed does not explicitly affirm dispensationalism, but it refers to several key dispensationalist beliefs, including the reality of the millennium, the restoration of Israel, and the distinction between the judgment of the saved and the damned. 

Starting in 1883, it was held in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario at the Queen&#x27;s Royal Hotel and its pavilion. In 1890, the Niagara Creed was officially adopted.

<doc id="163168" wikidata="Q584063" url="?curid=163168" title="Petition of Right">
<text>The Petition of Right, passed on 7 June 1628, is an English constitutional document setting out specific individual protections against the state, reportedly of equal value to Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights 1689. It was part of a wider conflict between Parliament and the Stuart monarchy that led to the 1639 to 1653 Wars of the Three Kingdoms, ultimately resolved in the 1688–89 Glorious Revolution.

Following a series of disputes with Parliament over granting taxes, in 1627 Charles I imposed &quot;forced loans&quot;, and imprisoned those who refused to pay, without trial. This was followed in 1628 by the use of martial law, forcing private citizens to feed, clothe and accommodate soldiers and sailors, which implied the king could deprive any individual of property, or freedom, without justification. It united opposition at all levels of society, particularly those elements the monarchy depended on for financial support, collecting taxes, administering justice etc, since wealth simply increased vulnerability.

A Commons committee prepared four &quot;Resolutions&quot;, declaring each of these illegal, while re-affirming Magna Carta and &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. Charles previously depended on the House of Lords for support against the Commons, but their willingness to work together forced him to accept the Petition. It marked a new stage in the constitutional crisis, since it became clear many in both Houses did not trust him, or his ministers, to interpret the law.

The Petition remains in force in the United Kingdom, and parts of the Commonwealth. It reportedly influenced elements of the Massachusetts Body of Liberties, and the Third, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh amendments to the Constitution of the United States.

==Background==
On 27 March 1625, James I died, and was succeeded by his son, Charles I. His most pressing foreign policy issue was the Thirty Years&#x27; War, particularly regaining the hereditary lands and titles of the Protestant Frederick V, Elector Palatine, who was married to Charles&#x27;s sister Elizabeth.

The pro-Spanish policy pursued by James prior to 1623 had been unpopular, inefficient and expensive, and there was widespread support for declaring war. However, money granted by Parliament for this purpose was spent on the royal household, while they also objected to the use of indirect taxes and customs duties. Charles&#x27; first Parliament wanted to review the entire system, and as a temporary measure while doing so, the Commons granted Tonnage and Poundage for twelve months, rather than the entire reign, as was customary.

Charles instructed the House of Lords to reject the bill, and adjourned Parliament on 11 July, but needing money for the war, recalled it on 1 August. However, the Commons began investigating Charles&#x27; favourite and military commander, George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, notorious for inefficiency and extravagance. When they demanded his impeachment in return for approving taxes, Charles dissolved his first parliament on 12 August 1625. The disastrous Cádiz expedition forced him to recall Parliament in 1626, but once again they demanded the impeachment of Buckingham before providing funds to finance the war, Charles adopted &quot;forced loans&quot;; those who refused to pay would be imprisoned without trial, and if they continued to resist, sent before the Privy Council.

Ruled illegal by Chief Justice Randolph Crewe, the judiciary complied only after he was dismissed. Over 70 individuals were jailed for refusing to contribute, including Thomas Darnell, John Corbet, Walter Erle, John Heveningham and Edmund Hampden, who submitted a joint petition for &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. Approved on 3 November 1627, the court ordered the five be brought before them for examination. Since it was unclear what they were charged with, the Attorney General Robert Heath attempted to get a ruling; this became known as &#x27;Darnell&#x27;s Case&#x27;, although Darnell himself withdrew.

The judges avoided the issue by denying bail, on the grounds that as there were no charges, &quot;the [prisoners] could not be freed, as the offence was probably too dangerous for public discussion&quot;. A clear defeat, Charles decided not to pursue charges; since his opponents included the previous Chief Justice, and other senior legal officers, the ruling meant the loans would almost certainly be deemed illegal. So many now refused payment, the reduction in projected income forced him to recall Parliament in 1628, while the controversy returned &quot;a preponderance of MPs opposed to the King&quot;.

To fund his army, Charles resorted to martial law. This was a process employed for short periods by his predecessors, specifically to deal with internal rebellions, or imminent threat of invasion, clearly not the case here. Intended to allow local commanders to try soldiers or insurgents outside normal courts, it was now extended to require civilians to feed, house and clothe military personnel, known as &#x27;Coat and conduct money.&#x27; As with forced loans, this deprived individuals of personal property, subject to arbitrary detention if they protested.

In a society that valued stability, predictability, and conformity, the parliament assembled in March claimed to be confirming established and customary law, implying both James and Charles had attempted to alter it. On 1 April, a Commons committee began preparing four resolutions, led by Edward Coke, a former Chief Justice, and most respected lawyer of the age. One protected individuals from taxation not authorised by Parliament, like forced loans, the other three summarised rights in place since 1225, and later enshrined in the Habeas Corpus Act 1679. They stipulated individuals could not be imprisoned without trial, deprived of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, whether by king or Privy Council, or detained until charged with a crime.

==Passage==
Despite being unanimously accepted by the Commons on 3 April, the Resolutions had no legal power and were rejected by Charles. He presented an alternative; a bill confirming &quot;Magna Carta&quot; and six other liberty-related statutes, on condition it contained &quot;no enlargement of former bills&quot;. The Commons refused, since Charles was only confirming established rights, which he had already shown willing to ignore, while it would still allow him to decide what was legal.

After conferring with his supporters, Charles announced Parliament would be prorogued on 13 May, but was now out-manoeuvred by his opponents. Since he refused a public bill, Coke suggested the Commons and Lords pass the resolutions as a Petition of Right, and then have it &quot;exemplified under the great seal&quot;. An established element of Parliamentary procedure, this had not been expressly prohibited by Charles, allowing them to evade his restrictions, but avoid direct opposition.

The Committee redrafted the content as a &#x27;Petition&#x27;, which was accepted by the Commons on 8 May, and presented the same day to the Lords by Coke, with a bill approving subsidies to encourage acceptance. After several days of debate, they approved it, but attempted to &quot;sweeten&quot; the wording; they then received a message from Charles, claiming he must retain the right to decide whether to detain someone.

Despite protestations on both sides, in an age when legal training was considered part of a gentleman&#x27;s education, significant elements within both Commons and Lords did not trust Charles to interpret the law. The Commons ignored both the request, and alterations proposed by the Lords to appease him; by now, there was a clear majority in both houses for the Petition as originally submitted. On 26 May, the Lords unanimously voted to join with the Commons on the Petition of Right, with the minor addition of an assurance of their loyalty, approved by the Commons on 27 May.

Charles now ordered John Finch, the Speaker of the Commons, to prevent &quot;insult&quot;, or criticism of any Minister of State. He specifically named Buckingham, and in response, John Selden moved the Commons demand his removal from office. Needing money for his war effort, Charles finally accepted the Petition, but first increased the level of mistrust on 2 June by trying to qualify it. Both houses now demanded &quot;a clear and satisfactory answer by His Majesty in full Parliament&quot;, and on 7 June, Charles capitulated.

==Provisions==

After setting out a list of individual grievances and statutes that had been broken, the Petition of Right declares that Englishmen have various &quot;rights and liberties&quot;, and provides that no person should be forced to provide a gift, loan or tax without an Act of Parliament, that no free individual should be imprisoned or detained unless a cause has been shown, and that soldiers or members of the Royal Navy should not be billeted in private houses without the free consent of the owner.

In relation to martial law, the Petition first repeated the due process chapter of &quot;Magna Carta&quot;, then demanded its repeal. This clause was directly addressed to the various commissions issued by Charles and his military commanders, restricting the use of martial law except in war or direct rebellion and prohibiting the formation of commissions. A state of war automatically activated martial law; as such, the only purpose for commissions, in their view, was to unjustly permit martial law in circumstances that did not require it.

==Aftermath==
Charles&#x27; acceptance was greeted with widespread public celebrations, including ringing of church bells and lighting of bonfires throughout the country. However, in August, Buckingham was assassinated by a disgruntled former soldier, while the surrender of La Rochelle in October effectively ended the war, and Charles&#x27; need for taxes. He dissolved Parliament in 1629, ushering in eleven years of Personal Rule, in which he attempted to regain all the ground lost.

For the rest of his reign, Charles used the same tactics; refusing to negotiate until forced, with concessions seen as temporary and reversed as soon as possible, by force if needed. Once Parliament adjourned, he resumed the policy of imposing unauthorised taxes, then prosecuting opponents using the non-jury Star Chamber. When Parliament and the normal courts quoted the Petition in support of objections to the tax, and the detention of Selden and John Eliot, Charles responded it was not a legal document.

Although confirmed as a legal statute in 1641 by the Long Parliament, debate over who was right continues; however, &quot;it seems impossible to establish conclusively which interpretation (is) correct&quot;. Regardless, the Petition has been described as &quot;one of England&#x27;s most famous constitutional documents&quot;, of equal standing to &quot;Magna Carta&quot; and the 1689 Bill of Rights. It remains in force in the United Kingdom, and much of the Commonwealth. It has been cited in support of the Third Amendment to the United States Constitution, and the Seventh. It is suggested elements appear in the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Amendment, primarily through the Massachusetts Body of Liberties.

<text>Eric Lynn Wright (September 7, 1964 – March 26, 1995), known professionally by the stage name Eazy-E, was an American rapper who propelled West Coast rap and gangsta rap by leading the group N.W.A and its label, Ruthless Records. He is often referred to as the &quot;Godfather of Gangsta Rap&quot;.

Born and raised in Compton, California, Wright had several legal troubles before founding Ruthless in 1987. After a short solo career with frequent collaboration with Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, they joined, forming N.W.A, later that year. N.W.A&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;, was released in 1989. Controversial upon release, it is now ranked among the greatest and most influential albums ever. The group released its second and final studio album, &quot;Niggaz4Life&quot;, in 1991, and soon after disbanded.

During N.W.A&#x27;s splintering, largely by disputes over money, Eazy-E became embroiled in bitter rivalries with Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, who had departed for solo careers in 1989 and 1991, respectively. Resuming his solo career Eazy-E released two EPs, yet he remained more significant behind the scenes, signing and nationally debuting the rap group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony from 1993 to 1994.

==Early life and Ruthless Records investment==
Eric Wright was born to Richard and Kathie Wright on September 7, 1964, in Compton, California, a Los Angeles suburb once noted for high crime rates and gang culture. His father was a postal worker and his mother was a grade-school administrator. Wright dropped out of high school in the tenth grade, but later received a general equivalency diploma (GED).

Wright supported himself mainly by selling drugs, and introduced his cousin to the illicit occupation. Wright&#x27;s music manager Jerry Heller recalls seeing Wright selling marijuana, but not cocaine. Heller would claim that Wright&#x27;s &quot;dope dealer&quot; label was part of his &quot;self-forged armor&quot;. Wright was also labeled as a &quot;thug&quot;. Heller explains: &quot;The hood where he grew up was a dangerous place. He was a small guy. &#x27;Thug&#x27; was a role that was widely understood on the street; it gave you a certain level of protection in the sense that people hesitated to fuck with you. Likewise, &#x27;dope dealer&#x27; was a role that accorded you certain privileges and respect.&quot;

In 1986, at age 22, Wright had allegedly earned as much as US$250,000 from dealing drugs. However, after his cousin was shot and killed, he decided that he could make a better living in the Los Angeles hip hop scene, which was growing rapidly in popularity. He started recording songs during the mid-1980s in his parents&#x27; garage, thus starting Ruthless Records.

The original idea for Ruthless Records came when Wright asked Heller to go into business with him. Wright suggested a half-ownership company, but it was later decided that Wright would get eighty percent of the company&#x27;s income and Heller would only get twenty percent. According to Heller, he told Wright, &quot;Every dollar comes into Ruthless, I take twenty cents. That&#x27;s industry standard for a manager of my caliber. I take twenty, you take eighty percent. I am responsible for my expenses and you&#x27;re responsible for yours. You own the company. I work for you.&quot; Along with Heller, Wright invested much of his money into Ruthless Records. Heller claims that he invested the first $250,000 and would eventually put up to $1,000,000 into the company.

==Musical career==
===N.W.A and &quot;Eazy-Duz-It&quot; (1986–1991)===
N.W.A&#x27;s (also named as &quot;the world&#x27;s most dangerous group&quot;) original lineup consisted of Arabian Prince, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, and Ice Cube. DJ Yella and MC Ren joined later. The compilation album &quot;N.W.A. and the Posse&quot; was released on November 6, 1987, and would go on to be certified Gold in the United States. The album featured material previously released as singles on the Macola Records label, which was responsible for distributing the releases by N.W.A and other artists like the Fila Fresh Crew, a West Coast rap group originally based in Dallas, Texas.

Eazy-E&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Eazy-Duz-It&quot;, was released in 1988, and featured twelve tracks. It was labeled as West Coast hip hop, gangsta rap and, later, as golden age hip hop. It has sold over 2.5 million copies in the United States and reached number forty-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album was produced by Dr. Dre and DJ Yella and largely written by MC Ren, Ice Cube, and The D.O.C. Both Glen Boyd from the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; and MTV&#x27;s Jon Wiederhorn claimed that &quot;Eazy-Duz-It&quot; &quot;paved the way&quot; for N.W.A&#x27;s most controversial debut album, &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;, which was released in January 1989. Wright&#x27;s only solo in the album was a remix of the song &quot;8 Ball&quot;, which originally appeared on &quot;N.W.A. and the Posse&quot;. &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; featured Wright&#x27;s writing and performing; he performed on seven songs and helped write four songs.

Ice Cube left N.W.A in 1989 because of internal disputes and the group continued as a four-piece ensemble. N.W.A released &quot;100 Miles and Runnin&#x27;&quot; in 1990 and &quot;Niggaz4Life&quot; in 1991. A diss war started between N.W.A and Ice Cube when &quot;100 Miles and Runnin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Real Niggaz&quot; were released. Ice Cube responded with &quot;No Vaseline&quot; on &quot;Death Certificate&quot;. Wright performed on seven of the eighteen songs on &quot;Niggaz4Life&quot;.

===End of N.W.A and feud with Dr. Dre (1991–1994)===
N.W.A began to split up after Jerry Heller became the band&#x27;s manager. Dr. Dre recalls, &quot;The split came when Jerry Heller got involved. He played the divide and conquer game. Instead of taking care of everybody, he picked one nigga to take care of and that was Eazy. And Eazy was like, &#x27;I&#x27;m taken care of, so fuck it&#x27;.&quot; Dr. Dre and The D.O.C. sent Suge Knight to look into Eazy-E&#x27;s financial situation as they began to grow suspicious of Eazy-E and Jerry Heller. Dr. Dre and The D.O.C. asked Eazy-E to release them from Ruthless, but Eazy-E refused. The impasse led to what reportedly transpired between Suge Knight and Eazy-E at the recording studio where &quot;Niggaz4life&quot; was recorded. After he refused to release Dr. Dre and The D.O.C., Suge Knight told Eazy-E that he had kidnapped Jerry Heller and was holding him prisoner in a van. This did not convince Eazy-E to release Dr. Dre and The D.O.C. from Ruthless, and Suge Knight threatened Eazy-E&#x27;s family: Suge Knight gave Eazy-E a piece of paper that contained Eazy&#x27;s mother&#x27;s address, telling him, &quot;I know where your mama stays.&quot; Eazy-E finally signed Dr. Dre and The D.O.C.&#x27;s releases, officially ending N.W.A.

The December 1992 EP &quot;5150: Home 4 tha Sick&quot; features a song written by Naughty by Nature. The track &quot;Merry Muthaphuckkin&#x27; Xmas&quot; features Menajahtwa, Buckwheat, and Atban Klann as guest vocalists, and &quot;Neighborhood Sniper&quot; features Kokane as a guest vocalist.

The feud with Dr. Dre continued after a track on Dre&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Chronic&quot;, &quot;Fuck wit Dre Day (And Everybody&#x27;s Celebratin&#x27;)&quot;, contained lyrics that insulted Eazy-E. Eazy responded with the October 1993 EP, &quot;It&#x27;s On (Dr. Dre) 187um Killa&quot;, featuring the tracks &quot;Real Muthaphuckkin G&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s On&quot;. The album, which was released on October 25, 1993, contains pictures of Dre wearing &quot;lacy outfits and makeup&quot; when he was a member of the Electro-hop World Class Wreckin&#x27; Cru. &quot;It&#x27;s On (Dr. Dre) 187um Killa&quot; features several guest vocalists, including Gangsta Dresta, B.G. Knocc Out. Kokane, Cold 187um, Rhythum D, and Dirty Red.

His final album, &quot;Str8 off tha Streetz of Muthaphukkin Compton,&quot; was released ten months after his death, on January 30, 1996. &quot;Str8 off tha Streetz of Muthaphukkin Compton&quot; featured several guest vocalists, including B.G. Knocc Out, Gangsta Dresta, Sylk-E. Fyne, Dirty Red, Menajahtwa, Roger Troutman, and ex-N.W.A members MC Ren and DJ Yella.

==Personal life and death==
Wright had a son, Eric Darnell Wright (known as Lil Eazy-E), in 1984. He also had a daughter named Erin, who changed her name to Ebie. In October 2016, Ebie launched a crowd-funding campaign to produce a film called &quot;Ruthless Scandal: No More Lies&quot; to investigate her father&#x27;s death. It ended unsuccessfully in December 2016.

In March 1991, Wright accepted an invitation to a lunch benefiting the Republican Senatorial Inner Circle, hosted by then-U.S. President George H. W. Bush. A spokesman for the rapper said that Wright supported Bush because of his performance in the Gulf War.

In 1993, Wright regularly attended court in the prosecution of the officers involved in the beating of Rodney King, often standing alongside Theodore J. Briseno, whom he had met through sharing the same lawyer. Wright said, &quot;The difference is that most people look at the video and say four white officers were responsible for the beating of this helpless, innocent black man. I say, &#x27;Wrong.&#x27; Three white officers were responsible for beating Rodney King. The other officer (Theodore J. Briseno) happens to be Mexican-American, and he tried to stop them.&quot; This caused controversy in the hip-hop community, with Willie D calling Wright a &quot;sellout&quot;.

Wright met Tomica Woods at a Los Angeles nightclub in 1991 and they married on March 14, 1995, twelve days before his death. They had a son named Dominick and a daughter named Daijah (born six months after Wright&#x27;s death). After Wright&#x27;s death, &quot;Ruthless&quot; was taken over by his wife. According to Jerry Heller, Wright had eleven children with eight women.

===Illness and death===

On February 24, 1995, Wright was admitted to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles with a violent cough. He was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. He announced his illness in a public statement on March 16. It is believed Wright contracted the infection from a sexual partner.
During the week of March 20, having already made amends with Ice Cube, he drafted a final message to his fans. On March 26, Eazy-E died from HIV/AIDS, one month after his diagnosis. He was 30 years old (most reports at the time said he was 31 due to the falsification of his date of birth by one year). He was buried on April 7, at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California. Over 3,000 people attended his funeral, including Jerry Heller and DJ Yella. He was buried in a gold casket, and was dressed in a flannel shirt, jeans, and his Compton hat.

==Musical influences and style==
Allmusic cites Eazy-E&#x27;s influences as Ice-T, Redd Foxx, King Tee, Bootsy Collins, Run–D.M.C., Richard Pryor, Egyptian Lover, Schoolly D, Too $hort, Prince, the Sugarhill Gang, and George Clinton. In the documentary &quot;The Life and Timez of Eric Wright&quot;, Eazy-E mentions collaborating with many of his influences.

When reviewing &quot;Eazy-Duz-It&quot;, Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic said, &quot;In terms of production, Dr. Dre and Yella meld together P-Funk, Def Jam-style hip-hop and the leftover electro sounds of mid-&#x27;80s Los Angeles, creating a dense, funky, and thoroughly unique style of their own.&quot; Birchmeier said that it sounded &quot;absolutely revolutionary in 1988&quot;.

==Legacy==

Eazy-E has been called the &quot;godfather of gangsta rap&quot;. MTV&#x27;s Reid Shaheem said that Eazy-E was a &quot;rap-pioneer&quot;, and he is sometimes cited by critics as a legend. Steve Huey of AllMusic said that he was &quot;one of the most controversial figures in gangsta rap&quot;. Since his 1995 death, many book and video biographies have been produced, including 2002&#x27;s &quot;The Day Eazy-E Died&quot; and &quot;Dead and Gone&quot;.

When Eazy-E was diagnosed with AIDS, many magazines like &quot;Jet&quot;, &quot;Vibe&quot;, &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;The Crisis&quot;, and &quot;Newsweek&quot; covered the story and released information on the topic. All of his studio albums and EPs charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and many of his singles—&quot;Eazy-Duz-It&quot;, &quot;We Want Eazy&quot;, &quot;Real Muthaphuckkin G&#x27;s&quot;, and &quot;Just tah Let U Know&quot;—also charted in the U.S.

He is one of many commemorated as part of the AIDS Quilt. 

Shortly after his death, in 1996, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, a group mentored by Eazy-E and signed to Ruthless Records, dedicated the single &quot;Tha Crossroads&quot; to his memory, which went on to reach #1 on the Billboard charts and earn the group a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group.

In 2012 an Eazy-E documentary was released by Ruthless Propaganda, called &quot;Ruthless Memories&quot;. The documentary featured interviews with Heller, MC Ren, and B.G. Knocc Out.

In the 2015 film &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;, Eazy-E is played by Jason Mitchell and the film is dedicated in his memory.

Eazy-E was portrayed by Omari Wallace in the 2016 film &quot;Surviving Compton: Dre, Suge &amp; Michel&#x27;le&quot;. The film portrays Eazy-E sympathetically as having been a friend to Michel&#x27;le, in one scene warning her to get out of the house because he fears that a drunken Dr. Dre is returning home to beat her.

In 2024, Eazy-E was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award posthumously as a member of N.W.A.

<text>Turkestan, also spelled Turkistan, is a historical region in Central Asia corresponding to the regions of Transoxiana and East Turkestan (Xinjiang). The region is located in the northwest of modern day China and to the northwest of its borders, and extends directly to the east of the Caspian Sea. Turkestan is primarily inhabited by Turkic peoples, as well as Russian and Tajik-Persian minorities. Turkestan is subdivided into Afghan Turkestan, Russian Turkestan, and East Turkistan (the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in China). 

Throughout history, the region has been exposed to the invasion of several different groups and kingdoms, including the Huns, the Imperial China, Arab Caliphate, the Hellenistic Macedonian Empire, the Achaemenid Empire, various Turkic forces and the Mongol Empire. The Qara Khitai also briefly controlled the majority of Turkestan&#x27;s land.

==Overview==
Known as Turan to the Persians, western Turkestan has also been known historically as Sogdia, &quot;Ma wara&#x27;u&#x27;n-nahr&quot; (by its Arab conquerors), and Transoxiana by western travelers. The latter two names refer to its position beyond the River Oxus when approached from the south, emphasizing Turkestan&#x27;s long-standing relationship with Iran, the Persian Empires, and the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates.

Oghuz Turks (also known as Turkmens), Kyrgyzs, Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Khazars, Uyghurs, and Hazaras are some of the Turkic inhabitants of the region who, as history progressed, have spread further into Eurasia forming such Turkic nations as Turkey, and subnational regions like Tatarstan in Russia and Crimea in Ukraine. Tajiks and Russians form sizable non-Turkic minorities.

It is subdivided into Afghan Turkestan and historical Russian Turkestan (the latter of which extended in the south to Persia, in the west to the Aral and Caspian Seas and in the northeast to Lake Balkhash and Lake Zaysan) in the west, and Chinese Turkestan or East Turkestan in the east.

==Etymology and terminology==
Of Persian origin (see -stan), the term &quot;Turkestan&quot; () had historically never referred to a single nation state. Persian geographers first used the word to describe the place where Turkic peoples lived. According to ethnographer Dávid Somfai Kara, prior to the Russian conquest, Turkestan historically referred only to the western portion of Central Asia:

On their way southward during the conquest of Central Asia in the 19th century, the Russians under took the city of Turkistan (in present-day Kazakhstan) in 1864. Mistaking its name for the entire region, they adopted the name of &quot;Turkestan&quot; () for their new territory.

In 1969, a Turfanian document from 639 CE was found in the Astana district of Turpan, which recorded Sogdian sale contract of a female slave from the period of the Gaochang kingdom under the rule of Qu clan and mentioned the Sogdian word &quot;twrkstn&quot;, which may have referred to the lands to the east and north of Syr Darya in the realm of the First Turkic Khaganate.

In 2024, Turkish Ministry of Education changed the term &#x27;Central Asia&#x27; () to &#x27;Turkestan&#x27; () in history textbooks.

==History==
The history of the Central Asian region that was later called Turkestan dates back to at least the third millennium BC. Many artifacts were produced in that period, with much trade being conducted. The region was a focal point for cultural diffusion, as the Silk Road traversed it.

Turkic sagas, such as the &quot;Ergenekon&quot; legend, and written sources, such as the Orkhon Inscriptions, in the 8th century AD, state that Turkic peoples originated in the nearby Altai Mountains, and, through nomadic settlement, started their long journey westwards. 
Much earlier than the Gokturks or their Orkhon Inscriptions, other groups such as the Huns conquered the area after they conquered Kashgaria in the early 2nd century BC. With the dissolution of the Huns&#x27; Empire, Chinese rulers took over Eastern Central Asia, which was centuries later also called Turkestan. Arab forces captured it in the 8th century. The Persian Samanid dynasty subsequently conquered it and the area experienced economic success. The entire territory was held at various times by Turkic forces, such as the Göktürks, until the conquest by Genghis Khan and the Mongols in 1220. Genghis Khan gave the territory to his son Chagatai and the area became the Chagatai Khanate. Timur took over the western portion of Turkestan in 1369, and the area became part of the Timurid Empire. The eastern portion of Turkestan was also called Moghulistan and continued to be ruled by descendants of Genghis Khan.

===Chinese influence===
In Chinese historiography, the Qara Khitai is most commonly called the &quot;Western Liao&quot; () and is considered to be a legitimate Chinese dynasty, as is the case for the Liao dynasty. The history of the Qara Khitai was included in the &quot;History of Liao&quot; (one of the &quot;Twenty-Four Histories&quot;), which was compiled officially during the Yuan dynasty by Toqto&#x27;a et al.

After the fall of the Tang dynasty, various dynasties of non-Han ethnic origins gained prestige by portraying themselves as the legitimate dynasty of China. Qara Khitai monarchs used the title of &quot;Chinese emperor&quot;, and were also called the &quot;Khan of Chīn&quot;. The Qara Khitai used the &quot;image of China&quot; to legitimize their rule to the Central Asians. The Chinese emperor, together with the rulers of the Turks, Arabs, India and the Byzantine Romans, were known to Islamic writers as the world&#x27;s &quot;five great kings&quot;. Qara Khitai kept the trappings of a Chinese state, such as Chinese coins, Chinese imperial titles, the Chinese writing system, tablets, seals, and used Chinese products like porcelain, mirrors, jade and other Chinese customs. The adherence to Liao Chinese traditions has been suggested as a reason why the Qara Khitai did not convert to Islam. Despite the Chinese trappings, there were comparatively few Han Chinese among the population of the Qara Khitai. These Han Chinese had lived in during the Liao dynasty, and in 1124 migrated with the Khitans under Yelü Dashi along with other people of Kedun, such as the Bohai, Jurchen, and Mongol tribes, as well as other Khitans in addition to the Xiao consort clan.

Qara Khitai&#x27;s rule over the Muslim-majority Central Asia has the effect of reinforcing the view among some Muslim writers that Central Asia was linked to China even though the Tang dynasty had lost control of the region a few hundred years ago. Marwazī wrote that Transoxiana was a former part of China, while Fakhr al-Dīn Mubārak Shāh defined China as part of &quot;Turkestan&quot;, and the cities of Balāsāghūn and Kashghar were considered part of China.

The association of Khitai with China meant that the most enduring trace of the Khitan&#x27;s power is names that are derived from it, such as Cathay, which is the medieval Latin appellation for China. Names derived from Khitai are still current in modern usage, such as the Russian, Bulgarian, Uzbek and Mongolian names for China. However, the use of the name Khitai to mean &quot;China&quot; or &quot;Chinese&quot; by Turkic speakers within China, such as the Uyghurs, is considered pejorative by the Chinese authorities, who tried to ban it.

<text>A randomized controlled trial (or randomized control trial; RCT) is a form of scientific experiment used to control factors not under direct experimental control. Examples of RCTs are clinical trials that compare the effects of drugs, surgical techniques, medical devices, diagnostic procedures, diets or other medical treatments.

Participants who enroll in RCTs differ from one another in known and unknown ways that can influence study outcomes, and yet cannot be directly controlled. By randomly allocating participants among compared treatments, an RCT enables &quot;statistical control&quot; over these influences. Provided it is designed well, conducted properly, and enrolls enough participants, an RCT may achieve sufficient control over these confounding factors to deliver a useful comparison of the treatments studied.
==Definition and examples==

An RCT in clinical research typically compares a proposed new treatment against an existing standard of care; these are then termed the &#x27;experimental&#x27; and &#x27;control&#x27; treatments, respectively. When no such generally accepted treatment is available, a placebo may be used in the control group so that participants are blinded, or not given information, about their treatment allocations. This blinding principle is ideally also extended as much as possible to other parties including researchers, technicians, data analysts, and evaluators. Effective blinding experimentally isolates the physiological effects of treatments from various psychological sources of bias.

The randomness in the assignment of participants to treatments reduces selection bias and allocation bias, balancing both known and unknown prognostic factors, in the assignment of treatments. Blinding reduces other forms of experimenter and subject biases.

A well-blinded RCT is considered the gold standard for clinical trials. Blinded RCTs are commonly used to test the efficacy of medical interventions and may additionally provide information about adverse effects, such as drug reactions. A randomized controlled trial can provide compelling evidence that the study treatment causes an effect on human health.

The terms &quot;RCT&quot; and &quot;randomized trial&quot; are sometimes used synonymously, but the latter term omits mention of controls and can therefore describe studies that compare multiple treatment groups with each other in the absence of a control group. Similarly, the initialism is sometimes expanded as &quot;randomized clinical trial&quot; or &quot;randomized comparative trial&quot;, leading to ambiguity in the scientific literature. Not all RCTs are randomized &quot;controlled&quot; trials (and some of them could never be, as in cases where controls would be impractical or unethical to use). The term randomized controlled clinical trial is an alternative term used in clinical research; however, RCTs are also employed in other research areas, including many of the social sciences.

== History ==
The first reported clinical trial was conducted by James Lind in 1747 to identify a treatment for scurvy. The first blind experiment was conducted by the French Royal Commission on Animal Magnetism in 1784 to investigate the claims of mesmerism. An early essay advocating the blinding of researchers came from Claude Bernard in the latter half of the 19th century. Bernard recommended that the observer of an experiment should not have knowledge of the hypothesis being tested. This suggestion contrasted starkly with the prevalent Enlightenment-era attitude that scientific observation can only be objectively valid when undertaken by a well-educated, informed scientist. The first study recorded to have a blinded researcher was published in 1907 by W. H. R. Rivers and H. N. Webber to investigate the effects of caffeine.

Randomized experiments first appeared in psychology, where they were introduced by Charles Sanders Peirce and Joseph Jastrow in the 1880s, and in education. The earliest experiments comparing treatment and control groups were published by Robert Woodworth and Edward Thorndike in 1901, and by John E. Coover and Frank Angell in 1907.

In the early 20th century, randomized experiments appeared in agriculture, due to Jerzy Neyman and Ronald A. Fisher. Fisher&#x27;s experimental research and his writings popularized randomized experiments.

The first published Randomized Controlled Trial in medicine appeared in the 1948 paper entitled &quot;Streptomycin treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis&quot;, which described a Medical Research Council investigation. One of the authors of that paper was Austin Bradford Hill, who is credited as having conceived the modern RCT.

Trial design was further influenced by the large-scale ISIS trials on heart attack treatments that were conducted in the 1980s.

By the late 20th century, RCTs were recognized as the standard method for &quot;rational therapeutics&quot; in medicine. As of 2004, more than 150,000 RCTs were in the Cochrane Library. To improve the reporting of RCTs in the medical literature, an international group of scientists and editors published Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statements in 1996, 2001 and 2010, and these have become widely accepted. Randomization is the process of assigning trial subjects to treatment or control groups using an element of chance to determine the assignments in order to reduce the bias.

== Ethics ==
Although the principle of clinical equipoise (&quot;genuine uncertainty within the expert medical community... about the preferred treatment&quot;) common to clinical trials has been applied to RCTs, the ethics of RCTs have special considerations. For one, it has been argued that equipoise itself is insufficient to justify RCTs. For another, &quot;collective equipoise&quot; can conflict with a lack of personal equipoise (e.g., a personal belief that an intervention is effective). Finally, Zelen&#x27;s design, which has been used for some RCTs, randomizes subjects &quot;before&quot; they provide informed consent, which may be ethical for RCTs of screening and selected therapies, but is likely unethical &quot;for most therapeutic trials.&quot;

Although subjects almost always provide informed consent for their participation in an RCT, studies since 1982 have documented that RCT subjects may believe that they are certain to receive treatment that is best for them personally; that is, they do not understand the difference between research and treatment. Further research is necessary to determine the prevalence of and ways to address this &quot;therapeutic misconception&quot;.

The RCT method variations may also create cultural effects that have not been well understood. For example, patients with terminal illness may join trials in the hope of being cured, even when treatments are unlikely to be successful.

=== Trial registration ===
In 2004, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) announced that all trials starting enrolment after July 1, 2005, must be registered prior to consideration for publication in one of the 12 member journals of the committee. However, trial registration may still occur late or not at all.
Medical journals have been slow in adapting policies requiring mandatory clinical trial registration as a prerequisite for publication.

== Classifications ==

=== By study design ===
One way to classify RCTs is by study design. From most to least common in the healthcare literature, the major categories of RCT study designs are:
* Parallel-group – each participant is randomly assigned to a group, and all the participants in the group receive (or do not receive) an intervention.
* Crossover – over time, each participant receives (or does not receive) an intervention in a random sequence.
* Cluster – pre-existing groups of participants (e.g., villages, schools) are randomly selected to receive (or not receive) an intervention.
* Factorial – each participant is randomly assigned to a group that receives a particular combination of interventions or non-interventions (e.g., group 1 receives vitamin X and vitamin Y, group 2 receives vitamin X and placebo Y, group 3 receives placebo X and vitamin Y, and group 4 receives placebo X and placebo Y).
An analysis of the 616 RCTs indexed in PubMed during December 2006 found that 78% were parallel-group trials, 16% were crossover, 2% were split-body, 2% were cluster, and 2% were factorial.

=== By outcome of interest (efficacy vs. effectiveness) ===

RCTs can be classified as &quot;explanatory&quot; or &quot;pragmatic.&quot; Explanatory RCTs test efficacy in a research setting with highly selected participants and under highly controlled conditions. In contrast, pragmatic RCTs (pRCTs) test effectiveness in everyday practice with relatively unselected participants and under flexible conditions; in this way, pragmatic RCTs can &quot;inform decisions about practice.&quot;

=== By hypothesis (superiority vs. noninferiority vs. equivalence) ===
Another classification of RCTs categorizes them as &quot;superiority trials&quot;, &quot;noninferiority trials&quot;, and &quot;equivalence trials&quot;, which differ in methodology and reporting. Most RCTs are superiority trials, in which one intervention is hypothesized to be superior to another in a statistically significant way. Some RCTs are noninferiority trials &quot;to determine whether a new treatment is no worse than a reference treatment.&quot; Other RCTs are equivalence trials in which the hypothesis is that two interventions are indistinguishable from each other.

== Randomization ==
The advantages of proper randomization in RCTs include:
* &quot;It eliminates bias in treatment assignment,&quot; specifically selection bias and confounding.
* &quot;It facilitates blinding (masking) of the identity of treatments from investigators, participants, and assessors.&quot;
* &quot;It permits the use of probability theory to express the likelihood that any difference in outcome between treatment groups merely indicates chance.&quot;

There are two processes involved in randomizing patients to different interventions. First is choosing a &quot;randomization procedure&quot; to generate an unpredictable sequence of allocations; this may be a simple random assignment of patients to any of the groups at equal probabilities, may be &quot;restricted&quot;, or may be &quot;adaptive.&quot; A second and more practical issue is &quot;allocation concealment&quot;, which refers to the stringent precautions taken to ensure that the group assignment of patients are not revealed prior to definitively allocating them to their respective groups. Non-random &quot;systematic&quot; methods of group assignment, such as alternating subjects between one group and the other, can cause &quot;limitless contamination possibilities&quot; and can cause a breach of allocation concealment.

However empirical evidence that adequate randomization changes outcomes relative to inadequate randomization has been difficult to detect.

=== Procedures ===
The treatment allocation is the desired proportion of patients in each treatment arm.

An ideal randomization procedure would achieve the following goals:
* Maximize statistical power, especially in subgroup analyses. Generally, equal group sizes maximize statistical power, however, unequal groups sizes may be more powerful for some analyses (e.g., multiple comparisons of placebo versus several doses using Dunnett&#x27;s procedure ), and are sometimes desired for non-analytic reasons (e.g., patients may be more motivated to enroll if there is a higher chance of getting the test treatment, or regulatory agencies may require a minimum number of patients exposed to treatment).
* Minimize selection bias. This may occur if investigators can consciously or unconsciously preferentially enroll patients between treatment arms. A good randomization procedure will be unpredictable so that investigators cannot guess the next subject&#x27;s group assignment based on prior treatment assignments. The risk of selection bias is highest when previous treatment assignments are known (as in unblinded studies) or can be guessed (perhaps if a drug has distinctive side effects).
* Minimize allocation bias (or confounding). This may occur when covariates that affect the outcome are not equally distributed between treatment groups, and the treatment effect is confounded with the effect of the covariates (i.e., an &quot;accidental bias&quot;). If the randomization procedure causes an imbalance in covariates related to the outcome across groups, estimates of effect may be biased if not adjusted for the covariates (which may be unmeasured and therefore impossible to adjust for).

However, no single randomization procedure meets those goals in every circumstance, so researchers must select a procedure for a given study based on its advantages and disadvantages.

==== Simple ====
This is a commonly used and intuitive procedure, similar to &quot;repeated fair coin-tossing.&quot; Also known as &quot;complete&quot; or &quot;unrestricted&quot; randomization, it is robust against both selection and accidental biases. However, its main drawback is the possibility of imbalanced group sizes in small RCTs. It is therefore recommended only for RCTs with over 200 subjects.

==== Restricted ====
To balance group sizes in smaller RCTs, some form of &quot;restricted&quot; randomization is recommended. The major types of restricted randomization used in RCTs are:
* Permuted-block randomization or blocked randomization: a &quot;block size&quot; and &quot;allocation ratio&quot; (number of subjects in one group versus the other group) are specified, and subjects are allocated randomly within each block. For example, a block size of 6 and an allocation ratio of 2:1 would lead to random assignment of 4 subjects to one group and 2 to the other. This type of randomization can be combined with &quot;stratified randomization&quot;, for example by center in a multicenter trial, to &quot;ensure good balance of participant characteristics in each group.&quot; A special case of permuted-block randomization is &quot;random allocation&quot;, in which the entire sample is treated as one block. The major disadvantage of permuted-block randomization is that even if the block sizes are large and randomly varied, the procedure can lead to selection bias. Another disadvantage is that &quot;proper&quot; analysis of data from permuted-block-randomized RCTs requires stratification by blocks.
* Adaptive biased-coin randomization methods (of which urn randomization is the most widely known type): In these relatively uncommon methods, the probability of being assigned to a group decreases if the group is overrepresented and increases if the group is underrepresented. The methods are thought to be less affected by selection bias than permuted-block randomization.

==== Adaptive ====
At least two types of &quot;adaptive&quot; randomization procedures have been used in RCTs, but much less frequently than simple or restricted randomization:
* Covariate-adaptive randomization, of which one type is minimization: The probability of being assigned to a group varies in order to minimize &quot;covariate imbalance.&quot; Minimization is reported to have &quot;supporters and detractors&quot; because only the first subject&#x27;s group assignment is truly chosen at random, the method does not necessarily eliminate bias on unknown factors.
* Response-adaptive randomization, also known as outcome-adaptive randomization: The probability of being assigned to a group increases if the responses of the prior patients in the group were favorable. Although arguments have been made that this approach is more ethical than other types of randomization when the probability that a treatment is effective or ineffective increases during the course of an RCT, ethicists have not yet studied the approach in detail.

=== Allocation concealment ===

&quot;Allocation concealment&quot; (defined as &quot;the procedure for protecting the randomization process so that the treatment to be allocated is not known before the patient is entered into the study&quot;) is important in RCTs. In practice, clinical investigators in RCTs often find it difficult to maintain impartiality. Stories abound of investigators holding up sealed envelopes to lights or ransacking offices to determine group assignments in order to dictate the assignment of their next patient. Such practices introduce selection bias and confounders (both of which should be minimized by randomization), possibly distorting the results of the study. Adequate allocation concealment should defeat patients and investigators from discovering treatment allocation once a study is underway and after the study has concluded. Treatment related side-effects or adverse events may be specific enough to reveal allocation to investigators or patients thereby introducing bias or influencing any subjective parameters collected by investigators or requested from subjects.

Some standard methods of ensuring allocation concealment include sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes (SNOSE); sequentially numbered containers; pharmacy controlled randomization; and central randomization. It is recommended that allocation concealment methods be included in an RCT&#x27;s protocol, and that the allocation concealment methods should be reported in detail in a publication of an RCT&#x27;s results; however, a 2005 study determined that most RCTs have unclear allocation concealment in their protocols, in their publications, or both. On the other hand, a 2008 study of 146 meta-analyses concluded that the results of RCTs with inadequate or unclear allocation concealment tended to be biased toward beneficial effects only if the RCTs&#x27; outcomes were subjective as opposed to objective.

=== Sample size ===
The number of treatment units (subjects or groups of subjects) assigned to control and treatment groups, affects an RCT&#x27;s reliability. If the effect of the treatment is small, the number of treatment units in either group may be insufficient for rejecting the null hypothesis in the respective statistical test. The failure to reject the null hypothesis would imply that the treatment shows no statistically significant effect on the treated in a given test. But as the sample size increases, the same RCT may be able to demonstrate a significant effect of the treatment, even if this effect is small.

== Blinding ==
An RCT may be blinded, (also called &quot;masked&quot;) by &quot;procedures that prevent study participants, caregivers, or outcome assessors from knowing which intervention was received.&quot; Unlike allocation concealment, blinding is sometimes inappropriate or impossible to perform in an RCT; for example, if an RCT involves a treatment in which active participation of the patient is necessary (e.g., physical therapy), participants cannot be blinded to the intervention.

Traditionally, blinded RCTs have been classified as &quot;single-blind&quot;, &quot;double-blind&quot;, or &quot;triple-blind&quot;; however, in 2001 and 2006 two studies showed that these terms have different meanings for different people. The 2010 CONSORT Statement specifies that authors and editors should not use the terms &quot;single-blind&quot;, &quot;double-blind&quot;, and &quot;triple-blind&quot;; instead, reports of blinded RCT should discuss &quot;If done, who was blinded after assignment to interventions (for example, participants, care providers, those assessing outcomes) and how.&quot;

RCTs without blinding are referred to as &quot;unblinded&quot;, &quot;open&quot;, or (if the intervention is a medication) &quot;open-label&quot;. In 2008 a study concluded that the results of unblinded RCTs tended to be biased toward beneficial effects only if the RCTs&#x27; outcomes were subjective as opposed to objective; for example, in an RCT of treatments for multiple sclerosis, unblinded neurologists (but not the blinded neurologists) felt that the treatments were beneficial. In pragmatic RCTs, although the participants and providers are often unblinded, it is &quot;still desirable and often possible to blind the assessor or obtain an objective source of data for evaluation of outcomes.&quot;

== Analysis of data ==
The types of statistical methods used in RCTs depend on the characteristics of the data and include:
* For dichotomous (binary) outcome data, logistic regression (e.g., to predict sustained virological response after receipt of peginterferon alfa-2a for hepatitis C) and other methods can be used.
* For continuous outcome data, analysis of covariance (e.g., for changes in blood lipid levels after receipt of atorvastatin after acute coronary syndrome) tests the effects of predictor variables.
* For time-to-event outcome data that may be censored, survival analysis (e.g., Kaplan–Meier estimators and Cox proportional hazards models for time to coronary heart disease after receipt of hormone replacement therapy in menopause) is appropriate.

Regardless of the statistical methods used, important considerations in the analysis of RCT data include:
* Whether an RCT should be stopped early due to interim results. For example, RCTs may be stopped early if an intervention produces &quot;larger than expected benefit or harm&quot;, or if &quot;investigators find evidence of no important difference between experimental and control interventions.&quot;
* The extent to which the groups can be analyzed exactly as they existed upon randomization (i.e., whether a so-called &quot;intention-to-treat analysis&quot; is used). A &quot;pure&quot; intention-to-treat analysis is &quot;possible only when complete outcome data are available&quot; for all randomized subjects; when some outcome data are missing, options include analyzing only cases with known outcomes and using imputed data. Nevertheless, the more that analyses can include all participants in the groups to which they were randomized, the less bias that an RCT will be subject to.
* Whether subgroup analysis should be performed. These are &quot;often discouraged&quot; because multiple comparisons may produce false positive findings that cannot be confirmed by other studies.

== Reporting of results ==
The &quot;CONSORT 2010 Statement&quot; is &quot;an evidence-based, minimum set of recommendations for reporting RCTs.&quot; The CONSORT 2010 checklist contains 25 items (many with sub-items) focusing on &quot;individually randomised, two group, parallel trials&quot; which are the most common type of RCT.

For other RCT study designs, &quot;CONSORT extensions&quot; have been published, some examples are:
* Consort 2010 Statement: Extension to Cluster Randomised Trials
* Consort 2010 Statement: Non-Pharmacologic Treatment Interventions
* &quot;Reporting of surrogate endpoints in randomised controlled trial reports (CONSORT-Surrogate): extension checklist with explanation and elaboration&quot;

=== Relative importance and observational studies ===
Two studies published in &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; in 2000 found that observational studies and RCTs overall produced similar results. The authors of the 2000 findings questioned the belief that &quot;observational studies should not be used for defining evidence-based medical care&quot; and that RCTs&#x27; results are &quot;evidence of the highest grade.&quot; However, a 2001 study published in &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; concluded that &quot;discrepancies beyond chance do occur and differences in estimated magnitude of treatment effect are very common&quot; between observational studies and RCTs. According to a 2014 (updated in 2024) Cochrane review, there is little evidence for significant effect differences between observational studies and randomized controlled trials. To evaluate differences it is necessary to consider things other than design, such as heterogeneity, population, intervention or comparator.

Two other lines of reasoning question RCTs&#x27; contribution to scientific knowledge beyond other types of studies:
* If study designs are ranked by their potential for new discoveries, then anecdotal evidence would be at the top of the list, followed by observational studies, followed by RCTs.
* RCTs may be unnecessary for treatments that have dramatic and rapid effects relative to the expected stable or progressively worse natural course of the condition treated. One example is combination chemotherapy including cisplatin for metastatic testicular cancer, which increased the cure rate from 5% to 60% in a 1977 non-randomized study.

=== Interpretation of statistical results ===
Like all statistical methods, RCTs are subject to both type I (&quot;false positive&quot;) and type II (&quot;false negative&quot;) statistical errors. Regarding Type I errors, a typical RCT will use 0.05 (i.e., 1 in 20) as the probability that the RCT will falsely find two equally effective treatments significantly different. Regarding Type II errors, despite the publication of a 1978 paper noting that the sample sizes of many &quot;negative&quot; RCTs were too small to make definitive conclusions about the negative results, by 2005-2006 a sizeable proportion of RCTs still had inaccurate or incompletely reported sample size calculations.

=== Peer review ===

Peer review of results is an important part of the scientific method. Reviewers examine the study results for potential problems with design that could lead to unreliable results (for example by creating a systematic bias), evaluate the study in the context of related studies and other evidence, and evaluate whether the study can be reasonably considered to have proven its conclusions. To underscore the need for peer review and the danger of overgeneralizing conclusions, two Boston-area medical researchers performed a randomized controlled trial in which they randomly assigned either a parachute or an empty backpack to 23 volunteers who jumped from either a biplane or a helicopter. The study was able to accurately report that parachutes fail to reduce injury compared to empty backpacks. The key context that limited the general applicability of this conclusion was that the aircraft were parked on the ground, and participants had only jumped about two feet.

== Advantages ==
RCTs are considered to be the most reliable form of scientific evidence in the hierarchy of evidence that influences healthcare policy and practice because RCTs reduce spurious causality and bias. Results of RCTs may be combined in systematic reviews which are increasingly being used in the conduct of evidence-based practice. Some examples of scientific organizations&#x27; considering RCTs or systematic reviews of RCTs to be the highest-quality evidence available are:
* As of 1998, the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia designated &quot;Level I&quot; evidence as that &quot;obtained from a systematic review of all relevant randomised controlled trials&quot; and &quot;Level II&quot; evidence as that &quot;obtained from at least one properly designed randomised controlled trial.&quot;
* Since at least 2001, in making clinical practice guideline recommendations the United States Preventive Services Task Force has considered both a study&#x27;s design and its internal validity as indicators of its quality. It has recognized &quot;evidence obtained from at least one properly randomized controlled trial&quot; with good internal validity (i.e., a rating of &quot;I-good&quot;) as the highest quality evidence available to it.
* The GRADE Working Group concluded in 2008 that &quot;randomised trials without important limitations constitute high quality evidence.&quot;
* For issues involving &quot;Therapy/Prevention, Aetiology/Harm&quot;, the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine as of 2011 defined &quot;Level 1a&quot; evidence as a systematic review of RCTs that are consistent with each other, and &quot;Level 1b&quot; evidence as an &quot;individual RCT (with narrow Confidence Interval).&quot;

Notable RCTs with unexpected results that contributed to changes in clinical practice include:
* After Food and Drug Administration approval, the antiarrhythmic agents flecainide and encainide came to market in 1986 and 1987 respectively. The non-randomized studies concerning the drugs were characterized as &quot;glowing&quot;, and their sales increased to a combined total of approximately 165,000 prescriptions per month in early 1989. In that year, however, a preliminary report of an RCT concluded that the two drugs increased mortality. Sales of the drugs then decreased.
* Prior to 2002, based on observational studies, it was routine for physicians to prescribe hormone replacement therapy for post-menopausal women to prevent myocardial infarction. In 2002 and 2004, however, published RCTs from the Women&#x27;s Health Initiative claimed that women taking hormone replacement therapy with estrogen plus progestin had a higher rate of myocardial infarctions than women on a placebo, and that estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy caused no reduction in the incidence of coronary heart disease. Possible explanations for the discrepancy between the observational studies and the RCTs involved differences in methodology, in the hormone regimens used, and in the populations studied. The use of hormone replacement therapy decreased after publication of the RCTs.

== Disadvantages ==
Many papers discuss the disadvantages of RCTs. Among the most frequently cited drawbacks are:

=== Time and costs ===
RCTs can be expensive; one study found 28 Phase III RCTs funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke prior to 2000 with a total cost of US$335 million, for a mean cost of US$12 million per RCT. Nevertheless, the return on investment of RCTs may be high, in that the same study projected that the 28 RCTs produced a &quot;net benefit to society at 10-years&quot; of 46 times the cost of the trials program, based on evaluating a quality-adjusted life year as equal to the prevailing mean per capita gross domestic product.

The conduct of an RCT takes several years until being published; thus, data is restricted from the medical community for long years and may be of less relevance at time of publication.

It is costly to maintain RCTs for the years or decades that would be ideal for evaluating some interventions.

Interventions to prevent events that occur only infrequently (e.g., sudden infant death syndrome) and uncommon adverse outcomes (e.g., a rare side effect of a drug) would require RCTs with extremely large sample sizes and may, therefore, best be assessed by observational studies.

Due to the costs of running RCTs, these usually only inspect one variable or very few variables, rarely reflecting the full picture of a complicated medical situation; whereas the case report, for example, can detail many aspects of the patient&#x27;s medical situation (e.g. patient history, physical examination, diagnosis, psychosocial aspects, follow up).

=== Conflict of interest dangers ===

A 2011 study done to disclose possible conflicts of interests in underlying research studies used for medical meta-analyses reviewed 29 meta-analyses and found that conflicts of interests in the studies underlying the meta-analyses were rarely disclosed. The 29 meta-analyses included 11 from general medicine journals; 15 from specialty medicine journals, and 3 from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The 29 meta-analyses reviewed an aggregate of 509 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Of these, 318 RCTs reported funding sources with 219 (69%) industry funded. 132 of the 509 RCTs reported author conflict of interest disclosures, with 91 studies (69%) disclosing industry financial ties with one or more authors. The information was, however, seldom reflected in the meta-analyses. Only two (7%) reported RCT funding sources and none reported RCT author-industry ties. The authors concluded &quot;without acknowledgment of COI due to industry funding or author industry financial ties from RCTs included in meta-analyses, readers&#x27; understanding and appraisal of the evidence from the meta-analysis may be compromised.&quot;

Some RCTs are fully or partly funded by the health care industry (e.g., the pharmaceutical industry) as opposed to government, nonprofit, or other sources. A systematic review published in 2003 found four 1986–2002 articles comparing industry-sponsored and nonindustry-sponsored RCTs, and in all the articles there was a correlation of industry sponsorship and positive study outcome. A 2004 study of 1999–2001 RCTs published in leading medical and surgical journals determined that industry-funded RCTs &quot;are more likely to be associated with statistically significant pro-industry findings.&quot; These results have been mirrored in trials in surgery, where although industry funding did not affect the rate of trial discontinuation it was however associated with a lower odds of publication for completed trials. One possible reason for the pro-industry results in industry-funded published RCTs is publication bias. Other authors have cited the differing goals of academic and industry sponsored research as contributing to the difference. Commercial sponsors may be more focused on performing trials of drugs that have already shown promise in early stage trials, and on replicating previous positive results to fulfill regulatory requirements for drug approval.

=== Ethics ===
If a disruptive innovation in medical technology is developed, it may be difficult to test this ethically in an RCT if it becomes &quot;obvious&quot; that the control subjects have poorer outcomes—either due to other foregoing testing, or within the initial phase of the RCT itself. Ethically it may be necessary to abort the RCT prematurely, and getting ethics approval (and patient agreement) to withhold the innovation from the control group in future RCTs may not be feasible.

Historical control trials (HCT) exploit the data of previous RCTs to reduce the sample size; however, these approaches are controversial in the scientific community and must be handled with care.

== In social science ==

Due to the recent emergence of RCTs in social science, the use of RCTs in social sciences is a contested issue. Some writers from a medical or health background have argued that existing research in a range of social science disciplines lacks rigour, and should be improved by greater use of randomized control trials.

=== Transport science ===

Researchers in transport science argue that public spending on programmes such as school travel plans could not be justified unless their efficacy is demonstrated by randomized controlled trials. Graham-Rowe and colleagues reviewed 77 evaluations of transport interventions found in the literature, categorising them into 5 &quot;quality levels&quot;. They concluded that most of the studies were of low quality and advocated the use of randomized controlled trials wherever possible in future transport research.

Dr. Steve Melia took issue with these conclusions, arguing that claims about the advantages of RCTs, in establishing causality and avoiding bias, have been exaggerated. He proposed the following eight criteria for the use of RCTs in contexts where interventions must change human behaviour to be effective:

The intervention:

# Has not been applied to all members of a unique group of people (e.g. the population of a whole country, all employees of a unique organisation etc.)
# Is applied in a context or setting similar to that which applies to the control group
# Can be isolated from other activities—and the purpose of the study is to assess this isolated effect
# Has a short timescale between its implementation and maturity of its effects

And the causal mechanisms:

# &lt;li value=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Are either known to the researchers, or else all possible alternatives can be tested
# Do not involve significant feedback mechanisms between the intervention group and external environments
# Have a stable and predictable relationship to exogenous factors
# Would act in the same way if the control group and intervention group were reversed

=== Criminology ===
A 2005 review found 83 randomized experiments in criminology published in 1982–2004, compared with only 35 published in 1957–1981. The authors classified the studies they found into five categories: &quot;policing&quot;, &quot;prevention&quot;, &quot;corrections&quot;, &quot;court&quot;, and &quot;community&quot;. Focusing only on offending behavior programs, Hollin (2008) argued that RCTs may be difficult to implement (e.g., if an RCT required &quot;passing sentences that would randomly assign offenders to programmes&quot;) and therefore that experiments with quasi-experimental design are still necessary.

=== Education ===
RCTs have been used in evaluating a number of educational interventions. Between 1980 and 2016, over 1,000 reports of RCTs have been published. For example, a 2009 study randomized 260 elementary school teachers&#x27; classrooms to receive or not receive a program of behavioral screening, classroom intervention, and parent training, and then measured the behavioral and academic performance of their students. Another 2009 study randomized classrooms for 678 first-grade children to receive a classroom-centered intervention, a parent-centered intervention, or no intervention, and then followed their academic outcomes through age 19.

== Criticism ==
A 2018 review of the 10 most cited randomised controlled trials noted poor distribution of background traits, difficulties with blinding, and discussed other assumptions and biases inherent in randomised controlled trials. These include the &quot;unique time period assessment bias&quot;, the &quot;background traits remain constant assumption&quot;, the &quot;average treatment effects limitation&quot;, the &quot;simple treatment at the individual level limitation&quot;, the &quot;all preconditions are fully met assumption&quot;, the &quot;quantitative variable limitation&quot; and the &quot;placebo only or conventional treatment only limitation&quot;.

<doc id="163194" wikidata="Q2317008" url="?curid=163194" title="Culture of Mexico">
<text>Mexico&#x27;s culture emerged from the culture of the Spanish Empire, the preexisting indigenous cultures of Mexico, and alongside with African influences. Mexican culture is described as the &#x27;child&#x27; of both western and native American civilizations. Other minor influences include those from other regions of Europe, Middle East &amp; Asia.

First inhabited more than 10,000 years ago, the cultures that developed in Mexico became one of the cradles of civilization. During the 300-year rule by the Spanish, Mexico was a crossroads for the people and cultures of Europe and America, with minor influence from Asia. Starting in the late 19th century, the government of independent Mexico has actively promoted cultural fusion (&quot;mestizaje&quot;) and shared cultural traits in order to create a national identity. Despite this base layer of shared Mexican identity and wider Latin American culture, the big and varied geography of Mexico and the many different indigenous cultures create more of a cultural mosaic, comparable to the heterogeneity of countries like India or China.

Icons of Mexican culture range from the pyramids of Teotihuacan to the intricate murals of Diego Rivera and the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe. Mexican cuisine uses indigenous ingredients like maize and chili peppers in beloved dishes such as tacos and mole. Festivals like Dia de los Muertos celebrate indigenous traditions alongside Catholic rituals, while music genres like mariachi, popular music and regional dances like ballet folklórico express cultural diversity and pride. Mexican luminaries like Octavio Paz and Carlos Fuentes contribute to a global literary canon. Sports, particularly soccer, unify the nation in fervent support, alongside the enduring influence of telenovelas and iconic figures like Thalía and a deep-rooted sense of community and family.

The culture of an individual Mexican is influenced by familial ties, gender, religion, location, and social class, among other factors. Contemporary life in the cities of Mexico has become similar to that in the neighboring United States and in Europe, with provincial people conserving traditions more than city dwellers.

==Mexico Regional variations==
Mexico is a country with notable regional variations influenced by geography, culture, and history. Northern Mexico is characterized by arid landscapes and beef-based cuisine, with dishes like carne asada and asado, and is known for Norteño music. Central Mexico, home to Mexico City, features rich culinary traditions like mole and tacos al pastor, and is the birthplace of Mariachi music. Southern Mexico, including states like Oaxaca and Chiapas, has a strong indigenous influence, with tropical cuisine featuring cochinita pibil and mole de olla, and lush landscapes. The Yucatán Peninsula is known for seafood dishes, achiote-based cuisine, and Mayan heritage, with a tropical climate and distinct music. The Pacific Coast offers seafood, tropical flavors, and popular beach destinations, while the Gulf Coast is famous for its seafood and Son Huasteco music. The Bajío region is an agricultural hub with temperate climates, known for hearty dishes like carnitas.

==Religion==

The Spanish arrival and colonization brought Roman Catholicism to the country, which became the main religion of Mexico. Mexico is a secular state, and the Constitution of 1917 and anti-clerical law imposed limitations on the church and sometimes codified state intrusion into church matters. The government does not provide any financial contributions to the church, and the church does not participate in public education.

In 2010, 95.6% of the population were Christian. Roman Catholics are 89% of the total, 47% percent of whom attend church services weekly. In absolute terms, Mexico has the world&#x27;s second largest number of Catholics after Brazil. According to the Government&#x27;s 2000 census, approximately 87 percent of respondents identified themselves as at least nominally Roman Catholic. Christmas is a national holiday and every year during Easter and Christmas all schools in Mexico, public and private, send their students on vacation.

Other religious groups for which the 2000 census provided estimates included evangelicals, with 1.71 percent of the population; other Protestant evangelical groups, 2.79 percent; members of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, 1.25 percent; &quot;Historical&quot; Protestants, 0.71 percent; Seventh-day Adventists, 0.58 percent; The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 0.25 percent; Jews, 0.05 percent; and other religions, 0.31 percent. Approximately 3.52 percent of respondents indicated no religion, and 0.86 percent did not specify a religion.

==Arts==

Mexico is known for its folk art traditions, mostly derived from the indigenous and Spanish crafts. Pre-Columbian art thrived over a wide timescale, from 1800 BC to AD 1500. Certain artistic characteristics were repeated throughout the region, namely a preference for angular, linear patterns, and three-dimensional ceramics.

Notable handicrafts include clay pottery from the valley of Oaxaca and the village of Tonala. Colorfully embroidered cotton garments, cotton or wool shawls and outer garments, and colorful baskets and rugs are seen everywhere. Mexico is also known for its pre-Columbian architecture, especially for public, ceremonial and urban monumental buildings and structures.

Following the conquest, the first artistic efforts were directed at evangelization and the related task of building churches. The Spanish initially co-opted many indigenous stonemasons and sculptors to build churches, monuments and other religious art, such as altars. The prevailing style during this era was Baroque. In the period from independence to the early 20th century, Mexican fine arts continued to be largely influenced by European traditions.

After the Mexican Revolution, a new generation of Mexican artists led a vibrant national movement that incorporated political, historic and folk themes in their work. The painters Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and David Siqueiros were the main propagators of Mexican muralism. Their grand murals often displayed on public buildings, promoted social ideals. Rufino Tamayo and Frida Kahlo produced more personal works with abstract elements. Mexican art photography was largely fostered by the work of Manuel Álvarez Bravo.

==Literature==
Mexican literature has its antecedents in the literature of the indigenous settlements of Mesoamerica and European literature. The most well known pre-Hispanic poet is Netzahualcoyotl. Modern Mexican literature is influenced by the concepts of the Spanish colonialization of Mesoamerica. Outstanding colonial writers and poets include Juan Ruiz de Alarcón and Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz.

Other notable writers include Alfonso Reyes, José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi, Ignacio Manuel Altamirano, Maruxa Vilalta, Carlos Fuentes, Octavio Paz (Nobel Laureate), Renato Leduc, Mariano Azuela (&quot;Los de abajo&quot;), Juan Rulfo (&quot;Pedro Páramo&quot;), Juan José Arreola, and Bruno Traven.

Contemporary Mexican literature not only captures the essence of Mexican culture but also resonates with universal themes, making it a significant contribution to world literature. Authors like Elena Poniatowska, Juan Villoro, Valeria Luiselli, Yuri Herrera, and Fernanda Melchor delve into themes such as migration, inequality, historical memory, and the complexities of Mexican society.

==Mexican philosophy==
In the 17th century, Sor Juana Inez de la Cruz emerged as one of Mexico&#x27;s most prominent early philosophers. A nun, poet, and scholar, Sor Juana critiqued the societal and religious constraints of her time, advocating for women’s education and intellectual freedom. Her works on feminism, reason, and knowledge had a lasting impact on Mexican intellectual history, making her an influential figure in both the Mexican and global philosophical traditions. The 19th century saw a blend of European philosophy with local thought, particularly as Mexico navigated its struggle for independence and the establishment of the Mexican Republic. José Vasconcelos, a key philosopher of this era, promoted ideas about Mexican identity, education, and the integration of indigenous cultures into modern Mexican society, advocating for cultural unity and intellectual renewal.

In the 20th century, Mexican philosophy continued to evolve through figures such as Octavio Paz, whose work focused on the relationship between Mexican culture and the broader world. Paz explored themes of identity, language, and history, making significant contributions to existential thought and cultural philosophy. Meanwhile, philosophers like Carlos Pereyra and Luis Villoro engaged with existentialism, epistemology, and the philosophy of culture, addressing both global trends and issues specific to Mexico.

Mexican philosophy also grappled with social and political issues. Samuel Ramos reflected on the psychological and cultural effects of colonialism, exploring how colonial history shaped Mexican identity. David Huerta, on the other hand, contributed to existential and literary philosophy, analyzing human existence and freedom within the context of Mexican society. Today, Mexican philosophers continue to explore a variety of topics, including ethics, identity, and the intersection of philosophy with indigenous thought. Their contributions play a significant role in global philosophical debates, particularly in the realms of postcolonial theory and cultural identity.

===Language===


Mexico is the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world. Although the overwhelming majority of Mexicans today speak Spanish, there is no &quot;de jure&quot; official language at the federal level. The government recognizes 62 indigenous Amerindian languages as national languages.

Some Spanish vocabulary in Mexico has roots in the country&#x27;s indigenous languages, which are spoken by approximately 6% of the population. Some indigenous Mexican words have become common in other languages, such as the English language. For instance, the words tomato, chocolate, coyote, and avocado are Nahuatl in origin.

==Architecture==


With thirty-four sites, Mexico has more sites on the UNESCO World Heritage list than any other country in the Americas; most of the sites pertain to Mexico&#x27;s architectural history. Mesoamerican architecture in Mexico is best known for its public, ceremonial, and urban monumental buildings and structures, several of which are the largest monuments in the world. Mesoamerican architecture is divided into three eras, Pre-Classic, Classic, and Post-Classic. Architect Frank Lloyd Wright is reputed to have declared the Puuc-style architecture of the Maya as the best in the Western Hemisphere.

The New Spanish Baroque dominated in early colonial Mexico. During the late 17th century to 1750, one of Mexico&#x27;s most popular architectural styles was Mexican Churrigueresque, which combined Amerindian and Moorish decorative influences.

The Academy of San Carlos, founded in 1788, was the first major art academy in the Americas. The academy promoted Neoclassicism, focusing on Greek and Roman art and architecture. Notable Neoclassical works include the Hospicio Cabañas, a world heritage site, and the Palacio de Minería, both by Spanish Mexican architect Manuel Tolsá.

From 1864 to 1867, during the Second Mexican Empire, Maximilian I was installed as emperor of Mexico. His architectural legacy lies in the redesigning of the Castillo de Chapultepec and creating the Paseo de la Reforma. This intervention, financed largely by France, was brief, but it began a period of French influence in architecture and culture. The style was emphasized during the presidency of Porfirio Diaz, who was a pronounced francophile. Notable works from the Porfiriato include the Palacio de Correos and a large network of railways.

After the Mexican Revolution in 1917, idealization of the indigenous and the traditional symbolized attempts to reach into the past and retrieve what had been lost in the race toward modernization.

Functionalism, expressionism, and other schools left their imprint on a large number of works in which Mexican stylistic elements have been combined with European and American techniques, most notably the work of Pritzker Prize winner Luis Barragán. His personal home, the Luis Barragán House and Studio, is a World Heritage Site.

Enrique Norten, the founder of TEN Arquitectos, has been awarded several honors for his work in modern architecture. His work expresses a modernity that reinforces the government&#x27;s desire to present a new image of Mexico as an industrialized country with a global presence.

Other notable and emerging contemporary architects include Mario Schjetnan, Michel Rojkind, Isaac Broid Zajman, Bernardo Gómez-Pimienta, and Alberto Kalach.

==Cinema==

The history of Mexican cinema dates to the beginning of the 20th century when several enthusiasts of the new medium documented historical events – most particularly the Mexican Revolution. Mexican cinema began in the late 19th century with the introduction of film technology. The first Mexican film is considered to be &quot;Don Juan Tenorio&quot; (1898) by Salvador Toscano Barragán. The Golden Age of Mexican cinema is the name given to the period between 1935 and 1959, where the quality and economic success of the cinema of Mexico reached its peak. Directors like Emilio Fernández (&quot;Maria Candelaria&quot;), Fernando de Fuentes (&quot;Vámonos con Pancho Villa&quot;), and Julio Bracho (&quot;Distinto Amanecer&quot;) were prominent figures. An era when renowned actors such as Cantinflas and Pedro Infante appeared on the silver screen. Actresses such as Dolores del Río and María Félix became icons of Mexican cinema during this era.

The emergence of the &quot;Nuevo Cine Mexicano&quot; in the late 20th century introduced new talents like Arturo Ripstein (&quot;El Castillo de la Pureza&quot;) and Felipe Cazals (&quot;&quot;). In the renaissance and New Wave of the 1960s-1970s. Present-day film makers from 1980s-Present, include directors like Alfonso Cuarón (&quot;Y Tu Mamá También&quot;), Guillermo del Toro (&quot;Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot;), and Alejandro González Iñárritu (&quot;Amores Perros) gained international acclaim, contributing to a resurgence in Mexican cinema&#x27;s global influence. Other influential individuals include Carlos Reygadas (&quot;Stellet Licht&quot;), screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga and directors of photography such as Guillermo Navarro and Emmanuel Lubezki. Mexican cinema today spans various genres, including comedy (e.g., films by Eugenio Derbez), horror (e.g., &quot;Tigers Are Not Afraid&quot; by Issa López), and drama.

==Theater==

During the colonial era, Spanish plays and religious dramas were introduced, shaping the foundation of Mexican theater. By the 20th century, Mexico developed distinct theatrical forms, including the &quot;teatro de revistas&quot; (musical revues) and &quot;teatro de carpa&quot; (tent theater), which often featured comedy, music, and political satire. Mexico City serves as the hub of the country’s theater scene, with the historic Teatro de los Insurgentes and Teatro Cervantes being among the most iconic venues. The city&#x27;s Centro Histórico also hosts a variety of theaters showcasing both contemporary and classical works. Additionally, regional theaters across the country produce local plays and foster the development of new talent.

The Premios Ariel recognize excellence in film, but there are also several awards dedicated to live theater. The Premios de la Crítica Teatral (Theater Criticism Awards) and Premios Metropolitano de Teatro celebrate outstanding theatrical performances in Mexico. Mexican theater has also been shaped by a strong community theater culture, with local companies producing both avant-garde and traditional works, often tackling social and political issues.

Notable actors like Ignacio López Tarso, Julieta Egurrola, and Diana Bracho have made significant contributions to both stage and film, earning recognition for their powerful performances. Iconic plays such as &quot;La Casa de Bernarda Alba&quot; by Federico García Lorca and &quot;El gesticulador&quot; by Rodolfo Usigli are staples of Mexican theater, exploring themes of identity, politics, and social issues. Additionally, &quot;Les Misérables&quot; has been adapted into a popular Mexican version, while works like &quot;Un Hombre de No Importancia&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot; also reflect the diversity and cultural richness of the country’s theatrical landscape.

==National holidays==


Mexicans celebrate their Independence from Spain on September 16, and other holidays are celebrated with festivals known as &quot;Fiestas&quot;. Many Mexican cities, towns, and villages hold a yearly festival to commemorate their local patron saints. During these festivities, the people pray and burn candles to honor their saints in churches decorated with flowers and colorful utensils. They also hold large parades, fireworks, dance competitions, and beauty pageant contests, all the while partying and buying refreshments in the marketplaces and public squares. In the smaller towns and villages, soccer, and boxing are also celebrated during the festivities.

Other festivities include Día de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe (&quot;Our Lady of Guadalupe Day&quot;), Las Posadas (&quot;The Shelters&quot;, celebrated on December 16 to December 24), Noche Buena (&quot;Holy Night&quot;, celebrated on December 24), Navidad (&quot;Christmas&quot;, celebrated on December 25) and Año Nuevo (&quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot;, celebrated on December 31 to January 1).

&quot;Guadalupe Day&quot; is regarded by many Mexicans as the most important religious holiday of their country. It honors the Virgin of Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico, and it is celebrated on December 12. In the last decade, all the celebrations happening from mid-December to the beginning of January have been linked together in what has been called the Guadalupe-Reyes Marathon.

Epiphany on the evening of January 5 marks the Twelfth Night of Christmas and is when the figurines of the three wise men are added to the nativity scene. Traditionally in Mexico, as with many other Latin American countries, Santa Claus does not hold the significance that he does in the United States. Rather, it is the three wise men who are the bearers of gifts, who leave presents in or near the shoes of small children. Mexican families also commemorate the date by eating &quot;Rosca de reyes&quot;.

The Day of the Dead incorporates pre-Columbian beliefs with Christian elements. The holiday focuses on gatherings of family and friends to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died. An idea behind this day suggests the living must attend to the dead so that the dead will protect the living. The celebration occurs on November 2 in connection with the Catholic holidays of All Saints&#x27; Day (November 1) and All Souls&#x27; Day (November 2). Traditions connected with the holiday include building private altars honoring the deceased, using sugar skulls, marigolds, and the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these as gifts. The gifts presented turn the graveyard from a dull and sorrowful place to an intimate and hospitable environment to celebrate the dead.

In modern Mexico, particularly in the larger cities and in the North, local traditions are now being observed and intertwined with the greater North American Santa Claus tradition, as well as with other holidays such as Halloween, due to Americanization via film and television, creating an economy of gifting tradition that spans from Christmas Day until January 6.

A piñata is made from papier-mache. It is created to look like popular people, animals, or fictional characters. Once made it is painted with bright colors and filled with candy or small toys. It is then hung from the ceiling. The children are blindfolded and take turns hitting the piñata until it breaks open and the candy and small toys fall out. The children then gather the candy and small toys.

==Cuisine==


Mexican cuisine is known for its blending of Indigenous and European cultures. The cuisine was inscribed in 2010 on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. Traditionally, the main Mexican ingredients consisted of maize, beans, both red and white meats, potatoes, tomatoes, seafood, chili peppers, squash, nuts, avocados and various herbs native to Mexico.

Popular dishes include tacos, enchiladas, mole sauce, atole, tamales, and pozole. Popular beverages include water flavored with a variety of fruit juices, and cinnamon-flavored hot chocolate prepared with milk or water and blended until it becomes frothed using a traditional wooden tool called a &quot;molinillo&quot;. Alcoholic beverages native to Mexico include mescal, pulque, and tequila. Mexican beer is also popular in Mexico and are exported. There are international award-winning Mexican wineries that produce and export wine.

The most important and frequently used spices in Mexican cuisine are chili powder, cumin, oregano, cilantro, epazote, cinnamon, and cocoa. Chipotle, a smoked-dried jalapeño pepper, is also common in Mexican cuisine. Many Mexican dishes also contain onions and garlic, which are also some of Mexico&#x27;s staple foods.

Next to corn, rice is the most common grain in Mexican cuisine. According to food writer Karen Hursh Graber, the initial introduction of rice to Spain from North Africa in the 14th century led to the Spanish introduction of rice to Mexico at the port of Veracruz in the 1520s. This, Graber says, created one of the earliest instances of the world&#x27;s greatest Fusion cuisines.

In southeastern Mexico, especially in the Yucatán Peninsula, spicy vegetable and meat dishes are common. The cuisine of Southeastern Mexico has quite a bit of Caribbean influence, given its geographical location. Seafood is commonly prepared in the states that border the Pacific Ocean or the Gulf of Mexico, the latter having a famous reputation for its fish dishes, &quot;à la veracruzana&quot;.

Chocolate originated in Mexico and was prized by the Aztecs. It remains an important ingredient in Mexican cookery.

Vanilla originated in Mexico. It was first cultivated by the Totonacs of Mexico&#x27;s east coast. Vanilla is used in Mexico to flavor horchata and Mexican desserts such as churros.

Mexican tea culture is known for its traditional herbal teas such as chamomile, linden, orange blossom, spearmint and lemongrass.

==Music and dance==

Mexican music is deeply rooted in its indigenous heritage, reflecting the rich cultural history of the region. The original inhabitants of Mexico used a variety of traditional instruments, including drums like the teponaztli, flutes, rattles, conches as trumpets, and their voices to create music and accompany dances. These sounds were integral to ceremonial events such as Netotiliztli. Although ancient music persists in certain areas, much of contemporary Mexican music emerged during and after the Spanish colonial period. This era saw the incorporation of European instruments into Mexican music, with some traditional instruments like the Mexican vihuela, used in Mariachi ensembles, evolving from their Old World counterparts into distinctly Mexican forms.

Manuel M. Ponce, renowned for his composition &quot;Estrellita,&quot; and Silvestre Revueltas, known for works such as &quot;Sensemayá,&quot; are prominent figures in Mexican classical music. Other notable composers include Luis G. Jordá &quot;Elodia,&quot; Ricardo Castro, Juventino Rosas, celebrated for &quot;Sobre las olas,&quot; Mario Carrillo with his &quot;Sonido 13,&quot; Julio Salazar, Pablo Moncayo, famous for &quot;Huapango,&quot; and Carlos Chávez, a key figure in modern Mexican symphonic music.

The diversity of Mexican music genres highlights the complexity of Mexican culture. Traditional forms include Mariachi, Banda, Norteño (North style, redoba and accordion), Ranchera, Cumbia originating from Colombia but embraced in Mexico, and Corridos. These genres have gained international recognition, with notable popularity in countries such as Chile. Iconic songs such as &quot;Cielito Lindo,&quot; &quot;La Adelita,&quot; &quot;El Rey,&quot; &quot;Jarabe Tapatío&quot; (the Mexican Hat Dance), &quot;La Llorona,&quot; &quot;La Bamba,&quot; and &quot;Las Mañanitas&quot; are celebrated examples of traditional Mexican music. Other styles of traditional regional music in México: Huapango or Son Huasteco (Huasteca, northeastern regions, violin and two guitars known as quinta huapanguera and jarana), Tambora (Sinaloa, mainly brass instruments) Duranguense, Jarana (most of the Yucatán peninsula).

Folk songs known as corridos have been a significant element of Mexican music since the early 20th century, narrating stories related to the Mexican Revolution, romance, political themes, and other aspects of Mexican life. Additionally, Son Jarocho and the marimba contribute richly to the country&#x27;s musical landscape, each representing distinct regional traditions and styles. Also in the early 20th century, Mariachi and Ranchera began to gain prominence, evolving through the contributions of artists such as Pedro Infante and Vicente Fernández.

Mariachi bands, characterized by their ensemble of singers, violins, guitarrón, guitarra de golpe, vihuela, guitars, and trumpets, perform at diverse venues such as streets, festivals, and restaurants. The most renowned Mariachi group is Vargas de Tecalitlán, which was established in 1897 and has significantly influenced the genre. Folk dances are an integral part of Mexican culture, with the &quot;Jarabe Tapatío,&quot; commonly known as the &quot;Mexican hat dance,&quot; being particularly significant in dance tradition. This traditional dance features a sequence of hopping steps and heel and toe-tapping movements performed by dancers dressed in vibrant regional costumes.

Popular Mexican song composers include Agustín Lara, known for his romantic boleros; Consuelo Velázquez, celebrated for the iconic song &quot;Bésame Mucho&quot;; and José Alfredo Jiménez, recognized for his influential rancheras. Other notable composers are Armando Manzanero, famous for his boleros; Álvaro Carrillo, known for his poignant ballads; Joaquín Pardavé, who contributed to Mexican music and cinema; and Alfonso Ortiz Tirado, esteemed for his classical and operatic works. Juan Gabriel&#x27;s songwriting was characterized by his deeply personal and emotive lyrics, blending traditional Mexican music with contemporary styles to create memorable and heartfelt songs.

In the latter half of the 20th century, Mexican rock and pop music began to emerge. Bands like Caifanes and artists such as Luis Miguel became iconic figures in the Latin American music scene. The 1980s and 1990s saw the rise of new wave and rock en español, with influential groups lik Molotov and Maná leading the charge. Mexico boasts the largest media industry in Latin America, producing influential artists who achieve prominence across the Americas and Europe.

Traditional Mexican music has influenced the evolution of the pop and Mexican rock genre. Some well-known Mexican pop singers are Thalía, Paulina Rubio, Jose Jose and Gloria Trevi. Mexican rock musicians such as Zoé, Café Tacvba, Las Ultrasonicas and Panteón Rococó have incorporated Mexican folk tunes into their music. Mexican contemporary musicians include Natalia Lafourcade, Julieta Venegas, Leonel García, and Carlos Rivera. Traditional Mexican music is still alive in the voices of artists such as Lila Downs, Aida Cuevas, Alejandro Fernández, Pepe Aguilar, Lupita Infante, and Lorenzo Negrete.

The annual Vive Latino festival in Mexico City is one of the largest and most influential music festivals in Latin America, drawing global attention and showcasing a diverse range of musical genres.

==Sport==

The traditional national sport of Mexico is Charreria, which consists of a series of equestrian events. The national horse of Mexico, used in Charreria, is the Azteca. Bullfighting, a tradition brought from Spain, is also popular. Mexico has the largest venue for bullfighting in the world - the Plaza México in Mexico City which seats 48,000 people. The country hosted the Summer Olympic Games in 1968 and the FIFA World Cup in 1970, 1986, and the upcoming 2026 and will be first country to host the FIFA World Cup three times.

Football, as the most popular team sport in Mexico, is deeply ingrained in the nation&#x27;s culture and identity. Each Mexican state typically supports its own local teams, fostering regional rivalries and a passionate fan base. The country&#x27;s top clubs—Chivas de Guadalajara, Club América, Cruz Azul, and Pumas de la UNAM—are not only successful in domestic competitions but also have significant followings due to their storied histories and contributions to Mexican football. The sport has produced a number of internationally renowned players who have excelled both in domestic leagues and on the global stage. Hugo Sánchez is celebrated for his prolific scoring in La Liga, while Guillermo Ochoa is known for his impressive performances in European leagues and World Cups. Rafael Márquez, a versatile defender, has had a distinguished career in both European and Mexican football. In addition to club football, the Mexican national team, known as &quot;El Tri&quot;, has a storied history in international competitions, including multiple appearances in the FIFA World Cup and successful campaigns in regional tournaments such as the CONCACAF Gold Cup.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Mexican colleges began integrating physical education into their curricula, initially focusing on individual sports such as track and field. Over time, especially from the mid-20th century onward, American football gained popularity among college students, reflecting the growing influence of American sports culture. Soccer remains the most popular college sport in Mexico, with competitive programs at universities such as the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) and the Universidad de Guadalajara (UDG). Basketball also has a significant presence, with strong teams from institutions like the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM) and the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León (UANL). Although American football is less prevalent, it is expanding, particularly within organizations like ONEFA, involving universities like UNAM&#x27;s Pumas CU and the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education (Monterrey ITESM) Borregos Salvajes Monterrey. Volleyball, track and field, swimming, and tennis are also prominent, with universities such as the Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juárez (UACJ) and the Universidad de Guadalajara (UDG) maintaining competitive programs.

Mexico has a long tradition in combat sports. Boxing is the most popular and successful, which has turned the country into a world power with more than 110 world champions in various weight categories. In taekwondo, the second most practiced sport at the national level, it is one of the top exponents with 7 Olympic medals (two gold, two silver and three bronze). In mixed martial arts (MMA) there are also world champions of Mexican origin, being the only Hispanic American country to achieve this. Finally, sports such as judo and karate have also had talented representatives of Mexican origin, although to a lesser extent.

==Automobile Dominance and Infrastructure==

In Mexico, personal transportation is predominantly centered around automobiles, with the country&#x27;s infrastructure and car culture reflecting its unique economic, social, and geographical context. Mexico features an extensive road network of approximately 250,000 kilometers (155,000 miles), connecting major urban centers and supporting both trade and personal travel, though rural areas often face less-developed infrastructure. Car ownership has been rising, particularly in urban areas, with about 200 vehicles per 1,000 people, making cars a key mode of commuting for many Mexicans. Mexico&#x27;s automotive sector is robust, housing major international manufacturers like General Motors, Volkswagen, and Nissan, and emerging interest in electric and hybrid vehicles is supported by government incentives. Car culture in Mexico often emphasizes practicality and affordability, with car shows and enthusiast clubs reflecting a growing passion for vehicles, especially among younger generations. However, traffic congestion in cities like Mexico City poses significant challenges, leading to ongoing efforts to improve public transportation and road conditions. Economic factors, including vehicle affordability and fuel costs, influence car ownership, while environmental concerns drive regulations and initiatives for cleaner technologies. The Mexican government continues to invest in infrastructure development and technological advancements, aiming to enhance connectivity, reduce congestion, and promote sustainable practices in personal transportation.

==Fashion in Mexico==

The history of fashion in Mexico is deeply influenced by its indigenous cultures, which have long traditions of weaving and embroidery, with garments such as the huipil, rebozo, and serape being central to their attire. During the colonial period, European styles and materials, including silk and lace, merged with indigenous textiles and techniques, creating a distinct blend of cultural aesthetics. In contemporary times, Mexican fashion continues to evolve, incorporating traditional craftsmanship with modern trends, through the work of designers like Carla Fernández and Pineda Covalin who emphasize sustainability, cultural heritage, and innovation.

Mexico City, along with Guadalajara and Monterrey, is a central hub for the nation&#x27;s fashion scene. Recognized as the heart of Mexico&#x27;s fashion industry, the city hosts major events like Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Mexico. Its fashion is an eclectic mix of high fashion, streetwear, and artisanal craftsmanship, contributing to the global view of Mexican style. 

Clothing choices in Mexico vary based on region, climate, and occasion. In urban areas, casual attire such as jeans, t-shirts, and dresses are common, though formal dress remains the norm for events like weddings and religious ceremonies. Men often wear suits, while women don elegant dresses, sometimes incorporating traditional Mexican elements like embroidery.

Mexico&#x27;s fashion is also shaped by climate. In coastal and tropical regions, lighter fabrics prevail, while colder northern areas favor heavier clothing. Rural regions retain traditional attire like embroidered blouses and ponchos, often worn during festivals. Urban centers adopt a more cosmopolitan style, influenced by global trends. Regional identity plays a significant role in Mexican fashion. The northern states feature cowboy-inspired clothing and in the Midwest Charro Suits, while coastal areas embrace resort wear (Guayabera). In southern regions like Oaxaca and Chiapas, indigenous textiles and handcrafted garments highlight Mexico&#x27;s rich cultural heritage.

<text>A secret identity is a person&#x27;s cryptonym, incognito, cover and/or alter ego which is not known to the general populace, most often used in fiction. Brought into popular culture by the Scarlet Pimpernel in 1903, the concept was widespread in pulp heroes and is particularly prevalent in the American comic book genre, and is a trope of the masquerade.

In American comic books, a character typically has dual identities, one overt and one covert. The false or &quot;public identity&quot; being known to the general public as the &quot;superhero persona&quot; and the other being the secret identity. The private or secret identity is typically the superhero&#x27;s legal name, true identity, and/or &quot;civilian persona&quot; when they are not actively assuming the superhero persona. It is kept hidden from their enemies and the general public to protect themselves from legal ramifications, pressure, or public scrutiny, as well as to protect their friends and loved ones from harm secondary to their actions as superheroes.

==Example==

*Bruce Wayne&#x27;s &quot;playboy billionaire&quot; is portrayed in all media as his &quot;mask&quot;, or false identity, while his Batman persona is his &quot;face&quot;, or true identify. 
*Clark maintains three separate identities: the reporter Clark Kent and the superhero Superman identities each allows different means of helping people. These identities are kept separate from his Smallville farmer identity, in order to protect his family&#x27;s privacy.
*Diana Prince, a diplomat, is the civilian identity of Wonder Woman, to blend in the society outside her homeland.
*Danny Fenton maintains two separate identities: the teenage boy Danny Fenton and the superhero Danny Phantom identities allows different means of fighting crime and helping people; these identities are similar to Spider-Man. 
*Kit Taylor maintains his human identity and the superhero Kamen Rider: Dragon Knight identities each allows different means of helping people. These identities are kept separate in Kamen Rider: Dragon Knight. 

Occasionally, this trope is inverted. Examples of this are:
*Marvel Cinematic Universe films &quot;Iron Man&quot; (2008), where the film ends with the lead character declaring to the world “I am Iron Man”
*&quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021), where it ends with Peter Parker&#x27;s civilian persona being permanently erased from the memory of the entire world, as a result of a spell by Doctor Strange.

<doc id="163205" wikidata="Q4808602" url="?curid=163205" title="Assault weapon">
<text>In the United States, assault weapon is a controversial term applied to different kinds of firearms. There is no clear, consistent definition. It can include semi-automatic firearms with a detachable magazine, a pistol grip, and sometimes other features, such as a vertical forward grip, flash suppressor, or barrel shroud. Certain firearms are specified by name in some laws that restrict assault weapons. When the now-defunct Federal Assault Weapons Ban was passed in 1994, the U.S. Department of Justice said, &quot;In general, assault weapons are semiautomatic firearms with a large magazine of ammunition that were designed and configured for rapid fire and combat use.&quot; The commonly used definitions of assault weapons are under frequent debate, and have changed over time.

The origin of the term has been attributed to legislators, the firearms industry, gun control groups, and the media. It is sometimes used interchangeably with the term assault rifle, which refers to selective fire rifles that use intermediate cartridges. This use has been described as incorrect and a misapplication of the term. After the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, many news organizations ran stories about assault weapons, explaining their varying definitions and presenting varying opinions about whether they should be banned again at the federal level.

==Definitions and usage==
Drawing from federal and state law definitions, the term assault weapon refers primarily to semi-automatic rifles, pistols, and shotguns that are able to accept detachable magazines and possess one or more other features. Some jurisdictions define revolving-cylinder shotguns as assault weapons. Legislative definitions do not include fully automatic weapons, which are regulated separately as Title II weapons under federal law. A key defining law was the now-defunct Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994. At that time, the United States Department of Justice said, &quot;In general, assault weapons are semiautomatic firearms with a large magazine of ammunition that were designed and configured for rapid fire and combat use.&quot;

Common attributes used in legislative definitions of assault weapons include:
* Semi-automatic firearm capable of accepting a detachable magazine;
* Folding or telescoping (collapsible) stock, which reduces the overall length of the firearm;
* A pistol grip that protrudes beneath the action of the weapon;
* Bayonet lug, which allows the mounting of a bayonet;
* Threaded barrel, which can accept muzzle devices such as a flash hider, suppressor, compensator or muzzle brake;
* Grenade launcher;
* Barrel shroud.

Dictionary definitions vary from legal definitions. Dictionary.com defines &quot;assault weapon&quot; as &quot;any of various automatic and semiautomatic military firearms utilizing an intermediate-power cartridge, designed for individual use&quot;. The &quot;Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&quot;″s definition is &quot;any of various automatic or semiautomatic firearms; especially: assault rifle&quot;.

===History of terminology===
The origin of the term is not clearly known and is the subject of much debate. In the past, the names of certain military weapons used the phrase, such as the Rifleman&#x27;s Assault Weapon, a grenade launcher developed in 1977 for use with the M16 assault rifle, or the Shoulder-launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon, a rocket launcher introduced in 1984.

One of the earliest uses of the term, or a similar term, in its current meaning was as part of an advertisement in &quot;The Hutchinson News&quot; (Kansas) in 1978 for the Valmets-7.62×39, the Colt AR-15, and the Wilkinson Terry carbine. Another was in a bill introduced by Art Agnos in the California State Assembly in April 1985 to ban semi-automatic &quot;assault firearms&quot; capable of using detachable magazines of 20 rounds or more. Speaking to the Assembly Public Safety Committee, Agnos said, &quot;The only use for assault weapons is to shoot people.&quot; The measure did not pass when it came up for a vote.

In 2013, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, looking into the history of the term, wrote of the term: &quot;Many attribute its popularization to a 1988 paper written by gun-control activist and Violence Policy Center founder Josh Sugarmann and the later reaction to the Cleveland School massacre in Stockton, California, in January 1989.&quot; Sugarmann had written:

Other researchers have found evidence to suggest that the firearms industry itself may have introduced the term &quot;assault weapon&quot; to build interest in new product lines. Phillip Peterson, the author of &quot;Gun Digest Buyer&#x27;s Guide to Assault Weapons&quot; (2008) wrote:

Meanwhile, many gun rights activists have put forward that the term was popularized by the media or gun control activists. Conservative writer Rich Lowry said that assault weapon is a &quot;manufactured term&quot;. Joseph P. Tartaro of the Second Amendment Foundation (SAF) wrote in 1994: &quot;One of the key elements of the anti-gun strategy to gull the public into supporting bans on the so-called &#x27;assault weapons&#x27; is to foster confusion. As stated previously, the public does not know the difference between a full automatic and a semi-automatic firearm.&quot; Robert Crook, executive director of the Coalition of Connecticut Sportsmen, said &quot;the term &#x27;assault weapon,&#x27; as used by the media, is a media invention.&quot; Gun control supporters use the term while gun rights supporters generally do not use the term.

===Differing state law definitions===
Seven states have assault weapon bans with different definitions and characteristics.
* California defines assault weapons by name, by &quot;series&quot; (AK-47 or AR-15), and by characteristic. A shotgun with a revolving cylinder is also defined as an assault weapon.
* Connecticut defines assault weapons as selective-fire firearms (including assault rifles capable of fully automatic or burst fire); semi-automatic firearms specified by name; and semi-automatic firearms with specific characteristics.
* Hawaii defines and bans assault &quot;pistols&quot;.
* Maryland defines and bans assault &quot;pistols&quot;. It regulates 45 other assault weapons listed by make or model including copies, regardless of manufacturer.
* Massachusetts defines assault weapons as semi-automatic firearms with the same definition provisions from the expired federal ban of 1994.
* New York had an assault weapons ban prior to 2013, but on January 16 of that year it passed the SAFE Act, which created a stricter definition of assault weapons and banned them immediately. The NY SAFE Act defines assault weapons as semi-automatic pistols and rifles with detachable magazines and one military-style feature, and semi-automatic shotguns with one military-style feature.

In Illinois, proposed legislation in 2013 would have defined the term &quot;semi-automatic assault weapon&quot; as any semi-automatic firearm able to accept a detachable magazine, but it was never brought to a vote. The Illinois State Rifle Association said most of the state&#x27;s firearms owners owned one or more guns that would have been banned under the proposal. The NRA said the proposal would have restricted about 75 percent of handguns and 50 percent of long guns in circulation. As municipalities, Chicago and Cook County bans certain firearms defined as assault weapons and have no provision for legal possession of firearms owned before their laws were passed. Minnesota also defines certain firearms as assault weapons and regulates their sales. The State of Washington defines any semi-automatic rifle (except antiques), regardless of features, caliber, or magazine type, as a &quot;semiautomatic assault rifle&quot;.

===Distinction from assault rifles===
The term &quot;assault rifle&quot; is frequently used interchangeably with the term &quot;assault weapon&quot; but this use has been described as incorrect and a misapplication of the term. The AP Stylebook suggests that newsrooms avoid the terms &quot;assault weapon&quot; and &quot;assault rifle&quot; instead using the term &quot;semi-automatic rifle&quot;. Part of the definition of &quot;assault rifle&quot;, according to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica,&quot; is that it is selective-fire, which means that it is capable of both semiautomatic and fully automatic fire. Civilian ownership of machine guns, including selective-fire rifles, has been tightly regulated since 1934 under the National Firearms Act and since 1986 under the Firearm Owners Protection Act.

===Cosmetic features===
Gun control advocates and gun rights advocates have referred to at least some of the features outlined in assault weapons bans as &quot;cosmetic&quot;. The NRA Institute for Legislative Action and the Violence Policy Center both used the term in 2004 when the federal ban expired. In May 2012, the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence said, &quot;the inclusion in the list of features that were purely cosmetic in nature created a loophole that allowed manufacturers to successfully circumvent the law by making minor modifications to the weapons they already produced.&quot; Some reporters used the term in stories after the 2012 shootings in Aurora, Colorado, and Newtown, Connecticut.

Assault weapons, also sometimes called &quot;black guns&quot; or &quot;black rifles&quot;, are no more powerful than many other semi-automatic rifles legally used for hunting throughout the United States; they do not shoot faster or have greater range.

Two scholars have written: &quot;One problem inherent in the study of [assault weapons (AW)] is that the classifications of AW are based on cosmetic features of firearms... For instance, the Colt AR-15 series of semi-automatic rifles—the civilian version of the fully automatic M-16 rifle issued to U.S. soldiers—was subject to the 1994 AW restrictions, but the Ruger Mini-14 rifle was not banned. Yet, the Mini-14 is the same caliber, has a similar barrel length, the same semi-automatic action, and can use magazines that hold 30 rounds of ammunition. The only real meaningful difference between the two firearms is cosmetic: The AR-15 rifle looks more dangerous.&quot;

The National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms industry trade group, states that the term &quot;assault weapon&quot; has been misapplied to many semi-automatic firearms because of their appearance and not their use in crime.

==Political and legislative issues==

As of 2021, there are an estimated 16–44 million rifles from just the AR-15 family of rifles in civilian use in the United States.

===Defunct U.S. Federal Assault Weapons Ban===

The Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act of 1994, more commonly known as the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, expired in 2004. It banned the manufacture or importation of certain semi-automatic firearms that it defined as &quot;semiautomatic assault weapons&quot;, commonly known as assault weapons. Any firearms so defined that were already possessed at the time the law took effect were grandfathered in, and could be legally owned or transferred. Another aspect of the law banned the manufacture or importation of magazines that could hold more than ten rounds of ammunition, with existing magazines grandfathered in as legal.

The Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 defined certain firearms as assault weapons based on the features they possessed. This included semi-automatic rifles with a detachable magazine and at least two of these features: a pistol grip, a folding or telescoping stock, a flash suppressor or threaded barrel, a bayonet mount, or a muzzle-mounted grenade launcher. It included semi-automatic pistols with a detachable magazine and at least two of these features: a magazine that attaches outside the pistol grip, a threaded barrel, a barrel shroud, or an unloaded weight of 50 ounces or more. Additionally defined as assault weapons were semi-automatic shotguns with a rotating cylinder, or with at least two of these features: a pistol grip, a folding or telescoping stock, a detachable magazine, or a fixed magazine that can hold more than five rounds.

The ban also prohibited 19 specifically named models of firearms, as well as copies of those guns. These included the AK-47, Uzi, Galil, AR-15, FN FAL, MAC-10, Steyr AUG, TEC-9, and Armsel Striker.

===Assault Weapons Ban of 2013 bill===

On December 16, 2012, two days after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Senator Dianne Feinstein said she would introduce a new assault weapons ban on the first day of Congress. Five days later, on December 21, Wayne LaPierre, chief executive of the National Rifle Association, held a news conference repeating the NRA&#x27;s opposition to additional gun laws. Feinstein and Senator Richard Blumenthal held a separate news conference in response. There, Feinstein said that it seemed to her &quot;prudent&quot; to register grandfathered assault weapons under the National Firearms Act (NFA). A two-page bill summary on the senator&#x27;s web site also mentioned registering grandfathered assault weapons under the NFA, but the text of the bill introduced to the Senate did not include that provision.

On January 24, 2013, Feinstein introduced S. 150, the &quot;Assault Weapons Ban of 2013&quot;. The bill was similar to the 1994 ban, but differed in that it used a one-feature test for a firearm to qualify as an assault weapon rather than the two-feature test of the 1994 ban. On April 17, 2013, it failed on a Senate vote of 60 to 40.

<doc id="163208" wikidata="Q436775" url="?curid=163208" title="John Burgoyne">
<text>General John &quot;Gentleman Johnny&quot; Burgoyne (24 February 1722 – 4 August 1792) was a British Army officer, playwright and politician who sat in the House of Commons of Great Britain from 1761 to 1792. He first saw action during the Seven Years&#x27; War when he participated in several battles, most notably during the Spanish invasion of Portugal in 1762.

Burgoyne is best known for his role in the American Revolutionary War. He designed an invasion scheme and was appointed to command a force moving south from Canada to split away New England and end the rebellion. Burgoyne advanced from Canada but his slow movement allowed the Americans to concentrate their forces. Instead of coming to his aid according to the overall plan, the British Army in New York City moved south to capture Philadelphia. Burgoyne fought two small battles near Saratoga but was surrounded by American forces and, with no relief in sight, surrendered his entire army of 6,200 men on 17 October 1777. His surrender, according to the historian Edmund Morgan, &quot;was a great turning point of the war, because it won for Americans the foreign assistance which was the last element needed for victory&quot;. France had been supplying the North American colonists since the spring of 1776. Burgoyne and his officers returned to England; the enlisted men became prisoners of war. He came under sharp criticism when he returned to London.

The rise of the politically friendly Shelburne ministry in 1782 saw a brief revival of his military career. He was appointed commander-in-chief of crown forces in Ireland and appointed colonel of the 4th Regiment of Foot. However the return to power of the Tories in 1784 marked the end of Burgoyne&#x27;s active service. Burgoyne was also an accomplished playwright, known for his works such as &quot;The Maid of the Oaks&quot; and &quot;The Heiress&quot;, but his plays never reached the fame of his military career. He served as a member of the House of Commons for many years, sitting for the seats of Midhurst and Preston.

==Early life==

===Family and education===
John Burgoyne was born in Sutton, Bedfordshire on 24 February 1722, son of Army officer Captain John Burgoyne (died 1768; son of Sir John Burgoyne, 3rd Baronet), of Sherbourne, Warwickshire, and Anna Maria, daughter of Charles Burneston, a wealthy Hackney merchant. There were rumours that Burgoyne was in fact the illegitimate son of Lord Bingley, who was his godfather. When Bingley died in 1731, his will specified that Burgoyne was to inherit his estate if his daughters had no male issue.

From the age of 10, Burgoyne attended the prestigious Westminster School, as did many British army officers of the time such as Thomas Gage, with whom Burgoyne would later serve. Burgoyne was athletic and outgoing and enjoyed life at the school where he made numerous important friends, in particular Lord James Strange. In August 1737, Burgoyne purchased a commission in the Horse Guards, a fashionable cavalry regiment. They were stationed in London and his duties were light, allowing him to cut a figure in high society. He soon acquired the nickname &quot;Gentleman Johnny&quot; and became well known for his stylish uniforms and general high living which saw him run up large debts. In 1741 Burgoyne sold his commission, possibly to settle gambling debts.

The outbreak of the War of the Austrian Succession led to an expansion in the size of the British Army. In April 1745, Burgoyne joined the newly raised 1st Royal Dragoons as a cornet, a commission he did not have to pay for as it was newly created. In April 1745, he was promoted to lieutenant. In 1747, Burgoyne managed to scrape the money together to purchase a captaincy. The end of the war in 1748 cut off any prospect of further active service.

===Elopement===

Through his friendship with Lord Strange, Burgoyne came to know Strange&#x27;s sister, Lady Charlotte Stanley, the daughter of Lord Derby, one of Britain&#x27;s leading politicians. After Derby refused permission for Burgoyne to marry Charlotte, they eloped together and married without his permission in April 1751. An outraged Derby cut his daughter off without a penny. Unable to support his wife otherwise, Burgoyne again sold his commission, raising £2,600, which they lived off for the next few years.

In October 1751, Burgoyne and his new wife went to live in continental Europe travelling through France and Italy. While in France, Burgoyne met and befriended the Duc de Choiseul who would later become the Foreign Minister and directed French policy during the Seven Years War. While in Rome, Burgoyne had his portrait painted by the British artist Allan Ramsay. In late 1754, Burgoyne&#x27;s wife gave birth to a daughter, Charlotte Elizabeth, who was to prove to be the couple&#x27;s only child. In the hope that a granddaughter would soften Derby&#x27;s opposition to their marriage, the Burgoynes returned to Britain in 1755. Lord Strange interceded on their behalf with Derby, who soon changed his mind and accepted them back into the family. Burgoyne soon became a favourite of Derby, who used his influence to boost Burgoyne&#x27;s prospects.

==Seven Years War==
A month after the outbreak of the Seven Years&#x27; War, Burgoyne bought a commission in the 11th Dragoons. In 1758, he became captain and lieutenant-colonel in the Coldstream Guards.

===Raids on French coast===

In 1758, he participated in several expeditions against the French coast. During this period he was instrumental in introducing light cavalry into the British Army. The two regiments then formed were commanded by George Augustus Eliott (afterwards Lord Heathfield) and Burgoyne. This was a revolutionary step, and Burgoyne was a pioneer in the early development of British light cavalry. Burgoyne admired independent thought amongst common soldiers, and encouraged his men to use their own initiative, in stark contrast to the established system employed at the time by the British army.

===Portuguese campaign===

In 1761, he sat in parliament for Midhurst, and in the following year he served as a brigadier-general in Portugal which had just entered the war. Burgoyne won particular distinction by leading his cavalry in the capture of Valencia de Alcántara and of Vila Velha de Ródão following the Battle of Valencia de Alcántara, compensating for the Portuguese loss of Almeida. This played a major part in repulsing a large Spanish force bent on invading Portugal. Burgoyne&#x27;s conduct during the invasion greatly impressed his superior; the Field Marshal Count La Lippe. La Lippe commissioned the 1766 portrait of Burgoyne by Joshua Reynolds and the painting was held by Lippe&#x27;s descendants until 1943.

==Politics==

In 1768, he was elected to the House of Commons for Preston as a Whig. For the next few years he occupied himself chiefly with his parliamentary duties, in which he was remarkable for his general outspokenness and, in particular, for his attacks on Lord Clive, who was at the time considered the nation&#x27;s leading soldier. He achieved prominence in 1772 by demanding an investigation of the East India Company alleging widespread corruption by its officials and much later in life Burgoyne would take an active part in the Impeachment of Warren Hastings. During the interwar years Burgoyne devoted much attention to art and drama (his first play, &quot;The Maid of the Oaks&quot;, was produced by David Garrick in 1775).

==American War of Independence==
===Early campaigns===
In the army, he had been promoted to major-general and made Governor of Fort William (commander of the major British Army garrison in Scotland). At the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, he was appointed to command British reinforcements, and arrived in Boston in May 1775, a few weeks after the first shots of the war had been fired. He participated as part of the garrison during the Siege of Boston, although he did not see action at the Battle of Bunker Hill, in which the British forces were led by William Howe and Henry Clinton. Frustrated by the lack of opportunities, he returned to England long before the rest of the garrison, which evacuated the city in March 1776.

In 1776, he was at the head of the British reinforcements that sailed up the Saint Lawrence River and relieved Quebec City, which was under siege by the Continental Army. He led forces under General Guy Carleton in the drive that chased the Continental Army from the province of Quebec. Carleton then led the British forces onto Lake Champlain, but was, in Burgoyne&#x27;s opinion, insufficiently bold when he failed to attempt the capture of Fort Ticonderoga after winning the naval Battle of Valcour Island in October.

===Saratoga campaign===
The following year, having convinced King George III and his government of Carleton&#x27;s faults, Burgoyne was given command of the British forces charged with gaining control of Lake Champlain and the Hudson River valley. The plan, largely of his own creation, was for Burgoyne and his force to cross Lake Champlain from Quebec and capture Ticonderoga before advancing on Albany, New York, where they would rendezvous with another British army under General Howe coming north from New York City, and a smaller force that would come down the Mohawk River valley under Barry St. Leger. This would divide New England from the southern colonies, and, it was believed, make it easier to end the rebellion.

From the beginning, Burgoyne was vastly overconfident. Leading what he believed was an overwhelming force, he saw the campaign largely as a stroll that would make him a national hero who had saved the rebel colonies for the crown. Before leaving London, he had wagered Charles James Fox 10 pounds that he would return victorious within a year. He refused to heed more cautious voices, both British and American, that suggested a successful campaign using the route he proposed was impossible, as the failed attempt the previous year had shown.

Underlining the plan was the belief that Burgoyne&#x27;s aggressive thrust from Quebec would be aided by the movements of two other large British forces under Generals Howe and Clinton, who would support the advance. However, Lord Germain&#x27;s orders dispatched from London were not clear on this point, with the effect that Howe took no action to support Burgoyne, and Clinton moved from New York too late and in too little strength to be any great help to Burgoyne.

As a result of this miscommunication, Burgoyne ended up conducting the campaign single-handedly. He was not yet aware that he would not be gaining additional support, and was still reasonably confident of success. Having amassed an army of over 7,000 troops in Quebec, Burgoyne was also led to believe by reports that he could rely on the support of large numbers of Native Americans and American Loyalists who would rally to the flag once the British came south. Even if the countryside was not as pro-British as expected, much of the area between Lake Champlain and Albany was underpopulated anyway, and Burgoyne was skeptical any major enemy force could gather there.

The campaign was initially successful. Burgoyne gained possession of the vital outposts of Fort Ticonderoga and Fort Edward, but, pushing on, decided to break his communications with Quebec. The news of the capture of Fort Ticonderoga was hailed in Britain as a great victory, which even King George III is said to have celebrated and Burgoyne was subsequently promoted to lieutenant-general. Burgoyne&#x27;s force however was eventually hemmed in by a superior force led by American Major General Horatio Gates. Several attempts to break through the enemy lines were repulsed at Saratoga in September and October 1777. Benedict Arnold played a significant role in those battles. Burgoyne&#x27;s aide-de-camp Sir Francis Clerke was killed on 15 October. On 17 October 1777, Burgoyne surrendered his entire army, numbering 5,800. This was the greatest victory the American forces had up to that point in the Revolutionary War, and it proved to be the turning point in the war, as France entered into an alliance with the American Patriots. Burgoyne&#x27;s journey through the wilderness of New York was hampered by his insistence of bringing 30 carriages of fine clothes and champagne.
===Convention Army===

Rather than an outright unconditional surrender, Burgoyne had agreed to a convention that involved his men surrendering their weapons, and returning to Europe with a pledge not to return to North America. Burgoyne had been most insistent on this point, even suggesting he would try to fight his way back to Quebec if it was not agreed. Soon afterwards the Continental Congress repudiated the treaty and imprisoned the remnants of the army in Massachusetts and Virginia, where they were sometimes maltreated. This was widely seen as revenge for the poor treatment that prisoners-of-war of the Continental Army had received while imprisoned.

Following Saratoga, the indignation in Britain against Burgoyne was great. He returned at once, with the leave of the American general, to defend his conduct and demanded but never obtained an inquiry. He was deprived of his regiment and the governorship of Fort William in Scotland, which he had held since 1769. The government demanded that Burgoyne at once return to America to re-join the Convention Army and continue negotiations for its return. When Burgoyne refused he was gazetted out of the army with loss of rank; a rare public rebuke of a high-ranking officer for which Burgoyne received widespread ridicule in Britain. He was not formally re-instated to the army until 1782 when the Whigs returned to power. Following the defeat, France recognised the United States and formally entered the war on 6 February 1778, transforming it into a global conflict.

Although Burgoyne at the time was widely held to blame for the defeat, historians have over the years shifted responsibility for the disaster at Saratoga to Lord Germain, the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Germain had overseen the overall strategy for the campaign and had significantly neglected to order General Howe to support Burgoyne&#x27;s invasion, instead leaving him to believe that he was free to launch his own attack on Philadelphia.

==Later life==
Although elected as a Whig Burgoyne had been a supporter of the North government. Following his return from Saratoga he began to associate with the Rockingham Whigs. In 1782 when his political friends came into office, Burgoyne was restored to his rank, given the colonelcy of the King&#x27;s Own Royal Regiment, made commander-in-chief in Ireland and appointed a privy councillor. After the fall of the Rockingham government in 1783, Burgoyne withdrew more and more into private life. His last public service was his participation in the impeachment of Warren Hastings. He died quite unexpectedly on 4 August 1792 at his home in Mayfair, after having been seen the previous night at the theatre in apparent good health. Burgoyne is buried in Westminster Abbey, in the North Walk of the Cloisters.

After the death of his wife in 1776, Burgoyne had four children by his mistress Susan Caulfield; one was Field Marshal John Fox Burgoyne, father of Hugh Talbot Burgoyne, VC. A grandchild of Burgoyne, Admiral Geoffrey Hornby was notable in helping to avert a war between the United States and Great Britain in the 19th century.

==Dramatist==
In his time Burgoyne was a notable playwright, writing a number of popular plays. The most notable were &quot;The Maid of the Oaks&quot; (1774) and &quot;The Heiress&quot; (1786). He assisted Richard Brinsley Sheridan in his production of &quot;The Camp&quot;, which he may have co-authored. He also wrote the libretto for William Jackson&#x27;s only successful opera, &quot;The Lord of the Manor&quot; (1780). He also wrote a translated semi-opera version of Michel-Jean Sedaine&#x27;s work &quot;Richard Coeur de lion&quot; with music by Thomas Linley the elder for the Drury Lane Theatre where it was very successful in 1788. Had it not been for his role in the American War of Independence, Burgoyne would most likely be foremost remembered today as a dramatist.

==Legacy==
Burgoyne has often been portrayed by historians and commentators as a classic example of the marginally-competent aristocratic British general who acquired his rank by political connections, rather than ability. However, accounts of those that served under him, particularly that of Corporal Roger Lamb, noted that Burgoyne &quot;shunned no danger; his presence and conduct animated the troops (for they greatly loved their general).&quot; Accounts of the lavish lifestyle that he maintained on the Saratoga campaign, combined with a gentlemanly bearing and his career as a playwright led less-than-friendly contemporaries to caricature him, as the historian George Billias wrote, &quot;a buffoon in uniform who bungled his assignments badly.&quot; Much of the historical record, Billias noted, is based upon those characterisations. Billias considered Burgoyne to be a ruthless and risk-taking general with a keen perception of his opponents and also a perceptive social and political commentator.

Burgoyne has made appearances as a character in historical and alternative history fiction. He appears as a character in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s play &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Disciple&quot; and its 1959 and 1987 film adaptions, portrayed by Laurence Olivier and Ian Richardson respectively. Historical novels by Chris Humphreys that are set during the Saratoga campaign also feature him, and alternate or mystical history versions of his campaign are featured in &quot;For Want of a Nail&quot; by Robert Sobel and the 1975 CBS Radio Mystery Theater play &quot;Windandingo&quot;.

<text>Southern rock is a subgenre of rock music and a genre of Americana. It developed in the Southern United States from rock and roll, country music, and blues and is focused generally on electric guitars and vocals.

== History ==
=== 1950s and 1960s: origins ===
Rock music&#x27;s origins lie mostly in the music of the American South, and many stars from the first wave of 1950s rock and roll such as Bo Diddley, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Buddy Holly, Fats Domino, and Jerry Lee Lewis hailed from the Deep South. However, the British Invasion and the rise of folk rock and psychedelic rock in the middle 1960s shifted the focus of new rock music away from the rural south and to large cities like Liverpool, London, Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco.

In the 1960s, rock musician Lonnie Mack blended black and white roots-music genres within the framework of rock, beginning with the hit song &quot;Memphis&quot; in 1963. Music historian Dick Shurman considers Mack&#x27;s recordings from that era &quot;a prototype of what later could be called Southern rock&quot;.

The Allman Brothers Band, from Jacksonville, Florida, made their national debut in 1969 and soon gained a loyal following. Duane Allman&#x27;s playing on the two &quot;Hour Glass&quot; albums and an &quot;Hour Glass&quot; session in early 1968 at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama had caught the ear of Rick Hall, owner of FAME.

In November 1968, Hall hired Allman to play on an album with Wilson Pickett. Allman&#x27;s work on that album, &quot;Hey Jude&quot; (1968), got him hired as a full-time session musician at Muscle Shoals and brought him to the attention of a number of other musicians, such as Eric Clapton, who later related how he heard Pickett&#x27;s version of &quot;Hey Jude&quot; on his car radio and called Atlantic Records to find out who the guitarist was: &quot;To this day,&quot; Clapton said, &quot;I&#x27;ve never heard better rock guitar playing on an R&amp;B record. It&#x27;s the best.&quot;

Author Scott B. Bomar speculates the term &quot;Southern rock&quot; may have been coined in 1972 by Mo Slotin, writing for Atlanta&#x27;s underground paper, &quot;The Great Speckled Bird&quot;, in a review of an Allman Brothers Band concert. 

=== 1970s: peak of popularity ===
Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident in 1971.

Their blues rock sound incorporated long jams informed by jazz and also drew from native elements of country and folk. They were also contemporary in their electric guitar and keyboard delivery. Gregg Allman commented that &quot;Southern rock&quot; was a redundant term, like &quot;rock rock.&quot;

Early 1970s, popular musicians in the southern area included Creedence Clearwater Revival (from California), Dale Hawkins, Delaney &amp; Bonnie, Janis Joplin, Leon Russell, and Tony Joe White.

Lynyrd Skynyrd of Jacksonville, Florida, is known for &quot;Free Bird&quot;, &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Special&quot;, and &quot;What&#x27;s Your Name&quot;. 70s southern rock bands include the Atlanta Rhythm Section, ZZ Top, Black Oak Arkansas, Potliquor, Barefoot Jerry, Grinderswitch, Wet Willie, Blackfoot, Johnny Winter, Edgar Winter Group, and Sea Level.

=== Country rock bands ===
Charlie Daniels&#x27; self-titled debut album, released in 1970, was a pivotal recording in the development of the Southern rock genre, &quot;because it points the way to how the genre could and would sound, and how country music could retain its hillbilly spirit and rock like a mother,&quot; according to 
Stephen Thomas Erlewine. Erlewine described Daniels as &quot;a redneck rebel, not fitting into either the country or the rock &amp; roll [...] but, in retrospect, he sounds like a visionary, pointing the way to the future when southern rockers saw no dividing lines between rock, country, and blues, and only saw it all as sons of the south.&quot;

Daniels later formed the Charlie Daniels Band, a group which fused rock, country, blues, and jazz. Erlewine described the band&#x27;s sound as &quot;a distinctly Southern blend&quot; which emphasized improvisation in their instrumentation. After the success of &quot;The Devil Went Down to Georgia&quot;, a single which Erlewine described as a &quot;roaring country-disco fusion&quot;, Daniels shifted his sound from rock to country music and &quot;helped shape the sound of country-rock&quot;.

The Marshall Tucker Band, from Spartanburg, South Carolina, opened many of The Allman Brothers Band concerts using elements of blues, country rock and blues rock in their music. They also collaborated with Charlie Daniels. Their self-titled album, released in 1973, included the hit &quot;Can&#x27;t You See&quot;. Perhaps known best for the single &quot;Fire on the Mountain,&quot; the Marshall Tucker Band hit &quot;Heard it in a Love Song&quot; charted in 1977.

Lynyrd Skynyrd played British hard rock influenced music until the deaths of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant and two other members of the group in a 1977 airplane crash. After this tragic plane crash, members Allen Collins and Gary Rossington started the Rossington Collins Band.

=== 1980s and 1990s: continuing influence ===
By the beginning of the 1980s, the Allman Brothers Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd had disbanded, and Capricorn Records had gone bankrupt. Leading acts of the genre (in particular, 38 Special) had become enmeshed in arena rock. With the rise of MTV, new wave, funk, urban contemporary, and heavy metal, most surviving Southern rock groups were relegated to secondary or regional venues. Rock musicians such as Molly Hatchet, Outlaws, Georgia Satellites, the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Jimmie Vaughan, Point Blank, Tom Petty, Bruce Hornsby, Steve Earle, Widespread Panic, and Kentucky Headhunters, emerged as popular Southern bands across the southeastern United States during the 1980s and 1990s.

During the 1990s, the Allman Brothers reunited and became a strong touring and recording presence again, and the jam band scene revived interest in extended improvised music.

Georgia&#x27;s alternative rock band R.E.M. released the album &quot;Fables of the Reconstruction&quot; which explicitly invokes the Reconstruction Era in the title and is considered a Southern Gothic album. The 1990s also saw the Black Crowes rise to mainstream popularity with the releases of &quot;Shake Your Money Maker&quot; (3× platinum), the &quot;Southern Harmony and Musical Companion&quot; (debut at #1 on the Billboard 200 and certified 2× platinum), and &quot;Amorica&quot; (certified Gold).

=== 2000 to present ===
New musicians such as the Tedeschi Trucks Band (the Derek Trucks Band), Warren Haynes, Gov&#x27;t Mule, Chris Duarte Group, Dixie Witch, Whiskey Myers, Widespread Panic, the Black Crowes, Blackberry Smoke, Kid Rock, and the Allman Betts Band are continuing the Southern rock art form.

In 2005, singer Bo Bice took an explicitly Southern rock sensibility and appearance to a runner-up finish on the normally pop-oriented &quot;American Idol&quot; television program, with a performance of the Allmans&#x27; &quot;Whipping Post&quot; and later performing Skynyrd&#x27;s &quot;Free Bird&quot; and, with Skynyrd on stage with him, &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;.

Southern rock currently plays on the radio in the United States, but mostly on oldies stations and classic rock stations. Although this class of music gets minor radio play, there is still a following for older bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Allman Brothers play in venues with sizable crowds.

A number of books in the 2000s have chronicled Southern rock&#x27;s history, including Randy Poe&#x27;s &quot;Skydog: The Duane Allman Story&quot; and Rolling Stone writer Mark Kemp&#x27;s &quot;Dixie Lullaby: A Story of Music, Race &amp; New Beginnings in a New South&quot;. &quot;Turn It Up&quot; was released by Ron Eckerman, Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s former manager and plane crash survivor. Sociologist Jason T. Eastman analyzes contemporary Southern rock to illustrate changes in today&#x27;s southern identity in his book &quot;The Southern Rock Revival: The Old South in a New World&quot;.

South rock musicians like Little Big Town, Billy Currington and Ryan Adams combine the Southern rock sound with country, bluegrass and blues. This has been propelled by record labels like Capitol Records Nashville, Mercury Nashville and Lost Highway Records.

<text>Arena rock (also known as pomp rock, stadium rock, or corporate rock) is a style of rock music that became mainstream in the 1970s. It typically involves radio-friendly rock music that was designed to be played for large audiences.

As hard rock and pop rock became increasingly popular, groups began creating material inherently designed for performance to crowds and major concerts. Arena rock also developed from their use of more commercially oriented sounds that were intended for radio play. The highly produced music, including both upbeat, dramatic songs and slower power ballads, features strong emphasis on melody and frequently employs anthemic choruses. Other major characteristics include prominent guitar effects and the use of keyboard instruments. Typical themes of arena rock lyrics include love, heartbreak, angst, and sentimentality.

Many of the above labels are used pejoratively, and discussions over music criticism often delve into the question of whether musicians&#x27; focus on rock spectacle and mass appeal results in compromised artistic merit, particularly in terms of the difference between the interests of the &quot;middlebrow&quot; populace versus other listeners. Interest in arena rock is stereotypically associated with working-class to middle-class men living in either Canada or the United States (including so-called &quot;yuppies&quot;), which has been cited as the basis for condescending prejudice over social status in some criticisms. However, the style of music has been highly successful worldwide, particularly in terms of touring.

==Characteristics==
Historian Gary A. Donaldson has summed up arena rock as &quot;big hair, big voices, and really big guitars&quot;. In contrast to other types of music with a more raw, time-worn approach, arena rock musicians emphasize dramatic production. With bands deliberately designing their material for large audiences, the songs focus on melody, often featuring strident choruses. Guitar effects and the use of keyboard instruments are significant elements of the genre. Fireworks displays, use of smoke, and methods of sophisticated lighting, have become part of the visual aesthetics of what is known as arena rock.

==Development and popularity==
===1960s–1970s===
Despite the differences in terms of genre, Beatlemania and the gigantic, screaming crowds that greeted the Beatles as they performed in the U.S. proved influential on arena rock, particularly with artists&#x27; complex views of the connection between themselves as musicians and the primal needs of their mass audiences. The rise of the rock style largely signified the end of the hippie-type of idealistic 1960s culture, particularly after the disillusionment that followed the infamous Altamont Free Concert of 1969, and represented a newer form of musical expression that was still confident and strident while also being more commercial. With hundreds of people injured and one dying, said concert has been described as &quot;the spiritual death of the decade&quot;.

In the period from the end of the 1960s to the middle of the 1970s, advances in technology allowed for the increased power of amplification and sound systems without losing sound quality, thus giving hard rock bands the opportunity to use larger and larger venues. Attributing the birth of arena rock to the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1969 US tour, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the tour number 19 on their list of the 50 key events in rock music history. Prior to the tour the loudest sound at big-capacity shows was often the crowd, so the Stones ensured they had lighting and sound systems that would allow them to be seen and heard in the biggest arenas, with &quot;The Guardian&quot; stating their &quot;combination of front-of-house excellence and behind the scenes savvy took the business of touring to an entirely new level.&quot;

The Flint, Michigan–born Grand Funk Railroad, which advertised itself as a &quot;people&#x27;s band&quot; on the release of their 1969 debut album given their nationwide touring, played to about 125,000 in Georgia and 180,000 in Texas within a short period of time. Although hard rock influenced heavy metal music and the arena rock style, they shared an emphasis on loudness and heavy sound that had dominated the rock mainstream from late 70s to early 80s.

Bands such as Styx, Toto, Journey, REO Speedwagon and Boston were popular arena rock acts of the late 1970s and early 1980s. 

Arena rock&#x27;s popularity, being described as &quot;a dominant force&quot; musically from the 1970s onward, resulted in a number of musical reactions. The British pub rock movement arose in large part due to its emphasis on small-scale events, aimed at promoting a friendly, intimate connection between performers and audiences. The explosion of punk rock and punk subcultures in general in the 1970s directly challenged the perceived excesses of mainstream rock at the time.

===1980s–1990s===
The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame states that the following decade, particularly the late 1980s, is &quot;considered a golden era of hard rock in terms of commercial airplay&quot;.

The music of the 1970s often reflected changing philosophical interests compared to previous decades, with personal growth, private revelation, and self-improvement gaining more emphasis compared to past interests in collectivist social activism. The period coming to be known dismissively as the &quot;Me Decade&quot;, rock releases frequently celebrated a hedonistic, self-indulgent abandonment. Multiple artists also pursued an arena rock sound based on individual inspiration and achievement, particularly in anthemic songs about independence. In terms of the changing trends into the 1980s and onward, the style essentially replaced disco in terms of mass pop culture appeal.

During the 1980s, arena rock evolved in a way that was performance-driven yet far more aggressive and confrontational. Mainstream rock became dominated by these hair metal (also known as &quot;glam metal&quot; and &quot;pop metal&quot;) bands, with a large emphasis still being put on both on music and visuals. Flashy clothing with elements such as heavy makeup and dramatic hairstyles became common. Prominent examples of this genre include Def Leppard, Mötley Crüe and Poison. Their popularity crashed after the success of alternative rock and grunge bands who began to break through into popular consciousness with an even more abrasive sound, particularly artists influenced by the success of Nirvana in the early 1990s.

The website AllMusic has opined that &quot;[o]ld-fashioned hard rock became a scarce commodity in the post-alternative rock era; after grunge, many guitar bands not only adopted a self-consciously serious attitude, but also resisted the urge to write fist-pumping, arena-ready choruses.&quot; Multiple artists have continued to play on to cult followings. Bands Bon Jovi and Van Halen in particular achieved significant commercial success into the 1990s. Later in the 90s and 2000s, post-grunge acts such as Creed and Nickelback released their own successful arena rock anthems.

==Critical perspectives==
Ethnomusicologist Chris McDonald of Cape Breton University has argued that the label of a musical artist as &quot;arena rock&quot; and &quot;old wave&quot;, done by music critics dismissively, originates from a background of classism influenced by modernism. Thus, mass popularity is put forth as an argument &quot;against&quot; perceived artistic merit, through the eyes of critics focused on high culture while disdaining market forces, particularly given the white, working class to middle class makeup of the fans. Focusing on the Canadian trio Rush, McDonald stated that the panning of the group as &quot;dazzling yet empty&quot; due to the musicians&#x27; focus on rock spectacle is a consequence of critics&#x27; psychological distance from the &quot;middlebrow&quot; populace that listens to them.

The use of commercial sponsorship for the large-scale tours and concerts of the 1970s, a practice that continues, has caused the music to pick up the pejorative label of being &quot;corporate rock&quot;. Writer Chris Smith argued that the style dehumanized listeners, setting them up as passive recipients rather than allowing them to truly engage with musicians, and additionally put different bands in a position akin to homogenized products. It has also been regarded as essentially malign capitalist propaganda. The distance between taste-makers&#x27; judgment of certain groups as &quot;uncool&quot; and their mass audience appeal had existed since the style&#x27;s origins after the ending of the 1960s, and a wide variety of other dismissive terms have been used such as &quot;dad rock&quot;.
Deliberately playing against criticism and claiming to represent the people against the elite has been used in musical marketing. The association of arena rock with the so-called &quot;yuppies&quot; and their conspicuous consumption additionally has tied the style with a group often maligned in the media, subject to mocking caricatures and other kinds of ridicule. However, as pointed out by historian Gary A. Donaldson, the music eclipsed the waning genre of disco and related bands successfully toured across the world.

<doc id="163213" wikidata="Q208994" url="?curid=163213" title="1 (Beatles album)">
<text>1 is a greatest hits album of the English rock band the Beatles, originally released on 13 November 2000. The album features virtually every number-one single the band achieved in the United Kingdom or United States from 1962 to 1970. Issued on the 30th anniversary of the band&#x27;s break-up, it was their first compilation album available on only one CD. &quot;1&quot; was a commercial success and topped charts worldwide. It has sold over 31 million copies. Since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking US album sales in January 1991, &quot;1&quot; is the fourth-best-selling album in the US, the best-selling album of the 2000s decade in the US, as well as the best-selling album of the decade worldwide.

&quot;1&quot; was remastered and reissued in September 2011. It was remixed and reissued again in several different deluxe editions in November 2015, the most comprehensive of which is a three-disc set entitled &quot;1+&quot;, which includes video discs of Beatles promotional films. As of June 2015, &quot;1&quot; was the sixth-best-selling album of the 21st century in the UK, having sold over 3.1 million copies.

==Background==
&quot;1&quot; was compiled by producer George Martin and former band members Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. The album contains the 27 Beatles songs that went to number one in the United Kingdom on the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; Top 50 chart or in the United States on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. Despite Harrison&#x27;s &quot;For You Blue&quot; charting at number 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;, along with the A-side &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;, Capitol Records treated &quot;For You Blue&quot; as strictly a B-side and did not promote it as an A-side. &quot;Day Tripper&quot; was included on &quot;1&quot; since it charted at number 1 in the UK as a double A-side with &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;, while in the US, only &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; was number 1. Two singles written by John Lennon and released in both the UK and US were omitted as they did not top either the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart or the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100: &quot;Please Please Me&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;. The former was the Beatles&#x27; first UK number one single in all British charts except &quot;Record Retailer&quot;, reaching the top spot in the music magazines &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and &quot;Disc&quot;. &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; was part of a double A-side single with &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, which reached the top spot in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and peaked at number 2 in the other UK charts, behind Engelbert Humperdinck&#x27;s &quot;Release Me&quot;; while in the US, &quot;Penny Lane&quot; topped the charts, but &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; did not as it was listed separately. The compilation was created before the release of the single &quot;Now and Then&quot;, which would later chart at number 1 on the UK Singles Chart in 2023.

The album is a combination of both the US and UK versions of the 1982 compilation &quot;20 Greatest Hits&quot;, with the addition of &quot;Something&quot; (which was left off &quot;20 Greatest Hits&quot; because of time constraints). On &quot;1&quot;, &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was included in its original full-length version (slightly over seven minutes), whereas the American version of &quot;20 Greatest Hits&quot; contained a shortened version.

===Remastering===
Before &quot;1&quot;, all 27 songs were mainly available on two remastered CD releases: firstly on the respective Beatles studio albums released in 1987 (as well as &quot;Past Masters, Volume One&quot; and &quot;Past Masters, Volume Two&quot;, released in 1988). The second remastering was made available on the CD versions for &quot;1962–1966&quot; and &quot;1967–1970&quot;, released in 1993.

The songs on &quot;1&quot; were remastered specifically for the release in 2000. According to the liner notes of the album, the original analogue masters were &quot;digitally remastered at 24 bits resolution, processed using Sonic Solutions NoNoise technology and mastered to 16-bit using Prism SNS Noise Shaping&quot;. The remastering was overseen by Peter Mew of Abbey Road Studios and took place there. In 2011, &quot;1&quot; was remastered and reissued on CD. In 2015 it was remastered again and remixed by Giles Martin; when Martin began to assist with fixing up the audio tracks for the &quot;1+&quot; video clips, he realised that his goal of making them &quot;more immersive&quot; should also apply to &quot;1&quot;. For the remixing project, Martin commented: &quot;The remasters went back to these final mix tapes and remastered them. They cleaned them up and then they EQ-ed them and released them. What we&#x27;re doing is remixing. We&#x27;re going not to the final mix, we&#x27;re creating our own mixes.&quot; About his remixing approach, Martin said: &quot;My approach was to be respectful of everything, I had sessions and sessions where I flipped between previously remastered stereos, the mono remasters, and the remixes we&#x27;ve done. I flip between everything and make sure I prefer what we&#x27;ve done.&quot;

===Package===

The package of &quot;1&quot; was intended to be simplistic and ambitious at the same time. Its cover was designed by Rick Ward, and consists of a pop art-style yellow number one on a red background. The emphasis on the &quot;1&quot; digit was used on many of the compilations of number-one hits by different artists that followed this album; for example, &quot;ELV1S&quot; by Elvis Presley and &quot;Number Ones&quot; by the Bee Gees. The album&#x27;s back cover features the famous photos of the Beatles taken by Richard Avedon and copyrighted on 17 August 1967. The design exclusively uses variations of the Helvetica typeface.

&quot;1&quot; was released worldwide in CD and cassette. The vinyl format was released only in the United Kingdom. The CD includes a 32-page booklet with a coloured page with international picture covers (a total of 163 covers are displayed on the whole booklet) and details (recording date, location, release date, chart stats) for each of the singles. It also includes on its first two pages a collage with 27 1s in different colours (all of them following the same art as the cover) with the sentence &quot;27 No. 1 singles = &quot;1&quot;&quot; (which was used as a catch phrase for the promo ads for the album), and a foreword by George Martin.

The LP and cassette keep the main art of the CD version, but in a different form. The double vinyl record version was not released in the US, but the imported British edition was available. The vinyl version features a large full-colour fold-out poster showing 126 picture sleeves (37 fewer than on the CD), and reproductions of the four Richard Avedon photos. The Avedon portraits also appear on the inside of the gate-fold cover. The records have custom labels featuring the same graphics as the front cover and are packaged in custom inner sleeves. The deluxe packaging of the vinyl album, with its four portraits and poster, is reminiscent to that of their titular 1968 album. The cassette included a 20-page insert, including the collage, the George Martin commentary and paged Avedon&#x27;s portraits on its inlay and the whole description for the tracks as a total of 36 covers on its inlay reverse.

==Reception==
&quot;1&quot; received universal acclaim. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album five stars out of five. He stated that there is &quot;no question that this is all great music&quot;, although to him &quot;there&#x27;s really no reason for anyone who owns all the records to get this too&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;1&quot; went on to inspire the release of a wave of compilation albums, in particular three other &quot;number ones&quot; albums: Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;ELV1S&quot; (2002), Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Number Ones&quot; (2003) and the Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;Number Ones&quot; (2004). Other compilations inspired by &quot;1&quot; issued included Prince&#x27;s &quot;The Very Best of Prince&quot; (2001), Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nirvana&quot; (2002), the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Forty Licks&quot; (2002), Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (2001), The Who&#x27;s &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot; (2002) and Dean Martin&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (2004).

==Sales and chart performance==
The reception of &quot;1&quot; surpassed all critical and commercial expectations. It became the highest-selling CD of 2000 and, some time later, of the entire decade. This achievement made the Beatles the first and only artist to have the best-selling albums of two different decades: they also released the best-selling album of the 1960s, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. No tracks from &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; appear on this album. With this album, the Beatles also achieved having an album hit the number 1 position in the US in four non-consecutive decades (1960s, 1970s, 1990s and 2000s).

In the United Kingdom, &quot;1&quot; became the Beatles&#x27; 15th number 1 album with sales of 319,126 copies (achieving record sales for only one week in 2000). On 18 December 2000, Ananova.com reported that the album has &quot;become 2000&#x27;s biggest-selling album—in only five weeks.&quot; &quot;1&quot; was the first album to stay at the top spot for nine weeks in almost ten years (the last being the Eurythmics&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;), the best-selling album of 2000, and the fourth-best-selling album of the 2000s so far in the UK. In its eleventh week, &quot;1&quot; sold a total of two million copies in the UK. It spent a total of 46 weeks inside the Top 75. In July 2013 it was certified 10× platinum by the BPI, for over 3 million copies sold in the UK. It is the 21st-best-selling album in the UK, according to an assessment by the Official Charts Company and the British Phonographic Industry that counted album sales in the UK from 28 July 1956 to the present day, and the second-best-selling Beatles album in that country (only beaten by &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, which is the UK&#x27;s third-best-selling album). As of July 2016, the album has sold over 3,230,000 copies in the UK.

In the United States, the response was similar. &quot;1&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 during the week of 2 December 2000 with sales totaling over 595,500 copies.
In its second week, sales increased to 662,000 but it was knocked off the top spot by Backstreet Boys&#x27; &quot;Black &amp; Blue&quot; which sold 1.59 million units, therefore, &quot;1&quot; fell off to number two on its second week on chart. By doing so, the album became the sixth to debut at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and post a SoundScan increase in its second week and the first to do so after opening with a sum of more than half a million copies. The following week it stayed at number two selling 607,000 units. During the week of 23 December 2000, its fourth week on chart, &quot;1&quot; moved 671,000 copies and returned to the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The next week, on 30 December 2000 it stayed at the top of the chart selling 823,500 copies. On 10 February 2001, after being the number one album for eight non-consecutive weeks, &quot;1&quot; fell off to number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 173,500 units sold, a 19.5% dip in sales; by the time this happened, the album had sold almost six million units. The album spent a total of eight weeks at number 1 and sold 1,258,667 copies during the week before Christmas of 2000. With this number, the Beatles achieved a new record: it was the seventh highest one-week sales in Soundscan history, the highest for an album not in its first week of sales, and the highest for an album comprising previously released music. The album spent 309 weeks inside the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was the sixth-best-selling album in the United States in 2000 with 5,100,000 copies sold according to Nielsen SoundScan. On 30 August 2011 the band announced through their Facebook account that the album was available to pre-order from iTunes and that it was digitally remastered. On 24 September 2011, after the album made its digital debut in the iTunes Store it re-entered on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number four selling 60,000 units, it also topped the iTunes album charts in the US, Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, Mexico, Switzerland, Spain, New Zealand and Greece according to a Capitol/EMI press release. Its digital launch on the iTunes Store was accompanied with a price of $9.99 and a Twitter campaign with the hashtag #MyBeatles1 asking their fans: What is your favorite &quot;1&quot; track? Resulting in many celebrities and stars posting their favorites, too. In 2015, after it was remastered again and remixed by Giles Martin, &quot;1&quot; re-entered on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number six selling 40,000 units. It was certified eleven times platinum by the RIAA on 8 March 2010 denoting shipments of eleven million units, and &quot;1&quot; is included on the list of the Top 100 Albums by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album is the best-selling album of the 21st century in the US and the fourth-best-selling album in the Soundscan era (1991–present). As of October 2019, the album has had sold 13 million copies in the US. In the US, the album secured the Beatles a fourth decade in which they placed an album at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart.

In Canada, &quot;1&quot; debuted at number 1 on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 54,668 copies in its first week. The album was certified Diamond (1,000,000 units) by the CRIA in February 2001, just four months after its release. As of 2009, &quot;1&quot; has sold 1,103,000 units in Canada, making it the fifth-best-selling album ever in Canada of the Nielsen SoundScan era.

In Germany, &quot;1&quot; debuted at number 1 and stayed there for nine non-consecutive weeks. It stayed seventeen weeks in the top ten of the German Albums Chart and fifty weeks in the total chart. By selling 1,650,000 copies and reaching 11× Gold, it is the third-best-selling album of the decade 2000–2009 and the best-selling non-German language album.

In 2009, Apple Corps, the Beatles&#x27; company, stated that worldwide sales of &quot;1&quot; had exceeded 31 million copies. Worldwide in 2000 the album sold 13.8 million copies, with 2 million or more copies sold during 2 consecutive weeks, and was the fourth-best-selling album behind Eminem&#x27;s &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot;, Britney Spears&#x27; &quot;Oops!... I Did It Again&quot;, and Santana&#x27;s &quot;Supernatural&quot;.

<text>The Brampton Battalion were a junior ice hockey team in the Ontario Hockey League. The team was based in Brampton, Ontario, Canada and started playing in 1998. As a result of consistently having among the lowest attendance in the OHL (last place in the OHL for its final four seasons), the team was relocated to North Bay, Ontario for the 2013–14 OHL season.

==History==
The Brampton Battalion was granted an expansion franchise on December 3, 1996. Major Junior A hockey returned to Brampton for the first time since 1963, when the Brampton 7Ups played in the Metro Junior A League before returning to the Junior B level. Brampton was part of the return of major junior hockey to the Greater Toronto Area in the late 1990s that included the Mississauga IceDogs and the revived Toronto St. Michael&#x27;s Majors.

In 2005, team owner Scott Abbott was inducted into the Brampton Sports Hall of Fame for his work in building the franchise.

The Battalion name was chosen from community suggestions, and was also adopted by the competitive minor hockey program. The team was covered by local television Rogers Community Cable 10 and the local newspaper, &quot;The Brampton Guardian&quot;. The Battalion&#x27;s secondary school educational programs were co-ordinated through Turner Fenton Secondary School.

===Early days in the West===
The Battalion began play for the 1998–99 OHL season in the Midwest Division of the Western Conference. The Battalion played their first game on September 24, 1998, losing to the host Peterborough Petes by a 5–1 score. Jason Maleyko scored the first goal in club history. The Battalion played their first game at the Powerade Centre on October 9, 1998, losing to the Kitchener Rangers by a score of 5–1. The first win in club history would come on October 18 when the Battalion beat the visiting Sudbury Wolves 5–4.
The Battalion finished the season with only 8 wins, 57 losses, and 3 ties for last in the Western Conference and 19th in the league ahead of only the Mississauga Ice Dogs.

The 1999–2000 season was better for the Battalion as they finished with a 25–29–14 record for a 3rd-place finish in the Midwest Division and 7th in the Western Conference which gave them their first trip to the post season. The Battalion won their first ever playoff game vs. the Erie Otters with a 5–2 score. However, the 2nd place Otters took the series in 6 games.

The 2000–01 season was the first season in club history that the team would score a record above the .500 mark with a final tally of 33–22–13 for a 3rd-place finish in the Midwest Division and 5th in the Western Conference. The Battalion would take on the 4th place Guelph Storm in the first round of the playoffs and won the series by sweeping the Storm in 4 games for the first playoff series win in club history. In round 2 for the second straight year the Troops took on the 1st place Erie Otters. After the Troops took game 1 the Otters would win four in a row and win the series in five games.

The Battalion fell back to below the .500 mark in the 2001–02 season posting a 26–35–7 record for last in the division and conference as the team missed the playoffs for the 2nd time in 4 years.

===Move to the Eastern Conference===
During the 2002 off season the North Bay Centennials were bought and moved to Saginaw, Michigan to become the Spirit and thus leaving the East and West unbalanced so the Battalion were moved to the Eastern Conference and given North Bay&#x27;s former spot in the Central Division. Once again the Battalion surged above the .500 mark finishing with a 34–24–10 record good enough to win their first Division Championship in franchise history beating the Toronto St. Michaels Majors by only 2 points.
During the 2003 playoffs the Battalion started what would eventually become a rivalry with the Barrie Colts defeating the Colts in the first round in six games. The second round would see the top two in the division as the Battalion faced Toronto. Brampton started off the series well beating Toronto in game 1 by a 7–0 score. However Toronto eventually proved too much for Brampton as the Majors would win four straight and take the series in only 5 games.

The Battalion did not fare well during the 2003–04 regular season, as their record fell to 25–32–11. However, the record was good enough for 7th in the east and a first round matchup with a heavily favored Ottawa 67&#x27;s team who had won the East Division. With their backs against the wall, the Battalion shocked many as they took the 67&#x27;s to seven games, winning game 7 and the series in Ottawa and advancing to the 2nd round. For the second straight year, in round 2, the Battalion would have to face the Eastern Conference Champions, the Toronto St. Michael&#x27;s Majors. This time the Majors jumped out to a 3–0 series lead. Brampton was able to win 1 game, to force a 5th, but that was as far as they would get as the Majors won the series.

During the 2004–05 season the Battalion stood tall as they became part of a huge race involving several teams to not only win the Central Division title, but the Eastern Conference Championship as well.
Despite posting a 33–24–11 record, Brampton would lose the race to the Mississauga Ice Dogs and finish 3rd in the central, and 4th in the conference, setting up a first round match up with the Sudbury Wolves.
The series with the Wolves was an intense one. The Wolves took the first two games, including one in overtime. However, Brampton clawed their way back, but by game 6 in Sudbury, the Battalion were on the brink of elimination. The game went to double overtime with the Wolves scoring a power play goal to end Brampton&#x27;s season.

===Curse vs. the Colts===

The 2005–06 season would become the best season in club history; however, the season did not start off that way. After a somewhat mediocre start the club by mid February had climbed to a record of 30–21–1–2. With 14 games remaining on the schedule the Battalion would have to win every single game to even have a shot at the division championship, so that is exactly what they did. The Battalion would win the last 14 games of the regular season to establish a franchise record for straight wins (a record that eventually fell during the 2008–09 season) to finish the season with a record of 44–21–1–2 and winning the Central Division Championship by only 1 single point over the Barrie Colts. In the first round of the playoffs the Battalion knocked off the Belleville Bulls in six games before having to face the Barrie Colts in round 2.
Before the series started everybody expected it to be a long and great series. In the first 2 games the teams traded 4–1 wins before the flood gates opened and the Colts took control of the series. In game 3 the Colts took a dominating 6–1 win before destroying Brampton in game 4 11–2. Game 5 was much closer but the Colts still took the game 3–2 and the series in only five games and thus beginning the Battalion&#x27;s Curse of the Colts.

With several key players like future NHLer Wojtek Wolski, Luch Aquino, and Daren Machesney gone the team slumped in the 2006–07 season barely making the playoffs with a 27–36–1–4 record, only good enough for the last playoff spot (8th) in the East. During the 1st round they would have to go up against the #1 Barrie Colts who still had most of their players from the previous season&#x27;s series. Brampton was able to keep most games close but Barrie kept coming out on top. In game 4 on home ice the Battalion on the brink of elimination had a 4–1 lead midway through the third period and appeared to be on their way to a win before the Colts scored 3 goals in less than 7 minutes to force overtime. In OT it took the Colts only 5 minutes to score and thus end the series in 4 straight games.

The 2007–08 season saw the team celebrate their 10th season of OHL hockey and the fans saw a great team on the ice as things went much better for the Battalion, with sophomore centre Cody Hodgson, rookie forward Matt Duchene, and veteran winger John Hughes, the team posted several wins finishing with a 42–22–1–3 record, just shy of the club record of 91 points set in 05–06. During the season the Battalion had their first 10-goal game in club history as on September 23 the host Battalion beat up on the Sudbury Wolves 10–2. For the 3rd time in 6 years the team took home the Central Division Championship. In the first round the Battalion once again were set to face the Barrie Colts, who this season had lost many of their key players and had only finished 7th in the east. With Brampton heavily favored to win the series the Colts shocked as Barrie won the first two games by 2–1 and 3–2 (OT) scores. The Battalion were able to come back and win game 3 by a score of 5–1; however, the Colts would continue to stand behind the absolutely amazing goaltending of Michael Hutchinson in game 4 winning 2–1 in overtime. With Brampton on the brink of elimination on home ice in game 5 Hutchinson stood tall again as the Colts won the game 2–0 and upset the Battalion in only five games. For the 3rd straight year Brampton had been eliminated by the Barrie Colts.

In 10 full seasons of OHL hockey the Battalion have a regular season record of 297–301–52–21–9 (W-L-T-OTL-SL) in 680 games.

===2008–09: Run to the finals===

After 3 straight years of being knocked out of the playoffs by the Colts the Battalion built up a roster to make a deep run in 2008/2009. Brampton got off to a slow 2–6 start but with the return of Cody Hodgson and the addition of Evgeny Grachev the Troops went on a run of 16 straight wins setting a new franchise record for straight wins. The streak was the longest that any team achieved during the 08/09 regular season. Brampton also set a record of 12 straight home wins from October to December (another franchise record). During December Battalion forwards Cody Hodgson and Evgeny Grachev represented their respective countries (Canada and Russia) at the World Junior Hockey Championships in Ottawa. Grachev helped team Russia to a Bronze medal while Hodgson set a tournament high 16 points to lead Canada to its 5th straight gold medal. After the tournament Brampton added more to their roster acquiring all star goaltender Thomas McCollum (who had also played for his home country of U.S.A. at the World Juniors), defenceman Josh Day, and forwards, Anthony Peluso, Matt Kang and Andrew Merrett. Brampton would enjoyed another long 12-game winning streak in January and February. At the end of the regular season Brampton would finish with a franchise best record of 47–19–1–1 to win the central division for the third time in four years.
In the first round of the playoffs the Battalion would sweep the Peterborough Petes four straight. The second round saw the only time in franchise history the Battalion would face their Peel Region rivals in Mississauga. The Troops won the first two games before the Majors won the next two to tie the series. The Battalion however came back with another two wins, taking game six in Mississauga by a 3–2 score to advance to the conference finals for the first time in team history. In the Eastern final the Battalion would win game one on the road in Belleville before hammering the Bulls in game two by a 7–2 score. Belleville would win game three on home ice before Brampton took a 4–3 come from behind win at the Bunker in game four. Game five in Belleville became the longest game in Battalion history as with a birth to the finals on the line the Troops took the Bulls to double overtime tied 2–2 before Nick Palmieri would score at 18:44 of the second overtime to send the series back to Brampton for game six. The Troops took a 2–0 lead early in the sixth game before the Bulls stormed ahead 3–2 in the second period. The Troops then exploded in the third with five goals to win the game 7–4 to win their first ever conference championship. In the OHL Finals Brampton would go up against the regular season champion Windsor Spitfires. Windsor pounded Brampton in game one by a score of 10–1. Windsor then took a 4–1 lead early in game two before holding on for a 5–3 win. The Battalion would finally win in game three on the road beating the Spits by a 4–2 score. However Windsor answered with another victory in Brampton this time 4–1. With the series on the line in game 5 on the road the Battalion were down 1–0 for most of the game before scoring with three minutes left in the third period to send the game to overtime. However the Spits would get an early powerplay and a goal by Taylor Hall ended the Battalion&#x27;s season and give the Windsor Spitfires their first OHL Championship in 21 years. They would go on to win the Memorial Cup in Rimouski. After it was all over Battalion import Evgeny Grachev was named OHL rookie of the year. Matt Duchene collected Scholastic Player of the Year honors, while Cody Hodgson named the OHL&#x27;s most Sportsmanlike player and Most Outstanding Player. Hodgson then collected CHL Player Of The Year honors, the first Battalion player to ever receive the award. Finally in June Matt Duchene was chosen 3rd overall in the NHL Entry Draft by the Colorado Avalanche.

===2009–2013: The final years In Brampton===

After the teams run to the OHL finals in 2008–09 the Battalion fell to mid-pack in 2009–10.
Most of the offense from the previous season was gone as Sean Jones led the team in scoring with 32 goals and 49 points. Cody Hodgson missed most of the season with a back injury. He returned to play 13 games near the end of the regular season but would miss the final 5 games with a foot injury before returning for the playoffs. The Battalion would finish the season with 25 wins and 64 points, good enough for 5th place in the Eastern Conference. The team set a franchise low in goals against with only 181, but also set the franchise low for goals for with just 167.
Brampton would face the Kingston Frontenacs in the first round of the playoffs. Brampton would take the first two games before Kingston would take the next two. Brampton would win game 5 in overtime in Kingston but the Fronts would force a game 7 following a victory in Brampton. The Battalion playing in just the second game 7 in franchise history would jump out to a 4–0 lead before holding on for a 5–2 victory in Kingston to advance. 
The Battalion would face the OHL&#x27;s leading Barrie Colts in the second round. The Colts would sweep the Battalion in four straight as the Troops fell to Barrie in the playoffs for the fourth time in five years.

The Battalion would go through the 2010–11 season with a very young group of defenceman and goaltenders. Following a lengthy losing streak in November GM Stan Butler traded goaltender Jacob Riley to Sudbury while releasing import goaltender Dennis Saikkonen. Butler then signed OA goaltender Cody St.Jacques and traded veteran defenceman Kyle Pereira and a draft pick to Guelph for rookie import goaltender Matej Machovsky. With much more steady goaltending the Battalion managed a near .500 record for the rest of the season finishing with 29 wins and 65 points to finish 6th in the Eastern Conference. However the Troops would fall four straight in the first round of the playoffs to the Niagara Ice Dogs. Battalion captain Stephon Thorne would score two of just three goals scored by the Battalion in the four-game series. OA Forward Scott Tanski led the team with 47 points in the regular season.

Fourth year forward Sam Carrick would be named captain of the Battalion for the 2011–12 season which was a much improved season for the Troops. Led by a 37-goal season from Carrick as well as 5 shutouts from Matej Machovsky the Battalion posted 36 wins for 82 points, the fourth highest points total in team history. The Troops began the playoffs against Sudbury. Powered by hat tricks from Matt MacLeod and Philip Lane the Troops took the first two games on home ice before a dominating 6–1 win in game three. The Troops would complete the sweep with defenceman Cameron Wind&#x27;s goal in double overtime of game 4. Brampton would face the number one seeded Niagara Ice Dogs in the second round. The Troops would lose game one in overtime on the road and from there they could not recover as they would lose four straight.

The Troops began the 2012–13 season naming Barclay Goodrow the 13th captain in team history. The Troops played at a slightly above .500 level for most of the season.
Early in the season it was announced that the team would be relocating to North Bay, Ontario for the 2013–14 season. On January 11, 2013, defenceman Cameron Wind passed Luke Lynes for most games played in a Battalion uniform as Wind eventually finished the season with 291 career games played. On March 12, 2013, in the final week of the regular season goaltender Matej Machovsky set the franchise record for most shutouts in a career with his 9th in a 3–0 win over the host Ottawa 67&#x27;s. Captain Barclay Goodrow led the team in scoring with 38 goals and 52 points while rookie Blake Clarke scored 19 goals and 51 points. The Battalion finished the season with a record of 34–25–3–6 finishing second in the Central Division and fourth in the Eastern Conference setting up a rematch of the first round from 2012 with the Sudbury Wolves.

Brampton would win game one on home ice by a 4–1 score. Sudbury took game two jumping out to an early 3–0 lead before holding on 5–4. An outburst directed towards game referee&#x27;s by Battalion coach Stan Butler had him tossed from the game and he was handed a five-game suspension it would be his final time behind the Brampton bench as the Troops could not recover losing four straight. The Troops were eliminated in a 1–0 overtime loss on home ice in game 5 on March 29, 2013. Matt MacLeod scored what turned out to be the final goal in team history during the game four 5–4 OT loss the night before.

===Relocation to North Bay===
During the summer of 2012 rumours of the Battalion franchise relocating began to swirl as their lease agreement with the Powerade Centre was nearing an end. An attendance that was never healthy on a regular basis to begin with was declining in Brampton. Combined with an unfavorable lease in Brampton, owner Scott Abbott had no choice but to look for other options as the 2012–13 season got under way. On Monday, November 5, 2012, following a meeting with city counsel in North Bay, Ontario an agreement in principle to move the Battalion to North Bay for the 2013–14 season was agreed upon. Just nine days later fans in North Bay had already bought 2,000 season tickets as per the conditions of the agreement. The Battalion would play out of the North Bay Memorial Gardens which underwent renovations, in order to meet OHL regulations. Franchise owner Scott Abbott indicated that the team would keep the Battalion moniker in North Bay, paying homage to the strong military history the city has.

<doc id="163219" wikidata="Q109849" url="?curid=163219" title="Madison Avenue">
<text>Madison Avenue is a north-south avenue in the borough of Manhattan in New York City, United States, that carries northbound one-way traffic. It runs from Madison Square (at 23rd Street) to meet the southbound Harlem River Drive at 142nd Street, passing through Midtown, the Upper East Side (including Carnegie Hill), East Harlem, and Harlem. It is named after and arises from Madison Square, which is itself named after James Madison, the fourth President of the United States.

Madison Avenue was not part of the original Manhattan street grid established in the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811, and was carved between Park Avenue (formerly Fourth) and Fifth Avenue in 1836, due to the effort of lawyer and real estate developer Samuel B. Ruggles, who had previously purchased and developed New York&#x27;s Gramercy Park in 1831, and convinced the authorities to create Lexington Avenue and Irving Place between Fourth Avenue (now Park Avenue South) and Third Avenue in order to service it.

The street&#x27;s name has been metonymous with the American advertising industry since the 1920s. Thus, the term &quot;Madison Avenue&quot; refers specifically to the agencies and methodology of advertising. &quot;Madison Avenue techniques&quot; refers, according to William Safire, to the &quot;gimmicky, slick use of the communications media to play on emotions.&quot;

==Route==
Madison Avenue carries one-way traffic uptown (northbound) from East 23rd Street to East 135th Street, with the changeover from two-way traffic taking place on January 14, 1966, at which time Fifth Avenue was changed to one-way downtown (southbound). This changeover was accelerated by seven weeks due to the transit strike which began on January 1. Between East 135th Street and East 142nd Street, Madison Avenue carries southbound traffic only and runs parallel to the Harlem River Drive.

=== Landmarks ===
There are numerous structures designated as New York City Landmarks (NYCL), National Historic Landmarks (NHL), and National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on Madison Avenue. From south to north (in increasing address order), they include:

== Role in advertising industry==
The term &quot;Madison Avenue&quot; is often used metonymically to stand for the American advertising industry. Madison Avenue became identified with advertising after that sector&#x27;s explosive growth in this area in the 1920s.

According to &quot;The Emergence of Advertising in America&quot;, by the year 1861, there were 20 advertising agencies in New York City, and the New York City Association of Advertising Agencies was founded in 1911, predating the establishment of the American Association of Advertising Agencies by several years.

Among various depictions in popular culture, the portion of the advertising industry which centers on Madison Avenue serves as a backdrop for the AMC television drama &quot;Mad Men&quot;, which focuses on industry activities during the 1960s.

In recent decades, many agencies have left Madison Avenue, with some moving further downtown and others moving west. The continued presence of large agencies in the city made New York the third-largest job market per capita in the U.S. in 2016, according to a study by marketing recruitment firm MarketPro. Today, several agencies are still located in the old business cluster on Madison Avenue, including StrawberryFrog, TBWA Worldwide, Organic, Inc., and DDB Worldwide. However, the term is still used to describe the agency business as a whole and large, New York–based agencies in particular.

==Madison Square Park and Madison Square Garden==
Madison Square Park is a public park which runs along Madison Avenue from East 26th Street to East 23rd Street. It is bordered on the west by Fifth Avenue and Broadway as they cross. The park was named for James Madison, fourth President of the United States.

Madison Square Garden took its name from the location of the first building of that name, located on the northeast corner of Madison Avenue at 26th Street, across from the Park. The first Garden was a former railroad terminal for the Park Avenue main line, which was converted into an open-air circus venue by P. T. Barnum in 1871 and was renamed &quot;Madison Square Garden&quot; in 1879. (The New York Life Insurance Building now occupies that entire city block.) The original Garden was demolished in 1889 and replaced by a new indoor arena designed by Stanford White that opened the following year. The second Garden had a bronze statue of the Roman goddess Diana on the tower of the sports arena. When it moved to a new building at 50th Street and Eighth Avenue in 1925 it kept its old name. Madison Square Garden is now located at Eighth Avenue between 31st and 33rd Street; however, it still retains the name.

===Transit===
Madison Avenue is served by the following routes uptown. All crosstown service is eastbound unless specified below. Downtown service runs along 5th Avenue:
* The local New York City Transit buses are the primary servers, running from East 25th to East 110th Streets, with M1 service extended to East 135th Street. 
* The join in north of East 32nd Street, running to East 110th and East 59th Streets, respectively.

* From East 96th Street, the runs to East 106th Street, and the westbound runs to East 97th Street.
* The runs in both directions north of East 135th Street and crosses the Madison Avenue Bridge. 
* Express routes along Madison include the New York City Transit buses and the BxM4C express Bee Line bus. These buses use a double exclusive bus lane between 42nd and 59th Streets, which comprise the only exclusive bus lane along the avenue.

Although no New York City Subway stations are named after Madison Avenue, the Fifth Avenue/53rd Street station on the has an entrance on Madison Avenue.

Pursuant to Section 4-12(m) of the New York City Traffic Rules, driving a vehicle other than a bus in the bus lane on Madison Avenue to turn right during the restricted hours specified by sign between 42nd Street and 59th Street is prohibited, then permitted at 60th Street, but a taxicab carrying a passenger may use the bus lane to turn right at 46th Street. Bikes are excluded from this prohibition.

===Overturned midtown bike ban===
In July 1987, then-New York City Mayor Edward Koch proposed banning bicycling on Fifth, Park and Madison Avenues during weekdays, but many bicyclists protested and had the ban overturned. When the trial was started on Monday, August 24, 1987, for 90 days to ban bicyclists from these three avenues from 31st Street to 59th Street between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. on weekdays, mopeds would not be banned.

<text>John Hench (June 29, 1908 – February 5, 2004) was an American artist, designer and director at The Walt Disney Company. For 65 years, he helped design and develop various Disney attractions and theme parks.

== Early life ==
Hench was born on June 29, 1908, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and raised in Southern California. He attended the Los Angeles Art Students&#x27; League. Hench attended further art and creative schools in the United States, including the Otis College of Art and Design in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Art Institute in San Francisco, and the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles.

== Career ==
In 1939, Hench started as a story artist in the animation department working in areas including backgrounds, layout and art direction, effects animation and special effects. Hench was respected by Walt Disney as one of the studio&#x27;s most gifted artists and worked him and Salvador Dalí on the animated short &quot;Destino&quot;, a project which began in 1945 and not completed until 2003.

Afterwards, he moved to WED Enterprises (now known as Walt Disney Imagineering). In 1954, Hench was in the studio&#x27;s live action department, as lead developer of the hydraulic giant squid in &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.&quot; The film won an Academy Award for Best Special Effects in 1954. Hench was also Disney&#x27;s official portrait artist of Mickey Mouse, painting the company&#x27;s portraits for Mickey&#x27;s 25th, 50th, 60th, 70th, and 75th birthdays.

Hench led the design for various attractions: Tomorrowland, the Adventureland buildings and walkways, New Orleans Square and the Snow White Grotto. He also designed Space Mountain, and Cinderella Castle at the Magic Kingdom and Tokyo Disneyland. He also contributed to attractions such as the Mickey Mouse Revue, Carousel of Progress and It&#x27;s a Small World. Hench was often mistaken as Walt Disney, therefore, theme parks guests would often ask him for an autograph or photo.

One of Hench&#x27;s most recognizable work is his design for the Olympic Torch for the 1960 Winter Olympics at Squaw Valley, California, which subsequent torches have been based on. The design is modeled after the torches of the 1948 and 1956 Olympiads. In 1990, he received the Disney Legend award, the company&#x27;s highest honor, presented by then-CEO Michael Eisner. Hench remained at Walt Disney Imagineering in Glendale, California, until 2004.

== Personal life ==
Hench and his wife were longtime devotees of the Hindu saint Ramakrishna, were initiated by Swami Prabhavananda, and were members of the Vedanta Society of Southern California, Hench serving as the society&#x27;s board president for a short time.

== Death and legacy==
Hench died of heart failure on February 5, 2004, after a brief hospitalization in Burbank, California.

The John Hench School of Animation at the University of Southern California&#x27;s School of Cinematic Arts in Los Angeles, California is named in his honor. He was a major contributor to the animation school. The school motto, &quot;Art Makes Us Human&quot;, is a quote from Hench when he visited the school to inspire students.

<doc id="163222" wikidata="Q727953" url="?curid=163222" title="Michael Eisner">
<text>Michael Dammann Eisner (born March 7, 1942) is an American businessman and former chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Walt Disney Company from September 1984 to September 2005. Prior to Disney, Eisner was president of rival film studio Paramount Pictures from 1976 to 1984, and had brief stints at the major television networks NBC, CBS, and ABC.

Eisner&#x27;s 21-year stint at Disney saw the revitalization of the company&#x27;s poorly performing animation studios with successful films such as &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989), &quot;Beauty and the Beast &quot; (1991), &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992), and &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), a period known as the Disney Renaissance. Eisner additionally broadened the company&#x27;s media portfolio by leading the acquisitions of ABC, most of ESPN and The Muppets franchise. Eisner also led major investments and expansion of the company&#x27;s theme parks both domestically and globally, including the openings of Disney-MGM Studios (now Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios) in 1989, Euro Disney (now Disneyland Paris) in 1992, Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom in 1998, Disney&#x27;s California Adventure Park and Tokyo DisneySea in 2001, Walt Disney Studios Park in 2002 and Hong Kong Disneyland in 2005.

Eisner&#x27;s final years at Disney were tumultuous: a string of box-office bombs in the early 2000s, public feuds with former associates such as Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steve Jobs, and dissatisfaction with Eisner&#x27;s management style culminated in the &quot;Save Disney&quot; campaign organized by Roy E. Disney, during which Eisner rapidly lost the confidence of much of Disney&#x27;s Board of Directors. As a result of the pressure from the campaign, Eisner announced in March 2005 that he would step down as CEO prematurely, handing day-to-day duties to Bob Iger before formally leaving the company in September 2005. He went on to create the stop-motion animated sitcom &quot;Glenn Martin, DDS&quot; in 2009.

==Early life and education==
Eisner was born to an affluent, secular Jewish family in Mount Kisco, New York. His mother, Margaret (née Dammann), whose family founded the American Safety Razor Company, was the president of the Irvington Institute, a hospital that treated children with rheumatic fever. His father, Lester Eisner, Jr., was a lawyer and regional administrator of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. His great-grandfather, Sigmund Eisner, established a successful clothing company that was one of the first uniform suppliers to the Boy Scouts of America and his great-grandmother, Bertha Weiss, belonged to an immigrant family that established the town of Red Bank, New Jersey. Eisner has one sister, Margot Freedman.

He was raised on Park Avenue in Manhattan. He attended the Allen-Stevenson School kindergarten through ninth grade followed by The Lawrenceville School in 10th through his senior year and graduated from Denison University in 1964 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English. He is a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity and credits much of his success to his time at Keewaydin Canoe Camp for boys in Vermont.

==ABC and Paramount==
After two brief stints at NBC and CBS, Barry Diller at ABC hired Eisner as assistant to the national programming director. Eisner moved up the ranks, eventually becoming a senior vice president in charge of programming and development. In 1976, Diller, who had by then moved on to become chairman of Paramount Pictures, recruited Eisner from ABC and made him president and COO of the movie studio. During his tenure at Paramount, the studio produced films such as &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, &quot;Grease&quot;, the &quot;Star Trek&quot; film franchise, &quot;Ordinary People&quot;, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;, &quot;Flashdance&quot;, &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;, &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;, and &quot;Footloose&quot;, and TV shows such as &quot;Happy Days&quot;, &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;, &quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;Family Ties&quot;.

Diller left Paramount on September 30, 1984, and, as his protégé, Eisner expected to assume Diller&#x27;s position as studio chief. When he was passed over for the job, though, he left to look for work elsewhere and lobbied for the position of CEO of the Walt Disney Company.

==The Walt Disney Company==
Following the deaths of founders Walt Disney in 1966, and Roy O. Disney in 1971, the Walt Disney Company narrowly survived several takeover attempts. Its shareholders Sid Bass and Roy E. Disney brought in Eisner (as CEO and chairman of the board) and former Warner Bros. chief Frank Wells (as president) to replace Ron W. Miller in 1984 and strengthen the company. Eisner brought in Jeffrey Katzenberg as Walt Disney Studios chairman.

A couple of years after becoming chairman and CEO, Eisner became the host of &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;, making him the public face of the company as well as its top executive. Eisner was not a performer by profession, and studio management did not believe he could do the hosting job. After filming a test video with his wife Jane and a member of his executive team (which required multiple takes) Eisner &quot;came across as stiff and awkward ... Disney executives ... were pretty much unanimous that the test was a failure...Eisner stubbornly persisted in the face of almost unanimous criticism.&quot; Eisner hired Michael Kay, a director of political commercials for then-U.S. Senator Bill Bradley, to help him improve his on-camera performance. As a result, Eisner was well-recognized by children at the company&#x27;s theme parks who often asked him for autographs.

During the second half of the 1980s and early 1990s, Eisner revitalized Disney. Beginning with the films &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988) which was brought to Disney by Jeffrey Katzenberg and &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989) a Ron Clements idea that Eisner originally panned, its flagship animation studio enjoyed a series of commercial and critical successes. Disney also broadened its adult offerings in film when it acquired Miramax Films in 1993. Under Eisner, Disney acquired many other media sources, including ABC, most of ESPN, Fox Family Channel (now known as Freeform) and The Muppets franchise. The ABC purchase in particular reunited Eisner with his former employer.

In the early part of the 1990s, Eisner and his partners set out to plan &quot;The Disney Decade&quot; which was to feature new parks around the world, existing park expansions, new films, and new media investments. While some of the proposals were completed, most were not. Those completed included the &quot;Euro Disney Resort&quot; (now Disneyland Paris) which was vastly over budget, and had low attendance and was acknowledged by Eisner to be his &quot;real financial disappointment&quot;, &quot;Disney-MGM Studios&quot; (now Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios), &quot;Disney&#x27;s California Adventure Park&quot; (now Disney California Adventure), &quot;Disney-MGM Studios Paris&quot; (eventually opened in 2002 as Walt Disney Studios Park), and various film projects including a &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; franchise. However, the lackluster success of Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom in the years after its opening, general stagnation in Disney&#x27;s revenues and various corporate issues and disputes would dampen Eisner&#x27;s later career.

In 1993, Katzenberg had lobbied to become Eisner&#x27;s second in command, which would have meant moving Frank Wells from president to vice chairman, to which Eisner &#x27;replied that Wells would feel &quot;hurt&quot; in that scenario&#x27;. Coincidentally, Wells died in a helicopter crash in 1994. When Eisner did not appoint Katzenberg to Wells&#x27; now available post, tensions arose between the two that led to Katzenberg&#x27;s resignation. At the time, Eisner refused to pay Katzenberg his contractual bonus despite Katzenberg&#x27;s offer to accept $60 million as a settlement, much less than was actually owed. Katzenberg was forced to take the issue to court, who ruled in his favor. The final settlement was $280 million. Katzenberg went on to found DreamWorks SKG, with partners Steven Spielberg and David Geffen. Eisner recalled that &quot;Roy E. Disney, who did not like him at all — I forget the reason, but Jeffrey probably did not treat him the way that Roy would have wanted to be treated — said to me, &#x27;If you make him the president, I will start a proxy fight.&#x27;&quot;

Eisner then recruited his friend Michael Ovitz, one of the founders of Creative Artists Agency, to be President with minimal involvement from Disney&#x27;s board of directors (which at the time included Oscar-winning actor Sidney Poitier, the CEO of Hilton Hotels Corporation Stephen Bollenbach, former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, Yale dean Robert A. M. Stern, and Eisner&#x27;s predecessors Raymond Watson and Card Walker). Ovitz lasted only 14 months, partly due to outright hostility from Sandy Litvak and Steve Bollenbach and a lack of support by Eisner, and left Disney in December 1996, via a &quot;no fault termination&quot; with a severance package of $38 million in cash, and 3 million stock options worth roughly $100 million, at the time of Ovitz&#x27;s departure. The Ovitz episode engendered a long-running derivative suit, which finally concluded in June 2006, almost 10 years later. Chancellor William B. Chandler III of the Delaware Court of Chancery, despite describing Eisner&#x27;s behavior as falling &quot;far short of what shareholders expect and demand from those entrusted with a fiduciary position...&quot;, found in favor of Eisner and the rest of the Disney board because they had not violated the duty of care owed by a corporation&#x27;s officers and board to its shareholders.

===&quot;Save Disney&quot; campaign and retirement===
Despite his record of success while serving as President, CEO and Chairman of the Walt Disney Company, Eisner was also known for his habit of integrating much of his Paramount films with Disney. These moves were seen as unfavorable, and led to Eisner’s isolation from other Disney executives by 1995. On November 30, 2003, Roy E. Disney, the son and nephew of co-founders Roy O. Disney and Walt Disney, respectively, resigned from his positions as Disney vice chairman and chairman of Walt Disney Feature Animation. His reasons for resigning was his feeling that there was too much micromanagement within the studio, flops with the ABC television network, the company&#x27;s growing timidity in the theme park business, the Walt Disney Company turning into a &quot;rapacious, soul-less&quot; company, Eisner&#x27;s refusal to establish a clear succession plan, as well as the studio releasing a string of box-office movie failures starting in the year 2000, such as &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; and &quot;Treasure Planet&quot;, and the company&#x27;s well-publicized distribution disputes with long-time production partner Pixar Animation Studios and its CEO Steve Jobs, with whom Disney had produced such animated feature film hits as &quot;Toy Story&quot;, &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, and &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, which were critically acclaimed and financially successful for both partners.

On March 3, 2004, at Disney&#x27;s annual shareholders&#x27; meeting, a surprising and unprecedented 43% of Disney&#x27;s shareholders, predominantly rallied by former board members Roy Disney and Stanley Gold, withheld their proxies to re-elect Eisner to the board. This vote followed a stunning rebuke of Eisner and his executive and chairman practices by both the Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass, Lewis, a shareholder advisory service. Disney&#x27;s board then gave the chairmanship position to board member George Mitchell. However, the board did not immediately remove Eisner as chief executive.

On March 13, 2005, Eisner announced that he would step down as CEO one year before his contract expired, and handed off day-to-day duties to Bob Iger, who had been serving as Disney&#x27;s President and Chief Operating Officer and had just been selected by the directors as the CEO-designate. Eisner did not initially promote Iger as a successor until after the board put pressure on Eisner to resign. To reporters and contrary to his actual intentions, Eisner remarked that &quot;I would not have agreed to [leave] if it hadn&#x27;t been Bob. Because of governance, they wanted a big search and everything. ... And by the end of the search, it was clear that I was able to convince the board—our newly constructed board—that Bob was great.&quot; Within Disney, though, Eisner was telling Board members that Iger lacked &quot;stature&quot;. On September 30, Eisner resigned both as an executive and as a member of the board of directors, and, severing all formal ties with the company, he waived his contractual rights to perks such as the use of a corporate jet and an office at the company&#x27;s Burbank headquarters.

While Eisner did much to stabilize and promote Disney in his early years as CEO, his performance in later years garnered much criticism. &quot;Beginning with the lavish, even reckless spending on Euro Disney, and continuing with the poorly planned and executed foray into the Internet, and perhaps worst of all, the acquisition of the Fox Family cable network - each of which is a more than $1 billion mistake - Eisner squandered Disney&#x27;s assets. ... This is even before considering the exit of Jeffery Katzenberg, the failure to honour his contract, and the hiring and firing of Michael Ovitz, personnel and judgment errors, which, in the cost to Disney and the vitriol and publicity they generated, are without parallel in American business history. ... Eisner controlled and manipulated the board by keeping members isolated, preferring to communicate one-on-one; selectively doling out information, access and benefits ... and ruthlessly dispatching anyone who dared challenge him.&quot;

In his book &quot;The Ride of a Lifetime&quot;, Bob Iger quotes Eisner answering criticism for micro-managing as saying: &quot;Micromanaging is underrated&quot;.

In January 2006, Disney&#x27;s corporate headquarters in Burbank was renamed to Team Disney – The Michael D. Eisner Building in Eisner&#x27;s honor.

==Post-Disney==
On October 7, 2005, Eisner was a guest host for the &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; talk show. His guests were John Travolta and his ex-boss, Barry Diller. Impressed with Eisner&#x27;s performance, CNBC President Mark Hoffman hired Eisner in early 2006 to host his own talk show, &quot;Conversations with Michael Eisner&quot;. The show mostly featured CEOs, political leaders, artists and actors, until its cancellation in 2009. Eisner was also an executive producer of the show.

In March 2007, Eisner&#x27;s investment firm, The Tornante Company, launched a studio, Vuguru, that produces and distributes videos for the Internet, portable media devices and cell phones. In October 2007, Eisner, through his Tornante Company investment firm, partnered with Madison Dearborn Partners in the acquisition of Topps Company, the bubble-gum and collectibles firm. He produced a mockumentary style show about his takeover of the Topps Company, called &quot;Back on Topps.&quot; In January 2022, he sold Topps to Fanatics following its loss of the Major League Baseball licensing rights. His investment firm has funded the critically acclaimed Netflix series &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot;.

The College of Education at California State University, Northridge is named in his honor.

In 2009, Eisner used his own money to produce a claymation show called &quot;Glenn Martin, DDS&quot;.

He was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 2012.

===Portsmouth Football Club (2017–present)===
In March 2017, came the revelation that Eisner was interested in a takeover of Portsmouth F.C., a football club in the south of England that had fallen on hard times after years of poor ownership, before being taken over by its fans. The club released a statement on March 23, 2017, that Eisner and his Tornante Company were in an exclusivity agreement. On August 3, 2017, came confirmation that Eisner and his Tornante Company had completed their purchase for a reported fee of £5.67 million.

==Personal life==
After college in 1964, he met his future wife, Jane Breckenridge, a Unitarian of Swedish and Scottish descent. They have three sons: Breck, Eric and Anders Eisner.

<text>Mathis James Reed (September 6, 1925 – August 29, 1976) was an American blues musician and songwriter. His particular style of electric blues was popular with a wide variety of audiences. Reed&#x27;s songs such as &quot;Honest I Do&quot; (1957), &quot;Baby What You Want Me to Do&quot; (1960), &quot;Big Boss Man&quot; (1961), and &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot; (1961) appeared on both &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s R&amp;B and Hot 100 singles charts.

Reed influenced many other musicians, including Elvis Presley, Hank Williams Jr., Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and the Rolling Stones, who recorded his songs. Music critic Cub Koda describes him as &quot;perhaps the most influential bluesman of all,&quot; due to his easily accessible style.

==Biography==
Reed was born in Dunleith, Mississippi. He learned the harmonica and guitar from his friend Eddie Taylor. After several years of busking and performing there, he moved to Chicago, Illinois, in 1943. He was then drafted into the U.S. Navy and served in World War II. He was discharged in 1945 and returned briefly to Mississippi, marrying his girlfriend, Mary (henceforth known as Mama Reed). Mama Reed would be an uncredited background singer on many of his recordings, notably the hits &quot;Baby What You Want Me to Do&quot;, &quot;Big Boss Man&quot; and &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot;. He then moved to Gary, Indiana, to work at an Armour meat-packing plant.

By the 1950s, Reed had established himself as a popular musician. He joined the Gary Kings with John Brim and played on the street with Willie Joe Duncan. Reed failed to gain a recording contract with Chess Records, but signed with Vee-Jay Records through Brim&#x27;s drummer, Albert King. At Vee-Jay, Reed began playing again with Eddie Taylor and soon released &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Go&quot;, his first hit record. It was followed by a long string of hit songs.

Reed maintained his reputation despite his rampant alcoholism; his wife sometimes had to help him remember the lyrics to his songs while recording. In 1957, Reed developed epilepsy, though the condition was not correctly diagnosed for a long time, as Reed and doctors assumed it was delirium tremens. When Vee-Jay Records closed, his manager signed a contract with the fledgling ABC-Bluesway label, but Reed never produced another hit. In 1968, he toured Europe with the American Folk Blues Festival.

Reed died of respiratory failure in 1976, in Oakland, California, eight days short of his 51st birthday. He is interred in the Lincoln Cemetery, in Blue Island, Illinois. Reed was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991.

==Influence==
The Rolling Stones have cited Reed as a major influence on their sound, and their early set lists included Reed&#x27;s songs &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Lovin&#x27; You Baby&quot;, &quot;The Sun Is Shining&quot; (played by the Stones at the 1969 Altamont concert), &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot;, and &quot;Shame, Shame, Shame&quot;. &quot;Little by Little&quot;, the B-side of their February 1964 UK hit single &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; was a pastiche of &quot;Shame, Shame, Shame&quot;. &quot;Honest I Do&quot; was included on their first album, &quot;The Rolling Stones&quot; (subtitled &quot;England&#x27;s Newest Hit Makers&quot; in America), in 1964 (the U.S. edition also included &quot;Little by Little&quot;). For their 2016 release, &quot;Blue &amp; Lonesome&quot;, they recorded a version of Reed&#x27;s &quot;Little Rain&quot;.

The Yardbirds recorded &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Got You&quot; for the B-side of their second single &quot;Good Morning Little Schoolgirl&quot; with guitarist Eric Clapton. With Jeff Beck, they recorded the Reed-inspired instrumental &quot;Like Jimmy Reed Again&quot;, which was released on a reissue of their album &quot;Having a Rave Up&quot;. The Animals considered Reed one of their main sources of inspiration and recorded versions of &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Got You&quot; and &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot;. Van Morrison&#x27;s group Them covered &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot; and &quot;Baby, What You Want Me to Do&quot;, both of which are on the album &quot;The Story of Them Featuring Van Morrison&quot;. &quot;Big Boss Man&quot;, sung by Ron &quot;Pigpen&quot; McKernan, was regularly performed by the Grateful Dead in the 1960s and early 1970s and appears on their live album &quot;Grateful Dead&quot;

Elvis Presley recorded several of Reed&#x27;s songs, having a hit with &quot;Big Boss Man&quot; in 1967 and recording several performances of &quot;Baby, What You Want Me to Do&quot; for his 1968 TV program. (Presley&#x27;s 1964 hit &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Lovin&#x27; You Baby&quot; is a different song from that recorded by Reed.) &quot;Baby, What You Want Me to Do&quot; was also covered by Wishbone Ash on their 1973 album &quot;Live Dates&quot;. Johnny and Edgar Winter performed it live in 1975 and included it on their album &quot;Together&quot;. Omar Kent Dykes and Jimmie Vaughan released the album &quot;On the Jimmy Reed Highway&quot; as a tribute to Reed. Bill Cosby covered four of Reed&#x27;s songs, &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot;, &quot;Big Boss Man&quot;, &quot;Hush Hush&quot; and &quot;Aw Shucks, Hush Your Mouth&quot;, for his 1967 album, &quot;Silver Throat: Bill Cosby Sings&quot;.

The Steve Miller Band covered five of Reed&#x27;s songs: &quot;You&#x27;re So Fine&quot; (originally recorded by Reed as &quot;Honey, Where You Going?&quot;), on the 1968 album &quot;Sailor&quot;, and &quot;I Wanna Be Loved (But by Only You)&quot;, &quot;Big Boss Man&quot;, &quot;Caress Me Baby&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Lovin&#x27; You Baby&quot;, on the 1986 album &quot;Living in the 20th Century&quot;.

Bob Dylan paid tribute to Reed with the song &quot;Goodbye Jimmy Reed&quot; on his 2020 album &quot;Rough and Rowdy Ways&quot;.

<text>Geopolitics () is the study of the effects of Earth&#x27;s geography on politics and international relations. Geopolitics usually refers to countries and relations between them, it may also focus on two other kinds of states: &quot;de facto&quot; independent states with limited international recognition and relations between sub-national geopolitical entities, such as the federated states that make up a federation, confederation, or a quasi-federal system.

At the level of international relations, geopolitics is a method of studying foreign policy to understand, explain, and predict international political behavior through geographical variables. These include area studies, climate, topography, demography, natural resources, and applied science of the region being evaluated.

Geopolitics focuses on political power linked to geographic space, in particular, territorial waters and land territory in correlation with diplomatic history. Topics of geopolitics include relations between the interests of international political actors focused within an area, a space, or a geographical element, relations which create a geopolitical system. Critical geopolitics deconstructs classical geopolitical theories, by showing their political or ideological functions for great powers. There are some works that discuss the geopolitics of renewable energy.

According to Christopher Gogwilt and other researchers, the term is currently being used to describe a broad spectrum of concepts, in a general sense used as &quot;a synonym for international political relations&quot;, but more specifically &quot;to imply the global structure of such relations&quot;; this usage builds on an &quot;early-twentieth-century term for a pseudoscience of political geography&quot; and other pseudoscientific theories of historical and geographic determinism.

==United States==

=== Alfred Thayer Mahan and sea power ===

Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840–1914) was a frequent commentator on world naval strategic and diplomatic affairs. Mahan believed that national greatness was inextricably associated with the sea—and particularly with its commercial use in peace and its control in war. Mahan&#x27;s theoretical framework came from Antoine-Henri Jomini, and emphasized that strategic locations (such as choke points, canals, and coaling stations), as well as quantifiable levels of fighting power in a fleet, were conducive to control over the sea. He proposed six conditions required for a nation to have sea power:

#Advantageous geographical position;
#Serviceable coastlines, abundant natural resources, and favorable climate;
#Extent of territory
#Population large enough to defend its territory;
#Society with an aptitude for the sea and commercial enterprise; and
#Government with the influence and inclination to dominate the sea.

Mahan distinguished a key region of the world in the Eurasian context, namely, the Central Zone of Asia lying between 30° and 40° north and stretching from Asia Minor to Japan. In this zone independent countries still survived – Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan, China, and Japan. Mahan regarded those countries, located between Britain and Russia, as if between &quot;Scylla and Charybdis&quot;. Of the two monsters – Britain and Russia – it was the latter that Mahan considered more threatening to the fate of Central Asia. Mahan was impressed by Russia&#x27;s transcontinental size and strategically favorable position for southward expansion. Therefore, he found it necessary for the Anglo-Saxon &quot;sea power&quot; to resist Russia.

===Homer Lea===
Homer Lea, in &quot;The Day of the Saxon&quot; (1912), asserted that the entire Anglo-Saxon race faced a threat from German (Teuton), Russian (Slav), and Japanese expansionism: The &quot;fatal&quot; relationship of Russia, Japan, and Germany &quot;has now assumed through the urgency of natural forces a coalition directed against the survival of Saxon supremacy.&quot; It is &quot;a dreadful Dreibund&quot;. Lea believed that while Japan moved against Far East and Russia against India, the Germans would strike at England, the center of the British Empire. He thought the Anglo-Saxons faced certain disaster from their militant opponents.

=== Kissinger, Brzezinski, and the Grand Chessboard ===

Two national security advisors from the Cold War period, Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski, argued to continue the United States&#x27; geopolitical focus on Eurasia and, particularly Russia, despite the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. Both continued their influence on geopolitics after the end of the Cold War, writing books on the subject in the 1990s—&quot;Diplomacy&quot; and &quot;The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives&quot;. The Anglo-American classical geopolitical theories were revived.

Kissinger argued against the belief that with the dissolution of the USSR, hostile intentions had come to an end and traditional foreign policy considerations no longer applied. &quot;They would argue … that Russia, regardless of who governs it, sits astride the territory which Halford Mackinder called the geopolitical heartland, and it is the heir to one of the most potent imperial traditions.&quot; Therefore, the United States must &quot;maintain the global balance of power vis-à-vis the country with a long history of expansionism.&quot;

After Russia, the second geopolitical threat which remained was Germany and, as Mackinder had feared ninety years ago, its partnership with Russia. During the Cold War, Kissinger argues, both sides of the Atlantic recognized that, &quot;unless America is organically involved in Europe, it would later be obliged to involve itself under circumstances which would be far less favorable to both sides of the Atlantic. That is even more true today. Germany has become so strong that existing European institutions cannot strike a balance between Germany and its European partners all by themselves. Nor can Europe, even with the assistance of Germany, manage […] Russia&quot; all by itself. Thus Kissinger believed that no country&#x27;s interests would ever be served if Germany and Russia were to ever form a partnership in which each country would consider itself the principal partner. They would raise fears of condominium. Without America, Britain and France cannot cope with Germany and Russia; and &quot;without Europe, America could turn … into an island off the shores of Eurasia.&quot;

Nicholas J. Spykman&#x27;s vision of Eurasia was strongly confirmed: &quot;Geopolitically, America is an island off the shores of the large landmass of Eurasia, whose resources and population far exceed those of the United States. The domination by a single power of either of Eurasia&#x27;s two principal spheres—Europe and Asia—remains a good definition of strategic danger for America. Cold War or no Cold War. For such a grouping would have the capacity to outstrip America economically and, in the end, militarily. That danger would have to be resisted even if the dominant power was apparently benevolent, for if its intentions ever changed, America would find itself with a grossly diminished capacity for effective resistance and a growing inability to shape events.&quot; The main interest of the American leaders is maintaining the balance of power in Eurasia.

Having converted from an ideologist into a geopolitician, Kissinger retrospectively interpreted the Cold War in geopolitical terms—an approach which was not characteristic of his works during the Cold War. Now, however, he focused on the beginning of the Cold War: &quot;The objective of moral opposition to Communism had merged with the geopolitical task of containing Soviet expansion.&quot; Nixon, he added, was a geopolitical rather than an ideological cold warrior.

Three years after Kissinger&#x27;s &quot;Diplomacy&quot;, Zbigniew Brzezinski followed suit, launching &quot;The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives&quot; and, after three more years, The Geostrategic Triad: Living with China, Europe, and Russia. The Grand Chessboard described the American triumph in the Cold War in terms of control over Eurasia: for the first time ever, a &quot;non-Eurasian&quot; power had emerged as a key arbiter of &quot;Eurasian&quot; power relations. The book states its purpose: &quot;The formulation of a comprehensive and integrated Eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book.&quot; Although the power configuration underwent a revolutionary change, Brzezinski confirmed three years later, Eurasia was still a mega-continent. Like Spykman, Brzezinski acknowledges that: &quot;Cumulatively, Eurasia&#x27;s power vastly overshadows America&#x27;s.&quot;

In classical Spykman terms, Brzezinski formulated his geostrategic &quot;chessboard&quot; doctrine of Eurasia, which aims to prevent the unification of this mega-continent.&quot;Europe and Asia are politically and economically powerful…. It follows that… American foreign policy must…employ its influence in Eurasia in a manner that creates a stable continental equilibrium, with the United States as the political arbiter.… Eurasia is thus the chessboard on which the struggle for global primacy continues to be played, and that struggle involves geo- strategy – the strategic management of geopolitical interests…. But in the meantime it is imperative that no Eurasian challenger emerges, capable of dominating Eurasia and thus also of challenging America… For America the chief geopolitical prize is Eurasia…and America&#x27;s global primacy is directly dependent on how long and how effectively its preponderance on the Eurasian continent is sustained.&quot;

=== Emil Reich ===
The Austro-Hungarian historian Emil Reich (1854–1910) is considered to be the first having coined the term in English as early as 1902 and later published in England in 1904 in his book &quot;Foundations of Modern Europe&quot;.

=== Mackinder and the Heartland Theory ===
Sir Halford Mackinder&#x27;s Heartland Theory initially received little attention outside the world of geography, but some thinkers have claimed that it subsequently influenced the foreign policies of world powers. Those scholars who look to MacKinder through critical lenses accept him as an organic strategist who tried to build a foreign policy vision for Britain with his Eurocentric analysis of historical geography. His formulation of the Heartland Theory was set out in his article entitled &quot;The Geographical Pivot of History&quot;, published in England in 1904. Mackinder&#x27;s doctrine of geopolitics involved concepts diametrically opposed to the notion of Alfred Thayer Mahan about the significance of navies (he coined the term &quot;sea power&quot;) in world conflict. He saw navy as a basis of Colombian era empire (roughly from 1492 to the 19th century), and predicted the 20th century to be domain of land power. The Heartland theory hypothesized a huge empire being brought into existence in the Heartland—which would not need to use coastal or transoceanic transport to remain coherent. The basic notions of Mackinder&#x27;s doctrine involve considering the geography of the Earth as being divided into two sections: the World Island or Core, comprising Eurasia and Africa; and the Peripheral &quot;islands&quot;, including the Americas, Australia, Japan, the British Isles, and Oceania. Not only was the Periphery noticeably smaller than the World Island, it necessarily required much sea transport to function at the technological level of the World Island—which contained sufficient natural resources for a developed economy.

Mackinder posited that the industrial centers of the Periphery were necessarily located in widely separated locations. The World Island could send its navy to destroy each one of them in turn, and could locate its own industries in a region further inland than the Periphery (so they would have a longer struggle reaching them, and would face a well-stocked industrial bastion). Mackinder called this region the &quot;Heartland&quot;. It essentially comprised Central and Eastern Europe: Ukraine, Western Russia, and Mitteleuropa. The Heartland contained the grain reserves of Ukraine, and many other natural resources. Mackinder&#x27;s notion of geopolitics was summed up when he said:

Nicholas J. Spykman was both a follower and critic of geostrategists Alfred Mahan, and Halford Mackinder. His work was based on assumptions similar to Mackinder&#x27;s, including the unity of world politics and the world sea. He extends this to include the unity of the air. Spykman adopts Mackinder&#x27;s divisions of the world, renaming some:
#The Heartland;
#The Rimland (analogous to Mackinder&#x27;s &quot;inner or marginal crescent&quot; also an intermediate region, lying between the Heartland and the marginal sea powers); and
#The Offshore Islands &amp; Continents (Mackinder&#x27;s &quot;outer or insular crescent&quot;).

Under Spykman&#x27;s theory, a Rimland separates the Heartland from ports that are usable throughout the year (that is, not frozen up during winter). Spykman suggested this required that attempts by Heartland nations (particularly Russia) to conquer ports in the Rimland must be prevented. Spykman modified Mackinder&#x27;s formula on the relationship between the Heartland and the Rimland (or the inner crescent), claiming that &quot;Who controls the rimland rules Eurasia. Who rules Eurasia controls the destinies of the world.&quot; This theory can be traced in the origins of containment, a U.S. policy on preventing the spread of Soviet influence after World War II (see also Truman Doctrine).

Another follower of Mackinder was Karl Haushofer who called Mackinder&#x27;s Geographical Pivot of History a &quot;genius&#x27; scientific tractate.&quot; He commented on it: &quot;Never have I seen anything greater than those few pages of geopolitical masterwork.&quot; Mackinder located his Pivot, in the words of Haushofer, on &quot;one of the first solid, geopolitically and geographically irreproachable maps, presented to one of the earliest scientific forums of the planet – the Royal Geographic Society in London&quot; Haushofer adopted both Mackinder&#x27;s Heartland thesis and his view of the Russian-German alliance – powers that Mackinder saw as the major contenders for control of Eurasia in the twentieth century. Following Mackinder he suggested an alliance with the Soviet Union and, advancing a step beyond Mackinder, added Japan to his design of the &quot;Eurasian Bloc.&quot;

In 2004, at the centenary of The Geographical Pivot of History, Historian Paul Kennedy wrote: &quot;Right now with hundreds of thousands of US troops in the Eurasian rimlands and with administration constantly explaining why it has to stay the course, it looks as if Washington is taking seriously Mackinder&#x27;s injunction to ensure control of the geographical pivot of history.&quot;

==Germany==

=== Friedrich Ratzel ===
Friedrich Ratzel (1844–1904), influenced by thinkers such as Darwin and zoologist Ernst Heinrich Haeckel, contributed to &#x27;Geopolitik&#x27; by the expansion on the biological conception of geography, without a static conception of borders. Positing that states are organic and growing, with borders representing only a temporary stop in their movement, he held that the expanse of a state&#x27;s borders is a reflection of the health of the nation—meaning that static countries are in decline. Ratzel published several papers, among which was the essay &quot;Lebensraum&quot; (1901) concerning biogeography. Ratzel created a foundation for the German variant of geopolitics, &quot;geopolitik&quot;. Influenced by the American geostrategist Alfred Thayer Mahan, Ratzel wrote of aspirations for German naval reach, agreeing that sea power was self-sustaining, as the profit from trade would pay for the merchant marine, unlike land power.

The geopolitical theory of Ratzel has been criticized as being too sweeping, and his interpretation of human history and geography being too simple and mechanistic. Critically, he also underestimated the importance of social organization in the development of power.

=== The association of German Geopolitik with Nazism ===

After World War I, the thoughts of Rudolf Kjellén and Ratzel were picked up and extended by a number of German authors such as Karl Haushofer (1869–1946), Erich Obst, Hermann Lautensach, and Otto Maull. In 1923, Karl Haushofer founded the &quot;Zeitschrift für Geopolitik&quot; (Journal for Geopolitics), which was later used in the propaganda of Nazi Germany. The key concepts of Haushofer&#x27;s Geopolitik were Lebensraum, autarky, pan-regions, and organic borders. States have, Haushofer argued, an undeniable right to seek natural borders which would guarantee .

Haushofer&#x27;s influence within the Nazi Party has been challenged, given that Haushofer failed to incorporate the Nazis&#x27; racial ideology into his work. Popular views of the role of geopolitics in the Nazi Third Reich suggest a fundamental significance on the part of the geo-politicians in the ideological orientation of the Nazi state. Bassin (1987) reveals that these popular views are in important ways misleading and incorrect.

Despite the numerous similarities and affinities between the two doctrines, geopolitics was always held suspect by the National Socialist ideologists. This was understandable, for the underlying philosophical orientation of geopolitics did not comply with that of National Socialism. Geopolitics shared Ratzel&#x27;s scientific materialism and geographic determinism, and held that human society was determined by external influences—in the face of which qualities held innately by individuals or groups were of reduced or no significance. National Socialism rejected in principle both materialism and determinism and also elevated innate human qualities, in the form of a hypothesized &#x27;racial character,&#x27; to the factor of greatest significance in the constitution of human society. These differences led after 1933 to friction and ultimately to open denunciation of geopolitics by Nazi ideologues. Nevertheless, German Geopolitik was discredited by its (mis)use in Nazi expansionist policy of World War II and has never achieved standing comparable to the pre-war period.

The resultant negative association, particularly in U.S. academic circles, between classical geopolitics and Nazi or imperialist ideology, is based on loose justifications. This has been observed in particular by critics of contemporary academic geography, and proponents of a &quot;neo&quot;-classical geopolitics in particular. These include Haverluk et al., who argue that the stigmatization of geopolitics in academia is unhelpful as geopolitics as a field of positivist inquiry maintains potential in researching and resolving topical, often politicized issues such as conflict resolution and prevention, and mitigating climate change.

===Disciplinary differences in perspectives===
Negative associations with the term &quot;geopolitics&quot; and its practical application stemming from its association with World War II and pre-World War II German scholars and students of geopolitics are largely specific to the field of academic geography, and especially sub-disciplines of human geography such as political geography. However, this negative association is not as strong in disciplines such as history or political science, which make use of geopolitical concepts. Classical geopolitics forms an important element of analysis for military history as well as for sub-disciplines of political science such as international relations and security studies. This difference in disciplinary perspectives is addressed by Bert Chapman in &quot;Geopolitics: A Guide To the Issues&quot;, in which Chapman makes note that academic and professional International Relations journals are more amenable to the study and analysis of Geopolitics, and in particular Classical geopolitics, than contemporary academic journals in the field of political geography.

In disciplines outside geography, geopolitics is not negatively viewed (as it often is among academic geographers such as Carolyn Gallaher or Klaus Dodds) as a tool of imperialism or associated with Nazism, but rather viewed as a valid and consistent manner of assessing major international geopolitical circumstances and events, not necessarily related to armed conflict or military operations.

== France ==
=== Montesquieu and climate theory ===
French geopolitical doctrines broadly opposed to German Geopolitik and reject the idea of a fixed geography. French geography is focused on the evolution of polymorphic territories being the result of mankind&#x27;s actions. It also relies on the consideration of long time periods through a refusal to take specific events into account. This method has been theorized by Professor Lacoste according to three principles: Representation; Diachronie; and Diatopie.

In &quot;The Spirit of the Laws&quot;, Montesquieu outlined the view that man and societies are influenced by climate. He believed that hotter climates create hot-tempered people and colder climates aloof people, whereas the mild climate of France is ideal for political systems. Considered one of the founders of French geopolitics, Élisée Reclus, is the author of a book considered a reference in modern geography (Nouvelle Géographie universelle). Alike Ratzel, he considers geography through a global vision. However, in complete opposition to Ratzel&#x27;s vision, Reclus considers geography not to be unchanging; it is supposed to evolve commensurately to the development of human society. His marginal political views resulted in his rejection by academia.

=== Ancel, Braudel, and the rejection of determinism ===
French geographer and geopolitician Jacques Ancel (1879–1936) is considered to be the first theoretician of geopolitics in France, and gave a notable series of lectures at the European Center of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Paris and published &quot;Géopolitique&quot; in 1936. Like Reclus, Ancel rejects German determinist views on geopolitics (including Haushofer&#x27;s doctrines).

Braudel&#x27;s broad view used insights from other social sciences, employed the concept of the &quot;longue durée&quot;, and downplayed the importance of specific events. This method was inspired by the French geographer Paul Vidal de la Blache (who in turn was influenced by German thought, particularly that of Friedrich Ratzel whom he had met in Germany). Braudel&#x27;s method was to analyse the interdependence between individuals and their environment. Vidalian geopolitics is based on varied forms of cartography and on &quot;possibilism&quot; (founded on a societal approach of geography—i.e. on the principle of spaces polymorphic faces depending from many factors among them mankind, culture, and ideas) as opposed to determinism.

=== Lacoste and the renaissance of French geopolitics ===
Due to the influence of German &quot;Geopolitik&quot; on French geopolitics, the latter were for a long time banished from academic works. In the mid-1970s, Yves Lacoste—a French geographer who was directly inspired by Ancel, Braudel and Vidal de la Blache—wrote &quot;La géographie, ça sert d&#x27;abord à faire la guerre&quot; (Geography first use is war) in 1976. This book symbolizes the birth of this new school of geopolitics (if not so far the first French school of geopolitics as Ancel was very isolated in the 1930s–40s). Initially linked with communist party evolved to a less liberal approach. At the end of the 1980s he founded the Institut Français de Géopolitique (French Institute for Geopolitics) that publishes the Hérodote revue. While rejecting the generalizations and broad abstractions employed by the German and Anglo-American traditions (and the &quot;new geographers&quot;), this school does focus on spatial dimension of geopolitics affairs on different levels of analysis. This approach emphasizes the importance of multi-level (or multi-scales) analysis and maps at the opposite of critical geopolitics which avoid such tools. Lacoste proposed that every conflict (both local or global) can be considered from a perspective grounded in three assumptions:
# Representation: Each group or individuals is the product of an education and is characterized by specific representations of the world or others groups or individuals. Thus, basic societal beliefs are grounded in their ethnicity or specific location. The study of representation is a common point with the more contemporary critical geopolitics. Both are connected with the work of Henri Lefebvre (La production de l&#x27;espace, first published in 1974)
# Diachronie. Conducting an historical analysis confronting &quot;long periods&quot; and short periods as the prominent French historian Fernand Braudel suggested.
# Diatopie: Conducting a cartographic survey through a multi-scale mapping.

Connected with this stream, and former member of Hérodote editorial board, the French geographer Michel Foucher developed a long term analysis of international borders. He coined various neologism among them: &quot;Horogenesis&quot;: Neologism that describes the concept of studying the &quot;birth of borders&quot;, &quot;Dyade&quot;: border shared by two neighbouring states (for instance US territory has two terrestrial dyades : one with Canada and one with Mexico). The main book of this searcher &quot;Fronts et frontières&quot; (Fronts and borders) first published in 1991, without equivalent remains untranslated in English. Michel Foucher is an expert of the African Union for borders affairs.

More or less connected with this school, Stéphane Rosière can be quoted as the editor in Chief of the online journal &quot;L&#x27;Espace politique&quot;, this journal created in 2007 became the most prominent French journal of political geography and Geopolitics with Hérodote.

French philosopher Michel Foucault&#x27;s dispositif introduced for the purpose of biopolitical research was also adopted in the field of geopolitical thought where it now plays a role.

== Russia ==
The geopolitical stance adopted by Russia has traditionally been informed by a Eurasian perspective, and Russia&#x27;s location provides a degree of continuity between the Tsarist and Soviet geostrategic stance and the position of Russia in the international order. In the 1990s, a senior researcher at the Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Vadim Tsymbursky (1957–2009), coined the term &quot;island-Russia&quot; and developed the &quot;Great Limitrophe&quot; concept.

Colonel-General Leonid Ivashov (retired), a Russian geopolitics specialist of the early 21st century, headed the Academy of Geopolitical Problems (), which analyzes the international and domestic situations and develops geopolitical doctrine. Earlier, he headed the Main Directorate for International Military Cooperation of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation.

Vladimir Karyakin, leading researcher at the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, has proposed the term &quot;geopolitics of the third wave&quot;.

Aleksandr Dugin, a Russian political analyst who has developed a close relationship with Russia&#x27;s Academy of the General Staff wrote &quot;The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia&quot; in 1997, which has had a large influence within the Russian military, police, and foreign policy elites and it has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Its publication in 1997 was well received in Russia and powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin.

== China ==
According to Li Lingqun, a major feature of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s geopolitics is attempting to change the laws of the sea to advance claims in the South China Sea. Another geopolitical issue is PRC&#x27;s claims over the territories of Taiwan against the government of the Republic of China.

Various analysts state that China created the Belt and Road Initiative as a geostrategic effort to take a larger role in global affairs, and undermine what the Communist Party perceives as American hegemony. It has also been argued that China co-founded the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and New Development Bank to compete with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in development finance. According to Bobo Lo, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization has been advertised as a &quot;political organization of a new type&quot; claimed to transcend geopolitics. Political scientist Pak Nung Wong says that a major form of geopolitics between the US and China includes cybersecurity competition, policy regulations regarding technology standards and social media platforms, and traditional and non-traditional forms of espionage.

One view of the New Great Game is a shift to geoeconomic compared to geopolitical competition. The interest in oil and gas includes pipelines that transmit energy to China&#x27;s east coast. Xiangming Chen believes that China&#x27;s role is more like Britain&#x27;s than Russia&#x27;s in the New Great Game, where Russia plays the role that the Russian Empire originally did. Chen stated, &quot;Regardless of the prospect, China through the BRI is deep in playing a &#x27;New Great Game&#x27; in Central Asia that differs considerably from its historical precedent about 150 years ago when Britain and Russia jostled with each other on the Eurasian steppes.&quot; In the Carnegie Endowment, Paul Stronski and Nicole Ng wrote in 2018 that China has not fundamentally challenged any Russian interests in Central Asia.
