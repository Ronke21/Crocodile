<text>The Battle of Tourcoing (17–18 May 1794) saw a Republican French army directed by General of Division Joseph Souham defend against an attack by a Coalition army led by Emperor Francis II and Austrian Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. The French army was temporarily led by Souham in the absence of its normal commander Jean-Charles Pichegru. Threatened with encirclement, Souham and division commanders Jean Victor Marie Moreau and Jacques Philippe Bonnaud improvised a counterattack which defeated the Coalition&#x27;s widely separated and poorly coordinated columns. The War of the First Coalition action was fought near the town of Tourcoing, north of Lille in northeastern France.

The Coalition battle plan drawn up by Karl Mack von Leiberich launched six columns that attempted to envelop part of the French army holding an awkward bulge at Menen (Menin) and Kortrijk (Courtrai). On 17 May, the French defeated Georg Wilhelm von dem Bussche&#x27;s small column while the columns of Count François of Clerfayt, Count Franz Joseph of Kinsky, and Archduke Charles made slow progress. On 18 May, Souham concentrated his main strength on the two center columns under the command of Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany and Rudolf Ritter von Otto, inflicting a costly setback on the Coalition&#x27;s Austrian, British, Hanoverian, and Hessian troops.

The action is sometimes referred to as the Battle of Tourcoin, a gesture towards the English pronunciation of the town.

==Background==
===Armies===
For the campaign of 1794, Lazare Carnot of the Committee of Public Safety devised a strategy whereby the French armies would envelop both flanks of the Coalition army defending the Austrian Netherlands. The French left wing was ordered to seize Ypres, then Ghent, then Brussels. Meanwhile, the right wing was to thrust at Namur and Liège, cutting the Austrian line of communications to Luxembourg City. The French center would defend the line between Bouchain and Maubeuge. On 8 February 1794, new commander Jean-Charles Pichegru arrived at Guise to assume leadership of the Army of the North. In March 1794, the Army of the North numbered 194,930 men, including 126,035 soldiers available for the field. Pichegru also had authority over the subordinate Army of the Ardennes which counted 32,773 men, for a combined total of 227,703 troops.

At the beginning of April, the Coalition army occupied the following positions. Not counting garrisons, the right wing numbered 24,000 Austrians, Hessians, and Hanoverians under Clerfayt with headquarters at Tournai. Ludwig von Wurmb commanded 5,000 soldiers at Denain. The 22,000 men of the right center were led by the Duke of York at Saint-Amand-les-Eaux. Headquartered at Valenciennes, Prince Coburg commanded the 43,000 troops of the center. William V, Prince of Orange commanded 19,000 Dutch of the left-center at Bavay. Franz Wenzel, Graf von Kaunitz-Rietberg led 27,000 Austrian and Dutch troops on the left wing at Bettignies. Another 15,000 Austrians under Johann Peter Beaulieu guarded the far left from Namur to Trier. Emperor Francis arrived at Valenciennes on 14 April and Coburg recommended that the fortress of Landrecies be reduced. On 21 April the Siege of Landrecies began; it ended on 30 April with a French capitulation.

===Operations===

In the Battle of Beaumont on 26 April, Coalition cavalry routed a 20,000-man French column that tried to relieve Landrecies. The Allies inflicted 7,000 casualties on the French and captured their commander René-Bernard Chapuy with Pichegru&#x27;s plans for attacking coastal Flanders. With his enemy&#x27;s plans before him, Coburg immediately sent William Erskine with a considerable reinforcement for the right wing. Clerfayt, who had been drawn to the east, was ordered back to cover the western flank. It was too late; Pichegru had already attacked. Pierre Antoine Michaud&#x27;s 12,000-man division advanced from Dunkirk toward Nieuport and Ypres. Jean Victor Marie Moreau&#x27;s 21,000-strong division from Cassel swept past Ypres and laid siege to Menen (Menin). Accompanied by Pichegru, Souham&#x27;s 30,000-man division started from Lille and seized Kortrijk (Courtrai). On 29 April, Souham defeated Clerfayt&#x27;s outnumbered force in the Battle of Mouscron. That night, the Allied garrison abandoned Menin and successfully broke through the French investment. By taking Menin and Courtrai, the French had pierced the Coalition front.

When Landrecies surrendered on 30 April, Coburg sent York west to reinforce Clerfayt. The two Coalition forces joined at Tournai: York led 18,000 soldiers, Clerfayt commanded 19,000 troops (though one British brigade was still en route), and Johann von Wallmoden had 4,000–6,000 men. The two Coalition commanders worked out a plan where Clerfayt would attack Courtrai from the north while York would strike from the direction of Tournai and cut off the French from Lille. At about the same time, Pichegru ordered Jacques Philippe Bonnaud&#x27;s large division (formerly Chapuy&#x27;s) from Cambrai to Lille. In the Battle of Courtrai on 10 May, Bonnaud&#x27;s 23,000 troops advanced to attack the Coalition troops holding Tournai. York turned the French right flank with a mass of cavalry. The French infantry repelled a series of cavalry charges, but the Allied horsemen finally prevailed after receiving artillery support; the French were forced to retreat. Also on 10 May, Clerfayt attacked Dominique Vandamme&#x27;s brigade (of Moreau&#x27;s division) at Courtrai but failed to capture the place. The next day, Souham reinforced Vandamme with part of his division. On 11 May, the French drove back Clerfayt who retreated north to Tielt. Realizing that the French forces in the area badly outnumbered him, York halted and called for reinforcements.

After the fall of Landrecies, the Coalition high command was torn between moving the army west to save coastal Flanders or east to assist Kaunitz on the Sambre River. They considered a feint attack toward Cambrai or investing Avesnes-sur-Helpe. When York&#x27;s appeal for help arrived, Kinsky was sent to Denain with 6,000 troops so that Wurmb&#x27;s force could march to Tournai. Then Kaunitz announced that he was hard-pressed. Coburg told Francis II that he must decide whether the main army should move to Flanders or to the Sambre. On 13 May, Kaunitz won the Battle of Grandreng so the next day the emperor decided the main army must move west toward Flanders. Even so, Orange and 8,000 troops were left behind to protect Landrecies. Despite the odds, York was determined to attack on 15 May, in cooperation with Clerfayt. In the night of 14 May, a message arrived from Francis telling York that he would soon arrive and the Allies would launch a major attack. Francis joined York in Tournai on 15 May while Archduke Charles and the main Coalition army arrived at Saint-Amand-les-Eaux.

As an added distraction, the Kościuszko Uprising broke out in Poland on 25 March and quickly spread. This event took Francis, Catherine I of Russia and Frederick William II of Prussia completely by surprise. Catherine asked Francis for help and Prussia withdrew 20,000 soldiers from the war against France. At imperial headquarters, one faction led by Coburg wanted to continue the war with France, while another faction wanted Austria&#x27;s energies directed toward Poland in order to thwart its rival Prussia.

==Plans==

On 16 May, staffs of the Coalition army drew up a battle plan. Coburg&#x27;s chief-of-staff Mack called it the &quot;Vernichtungsplan&quot; (Annihilation Plan). Mack is usually credited with its development, but the strategic concept may have been York&#x27;s. The plan&#x27;s stated goal was, &quot;to act upon the enemy&#x27;s communications between Lille and Menin and Courtrai, to defeat his armies that he has advanced upon the Lys and to drive him out of Flanders&quot;. The battlefield was bounded on the north by the Lys River and on the east by the Scheldt River. The Marque River flows north from Pont-à-Marcq until it empties into the Deûle which is a tributary of the Lys. The Marque could only be crossed by bridges because of its soft bottom and swampy banks. The Spiere brook rises near Roubaix and flows eastward into the Scheldt at Spiere. The land is mostly level, but there were many villages and farmhouses enclosed by hedges. It was difficult to move off-road, but roads were plentiful in the region and the main roads were wide. The terrain was not favorable for cavalry operations, giving the French an advantage.
According to historian John Fortescue, the Allies divided their 62,000-man army (including 12,000 cavalry) into six columns. Bussche led 4,000 Hanoverians in 5 battalions and 8 squadrons. These included 2 battalions of the 1st Infantry Regiment, the 1st and 4th Grenadier Battalions, and 2 squadrons each of the 1st and 7th Cavalry and the 9th and 10th Light Dragoon Regiments. Otto commanded 10,000 men in 12 battalions and 10 squadrons. York directed 10,000 soldiers in 12 battalions and ten squadrons. York&#x27;s column included the following British troops: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Foot Guards, Guards Flank Battalion, 14th Foot, 37th Foot, 53rd Foot, Flank Battalion, 7th, 15th, and 16th Light Dragoons. Kinsky led 9,000 men in 10 battalions and 16 squadrons and Charles commanded 14,000 men in 17 battalions and 32 squadrons. Clerfayt had 16,000 troops in 25 battalions and 28 squadrons. In addition, a cavalry reserve of 16 British squadrons under Erskine was assembled near Hertain.

Ramsay Weston Phipps stated that the Allies employed 73,350 soldiers. Five columns would attack from the Tournai area and were numbered from north to south. Bussche&#x27;s first column consisted of 4,000 Hanoverians and was ordered to move north from Warcoing to Dottignies, then west to Mouscron. However, one-third of Bussche&#x27;s column was sent on a subsidiary mission toward Courtrai. Otto&#x27;s second column counted 10,000 soldiers and was sent northwest through Leers, Wattrelos, and Tourcoing. York&#x27;s third column numbered 10,750 troops and was directed to advance abreast of Otto&#x27;s column from Templeuve through Lannoy, Roubaix, and Mouvaux. Kinsky&#x27;s fourth column had 11,000 men and would start from Marquain and force its way across the Marque River at Bouvines. Charles&#x27; fifth column was 18,000-strong. Starting from Saint-Amand-les-Eaux, it would march to Pont-à-Marcq while sending a detachment to preserve contact with Kinsky. It was ordered to force a passage across the Marque and turn north, join Kinsky&#x27;s column, and finally join hands with York near Mouvaux. The sixth column under Clerfayt counted 19,600 men and was instructed to move south from Tielt to Wervik, cross the Lys, and press southeast toward Tourcoing.

On 13 May, Pichegru left the scene to pay a visit to his right wing, leaving Souham in temporary command. The Army of the North included the divisions of Souham (28,000), Moreau (22,000), Bonnaud (20,000) and Pierre-Jacques Osten (10,000), altogether 82,000 soldiers. Osten&#x27;s soldiers were posted at Pont-à-Marcq. Bonnaud&#x27;s men bivouacked at Sainghin-en-Mélantois with detachments at Lannoy and Pont-à-Tressin. Souham&#x27;s and Moreau&#x27;s troops were on the south bank of the Lys between Courtrai and Aalbeke. Jean François Thierry&#x27;s brigade was located at Mouscron. Louis Fursy Henri Compère&#x27;s brigade occupied Tourcoing to preserve the connection with Bonnaud. As recently as 10 May, Souham&#x27;s division consisted of the following brigades: Étienne Macdonald, Herman Willem Daendels, Jan Willem de Winter, Henri-Antoine Jardon, and Philippe Joseph Malbrancq. Compère and Thierry each led independent brigades. Bonnaud&#x27;s division was made up of the brigades of Jean-Baptiste Salme, Nicolas Pierquin, and Pierre Nöel, while the cavalry was grouped under Antoine-Raymond Baillot-Faral. Moreau had only the brigades of Dominique Vandamme and Nicolas Joseph Desenfans, and the latter unit was observing Ypres and not in close contact. Fortescue credited Vandamme with 8,000 troops, while Steve Brown stated that he commanded 12,000 troops.

==Battle==
===17 May: Clerfayt, Kinsky, and Charles===
Problems with the Allied plan began to appear at once. Clerfayt did not receive his orders until late in the morning on 16 May and his column did not start until the evening. The sandy roads slowed the march so that his troops did not reach Wervik until the afternoon of 17 May. Clerfayt found the bridge over the Lys was well-fortified by the French. When he called for his pontoon train, it was found that it had been left in the rear by some blunder and the column was delayed several hours. It was 1:00 am on 18 May before the pontoon bridge was ready to use. Only a few battalions crossed, but most of Clerfayt&#x27;s men camped on the north bank that night.

The other columns encountered a heavy fog early on 17 May. While Kinsky had only to march from Froidmont to Bouvines, Charles&#x27; column was expected to march from Saint-Amand to Pont-à-Marcq. After receiving a message from Charles that his column would not be able to reach Pont-à-Marcq by 6:00 am on 17 May, Kinsky delayed his march. Nevertheless, Kinsky eventually moved forward and drove the French from Bouvines. His troops were unable to cross the Marque because the French had broken the bridge and covered the crossing with a battery of heavy guns. Erskine&#x27;s reserve cavalry was supposed to support York, but it took the wrong road and joined Kinsky&#x27;s column instead. Charles&#x27; column left Saint-Amand at 10:00 pm on 16 May and fought its way across the river at Pont-à-Marcq at 2:00 pm on 17 May. His soldiers reached Lesquin but were too tired to go any farther. Charles&#x27; advance forced Bonnaud to abandon Sainghin and withdraw to Lille, allowing Kinsky to repair the bridge at Bouvines. However, Kinsky cautiously had his soldiers camp on the east bank of the Marque that night.

===17 May: Bussche, Otto, and York===
During the night, Bussche assembled at Saint-Leger to the west of Warcoing. On 17 May, his column advanced to Mouscron and captured the place. Bussche was stoutly opposed by Thierry&#x27;s brigade, which was reinforced by Souham. Compère counterattacked, recovering Mouscron and throwing Bussche&#x27;s troops back to Dottignies and Herseaux. Most of the 1st Hanoverian Infantry was captured. Otto&#x27;s column successively drove Compère&#x27;s brigade from Leers, Wattrelos, and Tourcoing. However, this merely pushed Compère&#x27;s men back to Mouscron where they were able to join Thierry&#x27;s brigade and help defeat Bussche.

York&#x27;s column moved through Templeuve to attack Lannoy with the Guards brigade, supported by the light dragoons. The French fled so quickly that they suffered very few casualties. York left two Hessian battalions to hold Lannoy and pressed onward to Roubaix. Though the place was well-defended, the Guards brigade chased the French out of Roubaix. Around 5:00–6:00 pm, York found that Mouscron was still held by the French and decided to halt his advance at Roubaix. He had also heard nothing from Otto or Kinsky. However, Emperor Francis ordered York to continue his march to Mouvaux and overrode his objections. Therefore, the Guards brigade under Ralph Abercromby assaulted the village with the bayonet, driving the French from their well-fortified positions and capturing 3 cannons. The 7th and 15th Light Dragoons circled around Mouvaux and caught the retreating French, cutting down 300 of them. A group of light dragoons actually galloped into the French camp at Bondues and caused a minor panic.

===17 May: Evening===
On the morning of 17 May, the French generals had no idea of the trap being sprung around them. They were only aware of the movements of Clerfayt&#x27;s column, so they moved the divisions of Souham and Moreau to the north bank of the Lys. As reports of the Allied advance reached them, the French commanders reacted. Only Vandamme&#x27;s brigade was left on the north bank to observe Clerfayt, while the rest of the troops were recalled to the south bank. Souham, Souham&#x27;s staff officer Jean Reynier, Moreau, Macdonald, Macdonald&#x27;s staff officer Pamphile Lacroix, and Pichegru&#x27;s chief-of-staff Jean Jacques Liébert met at Menin in council that evening to decide on a plan. Simply put, Moreau would defend the line of the Lys against Clerfayt&#x27;s advance while Souham struck southwest from Courtrai and Bonnaud attacked northeast from Lille. Early in the morning they would hurl approximately 40,000 troops at the 20,000 Allies under York and Otto. Meanwhile, the division of André Drut at Douai would mount a demonstration to the northeast and the Lille garrison would feint to its southeast. Moreau remarked, &quot;It would require a piece of good fortune, on which we cannot count, to prevent half my division and myself being sacrificed according to this plan, but still it is the best which can be proposed, and consequently it should be adopted.&quot;

On the evening of 17 May, Coalition headquarters knew that Bussche failed to capture Mouscron and that Charles was out of position. It had no news at all from Clerfayt. Uneasy that his left flank was not covered, at 9:00 pm York asked permission to withdraw to Lannoy. Mack refused, promising York that Charles and Kinsky would be up in time. At 1:00 am Mack dispatched Captain Franz von Koller to Charles with orders to march to Lannoy immediately. At 4:00 am when Koller arrived at Charles&#x27; headquarters, his staff refused to awaken the general. In fact, Charles, who suffered from epilepsy, had a seizure. However, the staff failed to notify the next in command. At 3:00 am, Mack sent a fresh set of orders instructing Charles to leave 10 battalions and 20 squadrons to watch Lille, and march with Kinsky to Lannoy.

York and Otto were ordered to attack Mouscron at noon. The Coalition staff officers apparently never considered that the positions of the second and third columns invited a French counterattack. Bussche&#x27;s mauled units defended Dottignies and Coyghem. Otto&#x27;s column was distributed with 7½ battalions and 3 squadrons at Tourcoing, 2 battalions at Wattrelos, and 3 battalions and 3 squadrons at Leers. York&#x27;s column was spread out with Abercromby&#x27;s Guards brigade and the 7th and 15th Light Dragoons at Mouvaux, 4 Austrian battalions and the 16th Light Dragoons defended Roubaix, 2 Hessian battalions held Lannoy, and Henry Edward Fox&#x27;s brigade (14th, 37th, and 53rd Foot) deployed west of Roubaix, watching Lille. Patrolling the area were 4 Austrian squadrons. The nearest unit belonging to Kinsky&#x27;s column was distant at Pont-à-Tressin. This was Wurmb&#x27;s Hessian brigade.
===18 May: French counterattack===

Malbrancq&#x27;s brigade lay south of Menin at Roncq and Blancfour. To its east, Macdonald&#x27;s brigade was posted at Halluin. The brigades of Daendels and Jardon deployed farther east between Aalbeke and Belleghem. The brigades of Compère and Thierry at Mouscron plugged the space between Macdonald and Daendels. The divisions of Bonnaud and Osten were near Flers. At 3:00 am on 18 May, the French army began moving into its assault positions. Osten&#x27;s division and Baillot&#x27;s cavalry were left to fend off any advances from Kinsky and Charles in the area of Flers and Lezennes. Bonnaud split his 18,000 troops into two columns: the northern moved through Pont-a-Breug (modern Flers-Breucq) toward Roubaix, the southern moved through L&#x27;Hempenpont toward Lannoy. Malbrancq moved south from Roncq toward Mouvaux. Macdonald advanced from Halluin against the west side of Tourcoing. Compère marched from Mouscron against Tourcoing&#x27;s north side. Thierry moved from Mouscron and Daendels marched from Aalbeke; both attacked Wattrelos. Jardon advanced from Belleghem against Dottignies where his troops dueled with Bussche&#x27;s Hanoverians the rest of the day.

The French assault hit Otto at dawn and the local commander Paul Vay De Vay asked York to send help. York sent 2 battalions of Infantry Regiment &quot;Grand Duke of Tuscany&quot; Nr. 23 with orders to return if they were too late to save the town. In fact, by the time they reached Tourcoing, the place had already fallen to the French and they never returned to York. The Austrian commander at Tourcoing, Eugen von Montfrault took a defensive position east of the town, but he was compelled to retreat when a French battery opened fire from the north. Montfrault formed his troops into a large square, with 4 battalions and light artillery in front, 1 battalion protecting each flank, cavalry guarding the rear, heavy artillery and wagons in the center, and light infantry holding a skirmish line. Montfrault started withdrawing in this formation about 8:15 am. The 2 Hessian battalions in Wattrelos, outnumbered 6-to-1, were forced to retreat at 8:00 am. With the help of a 2-company force sent by Otto, the Hessians escaped to Leers. Unable to retreat through Wattrelos, Montfrault&#x27;s still-intact square turned into a secondary road that passed west of the town. Here, Montfrault was hit by Bonnaud&#x27;s troops from the south and Souham&#x27;s men from the north and west. The square formation broke up and the Austrians fled to Leers.

Between 6:00 and 7:00 am, Bonnaud&#x27;s division began attacking York&#x27;s troops at Roubaix and Lannoy; this was a little after Otto&#x27;s column came under assault. Soon after, Malbrancq&#x27;s brigade attacked Mouvaux from the north and some of the French formations that had captured Tourcoing began to appear north of Roubaix. York fruitlessly sent couriers to recall the two battalions sent to Otto. At Mouvaux, the defenses faced east with the line bent back to the hamlet of Le Fresnoy to defend against attack from the north. Fox&#x27;s brigade faced west toward Lille. The remaining Austrian battalions were posted near Roubaix, to Fox&#x27;s right rear. These units were soon swept away by the French assault partly because Bonnaud&#x27;s troops moved through the gaps left by the two missing battalions. By this time, the brigades of Thierry and Daendels were advancing from Wattrelos to strike York&#x27;s column from the north. The French attackers completely isolated Abercromby&#x27;s Guards brigade and York sent orders for it to fall back to Roubaix.

Abercromby&#x27;s Guards withdrew to Roubaix protecting a convoy of artillery, with the 7th and 15th Light Dragoons acting as the rearguard. Roubaix was still held by a dismounted squadron of the 16th Light Dragoons. The column of guns and the Guards brigade exited the walled town safely and turned right into the road leading to Lannoy. As the Austrian Hussars emerged, a nearby French gun took the column in enfilade, causing havoc. The Hussars tried in vain to find another escape route, but finally galloped down the road through a gauntlet of fire. Unknown to the horsemen, the artillery train ahead of them had been ambushed and the drivers panicked, abandoning their guns and limbers in the road and fleeing with the horses. After riding , the cavalry plowed into the artillery blockade, throwing horses and riders to the ground, as the French peppered them with musketry. The British camp followers were also killed in the chaos. Robert Wilson watched a soldier&#x27;s wife kiss her baby and then throw it in a ditch. &quot;She frantically rushed forwards and, before she got ten yards, was rent in pieces by a discharge of grape that entered her back.&quot; Wilson claimed that York&#x27;s column lost 56 guns.

Eventually the Guards cleared the immediate area and the rest of the troops recovered themselves. As the column neared Lannoy, it was believed to be held by the French. In fact, the 2 battalions of Hessians were still holding out. Seeing some cavalrymen and believing them to be Hessians, William Congreve allowed them to approach; they were French and cut the harnesses to the gun teams. The Guards and the cavalry marched cross-country to Marquain. The Guards brigade lost 196 officers and men while the light dragoons lost 52 men and 92 horses. The British artillery lost 19 out of 28 guns. The Hessians were forced to abandon Lannoy soon after; they sustained 330 casualties out of 900 men.

Fox&#x27;s brigade defended itself successfully from Bonnaud&#x27;s troops, but found itself surrounded. The brigade withdrew in good order, reaching the main road near Lannoy. Soon afterward, the brigade found that the French had set up a battery in the road blocking their escape. At this moment, a French emigrant who had enlisted in the 14th Foot offered to guide Fox&#x27;s soldiers cross-country. Though continually harassed by French skirmishers, cannon fire, and cavalry, the British brigade managed to reach Leers and safety. However, it suffered the loss of all its battalion guns but one, and 534 officers and men out of a total of 1,120. York barely evaded capture after starting the day at Roubaix. Finding himself cut off from the forces of Abercromby and Fox, and seeing his Austrian battalions melting away, he took a small escort from the 16th Light Dragoons and rode toward Wattrelos. While riding through that town, York&#x27;s party was taken under fire by some French soldiers and then they rode cross-country. They came upon a small group of Hessians defending the Spiere brook. York&#x27;s horse refused to cross the brook, so he waded across, took the horse of an aide-de-camp, and got away to Otto at Leers. Souham later remarked that York, &quot;came within an ace of accompanying his guns to Lille&quot;.

===18 May: Clerfayt, Kinsky, and Charles===

At 7:00 am, Clerfayt&#x27;s column crossed the Lys near Wervik. His troops marched toward Linselles and Bousbecque where they faced Vandamme&#x27;s brigade (now on the south bank). Clerfayt drove back Vandamme&#x27;s right flank and captured 8 guns. Desenfans&#x27; brigade retreated southwest to Bailleul when it might have operated against Clerfayt&#x27;s western flank. An advanced guard composed of one squadron each of the British 8th Light Dragoons and a Hessian cavalry regiment was surrounded by the French. The Coalition troopers gallantly cut their way out of the trap, though they lost two-thirds of their numbers. Vandamme reported that the cavalry got as far as Halluin, causing his artillery to hurriedly withdraw. Two battalions arrived, Vandamme&#x27;s men steadied, pushed back Clerfayt a distance, and captured a color from the 8th Light Dragoons. Thinking that the French received 5,000 reinforcements, Clerfayt pulled back to Wervik while hoping to renew the offensive on 19 May. In fact, Vandamme&#x27;s brigade had fought alone.The French formations did not pursue Otto and York, because of the looming threat from Clerfayt. Souham ordered the brigades of Malbrancq, Macdonald, and Daendels to march against Clerfayt on the evening of 18 May. Bonnaud, Thierry, and Compère were left to hold Wattrelos and Lannoy. That night, Clerfayt received notice of the Coalition defeat. He withdrew across the Lys and continued to Roeselare, carrying off 300 prisoners and 7 guns. The French tried to move through Menin to intercept Clerfayt, but Hanoverian cavalry repulsed the leading elements.

When Kinsky was urged by the emperor&#x27;s aide-de-camp to push forward to Sainghin, he replied, &quot;Kinsky knows what he has to do&quot;. Nevertheless, his column remained inactive. At 6:00 am, one of his subordinates asked for orders and Kinsky announced that he was sick and no longer in command. At 2:00 pm, Kinsky heard about the defeat of York and Ott and withdrew. Charles received early-morning orders to march to Lannoy, only distant. Yet, his troops did not move until noon and did not reach the Tournai-Lille highway until 3:00 pm. By then, new orders arrived directing him to fall back to Tournai. Charles later proved himself to be a gifted commander, but the inertia of Kinsky and Charles on this day was so astounding that it led Fortescue to opine that their lack of urgency was encouraged at headquarters by generals in the faction of Johann Amadeus von Thugut, the Austrian prime minister, in an act of deliberate betrayal to sabotage the English so Austria would not be kept in the war against France, and could focus instead on countering Prussia in Poland, his preferred foreign policy priority. However, Fortescue&#x27;s chauvinistic assertion was based on the claim that Austrian headquarters had not urged Kinsky and Charles forward, whereas they actually had tried. Phipps wrote of Kinsky and Charles, &quot;As far as the battle was concerned, the 29,000 men of these two columns might have been a hundred miles away&quot;.

==Results==
Gaston Bodart stated Allied losses at Tourcoing as 4,000 killed or wounded and 1,500 captured. He gave French casualties as 3,000. According to Digby Smith, the French suffered a loss of 3,000 casualties, including brigadier Pierquin killed, and seven cannons. The Allies lost 4,000 killed and wounded, with 1,500 men captured. There was no pursuit of the defeated Allied main body. Of his 74,000 Allied soldiers, Coburg only committed 48,000 to battle. Edward Cust estimated that the Coalition lost 3,000 men and 60 guns. H. Coutanceau believed that York&#x27;s column lost 53 officers, 1,830 men, and 32 guns, while T. J. Jones only admitted a loss of 65 killed and 875 wounded and missing.

On 27 May, Coburg wrote to York that Emperor Francis was perfectly satisfied with his actions at Tourcoing, and that York had executed all his orders properly. Francis and the Austrian generals were discouraged at the result. The morale of the British soldiers remained intact, but the men were bitter at their Austrian allies for apparently abandoning them. On 23 May, Mack resigned his position of chief-of-staff and left the army. In his opinion, the reconquest of the Austrian Netherlands was a lost cause. The following day, a gloomy council of war was held by Francis, with only York asking for a renewal of the attack on the French. Nevertheless, Kaunitz again beat the French right wing on the Sambre at the Battle of Erquelinnes. Pichegru rejoined his army on 19 May and began planning for an attack on the Coalition army that would result in the Battle of Tournai.

<text>The Fermat primality test is a probabilistic test to determine whether a number is a probable prime.

==Concept==
Fermat&#x27;s little theorem states that if &quot;p&quot; is prime and &quot;a&quot; is not divisible by &quot;p&quot;, then

:formula_1

If one wants to test whether &quot;p&quot; is prime, then we can pick random integers &quot;a&quot; not divisible by &quot;p&quot; and see whether the congruence holds. If it does not hold for a value of &quot;a&quot;, then &quot;p&quot; is composite. This congruence is unlikely to hold for a random &quot;a&quot; if &quot;p&quot; is composite. Therefore, if the equality does hold for one or more values of &quot;a&quot;, then we say that &quot;p&quot; is probably prime.

However, note that the above congruence holds trivially for formula_2, because the congruence relation is compatible with exponentiation. It also holds trivially for formula_3 if &quot;p&quot; is odd, for the same reason. That is why one usually chooses a random &quot;a&quot; in the interval formula_4.

Any &quot;a&quot; such that 
:formula_5
when &quot;n&quot; is composite is known as a &quot;Fermat liar&quot;. In this case &quot;n&quot; is called Fermat pseudoprime to base &quot;a&quot;.

If we do pick an &quot;a&quot; such that 
:formula_6
then &quot;a&quot; is known as a &quot;Fermat witness&quot; for the compositeness of &quot;n&quot;.

== Example ==
Suppose we wish to determine whether &quot;n&quot; = 221 is prime. Randomly pick 1 &lt; &quot;a&quot; &lt; 220, say &quot;a&quot; = 38. We check the above congruence and find that it holds:
:formula_7
Either 221 is prime, or 38 is a Fermat liar, so we take another &quot;a&quot;, say 24:
:formula_8
So 221 is composite and 38 was indeed a Fermat liar. Furthermore, 24 is a Fermat witness for the compositeness of 221.

==Algorithm==
The algorithm can be written as follows:
:Inputs: &quot;n&quot;: a value to test for primality, &quot;n&quot;&gt;3; &quot;k&quot;: a parameter that determines the number of times to test for primality
:Output: &quot;composite&quot; if &quot;n&quot; is composite, otherwise &quot;probably prime&quot;
:Repeat &quot;k&quot; times:
::Pick &quot;a&quot; randomly in the range [2, &quot;n&quot; − 2]
::If formula_9, then return &quot;composite&quot;
:If composite is never returned: return &quot;probably prime&quot;

The &quot;a&quot; values 1 and &quot;n&quot;-1 are not used as the equality holds for all &quot;n&quot; and all odd &quot;n&quot; respectively, hence testing them adds no value.

=== Complexity ===

Using fast algorithms for modular exponentiation and multiprecision multiplication, the running time of this algorithm is , where &quot;k&quot; is the number of times we test a random &quot;a&quot;, and &quot;n&quot; is the value we want to test for primality; see Miller–Rabin primality test for details.

==Flaw==
There are infinitely many Fermat pseudoprimes to any given basis &quot;a&quot; &gt; 1.
Even worse, there are infinitely many Carmichael numbers. These are numbers formula_10 for which all values of formula_11 with formula_12 are Fermat liars. For these numbers, repeated application of the Fermat primality test performs the same as a simple random search for factors. While Carmichael numbers are substantially rarer than prime numbers (Erdös&#x27; upper bound for the number of Carmichael numbers is lower than the prime number function n/log(n)) there are enough of them that Fermat&#x27;s primality test is not often used in the above form. Instead, other more powerful extensions of the Fermat test, such as Baillie–PSW, Miller–Rabin, and Solovay–Strassen are more commonly used.

In general, if formula_10 is a composite number that is not a Carmichael number, then at least half of all

:formula_14 (i.e. formula_15)

are Fermat witnesses. For proof of this, let formula_11 be a Fermat witness and formula_17, formula_18, ..., formula_19 be Fermat liars. Then

:formula_20

and so all formula_21 for formula_22 are Fermat witnesses.

==Applications==

As mentioned above, most applications use a Miller–Rabin or Baillie–PSW test for primality. Sometimes a Fermat test (along with some trial division by small primes) is performed first to improve performance. GMP since version 3.0 uses a base-210 Fermat test after trial division and before running Miller–Rabin tests. Libgcrypt uses a similar process with base 2 for the Fermat test, but OpenSSL does not.

In practice with most big number libraries such as GMP, the Fermat test is not noticeably faster than a Miller–Rabin test, and can be slower for many inputs.

As an exception, OpenPFGW uses only the Fermat test for probable prime testing. The program is typically used with multi-thousand digit inputs with a goal of maximum speed with very large inputs. Another well known program that relies only on the Fermat test is PGP where it is only used for testing of self-generated large random values (an open source counterpart, GNU Privacy Guard, uses a Fermat pretest followed by Miller–Rabin tests).

<doc id="157757" wikidata="Q1088879" url="?curid=157757" title="Battle of Trebbia (1799)">
<text>The Battle of (the) Trebbia (17 [6 OS] – 20 [9 OS] June, 1799) was fought near the rivers of Tidone, Trebbia, and Nure in northern Italy between the joint Russian and Habsburg army under Alexander Suvorov and the Republican French army of Étienne-Jacques-Joseph-Alexandre Macdonald. Though French forces were moderately more numerous, the Austro-Russians severely defeated the French, sustaining about 5,500 casualties while inflicting losses of 16,500 on their enemies. The War of the Second Coalition engagement occurred west of Piacenza, a city located southeast of Milan.

In the spring of 1799 the Habsburg and Russian armies ousted the French from much of northern Italy after the battles of Magnano and Cassano and they placed the key fortress of Mantua under siege. Assembling the French occupation forces of southern and central Italy into an army, Macdonald moved north to challenge his enemies. Rather than playing safe by moving along the west coast road, Macdonald boldly chose to move east of the Apennine Mountains, hoping to be supported by Jean Victor Marie Moreau&#x27;s French army. After brushing aside a much smaller Austrian force at Modena, Macdonald&#x27;s army swept west along the south bank of the Po River. Suvorov swiftly concentrated his Russians and the allied Austrians of Michael von Melas to block the French move. The four-day battle took place in hot weather, and despite the fatigue of the Allied troops, they moved into the fight immediately after the march.

On 17 June, the leading French divisions bumped into a holding force led by Peter Karl Ott von Bátorkéz along the Tidone River. Ott was rapidly reinforced by the mass of the Austro-Russian army and the French pulled back to the Trebbia. Suvorov attacked on the 18th: the French managed to hold off the Allied drive, but they abandoned positions on the west bank of the Trebbia. On 19 June almost entire Macdonald&#x27;s 33,500-strong army was concentrated and he ordered an attack which was poorly coordinated and repulsed at all points by the numerically inferior 22,000-strong Coalition forces. Realizing that assistance from Moreau was not forthcoming, that night Macdonald ordered the beaten French army to slip away to the south and west. The French initially had more men during the beginning of the battle, 19,000 compared to the 12–15,000 of the Russians. On the 20th, along the Nure River, the Allies overran the French 17th demi-brigade acting as rearguard. Instead of bringing a powerful reinforcement to the hard-pressed French in northwest Italy, only the crippled remains of Macdonald&#x27;s army arrived.

The battle of the Trebbia, or the Campaign of the Trebbia as Duffy called it, is one of the great victories in Alexander Suvorov&#x27;s military career, along with the storming of Izmail. French general Moreau referred to the battle as a masterpiece of the military art, with Macdonald, the French general whom Suvorov defeated, sharing the same opinion. Military historians note that if Suvorov had no previous feats in his career, that the Trebbia campaign alone would make him a great commander.

Due to participation of some 3,000 soldiers of the Polish Legions, who were in the nominal service of the Cisalpine Republic, the Battle of Trebbia is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription &quot;TREBBIA 17 - 19 VI 1799&quot;. Macdonald&#x27;s army also included one Cisalpine dragoon regiment and one Cisalpine hussar regiment from the Lombard Legion.

==Background==
===Coalition successes===
The War of the Second Coalition in northern Italian began with the inconclusive Battle of Verona on 26 March 1799 between the Habsburg army of Paul Kray and the Republican French &quot;Army of Italy&quot; under Barthélemy Louis Joseph Schérer. The subsequent Battle of Magnano on 5 April was a clear-cut victory by Kray over the French, with the Austrians sustaining 6,000 casualties while inflicting losses of 8,000 men and 18 guns on their foes. The defeat was a crushing blow to French morale and prompted Schérer to plead with the French Directory to be relieved of command. Finding his strong position behind the Mincio River outflanked on the north by 12,000 Austrians, Schérer left 12,000 troops to hold the key fortress of Mantua, directed 1,600 more to defend Peschiera del Garda and retreated to the west on 12 April. Two days later, Alexander Suvorov arrived at Vicenza with an Imperial Russian army and assumed command of the combined Austro-Russian forces.

On 27 April, the Coalition allies led by Suvorov were victorious over Jean Victor Marie Moreau&#x27;s French army at the Battle of Cassano along the Adda River. The next day at Verderio, Jean-Mathieu-Philibert Sérurier&#x27;s division was surrounded and in the fighting that followed the French lost 252 men killed before the 2,700 survivors gave up. The defeats caused Moreau to fall back, leaving 2,400 men to hold the Milan citadel. On 6 May the garrison of Peschiera capitulated to Kray while on 11 May Pizzighettone and 1,500 French soldiers surrendered to Konrad Valentin von Kaim. On 12 May, Suvorov&#x27;s subordinate Andrei Grigorevich Rosenberg through the blame of Konstantin Pavlovich suffered a minor setback in the Battle of Bassignana, but then Suvorov&#x27;s troops were victorious at the First Battle of Marengo (Battle of San Giuliano) on 16 May. Ferrara, Ravenna and Milan all capitulated to Austrian besieging forces on 24 May.

Meanwhile, 30,000 Allies under Suvorov moved up the north bank of the Po River toward Turin. On the morning of 26 May, Josef Philipp Vukassovich&#x27;s advance guard seized Turin with its arsenal and over 300 cannons plus large stocks of ammunition. Pascal Antoine Fiorella and his 3,400-man French garrison withdrew to the citadel where they were besieged. Early June found the Allied main body of 47,087 troops under Suvorov, Rosenberg and Michael von Melas camped near Turin. Karl Joseph Hadik von Futak with 9,900 Austrians watched the Swiss mountain passes. Kray&#x27;s 19,760-man corps was engaged in the Siege of Mantua, covered by 6,122 Austrians under Johann von Klenau at Ferrera. Finally, Suvorov summoned the 19,458-strong corps of Count Heinrich von Bellegarde from Switzerland to Milan where they arrived on 5 June. To face this array, Moreau counted about 25,000 soldiers in the divisions of Paul Grenier, Claude Victor-Perrin, Pierre Garnier de Laboissière at Genoa, Paul Louis Gaultier de Kervéguen at Florence and Joseph Hélie Désiré Perruquet de Montrichard at Bologna. But the Allies were aware that Jacques MacDonald had a strong French occupation force in southern and central Italy.

===MacDonald&#x27;s offensive===
On 14 April 1799, the French Directory ordered MacDonald to help the French forces in northern Italy. Accordingly, he assembled the &quot;Army of Naples&quot; and moved north, leaving southern Italy in the hands of local forces. MacDonald reached Rome on 16 May and Florence ten days later. From there, the safest course was to use the west coast road to reach Genoa, keeping the Apennine Mountains between him and the Allies. However, MacDonald believed that the coast road was unusable for his artillery beyond Lerici and feared that Austrian columns might interfere with the operation. But perhaps the real reason was that MacDonald wished to make a theatrical entrance to the campaign by smashing his way through the Coalition allies. In order to accomplish this, he asked Moreau to march north and east to meet him near Piacenza, an impractical move that would place the &quot;Army of Italy&quot; in the midst of its enemies. After his passage across the Apennines, MacDonald hoped to crush some of the Austrian covering forces. As it moved north, the &quot;Army of Naples&quot; absorbed the divisions of Victor, Montrichard and Gaultier, bringing its total field force to 36,728 soldiers.

On 9 June Suvorov received news from Peter Karl Ott von Bátorkéz that Victor and Montrichard reinforced MacDonald and that the French captured Pontremoli. Ott commanded 5,000 soldiers that belonged to Bellegarde&#x27;s corps, but were acting independently near Parma. Immediately, Suvorov ordered Ott to conduct a staged withdrawal to Stradella, but to hold that position at all hazards. The Russian commander quickly made up his mind to move east to confront MacDonald. With the exception of Kaim&#x27;s division, the Austro-Russian army marched to Asti, reaching there on 11 June. The Allied troops reached the Bormida River near the French-held fortress of Alessandria on 13 June. That day, Suvorov got definite news of MacDonald&#x27;s offensive. Meanwhile, a French squadron put in at Genoa on 2 June to drop off French reinforcements. Intelligence indicated that Moreau was about to descend from the mountains. Suvorov ordered Bellegarde&#x27;s corps to march on Alessandria to keep an eye on Moreau while the rest of his army concentrated against MacDonald.

The &quot;Army of Naples&quot; negotiated the Apennine Mountains in four major columns. The divisions of Montrichard and Jean-Baptiste Dominique Rusca formed the easternmost column, moving from Florence to Bologna. Next to the west were the divisions of Jean-Baptiste Olivier and François Watrin, accompanied by MacDonald and advancing from Pistoia on Modena. Farther west was Jean Henri Dombrowski&#x27;s division descending the Secchia River valley. The westernmost column was made up of Victor&#x27;s division marching from Borgo Val di Taro down the Taro River toward Parma. Because MacDonald&#x27;s offensive across the Apennines was so unlikely, it took the Austrian covering forces by surprise. These were Klenau&#x27;s command southwest of Ferrara, now reduced to 3,500 men, Prince Friedrich Franz Xaver of Hohenzollern-Hechingen at Modena with 4,800 troops and Ott west of Fornovo di Taro. MacDonald planned to destroy Hohenzollern&#x27;s division by pinning it with his own column while enveloping it with Dombrowski&#x27;s division from the west and Rusca&#x27;s division from the east. Klenau deduced the French strategy and shifted northeast behind the Panaro River to block Rusca. MacDonald lost touch with Dombrowski&#x27;s command. Nevertheless, MacDonald fell on the Austrians at Modena with two divisions. On 12 June in the Battle of Modena, the French inflicted losses of 750 killed and wounded on their enemies while capturing 1,650 men, eight guns and three colors. French casualties were 400 killed and wounded and 200 captured. During the pursuit, MacDonald was set upon by a troop of French Royalist cavalry and suffered saber cuts on the head and arm before his own soldiers could finish off their enemies.

Since the fortress of Alessandria commanded the only crossing of the Bormida, the Austro-Russian main body waited on a pontoon train which finally arrived on 15 June. At 5:00 pm the span was in place and Suvorov&#x27;s army crossed and marched all night to reach Castelnuovo Scrivia on the morning of the 16th. After only three hours of rest, the soldiers continued the forced march during the day to their bivouac between Casteggio and Casatisma. In a period of 24 hours the Allied army covered in the scorching heat. Many fell down from fatigue. To provide security for his right flank, Suvorov detached Mikhail Mikhailovich Veletsky with one battalion of the &quot;Jung-Baden&quot; Musketeer Regiment, 50 Cossacks and 80 dragoons from the &quot;Karaczay&quot; Regiment. Allowing for the possibility of defeat, the Russian army commander ordered the Po to be bridged at Mezzana Corti for the main army and Valenza for Bellegarde&#x27;s corps. By this time, Bellegarde and 14,500 troops arrived to maintain the siege of Alessandria and contain Moreau. To keep MacDonald from raising the siege of Mantua, Kray manned the north bank of the Po with several thousand troops.

On 16 June at 10:00 am, MacDonald&#x27;s vanguard arrived near Piacenza and began pressing Ott&#x27;s command. Suvorov reiterated his orders for Ott to make a fighting retreat to the Stradella defile. By this time Austrian military engineer Albert Johann de Best got the Piacenza citadel into a defensible state after eight days of work; two or three companies of the &quot;Fröhlich&quot; Regiment were assigned to garrison it. Victor&#x27;s division led the French attack on Ott as Rusca&#x27;s soldiers edged toward the south as if to flank the Austrians out of position. That night, Suvorov&#x27;s chief of staff Johann Gabriel Chasteler de Courcelles rushed toward Ott&#x27;s position with 100 dragoons of the &quot;Karaczay&quot; Regiment plus a half-battery of horse artillery. Following behind was an improvised force including the &quot;Wouwermanns&quot; Grenadier Battalion, three battalions of the &quot;Fröhlich&quot; Regiment, the remainder of the &quot;Karaczay&quot; Regiment and one and one-half batteries of horse artillery. If Ott could hold out along the Tidone River, it would allow ample space for the Austro-Russian army to deploy between the Po and the mountain spurs to the south. If Ott were forced back into the narrow Stradella position, it would be difficult for the Allies to form a line of battle and might even cause a rout.

==Forces==
===Allied Army===
The Austro-Russian army commanded by Field Marshal Suvorov was organized by him into three columns on 18 June. General Rosenberg led the mostly Russian First and Second Columns while General der Kavallerie Melas directed the mostly Austrian Third Column. The Austrian forces numbered 9,851 foot and 4,586 horse while the Russians counted 16,219 infantry and 2,000 Cossacks. These numbers amounted to 32,656 and did not include artillerymen. The figures in brackets represent Austrian casualties. The First Column on the right was headed by an Advance Guard under Major General Pyotr Bagration which included the &quot;Dendrygin&quot;, &quot;Kalemin&quot;, &quot;Lomonosov&quot; and &quot;Sanaev&quot; Combined Grenadier Battalions, two battalions of the &quot;Bagration&quot; Jäger Regiment, &quot;Grekov&quot; and &quot;Posdeev&quot; Cossack Regiments and six squadrons of the Austrian &quot;Karaczay&quot; Dragoon Regiment Nr. 4 [62]. Lieutenant General Yakov Ivanovich Povalo-Schveikovsky led an infantry division consisting of two battalions of the &quot;Rosenberg&quot; Grenadier Regiment, one battalion each of the &quot;Dalheim&quot; and &quot;Schveikovsky&quot; Musketeer Regiments and six squadrons of the Austrian &quot;Lobkowitz&quot; Dragoon Regiment Nr. 10 [107].

Rosenberg personally accompanied the Second Column in the center. The division commander was Lieutenant General Förster and his infantry was made up of two battalions each of the &quot;Miloradovich&quot; and &quot;Tyrtov&quot; Musketeer Regiments and one battalion each of the &quot;Baranovsky&quot;, &quot;Förster&quot; and &quot;Jung-Baden&quot; Musketeer Regiments. The cavalry contingent was formed from the &quot;Molchanov&quot; Cossack Regiment and six squadrons of the Austrian &quot;Levenehr&quot; Dragoon Regiment Nr. 14 [76].

The Third Column under General der Kavallerie Melas was made up of a division under Feldmarschall-Leutnant Ott and a reserve under Feldmarschall-Leutnant Michael von Fröhlich with attached artillery [64]. Ott&#x27;s division included four battalions of the &quot;Nádasdy&quot; Nr. 39 [565] and two battalions of the &quot;Mittrowsky&quot; Nr. 40 [198] Infantry Regiments, the &quot;Mihanovich&quot; Serbian Free Battalion [260], the 6th Battalion of the &quot;Banater&quot; Grenz Infantry Regiment [115], six companies of the &quot;d&#x27;Aspré&quot; Jäger Battalion, the &quot;Semernikov&quot; Cossack Regiment (&quot;Semernikov&quot; and &quot;Molchanov&quot; Cossacks were led by Major-General Andrei Ivanovich Gorchakov) and six squadrons of the &quot;Archduke Joseph&quot; Hussar Regiment Nr. 2 [152]. Fröhlich&#x27;s reserve consisted of the &quot;Morzin&quot; [29], &quot;Paar&quot; [109], &quot;Pertusi&quot; [106], &quot;Schiaffinatti&quot; [37], &quot;Weber&quot; [62] and &quot;Wouwermanns&quot; [102] Grenadier Battalions. A second source stated that there were 17,000 Russians and 20,000 Austrians present and added three battalions of the &quot;Fröhlich&quot; Nr. 28 Infantry Regiment, six squadrons of the &quot;Württemberg&quot; Dragoon Regiment Nr. 8 [2] and listed seven rather than six Austrian grenadier battalions. This source also named as brigade commanders, Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein for the grenadiers, Ferdinand Johann von Morzin for the &quot;Nádasdy&quot;, &quot;Mittrowsky&quot; and &quot;Württemberg&quot; Regiments and Friedrich Heinrich von Gottesheim for the &quot;d&#x27;Aspré&quot;, &quot;Mihanovich&quot;, &quot;Banater&quot; and &quot;Archduke Joseph&quot; units.

===French Army===
In MacDonald&#x27;s &quot;Army of Naples&quot; Chef de brigade Victor Léopold Berthier served as chief of staff, Chef de bataillon Jacques Bardenet as chief of artillery and Jean-Louis Dubreton as commissary officer. In the 8 June order of battle that follows, the figures in parentheses are unit strengths. The Advanced Guard was led by General of Brigade Jean-Baptiste Salme and included the 11th Line (1,390), 12th Line (1,250) and 15th Light (1,340) Infantry Demi-Brigades, a detachment of the 25th Chasseurs à Cheval Regiment (85), the 6th Company of the 8th Foot Artillery Regiment (34) and the 3rd Company of the 1st Sapper Battalion (29). The 1st Division was commanded by General of Division Olivier and consisted of the 30th Line (1,508) and 73rd Line (2,009) Infantry Demi-Brigades, 7th Chasseurs à Cheval (321) and 19th Chasseurs à Cheval (314) Regiments and gunners and sappers (311). The 2nd Division was directed by General of Division Rusca and comprised the 17th Light (1,880), 55th Line (886) and 97th Line (1,760) Infantry Demi-Brigades, 16th Dragoon (488) and 19th Dragoon (330) Regiments and artillerists and sappers (116).

The 3rd Division was supervised by General of Division Montrichard and was made up of the 3rd (or 2nd) Line (730), 21st Line (1,000), 68th Line (900) and 5th Light (1,900) Infantry Demi-Brigades, 1st Cavalry (263), 12th Dragoon (400), 11th Hussar (250), Cisalpine Dragoon (100) and Cisalpine Hussar (308) Regiments and gunners and sappers (112). The 4th Division was commanded by General of Division Watrin and consisted of the 62nd Line (3,420) and 78th Light (2,120) Infantry Demi-Brigade, 25th Chasseurs à Cheval Regiment (260) and artillerists (33). The 5th Division was directed by General of Division Dombrowski and comprised the 1st Polish Legion (2,000), 8th Light Infantry Demi-Brigade (893) and Polish Cavalry (500).

The remaining infantry division was led by General of Division Victor and included the 5th Line (1,300), 39th Line (1,225), 92nd Line (1,240), 93rd Line (1,265) and 99th Line (1,320) Infantry Demi-Brigades and 15th Chasseurs à Cheval Regiment (400). There were also 526 men assigned to the artillery park. A second authority placed the 12th Line in Olivier&#x27;s division rather than Salme&#x27;s Advanced Guard, specified that the 17th in Rusca&#x27;s division was Light Infantry, put the 2nd Line instead of the 3rd Line in Montrichard&#x27;s division and listed different unit totals in some divisions. This second source gave the following division strengths for the end of May: Salme 2,997, Olivier 5,826, Rusca 5,397, Montrichard 5,773, Watrin 4,880, Dombrowski 3,555 and Victor 6,750. This yielded a strength of 30,980 infantry, 3,616 cavalry and 1,088 artillerymen and sappers for a 35,684 grand total. From this, losses from the Battle of Modena and other causes must be deducted.

==Battle==

===Tidone River - 17 June===
The Tidone River runs north into the Po west of Piacenza. With steep banks 2 to 3 metres high and a width of about , the stream has some defensive value. Like the Tidone, the bed of the Trebbia is filled with white stones. On 17 June at 8:00 am the French opened their attack against Ott&#x27;s positions behind the Tidone. On hand were a total of 18,700 soldiers including Salme&#x27;s Advance Guard. The French divisions were deployed with Victor on the right, Rusca in the center and Dombrowski on the left. Because of the wounds he sustained at Modena, MacDonald was bedridden in the village of Borgo San Antonio to the west of Piacenza. As senior officer Victor should have assumed tactical control of the fight, but he stayed in Piacenza, resulting in poor coordination of the French effort. Nevertheless, the determined initial assault ousted the &quot;d&#x27;Aspré&quot; Jägers from their west-bank positions in the hamlets of Agazzino, Pontetidone and Veratto di Sopra. As Dombrowski&#x27;s troops mounted a flank attack to the south, the troops of Victor&#x27;s division fought their way to the village of Sarmato where they were held up by an Austrian artillery battery and two battalions of the &quot;Nádasdy&quot; Regiment. Chasteler was with Ott when the French attack started. He urged Ott to hold as long as possible and went back to find that his task force was hurrying on its way. At 1:00 pm Chasteler&#x27;s men arrived and were thrown into the fight. Nevertheless, at 3:00 pm the French overran both Sarmato and its defending battery, forcing Ott&#x27;s troops back to a position in front of Castel San Giovanni.

Soon afterward Melas arrived with three battalions of Austrians foot and some squadrons of the &quot;Archduke Joseph&quot; Hussars. Suvorov inspired the Russian columns by suddenly appearing at odd places along the line of march. If inspiration failed, Cossacks were employed to prod stragglers back into line. Chasteler&#x27;s units hustled off to the south to block a turning movement by Dombrowski&#x27;s division. The &quot;Bagration&quot; Jäger Regiment veered off to the north while the four Russian combined grenadier battalions were committed to battle near Castel San Giovanni. Bagration approached Suvorov and half-voiced asked for permission to delay until at least some of the stragglers arrive, because the companies do not number even 40 men. Suvorov answered him quietly in his ear: &quot;and MacDonald has not even 20 men; attack with God&quot;. Despite the odds turning against them, the French continued to mount spirited attacks. Gradually the Allies massed in two battle lines in front of Castel San Giovanni. Ott had held on with the help of Chasteler, and then the arrival of Melas, Suvorov and Bagration in very rapid succession built up the allies to a decisively superior 30,656 Austrians and Russians in regular troops alone (this is the overall numbers). Field Marshal Suvorov&#x27;s orders for the forthcoming attack had in mind first of all to concentrate as large a force as possible; for this purpose officers were sent back to gather and bring the rest during the forced march on 17 June; orders were sent to Major General Nikolay Chubarov that he should hurry to join the army; besides, support from Kray was expected. However, neither Chubarov (he arrived on the 19th with 1,300 men) nor reinforcements from Kray arrived on that day, and the troops were reinforced only by stragglers, who were pulled up throughout the 18th of June and went straight from the march into the fray.

Finally, the Allies recaptured Sarmato and the abandoned Austrian cannons, compelling the French to retreat. The French fell back stubbornly, taking advantage of plentiful cover to repulse Austrian cavalry charges. Salme&#x27;s Advanced Guard covered the last stages of the withdrawal, forming square at Ca&#x27; del Bosco on the northern part of the battlefield. The shooting ended by 9:00 pm. The French suffered losses of about 1,000 killed and wounded plus 1,200 more captured. Allied casualties are not given. Based on the results of 17 June, with up to 15,000 men Suvorov decisively rushed on 18,000 French, given the reinforcements that had arrived, and forced them to retreat.

===Trebbia River - 18 June===

The Allied army had a total of 32⅔ battalions, 24 squadrons and 4 Cossack regiments. Each division was ordered to build in combat order in two lines, 300 paces distance; each cavalry regiment — in the &quot;divizion&quot; way, having in the first line of two &quot;divizions&quot;, and in the second — one. The password and the slogan for June 18 were appointed &quot;Theresia&quot; and &quot;Kolin&quot;, because the battle fell on the anniversary of the Austrian victory over Frederick the Great at Kolin in 1757. Such a reminder might have been encouraging to the Austrians.

Unexpectedly confronted by a large Austro-Russian army, MacDonald was in a dilemma. He believed that his 22,000 available soldiers were outnumbered and ought to retreat, but he anticipated that Moreau might soon arrive to pitch into the Allied rear. So he hoped to hold out until his last divisions could arrive on the field. MacDonald was also aware of the presence of a force under Jean François Cornu de La Poype that was in position to threaten the Allied south flank. On the 18th, Veletsky&#x27;s detached force surprised La Poype&#x27;s 1,500 French and 2,000 Genoese at Bobbio, sending them fleeing back to Genoa. On morning of 18 June the injured MacDonald inspected his army. He found his men ready to fight and the enemy inactive. Meanwhile, Suvorov and Chasteler planned to throw three columns at the French, with the main strength on the right to break down MacDonald&#x27;s flank by advancing from the Tidone to the Trebbia and finally all the way to the Nure River, the next river to the east. With luck, the French would be driven back against the Po. The First Column on the right was headed by Bagration&#x27;s Advance Guard followed by Schveikovsky&#x27;s division. The Second Column in the center was made up of Förster&#x27;s division. The Third Column included the divisions of Ott and Fröhlich. Ott was ordered to drive straight ahead to the Trebbia supported by his colleague. At some point Fröhlich&#x27;s grenadiers were supposed to reinforce the right flank in order to give more weight to its attack.

Suvorov&#x27;s desire to start the attack at 7:00 am proved to be impractical due to the Allied soldiers&#x27; exhaustion, so it was put off until 11:00 am. Scouts reported that the French were defending behind the Trebbia with advanced positions near the villages of San Nicolò a Trebbia, Mamago Sotto Svizzera, Gragnano Trebbiense and Casaliggio, from north to south. Bagration&#x27;s Advance Guard forded the Tidone and attacked Dombrowski&#x27;s &quot;Polish Legion&quot; south of Casaliggio at 2:00 pm, achieving some surprise. Coming from the south, a Polish battalion threatened the Russian rear, but it was quickly hemmed in by Russian infantry, the Austrian &quot;Karaczay&quot; Dragoons, and Cossacks; 230 men were forced to lay down their arms. An alert French staff officer, Pierre Edmé Gautherin brought the divisions of Rusca and Victor to the west bank of the Trebbia where they stopped and drove back Bagration&#x27;s troops. Rosenberg brought Schveikovsky&#x27;s reserve division into the fight while Suvorov personally rallied the shaken Russian infantry. &quot;Halt!&quot; cried Alexander Vasilyevich Suvorov, and at that instant the line of retreating troops stopped, as a concealed battery spewed cannon shot into the French. They wavered in a state of shock, and stood for a while as the cannon shot, shells and canister from the hidden battery coursed through them. &quot;Press on! &quot;Stupai, Stupai!&quot; With the bayonet! Hurrah!&quot; continued to yell Suvorov. The Russians presently gained the upper hand and compelled Rusca to pull back to the east bank of the Trebbia, which his men accomplished while maintaining their ranks but hotly pursued by the allied cavalry. The fighting in the center began when the &quot;Levenehr&quot; Dragoons and &quot;Molchanov&quot; Cossacks clashed with some French horsemen and drove them back. Starting at 5:00 pm, Förster slowly pressed back the right wing of Victor&#x27;s division. 2 companies of Tyrtov&#x27;s regiment knocked several hundred French infantry of Rusca&#x27;s division out of Gragnano. As the advanced French troops were pushed out of this village, part of Monrichard&#x27;s division went forward to support them. Förster then put all his troops into action, leaving only one battalion in reserve, and attacked the opponent on the left bank of the Trebbia; seeing his flank exposed, Monrichard was forced to retreat. Thus, the French finally evacuated Gragnano and fell back across the Trebbia.

Salme&#x27;s Advanced Guard, which was posted near Sant&#x27; Imento north of the highway, was unchallenged most of the day. At about 2:30 pm, the divisions of Montrichard and Olivier crossed the Trebbia and marched to Salme&#x27;s support. Seeing these French reinforcements in his front, Melas decided not to release Fröhlich&#x27;s division instead of helping the right flank as he was supposed to. In general, during the two-day fighting at the Trebbia, Melas showed delay and indecision, or even half-heartedly carried out Suvorov&#x27;s orders to put units into battle, which threatened the troops with a possible French breakthrough, including the decision not to bring Fröhlich into the battle. If Suvorov was not on the right flank (8,5 km from Melas), but, for example, at the middle column, he would have been able to understand Melas&#x27; behaviour in time and force him to do his will; but because of the right flank&#x27;s importance, where the fate of the battle was decided, Suvorov had to be there. The Third Column commander sent Ott forward at 6:00 pm and the Austrians easily brushed aside Salme&#x27;s outnumbered unit. Together, Ott and Fröhlich pushed Montrichard and Olivier back beyond the Trebbia by evening. That night in a bizarre operation, Rosenberg took two Russian grenadier battalions across the Trebbia south of Gossolengo. They somehow penetrated the French lines as far as Settima where they routed a French detachment and liberated some prisoners. At 3:00 am, Rosenberg&#x27;s expedition headed back to the west bank, again without arousing any French sentries. Four squadrons of the &quot;Karaczay&quot; Dragoons mounted a similar expedition but were detected and driven off by musketry. Both groups missed the pointless battle that occurred earlier in the evening. Hearing what they believed to be Moreau&#x27;s artillery, three French battalions mounted an extemporaneous attack at 9:30 pm, surprising an Austrian battalion. Melas called up reinforcements from his own and Förster&#x27;s divisions while Prince Liechtenstein charged into the fray with the &quot;Lobkowitz&quot; Dragoons. The artillery of both sides opened up on the melee, causing many friendly fire casualties. After strenuous efforts, the leaders of both sides managed to wind down the senseless fighting by 11:00 pm. The total allied force in the combat of 18 June, if the casualties of 17 June are roughly deducted, was around 22,000, which is equal to the French forces.

===Trebbia River - 19 June===
Chasteler sent orders for the Allied army to begin the assault at 6:00 am on 19 June. However, the plan was not delivered to Melas until 11:00 am. In the meantime, Melas noticed the presence of strong enemy forces at the north end of the battleline and sent 12 artillery pieces to the west bank of the Trebbia to blast the French positions. Two French battalions crept forward to deal with the threat, but they were discovered and driven off by the murderously effective fire of two masked cannons. Also during the morning, the French set up a battery of 10 to 12 guns and began to hammer Förster&#x27;s positions. This was apparently to cover a shift to the south by a body of French troops. The delay also affected the Russian forces and Suvorov began issuing orders at 11:00 am. Meanwhile, MacDonald determined to launch an assault, putting his faith in the French soldier&#x27;s enthusiasm for the attack and his troops&#x27; good morale. He still believed his army was outnumbered but he hoped to preempt an Allied assault. In the south Rusca and Victor were directed to attack side-by-side near Casaliggio, supported by an outflanking move by Dombrowski via Rivalta. Montrichard was ordered to cross the Trebbia near Gragnano in the center while Olivier was instructed to crack the Allied line farther north near San Nicolò. On the extreme right flank, Watrin and Salme were told to seize Calendasco and turn the Allied left flank.

Chasteler spotted Dombrowski&#x27;s outflanking column and directed Bagration&#x27;s troops against it. Dombrowski&#x27;s division seized Rivalta and advanced up the Trebbia&#x27;s west bank as far as the hamlet of Canetto before they ran into the Russians. Accompanied in person by Suvorov, the Russians defeated their mostly Polish opponents, who suffered serious losses. Suvorov&#x27;s troops forced them to retreat to the east bank. Rusca&#x27;s initial advance was blunted by the fire of 14 artillery pieces belonging to Schveikovsky&#x27;s division. Farther north, Victor&#x27;s division was repulsed by a combination of Schveikovsky&#x27;s left wing and Förster&#x27;s division and withdrew to the French-held east bank. But with Bagration&#x27;s forces pulled to the south by Dombrowski&#x27;s ill-fated attack, Rusca&#x27;s men found a gap in the Allied line south of Casaliggio. The French infantry charged across the Trebbia while a horse artillery battery mauled the &quot;Rosenberg&quot; Grenadier Regiment. Suvorov appeared on the scene to rally his Russians. Rosenberg swung the left wing of Schveikovsky&#x27;s division to face the northern edge of Rusca&#x27;s breakthrough while Bagration hurried north to hit the southern edge. At the same time, Chasteler borrowed four battalions from Förster and brought them to the scene. The combined attack forced Rusca&#x27;s division to retire to the east bank. The Russians tried to follow up their success but Rusca&#x27;s men repelled their attacks and the fighting in the south ended around 7:00 pm.

The assault in the center was delayed because of the tardy arrival of Montrichard&#x27;s division. Its 5th Light Infantry crossed the river and deployed into line but was hit by a devastating volley from an Austrian grenadier battalion. Montrichard&#x27;s other units advanced in columns which were out of touch with each other. When Fröhlich&#x27;s grenadiers and Förster&#x27;s division counterattacked, Montrichard&#x27;s division dissolved and its soldiers took to their heels. The grenadier battalion was swamped by fleeing Frenchmen, but it managed to keep its cohesion until some Russian infantry cut their way through to the rescue. Olivier&#x27;s assault was preceded by a lightning cavalry charge around noon that swept the west bank clear of Austrians. The infantry crossed in the cavalry&#x27;s wake and soon captured San Nicolò and two guns. Hearing cannon fire, Liechtenstein went forward to check on the situation and found a crowd of Austrian troops running away from Olivier&#x27;s assault. He immediately went back to his command and led two squadrons each of the &quot;Lobkowitz&quot; and &quot;Levenehr&quot; Dragoons and one squadron of the &quot;Archduke Joseph&quot; Hussars against Olivier&#x27;s south flank. Having disposed of Montrichard&#x27;s division earlier, the Allies were free to mass against Olivier&#x27;s division and eventually throw it back to the Trebbia&#x27;s east bank. The &quot;Wouwermanns&quot; Grenadier Battalion recaptured two Austrian 12-pound cannons.

Around the same time that Olivier made his attack, Salme&#x27;s Advanced Guard and Watrin&#x27;s division, which had previously been in reserve, crossed the Trebbia on the far right flank. Moving in two bodies, the French force brushed aside the Austrian outpost line. The right thrust reached Ca&#x27; Pernici on the Po&#x27;s south bank while the left thrust carried almost to Calendasco. Here Watrin paused because the noises from Olivier&#x27;s fight were not encouraging. By this time, Melas had Olivier on the run and wished to attack across the Trebbia. Hearing of the Watrin-Salme incursion, the Austrian general was forced to deal with it first. Melas sent Liechtenstein with a task force composed of one squadron of the &quot;Lobkowitz&quot; Dragoons, two squadrons of the &quot;Archduke Joseph&quot; Hussars, 200 Cossacks and nine companies of infantry. Liechtenstein acted with selfless bravery – 4 horses were killed under him. Meanwhile, an artillery battery detached from the Mantua siege corps under the command of Colonel Kinsky unlimbered on the north bank of the Po. The Austrian guns proceeded to bombard their enemies, encouraging them in their decision to recross the Trebbia though the Austrians made prisoners of 300 French. The firing ended in the northern sector about 9:00 pm. The French maintained a firm grip on the west bank of the Trebbia, but MacDonald&#x27;s division commanders were not able to give him any estimate of their remaining strength. In a scene of horror, thousands of dead and wounded soldiers littered the bed of the Trebbia while Piacenza&#x27;s Austrian garrison blindly fired cannons into the night. Realizing that neither Moreau nor La Poype were coming to his assistance, MacDonald issued the orders to retreat at 10:00 pm. As soon as the engineers bridged the Nure River, the artillery and wagon train were sent across, followed by the infantry starting about midnight. On 19 June with 22,000 Suvorov beat 33,000 of MacDonald.

During all 3 days, the 70-year-old commander almost did not leave his horse, showed the most vigorous activity; at night he gave dispositions and other orders, and therefore was in dire need of rest—he could hardly keep on his feet; and, in spite of this, the Field Marshal cheerfully congratulated the assembled generals for the evening &quot;of their third victory&quot; and said: &quot;Tomorrow we will give a fourth lesson to MacDonald&quot;. By 5 am orders were given to be ready for another attack.

===Nure River - 20 June===
Suvorov determined to finish with the French so he ordered a new attack at 4:00 am on 20 June. When the Allied forces reached the west bank they found MacDonald&#x27;s army gone. MacDonald abandoned 7,183 wounded men in Piacenza at the mercy of the allies; — as per Suvorov&#x27;s earlier letter, 4,000. The French General of Division Alexis Aimé Pierre Cambray was mortally wounded during the battle and died 2 July, General of Division Dombrowski of the Polish Legion was also wounded; Allied commanders Lieutenant General Povalo-Schveikovsky and Major General Bagration were wounded as well. The Austrians advanced into Piacenza where they found the wounded generals Olivier, Rusca and Salme along with the other non-transportable French wounded. Melas secured the town with Fröhlich&#x27;s division while launching Ott to support the pursuit.

The chase was headed by the &quot;Karaczay&quot; Dragoons and one battery of horse artillery. They made excellent progress until were held up farther south at San Giorgio Piacentino behind the Nure River by a substantial French rearguard, which was headed by Victor. This force comprised cavalry, some infantry, and a number of guns that were performed well; they repulsed the Austrian dragoons and 2 pieces of the horse artillery. Bagration then came up with the main body of the advance guard (under the command of Chubarov) and Chasteler deployed it for a set-piece attack on San Giorgio. The jäger regiment of Bagration on the upper Nure to the right, the jäger regiment of Miller out to the left towards San Paolo, and the four battalions of grenadiers in four lines against San Giorgio in the center. Chasteler has scarcely issued the necessary orders when Suvorov appeared at the head of the Schveikovsky&#x27;s and Förster&#x27;s divisions (which had united at Gossolengo), and ordered the attack to proceed. Intense musketry by 17th Light Demi-Brigade, the old Auvergne Regiment, held off the &quot;Bagration&quot; and &quot;Miller&quot; Jägers on the flanks but the combined grenadiers won a foothold in San Giorgio, and then with the help of the Russian main force they cleared the entire village. A total of 1,099 surviving French soldiers and officers surrendered along with four guns, two howitzers, and three colors. At this point any French resistance came to an end, the big four-day battle was over. The French retreated hastily. Following an unexpected fight on 20 June, Russian advance troops pursued the French almost all night long all the way to Castello di Montanaro. Over to the left the Austrian division of Ott advanced by way of San Lazzaro and Montale, but it encountered a whole French division deployed on the right bank of the Ponte Nure in front of Nure, and was held at bay until the French broke contact. Suvorov doubled his energy, all day was on horseback and only with the onset of night stopped together with the Grand Duke Constantine. Suvorov, neglecting his military theory, came to the conviction that no more could be demanded and resolved to give the men a rest. MacDonald&#x27;s intercepted letter to Moreau and Victor&#x27;s repulsed correspondence convinced him that the damage done to the French was too great to be soon repaired. &quot;MacDonald is more than defeated,&quot; he wrote to Kray.

The battle at the Trebbia took place on the very places where, in 218 B.C., Hannibal had defeated the Romans. Suvorov was very proud of this coincidence, talked about it with enthusiasm and turned to an Austrian general with a question, why Hannibal did not go from the Trebbia directly to Rome. The latter replied that there was probably also a Hofkriegsrat in Carthage. The joke must have pleased Suvorov, as Petrushevsky notes.

==Result==
===Casualties===
The &quot;Army of Naples&quot; withdrew southeast toward Parma where 200 wounded soldiers were abandoned. The French losses may have been over 16,000 when the killed, transportable wounded (that were smaller in number than the untransportable ones), prisoners, including captured wounded, and missing were counted. The Russians reported 681 killed and 2,073 wounded for a total of 2,754 while the Austrians admitted losing 254 killed, 1,903 wounded and 500 missing for a total of 2,657. Historian Christopher Duffy rounded these figures up to 6,000 Allied casualties. He assumed French casualties at 12,000 based on the &quot;only verifiable&quot; figure of 7,183 wounded prisoners in Piacenza, but these figures do not include casualties on 20 June and contain only killed, wounded, and missing. When added up with the previously quoted captured in the combat of 20 June (the sole survivors of the 17th Demi-Brigade), the result is 13,099. Gaston Bodart in his statistics listed 5,500 Allied casualties including 1,000 killed, 4,000 wounded, and 500 captured; and 16,500 French casualties: 2,000 killed, 7,500 wounded (most of them became prisoners on 20 June) plus 7,000 men captured or missing (these 7,000 do not contain wounded prisoners in Piacenza); seven guns and eight colors were lost. Digby Smith reported similar Allied and French losses, he too included three Russian generals wounded. From a total of 33,000 French, he estimated losses as 2,000 died, 7,500 injured, and 7,000 prisoners. In the 2nd edition of his book, Suvorov&#x27;s biographer Alexander Petrushevsky estimated total Allied casualties at 5,500–6,000; the French casualties at 15,000 and noted that it is the minimal loss. In proportion to the wounded, the number of dead could not be less than 2,000–3,000 (the first edition stated 2,500–3,000), more than 12,500 wounded or captured (12,268 captured in all according to the most recent letter of Suvorov), thereof more than 7,500 captured wounded and sick in Piacenza. He also said that highest number of allies who fought did not exceed 30,000 during the first three days (the first edition said the number was under 30,000). David Eggenberger wrote about 4,000 killed and 12,000 wounded, captured, missing among 35,000 French, and 6,000 casualties among the Russo-Austrian allies. Lyon Blease stated that the French had lost about 17,000 men, including 12,000 prisoners in all and 7,500 prisoners at Piacenza and 1,700 Polish legionaries out of 2,000; the total Allied loss could not have exceeded 6,000. Gunther E. Rothenberg gave Allied losses as 5,000 killed or wounded and 500 captured out of 20,000 Russians and 17,000 Austrians. He stated French losses as 9,500 killed or wounded and 7,000 captured out of 33,000. N. A. Orlov wrote of 16–18,000 French losses with 4–6,000 killed; the rest were prisoners or abandoned wounded in the Piacenza hospital. The Russians and Austrians lost up to 5,425 men dead, injured, and missing in action. In the 4th edition of their book, R. Ernest Dupuy and Trevor N. Dupuy revised the losses to 11,500 French casualties between June 17 and 19 (the first edition stated 10,000), as well as 5,500 Allied losses (the first edition stated 7,000), and asserted that 5,000 French were casualties en route (while MacDonald was trying to connect with Moreau in Genoa), — but it is not clear whether this includes Frenchmen from Piacenza. Spencer C. Tucker gave the same number of 11,500 losses of the French, but even from 17 to 18 June, excluding the combat of 19 June and the combat of the Nure, and also indicated an additional loss of 5,000 MacDonald&#x27;s forces when he tried to link up with Moreau&#x27;s army. Tucker put 5,500 allied casualties. Micheal Clodfelter noted 1,600 French killed and 7,685 wounded, 9,285 in total, and also an additional loss of 5,000 men after 19 June with no indication of prisoners or missing; 14,285 as the French total. Russian losses are indicated at 680 killed, 722 wounded, and he estimated Austrian losses at 254 killed, 1,903 wounded, 500 missing. Total Allied loss: 4,059 men.

By June 22, out of 35,000 French, barely 10,000 to 12,000 men remained in their positions, completely demoralized. MacDonald had lost 23–25,000 of his 35,000 troops, i.e. two-thirds (these losses also consist of deserters and stragglers). Duffy notes that when MacDonald linked up with Moreau&#x27;s 12,000-strong army, their combined force was scarcely 24–25,000 men. Altogether, up to 60 guns were abandoned by the French during this withdrawal. Suvorov, meanwhile, received the victory title of Prince Italiysky for his victory at the Trebbia. The old Field Marshal taught:
&quot;Pursue day and night, until he be destroyed.&quot;

===Further steps===

The Allies persued the French until 21 June, reaching Fiorenzuola where they rested the next day. Suvorov determined from captured dispatches that MacDonald&#x27;s mangled army was no longer a threat to northern Italy and marched the Allied army back west on the 23rd, hoping to catch Moreau between himself and Bellegarde. Ott with 7,000 foot, 2,000 horse and 15 guns continued the pursuit, keeping an eye on the French army. MacDonald, scattering his forces once again, ordered Montrichard&#x27;s division to the east where it was used to form some garrisons which were subsequently captured. One battalion of &quot;Warasdiner&quot; Grenz and one squadron of the &quot;Bussy&quot; Mounted Jägers tried to block MacDonald&#x27;s retreat but were crushed on 24 June at Sassuolo south of Modena. 

By 28 June the &quot;Army of Naples&quot; was back at Pistoia where it stayed for several days before marching to the west coast in early July. The still ailing MacDonald was shipped off to France and replaced in command by Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr. The garrisons in south and central Italy were picked off one-by-one by the Allies. Naples surrendered on 15 June, Fort Elmo in Naples harbor on 11 July, Capua on 28 July, Gaeta on 1 August, Rome on 29 September and Ancona on 13 November 1799. Even the French-held fortresses of northern Italy fell rapidly. Turin capitulated on 20 June, Bologna on 3 July, Fort Urbano on 10 July, Alessandria on 22 July and Mantua on 28 July.

Besides the combat of the Nure, the Second Battle of Marengo (Battle of Cascina Grossa) took place on 20 June, and the next major engagement was the Battle of Novi on 15 August 1799.

<text>The Battle of Turckheim took place during the Franco-Dutch War that occurred on 5 January 1675 at a site between the towns of Colmar and Turckheim in Alsace. The French army, commanded by the Viscount of Turenne, defeated the armies of Austria and Brandenburg, led by Alexander von Bournonville and Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg.

==Prelude==
The aggressive campaign of Louis XIV against the Netherlands, since 1672, had provoked a hostile reaction of other European states like Austria (who controlled the Holy Roman Empire) and Brandenburg. Their intervention had brought the war into the upper Rhine, creating a threat to French territory. In 1674 Marshal Turenne, French commander in that sector, failed to prevent the invasion of Alsace by a part of the Imperial Army. With the arrival of year&#x27;s end in 1674, the Imperials went into their winter quarters in the region of Colmar, a few miles south of the French winter barracks, situated in Haguenau.

According to the conventions of war at the time, the military operations should have been halted during the winter until the return of the spring. Turenne, however, decided not to follow this custom. Using the Vosges mountains as protection, he moved west and then south, reappearing in Belfort, south of his opponent, on 27 December 1674. Finding no resistance, he reached Mulhouse on the 29th. The surprised Imperials hastily fell back on Turckheim.

==Battle==
Turenne and his 30,000 troops found the Imperial Army well positioned with 30,000 to 50,000 men under the command of Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, on the afternoon of 5 January 1675. However, the Imperial forces had not yet gelled completely to be ready for battle. The ensuing battle did not follow the standards of the 17th century. Turenne feigned an attack from the center and then another from his right. With Imperial attention focused on these two parts of the front, Turenne led a third of his army on a march around to his left flank. This movement skirted the mountains and was hidden from view of the enemy because of the terrain. Turenne captured the small village of Turckheim. Frederick William attempted to retake the town, but he was defeated by heavy fire from French guns and an infantry charge. Turenne then fell on the extreme right of the enemy. The speed of the attack (which was not preceded by artillery fire) and the numerical superiority at this spot disrupted and demoralized the defenders, putting them to flight after suffering 3,400 casualties.

==Aftermath==
With their winter quarters now threatened, Frederick William&#x27;s army was forced to leave Alsace, leaving at Colmar 3,000 men sick or wounded, and sought the safety of Strasbourg where the army in the following week crossed the Rhine River, back onto the right bank into present-day Germany.

This brief but famous winter campaign by Marshal Turenne is considered one of the brightest of the 17th century. Through two indirect maneuvers (one strategic and one tactical), he had saved France from invasion, suffering only negligible casualties.

<text>The Battle of Vauchamps (14 February 1814) was the final major engagement of the Six Days Campaign of the War of the Sixth Coalition. It resulted in a part of the under Napoleon I defeating a superior Prussian and Russian force of the Army of Silesia under Field-marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher.

At the beginning of 1814, the armies of the French Empire, under the direct command of Emperor Napoleon I, were scrambling to defend Eastern France against the invading Coalition Armies. Despite fighting against vastly superior forces, Napoleon managed to score a few significant victories and, between 10 and 13 February repeatedly beat Blücher&#x27;s Army of Silesia. On 13 February, reeling from his successive defeats, Blücher looked to disengage from Napoleon and instead manoeuvre with a part of his forces to fall upon the isolated VI Corps of Marshal Auguste de Marmont, who was defending Napoleon&#x27;s rear. The Prussian commander attacked and pushed back Marmont late on 13 February. Nevertheless, the Emperor had read into his enemy&#x27;s intentions and directed powerful forces to support Marmont.

On the morning of 14 February, Blücher, commanding a Prussian Corps and elements of two Russian Corps, resumed his attack against Marmont. The latter continued to fall back until he was reinforced. Napoleon arrived on the battlefield with strong combined-arms forces, which allowed the French to launch a determined counterattack and drive back the leading elements of the Army of Silesia. Blücher realized that he was facing the Emperor in person and decided to pull back and avoid another battle against Napoleon. In practice, Blücher&#x27;s attempt to disengage proved extremely difficult to execute, as the Coalition force was by now in an advanced position, had virtually no cavalry present to cover its retreat and was facing an enemy who was ready to commit its numerous cavalry.

While the actual pitched battle was short, the French infantry, under Marshal Marmont, and most of all the cavalry, under General Emmanuel de Grouchy, launched a relentless pursuit that rode down the enemy. Retreating in slow-moving square formations in broad daylight and along some excellent cavalry terrain, the Coalition forces suffered very heavy losses, with several squares broken by the French cavalry. At nightfall, combat ceased and Blücher opted for an exhausting night march in order to take his remaining forces to safety.

==Context==
On 13 February, having fought three successful actions in three days against the Prussian and Russian army at Champaubert, Montmirail and Château-Thierry, Napoleon was pursuing the defeated enemy. After his consecutive defeats, Field-marshal Blücher decided to disengage from Napoleon and move a significant force against the isolated French Army Corps of Marshal Marmont, at Étoges. Blücher knew that Marmont&#x27;s Corps was weak and his plan was to destroy it and thus fall upon the rear of Napoleon&#x27;s main force.

Still in pursuit of the debris of the enemy force, late on 13 February, Napoleon received reports that Marmont&#x27;s Corps had been attacked and pushed out of his position at Étoges. The Emperor deduced that the enemy force before him would have to be a much reduced one and promptly decided to go to Marmont&#x27;s aid. The Emperor left Château-Thierry on 14 February, towards 3 o&#x27;clock in the morning, leaving a small portion of his forces with Marshal Édouard Mortier, duc de Trévise, with orders to continue the pursuit of the enemy. Taking with him the cavalry of the Guard and Grouchy&#x27;s Cavalry Reserve, Napoleon headed for the village of Vauchamps.

Meanwhile, late on 13 February, having successfully regrouped what forces he could muster at Bergères-lès-Vertus, Blücher had launched an attack against Marmont&#x27;s single division, pushing him out of Étoges and advancing as planned towards Champaubert and Fromentières, in the rear of Napoleon&#x27;s force. However, having read Blücher&#x27;s intentions, Napoleon had given orders for a concentration of French forces in that very sector.

==Opposing forces==
===Army of Silesia===
During the battle of Vauchamps on 14 February, Prussian Field-Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, commander of the combined Prusso-Russian Army of Silesia could count on 20,000 to 21,500 men, from three army corps:

* II (Prussian) Corps, commanded by General Friedrich Graf Kleist von Nollendorf:
** 10th brigade under George Dubislaw Ludwig von Pirch
** 11th brigade under Hans Ernst Karl, Graf von Zieten
** 12th brigade under Prince Augustus of Prussia
** Cavalry brigade under von Hacke
** Cavalry brigade under von Röder
** Reserve artillery under Braun
* IX (Russian) Corps:
** 9th division under Udom II
* X (Russian) Corps under General Peter Mikhailovich Kaptzevich:
** 8th division under Prince Urusov (or Orosov)
** 22nd division under Turchaninov

Kleist&#x27;s II Corps numbered 13,500 men while Kaptzevich&#x27;s X Corps counted 6,500. There were also 1,500 troops from IX Corps who survived the Battle of Champaubert. These were grouped into three or four temporary battalions and an artillery battery. The rump of IX Corps lost 600 men and all of its guns on the evening of 14 February. II Corps had eight 6-pound batteries and two 12-pound batteries. Each battery had eight guns or a total of 80 cannons. There was also a howitzer battery of unknown strength, with X Corps having three batteries attached.


Napoleon had sent orders for a major concentration of forces, which resulted in a force of some 25,000 men being assembled in this sector. However, of these men, only 19,000 soldiers got to the battlefield in time, with no more than 10,000 men engaged in the actual fighting:

* VI Corps, commanded by Marshal of the Empire Auguste de Marmont:
** 3rd Division under Joseph Lagrange
** 8th Division under Étienne Pierre Sylvestre Ricard
** Reinforcements temporarily attached: 7th division under Jean François Leval
* Cavalry, commanded by General Emmanuel de Grouchy:
** Division Antoine Louis Decrest de Saint-Germain
** Division Jean-Pierre Doumerc
** Division Étienne Tardif de Pommeroux de Bordesoulle
* Guard cavalry, commanded by General Étienne de Nansouty:
** 2nd Division under Charles, comte Lefebvre-Desnouettes,
** 3rd Division under Louis Marie Levesque de Laferrière.
* Guard artillery under Antoine Drouot.
* Guard infantry, under Marshal, Prince of the Moskowa Michel Ney (Reinforcements not engaged):
** 1st (Old Guard) division under Louis Friant,
** 2nd (Young Guard) division under Philibert Jean-Baptiste Curial.

Grouchy&#x27;s I Cavalry Corps and II Cavalry Corps, each of two divisions, numbered a combined 3,600 horsemen. The two Guard cavalry divisions together counted 3,300 troopers. The 1st Old Guard Division had 4,000 men and the 2nd Old Guard Division had 3,000. The 1st Young Guard Division was made up of 4,000 soldiers while the 2nd Young Guard Division had 2,500 troops. Marmont&#x27;s two divisions could muster only 3,000 men. Jean François Leval&#x27;s 7th Division comprised 4,500 soldiers. Of these forces, only the cavalry, Marmont&#x27;s infantry and one battalion of the Old Guard were actually engaged in the fighting. The others were marching along behind.

==Battle==
Having begun to push back the feeble French forces from Marmont&#x27;s VI&#x27;s Corps the day before, Blücher occupied Champaubert early on 14 February, sending his vanguard forward, as far as the village of Fromentières and then Vauchamps. Marmont, commanding only the Lagrange division and 800 men from the Ricard division, had cautiously pulled his men back towards Montmirail, where he began to receive reinforcements. Towards 9 o&#x27;clock in the morning, Blücher set Zieten&#x27;s brigade and some cavalry in motion from Vauchamps towards Montmirail. To their surprise, Marmont&#x27;s men didn&#x27;t give ground this time and vigorously counterattacked, pushing Zieten&#x27;s advance guard back into the village of Vauchamps. The accompanying Prussian cavalry was dispersed by a violent French cannonade. With now both brigades of Ricard&#x27;s division available, Marmont launched these men against the Prussian position at Vauchamps, with the 1st brigade on his right, advancing under the cover of the Beaumont forest, south of the Montmirail-Vauchamps road and the 2nd brigade on his left, north of the road, advancing frontally towards the position. Marmont also had with him his own escort cavalry squadron and four &quot;élite&quot; Imperial Guard duty squadrons from the Emperor&#x27;s own escort, under general Lion. Marmont&#x27;s leftmost brigade entered Vauchamps, but, with the village heavily invested with Zieten&#x27;s Prussian defenders, the Frenchmen were soon repulsed, with the Prussians in pursuit. Marshal Marmont then launched his five squadrons to the rescue and the cavalry promptly forced the Prussians back to the village, with one of their battalions taken prisoner, after taking refuge in an isolated farm.

Zieten then decided to pull back his forces towards the village of Fromentières. There, Zieten was joined by Generals Kleist and Kapsevitch, who, having heard the sound of the guns, had begun to move their respective Army Corps in that direction, coming from Champaubert. The French also moved forward, with Marmont&#x27;s two divisions (Lagrange and Ricard) in pursuit of Zieten, along the road to Fromentières. Marmont was now supported on his left by General Grouchy, who had just arrived on the field of battle with the divisions of Saint-Germain and Doumerc, moving past the village of Janvilliers, in order to cut off Zieten&#x27;s retreat. Further French reinforcements were now available, this time on Marmont&#x27;s right: the division of Leval, who had been steadily moving up the valley of the Petit Morin river, in a bid to outflank the Prussians. With the French Imperial Guard artillery now also deployed and firing at them, Zieten&#x27;s Prussians drew back in good order, and formed in squares to fend off Grouchy&#x27;s cavalry. Towards 2 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, after assessing the situation, Blücher realised that he was facing Napoleon himself and thus decided to immediately withdraw. He ordered all of his forces to retreat through Champaubert and directed a part of his artillery to safety, towards Étoges.

==Pursuit==
With the Coalition forces now in full retreat, Marmont received orders to aggressively pursue the enemy, knowing that he could count on his two infantry divisions, plus that of Leval, as well as on the support of General Drouot&#x27;s Guard artillery, on Nansouty&#x27;s Guard cavalry on his right and on Grouchy&#x27;s two cavalry divisions on his left. Following Marmont at a short distance were further reinforcements, two Guard infantry divisions (Friant and Curial) under the command of Marshal Ney and with them was Napoleon himself. Napoleon was followed by an additional &quot;Young Guard&quot; division, under General Meunier, which the Emperor had taken with him when he left Château-Thierry early that morning.

The French cavalry had been hindered in its movements by the broken terrain and thus far unable to really bother Zieten&#x27;s infantry squares. Consequently, Blücher was able to lead an exemplary retreat up to Fromentières and Janvilliers. However, once past these villages, the terrain became flat and even, proper for cavalry action, and now, with the increasingly aggressive action of the enemy cavalry against his flank and rear, Zieten and his brigade became increasingly isolated. Grouchy, with the divisions of Doumerc and Saint-Germain was now boldly menacing Zieten&#x27;s right, while on his left, the Prussian general saw Nansouty&#x27;s Guard cavalry (Laferrière-Levesque&#x27;s division, plus the four service squadrons, under Lefebvre-Desnouettes). Zieten&#x27;s brigade was finally cut off from the rest of the army and charged violently by Grouchy&#x27;s cuirassiers, who broke the infantry squares and took no less than 2,000 prisoners, with the rest of the brigade routed.

Abandoning his position at Fromentières, where Marmont&#x27;s infantry had just begun to irrupt, Blücher ordered the continuation of the retreat towards Champaubert and Étoges, with Kleist&#x27;s Corps on the left, south of the road and Kaptzevitch&#x27;s Corps on the right, north of the road. Again taking advantage from the flat terrain, Grouchy was able to advance rapidly and fall onto the rear of the Coalition infantry squares, which were now slowly withdrawing in echelon and efficiently using the terrain to take shelter from the artillery bombardment. With night approaching and their retreat towards Étoges now barred by enemy cavalry, the Prussian squares began to lose cohesion. Spotting this weakness, Grouchy, who had been reinforced by Bordesoulle&#x27;s division, energetically launched his three divisions against the Coalition squares, dispersing a number of them, with these men fleeing in disorder to take refuge in the Étoges forest. The old Blücher, who had been bravely exposing himself to great danger in order to boost the morale his men, was almost taken prisoner, together with his chief of staff, Gneisenau, Generals Kleist, Kapsevitch and Prince Augustus of Prussia.

Only just escaping capture, Blücher crossed the forest of Vertus and took up positions at Étoges with Prince Urusov&#x27;s division, which had been left there in reserve. Russian General Udom, with 1,800 men and 15 cannon, was instructed to cover the position, by occupying the park at Étoges. Udom&#x27;s men were exhausted after the long retreat and fighting and, seeing that night had fallen, thought themselves in safety. However, Doumerc&#x27;s cuirassiers, formed unseen in the night, surprised these men and a single charge was enough to send the panicked men fleeing. Prince Urusov, 600 men and eight artillery pieces were captured during this action, with the French sailors&#x27; regiment from Lagrange&#x27;s division subsequently entering the village of Étoges. Blücher abandoned this position too and made a hasty retreat towards Vertus and Bergères. He then opted for a speedy night march and the next day he managed to bring his remaining men to Châlons, where he was joined by Yorck&#x27;s and Sacken&#x27;s corps.

==Result==
The battle was actually no more than a very long cavalry pursuit and was a very costly defeat for Blücher&#x27;s &quot;Army of Silesia&quot;, which lost as much as 10,000 men, during this day. French author Jean-Pierre Mir states that the Prussian Corps of Kleist had 3,500 men out of action (killed, wounded and missing), as well as 2,000 prisoners. According to this author, the Russian Corps had around 3,500 men, killed, wounded or missing and also lost 15 cannons and 10 flags. Historian Alain Pigeard places overall losses of the Army of Silesia throughout this day between 9,000 and 10,000 men but the detail of these losses seems to suggest lighter casualties. Pigeard speaks of only 1,250 men killed, wounded or missing and 2,000 prisoners for the Prussians, and of 2,000 men lost for the Russians. Since Pigeard asserts that these casualties occurred during the pursuit, it is possible that these figures do not take into account the casualties incurred during the initial actions of this battle (one battalion of Zieten&#x27;s brigade captured, plus the 2,000 prisoners taken during Grouchy&#x27;s and Nansouty&#x27;s joint action against Zieten). According to Pigeard, the French registered very light casualties of around 600 men.

Military Historian Jacques Garnier, analysing the battle in Jean Tulard&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire Napoléon&quot;, notes that only the muddy, sodden ground, hampering an efficient deployment of the French artillery and infantry, prevented a much more emphatic victory. He also notes that after Vauchamps, Napoleon was able to safely turn south and fall at the Battle of Mormant upon the &quot;Army of Bohemia&quot;, commanded by Prince of Schwarzenberg.

<text>Theodore Huebner Roethke ( ; May 25, 1908 – August 1, 1963) was an American poet. He is regarded as one of the most accomplished and influential poets of his generation, having won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1954 for his book &quot;The Waking&quot;, and the annual National Book Award for Poetry on two occasions: in 1959 for &quot;Words for the Wind&quot;, and posthumously in 1965 for &quot;The Far Field&quot;. His work was characterized by a willingness to engage deeply with a multifaceted introspection, and his style was overtly rhythmic, with a skilful use of natural imagery. Indeed, Roethke&#x27;s mastery of both free verse and fixed forms was complemented by an intense lyrical quality that drew &quot;from the natural world in all its mystery and fierce beauty.&quot;

Roethke was praised by former U.S. Poet Laureate and author James Dickey as &quot;in my opinion the greatest poet this country has yet produced.&quot; He was also a respected poetry teacher, and taught at the University of Washington for fifteen years. His students from that period won two Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry and two others were nominated for the award. &quot;He was probably the best poetry-writing teacher ever,&quot; said poet Richard Hugo, who studied under Roethke.

==Biography==
Roethke was born in Saginaw, Michigan, and grew up on the west side of the Saginaw River. His father, Otto, was a German immigrant, a market-gardener who owned a large local 25-acre greenhouse, along with his brother (Theodore&#x27;s uncle). Much of Theodore&#x27;s childhood was spent in this greenhouse, as reflected by the use of natural images in his poetry. In early 1923 when Roethke was 14 years old, his uncle died by suicide and his father died of cancer. Roethke noted that these events affected him deeply and influenced his work.

Roethke attended the University of Michigan, earning a B.A. &quot;magna cum laude&quot; and Phi Beta Kappa in 1929. He continued on at Michigan to receive an M.A. in English in 1936. He briefly attended the University of Michigan School of Law before resuming his graduate studies at Harvard University, where he studied under the poet Robert Hillyer. Abandoning graduate study because of the Great Depression, he taught English at several universities, including Michigan State University, Lafayette College, Pennsylvania State University, and Bennington College.

In 1940, he was expelled from his position at Lafayette and he returned to Michigan. Prior to his return, he had an affair with established poet and critic Louise Bogan, one of his strongest early supporters. While teaching at Michigan State University in East Lansing, he began to suffer from manic depression, which fueled his poetic impetus. His last teaching position was at the University of Washington, leading to an association with the poets of the American Northwest.

Some of his best known students included James Wright, Carolyn Kizer, Tess Gallagher, Jack Gilbert, Richard Hugo, and David Wagoner. The highly introspective nature of Roethke&#x27;s work greatly influenced the poet Sylvia Plath. So influential was Roethke&#x27;s poetry on Plath&#x27;s mature poetry that when she submitted &quot;Poem for a Birthday&quot; to &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine, it was turned down because it displayed &quot;too imposing a debt to Roethke.&quot;

In 1952, Roethke received a Ford Foundation grant to &quot;expand on his knowledge of philosophy and theology&quot;, and spent most of his time from June 1952 to September 1953 reading primarily existential works. Among the philosophers and theologians he read were Sören Kierkegaard, Evelyn Underhill, Meister Eckhart, Paul Tillich, Jacob Boehme, and Martin Buber.

In 1953, Roethke married Beatrice O&#x27;Connell, a former student. Roethke was a heavy drinker and susceptible to bouts of mental illness, something not uncommon among American poets of his generation. He did not initially inform O&#x27;Connell of his repeated episodes of mania and depression, yet she remained dedicated to him and his work. She ensured the posthumous publication of his final volume of poetry, &quot;The Far Field&quot;, as well as a book of his collected children&#x27;s verse, &quot;Dirty Dinky and Other Creatures&quot;, in 1973. From 1955 to 1956 he spent one year in Italy on a scholarship of the U.S.-Italy Fulbright Commission.

In 1961, &quot;The Return&quot; was featured on George Abbe&#x27;s album &quot;Anthology of Contemporary American Poetry&quot; on Folkways Records. The following year, Roethke released his own album on the label entitled, &quot;Words for the Wind: Poems of Theodore Roethke&quot;.

In 1961, Roethke was chosen as one of 50 outstanding Americans of meritorious performance in the fields of endeavor, to be Guest of Honor to the first annual Banquet of the Golden Plate in Monterey, California. This was awarded by vote of the National Panel of Distinguished Americans of the Academy of Achievement.

He suffered a heart attack in his friend S. Rasnics&#x27; swimming pool in 1963 and died on Bainbridge Island, Washington, aged 55. The pool was later filled in and is now a zen rock garden open to the public at the Bloedel Reserve, a 150-acre (60 hectare) former private estate. There is no marker to indicate that the rock garden was the site of Roethke&#x27;s death.

==Commemoration==

There is a sign that commemorates his boyhood home and burial in Saginaw, Michigan. The historical marker notes in part:
Theodore Roethke (1908–1963) wrote of his poetry: The greenhouse &quot;is my symbol for the whole of life, a womb, a heaven-on-earth.&quot; Roethke drew inspiration from his childhood experiences of working in his family&#x27;s Saginaw floral company. Beginning in 1941 with &quot;Open House&quot;, the distinguished poet and teacher published extensively, receiving a Pulitzer Prize for poetry and two National Book Awards among an array of honors. In 1959 Pennsylvania University awarded him the Bollingen Prize. Roethke taught at Michigan State College, (present-day Michigan State University) and at colleges in Pennsylvania and Vermont, before joining the faculty of the University of Washington at Seattle in 1947. Roethke died in Washington in 1963. His remains are interred in Saginaw&#x27;s Oakwood Cemetery.

The Friends of Theodore Roethke Foundation maintains his birthplace at 1805 Gratiot in Saginaw as a museum.

Roethke Auditorium (Kane Hall 130) at the University of Washington is named in his honor.

In 1995, the Seattle alley between Seventh and Eighth Avenues N.E. running from N.E. 45th Street to N.E. 47th Street was named Roethke Mews in his honor. It adjoins the Blue Moon Tavern, one of Roethke&#x27;s haunts.

In 2016, the Theodore Roethke Home museum announced their &quot;quest to find as many as possible of the 1,000 hand-numbered copies of [...] Roethke&#x27;s debut collection, &quot;Open House,&quot; to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the work&#x27;s publication.&quot;

==Critical responses==
Two-time US Poet Laureate Stanley Kunitz said of Roethke, &quot;The poet of my generation who meant most to me, in his person and in his art, was Theodore Roethke.&quot;

In a Spring 1976 interview in the &quot;Paris Review&quot; (No. 65), James Dickey defended his choice of Roethke as the greatest of all American poets. Dickey states: &quot;I don&#x27;t see anyone else that has the kind of deep, gut vitality that Roethke&#x27;s got. Whitman was a great poet, but he&#x27;s no competition for Roethke.&quot;

In his book &quot;The Western Canon; The Books and School of the Age,&quot; (1994) Yale literary critic Harold Bloom cites two Roethke books, &quot;Collected Poems&quot; and &quot;Straw for The Fire,&quot; on his list of essential writers and books. Bloom also groups Roethke with Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Penn Warren as the most accomplished among the &quot;middle generation&quot; of American poets.

In her 2006 book, &quot;Break, Blow, Burn: Forty-three of the World&#x27;s Best Poems,&quot; critic Camille Paglia includes three Roethke poems, more than any other 20th-century writer cited in the book.

The Poetry Foundation entry on Roethke notes early reviews of his work and Roethke&#x27;s response to that early criticism: W. H. Auden called [Roethke&#x27;s first book] &quot;Open House&quot; &quot;completely successful.&quot; In another review of the book, Elizabeth Drew felt &quot;his poems have a controlled grace of movement and his images the utmost precision; while in the expression of a kind of gnomic wisdom which is peculiar to him as he attains an austerity of contemplation and a pared, spare strictness of language very unusual in poets of today.&quot; Roethke kept both Auden&#x27;s and Drew&#x27;s reviews, along with other favorable reactions to his work. As he remained sensitive to how peers and others he respected should view his poetry, so too did he remain sensitive to his introspective drives as the source of his creativity. Understandably, critics picked up on the self as the predominant preoccupation in Roethke&#x27;s poems.

Roethke&#x27;s breakthrough book, &quot;The Lost Son and Other Poems&quot;, also won him considerable praise. For instance, Michael Harrington felt Roethke &quot;found his own voice and central themes in The Lost Son&quot; and Stanley Kunitz saw a &quot;confirmation that he was in full possession of his art and of his vision.&quot; In &quot;Against Oblivion&quot;, an examination of forty-five twentieth century poets, the critic Ian Hamilton also praised this book, writing, &quot;In Roethke&#x27;s second book, &quot;The Lost Son&quot;, there are several of these greenhouse poems and they are among the best things he wrote; convincing and exact, and rich in loamy detail.&quot; Michael O&#x27;Sullivan points to the phrase &quot;uncertain congress of stinks&quot;, from the greenhouse poem &quot;Root Cellar&quot;, as Roethke&#x27;s insistence on the ambiguous processes of the animal and vegetable world, processes that cannot be reduced to growth and decay alone.

In addition to the well-known greenhouse poems, the Poetry Foundation notes that Roethke also won praise &quot;for his love poems which first appeared in &quot;The Waking&quot; and earned their own section in the new book and &#x27;were a distinct departure from the painful excavations of the monologues and in some respects a return to the strict stanzaic forms of the earliest work,&#x27; [according to the poet] Stanley Kunitz. [The critic] Ralph Mills described &#x27;the amatory verse&#x27; as a blend of &#x27;consideration of self with qualities of eroticism and sensuality; but more important, the poems introduce and maintain a fascination with something beyond the self, that is, with the figure of the other, or the beloved woman.&#x27;&quot;

In reviewing his posthumously published &quot;Collected Poems&quot; in 1966, Karl Malkoff of &quot;The Sewanee Review&quot; wrote: Though not definitive, &quot;Roethke: Collected Poems&quot; is a major book of poetry. It reveals the full extent of Roethke&#x27;s achievement: his ability to perceive reality in terms of the tensions between inner and outer worlds, and to find a meaningful system of metaphor with which to communicate this perception... It also points up his weaknesses: the derivative quality of his less successful verse, the limited areas of concern in even his best poems. The balance, it seems to me, is in Roethke&#x27;s favor... He is one of our finest poets, a human poet in a world that threatens to turn man into an object.

In 1967 Roethke&#x27;s &quot;Collected Poems&quot; topped the lists of two of the three Pulitzer Prize poetry voters; Phyllis McGinley and Louis Simpson. However the group&#x27;s chairman, Richard Eberhart, lobbied against Roethke on the grounds that the award should go to a living poet; it would have been Roethke&#x27;s second Pulitzer Prize.

<text>The Battle of Tudela (23 November 1808) saw an Imperial French army led by Marshal Jean Lannes attack a Spanish army under General Castaños. The battle resulted in the complete victory of the Imperial forces over their adversaries. The combat occurred near Tudela in Navarre, Spain during the Peninsular War, part of a wider conflict known as the Napoleonic Wars.

==Background==
Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Spain had started with the Battle of Zornoza.
Napoleon&#x27;s strategy was to make a strong attack towards Burgos splitting off the army of Blake from the others and to outflank them by then swinging both north and south.

==Preliminaries==
On 21 November 1808 Castaños was around Calahorra on the Ebro between Logroño and Tudela. On this day the French III Corps crossed the Ebro at Logroño and headed east towards Calahorra while at the same time Marshal Michel Ney with the VI Corps reached the Upper Douro Valley and headed towards Tudela.

These movements threatened Castaños with entrapment between these two armies. To avoid this Castaños withdrew to Tudela. He decided to defend a line long stretching west from Tudela along the Ebro, then along the Queiles River to Cascante and finally to Tarazona at the foot of the Moncayo Massif.

Castaños had insufficient men to hold a line of this length so he asked General Juan O&#x27;Neylle, who had two divisions at Caparroso on the east bank of the Ebro, for help. As O&#x27;Neylle was under the command of Palafox he refused to move without an order from Palafox. This did not arrive until noon on 22 November 1808. O&#x27;Neylle moved promptly to the east bank of the Ebro opposite Tudela but decided not to cross the river until the next day.

By nightfall on 22 November 1808 Castaños had almost 45,000 soldiers in the vicinity of Tudela but very few of them actually in position. Castaños placed General Manuel la Peña&#x27;s 4th Division of 8,000 men, mostly Andalusians who had participated in the Battle of Bailén, at Cascante and General Grimarest at the head of three divisions totaling 13,000 to 14,000 soldiers at Tarazona. General Roca&#x27;s division was on the east bank of the Ebro plus the two divisions from Aragon of O’Neylle and Felipe Augusto de Saint-Marcq.

Most of the fighting in the battle of Tudela would involve only the three divisions of Roca, O&#x27;Neylle, and Saint-Marcq – totaling about 23,000 infantry.

For the French only the III Corps was involved in the Battle of Tudela. Prior to 22 November 1808 this force had been commanded by Marshal Moncey. However, Napoleon transferred command to Marshal Jean Lannes when the advance began. This corps was just under 34,000 men consisting of four infantry divisions and three cavalry regiments. To this was added General of Division Joseph Lagrange&#x27;s infantry division and General of Brigade Auguste François-Marie de Colbert-Chabanais&#x27;s cavalry brigade from Ney&#x27;s corps.

On the night of 22 November the French Army camped at Alfaro – 17 kilometres up the Ebro from Tudela.

==Battle==
On the morning of 23 November 1808 Lagrange&#x27;s infantry and two cavalry brigades were sent towards Cascante. The rest of the force was sent along the Ebro towards Tudela.

At this time O&#x27;Neylle was trying to get his three divisions across the Ebro. Roca&#x27;s was across first and reached its position on the right of the Spanish line just as the French attacked.

Saint-Marcq&#x27;s division was second across and also took up position before the attack.

By the time O&#x27;Neylle&#x27;s own division was crossing it had to fight French skirmishers who were at the top of the Cabezo Malla ridge.

The initial French attack was carried out in a piecemeal fashion by the vanguard when it was realised that the Spanish were not in position. Although this attack was repelled it showed the weakness of the Spanish positions, especially the gap between Castaños and La Peña&#x27;s force at Cascante.

The battle would ultimately be decided by La Peña and Grimarest. By noon on 23 November 1808 they had received orders to move: La Peña to close the gap at Tudela and Grimarest to Cascante. Both men failed to carry out these orders other than La Peña moving two battalions and a detachment of provincial Grenadiers to Urzante. La Peña&#x27;s lack of initiative allowed the two French cavalry brigades of Colbert and General of Brigade Alexandre, vicomte Digeon to pin him in place.
The second French attack was made with much greater force. On the French left General of Division Antoine Morlot&#x27;s division attacked Roca&#x27;s division on the heights above Tudela. On the French right General of Division Maurice Mathieu&#x27;s division made a frontal assault on the smaller O&#x27;Neylle division while also making outflanking moves. The attacks on both left and right were successful with both Spanish divisions being pushed off the ridges they occupied.

Then the French cavalry under General of Division Charles Lefebvre-Desnouettes charged the gap between Roca and Saint-Marcq causing the collapse of the Spanish right.

La Peña and Grimarest finally united at Cascante late in the day giving them a total of 21,000 men against Lagrange&#x27;s division which was 6,000 strong plus Colbert and Digeon. After the defeat of the rest of the Spanish army however La Peña and Grimarest withdrew after dark. Their poor performance was also reflected in the casualties of only 200 on the Spanish left compared to 3,000 on the right plus 1,000 prisoners.

==Casualties==
Spanish casualties were estimated to be about 6,000 out of a total force of 45,000. The French, in all, lost no more than 700 dead and wounded out of a total of 35,000.

==Aftermath==
The Spanish armies of the left and right escaped from Tudela in two directions. The Aragonese forces on the right made for Zaragoza where they would assist in the Second Siege of Zaragoza starting on 20 December 1808. The virtually intact Spanish left moved towards Madrid to defend that city.

Napoleon however moved more quickly, and after defeating a small Spanish army at the Battle of Somosierra on 30 November, his vanguard arrived in Madrid on 1 December 1808, with the city capitulating on 4 December 1808.

Napoleon&#x27;s strategy ultimately ended successfully with the occupation of Madrid.

==In popular culture==
The battle was engraved on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

<text>In the Battle of Vimeiro (sometimes shown as &quot;Vimiera&quot; or &quot;Vimeira&quot; in contemporary British texts) on 21 August 1808, the British under General Arthur Wellesley (who later became the Duke of Wellington) defeated the French under Major-General Jean-Andoche Junot near the village of Vimeiro (), near Lisbon, Portugal, during the Peninsular War. This battle put an end to the first French invasion of Portugal.

Four days after the Battle of Roliça, Wellesley&#x27;s army was attacked by a French army under General Junot near the village of Vimeiro. The battle began as a battle of manoeuvre, with French troops attempting to outflank the British left, but Wellesley was able to redeploy his army to face the assault. Meanwhile, Junot sent in two central columns but these were forced back by sustained volleys from troops in line. Soon afterwards, the flanking attack was beaten off and Junot retreated towards Torres Vedras, having lost 2,000 men and 13 cannon, compared to 700 Anglo-Portuguese losses. No pursuit was attempted because Wellesley was superseded by Sir Harry Burrard and then Sir Hew Dalrymple (one having arrived during the battle, the second soon after).

==Background==
The British intervention started with the Battle of Roliça.

==Prelude==
After Roliça, Wellesley had established a position near Vimeiro. By holding the village, plus some ridges to the west, the British commander covered a beachhead at Maceira Bay a little further to the west. Since most of his reinforcements had arrived by 20 August, Wellesley planned to advance south on Lisbon. Eight independent infantry brigades under Rowland Hill, Ronald Craufurd Ferguson, Miles Nightingall, Barnard Foord Bowes, Catlin Craufurd, Henry Fane, Robert Anstruther and Wroth Acland formed the core of Wellesley&#x27;s forces. Rounding out his force were 17 cannons, 240 light cavalry led by C. D. Taylor and about 2,000 Portuguese troops under Nicholas Trant, giving a total of 20,000 men.

Junot organised his 14,000-man force into two infantry divisions and a cavalry division under Pierre Margaron. Henri François Delaborde&#x27;s infantry division contained two brigades under Antoine François Brenier and Jean Guillaume Barthélemy Thomières, while Louis Henri Loison&#x27;s division included two brigades commanded by Jean-Baptiste Solignac and Hugues Charlot. In addition, François Étienne de Kellermann commanded a 2,100-man reserve made up of four converged grenadier battalions. These units were created by taking the grenadier company from each of Junot&#x27;s infantry battalions. The French took 23 cannons into battle with them.

Wellesley placed Anstruther&#x27;s and Fane&#x27;s brigades in front of Vimeiro, with Acland&#x27;s men in support. At first, his five remaining brigades held only the western ridge. Junot planned to send Thomières, Solignac and Charlot&#x27;s infantry brigades to capture Vimeiro, while Brenier&#x27;s 4,300-man brigade and some dragoons swung in a wide flanking manoeuvre to seize an empty ridge to the northeast of the village. Wellesley detected Brenier&#x27;s move and switched Nightingall, Ferguson and Bowes to the northeastern ridge. Once Junot realised that British troops occupied the ridge, he sent Solignac&#x27;s brigade to the right to assist Brenier&#x27;s attack. The French commander decided to launch his attack on the town immediately, instead of waiting for his flanking move to develop.

==Battle==
All the preliminary moves and countermoves caused a series of uncoordinated French attacks. First, Thomières&#x27; 2,100-man brigade approached the British position. Supported by three cannons and screened by skirmishers, the brigade was formed into a column of companies.

The first company of 120 men formed in a three-deep line would have a front rank 40 men wide. All the other companies formed behind the first company, making the entire brigade about 40 files wide and 48 ranks deep. According to French doctrine, as soon as the enemy main position was found, the companies would peel off to the right or left to form a firing line many companies wide and only three files deep. On the other hand, French commanders often pressed home attacks while in column, depending entirely upon their skirmishers and artillery to provide the necessary fire support.

To counter the French skirmishers, Fane detached four companies of riflemen (60th Regiment of Foot &amp; 95th Rifles). These outnumbered and outfought the French skirmishers, who fell back to the sides of the brigade column. Without their skirmishers in front of them, the French column blundered into the 945 men of the 50th Regiment. At , the British, formed into a two-deep line, opened fire. Several companies of the 50th began wheeling inward toward both flanks of the hapless French column. Unable to properly deploy into firing line and unwilling to face the deadly enfilade fire, the French infantry suddenly bolted to the rear, leaving their three cannons to be captured.

Soon after, a similar fate overtook Charlot&#x27;s brigade. In a very narrow column, it struck one battalion of Anstruther&#x27;s brigade, which had been hidden behind a crest. Before they could deploy, the French were taken in flank by a second battalion. Unable to effectively reply to the devastating British volley fire, Charlot&#x27;s men soon ran away. Seeing the battle going against him, Junot committed his grenadier reserve to the attack. The first two battalions attacked the same area as the previous units and were thrown back. Kellermann swung the final two grenadier battalions wide to the right and succeeded in breaking into Vimeiro. But, counterattacked by units from Anstruther and Acland, these Frenchmen also fell back. Colonel Taylor&#x27;s 20th Light Dragoons pounced on Kellermann&#x27;s retreating grenadiers and routed them. Excited by their easy success, the British horsemen charged out of control. They soon came up against Margaron&#x27;s French cavalry division and were routed in their turn. Taylor was killed and the British horsemen lost about one man in four. As Brenier&#x27;s men had been delayed by taking a longer road to circumvent the narrow ravines, Solignac attacked the northeast ridge. This brigade changed tactics deploying in an attack formation with three battalions abreast. Even so, each battalion formed a column one company wide and eight companies deep. If the French intended to form into line once the enemy position was detected, they waited too long. They marched into the volley fire of Nightingall and Ferguson&#x27;s brigades before they could deploy. Smashed by British volleys, Solignac&#x27;s men fled.

Brenier&#x27;s brigade, marching to the sound of battle, came on four battalions abreast. At first they enjoyed success when they surprised and drove back two British battalions. These units had let down their guard after overpowering Solignac. Victorious, the French pressed on in column, but soon ran into the 29th Regiment in line and were stopped. The 29th was joined by the other two units, who had quickly rallied. Together, the volley fire of the three British battalions soon routed Brenier&#x27;s men. Though Wellesley urged him to pursue, Burrard declined to interfere with the subsequent French retreat. General Brenier was wounded in this attack and captured by the 71st Highlanders.

==Aftermath==
The British intervention proceeded with the Evacuation of La Romana&#x27;s division.

===Vimeiro===
After the French defeat, Dalrymple gave the French more generous terms than they could have hoped for. Under the terms of the &quot;Convention of Sintra&quot;, the defeated army was transported back to France by the British navy, complete with its loot, guns and equipment. The Convention of Sintra caused an outcry in Britain. An official enquiry exonerated all three men but both the military establishment and public opinion blamed Dalrymple and Burrard. Both men were given administrative posts and neither had a field command again. Wellesley, who had bitterly opposed the agreement, was returned to active command in Spain and Portugal.

<text>At the Battle of Vitoria (21 June 1813), a British, Portuguese and Spanish army under the Marquess of Wellington broke the French army under King Joseph Bonaparte and Marshal Jean-Baptiste Jourdan near Vitoria in Spain, eventually leading to victory in the Peninsular War.

==Background==
In July 1812, after the Battle of Salamanca, the French had evacuated Madrid, which Wellington&#x27;s army entered on 12 August 1812. Deploying three divisions to guard its southern approaches, Wellington marched north with the rest of his army to lay siege to the fortress of Burgos, away, but he had miscalculated the enemy&#x27;s strength, and on 21 October he had to abandon the Siege of Burgos and retreat. By 31 October he had abandoned Madrid too and retreated first to Salamanca then to Ciudad Rodrigo, near the Portuguese frontier, to avoid encirclement by French armies from the north-east and south-east.

Wellington spent the winter reorganizing and reinforcing his forces to attack King Joseph in Madrid. Napoleon recalled to France numerous soldiers to reconstruct his main army after his disastrous invasion of Russia. By 20 May 1813 Wellington marched 121,000 troops (53,749 British, 39,608 Spanish and 27,569 Portuguese) from northern Portugal across the mountains of northern Spain and the Esla River to outflank Marshal Jourdan&#x27;s army of 68,000, strung out between the Douro and the Tagus. The French retreated to Burgos, with Wellington&#x27;s forces marching hard to cut them off from the road to France. Wellington himself commanded the small central force in a strategic feint, while Sir Thomas Graham conducted the bulk of the army around the French right flank over landscape considered impassable.

Wellington launched his attack with 57,000 British, 16,000 Portuguese and 8,000 Spanish at Vitoria on 21 June, from four directions.

The battlefield centres on the Zadorra river, which runs from east to west. As the Zadorra runs west, it loops into a hairpin bend, finally swinging generally to the southwest. On the south of the battlefield are the Heights of La Puebla. To the northwest is the mass of Monte Arrato. Vitoria stands to the east, two miles (3 km) south of the Zadorra. Five roads radiate from Vitoria, north to Bilbao, northeast to Salinas and Bayonne, east to Salvatierra, south to Logroño and west to Burgos on the south side of the Zadorra.

===Plans===
Jourdan was ill with a fever all day on 20 June. Because of this, few orders were issued and the French forces stood idle. An enormous wagon train of booty clogged the streets of Vitoria. A convoy left during the night, but it had to leave siege artillery behind because there were not enough draft animals to pull the cannons.

Gazan&#x27;s divisions guarded the narrow western end of the Zadorra valley, deployed south of the river. Maransin&#x27;s brigade was posted in advance, at the village of Subijana. The divisions were disposed with Leval on the right, Daricau in the centre, Conroux on the left and Villatte in reserve. Only a picket guarded the western extremity of the Heights of La Puebla.

Further back, d&#x27;Erlon&#x27;s force stood in a second line, also south of the river. Darmagnac&#x27;s division deployed on the right and Cassagne&#x27;s on the left. D&#x27;Erlon failed to destroy three bridges near the river&#x27;s hairpin bend and posted Avy&#x27;s weak cavalry division to guard them. Reille&#x27;s men originally formed a third line, but Sarrut&#x27;s division was sent north of the river to guard the Bilbao road while Lamartinière&#x27;s division and the Spanish Royal Guard units held the river bank.

Wellington directed Hill&#x27;s 20,000-man Right Column to drive the French from the Zadorra defile on the south side of the river. While the French were preoccupied with Hill, Wellington&#x27;s Right Centre column moved along the north bank of the river and crossed it near the hairpin bend behind the French right flank.

Graham&#x27;s 20,000-man Left Column was sent around the north side of Monte Arrato. It drove down the Bilbao road, cutting off the bulk of the French army. Dalhousie&#x27;s Left Centre column cut across Monte Arrato and struck the river east of the hairpin, providing a link between Graham and Wellington.

==Battle==


Wellington&#x27;s plan split his army into four attacking &quot;columns&quot;, attacking the French defensive position from south, west and north while the last column cut down across the French rear. Coming up the Burgos road, Hill sent Pablo Morillo&#x27;s Division to the right on a climb up the Heights of La Puebla. Stewart&#x27;s 2nd Division began deploying to the left in the narrow plain just south of the river. Seeing these moves, Gazan sent Maransin forward to drive Morillo off the heights. Hill moved Col. Henry Cadogan&#x27;s brigade of the 2nd Division to assist Morillo. Gazan responded by committing Villatte&#x27;s reserve division to the battle on the heights.

About this time, Gazan first spotted Wellington&#x27;s column moving north of the Zadorra to turn his right flank. He asked Jourdan, now recovered from his fever, for reinforcements. Having become obsessed with the safety of his left flank, the marshal refused to help Gazan, instead ordering some of D&#x27;Erlon&#x27;s troops to guard the Logroño road.

Wellington thrust James Kempt&#x27;s brigade of the Light Division across the Zadorra at the hairpin. At the same time, Stewart took Subijana and was counterattacked by two of Gazan&#x27;s divisions. On the heights, Cadogan was killed, but the Anglo-Spanish force managed to hang on to its foothold. Wellington suspended his attacks to allow Graham&#x27;s column time to make an impression and a lull descended on the battlefield.

At noon, Graham&#x27;s column appeared on the Bilbao road. Jourdan immediately realised he was in danger of envelopment and ordered Gazan to pull back toward Vitoria. Graham drove Sarrut&#x27;s division back across the river, but could not force his way across the Zadorra despite bitter fighting. Further east, Longa&#x27;s Spanish troops defeated the Spanish Royal Guards and cut the road to Bayonne.

With some help from Kempt&#x27;s brigade, Picton&#x27;s 3rd Division from Dalhousie&#x27;s column crossed to the south side of the river. According to Picton, the enemy responded by pummelling the 3rd with 40 to 50 cannon and a counter-attack on their right flank, still open because they had captured the bridge so quickly, causing the 3rd to lose 1,800 men (over one third of all Allied losses at the battle) as they held their ground. Cole&#x27;s 4th Division crossed further west. With Gazan on the left and d&#x27;Erlon on the right, the French attempted a stand at the village of Arinez. Formed in a menacing line, the 4th, Light, 3rd and 7th Divisions soon captured this position. The French fell back to the Zuazo ridge, covered by their well-handled and numerous field artillery. This position fell to Wellington&#x27;s attack when Gazan refused to cooperate with his colleague d&#x27;Erlon.

French morale collapsed and the soldiers of Gazan and d&#x27;Erlon fled from the field. Artillerists left their guns behind as they fled on the trace horses. Soon the road was jammed with a mass of wagons and carriages. The efforts of Reille&#x27;s two divisions, holding off Graham, allowed tens of thousands of French troops to escape by the Salvatierra road.

==Aftermath==
The Allied army lost about 5,000 men, with 3,675 British, 921 Portuguese and 562 Spanish casualties. French losses totalled at least 5,200 killed and wounded, plus 2,800 men and 151 cannon captured. By army, the losses were South 4,300, Centre 2,100 and Portugal 1,600. There were no casualty returns from the Royal Guard or the artillery.

French losses were not higher for several reasons. First, the Allied army had already marched that morning and was in no condition to pursue. Second, Reille&#x27;s men valiantly held off Graham&#x27;s column. Third, the valley by which the French retreated was narrow and well-covered by the 3rd Hussar and the 15th Dragoon Regiments acting as rearguard. Last, the French left their booty behind.

Many British soldiers turned aside to plunder the abandoned French wagons, containing &quot;the loot of a kingdom&quot;. It is estimated that more than £1 million of booty (perhaps £100 million in modern equivalent) was seized, but the gross abandonment of discipline caused an enraged Wellington to write in a dispatch to Earl Bathurst, &quot;We have in the service the scum of the earth as common soldiers&quot;. The British general also vented his fury on a new cavalry regiment, writing, &quot;The 18th Hussars are a disgrace to the name of soldier, in action as well as elsewhere; and I propose to draft their horses from them and send the men to England if I cannot get the better of them in any other manner.&quot; (On 8April 1814, the 18th redeemed their reputation in a gallant charge led by Lieutenant-colonel Sir Henry Murray at Croix d&#x27;Orade, shortly before the battle of Toulouse)

Order was soon restored, and by December, after detachments had seized San Sebastián and Pamplona, Wellington&#x27;s army was encamped in France. 

The abdication of Napoleon ended the Peninsular War followed by the Battle of Toulouse and the Battle of Bayonne.

===Legacy===
The battle was the inspiration for Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Opus 91, often called the &quot;Battle Symphony&quot; or &quot;Wellington&#x27;s Victory&quot;, which portrays the battle as musical drama. Another large-scale composition was Johann Bernhard Logier&#x27;s &quot;The Battle of Vitoria&quot; (1813), which combined several military bands with orchestra. The artist George Jones was commissioned to produce a painting &quot;The Battle of Vittoria&quot; by George IV in 1822. 

The climax of the movie &quot;The Firefly&quot;, starring Jeanette MacDonald, occurs with Wellington&#x27;s attack on the French centre. (The film used music from an opera of the same name by Rudolf Friml, but with a totally different plot.)

The battle and French rout also forms the climax to Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s book &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Honour&quot;.

<doc id="157767" wikidata="Q467777" url="?curid=157767" title="Battle of Wagram">
<text>The Battle of Wagram (; 5–6 July 1809) was a military engagement of the Napoleonic Wars that ended in a costly but decisive victory for Emperor Napoleon&#x27;s French and allied army against the Austrian army under the command of Archduke Charles of Austria-Teschen. The battle led to the breakup of the Fifth Coalition, the Austrian and British-led alliance against France. Wagram was the largest battle in European history up to its time.

In 1809, the French military presence in the Confederation of the Rhine was diminished as Napoleon transferred a number of soldiers to fight in the Peninsular War. As a result, the Austrian Empire saw its chance to recover some of its former sphere of influence and invaded the Kingdom of Bavaria, a French ally. Recovering from his initial surprise, Napoleon beat the Austrian forces and occupied Vienna at the beginning of May 1809. Despite the string of sharp defeats and the loss of the empire&#x27;s capital, Archduke Charles salvaged an army, with which he retreated north of the Danube. This allowed the Austrians to continue the war. Towards the end of May, Napoleon resumed the offensive, suffering a surprise defeat at the Battle of Aspern-Essling.

It took Napoleon six weeks to prepare his next offensive, for which he amassed a 172,000-man French, German and Italian army in the vicinity of Vienna. The Battle of Wagram began after Napoleon crossed the Danube with the bulk of these forces during the night of 4 July and attacked the 136,000-man strong Austrian army. Having successfully crossed the river, Napoleon attempted an early breakthrough and launched a series of evening attacks against the Austrian army. The Austrians were thinly spread in a wide semicircle, but held a naturally strong position. After the attackers enjoyed some initial success, the defenders regained the upper hand and the attacks failed. Bolstered by his success, the next day at dawn Archduke Charles launched a series of attacks along the entire battle line, seeking to take the opposing army in a double envelopment. The offensive failed against the French right but nearly broke Napoleon&#x27;s left. However, the Emperor countered by launching a cavalry charge, which temporarily halted the Austrian advance. He then redeployed IV Corps to stabilise his left, while setting up a grand battery, which pounded the Austrian right and centre. The tide of battle turned and the Emperor launched an offensive along the entire line, while &quot;Maréchal&quot; Louis-Nicolas Davout drove an offensive, which turned the Austrian left, and rendered Charles&#x27;s position untenable. Towards mid-afternoon on 6 July, Charles admitted defeat and led a retreat, frustrating enemy attempts to pursue. After the battle, Charles remained in command of a cohesive force and decided to retreat to Bohemia. However, the eventually caught up with him and scored a victory at the Battle of Znaim. With the battle still raging, Charles decided to ask for an armistice, effectively ending the war.

With 74,000 casualties, the two-day battle of Wagram was particularly bloody, mainly due to the use of 800 artillery pieces and the expenditure of 200,000 rounds of artillery ammunition on a flat battlefield packed with some 300,000 men. Although Napoleon was the uncontested winner, he failed to secure an overwhelming victory and the Austrian casualties were only slightly greater than those of the French and allies. Nonetheless, the defeat was serious enough to shatter the morale of the Austrians, who could no longer find the will to continue the struggle. The resulting Treaty of Schönbrunn meant the loss of one sixth of the Austrian Empire&#x27;s subjects, along with some territories, rendering it landlocked until the German Campaign of 1813.

After the battle, Emperor Napoleon bestowed on Louis-Alexandre Berthier, who was his Marshal, Chief of Staff, Minister of War and Vice-Constable of the Empire, the victory title of 1st Prince of Wagram, making him an official member of the French nobility. Berthier had previously been granted the title of Sovereign Prince of Neuchâtel and the Prince of Valangin in 1806. This allowed his descendants to carry the titles of Prince and Princess of Wagram.

== Prelude ==
=== Context ===

In 1809, the First French Empire held a dominant position on the European continent. Resounding victories during the 1805 to 1807 wars against the Third and Fourth coalitions had ensured almost undisputed continental hegemony, to such an extent that no other European power could challenge the might of Napoleon&#x27;s empire. However, despite having defeated Austria, forced Russia into an uneasy alliance and reduced Prussia to the rank of a second-rate power, Napoleon did not manage to force the United Kingdom to make peace. With the British in complete control of the seas, Napoleon thus opted for an economic war, imposing the Continental System against the British Isles, in a bid to dry up vital British commercial relations with the continent. To ensure the effectiveness of the Continental System, he sought to force Portugal, a traditional British trading partner, to observe it; when diplomatic means failed in 1808, Napoleon had the country occupied, forcing the ruling dynasty of Braganza to flee the country and seek refuge in its main colony, Brazil. In a move that would prove to be both uninspired and ill-handled, Napoleon also overstepped his power and decided to change the ruling dynasty of Spain, replacing King Charles IV with his own brother, Joseph, who became King José I of Spain. The new king was, however, not well received by the population and much of the country&#x27;s ruling elite who felt that Napoleon was imposing on them, which triggered a bloody guerrilla war throughout the country. The French position in the peninsula was rendered untenable after the Battle of Bailen, a rare and resounding defeat for the French forces and an event that greatly encouraged the Austrian war party. With Napoleon forced to intervene personally and commit increasingly significant forces to the Spanish, the French military position in central Europe was severely weakened. In addition, Franco-Russian relations had deteriorated and, although the two countries remained allies on paper, it was unlikely that Russia would commit itself seriously to fighting France&#x27;s enemies on the continent. 

France&#x27;s main adversary in central Europe was the Austrian Empire. Defeated at Ulm and Austerlitz in 1805 and forced to conclude the humiliating Peace of Pressburg, Austria still possessed a formidable army which, in the years following Austerlitz, had undergone major reforms. By 1809, the state was almost bankrupt and acutely aware that it could not retain its status as a great power if it did not manage to regain some of its former influence in Germany and Italy. Encouraged by Napoleon&#x27;s peninsular imbroglio, British subsidies and the promise of a military intervention in northern Europe, the Austrians decided that the European political context of 1808 and 1809 offered their best chance to retake lost provinces. In order to win the war against the French, Vienna was counting on massive nationalist, anti-French uprisings throughout Germany and hoping that an early success might convince Prussia to join the new coalition, while calculating that Russia would most likely not interfere in support of the French. Austrian military preparations were accelerated in 1808 and early 1809, with operations set to occur in several war theatres, including the main one in Bavaria and sideshows in Italy, Dalmatia, Westphalia, Tyrol and Poland. In stark contrast to 1805, by 1809 Austria had managed to reform its military and build a relatively modern and overall redoubtable army, placed in the hands of their best commander, Archduke Charles of Austria, brother of Emperor Francis I of Austria.

=== Opening campaign ===
By March 1809, war between Austria and France was imminent and the Habsburg army, 200,000 men strong, massed in the northwestern province of Bohemia, near the frontier with the Confederation of the Rhine, the French-dominated confederacy of German states. Austria hoped that Prussia would join the war and, by massing its main army in Bohemia, it signalled its intent to join up with the Prussians. However, by early April 1809, it became obvious that Prussia was not ready to commit, and the Austrians were forced to move their main army southwards, in a bid to launch their westward offensive along the Danube. Strategically, the decision was sound, since an offensive along the river valley allowed better protection for the Austrian capital. Nevertheless, the time-consuming manoeuvres to Bohemia and back cost the Austrians an entire month.

On 9 April 1809, without any declaration of war, the main Austrian army crossed the Inn River into Bavaria, one of France&#x27;s main allies, while secondary Austrian armies launched offensives of their own. Meanwhile, Napoleon was in Paris, conscious that the war was imminent but unaware that the Austrians were prepared for immediate offensive. Command of the French and allied army, styled &quot;Armée d&#x27;Allemagne&quot;, was in the hands of &quot;Maréchal&quot; Berthier, a formidable officer when working as Napoleon&#x27;s chief of staff, but completely out of his depth as a commander by proxy.Furthermore, in order to remain in close contact with Paris by military telegraph and to avoid provoking the Austrians, Berthier was initially ordered to set up his headquarters near Strasbourg, hundreds of kilometres away from the front line, before moving to Germany as war broke out. As a result, Berthier&#x27;s response to Charles&#x27;s invasion was timid and, after misinterpreting Napoleon&#x27;s orders, he left two entire army corps in isolated positions. Consequently, during the first week of the campaign, Charles was able to advance virtually unmolested and take advantage of the poor French deployment. All changed from 17 April, when Napoleon arrived in person and began concentrating his available troops to meet the Austrian onslaught. Before Napoleon could concentrate his corps, Charles attacked Davout&#x27;s isolated corps at Teugen-Hausen but the dogged French marshal repulsed the attackers. The tide of the campaign had turned but Napoleon misjudged the strategic situation, thinking that the force that had fought Davout was only a flank guard and that the main force lay before him; in reality it was the opposite. As the French took the offensive several actions ensued : Landshut, Abensberg, Eckmühl and Ratisbon, with the Austrians coming off worse each time and having their left wing cut off from the bulk of the army. In the end, however, Charles succeeded in avoiding a decisive defeat, preserving a combat-ready army which he directed north of the Danube, where he awaited Napoleon&#x27;s next move.

Charles&#x27;s retreat left Napoleon with two options: pursue the defeated Austrian army north of the Danube or occupy Vienna, which was now covered by a secondary enemy force and could not hope to hold out. Uncharacteristically, Napoleon, who had stated on a number of occasions that the purpose of any campaign is to destroy the main army of the enemy, opted for the latter course of action and entered the enemy capital on 12 May, only to find the city&#x27;s strategic bridges over the Danube blown up. With the emperor poised for an immediate continuation of the offensive north of the river, this was a considerable setback. Meanwhile, Charles brought the bulk of his remaining force on the northern bank of the river, close to Vienna, which lured Napoleon into attacking them right away. Napoleon&#x27;s rushed crossing of the river was made on fragile, hastily built pontoon bridges, over an increasingly swollen river. The French crossing resulted in the Battle of Aspern-Essling, beginning on 21 May; the more numerous Austrian army faced only a fraction of the , as Napoleon was unable to bring through the bulk of his forces in time. Still, Charles&#x27;s attempt to drive the outnumbered enemy back resulted in total failure, as the French led a skillful combined-arms defense, with their cavalry playing a vital role in keeping the Austrians at bay. Fighting resumed early on 22 May, when Napoleon began receiving some reinforcements and decided to attack. The French offensive was quite successful but Napoleon soon received alarming news that the main bridge had broken and consequently, no further reinforcements and ammunition could be brought from the southern bank, making a protracted battle impossible. This prompted the emperor to immediately stop his attack and order a phased retreat onto the large Danube island of Lobau. Given that the Austrians, with their superior numbers and overwhelming artillery firepower, were now intent upon seizing the opportunity to launch a counterattack of their own, retreat was most difficult. It took all the experience of the French commanders and the determination and self-sacrifice of the troops, including the Guard, to fend off the ferocious Austrian onslaught but, by nightfall, the remains of the French forces were safely across the arm of the Danube, on the island of Lobau. Napoleon had suffered the first significant defeat of his career.

=== Towards another battle ===

The Battle of Aspern-Essling was costly for both sides. It resulted in some 53,000 casualties, almost equally divided between the two armies. For the Austrians, Aspern-Essling was a costly victory. Crucially, it improved the overall morale of the troops as it proved that, despite their early string of defeats, the army could fight extremely well and win battles against formidable enemies. However, in the weeks following the battle, Archduke Charles became increasingly skeptical about his chances of winning the war. His analysis of the battle revealed that he had been unable to capitalise on his numerical superiority and had thus failed to achieve more than a tactical victory. Also of great significance, despite Austrian attempts to trumpet their victory against Napoleon, its political consequences remained limited: there were no signs of a general uprising in Germany, Prussia was still unwilling to enter the war and the United Kingdom was not ready to launch its promised land expedition in northern Europe, while Russia, France&#x27;s ally since 1807, was becoming increasingly aggressive against the Austrian forces in Galicia. Thus, Charles&#x27;s skepticism stemmed from the realisation that none of the strategic prerequisites for an Austrian victory in this war had materialised. He came to believe that his country&#x27;s best option was to open negotiations with Napoleon but, despite his warning that &quot;the first battle lost is a death sentence for the monarchy&quot;, his brother, Emperor Francis repeatedly refused to consider the option.

Although a generalissimus, with supreme authority over the entire Austrian army, Charles&#x27;s position was constantly undermined by his imperial brother and the war party at the court, who were corresponding directly on military matters with his chief of staff, &quot;General Major&quot; Wimpffen and some of the corps commanders. The constant flow of information from the front maintained a bellicose atmosphere in the high political circles and an erroneously optimistic opinion about Austria&#x27;s military situation, which hindered Charles&#x27;s best attempts to get his brother to sue for peace.

It thus became clear to the Archduke that another battle would be forthcoming, although he still nourished hopes that Napoleon himself might make peace overtures. Although morale among the rank and file remained fair following Aspern-Essling, the atmosphere among the Austrian senior commanders was particularly rotten and Charles&#x27;s insufficiently assiduous preparations for another battle further sapped their confidence in him. One of the senior generals, Johann von Hiller, commander of VI Korps was overtly critical of Charles&#x27;s strategy and resigned on 4 July, on the eve of the battle of Wagram, giving health reasons as a pretext. Archduke Charles did make considerable efforts to rebuild his army and, despite the slow arrival of reinforcements, by the end of June, it was close to full strength again. Overall, Archduke Charles was well aware that he did not possess the means necessary to lead any offensive actions, so he promptly dismissed suggestions to run any major operations against the French base on Lobau island. A plan to march to Pressburg, cross the Danube and launch operations against the enemy&#x27;s rear from there was also dismissed as strategically unsound after &quot;General Major&quot; Wimpffen noted that such a plan would leave Bohemia, the richest province still under the Austrian Empire&#x27;s control, open to a French invasion. By the end of June, Archduke Charles was still hoping that Napoleon might opt to negotiate, a misapprehension that the latter encouraged through a series of ruses. In the event that a battle would indeed occur, Charles planned to remain on the defensive and thus his actions depended on the moves of the enemy. A member of the House of Habsburg, Archduke Charles saw the army as an invaluable tool, meant to protect the existence of the Monarchy. He was thus a cautious commander, never willing to risk it all in order to obtain a decisive victory, a commitment that he reiterated towards the end of June, when he wrote to his uncle and mentor, Prince Albert of Saxony, Duke of Teschen, stating that, should another battle be unavoidable, he would &quot;strike one more blow against the French&quot; but &quot;risk nothing or as little as possible&quot;. Although he reckoned that Austria would need a major victory in order to turn the tide of the war, he believed that another battle against Napoleon would have doubtful results.
Meanwhile, having retreated to the island of Lobau after the battle of Aspern-Essling, Napoleon knew that he had failed in his attempt to cross the Danube and was so astonished by the severity of the setback that he remained in unaccustomed inaction for 36 hours. After recovering his usual drive, his immediate concern was to improve the dire situation of his army, which was in very bad shape and virtually trapped on Lobau island, after the Danube had swollen. With his usual tireless activity, he supervised the transformation of Lobau island into a huge army base. The French built temporary campaign hospitals for his 20,000 wounded, as well as warehouses and barracks, which sheltered a numerous permanent military garrison. As soon as a secure bridge was built, the Emperor had the wounded and a part of the troops transferred to the mainland, but maintained IV Corps on the island. He did not intend to abandon this position, as he was planning to use it as a springboard for his upcoming crossing. His next task was to rebuild the army. Casualties had been roughly equal to those of the enemy, but, with fewer troops engaged, some of Napoleon&#x27;s battalions needed rebuilding from scratch. Losses in officers in particular had been extremely high and proved difficult to replace. &quot;Maréchal&quot; Jean Lannes, one of Napoleon&#x27;s ablest commanders and a personal friend, had been mortally wounded in action and died nine days after the battle. Another irreplaceable loss was Louis-Vincent-Joseph Le Blond de Saint-Hilaire, who had been created a Marshal of the Empire just a month before, in recognition of his brilliant conduct during the earlier campaign, but received a mortal wound during the battle and died before the coveted baton could arrive from Paris. Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne, another famous general was killed in action at the head of his &quot;cuirassiers&quot; and the commander in chief of the artillery, Nicolas-Marie Songis des Courbons, became severely ill and had to leave his command a few weeks after the battle. Despite all these setbacks, the army and its officers retained total confidence in Napoleon&#x27;s ability to lead them to victory and morale remained high. Evidence of this came a couple of days before the newly planned crossing of the Danube, when Napoleon&#x27;s most senior Corps commander, &quot;Maréchal&quot; André Masséna fell from his horse and badly injured his foot, rendering him unable to ride for some time. In sheer contrast with Hiller&#x27;s gesture, Masséna, although in significant pain, made arrangements to lead his men in battle from a phaeton and vowed to retain his command, much to the Emperor&#x27;s relief.

Napoleon reckoned that he would need careful planning and superior forces, before he could attempt another crossing of the Danube. In order to achieve that, he needed to secure his island-base at Lobau. Following the Emperor&#x27;s orders, the commander of the artillery, General Songis and his successor, General Lariboisière, installed a massive 124-gun battery on the island. They also carefully scouted the shores and small islands of the Danube and installed batteries in strategic positions, in a bid to cover Vienna, but above all with the aim of keeping the enemy guessing about the exact location of the upcoming crossing. The French also needed reliable bridges. Starting work on 1 June, General Bertrand led vast military engineering works that resulted in the building of two strong bridges from the south bank to Lobau island. These were to be used to transfer supplies and troops onto the island. Bertrand secured these bridges against any floating barges that the Austrians might have launched to destroy them, by building palisades upstream. In order to cross from the island to the northern bank, a series of pivoting bridges and landing craft were also built. The French also captured a Danube flotilla and built additional patrol ships, which meant that they were, by the end of June, in almost complete control of the river, allowing Napoleon to write in the Army Bulletin of 2 July that &quot;the Danube no longer exists for the French army&quot;.

==The first day==
=== Preliminaries ===

The Austrian high command was well aware of the French preparations on Lobau island and thus understood that the French attack would come from there. Archduke Charles was however unsure about where the French would cross and, together with his staff reckoned that the crossing would most likely be made from the north of the island, making landfall roughly at the same location as at the Battle of Aspern-Essling. Working on this hypothesis, Charles had a chain of 16 defensive redoubts built, essentially between Aspern and Groß-Enzersdorf. Strangely, he did not extend the earthworks southeast, along the riverline, which meant that the line could be outflanked. Moreover, the redoubts did not provide all-round protection and an Austrian observer noted that only Turks would throw up such poor earthworks. Charles&#x27;s belief that Napoleon would cross north of Lobau seemed to be confirmed on 2 July, when he received news that French forces began to cross the river there. The Austrian commander thought that the battle scenario he had prepared for – a repetition of the battle fought at the end of May – was about to materialise, so he promptly moved his entire force to face the enemy. However, it soon became obvious that the French force was only a small detachment, sent forward to secure a bridgehead.

On 3 July, Archduke Charles finally decided not to fight the enemy near the Danube and retreated to the higher ground overlooking the Marchfeld. This was a major decision, as it meant that the earlier plan to man the 16 redoubts next to the Danube and fight the enemy there was abandoned. Instead, Archduke Charles occupied both the Bisamberg heights and the Wagram plateau behind the Russbach river, covering the retreat routes to Bohemia and Moravia respectively, thus occupying a sound strategic position. Although the army was not strong enough to occupy both positions and no earthworks were provided for the new position, it was thought that, given that the two heights were placed at an angle to one another, any enemy force attacking would find itself placed between two pincers. There was perhaps further justification for this choice on a tactical level: the broken and wooded terrain in the immediate proximity of the Danube was adapted to fighting in open order formations, which were insufficiently mastered by his men, and at which the French were adept. This was, without a doubt, one of the bitter lessons that the Austrians learned at Aspern and Essling. But above all, the cautious Archduke Charles was unwilling to take the risk of committing his forces in such an advanced position, knowing that he would have a hard time extricating them, should retreat have become necessary. He also planned not to face the enemy on the flat plains of the Marchfeld, an ideal cavalry terrain, where the numerically superior French horse would quickly gain the upper hand. The two influential staff officers, Wimpffen and Grünne, had been actively advocating for this position for weeks and this time Charles finally acquiesced to their point of view.

===Opposing plans===

Intelligence received on 4 July informed the Archduke that the French had weakened their position at Pressburg, a clear sign that the enemy would launch its operations very soon. At 07:00 on 4 July, Charles wrote to his brother, Archduke John of Austria, whose secondary army was stationed near Pressburg. Charles informed John that the battle was imminent and that it &quot;will decide the fate of our dynasty&quot;, ordering him to draw closer to the main army by marching to Marchegg, adding that John should leave behind &quot;all baggage and impedimenta&quot;. As chance would have it, heavy thunderstorms delayed delivery of the message, which only got to Archduke John 23 hours later.

Archduke Charles did not seriously consider the possibility that the French could cross elsewhere than north of Lobau island until late on 4 July. When he finally accounted for this scenario, Charles remained faithful to his earlier plan not to move his forces towards the river. Instead, he planned to allow the enemy to move into the Marchfeld, leaving there only the Advance Guard and VI Korps, with orders to delay their deployment, cause disorder and casualties, while gradually moving back. Meanwhile, he was planning to maintain his main body on the naturally strong position on the Wagram plateau, with the rest of his forces further west on the Bisamberg heights, the two positions that Wimpffen and Grünne had favoured all along. Should the French have attempted to attack the forces on the Wagram plateau, the forces present there were expected to resist long enough to allow Charles to fall on the enemy&#x27;s flank with the forces placed the Bisamberg heights. Conversely, should the enemy have attacked the forces on the Bisamberg heights, the main force on the Wagram plateau would have attacked the enemy&#x27;s flank. The plan was good enough, but had two major flaws. Firstly, it failed to account for the slowness of the Austrian staff work, which impaired coordination between these forces. Secondly, it left the Advance Guard and VI Corps with an ambiguous objective: if Charles wanted protracted resistance, then these forces were too weak to accomplish such a task; however, if the objective was only brief resistance, then they were too numerous and thus needlessly exposed.

Meanwhile, the French were getting ready to cross, according to detailed crossing plans drawn in advance by the Chief of Staff of the , &quot;Maréchal&quot; Berthier. Napoleon was aware that the Austrians had thrown earthworks between Aspern and Groß-Enzersdorf and planned to cross southeast of these positions and then outflank the enemy fortified line. This meant, however, that his forces had a much longer march before making contact with the enemy. On 4 July, by nightfall, under the cover of a violent thunderstorm that impeded any Austrian observation, Napoleon gave the order for the commencement of the crossing operations.

=== Across the Danube ===
One French thrust was directed at occupying the strategic Hansel-Grund salient, east of Lobau island, which a brigade under Conroux secured towards 22:00. This allowed the French to deploy three pivoting bridges, which had been prepared in advance and on which other elements of Oudinot&#x27;s II Corps began to cross. Meanwhile, further north, Colonel Sainte-Croix, &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to &quot;Maréchal&quot; Masséna had 1,500 men of IV Corps embarked on landing craft and crossed the river, without meeting any opposition. Sainte-Croix&#x27;s &quot;pontonniers&quot; then started work and, making good use of the current, managed to bridge the arm of the Danube in no more than five minutes, using another pivoting bridge. This allowed Masséna&#x27;s divisions to begin crossing, while the division commanded by Legrand, already on the northern bank since 2 July, made a feint towards Aspern and Essling, in a bid to divert Austrian attention from the actual crossing. Several other bridges were finalised towards 02:00, allowing the bulk of II and III Corps, with their respective artillery, cavalry and equipment trains to cross to the northern bank. Napoleon ordered the &quot;pontonniers&quot; to build three additional bridges and work continued well after dawn on 5 July, after the bulk of the had already crossed the river. The battle had begun.

As the French were crossing east of Lobau island, the only significant Austrian force in the immediate vicinity was Armand von Nordmann&#x27;s Advance Guard, which had been left in the sector with orders to delay the enemy advance. Nordmann&#x27;s men were faced with a massive artillery barrage from French batteries on Lobau island and, with increasing numbers of enemy battalions coming up, Nordmann had no option but to turn north, leaving behind detachments at Sachsengang castle and Gross-Enzersdorf. With most of his troops available by now, Oudinot and his II Corps approached Sachsengang castle and came up against its defenders: two Austrian battalions and a few small-calibre cannon. The French opted against storming the position and instead brought forward their howitzers, in a bid to shell the defenders into submission. Austrian resistance was brief, with the garrison surrendering towards 08:00. Further north, Masséna directed his divisions straight to the strategic village of Gross-Enzersdorf, where the rest of Nordmann&#x27;s rearguard (two battalions from the &quot;Bellegarde&quot; regiment) lay. The village itself constituted a sturdy defensive position and Napoleon himself came forward to inspect it, noticing that it was strong enough to potentially delay the deployment of IV Corps onto the Marchfeld plain beyond. The Emperor thus ordered his heavy batteries on Lobau island, including 22 heavy 16-pounders, 14 mortars and 10 howitzers, to bombard the village. In total, some one thousand shells were fired on Gross-Enzersdorf, with the village quickly becoming engulfed in flames. The commander of Austrian VI Korps, &quot;Feldmarshalleutnant&quot; Klenau, whose force was in the vicinity, also with orders to delay the French advance, tried to relieve the defenders, but they were successfully checked by Jacob François Marulaz&#x27;s French cavalry from IV Corps. With the defenders of the village now cut off and defending what was becoming a burning inferno, Colonel Sainte-Croix assumed command of the 46th Line regiment and stormed the position, taking some 400 prisoners. Further west, the division commanded by Boudet moved against the village of Essling, which fell to the French without much resistance. By 10:00, Napoleon was pleased to notice that the bridgehead had been completely secured and that all enemy attempts to destroy the bridges had failed. Indeed, all Austrian attempts to frustrate the French crossing by using the tactics that worked so well during the Battle of Aspern-Essling – sending barges or trees downstream to ram the bridges – failed utterly on 5 July, because the French flotilla was in full control of the river. This allowed the bulk of Napoleon&#x27;s army to cross to the northern bank of the Danube at great speed and in perfect safety.
Archduke Charles was by now well aware of Napoleon&#x27;s intentions but remained committed to his plan not to fight the battle on the flat Marchfeld plain, where the superior French cavalry would have given Napoleon a clear edge. Thus, Charles did nothing to support his two forward units and watched as Nordmann gradually withdrew north, towards the Russbach line and Klenau withdrew northwest, towards Breintlee. Meanwhile, Napoleon was free to advance north, into the Marchfeld plain, where he would have enough room to deploy his forces. The French advanced in battalion columns, with their front line formed by the Corps of Masséna on the left, Oudinot in the centre and Davout on the right, and the respective Corps cavalry screening the flanks. By noon, the French had advanced into the Marchfeld, a move which so far suited both commanders.

=== Clashes on the Marchfeld ===
As the French were successfully moving forward, the Austrian Advance Guard, under &quot;Feldmareschalleutnant&quot; Nordmann, supported by &quot;Feldmareschalleutnant&quot; Klenau&#x27;s VI Korps, in all 25,000 infantrymen, were gradually withdrawing northwards. The Austrian infantry were formed in masses, a formation that had proved very efficient in fending off cavalry, but whose compact ranks made it extremely vulnerable to artillery fire. Casualties began to mount at an alarming rate and Nordmann&#x27;s infantry, initially 12,000 men strong, was particularly exposed to artillery fire during its retreat towards Grosshofen. Additionally, towards 13:00, Nordmann became extremely concerned that the numerous French cavalry, might cut him off from the rest of the army. Seeing the dangerous situation of his Advance Guard, Archduke Charles ordered Liechtenstein to the rescue of these infantrymen with five cavalry regiments. Liechtenstein moved swiftly towards the east with his squadrons, arriving in the vicinity of Glinzendorf, but then remained passive, while the French, who now had a numerous combined-arms presence there, were able to continue their advance unmolested. The first serious Austrian attempt to slow down the French onslaught came towards 15:00, when Liechtenstein and Nordmann tried to organise a joint operation, but they gave up quite early on, realising that they were opposed by a very powerful force of several infantry divisions and three cavalry divisions from &quot;Maréchal&quot; Davout&#x27;s III French Corps. The Austrians pulled back, leaving Davout free to position his men between Glinzendorf and Raasdorf, thus drawing closer to the II Corps.
Further west, &quot;Maréchal&quot; Bernadotte&#x27;s IX Corps had been steadily advancing, with the French II Corps on their right, but began to meet steady resistance, when troops from Nordmann&#x27;s Corps decided to make a stand. These men were from Riese&#x27;s brigade, soon reinforced by the 13th Wallachian-Illyrian &quot;Grenzer&quot; and Infantry Regiment 46 &quot;Chasteler&quot;. Bernadotte sent forward the two battalions of the 5th Light regiment, which successfully pushed back the opposition, allowing the rest of his Corps to continue its advance towards the village of Aderklaa, near which they had to stop, towards 15:30, as they met enemy cavalry. Towards 17:00, in an attempt to secure the vital position at Aderklaa, the Austrians launched a cavalry attack with the brigade of French &quot;émigré&quot; Roussel d&#x27;Hurbal. This heavy cavalry brigade, around 1,000 sabres strong, deployed on two lines, with the 3rd &quot;Herzog Albert&quot; Cuirassiers on the left and the 2nd &quot;Erzherzog Franz&quot; Cuirassiers on the right. D&#x27;Hurbal was suddenly charged by the 400 cavalrymen from the Saxon &quot;Prinz Klemens Chevaulegers&quot; regiment from Bernadotte&#x27;s Corps, who had recklessly moved forward unsupported. D&#x27;Hurbal&#x27;s cuirassiers stood to receive the charge and repulsed them by firing a pistol volley from 30 meters. This practice that was highly unusual for the cavalry tactics of the time but in this case it worked perfectly, with the Saxon chevaulegers sent fleeing. The Saxons then brought up the bulk of their cavalry, in echelon formation, with the right leading. D&#x27;Hurbal again chose to meet them with a pistol volley but this time the Saxons managed to maintain the impetus of their charge and crashed into the Austrian cuirassiers. Amongst the Saxon cavalry was a single squadron of the &quot;Herzog Albrecht Chevaulegers&quot; regiment, which shared the same Regimental Proprietor with the Austrian &quot;Herzog Albert&quot; cuirassiers and these units fought in a generalized melee that involved the entire cavalry present. After a few minutes, d&#x27;Hurbal&#x27;s Austrians were beaten back and pursued, until they were rescued by Lederer&#x27;s cuirassier brigade. After this cavalry action, Prince Liechtenstein decided that he had lost too many men to no avail and consequently pulled the bulk of his forces back to safety, behind the Wagram-Gerasdorf line, leaving five cavalry regiments with the IV Korps at Markgrafneusiedl.

Meanwhile, Nordmann&#x27;s slow retreat allowed Klenau&#x27;s VI Austrian Korps, which had also been placed in an advanced position, to make a skillful fighting retreat westwards, taking few losses. In sharp contrast, Nordmann&#x27;s Advance Guard suffered horrendous losses, with its initial 12,000 infantry reduced to little more than 6,000 soldiers capable of further action. This unusually high casualty rate resulted from Nordmann having been positioned in a perilous location and having been maintained there for too long, to little purpose. Additionally, Nordmann had benefitted from little protection from the cavalry present in that sector. After a well-led and determined staged retreat, Nordmann managed to extricate his battered troops, reaching the relative safety of the town of Markgrafneusiedl. The Advance Guard continued to constitute a viable fighting force and they were thus integrated in the IV Korps, guarding the Austrian left wing. The Austrian army was now deployed on a very wide ark-shaped frontage, long, including Klenau&#x27;s VI Korps on the far right, then Kollowrat&#x27;s III Korps on the right-centre, Hohenzollern&#x27;s II Korps and Bellegarde&#x27;s I Korps behind the Russbach line in central position, while Rosenberg&#x27;s IV Korps covered the left. Liechtenstein&#x27;s Grenadier Reserve divisions were placed in second line, with the Cavalry Reserve in a central position next to the village of Wagram.

Opposite to the Austrians lay the French Army, which managed to fully deploy towards 18:00. From left to right, the French army included: Masséna&#x27;s IV Corps, covering a wide area between the Danube and Süssenbrunn, the lead elements of Bernadotte&#x27;s XI Corps (Dupas&#x27;s division) near Aderklaa, Viceroy Eugène&#x27;s &quot;Army of Italy&quot; in the centre, while Oudinot&#x27;s II Corps was deployed opposite to Baumersdorf and Davout&#x27;s III Corps continued the French line eastwards, beyond Glinzendorf. The rest of the French and Allied troops, including the Imperial Guard and &quot;Maréchal&quot; Bessières&#x27;s Cavalry Reserve, were in second line. Napoleon had a sound strategic position, as he was holding the central position and had a much shorter line than his opponent.

=== The evening attacks ===

After the successful crossing of the Danube and deployment of his army on the Marchfeld plain, Napoleon achieved his primary goal for the day. Nevertheless, towards 18:00, either because he was dissatisfied with the result of the first engagements or because he was fearing that the enemy might retreat under the cover of darkness, the Emperor began issuing orders for an immediate attack. Never a man to lose time, Napoleon probably noted that the sun was still high on the sky, that the Austrian right wing was placed noticeably far away from the main body, and that there was still no sign of the arrival of Archduke John&#x27;s army from the east. This attack was also meant to probe the strength and resolution of the enemy, as the Emperor did not know exactly what forces lay before him. The attack was to take place against the Russbach line on a wide front, between Wagram and Markgrafneusiedl, with Bernadotte, Eugène, Oudinot and Davout all ordered forward. Nevertheless, the French troops were all very tired and the most difficult tasks were assigned to some of the weakest troops available, namely elements of the Corps of Bernadotte and Oudinot. Additionally, with the Emperor ordering an immediate attack, the General Staff failed to transmit the orders to the respective commanders in due time, which resulted in a failure to launch synchronized actions.

An artillery bombardment, between 19:00 and 19:30 opened up the French attack, with Oudinot launching a part of his II Corps against the Austrian II Korps under Prince Hohenzollern. The Austrian defenders were prepared for the attack: Hohenzollern had deployed his men in two lines, with a heavy skirmisher screen and was occupying a naturally strong position, which had been reinforced with earthworks. The Austrian Korps had also deployed its powerful artillery of 68 pieces. Nevertheless, the French crossed the Russbach stream, spearheaded by Frère&#x27;s division, which managed to reach the outskirts of the small village of Baumersdorf. This village, consisting of no more than 30 wooden houses and a bridge, soon caught fire from the French artillery bombardment, but the Austrian defenders from Hardegg&#x27;s brigade (8th &quot;Jäger&quot; regiment and a battalion of Volunteers from the &quot;Erzherzog Karl Legion&quot;) stood their ground, despite the flames. Unable to storm the position with Frère&#x27;s division, Oudinot launched a flanking attack to the right of the village, with some of his best troops: the 57th Line regiment (styled &quot;the Terrible&quot;) and the 10th Light regiment, both from Grandjean&#x27;s division. The 57th Line valiantly assaulted the village from the east and occupied its first houses, where they had to stop. Meanwhile, the 10th Light crossed the Russbach downstream and, after passing through the boggy terrain below the escarpment, began to make its way up the slope. As the 10th Light was coming up towards the village, they were at first greeted with intense artillery fire and then Buresch&#x27;s brigade released some heavy musketry upon them. This disordered the ranks of the French regiment, which began to waver and the last straw came when they saw Prince Hohenzollern personally leading the 500 cavalrymen from the &quot;Vincent Chevaulegers&quot; regiment against them: the 10th Light panicked and fled, taking the 57th Line with them. After a disorderly retreat, the two regiments stopped and reformed when they met the steady ranks of the Imperial Guard, towards Raasdorf. By now, it was past 20:00, night was falling and Oudinot had been repulsed with significant losses.
While Oudinot was engaged with Hohenzollern at Baumersdorf, to the west, &quot;Général de Division&quot; Jacques MacDonald, commander of the V Corps of the &quot;Army of Italy&quot; launched his men in an assault on the Wagram plateau. With the village of Baumersdorf in flames and a gentle breeze blowing from the east, the advance of the French troops was masked by heavy smoke. Dupas&#x27;s division, temporarily attached to the &quot;Army of Italy&quot;, spearheaded this attack and, as chance would have it, happened to get between the Austrian 1st and II Korps and was thus free to advance unmolested on Deutsch-Wagram from the east. Attacking Dedovich&#x27;s division at Deutsch-Wagram, Dupas&#x27;s small Franco-Saxon division was soon supported by Lamarque&#x27;s division, personally led by MacDonald, with the divisions of Seras, Durutte and Sahuc, all from Paul Grenier&#x27;s VI Corps, also coming up in support. Seeing the French advance, the Austrian artillerymen panicked and abandoned their guns, with the infantry regiments 35 and 47 (&quot;Vogelsang&quot;) also retreating in some disorder. &quot;General der Kavallerie&quot; Bellegarde intervened in person, maneuvering to refuse his flank to the enemy, with the French advance also faltering, due to heavy smoke. With visibility reduced, the French mistook the white uniforms of their Saxon allies from the Schützen and Grenadier battalions, believing them to be Austrians and promptly firing at them, which triggered a precipitated retreat of these men. With Archduke Charles now personally present to reestablish order, the morale of the Austrians soared and a vigorous joint attack by infantry regiment 42 (&quot;Erbach&quot;), joined by Hohenzollern&#x27;s &quot;Vincent Chevaulegers&quot; and &quot;Hessen-Homburg&quot; Hussars repulsed the French attackers, pushing them beyond the Russbach and to their initial positions. Bellegarde&#x27;s good maneuver and Archduke Charles&#x27;s inspired intervention ensured a totally successful counterattack, and avoided what could have developed into a dangerous situation for the Austrian army. Opposite to them, both the Saxons, who had suffered high casualties, and the French troops were retreating in complete disorder and halted only near Raasdorf.

To the west, &quot;Maréchal&quot; Bernadotte, in command of the Saxon IX Corps, was preparing his own assault, planning to attack the Austrians at Deutsch-Wagram from the west. This attack was delayed, as Bernadotte had to wait for the arrival of Zezschwitz&#x27;s division, but at around 21:00 the Saxons moved towards the village. As Lecoq&#x27;s Saxon brigade approached the position, they were instantly met with sustained musketry fire from the Austrian defenders, two battalions of infantry regiment 17 (&quot;Reuss-Plauen&quot;) and the 2nd &quot;Jäger&quot; regiment, but the Saxons pushed on and entered the village. Once they reached the vicinity of the village church, the Saxons were steadily met by the third battalion of infantry regiment 17 and the attack at once broke down, with the attackers forced to take shelter in the buildings nearby. Moments later, Zeschau&#x27;s Saxon brigade, with Prince Maximilian&#x27;s regiment attached to it, came in support, but these troops had been much disordered when crossing the Russbach, and upon entering the smoke filled streets of the village, they too lost impetus. With visibility much reduced by smoke, the situation at Deutsch-Wagram soon turned into chaos as all the troops inside spoke German and all, except the Austrian &quot;Jägers&quot;, wore white uniforms. There were thus several instances in which Saxon troops fired at each other and their situation took a turn for the worse towards 22:30, when &quot;Generalmajor&quot; Hartizsch brought fresh Saxon troops against the position. Hartizsch was not informed that friendly troops were already in the village and, as he was coming up for the attack, he saw a large number of white-coats moving out of the position. The commander at once ordered his men to fire and minutes of friendly fire and hand-to-hand combat ensued before it became obvious that these men were actually Saxons too. This fortuitous event had a significant impact on the attack, as the Saxons in the village now thought themselves surrounded and at once broke and retreated in disorder. The Saxon troops of the IX Corps were now completely demoralised and any attempts to rally and reform them at Aderklaa towards 23:00 failed.

A final French attack was launched by Davout&#x27;s III Corps, on the French right. Just like Bernadotte&#x27;s, this action began later than expected, towards 21:00, with Davout&#x27;s men tired after a day of marching and fighting. The French objective in this sector was to attack the naturally strong position at Markgrafneusiedl, which had been reinforced with earthworks and was defended by the rested troops of &quot;Feldmarschalleutnant&quot; Rosenberg of the Austrian IV Army Korps. After a short artillery bombardment, Davout sent the divisions of Friant and Morand across the Russbach stream, in a flanking attack from the east, while his other two divisions, under Gudin and Puthod were ordered to attack frontally, through the village of Grosshofen. Davout also sent a part of his cavalry to open the way for the infantry attack but the Austrian cavalry under Nostitz promptly repulsed the French horse. Realising the futility of his action, Davout called off his infantry attack towards 22:00, leaving only his artillery to exchange fire with the Austrian gunners. Davout&#x27;s initiative to call off his attack early on triggered subsequent, perhaps unwarranted, criticism from Napoleon.

=== The night of 5 to 6 July ===

With the fighting fading out completely towards 23:00, the two commanders were at their respective headquarters, knowing that the following day would be decisive for the outcome of the battle. Meanwhile, with an extremely cold night settling in, soldiers from both armies lit fires to warm up, while they were resting and consuming their modest rations.

Late that night, the French Corps commanders reunited at the Emperor&#x27;s headquarters at Raasdorf; only Bernadotte was absent, as he was still struggling to rally his routed infantry at Aderklaa. Napoleon knew that he had sustained high losses during the evening attacks and that he had failed in his attempt at a quick breakthrough. As many as 11,000 French and Allies were out of action, including Paul Grenier, commander of VI Corps, who had suffered a shattered hand and was out of action for the next day. Despite these setbacks, the Emperor had managed to fix the enemy forces and was now certain that Archduke Charles was ready to give battle on his current positions. For the second day of battle, Napoleon planned a main attack against the enemy left, which was to be conducted by the powerful III Corps under &quot;Maréchal&quot; Davout, who was ordered to attack the enemy on the plateau behind the Russbach stream, storm the strategic village of Markgrafneusiedl and then roll up the enemy flank. Such an action, if successful, would have compromised the position of the other Austrian Korps on the Wagram plateau and would have forced them back northwestwards, away from any reinforcements they might have expected to receive from Pressburg. Napoleon also planned for his II and IX Corps, as well as the &quot;Army of Italy&quot; to launch secondary attacks, in order to prevent the Austrians from sending reinforcements to their left. In order to shorten and reinforce his battle line, the Emperor also ordered that most of the IV Corps move closer to Aderklaa, with this Corps set to take its new positions towards 02:00 that night. This meant that only Boudet&#x27;s division was left at Aspern, with orders to defend the lines of communication lines with the military base on Lobau island. The Imperial Guard, Cavalry Reserve and the reinforcements that Napoleon was expecting were to form the battle reserve of the army.
After the conference, Napoleon asked Davout to stay on and the two spent a long time planning Davout&#x27;s difficult and complex attack on the fortified position at Markgrafneusiedl, an action which the Emperor saw as decisive for the battle to come. Napoleon was expecting reinforcements: the French XI Corps under Marmont, the divisions of Broussier and Pacthod from the &quot;Army of Italy&quot;, as well as the Bavarian division under Wrede, which were approaching the battlefield that night. These reinforcements placed the French and Allied forces at 140,500 infantry, 28,000 cavalry and 488 guns, with an additional 8,500 men and 129 guns left behind as garrison on Lobau island.

Archduke Charles of Austria was also planning the next day of battle, at his headquarters in Deutsch-Wagram. Charles was exhausted and had been lightly wounded when he took personal command of a regiment during the critical moments of the battle, but overall he was probably satisfied with the result of the first day of battle. Despite heavy losses (some 6,000 infantrymen) in von Nordmann&#x27;s Advance Guard, the other formations of the Austrian army were virtually intact. Charles probably noted that, while the enemy managed to deploy on the Marchfeld plain with a surprising speed, all was going according to plan, as it had always been his intention to face them here. Additionally, with the exception of Nordmann&#x27;s Advance Guard, losses had been relatively moderate and overall the army had fought extremely well. He reckoned that his best option was to take the initiative and, as he later wrote: &quot;seize the only means which could give any prospect of success against the superior enemy, namely to fall on them by surprise on all sides as day broke&quot;. Orders for an all-out attack at 04:00 were issued at around midnight and Charles&#x27;s intention was to take advantage of his much longer battle line (around 18 kilometers long, to the French 10 kilometers long line) and take the enemy in a double envelopment. To that effect, VI Korps was ordered to advance on Aspern, with the fresh troops of III Korps on their left, moving through Leopoldau towards Breitenlee, and the Grenadier Reserve was to move through Süssenbrunn. These three Corps were also ordered to keep in line with each other, with the Cavalry Reserve ordered to take position between Süssenbrunn and Aderklaa. The Austrian 1st Korps was to move out of Wagram and advance along the Russbach, with II Korps ordered to remain in place, in order to avoid congestion, and simply provide artillery support. On the Austrian left, IV Korps, with the Advance Guard now attached to it, was to move against the French III Corps, and it was expected that Archduke John&#x27;s &quot;Army of Inner Austria&quot; would arrive from Pressburg in time to support this attack. There would be no proper battle reserve, with the only remaining formation, Prince Reuss&#x27;s small V Korps left out of the action, as a strategic reserve, with the objective of observing the Danube and protecting the vital routes to Bohemia and Moravia, should retreat become necessary.

Coordination between the Korps&#x27; movements was vital for the success of this plan, yet this was something that the Austrian army command and control system had repeatedly failed to achieve during past conflicts. As a result, the two Corps that were farthest from headquarters, VI and III Korps, only received their orders towards 03:00, two hours late. Given the distance that these troops had to march in order to make contact with the enemy, it was clear to the two Korps commanders that they would be unable to attack at 4:00 as ordered. Archduke Charles was also expecting the arrival of reinforcements, 13,000 men of the &quot;Army of Inner Austria&quot; led by his brother, Archduke John, whose role was crucial in supporting the attack against the French right. While Charles thought that his brother should arrive on the field of battle at any moment, the latter actually only began his march of march from Pressburg at around 01:00 that night. Without Archduke John&#x27;s men, the Austrians could muster only 113,500 infantry, 14,600 cavalry and 414 guns for the second day of battle.

==The second day==
=== Rosenberg&#x27;s attack ===
Positioned on the left of the Austrian army, in and around the strategic village of Markgrafneusiedl, &quot;Feldmarschalleutnant&quot; Prince Rosenberg-Orsini was in command of the 18,140 men and 60 cannons of the IV Korps. In addition, attached to his force was the much-battered Advance Guard, under &quot;Feldmarschalleutnant&quot; Nordmann, reduced to around 6,000 infantrymen and some cavalry support, as well as the 3,120 cavalrymen from &quot;Feldmarschalleutnant&quot; Nostitz&#x27;s division. Receiving his orders in due time, Rosenberg began to organise his attack, forming the IV Korps into three large columns, preceded by an advance guard. The first column was formed by Hessen-Homburg&#x27;s brigade, 6 battalions strong, which was directed towards the village of Grosshofen. The second column was 16 battalions strong (12 regular and four &quot;Landwehr&quot; battalions) and included the brigades of Swinburn and Weiss, with the orders to move on to Glinzendorf. The second column was preceded by an advance guard under &quot;Feldmarschalleutnant&quot; Radetzky, 10 battalions and 10 cavalry squadrons strong. The third column, under Nostitz, was 30 squadrons strong and was directed to outflank the French, towards Leopoldsdorf. Setting these troops in motion towards 4:00, just as his orders stated, Rosenberg instructed his commanders to maintain absolute silence among the rank and file as they advanced but, despite this, the troops moved forward in some disorder and with a lot of noise.
Opposite to them lay the III Corps, perhaps the finest of the French army, under the command of &quot;Maréchal&quot; Davout. Davout was in command of 31,600 infantry (divisions of Morand, Friant, Gudin and Puthod), 6,200 cavalry (divisions of Grouchy, Pully and Montbrun) and 120 cannon. Davout was unaware that the Austrians were moving to attack him, but he was himself preparing his attack, and thus his troops were ready for action. Puthod&#x27;s leading elements, one regiment strong, were at Grosshofen, with Gudin positioned between this village and Glinzendorf, which was held by Friant, supported by Morand. The entire cavalry was positioned to protect the right flank of the Corps. To the French surprise, towards 05:00, the Austrians attacked, with Radetzky&#x27;s leading elements pushing the French outposts out of Grosshofen, and then attacking Glinzendorf. Davout immediately ordered a counterattack on Grosshofen, with Puthod attacking frontally and Gudin from the flank, and made sure that the defenders of Glinzendorf steadfastly hold their ground, while releasing heavy musketry upon the slowly advancing enemy columns. Grouchy&#x27;s dragoons rode to face the enemy cavalry column, while Montbrun sent a part of his light cavalry division towards Ober Sieberbrunn, in a bid to outflank the Austrians. The sound of the cannon coming from Davout&#x27;s sector interrupted Napoleon&#x27;s breakfast, with the Emperor thinking that Archduke John must have arrived on the field of battle with his forces. The threat of Archduke John&#x27;s arrival was overestimated, since French intelligence inaccurately placed the strength of this army at 30,000 men, instead of its actual 13,000 men. Napoleon immediately ordered Nansouty&#x27;s and Arrighi&#x27;s heavy cavalry divisions from the Cavalry Reserve to that sector, followed by the Imperial Guard. Nansouty&#x27;s horse artillery was the first to arrive and deployed on the right flank of the advancing Austrians, opening enfilade fire.

Meanwhile, Archduke Charles was observing the entire operation. With Archduke John&#x27;s reinforcements failing to materialise from the east and no sign of the III and VI Korps approaching from the west to take their intended positions, Charles realised that the unsupported Rosenberg was now too exposed and in an increasingly dangerous position. Charles thus ordered Rosenberg to fall back to his initial position at Markgrafneusiedl and assume a defensive posture there. This was no easy task and it took all the determination and skill of &quot;Feldmarschalleutnant&quot; Radetzky in coordinating a combined-arms operation to slow down the French onslaught, while the rest of Rosenberg&#x27;s troops retreated. By 06:00, Rosenberg was finally back to his initial positions, but his two-hour action had cost him no less than 1,100 casualties.

Napoleon, who was by now present alongside Davout, reconnoitered the situation and, seeing that Archduke John&#x27;s army was nowhere near the battlefield, ordered the reserves back to Raasdorf, leaving only Arrighi&#x27;s cuirassiers and a battery of 12-pounders with III Corps. The Emperor reconfirmed that he wanted Davout to take Markgrafneusiedl, but, instead of a massive frontal attack, he instructed the Marshal to launch a part of his men frontally against the position and a part in an enveloping move from the east, in order to take advantage of the gentle slope there. These new orders meant that Davout could not start his attack right away, as he needed to send a part of his troops east, where he had to bridge the Russbach stream, in order to allow his artillery to cross. Napoleon then issued orders to Oudinot and Eugène, instructing them to support Davout by pinning down the Austrian forces on the Russbach, once the IIIrd Corps began its attack.

=== Crisis at Aderklaa ===

While Rosenberg was attacking on the left, &quot;General der Kavallerie&quot; Bellegarde, commander of the Austrian 1st Korps, also set his men in motion in time, just as his orders stated. He had begun his manoeuvre just after 03:00, moving south, out of his position along the Russbach line and at Deutsch-Wagram, Bellegarde formed a vanguard of three battalions and three squadrons, under the command of &quot;General-Major&quot; Stutterheim, which he sent towards Aderklaa. A strategic village that was surrounded by an earthwork, Aderklaa offered a strong defensive position and Bellegarde was naturally expecting to encounter stiff resistance from the enemy defending the village. He was much surprised to receive reports that the village was completely undefended and, after making sure that it was not a trap, Bellegarde immediately ordered his vanguard to occupy it. The 1st Korps commander then brought an additional force of 12 battalions of &quot;Feldmarshalleutnant&quot; Fresnel&#x27;s division, which he deployed in two lines, behind the position and formed the rest of his Corps in a line between Aderklaa and Deutsch-Wagram. Liechtenstein&#x27;s cavalry duly came up in support, taking a wide position behind 1st Korps, between Deutsch-Wagram and Süssenbrunn, but Bellegarde chose not move beyond Aderklaa. An immediate Austrian attack would have posed a serious threat to the stability of the French left wing, but Bellegarde had orders which stated that he needed to wait for the Grenadier Reserve to arrive and align itself on his right.
The task of defending Aderklaa belonged to &quot;Maréchal&quot; Bernadotte, commander of the Saxon IX Corps. However, Bernadotte&#x27;s largely inexperienced infantry had suffered greatly during the evening attacks the day before and many units had routed, retreating beyond Aderklaa. With his infantry reduced to some 6,000 men, the commander had difficulties rallying a part of his troop but he could still count on two reasonably valid Saxon divisions. As he would later explain, Bernadotte believed himself in an exposed position and thus took the initiative of abandoning Aderklaa during the night, retreating almost 1 kilometer to the southeast of the village, in a bid to draw closer to the rest of the army. Withdrawing without permission and without notifying Napoleon of his action, Bernadotte irresponsibly compromised the entire French position on the left. Towards 04:00, seeing that the enemy had taken position in and around the village, Bernadotte assembled his artillery in a battery of 26 pieces, which began to bombard Aderklaa, but the Austrian heavy artillery at Deutsch-Wagram responded by releasing a devastating counter-battery fire, which knocked out 15 Saxon pieces during the following three hours.

Meanwhile, an injured Masséna, leading his IV Corps from a conspicuous white phaeton, was also executing his orders and approaching the sector with three of his infantry divisions and his cavalry. In compliance with Napoleon&#x27;s orders, Masséna&#x27;s fourth infantry division, under General Boudet, had been left far to the south, defending the village of Aspern. The manoeuvre of IV Corps was hampered by the arrival of the leading battalions of the d&#x27;Aspré&#x27;s division from the Austrian Grenadier Reserve, which delayed Masséna&#x27;s rearguard division, under General Legrand. Arriving with his other two divisions in the vicinity of Aderklaa towards 07:30, Masséna was spotted by Napoleon, who got into the Marshal&#x27;s phaeton to consult with him about the situation they were facing and, after a brief discussion, the Emperor ordered the recapture of Aderklaa. Masséna instructed General Carra Saint-Cyr to storm Aderklaa with his division and, seeing that the General delayed his action, trying to find a weak spot of the solid position, the Marshal hurried him forward for an immediate attack. The assault was led by the 24th Light and 4th Line regiments, which were followed by the excellent Hessian Guard brigade. Further east, the still combat-worthy Saxon Corps, including the Franco-Saxon division of General Dupas also moved forward, in a bid to launch a supporting attack between Aderklaa and Deutsch-Wagram. The 24th Light and 4th Line successfully drove back the two Austrian battalions positioned before the village, which broke and caused some disorder in the Austrian first line. The French impetuously moved into Aderklaa and then tried to launch a pursuit beyond this position, but, as soon as they moved out of the village, they were met with sustained fire from Bellegarde&#x27;s second infantry line. The two regiments withdrew to Aderklaa, where they were reinforced by the Hessian Guard brigade and ordered to hold the position. Not far away from this position, the attack of the Saxons also came to a grinding halt and these men were driven back, exposing the flank of the French troops occupying Aderklaa. At this moment, the Austrians enjoyed a substantial, albeit temporary numerical advantage in this sector, 44,000 men to the French 35,000. This was thus the right time for a general attack, but the Austrian military doctrine discouraged commanders from taking too much initiative, and Bellegarde chose to stick to his orders and wait for III Korps, whose leading elements were only just coming up, in line with the Grenadiers.
Archduke Charles noticed the development on his right, from his observation post at Baumersdorf and promptly rode to Bellegarde with new orders. Charles then personally organised an attack on Aderklaa, with the combined elements of infantry regiment 42 (&quot;Erbach&quot;) of the 1st Korps and Grenadier battalions &quot;Scovaud&quot;, &quot;Jambline&quot; and &quot;Brzeczinski&quot; from the Reserve Korps. The &quot;Klenau Chevaulegers&quot; from Liechtenstein&#x27;s cavalry also charged in support of the infantry. This powerful attack drove Carra Saint-Cyr&#x27;s defenders out of Aderklaa and the cavalry attack resulted in them joining the panic-stricken Saxons in a disorderly retreat. Masséna&#x27;s cavalry, under Lasalle and Marulaz promptly stepped in to protect the retreating infantry, driving off the Austrian horse and then charging the artillery that the Austrians were preparing to deploy in front of Aderklaa. The Austrian gunners abandoned their pieces and fled, but Liechtenstein committed additional cavalry, which at once repulsed the French horsemen. Meanwhile, Masséna was preparing to retake Aderklaa with the division of Molitor, spearheaded by Leguay&#x27;s brigade and the 67th Line regiment. These men soon found their advance barred by a crowd of retreating Saxons, with Masséna forced to order his men to fire at them, in order to clear the way. Molitor decidedly advanced towards his objective, despite the enemy fire and cavalry threatening his flanks and, after some bitter fighting, managed to retake the village towards 09:45.

Nevertheless, the Austrians had sufficient fresh troops in this sector and they soon launched fresh attacks, with elements of 1st Korps and the Grenadier Reserve. Despite having taken heavy casualties during his attack, Molitor resolutely defended the position and it took the numerous Austrians in the sector two full hours before they were able to finally expel him. As for the Saxons and great many Frenchmen, they continued their retreat, with the first fugitives and Bernadotte approaching Raasdorf, where they suddenly met Napoleon in person. For the Emperor, the sight of Bernadotte riding at the head of the disorderly mob and making no apparent attempt to rally his men, was the last straw. After a brief exchange of words, Napoleon sacked the Marshal, adding &quot;A bungler like you is no good to me.&quot; The Saxon infantry was by then completely disorganised and it could play no further role in the battle, with only the cavalry and ten cannon still combat-worthy. By mid afternoon, some 12,000 panicked stragglers, French and Saxon were milling in the town of Raasdorf. The French centre-left was at breaking point.

=== Klenau&#x27;s flank march ===

In application of Archduke Charles&#x27;s plan to take the enemy in a double envelopment, &quot;Feldmarshalleutnant&quot; Klenau, commanding VI Korps, and &quot;Feldzeugmeister&quot; Kollowrat, commanding III Korps, moved forward towards the French left. Both commanders had received their orders very late and both had a long distance to cover before they could reach their assigned positions. They did their best to comply but, given the difficulties of a long night march, their leading elements could only manage to arrive on the Austrian right between 07:30 and 08:00, three hours later than Charles had planned.

Klenau was the first to make contact with the enemy. His troops left Leopoldau towards 07:30 and subsequently deployed between Breitenlee and Hirschstetten, driving in the enemy outposts in the sector. The only French force present here was the 4th division of the IV Corps, under &quot;Général de Division&quot; Boudet, some 4,600 men, to Klenau&#x27;s 14,000. At 08:00, Klenau unlimbered his artillery and began to fire at the French, while sending forward Vecsey&#x27;s brigade from &quot;Feldmarshalleutnant&quot; Vincent&#x27;s division to take the village of Aspern. Boudet saw this development and sent forward a battery of ten cannon, with orders to open enfilade fire and thus delay the enemy. This proved to be a very uninspired move, as Austrian hussars suddenly came up and captured these guns. The French 56th Line regiment boldly charged the enemy horse and momentarily recaptured the guns, but they lacked horses to carry them back and the intense Austrian cannonade soon compelled these men to retreat and leave behind the artillery. After making a timid attempt to defend Aspern with the 93rd Line, Boudet then chose to retreat towards Essling and Vincent&#x27;s division occupied Aspern, subsequently launching a determined pursuit. The Austrians soon came in range of the French heavy batteries placed on Lobau island, and the bombardment slowed down their advance, but they still pushed on towards Essling, which Boudet promptly abandoned towards 10:00.

The French retreated towards the Mühlau salient and to Groß-Enzersdorf, in a bid to protect the vital bridges towards Lobau island. The Austrians then launched a probing attack on the bridgehead but were rapidly repulsed and subsequently contented themselves with bombarding the French supply train, causing some panic among the civilian suppliers. From his current position, Klenau was able to either strike in the undefended rear of the enemy army, some five kilometers away, or to attack the vital bridges towards Lobau island. However, the Austrian commander chose caution; his force was only about 14,000 men strong, a part of which was now in range of the numerous French heavy batteries on Lobau island and his orders provided for his Korps to keep itself abreast with Kollowrat&#x27;s III Korps. Had Kollowrat moved forward himself, protecting Klenau&#x27;s left flank, the Austrian VI Korps might have envisaged the continuation of its action, but, as things were, Kollowrat had not yet moved from his position between Süssenbrunn and Breintlee.

Indeed, further north, Kollowrat had been slow in moving forward with his numerous III Korps. He deployed between the villages of Süssenbrunn and Breintlee and thus threatened the French flank, which was defended only by Legrand&#x27;s infantry division and some cavalry. Kollowrat finished his positioning manoeuvres only towards 09:30, when his men made contact with Prochaska&#x27;s Grenadier division of Liechtenstein&#x27;s Reserve Korps. For lack of orders, Kollowrat did not attempt an attack against the weak French left. In a move which was typical for Austrian tactics at the time, the 60-year-old Austrian commander had been busy securing his own rear, rather than thinking of any offensive action. He had cautiously left behind an entire brigade on the Bissamberg heights, facing Vienna, and detailed a sizable force to garrison Gerasdorf, a village situated in his rear. He also sent a combined-arms force to occupy the village of Breintlee, to the south. Despite his sound tactical position, which allowed him to envelop Masséna&#x27;s flank or even march towards the undefended Raasdorf, in the rear of the French army, Kollowrat moved forward cautiously, contenting himself with bombarding Masséna&#x27;s force with two batteries that he had positioned near Breintlee.

=== The French reaction ===

With the situation looking increasingly dangerous for his army, Napoleon reassessed the developments and probably noted that he was holding the central position of an increasingly curved battlefront. He first sent word to Davout to hasten his attack preparations against the Austrian left, but the most urgent matter was to stabilise his own battered left wing. The Emperor did not want to commit his valuable, fresh infantry reserves just yet, so he ordered Masséna to break contact with the enemy and take his IV Corps southwards and attack the Austrian VI Korps. Executing such a manoeuvre required great skill and incurred high risks, as it meant that Masséna&#x27;s men would have to move in vulnerable march column formations, through a sector with numerous enemy infantry, cavalry and artillery. The departure of these troops also meant that an enormous gap would open up in the French line, which the Emperor ingeniously intended to fill by forming an enormous grand battery, which would check enemy advance in this sector through a sustained artillery barrage. This required time and, with the Austrians from III Korps menacingly moving forward, Napoleon counted on &quot;Maréchal&quot; Bessières&#x27;s cavalry to allow Masséna to disengage and the grand battery to deploy.

Towards 11:00, Bessières received his orders, which provided for an immediate attack at the weak point of the enemy line, the seam between Austrian III Korps and the Reserve Korps, where only &quot;Feldmarshalleutnant&quot; Prochaska&#x27;s thinly spread division was covering the wide position between Süssenbrunn and Aderklaa. With the division of Arrighi sent in support of Davout, far on the right flank and the division of Saint-Sulpice detailed to protect Masséna&#x27;s IV Corps, Bessières brought forward his only remaining unit, the mighty 1st heavy cavalry division, under the skilled 41-year-old general Nansouty. Napoleon also sent orders for the Guard cavalry to come in support, but his orders seem not to have reached them at all. Circumstances were so dire on the French left that Bessières opted not to wait for the Guard cavalry and sent orders for an immediate charge.
It seems that Saint-Germain&#x27;s brigade was left behind in reserve and out of the actual attack, so Bessières took Nansouty&#x27;s remaining 16 squadrons, some 2,800 men, including Defrance&#x27;s 1st and 2nd &quot;Carabiniers-à-Cheval&quot; and Doumerc&#x27;s 2nd and 9th Cuirassiers. The hastily formed squadrons rode forth, but the flat terrain of the Marchfeld provided them with little cover from the devastating fire unleashed upon them by Austrian artillery. The heavy horsemen eventually made contact with the enemy near the village of Süssenbrunn, but found the infantry prepared to receive them and their first charge failed altogether. Rallying the men for a second attempt, with the elite &quot;carabiniers-à-cheval&quot; leading the way, Nansouty pushed through, but many of his troopers were unable to follow, leaving many of the squadrons reduced to just a handful of men. It seemed at first that the charge would do some serious damage, especially when the Frenchmen managed to break and sabre the &quot;Grenz&quot; &quot;Georger&quot; battalion, thus creating a breach between the two Austrian Corps. In the end however, the effects of a cavalry charge against prepared infantry were always set to be limited and the cavalrymen made little further impression on the grenadier battalions, which were by now formed in tight, solid squares. Displaying some great tactical skill, Nansouty wheeled right with his men and fell upon the Austrian artillery line near Aderklaa. Meanwhile, Bessières was busy fetching the Guard cavalry, which was only just beginning to arrive and with which he was intending to launch a second charge. Virtually under Napoleon&#x27;s eyes, a cannonball brushed Bessières&#x27;s thigh, unhorsing the Marshal, who violently hit the ground and lost consciousness. While Bessières was being carried away from the battlefield, Nansouty and his &quot;Carabiniers-à-Cheval&quot; managed to capture an Austrian artillery battery but Liechtenstein duly sent his fresh cavalry, the 6th &quot;Rosenberg Chevaulegers&quot; and 4th &quot;Kronprinz Ferdinand&quot; Cuirassiers against them. The Austrians hit the now diminished and tired French cavalry in flank, wounding Defrance and sending his men reeling back to their own lines with heavy casualties. The light cavalry of the Guard, some 2,000 sabres, belatedly launched a brief charge of their own, but they were also repulsed by the prepared enemy. With Bessières presumed dead, Nansouty took command of the entire cavalry, but, not knowing the Emperor&#x27;s directives, decided to pull his battered troop back. In all, the French cavalry charge had been very costly; for the entire day, Nansouty&#x27;s division alone lost 1,200 horses killed or wounded and a great number of men out of action. However, it did allow Masséna to successfully disengage and gained time for the deployment of the grand battery.

Napoleon was aware that the cavalry charge was a stopgap, so, while the heavy cavalry was busy blocking the advance of the Austrian infantry, he ordered General Jacques Lauriston to assemble a massive battery. Its objective was to pound the enemy, stop their advance and force them to abandon their position between Aderklaa and Süssenbrunn. Lauriston&#x27;s battery was formed of 84 pieces, including the entire 60 pieces of the Imperial Guard artillery park and 24 pieces supplied by the &quot;Army of Italy&quot;. The horse artillery of the Guard, six batteries of six-pounders, eight-pounders and heavy 24-pounder howitzers, under the command of Colonel Augustin-Marie d&#x27;Aboville, was the first to come into action, towards 11:00. It was followed by the foot artillery of the Guard, four batteries of 12-pounders, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Antoine Drouot, and, shortly after, by the pieces from the &quot;Army of Italy&quot;. The grand battery was deployed on a single line, covering some 2 kilometers, with the &quot;Army of Italy&quot; cannon facing Liechtenstein&#x27;s Reserve Korps, while the Guard foot artillery was in the centre, facing Kollowrat&#x27;s III Korps and the Guard horse artillery extended the line southwards, facing the village of Breintlee, which was in enemy hands. As they unlimbered, the French guns were ordered to open fire at once and the relatively short range—350 to 550 metres—and the flat and sodden ground, which allowed cannonballs to ricochet far, meant that results were almost immediate. Entire files of Austrian infantry and cavalry, sometimes as much as 20 men, were blown away with a single shot and in some cases the French were even able to use short-range case-shot, which was devastating for the densely packed Austrian battalions. In order to put even more pressure on the enemy, the French battery was ordered to advance steadily, while maintaining the most intense fire. This move soon forced Kollowrat to begin pulling his forces back. Meanwhile, however, the Austrian artillery was releasing sustained counter-battery fire with the six and eight-pounders that formed Kollowratt&#x27;s and Liechtenstein&#x27;s Corps artillery. But it was above all the murderous enfilade fire, coming from the two 12-pounder batteries near Wagram, barely one kilometer away, that did the most harm to the French artillerymen. Soon, some French gun crews were reduced to such a point that Napoleon asked for volunteers among the Guard infantry, in order to replace the losses. Discarded artillery matches soon lit up the ripe corn crops and some of the wounded on both sides, unable to crawl away to safety, burned alive where they stood.

While the cannon were roaring, &quot;Maréchal&quot; Masséna was near Raasdorf, forming his men for their march south. Towards 11:00, he rallied many of the men who had routed during the attack on Aderklaa and then had rations of brandy distributed, in order to boost morale. With a part of his troops still fighting to keep Aderklaa, Masséna directed his men towards Essling, aiming to threaten Klenau&#x27;s Corps, which was by now in an advanced position behind the French line, but which had made no attempt to threaten the rear of Napoleon&#x27;s army. The passive posture of the Austrian Corps was due partly to a lack of orders to advance further and partly to the fact that Klenau&#x27;s relatively small force was by now out of touch with the main Austrian force. Nevertheless, Masséna&#x27;s task remained daunting. Some of his troops had to march no less than eight kilometers in vulnerable column formations, moving along the front of an enemy who had deployed numerous cavalry and artillery. Masséna displayed his usual skill and tenacity, using his available cavalry to screen his men and taking advantage of the high corn crops to hide his advance. The French troops, although out of range from enemy musketry, were under constant bombardment from the Austrian artillery. The Austrian cavalry attempted an attack, which nearly reached the carriage of Masséna, whose aides were forced to draw swords and defend him as French cavalry stepped in to repulse their Austrian counterparts. Towards noon, after marching some six and half kilometers in 90 minutes, the leading elements from Masséna&#x27;s Corps, namely Marulaz&#x27;s cavalry and Legrand&#x27;s infantry were within sight of the enemy-occupied village of Essling.

=== Davout&#x27;s flanking attack ===

While battle was raging on the western side of the battlefield, some 10 kilometers to the east, &quot;Maréchal&quot; Davout was preparing his attack, the manoeuvre with which Napoleon intended to win the battle. In order to gain a foothold on the plateau before him, Davout had to drive back the forces of Rosenberg&#x27;s Austrian IV Korps. The two forces had already clashed during the abortive night attacks the day before and again earlier that morning, between 05:00 and 06:00, when Rosenberg made a surprising attack, which the French managed to repulse. Due in part to the fact that Austrian Corps on other sectors of the battlefield failed to attack at the same time, Rosenberg was forced to draw his troops back to their initial positions, occupying the plateau and the strategic village of Markgrafneusiedl, situated just below the escarpment. This village was the key position, which Davout had to take at all costs, in order for his manoeuvre to succeed. Despite his vast numerical superiority, Davout&#x27;s mission was not easy, as the Austrians had a numerous cavalry and artillery available to support their infantry. Furthermore, the defensive position was solid, with the village of Markgrafneusiedl formed of sturdy stone houses and a number of large buildings, such as a disused stone church with a tall, conspicuous tower, a monastery and a mill, all of which constituted easily defendable structures. The only weakness of Rosenberg&#x27;s position was its left side, where the plateau formed a gentle slope, descending northeast.

While the French were preparing their attack, artillery on both sides opened up, with Rosenberg&#x27;s batteries placed on high ground and at times behind earthworks. Despite the superior Austrian tactical position, after about two hours of bombardment, the French managed to put out of action most of the Austrian pieces and cause fast-spreading fires in the village of Markgrafneusiedl. The fact that the French artillery won its duel with the Austrian artillery was due in part to the larger number of French high-calibre pieces, but most of all to their superior concentration of fire, with the artillery of French III Corps and II Corps cooperating and creating a deadly crossfire. By 09:30, Davout&#x27;s troops were in position and ready to commence their attack. Initial orders provided that Davout should send his four infantry divisions in a frontal assault northwards, but early that morning Napoleon changed his mind, after reconnoitering the position in person and noticing that he could take advantage from the weakness on the left of the Austrian position. The new orders stated that two of Davout&#x27;s divisions, those of Gudin and Puthod, were to advance from Grosshofen towards Markgrafneusiedl, forcing Rosenberg to commit a part of his forces in order to meet them, while the remaining infantry divisions, Friant&#x27;s and Morand&#x27;s, supported by Grouchy&#x27;s and Montbruns cavalry divisions, would storm the plateau from the east. This order caused a significant delay, as the troops had to move to their assigned positions eastwards and artillery bridges had to be built, in order for the divisional artillery to be able to cross the Russbach stream. Commanding the Austrian forces in this sector, Rosenberg could rely on reinforcements from Nordmann&#x27;s Advance Guard, and a numerous cavalry under Nostitz, all of which were placed under his direct command. He was also counting on support from the east, with Archduke John&#x27;s &quot;Army of Inner Austria&quot; set to arrive on the battlefield, but so far these badly needed reinforcements had failed to materialise.
The French began their steady advance between 09:30 and 10:00, their movement hidden from view by the thick smoke resulting from the intense artillery bombardment. On the right, Montbrun&#x27;s cavalry had already advanced towards Obersiebenbrunn, repulsing Fröhlich&#x27;s Austrian cavalry elements and clearing the way for Friant and Morand, who began their enveloping manoeuvre against the enemy left. Rosenberg responded by redeploying his reserves to form a new flank: Mayer&#x27;s brigade in first line, supported by Riese&#x27;s brigade and Infantry Regiment 58 &quot;Beaulieu&quot;. However, all these troops were drawn from Nordmann&#x27;s Advance Guard, a Corps which had sustained heavy casualties the previous day. During this manoeuvre, Nostitz&#x27;s cavalry, placed initially on the plain below the escarpment, were pushed back and forced up the slope of the plateau by Grouchy&#x27;s and Pully&#x27;s dragoons; the Austrian horse subsequently redeployed to protect Nordmann&#x27;s flank. Meanwhile, Davout personally led forward the divisions of Gudin and Puthod, who were to storm Markgrafneusiedl frontally. The village was defended by three Austrian brigades (Weiss, Hessen-Homburg and Swinburn), supported in second line by Infantry Regiment 3 &quot;Erzherzog Karl&quot; and the &quot;Landwehr&quot; battalion &quot;Unter dem Manhartsberg&quot;. The Austrian first line met the advancing columns of Gudin and Puthod with steady fire, which forced the French attack to a temporary halt. Further east, Morand, leading the French attack, faced a similar fate, when the Austrians launched a combined infantry and cavalry attack which forced the French to draw back and reform. The first Austrian line, the two regiments from Mayer&#x27;s brigade, the 4th &quot;Hoch und Deutschmeister&quot; and 49th &quot;Kerpen&quot;, supported by eight squadrons of hussars from the &quot;Erzherzog Ferdinand&quot; regiment counterattacked and Morand&#x27;s frontline regiments, the 13th Light and 17th Line were momentarily in a difficult situation. However, Friant was quick to react in support of his fellow commander, sending the Gilly brigade against the now exposed flank of the Austrians. At this point, &quot;Feldmarshalleutnant&quot; Nordmann intervened in person to reestablish the situation and was mortally wounded while doing so, with the Austrian counterattack in this sector failing completely. The brave Nordmann was to be discovered moments later by the French in a ditch, where he was abandoned during the hasty retreat of his men, who sought refuge behind Riese&#x27;s brigade, where they reformed. Despite being present in large numbers, the Austrian cavalry failed to launch a massed charge and instead launched several small-scale charges, which produced little effect. At this crucial juncture, Friant committed his entire division and, despite the failure of a first attack, soon managed to gain a firm foothold on the escarpment, pushing towards the tower at Markgrafneusiedl, a sign that the battle in this sector was turning in favour of the French.
In the meantime, Gudin and Puthod had also rallied their men and launched them in another attack against Markgrafneusiedl. They were met this time by Rohan&#x27;s division from Rosenberg&#x27;s IV Korps, which valiantly attempted to hold its ground, in a stubborn house-to-house defense, despite the fact that village was by now largely engulfed in flames. The French were equally determined and even senior commanders exposed themselves to the greatest dangers (Davout&#x27;s horse was shot under him and Gudin was seriously wounded) in order to give heart to the men. French pressure and the fast-spreading fire forced Hessen-Homburg&#x27;s brigade, which had been drawn up in support of Rohan&#x27;s division, to evacuate the position and reform on the escarpment behind the village, closely followed by Gudin&#x27;s skirmishers. Combat did continue around the disused church, where Riese&#x27;s battered brigade, infantry regiments 44 &quot;Bellegarde&quot;, 46 &quot;Chasteler&quot;, 58 &quot;Beaulieu&quot;, nine battalions in total, was still holding out with remarkable tenacity and despite the fact that their commander, &quot;General-Major&quot; Riese, did not bother to show himself throughout the day. The church, with its conspicuous stone tower, was finally lost by the Austrians towards noon, when Friant managed to push through and link up with Gudin and Puthod, forcing the three Austrian regiments to withdraw, in order to avoid being outflanked. When Rosenberg failed to retake the tower with Hessen-Homburg&#x27;s brigade, he decided to redeploy his entire force further back on the plateau and form a new line. This timely action temporarily stopped any further French advance. Seeing this development, Davout chose to force a decisive breakthrough and committed his ultimate reserve, the 3rd Heavy Cavalry Division. The Marshal ordered the heavy cavalry up the plateau west of Markgrafneusiedl, in an immediate frontal assault against the enemy line, rather than on the more favourable cavalry terrain east, where Grouchy, Pully and Montbrun were already operating. The 3rd Heavy Cavalry Division, a unit that the Emperor had attached to III Corps that very morning, was led by 31-year-old &quot;Général de Division&quot; Arrighi de Casanova, who had no previous command experience at divisional level. The division was formed of four cuirassier regiments, the 4th, 6th, 7th and 8th, totaling 16 squadrons and almost 2,000 men. Receiving his orders to charge immediately, Arrighi hastily formed his squadrons and led forward Bordessoule&#x27;s brigade up the slope, but once there, he found himself in the middle of enemy barricades and was, according to his own account, unable to deploy a single squadron. The steel-clad cuirassiers made several attempts to break the sturdy Austrian masses, but the terrain was not proper for such action and their best attempts came to nothing. Taking some 300 casualties after several frustratingly ineffective charges, Arrighi pulled his men back to safety down the slope and furiously set off to find Davout and protest against the orders he had given.
It was just after noon and, despite the failure of the French cavalry assault, Rosenberg was aware that his beleaguered line was about to give way, with possibly catastrophic consequences for the entire Austrian army. With his entire force already committed and no reserves, the Austrian commander could do little to prevent the seemingly unstoppable French onslaught. It was at this decisive moment that Archduke Charles personally brought reinforcements to his battered left wing: five battalions from Infantry Regiment 57 &quot;Joseph Colloredo&quot; and 15 &quot;Zach&quot;, one battery of six-pounders, all drawn from Austrian II Korps and four squadrons of hussars, as well as the entire 8th &quot;Hohenzollern&quot; Cuirassier regiment, from the Cavalry Reserve. With the cavalry thus reinforced and placed under the overall command of &quot;Feldmarschalleutnant&quot; Nostitz, Archduke Charles ordered his horsemen to charge the enemy. At first, &quot;General-Major&quot; Wartensleben&#x27;s brigade, the 3rd &quot;O&#x27;Reilly&quot; &quot;Chevaulegers&quot; and the 6th &quot;Blackenstein&quot; Hussars, charged Montbrun&#x27;s first line, overwhelming the French 7th Hussars. The Austrians then made a dash towards Montbrun&#x27;s second line, which made a surprising attempt to drive off the attackers with a carbine volley, which failed to break the impetus of the charge and sent the French horse reeling. As a result of his successful charge, Wartensleben was able to capture ten French horse artillery pieces. But the Austrian triumph was fleeting and Montbrun had carefully prepared a countercharge with his reserve and skilfully launched the 12th &quot;Chasseurs-à-Cheval&quot; frontally, while the 11th &quot;Chasseurs-à-Cheval&quot; charged the &quot;O&#x27;Reilly&quot; &quot;Chevaulegers&quot; from flank. On the French side, Grouchy soon brought his dragoons in support and Nostitz was forced to counter them by committing &quot;General-Major&quot; Rothkirch&#x27;s brigade, formed by the 1st &quot;Erzherzog Johann&quot; and 6th &quot;Riesch&quot; Dragoons. A massive, albeit brief, cavalry clash occurred and in the melee, both Nostitz and Rothkirch were wounded and the Austrians were driven back, leaving behind the cannon they had captured moments earlier and taking refuge behind the infantry. This was the major cavalry action of the battle and, despite the fact that the Austrians committed over 30 of their 40 squadrons present in the sector, the French gained the upper hand, thanks largely to their superior training for massed action. Charging by single regiments against an enemy who committed entire brigades and divisions in coordinated actions, the Austrians, although superior in overall numbers, had been overwhelmed, a testament to their chronic inability to coordinate large-scale cavalry charges. Towards 13:00, after the failure of his cavalry charge, Rosenberg reckoned that he was unable to hold out on his current positions and began organising a fighting retreat towards Bockfliess, some northwest.

=== MacDonald&#x27;s column ===
Davout&#x27;s successful flanking manoeuvre did not escape unnoticed. Despite the considerable distance, towards 13:00, Napoleon could see through his spyglass that the smoke line in Davout&#x27;s sector was by now well beyond the clearly visible tower at Markgrafneusiedl, a sign that his men had managed to roll back the enemy&#x27;s flank. With his left now stabilised following Masséna&#x27;s successful disengagement, the Emperor began issuing orders for a general attack. Masséna was to continue his march south and vigorously attack Klenau around Aspern, Oudinot was ordered to prepare his Corps for an assault against the plateau and dislodge Austrian II Korps, Eugène was to take VI Corps against the enemy forces at Deutsch-Wagram, while MacDonald&#x27;s V Corps was to draw closer to Aderklaa. During the night, MacDonald had been rejoined by the second division of his Corps and although theoretically 23 battalions strong, this force had diminished complements and could barely muster 8,000 men. With this force, MacDonald was preparing to execute Napoleon&#x27;s previous orders to storm the plateau near the village of Wagram, much at the same location where he had attacked the previous day, when he received new orders. These provided that MacDonald&#x27;s force should head west, towards Aderklaa, and deploy to occupy the ground held by the Grand Battery.
Just before 13:00, MacDonald moved towards his assigned location, with eight battalions from Lamarque and Broussier&#x27;s division deployed in line, forming the front line, with the other 15 battalions remaining in column, a formation which could more easily fend off the increasing menace poised by the numerous enemy cavalry. This unusual formation, some 800 metres long and 550 metres wide, was to be supported by the remains of the Grand Battery, which had orders to advance on its right and open intense fire against the Austrian line. Seras&#x27;s division was also ordered in support of this attack and deployed some distance behind the column with one of the &quot;carabiniers-à-cheval&quot; regiments protecting its rear. The assigned objective of this prodigious mass of men was to bludgeon its way forward and take the village of Süssenbrunn, the seam between the Austrian Grenadier Reserve and III Korps. Once managed to take the position, they would drive a wedge between the two Austrian formations, pushing them apart. A powerful cavalry force was to protect either flank of MacDonald&#x27;s formation, with Walther&#x27;s mighty Guard Cavalry Division protecting the right and Nansouty&#x27;s 1st Heavy Cavalry Division protecting the left. Sahuc&#x27;s diminished cavalry division from the &quot;Army of Italy&quot; was also involved in this action.

As MacDonald&#x27;s lumbering column moved forward, Austrian artillery opened up against the accompanying French cannon, disabling 15 of them, before they even had time to unlimber and respond. The Austrian guns then focussed on MacDonald&#x27;s slow-moving formation, whose deep ranks presented ideal targets. Seeing the French advance, Archduke Charles ordered his Corps commanders to refuse the flank of the Grenadier Reserve and III Korps. Liechtenstein ordered Steyer&#x27;s brigade to deploy in an oblique position and release heavy musketry against the right flank of the advancing French column, while Kollowrat issued a similar order to the Lilienberg brigade, which fired musketry volleys against the left of MacDonald&#x27;s men, while Austrian artillery was pounding the column&#x27;s front line. However, by now the French had managed to dent the Austrian line and had only a few hundred metres to go before they could reach the strategic village of Süssenbrunn. With his force reduced to little more than half strength and his battalions forced to form square in order to fend off three successive cavalry attacks from &quot;Feldmarshalleutnant&quot; Schwarzenberg&#x27;s cavalry, MacDonald could go no further. He called upon the numerous cavalry available to charge and clear the enemy guns and infantry, who, according to his own account, were by now in a state of complete disarray and ripe for destruction. On his left, Nansouty, who had apparently not been consulted regarding the placement and role of his division in the attack, had kept his men too far back, in order to protect them from the sustained enemy fire. When Nansouty arrived with his cuirassiers, the Austrians were prepared to meet them and the guns had already limbered and moved away to safety. The French cuirassiers charged Vukassovich and Saint-Julien&#x27;s divisions, but these men were by now formed in the sturdy mass formations, which were virtually invulnerable to cavalry.

Further north, protecting the other flank of MacDonald&#x27;s column lay the fresh Guard Cavalry Division, which also received MacDonald&#x27;s invitation to charge, but remained motionless, with its commander, &quot;Général de Division&quot; Walther, invoking a lack of orders from his direct commanders, either Napoleon or &quot;Maréchal&quot; Bessières. The Emperor was too far away from the action and Bessières had been wounded during his earlier cavalry charge and had been carried away from the battlefield, so the Horse Guards did not move. Towards 14:00, MacDonald&#x27;s attack had ground to a halt and the opportunity to completely break the Austrian line in this sector came to nothing. Napoleon noted with disgust that it was the first time that the cavalry let him down, but, given the state of exhaustion and the losses sustained by the French forces, MacDonald would have probably been unable to follow up any breakthrough achieved by the cavalry anyway. Still, the resolutely led attack achieved Napoleon&#x27;s main strategic goal, which was to pin down the Austrian forces in this sector, preventing Charles from reinforcing his battered left. Forced to concede that his attack had lost momentum, MacDonald did his best to shelter his remaining men from the enemy&#x27;s intense cannonade. However, reinforcements were not far away: the Emperor sent in support Wrede&#x27;s powerful Bavarian division, 5,500 men strong, as well as the elite &quot;Chasseurs à Cheval&quot; and &quot;Chevau-légers&quot; regiments of the Imperial Guard, as well as the Saxon cavalry. The Bavarian division quickly came up in support but exchanged fire with the enemy only briefly and it was solely the artillery that really came into action, as the Austrians were by now in full retreat. Behind the Bavarians came the Fusiliers of the &quot;Young Guard&quot;, four battalion-strong, which were led by the Emperor&#x27;s aide-de-camp, General Reille, with strict orders to avoid &quot;getting involved in any adventure&quot;. With the support of the Guard, the Bavarians captured Süssenbrunn and they alone continued the pursuit beyond this village. The Guard &quot;Chasseurs à Cheval&quot; tried to halt the advance of the enemy but they were met by Liechtenstein&#x27;s Austrian cavalry and, receiving no support from their fellow &quot;Chevau-légers&quot;, they had to withdraw, coming away with only three enemy cannon.

===Masséna&#x27;s &quot;Infernal Column&quot;===
Meanwhile, Masséna had indeed made remarkable progress since 11:00, when he had begun disengaging from the struggle at Aderklaa and organising his march against Klenau. On the French left, Klenau, commander of VI Korps, was fully aware of Masséna&#x27;s manoeuvre, stating in his post-battle report that he saw an &quot;Infernal Column&quot; advancing towards him. By 12:30, elements of IV Corps were at Essling and Masséna received the Emperor&#x27;s dispatch, informing him of Davout&#x27;s success and urging him to attack. Masséna sent Marulaz&#x27;s cavalry to clear the enemy horse, which was pushing back Boudet&#x27;s defeated division. Then, Marulaz fell upon and captured the Austrian battery which was bombarding the bridges over the Danube, sending the panicked gunners fleeing for their lives. An Austrian countercharge from Walmoden&#x27;s Austrian hussars sent the French horse reeling and recaptured the lost battery, managing to carry most of it, except two guns, to safety, before more French cavalry, this time from Lasalle&#x27;s division, came up against them. The French cavalry attack halted the advance of Klenau&#x27;s Korps and allowed the French launch an attack of their own against the village of Essling. Six weeks before, during the Battle of Aspern-Essling, the French had valiantly defended this village against several Austrian attacks; now they were ordered to take it from some 1,200 whitecoats. The village was in ruins, but the sturdy stone granary was still standing and represented a formidable defensive structure. Nevertheless, Ledru des Essarts&#x27;s brigade from Legrand&#x27;s 1st division stormed the position and, after intense fighting, they secured Essling towards 14:00, sending the defenders fleeing towards Aspern. Masséna then took Aspern after a brief combat and, collecting his four infantry divisions, continued to press Klenau, sending Molitor&#x27;s division towards Breitenlee. There, General Durutte&#x27;s division of the &quot;Army of Italy&quot;, which had been sent to plug the gap between IV Corps and the rest of the army, had just taken the village of Breitenlee. Durutte&#x27;s division was able to link up with Molitor.

Masséna had accomplished his mission and had no further orders to continue his action but, hearing the intense cannonade on his right, he understood that he needed to continue his attack. He detailed Boudet&#x27;s division to march on Kagran, while his other three infantry divisions marched on Leopoldau. The corps cavalry preceded the infantry and Lasalle&#x27;s squadrons caught up with Klenau&#x27;s infantry near Leopoldau. There, the French cavalry met two Austrian battalions, already formed in solid masses. This formation was ideal for fending off enemy horse. Nevertheless, the French charged impetuously but achieved little. The first mass could only be dispersed after horse artillery came into action. Not long before 17:00, the cavalry moved against the second mass and it was during this action that the gallant Lasalle, one of the best cavalry commanders of his time, was shot dead. Marulaz took overall command of the cavalry and personally placed himself at the head of the 8th Hussars, in a bid to avenge the slain commander; the attempt failed and Marulaz was himself wounded and had to be carried away to the rear. This event, as well as the fact that the French were now under fire from the artillery of Austrian V Korps on Bisamberg heights, convinced Masséna to halt his pursuit. Towards 17:00 Klenau had succeeded in extracting his corps from the dangerous position next to the Danube and moved to relative safety behind the reserve V Korps, deployed on the Bisamberg heights.

=== Austrian retreat ===
While &quot;Feldmarshalleutnant&quot; Klenau was being ousted from Essling, Archduke Charles received much-awaited news about the arrival of his brother on the battlefield. However, the news were disappointing: Archduke John of Austria and his 13,000 men, Charles&#x27;s only hope for rescuing his collapsing left flank, would only be able to arrive towards 17:00, much too late to make any difference. By now, Charles was acutely aware that his troops would not hold out much longer. His three corps on the Wagram plateau (I, II and IV) had been in action for some ten hours. On his right, Kollowrat&#x27;s III Korps, Klenau&#x27;s VI Korps and the Reserve Korps were being pushed back. Crucially, he had no battle reserves with which to either support his battered line or to launch a counterattack of his own. Continuing to fight in these conditions would have spelled the end of the &quot;Kaiserlich-königliche Hauptarmee&quot; and, in Charles&#x27;s view, the end of the Habsburg Empire. His only realistic option was to begin an orderly retreat, which he ordered by mid morning, directing each corps along its line of retreat.

While MacDonald&#x27;s attack was drawing the attention of the Austrians, the French launched their general attack. Napoleon committed Marmont&#x27;s fresh XI Corps, sending these men to take position opposite to Austrian I Korps and fill the gap between the &quot;Army of Italy&quot; and II Corps. Moreover, towards 13:00, the French from Oudinot&#x27;s II Corps had begun to advance frontally against the Austrian troops on the Wagram plateau. The mercurial Oudinot, who had been waiting for his orders to attack all morning, decided to wait no longer, despite the fact that he had not yet received his order. Opposite to Oudinot was Austrian II Korps. Having spent the entire morning doing nothing else than exchanging artillery fire with French II Corps, these men were relatively fresh. They were also in a very dangerous position. The commander of II Korps, the experienced &quot;Feldmarschalleutnant&quot; Hohenzollern, could see that his force was in danger of being attacked from the flank by Davout&#x27;s seemingly unstoppable corps. Now Oudinot was advancing against him. At first, Hohenzollern tried to hold on his initial positions and his men greeted Oudinot&#x27;s advancing columns with intense musketry. However, the Austrian commander realised the fragility of his position, seeing that, on his left, all the Austrian troops were in full retreat and he ran the risk of having Oudinot pin his men down, while Davout was free to advance in his flank and rear. Hohenzollern thus had little choice but to order his men to fall back and form a new line further north, sending 5 battalions and several batteries from his second line to form a new flank and slow down Davout&#x27;s two advancing divisions, which were drawing dangerously close to the strategic village of Baumersdorf.

Seeing the Austrians in full retreat, Oudinot lost his composure and galloped along his line, shouting his commands, ordering his men to run at the enemy. One of the Corps divisional commanders, general Grandjean, reiterated this highly unusual and potentially disastrous order, which would have resulted in the columns rapidly dispersing and becoming vulnerable to a counterattack. Luckily enough, the troops were commanded by experienced junior officers, who took over and executed the orderly manoeuvres that were required on such occasions. During this action, Oudinot was wounded twice and had his horse shot from under him, but he retained his command and, after his surgeon dressed his wounds, he led his men on. His troops stormed Baumersdorf, which they took, despite gallant defense from Hardegg&#x27;s brigade. Oudinot&#x27;s Corps then fanned out, with the bulk of his men continuing to press Hohenzollern and Tharreau&#x27;s division wheeling left against Bellegarde&#x27;s I Korps. To the west, General Pacthod and his division of the &quot;Army of Italy&quot;, supported by the Italian Royal Guard, were able to manoeuvre unseen by following the riverline of the Russbach up the village of Deutsch-Wagram. There, they fell upon the unprotected flank of d&#x27;Aspré&#x27;s Austrian grenadier division, which had been left behind to cover Bellegarde, who had just begun to retreat, in accordance with Charles&#x27;s orders. Surprising the grenadiers, Pacthod stormed the position and pushed the Austrians back in disorder beyond the village of Aderklaa. They were supported by Tharreau&#x27;s division of II Corps, which had managed to storm the plateau next to the village. Bellegarde reacted by sending in some of his reserves to stop the enemy onslaught, but the French managed to secure both Wagram and Aderklaa, two key positions on the battlefield.

By 16:00, the entire Austrian army was in full retreat. They executed this manoeuvre admirably, with the formations remaining cohesive and withdrawing in echelon, each formation protecting the retreat of the adjoining one. During this phased retreat, &quot;Generalmajor&quot; Smola, commander of the Austrian artillery had a major role, managing to mass a sufficient number of cannon to keep the enemy at a respectable distance. The French, who had been marching and fighting for over forty hours, under intense heat and with scarce rations of water and food, were slowly following the retreating enemy. The exhaustion of the French troops was such that, towards 16:00 a brief moment of panic occurred at Wagram. Dozens of French infantry fled down the escarpment, with the Old Guard forced to form square in order to protect the Emperor&#x27;s headquarters, before order could be restored. A second such moment took place around one hour later, when a mounted scouting party from Archduke John&#x27;s army suddenly appeared near Glinzendorf, causing panic among the stragglers and civilian contractors of the army, with the Guard again forced to form square. But John soon received word that the battle was already over and hastily retraced his steps. A final incident took place towards 18:00, when elements of the 108th Line regiment from Davout&#x27;s Corps caught up with enemy stragglers at the Bockfliess. There, the French found the houses filled with drunken Austrian whitecoats, who refused to surrender and attempted to defend themselves. Some 200 of these men were slaughtered and 400 were captured. By nightfall, contact had been broken and the exhausted French had to stop the pursuit and camp on their positions. Towards dusk, French cavalry caught up with Austrian III Korps and tried to block its retreat but the numerous Austrian cavalry in the sector promptly stepped in, hitting the enemy&#x27;s flank and sending these horsemen fleeing. This persuaded Archduke Charles that he had left III Korps in an exposed position and ordered it to hasten their retreat and get in line with VI Korps. Towards 20:00 all combat ceased and the Austrians were able to move away without any further incident. Napoleon&#x27;s forces had won the bloody Battle of Wagram.

== Aftermath ==
=== Pursuit and armistice ===
By nightfall on 6 July, the Austrians, still capable of action, had broken contact with their pursuers and Charles had managed to reestablish a cohesive, albeit irregular front. The remarkable combat-worthiness shown during the evening fighting left Napoleon wondering whether the Austrians would actually renew battle the next day. The Emperor rose early on 7 July and reconnoitred the battlefield in person, noting the huge losses in men on both sides and seeing that the Austrians had withdrawn. He then returned to more practical matters and, after receiving MacDonald&#x27;s report, he suddenly embraced the general and elevated him to the dignity of &quot;Maréchal d&#x27;Empire&quot;, the only Marshal to receive the title on a field of battle. The Emperor also criticised Marmont for his slowness in arriving on the battlefield and told Oudinot that he ought to have him shot for attacking without orders. The French resumed their pursuit towards 14:00, as the extreme exhaustion of the army prevented an early start. Their artillery had fired somewhere between 90,000 and 100,000 rounds during the battle, which left the caissons empty and it took some time before they could be refilled. Among the rank and file, there were even instances of severe breakdown in troop discipline, as the army moved through county packed with vines and wine cellars. When an incensed Oudinot, sabre in hand, tried to restore discipline among a group of drunken cavalrymen from his army corps, he was almost attacked by his own men. Pursuit was further complicated by the absence of reliable information about the exact direction of the Austrian retreat. Contradictory intelligence collected by the various Corps confusingly stated that the Austrians were retreating either towards to Brünn or to Znaim and other reports were actually indicating a retreat towards Moravia. The French tried to close the gap through sustained march. Spearheading the pursuit were the army corps of Masséna to the west, Marmont in the centre and Davout to the east, while the &quot;Army of Italy&quot; was detailed to keep an eye on Archduke John&#x27;s army.

The Austrians were actually retreating towards Znaim in Bohemia. The Austrian army had suffered greatly during the Battle of Wagram and had to leave behind their wounded, but did make off with thousands of French prisoners, a couple of dozen guns and a few eagles. Making good use of night marches, Archduke Charles had the bulk of his forces assembled at Korneuburg on 7 July. Charles and his senior commanders had considered various plans to continue the campaign, but in the end, Charles was not positioning his army for a continuation of the campaign. The Austrian commander&#x27;s view well before the Battle of Wagram had been that Austria&#x27;s best option was to make peace and, in order to achieve that, the Empire needed to have a large, battle-worthy army, which they could use as leverage during the peace talks. Between 9 and 12 July, the French from Eugène&#x27;s &quot;Army of Italy&quot; clashed with Archduke John&#x27;s forces in a series of skirmishes and pushed them back into Hungary, while Masséna caught up with and fought the Austrian rearguard in several actions, most notable of which was the one at Hollabrunn. By now, Napoleon had largely understood Charles&#x27;s intentions and manoeuvred against them. Marmont and his small XI Corps was the first to engage the Austrian army at the Battle of Znaim and was momentarily largely outnumbered. His 10,000 men faced some 60,000 massed enemy troops, but, in the typical style of Napoleonic warfare, Marmont decided to attack in order to pin down the enemy. He could reasonably expect to be reinforced soon and at 22:00, Napoleon arrived with reinforcements. The battle raged on the next day, with some bloody fighting going on around Znaim. The Austrians took heavy casualties, some 6,200 men, during the battle and, as time passed, the French force was set to be augmented to some 84,000 men, following the imminent arrival of Davout and Oudinot. Recognising the futility of another battle, Charles decided to ask for an armistice. He did so on his own responsibility, as he did not have permission to do so from Emperor Francis I. Ignoring the advice of his senior commanders – &quot;Maréchal&quot; Berthier was vocal in advising the continuation of hostilities and destruction of the Austrian Empire – Napoleon accepted. The Armistice of Znaim marked the end of the active phase of the 1809 war between France and Austria.

=== Casualties ===
With more than 300,000 combatants, Wagram was the largest battle in European history up to its time. With at least 72,000 casualties on both sides, it was also the bloodiest military engagement of the entire Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars thus far. The unusually high casualty rate was due mainly to an unprecedented concentration of artillery, on a flat battlefield, where the deadly roundshot – each army fired at least 90,000 during the two days of battle – was most effective.

Napoleon used his usual propaganda to minimise his losses, stating in the Bulletin of the that Wagram cost the army only &quot;1,500 dead and 3,000 to 4,000 wounded&quot;. In reality, losses had been horrendous. French medical services were completely overwhelmed, although imperial guardsmen were given priority and were quite well cared for. Of the total 1,200 guardsmen of all arms wounded at Wagram, half were able to return to the ranks within a few days and only 145 died from their wounds. The troops of the line were not so lucky. Most of the wounded on both sides had been hit by cannon fire, which caused horrendous injuries, often requiring amputation. The shock of the surgery, massive loss of blood, poor after-care and the risk of infection meant the chances of survival following amputation were not good.

Globally, since neither army provided a complete tabulation of their losses, the exact number of casualties is hard to establish. One author suggests that French casualties of all sorts approached 40,000 men, greatly surpassing those of the Austrians. More conservative estimates place overall French losses at between 25,000 or 28,000 men and either 31,500 or 33,000 men. Five generals (Duprat, Gautier, Guiot de Lacour, Lasalle and von Hartitzsch) and another 238 officers, as well as 7,000 men were killed. Additionally, 37 generals, 883 officers and over 25,000 men were wounded and 4,000 men were taken prisoner, many of them wounded.

On the Austrian side, losses had also been heavy. An official tabulation established that there were 51,626 officers and men missing on 11 July 1809, compared to the overall complements on 5 July 1809. This figure thus accounts not only for the Battle of Wagram, but also for losses during the many minor engagements and skirmishes that took place after the battle, as well as the losses suffered during the Battle of Znaim. Many of these men were simply missing in action and were subsequently able to return to the colours. Nevertheless, conservative estimates of the Austrian losses at Wagram numbered some 30,000 men, of whom 24,000 were killed or wounded, and the rest taken prisoner. According to historian, Ian Castle, Austrian casualties were as follows: 41,250 total, of which 23,750 killed or wounded, 10,000 missing, 7,500 captured, while French and Allied casualties amounted to 37,500, with 27,500 killed or wounded and 10,000 missing or captured. Four Austrian generals were killed or mortally wounded during the fighting: Nordmann, Vukassovich, Vécsey, and d&#x27;Aspré.

==Analysis==
Just as in the bloody Battle of Eylau, Wagram was a battle in which Napoleon failed to score an uncontested victory with relatively few casualties. The French forces suffered 34,000 casualties, a number compounded by the 20,000 suffered only weeks earlier at Aspern-Essling. This would be indicative both of the lack of continued growth in experience of Napoleon&#x27;s troops and the increasing experience and competence of his opponents, who were learning from previous errors. The heavy losses suffered, which included many seasoned troops as well as over thirty generals of varying rank, was something that the French would not be able to recover from with ease. Bernadotte&#x27;s dismissal from the for his failure would have severe consequences for Napoleon in later years. Unexpectedly elected heir to the throne of Sweden the following year, the former Marshal would eventually lead his new homeland into war with France. 

== Footnotes ==
* With some 95,000 men committed to battle, the Austrians had held a 3/1 numeric advantage at the end of the first day of battle and a 3/2 numeric superiority throughout the second day. The Austrians also deployed 200 cannon to the French 90 cannon.
* Hiller was replaced at the command of VI Korps with &quot;Felmarshalleutnant&quot; Johann von Klenau, formerly commander of the army Advance Guard. Klenau was himself replaced at the helm of the Advance Guard by &quot;Felmarshalleutnant&quot; Armand von Nordmann.
* Lannes had been commanding II Corps. After his death, he was replaced by &quot;Général de Division&quot; Nicolas Oudinot, who had held the command of the Corps at the very beginning of the War of the Fifth Coalition.
* Saint-Hilaire had been commanding the 3rd division of II Corps and was replaced at its helm by &quot;Général de Division&quot; Charles-Louis-Dieudonné Grandjean. Espagne had been commanding the 3rd heavy cavalry division of the Cavalry Reserve and was replaced in this capacity by &quot;Général de Division&quot; Jean-Toussaint Arrighi de Casanova.
* It formed the first brigade of General Jean Victor Tharreau&#x27;s 1st division of II Corps.
* The full complements of the Advance Guard on 4 July 1809 had included some 22 cavalry squadrons (2,500 men), 23 infantry battalions (11,500 men) and 48 guns.
* Sources provide various figures regarding the number of guns forming the grand battery. The 25th Bulletin of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;, which recounts the facts of the Battle of Wagram, indicates that it was formed of 100 guns and this figure is indicated by most historians, with some putting the figure as high as 112 guns. Recent research shows that both these figures are exaggerated and more realistic estimates place the number of guns at either 72, 80 or 84. André Masséna, a highly credible source and also a man who was in the vicinity of the battery at the time when it was deployed, places its complement at 84 pieces: 60 pieces of the Guard artillery and 24 of the &quot;Army of Italy&quot;. Despite claims from some authors that the cannon of the Bavarian division were also a part of the battery, there is actually no source contemporary to the battle supporting that claim.
* MacDonald&#x27;s Corps included Jean-Baptiste Broussier&#x27;s 1st division, 10 battalions and 4,400 men strong, which had not seen any action during 5 July fighting. It also included Jean Maximilien Lamarque&#x27;s 2nd Division, which on 4 July numbered 11 battalions, with some 3,740 men, but which had seen intense action during the night attacks on 5 July and had taken casualties.
* The general retreat direction was northwest. Rosenberg&#x27;s troops were already retreating north towards Bockfluss. Charles&#x27;s orders provided that the various army corps will retreat, following the pace set by Bellegarde&#x27;s I Korps. The order provided that Bellegarde was to move towards Gerasdorf, Liechtenstein&#x27;s cavalry was to remain in the Gerasdorf plain, sending patrols towards the Russbach river to collect information about the French advance, Liechtenstein&#x27;s grenadiers were directed to Hagenbrunn, Kollowrat&#x27;s III Korps was to move towards the Stammersdorf heights, while Klenau was to deploy between Gerasdorf and Leopoldsau. Charles informed his corps commanders that he would be establishing his headquarters at Stammersdorf, and that they were all required to send an officer there before nightfall, in order to receive new orders.

<text>The Battle of Wattignies (15–16 October 1793) saw a French army commanded by Jean-Baptiste Jourdan attack a Coalition army directed by Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. After two days of combat Jourdan&#x27;s troops compelled the Habsburg covering force led by François Sébastien Charles Joseph de Croix, Count of Clerfayt to withdraw. The War of the First Coalition victory allowed the French to raise the siege of Maubeuge. At a time when failed generals were often executed or imprisoned, Jourdan had to endure interference from Lazare Carnot from the Committee of Public Safety. The village, renamed Wattignies-la-Victoire in honor of the important success, is located southeast of Maubeuge.

Coburg&#x27;s main army encircled 25,000 French soldiers in Maubeuge while about 22,000 Austrians under Clerfayt were formed in a semi-circle, covering the southern approaches to the fortress. On the first day, 45,000 French soldiers mounted a clumsy attack which was easily repulsed, except near the village of Wattignies. On the second day, Jourdan concentrated half his army at Wattignies and after a tough fight, forced Coburg to concede defeat. Though the Coalition army was better trained than the French, its units were spread out too thinly and the different nationalities failed to cooperate. Soon the Coalition army went into winter quarters, finishing a campaign that started with great promise and ended in disappointment. Carnot rewrote history so that he and the political representatives got most of the credit for the triumph; Jourdan was dismissed in January 1794.

==Background==
In the summer of 1793, the 118,000-strong Coalition army punched a gap in the line of French fortresses along the frontier with the Austrian Netherlands, with the siege of Condé concluding on 12 July and the siege of Valenciennes on 27 July. In the Battle of Caesar&#x27;s Camp, the Coalition army under Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld hustled the French &quot;Army of the North&quot; out of a position near Cambrai on 7 August. At this moment, the Coalition allies unwisely split their forces. Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany headed west toward Dunkirk with 37,000 British, Austrians, Hanoverians and Hessians.

From 6–8 September, the &quot;Army of the North&quot; under Jean Nicolas Houchard defeated the Dunkirk covering force in the Battle of Hondschoote, compelling the Duke of York to give up the siege of Dunkirk. This was followed by the Battle of Menin on 13 September, in which the French routed a Dutch corps under Prince William of Orange. The Dutch suffered 3,000 casualties and lost 40 field pieces in the disaster. Two days later, an Austrian corps led by Johann Peter Beaulieu routed the French and recaptured Menen (Menin).

Coburg&#x27;s main army concluded the siege of Le Quesnoy on 13 September, taking 4,000 French troops prisoner. Two French columns attempted to raise the siege but failed, one of the columns being nearly wiped out by Coalition cavalry in the Battle of Avesnes-le-Sec. Though Coburg might have easily seized Cambrai and Bouchain, which had been stripped of their garrisons to form the relief columns, the Coalition commander chose to move against Maubeuge instead. For these defeats, Houchard was arrested on 23 September and incarcerated in a common prison. Denounced as a coward and a traitor by the Revolutionary Tribunal, he was executed by guillotine on 16 November. His predecessor in command of the &quot;Army of the North&quot;, Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine had been guillotined on 27 August 1793.

Jean-Baptiste Jourdan had been wounded at Hondschoote and was named to lead the &quot;Army of the Ardennes&quot; on 9 September. He was appointed provisional commander in chief of the &quot;Army of the North&quot; on 22 September. When Jourdan protested that he lacked the experience to command the 104,000-man army, the representatives on mission notified him that refusal would result in his arrest. The new commander found that he must respond to the Coalition&#x27;s move against Maubeuge. Coburg&#x27;s army began the siege of Maubeuge on 30 September.

==Operations==

===French deployment===
On 1 October 1793, Jourdan&#x27;s large army was distributed across a broad front in four great masses, starting at the North Sea and running southeast. Joseph Souham at Dunkirk commanded 8,852 infantry in 17 battalions and 430 cavalry in one regiment and André Gigaux at Hondschoote had 7,269 infantry in 15 battalions. Near Cassel, Dominique Vandamme led 8,984 foot soldiers in 19 battalions and 325 horsemen in one regiment, while Charles François Filon led 3,705 foot soldiers in nine battalions. At Bailleul there were 4,166 infantry in 10 battalions. The second mass started at Armentières, where there were 9,644 foot in 19 battalions and 1,338 horse in four regiments. At the Camp of Madelaine near Lille, Antoine Anne Lecourt de Berú directed 13,564 infantry in 28 battalions and 817 Chasseurs à Cheval, in three regiments. Pierre Guillaume Gratien at Mons-en-Pévèle led 3,521 infantry in nine battalions.

The third mass was located at the Camp of Gavrelle between Douai and Arras. Commanded by Jourdan, the force included the Flankers of the Right with 6,048 foot in 15 battalions and 1,602 horse in five regiments and the Flankers of the Left with 6,821 infantry in 14 battalions and 1,323 cavalry in three regiments. The Advance Guard consisted of 4,821 foot in eight battalions and 1,901 horse in five regiments; the Center Division was made up of 4,077 infantry in six battalions and 428 cavalry in two regiments, with two battalions of 732 men guarding the wagon train. Jacques Ferrand commanded the fourth mass, which was in the Maubeuge entrenched camp. Second-in-command was Jean Nestor de Chancel. The fortress garrison under Étienne Gudin counted 2,173 soldiers. Pierre Arnould Meyer&#x27;s right brigade numbered 6,992 men including the 7th and 12th Dragoons, Joseph-Antoine Colomb&#x27;s center brigade had 6,802 men and Jacques Desjardin&#x27;s left brigade consisted of 8,140 men including the 1st Hussars; altogether Ferrand commanded 24,107 soldiers.

===Blockade of Maubeuge===
At dawn on 29 September, a column under François Sébastien Charles Joseph de Croix, Count of Clerfayt crossed the Sambre at Berlaimont, southwest of Maubeuge. To the northeast, Franz Vincenz von Hoditz&#x27;s column crossed the river near Pont-sur-Sambre and a third column led by Wenzel Joseph von Colloredo crossed the Sambre at Hautmont. In a series of skirmishes, the three Austrian columns pressed east, finally driving Desjardin&#x27;s troops into the Maubeuge entrenched camp, with losses of 150 men and two cannons. To the east of Maubeuge, Austrians under Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour crossed the Sambre near Marpent and Jeumont. A column under Alexander Friedrich von Seckendorf crossed near Merbes-le-Château farther east. These forces forced Meyer&#x27;s troops in disorder back within Maubeuge, which was isolated.

Coburg split his forces into a 26,000-man Siege Army directed by the Prince of Orange and an Army of Observation. The Siege Army consisted of 14,000 Austrians under Colloredo south of the Sambre and 12,000 Dutch under Orange north of the river. Colloredo&#x27;s force included 16 battalions, 10 companies and eight squadrons. The Army of Observation totaled 25,550 infantry and 12,150 cavalry, distributed in three main divisions. Franz Xaver von Wenckheim commanded 7,250 foot and 4,200 horse, west of the Sambre in the Forêt de Mormal. Hoditz directed 9,300 foot and 3,750 horse on the east of Maubeuge and Clerfayt led 9,000 foot and 4,200 horse on the south side of Maubeuge. Clerfayt divided his corps into three groups under Count Heinrich von Bellegarde, Joseph Binder von Degenschild and Ludwig von Terzi.

The Coalition forces began constructing extensive siege works around Maubeuge. On the first day, the French garrison sortied against the Cense de Château but were repulsed after stiff fighting. Maubeuge was supplied for a normal garrison but far too many soldiers were trapped there. On 10 October, Ferrand had to put the troops on half-rations, while hundreds of sick and dying soldiers crowded the hospitals. On 13 October, the French enjoyed initial success in a sortie against the Bois du Tilleul, but troops sent out to help mistakenly fired on their own friends and the French were compelled to retreat. The Coalition established batteries of 20 24-pound cannons against the town. After the Coalition army opened its bombardment on the night of 14 October, the morale of the garrison sank. When some soldiers complained to Chancel that they were hungry and tired he replied, &quot;Listen young men, it takes a lot of work and privation in order to gain the honor to fight and die for your country.&quot; Representative Jean-Baptiste Drouet tried to cut his way out of Maubeuge with some dragoons but was captured. Denounced for abandoning the place, Drouet claimed his escape would have raised the spirits of the garrison.

===French reaction===
Leaving 10,000 soldiers in the Camp of Gavrelle to support Bouchain and Cambrai, Jourdan immediately moved to the relief of Maubeuge with the remaining 20,000 men. He also called in 12,000 reinforcements from the Camp de Madelaine and 10,000 more from farther north. Without waiting for the troops from the north, Jourdan assembled a division under Jacques Fromentin. Leaving the camp on 3 October, it arrived at Guise on the 6th. That same day Antoine Balland&#x27;s division left the Camp of Gavrelle and reached Guise on 9 October. Berú promptly sent Gratien&#x27;s brigade and other units from Lille and Mons-en-Pévèle, this body of 11,701 soldiers was assigned to Florent Joseph Duquesnoy.

Left wing commander Jean-Baptiste Davaine sent 9,012 troops under Martin Jean Carrion de Loscondes which arrived at Guise on 10 October. The Committee of Public Safety placed the &quot;Army of Ardennes&quot; under Jourdan&#x27;s control on 2 October. The army&#x27;s commander Ferrand was immured in Maubeuge and orders were sent for one detachment to operate from Philippeville. A motley force of 4,263 men was assembled under Pierre Raphaël Paillot de Beauregard and reached Fourmies on 11 October. The next day, several units from the north joined Beauregard&#x27;s division. Jourdan&#x27;s army shifted east from Guise to Avesnes-sur-Helpe between 11 and 13 October.

On 14 October, Jourdan and Committee of Public Safety member Lazare Carnot reconnoitered the Coalition front south of Maubeuge. The numerical strength of the army was 37,906 infantry and 6,370 cavalry for a grand total of 44,276, with the troops distributed as follows. Fromentin&#x27;s division numbered 7,357 men including 1,495 cavalry. Carrion&#x27;s division, now under Étienne Jean-François Cordellier-Delanoüe, counted 6,866 troops including 668 horsemen. Balland&#x27;s division consisted of 13,294 soldiers, of which 1,440 were cavalry. Duquesnoy&#x27;s division had 10,906 men including 1,960 mounted troops. Beauregard&#x27;s division comprised 5,853 troops of which 837 were horsemen. Historian Ramsay Weston Phipps remarked that Beauregard&#x27;s men were &quot;bad troops under a bad General&quot;.

==Battle==

===15 October===

The Austrian covering force was entrenched and though Clerfayt was in nominal command, Coburg was on the scene and in control of the battle. Coburg was so certain of success that he was supposed to have said that if he were defeated, he would become a &quot;sans-culotte&quot;. This story made the rounds in the French army and made its soldiers eager to make the Coalition commander wear trousers.

On the morning of 15 October, Bellegarde held the Coalition right flank with about 5,000 troops in three battalions of foot and 16 squadrons of horse. The extreme right touched the Sambre at Berlaimont. Clerfayt defended the center with 9,200 soldiers, deployed along a west-to-east line of villages. Supported by division commanders were Franz Joseph, Count Kinsky and Joseph Karl von Lilien, Clerfayt controlled five battalions of grenadiers, five battalions of regulars, battalion of Croats, four infantry companies and 12 cavalry squadrons. Terzi was posted on the left flank at Wattignies with 4,000 men in three battalions of foot and 12 squadrons of horse. The extreme left at Obrechies was defended by Karl Joseph Hadik von Futak and 2,100 soldiers. Far to the east at Beaumont, Johann Andreas Benjowsky commanded 4,000 troops organized as three battalions and 12 squadrons.

From right to left the French divisions were Beauregard at Solre-le-Château, Duquesnoy on the main road from Avesnes-sur-Helpe, Balland in reserve at Avesnelles, Cordellier at La Capelle and Fromentin at Dompierre-sur-Helpe. Duquesnoy and Beauregard moved to attack Wattignies, while Fromentin advanced against the Austrian right flank. Jourdan enjoyed a two-to-one superiority and the Coalition generals had to be anxious about the 20,000 French soldiers at Maubeuge.

On the right, Beauregard&#x27;s men left Solre-le-Château at 7:00 am. Near Obrechies, four squadrons of Austrian cavalry charged them and drove them off, with the loss of three field guns. Duquesnoy&#x27;s division departed Flaumont at 6:00 am and marched through Beugnies, Dimont and Dimechaux. Supported by a plentiful artillery, the French infantry drove two Austrian battalions out of Wattignies, but as the French poured out of the other side of the village they were met by an infantry-cavalry counterattack. Duquesnoy&#x27;s soldiers abandoned Wattignies and retreated to Dimechaux and Dimont.

On the far left, Cordellier&#x27;s division advanced on Leval and Monceau-Saint-Waast while farther east, Fromentin&#x27;s division attacked toward Saint-Remy-Chaussée and Saint-Aubin. Bellegarde&#x27;s cannons opened fire in mid-morning, starting a mutual bombardment. The French infantry crossed a ravine and grappled for possession of Saint-Aubin village with a Croatian infantry battalion. In the afternoon Bellegarde launched a counterattack led by Austrian regular infantry, while two regiments of cavalry swept down on the French left flank. The Austrians captured eight French cannon and caused the French to flee to the safety of the ravine.

In the center, Clerfayt deployed five grenadier battalions in the villages of Dourlers, Mont-Dourlers, Floursies and along the Monceau Road. This east–west sunken road was located on a reverse slope, just south of Dourlers. The French Royalists and some Croatians guarded the forest to the east, while the Croatian battalion fought to the west at Saint-Aubin. The remaining battalions of Austrian regular foot and all the horse occupied a ridge behind the line of villages.

Jourdan, Carnot and Representative Ernest Dominique François Joseph Duquesnoy accompanied Balland&#x27;s division in the center. The army commander planned to wait for the attacks of his two wings to make significant progress before launching the attack of Balland&#x27;s division. In mid-morning, the division filed out of the woods in front of Dourlers and opened fire with its artillery. Seeing the initial success of the two wings, Carnot wanted the attack to be started at once. Jourdan wanted more ground to be gained on the flanks but the politician would not be denied. Finally, Jourdan put himself at the head of Balland&#x27;s division and ordered the assault. As the French soldiers came over the crest of the ridge in front on the sunken road, they came under murderous fire from the crack Austrian grenadiers. Despite heroic attempts to get light artillery forward, cannons were dismounted and gunners and horses were shot down. In the thick of the bullets, Jourdan bravely urged his troops on but an Austrian force appeared from the direction of Saint-Aubin, threatening the French left flank. At nightfall the representatives authorized a retreat after Balland&#x27;s division had lost between 1,200 and 1,500 casualties.

===16 October===
During the night, French deserters wrongly reported to the Austrians that Jourdan was reinforced to 100,000 men. Believing he was going to be attacked again, Coburg reinforced his covering force by five battalions of about 3,750 men and rearranged his defenses. On the left, Terzi had 5,250 foot soldiers in seven regular battalions and 2,100 cavalry in 14 squadrons. The center under Clerfayt counted 6,650 foot and 1,800 horse. This force was made up of five grenadier battalions, two regular battalions, of a battalion of Croats, four companies and six squadrons of French Royalists and six squadrons of cuirassiers. Bellegarde&#x27;s right wing was composed of 4,500 infantry in seven regular battalions and 2,100 light cavalry in 14 squadrons. Altogether, the covering force numbered about 16,400 infantry and 6,000 cavalry.

According to Carnot, he argued that Wattignies on the Austrian left was the key to the position but that Jourdan wanted to attack the Austrian right. Phipps believed that Carnot&#x27;s account was nonsense and that the course of the battle was typical of Jourdan&#x27;s tactics. Jourdan&#x27;s account only stated that he gave the order to attack Wattignies. Fromentin on the left was instructed not to mount a serious attack. Cordellier was ordered to act under Fromentin&#x27;s orders and also reinforce Balland with three battalions and a cavalry regiment. Balland was directed to place nine battalions plus two cavalry regiments at Jourdan&#x27;s disposal. The rest of Balland&#x27;s division was to form line of battle and use its light troops to probe the enemy positions. The divisions of Beauregard and Duquesnoy numbered 16,000 soldiers, to these, Jourdan&#x27;s special force added about 6,000 men.

On 16 October, Fromentin&#x27;s two divisions on the left flank and Balland&#x27;s division in the center skirmished all day. Bellegarde and Clerfayt held the bulk of their strength in their main positions. Jourdan mounted the main French assault against the height of Wattignies in three columns from Dimont, Dimechaux and Choisies. The main attack was also supported by additional artillery. When an early morning fog lifted in mid-morning, the French artillery opened a barrage on Wattignies. Duquesnoy&#x27;s division formed the two right columns while Jourdan&#x27;s detachment made up the left column. After being driven back twice by heavy fire, the French columns forced their way into Wattignies in the early afternoon. A counterattack from the northwest briefly pushed back the French, who were rallied by Jourdan. More French troops came up and defeated the Austrian attack. Duquesnoy sent Gratien&#x27;s brigade forward but it was caught by Austrian cavalry in the open and thrown back. By this time, the French had dragged a battery up to the Wattignies heights to support the infantry. Under pressure from infantry and artillery, Terzi&#x27;s division recoiled to the north. On the right of Duquesnoy, Beauregard&#x27;s division attacked Obrechies, which was defended by Hadik with two battalions of regulars and eight squadrons of cavalry. As the French began breaking into the village, Hadik launched attacks from three directions at once, routing Beauregard&#x27;s men. The French abandoned five cannon and fled back to Solrinnes. According to one observer, they did not stop until they reached Solre-le-Château.

===Boussu===
Far to the east, a column of French conscripts under Jacob Job Élie, set out from Philippeville toward Beaumont. In the early hours of 16 October, they were attacked by Coalition troops and fled. Élie managed to rally his soldiers and arrange them in two lines near Boussu-lez-Walcourt. At dawn when the Austrians attacked again, the second line fired a volley into the backs of the first line and all the infantry took to their heels. Louis Henri Loison capably covered the retreat with the French cavalry, saving the foot soldiers from being cut to pieces. As it was, Élie lost 400 men and 12 artillery pieces, while only 138 casualties were suffered by Benjowsky&#x27;s division.

==Results==
Prepared for a long battle, Jourdan reinforced Duquesnoy&#x27;s division at Wattignies and ordered it to entrench. The Duke of York arrived from the northwest with 3,500 men to reinforce Coburg. The Austrian commander-in-chief had plenty of soldiers but the Prince of Orange denied a request to send any of his soldiers to the south side of the Sambre. Fearful of a sortie by the large garrison of Maubeuge, Coburg lifted the siege and retreated across the river at Hautmont and Buissière. Chancel recommended an attack on the retreating army but Ferrand declined to intervene. The Maubeuge garrison made a weak sortie on 15 October but remained inert the next day. On 17 October, the garrison sent out a column to the south to meet with Jourdan, instead of to the north after the retreating Coalition forces.

The Coalition reported losses of 365 killed, 1,753 wounded and 369 captured or missing, a total of 2,487 casualties. French losses were estimated at 3,000. Another authority numbered French losses as 5,000 killed, wounded and missing. The Austrians sustained 2,500 killed and wounded while an additional 500 men were captured. A third source also gave casualty figures of 5,000 French and 3,000 Austrians and added that the French lost 27 artillery pieces. A fourth source estimated losses as 3,000 on each side. For the poor performance of the Maubeuge garrison, Chancel was blamed, arrested, convicted and guillotined. For the rout of his brigade, Gratien was arrested but eventually acquitted. Claude Lecourbe distinguished himself in the attack on Wattignies on 16 October. Édouard Mortier was wounded at Dourlers on 15 October. Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte fought in Balland&#x27;s division and Michel Ney was probably in Fromentin&#x27;s division.

==Aftermath==
Jourdan did not follow up his victory; after adding the Maubeuge garrison, he had about 60,000 French soldiers, opposed by 65,000 well-entrenched Coalition troops on the north bank of the Sambre, from Solesmes on the west to Thuin on the east. Though there was time for more operations, Coburg moved his army into winter quarters. While Jourdan was with the right wing of the &quot;Army of the North&quot;, the operations of the left wing under Davaine failed. Davaine was tried and executed at the same time as Chancel.

In Paris, Carnot demanded an advance on Charleroi and Jourdan tried to comply but found that the Coalition held all the river crossings and heavy rain had ruined the roads. After threatening to resign on 4 November, the army commander was recalled to Paris to speak with the Committee of Public Safety. This was the usual prelude to arrest and execution but Jourdan was allowed to return to the army and put his soldiers in winter quarters. After reinforcing the &quot;Army of the West&quot; and the &quot;Army of the Moselle&quot; each with 10,000 men, time was wasted in denouncing generals Duquesnoy, Meyer and Gudin. On 10 January 1794, Jourdan was accused of not protecting the frontier and summoned again to Paris. He was passionately defended by Representative Duquesnoy before the Committee of Public Safety and only dismissed from the army.

==Commentary==
The Carnot version of history is evident in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (1911) account:

Jourdan wished to renew the left attack, but Carnot, the engineer, considered the Wattignies plateau the key of the position and his opinion prevailed. In the night the nearly equal partition of force, which was largely responsible for the failure, was modified, and the strength of the attack massed opposite Wattignies.

Historian Michael Glover presented Carnot as a meddler and wrote of the politically powerful Committee of Public Safety member,

Carnot&#x27;s talents as &#x27;the organizer of victory&#x27; are beyond dispute, but his tactical skills were minimal, a defect he concealed by a careful rewriting of history. To drive away a poorly led covering force of 20,000 with the 45,000 available to the Army of the North should have posed no great problem, but the business was sadly bungled. Carnot insisted that there should be a double encircling movement, a favorite maneuver of his, combined with a frontal attack, thus carefully dispersing the French numerical superiority.

Carnot believed that General Duquesnoy was capable but recognized that Balland and Fromentin were not very good generals and had no use at all for Cordellier. Phipps pointed out that none of Jourdan&#x27;s division commanders fought under Napoleon. Jourdan later noted that Coburg erred by placing the Army of Observation too close to Maubeuge. He asserted that if Coburg had defended Avesnes-sur-Helpe, the relief army would have been in difficulty. He thought that Benjowsky&#x27;s force should have been posted at Obrechies. A British observer, Harry Calvert credited the powerful French artillery for the victory. Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron, a French Royalist who emigrated to the Russian Empire attributed the Coalition failure to the Dunkirk expedition that split the army, the retreat from Maubeuge, chronic slowness and the &quot;disastrous system of forming a cordon, which causes one to be weak everywhere&quot;.

Phipps summed up the failure of the Coalition with a cricket analogy.

The Allies totally failed to see that the best way to defend the length of the frontier was to concentrate and to crush Jourdan, and although they were well informed about his collecting troops at Guise, they allowed him to bring up slowly superior forces against one link of their long chain, as if their posts were so many players, each bound to defend his own wicket.

<text>The siege of Yorktown, also known as the Battle of Yorktown and the surrender at Yorktown, began September 28, 1781, and ended on October 19, 1781, at exactly 10:30 am in Yorktown, Virginia. It was a decisive victory by a combined force of the American Continental Army troops led by General George Washington with support from the Marquis de Lafayette and French Army troops led by the Comte de Rochambeau and a French naval force commanded by the Comte de Grasse over the British Army commanded by British Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis.

The siege of Yorktown was the last major land battle of the American Revolutionary War in North America, and led to the surrender of General Cornwallis and the capture of both him and his army. The Continental Army&#x27;s victory at Yorktown prompted the British government to negotiate an end to the conflict.

== Overview ==
In 1780, about 5,500 French soldiers landed in Rhode Island to help their American allies fight the British troops controlling New York City. Following the arrival of dispatches from France that included the possibility of support from the French West Indies fleet of the Comte de Grasse, disagreements arose between Washington and Rochambeau on whether to ask de Grasse for assistance in besieging New York or in military operations against a British army in Virginia. On the advice of Rochambeau, de Grasse informed them of his intent to sail to the Chesapeake Bay, where Cornwallis had taken command of the army. Cornwallis, at first given confusing orders by his superior officer, Henry Clinton, was eventually ordered to build a defensible deep-water port, which he began to do in Yorktown. Cornwallis&#x27; movements in Virginia were shadowed by a Continental Army force led by Marquis de Lafayette.

The French and American armies united north of New York City during the summer of 1781. When word of de Grasse&#x27;s decision arrived, both armies began moving south toward Virginia, engaging in deception tactics to lead the British to believe a siege of New York was planned. De Grasse sailed from the West Indies and arrived at the Chesapeake Bay at the end of August, bringing additional troops and creating a naval blockade of Yorktown. He was transporting 500,000 silver reales collected from the Spanish subject residents of Havana, Cuba, to fund supplies for the siege and payroll for the Continental Army. While in Santo Domingo, de Grasse met with Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis, an agent of King Charles III of Spain. De Grasse had planned to leave several of his warships in Santo Domingo. Saavedra promised the assistance of the Spanish Navy to protect the French merchant fleet, enabling de Grasse to sail north with all of his warships. In the beginning of September, he defeated a British fleet led by Sir Thomas Graves that came to relieve Cornwallis at the Battle of the Chesapeake. As a result of this victory, de Grasse blocked any reinforcement or escape by sea for Cornwallis and also disembarked the heavy siege guns required by the allied land forces. By late September, Washington and Rochambeau arrived, and the army and naval forces completely surrounded Cornwallis.

After initial preparations, the Americans and French built their first parallel and began the bombardment. With the British defense weakened, on October 14, 1781, Washington sent two columns to attack the last major remaining British outer defenses. A French column under Vicomte de Deux-Ponts took Redoubt No. 9 and an American column under Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Hamilton took Redoubt No. 10. With these defenses taken, the allies were able to finish their second parallel. With the Franco-American artillery closer and its bombardment more intense than ever, the British position began to deteriorate rapidly. Cornwallis asked for capitulation terms on October 17. After two days of negotiation, the surrender ceremony occurred on October 19; Cornwallis was absent from the ceremony. With the capture of more than 7,000 British soldiers, negotiations between the United States and Great Britain began, resulting in the Treaty of Paris of 1783.

The battlegrounds are preserved and interpreted today as part of Colonial National Historical Park.

==Prelude==

===Franco-American cooperation===
On December 20, 1780, Benedict Arnold sailed from New York with 1,500 British troops to Portsmouth, Virginia. He first raided Richmond, defeating the defending militia, from January 5–7 before falling back to Portsmouth. Admiral Destouches, who arrived in Newport, Rhode Island, in July 1780 with a fleet transporting 5,500 soldiers, was encouraged by Washington and French Lieutenant General Rochambeau to move his fleet south, and launch a joint land-naval attack on Arnold&#x27;s troops. The Marquis de Lafayette was sent south with 1,200 men to help with the assault. However, Destouches was reluctant to dispatch many ships, and in February sent only three. After they proved ineffective, he took a larger force of eight ships in March 1781, and fought a tactically inconclusive battle with the British fleet of Marriot Arbuthnot at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. Destouches withdrew due to the damage sustained to his fleet, leaving Arbuthnot and the British fleet in control of the bay&#x27;s mouth.

On March 26, Arnold was joined by 2,300 troops under command of Major General William Phillips, who took command of the combined forces. Phillips resumed raiding, defeating the militia at Blandford, then burning the tobacco warehouses at Petersburg on April 25. Richmond was about to suffer the same fate, but Lafayette arrived. The British, not wanting to engage in a major battle, withdrew to Petersburg on May 10.

On May 20, Charles Cornwallis arrived at Petersburg with 1,500 men after suffering heavy casualties at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse. He immediately assumed command, as Phillips had recently died of a fever. Cornwallis had not received permission to abandon the Carolinas from his superior, Henry Clinton, but he believed that Virginia would be easier to capture, feeling that it would approve of an invading British army.

With the arrival of Cornwallis and more reinforcements from New York, the British Army numbered 7,200 men. Cornwallis wanted to push Lafayette, whose force now numbered 3,000 men with the arrival of Virginia militia. On May 24, he set out after Lafayette, who withdrew from Richmond, and linked forces with those under the command of Baron von Steuben and Anthony Wayne. Cornwallis did not pursue Lafayette. Instead, he sent raiders into central Virginia, where they attacked depots and supply convoys, before being recalled on June 20. Cornwallis then headed for Williamsburg, and Lafayette&#x27;s force of now 4,500 followed him. General Clinton, in a confusing series of orders, ordered Cornwallis first to Portsmouth and then Yorktown, where he was instructed to build fortifications for a deep water port.

On July 6, the French and American armies met at White Plains, north of New York City. Although Rochambeau had almost 40 years of warfare experience, he never challenged Washington&#x27;s authority, telling Washington he had come to serve, not to command.

Washington and Rochambeau discussed where to launch a joint attack. Washington believed an attack on New York was the best option, since the Americans and French now outnumbered the British defenders 3 to 1. Rochambeau disagreed, arguing the fleet in the West Indies under Admiral de Grasse was going to sail to the American coast, where easier options than attacking New York could be attempted.

In early July, Washington suggested an attack be made at the northern part of Manhattan Island, but his officers and Rochambeau all disagreed. Washington continued to probe the New York area until August 14, when he received a letter from de Grasse stating he was headed for Virginia with 28 warships and 3,200 soldiers, but could only remain there until October 14. De Grasse encouraged Washington to move south so they could launch a joint operation. Washington abandoned his plan to take New York, and began to prepare his army for the march south to Virginia.

=== March to Virginia ===
On August 19, the &quot;celebrated march&quot; to Yorktown led by Washington and Rochambeau began. 7,000 soldiers (4,000 French and 3,000 American) began the march in Newport, Rhode Island, while the rest remained behind to protect the Hudson Valley. Washington wanted to maintain complete secrecy of their destination. To ensure this, he sent out fake dispatches that reached Clinton revealing that the Franco-American army was going to launch an attack on New York, and that Cornwallis was not in danger.

The French and American armies marched through Philadelphia from September 2 to 4, where the American soldiers announced they would not leave Maryland until they received one month&#x27;s pay in coin, rather than in the worthless Continental paper currency. &quot;Count de Rochambeau very readily agreed at Chester to supply at the Head of Elk twenty thousand hard dollars&quot;, half of his supply of gold Spanish coins. This would be the last time the men would be paid. This strengthened French and American relations. On September 5, Washington learned of the arrival of de Grasse&#x27;s fleet off the Virginia Capes. De Grasse debarked his French troops to join Lafayette, and then sent his empty transports to pick up the American troops. Washington made a visit to his home, Mount Vernon, on his way to Yorktown.
In August, Admiral Sir Thomas Graves led a fleet from New York to attack de Grasse&#x27;s fleet. Graves did not realize how large the French fleet was, and neither did Cornwallis. The British fleet was defeated by de Grasse&#x27;s fleet in the Battle of the Chesapeake on September 5, and forced to fall back to New York. On September 14, Washington arrived in Williamsburg, Virginia.

==Siege==


===Initial movements===
On September 26, transports with artillery, siege tools, and some French infantry and shock troops from Head of Elk, the northern end of the Chesapeake Bay, arrived, giving Washington command of an army of 7,800 Frenchmen, 3,100 militia, and 8,000 Continentals. Early on September 28, Washington led the army out of Williamsburg to surround Yorktown. The French took the positions on the left while the Americans took the position of honor on the right. Cornwallis had a chain of seven redoubts and batteries linked by earthworks along with batteries that covered the narrows of the York River at Gloucester Point. That day, Washington reconnoitered the British defenses, and decided that they could be bombarded into submission. The Americans and the French spent the night of the 28th sleeping out in the open, while work parties built bridges over the marsh. Some of the American soldiers hunted down wild hogs to eat.

On September 29, Washington moved the army closer to Yorktown, and British gunners opened fire on the infantry. Throughout the day, several British cannon fired on the Americans, but there were few casualties. Fire was also exchanged between American riflemen and Hessian Jägers.

Cornwallis pulled back from all of his outer defenses, except for the Fusilier&#x27;s redoubt on the west side of the town and redoubts 9 and 10 in the east. Cornwallis had his forces occupy the earthworks immediately surrounding the town because he had received a letter from Clinton that promised relief force of 5,000 men within a week and he wished to tighten his lines. The Americans and the French occupied the abandoned defenses and began to establish their batteries there. With the British outer defenses in their hands, allied engineers began to lay out positions for the artillery. The men improved their works and deepened their trenches. The British also worked on improving their defenses.

On September 30, the French attacked the British Fusiliers redoubt. The skirmish lasted two hours, in which the French were repulsed, suffering several casualties. On October 1, the allies learned from British deserters that, to preserve their food, the British had slaughtered hundreds of horses and thrown them on the beach. In the American camp, thousands of trees were cut down to provide wood for earthworks. Preparations for the parallel also began.

As the allies began to put their artillery into place, the British kept up a steady fire to disrupt them. British fire increased on the 2nd and the allies suffered moderate casualties. General Washington continued to make visits to the front, despite concern shown by several of his officers over the increasing enemy fire. On the night of October 2, the British opened a storm of fire to cover up the movement of the British cavalry to Gloucester where they were to escort infantrymen on a foraging party. On the 3rd, the foraging party, led by Banastre Tarleton, went out but collided with Lauzun&#x27;s Legion, and John Mercer&#x27;s Virginia militia, led by the Marquis de Choisy. The British cavalry quickly retreated behind their defensive lines, losing 50 men.

By October 5, Washington was almost ready to open the first parallel. That night the sappers and miners worked, putting strips of pine on the wet sand to mark the path of the trenches. The main/ initial movements of this battle were walking and riding horses.

===Bombardment===
After nightfall on October 6, troops moved out in stormy weather to dig the first parallel: the heavily overcast sky negated the waning full moon and shielded the massive digging operation from the eyes of British sentries. Washington ceremoniously struck several blows with his pickaxe to begin the trench. The trench was to be long, running from the head of Yorktown to the York River. Half of the trench was to be commanded by the French, the other half by the Americans. On the northernmost end of the French line, a support trench was dug so that they could bombard the British ships in the river. The French were ordered to distract the British with a false attack, but the British were told of the plan by a French deserter and the British artillery fire turned on the French from the Fusiliers redoubt.
On October 7, the British saw the new allied trench just out of musket-range. Over the next two days, the allies completed the gun placements and dragged the artillery into line. The British fire began to weaken when they saw the large number of guns the allies had.

By October 9, all of the French and American guns were in place. Among the American guns there were three twenty-four pounders, three eighteen pounders, two eight-inch (203 mm) howitzers and six mortars, totaling fourteen guns. At 3:00 pm, the French guns opened the barrage and drove the British frigate across the York River, where she was scuttled to prevent capture. At 5:00 pm, the Americans opened fire. Washington fired the first gun; legend has it that this shot smashed into a table where British officers were eating. The Franco-American guns began to tear apart the British defenses. Washington ordered that the guns fire all night so that the British could not make repairs. All of the British guns on the left were soon silenced. The British soldiers began to pitch their tents in their trenches and soldiers began to desert in large numbers. Some British ships were also damaged by cannonballs that flew across the town into the harbor.

On October 10, the Americans spotted a large house in Yorktown. Believing that Cornwallis might be stationed there, they aimed at it and quickly destroyed it. Cornwallis sank more than a dozen of his ships in the harbor. The French began to fire at the British ships and scored a hit on the British , which caught fire, and in turn set two or three other ships on fire. Cornwallis received word from Clinton that the British fleet was to depart on October 12, however Cornwallis responded by saying that he would not be able to hold out for long.

On the night of October 11, Washington ordered that the Americans dig a second parallel. It was closer to the British lines, but could not be extended to the river because the British number 9 and 10 redoubts were in the way. During the night, the British fire continued to land in the old line; Cornwallis did not suspect that a new parallel was being dug. By morning of the 12th, the allied troops were in position on the new line.

===Assault on the redoubts===

By October 14, the trenches were within of Redoubt Nos. 9 and 10. Washington ordered that all guns within range begin blasting the redoubts to weaken them for an assault that evening. Washington planned to use the cover of a moonless night to gain the element of surprise. To reinforce the darkness, he added silence, ordering that no soldier should load his musket until reaching the fortifications; the advance would be made with only &quot;cold steel.&quot; Redoubt No. 10 was near the river and held by only 70 men, while redoubt 9 was a quarter-mile inland, and was held by 120 British and Germans. Both redoubts were heavily fortified with rows of abatis surrounding them, along with muddy ditches that surrounded the redoubts at about . Washington’s officers devised a plan in which the French would launch a diversionary attack on the Fusiliers redoubt, and then a half an hour later, the French would assault Redoubt No. 9 and the Americans Redoubt No. 10. Redoubt No. 9 would be assaulted by 400 French regular soldiers of the Royal Deux-Ponts Regiment under the command of the Count of Deux-Ponts and redoubt 10 would be assaulted by 400 light infantry troops under the command of Alexander Hamilton. There was a brief dispute as to who should lead the attack on Redoubt No. 10. Lafayette named his aide, Jean-Joseph Sourbader de Gimat, who commanded a battalion of Continental light infantry. However, Hamilton protested, saying that he was the senior officer. Washington concurred with Hamilton and gave him command of the attack.
At 6:30 pm, gunfire announced the diversionary attack on the Fusiliers redoubt. At other places in the line, movements were made as if preparing for an assault on Yorktown itself, which caused the British to panic. With bayonets fixed, the Americans marched towards Redoubt No. 10. Hamilton sent Lieutenant Colonel John Laurens around to the rear of the redoubt to prevent the British from escaping. The Americans reached the redoubt and began chopping through the British wooden defenses with their axes. A British sentry called a challenge, and then fired at the Americans. The Americans responded by charging with their bayonets towards the redoubt. They hacked through the abatis, crossed a ditch and climbed the parapet into the redoubt. The Americans forced their way into the redoubt, falling into giant shell holes created by the preparatory bombardment. The British fire was heavy, but the Americans overwhelmed them. Someone in the front shouted, &quot;Rush on boys! The fort&#x27;s ours!&quot; The British threw hand grenades at the Americans with little effect. Men in the trench stood on the shoulders of their comrades to climb into the redoubt. The bayonet fight cleared the British from the redoubt and almost the entire garrison was captured, including the commander of the redoubt, Major Campbell. In the assault, the Americans lost 9 dead and 25 wounded.

The French assault began at the same time, but they were halted by the abatis, which was undamaged by the artillery fire. The French began to hack at the abatis and a Hessian sentry came out and asked who was there. When there was no response, the sentry opened fire as did other Hessians on the parapet. The French soldiers fired back, and then charged the redoubt. The Germans charged the Frenchmen climbing over the walls but the French fired a volley, driving them back. The Hessians then took a defensive position behind some barrels but threw down their arms and surrendered when the French prepared a bayonet charge.

With the capture of Redoubts Nos. 9 and 10, Washington was able to have his artillery shell the town from three directions and the allies moved some of their artillery into the redoubts. On October 15, Cornwallis turned all of his guns onto the nearest allied position. He then ordered a storming party of 350 British troops under the command of Colonel Robert Abercromby to attack the allied lines and spike the American and French cannon (i.e., plug the touch hole with an iron spike). The allies were sleeping and unprepared. As the British charged Abercromby shouted &quot;Push on my brave boys, and skin the bastards!&quot; The British party spiked several cannons in the parallel and then spiked the guns on an unfinished redoubt. A French party came and drove them out of the allied lines and back to Yorktown. The British had been able to spike six guns, but by the morning they were all repaired. The bombardment resumed with the American and French troops engaged in competition to see who could do the most damage to the enemy defenses.

On the morning of October 16, more allied guns were in line and the fire intensified. In desperation, Cornwallis attempted to evacuate his troops across the York River to Gloucester Point. At Gloucester Point, the troops might be able to break through the allied lines and escape into Virginia and then march to New York. One wave of boats made it across, but a squall hit when they returned to take more soldiers, making the evacuation impossible.

===British surrender===

The fire on Yorktown from the allies was heavier than ever as new artillery pieces joined the line. Cornwallis talked with his officers that day and they agreed that their situation was hopeless.

On the morning of October 17, a drummer appeared, followed by an officer waving a white handkerchief. The bombardment ceased, and the officer was blindfolded and led behind the French and American lines. Negotiations began at the Moore House on October 18 between Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Dundas and Major Alexander Ross (who represented the British) and Lieutenant Colonel Laurens (who represented the Americans) and Marquis de Noailles (who represented the French). To make sure that nothing fell apart between the French and Americans at the last minute, Washington ordered that the French be given an equal share in every step of the surrender process. At 2:00 pm the allied army entered the British positions, with the French on the left and the Americans on the right.
The British had asked for the traditional honors of war, which would allow the army to march out with flags flying, bayonets fixed, and the band playing an American or French tune as a tribute to the victors. However, Washington firmly refused to grant the British the honors that they had denied the defeated American army the year before at the siege of Charleston. Consequently, the British and Hessian troops marched with flags furled and muskets shouldered, while the band was forced to play &quot;a British or German march.&quot; American history books recount the legend that the British band played &quot;The World Turn&#x27;d Upside Down&quot;, but the story may be apocryphal.
Cornwallis refused to attend the surrender ceremony, claiming that he had an illness. Instead, Brigadier General Charles O&#x27;Hara led the British army onto the field. O&#x27;Hara first attempted to surrender to Rochambeau, who shook his head and pointed to Washington. O&#x27;Hara then offered his sword to Washington, who also refused and motioned to Major General Benjamin Lincoln, his second-in-command. The surrender finally took place when Lincoln accepted the sword of Cornwallis&#x27; deputy.

The British soldiers marched out and laid down their arms in between the French and American armies, while many civilians watched. At this time, the troops on the other side of the river in Gloucester also surrendered. The British soldiers had been issued new uniforms hours before the surrender and until prevented by General O&#x27;Hara some threw down their muskets with the apparent intention of smashing them. Others wept or appeared to be drunk. In all, 8,000 soldiers, 214 artillery pieces, thousands of muskets, 24 transport ships, wagons, and horses were captured.

===Effect of disease===
Malaria was endemic in the marshlands of eastern Virginia during the time, and Cornwallis&#x27;s army suffered greatly from the disease; he estimated during the surrender that half of his army was unable to fight as a result. The Continental Army enjoyed an advantage, in that most of their members had grown up with malaria, and hence had acquired resistance to the disease. As malaria has a month-long incubation period, most of the French soldiers had not begun to exhibit symptoms before the surrender.

==Articles of capitulation==
The articles of capitulation, outlining the terms and conditions of surrender for officers, soldiers, military supplies, and personal property, were signed on October 19, 1781. Signatories included Washington, Rochambeau, the Comte de Barras (on behalf of the French Navy), Cornwallis, and Captain Thomas Symonds (the senior Royal Navy officer present). Cornwallis&#x27; men were declared prisoners of war and promised good treatment in American camps, and officers were permitted to return home after taking their parole.

===Article 10 controversy===
George Washington refused to accept the Tenth Article of the Yorktown Articles of Capitulation, which granted immunity to provincials, and Cornwallis failed to make any effort to press the matter. &quot;The outcry against the Tenth Article was vociferous and immediate, as Americans on both sides of the Atlantic proclaimed their sense of betrayal.&quot;

==Aftermath==
Following the surrender, the American and French officers entertained the British officers to dinner. The British officers were &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by the civility their erstwhile foes extended to them, with some French officers offering &quot;profuse&quot; sympathies for the defeat, as one British officer, Captain Samuel Graham, commented. Equally, the French aide to Rochambeau, Cromot du Bourg, noted the coolness of the British officers, particularly O&#x27;Hara, considering the defeat they had endured.

Five days after the battle ended, on October 24, 1781, the British fleet sent by Clinton to rescue the British army arrived. The fleet picked up several provincials who had escaped on October 18, and they informed Admiral Thomas Graves that they believed Cornwallis had surrendered. Graves picked up several more provincials along the coast, and they confirmed this fact. Graves sighted the French Fleet, but chose to leave because he was outnumbered by nine ships, and thus he sent the fleet back to New York.

On October 25, Washington issued an order which stipulated that all fugitive slaves who had joined the British were to be rounded up by the Continental Army and placed under the supervision of armed guards in fortified positions on both sides of the York River until arrangements could be made to return them to their enslavers. Historian Gregory J. W. Urwin describes Washington&#x27;s action as &quot;[converting] his faithful Continentals—the men credited with winning American independence—into an army of slave catchers.&quot;

After the British surrender, Washington sent Tench Tilghman to report the victory to Congress. After a difficult journey, he arrived in Philadelphia, which celebrated for several days. The British Prime Minister, Lord North, is reported to have exclaimed &quot;Oh God, it&#x27;s all over&quot; when told of the defeat. Three months after the battle, a motion to end &quot;further prosecution of offensive warfare on the continent of North America&quot;—effectively a no confidence motion—passed in the British House of Commons. Lord North and his government resigned.

Washington moved his army to New Windsor, New York where they remained stationed until the Treaty of Paris was signed on September 3, 1783, formally ending the war. Although the peace treaty did not happen for two years following the end of the battle, the Yorktown campaign proved to be decisive; there was no significant battle or campaign on the North American mainland after the Battle of Yorktown and in March 1782, &quot;the British Parliament had agreed to cease hostilities.&quot;

==Legacy==
On October 19, 1881, an elaborate ceremony took place to honor the battle&#x27;s centennial. U.S. naval vessels floated on Chesapeake Bay, and
special markers highlighted where Washington and Lafayette&#x27;s siege guns were placed. President Chester Arthur, sworn in only thirty days before, following James Garfield&#x27;s death, made his first public speech as president. Also present were descendants of Lafayette, Rochambeau, de Grasse, and Steuben. To close the ceremony, Arthur gave an order to salute the British flag.

There is a belief that General Cornwallis&#x27;s sword, surrendered by Charles O&#x27;Hara after the battle, is to this day on display at the White House. However, U.S. National Park Service historian Jerome Green, in his 2005 history of the siege, &quot;The Guns of Independence&quot;, concurs with the 1881 centennial account by Johnston, noting simply that when Brigadier General O&#x27;Hara presented the sword to Major General Lincoln, he held it for a moment and immediately returned it to O&#x27;Hara.

The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have preserved 49 battlefield acres outside of the national park as of mid-2023.

The siege of Yorktown is also known in some German historiographies as &quot;die deutsche Schlacht&quot; (&quot;the German battle&quot;), because Germans played significant roles in all three armies, accounting for roughly one third of all forces involved. According to one estimate more than 2,500 German soldiers served at Yorktown with each of the British and French armies, and more than 3,000 German Americans were in Washington&#x27;s army.

Four Army National Guard units (113th Inf, 116th Inf, 175th Inf, and 198th Sig Bn) and one active Regular Army Field Artillery battalion (1–5th FA) are derived from American units that participated in the Battle of Yorktown. There are thirty current U.S. Army units with lineages that go back to the colonial era.

== Yorktown Victory Monument ==

Five days after the British surrendered, Congress passed a resolution agreeing to erect a structure dedicated to commemorating those who participated in the battle. Construction of the monument was delayed, however, as the Confederation government had several other financial obligations that were considered to be of a more urgent nature. In 1834, the citizens of Yorktown asked Congress for the monument to be constructed, and then followed up once again in 1836, but still no action was taken. The desirability of the project was recognized in 1876 &quot;when a memorial from the Common Council of Fredericksburg, Virginia was before Congress.&quot;

The project was postponed once again until the battle&#x27;s centennial sparked renewed enthusiasm in the resolution and prompted the government to begin building the monument in 1881 amid national support. The crowning figure was set on August 12, 1884; the structure was officially reported in a communication as complete on January 5, 1885, and currently resides within Colonial National Historical Park. The artists commissioned by the Secretary of War for the monument project included Mr. R. M. Hunt (Chairman) and Mr. J. Q. A. Ward (Architect) of New York and Mr. Henry Van Brunt (Sculptor) of Boston.

== Yorktown sesquicentennial and bicentennial celebrations ==
A four-day celebration to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the siege took place in Yorktown on October 16–19, 1931. It was presided over by the Governor of Virginia John Garland Pollard and attended by then President Herbert Hoover along with French representatives. The event included the official dedication of the Colonial National Historical Park, which also includes Historic Jamestown. President Ronald Reagan visited Yorktown in 1981 for the bicentennial celebration.

<text>Fountains of Wayne is an American rock band that formed in New York City in 1995. The band included founding members Chris Collingwood, Adam Schlesinger, Jody Porter, and Brian Young. They released six albums from 1996 to 2011 before effectively disbanding in 2013. They are best known for the Grammy-nominated song &quot;Stacy&#x27;s Mom&quot;.

Schlesinger died of complications from COVID-19 on April 1, 2020, and the surviving members of Fountains of Wayne reunited to perform an online one-shot concert as a tribute to Schlesinger on April 22, 2020.

==History==

===1995–2001: Early years===
After Montclair-based Adam Schlesinger and Sellersville-based Chris Collingwood first met as freshmen at Williams College, they played music in various bands and eventually went their separate ways, with Collingwood forming the Mercy Buckets in Boston and Schlesinger forming Ivy in New York City. In the mid-1990s, they came together to form Fountains of Wayne, named after a lawn ornament store in Wayne, New Jersey that closed in 2009. The store features in an episode of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, &quot;Another Toothpick&quot;. At first Collingwood hated the name but eventually warmed to it. Previous band names included Wallflowers, Woolly Mammoth, Are You My Mother? and Three Men Who When Standing Side by Side Have a Wingspan of Over Twelve Feet. The band cut a demo and signed with Atlantic Records, then recruited guitarist Jody Porter and still-active Posies drummer Brian Young after recording their debut album. Young got in touch with a friend who worked at Fountains of Wayne&#x27;s label to see if there were any job openings, and when he auditioned for the band, they asked him to play the beat of &quot;Swingtown&quot; by Steve Miller Band.

Though Collingwood and Schlesinger shared cowriter credit for all original Fountains of Wayne material, for most of their career together, they wrote their songs separately. In 2005 Collingwood said, &quot;We decided early on, it&#x27;s better to not have arguments that some bands have where someone might say, &#x27;I wrote 15% of that song,&#x27; and try to figure out those numbers. It just seems ridiculous.&quot; Schlesinger added, &quot;We just agreed many years ago that if we were to have a band we&#x27;d just split the songwriting to avoid having a conversation every time we tried to finish a song. But we really haven&#x27;t collaborated as writers in years. And that&#x27;s kind of intentional too because we didn&#x27;t want it to turn into a thing where people would say, &#x27;Adam&#x27;s songs are like this...&#x27; We wanted the band to have an identity more than we wanted each of us to have an identity in the band.&quot;

In 1996, the band released its self-titled debut, which spawned the singles &quot;Radiation Vibe&quot; and &quot;Sink to the Bottom&quot;, and the band toured the world extensively behind its debut album, playing alongside bands including the Smashing Pumpkins, Sloan, and the Lemonheads. That same year, Schlesinger wrote the Academy Award-nominated, RIAA gold-certified title song for the film &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot;.

In 1999, the band released &quot;Utopia Parkway&quot;, an album named after a road in Queens, New York. The album was a concept record that dealt with life in modern suburbia. &quot;Utopia Parkway&quot; was received well by critics, garnering many favorable reviews, and was album of the week in &quot;People&quot; magazine. The group once again toured extensively behind the album, but frustrations grew between the band and the label. The band was later dropped by Atlantic in late 1999.

The band was inactive for a period of time. Collingwood, in particular, had a difficult time coping with the band being dropped by their label. In 2004 he said, &quot;When we got dropped from Atlantic, it&#x27;s my fault that it took so long, because I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to keep doing it. At the end of four years of the hardest work I&#x27;d ever done in my life, more traveling and being away from my wife the whole time, I had nothing to show for it. I got back home and I had nothing. I was broke, I was demoralized, I was exhausted. I think I just needed a year to recharge my batteries.&quot;

Schlesinger cowrote many of the songs for the &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; film and soundtrack, produced albums for Verve Pipe, David Mead, and They Might Be Giants, and released a third record with his other band, Ivy. Collingwood formed and fronted a Northampton, Massachusetts-based pop-country band called Gay Potatoes, and played a string of solo shows in the Boston and Los Angeles areas; Gay Potatoes was officially retired on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2010. Guitarist Jody Porter worked with his band, The Astrojet, alongside famed producer Gordon Raphael and keyboardist David Zhang in New York City. Percussionist Brian Young moved to Los Angeles and did session work for various artists such as producer Steve Fisk, Ivy, Heather Duby, and Greg Dulli.

===2001–2013: Commercial success and breakup===
The band reunited to record a cover of the Kinks&#x27; &quot;Better Things&quot; for the tribute album, &quot;This Is Where I Belong: Songs of Ray Davies and the Kinks&quot;, in 2001, and began to discuss plans for a new album. In 2003, the band released &quot;Welcome Interstate Managers&quot;, a successful album that spawned the hit single &quot;Stacy&#x27;s Mom&quot;, which Adam Schlesinger says was a tribute to the Cars. Initially the single stalled at commercial alternative radio in the US, but MTV President Judy McGrath championed the single&#x27;s music video, a &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; homage featuring Rachel Hunter. Ultimately Stacy&#x27;s Mom was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America and was nominated for Best Vocal Pop Performance at the 2004 Grammys. Another song off the album, &quot;All Kinds of Time&quot;, was used for NFL commercial promotions during the 2005 season.

In 2005, the band released &quot;Out-of-State Plates&quot;, a collection of B-sides and two new songs. The compilation was supported by the single &quot;Maureen&quot; and a limited US tour that included some acoustic-only sets, a set on PBS &quot;Soundstage&quot;, and an appearance in the American Songbook concert series at Lincoln Center. Also included on the album is a 1999 cover of the Britney Spears hit, &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot;.

Also in 2005, Robbie Fulks released a song in honor of the band called &quot;Fountains of Wayne Hotline&quot;.

In 2006, while on tour in Tokyo, Collingwood had a mental breakdown in which he hadn&#x27;t slept for four days, experienced hallucinations for two days and didn&#x27;t believe that he was in Tokyo to play in front of 25,000. The show was cancelled and Collingwood was taken to an emergency department, followed by recovery in a mental hospital after returning to the US.

In 2007, the band released &quot;Traffic and Weather&quot;, an album which included the song &quot;I-95&quot;, which &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named No. 54 of the year&#x27;s top 100 songs. Collingwood had less involvement during the making of the album due to his struggles with depression and alcoholism, only managing to contribute three songs.

In 2008, Porter released his debut solo album &quot;Close to the Sun&quot;, a collection of songs he had written and recorded over a period of years in between Fountains of Wayne albums and tours.
In 2009, the band released &quot;No Better Place: Live In Chicago&quot;, a live concert DVD which included newly recorded acoustic songs. Also that year, they played a short run of full-band acoustic shows where they showcased songs from their forthcoming album.

In 2010, Fountains of Wayne commenced work on their fifth album, which was influenced by the recent acoustic tours they had done. According to Porter, &quot;It&#x27;s a little bit more introspective and not as loud of a record as the last two. I think that came from the fact that we started last year doing acoustic-based tours because we didn&#x27;t have a record out. We wanted to get back out on tour and did it stripped-down. Overall it&#x27;s not as brash or guitar-heavy.&quot;

In 2011, the band released &quot;Sky Full of Holes&quot;, an album put out in Japan by Warner Music Japan (with two bonus tracks), Europe by Lojinx, and the U.S. by Yep Roc Records. The now-sober Collingwood once again became more involved, but this turned out to be the hardest album for them to make. According to Collingwood in 2013, &quot;The most recent record was definitely the hardest that we&#x27;ve ever done. I think I&#x27;m partly to blame for that. I checked out on the previous record, so when I came back in, I had to assert myself. Every single thing about that record was a fight. It was not this blissful reconciliation that led to the release; it was a brutal thing right up to the end. We&#x27;ll see what happens if we end up making another record.&quot;

The band toured &quot;Sky Full of Holes&quot; into 2012. After about a one-year layoff, they played a number of U.S. dates in September and October 2013, on a tour with Soul Asylum and Evan Dando. They also issued one final new track in 2013, &quot;Trucks&quot;, written and produced by Sandra Boynton for Boynton&#x27;s kid-friendly various artists album &quot;Frog Trouble&quot;. The final Fountains of Wayne show took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on October 19, 2013.

===2013–2020: Post-breakup===
The band never issued an official announcement that they had broken up. However, by 2016, all the members were speaking of Fountains of Wayne in the past tense. Neither Schlesinger nor Collingwood had ruled out a future reunion, but both saw the possibility as remote. &quot;I try never to say never,&quot; Collingwood said, &quot;but it&#x27;s staggering to think of everything that would have to happen for me to want to repeat that experience.&quot;

In 2016, Collingwood released what was essentially a solo album that was issued under the group name Look Park. At the time of the album release, he elaborated on Fountains of Wayne&#x27;s demise by saying, &quot;When we were recording the record before the last Fountains of Wayne record, which was called &quot;Traffic and Weather&quot;, I didn&#x27;t really have a whole lot to contribute to that album. I was out to lunch a little bit, mentally, and just drinking too much. And I think that the fact that I sort of removed myself from the process at that point made it really easier for Adam to take over. And when I was ready to actually make another album, you know, several years later after I&#x27;d sort of cleaned up my act, it was very difficult. It was very, very hard to get back into the position where we were equals.&quot;

Porter and Young joined Schlesinger in 2016 on the Monkees&#x27; album &quot;Good Times!&quot; and again in 2018 on the group&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Party&quot;. Schlesinger produced and wrote songs for both albums.

Schlesinger and Collingwood, meanwhile, remained distant. &quot;I don&#x27;t even know where Adam lives now,&quot; Collingwood told an interviewer in 2019.

===2020: Death of Schlesinger and reunion===
Adam Schlesinger died of complications from COVID-19 on April 1, 2020.

The surviving members of Fountains of Wayne performed together for the first time since 2013 on April 22, 2020, as part of a charity livestream event to raise funding for the New Jersey Pandemic Relief Fund. The performance was a tribute to Schlesinger, and featured Sharon Van Etten taking his place on bass guitar.

On February 12, 2025, multiple posts from official band social media announced Fountains of Wayne&#x27;s appearance at Milwaukee&#x27;s Summerfest on July 4, 2025. Max Collins of the band Eve 6 was announced as the bassist for this show. Adam Schlesinger&#x27;s family gave their blessings for the reunion, with Steven M. Gold - the band&#x27;s longtime touring keyboardist as well as Schlesinger&#x27;s producing and songwriting partner - also participating.

==Musical style==
Andrew Leahey of AllMusic called Fountains of Wayne &quot;one of America&#x27;s strongest power pop acts&quot; and described their sound as &quot;a mix of British-influenced pop songs, lo-fi production, and wry lyrics about dead-end jobs and biker boyfriends.&quot;

<text>The Ataris are an American punk rock band from Anderson, Indiana. Formed in 1996, they released five studio albums between 1997 and 2007. Their best-selling album is &quot;So Long, Astoria&quot; (2003), which was certified gold. Their high-charting single is their cover of Don Henley&#x27;s &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot; from &quot;So Long, Astoria&quot;. The only constant member throughout their history has been singer/songwriter/guitarist Kristopher &quot;Kris&quot; Roe.

==History==

===Kung Fu Records (1996–2001)===
Formed on November 1, 1996, and with the band&#x27;s name a reference to the large collection of Atari video game cartridges of Roe, the band originally consisted of singer, songwriter, and guitarist Kristopher Roe and guitarist Jasin Thomason. Using a 4-track, Roe wrote and recorded demos in his bedroom, using a drum machine while he searched for a full-time drummer. The band&#x27;s first big break came in 1996 when Roe attended a show at the club Bogart&#x27;s in Cincinnati, where Thomason passed one of the band&#x27;s demo tapes to a roadie from the band. The roadie gave the tape to Joe Escalante, bassist from the band the Vandals who owned their own label, Kung Fu Records. A few weeks later, Roe received a call from Kung Fu Records, who told him they were interested in putting out their record, even though he was really only searching for a drummer. The Ataris signed to Kung Fu and the label passed the tape along to various drummers. Eventually, Roe decided upon ex-Lagwagon drummer Derrick Plourde. The band then proceeded to record their debut album &quot;Anywhere but Here&quot;, tracking the whole thing in less than a week. The album was released on April 29, 1997 and the band held a release show party at Missing Link Records in Indianapolis on May 2.

In June 1997, Roe moved from Anderson, Indiana to Santa Barbara, California. Shortly afterward, Marko Desantis joined the band on bass for a short time. Thomason decided to leave the band to stay in Indiana, and the group toured as a three-piece for a short while. After a brief tour in October 1997, this lineup disbanded. Roe, out of money and living in a van, contemplated moving back to Indiana. But the band still had an upcoming tour booked with Dance Hall Crashers and Unwritten Law, so Roe decided to give the band one more shot. He got his friend from Santa Barbara, Mike Davenport, to play bass. Davenport shared a small rehearsal space on East Haley Street with his friend Marco Peña, who was in a different band. One day at the rehearsal space, Roe and Davenport heard the drummer of Peña&#x27;s band, Chris Knapp, playing and immediately asked him to join the Ataris. While Roe and Davenport joked that Peña would be upset over them &quot;stealing&quot; his band&#x27;s drummer, Peña surprised them by showing up at their practice the next day, strapping on his guitar, and playing along. It turned out Peña had learned all the songs from &quot;Anywhere But Here&quot;. He joined the band as a second guitarist and the foursome went on their scheduled tour. However, Peña soon left the band for personal reasons and was replaced by Patrick Riley.

From there, the band gradually increased in popularity in the underground rock scene due to their consistent touring and personal, DIY approach to the band. They then found more success with their 1998 EP &quot;Look Forward to Failure&quot;, released on San Francisco punk label Fat Wreck Chords. However, it wasn&#x27;t until the release of &quot;Blue Skies, Broken Hearts...Next 12 Exits&quot; in 1999 that they started to gain widespread acclaim. The album&#x27;s name comes from the name of a mobile home park along Highway 101 in Santa Barbara. Also, &quot;...next 12 exits&quot; refers to a nearby sign on Highway 101 North that reads &quot;Santa Barbara, Next 12 Exits&quot;. The album contained personal, storytelling lyrics. After this album, Riley left the band to go back to school, and Marco Peña re-joined the band. In 2001 the band took part in the Vans Warped Tour. The band&#x27;s third full-length studio album, &quot;End Is Forever&quot;, was also released in 2001.

===&quot;So Long, Astoria&quot; (2002–2004)===
In 2002, the lineup changed again, with John Collura replacing Peña on guitar. Prior to this, Collura had played in his own band Beefcake who&#x27;d toured with the Ataris. He&#x27;d also done time on tour as a guitar tech for the Ataris just prior to Peña&#x27;s departure.

During this same period, the Ataris&#x27; contract with Kung Fu Records expired, and the band chose to sign with Columbia Records. Later that year, they began recording their fourth full-length album and major label debut, &quot;So Long, Astoria&quot;, released on March 4, 2003. Produced by Lou Giordano, the album&#x27;s production served as a stark contrast to any of the band&#x27;s past releases, as previous efforts were recorded in short time spans between tours.

&quot;So Long, Astoria&quot; was widely credited for introducing the Ataris to a larger mainstream audience and generating several successful singles, including &quot;In This Diary&quot; and &quot;The Saddest Song&quot;. Musically, the album showcased very personal, encrypted and slightly more optimistic songwriting with a more refined, straightforward rock sound, not unlike Jimmy Eat World. This album also included their hit cover song, originally recorded by Don Henley, &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot;, which much to the dismay of the band became their &quot;accidental&quot; second single after the radio station KROQ in Los Angeles started playing it, even though the band had already chosen the song &quot;My Reply&quot; as their second single. The single is their highest-charting single to date, reaching No. 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

The band toured behind this record for most of 2003 and into early 2004 adding another guitarist (Joseph A. Farriella) to the band. That year also saw the release of a low-key live album, &quot;Live At The Metro&quot;, along with a track on the Spider-Man 2 soundtrack. So Long, Astoria sold well in excess of 700,000 copies and was certified gold. After a number of personal, financial and artistic differences, this line-up decided to go its separate ways over the summer and fall of 2004.

Davenport, interested in playing heavier music, became a founding member of the band Versus the World, while Knapp stopped playing music altogether and stayed in Santa Barbara. Details regarding the departures of Knapp and Davenport have been kept quiet for sometime, and neither camp has appeared interested in fueling any public debate or ill-will. Looking for some time off, Roe headed back to Indiana while Collura, Farriella moved back to New York; though they would later regroup to begin the recordings of the band’s next album

===&quot;Welcome the Night&quot; (2005–2007)===
After some time off, Roe and Collura later moved forward and began writing songs that would become part of the follow-up to &quot;So Long, Astoria&quot; titled &quot;Welcome the Night&quot;. They held some informal practices with some friends from New York, who played in the band Park Ranger. These sessions led to three members of Park Ranger joining the Ataris: Sean Hansen on bass, Shane Chickeles on drums, and Paul Carabello on third guitar. To round out the lineup they added longtime friends Bob Hoag, formerly of Pollen and the Go Reflex (which was managed by Roe), on piano and keyboards, and Angus Cooke on cello. Cooke played cello on past Ataris records, and helped with production as well. Starting in 2005, the band began recording &quot;Welcome the Night&quot; at Seedy Underbelly in California, with producer Nick Launay. Writing and recording eventually took the better part of two years and was extended to multiple studios. The album was routinely delayed by Columbia.

On June 10, 2006, the band announced that it had left Columbia Records due to the label&#x27;s internal disintegration. In November 2006, the Ataris started their own imprint, Isola Recordings, through Sanctuary Records and RED Distribution, and simultaneously announced the official release date of their fifth album &quot;Welcome the Night&quot; as February 20, 2007. &quot;Welcome the Night&quot; debuted at number 85 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts with over 12,000 copies sold. Following the album&#x27;s release, the band embarked on a tour of the United States and Europe.

===&quot;New upcoming album&quot; (2008–present)===

In June 2008, the band began demoing at The Gallows Recording Studio in Muncie, Indiana in preparation for recording in late summer, with the aim of releasing a new album in 2009. In November, the band posted a clip of a demo online. The following month, the band entered the studio to record their next album. On December 29, it was mentioned that drums had been completed and that guitars were next. In January 2009, the band went on a tour of the UK. On April 12, a demo titled &quot;All Souls&#x27; Day&quot; was posted on the group&#x27;s Myspace. In addition, it was mentioned that their next album would be released in the summer. Between April and June 2009, the band toured the US, with shows in South Africa in the middle of this trek. After this, they appeared on the 2009 Warped Tour. The finished version of &quot;All Souls&#x27; Day&quot; was posted online in June 2009. On August 17, 2009, the band announced they had nearly finished recording their next album, tentatively titled &quot;Graveyard of the Atlantic&quot;. They went on a short Midwest tour in November 2009.

Between February and April 2010, the Ataris went on a cross-country US tour with Don&#x27;t Panic, and then performed at the Windy City Sound Clash festival. Following this, they went on another US tour between July and September 2010. That same year, a two track EP, &quot;All Souls&#x27; Day &amp; the Graveyard of the Atlantic&quot; containing just its title tracks was released under the Paper + Plastick label. In 2012, the band released a four track EP entitled &quot;The Graveyard of the Atlantic&quot;. From 2013, the Ataris began a North American tour with Kris Roe as singer and the former members John Collura, Mike Davenport and Chris Knapp to celebrate the 10 years of their most successful album &quot;So Long, Astoria&quot;.

In 2016, the band released a six-song EP entitled &quot;October in This Railroad Earth&quot; through Bandcamp. In 2017, Warped Tour announced that the Ataris was going to play on the 2017 tour. On June 18, 2017, the band released a compilation titled &quot;Silver Turns to Rust&quot; on Bandcamp. This compilation featured four previously released tracks from &quot;The Graveyard of the Atlantic&quot; and six from the previously released EP &quot;October in this Railroad Earth&quot;.

In 2024, Kris Roe posted via the Ataris&#x27; Facebook page that the band is currently in the studio with producer and former drummer Bob Hoag to record the next album. Roe also confirmed that the band will most likely not use The Graveyard of the Atlantic album title. Roe also confirmed Bob Hoag will be recording drums on the upcoming record. On February 9, 2025, Roe confirmed bass and drums for the new record are officially recorded and is currently in the process of recording remaining guitars and vocals. On February 14, 2025, Roe confirmed Summer of &#x27;69 by Bryan Adams as one of the songs confirmed for the new album.

==Musical style==
The Ataris has been described as pop-punk, emo, and punk rock. The band&#x27;s influences include Descendents, Jawbreaker, All, Fugazi, Avail, the Ramones, and the Replacements.

==Controversy==
While performing in Asbury Park, New Jersey on October 7, 2012, frontman Kris Roe, acted hostile towards then-drummer Rob Felicetti on stage. Kris said he had &quot;had enough&quot; and &quot;could not take it anymore&quot; as the drummer was performing &quot;off-time&quot; throughout their set (a claim refuted by various professional drummers). A fan had captured the incident on camera, and was subsequently uploaded to social media. Roe claimed in a follow-up video regarding the incident that Felicetti was drunk during the performance, a claim Felicetti later denied. This incident led Felicetti to exit the band.

<doc id="157774" wikidata="Q179918" url="?curid=157774" title="Permafrost">
<text>Permafrost () is soil or underwater sediment which continuously remains below for two years or more: the oldest permafrost has been continuously frozen for around 700,000 years. Whilst the shallowest permafrost has a vertical extent of below a meter (3 ft), the deepest is greater than . Similarly, the area of individual permafrost zones may be limited to narrow mountain summits or extend across vast Arctic regions. The ground beneath glaciers and ice sheets is not usually defined as permafrost, so on land, permafrost is generally located beneath a so-called active layer of soil which freezes and thaws depending on the season.

Around 15% of the Northern Hemisphere or 11% of the global surface is underlain by permafrost, covering a total area of around . This includes large areas of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Siberia. It is also located in high mountain regions, with the Tibetan Plateau being a prominent example. Only a minority of permafrost exists in the Southern Hemisphere, where it is consigned to mountain slopes like in the Andes of Patagonia, the Southern Alps of New Zealand, or the highest mountains of Antarctica.

Permafrost contains large amounts of dead biomass that has accumulated throughout millennia without having had the chance to fully decompose and release its carbon, making tundra soil a carbon sink. As global warming heats the ecosystem, frozen soil thaws and becomes warm enough for decomposition to start anew, accelerating the permafrost carbon cycle. Depending on conditions at the time of thaw, decomposition can release either carbon dioxide or methane, and these greenhouse gas emissions act as a climate change feedback. The emissions from thawing permafrost will have a sufficient impact on the climate to impact global carbon budgets. It is difficult to accurately predict how much greenhouse gases the permafrost releases because of the different thaw processes are still uncertain. There is widespread agreement that the emissions will be smaller than human-caused emissions and not large enough to result in runaway warming. Instead, the annual permafrost emissions are likely comparable with global emissions from deforestation, or to annual emissions of large countries such as Russia, the United States or China.

Apart from its climate impact, permafrost thaw brings more risks. Formerly frozen ground often contains enough ice that when it thaws, hydraulic saturation is suddenly exceeded, so the ground shifts substantially and may even collapse outright. Many buildings and other infrastructure were built on permafrost when it was frozen and stable, and so are vulnerable to collapse if it thaws. Estimates suggest nearly 70% of such infrastructure is at risk by 2050, and that the associated costs could rise to tens of billions of dollars in the second half of the century. Furthermore, between 13,000 and 20,000 sites contaminated with toxic waste are present in the permafrost, as well as natural mercury deposits, which are all liable to leak and pollute the environment as the warming progresses. Lastly, concerns have been raised about the potential for pathogenic microorganisms surviving the thaw and contributing to future pandemics. However, this is considered unlikely, and a scientific review on the subject describes the risks as &quot;generally low&quot;.
== Classification and extent ==

Permafrost is soil, rock or sediment that is frozen for more than two consecutive years. In practice, this means that permafrost occurs at a mean annual temperature of or below. In the coldest regions, the depth of continuous permafrost can exceed . It typically exists beneath the so-called active layer, which freezes and thaws annually, and so can support plant growth, as the roots can only take hold in the soil that&#x27;s thawed. Active layer thickness is measured during its maximum extent at the end of summer: as of 2018, the average thickness in the Northern Hemisphere is ~, but there are significant regional differences. Northeastern Siberia, Alaska and Greenland have the most solid permafrost with the lowest extent of active layer (less than on average, and sometimes only ), while southern Norway and the Mongolian Plateau are the only areas where the average active layer is deeper than , with the record of . The border between active layer and permafrost itself is sometimes called permafrost table.

Around 15% of Northern Hemisphere land that is not completely covered by ice is directly underlain by permafrost; 22% is defined as part of a permafrost zone or region. This is because only slightly more than half of this area is defined as a continuous permafrost zone, where 90%–100% of the land is underlain by permafrost. Around 20% is instead defined as discontinuous permafrost, where the coverage is between 50% and 90%. Finally, the remaining &lt;30% of permafrost regions consists of areas with 10%–50% coverage, which are defined as sporadic permafrost zones, and some areas that have isolated patches of permafrost covering 10% or less of their area. Most of this area is found in Siberia, northern Canada, Alaska and Greenland. Beneath the active layer annual temperature swings of permafrost become smaller with depth. The greatest depth of permafrost occurs right before the point where geothermal heat maintains a temperature above freezing. Above that bottom limit there may be permafrost with a consistent annual temperature—&quot;isothermal permafrost&quot;.

=== Continuity of coverage ===
Permafrost typically forms in any climate where the mean annual air temperature is lower than the freezing point of water. Exceptions are found in humid boreal forests, such as in Northern Scandinavia and the North-Eastern part of European Russia west of the Urals, where snow acts as an insulating blanket. Glaciated areas may also be exceptions. Since all glaciers are warmed at their base by geothermal heat, temperate glaciers, which are near the pressure melting point throughout, may have liquid water at the interface with the ground and are therefore free of underlying permafrost. &quot;Fossil&quot; cold anomalies in the geothermal gradient in areas where deep permafrost developed during the Pleistocene persist down to several hundred metres. This is evident from temperature measurements in boreholes in North America and Europe.

==== Discontinuous permafrost ====

The below-ground temperature varies less from season to season than the air temperature, with mean annual temperatures tending to increase with depth due to the geothermal crustal gradient. Thus, if the mean annual air temperature is only slightly below , permafrost will form only in spots that are sheltered (usually with a northern or southern aspect, in the north and south hemispheres respectively) creating discontinuous permafrost. Usually, permafrost will remain discontinuous in a climate where the mean annual soil surface temperature is between . In the moist-wintered areas mentioned before, there may not even be discontinuous permafrost down to . Discontinuous permafrost is often further divided into extensive discontinuous permafrost, where permafrost covers between 50 and 90 percent of the landscape and is usually found in areas with mean annual temperatures between , and sporadic permafrost, where permafrost cover is less than 50 percent of the landscape and typically occurs at mean annual temperatures between .

In soil science, the sporadic permafrost zone is abbreviated SPZ and the extensive discontinuous permafrost zone DPZ. Exceptions occur in un-glaciated Siberia and Alaska where the present depth of permafrost is a relic of climatic conditions during glacial ages where winters were up to colder than those of today.

==== Continuous permafrost ====

At mean annual soil surface temperatures below the influence of aspect can never be sufficient to thaw permafrost and a zone of continuous permafrost (abbreviated to CPZ) forms. A line of continuous permafrost in the Northern Hemisphere represents the most southern border where land is covered by continuous permafrost or glacial ice. The line of continuous permafrost varies around the world northward or southward due to regional climatic changes. In the southern hemisphere, most of the equivalent line would fall within the Southern Ocean if there were land there. Most of the Antarctic continent is overlain by glaciers, under which much of the terrain is subject to basal melting. The exposed land of Antarctica is substantially underlain with permafrost, some of which is subject to warming and thawing along the coastline.

=== Alpine permafrost ===
A range of elevations in both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere are cold enough to support perennially frozen ground: some of the best-known examples include the Canadian Rockies, the European Alps, Himalaya and the Tien Shan. In general, it has been found that extensive alpine permafrost requires mean annual air temperature of , though this can vary depending on local topography, and some mountain areas are known to support permafrost at . It is also possible for subsurface alpine permafrost to be covered by warmer, vegetation-supporting soil.

Alpine permafrost is particularly difficult to study, and systematic research efforts did not begin until the 1970s. Consequently, there remain uncertainties about its geography As recently as 2009, permafrost had been discovered in a new area – Africa&#x27;s highest peak, Mount Kilimanjaro ( above sea level and approximately 3° south of the equator). In 2014, a collection of regional estimates of alpine permafrost extent had established a global extent of . Yet, by 2014, alpine permafrost in the Andes has not been fully mapped, although its extent has been modeled to assess the amount of water bound up in these areas.

=== Subsea permafrost ===

Subsea permafrost occurs beneath the seabed and exists in the continental shelves of the polar regions. These areas formed during the last Ice Age, when a larger portion of Earth&#x27;s water was bound up in ice sheets on land and when sea levels were low. As the ice sheets melted to again become seawater during the Holocene glacial retreat, coastal permafrost became submerged shelves under relatively warm and salty boundary conditions, compared to surface permafrost. Since then, these conditions led to the gradual and ongoing decline of subsea permafrost extent. Nevertheless, its presence remains an important consideration for the &quot;design, construction, and operation of coastal facilities, structures founded on the seabed, artificial islands, sub-sea pipelines, and wells drilled for exploration and production&quot;. Subsea permafrost can also overlay deposits of methane clathrate, which were once speculated to be a major climate tipping point in what was known as a clathrate gun hypothesis, but are now no longer believed to play any role in projected climate change.

=== Past extent of permafrost ===
At the Last Glacial Maximum, continuous permafrost covered a much greater area than it does today, covering all of ice-free Europe south to about Szeged (southeastern Hungary) and the Sea of Azov (then dry land) and East Asia south to present-day Changchun and Abashiri. In North America, only an extremely narrow belt of permafrost existed south of the ice sheet at about the latitude of New Jersey through southern Iowa and northern Missouri, but permafrost was more extensive in the drier western regions where it extended to the southern border of Idaho and Oregon. In the Southern Hemisphere, there is some evidence for former permafrost from this period in central Otago and Argentine Patagonia, but was probably discontinuous, and is related to the tundra. Alpine permafrost also occurred in the Drakensberg during glacial maxima above about .

== Manifestations ==
=== Base depth ===
Permafrost extends to a base depth where geothermal heat from the Earth and the mean annual temperature at the surface achieve an equilibrium temperature of . This base depth of permafrost can vary wildly – it is less than a meter (3 ft) in the areas where it is shallowest, yet reaches in the northern Lena and Yana River basins in Siberia. Calculations indicate that the formation time of permafrost greatly slows past the first several metres. For instance, over half a million years was required to form the deep permafrost underlying Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, a time period extending over several glacial and interglacial cycles of the Pleistocene.

Base depth is affected by the underlying geology, and particularly by thermal conductivity, which is lower for permafrost in soil than in bedrock. Lower conductivity leaves permafrost less affected by the geothermal gradient, which is the rate of increasing temperature with respect to increasing depth in the Earth&#x27;s interior. It occurs as the Earth&#x27;s internal thermal energy is generated by radioactive decay of unstable isotopes and flows to the surface by conduction at a rate of ~47 terawatts (TW). Away from tectonic plate boundaries, this is equivalent to an average heat flow of 25–30 °C/km (124–139 °F/mi) near the surface.

=== Massive ground ice ===
When the ice content of a permafrost exceeds 250 percent (ice to dry soil by mass) it is classified as massive ice. Massive ice bodies can range in composition, in every conceivable gradation from icy mud to pure ice. Massive icy beds have a minimum thickness of at least 2 m and a short diameter of at least 10 m. First recorded North American observations of this phenomenon were by European scientists at Canning River (Alaska) in 1919. Russian literature provides an earlier date of 1735 and 1739 during the Great North Expedition by P. Lassinius and Khariton Laptev, respectively. Russian investigators including I.A. Lopatin, B. Khegbomov, S. Taber and G. Beskow had also formulated the original theories for ice inclusion in freezing soils.

While there are four categories of ice in permafrost – pore ice, ice wedges (also known as vein ice), buried surface ice and intrasedimental (sometimes also called constitutional) ice – only the last two tend to be large enough to qualify as massive ground ice. These two types usually occur separately, but may be found together, like on the coast of Tuktoyaktuk in western Arctic Canada, where the remains of Laurentide Ice Sheet are located.

Buried surface ice may derive from snow, frozen lake or sea ice, aufeis (stranded river ice) and even buried glacial ice from the former Pleistocene ice sheets. The latter hold enormous value for paleoglaciological research, yet even as of 2022, the total extent and volume of such buried ancient ice is unknown. Notable sites with known ancient ice deposits include Yenisei River valley in Siberia, Russia as well as Banks and Bylot Island in Canada&#x27;s Nunavut and Northwest Territories. Some of the buried ice sheet remnants are known to host thermokarst lakes.

Intrasedimental or constitutional ice has been widely observed and studied across Canada. It forms when subterranean waters freeze in place, and is subdivided into intrusive, injection and segregational ice. The latter is the dominant type, formed after crystallizational differentiation in wet sediments, which occurs when water migrates to the freezing front under the influence of van der Waals forces. This is a slow process, which primarily occurs in silts with salinity less than 20% of seawater: silt sediments with higher salinity and clay sediments instead have water movement prior to ice formation dominated by rheological processes. Consequently, it takes between 1 and 1000 years to form intrasedimental ice in the top 2.5 meters of clay sediments, yet it takes between 10 and 10,000 years for peat sediments and between 1,000 and 1,000,000 years for silt sediments.

=== Landforms ===

Permafrost processes such as thermal contraction generating cracks which eventually become ice wedges and solifluction – gradual movement of soil down the slope as it repeatedly freezes and thaws – often lead to the formation of ground polygons, rings, steps and other forms of patterned ground found in arctic, periglacial and alpine areas. In ice-rich permafrost areas, melting of ground ice initiates thermokarst landforms such as thermokarst lakes, thaw slumps, thermal-erosion gullies, and active layer detachments. Notably, unusually deep permafrost in Arctic moorlands and bogs often attracts meltwater in warmer seasons, which pools and freezes to form ice lenses, and the surrounding ground begins to jut outward at a slope. This can eventually result in the formation of large-scale land forms around this core of permafrost, such as palsas – long (), wide () yet shallow (&lt; tall) peat mounds – and the even larger pingos, which can be high and in diameter.

=== Ecology ===

Only plants with shallow roots can survive in the presence of permafrost. Black spruce tolerates limited rooting zones, and dominates flora where permafrost is extensive. Likewise, animal species which live in dens and burrows have their habitat constrained by the permafrost, and these constraints also have a secondary impact on interactions between species within the ecosystem.

While permafrost soil is frozen, it is not completely inhospitable to microorganisms, though their numbers can vary widely, typically from 1 to 1000 million per gram of soil.
The permafrost carbon cycle (Arctic Carbon Cycle) deals with the transfer of carbon from permafrost soils to terrestrial vegetation and microbes, to the atmosphere, back to vegetation, and finally back to permafrost soils through burial and sedimentation due to cryogenic processes. Some of this carbon is transferred to the ocean and other portions of the globe through the global carbon cycle. The cycle includes the exchange of carbon dioxide and methane between terrestrial components and the atmosphere, as well as the transfer of carbon between land and water as methane, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon, particulate inorganic carbon and particulate organic carbon.

Most of the bacteria and fungi found in permafrost cannot be cultured in the laboratory, but the identity of the microorganisms can be revealed by DNA-based techniques. For instance, analysis of 16S rRNA genes from late Pleistocene permafrost samples in eastern Siberia&#x27;s Kolyma Lowland revealed eight phylotypes, which belonged to the phyla Actinomycetota and Pseudomonadota. &quot;Muot-da-Barba-Peider&quot;, an alpine permafrost site in eastern Switzerland, was found to host a diverse microbial community in 2016. Prominent bacteria groups included phylum Acidobacteriota, Actinomycetota, AD3, Bacteroidota, Chloroflexota, Gemmatimonadota, OD1, Nitrospirota, Planctomycetota, Pseudomonadota, and Verrucomicrobiota, in addition to eukaryotic fungi like Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Zygomycota. In the presently living species, scientists observed a variety of adaptations for sub-zero conditions, including reduced and anaerobic metabolic processes.

=== Construction on permafrost ===

There are only two large cities in the world built in areas of continuous permafrost (where the frozen soil forms an unbroken, below-zero sheet) and both are in Russia – Norilsk in Krasnoyarsk Krai and Yakutsk in the Sakha Republic. Building on permafrost is difficult because the heat of the building (or pipeline) can spread to the soil, thawing it. As ice content turns to water, the ground&#x27;s ability to provide structural support is weakened, until the building is destabilized. For instance, during the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway, a steam engine factory complex built in 1901 began to crumble within a month of operations for these reasons. Additionally, there is no groundwater available in an area underlain with permafrost. Any substantial settlement or installation needs to make some alternative arrangement to obtain water.

A common solution is placing foundations on wood piles, a technique pioneered by Soviet engineer Mikhail Kim in Norilsk. However, warming-induced change of friction on the piles can still cause movement through creep, even as the soil remains frozen. The Melnikov Permafrost Institute in Yakutsk found that pile foundations should extend down to to avoid the risk of buildings sinking. At this depth the temperature does not change with the seasons, remaining at about .

Two other approaches are building on an extensive gravel pad (usually thick); or using anhydrous ammonia heat pipes. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System uses heat pipes built into vertical supports to prevent the pipeline from sinking and the Qingzang railway in Tibet employs a variety of methods to keep the ground cool, both in areas with frost-susceptible soil. Permafrost may necessitate special enclosures for buried utilities, called &quot;utilidors&quot;.


== Impacts of climate change ==

=== Increasing active layer thickness ===
Globally, permafrost warmed by about between 2007 and 2016, with stronger warming observed in the continuous permafrost zone relative to the discontinuous zone. Observed warming was up to in parts of Northern Alaska (early 1980s to mid-2000s) and up to in parts of the Russian European North (1970–2020). This warming inevitably causes permafrost to thaw: active layer thickness has increased in the European and Russian Arctic across the 21st century and at high elevation areas in Europe and Asia since the 1990s.

Between 2000 and 2018, the average active layer thickness had increased from ~ to ~, at an average annual rate of ~.

In Yukon, the zone of continuous permafrost might have moved poleward since 1899, but accurate records only go back 30 years. The extent of subsea permafrost is decreasing as well; as of 2019, ~97% of permafrost under Arctic ice shelves is becoming warmer and thinner.

Based on high agreement across model projections, fundamental process understanding, and paleoclimate evidence, it is virtually certain that permafrost extent and volume will continue to shrink as the global climate warms, with the extent of the losses determined by the magnitude of warming.

Permafrost thaw is associated with a wide range of issues, and International Permafrost Association (IPA) exists to help address them. It convenes International Permafrost Conferences and maintains Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost, which undertakes special projects such as preparing databases, maps, bibliographies, and glossaries, and coordinates international field programmes and networks.

=== Climate change feedback ===

As recent warming deepens the active layer subject to permafrost thaw, this exposes formerly stored carbon to biogenic processes which facilitate its entrance into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide and methane. Because carbon emissions from permafrost thaw contribute to the same warming which facilitates the thaw, it is a well-known example of a positive climate change feedback. Permafrost thaw is sometimes included as one of the major tipping points in the climate system due to the exhibition of local thresholds and its effective irreversibility. However, while there are self-perpetuating processes that apply on the local or regional scale, it is debated as to whether it meets the strict definition of a global tipping point as in aggregate permafrost thaw is gradual with warming.

In the northern circumpolar region, permafrost contains organic matter equivalent to 1400–1650 billion tons of pure carbon, which was built up over thousands of years. This amount equals almost half of all organic material in all soils, and it is about twice the carbon content of the atmosphere, or around four times larger than the human emissions of carbon between the start of the Industrial Revolution and 2011. Further, most of this carbon (~1,035 billion tons) is stored in what is defined as the near-surface permafrost, no deeper than below the surface. However, only a fraction of this stored carbon is expected to enter the atmosphere. In general, the volume of permafrost in the upper 3 m of ground is expected to decrease by about 25% per of global warming, yet even under the RCP8.5 scenario associated with over of global warming by the end of the 21st century, about 5% to 15% of permafrost carbon is expected to be lost &quot;over decades and centuries&quot;.

The exact amount of carbon that will be released due to warming in a given permafrost area depends on depth of thaw, carbon content within the thawed soil, physical changes to the environment, and microbial and vegetation activity in the soil. Notably, estimates of carbon release alone do not fully represent the impact of permafrost thaw on climate change. This is because carbon can be released through either aerobic or anaerobic respiration, which results in carbon dioxide (CO2) or methane (CH4) emissions, respectively. While methane lasts less than 12 years in the atmosphere, its global warming potential is around 80 times larger than that of CO2 over a 20-year period and about 28 times larger over a 100-year period. While only a small fraction of permafrost carbon will enter the atmosphere as methane, those emissions will cause 40–70% of the total warming caused by permafrost thaw during the 21st century. Much of the uncertainty about the eventual extent of permafrost methane emissions is caused by the difficulty of accounting for the recently discovered abrupt thaw processes, which often increase the fraction of methane emitted over carbon dioxide in comparison to the usual gradual thaw processes.

Another factor which complicates projections of permafrost carbon emissions is the ongoing &quot;greening&quot; of the Arctic. As climate change warms the air and the soil, the region becomes more hospitable to plants, including larger shrubs and trees which could not survive there before. Thus, the Arctic is losing more and more of its tundra biomes, yet it gains more plants, which proceed to absorb more carbon. Some of the emissions caused by permafrost thaw will be offset by this increased plant growth, but the exact proportion is uncertain. It is considered very unlikely that this greening could offset all of the emissions from permafrost thaw during the 21st century, and even less likely that it could continue to keep pace with those emissions after the 21st century. Further, climate change also increases the risk of wildfires in the Arctic, which can substantially accelerate emissions of permafrost carbon.

==== Impact on global temperatures ====
Altogether, it is expected that cumulative greenhouse gas emissions from permafrost thaw will be smaller than the cumulative anthropogenic emissions, yet still substantial on a global scale, with some experts comparing them to emissions caused by deforestation. The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report estimates that carbon dioxide and methane released from permafrost could amount to the equivalent of 14–175 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide per of warming. For comparison, by 2019, annual anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide alone stood around 40 billion tonnes. A major review published in the year 2022 concluded that if the goal of preventing of warming was realized, then the average annual permafrost emissions throughout the 21st century would be equivalent to the year 2019 annual emissions of Russia. Under RCP4.5, a scenario considered close to the current trajectory and where the warming stays slightly below , annual permafrost emissions would be comparable to year 2019 emissions of Western Europe or the United States, while under the scenario of high global warming and worst-case permafrost feedback response, they would approach year 2019 emissions of China.

Fewer studies have attempted to describe the impact directly in terms of warming. A 2018 paper estimated that if global warming was limited to , gradual permafrost thaw would add around to global temperatures by 2100, while a 2022 review concluded that every of global warming would cause and from abrupt thaw by the year 2100 and 2300. Around of global warming, abrupt (around 50 years) and widespread collapse of permafrost areas could occur, resulting in an additional warming of .

=== Thaw-induced ground instability ===

As the water drains or evaporates, soil structure weakens and sometimes becomes viscous until it regains strength with decreasing moisture content. One visible sign of permafrost degradation is the random displacement of trees from their vertical orientation in permafrost areas. Global warming has been increasing permafrost slope disturbances and sediment supplies to fluvial systems, resulting in exceptional increases in river sediment. On the other hands, disturbance of formerly hard soil increases drainage of water reservoirs in northern wetlands. This can dry them out and compromise the survival of plants and animals used to the wetland ecosystem.

In high mountains, much of the structural stability can be attributed to glaciers and permafrost. As climate warms, permafrost thaws, decreasing slope stability and increasing stress through buildup of pore-water pressure, which may ultimately lead to slope failure and rockfalls. Over the past century, an increasing number of alpine rock slope failure events in mountain ranges around the world have been recorded, and some have been attributed to permafrost thaw induced by climate change. The 1987 Val Pola landslide that killed 22 people in the Italian Alps is considered one such example. In 2002, massive rock and ice falls (up to 11.8 million m3), earthquakes (up to 3.9 Richter), floods (up to 7.8 million m3 water), and rapid rock-ice flow to long distances (up to 7.5 km at 60 m/s) were attributed to slope instability in high mountain permafrost.

Permafrost thaw can also result in the formation of frozen debris lobes (FDLs), which are defined as &quot;slow-moving landslides composed of soil, rocks, trees, and ice&quot;. This is a notable issue in the Alaska&#x27;s southern Brooks Range, where some FDLs measured over in width, in height, and in length by 2012. As of December 2021, there were 43 frozen debris lobes identified in the southern Brooks Range, where they could potentially threaten both the Trans Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) corridor and the Dalton Highway, which is the main transport link between the Interior Alaska and the Alaska North Slope.

==== Infrastructure ====

As of 2021, there are 1162 settlements located directly atop the Arctic permafrost, which host an estimated 5 million people. By 2050, permafrost layer below 42% of these settlements is expected to thaw, affecting all their inhabitants (currently 3.3 million people). Consequently, a wide range of infrastructure in permafrost areas is threatened by the thaw. By 2050, it&#x27;s estimated that nearly 70% of global infrastructure located in the permafrost areas would be at high risk of permafrost thaw, including 30–50% of &quot;critical&quot; infrastructure. The associated costs could reach tens of billions of dollars by the second half of the century. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreement is projected to stabilize the risk after mid-century; otherwise, it&#x27;ll continue to worsen.

In Alaska alone, damages to infrastructure by the end of the century would amount to $4.6 billion (at 2015 dollar value) if RCP8.5, the high-emission climate change scenario, were realized. Over half stems from the damage to buildings ($2.8 billion), but there&#x27;s also damage to roads ($700 million), railroads ($620 million), airports ($360 million) and pipelines ($170 million). Similar estimates were done for RCP4.5, a less intense scenario which leads to around by 2100, a level of warming similar to the current projections. In that case, total damages from permafrost thaw are reduced to $3 billion, while damages to roads and railroads are lessened by approximately two-thirds (from $700 and $620 million to $190 and $220 million) and damages to pipelines are reduced more than ten-fold, from $170 million to $16 million. Unlike the other costs stemming from climate change in Alaska, such as damages from increased precipitation and flooding, climate change adaptation is not a viable way to reduce damages from permafrost thaw, as it would cost more than the damage incurred under either scenario.

In Canada, Northwest Territories have a population of only 45,000 people in 33 communities, yet permafrost thaw is expected to cost them $1.3 billion over 75 years, or around $51 million a year. In 2006, the cost of adapting Inuvialuit homes to permafrost thaw was estimated at $208/m2 if they were built at pile foundations, and $1,000/m2 if they didn&#x27;t. At the time, the average area of a residential building in the territory was around 100 m2. Thaw-induced damage is also unlikely to be covered by home insurance, and to address this reality, territorial government currently funds Contributing Assistance for Repairs and Enhancements (CARE) and Securing Assistance for Emergencies (SAFE) programs, which provide long- and short-term forgivable loans to help homeowners adapt. It is possible that in the future, mandatory relocation would instead take place as the cheaper option. However, it would effectively tear the local Inuit away from their ancestral homelands. Right now, their average personal income is only half that of the median NWT resident, meaning that adaptation costs are already disproportionate for them.

By 2022, up to 80% of buildings in some Northern Russia cities had already experienced damage. By 2050, the damage to residential infrastructure may reach $15 billion, while total public infrastructure damages could amount to 132 billion. This includes oil and gas extraction facilities, of which 45% are believed to be at risk.

Outside of the Arctic, Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (sometimes known as &quot;the Third Pole&quot;), also has an extensive permafrost area. It is warming at twice the global average rate, and 40% of it is already considered &quot;warm&quot; permafrost, making it particularly unstable. Qinghai–Tibet Plateau has a population of over 10 million people – double the population of permafrost regions in the Arctic – and over 1 million m2 of buildings are located in its permafrost area, as well as 2,631 km of power lines, and 580 km of railways. There are also 9,389 km of roads, and around 30% are already sustaining damage from permafrost thaw. Estimates suggest that under the scenario most similar to today, SSP2-4.5, around 60% of the current infrastructure would be at high risk by 2090 and simply maintaining it would cost $6.31 billion, with adaptation reducing these costs by 20.9% at most. Holding the global warming to would reduce these costs to $5.65 billion, and fulfilling the optimistic Paris Agreement target of would save a further $1.32 billion. In particular, fewer than 20% of railways would be at high risk by 2100 under , yet this increases to 60% at , while under SSP5-8.5, this level of risk is met by mid-century.

=== Release of toxic pollutants ===

For much of the 20th century, it was believed that permafrost would &quot;indefinitely&quot; preserve anything buried there, and this made deep permafrost areas popular locations for hazardous waste disposal. In places like Canada&#x27;s Prudhoe Bay oil field, procedures were developed documenting the &quot;appropriate&quot; way to inject waste beneath the permafrost. This means that as of 2023, there are ~4500 industrial facilities in the Arctic permafrost areas which either actively process or store hazardous chemicals. Additionally, there are between 13,000 and 20,000 sites which have been heavily contaminated, 70% of them in Russia, and their pollution is currently trapped in the permafrost.

About a fifth of both the industrial and the polluted sites (1000 and 2200–4800) are expected to start thawing in the future even if the warming does not increase from its 2020 levels. Only about 3% more sites would start thawing between now and 2050 under the climate change scenario consistent with the Paris Agreement goals, RCP2.6, but by 2100, about 1100 more industrial facilities and 3500 to 5200 contaminated sites are expected to start thawing even then. Under the very high emission scenario RCP8.5, 46% of industrial and contaminated sites would start thawing by 2050, and virtually all of them would be affected by the thaw by 2100.

Organochlorines and other persistent organic pollutants are of a particular concern, due to their potential to repeatedly reach local communities after their re-release through biomagnification in fish. At worst, future generations born in the Arctic would enter life with weakened immune systems due to pollutants accumulating across generations.

A notable example of pollution risks associated with permafrost was the 2020 Norilsk oil spill, caused by the collapse of diesel fuel storage tank at Norilsk-Taimyr Energy&#x27;s thermal power plant No. 3. It spilled 6,000 tonnes of fuel into the land and 15,000 into the water, polluting Ambarnaya, Daldykan and many smaller rivers on Taimyr Peninsula, even reaching lake Pyasino, which is a crucial water source in the area. State of emergency at the federal level was declared. The event has been described as the second-largest oil spill in modern Russian history.

Another issue associated with permafrost thaw is the release of natural mercury deposits. An estimated 800,000 tons of mercury are frozen in the permafrost soil. According to observations, around 70% of it is simply taken up by vegetation after the thaw. However, if the warming continues under RCP8.5, then permafrost emissions of mercury into the atmosphere would match the current global emissions from all human activities by 2200. Mercury-rich soils also pose a much greater threat to humans and the environment if they thaw near rivers. Under RCP8.5, enough mercury will enter the Yukon River basin by 2050 to make its fish unsafe to eat under the EPA guidelines. By 2100, mercury concentrations in the river will double. Contrastingly, even if mitigation is limited to RCP4.5 scenario, mercury levels will increase by about 14% by 2100, and will not breach the EPA guidelines even by 2300.

=== Revival of ancient organisms ===
==== Microorganisms ====

Bacteria are known for being able to remain dormant to survive adverse conditions, and viruses are not metabolically active outside of host cells in the first place. This has motivated concerns that permafrost thaw could free previously unknown microorganisms, which may be capable of infecting either humans or important livestock and crops, potentially resulting in damaging epidemics or pandemics. Further, some scientists argue that horizontal gene transfer could occur between the older, formerly frozen bacteria, and modern ones, and one outcome could be the introduction of novel antibiotic resistance genes into the genome of current pathogens, exacerbating what is already expected to become a difficult issue in the future.

At the same time, notable pathogens like influenza and smallpox appear unable to survive being thawed, and other scientists argue that the risk of ancient microorganisms being both able to survive the thaw and to threaten humans is not scientifically plausible. Likewise, some research suggests that antimicrobial resistance capabilities of ancient bacteria would be comparable to, or even inferior to modern ones.

==== Plants ====
In 2012, Russian researchers proved that permafrost could serve as a natural repository for ancient life forms by reviving a sample of &quot;Silene stenophylla&quot; from 30,000-year-old tissue found in an Ice Age squirrel burrow in the Siberian permafrost. This is the oldest plant tissue ever revived. The resultant plant was fertile, producing white flowers and viable seeds. The study demonstrated that living tissue can survive ice preservation for tens of thousands of years.

== History of scientific research ==
Between the middle of the 19th century and the middle of the 20th century, most of the literature on basic permafrost science and the engineering aspects of permafrost was written in Russian. One of the earliest written reports describing the existence of permafrost dates to 1684, when well excavation efforts in Yakutsk were stumped by its presence. A significant role in the initial permafrost research was played by Alexander von Middendorff (1815–1894) and Karl Ernst von Baer, a Baltic German scientist at the University of Königsberg, and a member of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Baer began publishing works on permafrost in 1838 and is often considered the &quot;founder of scientific permafrost research.&quot; Baer laid the foundation for modern permafrost terminology by compiling and analyzing all available data on ground ice and permafrost.
Baer is also known to have composed the world&#x27;s first permafrost textbook in 1843, (&quot;Materials for the study of the perennial ground-ice in Siberia&quot;), written in his native German. However, it was not printed then, and a Russian translation was not ready until 1942. The original German textbook was believed to be lost until the typescript from 1843 was discovered in the library archives of the University of Giessen. The 234-page text was available online, with additional maps, preface and comments. Notably, Baer&#x27;s southern limit of permafrost in Eurasia drawn in 1843 corresponds well with the actual southern limit verified by modern research.

Beginning in 1942, Siemon William Muller delved into the relevant Russian literature held by the Library of Congress and the U.S. Geological Survey Library so that he was able to furnish the government an engineering field guide and a technical report about permafrost by 1943. That report coined the English term as a contraction of permanently frozen ground, in what was considered a direct translation of the Russian term (). In 1953, this translation was criticized by another USGS researcher Inna Poiré, as she believed the term had created unrealistic expectations about its stability: more recently, some researchers have argued that &quot;perpetually refreezing&quot; would be a more suitable translation. The report itself was classified (as U.S. Army. Office of the Chief of Engineers, &quot;Strategic Engineering Study&quot;, no. 62, 1943), until a revised version was released in 1947, which is regarded as the first North American treatise on the subject.

Between 11 and 15 November 1963, the First International Conference on Permafrost took place on the grounds of Purdue University in the American town of West Lafayette, Indiana. It involved 285 participants (including &quot;engineers, manufacturers and builders&quot; who attended alongside the researchers) from a range of countries (Argentina, Austria, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Japan, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, the US and the USSR). This marked the beginning of modern scientific collaboration on the subject. Conferences continue to take place every five years. During the Fourth conference in 1983, a special meeting between the &quot;Big Four&quot; participant countries (US, USSR, China, and Canada) officially created the International Permafrost Association.

In recent decades, permafrost research has attracted more attention than ever due to its role in climate change. Consequently, there has been a massive acceleration in published scientific literature. Around 1990, almost no papers were released containing the words &quot;permafrost&quot; and &quot;carbon&quot;: by 2020, around 400 such papers were published every year.

<doc id="157779" wikidata="Q586979" url="?curid=157779" title="Meet the Residents">
<text>Meet the Residents is the debut studio album by the American art rock group the Residents, released on April 1, 1974, through Ralph Records. Most of the album was recorded throughout 1973 during breaks from production on &quot;Vileness Fats&quot;, the group&#x27;s film project and main focus at the time. The album is said to adhere to N. Senada&#x27;s &quot;Theory of Phonetic Organization,&quot; in which music composition should be based on individual sounds rather than traditional musical notes.

==Music==
The music on &quot;Meet the Residents&quot; is a mixture of several Western genres, including blues, jazz, opera and classical music, performed in an amateurish manner, deliberately or otherwise. The album features much of what came to be the Residents&#x27; trademark sound for most of the 1970s, with loud horns, odd time signatures and cartoonish vocals. Fans and critics have compared the music to that of Captain Beefheart and the Mothers of Invention.

The first six tracks on the album segue into each other to form a sort of suite, starting with a skeletal cover of Nancy Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;These Boots are Made for Walkin&#x27;&quot; before transitioning into a medley of piano melodies, Dadaist lyrics and oddly-timed percussion, ending in &quot;Smelly Tongues&quot;, one of the group&#x27;s better known songs.

The rest of the album is composed of longer, more developed compositions (with the exception of the short &quot;Skratz&quot;). Tracks like &quot;Rest Aria&quot; and &quot;Spotted Pinto Bean&quot; are structured in a classical manner, with grand piano backdrops, horns, sound effects and operatic vocals.

Meanwhile, the second side of the album consists of more percussion-based mostly instrumental compositions, particularly the track &quot;N-ER-GEE (Crisis Blues)&quot;, the longest track on the album, a suite which at one point notably samples and loops the Human Beinz single &quot;Nobody but Me&quot; (around the word &quot;boogaloo&quot;) and builds increasingly chaotic music around it.

== Artwork ==
The design of &quot;Meet the Residents&quot;, as well as its title, is a direct parody of the Beatles&#x27; 1964 Capitol Records debut, &quot;Meet the Beatles.&quot; The front cover features all four Beatles cartoonishly defaced, while the back cover is formatted identically to the original, substituting the sleeve notes, track listing, album and publishing credits, and crawfish heads and claws are drawn over the original Beatles band photo (except for Ringo Starr, whose head is replaced by a starfish). The band members are subsequently credited as &quot;John Crawfish,&quot; &quot;George Crawfish,&quot; &quot;Paul McCrawfish,&quot; and &quot;Ringo Starfish.&quot;

The cover allegedly drew the attention of Capitol Records, who threatened legal action if the cover were not changed. In response, the Residents pressed a stereo edit of the album with new artwork, presenting the original &quot;crawfish&quot; photo on the front (although the original defaced cover is still printed in the back, although in smaller size). It is unknown if the threat of legal action from Capitol was actually real, given that all subsequent re-releases of the album have again featured the original 1974 artwork.

== Recording ==
&quot;Meet the Residents&quot; was recorded from February to October 1973 during breaks from the filming of their long-running project, &quot;Vileness Fats&quot;. The sessions took place at &#x27;El Ralpho Studios&#x27;, a home studio owned by the group which was located on Sycamore Street in San Francisco. Rather than the traditional method of writing, rehearsing and recording a song, the Residents constructed their songs entirely on tape, building up through overdubs. During the early sessions the group had no plans to release the material, but throughout the course of the sessions it evolved into a structured album.

==Release==
In February 1974, in order to promote the upcoming LP, the Residents pressed a six-minute edit of the album onto 4,000 single-sided 8&quot; flexi discs, which were given away for free with Canadian art magazine &quot;FILE&quot;, and San Francisco magazine &quot;Friday&quot;. Due to the satirical nature of the cover, most readers interpreted it as a joke, which hindered already-low album sales: reportedly only 40 copies of 1050 were sold within the year, with most being returned to the publisher unopened. The album was released on April 1, 1974, six months after recording was completed. It was released by Ralph Records, a label formed two years earlier to release the &quot;Santa Dog&quot; EP, which featured anonymous contributions from some of the Residents.

Homer Flynn, the group&#x27;s spokesperson, later recalled that the group&#x27;s first three albums were hard to find in the 1970s, and that the Residents&#x27; homes were filled with boxes of unsold records. By 1977, Ralph had sold out of all 850 original pressings of the album, and so, the Cryptic Corporation (Hardy Fox, Homer Flynn, Jay Clem &amp; John Kennedy), who had obtained ownership of the Residents&#x27; master recordings the year prior, released an abridged stereo version of the album created at Grove Street Studios, where they and the Residents had relocated to.

==Critical reception and legacy==

Although &quot;Meet the Residents&quot; was largely ignored at the time of its release, it has since garnered critical acclaim after a favourable review in a 1977 issue of &quot;Sounds,&quot; which described initially listening to the album as incomprehensible and alien, but said it becomes enjoyable after multiple listens. David Cleary of AllMusic called the band &quot;true avant-garde crazies...[their] work of this time really sounds like nothing else that exists.&quot; Nils Bernstein of eMusic gave the album 4 stars, saying its &quot;brilliance lies in collaging less avant-garde elements like vaudeville, early rock ‘n’ roll, world music and snippets of pop culture in &quot;songs&quot; that were as disorienting as the barrage of media and consumerism they subtly critiqued – the medium is the message, indeed.&quot; In a positive review, Julian Cope said of the album &quot;just as DJ&#x27;s would play the best minute and a half or so the latest garage, soul or pop hits before fading it out into another great single before the listener gets bored, the Residents weld together a collage of the most annoyingly catchy riffs and tunes leaving the listener initially confused and later hooked.&quot;

<doc id="157780" wikidata="Q4042878" url="?curid=157780" title="Lifespring">
<text>Lifespring was an American for-profit human potential organization founded in 1974 by John Hanley Sr., Robert White, Randy Revell, and Charlene Afremow. The organization encountered significant controversy in the 1970s and &#x27;80s, with various academic articles characterizing Lifespring&#x27;s training methods as &quot;deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control&quot;, and allegations that Lifespring was a cult that used coercive methods to prevent members from leaving. These allegations were highlighted in a 1987 article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as well as local television reporting in communities where Lifespring had a significant presence.

Before becoming defunct in the mid-1990s, Lifespring claimed that it had trained more than 400,000 people through its ten centers across the United States.

==Key people==
Lifespring was founded by John Hanley Sr. along with Robert White, Randy Revell, and Charlene Afremow. By October 1987, Hanley owned 92.7 percent of the company. Prior to Lifespring, Hanley had worked for the multi-level marketing organization Holiday Magic. He and the other founders had also worked for Mind Dynamics with Werner Erhard, the founder of est, which became the basis for Landmark Education. Holiday Magic was founded by William Penn Patrick, co-owner and board member for Mind Dynamics. Holiday Magic later folded amidst investigations by authorities and accusations of being a pyramid scheme.

The Director for Corporate Affairs of Lifespring, Charles &quot;Raz&quot; Ingrasci, had also worked at est to promote a mission to the USSR and the Hunger Project. Ingrasci is now President of the Hoffman Institute, an organization founded in 1967 and also part of the human potential movement which offers programs which are similar to Lifespring&#x27;s.

==Course overview==
The Lifespring training generally involved a three-level program starting with a &quot;basic&quot; training, an &quot;advanced&quot; breakthrough course, and a three-month &quot;leadership program&quot; which taught the students how to implement what they learned from the training into their lives. &quot;There is no hope&quot; is a fundamental tenet in the course. The fundamental purpose of the leadership program was enrollment; the participants in the Leadership Program were essentially an unpaid salesforce with the sole mission of enrollment by any means. The trainers used high pressure and humiliation to force participants to achieve enrollment goals. This included yelling at the group as a whole at meetings, and singling individuals out and humiliating them in front of the whole group. Participants were told the city and the world is at stake and the only solution was enrolling as many people into the trainings as possible. Less than two percent found them to be &quot;of no value&quot;. Graduates were often eager to share their own experiences in the training with family, friends, and co-workers, although they were precluded from sharing fellow trainees&#x27; experiences. There was never any compensation for assisting in enrolling others into the workshops. However, another, independent study found, &quot;The merging, grandiosity, and identity confusion that has been encouraged and then exploited in the training in order to control participants is now used to tie them to Vitality (Lifespring) in the future by enrolling them in new trainings and enlisting them as recruiters.&quot;
The basic training was composed of successive sessions on Wednesday night, Thursday night, Friday night, Saturday day and night, Sunday day and night, a Tuesday night post-training session ten days after graduation, and a post-training interview. Evening sessions began at 6:30 pm and lasted until 11:30 or 12 or later. Saturday sessions started at 10 am and sometimes lasted until midnight. Sunday sessions started at 9 am and lasted until approximately 6 pm. The trainings were usually held in the convention facilities of large, easily accessible, moderate priced hotels (i.e., mid-town New York). A basic training was usually composed of 150–200 participants, while an advanced training was composed of 75-100 participants. Approximately 50 percent of advanced training graduates participated in the leadership program. Training also included alumni volunteers who served as small group leaders, several official staff, an assistant trainer, and a head trainer.

The training consisted of a series of lectures and experiential processes designed to show the participants a new manner of contending with life situations and concerns and how other possible explanations and interpretations may lead to different results. Some individuals complained that they felt harangued, embarrassed, or humiliated by the trainer during the training. A few individuals chose not to complete the training. Additionally, the trainer used many English words in a manner different from their usual meaning. &quot;Commitment&quot;, for instance, was defined as &quot;the willingness to do whatever it takes&quot;. &quot;Conclusion&quot; was defined as a belief. Also, words such as &quot;responsibility&quot;, &quot;space&quot;, &quot;surrender&quot;, &quot;experience&quot;, &quot;trust&quot;, &quot;consideration&quot;, &quot;unreasonable&quot;, &quot;righteous&quot;, &quot;totally participate&quot;, &quot;from your head&quot;, &quot;openness&quot;, &quot;letting go&quot; were redefined or used so as to assign them a more specific meaning. &quot;Stretch&quot; was an activity that was outside the participant&#x27;s comfort zone. During the advanced course the participants were sometimes sent out to perform certain tasks. If any participant did not complete their task the group was considered in &quot;breakdown &quot;.

The book &quot;Evaluating a Large Group Awareness Training&quot; made comparisons between Lifespring and Erhard Seminars Training (est).

Lifespring has been characterized as a form of &quot;Large Group Awareness Training&quot; in several sources.

==Lawsuits==
In one case, an asthmatic was allegedly told that her asthma exacerbation was psychological and later died from the exacerbation. The lawsuit was settled for $450,000, and Lifespring admitted no wrongdoing. In another case, a man who could not swim was made to jump into a river and drowned. This case was also settled out of court. Many suits said the trainings placed participants under extreme psychological stress.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; published an article about the company in 1987. It quotes Hanley as saying, &quot;If a thousand people get benefit from the training, and one person is harmed, I&#x27;d can it. I have an absolute commitment for having this training work for every person who takes it.&quot; However, according to the &quot;Post&quot;, by 1987 Hanley and other Lifespring executives had known for more than a decade that some people were not suited for this level of personal inquiry. As evidence, the &quot;Post&quot; cited:
* Talk among top company officials about how to make the trainings less harsh while maintaining their effectiveness
* Dozens of reports submitted to Hanley in the late 1970s and early 1980s by Lifespring staff about participants who became panicky, confused, or nervous

Over time, the training company began qualifying students and required doctors&#x27; signatures for people who might require therapy rather than coaching.

==Criticism==
The &quot;Post&quot; also reported in the same article that Hanley had been convicted of six counts of felony mail fraud in 1969, and was given a five-year suspended sentence.

In 1980, a federal judge rejected Hanley&#x27;s request to have the felony conviction removed from his record. His request for a presidential pardon was also denied.

In 1990 KARE-TV (Channel 11, Minneapolis-St. Paul) ran a segment called &quot;Mind Games?&quot; that Lifespring said was deceptive and sensationalized.

One prominent critic of Lifespring is Ginni Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. A congressional aide when she took the course, Mrs. Thomas said in an interview with the &quot;Post&quot; that she was troubled by exercises that involved stripping, sexual questions, and body shaming. After talking with a cult deprogrammer, she decided she needed to stop participating, but it took several months of work to overcome the &quot;high-pressure tactics&quot; to fully break with Lifespring. Afterwards, she received &quot;constant phone calls&quot; to pressure her to stay with the group, and ended up relocating to another part of the country to escape the calls.

<text>Captain Nemo (; also known as Prince Dakkar) is a character created by the French novelist Jules Verne (1828–1905). Nemo appears in two of Verne&#x27;s science-fiction books, &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; (1870) and &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot; (1875). He also makes a brief appearance in a play written by Verne with the collaboration of Adolphe d&#x27;Ennery, &quot;Journey Through the Impossible&quot; (1882).

Nemo is a mysterious figure. Though of unknown nationality in the first book, he is described as the son of an Indian raja in the second book. A scientific visionary, he roams the depths of the seas in his submarine, the &quot;Nautilus&quot;, which was assembled from parts manufactured in several different countries, then shipped to a cover address. The captain is consumed by a hunger for vengeance and hatred of imperialism; Verne included references to anti-imperialist uprisings, including the Kościuszko Uprising and Indian Rebellion of 1857, in the various backstories of Nemo.

Nemo has appeared in various film adaptations of Verne&#x27;s novels, where he has been portrayed by actors as James Mason, Herbert Lom, Patrick Stewart, Naseeruddin Shah, Ben Cross, Omar Sharif and Michael Caine. He has also been appropriated by other authors for their own novels, including Alan Moore and Kevin O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;, Philip José Farmer&#x27;s &quot;The Other Log of Phileas Fogg&quot;, Kevin J. Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Captain Nemo: The Fantastic History of a Dark Genius&quot;, Thomas F. Monteleone&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Sea&quot; and Howard Rodman&#x27;s &quot;The Great Eastern&quot;.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Nemo&quot; is Latin for &#x27;no one&#x27; or &#x27;nobody&#x27;. &quot;Nemo&quot; is itself the Latin translation of Ancient Greek &quot;Outis&quot; &#x27;Nobody&#x27;, the pseudonym adopted by the sea-faring hero Odysseus in Greek mythology to outwit the Cyclops Polyphemus. This appears to be the intended meaning, since in &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;, when Cyrus Smith addresses him as Captain Nemo, the latter replies, &quot;I have no name!&quot;

== Fictional character biography ==

Chief among the few details of Nemo&#x27;s history given in &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; are his hatred of imperialism and his grief over the loss of his loved ones in years past.

In &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Seas&quot;, Captain Nemo is not described as an Indian yet; in fact, his nationality is unknown. This was a result of a controversy between the author and the publisher 
on this subject.
In &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;, Captain Nemo identifies himself as Prince Dakkar, son of the Hindu raja of Bundelkhand, and a descendant of the Muslim Sultan Fateh Ali Khan Tipu of the Kingdom of Mysore, famous for the Anglo-Mysore Wars (1767–1799) and Mysorean rocket technology. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, in which Dakkar lost both his family and his kingdom, the prince devoted himself to scientific research, ultimately building the &quot;Nautilus&quot; and cruising the seven seas with a crew of devoted followers. They gather bullion from various shipwrecks in the ocean, most notably from the hulks of the Spanish treasure fleet sunk during the Battle of Vigo Bay.
However it turns out that the original intention of Jules Verne was to make Captain Nemo a Pole, a participant of the Polish January Uprising against the occupation of Poland by the Russian Empire, and it was planned that Nemo would sink Russian warships. However the publisher, Pierre-Jules Hetzel, strongly objected to this for fear of losing the Russian book market: the book would be banned by Russian censorship. In addition, Hetzel felt that the book would undermine French-Russian relations.

Nemo claims to have no interest in terrestrial affairs but occasionally intervenes to aid people in distress, e.g., by giving salvaged treasure to participants in the Cretan Revolt (1866–1869) against the island&#x27;s Turkish rulers; by saving (both physically and financially) a Ceylonese or Tamil pearl diver from a shark attack; by rescuing the castaways in &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;; and by covertly protecting another set of castaways in &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;.

Like many actual Indian princes of the era, Nemo received a Western education, during which, as he states, he spent his youth touring and studying throughout Europe. In his first meeting with Professor Aronnax and his companions, the three castaways speak to him in French, English, Latin, and German; Nemo later reveals that he is fluent in all of these tongues. Aronnax praises the captain&#x27;s French, noting that he &quot;expressed himself with perfect ease and without any accent.&quot; Relying on his intuition and knowledge of ethnology, the professor concludes that &quot;there&#x27;s southern blood&quot; in him but can&#x27;t determine the captain&#x27;s exact origin. The &quot;Nautilus&quot; library, lounge, and art collections reveal that Nemo is intimately acquainted with European culture, also that he is an accomplished performer on the organ.

Nemo dies of unspecified natural causes on board the &quot;Nautilus&quot;, docked permanently inside Dakkar Grotto on Lincoln Island in the South Pacific. Cyrus Harding, leader of the castaways whom Nemo protected, administered the last rites, then submerged the &quot;Nautilus&quot; in the grotto&#x27;s waters. Shortly after, the volcanic island is destroyed when magma reaches the sea water in Dakkar Grotto, creating a massive steam explosion which blows the island and the &quot;Nautilus&quot; to pieces.

== Character ==
Nemo&#x27;s characteristics are largely presented through the observations of Professor Pierre Aronnax, narrator of &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;. At their first meeting, the professor remarks: &quot;Whether this individual was thirty-five or fifty years of age, I couldn&#x27;t tell.&quot; He goes on to describe Nemo as a tall, self-contained man with a straight nose, broad brow, and wide-set eyes—&quot;certainly the most wonderful physical specimen I&#x27;d ever met up with.&quot; In &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;, the captain is in his late sixties and sports a long white beard.

He avoids dry land, except for desert islands and uninhabited regions such as Antarctica. In keeping with his contempt for surface civilization, he uses few commodities that aren&#x27;t marine in origin, be they food, clothing, or even tobacco. As for his political views, he reveals an intense hatred of oppression, which he associates with the world&#x27;s imperialistic nations. He therefore identifies himself with the Earth&#x27;s oppressed, whether Ceylonese pearl divers, Cretans rising against the Turks, or even right whales attacked by sperm whales. When Professor Aronnax suggests that Nemo violates maritime and international law by sinking warships, Nemo responds that he does so in self-defense when attacked. He insists that terrestrial laws no longer apply to him, exclaiming in one scene:

Nemo is devoted to his crew and grieves deeply when members are killed after a mysterious collision with a surface vessel or during a giant squid attack in the Caribbean Sea. He is equally compassionate in his treatment of the castaways in &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;, also retaining a deep attachment to his deceased wife and children. Despite these tragic losses, he rarely expresses his anger. Moreover, he is a man of immense courage, taking the lead in every emergency, from fighting sharks and squids to releasing the &quot;Nautilus&quot; from Antarctic ice—an ordeal that entailed reduced oxygen stores and consecutive eight-hour shifts. Aronnax also credits him with discovering Atlantis.

An innovative engineer, Nemo both designed and manufactured the &quot;Nautilus&quot;, including her electric propulsion units and navigational systems. Utilizing them with extraordinary skill, he navigated some of the ocean&#x27;s most difficult underwater passages, such as those beneath the Antarctic ice barrier, as well as a fictitious tunnel under the Isthmus of Suez.

He has an exhaustive knowledge of marine biology, and it is his respect for Professor Aronnax&#x27;s preeminence in the field that led to his befriending the professor once the latter was cast aboard the &quot;Nautilus&quot;. Further, Nemo is a polyglot, able to read all the books in the &quot;Nautilus&quot; vast library, regardless of their language. He demonstrates his linguistic ability in &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot;, when Arronax and two other character speak to him in French, English, German, and Latin and he understands all four languages. Other than this he also knows Indian languages Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam, furthermore Greek among others. Nemo also invents a new language that he and his crew use to communicate with each other.

The captain has an exquisite taste in the fine arts, possessing many masterpieces of both painting and sculpture, from old masters to moderns. They are housed in the main lounge of the &quot;Nautilus&quot; along with Nemo&#x27;s collection of pearls, corals, seashells, and other marine items, all gathered with his own hands. &quot;No museum in Europe,&quot; Aronnax tells the captain, &quot;has such a collection of exhibits.&quot; Yet, despite the opulence visible throughout the &quot;Nautilus&quot;, Nemo&#x27;s stateroom was furnished with little more than a bed, a worktable, and the navigational instruments essential to the &quot;Nautilus&quot;. Even so, Captain Nemo claims to be extremely wealthy, boasting that &quot;without the slightest trouble I could pay off the two-billion-dollar French national debt!&quot;

Nemo later tells Aronnax that he will enclose his scientific findings and autobiography in a small unsinkable container: &quot;The last one of us left on the &quot;Nautilus&quot; will throw that container into the sea, and it will drift wherever the waves take it.&quot;

Subsequently, a rather different container does wash ashore in &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;, bearing tools, firearms, navigational instruments, an atlas, books, blank paper, and even clothing. They are found in a crate lashed to empty barrels, its contents sealed in a waterproof zinc envelope and showing careful preparation, and packing. Throughout the same book, Nemo repeatedly acts in this providential way, as when the sailor Pencroff pines for tobacco, then the young naturalist Harbert identifies some of the island&#x27;s plant life.

== Emblem ==

Captain Nemo&#x27;s emblem, as reproduced on the flag he raised when claiming the South Pole, is a large golden N on a black field. The motto of the &quot;Nautilus&quot; was &quot;Mobilis in mobili&quot;, a Latin phrase which Aronnax translates as &quot;Moving within a moving element&quot;. It also has been rendered as &quot;Moving within motion&quot; and &quot;Changing with change&quot; and &quot;mobile/movable [person] in mobile/movable [thing, vehicle]&quot;

== Origin ==

In early drafts of &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;, Nemo appears as a Polish noble, a member of the szlachta bent on avenging the murder of his family during Russia&#x27;s violent suppression of the January Uprising. Verne&#x27;s editor Pierre-Jules Hetzel feared that the book would offend the Russian Empire, a major French ally, and cause the book to be banned from that country&#x27;s bookstores. Accordingly, Hetzel insisted that Verne revise the novel to conceal Nemo&#x27;s background and political motivations.

== Chronological discrepancies ==

&quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; was first published in 1870 and reports the activities of the &quot;Nautilus&quot; over the years 1866 to 1868. &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot; was published in 1875 but is set in the years after the close of the American Civil War, i.e., 1865 to 1869. Described as an elderly man in his late sixties, Captain Nemo claims in its pages to have conducted his undersea travels some sixteen years earlier than the dates given in the prior novel.

It is true that the first French hardcover issue of &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; (an octavo edition published in 1871 by Pierre-Jules Hetzel) contains minor errors that may have been perpetrated by its printers or even by Hetzel himself—who, at times, seems to have made edits without querying Verne. However the chronological discrepancies between this book and &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot; appear to have been present since its publication. They may have arisen from Hetzel&#x27;s insistence that Verne drastically revise his original concept for the latter novel, in which, some scholars speculate, he had not initially planned to include Captain Nemo at all.

==In popular culture==
In the &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; comic series by Alan Moore and Kevin O&#x27;Neill, Captain Nemo&#x27;s Indian ancestry as Prince Dakkar is emphasized, yet his religious identity is left ambiguous between Hinduism and Sikhism. Journalist Shreya Ila Anasuya writes that Moore&#x27;s Nemo is &quot;nebulously portrayed as a Kali-worshipping man in a turban, never self-consciously Sikh.&quot; The title of &quot;Nemo&quot; is also later inherited by Prince Dakkar&#x27;s headstrong daughter, Janni Dakkar, for the &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Nemo Trilogy&quot;.

Nemo is the official file manager for the Cinnamon desktop environment; the name plays off of the Nautilus file manager from which it was forked.

A Polish singer – Bogdan Gajkowski – popular especially during the 1980s, started recording under the stage name &quot;Kapitan Nemo&quot;.

In 1990, the group Dive released their debut single &quot;Captain Nemo&quot;, based on Verne&#x27;s character. This song was covered by Sarah Brightman on her 1993 album &quot;Dive&quot;.

The Japanese otome visual novel &quot;&quot; features a scientist named Nemo. Nemo creates an airship named the &quot;Nautilus&quot; within the game. He considers the engineer Impey Barbicane, a reference to another Jules Verne novel, his ultimate scientific rival.

The Japanese mobile game &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot; features a rider class servant named Captain Nemo. Nemo commands a magical submarine &quot;Nautilus&quot; through the Void Space.

Kevin J. Anderson wrote &quot;Captain Nemo: The Fantastic History of a Dark Genius&quot; (2002), a fictional life of Captain Nemo.

In the 2006 graphic novel &quot;Captain Nemo&quot; by Jason DeAngelis (Seven Seas, ), set in an alternate timeline where Napoleon was never defeated at Waterloo but went on to found a dynasty whose descendants have conquered most of the world, Captain Nemo was, according to the French authorities, &quot;slain and his accursed &quot;Nautilus&quot; sunk&quot; in 1873, and twenty years later his son (who bears the same name as his father) leads his crew aboard the &quot;Nautilus II&quot; against the forces of Napoleon IV using the same tactics as his father, who is buried in a coral tomb, along with members of his crew, on the sunken island of Lemuria.

&quot;Daughter of the Deep&quot;, a 2021 novel by Rick Riordan, features two descendants of Captain Nemo as the protagonist and antagonist.

The animated series &quot;Space Strikers&quot; (known in French as &quot;20 000 Lieues dans l&#x27;espace&quot;; translation: &quot;20,000 Leagues in Space&quot;) stars a descendant of the original Captain Nemo, leading the crew of the spaceship &quot;Nautilus&quot; in a crusade to liberate Earth and other planets from the evil forces of Master Phantom.

In the novel &quot;... no one&quot; of Alberto Cavanna (original title &quot;... nessuno&quot;, Mursia, Italy, 2020), Nemo is John Digby, an admiral of the Royal Navy, appointed captain of the Nautilus by the dying builder.

Captain Nemo appears as the protagonist of the story &quot;Invitación al viaje&quot; (2023) by Óscar Esquivias.

Captain Nemo appears in two gamebooks, Nemo&#x27;s Fury, and Nemo&#x27;s 2: Octo War, by Chris Hunneysett.

The 2024 ten-episode TV-series Nautilus focuses on Nemo and the backstory of the eponymous submarine. Loosely based on the original Jules Verne novel, this series portrays Nemo&#x27;s anti-imperialist struggle against the British East India Company.

<text>Anyanka Christina Emmanuella &quot;Anya&quot; Jenkins (born as Aud) is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon for the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. She also appears in the comic book series based on the television show. Portrayed by Emma Caulfield, the character appears as a recurring star in the third and fourth seasons of the show before becoming a series regular in the show&#x27;s fifth, sixth, and seventh seasons. The character made her last television appearance in 2003, appearing in the series finale of the show that aired on May 20, 2003.

Within the series&#x27; narrative, Anya was originally a human named Aud, but spent over a thousand years as Anyanka, a vengeance demon, wreaking havoc by granting the wishes of women who had been wronged by men. The character becomes human again in her first appearance, and is forced to learn what it means to be human again in subsequent episodes. Primarily, this is used by the writers for comic relief; Anya has a very poor sense of what behaviors are appropriate, and speaks very bluntly and honestly, and flashbacks show that her manner was much the same before she became a demon. However, the writers have also used this for more poignant purposes, such as when Anya finds herself struggling to deal with death. Over a decade after being killed in the series finale, Anya returned as a ghost in the canonical comic book series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten.&quot;

==Character history==

===Backstory===
Anyanka &quot;Anya&quot; Jenkins was born as Aud in the 9th century in Sjornjost, a small Scandinavian village. Aud grew up raising rabbits and became an outsider in her community, which dismissed her as &quot;odd&quot;, because of her strange mannerisms and out-of-the-ordinary ideas (such as not wanting to sell the rabbits she had been breeding, but instead giving them to people in the village as gifts). She eventually falls in love with the boorish Olaf, a Viking warrior who enjoys hunting trolls and drinking at the bar. In 880, a furious Aud discovers that Olaf has cheated on her with a bar matron named Rannveig, and takes her revenge on him by using magic to transform him into a troll. Aud had previously used magic against her past lovers as well, casting spells to create boils on the penis, for example, but this act of vengeance against Olaf attracts the attention of the demon D&#x27;Hoffryn, who offers to transform her into a vengeance demon for scorned women. D&#x27;Hoffryn gives Aud the new name Anyanka, Patron Saint of Scorned Women, and a pendant which gives her the power to grant wishes.

Around 1199, Anyanka goes to the Koskov valleys above the Urals to curse an unfaithful man. She witnesses a sorcerer&#x27;s Ascension into pure demon form. The death and carnage — only a few people survive — shock even her. Around 1580, Anyanka meets (and dates) Dracula, and later is in Salem, Massachusetts, during the witch trials of 1692.

In the 19th century, Anyanka becomes a close friend and fierce competitor of the vengeance demon known as Halfrek, whose specialty is avenging wronged children. They spend time together during the Crimean War. Anyanka impresses &quot;Hallie&quot; with a granted wish in Saint Petersburg, Russia, that sparks a revolution in 1905. In 1914, Anyanka travels to Chicago, Illinois, to exact vengeance on a man named Stewart Burns, turning him into a demon and sending him to a hell dimension to be tortured for all eternity.

===Storylines as a recurring character===
Anyanka arrives at Sunnydale High in 1998 (in the episode &quot;The Wish&quot;) as a student named Anya Emerson. She came to Sunnydale in response to the distress of Cordelia, who is upset after catching her boyfriend, Xander Harris, kissing their friend Willow. After some prompting, Cordelia states: &quot;I wish that Buffy Summers had never come to Sunnydale.&quot; Anya shows her true demon face to Cordelia and says, &quot;Done.&quot; The world changes into an alternative reality in which Buffy has not come to Sunnydale and the vampire population has multiplied and gained in power. Giles meets with Cordelia before she dies and manages to discern what has happened. He subsequently summons Anyanka and destroys her necklace. As a result, Anya is made a mortal and powerless human again and the world returns to normal.

Caulfield said, &quot;As far as I know, I don&#x27;t think Joss Whedon ever intended to have Anya around for more than one episode.&quot; However, Anya returns in the episode &quot;Doppelgangland&quot;, duping Willow into assisting in a failed magical attempt to recover the necklace which was her power center, lost when Giles destroyed it to reverse the wish granted for Cordelia. When these efforts fail, she is forced to continue living as a typical high school student. Now with human feelings, she yearns to attend the school prom in spite of her abhorrence of all men; ironically, her only hope for a date is the last man she was sent to punish, Xander. Caulfield says, &quot;[Whedon] found this great way to have her interact with the storylines that had developed throughout the entire [third] season.&quot;

Anya develops feelings for Xander and asks him out again just before graduation, even though Xander showed no interest in her. Her romantic plans are foiled when he tells her of the Mayor&#x27;s plan for his own &quot;Ascension&quot;, a transformation into pure demon, at the graduation ceremony. Anya decides to flee Sunnydale and invites Xander to join her, saying when she thinks something could happen to him, she &quot;feels bad inside, like [she] might vomit&quot;. Xander refuses because he&#x27;s got &quot;friends on the line&quot;, and can&#x27;t abandon them. She leaves without him.

Anya returns to Sunnydale early in season 4, still infatuated with Xander. She seduces him (in the episode &quot;The Harsh Light of Day&quot;). Her lack of experience with people causes her to make straightforward, often tactless remarks, which soon put her at odds with other Scooby Gang members, especially Willow, who has little trust for the ex-demon. Anya&#x27;s tactlessness is played both for humor and to highlight the truth in situations where others are reluctant to be frank. This is seen most poignantly in &quot;The Body&quot; when her inability to comprehend Buffy&#x27;s mother&#x27;s death leads to inappropriate remarks which at first make others angry, but then allow for catharsis and comfort.

===Storylines as a regular cast member===
Anya becomes a regular in season 5 of the show. While playing &quot;The Game of Life&quot;, she discovers her love for money and capitalism (as opposed to her belief in Communism during the early 20th century and her charitable attitude of her years as Aud). Anya&#x27;s budding retail skills encourage Giles to hire her as a cashier at The Magic Box. In the episode, &quot;Checkpoint&quot;, Anya is questioned by members of the Watchers&#x27; Council, and invents the full name Anya Christina Emmanuella Jenkins, and claims to have been born on the Fourth of July in Indiana.

During an impending apocalypse, brought about by Glory at the end of season 5, Xander proposes to Anya and they are engaged for most of season 6. Xander&#x27;s doubts grow, however, and it is not difficult for Stewart Burns – escaped from Hell and impersonating Xander&#x27;s future self – to persuade him to leave Anya at the wedding by showing him an illusionary life where Anya apparently cheats on Xander and is later killed in an argument between the two (&quot;Hell&#x27;s Bells&quot;). Grief-stricken, Anya is vulnerable to D&#x27;Hoffryn&#x27;s coaxing, and becomes a vengeance demon again.

In the season 6 episode &quot;Entropy&quot; Anya returns to Sunnydale. The audience can see her as a vengeance demon but the other characters are unaware until &quot;Villains&quot;. Anya cannot find anyone who wishes vengeance on Xander and so she takes comfort in sex with Spike, an act which puts her relationship and friendship with Xander and Buffy in jeopardy. Spike nearly wishes for some kind of vengeance upon Xander, but after seeing how much her actions hurt him, Anya stops him, unable to go through with it. In the season 6 finale, Willow destroys The Magic Box, leaving Anya jobless in the mortal world. Anya does not enjoy her return to being a vengeance demon—her experience as a human has led to empathy, which makes exacting vengeance too painful for her to manage. She spends a summer granting half-hearted wishes and gains a reputation among demons as &quot;Miss Soft-Serve&quot;.

When asked what direction she would like to see Anya&#x27;s character go, Emma Caulfield said she hoped that in season 7 Anya would become &quot;kind of a badass&quot;. Caulfield said that Anya has always been strong in unorthodox ways, but &quot;I&#x27;d like to see a more blatant display of her strength.&quot; Appropriately, after Halfrek encourages Anya to return to her former level of work, Anya exacts a terrible vengeance on a group of college boys by unleashing a spider-like Grimslaw demon on them. This results in a battle with Buffy, in which they are almost evenly matched. The battle is interrupted when D&#x27;Hoffryn, summoned by Willow from the Summers home, shows up. D&#x27;Hoffryn asks Anya what she wants, and she asks that her vengeance be reversed. D&#x27;Hoffryn tells her the price will be the life of a vengeance demon; Anya agrees, assuming it is she who will die, but D&#x27;Hoffryn summons Halfrek, incinerating her before Anya. &quot;Never go for the kill, when you can go for the pain&quot; he tells the distressed Anya, and strips her of her powers, making her once again mortal.

Anya decides that she has been too dependent on others and resolves to find an independent purpose in life for herself. She eventually rejoins the Scooby Gang as season 7 focuses on the long fight against the First Evil and eventually becomes friends with Xander; although Xander and Anya still love each other, they never officially resume their relationship.

In the series finale, &quot;Chosen&quot;, Anya fights with the others in the climactic battle against the First Evil and is brutally slain from behind, bisected by a Bringer&#x27;s sword. Her body lies in the school&#x27;s remains although Xander attempts to locate her while fleeing the collapsing building. After Sunnydale collapses into the Hellmouth, Andrew Wells comforts Xander by telling him that Anya had died saving his life, to which Xander tearfully replies, &quot;That&#x27;s my girl, always doing the stupid thing.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;Buffy The Vampire Slayer/Angel&quot; magazine #93, Emma Caulfield stated that she was okay with her character&#x27;s abrupt death, stating, &quot;She didn&#x27;t get a big, maudlin send-off, it was very quick and to the point - very Anya in that respect.&quot; Although later, at Wizard World Philadelphia 2009 she said she didn&#x27;t realize it was going to be abrupt and without fanfare, and would have appreciated a little something more.

Joss Whedon joked at the Nocturnal convention in 2001 Anya was originally supposed to die during the season 5 finale, &quot;The Gift&quot;, but he had to keep her alive because Emma Caulfield couldn&#x27;t keep still while Xander was carrying Anya&#x27;s supposedly lifeless body.

===Comic book series===
It was stated that Anya would return in the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot; comic book series, even with Joss Whedon telling MTV that she was &quot;definitely dead... but that doesn&#x27;t mean she&#x27;s gone.&quot; However, Dark Horse Comics editor Scott Allie stated that there were no current plans for Anya to appear.

In the first issue of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten,&quot; Anya returns as a ghost, having a conversation with Xander during a battle with both a mindless breed of vampires, which Xander has dubbed &quot;zompires,&quot; and another new breed who are stronger and have abilities of withstanding sunlight and shape-shifting. Currently, she is only visible to her former fiancé, and Xander hasn&#x27;t yet informed the gang about Anya. It soon turns out she was a fake ghost who was created by D&#x27;Hoffryn who wanted revenge on Xander. Anya&#x27;s fake ghost realizes that the one thing Anya wanted before she died was taking care of D&#x27;Hoffryn. D&#x27;Hoffryn was pulling Anya&#x27;s strings for a long time, even when she was human. She never cut her strings and finally got her vengeance on D&#x27;Hoffryn and knew that Xander felt bad about what happened between him and Anya. Before departing, she assures Xander that he is a good man and that the original Anya would forgive him as well.

==Powers and abilities==
Anyanka has the power to grant wishes made by women seeking revenge against men who have wronged them, even changing reality to accommodate these wishes, a gift which is supported by her ability to detect women&#x27;s emotional pain at a distance. She has supernatural strength, teleportation (although in &quot;Same Time, Same Place&quot; she mentions that her use of teleportation is temporarily limited and requires bureaucratic paperwork), telekinesis and rapid healing, being able to survive impalement. As a demon she will not die of old age, having lived over a thousand years, but can be killed if her body is sufficiently damaged.

With over a thousand years of experience as a former vengeance demon, Anya&#x27;s knowledge of demonology and various dimensions is immense, surpassing both Giles and his successor Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, but not as skilled as them in research. Although her native language is Old Norse, Anyanka/Anya speaks fluent English as well as some French, Latin and can read and speak Ancient Sumerian. It is implied that she can speak any human language, as she has granted wishes in many countries all over the world throughout many centuries. Despite being human, Anya still has contacts with some of her former associates.

Anya also exhibits some basic knowledge of magic, often commenting on Willow&#x27;s spellcasting and interest in magic with a reasonable degree of insight, and she occasionally participates in the casting of spells herself (&quot;Doppelgangland&quot;). As a human, Anya&#x27;s experience and practice of combat from her time as a demon allows her to be an effective fighter, as seen in the series finale.

As a ghost, Anya is incorporeal and invisible to everyone except Xander.

==Personality==
Commenting on the personality of her character, Caulfield said, &quot;Anya remains mortal and ambivalent. She&#x27;s just struggling with being human, and really, don&#x27;t we all struggle with that from time to time? She&#x27;s very indifferent - and definitely sarcastic and bitter at times.&quot; Anya states in the &quot;Selfless&quot; flashback that she likes to bowl and she&#x27;s &quot;good with math&quot;.

===Bunny phobia===
Anya&#x27;s irrational fear of rabbits (leporiphobia) is established for the first time in the season 4 Halloween episode &quot;Fear, Itself&quot;, in which she appears in a bunny costume after Xander tells her to come to the party as something &quot;scary&quot;. Her phobia becomes a running joke for the remainder of the series. In &quot;The Gift&quot;, Anya sees a stuffed rabbit in the basement of The Magic Box (while looking for the Dagon Sphere with Xander), causing her to scream and exclaim, &quot;Who would put something like that there?!&quot; In &quot;Once More, With Feeling&quot;, Anya sings, &quot;Bunnies aren&#x27;t just cute like everybody supposes. They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses, and what&#x27;s with all the carrots? What do they need such good eyesight for anyway?&quot;, a verse reminiscent of Willow&#x27;s speech about spiders (&quot;Nightmares&quot;). In &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot;, while suffering from memory loss, she repeatedly casts a spell that does nothing more than cause rabbits to appear in increasing numbers. The phobia also manifests itself in her final moments. As the final battle approaches, Andrew Wells suggests she &quot;picture happy things: a lake, candy canes, bunnies...&quot; The change is drastic and instantaneous. She confidently raises her sword, saying grimly, &quot;Bunnies. Floppy, hoppy, bunnies.&quot;

In her &quot;origins&quot; episode, &quot;Selfless&quot;, Anya (then known as Aud), is surrounded by rabbits without showing any signs of distress over their presence.

==Academic analysis==
Anya has been the subject of at least one academic article. For Tamy Burnett, &quot;Anya ... stands alone as the only woman in the Buffyverse to remain unshamed and unpunished for her expressions of sexuality&quot;. Burnett argues that, among &quot;Buffy&quot;″s female characters, despite their varying versions of personal and/or mental strength, Anya is the only one who is truly sexually liberated. Buffy and her friends tend to be &quot;girly girls&quot;, who learn that &quot;Sex is bad&quot; and have their transgressions of traditional gender performance punished; Burnett cites the loss of Angel&#x27;s soul, punitive interpretations of Tara&#x27;s death, and Willow&#x27;s transformation into Warren among other consequences. Faith comes &quot;the closest&quot; after Anya to breaking these traditional patterns because, while she is &quot;just as sexual and outspoken&quot; as Anya, she pivotally does not achieve Anya&#x27;s acceptance within the group; for Anya, this &quot;legitimizes her perspective&quot;. She identifies this motif with typical traits of horror fiction, citing Dawn Heinecken&#x27;s feminist analysis in &quot;Warrior Women of Television&quot;. Anya frankly admits to masturbation and to her favourite sexual activities with Xander, and assumes that others share her attitudes. To Burnett, Anya&#x27;s death in &quot;Chosen&quot; positions Anya as &quot;failing to achieve [her] ultimate narrative legitimacy&quot;. Burnett concludes that &quot;Anya&#x27;s attitude toward sexual desire marks her as transgressing traditional forms of female sexuality, a significant break to the pattern by which other women on the show are constrained.&quot;

==Appearances==
&quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;: Anya appeared in 81 canon episodes. Anya was a series regular from Seasons Five through Seven (2000–2003), but did not appear in &quot;Normal Again&quot;, &quot;Help&quot; (her scenes were cut), &quot;Conversations with Dead People&quot;, and &quot;Dirty Girls&quot;. Prior to season 5, Anya was a recurring character for seasons three to four, appearing in the following episodes:

* Season 3 (1998–1999): &quot;The Wish&quot;, &quot;Doppelgangland&quot;, &quot;The Prom&quot; and &quot;Graduation Day, Part One&quot;.
* Season 4 (1999–2000): &quot;The Harsh Light of Day&quot;, &quot;Fear, Itself&quot;, &quot;Pangs&quot;, &quot;Something Blue&quot;, &quot;Hush&quot;, &quot;A New Man&quot;, &quot;The I in Team&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Iowa&quot;, &quot;Who Are You&quot;, &quot;Superstar&quot;, &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;, &quot;New Moon Rising&quot;, &quot;The Yoko Factor&quot;, &quot;Primeval&quot;, and &quot;Restless&quot;.

Anya has also appeared in a number of comics including &quot;Past Lives&quot;, &quot;Ugly Little Monsters&quot;, and &quot;Reunion&quot;, and in novels including &quot;Unseen&quot;, &quot;Wisdom of War&quot; and &quot;Monster Island&quot;. She also makes a brief appearance in the 2003 video game &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Chaos Bleeds&quot;.

==Merchandise==
In 2005, Diamond Select Toys produced several action figures in the likeness of Emma Caulfield for their &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; line. Each figure featured a &quot;real-scan&quot; likeness of Caulfield and episode/character specific outfit. Figures produced were: &quot;Season 5 Anya&quot; in red top and black skirt, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Bells Anya&quot; in wedding dress, &quot;Once More, With Feeling Anya&quot; in butterfly top and green skirt, &quot;Anyanka&quot; in demon dress, and &quot;Bunny Suit Anya&quot; in removable bunny suit. A repaint of &quot;Bunny Suit Anya&quot; was featured in the Vengeance Book box-set.

<doc id="157792" wikidata="Q1989639" url="?curid=157792" title="Autokey cipher">
<text>An autokey cipher (also known as the autoclave cipher) is a cipher that incorporates the message (the plaintext) into the key. The key is generated from the message in some automated fashion, sometimes by selecting certain letters from the text or, more commonly, by adding a short &quot;primer key&quot; to the front of the message.

There are two forms of autokey cipher: &quot;key-autokey&quot; and &quot;text-autokey&quot; ciphers. A key-autokey cipher uses previous members of the keystream to determine the next element in the keystream. A text-autokey uses the previous message text to determine the next element in the keystream.

==History==
This cipher was invented in 1586 by Blaise de Vigenère with a reciprocal table of ten alphabets. Vigenère&#x27;s version used an agreed-upon letter of the alphabet as a primer, making the key by writing down that letter and then the rest of the message.

More popular autokeys use a tabula recta, a square with 26 copies of the alphabet, the first line starting with &#x27;A&#x27;, the next line starting with &#x27;B&#x27; etc. Instead of a single letter, a short agreed-upon keyword is used, and the key is generated by writing down the primer and then the rest of the message, as in Vigenère&#x27;s version. To encrypt a plaintext, the row with the first letter of the message and the column with the first letter of the key are located. The letter in which the row and the column cross is the ciphertext letter.

==Method==
The autokey cipher, as used by members of the American Cryptogram Association, starts with a relatively-short keyword, the &quot;primer&quot;, and appends the message to it. For example, if the keyword is and the message is , then the key would be .

 Plaintext: attackatdawn
 Key: QUEENLYATTACKATDAWN
 Ciphertext: QNXEPVYTWTWP

The ciphertext message would thus be &quot;QNXEPVYTWTWP&quot;.

To decrypt the message, the recipient would start by writing down the agreed-upon keyword.

 QNXEPVYTWTWP
 QUEENLY

The first letter of the key, Q, would then be taken, and that row would be found in a tabula recta. That column for the first letter of the ciphertext would be looked across, also Q in this case, and the letter to the top would be retrieved, A. Now, that letter would be added to the end of the key:

 QNXEPVYTWTWP
 QUEENLYA
 a

Then, since the next letter in the key is U and the next letter in the ciphertext is N, the U row is looked across to find the N to retrieve T:

 QNXEPVYTWTWP
 QUEENLYAT
 at

That continues until the entire key is reconstructed, when the primer can be removed from the start.

With Vigenère&#x27;s autokey cipher, a single mistake in encryption renders the rest of the message unintelligible.

==Cryptanalysis==
Autokey ciphers are somewhat more secure than polyalphabetic ciphers that use fixed keys since the key does not repeat within a single message. Therefore, methods like the Kasiski examination or index of coincidence analysis will not work on the ciphertext, unlike for similar ciphers that use a single repeated key.

A crucial weakness of the system, however, is that the plaintext is part of the key. That means that the key will likely contain common words at various points. The key can be attacked by using a dictionary of common words, bigrams, trigrams etc. and by attempting the decryption of the message by moving that word through the key until potentially-readable text appears.

Consider an example message codice_1 encrypted with the primer keyword codice_2: To start, the autokey would be constructed by placing the primer at the front of the message:

 plaintext: meetatthefountain
 primer: KILT
 autokey: KILTMEETATTHEFOUN

The message is then encrypted by using the key and the substitution alphabets, here a tabula recta:

 plaintext: meetatthefountain
 key: KILTMEETATTHEFOUN
 ciphertext: WMPMMXXAEYHBRYOCA

The attacker receives only the ciphertext and can attack the text by selecting a word that is likely to appear in the plaintext. In this example, the attacker selects the word codice_3 as a potential part of the original message and then attempts to decode it by placing codice_4 at every possible location in the key:

 ciphertext: WMP MMX XAE YHB RYO CA 
 key: THE THE THE THE THE ..
 plaintext: dfl tft eta fax yrk ..
 ciphertext: W MPM MXX AEY HBR YOC A
 key: . THE THE THE THE THE .
 plaintext: . tii tqt hxu oun fhy .
 ciphertext: WM PMM XXA EYH BRY OCA
 key: .. THE THE THE THE THE
 plaintext: .. wfi eqw lrd iku vvw

In each case, the resulting plaintext appears almost random because the key is not aligned for most of the ciphertext. However, examining the results can suggest locations of the key being properly aligned. In those cases, the resulting decrypted text is potentially part of a word. In this example, it is highly unlikely that codice_5 is the start of the original plaintext and so it is highly unlikely either that the first three letters of the key are codice_4. Examining the results, a number of fragments that are possibly words can be seen and others can be eliminated. Then, the plaintext fragments can be sorted in their order of likelihood:

 unlikely ←——————————————————→ promising
 eqw dfl tqt ... ... ... ... eta oun fax

A correct plaintext fragment is also going to appear in the key, shifted right by the length of the keyword. Similarly, the guessed key fragment (codice_4) also appears in the plaintext shifted left. Thus, by guessing keyword lengths (probably between 3 and 12), more plaintext and key can be revealed.

Trying that with codice_8, possibly after wasting some time with the others, results in the following:

 shift by 4:
 ciphertext: WMPMMXXAEYHBRYOCA
 key: ...ETA.THE.OUN
 plaintext: ...the.oun.ain

 shift by 5:
 ciphertext: WMPMMXXAEYHBRYOCA
 key: ...EQW..THE..OU
 plaintext: ...the..oun..og

 shift by 6:
 ciphertext: WMPMMXXAEYHBRYOCA
 key: ...TQT...THE...O
 plaintext: ...the...oun...m

A shift of 4 can be seen to look good (both of the others have unlikely Qs) and so the revealed codice_9 can be shifted back by 4 into the plaintext:

 ciphertext: WMPMMXXAEYHBRYOCA
 key: ..LTM.ETA.THE.OUN
 plaintext: ..eta.the.oun.ain

A lot can be worked with now. The keyword is probably 4 characters long (codice_10), and some of the message is visible:

 m.eta.the.oun.ain

Because the plaintext guesses have an effect on the key 4 characters to the left, feedback on correct and incorrect guesses is given. The gaps can quickly be filled in:

 meetatthefountain

The ease of cryptanalysis is caused by the feedback from the relationship between plaintext and key. A three-character guess reveals six more characters (three on each side), which then reveal further characters, creating a cascade effect. That allows incorrect guesses to be ruled out quickly.

<text>Joseph Carey Merrick (5 August 1862 – 11 April 1890) was an English artist known for his severe physical deformities. He was first exhibited at a freak show under the stage name &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, and then went to live at the London Hospital, in Whitechapel, after meeting the surgeon Sir Frederick Treves. Despite his challenges, Merrick created detailed artistic works, such as intricate models of buildings, and became well known in London society.

Merrick was born in Leicester and began to develop abnormally before the age of five. His mother died when he was eleven, and his father soon remarried. Rejected by his father and stepmother, he left home and went to live with his uncle, Charles Merrick. In 1879, 17-year-old Merrick entered the Leicester Union Workhouse. In 1884, he contacted a showman named Sam Torr and proposed that he might be exhibited. Torr arranged for a group of men to manage Merrick, whom they named &quot;the Elephant Man&quot;. After touring the East Midlands, Merrick travelled to London to be exhibited in a penny gaff shop rented by showman Tom Norman. The shop was visited by surgeon Frederick Treves, who invited Merrick to be physically examined. Merrick was displayed by Treves at a meeting of the Pathological Society of London in 1884, after which Norman&#x27;s shop was closed by the police. Merrick then joined Sam Roper&#x27;s circus and then toured in Europe by an unknown manager.

In Belgium, Merrick was robbed by his road manager and abandoned in Brussels. He eventually made his way back to the London Hospital, where he was allowed to stay for the rest of his life. Treves visited him daily, and the pair developed a close friendship. Merrick also received visits from some of the wealthy ladies and gentlemen of London society, including Alexandra, Princess of Wales. 

Merrick died in the hospital on 11 April 1890. Although the official cause of his death was asphyxia, Treves, who performed the postmortem, concluded that Merrick had died of a dislocated neck.

The exact cause of Merrick&#x27;s deformities is unclear, but in 1986 it was conjectured that he had Proteus syndrome. In a 2003 study, DNA tests on his hair and bones were inconclusive because his skeleton had been bleached numerous times before going on display at the Royal London Hospital. Merrick&#x27;s life was depicted in a 1977 play by Bernard Pomerance and in a 1980 film by David Lynch, both titled &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;.

== Early life and family ==

Joseph Carey Merrick was born on 5 August 1862, at 50 Lee Street in Leicester, to Joseph Rockley Merrick and his wife Mary Jane (née Potterton). Joseph Rockley Merrick (–1897) was the son of London-born weaver Barnabas Merrick (1791–1856) who moved to Leicester during the 1820s or 1830s, and his third wife Sarah Rockley. Mary Jane Potterton (–1873), born at Evington in Leicestershire, was the daughter of William Potterton, who was described as an agricultural labourer in the 1851 census of Thurmaston, Leicestershire. As a young woman, she worked as a domestic servant in Leicester before marrying Joseph Rockley Merrick, who at the time was a warehouseman, in 1861.

Merrick was apparently healthy at birth, and he had no outward anatomical signs or symptoms of any disorder for the first few years of his life. Named after his father, he was given the middle name Carey by his mother, a Baptist, after the preacher William Carey. The Merricks had two other children: William Arthur, born January 1866, who died of scarlet fever on 21 December 1870 aged four and was buried on Christmas Day 1870; and Marion Eliza, born 28 September 1867, who had physical disabilities and died of myelitis and &quot;seizures&quot; on 19 March 1891, aged 23. William is buried with his mother, aunts and uncles in Welford Road Cemetery in Leicester; Marion is buried with her father in Belgrave Cemetery in Leicester.

Mary Jane&#x27;s gravestone wrongly indicates that she had four children. It was originally understood that John Thomas Merrick (born 21 April 1864)—who died of smallpox on 24 July of the same year—was the fourth child of Joseph and Mary Jane Merrick, but the GRO birth records indicate that he was in fact not related to them.

A pamphlet titled &quot;The Autobiography of Joseph Carey Merrick&quot;, produced c. 1884 to accompany his exhibition, states that he began to display anatomical signs at approximately five years of age, with &quot;thick lumpy skin ... like that of an elephant, and almost the same colour&quot;. According to a 1930 article in the &quot;Illustrated Leicester Chronicle&quot;, he began to develop swellings on his lips at the age of 21 months, followed by a bony lump on his forehead and a loosening and roughening of the skin. As he grew, a noticeable difference between the size of his left and right arms appeared, and both his feet became significantly enlarged. The Merrick family explained his symptoms as the result of Mary Jane being knocked over and frightened by a fairground elephant while she was pregnant with him. The concept of maternal impression—that the emotional experiences of pregnant women could have lasting physical effects on their unborn children—was still common in 19th-century Britain. Merrick held this belief about the cause of his disability throughout his life.

In addition to his deformities, Merrick fell and damaged his left hip at some point during his childhood. The injury site became infected and left him permanently disabled. Although limited by his physical deformities, Merrick attended school and enjoyed a close relationship with his mother. She was a Sunday school teacher, and his father worked as an engine driver at a cotton factory, as well as running a haberdashery business. Mary Jane Merrick died from bronchopneumonia on 29 May 1873, two and a half years after the death of her youngest son William. Joseph Rockley Merrick moved with his two surviving children to live with Mrs. Emma Wood Antill, a widow with children of her own. They married on 3 December 1874.

== Employment and the workhouse ==

Merrick left school aged 13, which was usual for the time. His home life was now &quot;a perfect misery&quot;, and neither his father nor his stepmother demonstrated affection toward him. He ran away &quot;two or three&quot; times, but was taken back by his father each time. At 13, he found work rolling cigars in a factory, but after three years, the deformity of his right hand had worsened to the extent that he no longer had the dexterity required for the job. Now unemployed, he spent his days wandering the streets, looking for work and avoiding his stepmother&#x27;s taunts.

As Merrick was becoming a greater financial burden on his family, his father eventually secured him a hawker&#x27;s licence enabling him to earn money selling items from the haberdashery shop, door to door. This endeavour was unsuccessful because Merrick&#x27;s facial deformities rendered his speech increasingly unintelligible, and prospective customers reacted with horror to his physical appearance. People refused to open the door to him, and they not only stared at him, but followed him out of curiosity. Merrick failed to make enough money as a hawker to support himself. On returning home one day in 1877, he was severely beaten by his father and he left home for good.
Merrick was now homeless on the streets of Leicester. His uncle, a barber named Charles Merrick, on hearing of his nephew&#x27;s situation, sought him out and offered him accommodation in his home. Merrick continued to hawk around Leicester for the next two years but his efforts to earn a living met with little more success than before. Eventually, his disfigurement drew such negative attention from members of the public that the Commissioners for Hackney Carriages withdrew his licence when it came up for renewal. With young children to provide for, Charles could no longer afford to support his nephew. In late December 1879, now 17 years old, Merrick entered the Leicester Union Workhouse.

One of 1,180 residents in the workhouse, Merrick was given a classification to determine his place of accommodation. The class system specified the department or ward in which a resident would reside, as well as the amounts of food received. Merrick was classified as Class One for able-bodied people. On 22 March 1880, only 12 weeks after entering the workhouse, Merrick signed himself out and spent two days looking for work. With no more success than before, he found himself with no option but to return to the workhouse. This time, he stayed for four years.

Around 1882, Merrick underwent surgery on his face. The protrusion from his mouth had grown to 20–22 centimetres, severely inhibiting his speech and making it difficult to eat. The operation was performed in the Workhouse Infirmary under the direction of Dr Clement Frederick Bryan, during which a large part of the mass was removed.

== Life as a curiosity ==
Merrick concluded that his only escape from the workhouse might be through the world of human novelty exhibitions. He wrote a speculative letter to Sam Torr, a Leicester music hall comedian and proprietor that he knew. Torr came to visit Merrick at the workhouse and decided he could make money exhibiting him; although, to retain Merrick&#x27;s novelty value, he would need to be put on display as a travelling exhibit. To this end, Torr organised a group of managers for his new charge: music hall proprietor J. Ellis, travelling showman George Hitchcock, and fair owner Sam Roper. On 3 August 1884, Merrick departed the workhouse to start his new career.
The showmen named Merrick the Elephant Man and advertised him as &quot;Half-a-Man and Half-an-Elephant&quot;. They showed him around the East Midlands, including in Leicester and Nottingham, before moving him on to London for the winter season. Hitchcock contacted an acquaintance, showman Tom Norman, who ran penny gaff shops in the East End of London exhibiting human curiosities. Without the need for a meeting, Norman agreed to take over Merrick&#x27;s management, and Merrick travelled with Hitchcock to London in November 1884.

When Norman first encountered Merrick, he was dismayed by the extent of his deformities, fearing his appearance might be too horrific to be a successful novelty. Nevertheless, he exhibited Merrick in the back of an empty shop on Whitechapel Road. Merrick slept on an iron bed with a curtain drawn around to afford him some privacy. Observing Merrick asleep one morning, Norman learnt that he always slept sitting up, with his legs drawn up and his head resting on his knees. His enlarged head was too heavy to allow him to sleep lying down and, as Merrick put it, he would risk &quot;waking with a broken neck&quot;. Norman decorated the shop with posters that Hitchcock had produced, depicting a monstrous half-man, half-elephant. A pamphlet was created, titled &quot;The Autobiography of Joseph Carey Merrick&quot;, giving an outline of Merrick&#x27;s life to date. This brief biography, whether written by Merrick or not, provided a generally accurate account of his life. It did contain an incorrect date of birth, but Merrick was always vague about when exactly he was born.
Norman gathered an audience by standing outside the shop and attracting passers-by with his showman&#x27;s patter. He would then lead the assembled crowd into the shop, explaining that the Elephant Man was &quot;not here to frighten you but to enlighten you&quot;. Pulling the curtain to one side, he allowed the onlookers—often visibly horrified—to observe Merrick up close, while describing the circumstances that had led to his present condition, including his mother&#x27;s alleged incident with a fairground elephant.

The Elephant Man exhibit was moderately successful, and made money primarily from the sales of the autobiographical pamphlet. Merrick was able to put his share of the profits aside, in the hope of earning enough money to one day buy a home of his own. The shop on Whitechapel Road was directly opposite the London Hospital, ideally situated for medical students and doctors to visit, curious to see Merrick. One such visitor was a young house surgeon named Reginald Tuckett, who, like his colleagues, was intrigued by the Elephant Man&#x27;s deformities. Tuckett suggested that his senior colleague Frederick Treves should pay Merrick a visit.
Treves first met Merrick that November, at a private viewing that took place before Norman opened the shop for the day. Treves later recalled in his 1923 &quot;Reminiscences&quot; that Merrick was &quot;the most disgusting specimen of humanity that I had ever seen [...] at no time had I met with such a degraded or perverted version of a human being as this lone figure displayed.&quot; The viewing lasted no more than 15 minutes, after which Treves returned to work. Later the same day, he sent Tuckett back to the shop to ask if Merrick might be willing to go to the hospital for an examination. Norman and Merrick both agreed to the request. To allow him to travel the short distance without drawing undue attention, Merrick wore a disguise consisting of an oversized black cloak and a brown cap with a hessian sack covering his face, and he rode in a cab hired by Treves. Although Treves stated that Merrick&#x27;s outfit on this occasion included the black cloak and brown cap, there is evidence to suggest that Merrick acquired that particular costume a year later, while travelling with Sam Roper&#x27;s Fair. If that were the case, Treves was remembering the clothing from a later meeting with Merrick.

On examining Merrick at the hospital, Treves observed that he was &quot;shy, confused, not a little frightened, and evidently much cowed&quot;. At this point, Treves assumed him to be an &quot;imbecile&quot;. He measured Merrick&#x27;s head circumference at the enlarged size of , his right wrist at and one of his fingers at in circumference. He noted that Merrick&#x27;s skin was covered in papillomata (warty growths), the largest of which exuded an unpleasant smell. The subcutaneous tissue appeared to be weakened, causing a loosening of the skin which, in some areas, hung away from the body. There were bone deformities in the right arm, both legs, and, most conspicuously, in the large skull. Despite having had corrective surgery to his mouth in 1882, Merrick&#x27;s speech remained barely intelligible. His left arm and hand were neither enlarged nor deformed. His penis and scrotum were normal. Apart from his deformities and the lameness in his hip, Treves concluded that Merrick appeared to be in good general health.

Norman later recalled that Merrick had visited the hospital &quot;two or three&quot; times, and that Treves had given Merrick his calling card during one of those visits. Treves had some photographs taken on one occasion, and provided Merrick with a set of copies which were later added to his autobiographical pamphlet. On 2 December 1884, Treves presented Merrick at a meeting of the Pathological Society of London in Bloomsbury. Merrick eventually told Norman that he no longer wanted to be examined at the hospital. According to Norman, he said he was &quot;stripped naked and felt like an animal in a cattle market&quot;.

During this period in Victorian Britain, tastes were changing in regard to freak show exhibitions like Norman&#x27;s, which were becoming a cause for public concern on the grounds of decency and because of the disruption caused by crowds gathering outside them. Shortly after Merrick&#x27;s last examination with Treves, the police closed down Norman&#x27;s shop on Whitechapel Road, and Merrick&#x27;s Leicester managers withdrew him from Norman&#x27;s charge. In 1885, Merrick went on the road with Sam Roper&#x27;s travelling fair. He befriended two other performers, known as &quot;Roper&#x27;s Midgets&quot;—Bertram Dooley and Harry Bramley—who occasionally defended Merrick from public harassment.

==Europe==
As the dampening of public enthusiasm for freak shows and human oddities continued, the police and magistrates became increasingly vigilant in closing down shows. Merrick remained a horrifying spectacle for his viewers, but Roper grew nervous about the negative attention he was drawing from local authorities. Merrick&#x27;s group of managers decided he should go on tour in continental Europe, with the hope that the authorities there would be more lenient. His management was assumed by an unknown man (possibly named Ferrari) and they left for the continent. 

Merrick was no more successful in continental Europe than he had been in Britain, and similar action was taken by the authorities to move him out of their jurisdictions. In Brussels, Merrick was deserted by his new manager, who stole his £50 (equivalent to about £ in ) savings. Abandoned and penniless, Merrick made his way by train to Ostend, where he attempted to board a ferry for Dover, but was refused passage. He travelled to Antwerp, and was able to board a ship bound for Harwich in Essex. From there, he travelled by train to London and arrived at Liverpool Street station.

Merrick reached London on 24 June 1886, safely back in his own country but with nowhere to go. He was not eligible to enter a workhouse in London for more than one night; the only place that would accept him was the Leicester Union Workhouse (where he had earlier been a permanent resident), but Leicester was away.

He approached strangers for help, but his speech was unintelligible and his appearance repugnant. After drawing a crowd of curious onlookers, Merrick was helped by a policeman into an empty waiting room, where he huddled in a corner, exhausted. Unable to make himself understood, his only identifying possession was Treves&#x27;s card. 

The police contacted Treves, who went to the train station and, on recognising Merrick, took him in a hansom cab to the London Hospital. Merrick was admitted for bronchitis, washed, fed and then put to bed in a small isolation room in the hospital&#x27;s attic.

== London Hospital ==

With Merrick admitted into the hospital, Treves now had time to conduct a more thorough examination. He discovered that Merrick&#x27;s physical condition had deteriorated over the previous two years and that he had become impaired by his deformities. Treves also suspected that Merrick had a heart condition and had only a few years left to live. Merrick&#x27;s general health improved over the next five months under the care of the hospital staff. Although some nurses were initially upset by his appearance, they were able to overcome this and take care of him.

The problem of Merrick&#x27;s unpleasant odour was mitigated through frequent bathing, and Treves gradually developed an understanding of his speech. A new set of photographs was taken. Francis Carr Gomm, the chairman of the hospital committee, had supported Treves in his decision to admit Merrick, but it was clear by November that long-term care plans were needed. The London Hospital was not equipped or staffed to provide care for the incurable, which Merrick clearly was.

Carr Gomm contacted other institutions and hospitals more suited to caring for chronic cases, but none would accept Merrick. Gomm wrote a letter to &quot;The Times&quot;, printed on 4 December 1886, outlining Merrick&#x27;s case and asking readers for suggestions. The public response—in letters and donations—was significant, and the situation was even covered by the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;. With the financial backing of the many donors, Gomm was able to make a convincing case to the committee for keeping Merrick in the hospital. It was decided that he would be allowed to stay there for the remainder of his life. He was moved from the attic to the basement, where he could occupy two rooms adjacent to a small courtyard. The rooms were adapted and furnished to suit Merrick, with a specially constructed bed and—at Treves&#x27;s instruction—no mirrors.

Merrick settled into his new life at the London Hospital. Treves visited him daily and spent a couple of hours with him every Sunday. Now that Merrick had found someone who understood his speech, he was delighted to carry on long conversations with the doctor. Treves and Merrick built a friendly relationship, although Merrick never completely confided in him. He told Treves that he was an only child, and Treves had the impression that his mother, whose picture Merrick always carried with him, had abandoned him as a baby. Merrick was also reluctant to talk about his exhibition days, although he expressed gratitude towards his former managers. It did not take Treves long to realise that, contrary to his initial impressions, Merrick was not intellectually impaired.
Treves observed that Merrick was very sensitive and showed his emotions easily. At times, Merrick was bored and lonely, and demonstrated signs of depression. He had spent his entire adult life segregated from women, first in the workhouse and then as an exhibit. The women he met were either disgusted or frightened by his appearance. His opinions about women were derived from his memories of his mother and what he read in books. Treves decided that Merrick would like to be introduced to a woman and it would help him feel normal. The doctor arranged for a friend of his named Mrs. Leila Maturin, &quot;a young and pretty widow&quot;, to visit Merrick. She agreed and with fair warning about his appearance, she went to his rooms for an introduction. The meeting was short, as Merrick quickly became overcome with emotion. He later told Treves that Maturin had been the first woman ever to smile at him, and the first to shake his hand. She kept in contact with him and a letter written by Merrick to her, thanking her for the gift of a book and a brace of grouse, is the only surviving letter written by Merrick. This first experience of meeting a woman, though brief, instilled in Merrick a new sense of self-confidence. He met other women during his life at the hospital, and appeared taken with them all. Treves believed that Merrick&#x27;s hope was to one day live at an institution for the blind, where he might meet a woman who could not see his deformities.

Merrick wanted to know about the &quot;real world&quot;, and questioned Treves on a number of topics. On one occasion, he expressed a desire to see inside what he considered a &quot;real&quot; house and Treves obliged, taking him to visit his Wimpole Street townhouse and meet his wife. At the hospital, Merrick spent his days reading and constructing models of buildings out of card. He entertained visits from Treves and his house surgeons. He rose each day in the afternoon and would leave his rooms to walk in the small adjacent courtyard, after dark.
As a result of Carr Gomm&#x27;s letters to &quot;The Times&quot;, Merrick&#x27;s case attracted the notice of London&#x27;s high society. One person who took a keen interest was actress Madge Kendal. Although she probably never met him in person, she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick. She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver to go to his rooms and teach him the craft. Other people of high society did visit him, however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He reciprocated with letters and handmade gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough to converse with people who passed his windows. A young man, Charles Taylor, the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick&#x27;s rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin. Occasionally, Merrick grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and explore the hospital. When discovered, he was always hurried back to his quarters by the nurses, who feared he might frighten the patients.

On 21 May 1887, two new buildings were completed at the hospital and the Prince and Princess of Wales came to open them officially. The princess wished to meet Merrick, so after a tour of the hospital, the royal party went to his rooms for an introduction. Princess Alexandra shook Merrick&#x27;s hand and sat with him, an experience that left him overjoyed. She gave him a signed photograph of herself, which became a prized possession, and she sent him a Christmas card each year.

On at least one occasion, Merrick was able to fulfill a long-held desire to visit the theatre. Treves, with the help of Madge Kendal, arranged for him to attend the Christmas pantomime at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Merrick sat with some nurses, concealed in Lady Burdett-Coutts&#x27; private box. According to Treves, Merrick was &quot;awed&quot; and &quot;enthralled&quot;, and &quot;[the] spectacle left him speechless, so that if he were spoken to he took no heed.&quot; Merrick talked about the pantomime for weeks afterwards, reliving the story as if it had been real.

== Last years ==
On three occasions, Merrick left the hospital to go on holiday, spending a few weeks at a time in the countryside. By means of elaborate arrangements that allowed him to board a train unseen and have an entire carriage to himself, Merrick travelled to Northamptonshire to stay at Fawsley Hall, the estate of Lady Knightley. He stayed at the gamekeeper&#x27;s cottage and spent the days walking in the estate&#x27;s woods, collecting wild flowers. He befriended a young farm labourer who later recalled Merrick as an interesting and well-educated man. Treves called this &quot;the one supreme holiday of [Merrick&#x27;s] life&quot;, although in fact there were three such trips.

Merrick&#x27;s condition gradually deteriorated during his four years at the London Hospital. He required a great deal of care from the nursing staff and spent much of his time in bed, or sitting in his quarters, with diminishing energy. His facial deformities continued to grow and his head became more enlarged. He died on 11 April 1890, while sleeping, at the age of 27. At around 3:00 p.m. Treves&#x27;s house surgeon visited Merrick and found him lying dead across the bed. His body was formally identified by his uncle, Charles Merrick. An inquest was held on 27 April by Wynne Edwin Baxter, who had gained notoriety conducting inquests for the Whitechapel murders of 1888.

Merrick&#x27;s death was ruled accidental and the certified cause of death was asphyxia, resulting from the weight of his head as he lay down. After performing an autopsy, Treves determined that Merrick had died of a dislocated neck, which likely severed his vertebral arteries. Knowing that Merrick had always slept sitting upright out of necessity, Treves concluded that Merrick must have &quot;made the experiment&quot;, attempting to sleep lying down &quot;like other people&quot;.

Treves took plaster casts of Merrick&#x27;s head and limbs and dissected the body, taking skin samples and mounting the skeleton. Merrick&#x27;s soft tissue was buried in the City of London Cemetery, except for the skin samples, which were later lost during the Second World War. The skeleton is still included in the pathology collection of the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, which merged with the Medical College of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in 1995 to form the School of Medicine and Dentistry at London&#x27;s Queen Mary University. Merrick&#x27;s mounted skeleton is not on public display.

His skeletal remains are kept in a glass case in a private room at the university, and can be viewed by medical students and professionals by appointment &quot;[to] allow medical students to view and understand the physical deformities resulting from Joseph Merrick&#x27;s condition.&quot; Prior to the rediscovery of his soft-tissue grave in 2019, some had contended that since he was a devout Christian, at least Merrick&#x27;s skeletal remains should be given a Christian burial, in his home city of Leicester. However, the university intends to keep his skeleton at its medical school.

== Medical condition ==

Ever since Merrick&#x27;s days as a novelty exhibit on Whitechapel Road, his condition has remained a source of curiosity for medical professionals. His appearance at the meeting of the Pathological Society of London in 1884 drew interest from the doctors present, but gained neither the answers nor the wider attention that Treves had hoped for. The case received only a brief mention in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;, while the &quot;Lancet&quot; declined to mention it at all.

Four months later, in 1885, Treves brought the case before the meeting for a second time. By then, Tom Norman&#x27;s shop on Whitechapel Road had been closed down and Merrick had moved on, so in Merrick&#x27;s absence, Treves made do with the photographs he had taken during his examinations. One of the doctors present at the meeting was Henry Radcliffe Crocker, a dermatologist who was an authority on skin diseases. After hearing Treves&#x27;s description of Merrick, and viewing the photographs, Crocker proposed that Merrick&#x27;s condition might be a combination of pachydermatocele and an unnamed bone deformity, all caused by changes in the nervous system. Crocker wrote about Merrick&#x27;s case in his 1888 book &quot;Diseases of the Skin: their Description, Pathology, Diagnosis and Treatment&quot;.

In 1909, dermatologist Frederick Parkes Weber wrote an article in the &quot;British Journal of Dermatology&quot;, incorrectly citing Merrick as an example of von Recklinghausen Disease (neurofibromatosis), which German pathologist Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen had described in 1882. This conjecture has since been proved wrong; in fact, symptoms that are always present in this genetic disorder include tumours of the nervous tissue and bones, small warty growths on the skin, and the presence of light brown pigmentation on the skin called café au lait spots, which are of particular importance in diagnosing von Recklinghausen Disease, but which were never observed on Merrick&#x27;s body. For this reason, although the diagnosis was quite popular through most of the 20th century, other conjectural diagnoses were advanced, such as Maffucci syndrome and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (Albright&#x27;s disease).

In a 1986 article in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;, Michael Cohen and J. A. R. Tibbles put forward the hypothesis that Merrick had had Proteus syndrome, a very rare congenital disorder identified by Cohen in 1979, citing Merrick&#x27;s lack of reported café au lait spots and the absence of any histological proof of his having had the previously conjectured syndrome. In fact, Proteus syndrome affects tissue other than nerves, and is a sporadic disorder rather than a genetically transmitted disease. Cohen and Tibbles said Merrick showed the following signs of Proteus syndrome: &quot;macrocephaly; hyperostosis of the large skull; hypertrophy of long bones; and thickened skin and subcutaneous tissues, particularly of the hands and feet, including plantar hyperplasia, lipomas, and other unspecified subcutaneous masses&quot;.

In a letter to &quot;The Biologist&quot; in June 2001, British teacher and Chartered Biologist Paul Spiring speculated that Merrick might have had a combination of Proteus syndrome and neurofibromatosis. This hypothesis was reported by Robert Matthews, a correspondent for &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;. The possibility that Merrick may have had both conditions formed the basis for a 2003 documentary film entitled &quot;The Curse of The Elephant Man&quot;, which was produced for the Discovery Health Channel by Natural History New Zealand.

During 2002, genealogical research for the film led to a BBC appeal to trace Merrick&#x27;s maternal family line. In response to the appeal, a Leicester resident named Pat Selby was discovered to be the granddaughter of Merrick&#x27;s uncle, George Potterton. A research team took DNA samples from Selby in an unsuccessful attempt to diagnose Merrick&#x27;s condition. During 2003, the filmmakers commissioned further diagnostic tests using DNA from Merrick&#x27;s hair and bone, but the results of these tests proved inconclusive; therefore, the precise cause of Merrick&#x27;s medical condition remains uncertain.

In 1923, Treves published a volume, &quot;The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences&quot;, in which he detailed what he knew of Merrick&#x27;s life and his personal interactions with him. This account is the source of much of what is known about Merrick, but the book contained several inaccuracies. Merrick had never completely confided in Treves about his early life, so these details were consequently sketchy in Treves&#x27;s &quot;Reminiscences&quot;. A more mysterious error is that concerning Merrick&#x27;s first name; Treves, in his earlier journal articles as well as his book, persisted in calling him John Merrick. The reason for this is unknown, as Merrick clearly signed his name as &quot;Joseph&quot; in the examples of his handwriting that remain. In the handwritten manuscript for &quot;The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences&quot;, Treves began his account by writing &quot;Joseph&quot; and then crossed it out and replaced it with &quot;John&quot;. Whatever the reason for the discrepancy, it continued throughout much of the 20th century; later biographers have perpetuated the error, having based their work on Treves&#x27;s book.

Treves depicted Tom Norman, the showman who had exhibited Merrick on Whitechapel Road, as a cruel drunk who ruthlessly exploited his charge. In a letter to the &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; newspaper, and later in his own memoirs, Norman denied this characterisation and said he provided his show attractions with a means to earn a living, adding that Merrick was still on display while residing at the London Hospital, but with no way of controlling how or when he was viewed. According to Nadja Durbach, author of &quot;The Spectacle of Deformity: Freak Shows and Modern British Culture&quot; (2010), Norman&#x27;s view gives an insight into the Victorian freak show&#x27;s function as a survival mechanism for poor people with deformities, as well as the attitude of medical professionals of the time. Durbach cautions that the memoirs of both Treves and Norman must be understood as &quot;narrative reconstructions ... that reflect personal and professional prejudices and cater to the demands and expectations of their very different audiences&quot;.

In November 2016, Joanne Vigor-Mungovin published a book called &quot;Joseph: The Life, Times and Places of the Elephant Man&quot;, which included a foreword written by a member of Merrick&#x27;s family. The book looks into the early life of Merrick and his family in Vigor-Mungovin&#x27;s hometown of Leicester, with detailed information about Merrick&#x27;s family and his ambition to be self-sufficient rather than survive on the charity of others.

Anthropologist Ashley Montagu&#x27;s book, &quot;The Elephant Man: A Study in Human Dignity&quot; (1971), drew on Treves&#x27;s book and explored Merrick&#x27;s character. Montagu reprinted Treves&#x27;s account alongside various others, such as Carr Gomm&#x27;s letter to &quot;The Times&quot; in December 1886 and the report on Merrick&#x27;s inquest. He pointed out inconsistencies between the accounts and disputed some of Treves&#x27;s version of events; he noted, for example, that while Treves claimed Merrick knew nothing of his mother&#x27;s appearance, Carr Gomm mentions that Merrick carried a painting of his mother with him, and he criticised Treves&#x27;s assumption that Merrick&#x27;s mother was &quot;worthless and inhuman&quot;. However, Montagu also perpetuated some of the errors in Treves&#x27;s work, including his use of the name &quot;John&quot; rather than &quot;Joseph&quot;.

In 1980, Michael Howell and Peter Ford presented the findings of their detailed archival research in &quot;The True History of the Elephant Man&quot;, which revealed a large amount of new information about Merrick. Howell and Ford were able to provide a more detailed description of Merrick&#x27;s life story, also proving that his name was actually Joseph, not John. They refuted some of the inaccuracies in Treves&#x27;s account, showing that Merrick had not been abandoned by his mother, and that he had voluntarily chosen to exhibit himself to make a living.

Some persons remarked on Merrick&#x27;s strong Christian faith (Treves is also said to have been a Christian), and that his strong character and courage in the face of disabilities earned him admiration. Merrick&#x27;s life story has become the subject of several works of dramatic art, based on the accounts of Treves and Montagu. &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, a Tony Award-winning play by American playwright Bernard Pomerance, was staged in 1979. The character based on Merrick was initially played by David Schofield, and in subsequent productions by various actors including Philip Anglim, David Bowie, Bruce Davison, Mark Hamill and Bradley Cooper. A biographical film, also titled &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, was released in 1980; directed by David Lynch, it received eight Academy Award nominations. Merrick was played by John Hurt and Frederick Treves by Anthony Hopkins. In 1982, US television network ABC broadcast an adaptation of Pomerance&#x27;s play, starring Anglim.

In the 2001 film &quot;From Hell&quot;, Merrick, played by Anthony Parker, appears briefly.

American metal band Mastodon has three songs dedicated to Joseph Merrick - all of them are instrumental album closers: &quot;Elephant Man&quot; (from &quot;Remission&quot;, 2002), &quot;Joseph Merrick&quot; (from &quot;Leviathan&quot;, 2004), and &quot;Pendulous Skin&quot; (from &quot;Blood Mountain&quot;, 2006).

Merrick is portrayed by actor Joseph Drake in two episodes of the second series of the BBC historical crime drama &quot;Ripper Street&quot;, first broadcast in 2013. In 2017, the Malthouse Theatre, Melbourne, commissioned playwright Tom Wright to produce a play about Merrick&#x27;s life. &quot;The Real and Imagined History of the Elephant Man&quot; premiered on 4 August 2017, starring Daniel Monks in the title role. The cast also featured Paula Arundell, Julie Forsyth, Emma J. Hawkins, and Sophie Ross. The play toured the UK in 2023, directed by Stephen Bailey and starring Zak Ford-Williams as Merrick. This cast of this production included Annabelle Davies and Nadia Nadarajah, and off the back of this production, the play was published as a book.

It was announced in August 2018 that Charlie Heaton would be playing Merrick in a new two-part BBC drama, a decision that drew criticism from some quarters; instead of re-casting a disabled actor, the production was subsequently cancelled. In the 2019 sitcom &quot;Year of the Rabbit&quot;, Merrick was played by David Dawson as a pretentious theatrical type.

Merrick&#x27;s life is the subject of &quot;Joseph Merrick, The Elephant Man&quot;, an opera by composer Laurent Petitgirard, set to a French libretto by Eric Nonn. Starring contralto Jana Sykorova in the title role, it premiered on 7 February 2002 at the State Opera House, Prague.

<doc id="157809" wikidata="Q5335930" url="?curid=157809" title="Eddie Cicotte">
<text>Edward Victor Cicotte (; June 19, 1884 – May 5, 1969), nicknamed &quot;Knuckles&quot;, was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball best known for his time with the Chicago White Sox. He was one of eight players permanently ineligible for professional baseball for his alleged participation in the Black Sox scandal in the 1919 World Series, in which the favored White Sox lost to the Cincinnati Reds in eight games. The &quot;fixing&quot; of the 1919 World Series is the only recognized gambling scandal to tarnish a World Series.

==Family==

Cicotte was the son of Ambrose Cicotte and Archange Mary Drouillard, both of mainly French-Canadian extraction. He married Rose Ellen Freer, daughter of Russell John Freer and Annie Cecile Thornton, both of whom would later live with the Cicottes. They had two daughters, Rose and Virginia, and one son, Edward Jr.

==Career==
Cicotte was a starting pitcher and a knuckleball specialist who won 208 games and lost 149 over the course of a 14-year career pitching for the Detroit Tigers, Boston Red Sox, and Chicago White Sox. At the time of his lifetime ban, he was considered one of the premier pitchers in the American League.

A Detroit native, Cicotte played minor league baseball for the Augusta Tourists in Georgia in 1905, where he was a teammate of Ty Cobb. Both players were purchased by the Tigers, and Cicotte made his big-league debut on September 3, 1905. Pitching in three games for Detroit, Cicotte compiled a 1–1 record with a 3.50 earned run average.

Cicotte did not return to the major leagues again until 1908, when he resurfaced with the Red Sox. After he compiled a 41–48 record in a Boston uniform, the Red Sox sold him to the White Sox on July 22, 1912.

Cicotte celebrated a breakout year in 1913, going 18–11 on the season with an ERA of 1.58. He led the league in winning percentage in 1916, but his best year was 1917, when he won 28 games and led the league in wins, ERA, and innings pitched. On April 14 he threw a no hitter against the St. Louis Browns. From September 15, 1916, to July 25, 1917, Cicotte pitched 25 straight starts in which he allowed three earned runs or less with at least six innings pitched, which retroactively became known as the quality start. Cicotte&#x27;s 25 game streak was the most for a half-century until Bob Gibson passed him. That year, the White Sox went to the World Series, defeating the New York Giants 4 games to 2. Cicotte won Game 1, lost Game 3, and pitched six innings of relief in Game 5 for a no-decision.

Injuries reduced Cicotte to a 12–19 record in 1918, but in 1919, he rebounded to win 29 games and once again led the league in wins, winning percentage, and innings pitched, as well as in complete games. His 1919 salary was $6,000, but he had a provision for a $10,000 bonus if he won 30 games. Legend has it that as the season drew to a close, owner Charles Comiskey ordered manager Kid Gleason to bench Cicotte for 5 games, denying him a chance at a 30-win season and the bonus money.

==Scandal==

The book &quot;Eight Men Out&quot; by Eliot Asinof and the movie based on the book does record that Cicotte, despite being grossly underpaid for a pitcher of his ability, resisted repeated attempts by Chick Gandil to get him to throw the series until just days before the World Series opened when it became clear that Comiskey would never pay him even part of the promised bonus.

In the 1919 World Series against the Reds, Cicotte pitched in three games, winning one but pitching ineffectively and losing the other two.

Cicotte was the first of the eight players to come forward, signing a confession and a waiver of immunity. He later recanted this confession and was acquitted of all charges at trial by jury. Despite this, Cicotte and his alleged co-conspirators were subsequently made permanently ineligible for baseball by Kenesaw Mountain Landis, Major League Baseball&#x27;s new commissioner, recently hired to restore the integrity of the game in the wake of the 1919 scandal.

==Aftermath==
After being banned from playing baseball, Cicotte returned to Livonia, Michigan. He managed a service station, served as a game warden in the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, then went to work for Ford Motor Company, where he retired in 1944. Cicotte lived to be 84 years old. He was a strawberry farmer on a farm near Farmington until his death at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit on May 5, 1969.

In the 1988 film &quot;Eight Men Out&quot;, about the Black Sox scandal, Cicotte is portrayed by actor David Strathairn.

He was portrayed by actor Steve Eastin in the 1989 film &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;.

Cicotte&#x27;s grandnephew Al Cicotte (1929–1982) later pitched in the major leagues, compiling a lifetime 10–13 record with six teams between 1957 and 1962.

<text>A knuckleball or knuckler is a baseball pitch thrown to minimize the spin of the ball in flight, causing an erratic, unpredictable motion. The air flow over a seam of the ball causes the ball to change from laminar to turbulent flow. This change adds a deflecting force to the baseball, making it difficult for batters to hit but also difficult for pitchers to control and catchers to catch; umpires are challenged as well, as the ball&#x27;s irregular motion through the air makes it harder to call balls and strikes. A pitcher who throws knuckleballs is known as a knuckleballer.

==Origins==
The origins of the knuckleball are unclear. Toad Ramsey of the Louisville Colonels in the American Association—his pitch likely resembled the knuckle curve—and Eddie Cicotte of the Chicago White Sox, who in 1908 was nicknamed &quot;Knuckles&quot;, are two possible creators of the pitch. Other accounts attribute the pitch&#x27;s creation to Charles H. Druery, a pitcher in the Blue Ridge League. In 1917 Druery taught the pitch to Eddie Rommel, who became successful with it for the Philadelphia Athletics.

==Grip and motion==

As used by Cicotte, the knuckleball was originally thrown by holding the ball with the knuckles, hence the name of the pitch. Ed Summers, an Indianapolis teammate of Cicotte who adopted the pitch and helped develop it, modified it by holding the ball with his fingertips and using the thumb for balance, contrary to the misnomer that the ball is being held with the knuckles. This grip can also include digging the fingernails into the surface of the ball. The fingertip grip is more commonly used by modern knuckleball pitchers, like the Boston Red Sox pitcher Tim Wakefield, who had a knuckleball with a lot of movement. There are other prominent knuckleball pitchers like Hall of Famer Phil Niekro, who had a very effective knuckler and knuckle curve, and Cy Young Award winning pitcher R. A. Dickey. However, young pitchers with smaller hands tend to throw the knuckleball with their knuckles. Sometimes young players will throw the knuckleball with their knuckles flat against the ball, giving it less spin but also making it difficult to throw any significant distance.

Regardless of how the ball is gripped, the purpose of the knuckleball is to have the least possible amount of rotational spin. When thrown that way, the ball&#x27;s trajectory is significantly affected by variations in airflow caused by differences between the smooth surface of the ball and the stitching of its seams. The asymmetric drag that results tends to deflect the trajectory toward the side with the stitches.

Over the distance from the pitcher&#x27;s mound to home plate, the effect of these forces is that the knuckleball can flutter, dance, jiggle, or curve in two different directions during its flight. A pitch thrown entirely without spin is less desirable, however, than one with a very slight spin. If the ball completes between one-quarter and one-half a rotation on its way from the pitcher to the batter; the position of the stitches changes as the ball travels, affecting the drag that gives the ball its motion, thus making its flight erratic. Even a ball thrown without rotation will &quot;flutter&quot;, due to the &quot;apparent wind&quot; it feels as its trajectory changes throughout its flight path.

Hitting a knuckleball is different enough from other aspects of baseball that players specifically prepare for the pitch during batting practice before games they expect it in. According to physicist Robert Adair, due to the physiological limitation of human reaction time, a breaking knuckleball may be impossible to hit except by luck. If a knuckleball does not change direction in mid-flight, however, then it is easy to hit due to its lack of speed. (A common phrase for hitting a knuckleball is &quot;if it&#x27;s low, let it go; if it&#x27;s high, let it fly&quot;; meaning that a batter should attempt to hit a knuckleball only if it crosses the plate high in the strike zone due to lack of break.) Since it typically only travels , far slower than the average major league fastball , it can be hit very hard if there is no movement. One 2007 study offered evidence for this conclusion. To reduce the chances of having the knuckleball get hit for a home run, some pitchers will impart a slight topspin so that if no force causes the ball to dance, it will move downward in flight. Another drawback is that runners on base can usually advance more easily than if a conventional pitcher is on the mound. This is due to both the knuckleball&#x27;s low average speed and its erratic movement, which force the catcher to keep focusing on the ball even after the runners attempt to steal a base. However, since a typical major league starting rotation exceeds the length of a series against any one opponent, one way a manager can mitigate this disadvantage is to adjust his team&#x27;s pitching rotation so as to eliminate (or at least minimize) games in which a knuckleballer would pitch against teams with a preponderance of fast baserunners.

A paper presented at the 2012 Conference of the International Sports Engineering Association argues, based on PITCHf/x data, that knuckleballs do not make large and abrupt changes in their trajectories on the way to home plate—or at least, no more abrupt than a normal pitch. It speculates that the appearance of abrupt shifting may be due to the &quot;unpredictability&quot; of the changes in direction.

==Naming and relationship to other pitches==

Since it developed during a period when the spitball was legal and commonly used, and was similarly surprising in its motion, the knuckleball was sometimes called the &quot;dry spitter&quot;. Cicotte was widely reported to throw both the knuckleball and a variant on the spitball known as a &quot;shine ball&quot; (because he would &quot;shine&quot; one side of a dirty ball by rubbing it on his uniform). However, Cicotte called the shine ball &quot;a pure freak of the imagination&quot;, claiming that he did this to disconcert hitters and that the pitch was still a knuckleball.

Other names for the knuckleball have generally alluded to its motion and slower speed. These include the flutterball, the floater, the dancer, the butterfly ball (the name for the pitch used by French language game commentators employed by the Montreal Expos), the ghostball, and the bug.

The knuckle curve has a somewhat similar name because of the grip used to throw it (also with the knuckles or fingernails), but it is generally thrown harder and with spin. The resulting motion of the pitch more closely resembles a curveball, which explains the combination name. Toad Ramsey, a pitcher from 1885 to 1890, is credited in some later sources with being the first knuckleballer, apparently based primarily on accounts of how he gripped the ball; however, based on more contemporary descriptions of his pitch as an &quot;immense drop ball&quot;, it may be that his pitch was a form of knuckle curve. Two later pitchers, Jesse Haines and Freddie Fitzsimmons, were sometimes characterized as knuckleball pitchers even by their contemporaries, but in their cases it again refers to a harder-thrown, curving pitch that would probably not be called a knuckleball today. Historically, the term &quot;knuckle curve&quot; had a usage that was different from what it has in the game today. Many current pitchers throw a curveball using a grip with the index finger touching the ball with the knuckle or fingertip (also called a spike curve). This modern pitch is unrelated to the knuckleball.

==Physics==
The erratic movement of knuckleballs is of interest of study in the field of fluid dynamics. It is widely believed that the &quot;knuckling&quot; behavior is caused by laminar–turbulent transition, as the Reynolds number of most knuckleballs is usually near the critical Reynolds number for spherical objects.

The seams of a baseball have been shown to affect the separation of the boundary layer of air around a baseball, contributing to knuckleball movement. However, &quot;knuckling&quot; behavior has also been observed in perfectly-spherical and smooth steel beads.

==Rarity==
, only about 70 Major League Baseball pitchers have regularly used the knuckleball during their careers, and its use has become rarer over time. This can be attributed to a variety of factors. The first is selection bias in scouting. Because the speed of any prospect&#x27;s pitch is one of the quickest and easiest metrics in judging the skill of the prospect, the knuckleball, which is thrown slower than any other pitch, gets overlooked. Tim Wakefield argued that &quot;The problem is that [baseball] is so radar gun-oriented.&quot; Former knuckleballer and pitching coach Charlie Hough says that the increased rarity of the knuckleball is due to scouts increasingly looking only for the best arm. This effect is increasing over time as the modern game continues to emphasize power in pitching and average pitch speed increases.

Hoyt Wilhelm, Phil Niekro, and Jesse Haines, three pitchers who primarily relied on the knuckleball, have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Additionally, Ted Lyons, another member of the Hall of Fame, relied heavily on the knuckleball after injuring his arm in 1931. Niekro was given the nickname &quot;Knucksie&quot; during his career. Other prominent knuckleball pitchers have included Joe Niekro (Phil&#x27;s brother), Charlie Hough, Dave Jolly, Ben Flowers, Wilbur Wood, Barney Schultz, Tom Candiotti, Bob Purkey, Steve Sparks, Eddie Rommel, Tim Wakefield, Steven Wright, and R. A. Dickey. During the 1945 season, with talent depleted by call-ups to fight in World War II, the Washington Senators had a pitching rotation which included four knuckleball pitchers (Dutch Leonard, Johnny Niggeling, Mickey &quot;Itsy Bitsy&quot; Haefner, and Roger Wolff) who combined for 60 complete games and 60 wins, carrying the Senators to second place. Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Gibson said he threw a knuckleball in practice, and that one time in a game he used it to get Hank Aaron out.

In November 2008, it was announced that 16-year-old knuckleballer Eri Yoshida was drafted as the first woman ever to play in Japanese professional baseball for the Kobe 9 Cruise of the Kansai Independent Baseball League. On March 2, 2010, she trained with Tim Wakefield at the Boston Red Sox minor-league training facility. And on April 8, 2010, she signed with the Chico Outlaws, debuting on May 29, 2010.

Another factor contributing to the rarity of the knuckleball is the difficulty of throwing it. R. A. Dickey estimates that it takes at least a year to grasp its fundamentals. The knuckleball is radically different from any other pitch in a pitcher&#x27;s arsenal, being less predictable and difficult to control. It is for this reason that the knuckleball is widely regarded as unreliable, and knuckleball pitchers are prone to extended slumps, such as when Tim Wakefield was released from the Pirates in a mid-career slump during spring training in 1995. Another reason for the difficulty of the knuckleball is due to the network effect. Because there are so few knuckleball pitchers, the resources for learning and improving the knuckleball are few compared to more common pitches. Pitching coaches often struggle with knuckleball pitchers due to a lack of experience with the pitch. &quot;I think the hardest thing for me is just the alone-ness that you feel sometimes because nobody else really does it,&quot; said Wakefield.

Coaches have also been seen as a barrier to succeeding with the knuckleball. Jim Bouton said, &quot;coaches don&#x27;t respect it. You can pitch seven good innings with a knuckleball, and as soon as you walk a guy they go, &#x27;See, there&#x27;s that damn knuckleball. R. A. Dickey argues that, &quot;for most managers, it takes a special manager to be able to really trust it—the bad and the good of it. Coaches are quick to banish the pitch after one bad outing. This was common due to the amount of practice one must put into the pitch. And traditionally, if you look at Tim Wakefield, Joe and Phil Niekro, Tom Candiotti, Wilbur Wood, Hoyt Wilhelm and all the guys that threw it, through their success they had guys who really believed in what it could do long-term and committed to giving them the ball every fifth day to do it.&quot;

In 1991, Hall of Fame catcher Rick Ferrell was quoted as saying, &quot;I think the knuckleball is fading out.&quot; Ferrell knew knuckleballs: he had the task of being the Washington Senators catcher in 1944–45, when the Senators had four knuckleball pitchers in their starting rotation. Furthermore, other factors, such as a dearth of knuckleball teachers and the dramatic increase in the running game—base stealing is often easier against knuckleball pitchers—may be contributing to its demise.

Perhaps as a result, knuckleball pitchers often view themselves as members of an exclusive club, with its own uniform number (49, first worn by Wilhelm) and leader (Phil Niekro, whom &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2004 called &quot;the undisputed Grand Poobah&quot; of the group after Wilhelm&#x27;s death). Because they cannot discuss pitching with non knuckleball-using teammates, they often share tips and insights even if on competing teams, and believe that they have a responsibility to help younger players develop the pitch. When, in 2012, R. A. Dickey became the first Cy Young Award-winning knuckleball pitcher, he called the award &quot;a victory for … the knuckleball fraternity&quot;, and of the dozens of phone calls he received after the announcement, Niekro&#x27;s was the only one he answered.

When originally developed, the knuckleball was used by a number of pitchers as simply one pitch in their repertoire, usually as part of changing speeds from their fastball. It is almost never used in a mixed repertoire today, however, and some believe that to throw the knuckleball effectively with some semblance of control over the pitch, one must throw it more or less exclusively. At the same time, pitchers rarely focus on the knuckleball if they have reasonable skill with more standard pitches. Unlike conventional pitches, which perform fast results without much exertion, a knuckleball pitcher must train his body and muscle memory to be able to execute a 65 mph pitch with less than one rotation.

On June 24, 2023, the San Diego Padres called up Matt Waldron to start against the Washington Nationals; this makes him the most recent and only active knuckleballer in Major League Baseball. Prior to Waldron, Steven Wright of the Boston Red Sox was considered to be the last active knuckleballer in the MLB; he has since been released from the team. Mickey Jannis, prior player of the Baltimore Orioles organization, also throws the knuckleball, and made his major league debut on June 23, 2021.

Among position players making pitching appearances, those who have utilized the knuckleball include Wade Boggs, Danny Worth, Alex Blandino, and Ernie Clement.

On October 1, 2023, pitcher George Kirby of the Seattle Mariners threw his first knuckleball in an MLB game, drawing a swing and miss from the Texas Rangers&#x27; Corey Seager. After the game, Kirby confirmed that he chose this day to debut the pitch as a tribute to Boston Red Sox knuckleballer and World Series champion Tim Wakefield, who had died that morning.

==Use in pitching==
The knuckleball does provide some advantages to its practitioners. It does not need to be thrown hard (in fact, throwing too hard may diminish its effectiveness), and is therefore less taxing on the arm. Knuckleball pitchers can throw more innings than other pitchers, and, requiring less time to recover after pitching, can pitch more frequently. The lower physical strain also fosters longer careers. Some knuckleballers have continued to pitch professionally well into their forties: Tim Wakefield, Hoyt Wilhelm, R. A. Dickey, Charlie Hough, Tom Candiotti, and the brothers Phil Niekro and Joe Niekro.

Pitchers like Bouton have found success as knuckleballers after their ability to throw hard declined. Bouton&#x27;s famous best-selling book &quot;Ball Four&quot; (1970), while scandalous at the time for its unvarnished and often uncomplimentary portrayal of player behavior and coaching small-mindedness, is primarily about trying to stay in the major leagues as a knuckleball pitcher.

==Catching==

As with hitters, the unpredictable motion of the knuckleball makes it one of the most difficult pitches for catchers to handle, and they tend to be charged with a significantly higher number of passed balls. Former catcher Bob Uecker, who caught for Phil Niekro, said, &quot;The way to catch a knuckleball is to wait until it stops rolling and pick it up.&quot; Bouton said, &quot;Catchers hate it. Nobody likes to warm up with you.&quot; According to Adair, the 150 ms minimum human reaction time may be too slow to adjust to a knuckleball&#x27;s changing direction.

A team will sometimes employ a catcher solely for games started by a knuckleballer. The &quot;knuckleball catcher&quot; is equipped with an oversized knuckleball catcher&#x27;s mitt, similar to a first baseman&#x27;s glove; Doug Mirabelli, formerly of the Red Sox, used a softball catcher&#x27;s mitt. The Boston Red Sox, in their 2004 world championship season, had Mirabelli regularly catching in place of Jason Varitek when Tim Wakefield was pitching. This use of a &quot;specialist&quot; catcher continued into the 2008 season following the signing of Kevin Cash, and 2009 saw George Kottaras fulfill this role. On August 26, the first time Victor Martinez caught Wakefield, he used a first baseman&#x27;s glove, instead of a regular catcher&#x27;s mitt. For a catcher, a key disadvantage to using a first baseman&#x27;s glove mitt is that they are not designed for easy extraction of the ball from the glove, making it harder to prevent baserunners from stealing.

On occasion, teams have traded knuckleball pitchers and their catchers in the same transaction. In baseball terminology the pitcher and catcher together are known as a &quot;battery&quot;, and having a catcher experienced in catching a knuckleball pitcher is preferable, so the trade of pitcher and catcher together is sometimes referred to as a &quot;batteries included&quot; trade. For example, Josh Thole and Mike Nickeas went with Dickey when the pitcher was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays in late 2012, and the team later signed Henry Blanco, who also caught for Dickey.

The record for passed balls in an inning (4) was first set by Ray Katt of the New York Giants in 1954, catching Hoyt Wilhelm. It was tied by Geno Petralli of the Texas Rangers in 1987 while trying to catch knuckleball pitcher Charlie Hough, and tied again in 2013 when Ryan Lavarnway of the Boston Red Sox had four in the first inning, catching knuckleballer Steven Wright in Wright&#x27;s first major league start.

Varitek holds the postseason record with three passed balls in the 13th inning of Game 5 of the 2004 American League Championship Series while catching Wakefield.

In 2013, J. P. Arencibia set a Toronto Blue Jays franchise record by allowing four passed balls in the season opener (a 4–2 loss) while catching for knuckleballer R. A. Dickey. He never caught for Dickey again.

==Use in other sports==
===Cricket===

The knuckleball is also employed by cricket fast bowlers Zaheer Khan, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Andrew Tye as their slower delivery. The physics of the operation are largely the same. However, the seam on a cricket ball is equatorial, and thus the extent of erratic movement is reduced due to the symmetry (at least in the conventional release position where the planes of the ball&#x27;s trajectory and the seam are nearly co-planar). In addition, the lack of backspin does shorten the length of the delivery, and also tends to make the ball skid off the pitch—faster than it would come off a normal delivery.

===Volleyball===
In volleyball, the float serve involves hitting the volleyball in such a way to minimize the rotation of the ball, causing unpredictability in the ball&#x27;s movement. When done correctly, the float serve is hard for opponents to predict where the ball will end up, thus rendering it hard to pass.

===Association football===
In association football (soccer), the method of striking the ball so that it produces almost no spinning motion during its flight has been colloquially described as &quot;knuckleballing&quot; by commentators, due to the ball&#x27;s motion that resembles a baseball thrown with a knuckleball pitch. This shooting technique is frequently used by players for long-range shots and free kicks. A successful knuckleball shot will move, dip, or wobble in the air unpredictably, making it difficult for the goalkeeper to save. This technique has also been described as the &quot;dry leaf&quot; or &quot;dead leaf&quot; ( in Portuguese), the &quot;tomahawk&quot;, or even &quot;the accursed&quot; ( in Italian).

One of the main proponents of this shooting technique was Brazilian playmaker Juninho Pernambucano, who popularised it in particular during his time with Lyon in the mid 2000s; however, it is commonly thought to have been invented by compatriot Didi, although Italian forward Giuseppe Meazza before him is also credited with using the technique. This technique has also been used and even adapted by several other players, such as Andrea Pirlo, Ronaldinho, Cristiano Ronaldo, Didier Drogba, Marcus Rashford, Gareth Bale, and Barbara Bonansea.

===American football===
In American football, a knuckleball is occasionally employed by punters. Chris Gardocki achieved a knuckleball effect by punting towards the left sideline with his left foot, leading to unpredictable results. Sam Koch developed the technique further, kicking the football at an angle to reduce spin. Koch would often aim his knucklers towards the middle of the field in an attempt to bait the returner into trying to catch the ball. Because of the unpredictable nature of a knuckler, this could lead the returner to muff the punt and cause a turnover. A knuckleball may also be used to describe a kick by a kicker, either field goals or extra points, if the ball is not hit well.

<doc id="157814" wikidata="Q179591" url="?curid=157814" title="Battle of Cannae">
<text>The Battle of Cannae (; ) was a key engagement of the Second Punic War between the Roman Republic and Carthage, fought on 2 August 216 BC near the ancient village of Cannae in Apulia, southeast Italy. The Carthaginians and their allies, led by Hannibal, surrounded and practically annihilated a larger Roman and Italian army under the consuls Lucius Aemilius Paullus and Gaius Terentius Varro. It is regarded as one of the greatest tactical feats in military history and one of the worst defeats in Roman history, and it cemented Hannibal&#x27;s reputation as one of antiquity&#x27;s greatest tacticians.

Having recovered from their losses at Trebia (218 BC) and Lake Trasimene (217 BC), the Romans decided to engage Hannibal at Cannae, with approximately 86,000 Roman and allied troops. They massed their heavy infantry in a deeper formation than usual, while Hannibal used the double envelopment tactic and surrounded his enemy, trapping the majority of the Roman army, who were then slaughtered. The loss of life on the Roman side meant it was one of the most lethal single days of fighting in history; Adrian Goldsworthy equates the death toll at Cannae to &quot;the massed slaughter of the British Army on the first day of the Somme offensive in 1916&quot;. Only about 15,000 Romans, most of whom were from the garrisons of the camps and had not taken part in the battle, escaped death. Following the defeat, Capua and several other Italian city-states defected from the Roman Republic to Carthage.

As news of this defeat reached Rome, the city was gripped in panic. Authorities resorted to extraordinary measures, which included consulting the Sibylline Books, dispatching a delegation led by Quintus Fabius Pictor to consult the Delphic oracle in Greece, and burying four people alive as a sacrifice to their gods. To raise two new legions, the authorities lowered the draft age and enlisted criminals, debtors and even slaves. Despite the extreme loss of men and equipment, and a second massive defeat later that same year at Silva Litana, the Romans refused to surrender to Hannibal. His offer to ransom survivors was brusquely refused. The Romans fought for 14 more years until they achieved victory at the Battle of Zama.

== Strategic background ==
Shortly after the start of the Second Punic War, Hannibal crossed into Italy by traversing the Pyrenees and the Alps during the summer and early autumn of 218 BC. He quickly won major victories over the Romans at Trebia and at Lake Trasimene. After these losses, the Romans appointed Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus as dictator to deal with the threat.

Fabius used attrition warfare against Hannibal, cutting off his supply lines and avoiding pitched battles. These tactics proved unpopular with the Romans who, as they recovered from the shock of Hannibal&#x27;s victories, began to question the wisdom of the Fabian strategy, which had given the Carthaginian army a chance to regroup. The majority of Romans were eager to see a quick conclusion to the war. It was feared that, if Hannibal continued plundering Italy unopposed, Rome&#x27;s allies might defect to the Carthaginian side for self-preservation.
Therefore, when Fabius came to the end of his term, the Senate did not renew his dictatorial powers and command was given to consuls Gnaeus Servilius Geminus and Marcus Atilius Regulus. In 216 BC, when elections resumed, Gaius Terentius Varro and Lucius Aemilius Paullus were elected as consuls, placed in command of a newly raised army of unprecedented size and directed to engage Hannibal. Polybius wrote:

=== Estimates of Roman troop numbers ===
Rome typically employed four legions each year, each consisting of 4,000 foot soldiers and 200 cavalry. Per contemporary Roman sources, for the first time ever the Senate introduced eight legions, each consisting of 5,000 foot soldiers and 300 cavalry, with allied troops numbering the same number of foot soldiers but 900 cavalry per legion—more than triple the legion numbers. Eight legions—some 40,000 Roman soldiers and an estimated 2,400 cavalry—formed the core of this massive new army. Livy quotes one source stating the Romans added only 10,000 men to their usual army.

== Roman command ==
The two consuls were each assigned two of the four legions to command, unusually employing all four legions at once on the same assignment. However, the Senate feared a real threat, and deployed not just four legions to the field but all eight, including allies. Ordinarily, each of the two consuls would command his own portion of the army, but since the two armies were combined into one, Roman law required them to alternate their command on a daily basis.

The traditional account puts Varro in command on the day of the battle, and much of the blame for the defeat has been laid on his shoulders. His low origins seem to be exaggerated in the sources, and Varro may have been made a scapegoat by the aristocratic establishment. He lacked the powerful descendants that Paullus had, descendants who were willing and able to protect his reputation—most notably his grandson Scipio Aemilianus, the patron of Polybius, one of the main sources of this history.

== Prelude ==
In the spring of 216 BC, Hannibal took the initiative and seized the large supply depot at Cannae, in the Apulian plain, placing himself between the Romans and their crucial source of supply. As Polybius noted, the capture of Cannae &quot;caused great commotion in the Roman army; for it was not only the loss of the place and the stores in it that distressed them, but the fact that it commanded the surrounding district&quot;. The consuls, resolving to confront Hannibal, marched southward in search of him. After two days&#x27; march, they found him on the left bank of the river Aufidus, and encamped away.

Varro, in command on the first day, is presented by contemporary sources as a man of reckless nature and hubris, who was determined to defeat Hannibal. As the Romans approached Cannae, some of Hannibal&#x27;s light infantry and cavalry ambushed them. Varro repelled the attack and continued slowly on his way to Cannae. This victory, though essentially a mere skirmish with no lasting strategic value, greatly bolstered the confidence of the Roman army, perhaps leading to overconfidence on Varro&#x27;s part.

Paullus was opposed to the engagement as it was taking shape. Unlike Varro, he was prudent and cautious, and he believed it was foolish to fight on open ground, despite the Romans&#x27; numerical strength. This was especially true since Hannibal held the advantage in cavalry, in both quality and quantity. Despite these misgivings, Paullus thought it unwise to withdraw the army after the initial success, and camped two-thirds of the army east of the river Aufidus, sending the remainder to fortify a position on the opposite side, away from the main camp. The purpose of this second camp was to cover the foraging parties from the main camp and harass those of the enemy.

The two armies stayed in their respective locations for two days. During the second day (August 1) Hannibal, aware that Varro would be in command the following day, left his camp and offered battle, but Paullus refused. When his request was rejected, Hannibal, recognizing the importance of water from the Aufidus to the Roman troops, sent his cavalry to the smaller Roman camp to harass water-bearing soldiers that were found outside the camp fortifications. According to Polybius, Hannibal&#x27;s cavalry boldly rode up to the edge of the Roman encampment, causing havoc and thoroughly disrupting the supply of water to the Roman camp.

On the morning of the battle, as the forces drew up, a Carthaginian officer named Gisgo reportedly remarked to Hannibal that the size of the Roman army was astonishing. &quot;There is one thing, Gisgo, yet more astonishing&quot;, Hannibal coolly replied, &quot;which you take no notice of.&quot; He then explained, &quot;In all those great numbers before us, there is not one man called Gisgo&quot;, provoking laughter that spread through the Carthaginian ranks.

Appian and Livy say Hannibal sent a small contingent of 500–600 mercenaries to pretend to desert to the Roman side. Those men, Celtiberians according to Appian and Numidians according to Livy, handed their weapons to the Romans as a sign of good will while retaining hidden short swords in their clothes. Once the battle started, following Hannibal&#x27;s plans, the mercenaries attacked, stealing weapons and shields from their victims and causing chaos and confusion in the Roman camp. However, the veracity of this part is disputed.

== Date ==
Ancient historians rarely provide the precise dates for the events they describe. For example, Livy provides no explicit dates for any of the battles of the Second Punic War. Macrobius, citing the Roman annalist Quintus Claudius Quadrigarius, states the battle was fought , or 2 August.

The months of the pre-Julian Roman calendar are known not to correspond to its namesake Julian day. For example, Livy records a lunar eclipse in 168 BC as occurring on 4 September, when astronomical calculations show it happened on Julian day 21 June of that year. This discrepancy arose from the failure of the pontifices to properly perform intercalations, either by accident or for political advantage. A review of the evidence led P. S. Derow to identify the equivalent Julian date as 1 July 216 BC. Other authorities have suggested other Julian dates.

== Armies ==
Figures for troops involved in ancient battles are often unreliable, and Cannae is no exception. They should be treated with caution, especially those for the Carthaginian side. The Carthaginian army was a combination of warriors from numerous regions, and may have numbered between 40,000 and 50,000. Their infantry comprised an estimated 8,000 Libyans, 5,500 Gaetulian, 16,000 Gauls, mainly Boii and Insubres (8,000 were left at camp the day of battle) and 8,000 of several tribes of Hispania, including Iberians, Celtiberians and Lusitanians.

Hannibal&#x27;s cavalry also came from diverse backgrounds. He commanded 4,000 Numidian, 2,000 Iberian peninsular, 4,000 Gallic and 450 Libyan-Phoenician cavalry. Hannibal had an auxiliary skirmisher contingent consisting of 1,000–2,000 Balearic slingers and 6,000 mixed-nationality javelinmen, possibly including Lusitanians among them. The uniting factor for the Carthaginian army was the personal tie each group had with Hannibal.

== Equipment ==
Rome&#x27;s forces used typical Roman equipment including (heavy javelins) and (thrusting spears) as weapons as well as traditional bronze helmets, bodyshields and body armor. In contrast, the Carthaginian army used a variety of equipment. The Iberians fought with , while Celtiberians and Lusitanians used straight , as well as javelins and various types of spears. For defense, warriors from Hispania carried large oval shields and often wore a crested helmet made of animal sinews. Most Gallic foot warriors likely had no protection other than large shields, and the typical Gallic weapon was a long slashing sword.

The Numidian cavalry were very lightly equipped, lacking saddles and bridles for their horses, and wearing no armor but carrying small shields, javelins and possibly a knife or a longer blade. In contrast, the heavier Iberian peninsular cavalry carried round shields, swords, javelins and thrusting spears. The similarly heavy Gallic cavalry added the four-horned saddle, with the wealthier ones being clad in mail, a Gallic invention.

Skirmishers acting as light infantry carried either slings or javelins. The Balearic slingers, who were famous for their accuracy, carried short, medium and long slings used to cast stones or bullets. They may have carried a small shield or simple leather pelt on their arms, but this is uncertain. Hannibal himself, like many Roman officers on the opposing side, might have been wearing a bronze and carrying a as his personal sidearm.

The equipment of the Libyan line infantry has been much debated. Duncan Head has argued in favor of short stabbing spears. Polybius states that the Libyans fought with equipment taken from previously defeated Romans. It is unclear whether he meant only shields and armor or offensive weapons as well, though a general reading suggests he meant the whole panoply of arms and armor, and even tactical organization. Apart from his description of the battle itself, when later discussing the subject of the Roman legion versus the Greek phalanx, Polybius says that &quot;...against Hannibal, the defeats they suffered had nothing to do with weapons or formations&quot; because &quot;Hannibal himself... discarded the equipment with which he had started out [and] armed his troops with Roman weapons&quot;.

Gregory Daly is inclined to the view that Libyan infantry would have copied the Iberian use of the sword during their fighting there and so were armed similarly to the Romans. Peter Connolly has argued that they were armed as a pike phalanx. This has been disputed by Head, because Plutarch states they carried spears shorter than the Roman and by Daly because they could not have carried an unwieldy pike at the same time as a heavy Roman-style shield.

== Tactical deployment ==
The conventional deployment for armies of the time was placement of infantry in the center, with the cavalry in two flanking wings. The Romans followed this convention fairly closely, but chose extra depth rather than breadth for the infantry in hopes of breaking quickly through the center of Hannibal&#x27;s line. Varro knew how the Roman infantry had managed to penetrate Hannibal&#x27;s center at Trebia, and he planned to recreate this on an even greater scale. The were stationed immediately behind the , ready to push forward at first contact to ensure the Romans presented a unified front. As Polybius wrote, &quot;the maniples were nearer each other, or the intervals were decreased... and the maniples showed more depth than front&quot;.

Even though they outnumbered the Carthaginians, this depth-oriented deployment meant that the Roman lines had a front of roughly equal size to their numerically inferior opponents. The typical style of Roman warfare was to continuously push with the infantry in the center and attempt to overpower the enemy line. Despite what these tactics might suggest, the center was not commanded by either of the two consuls, but by Geminus Servilius. The consuls commanded the two wings, Terentius Varro the left and Aemilius Paullus the right. Hannibal understood that the Romans fought their battles like this, and he took his outnumbered army and strategically placed them around the enemy to win a tactical victory.
Hannibal had deployed his forces based on the particular fighting qualities of each unit, taking into consideration both their strengths and weaknesses. This aspect of Hannibal&#x27;s leadership was highlighted in the use of a Spanish unit, the Balearic slingers, whom he placed behind the infantry to hurl their ranged missiles into the masses of Roman troops. He placed his Iberians, Celtiberians and Gauls in the middle, alternating the ethnic composition between Hispanics and Gauls across the front line, with himself at the front and center alongside his brother Mago.

Roman sources claim their placement was chosen for being the most expendable and unreliable troops, but modern reflections believe those forces were actually selected for their battle-hardening to carry the weight of the Punic side, as they would be tasked with the controlled retreat that ultimately made possible Hannibal&#x27;s pincer movement. Meanwhile, infantry from Punic Africa was on the wings at the very edge of his infantry line. This infantry would remain cohesive and attack the Roman flanks.

Hasdrubal led the Hispanic and Gallic cavalry on the left (south near the river Aufidus) of the Carthaginian army. By placing the flank of his army on the Aufidus, Hannibal prevented this flank from being overlapped by the more numerous Romans. Hasdrubal was given 6,000–7,000 cavalry, and Hanno had 3,000–4,000 Numidians on the right.

Hannibal intended that his cavalry, comprising mainly medium Hispanic cavalry and Numidian light horse, and positioned on the flanks, would defeat the weaker Roman cavalry and swing around to attack the Roman infantry from the rear as it pressed upon Hannibal&#x27;s weakened center. His veteran African troops would then press in from the flanks at the crucial moment, and encircle the overextended Romans.

The Romans were in front of the hill leading to Cannae and hemmed in on their right flank by the river Aufidus, so that their left flank was the only viable means of retreat. In addition, the Carthaginian forces had maneuvered so that the Romans would face east. Not only would the morning sun shine low into the Romans&#x27; eyes, but the southeasterly winds would blow sand and dust into their faces as they approached the battlefield. Hannibal&#x27;s deployment of his army, based on his perception of the terrain and understanding of the capabilities of his troops, proved decisive.

== Battle ==

As the armies advanced on one another, Hannibal gradually extended the center of his line, as Polybius described: &quot;After thus drawing up his whole army in a straight line, he took the central companies of Hispanics and Celts and advanced with them, keeping the rest of them in contact with these companies, but gradually falling off, so as to produce a crescent-shaped formation, the line of the flanking companies growing thinner as it was prolonged, his object being to employ the Africans as a reserve force and to begin the action with the Hispanics and Celts.&quot; Polybius described the weak Carthaginian center as deployed in a crescent, curving out toward the Romans in the middle with the African troops on their flanks in echelon formation.

It is believed that the purpose of this formation was to break the forward momentum of the Roman infantry, and delay its advance before other developments allowed Hannibal to deploy his African infantry most effectively. While the majority of historians feel that Hannibal&#x27;s action was deliberate, some have called this account fanciful, and claim that the actions of the day represent either the natural curvature that occurs when a broad front of infantry marches forward, or the bending back of the Carthaginian center from the shock action of meeting the heavily massed Roman center.

The battle began with a fierce cavalry engagement on the flanks. Polybius described many of the Hispanic and Celtic horsemen facing the Romans dismounting due to the lack of space to fight on horseback, and called the struggle &quot;barbaric&quot; in the sense of its utter brutality. When the Carthaginian cavalry got the upper hand, they cut down their Roman opponents without giving quarter. On the other flank the Numidians engaged in a way that merely kept the Roman allied cavalry occupied. Hasdrubal kept his victorious Hispanic and Gallic cavalry under control and did not chase the retreating Roman right wing. Instead, he led them to the other side of the field to attack the socii cavalry still fighting the Numidians. Assailed from both sides, the allied cavalry broke before Hasdrubal could charge into contact and the Numidians pursued them off the field.

While the Carthaginian cavalry were in the process of defeating the Roman horsemen, the masses of infantry on both sides advanced towards each other in the center of the field. The wind from the east blew dust in the Romans&#x27; faces and obscured their vision. While the wind was not a major factor, the dust that both armies created would have been potentially debilitating to sight. Although it made seeing difficult, troops would still have been able to see others in the vicinity.

The dust was not the only psychological factor involved in battle. Because of the somewhat distant battle location, both sides were forced to fight on little sleep. Another Roman disadvantage was thirst caused by Hannibal&#x27;s attack on the Roman encampment during the previous day. Furthermore, the massive number of troops would have led to an overwhelming amount of background noise. All of these psychological factors made battle especially difficult for the infantrymen.

The light infantry on both sides engaged in indecisive skirmishing, inflicting few casualties and quickly withdrawing through the ranks of their heavy infantry. As the Roman heavy infantry attacked, Hannibal stood with his men in the weak center and held them together in a controlled retreat. The crescent of Hispanic and Gallic troops buckled inwards as they gradually withdrew step by step. Knowing the superiority of the Roman infantry, Hannibal had instructed his infantry to withdraw deliberately, creating an even tighter envelopment around the attacking Roman forces. By doing so, he had turned the strength of the Roman infantry into a weakness. While the front ranks were gradually advancing, the bulk of the Roman troops began to lose their cohesion, as troops from the reserve lines advanced into the growing gaps.

Soon they were compacted together so closely that they had little space to wield their weapons. In pressing so far forward in their desire to destroy the retreating and seemingly collapsing line of Hispanic and Gallic troops, the Romans had ignored (possibly due to the dust) the African troops that stood uncommitted on the projecting ends of this now-reversed crescent.

This also gave the Carthaginian cavalry time to drive the Roman cavalry off on both flanks and attack the Roman center in the rear. The Roman infantry, now stripped of protection on both its flanks, formed a wedge that drove deeper and deeper into the Carthaginian semicircle, driving itself into an alley formed by the African infantry on the wings. At this decisive point, Hannibal ordered his African infantry to turn inwards and advance against the Roman flanks, creating an encirclement in one of the earliest known examples of a pincer movement.

When the Carthaginian cavalry attacked the Romans in the rear and the African flanking echelons assailed them on their right and left, the advance of the Roman infantry was brought to an abrupt halt. The Romans were henceforth enclosed in a pocket with no means of escape. The Carthaginians created a wall and began to systematically massacre them. Polybius wrote: &quot;as their outer ranks were continually cut down, and the survivors forced to pull back and huddle together, they were finally all killed where they stood.&quot;

As Livy described, &quot;So many thousands of Romans were dying... Some, whom their wounds, pinched by the morning cold, had roused, as they were rising up, covered with blood, from the midst of the heaps of slain, were overpowered by the enemy. Some were found with their heads plunged into the earth, which they had excavated; having thus, as it appeared, made pits for themselves, and having suffocated themselves.&quot; Victor Davis Hanson claims that nearly six hundred legionaries were slaughtered each minute until darkness brought an end to the bloodletting. Only 14,000 Roman troops managed to escape, including Scipio Africanus, who managed to escape the encirclement with 500 men, most of whom had cut their way through to the nearby town of Canusium.

== Casualties ==
=== Roman ===
Polybius writes that of the Roman and allied infantry, 70,000 were killed, 10,000 captured, and &quot;perhaps&quot; 3,000 survived. He also reports that of the 6,000 Roman and allied cavalry, only 370 survived.

Livy wrote, &quot;Forty-five thousand and five hundred foot, two thousand seven hundred horse, there being an equal number of citizens and allies, are said to have been slain.&quot; He also reports that 3,000 Roman and allied infantry and 1,500 Roman and allied cavalry were taken prisoner by the Carthaginians. Another 2,000 Roman fugitives were rounded up at the unfortified village of Cannae by Carthaginian cavalry commanded by Carthalo, 7,000 fell prisoner in the smaller Roman camp and 5,800 in the larger. Although Livy does not cite his source by name, it is likely to have been Quintus Fabius Pictor, a Roman historian who fought in and wrote about the Second Punic War. It is Pictor whom Livy names when reporting the casualties at the Battle of Trebia.

In addition to the consul Paullus, Livy recorded that among the dead were 2 quaestors, 29 of the 48 military tribunes, some of consular rank, including the consul of the previous year, Gnaeus Servilius Geminus, and the former , Marcus Minucius Rufus, and 80 &quot;senators or men who had held offices which would have given them the right to be elected to the Senate&quot;.

Later Roman and Greco-Roman historians largely follow Livy&#x27;s figures. Appian gave 50,000 killed and &quot;a great many&quot; taken prisoner. Plutarch agreed, &quot;50,000 Romans fell in that battle... 4,000 were taken alive in the field and 10,000 in the camps of both consuls&quot;. Quintilian: &quot;60,000 men were slain by Hannibal at Cannae&quot;. Eutropius: &quot;20 officers of consular and praetorian rank, 30 senators, and 300 others of noble descent, were taken or slain, as well as 40,000-foot-soldiers, and 3,500 horse&quot;.

Some modern historians, while rejecting Polybius&#x27;s figure as flawed, are willing to accept Livy&#x27;s figure. Other historians have come up with far lower estimates. In 1891, Cantalupi proposed Roman losses of 10,500 to 16,000. Samuels in 1990 also regarded Livy&#x27;s figure as far too high, on the grounds that the cavalry would have been inadequate to prevent the Roman infantry escaping to the rear. He doubts that Hannibal even wanted a high death toll, as much of the army consisted of Italians whom Hannibal hoped to win as allies. Micheal Clodfelter also doubts the casualties of the Romans, citing the scarcity and unreliability of ancient sources, with him expressing that &quot;are we really supposed to believe that Hannibal&#x27;s 50,000 Carthaginians slaughtered 48,000–70,000 Romans on a single afternoon on the field of Cannae, even if the battle did degenerate into a massacre in its final stages?&quot;.

=== Carthaginian ===
Livy recorded Hannibal&#x27;s losses at &quot;about 8,000 of his bravest men.&quot; Polybius reports 5,700 dead: 4,000 Gauls, 1,500 Hispanics and Africans, and 200 cavalry.

== Aftermath ==


For a brief period, the Romans were in complete disarray. Their best armies in the peninsula had been destroyed, the few remnants severely demoralized, and the only remaining consul (Varro) completely discredited. As the story goes, Rome declared a national day of mourning as there was not a single person who was not either related to or acquainted with a person who had died. The Romans became so desperate that they resorted to human sacrifice, twice burying people alive at the Forum of Rome and abandoning an oversized baby in the Adriatic Sea (perhaps one of the last instances of human sacrifices by the Romans, apart from public executions of defeated enemies dedicated to Mars).
Within just three campaign seasons (20 months), Rome had lost one-fifth (150,000) of the entire population of male citizens over 17 years of age. The morale effect of this victory was such that most of southern Italy joined Hannibal&#x27;s cause. After Cannae, the Hellenistic southern provinces of Arpi, Salapia, and Uzentum, including the cities of Capua and Tarentum, two of the largest city-states in Italy, and other settlements of non-Latin origin such as Herdonia, revoked their allegiance to Rome and pledged their loyalty to Hannibal.

As Livy noted, &quot;How much more serious was the defeat of Cannae than those which preceded it, can be seen by the behavior of Rome&#x27;s allies; before that fateful day, their loyalty remained unshaken, now it began to waver for the simple reason that they despaired of Roman power.&quot; Following the battle, Sicily&#x27;s Greek cities rose in revolt against Roman political control. The Macedonian king, Philip V, pledged his support to Hannibal, initiating the First Macedonian War against Rome. Hannibal also secured an alliance with the new king Hieronymus of Syracuse, the only independent king left in Sicily.
Livy illustrates the state of Roman morale with two vivid anecdotes. The first concerns Hannibal&#x27;s brother Mago, who had returned to Carthage with news of the victory. He reported to their senate that in several engagements with the Romans Hannibal had killed over 200,000 soldiers and taken 50,000 prisoner; of six commanders, two consuls and a Master of horse had been slain; and a number of Roman allies had gone over to the Carthaginians. Then Mago concluded his report by having a collection of golden rings poured upon the council floor in front of the assembled senators. He explained that each ring belonged to one who had been slain in battle and had earned the ring through exceptional bravery. Livy notes that one unnamed authority stated the volume of jewelry amounted to three and one-half measures (Congius?), only to add &quot;it is generally and more credibly held that there was not more than one measure of them&quot;.

The second concerns Lucius Caecilius Metellus and three other military tribunes, who had taken refuge at Canusium with other Roman refugees. Demoralized at the defeat, they discussed the possibility of setting sail overseas and finding employment as mercenaries for some foreign prince. Word of this meeting reached the young Publius Cornelius Scipio who, with only a few followers, burst into the room where the discussion was underway. Holding his naked sword over the heads of the wavering men, Scipio is reported to have cried:

After the battle, the commander of the Numidian cavalry, Maharbal, urged Hannibal to seize the opportunity and march immediately on Rome. It is told that the latter&#x27;s refusal caused Maharbal&#x27;s exclamation: &quot;Assuredly, no one man has been blessed with all God&#x27;s gifts. You, Hannibal, know how to gain a victory; you do not know how to use it.&quot;

Instead, Hannibal sent a delegation led by Carthalo to negotiate a peace treaty with the Senate on moderate terms. Despite the multiple catastrophes Rome had suffered, the Senate refused to parley. Instead, they redoubled their efforts, declaring full mobilization of the male Roman population, and raised new legions, enlisting landless peasants and even slaves. So firm were these measures that the word &quot;peace&quot; was prohibited, mourning was limited to only 30 days, and public tears were prohibited even to women.

Hannibal had good reasons to judge the strategic situation after the battle differently from Maharbal. As the historian Hans Delbrück pointed out, due to the high numbers of killed and wounded among its ranks, the Punic army was not in a condition to mount a direct assault on Rome. It would have been a fruitless demonstration that would have nullified the psychological effect of Cannae on the Roman allies. Even if his army were at full strength, a successful siege of Rome would have required Hannibal to subdue a considerable part of the hinterland to cut the enemy&#x27;s supplies and secure his own.

Even after the tremendous losses suffered at Cannae and the defection of a number of her allies, Rome still had abundant manpower to prevent this and maintain considerable forces in Iberia, Sicily, Sardinia and elsewhere, despite Hannibal&#x27;s presence in Italy. Hannibal&#x27;s conduct after the victories at Trasimene (217 BC) and Cannae, and the fact that he first attacked Rome only five years later in 211 BC, suggests that his strategic aim was not the destruction of his foe but to dishearten the Romans by carnage on the battlefield and to wear them down to a moderate peace agreement by stripping them of their allies.

&quot;In fact there were many good reasons for not marching on Rome,&quot; military expert Robert O&#x27;Connell writes, &quot;and only one good reason for going.&quot; While the scholars provide reasons not to march, a soldier, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, believed Maharbal was right; when a more powerful adversary is down, he must be dispatched. &quot;Hannibal&#x27;s single chance of winning the larger war was to begin marching his army towards Rome,&quot; O&#x27;Connell adds. &quot;In the end it still would have been a long shot. But it was his only shot. Instead, Hannibal chose another route, and the war became only a matter of time.&quot;

For the remainder of the war in Italy, the Romans did not amass large forces under one command against Hannibal; they used several independent armies, still outnumbering the Punic forces in numbers of soldiers. The war in Italy still had occasional battles, but was focused on taking strongpoints and constant fighting according to the Fabian strategy. This finally forced Hannibal with his shortage of manpower to retreat to Croton from where he was called to Africa for the final battle of Zama, where the Roman victory ended the war.

== Historical significance ==
=== Effects on Roman military doctrine ===
Cannae played a major role in shaping the military structure and tactical organization of the Republican army. At Cannae, the Roman infantry assumed a formation similar to the Greek phalanx. This left them vulnerable to Hannibal&#x27;s tactic of double envelopment since their inability to maneuver independently from the mass of the army made it impossible for them to counter the strategic encirclement used by the Carthaginian cavalry. The laws of the Roman state requiring command to alternate between the two consuls restricted strategic consistency.

In the years following Cannae, striking reforms were introduced to address these deficiencies. First, the Romans &quot;articulated the phalanx, then divided it into columns, and finally split it up into a great number of small tactical bodies that were capable, now of closing together in a compact impenetrable union, now of changing the pattern with consummate flexibility, of separating one from the other and turning in this or that direction.&quot; For instance, at Ilipa and Zama, the were formed up well to the rear of the —a deployment that allowed a greater degree of mobility and maneuverability. The culminating result of this change marked the transition from the traditional manipular system to the cohort under Gaius Marius, as the basic infantry unit of the Roman army.

In addition, a unified command came to be seen as a necessity. After various political experiments, Scipio Africanus was made general-in-chief of the Roman armies in Africa, and was assured this role for the duration of the war. This appointment may have violated the constitutional laws of the Roman Republic but, as Delbrück wrote, it &quot;effected an internal transformation that increased her military potentiality enormously&quot; while foreshadowing the decline of the Republic&#x27;s political institutions. Furthermore, the battle exposed the limits of a citizen-militia army. Following Cannae, the Roman army gradually developed into a professional force.

=== Status in military history ===
Cannae is as famous for Hannibal&#x27;s tactics as it is for the role it played in Roman history. Not only did Hannibal inflict a defeat on the Roman Republic in a manner unrepeated for over a century until the lesser-known Battle of Arausio, but the battle also has acquired a significant reputation in military history. As military historian Theodore Ayrault Dodge wrote:

Will Durant wrote, &quot;It was a supreme example of generalship, never bettered in history... and it set the lines of military tactics for 2,000 years&quot;.

Hannibal&#x27;s double envelopment at Cannae is often viewed as one of the greatest battlefield maneuvers in history, and is cited as the first successful use of the pincer movement within the Western world to be recorded in detail.

=== Cannae model ===

Apart from being one of the greatest defeats inflicted on Roman arms, Cannae represents the archetypal battle of annihilation, a strategy that has rarely succeeded since. As Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in World War II, wrote, &quot;Every ground commander seeks the battle of annihilation; so far as conditions permit, he tries to duplicate in modern war the classic example of Cannae&quot;. &quot;Cannae&quot; has become a byword for military success, and the battle is studied in military academies around the world. The notion that an entire army could be encircled and annihilated within a single stroke led to a fascination among Western generals for centuries, including Frederick the Great and Helmuth von Moltke, who attempted to create their own &quot;Cannae&quot;.

Delbrück&#x27;s seminal study of the battle influenced German military theorists, particularly Chief of the German General Staff Alfred von Schlieffen, whose &quot;Schlieffen Plan&quot; was inspired by Hannibal&#x27;s double envelopment maneuver. Schlieffen believed that the &quot;Cannae model&quot; would continue to be applicable in maneuver warfare throughout the 20th century:

Schlieffen later developed his own operational doctrine in a series of articles, many of which were translated and published in a work entitled &quot;Cannae&quot;.

In 1991, General Norman Schwarzkopf Jr., commander of coalition forces in the Gulf War, cited Hannibal&#x27;s triumph at Cannae as inspiration for the rapid and successful coalition operations during the conflict.

== Historical sources ==
There are three main accounts of the battle, none of them contemporary. The closest is Polybius, who wrote his account 50 years after the battle. Livy wrote in the time of Augustus, and Appian later still. Appian&#x27;s account describes events that have no relation with those of Livy and Polybius. Polybius portrays the battle as the nadir of Roman fortunes, perhaps to emphasise the subsequent Roman recovery—some historians contend that his casualty figures are exaggerated—&quot;more symbolic than factual&quot;.

Livy portrays the Senate in heroic terms and assigns blame for the Roman defeat to the low-born Varro. This lifts blame from the Roman soldiers, whom Livy idealizes. Scholars tend to discount Appian&#x27;s account. The verdict of Philip Sabin—&quot;a worthless farrago&quot;—is typical.

Although he has no connected narrative of the battle, Plutarch provides a number of details about Cannae in his &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, specifically the essays &quot;Fabius&quot; and &quot;Aemilius Paulus&quot;.

Historian Martin Samuels has questioned whether it was in fact Varro in command on the day on the grounds that Paullus may have been in command on the right. The warm reception that Varro received after the battle from the Senate was in striking contrast to the savage criticism meted out to other commanders. Samuels doubts whether Varro would have been received with such warmth had he been in command. Gregory Daly notes that, in the Roman military, the right was always the place of command. He suggests that at the Battle of Zama Hannibal claimed to have fought Paullus at Cannae and concludes that it is impossible to be sure who was in command on the day.

<text>The Geminids are a prolific meteor shower with 3200 Phaethon (which is thought to be an Apollo asteroid with a &quot;rock comet&quot; orbit.) being the parent body. Because of this, it would make this shower, along with the Quadrantids, the only major meteor showers not originating from a comet. The meteors from this shower are slow, they can be seen in December and usually peak around December 4–16, with the date of highest intensity being the morning of December 14. Current showers produce up to 120–160 meteors per hour under optimal conditions, peaking around 2:00 or 3:00. Geminids were first observed in 1862, much later than other showers such as the Perseids (36 AD) and Leonids (902 AD).

Based on data from the Parker Solar Probe, a 2023 study suggested that the Geminids may have been formed by the catastrophic breakup of a comet that formed asteroids 2005 UD and 1999 YC in addition to Phaethon.

== Background ==
The Geminid meteor shower is unique among celestial events as it originates not from a comet but from the asteroid 3200 Phaethon, discovered on Oct. 11, 1983, by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS). Phaethon&#x27;s 1.4-year orbit around the Sun and its comet-like elliptical trajectory have led scientists to speculate if it is a &quot;dead comet&quot; or a distinct celestial entity known as a &quot;rock comet.&quot; Despite its comet-like orbit, Phaethon lacks a cometary tail and exhibits spectra resembling a rocky asteroid. The Geminid meteoroids formed from Phaethon are denser (2–3 g/cm3) than typical cometary dust flakes (0.3 g/cm3). Named after the Greek mythological figure who drove the Sun-god Helios&#x27; chariot, Phaethon&#x27;s discovery was attributed to astronomer Fred Whipple.

== Radiant ==

The meteors in this shower appear to come from the radiant in the constellation Gemini (hence the shower&#x27;s name). However, they can appear almost anywhere in the night sky, and often appear yellowish in hue. Well north of the equator, the radiant rises about sunset, reaching a usable elevation from the local evening hours onwards. In the southern hemisphere, the radiant appears only around local midnight or so. Observers in the northern hemisphere will see higher Geminid rates as the radiant is higher in the sky. The meteors travel at medium speed in relation to other showers, at about , making them fairly easy to spot. They usually fall apart while at heights above .

<text>A meteor shower is a celestial event in which a number of meteors are observed to radiate, or originate, from one point in the night sky. These meteors are caused by streams of cosmic debris called meteoroids entering Earth&#x27;s atmosphere at extremely high speeds on parallel trajectories. Most meteors are smaller than a grain of sand, so almost all of them disintegrate and never hit the Earth&#x27;s surface. Very intense or unusual meteor showers are known as meteor outbursts and meteor storms, which produce at least 1,000 meteors an hour, most notably from the Leonids. The Meteor Data Centre lists over 900 suspected meteor showers of which about 100 are well established. Several organizations point to viewing opportunities on the Internet. NASA maintains a daily map of active meteor showers.

==Historical developments==
A meteor shower in August 1583 was recorded in the Timbuktu manuscripts.
In the modern era, the first great meteor storm was the Leonids of November 1833. One estimate is a peak rate of over one hundred thousand meteors an hour, but another, done as the storm abated, estimated more than two hundred thousand meteors during the 9 hours of the storm, over the entire region of North America east of the Rocky Mountains. American Denison Olmsted (1791–1859) explained the event most accurately. After spending the last weeks of 1833 collecting information, he presented his findings in January 1834 to the &quot;American Journal of Science and Arts&quot;, published in January–April 1834, and January 1836. He noted the shower was of short duration and was not seen in Europe, and that the meteors radiated from a point in the constellation of Leo. He speculated the meteors had originated from a cloud of particles in space. Work continued, yet coming to understand the annual nature of showers though the occurrences of storms perplexed researchers.

The actual nature of meteors was still debated during the 19th century. Meteors were conceived as an atmospheric phenomenon by many scientists (Alexander von Humboldt, Adolphe Quetelet, Julius Schmidt) until the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli ascertained the relation between meteors and comets in his work &quot;&quot;Notes upon the astronomical theory of the falling stars&quot; (1867).&quot; In the 1890s, Irish astronomer George Johnstone Stoney (1826–1911) and British astronomer Arthur Matthew Weld Downing (1850–1917) were the first to attempt to calculate the position of the dust at Earth&#x27;s orbit. They studied the dust ejected in 1866 by comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle before the anticipated Leonid shower return of 1898 and 1899. Meteor storms were expected, but the final calculations showed that most of the dust would be far inside Earth&#x27;s orbit. The same results were independently arrived at by Adolf Berberich of the Königliches Astronomisches Rechen Institut (Royal Astronomical Computation Institute) in Berlin, Germany. Although the absence of meteor storms that season confirmed the calculations, the advance of much better computing tools was needed to arrive at reliable predictions.

In 1981, Donald K. Yeomans of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory reviewed the history of meteor showers for the Leonids and the history of the dynamic orbit of Comet Tempel-Tuttle. A graph from it was adapted and re-published in &quot;Sky and Telescope&quot;. It showed relative positions of the Earth and Tempel-Tuttle and marks where Earth encountered dense dust. This showed that the meteoroids are mostly behind and outside the path of the comet, but paths of the Earth through the cloud of particles resulting in powerful storms were very near paths of nearly no activity.

In 1985, E. D. Kondrat&#x27;eva and E. A. Reznikov of Kazan State University first correctly identified the years when dust was released which was responsible for several past Leonid meteor storms. In 1995, Peter Jenniskens predicted the 1995 Alpha Monocerotids outburst from dust trails. In anticipation of the 1999 Leonid storm, Robert H. McNaught, David Asher, and Finland&#x27;s Esko Lyytinen were the first to apply this method in the West. In 2006 Jenniskens published predictions for future dust trail encounters covering the next 50 years. Jérémie Vaubaillon continues to update predictions based on observations each year for the Institut de Mécanique Céleste et de Calcul des Éphémérides (IMCCE).

==Radiant point ==

Because meteor shower particles are all traveling in parallel paths and at the same velocity, they will appear to an observer below to radiate away from a single point in the sky. This radiant point is caused by the effect of perspective, similar to parallel railroad tracks converging at a single vanishing point on the horizon. Meteor showers are normally named after the constellation from which the meteors appear to originate. This &quot;fixed point&quot; slowly moves across the sky during the night due to the Earth turning on its axis, the same reason the stars appear to slowly march across the sky. The radiant also moves slightly from night to night against the background stars (radiant drift) due to the Earth moving in its orbit around the Sun. See &quot;IMO&quot; Meteor Shower Calendar 2017 (International Meteor Organization) for maps of drifting &quot;fixed points&quot;.

When the moving radiant is at the highest point, it will reach the observer&#x27;s sky that night. The Sun will be just clearing the eastern horizon. For this reason, the best viewing time for a meteor shower is generally slightly before dawn — a compromise between the maximum number of meteors available for viewing and the brightening sky, which makes them harder to see.

==Naming ==
Meteor showers are named after the nearest constellation, or bright star with a Greek or Roman letter assigned that is close to the radiant position at the peak of the shower, whereby the grammatical declension of the Latin possessive form is replaced by &quot;id&quot; or &quot;ids.&quot; Hence, meteors radiating from near the star Delta Aquarii (declension &quot;-i&quot;) are called the Delta Aquariids. The International Astronomical Union&#x27;s Task Group on Meteor Shower Nomenclature and the IAU&#x27;s Meteor Data Center keep track of meteor shower nomenclature and which showers are established.

==Origin of meteoroid streams ==

A meteor shower results from an interaction between a planet, such as Earth, and streams of debris from a comet (or occasionally an asteroid). Comets can produce debris by water vapor drag, as demonstrated by Fred Whipple in 1951, and by breakup. Whipple envisioned comets as &quot;dirty snowballs&quot;, made up of rock embedded in ice, orbiting the Sun. The &quot;ice&quot; may be water, methane, ammonia, or other volatiles, alone or in combination. The &quot;rock&quot; may vary in size from a dust mote to a small boulder. Dust mote sized solids are orders of magnitude more common than those the size of sand grains, which, in turn, are similarly more common than those the size of pebbles, and so on. When the ice warms and sublimates, the vapor can drag along dust, sand, and pebbles.

Each time a comet swings by the Sun in its orbit, some of its ice vaporizes, and a certain number of meteoroids will be shed. The meteoroids spread out along the entire trajectory of the comet to form a meteoroid stream, also known as a &quot;dust trail&quot; (as opposed to a comet&#x27;s &quot;gas tail&quot; caused by the tiny particles that are quickly blown away by solar radiation pressure).

Recently, Peter Jenniskens has argued that most of our short-period meteor showers are not from the normal water vapor drag of active comets, but the product of infrequent disintegrations, when large chunks break off a mostly dormant comet. Examples are the Quadrantids and Geminids, which originated from a breakup of asteroid-looking objects, and 3200 Phaethon, respectively, about 500 and 1000 years ago. The fragments tend to fall apart quickly into dust, sand, and pebbles and spread out along the comet&#x27;s orbit to form a dense meteoroid stream, which subsequently evolves into Earth&#x27;s path.

==Dynamical evolution of meteoroid streams ==

Shortly after Whipple predicted that dust particles traveled at low speeds relative to the comet, Milos Plavec was the first to offer the idea of a &quot;dust trail&quot;, when he calculated how meteoroids, once freed from the comet, would drift mostly in front of or behind the comet after completing one orbit. The effect is simple celestial mechanics – the material drifts only a little laterally away from the comet while drifting ahead or behind the comet because some particles make a wider orbit than others. These dust trails are sometimes observed in comet images taken at mid infrared wavelengths (heat radiation), where dust particles from the previous return to the Sun are spread along the orbit of the comet (see figures).

The gravitational pull of the planets determines where the dust trail would pass by Earth orbit, much like a gardener directing a hose to water a distant plant. Most years, those trails would miss the Earth altogether, but in some years, the Earth is showered by meteors. This effect was first demonstrated from observations of the 1995 alpha Monocerotids, and from earlier not widely known identifications of past Earth storms.

Over more extended periods, the dust trails can evolve in complicated ways. For example, the orbits of some repeating comets, and meteoroids leaving them, are in resonant orbits with Jupiter or one of the other large planets – so many revolutions of one will equal another number of the other. This creates a shower component called a filament.

A second effect is a close encounter with a planet. When the meteoroids pass by Earth, some are accelerated (making wider orbits around the Sun), others are decelerated (making shorter orbits), resulting in gaps in the dust trail in the next return (like opening a curtain, with grains piling up at the beginning and end of the gap). Also, Jupiter&#x27;s perturbation can dramatically change sections of the dust trail, especially for a short period comets, when the grains approach the giant planet at their furthest point along the orbit around the Sun, moving most slowly. As a result, the trail has a &quot;clumping&quot;, a &quot;braiding&quot; or a &quot;tangling&quot; of &quot;crescents&quot;, of each release of material.

The third effect is that of radiation pressure which will push less massive particles into orbits further from the Sun – while more massive objects (responsible for bolides or fireballs) will tend to be affected less by radiation pressure. This makes some dust trail encounters rich in bright meteors, others rich in faint meteors.
Over time, these effects disperse the meteoroids and create a broader stream. The meteors we see from these streams are part of &quot;annual showers&quot;, because Earth encounters those streams every year at much the same rate.

When the meteoroids collide with other meteoroids in the zodiacal cloud, they lose their stream association and become part of the &quot;sporadic meteors&quot; background. Long since dispersed from any stream or trail, they form isolated meteors, not a part of any shower. These random meteors will not appear to come from the radiant of the leading shower.

== Famous meteor showers ==

=== Perseids and Leonids ===

In most years, the most visible meteor shower is the Perseids, which peak on 12 August of each year at over one meteor per minute. NASA has a tool to calculate how many meteors per hour are visible from one&#x27;s observing location.

The Leonid meteor shower peaks around 17 November of each year. The Leonid shower produces a meteor storm, peaking at rates of thousands of meteors per hour. Leonid storms gave birth to the term &quot;meteor shower&quot; when it was first realised that, during the November 1833 storm, the meteors radiated from near the star Gamma Leonis. The last Leonid storms were in 1999, 2001 (two), and 2002 (two). Before that, there were storms in 1767, 1799, 1833, 1866, 1867, and 1966. When the Leonid shower is not &quot;storming&quot;, it is less active than the Perseids.

As the Moon is in the neighborhood of Earth it can experience the same showers, but will have its own phenomena due to its lack of an atmosphere &quot;per se&quot;, such as vastly increasing its sodium tail. NASA now maintains an ongoing database of observed impacts on the moon maintained by the Marshall Space Flight Center whether from a shower or not.

Many planets and moons have impact craters dating back large spans of time. But new craters, perhaps even related to meteor showers are possible. Mars, and thus its moons, is known to have meteor showers. These have not been observed on other planets as yet but may be presumed to exist. For Mars in particular, although these are different from the ones seen on Earth because of the different orbits of Mars and Earth relative to the orbits of comets. The Martian atmosphere has less than one percent of the density of Earth&#x27;s at ground level, at their upper edges, where meteoroids strike; the two are more similar. Because of the similar air pressure at altitudes for meteors, the effects are much the same. Only the relatively slower motion of the meteoroids due to increased distance from the sun should marginally decrease meteor brightness. This is somewhat balanced because the slower descent means that Martian meteors have more time to ablate.

On March 7, 2004, the panoramic camera on Mars Exploration Rover &quot;Spirit&quot; recorded a streak which is now believed to have been caused by a meteor from a Martian meteor shower associated with comet 114P/Wiseman-Skiff. A strong display from this shower was expected on December 20, 2007. Other showers speculated about are a &quot;Lambda Geminid&quot; shower associated with the Eta Aquariids of Earth (&quot;i.e.&quot;, both associated with Comet 1P/Halley), a &quot;Beta Canis Major&quot; shower associated with Comet 13P/Olbers, and &quot;Draconids&quot; from 5335 Damocles.

Isolated massive impacts have been observed at Jupiter: The 1994 Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 which formed a brief trail as well, and successive events since then (see List of Jupiter events.) Meteors or meteor showers have been discussed for most of the objects in the Solar System with an atmosphere: Mercury, Venus, Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan, Neptune&#x27;s moon Triton, and Pluto.

<doc id="157820" wikidata="Q749877" url="?curid=157820" title="Western text-type">
<text>In textual criticism of the New Testament, the Western text-type is one of the main text types. It is the predominant form of the New Testament text witnessed in the Old Latin and Syriac translations from the Greek, and also in quotations from certain 2nd and 3rd-century Christian writers, including Cyprian, Tertullian and Irenaeus. The Western text had many characteristic features, which appeared in text of the Gospels, Book of Acts, and in Pauline epistles. The Catholic epistles and the Book of Revelation probably did not have a Western form of text. It was named &quot;Western&quot; by Semmler (1725–1791), having originated in early centers of Christianity in the Western Roman Empire.

However, the existence of a singular Western text-type has been criticized by some recent textual critics such as J. Read-Heimerdinger, instead preferring to call the Western text a group of text-types and not as a singular text-type.

== Description ==
The main characteristic of the Western text is a love of paraphrase: &quot;Words and even clauses are changed, omitted, and inserted with surprising freedom, wherever it seemed that the meaning could be brought out with greater force and definiteness.&quot; One possible source of glossing is the desire to harmonise and to complete: &quot;More peculiar to the Western text is the readiness to adopt alterations or additions from sources extraneous to the books which ultimately became canonical.&quot; This text type often presents longer variants of text, but in a few places, including the end of the Gospel of Luke, it has shorter variants, named Western non-interpolations.

Only one Greek uncial manuscript is considered to transmit a Western text for the four Gospels and the Book of Acts, the fifth century Codex Bezae; the sixth century Codex Claromontanus is considered to transmit a Western text for the letters of Saint Paul and is followed by two ninth century uncials: F and G. Many &quot;Western&quot; readings are also found in the Old Syriac translations of the Gospels, the Sinaitic and the Curetonian, though opinions vary as to whether these versions can be considered witnesses to the Western text-type. A number of fragmentary early papyri from Egypt also have Western readings, 𝔓29, 𝔓38, 𝔓48; and in addition, Codex Sinaiticus is considered to be Western in the first eight chapters of John. The term &quot;Western&quot; is a bit of a misnomer because members of the Western text-type have been found in the Christian East, including Syria.

Manuscripts classified as &quot;Western&quot; generally have longer readings when compared to other text-types.

== Witnesses ==

Other manuscripts: 𝔓25, 𝔓29 (?), 𝔓41, 066, 0177, 36, 88, 181 (Pauline epistles), 255, 257, 338, 383 (Acts), 440 (Acts), 614 (Acts), 913, 915, 917, 1108, 1245, 1518, 1611, 1836, 1874, 1898, 1912, 2138, 2298, 2412 (Acts).

Compared to the Byzantine text-type distinctive Western readings in the Gospels are more likely to be abrupt in their Greek expression. Compared to the Alexandrian text-type distinctive Western readings in the Gospels are more likely to display glosses, additional details, and instances where the original passages appear to be replaced with longer paraphrases. In distinction from both Alexandrian and Byzantine texts, the Western text-type consistently omits a series of eight short phrases from verses in the Gospel of Luke; the so-called Western non-interpolations. In at least two Western texts, the Gospels appear in a variant order: Matthew, John, Luke, Mark. The Western text of the Epistles of Paul - as witnessed in the Codex Claromontanus and uncials F and G - does not share the periphrastic tendencies of the Western text in the Gospels and Acts, and it is not clear whether they should be considered to share a single text-type.

Although the Western text-type survives in relatively few witnesses, some of these are as early as the earliest witnesses to the Alexandrian text type. Nevertheless, the majority of text critics consider the Western text in the Gospels to be characterised by periphrasis and expansion; and accordingly tend to prefer the Alexandrian readings. In the letters of St Paul, the counterpart Western text is more restrained, and some text critics regard it as the most reliable witness to the original. Nonetheless, the &#x27;Western&#x27; Pauline materials do exhibit distinctive redactional biases, with a number of distinctive variants which collectively tend to diminish the status of the women in the congregations addressed by Paul.

<text>Victor Lonzo Fleming (February 23, 1889 – January 6, 1949) was an American film director, cinematographer, and producer. His most popular films were &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, for which he won an Academy Award for Best Director, and &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (both 1939). Fleming has those same two films listed in the top 10 of the American Film Institute&#x27;s 2007 AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies list.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Fleming was born at the Banbury Ranch near what is now La Cañada Flintridge, California, the son of Eva (née Hartman) and William Richard Lonzo Fleming.

===Career===
He served in the photographic section for the United States Army during World War I, and acted as chief photographer for President Woodrow Wilson in Versailles, France. Beginning in 1918, Fleming taught at and headed Columbia University&#x27;s School of Military Cinematography, training over 700 soldiers to cut, edit, shoot, develop, store and ship film; filmmakers that participated in the program included Josef von Sternberg, Ernest B. Schoedsack, and Lewis Milestone. He showed a mechanical aptitude early in life; while working as a car mechanic, he met the director Allan Dwan, who took him on as a camera assistant. He soon rose to the rank of cinematographer, working with both Dwan and D. W. Griffith, and directed his first film in 1919.

Many of his silent films were action movies, often starring Douglas Fairbanks, or Westerns. Because of his robust attitude and love of outdoor sports, he became known as a &quot;man&#x27;s director&quot;; however, he also proved an effective director of women. Under his direction, Vivien Leigh won the Best Actress Oscar, Hattie McDaniel won for Best Supporting Actress, and Olivia de Havilland was nominated.

In the opinion of veteran cinematographer Archie Stout, of all the directors he worked with Fleming was the most knowledgeable when it came to camera angles and appropriate lenses. He was remembered by Van Johnson as a being a masterful director but a &quot;tough man&quot; to work for. He was close friends with another veteran cinematographer, Charles Schoenbaum.

===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===

In 1932, Fleming joined MGM and directed some of the studio&#x27;s most prestigious films. &quot;Red Dust&quot; (1932), &quot;Bombshell&quot; (1933), and &quot;Reckless&quot; (1935) showcasing Jean Harlow, while &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1934) starring Wallace Beery and &quot;Captains Courageous&quot; (1937) with Spencer Tracy brought a touch of literary distinction to boy&#x27;s-own adventure stories. His two most famous films came in 1939, when &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; was closely followed by &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.
Fleming&#x27;s version of &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1941), with Spencer Tracy, was generally rated below Rouben Mamoulian&#x27;s 1931 pre-Code version, which had starred Fredric March. Fleming&#x27;s 1942 film version of John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot; starred Tracy, John Garfield, Hedy Lamarr, and Frank Morgan. Other films that Fleming made with Tracy include &quot;Captains Courageous&quot; (for which Tracy won his first Oscar), &quot;A Guy Named Joe&quot;, and &quot;Test Pilot&quot;. He directed Clark Gable in a total of five films – &quot;Red Dust&quot;, &quot;The White Sister&quot;, &quot;Test Pilot&quot;, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, and &quot;Adventure&quot;.

==Personal life==
He owned the Moraga Estate in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California, then a horse ranch. Frequent guests to his estate included Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Ingrid Bergman, and Spencer Tracy.

He died en route to a hospital in Cottonwood, Arizona, after suffering a heart attack on January 6, 1949. His death occurred shortly after completing &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1948) with Ingrid Bergman, one of the few films that he did not make for MGM. Despite mixed reviews, Fleming&#x27;s film version of the life of Joan received seven Oscar nominations, winning two.

===Political beliefs===
It was reported in James Curtis&#x27;s book &quot;Spencer Tracy: A Biography&quot; that Anne Revere once said Fleming was &quot;violently pro-Nazi&quot; and strongly opposed to the United States entering World War II. According to the Fleming biography &quot;Victor Fleming: An American Movie Master&quot;, by author Michael Sragow, Fleming had once mocked the UK at the outset of World War II by taking a bet as to how long the country could withstand an attack by Germany.

The accuracy of Revere&#x27;s characterization of Fleming has been disputed, however. According to &quot;Victor Fleming: An American Movie Master&quot;, Revere had made her comment because she felt she had been cast in the film &quot;The Yearling&quot; over Flora Robson because Robson was British. However, at the time of the casting, Fleming was working on the film &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;, which featured a British producer and a cast largely composed of British or British Commonwealth actors. Furthermore, Revere did not know Fleming beyond their professional relationship.

<doc id="157826" wikidata="Q188640" url="?curid=157826" title="List of towns and cities in Norway">
<text>This is a list of towns and cities in [[Norway]]. The Norwegian language word means a town or city–there is no distinction between the two words as there is in English. Historically, the designation of town/city was granted by the king, but since 1996 that authority was given to the local municipal councils for each municipality in Norway. In Norway today, there are 108 towns/cities, but they have no legal authority or powers and they are not an administrative body, it is simply a designation. All local government rests with the municipality which may or may not have a town/city located within it.

==History==
Historically, the words (market town), (small seaport), or were used for a town or city. Each of these were granted certain special rights based on their classification and they did hold administrative authority within their borders. A ladested was subordinate to a kjøpstad and over time some of the ladesteds were &quot;upgraded&quot; to the status of kjøpstad in order to gain more trading rights. In 1665, Norway had 20 towns. There were 9 full market towns (kjøpstad): Bergen, Oslo, Trondheim, Tønsberg, Stavanger, Skien, Fredrikstad, Halden, and Kristiansand. There were two mountain towns {bergstad): Kongsberg and Røros. There were 9 market seaports (ladested): Larvik, Moss, Porsgrunn, Molde, Kragerø, Risør, Holmestrand, Mandal, and Drammen (which was actually 2 towns: Bragernes and Strømsø). All of the ladested places on this list were later upgraded to kjøpstads. During the 1800s, urbanization took hold in Norway and many new towns/cities were added. The special trading rights for towns/cities were abolished in 1857.

In 1946, Norwegian municipalities were each assigned a municipality number, a four-digit codes based on ISO 3166-2:NO. Towns/cities got a municipality number in which the third digit was a zero and rural municipalities were given other numbers. In 1952 the special classifications of for towns/cities (kjøpstad, bergstad, and ladested) were entirely rescinded from the law and replaced by the simple classification of . Starting on 1 January 1965, the government&#x27;s focus was moved from the individual towns/cities to their corresponding municipalities. All Norwegian towns/cities and rural municipalities were classified as either a (urban municipality) or (rural municipality). This distinction was rescinded by The Local Government Act of 1992.

Between 1960 and 1965 many Norwegian municipalities were merged. For instance when the urban municipality Brevik merged with the urban municipality Porsgrunn and the rural municipality Eidanger, the new municipality was called Porsgrunn and it kept the municipality number for Porsgrunn. As a result, Brevik was no longer considered an urban municipality/town. On another note, when the urban municipality Hønefoss was merged with the rural municipalities Hole, Norderhov, Tyristrand, and Ådal to form the new municipality of Ringerike, Ringerike retained the old municipality number of Hønefoss meaning that it retained its town/city status. The same thing happened to Egersund and Florø.

Before 1996, the &quot;city status&quot; was awarded by the king and Government through the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development. Since then, the status of town/city is decided by each municipal council and then it is formally accepted by the state. Since 1997, a municipality must have a minimum of 5,000 inhabitants in order to declare city status for one of its settlements. In 1999, the municipal council of Bardu Municipality declared city status for Setermoen, only to be rejected because the municipality fell short of the population limit. One exception is Honningsvåg in Nordkapp Municipality, where the municipality actually has less than 5,000 inhabitants but declared city status before the limit was implemented by law in 1997.

Because of the new laws in 1996-1997, Norway witnessed a rapid rise in the number of cities after that time. A number of relatively small settlements are now called &quot;by&quot;, such as Brekstad with 1,828 inhabitants and Kolvereid with 1,448 inhabitants. Among the cities of today which got this status before 1996, Tvedestrand with 1,983 inhabitants is the smallest. On another note, the laws of 1996 allowed some settlements which lost their city status in the 1960s to regain it.

Oslo, founded in the 11th century, is the largest city and also the capital of Norway. Oslo is the only city in Norway that is consolidated with its municipality and county, thus the city of Oslo, Oslo Municipality, and Oslo County are all one unified unit of government.

<doc id="157829" wikidata="Q156531" url="?curid=157829" title="Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark">
<text>Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark (; – 3 December 1944) was the seventh child and fourth son of King George I and Queen Olga of Greece. He was a grandson of King Christian IX of Denmark and the father of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. He was a prince of Greece and Denmark, both by virtue of his patrilineal descent.

A career soldier, Prince Andrew began military training at an early age, and was commissioned as an officer in the Greek army. His command positions were substantive appointments rather than honorary, and he saw service in the Balkan Wars. In 1913, his father was assassinated and Andrew&#x27;s elder brother Constantine became king. Constantine&#x27;s neutrality policy during World War I led to his abdication, and most of the royal family, including Andrew, was exiled. On their return a few years later, Andrew saw service as Major General in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922), but the war went badly for Greece, and Andrew was blamed, in part, for the loss of Greek territory. He was exiled for a second time in 1922, and spent most of the rest of his life in France.

By 1930, Andrew was estranged from his wife, Princess Alice of Battenberg. His only son, Philip, served in the British navy during World War II, while all four of his daughters were married to Germans, three of whom had Nazi connections. Separated from his wife and son by the effects of the war, Andrew died in Monte Carlo in 1944. He had seen neither of them since 1939.

==Early life==
Prince Andrew was born at the Tatoi Palace just north of Athens on 2 February 1882, the fourth son of George I of Greece. A member of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, he was a prince of both Greece and Denmark, as his father was a younger son of Christian IX of Denmark. He was in the line of succession to the Greek and more distantly to the Danish throne.

In addition to his native Greek, Andrew learned Danish, German, French, English, and Russian. In conversations with his parents he refused to speak anything but Greek. He attended cadet school and staff college at Athens, and was given additional private tuition in military subjects by Panagiotis Danglis, who recorded that he was &quot;quick and intelligent&quot;. He &quot;became quite friendly&quot; with fellow student Theodore Pangalos, the future Greek dictator.

Despite his near-sightedness, Andrew joined the army as a cavalry officer in May 1901.

==Marriage==
In 1902, Prince Andrew met Princess Alice of Battenberg during his stay in London on the occasion of the coronation of Edward VII, who was his uncle-by-marriage and her grand-uncle. Princess Alice was a daughter of Prince Louis of Battenberg and Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, King Edward&#x27;s niece. They fell in love, and the following year, on 6 October 1903, Andrew married Alice in a civil wedding at Darmstadt. The following day two religious wedding services were performed: one Lutheran in the Evangelical Castle Church, and another Greek Orthodox in the Russian Chapel on the Mathildenhöhe. Prince and Princess Andrew had five children, all of whom later had children of their own.

==Early career==

In 1909, the political situation in Greece led to a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, as the Athens government refused to support the Cretan parliament, which had called for the union of Crete (still nominally part of the Ottoman Empire) with the Greek mainland. A group of dissatisfied officers formed a Greek nationalist Military League and demanded, among other reforms, the removal of royal princes from the army, which led to Prince Andrew&#x27;s resignation from the army and the rise to power of Eleftherios Venizelos.
A few years later, at the outbreak of the Balkan Wars in 1912, Andrew was reinstated in the army as a lieutenant colonel in the 3rd Cavalry Regiment, and placed in command of a field hospital. During the war, his father was assassinated and Andrew inherited a villa on the island of Corfu, Mon Repos, as well as an annuity of £4,000. In 1914, Andrew (like many European princes) held honorary military posts in both the German and Russian empires, as well as Prussian, Russian, Danish and Italian knighthoods.

During World War I, Andrew continued to visit Britain, despite veiled accusations in the British House of Commons that he was a German agent. His brother, King Constantine, who was the Kaiser&#x27;s brother-in-law, followed a neutrality policy, but the democratically elected government of Venizelos supported the Allies. By June 1917, the King&#x27;s neutrality policy had become so untenable that he abdicated and the Greek royal family were forced into exile. For the next few years, most of the Greek royal family lived in Switzerland.

==Exile from Greece==
For three years, Constantine&#x27;s second son, Alexander, was king of Greece, until his early death from an infection due to a monkey bite. Constantine was restored to the throne, and Andrew was once again reinstated in the army, this time as a major-general. The family took up residence at Mon Repos.

Andrew was given command of the II Army Corps during the Battle of the Sakarya, which effectively stalemated the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922). Andrew had little respect for his superior officers, whom he considered incompetent. He was ordered to attack the Turkish positions, which he considered a desperate move little short &quot;of ill-concealed panic&quot;. Refusing to put his men in undue danger (suffering lack of food and ammunition), Andrew followed his own battle plan, much to the dismay of the commanding general, Anastasios Papoulas. Relieved of his chief of staff, and given a dressing-down by Papoulas, in September Andrew asked to be removed from command but Papoulas refused. Andrew&#x27;s troops were forced to retreat. He was placed on leave for two months, until he was transferred to the Supreme Army Council. In March 1922, he was appointed as commander of the V Army Corps in Epirus and the Ionian Islands. Papoulas was replaced by General Georgios Hatzianestis.
The Greek defeat in Asia Minor in August 1922 led to the 11 September 1922 Revolution, during which Prince Andrew was arrested, court-martialed, and found guilty of &quot;disobeying an order&quot; and &quot;acting on his own initiative&quot; during the battle of the previous year. Many defendants in the treason trials that followed the coup were shot, including Hatzianestis and five senior politicians. British diplomats assumed that Andrew was also in mortal danger. Andrew, though spared, was banished for life and his family fled into exile aboard a British cruiser, HMS &quot;Calypso&quot;. The family settled at Saint-Cloud on the outskirts of Paris, in a small house loaned to them by Andrew&#x27;s wealthy sister-in-law, Princess George of Greece. He and his family were stripped of their Greek nationality, and traveled under Danish passports.

In 1930, Andrew published a book entitled &quot;Towards Disaster: The Greek Army in Asia Minor in 1921&quot;, in which he defended his actions during the Battle of the Sakarya, but he essentially lived a life of enforced retirement, despite only being in his forties. During their time in exile the family became more and more dispersed. Alice suffered a nervous breakdown and was institutionalized in Switzerland. Their daughters married and settled in Germany, separated from Andrew, and Philip was sent to school in Britain, where he was brought up by his mother&#x27;s British relatives. Andrew went to live in the South of France.

On the French Riviera, Andrew lived in a small apartment, or hotel rooms, or on board a yacht with Countess Andrée de La Bigne. His marriage to Alice was effectively over, and after her recovery and release, she returned to Greece. In 1936, his sentence of exile was quashed by emergency laws, which also restored land and annuities to the King. Andrew returned to Greece for a brief visit that May. The following year, his pregnant daughter Cecilie, his son-in-law and two of his grandchildren were killed in an air accident at Ostend; he travelled to London to meet up with his sixteen-year-old son Prince Philip and they went together to Darmstadt where he met Alice for the first time in six years at the funeral.

During World War II, he found himself essentially trapped in Vichy France, while his son, Prince Philip, fought on the side of the British. They were unable to see or even correspond with one another. Andrew&#x27;s three surviving sons-in-law fought on the German side: Prince Christoph of Hesse was a member of the Nazi Party and the Waffen-SS; Berthold, Margrave of Baden, was invalided out of the Wehrmacht in 1940 after an injury in France; Prince Gottfried of Hohenlohe-Langenburg served on the Eastern Front and was dismissed after the 20 July plot. For five years, Andrew saw neither his wife nor his son.

==Death and burial==

He died in the Hotel Metropole, Monte Carlo, Monaco, of heart failure and arteriosclerosis in the closing months of the war in Europe. Andrew was at first buried in the Russian Orthodox church in Nice, but in 1946 his remains were transferred, by the Greek cruiser &quot;Averof&quot;, to the royal cemetery at Tatoi Palace, near Athens. Prince Philip and then-private secretary, Mike Parker, travelled to Monte Carlo to collect items belonging to his father from Andrée de La Bigne; among these items: a signet ring which the Prince wore from then onwards, an ivory shaving brush he took to using, and some clothes he had adapted to fit him. Prince Andrew left to his only son seven-tenths of his estate, but he also left behind a debt of £17,500, leading Philip&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Victoria Mountbatten, Marchioness of Milford Haven, to complain bitterly of the extravagance the Greek prince had been led into by his French mistress.

<text>A Quick One is the second studio album by the English rock band the Who, released on 9 December 1966. In the United States, where the song &quot;Happy Jack&quot; was a top 40 hit, the album was released in April 1967 under the title Happy Jack with a slightly altered track listing.

Unlike other albums by the Who, where guitarist Pete Townshend was the primary or sole songwriter, &quot;A Quick One&quot; features significant songwriting contributions from all band members, with lead vocalist Roger Daltrey contributing one song, and bassist John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon each contributing two. The album also included a cover of the Holland–Dozier–Holland song &quot;Heat Wave&quot; and ends with a musical suite titled &quot;A Quick One, While He&#x27;s Away&quot;, which served as an inspiration for later rock operas that the Who would become known for.

==Composition and production==
The Who&#x27;s second studio album departs from the R&amp;B emphasis of their debut. Part of the marketing push for the album was a requirement that each band member should write at least two of the songs on it, though Roger Daltrey only wrote one (&quot;See My Way&quot;), so this is the Who album least dominated by Pete Townshend&#x27;s songwriting. It was recorded at IBC Studios, Pye Studios, and Regent Sound in London in 1966 by record producer Kit Lambert. Townshend said that this push for equal contribution led to the exclusion of the band&#x27;s singles that he had written.

&quot;Boris the Spider&quot; was written after John Entwistle had been out drinking with the Rolling Stones&#x27; bassist Bill Wyman. They were making up funny names for animals when Entwistle came up with the song. &quot;Boris the Spider&quot; quickly became Entwistle&#x27;s most popular song, still performed decades later: in later years he often wore a spider necklace, and would have a spider web design inlaid on the body of his custom-made Alembic bass guitar (the latter is pictured on the cover of Entwistle&#x27;s 1981 solo studio album &quot;Too Late the Hero&quot;).

Keith Moon&#x27;s &quot;I Need You&quot; was originally titled &quot;I Need You (Like I Need a Hole in the Head)&quot;. Moon thought the Beatles spoke in a secret language behind his back, and this song was his way of making fun of their northern accents. Although Moon denied that a vocal part in the song was a John Lennon imitation, Entwistle said that, in fact, it was.

John Entwistle would later cite &quot;Whiskey Man&quot; as the first song he ever wrote. It tells the story of a drunkard whose best friend is a man he sees only after drinking heavily. The drunkard is eventually locked in padded room in a sanitarium, and he laments not being able to share the room with Whiskey Man or even call him. In the first line of the song, Entwistle accidentally sings the word &quot;friend&quot; as &quot;fwend&quot;; not wanting to record an entirely new take, he instead opted to double-track the vocal and sing &quot;flend&quot; as a quick fix.

&quot;Heat Wave&quot;, the only cover track and the only nod to the group&#x27;s soul influences on the album, was originally written by Tamla&#x27;s Holland–Dozier–Holland team and performed by Martha and the Vandellas. It was replaced by &quot;Happy Jack&quot; on the original US release but later included on the 1974 double album repackaging of &quot;A Quick One&quot; and &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; (1967).

&quot;Cobwebs and Strange&quot; was originally called &quot;Showbiz Sonata&quot;. Entwistle claimed that the melody came from the 1960 UK television series &quot;Man from Interpol&quot; (1960). The instrumental was written for this series by Tony Crombie, who released it under its original title &quot;Eastern journey&quot;. Each band member played a wind instrument on the track: Townshend played the penny-whistle, Entwistle the trumpet and French horn, Daltrey the trombone, and Moon the tuba. They recorded the winds while marching around the studio.

&quot;See My Way&quot;, Roger Daltrey&#x27;s only writing contribution to the album, is a pastiche of Buddy Holly compositions. In order to achieve a deadened tom-tom sound like that of Crickets drummer Jerry Allison&#x27;s distinctive paradiddles on &quot;Peggy Sue&quot;, towels were placed on Moon&#x27;s drum kit. When this resulted in a sound that did not satisfy the band, Moon instead played the tom fills on cardboard boxes.

The mod and pop number &quot;So Sad About Us&quot;, according to AllMusic, is &quot;one of the Who&#x27;s most covered songs&quot;. The Merseys, Shaun Cassidy, Primal Scream, the Breeders, Daytona, and the Jam have recorded studio versions.

&quot;A Quick One, While He&#x27;s Away&quot; is a nine-minute suite of song snippets telling a story of infidelity and reconciliation, the first foray into an extended form that led to the rock operas &quot;Tommy&quot; (1969) and &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; (1973). Green Day has recorded a cover version of this song.

==Cover art==
The cover was designed by the pop art exponent Alan Aldridge, with the front cover depicting the band playing their instruments, as the titles of some songs from the album come out of the instruments in the form of onomatopoeiae: &quot;Cobwebs and Strange&quot; for Moon (top left), &quot;Whiskey Man&quot; for Entwistle (bottom left), &quot;See My Way&quot; for Daltrey (top right), and &quot;A Quick One, While He&#x27;s Away&quot; for Townshend (bottom right). The back cover of the UK release is black, with the title and track listing across the top, and a colour head-shot photograph of each band member with the letters of &quot;The W H O&quot; superimposed individually over their faces. The back cover of the US release is a black-and-white photo montage of the band members accompanied by a short personality sketch of each (notorious among Who fans for Keith Moon&#x27;s humorous assertion that he was keen on &quot;breeding chickens&quot;). A track listing, a couple of paragraphs touting the band, an advertisement for their debut studio album, and a technical blurb are also crowded onto the back cover of the US release.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Steve Appleford said in 1995 that the album&#x27;s cheerful pop style has an authentic quality with trifles like &quot;Cobwebs and Strange&quot; that are reconciled by &quot;absolutely perfect, poignant pop tune[s]&quot; such as &quot;So Sad About Us&quot;. The album was later described as &quot;fascinatingly quirky&quot; by the magazine.
In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau included the album&#x27;s American version in his &quot;basic record library&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album number 383 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, published in 2003, and 384 in 2012.

<text>An ahnentafel (German for &quot;ancestor table&quot;; ) or ahnenreihe (&quot;ancestor series&quot;; ) is a genealogical numbering system for listing a person&#x27;s direct ancestors in a fixed sequence of ascent. The subject (or proband) of the ahnentafel is listed as , the subject&#x27;s father as and the mother as , the paternal grandparents as and and the maternal grandparents as and , and so on, back through the generations. Apart from , who can be male or female, all even-numbered persons are male, and all odd-numbered persons are female. In this schema, the number of any person&#x27;s father is double the person&#x27;s number, and a person&#x27;s mother is double the person&#x27;s number plus one. Using this definition of numeration, one can derive some basic information about individuals who are listed without additional research.

This construct displays a person&#x27;s genealogy compactly, without the need for a diagram such as a family tree. It is particularly useful in situations where one may be restricted to presenting a genealogy in plain text, for example, in emails or newsgroup articles. In effect, an ahnentafel is a method for storing a binary tree in an array by listing the nodes (individuals) in level-order (in generation order).

The ahnentafel system of numeration is also known as the Eytzinger Method, for Michaël Eytzinger, the Austrian-born historian who first published the principles of the system in 1590; the Sosa Method, named for Jerónimo (Jerome) de Sosa, the Spanish genealogist who popularized the numbering system in his work &quot;Noticia de la gran casa de los marqueses de Villafranca&quot; in 1676; and the Sosa–Stradonitz Method, for Stephan Kekulé von Stradonitz, the genealogist and son of chemist Friedrich August Kekulé, who published his interpretation of Sosa&#x27;s method in his &quot;Ahnentafel-atlas&quot; in 1898.

&quot;Ahnentafel&quot; is a loan word from the German language, and its German equivalents are &quot;Ahnenreihe&quot; and &quot;Ahnenliste&quot;. An ahnentafel list is sometimes called a &quot;Kekulé&quot; after Stephan Kekulé von Stradonitz. A variant of this is known in French as Seize Quartiers.

==Inductive reckoning==
To find out what someone&#x27;s number would be without compiling a list, one must first trace how they relate back to the subject or person of interest, meaning that one determines for example that some ancestor is the subject&#x27;s father&#x27;s mother&#x27;s mother&#x27;s father&#x27;s father. Once one has done that, one can use two methods.

===First method===

Use the definition that a father&#x27;s number will be twice that individual&#x27;s number, or a mother&#x27;s will be twice plus one, and just multiply and add 1 accordingly. For instance, someone can find out what number Sophia of Hanover would be on an ahnentafel of Peter Phillips (son of Princess Anne and grandson of Elizabeth II). Sophia is Phillips&#x27;s mother&#x27;s mother&#x27;s father&#x27;s father&#x27;s father&#x27;s mother&#x27;s father&#x27;s father&#x27;s father&#x27;s father&#x27;s father&#x27;s mother. So, we multiply and add:

:1×2 + 1 = 3
::3×2 + 1 = 7
:::7×2 = 14
::::14×2 = 28
:::::28×2 = 56
::::::56×2 + 1 = 113
:::::::113×2 = 226
::::::::226×2 = 452
:::::::::452×2 = 904
::::::::::904×2 = 1808
:::::::::::1808×2 = 3616
::::::::::::3616×2 + 1 = 7233

Thus, if we were to make an ahnentafel for Peter Phillips, Electress Sophia would be #7233, among other numbers due to royal intermarriage causing pedigree collapse. (See #Multiple numbers for the same person below.)

===Second method===
Write down the digit &quot;1&quot;, which represents the subject, then from left to right write &quot;0&quot; for each father and &quot;1&quot; for each mother in the relation, ending with the ancestor of interest. The result will be the binary representation of the ancestor&#x27;s ahnentafel number. Then convert the binary number to decimal form. Using the Sophia example:

:Sophia = Peter&#x27;s mother&#x27;s mother&#x27;s father&#x27;s father&#x27;s father&#x27;s mother&#x27;s father&#x27;s father&#x27;s father&#x27;s father&#x27;s father&#x27;s mother
:Sophia = 1110001000001
:1110001000001 = [1×4096] + [1×2048] + [1×1024] + [0×512] + [0×256] + [0×128] + [1×64] + [0×32] + [0×16] + [0×8] + [0×4] + [0×2] + [1×1]
:Sophia = 7233

==Deductive reckoning==

We can also work in reverse to find what the relation is from the number.

===Reverse first method===

#One starts out by seeing if the number is odd or even.
#If it is odd, the last part of the relation is &quot;mother&quot;, so subtract 1 and divide by 2.
#If it is even, the last part is &quot;father&quot;, and one divides by 2.
#Repeat steps 2–3, and build back from the last word.
#Once one gets to 1, one is done.

On an ahnentafel of Prince William, John Wark is number 116. We follow the steps:

We reverse that, and we get that #116, John Wark, is Prince William&#x27;s mother&#x27;s mother&#x27;s father&#x27;s mother&#x27;s father&#x27;s father.

===Reverse second method===

1. Convert the ahnentafel number from decimal to binary, then replace the leftmost &quot;1&quot; with the subject&#x27;s name and replace each following &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; with &quot;father&quot; and &quot;mother&quot; respectively.

:John Wark = 116
:116 = [1×64] + [1×32] + [1×16] + [0×8] + [1×4] + [0×2] + [0×1]
:John Wark = 1110100
:John Wark = Prince William&#x27;s mother&#x27;s mother&#x27;s father&#x27;s mother&#x27;s father&#x27;s father

== Calculation of the generation number ==
The generation number can be calculated as the logarithm to base 2 of the ahnentafel number, and rounding down to a full integer by truncating decimal digits.

For example, the number 38 is between 25=32 and 26=64, so log2(38) is between 5 and 6. This means that ancestor no.38 belongs to generation five, and was a great-great-great-grandparent of the reference person who is no.1 (generation zero).

==Example==
The example, shown below, is an ahnentafel of the Prince of Wales, listing all of his ancestors up to his fourth great-grandparents.

The same information in a tree:
==Multiple numbers for the same person==
An ancestor may have two or more numbers due to pedigree collapse. For example, in the above Ahnentafel for Prince William, Queen Victoria is both no.79 and no.81. She is no.79 because she was the great-great-grandmother of William&#x27;s grandfather Prince Philip, and she is also no.81 because she was the great-great-grandmother of William&#x27;s grandmother Queen Elizabeth II. The relationships are easier to follow using the ancestry tree with ahnentafel numbering.

== Other German definitions ==
European nobility took pride in displaying their descent. In the German language, the term &quot;Ahnentafel&quot; may refer to a list of coats of arms and names of one&#x27;s ancestors, even when it does not follow the numbered tabular representation given above. In this case, the German &quot;Tafel&quot; is taken literally to be a physical &quot;display board&quot; instead of an abstract scheme.

In Nazi Germany, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service required a person to prove non-Jewish ancestry with an Ariernachweis (Aryan certificate). The certificate could take the form of entries in the permanent Ahnenpass (that was sorted according to the ahnentafel numbering system) or as entries in a singular Arierschein (Aryan attestation) that was titled &quot;Ahnentafel&quot;.

<doc id="157835" wikidata="Q3342272" url="?curid=157835" title="Water table">
<text>The water table is the upper surface of the phreatic zone or zone of saturation. The zone of saturation is where the pores and fractures of the ground are saturated with groundwater, which may be fresh, saline, or brackish, depending on the locality. It can also be simply explained as the depth below which the ground is saturated. The portion above the water table is the vadose zone. It may be visualized as the &quot;surface&quot; of the subsurface materials that are saturated with groundwater in a given vicinity.

In coarse soils, the water table settles at the surface where the water pressure head is equal to the atmospheric pressure (where gauge pressure = 0). In soils where capillary action is strong, the water table is pulled upward, forming a capillary fringe. 

The groundwater may be from precipitation or from more distant groundwater flowing into the aquifer. In areas with sufficient precipitation, water infiltrates through pore spaces in the soil, passing through the unsaturated zone. At increasing depths, water fills in more of the pore spaces in the soils, until a zone of saturation is reached. Below the water table, in the zone of saturation, layers of permeable rock that yield groundwater are called aquifers. In less permeable soils, such as tight bedrock formations and historic lakebed deposits, the water table may be more difficult to define.

“Water table” and “water level” are not synonymous. If a deeper aquifer has a lower permeable unit that confines the upward flow, then the water level in this aquifer may rise to a level that is greater or less than the elevation of the actual water table. The elevation of the water in this deeper well is dependent upon the pressure in the deeper aquifer and is referred to as the potentiometric surface, not the water table.

== Formation ==
The water table may vary due to seasonal changes such as precipitation and evapotranspiration. In undeveloped regions with permeable soils that receive sufficient amounts of precipitation, the water table typically slopes toward rivers that act to drain the groundwater away and release the pressure in the aquifer. Springs, rivers, lakes and oases occur when the water table reaches the surface. Groundwater entering rivers and lakes accounts for the base-flow water levels in water bodies.

=== Surface topography ===
Within an aquifer, the water table is rarely horizontal, but reflects the surface relief due to the capillary effect (capillary fringe) in soils, sediments and other porous media. In the aquifer, groundwater flows from points of higher pressure to points of lower pressure, and the direction of groundwater flow typically has both a horizontal and a vertical component. The slope of the water table is known as the “hydraulic gradient”, which depends on the rate at which water is added to and removed from the aquifer and the permeability of the material. The water table does not always mimic the topography due to variations in the underlying geological structure (e.g., folded, faulted, fractured bedrock).

=== Perched water tables ===
A perched water table (or perched aquifer) is an aquifer that occurs above the regional water table. This occurs when there is an impermeable layer of rock or sediment (aquiclude) or relatively impermeable layer (aquitard) above the main water table/aquifer but below the land surface. If a perched aquifer&#x27;s flow intersects the surface, at a valley wall, for example, the water is discharged as a spring.

== Fluctuations ==
=== Tidal ===
On low-lying oceanic islands with porous soil, freshwater tends to collect in lenticular pools on top of the denser seawater intruding from the sides of the islands. Such an island&#x27;s freshwater lens, and thus the water table, rises and falls with the tides.

=== Seasonal ===
In some regions, for example, Great Britain or California, winter precipitation is often higher than summer precipitation and so the groundwater storage is not fully recharged in summer. Consequently, the water table is lower during the summer. This disparity between the level of the winter and summer water table is known as the &quot;zone of intermittent saturation&quot;, wherein the water table will fluctuate in response to climatic conditions.

=== Long-term ===
Fossil water is groundwater that has remained in an aquifer for several millennia and occurs mainly in deserts. It is non-renewable by present-day rainfall due to its depth below the surface, and any extraction causes a permanent change in the water table in such regions.

==Effects on crop yield==
Most crops need a water table at a minimum depth. For some important food and fiber crops a classification was made because at shallower depths the crop suffers a yield decline.
:(where DWT = depth to water table in centimetres)

== Effects on construction ==
A water table close to the surface affects excavation, drainage, foundations, wells and leach fields (in areas without municipal water and sanitation), and more.

When excavation occurs near enough to the water table to reach its capillary action, groundwater must be removed during construction. This is conspicuous in Berlin, which is built on sandy, marshy ground, and the water table is generally 2 meters below the surface. Pink and blue pipes can often be seen carrying groundwater from construction sites into the Spree river (or canals).
