<text>In political science, a reactionary or a reactionist is a person who holds political views that favor a return to the &quot;&quot;—the previous political state of society—which the person believes possessed positive characteristics that are absent from contemporary society. As a descriptor term, &quot;reactionary&quot; derives from the ideological context of the left–right political spectrum. As an adjective, the word &quot;reactionary&quot; describes points of view and policies meant to restore a &quot;status quo ante&quot;.

As an ideology, reactionism is a tradition in right-wing politics; the reactionary stance opposes policies for the social transformation of society, whereas conservatives seek to preserve the socio-economic structure and order that exists in the present. In popular usage, &quot;reactionary&quot; refers to a strong traditionalist conservative political perspective of a person opposed to social, political, and economic change.

Reactionary ideologies can be radical in the sense of political extremism in service to re-establishing past conditions. To some writers, the term &quot;reactionary&quot; carries negative connotations—Peter King observed that it is &quot;an unsought-for label, used as a torment rather than a badge of honor.&quot; Despite this, the descriptor &quot;political reactionary&quot; has been adopted by writers such as the Austrian monarchist Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn, the Scottish journalist Gerald Warner of Craigenmaddie, the Colombian political theologian Nicolás Gómez Dávila, and the American historian John Lukacs.

== History and usage ==

The French Revolution gave the English language three politically descriptive words denoting anti-progressive politics: (i) &quot;reactionary&quot;, (ii) &quot;conservative&quot;, and (iii) &quot;right&quot;. &quot;Reactionary&quot; derives from the French word (a late 18th-century coinage based on the word , &quot;reaction&quot;) and &quot;conservative&quot; from , identifying monarchist parliamentarians opposed to the revolution. In this French usage, reactionary denotes &quot;a movement towards the reversal of an existing tendency or state&quot; and a &quot;return to a previous condition of affairs&quot;. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; cites the first English language usage in 1799 in a translation of Lazare Carnot&#x27;s letter on the Coup of 18 Fructidor.
During the French Revolution, conservative forces (especially within the Catholic Church) organized opposition to the progressive sociopolitical and economic changes brought by the Revolution; and so Conservatives fought to restore the temporal authority of the Church and Crown. In 19th Century European politics, the reactionary class included the Catholic Church&#x27;s hierarchy and the aristocracy, royal families, and royalists who believed that national government was the sole domain of the Church and the State. In France, supporters of traditional rule by direct heirs of the House of Bourbon dynasty were labeled the legitimist reaction. In the Third Republic, the monarchists were the reactionary faction, later renamed &quot;Conservative&quot;.

In the 19th century, reactionary denoted people who idealized feudalism and the pre-modern era—before the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution—when economies were mostly agrarian, a landed aristocracy dominated society, a hereditary king ruled, and the Catholic Church was society&#x27;s moral center. Those labeled &quot;reactionary&quot; favored the aristocracy instead of the middle and working classes. Reactionaries opposed democracy and parliamentarism.

=== Thermidorian Reaction ===
The Thermidorian Reaction was a movement within the French Revolution against the perceived excesses of the Jacobins. Maximilien Robespierre&#x27;s Reign of Terror ended on 27 July 1794 (9 Thermidor year II in the French Republican Calendar). The overthrow of Robespierre signaled the reassertion of the French National Convention over the Committee of Public Safety. The Jacobins were suppressed, the prisons were emptied, and the committee was shorn of its powers. After the execution of some 104 Robespierre supporters, the Thermidorian Reaction stopped using the guillotine against alleged counter-revolutionaries, set a middle course between the monarchists and the radicals, and ushered in a time of relative exuberance and its accompanying corruption.

=== Restoration of the French monarchy ===


With the Congress of Vienna, inspired by Tsar Alexander I of Russia, the monarchs of Russia, Prussia and Austria formed the Holy Alliance, a form of collective security against revolution and Bonapartism. This instance of reaction was surpassed by a movement that developed in France when, after the second fall of Napoleon, the Bourbon Restoration, or reinstatement of the Bourbon dynasty, ensued. This time it was to be a constitutional monarchy, with an elected lower house of parliament, the Chamber of Deputies. The Franchise was restricted to men over the age of forty, which indicated that for the first fifteen years of their lives, they had lived under the &quot;ancien régime&quot;. Nevertheless, King Louis XVIII worried he would still suffer an intractable parliament. He was delighted with the ultra-royalists, or Ultras, whom the election returned, declaring that he had found a &quot;chambre introuvable&quot;, literally, an &quot;unfindable house&quot;.

It was the Declaration of Saint-Ouen that prepared the way for the Restoration. Before the French Revolution, which radically and bloodily overthrew most aspects of French society&#x27;s organization, the only way constitutional change could be instituted was by extracting it from old legal documents that could be interpreted as agreeing with the proposal. Everything new had to be expressed as a righteous revival of something old that had lapsed and had been forgotten. This was also the means used by diminished aristocrats to get themselves a bigger piece of the pie. In the 18th century, those gentry whose fortunes and prestige had diminished to the level of peasants would search diligently for every ancient feudal statute that might give them something. For example, the &quot;ban&quot; meant that all peasants had to grind their grain in their lord&#x27;s mill. Therefore, these gentry came to the French States-General of 1789 fully prepared to press for expanding such practices in all provinces to the legal limit. They were horrified when, for example, the French Revolution permitted common citizens to go hunting, one of the few perquisites they had always enjoyed.

Thus with the Bourbons Restoration, the &quot;Chambre Introuvable&quot; set about reverting every law to return society to conditions prior to the absolute monarchy of Louis XIV, when the power of the Second Estate was at its zenith. This clearly distinguishes a &quot;reactionary&quot; from a &quot;conservative&quot;. The use of the word &quot;reactionary&quot; in later days as a political slur is thus often rhetorical since there is nothing directly comparable with the &quot;Chambre Introuvable&quot; in the history of other countries.

=== Clerical philosophers ===

In the French Revolution&#x27;s aftermath, France was continually wracked by quarrels between right-wing legitimists and left-wing revolutionaries. Herein arose the clerical philosophers—Joseph de Maistre, Louis de Bonald, François-René de Chateaubriand—whose answer was restoring the House of Bourbon and reinstalling the Catholic Church as the established church. Since then, France&#x27;s political spectrum has featured similar divisions (see ). The teachings of the 19th-century popes buttressed the ideas of the clerical philosophers.

=== Metternich and containment ===
From 1815 to 1848, Prince Metternich, the foreign minister of the Austrian Empire, stepped in to organize the containment of revolutionary forces through international alliances to prevent revolutionary fervor. At the Congress of Vienna, he was very influential in establishing the new order, the Concert of Europe, after the defeat of Napoleon.

After the Congress, Prince Metternich worked hard to bolster and stabilize the conservative regime of the Restoration period. He worked furiously to prevent Russia&#x27;s Tsar Alexander I (who aided the liberal forces in Germany, Italy, and France) from gaining influence in Europe. The Church was his principal ally. He promoted it as a conservative principle of order while opposing nationalist and liberal tendencies within the Church. His basic philosophy was based on Edmund Burke, who championed the need for old roots and the orderly development of society. He opposed democratic and parliamentary institutions but favored modernizing existing structures through gradual reform. Despite Metternich&#x27;s efforts, a series of revolutions rocked Europe in 1848.

=== 20th century ===
In the 20th century, proponents of socialism and communism used the term &quot;reactionary&quot; polemically to label their enemies, such as the White Armies, who fought in the Russian Civil War against the Bolsheviks after the October Revolution. In Marxist terminology, &quot;reactionary&quot; is a pejorative adjective denoting people whose ideas might appear to be socialist but, in their opinion, contain elements of feudalism, capitalism, nationalism, fascism, or other characteristics of the ruling class, including usage between conflicting factions of Marxist movements. Non-socialists also used the label &quot;reactionary&quot;, with British diplomat Sir John Jordan nicknaming the Chinese Royalist Party the &quot;reactionary party&quot; for supporting the Qing dynasty and opposing republicanism during the Xinhai Revolution in 1912.

Despite being traditionally related to right-wing governments, elements of reactionary politics were present in left-wing governments as well, such as when Soviet Union leader Joseph Stalin implemented conservative social policies, such as the re-criminalisation of homosexuality, restrictions on abortion and divorce, and abolition of the &quot;Zhenotdel&quot; women&#x27;s department.

&quot;Reactionary&quot; is also used to denote supporters of authoritarian anti-communist régimes such as Vichy France, Spain under Franco, and Portugal under Salazar. One example occurred after Boris Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. On 26 October 1958, the day following the Nobel Committee&#x27;s announcement, Moscow&#x27;s &quot;Literary Gazette&quot; ran a polemical article by David Zaslavski entitled, &quot;Reactionary Propaganda Uproar over a Literary Weed&quot;.

The Italian Fascists desired a new social order based on the ancient feudal principle of delegation (though without serfdom) in their enthusiasm for the corporate state. Benito Mussolini said that &quot;fascism is reaction&quot; and that &quot;fascism, which did not fear to call itself reactionary... has not today any impediment against declaring itself illiberal and anti-liberal.&quot; Giovanni Gentile and Mussolini also attacked certain reactionary policies, particularly monarchism, and veiled some aspects of Italian conservative Catholicism. They wrote, &quot;History doesn&#x27;t travel backwards. The fascist doctrine has not taken Joseph de Maistre as its prophet. Monarchical absolutism is of the past, and so is ecclesiolatry.&quot; They further elaborated in their political doctrine that fascism &quot;is not reactionary [in the old way] but revolutionary.&quot;

Conversely, they explained that fascism was of the right, not the left. Fascism was certainly not simply a return to tradition, as it carried the centralized state beyond even what had been seen in absolute monarchies. Fascist one-party states were as centralized as most communist states, and fascism&#x27;s intense nationalism was not found in the period prior to the French Revolution.

Although the German Nazis did not consider themselves fascists or reactionaries and condemned the traditional German forces of reaction (Prussian monarchists, Junker nobility, and Roman Catholic clergy) as being among their enemies, next to their Red Front enemies in the Nazi Party march , they virulently opposed revolutionary leftism. The fact that the Nazis called their 1933 rise to power the (national revolution) showed that, like the Italian Fascists, they supported some form of revolution; however, the Germans and Italian fascists both idealized tradition, folklore, and the tenets of classical thought and leadership, as exemplified in Nazi-era Germany by the idolization of Frederick the Great. They also rejected the Weimar Republic parliamentary era under the Weimar Constitution, which had succeeded the monarchy in 1918, despite it also being capitalist and classical. Although claiming to be separate from reactionism, the Nazis&#x27; rejection of Weimar was based on ostensibly reactionary principles, as the Nazis claimed that the parliamentary system was simply the first step towards Bolshevism and instead idealized more reactionary parts of Germany&#x27;s past. They referred to Nazi Germany as the German Realm and informally as the &quot;Drittes Reich&quot; (Third Realm), a reference to past reactionary German entities: the Holy Roman Empire (First Realm) and the German Empire (Second Realm).

Clericalist movements, sometimes labeled as clerical fascist by their critics, can be considered reactionaries in terms of the 19th century since they share some elements of fascism while at the same time promoting a return to the pre-revolutionary model of social relations, with a strong role for the Church. Their utmost philosopher was Nicolás Gómez Dávila.

Political scientist Corey Robin argues in his 2011 book &quot;The Reactionary Mind&quot; that modern conservatism in the United States is &quot;inherently reactionary&quot;.

=== 21st century ===
Japan&#x27;s right-wing nationalist and populist movements and related organizations, which emerged rapidly from the late 20th century, are considered &quot;reactionary&quot; because they revised the post-war peace constitution and have an advocating attitude toward the Japanese Empire.

&quot;Neo-reactionary&quot; is a term that is sometimes a self-description of an informal group of online political theorists who have been active since the 2000s. The phrase &quot;neo-reactionary&quot; was coined by &quot;Mencius Moldbug&quot; (the pseudonym of Curtis Yarvin, a computer programmer) in 2008. Arnold Kling used it in 2010 to describe &quot;Moldbug&quot;, and the subculture quickly adopted it. Proponents of the &quot;Neo-reactionary&quot; movement (also called the &quot;Dark Enlightenment&quot; movement) include philosopher Nick Land, among others.

<text>Easter Everywhere is the second studio album by the American psychedelic rock band the 13th Floor Elevators. It was released on 25 October 1967, through record label International Artists.

==Background==

&quot;Easter Everywhere&quot; was packaged with lyrics printed on the inner sleeve, gold ink on the cover, and full color pictures on the reverse. The packaging was quite expensive at the time of release.

===Symbolism===
The front cover, hand-drawn by George Banks, prominently features a primeval Eastern sun, intended to represent the open blazing third eye. Above this is the seventh chakra, the ultimate realm of Nirvana. The gold color on which this is printed was chosen as a symbolic color for the divine. Below the sun is the band&#x27;s name, colored red and formatted to look like the eyebrows of Buddha. This image concept was selected by lyricist and jug player Tommy Hall, along with the rear cover image of a meditating yogi, which is from a photograph of an eighteenth-century painting hanging in the National Museum of Indian Art in New Delhi. Hall selected these images from a Tantric art book, intending to communicate that evolution is obtainable through alignment of the chakras and opening of the third eye (corresponding to the pineal gland); thus a soul coalesces with the collective primeval life force and retains a latent knowledge of its previous existence, therefore consciously achieving immortality.

===Title===
While the use of the term &quot;Easter&quot; in the album&#x27;s title is often misconstrued as implying the album to be of primarily Christian merit, the album&#x27;s composition melds the beliefs of multiple religions, combining Buddhist, Hindu, and Gnostic scriptures into a single unifying spiritual concept evaluated from a Western, Christian perspective. In the band&#x27;s first and only interview, given to Houston fanzine &quot;Mother&quot; on November 20, 1967, Tommy Hall explained the correct interpretation of the title:

==Release==
The album features songs ranging from their own psychedelic &quot;Slip Inside this House&quot; to a psychedelic cover version of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now, Baby Blue&quot;. &quot;Levitation,&quot; which was also released as a single—the latter ranks among the band&#x27;s well-known songs. As on the previous album, Tommy Hall&#x27;s electric jug is prominent in the music. The album was met with lukewarm reviews upon initial release, with a review in Billboard Magazine writing &quot;call it intellectual-rock or call it musical flights of fancy, except for tunes that sound almost like each other, this group is inventive over-all&quot;.

The master tapes are considered missing (or presumed destroyed). The International Artists label was revived by Lelan Rogers in the late 1970s, who reissued &quot;Easter Everywhere&quot; along with the label&#x27;s entire LP catalog in 1979. The album was again reissued on vinyl in 1988 and for the first time on CD in 1991 by Charly Records UK under the Decal imprints.

Following a lawsuit filed by the family of Roky Erickson against Lelan Rogers in 1993 for unpaid royalties, Charly Records purchased the licensing to the full International Artists catalog from Rogers in 1995, which included &quot;Easter Everywhere&quot;. The surviving analog tapes were delivered to Charly Records, but they did not include any original 1967 mixes of &quot;Easter Everywhere&quot;. In 2009, the original mono version (sourced from vinyl) and an alternate stereo version were released as part of the &quot;Sign Of The 3-Eyed Men&quot; box set. In 2010, Charly Records re-released the album in a limited edition CD set featuring &quot;Fire In My Bones&quot;, originally released in 1985 on an outtakes album of the same name. The album was again released on vinyl in 2012 as part of the &quot;Music Of The Spheres&quot; box set, which Charly Records advertised as &quot;mastered from the original tape source&quot;.

In April 2024, the band’s biographer Paul Drummond produced a half-speed master of the album, cut by Miles Showell at Abbey Road Studios. This is the only reissue available that replicates the original 1967 stereo pressing – cut from a tape source. Fans have incorrectly assumed that previous reissues were made from a “1970s phased tape”, they were not, the original cutting engineer in 1967 switched the left and right channels. The half-speed mastered version meticulously replicates all the decisions made by the original engineer who cut the lacquer at Columbia Mastering in 1967.

<doc id="158234" wikidata="Q110022" url="?curid=158234" title="Dual (grammatical number)">
<text>Dual (abbreviated ) is a grammatical number that some languages use in addition to singular and plural. When a noun or pronoun appears in dual form, it is interpreted as referring to precisely two of the entities (objects or persons) identified by the noun or pronoun acting as a single unit or in unison. Verbs can also have dual agreement forms in these languages.

The dual number existed in Proto-Indo-European and persisted in many of its descendants, such as Ancient Greek and Sanskrit, which have dual forms across nouns, verbs, and adjectives; Gothic, which used dual forms in pronouns and verbs; and Old English (Anglo-Saxon), which used dual forms in its pronouns. It can still be found in a few modern Indo-European languages such as Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Lithuanian, Slovene, and Sorbian languages.

The majority of modern Indo-European languages, including modern English, have lost the dual number through their development. Its function has mostly been replaced by the simple plural. They may however show residual traces of the dual, for example in the English distinctions: &quot;both&quot; vs. &quot;all&quot;, &quot;either&quot; vs. &quot;any&quot;, &quot;neither&quot; vs. &quot;none&quot;, and so on. A commonly used sentence to exemplify dual in English is &quot;Both go to the same school.&quot; where &quot;both&quot; refers to two specific people who had already been determined in the conversation.

Many Semitic languages have dual number. For instance, in Hebrew - () or a variation of it is added to the end of some nouns, e.g. some parts of the body (eye, ear, nostril, lip, hand, leg) and some time periods (minute, hour, day, week, month, year) to indicate that it is dual (regardless of how the plural is formed). A similar situation exists in classical Arabic, where is added to the end of any noun to indicate that it is dual (regardless of how the plural is formed).

It is also present in Khoisan languages that have a rich inflectional morphology, particularly Khoe languages, as well as Kunama, a Nilo-Saharan language.

== Comparative characteristics ==

Many languages make a distinction between singular and plural: English, for example, distinguishes between &quot;man&quot; and &quot;men&quot;, or &quot;house&quot; and &quot;houses&quot;. In some languages, in addition to such singular and plural forms, there is also a dual form, which is used when exactly two people or things are meant. In many languages with dual forms, the use of the dual is mandatory as in some Arabic dialects using dual in nouns as in Hejazi Arabic, and the plural is used only for groups greater than two. However, the use of the dual is optional in some languages such as other modern Arabic dialects including Egyptian Arabic.

In other languages such as Hebrew, the dual exists only for words naming time spans (day, week, etc.), a few measure words, and for words that naturally come in pairs and are not used in the plural except in rhetoric: eyes, ears, and so forth.

In Slovene, the use of the dual is mandatory except for nouns that are natural pairs, such as trousers, eyes, ears, lips, hands, arms, legs, feet, kidneys, breasts, lungs, etc., for which the plural form has to be used unless one wants to stress that something is true for both one and the other part. For example, one says (&#x27;my eyes hurt&#x27;), but if they want to stress that both their eyes hurt, they say . When using the pronoun / (&#x27;both&#x27;), the dual form that follows is mandatory. But the use of &quot;obe (both)&quot; is not mandatory since &quot;očesi (two eyes)&quot; as it is, implies that one means both eyes.

Although relatively few languages have the dual number, using different words for groups of two and groups greater than two is not uncommon. English has words distinguishing dual vs. plural number, including: &quot;both&quot;/&quot;all&quot;, &quot;either&quot;/&quot;any&quot;, &quot;neither&quot;/&quot;none&quot;, &quot;between&quot;/&quot;among&quot;, &quot;former&quot;/&quot;first&quot;, and &quot;latter&quot;/&quot;last&quot;. Japanese, which has no grammatical number, also has words (, &#x27;which of the two&#x27;) and (, &#x27;which of the three or more&#x27;), etc.

== Use in modern languages ==
Among living languages, Modern Standard Arabic has a mandatory dual number, marked on nouns, verbs, adjectives, and pronouns. (First-person dual forms, however, do not exist; compare this to the lack of third-person dual forms in the old Germanic languages.) Many of the spoken Arabic dialects have a dual marking for nouns (only), and its use can be mandatory in some dialects, and not mandatory in others. Likewise, Akkadian had a dual number, though its use was confined to standard phrases like &quot;two hands&quot;, &quot;two eyes&quot;, and &quot;two arms&quot;. The dual in Hebrew has also atrophied, generally being used for only time, number, and natural pairs (like body parts) even in its most ancient form.

Inuktitut and the related Central Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik language use dual forms; however, the related Greenlandic language does not (though it used to have them).

Khoekhoegowab and other Khoe languages mark dual number in their person-gender-number enclitics, though the neuter gender does not have a dual form.

Austronesian languages, particularly Polynesian languages such as Hawaiian, Niuean, and Tongan, possess a dual number for pronouns but not for nouns, as nouns are generally marked for plural syntactically and not morphologically. Other Austronesian languages, particularly those spoken in the Philippines, have a dual first-person pronoun; these languages include Ilokano (), Tausug (), and Kapampangan (). These forms mean &quot;we&quot;, but specifically &quot;you and I&quot;. This form once existed in Tagalog ( or sometimes ) but has disappeared from standard usage (save for certain dialects such as in Batangas) since the middle of the 20th century, with as the only surviving form (e.g. , loosely &quot;I love you&quot;).

The dual was a standard feature of the Proto-Uralic language, and lives on in the Samoyedic branch and in most Sami languages, while other members of the family like Finnish, Estonian, and Hungarian have lost it. Sami languages also feature dual pronouns, expressing the concept of &quot;we two here&quot; as contrasted to &quot;we&quot;. Nenets, two closely-related Samoyedic languages, features a complete set of dual possessive suffixes for two systems, the number of possessors and the number of possessed objects (for example, &quot;two houses of us two&quot; expressed in one word).

The dual form is also used in several modern Indo-European languages, such as Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Slovene, and Sorbian (see below for details). The dual was a common feature of all early Slavic languages around the year 1000.

==Arabic==
In Modern Standard Arabic, as well as in Classical Arabic, the use of dual is compulsory when describing two units. For this purpose, is added to the end of any noun or adjective regardless of gender or of how the plural is formed. In the case of feminine nouns ending with , this letter becomes a . When the dual noun or adjective is rendered in the genitive or accusative cases, the becomes .

Besides the noun and adjective dual, there are also dual verb forms of compulsory use for second and third person, together with their pronouns, but none for the first person.

The use of dual in spoken Arabic varies widely and is mostly rendered as even when in nominative context. Whereas its use is quite common in Levantine Arabic, for instance meaning &quot;two kilograms&quot;, dual forms are generally not used in Maghrebi Arabic, where two units are commonly expressed with the word , 
as in meaning &quot;a pair of kilograms&quot;, with the noun appearing in singular.

==Hebrew==

===Biblical and Mishnaic Hebrew===
In Biblical, Mishnaic, and Medieval Hebrew, like Arabic and other Semitic languages, all nouns can have singular, plural or dual forms, and there is still a debate whether there are vestiges of dual verbal forms and pronouns. However, in practice, most nouns use only singular and plural forms. Usually is added to masculine words to make them plural for example &quot;book / books&quot;, whilst with feminine nouns the is replaced with . For example, &quot;cow / cows&quot;. The masculine dual form is shown in pointed text with a pathach; in a purely consonantal text, masculine dual is not indicated at all by the consonants. The dual for (two) days is with pathach under the mem. An example of the dual form is &quot;day / two days / [two or more] days&quot;. Some words occur so often in pairs that the form with the dual suffix is used in practice for the general plural, such as &quot;eye / eyes&quot;, used even in a sentence like &quot;The spider has eight eyes.&quot; Thus words like only appear to be dual, but are in fact what is called &quot;pseudo-dual&quot;, which is a way of making a plural. Sometimes, words can change meaning depending on whether the dual or plural form is used, for example; can mean eye or water spring in the singular, but in the plural eyes will take the dual form of whilst springs are . Adjectives, verbs, and pronouns have only singular and plural, with the plural forms of these being used with dual nouns.

===Modern Hebrew===
In Modern Hebrew as used in Israel, there is also a dual number, but its use is very restricted. The dual form is usually used in expressions of time and number. These nouns have plurals as well, which are used for numbers higher than two, for example:

The pseudo-dual is used to form the plural of some body parts, garments, etc., for instance:

:   (&quot;leg&quot;) →   (&quot;legs&quot;)
:   (&quot;ear&quot;) →   (&quot;ears&quot;)
:   (&quot;tooth&quot;) →   (&quot;teeth&quot;)
:   (&quot;intestine&quot;) →   (&quot;intestines&quot;)
:   (&quot;shoe&quot;) →   (&quot;shoes&quot;)
:   (&quot;sock&quot;) →   (&quot;socks&quot;)

In this case, even if there are more than two, the dual is still used, for instance יש לכלב ארבע רגליים (&quot;a dog has four legs&quot;).

Another case of the pseudo-dual is &quot;duale tantum&quot; (a kind of plurale tantum) nouns:

:   (&quot;colon&quot;, lit. &quot;two dots&quot;)
:   (&quot;bicycle&quot;, lit. &quot;two wheels&quot;)
:   (&quot;eyeglasses&quot;, lit. &quot;two lenses&quot;)
:   (&quot;sky&quot;)
:   (&quot;scissors&quot;)

==Khoe languages==
In Nama, nouns have three genders and three grammatical numbers.

The non-Khoe Khoesan languages (Tuu and Kx&#x27;a), do not have dual number marking of nouns.

== In Indo-European languages ==
The category of dual can be reconstructed for Proto-Indo-European, the ancestor of all Indo-European languages, and it has been retained as a fully functioning category in the earliest attested daughter languages. The best evidence for the dual among ancient Indo-European languages can be found in Old Indo-Iranian (Vedic Sanskrit and Avestan), Homeric Greek and Old Church Slavonic, where its use was obligatory for all inflected categories including verbs, nouns, adjectives, pronouns and some numerals. Various traces of dual can also be found in Gothic, Old Irish, and Latin (more below).

Due to the scarcity of evidence, the reconstruction of dual endings for Proto-Indo-European is difficult, but at least formally according to the comparative method it can be ascertained that no more than three dual endings are reconstructible for nominal inflection. reconstruct the dual endings as:
* Nominative/accusative/vocative: *-h₁(e)
* Genitive/ablative: *-h₁(e) / *-oHs
* Dative: *-me / *-OH
* Locative: *-h₁ow
* Instrumental: *-bʰih₁

The Proto-Indo-European category of dual did not only denote two of something: it could also be used as an associative marker, the so-called &quot;elliptical dual&quot;. For example, the Vedic deity Mitrá, when appearing in dual form &quot;Mitrā́&quot;, refers to both Mitra and his companion Varuṇa. Homeric dual refers to Ajax the Greater and his fighting companion Teucer, and Latin plural is used to denote both the semi-god Castor and his twin brother Pollux.

Beside nominal (nouns, adjectives and pronouns), the dual was also present in verbal inflection where the syncretism was much lower.

Of living Indo-European languages, the dual can be found in dialects of Scottish Gaelic, but fully functioning as a paradigmatic category only in Slovene, and Sorbian. 
Remnants of the dual can be found in many of the remaining daughter languages, where certain forms of the noun are used with the number two (see below for examples).

===Sanskrit===
The dual is widely used in Sanskrit, as noted above. Its use is mandatory when the number of objects is two, and the plural is not permitted in this case, with one exception (see below). It is always indicated by the declensional suffix (and some morphophonemic modifications to the root resulting from addition of the suffix).

For nouns, the dual forms are the same in the following sets of cases, with examples for the masculine noun (boy):
* nominative/accusative: bālau
* instrumental/dative/ablative: bālābhyām
* genitive/locative: bālayoḥ

In Sanskrit, adjectives are treated the same as nouns as far as case declensions are concerned. As for pronouns, the same rules apply, except for a few special forms used in some cases.

Verbs have distinct dual forms in the three persons in both the ātmanepada and parasmaipada forms of verbs. For instance, the root pac meaning &quot;to cook&quot;, takes the following forms in the dual number of the present tense, called laṭ lakāra:
(In Sanskrit, the order of the persons is reversed.)

The one exception to the rigidness about dual number is in the case of the pronoun asmad (I/we): Sanskrit grammar permits one to use the plural number for asmad even if the actual number of objects denoted is one or two (this is similar to the &quot;royal we&quot;). For example, while &quot;ahaṃ bravīmi&quot;, &quot;āvāṃ brūvaḥ&quot; and &quot;vayaṃ brūmaḥ&quot; are respectively the singular, dual and plural forms of &quot;I say&quot; and &quot;we say&quot;, &quot;vayaṃ brūmaḥ&quot; can be used in the singular and dual sense as well.

===Greek===
The dual can be found in Ancient Greek Homeric texts such as the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, although its use is only sporadic, owing as much to artistic prerogatives as dictional and metrical requirements within the hexametric meter. There were only two distinct forms of the dual in Ancient Greek.

In classical Greek, the dual was lost, except in the Attic dialect of Athens, where it persisted until the fifth century BC. Even in this case, its use depended on the author and certain stock expressions.

In Koine Greek and Modern Greek, the only remnant of the dual is the numeral for &quot;two&quot;, , , which has lost its genitive and dative cases (both , ) and retains its nominative/accusative form. Thus it appears to be undeclined in all cases. Nevertheless, Aristophanes of Byzantium, the foremost authority of his time (early 2nd century BC) on grammar and style, and a staunch defender of &quot;proper&quot; High Attic tradition, admonishes those who write &#x27; (&#x27;) (dative, plural number) rather than the &quot;correct&quot; &#x27; (&#x27;) (dative, dual number).

===Latin===
The dual was lost in Latin and its sister Italic languages. However, certain fossilized forms remained, for example, (twenty), but (thirty), the words / (both, compare Slavic / from earlier *abō / *abāi), / with a dual declension.

===Celtic languages===
Reconstructed Proto-Celtic nominal and adjectival declensions contain distinct dual forms; pronouns and verbs do not. In Old Irish, nouns and the definite article still have dual forms, but only when accompanied by the numeral &quot;&quot; &quot;two&quot;. Traces of the dual remain in Middle Welsh, in nouns denoting pairs of body parts that incorporate the numeral two: e.g. (from &quot;knee&quot;), (from &quot;ear&quot;).

In the modern languages, there are still significant remnants of dual number in Irish and Scottish Gaelic in nominal phrases containing the numeral or (including the higher numerals 12, 22, etc.). As the following table shows, and combines with a singular noun, which is lenited. Masculine nouns take no special inflection, but feminine nouns have a slenderized dual form, which is in fact identical to the dative singular.

Languages of the Brythonic branch do not have dual number. As mentioned above for Middle Welsh, some nouns can be said to have dual forms, prefixed with a form of the numeral &quot;two&quot; (Breton , Welsh , Cornish ). This process is not fully productive, however, and the prefixed forms are semantically restricted. For example, Breton (&lt; &quot;hand&quot;) can only refer to one person&#x27;s pair of hands, not any two hands from two different people. Welsh must refer to a period of two consecutive months, whereas can be any two months (compare &quot;fortnight&quot; in English as opposed to &quot;two weeks&quot; or &quot;14 days&quot;; the first must, but the second and third need not, be a single consecutive period).
The modern Welsh term (= hands) is formed by adding the feminine (and conjoining) form of &#x27;two&#x27; () with the word for &#x27;hand&#x27; — becoming as it is no longer in a stressed syllable.

===Old, Middle, and Modern English===

In Proto-Germanic, the dual had been entirely lost in nouns, and since verbs agreed with nouns in number, the third person dual form of verbs was also lost. The dual therefore remained only in the first and second person pronouns and their accompanying verb forms. Old English further lost all remaining dual verbs, keeping only first and second person dual pronouns. The Old English first person dual pronoun was in the nominative and in the accusative, and the second person equivalents were and respectively. The West Saxon dialect also had the genitive forms of for first person and for second person. The dual lasted beyond Old English into the Early Middle English period in the Southern and Midland dialects. Middle English saw evolve into , and can be seen in various different forms including , , , , and . The dual mostly died out in the early 1200s, surviving to around 1300 only in the East Midland dialect.

In a small number of modern English dialects, dual pronouns have independently returned. These include:

*Australian Aboriginal English (Central) - &quot;menyou&quot; (first person inclusive), &quot;mentwofella&quot; (first person exclusive), &quot;yountwofella&quot; (second person), &quot;twofella&quot; (third person) 
*Australian Aboriginal English (Northwest Queensland) - &quot;midubela&quot; or &quot;minabela&quot; (first person), &quot;yudubela&quot; or &quot;yunabela&quot; (second person), &quot;dattufela&quot; or &quot;distufela&quot; (third person) 
*Torres Strait English - &quot;mitu&quot; (first person), &quot;yutu&quot; (second person), &quot;themtu&quot; (third person) 
*Palmerston Island English - &quot;yumi&quot; (first person inclusive), &quot;himshe&quot; (third person)

===Other Germanic languages===
Gothic retained the dual more or less unchanged from Proto-Germanic. It had markings for the first and second person for both the verbs and pronouns, for example &quot;we two&quot; as compared to &quot;we, more than two&quot;. Old Norse and other old Germanic languages, like Old English, had dual marking only in the personal pronouns and not in the verbs.

The dual has disappeared as a productive form in all the living languages, with loss of the dual occurring in North Frisian dialects only quite recently. In Austro-Bavarian, the old dual pronouns have replaced the standard plural pronouns: nominative , accusative (from Proto-Germanic  and , ). A similar development in the pronoun system can be seen in Icelandic and Faroese. Another remnant of the dual can be found in the use of the pronoun (&quot;both&quot;) in the Scandinavian languages of Norwegian and Danish, in Swedish and in Faroese and Icelandic. In these languages, in order to state &quot;all + number&quot;, the constructions are / (&quot;all two&quot;) but / (&quot;all three&quot;). In German, the expression (&quot;both&quot;) is equivalent to, though more commonly used than, (&quot;all two&quot;).

Norwegian Nynorsk also retains the conjunction (&quot;one of two&quot;) and its inverse (&quot;neither of two&quot;).

A remnant of a lost dual also survives in the Icelandic and Faroese ordinals first and second, which can be translated two ways: First there is and , which mean the first and second of two respectively, while and mean first and second of more than two. In Icelandic the pronouns (&quot;one&quot;) and (&quot;other&quot;) are also used to denote each unit of a set of two in contrast to the pronouns (&quot;one&quot;) and (&quot;second&quot;). Therefore in Icelandic &quot;with one hand&quot; translates as not , and as in English &quot;with the other hand&quot; is . An additional element in Icelandic worth mentioning are the interrogative pronouns (&quot;who / which / what&quot; of two) and (&quot;who / which / what&quot; of more than two).

===Baltic languages===
Among the Baltic languages, the dual form existed but is now nearly obsolete in standard Lithuanian. The dual form was still used on two-litas coins issued in 1925, but the plural form () is used on later two-litas coins.

=== Slavic languages ===
Common Slavic had a complete singular-dual-plural number system, although the nominal dual paradigms showed considerable syncretism, just as they did in Proto-Indo-European. Dual was fully operable at the time of Old Church Slavonic manuscript writings, and it has been subsequently lost in most Slavic dialects in the historical period.

Of the extant Slavic languages, only Slovene, Chakavian and certain Kajkavian dialects, and Sorbian have preserved the dual number as a productive form. In all of the remaining languages, its influence is still found in the declension of nouns of which there are commonly only two: eyes, ears, shoulders, in certain fixed expressions, and the agreement of nouns when used with numbers.

In all the languages, the words &quot;two&quot; and &quot;both&quot; preserve characteristics of the dual declension. The following table shows a selection of forms for the numeral &quot;two&quot;:


Notes:
# In some Slavic languages, there is a further distinction between animate and inanimate masculine nouns. In Polish, for animate masculine nouns, the possible nominative forms are , or .
# Variant form for the masculine/neuter locative and instrumental in Serbo-Croatian: / .

In Common Slavic, the rules were relatively simple for determining the appropriate case and number form of the noun, when it was used with a numeral. The following rules apply:
# With the numeral &quot;one&quot;, both the noun, adjective, and numeral were in the same singular case, with the numeral being declined as an pronoun.
# With the numeral &quot;two&quot;, both the noun, adjective, and numeral were in the same dual case. There were separate forms for the masculine and neuter-feminine nouns.
# With the numerals &quot;three&quot; and &quot;four&quot;, the noun, adjective, and numeral were in the same plural case.
# With any numeral above &quot;four&quot;, the numeral was followed by the noun and adjective in the genitive plural case. The numeral itself was actually a numeral noun that was declined according to its syntactic function.

With the loss of the dual in most of the Slavic languages, the above pattern now is only seen in the forms of the numbers for the tens, hundreds, and rarely thousands. This can be seen by examining the following table:

The Common Slavic rules governing the declension of nouns after numerals, which were described above, have been preserved in Slovene. In those Slavic languages that have lost the dual, the system has been simplified and changed in various ways, but many languages have kept traces of the dual in it. In general, Czech, Slovak, Polish and Ukrainian have extended the pattern of &quot;three/four&quot; to &quot;two&quot;; Russian, Belarusian and Serbo-Croatian have, on the contrary, extended the pattern of &quot;two&quot; to &quot;three/four&quot;; and Bulgarian and Macedonian have extended the pattern of &quot;two&quot; to all numerals. The resulting systems are as follows:
# In Czech, Slovak, Polish and Ukrainian, numerals from &quot;two&quot; to &quot;four&quot; are always followed by a noun in the same plural case, but higher numerals (if in the nominative) are followed by a noun in the genitive plural.
# In Belarusian and Serbo-Croatian, numerals from &quot;two&quot; to &quot;four&quot; (if in the nominative) are followed by a noun in a form originating from the Common Slavic nominative dual, which has now completely or almost completely merged with the nominative plural (in the case of Belarusian) or genitive singular (in the case of Serbo-Croatian). Higher numerals are followed by a noun in the genitive plural.
# In Russian, the form of noun following the numeral is nominative singular if the numeral ends in &quot;one&quot;, genitive singular if the numeral ends in &quot;two&quot; to &quot;four&quot;, and genitive plural otherwise. As an exception, the form of noun is also genitive plural if the numeral ends in 11 to 14. Also, some words (for example, many measure words, such as units) have a special &quot;count form&quot; (счётная форма) for use in numerical phrases instead of genitive (for some words mandatory, for others optional), for example, восемь мегабайт, пять килограмм and пять килограммов, три ряда́ and три ря́да, and полтора часа́.
# In Bulgarian and Macedonian, all numerals are followed by a noun in a form originating from the Common Slavic nominative dual, which has now been re-interpreted as a &quot;count form&quot; or &quot;quantitative plural&quot;.

These different systems are exemplified in the table below where the word &quot;wolf&quot; is used to form nominative noun phrases with various numerals. The dual and forms originating from it are underlined.

The dual has also left traces in the declension of nouns describing body parts that humans customarily had two of, for example: eyes, ears, legs, breasts, and hands. Often the plural declension is used to give a figurative meaning. The table below summarizes the key such points.

==== Slovene ====

Along with the Sorbian languages, Chakavian, some Kajkavian dialects, and the extinct Old Church Slavonic, Slovene uses the dual. Although popular sources claim that Slovene has &quot;preserved full grammatical use of the dual,&quot; Standard Slovene (and, to varying degrees, Slovene dialects) show significant reduction of the dual number system when compared with Common Slavic. In general, dual forms have a tendency to be replaced by plural forms. This tendency is stronger in oblique cases than in the nominative/accusative: in standard Slovene, genitive and locative forms have merged with the plural, and in many dialects, pluralization has extended to dative/instrumental forms. Dual inflection is better preserved in masculine forms than in feminine forms. Natural pairs are usually expressed with the plural in Slovene, not with the dual: e.g. &quot;hands&quot;, ears. The dual forms of such nouns can be used, in conjunction with the quantifiers &quot;two&quot; or &quot;both&quot;, to emphasize the number: e.g. &quot;I only have two hands&quot;. The words for &quot;parents&quot; and &quot;twins&quot; show variation in colloquial Slovene between plural (, ) and dual (, ). Standard Slovene has replaced the nominative dual pronouns of Common Slavic ( &quot;the two of us&quot;, &quot;the two of you&quot;, &quot;the two of them&quot; [m./f./n.]) with new synthetic dual forms: (literally, &quot;we-two&quot;), , .

Nominative case of noun &quot;wolf&quot;, with and without numerals:

The dual is recognised by many Slovene speakers as one of the most distinctive features of the language and a mark of recognition, and is often mentioned in tourist brochures.

For verbs, the endings in the present tense are given as , , . The table below shows a comparison of the conjugation of the verb , which means &quot;to do, to make, to work&quot; and belongs to Class IV in the singular, dual, and plural.

In the imperative, the endings are given as for the first-person dual and for the second-person dual. The table below shows the imperative forms for the verb (&quot;to walk&quot;) in the first and second persons of the imperative (the imperative does not exist for first-person singular).

==== Sorbian language ====
As in Slovenian, the Sorbian language (both dialects Upper and Lower Sorbian) has preserved the dual. For nouns, the following endings are used:

# The genitive form is based on the plural form of the noun.
# The -e ending causes various softening changes to occur to the preceding constant, for further information see the article on Sorbian.

For example, the declension of &quot;sin&quot; (masculine) and &quot;crow&quot; (feminine) in the dual in Upper Sorbian would be given as

For verbs, the endings in the present tense are given as , , . The table below shows a comparison of the conjugation of the verb , which means &quot;to write&quot; and belongs to Class I in the singular, dual, and plural.

<text>George Peter Anthan (June 2, 1936 – August 17, 2016) was an American journalist. He was the Washington Bureau Chief for the &quot;Des Moines Register&quot;. 

== Biography ==
Anthan was born in St. Joseph, Missouri, in 1936, and was a graduate of the University of Kansas School of Journalism.

He spent his early career reporting in Valley Junction and Des Moines, Iowa, for the &quot;Des Moines Tribune&quot;. In 1971, he joined the &quot;Register&quot;″s prestigious Washington, D.C., bureau. There he covered agriculture, food safety, and farm policy issues for 30 years.

Anthan stated, &quot;My credentials for covering agriculture were established in my first several weeks working for the &quot;Des Moines Register&quot; when I was assigned to cover the Iowa State Fair. And immediately—which is a treasured assignment, since the book &quot;State Fair&quot; was written by a &quot;Des Moines Register&quot; reporter — and I immediately identified in the caption some purebred swine as Herefords. It was the only time in my 40-some-year career at the &quot;Des Moines Register&quot; that I heard the words, &#x27;Stop the presses.&#x27;&quot;

Anthan used an Underwood and then an IBM Selectric II typewriter for most of his career. 

== Personal life and death ==
An avid bicyclist, Anthan rode his bike between his home in suburban Maryland and his office in the National Press Building for 30 years, logging over 100,000 miles in all. A close friend, Donald Kaul, lured Anthan back to Iowa each year beginning in 1974 to ride his bicycle across the state in RAGBRAI, now the world&#x27;s largest bicycle ride, which Kaul and John Karras started in 1973.

Anthan was a member of the Gridiron Club. 

He died on August 17, 2016, at the age of 80 from cardiac arrest. He was survived by his wife Ann Anthan, a Missouri native, lover of dogs, and road racing enthusiast.

== Awards ==
Anthan was the winner of several awards for outstanding journalism, including the Raymond Clapper Memorial Award (three times) and National Press Club awards. He was twice a Pulitzer Prize finalist. Anthan also won an Alicia Patterson Journalism Fellowship
 in 2004 to research and write about the de-population of the northern Great Plains.

<doc id="158240" wikidata="Q620840" url="?curid=158240" title="Appendectomy">
<text>An appendectomy (American English) or appendicectomy (British English) is a surgical operation in which the vermiform appendix (a portion of the intestine) is removed. Appendectomy is normally performed as an urgent or emergency procedure to treat complicated acute appendicitis.

Appendectomy may be performed laparoscopically (as minimally invasive surgery) or as an open operation. Over the 2010s, surgical practice has increasingly moved towards routinely offering laparoscopic appendicectomy; for example in the United Kingdom over 95% of adult appendicectomies are planned as laparoscopic procedures. Laparoscopy is often used if the diagnosis is in doubt, or in order to leave a less visible surgical scar. Recovery may be slightly faster after laparoscopic surgery, although the laparoscopic procedure itself is more expensive and resource-intensive than open surgery and generally takes longer. Advanced pelvic sepsis occasionally requires a lower midline laparotomy.

Complicated (perforated) appendicitis should undergo prompt surgical intervention. There has been significant recent trial evidence that uncomplicated appendicitis can be treated with either antibiotics or appendicectomy, with 51% of those treated with antibiotics avoiding an appendectomy after 3 years. After appendicectomy the main difference in treatment is the length of time the antibiotics are administered. For uncomplicated appendicitis, antibiotics should be continued up to 24 hours post-operatively. For complicated appendicitis, antibiotics should be continued for anywhere between 3 and 7 days. An interval appendectomy is generally performed 6–8 weeks after conservative management with antibiotics for special cases, such as perforated appendicitis. Delay of appendectomy 24 hours after admission for symptoms of appendicitis has not been shown to increase the risk of perforation or other complications.

==Procedure==


In general terms, the procedure for an open appendectomy is:
# Antibiotics are given immediately if signs of actual sepsis are seen (in appendicitis, sepsis and bacteremia usually only occurs at some point after rupture, once peritonitis has begun), or if there is reasonable suspicion that the appendix has ruptured (e.g., on imaging) or if the onset of peritonitis - which will lead to full sepsis if not quickly treated- is suspected; otherwise, a single dose of prophylactic intravenous antibiotics is given immediately before surgery.
# General anaesthesia is induced, with endotracheal intubation and full muscle relaxation, and the patient is positioned supine.
# The abdomen is prepared and draped and is examined under anesthesia.
# If a mass is present, the incision is made over the mass. Otherwise, the incision is made over McBurney&#x27;s point (one-third of the way from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus), which represents the most common position of the base of the appendix.
# The various layers of the abdominal wall are opened. To preserve the integrity of abdominal wall, the external oblique aponeurosis is split along the line of its fibers, as is the internal oblique muscle. As the two run at right angles to each other, this reduces the risk of later incisional hernia.
# On entering the peritoneum, the appendix is identified, mobilized, and then ligated and divided at its base.
# Some surgeons choose to bury the stump of the appendix by inverting it so it points into the caecum.
# Each layer of the abdominal wall is then closed in turn.
# The skin may be closed with staples or stitches.
# The wound is dressed.
# The patient is brought to the recovery room.

===Incisions===
The standardization of an incision is not best practice when performing an appendectomy given that the appendix is a mobile organ. A physical exam should be performed prior to the operation and the incision should be chosen based on the point of maximal tenderness to palpation.

These incisions are placed for appendectomy:
# McBurney&#x27;s incision, also known as grid iron incision
# Lanz incision
# Rutherford Morison incision
# Paramedian incision
Over the past decade, the outcomes of laparoscopic appendectomies have compared favorably to those for open appendectomies because of decreased pain, fewer postoperative complications, shorter hospitalization, earlier mobilization, earlier return to work, and better cosmesis; however, despite these advantages, efforts are still being made to decrease abdominal incision and visible scars after laparoscopy. Recent research has led to the development of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES); however, numerous difficulties need to be overcome before a wider clinical application of NOTES is adopted, including complications such as the opening of hollow viscera, failed sutures, a lack of fully developed instrumentation, and the necessity of reliable cost-benefit analyses.

Many surgeons have attempted to reduce incisional morbidity and improve cosmetic outcomes in laparoscopic appendectomy by using fewer and smaller ports. Kollmar&quot; et al.&quot; described moving laparoscopic incisions to hide them in the natural camouflages like the suprapubic hairline to improve cosmesis. Additionally, reports in the literature indicate that minilaparoscopic appendectomy using 2– or 3-mm or even smaller instruments along with one 12-mm port minimizes pain and improves cosmesis. More recently, studies by Ates &quot;et al.&quot; and Roberts &quot;et al.&quot; have described variants of an sling-based single-port laparoscopic appendectomy with good clinical results.

Also, a trend is increasing towards single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS), using a special multiport umbilical trocar. With SILS, a more conventional view of the field of surgery is seen compared to NOTES. The equipment used for SILS is familiar to surgeons already doing laparoscopic surgery. Most importantly, it is easy to convert SILS to conventional laparoscopy by adding a few trocars; this conversion to conventional laparoscopy is called &#x27;port rescue&#x27;. SILS has been shown to be feasible, reasonably safe, and cosmetically advantageous, compared to standard laparoscopy; however, this newer technique involves specialized instruments and is more difficult to learn because of a loss of triangulation, clashing of instruments, crossing of instruments (cross triangulation), and a lack of maneuverability. The additional problem of decreased exposure and the added financial burden of procuring special articulating or curved coaxial instruments exist. SILS is still evolving, being used successfully in many centres, but with some way to go before it becomes mainstream. This limits its widespread use, especially in rural or peripheral centres with limited resources.

== Pediatric patients ==

Pediatric patients have a mobile cecum, which allows externalization of the cecal appendix through the umbilicus in most cases. This has led to the development of surgical techniques such as laparoscopic-assisted transumbilical appendectomy, which allows the entire surgery to be performed with a single umbilical incision and has significant advantages in terms of both recovery and aesthetic outcome.
== Pregnancy ==
Appendicitis is the most common emergent general surgery related problem to arise during pregnancy. There is a natural elevation in white blood cell count in addition to anatomical changes of the appendix that occur during pregnancy. These findings, in addition to non-specific abdominal symptoms make appendicitis difficult to diagnose. Appendicitis develops most commonly in the second trimester. If appendicitis develops in a pregnant woman, an appendectomy is usually performed and should not harm the fetus. The risk of premature delivery is about 10%. The risk of fetal death in the perioperative period after an appendectomy for early acute appendicitis is 3 to 5%. The risk of fetal death is 20% in perforated appendicitis.

There has been debate regarding which surgical approach is preferred during pregnancy. Overall, there is no increased risk of fetal loss or preterm delivery with the laparoscopic approach (LA) as compared to the open approach (OA). However, the LA was associated with shorter length of stay in the hospital as well as reduced risk of wound infection.

Patient positioning is of utmost importance to ensure safety of the fetus during the procedure. This is especially important during the third trimester due to the potential of compression of the inferior vena cava leading by the enlarged uterus. Placing the patient in a 30-degree left lateral decubitus position alleviates this pressure and prevents fetal distress.

One area of concern related to the LA during pregnancy is pneumoperitoneum. This causes an increase in the intra-abdominal pressure, leading to decreased venous return and therefore, decreased cardiac output. The decreased cardiac output may lead to fetal acidosis and cause distress. However, an animal pregnancy model demonstrated that a 10-12mmHg insufflation pressure demonstrated no adverse effects on the fetus. SAGES (Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons) currently recommends an insufflation pressure of 10-15mmHg during pregnancy.

==Recovery==

A study from 2010 found that the average hospital stay for people with appendicitis in the United States was 1.8 days. For people with a perforated (ruptured) appendix, the average length of stay was 5.2 days.

Recovery time from the operation varies from person to person. Some take up to three weeks before being completely active; for others, it can be a matter of days. In the case of a laparoscopic operation, the patient has three stapled scars of about an inch (2.5 cm) in length, between the navel and pubic hair line. When an open appendectomy has been performed, the patient has a 2– to 3-inch (5–7.5 cm) scar, which will initially be heavily bruised.

== Complications ==
One of the most common post-operative complications associated with an appendectomy is the development of a surgical site infection (SSI). Signs and symptoms indicative of a superficial SSI are redness, swelling, and tenderness surrounding the incision and are most likely to arise on post-operative day 4 or 5. These symptoms oftentimes precede fluid drainage from the incision. Tenderness extending beyond the redness that surrounds the incision, in addition to the development of cutaneous vesicles or bullae may be indicative of a deep SSI.

Patients with complicated appendicitis (perforated appendicitis) are more likely to develop a SSI, abdominal abscess, or pelvic abscess during the post-operative period. Placement of an abdominal drain was originally thought to reduce the risk of these post-operative complications. However, abdominal drains have not been found to play a significant role in reducing SSIs and have led to increased length of stay in the hospital in addition to increased cost of the operation.

==Frequency==
About 327,000 appendectomies were performed during U.S. hospital stays in 2011, a rate of 10.5 procedures per 10,000 population. Appendectomies accounted for 2.1% of all operating-room procedures in 2011.

== History ==

The first recorded successful appendectomy was performed in September 1731 by English surgeon William Cookesley on Abraham Pike, a chimney sweep. The second was on December 6, 1735, at St. George&#x27;s Hospital in London, when French surgeon Claudius Amyand described the presence of a perforated appendix within the inguinal hernial sac of an 11-year-old boy. The organ had apparently been perforated by a pin the boy had swallowed. The patient, Hanvil Andersen, made a recovery and was discharged a month later.

Harry Hancock performed the first abdominal surgery for appendicitis in 1848, but he did not remove the appendix. In 1889 in New York City, Charles McBurney described the presentation and pathogenesis of appendicitis accurately and developed the teaching that an early appendectomy was the best treatment to avoid perforation and peritonitis.

Some cases of autoappendectomies have occurred. One was attempted by Evan O&#x27;Neill Kane in 1921, but the operation was completed by his assistants. Another was Leonid Rogozov, who in 1961 had to perform the operation on himself as he was the only doctor on a remote Antarctic base.

On September 13, 1980, Kurt Semm performed the first laparoscopic appendectomy, opening up the path for a much wider application of minimally invasive surgery.

==Cost==

===United States===
While appendectomy is a standard surgical procedure, its cost has been found to vary considerably in the United States. A 2012 study analyzed 2009 data from nearly 20,000 adult patients treated for appendicitis in California hospitals. Researchers examined &quot;only uncomplicated episodes of acute appendicitis&quot; that involved &quot;visits for patients 18 to 59 years old with hospitalization that lasted fewer than four days with routine discharges to home.&quot; The lowest charge for removal of an appendix was $1,529 and the highest $182,955, almost 120 times greater. The median charge was $33,611. While the study was limited to California, the researchers indicated that the results were applicable anywhere in the United States. Many, but not all, patients are covered by some sort of medical insurance.

A study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that in 2010, the average cost for a stay in the United States involving appendicitis was $7,800. For stays where the appendix had ruptured, the average cost was $12,800. The majority of patients seen in the hospital were covered by private insurance.

<doc id="158242" wikidata="Q712729" url="?curid=158242" title="Paul Lincke">
<text>Carl Emil Paul Lincke (7 November 1866 – 3 September 1946) was a German composer and theater conductor. He is considered the &quot;father&quot; of the Berlin operetta. His well-known compositions include &quot;&quot; (&quot;Berlin Air&quot;), the unofficial anthem of Berlin, from his operetta &quot;Frau Luna&quot;; and &quot;The Glow-Worm&quot;, from his operetta &quot;Lysistrata&quot;.

==Early life==
Lincke was born on 7 November 1866 in the Jungfernbrücke district of Berlin. He was the son of magistrate August Lincke and his wife Emilie. His father played the violin in several small orchestras. When Paul was only five years old his father died. Emilie moved with her three children to Adalbertstaße, and later to Eisenbahnstraße, near Lausitzer Platz.

Lincke&#x27;s early musical inclinations were towards military music. His mother sent him after the completion of secondary school education to Wittenberge. Here he was trained in the Wittenberg City Band under Rudolf Kleinow as a bassoonist. He also learned to play the tenor horn, the drums, the piano and the violin.

==Career==
===Performance and early compositions===
Instead of pursuing a career as a military musician, Lincke secured employment as a bassoonist at Berlin&#x27;s Central Theatre, under Adolf Ernst. After one year, he joined the orchestra of the Ostend Theatre.

In entertainment and dance music Lincke gained valuable experience at the Königsstädtischen Theater, the Belle-Alliance-Theater and the Parodie-Theater. He accompanied the musical vaudeville programs and provided his own compositions for popular singers. His &quot;&quot; (&quot;Venus on Earth&quot;), a revue-like one-act play was created in 1897 at the Apollo Theater in Friedrichstraße.

===Success with &quot;&quot;===
For two years, Paul Lincke worked at the most famous European vaudeville house, the Folies Bergère in Paris. He then returned with new compositions to the Apollo-Theater where, with huge success in 1899 &#x27; (Mrs Moon) was premiered. That same year, followed &#x27; (In the Realm of Indra), and in 1902 the operetta &quot;Lysistrata&quot;. The librettos of these were by Heinrich Bolten-Baeckers.

In 1908 Paul Lincke became principal conductor and composer for the , whose spectacular revues were the capital&#x27;s biggest attraction.

===During the Nazi regime and World War II===
With the Nazi rise to power in 1933, Lincke maintained his position and was feted by the Nazi regime. In 1937 he was awarded the Silver Medal of Honour of his native city, on his 75th birthday he was made an honorary citizen of Berlin.

His operetta &quot;Frau Luna&quot; (Mrs. Moon) was turned into starring Lizzi Waldmüller, Irene von Meyendorff and Georg Alexander and directed by Theo Lingen in 1941.

In 1943 Lincke toured Marienbad, Bohemia, to conduct &quot;, whose first performance in 1899 is now regarded as the birth of the Berlin operetta. During his absence, his house and his music publisher in Berlin were bombed.

After the war ended, Lincke wanted to return to Berlin. He strove in vain to obtain the approval of the Allies, which, as a native Berliner, he was required to have at that time. With the help of one American General Pierce, he moved first to Arzberg, Bavaria, with his housekeeper Johanna Hildebrandt, who had worked for him for 35 years.

Lincke&#x27;s ailing health was worsened by the climate there, and he moved again to Hahnenklee. He died there shortly before his 80th birthday. His funeral was held in Hahnenklee, where his grave is still maintained today.

==Personal life==
In 1885, while in the orchestra of the Grand Theatre, Lincke fell in love with the 16-year-old soubrette Anna Mueller, whom he married a year later. His wife later celebrated triumphs with the Berlin audience under the name Anna Müller-Lincke.

In 1901 Lincke divorced his first wife, Anna. That same year he met a young actress who was known under the stage name Ellen Sousa. She played in the Friedrich-Wilhelmstädtischen Theater, and enchanted Lincke from the first moment. Sousa at first rejected his advances but Lincke was persistent. Within a few weeks she had visited his home, and they developed a deeply affectionate relationship, leading to her request to be cast to sing at the Apollo Theater. Sousa had hoped the connection would boost her career, but it did not. She became pregnant and left the stage before giving birth to a son. Lincke now demanded that Sousa fulfil her maternal duties and leave stage work. However, three months later Sousa was again singing at the Apollo.

Lincke offered Ellen Sousa marriage in return for her leaving the stage. She in return demanded a cooling-off period to consider her new role as wife and mother. Lincke experienced another wave of success from Paris, leading to him spending many nights out on the social scene, leaving Sousa at home to attend to her maternal commitments. Lincke now pressured Sousa to choose between him or returning to the stage, giving her ten days to think it over while he left town to make a guest appearance. When he returned after six days, Sousa and the child had moved out.

Years later Ellen Sousa married a wholesale merchant, whom she followed to Dresden and who adopted her son without Lincke&#x27;s objection. This was the end of his relationship with Ellen Sousa and his son. From those events came his well-known instrumental waltz &quot; (Spurned Love).

==Legacy==

Lincke&#x27;s march &quot;&quot; (&quot;Berlin Air&quot;) is the unofficial anthem of Berlin. It is one of the traditional encores of the Berlin Philharmonic orchestra. The aria comes from the 1922 revision of Lincke&#x27;s 1899 operetta &#x27;, about a trip to the moon in a hot air balloon, where an adventurous party of prominent Berliners meet Frau Luna and her court. The march was originally from Lincke&#x27;s 1904 two-act burlesque &#x27;.

Other Lincke operettas include &quot;&quot; (&quot;In the Kingdom of Indra&quot;) and &quot;Lysistrata&quot;. The latter includes the song &quot;Das Glühwürmchen,&quot; known in English as &quot;The Glow-Worm&quot;. It was originally translated into English by Lilla Cayley Robinson in the early 20th century, but American lyricist Johnny Mercer later expanded and greatly revised her lyrics. His version was a hit for the Mills Brothers in 1952, and has been performed by many others.

Lincke also composed the wedding dance played in the 1997 movie &quot;Titanic&quot;; it is played while the ship is going down and in the dining room in earlier scenes.

<doc id="158244" wikidata="Q146889" url="?curid=158244" title="Pincer movement">
<text>The pincer movement, or double envelopment, is a military maneuver in which forces simultaneously attack both flanks (sides) of an enemy formation. This classic maneuver has been important throughout the history of warfare.

The pincer movement typically occurs when opposing forces advance towards the center of an army that responds by moving its outside forces to the enemy&#x27;s flanks to surround it. At the same time, a second layer of pincers may attack the more distant flanks to keep reinforcements from the target units.

== Description ==
A full pincer movement leads to the attacking army facing the enemy in front, on both flanks, and in the rear. If attacking pincers link up in the enemy&#x27;s rear, the enemy is encircled. Such battles often end in surrender or destruction of the enemy force, but the encircled force can try to break out. They can attack the encirclement from the inside to escape, or a friendly external force can attack from the outside to open an escape route.

== History ==
The earliest mention of a pincer attack is in a related formation of Padmavyuha or Chakravyuha in the Indian Epic Mahabharata.

Sun Tzu, in &quot;The Art of War&quot; (traditionally dated to the 6th century BC), speculated on the maneuver but advised against trying it for fear that an army would likely run first before the move could be completed. He argued that it was best to allow the enemy a path to escape (or at least the appearance of one), as the target army would fight with more ferocity when surrounded. Still, it would lose formation and be more vulnerable to destruction if shown an avenue of escape.

The maneuver may have first been used at the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC. The historian Herodotus describes how the Athenian general Miltiades deployed 900 Plataean and 10,000 Athenian hoplites in a U-formation with the wings manned much more deeply than the center. His enemy outnumbered him heavily, and Miltiades chose to match the breadth of the Persian battle line by thinning out the center of his forces while reinforcing the wings. In the course of the battle, the weaker central formations retreated, allowing the wings to converge behind the Persian battle line and drive the more numerous but lightly armed Persians to retreat in panic.

The maneuver was used by Alexander the Great at the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC. He launched his attack at the Indian left flank, and the Indian king Porus reacted by sending the cavalry on the right of his formation around in support. Alexander had positioned two cavalry units on the left of his formation, hidden from view, under the command of Coenus and Demitrius. The units were then able to follow Porus&#x27;s cavalry around, trapping them in a classic pincer movement.

A famous example of its use was at the Battle of Cannae in 216 BC, when Hannibal executed the maneuver against the Romans. Military historians cite it as the first successful use of the pincer movement that was recorded in detail, by the Greek historian Polybius.

It was also later used by Khalid ibn al-Walid at the Battle of Walaja in 633, by Alp Arslan at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 (under the name &quot;crescent tactic&quot;) and by Saladin at the Battle of Hattin in 1187.

Genghis Khan used a rudimentary form known colloquially as the &quot;horns&quot; tactic. Two enveloping flanks of horsemen surrounded the enemy, but they usually remained unjoined, leaving the enemy an escape route to the rear. It was key to many of Genghis&#x27;s early victories over other Mongolian tribes.

It was used at the Battle of Mohács by Süleyman the Magnificent in 1526 and by Field Marshal Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld at the Battle of Fraustadt in 1706.

Even in the horse-and-musket era, the maneuver was used across many military cultures. A double envelopment was deployed by the Iranian conqueror Nader Shah at the Battle of Kirkuk (1733) against the Ottomans; the Turco-Persian army, under Nader, flanked the Ottomans on both ends of their line and encircled their centre despite being numerically at a disadvantage. In another battle at Kars in 1745, Nader routed the Ottoman army and subsequently encircled their encampment. The Ottoman army soon after collapsed under the pressure of the encirclement. Also during the Battle of Karnal in 1739, Nader drew out the Mughal army which outnumbered his own force by over six to one, and managed to encircle and defeat a significant contingent of the Mughals in an ambush around Kunjpura village.

Daniel Morgan used it at the Battle of Cowpens in 1781 in South Carolina. Zulu impis used a version of the maneuver that they called the &quot;buffalo horn&quot; formation.

The maneuver was used in the blitzkrieg of the armed forces of Nazi Germany during World War II, developing into a complex, multidisciplinary endeavor. It involved fast movement by mechanized armor, artillery barrages, air force bombardment, and effective radio communications, with the primary objective of destroying enemy command and control chains, undermining enemy troop morale and disrupting supply lines. During the Battle of Kiev (1941) the Axis forces managed to encircle the largest number of soldiers in the history of warfare. Well over half-a-million Soviet soldiers were taken prisoner by the end of the operation.

<text>The Committee of Public Safety () was a committee of the National Convention which formed the provisional government and war cabinet during the Reign of Terror, a violent phase of the French Revolution. Supplementing the Committee of General Defence, created early January 1793, the Committee of Public Safety was created on 6 April 1793 by the National Convention. It was charged with protecting the new republic against its foreign and domestic enemies, fighting the First Coalition and the Vendée revolt. As a wartime measure, the committee was given broad supervisory and administrative powers over the armed forces, judiciary and legislature, as well as the executive bodies and ministers of the convention.

As the committee, restructured in July, raised the defense (&quot;levée en masse&quot;) against the monarchist coalition of European nations and counter-revolutionary forces within France, it became more and more powerful. In December 1793, the Convention formally conferred executive power upon the committee. Among the members, the radical Montagnard Jacobin Maximilien Robespierre was one of the most well-known, though he did not have any special powers or privileges. After the arrest and execution of the rival factions of Hébertists and Dantonists, sentiment in the Convention eventually turned against Robespierre, who was executed in July 1794. In the following Thermidorian Reaction, the committee&#x27;s influence diminished after 15 months and it disappeared on the same day as the National Convention, which was 25 October 1795, but it probably continued till the end of the month.

The French Revolution brought about an immense shift in society in which citizens desired to bring about a new age of critical rationality, egalitarianism, and patriotism amongst French men. Revolutionary ideals were spread throughout France and a belief in democracy and civilian government was heralded as the new era of French civilization. 1793 would bring a new republican constitution, drafted by the National Assembly. The French Constitution of 1793 and its subsequent government would bring sweeping reforms to French politics and the French social order. Major reforms included comprehensive education, the recognition of rights for illegitimate children and improved rights for married women.

The French Constitution of 1793 outlined the prevailing Enlightenment era ideology of the French government at this stage of the revolutionary period. The constitution outlines a right to the resistance of oppression as well as the right to personal liberty. The equality of all French men is detailed as is the structure of the French Republic. The new constitution and the shift into a republican government centered on the National Assembly created the atmosphere for a radicalized governing authority to take power. Members of the French common classes such as the Sans-Culottes turned to radicalism and inspired militant activism among the French populace.

=== Committee of discussion ===
On 5 April 1793, the French military commander and former minister of war General Charles François Dumouriez defected to Austria following the publication of an incendiary letter in which he threatened to march his army on the city of Paris if the National Convention did not accede to his leadership. News of his defection caused alarm in Paris, where imminent defeat by the Austrians and their allies was feared. A widespread belief held that revolutionary France was in immediate peril, threatened not only by foreign armies and by recent revolts in the Vendée, but also by foreign agents who plotted the destruction of the nation from within. Dumouriez&#x27;s defection lent greater credence to this belief. In light of this threat, the Girondin leader Maximin Isnard proposed the creation of a nine-member Committee of Public Safety. Isnard was supported in this effort by Georges Danton, who declared: &quot;This Committee is precisely what we want, a hand to grasp the weapon of the Revolutionary Tribunal&quot;.

After a proposal by Bertrand Barère on 18 March the committee was created on 6 April 1793. Closely associated with the leadership of Danton, it was initially known as the Danton Committee. Danton steered the Committee through the 31 May and 2 June 1793 &quot;journées&quot; that saw the violent expulsion of the Girondins and through the intensifying war in the Vendée. When the committee was recomposed on 10 July 1793, Danton was not included. Nevertheless, he continued to support the centralization of power by the committee.

On 27 July 1793, Maximilien Robespierre was elected to the committee. At this time, the committee was entering a more powerful and active phase, alongside its partner, the Committee of General Security. The role of the Committee of Public Safety included the governance of the war (including the appointment of generals), the appointing of judges and juries for the Revolutionary Tribunal, the provisioning of the armies and the public, the maintenance of public order and oversight of the state bureaucracy.

The committee was also responsible for interpreting and applying the decrees of the National Convention and thus for implementing some of the most stringent policies of the Terror—for instance, the &quot;levée en masse&quot; passed on 23 August 1793, the Law of Suspects passed on 17 September 1793 and the Law of the General Maximum passed on 29 September 1793. The broad and centralized powers of the committee were codified by the Law of 14 Frimaire (also known as the Law of Revolutionary Government) on 4 December 1793.

==== Execution of the Hébertists and Dantonists ====
On 5 December 1793, journalist Camille Desmoulins began publishing &quot;Le Vieux Cordelier&quot; with the approval of Robespierre and the Committee&quot;.&quot; This newspaper was initially aimed against the ultrarevolutionary Hébertist faction, whose extremist demands, anti-religious fervor and propensity for sudden insurrections troubled the committee. However, Desmoulins quickly turned his pen against the Committee of Public Safety and the Committee of General Security, comparing their reign to that of the Roman tyrants chronicled by Tacitus and expounding the indulgent views of the Dantonist faction.

Consequently, though the Hébertists were arrested and executed in March 1794, the Committees had Desmoulins and Danton arrested as well. Hérault de Séchelles, a friend and ally of Danton, was expelled from the Committee of Public Safety, arrested and tried alongside them. On 5 April 1794, the Dantonists went to the guillotine.

=== Committee of rule ===
The elimination of the Hébertists and the Dantonists made evident the strength of the Committees to control and silence opposition. The creation in March 1794 of a General Police Bureau—reporting nominally to the Committee of Public Safety—served to increase the power of the Committee of Public Safety.

However, even as the period later known as the &#x27;Terror&#x27; reached its height and with it the committee&#x27;s political power, discord was growing within the revolutionary government. Members of the Committee of General Security resented the aggressive behavior of the Committee of Public Safety and particularly the encroachment of the General Police Bureau upon their own brief. Arguments within the Committee of Public Safety itself had grown so violent that it relocated its meetings to a more private room to preserve the illusion of agreement. On 21 May 1794 the revolutionary government decided that the judicial system would be centralised, with almost all 
the tribunals in the provinces closed and all the capital trials held in Paris.

The Law of 22 Prairial, proposed by the committee and enacted by the convention on 10 June 1794, went further in establishing the control of the Revolutionary Tribunal and above it the Convention and Committees of Public Safety and General Security. The law enumerated various forms of public enemies, required their denunciation, and severely limited the legal recourse available to those accused. The punishment for all crimes covered under this law was death; from its inception to its removal, more people were condemned to death in Paris than in the entire previous history of the Revolutionary Tribunal. However, this statistic is accentuated by the fact that, as noted previously, all capital trials and sentences were carried out in Paris rather than being scattered across the provinces.

Robespierre, a fervent supporter of the theistic Cult of the Supreme Being, found himself frequently in conflict with anti-religious Committee members Collot d&#x27;Herbois and Billaud-Varenne. Moreover, Robespierre&#x27;s increasingly extensive absences from the Committee due to illness (he all but ceased to attend meetings in June 1794) created the impression among some members that he was isolated and out of touch. Charlotte Robespierre reported in her memoirs that Robespierre had come into conflict with several of the representatives on mission due to their excessive use of violence, which likely also led to the unity of the Committee devolving.

=== Fall of the Committee and aftermath ===
When it became suspected in mid-July 1794 that Robespierre and Saint-Just were planning to strike against their political opponents Joseph Fouché, Jean-Lambert Tallien and Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier (the latter two members of the Committee of General Security), the fragile truce within the government was dissolved. Saint-Just and his fellow Committee of Public Safety member Bertrand Barère attempted to keep the peace between the Committees of Public Safety and General Security. However, Robespierre delivered a speech to the National Convention on 26 July 1794 in which he emphasized the need to &quot;purify&quot; the Committees and &quot;crush all factions&quot;. In a speech to the Jacobin Club that night, he attacked Collot d&#x27;Herbois and Billaud-Varenne, who had refused to allow the printing and distribution of his speech to the convention.

On the following day, 27 July 1794 (9 Thermidor according to the Republican calendar), Saint-Just began to speak before the Convention. However, he was almost immediately interrupted by Tallien and by Billaud-Varenne, who accused him of intending to &quot;murder the Convention&quot;. Barère, Vadier and Stanislas Fréron joined the accusations against Saint-Just and Robespierre. The Convention ordered the arrest of Robespierre, his brother Augustin, and Saint-Just, along with that of their supporters, including Philippe Le Bas and Georges Couthon.

A period of intense civil unrest ensued, during which the members of the Committees of Public Safety and General Security were forced to seek refuge in the convention. The Robespierre brothers, Saint-Just, Le Bas and Couthon ensconced themselves in the , attempting to incite an insurrection. Ultimately, faced with defeat and arrest, Le Bas committed suicide, while Saint-Just, Couthon, and Maximilien and Augustin Robespierre were arrested and guillotined on 28 July 1794.

The ensuing period of upheaval, dubbed the Thermidorian Reaction, saw the repeal of many of the previous year&#x27;s most unpopular laws and the restriction of the Committees of General Security and Public Safety. The Committees ceased to exist under the Constitution of the Year III (1795), which marked the beginning of the Directory.

<doc id="158252" wikidata="Q79822" url="?curid=158252" title="Adam Mickiewicz">
<text>Adam Bernard Mickiewicz (24 December 179826 November 1855) was a Polish poet, dramatist, essayist, publicist, translator and political activist. He is regarded as national poet in Poland, Lithuania and Belarus. He also largely influenced Ukrainian literature. A principal figure in Polish Romanticism, he is one of Poland&#x27;s &quot;Three Bards&quot; () and is widely regarded as Poland&#x27;s greatest poet. He is also considered one of the greatest Slavic and European poets and has been dubbed a &quot;Slavic bard&quot;. A leading Romantic dramatist, he has been compared in Poland and Europe to Byron and Goethe.

He is known chiefly for the poetic drama &quot;Dziady&quot; (&quot;Forefathers&#x27; Eve&quot;) and the national epic poem &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot;. His other influential works include &quot;Konrad Wallenrod&quot; and &quot;Grażyna&quot;. All these served as inspiration for uprisings against the three imperial powers that had partitioned the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth out of existence.

Mickiewicz was born in the Russian-partitioned territories of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which had been part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and was active in the struggle to win independence for his home region. After, as a consequence, spending five years exiled to central Russia, in 1829 he succeeded in leaving the Russian Empire and, like many of his compatriots, lived out the rest of his life abroad. He settled first in Rome, then in Paris, where for a little over three years he lectured on Slavic literature at the Collège de France. He was an activist, striving for a democratic and independent Poland. He died, probably of cholera, at Istanbul in the Ottoman Empire, where he had gone to help organize Polish forces to fight Russia in the Crimean War.

In 1890, his remains were repatriated from Montmorency, Val-d&#x27;Oise, in France, to Wawel Cathedral in Kraków, Poland.

==Life==

===Early years===

Adam Mickiewicz was born on 24 December 1798, either at his paternal uncle&#x27;s estate in Zaosie (now Zavosse) near Navahrudak (in Polish, &quot;Nowogródek&quot;) or in Navahrudak itself in what was then part of the Russian Empire and is now Belarus. The region was on the periphery of Lithuania proper and had been part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania until the Third Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1795). Its upper class, including Mickiewicz&#x27;s family, were either Polish or Polonized. The poet&#x27;s father, Mikołaj Mickiewicz, a lawyer, was a member of the Polish nobility (&quot;szlachta&quot;) and bore the hereditary Poraj coat-of-arms; Adam&#x27;s mother was Barbara Mickiewicz, &quot;née&quot; Majewska. Adam was the second-born son in the family.
Mickiewicz spent his childhood in Navahrudak, initially taught by his mother and private tutors. From 1807 to 1815 he attended a Dominican school following a curriculum that had been designed by the now-defunct Polish Commission of National Education, which had been the world&#x27;s first ministry of education. He was a mediocre student, although active in games, theatricals, and the like.

In September 1815, Mickiewicz enrolled at the Imperial University of Vilnius, studying to be a teacher. After graduating, under the terms of his government scholarship, he taught secondary school at Kaunas from 1819 to 1823.

In 1818, in the Polish-language &#x27; (Wilno Weekly), he published his first poem, &#x27; (&quot;City Winter&quot;). The next few years would see a maturing of his style from sentimentalism/neoclassicism to romanticism, first in his poetry anthologies published in Vilnius in 1822 and 1823; these anthologies included the poem &quot;Grażyna&quot; and the first-published parts (II and IV) of his major work, &quot;Dziady&quot; (&quot;Forefathers&#x27; Eve&quot;). By 1820 he had already finished another major romantic poem, &quot;Oda do młodości&quot; (&quot;Ode to Youth&quot;), but it was considered to be too patriotic and revolutionary for publication and would not appear officially for many years.

About the summer of 1820, Mickiewicz met the love of his life, . They were unable to marry due to his family&#x27;s poverty and relatively low social status; in addition, she was already engaged to Count , whom she would marry in 1821.

===Imprisonment and exile===

In 1817, while still a student, Mickiewicz, Tomasz Zan and other friends had created a secret organization, the Philomaths. The group focused on self-education but had ties to a more radical, clearly pro-Polish-independence student group, the Filaret Association. An investigation of secret student organizations by Nikolay Novosiltsev, begun in early 1823, led to the arrests of a number of students and ex-student activists including Mickiewicz, who was taken into custody and imprisoned at Vilnius&#x27; Basilian Monastery in late 1823 or early 1824 (sources disagree as to the date). After investigation into his political activities, specifically his membership in the Philomaths, in 1824 Mickiewicz was banished to central Russia. Within a few hours of receiving the decree on 22 October 1824, he penned a poem into an album belonging to , the mother of Juliusz Słowacki. (In 1975 this poem was set to music in Polish and Russian by Soviet composer David Tukhmanov.) Mickiewicz crossed the border into Russia about 11 November 1824, arriving in Saint Petersburg later that month. He would spend most of the next five years in Saint Petersburg and Moscow, except for a notable 1824 to 1825 excursion to Odessa, then on to Crimea. That visit, from February to November 1825, inspired a notable collection of sonnets (some love sonnets, and a series known as &quot;Crimean Sonnets&quot;, published a year later).

Mickiewicz was welcomed into the leading literary circles of Saint Petersburg and Moscow, where he became a great favourite for his agreeable manners and an extraordinary talent for poetic improvisation. The year 1828 saw the publication of his poem &quot;Konrad Wallenrod&quot;. Novosiltsev, who recognized its patriotic and subversive message, which had been missed by the Moscow censors, unsuccessfully attempted to sabotage its publication and to damage Mickiewicz&#x27;s reputation.

In Moscow, Mickiewicz met the Polish journalist and novelist Henryk Rzewuski and the Polish composer and piano virtuoso Maria Szymanowska, whose daughter, Celina Szymanowska, Mickiewicz would later marry in Paris, France. He also befriended the great Russian poet Alexander Pushkin and Decembrist leaders including Kondraty Ryleyev. It was thanks to his friendships with many influential individuals that he was eventually able to obtain a passport and permission to leave Russia for Western Europe.

===European travels===

After serving five years of exile to Russia, Mickiewicz received permission to go abroad in 1829. On 1 June that year, he arrived in Weimar in Germany. By 6 June he was in Berlin, where he attended lectures by the philosopher Hegel. In February 1830 he visited Prague, later returning to Weimar, where he received a cordial reception from the writer and polymath Goethe.

He then continued on through Germany all the way to Italy, which he entered via the Alps&#x27; Splügen Pass. Accompanied by an old friend, the poet Antoni Edward Odyniec, he visited Milan, Venice, Florence and Rome. In August that same year (1830) he went to Geneva, where he met fellow Polish Bard Zygmunt Krasiński. During these travels he had a brief romance with , but class differences again prevented his marrying his new love.

Finally about October 1830 he took up residence in Rome, which he declared &quot;the most amiable of foreign cities.&quot; Soon after, he learned about the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising in Poland, but he would not leave Rome until the spring of 1831.

On 19 April 1831 Mickiewicz departed Rome, traveling to Geneva and Paris and later, on a false passport, to Germany, via Dresden and Leipzig arriving about 13 August in Poznań (German name: Posen), then part of the Kingdom of Prussia. It is possible that during these travels he carried communications from the Italian Carbonari to the French underground, and delivered documents or money for the Polish insurgents from the Polish community in Paris, but reliable information on his activities at the time is scarce. Ultimately he never crossed into Russian Poland, where the Uprising was mainly happening; he stayed in German Poland (historically known to Poles as &quot;Wielkopolska&quot;, or Greater Poland), where he was well received by members of the local Polish nobility. He had a brief liaison with at her family estate in Śmiełów. Starting in March 1832, Mickiewicz stayed several months in Dresden, in Saxony, where he wrote the third part of his poem &quot;Dziady&quot;.

===Paris émigré===

On 31 July 1832 he arrived in Paris, accompanied by a close friend and fellow ex-Philomath, the future geologist and Chilean educator Ignacy Domeyko. In Paris, Mickiewicz became active in many Polish émigré groups and published articles in &#x27; (&quot;The Polish Pilgrim&quot;). The fall of 1832 saw the publication, in Paris, of the third part of his &quot;Dziady&quot; (smuggled into partitioned Poland), as well as of &#x27;, which Mickiewicz self-published. During this time, he made acquaintances with his compatriot the composer Frederic Chopin who would be one of Mickiewicz&#x27;s closest friends in Paris. In 1834 he published another masterpiece, his epic poem &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot;.

&quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot;, his longest poetic work, marked the end of his most productive literary period. Mickiewicz would create further notable works, such as &quot;&quot;, 1839–40) and &quot;Zdania i uwagi&quot; (&quot;Thoughts and Remarks&quot;, 1834–40), but neither would achieve the fame of his earlier works. His relative literary silence, beginning in the mid-1830s, has been variously interpreted: he may have lost his talent; he may have chosen to focus on teaching and on political writing and organizing.

On 22 July 1834, in Paris, he married Celina Szymanowska, daughter of composer and concert pianist Maria Agata Szymanowska. They would have six children (two daughters, and Helena; and four sons, , Aleksander, Jan and Józef). Celina later became mentally ill, possibly with a major depressive disorder. In December 1838, marital problems caused Mickiewicz to attempt suicide. Celina would die on 5 March 1855.

Mickiewicz and his family lived in relative poverty, their major source of income being occasional publication of his work – not a very profitable endeavor. They received support from friends and patrons, but not enough to substantially change their situation. Despite spending most of his remaining years in France, Mickiewicz would never receive French citizenship, nor any support from the French government. By the late 1830s he was less active as a writer, and also less visible on the Polish émigré political scene.

In 1838 Mickiewicz became professor of Latin literature at the Lausanne Academy, in Switzerland. His lectures were well received, and in 1840 he was appointed to the newly established chair of Slavic languages and literatures at the Collège de France. Leaving Lausanne, he was made an honorary Lausanne Academy professor.

Mickiewicz would, however, hold the Collège de France post for little more than three years, his last lecture being delivered on 28 May 1844. His lectures were popular, drawing many listeners in addition to enrolled students, and receiving reviews in the press. Some would be remembered much later; his sixteenth lecture, on Slavic theater, &quot;was to become a kind of gospel for Polish theater directors of the twentieth century.&quot;

Over the years he became increasingly possessed by religious mysticism as he fell under the influence of the Polish philosopher Andrzej Towiański, whom he met in 1841. His lectures became a medley of religion and politics, punctuated by controversial attacks on the Catholic Church, and thus brought him under censure by the French government. The messianic element conflicted with Roman Catholic teachings, and some of his works were placed on the Church&#x27;s list of prohibited books, though both Mickiewicz and Towiański regularly attended Catholic mass and encouraged their followers to do so.

In 1846 Mickiewicz severed his ties with Towiański, following the rise of revolutionary sentiment in Europe, manifested in events such as the Kraków Uprising of February 1846. Mickiewicz criticized Towiański&#x27;s passivity and returned to the traditional Catholic Church. In 1847 Mickiewicz befriended American journalist, critic and women&#x27;s-rights advocate Margaret Fuller. In March 1848 he was part of a Polish delegation received in audience by Pope Pius IX, whom he asked to support the enslaved nations and the French Revolution of 1848. Soon after, in April 1848, he organized a military unit, the Mickiewicz Legion, to support the insurgents, hoping to liberate the Polish and other Slavic lands. The unit never became large enough to be more than symbolic, and in the fall of 1848 Mickiewicz returned to Paris and became more active again on the political scene.

In December 1848 he was offered a post at the Jagiellonian University in Austrian-ruled Kraków, but the offer was soon withdrawn after pressure from Austrian authorities. In the winter of 1848–49, Polish composer Frédéric Chopin, in the final months of his own life, visited his ailing compatriot soothed the poet&#x27;s nerves with his piano music. Over a dozen years earlier, Chopin had set two of Mickiewicz&#x27;s poems to music (see Polish songs by Frédéric Chopin).

===Final years===

In the winter of 1849 Mickiewicz founded a French-language newspaper, &quot;La Tribune des Peuples&quot; (&quot;The Peoples&#x27; Tribune&quot;), supported by a wealthy Polish émigré activist, . Mickiewicz wrote over 70 articles for the &quot;Tribune&quot; during its short existence: it came out between 15 March and 10 November 1849, when the authorities shut it down. His articles supported democracy and socialism and many ideals of the French Revolution and of the Napoleonic era, though he held few illusions regarding the idealism of the House of Bonaparte. He supported the restoration of the French Empire in 1851. In April 1852 he lost his post at the Collège de France, which he had been allowed to keep up to that point (though without the right to lecture). On 31 October 1852 he was hired as a librarian at the Bibliothèque de l&#x27;Arsenal. There he was visited by another Polish poet, Cyprian Norwid, who wrote of the meeting in his work &quot;&quot;; and there Mickiewicz&#x27;s wife Celina died.

Mickiewicz welcomed the Crimean War of 1853–1856, which he hoped would lead to a new European order including a restored independent Poland. His last composition, a Latin ode &quot;Ad Napolionem III Caesarem Augustum Ode in Bomersundum captum&quot;, honored Napoleon III and celebrated the British-French victory over Russia at the Battle of Bomarsund in Åland in August 1854. Polish émigrés associated with the Hôtel Lambert persuaded him to become active again in politics. Soon after the Crimean War broke out (October 1853), the French government entrusted him with a diplomatic mission. He left Paris on 11 September 1855, arriving in Constantinople, in the Ottoman Empire, on 22 September. There, working with Michał Czajkowski (Sadyk Pasha), he began organizing Polish forces to fight under Ottoman command against Russia. With his friend Armand Lévy he also set about organizing a Jewish legion. He returned ill from a trip to a military camp to his apartment on Yenişehir Street in the Pera (now Beyoğlu) district of Constantinople and died on 26 November 1855. Though Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński and others have speculated that political enemies might have poisoned Mickiewicz, there is no proof of this, and he probably contracted cholera, which claimed other lives there at the time.

Mickiewicz&#x27;s remains were transported to France, boarding ship on 31 December 1855, and were buried at Montmorency, Val-d&#x27;Oise, on 21 January 1861. In 1890 they were disinterred, moved to Austrian Poland, and on 4 July entombed in the of Kraków&#x27;s Wawel Cathedral, a place of final repose for a number of persons important to Poland&#x27;s political and cultural history.

==Works==
Mickiewicz&#x27;s childhood environment exerted a major influence on his literary work. His early years were shaped by immersion in folklore and by vivid memories, which he later reworked in his poems, of the ruins of Navahrudak Castle and of the triumphant entry and disastrous retreat of Polish and Napoleonic troops during Napoleon&#x27;s 1812 invasion of Russia, when Mickiewicz was just a teenager. The year 1812 also marked his father&#x27;s death. Later, the poet&#x27;s personality and subsequent works were greatly influenced by his four years of living and studying in Vilnius. His first poems, such as the 1818 &quot;Zima miejska&quot; (&quot;City Winter&quot;) and the 1819 &#x27; (&quot;Potato&quot;), were classical in style, influenced by Voltaire. His &quot;Ballads and Romances&quot; and poetry anthologies published in 1822 (including the opening poem &#x27;, &quot;Romanticism&quot;) and 1823 mark the start of romanticism in Poland. Mickiewicz&#x27;s influence popularized the use of folklore, folk literary forms, and historism in Polish romantic literature. His exile to Moscow exposed him to a cosmopolitan environment, more international than provincial Vilnius and Kaunas in Lithuania. This period saw a further evolution in his writing style, with &quot;Sonety&quot; (Sonnets, 1826) and &quot;Konrad Wallenrod&quot; (1828), both published in Russia. The &quot;Sonety&quot;, mainly comprising his &quot;Crimean Sonnets&quot;, highlight the poet&#x27;s ability and desire to write, and his longing for his homeland.

One of his major works, &quot;Dziady&quot; (Forefathers&#x27; Eve), comprises several parts written over an extended period of time. It began with publication of parts II and IV in 1823. Miłosz remarks that it was &quot;Mickiewicz&#x27;s major theatrical achievement&quot;, a work which Mickiewicz saw as ongoing and to be continued in further parts. Its title refers to the pagan ancestor commemoration that had been practiced by Slavic and Baltic peoples on All Souls&#x27; Day. The year 1832 saw the publication of part III: much superior to the earlier parts, a &quot;laboratory of innovative genres, styles and forms&quot;. Part III was largely written over a few days; the &quot;Great Improvisation&quot; section, a &quot;masterpiece of Polish poetry&quot;, is said to have been created during a single inspired night. A long descriptive poem, &quot;Ustęp&quot; (&quot;Digression&quot;), accompanying part III and written sometime before it, sums up Mickiewicz&#x27;s experiences in, and views on, Russia, portrays it as a huge prison, pities the oppressed Russian people, and wonders about their future. Miłosz describes it as a &quot;summation of Polish attitudes towards Russia in the nineteenth century&quot; and notes that it inspired responses from Pushkin (&quot;The Bronze Horseman&quot;) and Joseph Conrad (&quot;Under Western Eyes&quot;). The drama was first staged by Stanisław Wyspiański in 1901, becoming, in Miłosz&#x27;s words, &quot;a kind of national sacred play, occasionally forbidden by censorship because of its emotional impact upon the audience.&quot; The Polish government&#x27;s 1968 closing down of a production of the play sparked the 1968 Polish political crisis.

Mickiewicz&#x27;s &quot;Konrad Wallenrod&quot; (1828), a narrative poem describing battles of the Christian order of Teutonic Knights against the pagans of Lithuania, is a thinly veiled allusion to the long feud between Russia and Poland. The plot involves the use of subterfuge against a stronger enemy, and the poem analyzes moral dilemmas faced by the Polish insurgents who would soon launch the November 1830 Uprising. Controversial to an older generation of readers, &quot;Konrad Wallenrod&quot; was seen by the young as a call to arms and was praised as such by an Uprising leader, poet . Miłosz describes &quot;Konrad Wallenrod&quot; (named for its protagonist) as &quot;the most committed politically of all Mickiewczi&#x27;s poems.&quot; The point of the poem, though obvious to many, escaped the Russian censors, and the poem was allowed to be published, complete with its telling motto drawn from Machiavelli: &quot;Dovete adunque sapere come sono due generazioni di combattere – bisogna essere volpe e leone.&quot; (&quot;Ye shall know that there are two ways of fighting – you must be a fox and a lion.&quot;) On a purely literary level, the poem was notable for incorporating traditional folk elements alongside stylistic innovations.

Similarly noteworthy is Mickiewicz&#x27;s earlier and longer 1823 poem, &quot;Grażyna&quot;, depicting the exploits of a Lithuanian chieftainess against the Teutonic Knights. Miłosz writes that &quot;Grażyna&quot; &quot;combines a metallic beat of lines and syntactical rigor with a plot and motifs dear to the Romantics.&quot; It is said by Christien Ostrowski to have inspired Emilia Plater, a military heroine of the November 1830 Uprising. A similar message informs Mickiewicz&#x27;s &quot;Oda do młodości&quot; (&quot;Ode to Youth&quot;).

Mickiewicz&#x27;s &quot;Crimean Sonnets&quot; (1825–26) and poems that he would later write in Rome and Lausanne, Miłosz notes, have been &quot;justly ranked among the highest achievements in Polish [lyric poetry].&quot; His 1830 travels in Italy likely inspired him to consider religious matters, and produced some of his best religiously themed works, such as &quot;Arcymistrz&quot; (&quot;The Grand Master&quot;) and &quot;Do Marceliny Łempickiej&quot; (&quot;To Marcelina Łempicka&quot;). He was an authority to the young insurgents of 1830–31, who expected him to participate in the fighting (the poet wrote a dedicated poem urging him to do so). Yet it is likely that Mickiewicz was no longer as idealistic and supportive of military action as he had been a few years earlier, and his new works such as &#x27; (&quot;To a Polish Mother&quot;, 1830), while still patriotic, also began to reflect on the tragedy of resistance. His meetings with refugees and escaping insurgents around 1831 resulted in works such as &#x27; (&quot;Ordon&#x27;s Redoubt&quot;), &quot;Nocleg&quot; (&quot;Night Bivouac&quot;) and &#x27; (&quot;Death of the Colonel&quot;). Wyka notes the irony that some of the most important literary works about the 1830 Uprising were written by Mickiewicz, who never took part in a battle or even saw a battlefield.His &#x27; (&quot;Books of the Polish Nation and the Polish Pilgrimage&quot;, 1832) opens with a historical-philosophical discussion of the history of humankind in which Mickiewicz argues that history is the history of now-unrealized freedom that awaits many oppressed nations in the future. It is followed by a longer &quot;moral catechism&quot; aimed at Polish émigrés. The book sets out a messianist metaphor of Poland as the &quot;Christ of nations&quot;. Described by Wyka as a propaganda piece, it was relatively simple, using biblical metaphors and the like to reach less-discriminating readers. It became popular not only among Poles but, in translations, among some other peoples, primarily those which lacked their own sovereign states. The &quot;Books&quot; were influential in framing Mickiewicz&#x27;s image among many not as that of a poet and author but as that of ideologue of freedom.
&quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot; (&quot;Sir Thaddeus&quot;, published 1834), another of his masterpieces, is an epic poem that draws a picture of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania on the eve of Napoleon&#x27;s 1812 invasion of Russia. It is written entirely in thirteen-syllable couplets. Originally intended as an apolitical idyll, it became, as Miłosz writes, &quot;something unique in world literature, and the problem of how to classify it has remained the crux of a constant quarrel among scholars&quot;; it &quot;has been called &#x27;the last epos&#x27; in world literature&quot;. &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot; was not highly regarded by contemporaries, nor by Mickiewicz himself, but in time it won acclaim as &quot;the highest achievement in all Polish literature.&quot;

The occasional poems that Mickiewicz wrote in his final decades have been described as &quot;exquisite, gnomic, extremely short and concise&quot;. His &quot;Lausanne Lyrics&quot;, (1839–40) are, writes Miłosz, &quot;untranslatable masterpieces of metaphysical meditation. In Polish literature, they are examples of that pure poetry that verges on silence.&quot;

In the 1830s (as early as 1830; as late as 1837) he worked on a futurist or science-fiction work, &#x27;. (&quot;Historia przyszłości&quot;, or &quot;L’histoire d’avenir&quot;) It predicted inventions similar to radio and television, and interplanetary communication using balloons. Written partially in French, it was never completed and was partly destroyed by the author, but parts of its seven versions survive. Other French-language works by Mickiewicz include the dramas &#x27; (&quot;The Bar Confederates&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;Jacques Jasiński, or the Two Polands&quot;). These would not achieve much recognition, and would not be published till 1866.

=== Lithuanian language ===
Adam Mickiewicz did not write any poems in Lithuanian. However, it is known that Mickiewicz did have some understanding of the Lithuanian language, although some Polish commentators describe it as limited.

In the poem &quot;Grażyna&quot;, Mickiewicz quoted one sentence from Kristijonas Donelaitis&#x27; Lithuanian-language poem &quot;The Seasons&quot;. In &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot;, there is an un-Polonized Lithuanian name Baublys. Furthermore, due to Mickiewicz&#x27;s position as lecturer on Lithuanian folklore and mythology in Collège de France, it can be inferred that he must have known the language sufficiently to lecture about it. It is known that Adam Mickiewicz often sang Lithuanian folk songs with the Samogitian Ludmilew Korylski. For example, in the early 1850s when in Paris, Mickiewicz interrupted a Lithuanian folk song sung by Ludmilew Korylski, commenting that he was singing it wrong and hence wrote down on a piece of paper how to sing the song correctly. On the piece of paper, there are fragments of three different Lithuanian folk songs (&quot;Ejk Tatuszeli i bytiu darża&quot;, &quot;Atjo żałnieros par łauka&quot;, &quot;Ej warneli, jod warneli isz&quot;), which are the sole, as of now, known Lithuanian writings by Adam Mickiewicz. The folk songs are known to have been sung in Darbėnai.

==Legacy==


A prime figure of the Polish Romantic period, Mickiewicz is counted as one of Poland&#x27;s Three Bards (the others being Zygmunt Krasiński and Juliusz Słowacki) and the greatest poet in all Polish literature. Mickiewicz has long been regarded as Poland&#x27;s national poet and is a revered figure in Lithuania. He is also considered one of the greatest Slavic and European poets. He has been described as a &quot;Slavic bard.&quot; He was a leading Romantic dramatist and has been compared in Poland and in Europe with Byron and Goethe.

The works of Mickiewicz also promoted the Lithuanian National Revival and the development of national self-awareness. Mickiewicz&#x27;s works began to be translated into the Lithuanian language when he was still alive (e.g. Simonas Daukantas, one of the pioneers of the Lithuanian National Revival, translated and retold a story &#x27; / &#x27; in 1822, Kiprijonas Nezabitauskis translated &#x27; / &#x27; and it was published in Paris in ~1836, Liudvikas Adomas Jucevičius translated a ballad &#x27; / &#x27; in 1837). Moreover, Mickiewicz&#x27;s works has influenced the pioneers of the Lithuanian National Revival in the 19th century (e.g. Antanas Baranauskas, Jonas Basanavičius, Stasys Matulaitis, Mykolas Biržiška, Petras Vileišis). Furthermore, the beginning of Vincas Kudirka&#x27;s &quot;Tautiška giesmė&quot; (1898), the national anthem of Lithuania since 1919 and since 1988, is a paraphrase of the beginning of a poem &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot;. The translation into Lithuanian and publishing of Mickiewicz&#x27;s works has continued after the restoration of Lithuania&#x27;s statehood in 1918.

Mickiewicz&#x27;s importance extends beyond literature to the broader spheres of culture and politics; Wyka writes that he was a &quot;singer and epic poet of the Polish people and a pilgrim for the freedom of nations.&quot; Scholars have used the expression &quot;cult of Mickiewicz&quot; to describe the reverence in which he is held as a &quot;national prophet.&quot; On hearing of Mickiewicz&#x27;s death, his fellow bard Krasiński wrote: For men of my generation, he was milk and honey, gall and life&#x27;s blood: we all descend from him. He carried us off on the surging billow of his inspiration and cast us into the world. Edward Henry Lewinski Corwin described Mickiewicz&#x27;s works as Promethean, as &quot;reaching more Polish hearts&quot; than the other Polish Bards, and affirmed Danish critic Georg Brandes&#x27; assessment of Mickiewicz&#x27;s works as &quot;healthier&quot; than those of Byron, Shakespeare, Homer, and Goethe. Koropeckyi writes that Mickiewicz has &quot;informed the foundations of [many] parties and ideologies&quot; in Poland from the 19th century to this day, &quot;down to the rappers in Poland&#x27;s post-socialist blocks, who can somehow still declare that &#x27;if Mickiewicz was alive today, he&#x27;d be a good rapper.&#x27;&quot; While Mickiewicz&#x27;s popularity has endured two centuries in Poland, he is less well known abroad, but in the 19th century he had won substantial international fame among &quot;people that dared resist the brutal might of reactionary empires.&quot;

Mickiewicz has been written about or had works dedicated to him by many authors in Poland (Asnyk, Gałczyński, Iwaszkiewicz, Jastrun, Kasprowicz, Lechoń, Konopnicka, Teofil Lenartowicz, Norwid, Przyboś, Różewicz, Słonimski, Słowacki, Staff, Tetmajer, Tuwim, Ujejski, Wierzyński, Zaleski and others) and by authors outside Poland (Bryusov, Goethe, Pushkin, Uhland, Vrchlický and others). He has been a character in works of fiction, including a large body of dramatized biographies, e.g., in 1900, Stanisław Wyspiański&#x27;s &quot;Legion&quot;. He has also been a subject of many paintings, by Eugène Delacroix, Józef Oleszkiewicz, Aleksander Orłowski, Wojciech Stattler and Walenty Wańkowicz. Monuments and other tributes (streets and schools named for him) abound in Poland and Lithuania, and in other former territories of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth: Ukraine and Belarus. He has also been the subject of many statues and busts by Antoine Bourdelle, David d&#x27;Angers, , Władysław Oleszczyński, , Teodor Rygier, Wacław Szymanowski and Jakub Tatarkiewicz. In 1898, the 100th anniversary of his birth, a towering statue by Cyprian Godebski was erected in Warsaw. Its base carries the inscription, &quot;To the Poet from the People.&quot; In 1955, the 100th anniversary of his death, the University of Poznań adopted him as its official patron.

Much has been written about Mickiewicz, though the vast majority of this scholarly and popular literature is available only in Polish. Works devoted to him, according to Koropeckyi, author of a 2008 English biography, &quot;could fill a good shelf or two.&quot; Koropeckyi notes that, apart from some specialist literature, only five book-length biographies of Mickiewicz have been published in English. He also writes that, though many of Mickiewicz&#x27;s works have been reprinted numerous times, no language has a &quot;definitive critical edition of his works.&quot;

=== Museums ===

A number of museums in Europe are dedicated to Mickiewicz:
* Warsaw has an Adam Mickiewicz Museum of Literature.
* His house in Navahrudak is now a museum ().
* There is a &quot;Mickievičiaus Memorialinis Butas-Muziejus&quot; Museum of Adam Mickiewicz in Vilnius.
* The House of Perkūnas in Kaunas where the school Mickiewicz attended used to be located has a museum devoted to him and his work.
* The house where he lived and died in Constantinople (Adam Mickiewicz Museum, Istanbul).
* There is a &quot;Musée Adam Mickiewicz&quot; in Paris, France.

==Ethnicity==

Adam Mickiewicz is known as a Polish poet, Polish-Lithuanian, Lithuanian, or Belarusian. &quot;The Cambridge History of Russia&quot; describes him as Polish but sees his ethnic origins as &quot;Lithuanian-Belarusian (and perhaps Jewish).&quot;

Some sources assert that Mickiewicz&#x27;s mother was descended from a converted, Frankist Jewish family. Others view this as improbable. Polish historian Kazimierz Wyka, in his biographic entry in &quot;Polski Słownik Biograficzny&quot; (1975) wrote that this hypothesis, based on the fact that his mother&#x27;s maiden name, Majewska, was popular among Frankist Jews, but has not been proven. Wyka states that the poet&#x27;s mother was the daughter of a noble (&quot;szlachta&quot;) family of Starykoń coat of arms, living on an estate at Czombrów in Nowogródek Voivodeship (Navahrudak Voivodeship). According to the Belarusian historian Rybczonek, Mickiewicz&#x27;s mother had Tatar (Lipka Tatars) roots.

Virgil Krapauskas noted that &quot;Lithuanians like to prove that Adam Mickiewicz was Lithuanian&quot; while Tomas Venclova described this attitude as &quot;the story of Mickiewicz&#x27;s appropriation by Lithuanian culture&quot;. For example, the Lithuanian scholar of literature writes that Mickiewicz&#x27;s family was descended from an old Lithuanian noble family (with ancestor&#x27;s name Rimvydas) with origins predating Lithuania&#x27;s Christianization, but the Lithuanian nobility in Mickiewicz&#x27;s time was heavily Polonized and spoke Polish. Mickiewicz had been brought up in the culture of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, a multicultural state that had encompassed most of what today are the separate countries of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine. To Mickiewicz, a splitting of that multicultural state into separate entities – due to trends such as Lithuanian National Revival – was undesirable, if not outright unthinkable. According to Romanucci-Ross, while Mickiewicz called himself a &quot; Litvin&quot; (&quot;Lithuanian&quot;), in his time the idea of a separate &quot;Lithuanian identity&quot;, apart from a &quot;Polish&quot; one, did not exist. This multicultural aspect is evident in his works: his most famous poetic work, &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot;, begins with the Polish-language invocation, &quot;Oh Lithuania, my homeland, thou art like health ...&quot; (&quot;Litwo! Ojczyzno moja! ty jesteś jak zdrowie ...&quot;). It is generally accepted, however, that Mickiewicz, when referring to Lithuania, meant a historical region rather than a linguistic and cultural entity, and he often applied the term &quot;Lithuanian&quot; to the Slavic inhabitants of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

<text>Melankomas, or Melancomas (), meaning &#x27;One with the Black Hair,&#x27; was an Ancient Greek boxer from Caria and victor in the 207th Olympiad (49 AD.).

== Biography ==
Melankomas was born in Caria to an Ancient Greek boxing champion, of the same name, who lived during the first century C.E. He made a name for himself as an Ancient Greek boxer in the Olympiad, even winning in the 207th Olympiad in 49 A.D. 

Supposedly he had a unique boxing style, blocking and avoiding the punches of the other boxer without throwing any himself. Ancient Greek boxing rules specified that only blows were permitted, and matches had no time limits or points, simply lasting until one boxer surrendered. Thus, once his opponents had run out of stamina and could no longer attack nor defend themselves, they would have to forfeit, leaving Melankomas the victor.

It was related by Dio Chrysostom that he was able to fight like this by training significantly more than his contemporaries and having an unmatched endurance, being able to fight through a whole day or hold his arms up, in a static hold, continuously for two days.

Melankomas died young, around the year 70 A.D. during the games in Naples.

== Legacy ==
Melankomas is known to us mainly from the 28th and 29th Discourses of &quot;Dio Chrysostom&quot;, in which that writer uses his life as a canvas for a discussion of the ideal athlete and the ideal man; Dio praises his athleticism, good looks, and brave heart. Dio says he never lost a match, hit an opponent, or was struck by an opponent. Themistius reports that the emperor Titus was his lover (&quot;&quot;).

Some scholars believe Melankomas to have been a real person, while others believe that he or his record was an invention of Dio&#x27;s; there is nothing allowing a firm conclusion either way.

Melankomas was mentioned in a second-season episode of &quot;Sports Night&quot; as a contender for &quot;Athlete of the Millennium.&quot;

He appears as an opponent in the Cestarii expansion of the mobile game &quot;Gladiator Manager&quot;.

<doc id="158262" wikidata="Q3738410" url="?curid=158262" title="Fail-deadly">
<text>Fail-deadly is a concept in nuclear military strategy that encourages deterrence by guaranteeing an immediate, automatic, and overwhelming response to an attack, even if there is no one to trigger such retaliation. The term &quot;fail-deadly&quot; was coined as a contrast to &quot;fail-safe&quot;.

==Military usage==
Fail-deadly operation is an example of second-strike strategy, in that aggressors are discouraged from attempting a first strike attack. Under fail-deadly nuclear deterrence, policies and procedures controlling the retaliatory strike authorize launch even if the existing command and control structure has already been neutralized by a first strike. The deterrent efficacy of such a system clearly depends on other nuclear-armed nations having foreknowledge of it. The Soviet Union used a fail-deadly system known as Dead Hand (codenamed &quot;Perimeter&quot;); after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia retained the system (although it is now only activated in times of crisis).

Fail-deadly can refer to specific technology components, or the controls system as a whole. The United Kingdom&#x27;s fail-deadly policies delegate strike authority to submarine commanders in the event of a loss of command (using letters of last resort), ensuring that even when uncoordinated, nuclear retaliation can be carried out.

An example of the implementation of such a strategy could be: US Navy ballistic missile submarines are ordered to surface at periodic intervals to receive communications indicating that no change has occurred in the defense condition. Should the submarines be unable to receive the proper command and control signals indicating normal, peacetime conditions, their orders would be to launch their nuclear missiles under the assumption that command and control structures had been destroyed in a nuclear attack and that retaliation was therefore necessary. All available means of verification and all due caution would naturally be applied. This approach is obviously exceptionally dangerous for a variety of reasons, as any benign communications disruption due to technical failure could conceivably incite an unnecessary nuclear war. The strategy&#x27;s intended value lies in deterrence against attack on command, control, communications, and computer (see C4I) networks by any potential adversary.

<doc id="158263" wikidata="Q14629485" url="?curid=158263" title="Manning">
<text>Manning (a.k.a. Mannion, Manning) is a family name.

==Origin and meaning==

Manning is from an old Norse word — manningi — meaning a brave or valiant man; and one of the first forms of the name was Mannin; another cartography was Mannygn. One historian gives a Saxon origin for the family, which he calls &quot;ancient and noble&quot;. According to him, Manning was the name of a town in Saxony, and from it the surname sprang.

Other historians make Mannheim, Germany, the cradle of the family, and begin its history with Ranulph, or Rudolph de Manning, Count Palatine, who, having married Elgida, aunt to King Harold I of England, had a grant of land in Kent, England. His name is also written de Mannheim — Rudolph de Mannheim. His place in Kent was Downe Court, and there the Mannings have been a power ever since. Simon de Manning, a grandson of Rudolph, was the first of the English barons to take up the cross and go forth to the Holy Wars. He was a companion of King Richard I of England, and was knighted on the battlefield. He was Lord of the Manor of Kevington, and the area now called Berry&#x27;s Green. We can easily see where the cross of the coat of arms comes from. At Downe Court these arms are seen graven upon tombstones of the Mannings. By the thirteenth century the family was well represented in over a score of countries and several towns bear their name — Manningham, Bradford, and Mannington, Norfolk. The surname Manning is also an English patronymic name, being one of those names derived from the first name of a father. In this case it is derived from the old English personal name Manning and simply denotes &#x27;son of Manning&#x27;, while Manning itself may derive from the old Norse name Menning, meaning &#x27;able&#x27;.

Early recorded English instances of the name includes a reference to one Mannicus in the Domesday Book of 1086 and Algarus Manningestepsune in 1130, mentioned in Ekwall&#x27;s &quot;Early London Personal Names&quot;. Seaman Lilius Manning appears in the Pipe Rolls for Essex in 1181 and Ainulf Manning in the Pipe Rolls for Kent in 1190.

The surname Manning is on the record in Ireland from the seventeenth century and is most numerous today in counties Cork, Dublin, Roscommon, Mayo, and Galway. Although it is essentially an English surname, Manning has occasionally been used as a synonym of the Gaelic surname Ó Mainnín and that, for example, Cornet John Manning of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s dragons in King James II&#x27;s Irish army, was an Ó Mainnín.

Others trace the origins of the name to Ireland: Ó Mainnín (anglicized Mannion) is the name of a Galway family who were formerly chiefs of Soghain (in what is now Ireland), a district nearly co-extensive with the barony of Tiaquin. Ó Mainnín, King of Soghain, is mentioned in the Chronicon Scotorum in the year 1135, and a latter chief died at the Second Battle of Athenry in 1316. According to historian C. Thomas Cairney, the O&#x27;Mannins were chiefs of the Soghain tribe and that the Soghain tribe came from the Cruthin tribe who were the first Celts to settle in Ireland from 800 to 500 BC.

The Mannings continued to form a distinct clan down to the time of James I of England. The chief resided at Menlough Castle, in the parish of Killascobe, Galway. In 1617, Aedh Ó Mainnín (Hugh O&#x27;Mannin) surrendered his estates, but a small portion was restored under the Act of Settlement in 1676. The name is still common in Galway and Roscommon, and has spread into other parts of Ireland.

<text>The Battle of Arnhem was fought during the Second World War, as part of the Allied Operation Market Garden. It took place around the Dutch city of Arnhem and vicinity from 17 to 26 September 1944. The Allies had swept through France and Belgium in August 1944, after the Battle of Normandy. Market Garden was proposed by Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, who favoured a single push northwards over the branches of the Lower Rhine River, allowing the British Second Army to bypass the Siegfried Line and attack the important Ruhr industrial area.

The First Allied Airborne Army was to capture the bridges to secure a route for the Second Army with US, British and Polish airborne troops dropped in the Netherlands along the line of the ground advance, being relieved by the British XXX Corps. Farthest north, the British 1st Airborne Division landed at Arnhem to capture bridges across the Nederrijn (Lower Rhine), with the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade following on. XXX Corps was expected to reach Arnhem in two to three days.

The 1st Airborne Division landed some distance from its objectives and met unexpected resistance, especially from elements of the II SS Panzer Korps. Only a small force was able to reach the Arnhem road bridge while the main body of the division was stopped on the edge of town. XXX Corps&#x27;s advance north from Nijmegen was delayed due to the failure, in the Battle of Nijmegen, to secure the bridge before the ground troops arrived and the British were not relieved on time. After four days, the small British force at the bridge was overwhelmed and the rest of the division was trapped in a small pocket north of the river.

The paratroops could not be sufficiently reinforced by the Poles or by XXX Corps when they arrived on the southern bank, nor by Royal Air Force supply flights. After nine days of fighting, the remnants of the division were withdrawn in Operation Berlin. The Allies were unable to advance further and the front line stabilised south of Arnhem. The 1st Airborne Division lost nearly three quarters of its strength and did not see combat again.

==Background==

By September 1944, Allied forces had broken out of their Normandy beachhead and pursued the remnants of the German armies across northern France and Belgium. Although Allied commanders generally favoured a broad front policy to continue the advance into Germany and the Netherlands, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery proposed a bold plan to head north through Dutch Gelderland, bypassing the German Siegfried Line defences and opening a route into the German industrial heartland of the Ruhr. Initially proposed as a British and Polish operation codenamed Operation Comet, the plan was soon expanded to involve most of the First Allied Airborne Army and a set-piece ground advance into the Netherlands, codenamed Market Garden.

Montgomery&#x27;s plan involved dropping the US 101st Airborne Division to capture bridges around Eindhoven, the US 82nd Airborne Division to capture crossings around Nijmegen and the British 1st Airborne Division, with the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade, to capture three bridges across the Nederrijn at Arnhem. Lieutenant General Lewis Brereton commanded the First Allied Airborne Army but his second-in-command Lieutenant-General Frederick Browning took command of the airborne operation. The British Second Army, led by XXX Corps, would advance up the &quot;Airborne corridor&quot;, securing the airborne divisions&#x27; positions and crossing the Rhine within two days. If successful, the plan would open the door to Germany and hopefully force an end to the war in Europe by the end of the year.

===British plan===
With the British 6th Airborne Division still refitting after Operation Tonga and the fighting in Normandy, the task of securing the Rhine bridgehead fell to the 1st Airborne Division under the command of Major-General Roy Urquhart. The division was made up of three brigades of infantry (two parachute, one glider-borne), supporting artillery of the 1st Airlanding Light Regiment and anti-tank batteries and Royal Engineer units, as well as supporting elements such as the Royal Army Service Corps and Royal Army Medical Corps. Most of the division had seen action in North Africa and Sicily, particularly the 1st Parachute Brigade and 1st Airlanding Brigade. This was the first time the division had fought as a complete formation. Urquhart also had the 1st Independent Polish Parachute Brigade under his command. His force was also substantially reinforced by some 1,200 men of the Glider Pilot Regiment, who would fly the glider-borne infantry and vehicles into Arnhem, providing the equivalent of two battalions of infantry for the operation. Smaller additions included a Dutch commando unit and American communications teams.

The division was required to secure the road, rail and pontoon bridges over the Nederrijn at Arnhem and hold them for two to three days until relieved by XXX Corps. From the beginning Urquhart was severely constrained in his planning for the operation. The US IX Troop Carrier Command (Major General Williams) could not land all the airborne troops in one go. Williams decided that it would only be possible to fly one air lift per day, meaning it would take three days to deliver the division and Polish Brigade. Few areas were suitable for glider landings and Williams was reluctant to send his aircraft too close to Arnhem and into the flak from Deelen airfield after the drop. Urquhart was forced to pick drop zones (DZ) and landing zones (LZ) up to from Arnhem, on the north side of the river. With the need to secure the bridges, towns and drop zones for subsequent supply drops, the 1st Airborne would need to defend a perimeter long whilst waiting for XXX Corps.

Urquhart decided to land the 1st Parachute Brigade (Brigadier Gerald Lathbury) and the 1st Airlanding Brigade (Brigadier Philip &quot;Pip&quot; Hicks&#x27;) on the first day of the operation, along with Divisional HQ, the 1st Airlanding Light Regiment, Royal Artillery and attached Royal Engineer and medical units. The Airlanding Brigade would land on LZs &#x27;S&#x27; and &#x27;Z&#x27; and move to secure the drop zones and landing zones for the following days&#x27; drops, whilst the three battalions of the parachute brigade would arrive at DZ &#x27;X&#x27; and follow separate routes to the Arnhem bridges. The 2nd Battalion (Lieutenant Colonel John Frost) would follow the riverside roads to the centre of Arnhem (&quot;Lion&quot; route) and secure the main road and railway bridges, as well as a pontoon bridge between them. The 3rd Battalion (Lieutenant Colonel Fitch) would head through Oosterbeek to Arnhem (&quot;Tiger&quot; route), assist in the capture of the road bridge and take up positions in the east of the town. The 1st Battalion (Lieutenant Colonel Dobie) would follow &quot;Leopard&quot; route north of the railway line to occupy high ground north and north west of Arnhem.

The advance into Arnhem would be led by a troop of jeeps from the 1st Airborne Reconnaissance Squadron (Major Frederick Gough) on &quot;Leopard&quot; route, who would attempt a on the road bridge. On the second day, the 4th Parachute Brigade (Brigadier John &quot;Shan&quot; Hackett) would arrive at DZ &#x27;Y&#x27;, accompanied by extra artillery units and the rest of the Airlanding Brigade on LZ &#x27;X&#x27;. Hackett&#x27;s three battalions would then reinforce the positions north and north west of Arnhem. On the third day, the 1st Independent Polish Parachute Brigade would be dropped south of the river at DZ &#x27;K&#x27;. Using the road bridge, they would reinforce the perimeter east of Arnhem, linking with their artillery which would be flown in by glider to LZ &#x27;L&#x27;. The 1st Airlanding Brigade would fall back to cover Oosterbeek on the western side of the perimeter and 1st Parachute Brigade would fall back to cover the southern side of the bridges. The remaining units of the division would follow XXX Corps on land in what was known as the &quot;sea tail&quot;. Once XXX Corps had arrived and advanced beyond the bridgehead, the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division would land at Deelen airfield to support the ground forces north of the Rhine. The operation would be supplied by daily flights by 38 Group and 46 Group RAF who would make the first drop on LZ &#x27;L&#x27; on day 2 and subsequent drops on DZ &#x27;V&#x27;.

===Intelligence===
The division was told to expect only limited resistance from German reserve forces. A serious challenge to their operation was not expected and many men believed that their work would lead to the ending of the war. Some – anticipating a period of occupation in Germany – packed leisure equipment in their kit or in the sea tail. Browning&#x27;s intelligence officer – Major Brian Urquhart – obtained information from the 21st Army Group in Belgium and Dutch resistance that German armour was present around Arnhem. This was backed up with aerial reconnaissance that he ordered to be flown. Browning was dismissive and ordered his chief medical officer to have Urquhart sent on sick leave. SHAEF was aware that there were almost certainly two Panzer divisions at Arnhem but with the operation looming chose to ignore them. Such information would have been gleaned from Ultra intercepts that the First Allied Airborne Army was not privy to and therefore could not act upon themselves.

===German forces===

The Allied liberation of Antwerp on 4 September had caused a rout of German reserve troops in the Netherlands, nicknamed &quot;Mad Tuesday&quot;. The Allied pause at the Dutch border gave the Germans time to regroup although it would make subsequent attempts to clarify the exact German forces opposing the Allies extremely difficult. &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Walter Model – commander of Army Group B – had moved his headquarters to Arnhem and was re-establishing defences in the area and co-ordinating the reorganisation of the scattered units so that by the time the Allies launched Market Garden there would be several units opposing them. To the west of Arnhem was &quot;Kampfgruppe Von Tettau&quot;, a force equivalent to seven battalions made up of all manner of German units (including &quot;Heer&quot;, &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, rear echelon and &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; troops) under the command of General Hans von Tettau at Grebbeberg. This included the SS Non-commissioned officer school &quot;SS Unteroffizierschule Arnheim&quot; and the 16th SS Training Battalion under the command of SS &quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; Sepp Krafft, whose unit would play a crucial role in the opening phases of the battle. Within Arnhem itself, the town garrison was under the command of Major-General Friedrich Kussin.
The II SS Panzer Corps (&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Wilhelm Bittrich)comprising the remains of the 9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen (Walter Harzer) and the 10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg (Heinz Harmel) had moved into the area north of Arnhem to refit and reorganise. Although badly mauled in Normandy and during their escape from the Falaise pocket, the corps was made up of veterans and made available significantly more forces to the Germans than the Allies had been led to expect. The divisions were also specially trained in anti-airborne operations; during their formation both divisions had undergone month-long anti-airborne exercises whilst waiting for their heavy equipment, and had also spent the last 15 months studying the best reactions to a parachute attack in classroom and field exercises. The 9th SS had a &quot;Panzergrenadier&quot; brigade, a reconnaissance battalion, an artillery battalion, two batteries of self-propelled guns and a company of tanks. The number of men who were available after the withdrawal from Normandy is unclear. Some sources suggest that the 9th had up to 6,000 men, others suggest that the combined total of the 9th and 10th SS was only 6,000–7,000 men.

There were also Dutch units allied to the Germans present at Arnhem. These formations recruited from Dutch nationals (mainly criminals, men wishing to avoid national service or men affiliated with the &quot;Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging&quot;) and were incorporated into the German Army. At Arnhem, the partly Dutch SS &quot;Wachbattalion&quot; 3 was attached to &quot;Kampfgruppe Von Tettau&quot; and the 3rd Battalion of the 34th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division Landstorm Nederland training at nearby Hoogeveen was quickly attached to the 9th SS Panzer Division when they arrived on 20 September.

As the battle progressed, more and more forces would become available to the Germans. Adolf Hitler, stunned by the attack, agreed that the defence of the Netherlands should receive priority, and reinforcements streamed in from Wehrkreis VI, the Wesel area and Armed Forces Command Netherlands (General Friedrich Christiansen). Model arranged for units to be sent straight to the units in action and rushed in specialist urban warfare and machine gun battalions. Each day of the battle, the German military strength increased whilst the British supplies diminished. By 21 September, the fifth day of the battle, German forces outnumbered the British by 3:1 and continued to increase.

==Battle==
===Day 1 – Sunday 17 September===
The first lift was preceded by intense bombing and strafing by the British Second Tactical Air Force and the American 8th and 9th Air Forces. These targeted the known flak guns and German garrisons and barracks in the area. The first lift suffered only light losses as the aircraft and gliders flew from British bases to the target area. The first arrivals were the 21st Independent Parachute Company, who landed at 12:40 to mark the landing zones for the gliders and parachutists of the main force. The landings were largely unopposed and the battalions were formed up in good order and ready to carry out their tasks by 14:45.

The Airlanding Brigade moved quickly to secure the landing zones. The 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment moved into Wolfheze, the 1st Battalion, Border Regiment secured DZ &#x27;X&#x27;, deploying its companies around the DZ and in Renkum and the 7th Battalion, King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers moved to secure DZ &#x27;Y&#x27;. Here, they ambushed the Dutch SS Wach Battalion as it headed toward Arnhem from Ede. Units of the Airlanding Artillery and Divisional HQ headed into Wolfheze and Oosterbeek where medical officers set up a Regimental Aid Post at the home of Kate ter Horst.

While the 1st Airlanding Brigade moved off from the landing zones, the 1st Parachute Brigade prepared to head east toward the bridges, with Lathbury and his HQ Company following Frost on &quot;Lion&quot; route. Although some jeeps of the reconnaissance squadron were lost on the flight over, the company formed up in good strength and moved off along &quot;Leopard&quot; route.
The Germans were unprepared for the landings and thrown into confusion. Model – erroneously assuming that the paratroopers had come to capture him – fled his headquarters at the Tafelberg Hotel in Oosterbeek and went to Bittrich&#x27;s headquarters east of Arnhem at Doetinchem, where he took control of the battle. The 10th SS Panzer Division was sent south to respond to the American landings at Nijmegen and to defend the &quot;island&quot; (the polder between the Nederrijn and Waal rivers), while the 9th SS Panzer Division would defend Arnhem. The 9th SS Panzer Division was in the midst of preparing to return to Germany and Harmel was in Berlin trying to secure more men and supplies for his unit. He was instantly ordered to return to Arnhem whilst his division began to prepare its forces for battle. &quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Ludwig Spindler – commander of the 9th SS Armoured Artillery Regiment – quickly organised a small &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; (battlegroup; &quot;Kampfgruppe Spindler&quot;) which was initially only 120 men but would incorporate 16 units over the course of the battle). In the late afternoon, he was ordered to advance west to Oosterbeek and establish a blocking line to prevent the British from reaching Arnhem centre.

The 9th SS division&#x27;s 40-vehicle reconnaissance battalion under the command of &quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; Viktor Gräbner was ordered south to Nijmegen, crossing the Arnhem bridge at dusk. No units were ordered to secure the bridge at first. Kussin, the Arnhem Garrison commander, was killed by men of the 3rd Parachute Battalion as he sped towards his headquarters and his death led to a breakdown of the German command. It was not until late in the afternoon that the Reconnaissance Battalion of 10th SS Panzer Division were ordered to secure the bridge. At the time of the landings, only one organised unit was in place to oppose the Allied advance toward the bridges (the 16th SS Training Battalion camped in Wolfheze) and their commander – Sepp Krafft – acted quickly to establish a blocking screen west of Oosterbeek.

The Allied advance quickly ran into trouble, the reconnaissance squadron was ambushed by the northern flank of Krafft&#x27;s blocking line and withdrew. The 1st and 3rd Parachute Battalions were also stalled by Krafft&#x27;s defences and spent the rest of the day skirting his line. The 3rd Parachute Battalion went south and halted in Oosterbeek for most of the night while 1st Parachute Battalion went further north but hit Spindler&#x27;s forces and was unable to reach the Arnhem–Ede road of &quot;Leopard&quot; route. Dobie decided to abandon his original plan and head towards the bridge to assist Frost; the battalion headed south into Oosterbeek overnight. Only the 2nd Parachute Battalion was largely unopposed, bypassing the defences that did not as yet reach down as far as the river. They were slowed by cheering Dutch civilians and did not reach the bridges until late in the day. The railway bridge was blown by German engineers as the Allies approached it and the pontoon bridge was missing its central section. At dusk, the men of A Company under Major Digby Tatham-Warter observed Gräbner&#x27;s force cross the bridge on their way to Nijmegen. Most of the battalion and various other supporting unitsincluding two jeeps of Gough&#x27;s squadron, four 6-pounder anti-tank guns, Brigade HQ (without Lathbury), and Royal Engineers (in total numbering about 740 men) moved into Arnhem centre as night fell.

Lieutenant Colonel John Frost, commander of the 2nd Parachute Battalion of the 1st Parachute Brigade, had led a mixed group of about 745 lightly armed men who had landed near Oosterbeek and marched into Arnhem along the Rhine River route. While encountering few Germans and little opposition, the 2nd Battalion had been unable to secure its objectives along the way. The railway bridge at Oosterbeek was blown up by the Germans when the first British paratroops tried to rush across and seize it. The Germans had moved the Old Ship bridge to the south bank. The battalion reached the main road bridge in Arnhem, capturing the northern end but was unable to secure the southern end from the German defenders. The 2nd Parachute Battalion were able to consolidate their position and quickly repulsed the 10th SS Reconnaissance Battalion and other German units when they arrived to secure the bridge.

The Allied advance was severely hampered by poor communications. The paratroopers&#x27; radio sets&#x27; range was instantly limited by the wooded terrain and as the battalions advanced they lost contact with Divisional HQ at the landing zones. For the next nine days, radio communication within the division, with Browning&#x27;s HQ at Nijmegen, with XXX Corps and with the United Kingdom would be intermittent and unreliable, severely hampering the British units. Carrier pigeons were even used to make contact with Britain. Partly as a consequence of the radio blackout, Urquhart decided to follow the 1st Parachute Brigade and make contact with Lathbury. When he found the Brigade HQ on &quot;Lion&quot; route, he was informed by Major Hibbert, who was still en route to the bridge, that Lathbury was visiting the 3rd Battalion. Urquhart followed Lathbury there but would not be able to return to Divisional HQ for two days.

===Day 2 – Monday 18 September===
The 9th SS Panzer Division continued to reinforce the German blocking line. Krafft&#x27;s unit withdrew overnight and joined Spindler&#x27;s line, coming under his command. Spindler&#x27;s force was now becoming so large as more men and units arrived at the new front, that he was forced to split it into battle groups &quot;Kampfgruppen&quot; Allworden and Harder. The defensive line now blocked the western side of Arnhem and had just closed the gap exploited by Frost along the river the previous evening. Overnight, the 1st and 3rd Parachute Battalions had skirted as far south as 2nd Parachute Battalion&#x27;s original &quot;Lion&quot; route, hoping to follow them into Arnhem centre. They approached the German line on the outskirts of the town before light and for several hours attempted to fight through the German positions. Spindler&#x27;s force – being continually reinforced – was too strong to penetrate and by 10:00 the British advance was stopped. A more coordinated attack followed in the afternoon but it too was repulsed. Urquhart attempted to return to his divisional headquarters at Oosterbeek but became cut off and was forced to take shelter in a Dutch family&#x27;s loft with two other officers. Lathbury was injured and also forced into hiding.

At the road bridge, German forces of the 9th SS Reconnaissance Battalion had quickly surrounded the 2nd Battalion, cutting them off from the rest of the division. At around 09:00, the 9th SS Reconnaissance Battalion headed back toward Arnhem from south of the river, having concluded that it was not needed at Nijmegen. Aware of the British troops at the bridge, the battalion attempted to rush the bridge. In a two-hour battle, it was repulsed with many losses; twelve out of the battalion&#x27;s 22 armoured vehicles in the assault were destroyed or knocked out and its commanding officer, Viktor Gräbner, was killed. German attacks carried on around the British perimeter at the Arnhem bridge for the rest of the day but the British held on.

At the landing zones, Urquhart&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mackenzie, told Hicks that, in Urquhart&#x27;s and Lathbury&#x27;s absence, he was acting divisional commander. Mackenzie also advised him to send one of his units – the South Staffords (which was not complete and was awaiting its full complement of men in the second lift) – to Arnhem to help with the advance to the bridge. The South Staffords departed in the morning and joined the 1st Parachute Battalion in the late afternoon.

German forces began to probe the 1st Airlanding Brigade defences in the morning. Units of &quot;Kampfgruppe von Tettau&quot; attacked the Border&#x27;s positions; men of the SS NCO school overran Renkum and &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; troops engaged the British all day as they withdrew. Minor fighting broke out around LZ &#x27;X&#x27; but not enough to seriously hamper the glider landing there. At DZ &#x27;Y&#x27;, the Dutch SS &quot;Wach&quot; Battalion became heavily engaged with the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, threatening to hamper the arrival of the second lift. The communications breakdown meant that it was impossible to warn the aircraft. Equally, there was no way for the division to know that the second lift had been delayed by ground fog in England. Thus, the arrival of the 4th Parachute Brigade under Brigadier Hackett and several more troops of artillery at the drop zones was several hours overdue. When the parachutists did arrive after 15:00, they dropped under fire. Several were killed as aircraft and parachutists were shot down and the heath-land they were landing on burned. The arrival of a brigade overwhelmed the Dutch SS, who were routed and surrendered in droves.

Despite the setbacks, the units assembled with only slight casualties but the circumstances at Arnhem meant that their roles were quickly changed. The 11th Parachute Battalion and the rest of the South Staffords were immediately despatched to Arnhem to assist in the attempt to break through to the bridge, where they joined the 1st and 3rd Parachute Battalions after dark. Hicks&#x27; decision to send the 11th Parachute Battalion to Arnhem (weakening the 4th Parachute Brigade), dismayed Hackett, who remonstrated with Hicks to no avail. He was given command of the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, who were moving toward LZ &#x27;L&#x27; to secure it for Tuesday&#x27;s landing. The 10th and 156th Parachute Battalions moved north of the railway line to take up their planned defensive positions north-west of Arnhem but the leading elements of 156th Parachute Battalion made contact with the main 9th SS Panzer Division blocking line after dark and withdrew for the night. Shortly after the second lift arrived, the first supply drop was made onto LZ &#x27;L&#x27;. Although most supplies arrived, only a small amount could be collected, as the area was not under British control. The poor radio communication meant that it was not possible to alert the RAF.

===Day 3 – Tuesday 19 September===
With the South Staffords and 11th Parachute Battalion arriving at the positions of the 1st and 3rd Parachute Battalions on the western outskirts of Arnhem, the British hoped to have sufficient troops to break through to Frost&#x27;s position at the bridge. Lieutenant Colonel Dobie, the commander of the 1st Parachute Battalion, planned to attack before first light, but an erroneous report suggesting that the bridge had fallen led to the attack being cancelled. By the time the report was corrected, first light was due but with reinforcement at the bridge the priority, the attack had to proceed. The advance began on a narrow front between the railway line to the north and the river to the south. The 1st Parachute Battalion led, supported by remnants of the 3rd Parachute Battalion, with the 2nd South Staffordshires on the left flank and the 11th Parachute Battalion following behind. As soon as it became light, the 1st Parachute Battalion was spotted and halted by fire from the main German defensive line. Trapped in open ground and under heavy fire from three sides, the 1st Parachute Battalion disintegrated and what remained of the 3rd Parachute Battalion fell back.

The 2nd South Staffordshires were similarly cut off and save for about 150 men, overcome by midday. The 11th Parachute Battalion was overwhelmed in exposed positions while attempting to capture high ground to the north. The South Staffords similarly attempted to secure high ground but were repulsed. With no hope of breaking through, the 500 remaining men of these four battalions retreated westwards in the direction of the main force, away in Oosterbeek. As they approached Oosterbeek, they were met by Lieutenant Colonel Sheriff Thompson, of the 1st Airlanding Light Artillery Regiment, who formed most of the men into a defensive screen under Major Robert Cain forward of his artillery positions. The battle gave Urquhart the opportunity to escape from his hiding place, and he was able to return to the Divisional HQ at the Hotel Hartenstein in Oosterbeek, where for the first time he was able to learn the extent of the German forces facing them. In Britain, ground fog again frustrated reinforcement. Thirty-five gliders of the 3rd lift carrying the Polish glider-borne elements were delayed in taking off and the parachute brigade failed to take off at all.
North of the railway line, the 156th and 10th Parachute Battalions tried to seize the high ground in the woods north of Oosterbeek. The advance was slow and by early afternoon they had not advanced any further than their original positions. Urquhart, realising the need to go on to the defensive and prevent the two battalions being cut off north of the railway, ordered them to fall back to Wolfheze and Oosterbeek. Making a fighting withdrawal with the Germans of &quot;Kampfgruppe Krafft&quot; closely pursuing them, the units fell back across LZ &#x27;L&#x27;, defended by the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, who were awaiting the arrival of the glider-borne elements of the Polish Parachute Brigade. Fighting began as the gliders arrived in the middle of the retreat and Polish losses were severe. All four Allied units streamed south and west toward the road crossings over the steep railway cutting at Oosterbeek and Wolfheze and gathered in &quot;ad hoc&quot; units in the woods on the south side, where most of them spent the night. Some German units followed them across the railway and an SS battalion reached Wolfheze but stopped when it was strafed by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;.

In the afternoon, the RAF flew its first big supply mission, with 164 aircraft carrying of supplies. The Germans anticipated the flight and moved five flak batteries into the area; as the RAF came into view, they shot down ten aircraft. Despite the bravery of the pilots (Flight Lieutenant David Lord received the Victoria Cross posthumously), the Airborne forces only recovered of supplies. The dropzone, DZ &#x27;V&#x27;, was still in German hands (the British would never reach this zone during the battle) and no message had reached Britain to explain this. At the bridge, Frost held on, but without supplies or reinforcements, the position was becoming precarious. The Germans began systematically to destroy the houses the British were in, using tanks, artillery and mortars. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was able to make strafing runs on the British-occupied houses.

===Day 4 – Wednesday 20 September===

By now, the 1st Airborne Division was too weak to attempt to reach Frost at the bridge. Eight of the nine infantry battalions were badly mauled or scattered and only the 1st Battalion, The Border Regiment existed as a unit. Urquhart made the difficult decision to abandon the 2nd Parachute Battalion to fend for itself. By forming a defensive perimeter around Oosterbeek and securing the Driel ferry crossing, Urquhart hoped to hold out until XXX Corps could reach them and establish a new bridgehead over the Rhine.

The eastern side of this new perimeter was fairly stable after the previous day&#x27;s retreat from Arnhem, with numerous &quot;ad hoc&quot; units under company commanders defending the approaches to Oosterbeek. Major Richard Lonsdale had taken command of the outlying units and their positions weathered severe German attacks, before falling back to the main divisional perimeter. This sector was later named Lonsdale Force and would remain the main line of defence on the south-eastern perimeter. The Border Regiment held most of the western edge of the town, with scattered units filling the gaps to the north. As more units fell back to the new defensive area, they were re-organised to establish a thumb-shaped perimeter using the Nederrijn as its southern base. The mixed units at Wolfheze began to fall back in the morning, but several were surrounded and captured, including one party of 130 men. One hundred and fifty men of 156th Parachute Battalion, led by Hackett, became pinned down and took cover in a hollow some west of the Oosterbeek perimeter. The men broke out of the hollow in the late afternoon and approximately 90 of them made it to the Border Regiment&#x27;s positions.
The afternoon&#x27;s supply drop went little better than the previous day&#x27;s. Although a message had reached Britain to arrange a new dropping zone near the Hotel Hartenstein, some aircraft flew to LZ &#x27;Z&#x27; where their supplies fell into German hands. At Oosterbeek, the Germans had used British marker panels and flares to attract the aircraft to their positions and the aircraft were unable to distinguish the exact dropping zones. Ten of the 164 aircraft involved were shot down around Arnhem and only 13 per cent of the supplies reached British hands.

At the bridge, Frost was finally able to make radio contact with Urquhart and was given the difficult news that reinforcement was doubtful. Shortly afterwards, at about 13:30, Frost was injured in the legs by a mortar bomb, and command passed to Major Gough. Despite their stubborn defence of the few buildings they still held, by late afternoon the British position was becoming untenable. When fire took hold of many of the buildings in which the wounded were being treated, a two-hour truce was organised in the late afternoon and the wounded (including Frost) were taken into captivity. Overnight, a few units managed to hold out for a little longer and several groups tried to break out toward the Oosterbeek perimeter, although almost all of them, including Major Hibbert, were captured. By 05:00 on Thursday morning, all resistance at the bridge had ceased. In later years, Walter Harzer claimed that, during the final hours of fighting, his men intercepted a radio message sent from the bridge that ended with the sentences: &quot;Out of ammunition. God Save the King&quot;.

===Day 5 – Thursday 21 September===
Throughout the morning, the Germans mopped up British survivors and stragglers in hiding around Arnhem bridge. It took several hours to clear the bridge of debris to allow German armour to cross and reinforce Nijmegen. Crucially, the British had held the bridge for long enough for the 82nd Airborne Division and the Guards Armoured Division to capture the Nijmegen bridge. With the resistance at the bridge crushed, the Germans had more troops available for the Oosterbeek engagement, although this changed suddenly in the afternoon.

Delayed by weather, the parachute infantry battalions of Stanisław Sosabowski&#x27;s 1st (Polish) Parachute Brigade were finally able to take off; 114 C-47s took off but 41 aircraft turned back after Troop Carrier Command decided it would be too dangerous to land if the aircraft were up too long. The remainder pressed on; they did not have the correct transmission codes and did not understand the messages. One of the few messages to get out of Arnhem warned the Poles that DZ &#x27;K&#x27; was not secure and to land instead on the polder east of Driel, where they should secure the Heveadorp ferry on the south bank of the Rhine. The Poles dropped under fire at 17:00 and suffered casualties, but assembled in good order. Advancing to the river bank, they discovered that the ferry was gone; the ferryman had sunk it to deny its use to the Germans. The arrival of the Poles relieved the pressure on the British, as the Germans were forced to send more forces south of the Rhine. Fearing an attack on the southern end of the road bridge or the Nijmegen road, a battalion of the 34th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division &quot;Landstorm Nederland&quot;, Machine Gun Battalion 47 and other &quot;Kampfgruppen&quot; headed across the river overnight.

At Oosterbeek, the defensive positions were consolidated and organised into two zones. Hicks commanded the western and northern sides of the perimeter and Hackett, after some rest, the east side. The perimeter was not a defensive line but a collection of defensive pockets in houses and foxholes around the centre of Oosterbeek, with the divisional headquarters at the Hotel Hartenstein at its centre. The perimeter was roughly round and was defended by about 3,600 men. The Hermann Göring NCO School attacked the Border positions on the west side near the Rhine, forcing them to abandon tactically important high ground overlooking Oosterbeek. The biggest boost to the besieged British was being able to make contact with the 64th Medium Regiment, RA of XXX Corps, which bombarded the German positions around the perimeter. The radio link to the battery headquarters was also used as the main line of communication to XXX Corps. So important was the 64 Medium Regiment that afterwards Urquhart lobbied (unsuccessfully) for the regiment to be able to wear the airborne Pegasus badge on their uniforms.

The British had seen the Polish drop, but were unable to make contact by radio; Private Ernest Henry Archer swam the Rhine with a message. The British planned to supply rafts for a river crossing that night, as the Poles were desperately needed on the northern bank. The Poles waited on the southern bank, but by 03:00 no rafts were evident and they withdrew to Driel to take up defensive positions.

===Day 6 – Friday 22 September===
Overnight, the Germans south of the river formed a blocking line along the railway, linking up with 10th SS to the south and screening the road bridge from the Poles. The Polish were well dug in at Driel, however, and German armour was unable to manoeuvre off of the main roads to attack them. Hopes were raised when three armoured cars of XXX Corps&#x27; Household Cavalry managed to skirt the German defences on the island and link up with Sosabowski&#x27;s force. These were followed after dark by tanks of the 4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards and infantry of the 5th Battalion Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry. Behind them, the rest of the 43rd Wessex Division was making its way up a narrow corridor.

In Oosterbeek, heavy fighting continued around the perimeter. Intense shelling and snipers increased the number of casualties at the aid posts in the hotels and houses of the town. Bittrich ordered that the attacks be stepped up and the British bridgehead north of the Rhine destroyed, and at 09:00 the major attacks began with the various &quot;Kampfgruppen&quot; of 9th SS attacking from the east and &quot;Kampfgruppe von Tettau&quot;″s units from the west. They made only small gains, but these attacks were followed by simultaneous attacks in the afternoon when the Germans made determined moves on the northern and eastern ends. To the north, they succeeded in briefly forcing back the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, before the latter counterattacked and retook their positions. Urquhart realised the futility of holding the tactically unimportant tip however and ordered the units in the north to fall back and defend a shorter line. To the east, the remains of 10th Parachute Battalion were nearly annihilated in their small position on the main Arnhem road, but the Germans failed to gain any significant ground.

Two of Urquhart&#x27;s staff officers swam the Rhine during the day and made contact with Sosabowski&#x27;s HQ. It was arranged that six rubber boats should be supplied on the northern bank to enable the Poles to cross the river and come into the Oosterbeek perimeter. That night, the plan was put into operation, but the cable designed to run the boats across broke and the small oars were not enough to paddle across the fast-flowing river. Only 55 Poles made it across before light and only 35 of these made it into the perimeter.

===Day 7 – Saturday 23 September===
Spindler was ordered to switch his attacks further south to try to force the British away from the river, isolating the British from any hope of reinforcement and allowing them to be destroyed. Despite their best efforts, however, they were unsuccessful, although the constant artillery and assaults continued to wear the British defences down further.

A break in the weather allowed the RAF to finally fly combat missions against the German forces surrounding Urquhart&#x27;s men. Hawker Typhoons and Republic P-47 Thunderbolts strafed German positions throughout the day and occasionally duelled with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; over the battlefield. The RAF attempted their final resupply flight from Britain on the Saturday afternoon, but lost eight planes for little gain to the airborne troops. Some small resupply efforts would be made from Allied airfields in Europe over the next two days but to little effect.

South of the river, the Poles prepared for another crossing. That night, they awaited the arrival of assault boats from XXX Corps, but these did not arrive until after midnight, and many were without oars. The crossings started at 03:00, with fire support from the 43rd Wessex Division. Through the remaining hours of darkness, only 153 men were able to cross – less than ¼ of the hoped for reinforcement.

===Day 8 – Sunday 24 September===
In the morning, Horrocks visited the Polish positions at Driel to see the front for himself. Later, he held a conference attended by Browning, Major-General Ivor Thomas of the 43rd (Wessex) Division and Sosabowski at Valburg. In a controversial meeting in which Sosabowski was politically outmanoeuvred, it was decided that another crossing would be attempted that night. When the Germans cut the narrow supply road near Nijmegen later that day, it seems that Horrocks realised the futility of the situation and plans were drawn up to withdraw the 1st Airborne Division.

In Oosterbeek, the situation was desperate; Hackett was wounded in the morning and had to give up the eastern command. The RAF attempted some close support around the perimeter which just held but shelling and sniping increased casualties by the hour. The aid stations were occupied by 2,000 men, British, German and Dutch civilian casualties. Because many aid posts were in the front line, in homes taken over earlier in the battle, the odd situation was created where casualties were evacuated forward rather than rearwards. Without evacuation, the wounded were often injured again and some posts changed hands between the British and Germans several times as the perimeter was fought over.
During the fighting around Oosterbeek, there had been short, local truces around the aid posts to allow the wounded to reach them, but on Sunday Colonel Graeme Warrackthe senior medical officerasked Urquhart permission to arrange a truce. Warrack was taken to see Bittrich who agreed and offered Warrack as many supplies as he could carry. Between 15:00 and 17:00, a general ceasefire began around the perimeter and about 450 stretcher cases and walking wounded were evacuated from the perimeter, the Germans using jeeps and ambulances to take serious cases straight to Saint Elisabeth Hospital in Arnhem where British, German and Dutch medical staff worked together.

That night, the Allies on the south side of the river attempted another crossing. The plan called for 4th Battalion, the Dorset Regiment and the 1st Polish Parachute Battalion to cross at 22:00 using boats and DUKWs. Sosabowski was furious at having to give up control of one of his battalions and thought the plan dangerous but was overruled. The boats took until 1:00 a.m. to arrive, several having been destroyed or lost &quot;en route&quot;; in a last-minute change of plan, only the Dorsets would cross. The small boats, without skilled crews, the strong current and poor choice of landing site on the north bank meant that of the 315 men who embarked, only a handful reached the British lines on the other side. The DUKWs and most boats landed too far downstream and at least 200 men were captured.

===Day 9 – Monday 25 September===

During the night, a copy of the withdrawal plan was sent across the river to Urquhart. Despite the obviously frustrating content, Urquhart knew there was little other choice. He radioed Thomas at 08:00 and agreed to the plan, provided it went ahead that night. The Airborne forces would need to endure another day in their perimeter. More men were evacuated from the aid posts throughout the day, but there was no official truce and this was sometimes done under fire. At 10:00, the Germans began their most successful assault on the perimeter, attacking the south-eastern end with infantry supported by newly arrived Tiger tanks. This assault pushed through the defenders&#x27; outer lines and threatened to isolate the bulk of the division from the river. Strong counter-attacks from the defenders and concentrated shellfire from south of the river eventually repulsed the Germans.

Urquhart made his withdrawal plan on the model used in the evacuation of Gallipoli during the First World War. The northernmost units would fall back first, moving through the more southerly groups, who would then follow behind. The glider pilots would organise the routes to the river and the operation would be covered by an intense artillery bombardment from XXX Corps. South of the river, the evacuation was organised and staffed by men of the 43rd (Wessex) divisional engineers and Royal Canadian Engineers, using rafts and storm boats. To keep the operation secret, the plan was not announced until the afternoon and some men (mainly wounded) would remain to provide covering fire through the night. Men were ordered to muffle their boots and weapons to help them bypass German incursions into the perimeter. Some men took the opportunity to shave before withdrawing, providing quite a morale boost.

By 21:00, heavy rain had begun to fall, which helped disguise the withdrawal. The bombardment commenced and the units began to fall back to the river. Half of the engineers&#x27; boats were too far west to be used (the 43rd (Wessex) Division mistakenly believing the crossing points used by the Dorsets the previous night were in British hands), slowing the evacuation. The Germans shelled the withdrawal, believing it to be a supply attempt. At 05:00, the operation was ended lest the coming light enable the Germans to fire onto the boats more accurately. A total of 2,163 Airborne men, 160 Poles, 75 Dorsets and several dozen other men were evacuated, but about 300 men were left behind on the northern bank when the operation was stopped, and 95 men were killed overnight during the evacuation.

During the morning of 26 September, the Germans pressed home their attacks and cut off the bridgehead from the river. It was not until about noon that they realised the British had gone. Later in the day, they rounded up about 600 men, mostly wounded in aid stations and those left behind on the north bank, as well as some pockets of resistance that had been out of radio contact with division headquarters and did not know about the withdrawal. Some of the British and Polish paratroopers managed to avoid capture by the Germans and were sheltered by the Dutch underground. They would be hidden in various houses in the towns and villages, or in huts or makeshift dens in the woods, for around a month until they could be rescued in Operation Pegasus on 22 October 1944.

==Aftermath==

The Allies withdrew from the southern bank of the Rhine and the front remained on &quot;the island&quot; between the Rhine and Waal rivers. The Germans counter-attacked in October at the Battle of the Nijmegen salient and were repulsed; the front line in the area remained stable until after the winter. The bridgeheads across the Maas and Waal served as an important base for operations against the Germans on the Rhine and Operation Veritable into Germany.

The Polish Brigade was moved to Nijmegen to defend the withdrawal of British troops in Operation Berlin, before returning to England in early October. Shortly afterwards, the British scapegoated Sosabowski and the Polish Brigade for the failure at Arnhem, perhaps to cover their own failings. On 17 October, Montgomery informed Alan BrookeChief of the Imperial General Staffthat he felt the Polish forces had &quot;fought very badly&quot; at Arnhem and that he did not want them under his command. David Bennett wrote that Montgomery had almost certainly been fed gross misinformation that supported his prejudices.

A month later, Browning wrote a long letter, highly critical of Sosabowski, to Brooke&#x27;s deputy. In it, he accused Sosabowski of being difficult, unadaptable, argumentative and &quot;loth to play his full part in the operation unless everything was done for him and his brigade&quot;. It is possible that Browning wanted unfairly to blame Sosabowski, although it may equally have been the work of officers of the 43rd Division. Browning recommended that Sosabowski be replaced – suggesting Lieutenant Colonel Jachnik or Major Tonn – and in December the Polish government in exile duly dismissed him, in a move almost certainly made under British pressure.

Carlo D&#x27;Este wrote &quot;Sosabowski, an experienced and highly competent officer, was removed because he had become an embarrassment to Browning&#x27;s own ineptitude. Had Sosabowski&#x27;s counsel been heeded the battle might have been won, even at the eleventh hour.&quot; Although it may be fair to say that Sosabowski was difficult to work with, his scapegoating is judged a disgrace in the accounts of many historians. Brian Urquhartwho had done so much to warn his superiors about the dangers of Arnhemdescribed the criticism of Sosabowski and the brigade as &quot;grotesque&quot; and his dismissal as a &quot;shameful act&quot;.

Arnhem was a victory for the Germans (albeit tempered by their losses further south) and a defeat for the Second Army. Many military commentators and historians believe that the failure to secure Arnhem was not the fault of the airborne forces (who had held out for far longer than planned) but of the operation. John Frost noted that &quot;by far the worst mistake was the lack of priority given to the capture of Nijmegen Bridge&quot; and was unable to understand why Browning had ordered Brigadier General James M. Gavin, the commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, to secure the Groesbeek Heights &quot;before&quot; Nijmegen Bridge. In his analysis of the battle, Martin Middlebrook believed the &quot;failure of Browning to give the 82nd US Airborne Division a greater priority in capturing the bridge at Nijmegen&quot; was only just behind the weakness of the air plan in importance.

In his assessment of the German perspective at Arnhem, Robert Kershaw concluded that &quot;the battle on the Waal at Nijmegen proved to be the decisive event&quot; and that Arnhem became a simple matter of containment after the British had retreated into the Oosterbeek perimeter. After that, it was merely &quot;a side-show to the crisis being enacted on the Waal&quot;. Heinz Harmel asserted that &quot;The Allies were stopped in the south just north of Nijmegen – that is why Arnhem turned out as it did&quot;. Gavin commented that &quot;there was no failure at Arnhem. If, historically, there remains an implication of failure it was the failure of the ground forces to arrive in time to exploit the initial gains of the [1st] Airborne Division&quot;.

The air plan was a grave weakness in the events at Arnhem. Middlebrook believes that the refusal to consider night drops, two lifts on day 1 or a &quot;coup-de-main&quot; assault on Arnhem bridge were &quot;cardinal fundamental errors&quot; and that the failure to land nearer the bridge threw away the airborne force&#x27;s most valuable asset – that of surprise. Frost believed that the distance from the drop zones to the bridge and the long approach on foot was a &quot;glaring snag&quot; and was highly critical of the &quot;unwillingness of the air forces to fly more than one sortie in the day [which] was one of the chief factors that mitigated against success&quot;.

The Allies&#x27; failure to secure a bridge over the Lower Rhine spelled the end of Market Garden. While all other objectives had been achieved, the failure to secure the Arnhem road bridge over the Rhine meant that the operation failed in its ultimate objective. Montgomery claimed that the operation was 90 per cent successful and the Allies had driven a deep salient into German-occupied territory that was quickly reinforced. Milton Shulman observed that the operation had driven a wedge into the German positions, isolating the 15th Army north of Antwerp from the First Parachute Army on the eastern side of the bulge. This complicated the supply problem of the 15th Army and removed the chance of the Germans being able to assemble enough troops for a serious counter-attack to retake Antwerp. Chester Wilmot agreed with this, claiming that the salient was of immense tactical value for the purpose of driving the Germans from the area south of the Maas and removing the threat of an immediate counterattack against Antwerp. Kershaw wrote that the north flank of the west wall was not turned and the 15th Army was able to escape. John Warren wrote that the Allies controlled a salient leading nowhere. John Waddy wrote that the strategic and tactical debate of Market Garden will never be resolved.

Arnhem was described as &quot;a tactical change of plan, designed to meet a favourable local situation within the main plan of campaign,&quot; but the result &quot;dispelled the hope that the enemy would be beaten before the winter. First and Third U.S. Armies had already been checked, the former at Aachen and in the Ardennes, the latter at Metz and south of Nancy. The failure to outflank the Siegfried Line finally dictated the pause in the general advance which Montgomery had feared&quot; and meant that General Dwight D. Eisenhower &quot;turned to Antwerp, which despite the long-delayed capture of Le Havre on 12 September, of Brest on 18 September and of Calais on 30 September, remained, as the closest, largest and best-preserved of the ports, the necessary solution to the difficulties of supply.

===Allied casualties===
The battle was a costly defeat and the 1st Airborne Division never recovered. Three-quarters of the division were missing when it returned to England, including two of the three brigade commanders, eight of the nine battalion commanders and 26 of the 30 infantry company commanders. About 500 men were in hiding north of the Rhine and many of these were able to escape during the winter, initially in Operation Pegasus. New recruits, escapees and repatriated POWs joined the division over the coming months but the division was still so understrength that the 4th Parachute Brigade had to merge with the 1st Parachute Brigade; the division could barely produce two brigades of infantry. Between May and August 1945, many of the men were sent to Denmark and Norway to oversee Operation Doomsday, the German surrenders; on their return the division was disbanded. The Glider Pilot Regiment suffered the highest proportion of fatalities during the battle (17.3 per cent) and was so depleted that in Operation Varsity, RAF pilots flew many of the gliders. As glider operations were abolished after the war, the regiment shrank and was eventually disbanded in 1957.



===Axis casualties===

German casualty figures are less complete than those of the Allies and official figures have never been released. A signal, possibly sent by II SS Panzer Corps on 27 September, listed 3,300 casualties (1,300 killed and 2,000 injured) around Arnhem and Oosterbeek. Robert Kershaw&#x27;s assessment of the incomplete records identified &quot;at least&quot; 2,500 casualties. In the &quot;Roll of Honour: Battle of Arnhem 17–26 September 1944&quot;, J.A. Hey of the &quot;Society of Friends of the Airborne Museum, Oosterbeek&quot; identified 1,725 German dead from the Arnhem area. All of these figures are significantly higher than Model&#x27;s conservative estimate of 3,300 casualties for the entire Market Garden area of battle (which included Eindhoven and Nijmegen).

===Arnhem===
Dutch records suggest that at least 453 civilians died during the battle, either as a result of Allied bombing on the first day or during the subsequent fighting. After the battle, the residents of Arnhem and its surrounding towns and villages were evicted from their homes, allowing the Germans to turn the north bank of the Rhine into an elaborate defensive position. Residents were not allowed to return home without a permit, and most did not return until after the war. The Dutch homes were then systematically looted, with the spoils being sent to bombing victims in Germany. The Germans continued to fight the Allies on the &#x27;Island&#x27; between Arnhem and Nijmegen. On 7 October, the Arnhem bridge was bombed and destroyed by Martin B-26 Marauders of 344th Bomb Group, USAAF. The buildings of Arnhem were bombarded by the Allies over the next few months and suffered further during the Liberation of Arnhem in April 1945.

==Honours and memorials==

Although the battle was a disaster for the British 1st Airborne Division, their fight north of the Rhine is considered an example of courage and endurance and one of the greatest feats of arms in the Second World War. Despite being the last great failure of the British Army, Arnhem has become a byword for the fighting spirit of the British people and has set a standard for the Parachute Regiment. Montgomery claimed that &quot;in years to come it will be a great thing for a man to be able to say: &#x27;I fought at Arnhem&#x27;&quot;, a prediction seemingly borne out by the pride of soldiers who took part, and the occasional desire of those who did not to claim that they were there.

Within days of Operation Berlin, the British returned to a heroes&#x27; welcome in England. A list of 59 decorations was quickly published for the 2,000 men who had returned and an investiture ceremony for the division was held at Buckingham Palace in December. Decorations for the 6,000 who had not returned were not published until September 1945 and numbered only 25. Five of the British participants in the battle were awarded Britain&#x27;s highest award for gallantry, the Victoria Cross. Four were members of the Airborne forces and one was from the RAF. They were:
* Lance-Sergeant John Baskeyfield, 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment
* Major Robert Cain, 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment
* Flight Lieutenant David Lord 271 Squadron, Royal Air Force
* Captain Lionel Queripel, 10th Battalion, Parachute Regiment
* Lieutenant John Grayburn, 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment

The British and Commonwealth system of battle honours recognised participation in fighting at Arnhem in 1956, 1957 and 1958 by the award of the battle honour Arnhem 1944 to six units. After the liberation of the Netherlands, the Grave Registration units of 2nd Army began the task of identifying the British dead. They were buried together in a field that is on permanent loan to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission just north of Oosterbeek. There are nearly 1,800 graves in what is now known as the Airborne Cemetery, ¾ of which are for those killed during the 1944 battle. By 2003, there were still 138 men unaccounted for, and human remains, equipment and weaponry continue to be dug up in the farmland around the city.

In Germany, the battle was treated as a great victory and eight men were awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross. The German dead were gathered and buried in the &quot;SS Heroes Cemetery&quot; near Arnhem, but after the war they were reburied in Ysselsteyn.
The shattered Arnhem road bridge was briefly replaced by a succession of Bailey bridges before being rebuilt in the same style as the original. It was renamed &quot;John Frostbrug&quot; (literally &#x27;John Frost Bridge&#x27;) on 17 December 1977. On 31 May 2006, HM Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands conferred two honours on the Polish forces who fought at the battle. The Polish 1st Independent Airborne Brigade was awarded the Dutch Military William Order for gallantry and Stanisław Sosabowski was posthumously awarded the Bronze Lion. In February of that year, an appeal was launched to raise funds so that a memorial to General Sosabowski and the brigade could be erected. The memorial was unveiled in September 2006 in a ceremony that sought to undo the injustice of 1944.

Eusebius Church, which was largely destroyed, also lost its 32-bell carillon dating back to 1652. Petit &amp; Fritsen constructed a new, 49-bell carillon for the reconstructed church between 1958 and 1964. Since then, the carillon became associated with the yearly war memorial services held each May. In 1994, fifty years after the Battle of Arnhem, four bass bells were added to the instrument, with the largest funded by several English organisations. One of the 1994 bells features a quote from the book &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; and the film adaptation.

The Hotel Hartenstein, used by Urquhart as his headquarters, is now the home of the Airborne Museum. Several other memorials were built in Arnhem and Oosterbeek, and an annual parade is held in the area. A memorial near the museum reads:

To the People of Gelderland; 50 years ago British and Polish Airborne soldiers fought here against overwhelming odds to open the way into Germany and bring the war to an early end. Instead we brought death and destruction for which you have never blamed us. This stone marks our admiration for your great courage remembering especially the women who tended our wounded. In the long winter that followed your families risked death by hiding Allied soldiers and Airmen while members of the resistance led many to safety.
==In popular culture==
The progress of the battle was widely reported in the British press, thanks largely to the efforts of two BBC reporters (Stanley Maxted and Guy Byam) and three journalists (newspaper reporters Alan Wood of the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and Jack Smyth of Reuters) who accompanied the British forces. The journalists had their reports sent back almost daily – ironically making communication with London at a time when Divisional Signals had not. The division was also accompanied by a three-man team from the Army Film and Photographic Unit who recorded much of the battle – including many of the images on this page.

In 1945, Louis Hagen, a Jewish refugee from Germany and a British army glider pilot present at the battle, wrote &quot;Arnhem Lift&quot;, believed to be the first book published about the events at Arnhem. In the same year filming began for the war movie &quot;Theirs is the Glory&quot;, which featured some original footage and used 120 Arnhem veterans as extras in most of the other scenes. In 1974 &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;, (Cornelius Ryan) brought the battle to a wider audience, as did Richard Attenborough&#x27;s adaptation of the book into the eponymous film in 1977. Frost, Urquhart and Arnhem veteran John Waddy were hired as military consultants.

The English author Richard Adams, an officer in the sea tail of 250th (Airborne) Light Company, Royal Army Service Corps, based the struggle of the anthropomorphised rabbits in his 1972 novel &quot;Watership Down&quot; (adapted into an animated film in 1978) on the adventures of the officers of the 250 Company of the 1st Airborne Division at Arnhem.

<text>A bank holiday is a national public holiday in the United Kingdom and the Crown Dependencies, and a colloquial term for a public holiday in Ireland. In the United Kingdom, the term refers to all public holidays, be they set out in statute, declared by royal proclamation, or held by convention under common law. In Ireland, there are some bank holidays which are not public holidays.

The term &quot;bank holiday&quot; refers to the fact that banking institutions typically close for business on such holidays, as they once used to do on certain saint&#x27;s days.

<text>François Élie Jules Lemaître (27 April 1853 – 4 August 1914) was a French critic and dramatist.

==Biography==
Lemaître was born in Vennecy, Loiret. He became a professor at the University of Grenoble in 1883, but was already well known for his literary criticism, and in 1884 he resigned his position to devote his time to literature. Lemaître succeeded Jean-Jacques Weiss as drama critic of the &quot;Journal des Débats&quot;, and subsequently filled the same office on the &quot;Revue des Deux Mondes&quot;. His literary studies were collected under the title of &quot;Les Contemporains&quot; (7 series, 1886–99), and his dramatic feuilletons as &quot;Impressions de Théàtre&quot; (10 series, 1888–98).

Lemaître&#x27;s sketches of modern authors show great insight and unexpected judgment as well as gaiety and originality of expression. He was admitted to the French Academy on 16 January 1896. Lemaître&#x27;s political views were defined in &quot;La Campagne Nationaliste&quot; (1902), lectures delivered in the provinces by him and by Godefroy Cavaignac.

Lemaître conducted a nationalist campaign in the &quot;Écho de Paris&quot;, and was for some time president of the Ligue de la Patrie Française.
The Ligue originated in 1898 with three young academics, Louis Dausset, Gabriel Syveton and Henri Vaugeois, who wanted to show that Dreyfusism was not accepted by all at the University.
They launched a petition that attacked Émile Zola and what many saw as an internationalist, pacifist left-wing conspiracy.
Charles Maurras gained the interest of the writer Maurice Barrès, and the movement gained the support of three eminent personalities: the geographer Marcel Dubois, the poet François Coppée and the critic and Jules Lemaître.

Lemaître resigned from the Ligue de la Patrie Française 1904, and dedicated the rest of his life to writing.
He died in Tavers, aged 61.

<text>This article lists political parties in the Netherlands. The country has a multi-party system with numerous political parties, and any one party has little chance of gaining power alone; parties work with each other to form coalition governments.

The lower house of the legislature, the House of Representatives, is elected by a national party-list system of proportional representation. There is no threshold for getting a seat, so a party will win a seat with only two-thirds percent of the national vote, roughly one seat for every 67,000 votes.

The first national political party was the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP), founded in 1879.

No party has come close to winning a majority of seats since the introduction of proportional representation in 1918. All governments since then have been coalitions between two or more parties. However, there is a broad consensus on the basic principles of the political system, with all parties having to adjust their goals to some extent in order to have a realistic chance at being part of the government.

<text>A domain name registry is a database of all domain names and the associated registrant information in the top level domains of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet that enables third party entities to request administrative control of a domain name. Most registries operate on the top-level and second-level of the DNS.

A registry operator, sometimes called a network information center (NIC), maintains all administrative data of the domain and generates a zone file which contains the addresses of the nameservers for each domain. Each registry is an organization that manages the registration of domain names within the domains for which it is responsible, controls the policies of domain name allocation, and technically operates its domain. It may also fulfill the function of a domain name registrar, or may delegate that function to other entities.

Domain names are managed under a hierarchy headed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which manages the top of the DNS tree by administrating the data in the root nameservers. IANA also operates the int registry for intergovernmental organizations, the arpa zone for protocol administration purposes, and other critical zones such as root-servers.net. IANA delegates all other domain name authority to other domain name registries and a full list is available on their web site. Country code top-level domains (ccTLD) are delegated by IANA to national registries such as DENIC in Germany and Nominet in the United Kingdom.

== Operation ==

Some name registries are government departments (e.g., the registry for India &quot;gov.in&quot;). Some are co-operatives of Internet service providers (such as DENIC) or not-for profit companies (such as Nominet UK). Others operate as commercial organizations, such as the US registry (&quot;nic.us&quot;).

The allocated and assigned domain names are made available by registries by use of the WHOIS system and via their domain name servers.

Some registries sell the names directly, and others rely on separate entities to sell them. For example, names in the .com top-level domains are in some sense sold &quot;wholesale&quot; at a regulated price by VeriSign, and individual domain name registrars sell names &quot;retail&quot; to businesses and consumers.

== Policies ==
=== Allocation policies ===

Historically, domain name registries operated on a first-come-first-served system of allocation but may reject the allocation of specific domains on the basis of political, religious, historical, legal or cultural reasons. For example, in the United States, between 1996 and 1998, InterNIC automatically rejected domain name applications based on a list of perceived obscenities and sanctioned hate-based domains. However, enforcement was not always consistent. In 2017, a request to register the domain fucknazis.com was first granted and then denied. A challenge to this ruling resulted in elimination of the “seven dirty words” policy for registration of US Domain Names based on first amendment grounds. 

Registries may also control matters of interest to their local communities; for example, the German, Japanese and Polish registries have introduced internationalized domain names to allow use of local non-ASCII characters.

=== Dispute policies ===
Domains that are registered with ICANN registrars, generally have to use the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP), however, Germany&#x27;s DENIC requires people to use the German civil courts, and Nominet UK deals with intellectual property and other disputes through its own dispute resolution service.

== Third-level domains ==
Domain name registries may also impose a system of third-level domains on users.
DENIC, the registry for Germany (.de), does not impose third level domains. AFNIC, the registry for France (.fr), has some third level domains, but not all registrants have to use them.

Many ccTLDs have moved from compulsory third or fourth-level domain to the availability of registrations of second level domains. Among them are .us (April 2002), .mx (May 2009), .co (March 2010), and .uk (June 2014).

<text>Simon John Ritchie (10 May 1957 – 2 February 1979), better known by his stage name Sid Vicious, was an English musician, best known as the second bassist for the punk rock band Sex Pistols. Despite dying in 1979 at the age of 21, he remains an icon of the punk subculture; one of his friends noted that he embodied &quot;everything in punk that was dark, decadent and nihilistic.&quot;

==Early life==
Simon John Ritchie was born in Lewisham to John and Anne Ritchie (&quot;nee&quot; McDonald; later named Anne Beverley; 1936–1996). Anne had dropped out of school and joined the British Army, where she met Ritchie&#x27;s father, a guardsman at Buckingham Palace and a semi-professional trombone player on the London jazz scene. Shortly after Ritchie&#x27;s birth, he and his mother moved to Ibiza, where they expected to be joined by his father, who did not appear and provided no financial support—Anne reportedly sold marijuana to get by. With the help of the British Embassy in Spain, Anne returned to England and, in 1965, married Christopher Beverley, who died six months later of kidney failure. Anne and Ritchie settled in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, where they lived from 1965 to 1971, and where Ritchie attended Sandown Court School (later renamed The Skinners&#x27; Kent Academy). In 1971, the pair moved to Stoke Newington in Hackney, East London, where Ritchie attended Clissold Park School (later renamed Stoke Newington School). At this time, Ritchie began using the name &#x27;John Beverley&#x27;.

By 1973, Anne&#x27;s life was consumed by her addiction to heroin, to the point where, as Ritchie&#x27;s friend John Wardle claimed in a 2009 interview, she was unaware that her son was attending Kingsway College of Further Education (later known as Westminster Kingsway College), which was a community and vocational school for students with difficulties. While at Kingsway, which he was likely attending to complete his O levels, Ritchie told a counsellor that he was contemplating suicide. When Ritchie turned 16 that year, Anne kicked him out of her home. In a 1988 interview, Anne said: &quot;I remember saying to him: &#x27;It&#x27;s either you or me, and it&#x27;s not going to be me. I have got to try to preserve myself and you just fuck off.&#x27; He said: &#x27;I&#x27;ve not got anywhere to go,&#x27; and I said: &#x27;I don&#x27;t care.&#x27;&quot; 

In 1973, Ritchie met fellow Kingsway student John Lydon, who introduced him to his friends John Grey and John Wardle. All four, who became known locally as &#x27;The Four Johns&#x27;, quit school and began squatting in various dingey locations. Three of the four Johns would then take nicknames: Lydon nicknamed Ritchie &quot;Sid Vicious&quot; after Ritchie was bitten by Lydon&#x27;s hamster Sid (named after Syd Barrett); Lydon was dubbed &quot;Johnny Rotten&quot; by his bandmate, guitarist Steve Jones; and Ritchie nicknamed Wardle &quot;Jah Wobble&quot;.

The four young men started hanging around the King&#x27;s Road in Chelsea, London which was a centre for music and fashion. A favourite spot was Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood&#x27;s clothing store, Sex. There, Vicious met American expatriate Chrissie Hynde, before she formed her group the Pretenders. According to her 2015 autobiography . Hynde convinced Vicious — by paying him £2 — to join her in a sham marriage to enable her to get a work permit and remain in the country, after John Lydon had already declined. The plan was thwarted by the register office being closed the day the &#x27;happy couple&#x27; turned up. According to Lydon, he and Vicious took up busking, with Lydon singing and occasionally playing the violin and Vicious playing a tambourine or an acoustic guitar. They would play Alice Cooper covers, and people gave them money to stop.

In 1975, Lydon, Steve Jones, Glen Matlock and Paul Cook, with McLaren as their manager, formed the Sex Pistols, the band Vicious would eventually join. Vicious was photographed watching the band attack their audience at the Nashville Rooms in Kensington in 1976.
Vicious then began his own musical career.

== The Flowers of Romance and Siouxsie and the Banshees (1976) ==
In 1976, Vicious co-founded, as vocalist and saxophone player, the Flowers of Romance along with the Clash co-founder guitarist Keith Levene, Viv Albertine and Palmolive (who would both go on to become the guitarist and the first drummer of the Slits respectively), and Kenny Morris (future drummer of Siouxsie and the Banshees) who would replace Palmolive who got kicked out of the band by Vicious after rejecting his advances. During this time, he learned to play bass by listening to the first Ramones album &quot;Ramones&quot;, fixating on the up-tempo bump-and-grind pattern of the song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Go Down to the Basement&quot;, a pattern he would apply to most of his playing from then on.

In June 1976, Vicious went to a Sex Pistols concert at the 100 Club. Nick Kent, who had played guitar with the Sex Pistols early on and had left music to become an &quot;NME&quot; music critic and champion of punk rock (and who was Hynde&#x27;s boyfriend), was also there, and was apparently blocking Vicious&#x27;s view. Vicious, high on speed, lashed Kent&#x27;s head with a rusted motorcycle chain which, according to Hynde, he carried with him. The incident was reported in the papers but no charges were laid.

Although the songs they wrote would later be performed by other bands, the Flowers of Romance did not perform live, or record any music. But Vicious came to the attention of members of the Damned. He was considered, along with Dave Vanian, for the position of lead singer, but Vicious failed to show up for the audition.

On 20 September 1976, Vicious appeared with Siouxsie and the Banshees, playing drums only at their first gig at the 100 Club Punk Special in London&#x27;s Oxford Street, a two-day festival co-founded by McLaren. The following day, Vicious went to the Damned&#x27;s performance. Drunk and high on amphetamines, he hurled his glass at the stage, attempting to strike Vanian. He missed, and the glass shattered against a pillar and blinded a woman in one eye. Vicious was arrested and imprisoned at Ashford Remand Centre. Westwood and Albertine visited Vicious in prison, with Albertine bringing the book &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; as a gift.

== Sex Pistols (1977–1978) ==

In February 1977, Sex Pistols&#x27; manager McLaren announced that Glen Matlock had been &quot;thrown out of the band&quot; because &quot;he liked the Beatles&quot;, and that he had been replaced by Vicious. In his autobiography &quot;I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol&quot;, Matlock says he quit because he was &quot;sick of all the bullshit&quot;. In the 2000 documentary &quot;The Filth and the Fury&quot;, the band members agreed that there was tension between Matlock and Rotten, but Matlock says that those tensions were aggravated by McLaren, who wanted to generate chaos in the band as a creative mechanism, and as a way of building the band&#x27;s image. He wanted Matlock to leave, and to replace him with Vicious, saying &quot;if Johnny Rotten is the voice of punk, then Vicious is the attitude&quot;.

Vicious had become the Sex Pistols&#x27; uber-fan, never missing a concert. He was encouraged to be drunk and disorderly, with Wobble saying, &quot;Sid was offered up as a sacrificial lamb by the people around the Pistols. None of them would have gone over the top. He was their kamikaze pilot, and they were all too happy to strap him in and send him off.&quot;

In March 1977, the Sex Pistols were signed to A&amp;M Records. In celebration, they trashed the company&#x27;s offices, and then held a private party at the Speakeasy, a club and restaurant frequented by established members of the London music scene. The Sex Pistols members confronted the BBC DJ Bob Harris, who was the presenter of the &quot;Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;, a television show which featured non-chart music. Blocking Harris behind the bar, broken bottles in hand, they demanded to know when they would be on the show. A bar fight ensued. Vicious jammed a broken bottle into the face of BBC recording engineer George Nicholson. Harris was rescued by the Procol Harum road crew, who grouped around him and escorted him out of the club, where they found that police had had to cordon off the entire block. None of the Sex Pistols were arrested but, the next day, A&amp;M dropped them and Capital Radio banned all Sex Pistols music from its stations.

Vicious played his first gig with the Sex Pistols on 3 April 1977, at The Screen on the Green; his debut was filmed by Don Letts and appears in &quot;Punk Rock Movie&quot;. But he could not play well and had no bass experience, so guitarist Steve Jones played bass on the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot;. Vicious was allowed to play bass on one track, &quot;Bodies&quot;, but his contribution was later overdubbed by Jones. He also missed most of the band&#x27;s rehearsals and recording sessions because he was in hospital with hepatitis, likely caused by intravenous drug use. By this time, Vicious was using heroin, with many believing that his mother was his supplier. Dee Dee Ramone had seen him shooting drugs on more than one occasion, and Rotten&#x27;s friend John Gray had found Vicious shooting speed while he was still living with his mother; Vicious told him that the drugs were &quot;me mum&#x27;s&quot;.

Also in 1977, Vicious met Nancy Spungen, an American groupie living in London, who had a life-long history of unstable mental behavior and was also a heroin addict. Spungen, who had initially set her sights on Rotten and who supported herself by alternately dealing drugs and working as a topless dancer, made herself useful on the King&#x27;s Road scene by procuring drugs for musicians. She and Vicious became inseparable, which caused problems with the band, whose members did not like her; McLaren admitted to planning to have her abducted and forced onto a plane back to the United States. Vicious and Spungen had a volatile relationship; Vicious played nursemaid when she was sick and was shy and polite with her mother, who reported watching Spungen cut his meat for him. On the other hand, Spungen was known to be verbally abusive and physically aggressive. Vicious may have facilitated Spungen&#x27;s occasional prostitution (and watched). According to Rotten&#x27;s wife Nora Forster, Vicious often hit Spungen and, in her last conversation with her mother, Spungen admitted that beatings which she had previously said were at the hands of strangers actually came from Vicious. They shared an infatuation with knives.

Beginning in July, with Spungen in tow, the band went on a Scandinavian tour, then toured the Netherlands and the UK. On 28 October 1977, their only album, &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot; was released and, due in part to notoriety (particularly of the song &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;), and in spite of sales bans at major retailers, the album debuted at number one on the UK Album Charts and went gold on 17 November. It remained a best-seller for nearly a year, spending 48 weeks in the top 75. It is frequently listed as the most influential punk album of all time.

On 24 December 1977, the Sex Pistols played The Royal Links Pavilion, Cromer; the next day, the band played two shows at Ivanhoe&#x27;s in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. It was during the national Fire Brigades Strike and the band performed a matinee for the children of firefighters. In the 2013 documentary &quot;Never Mind the Baubles: Xmas &#x27;77 with the Sex Pistols&quot;, Lydon claimed that Vicious had to be warned not to be the &quot;hardcore, tough rocker bloke&quot; in front of the children. The track of Vicious singing the Johnny Thunders song &quot;Born to Lose&quot;, which appears on &quot;Sid Sings&quot;, was recorded during this performance, as Vicious stepped in when Lydon left the stage to pose as Father Christmas. These were the Sex Pistols&#x27; last performances in Britain, until the original members reunited for the Filthy Lucre Tour in 1996.

In January 1978, the Sex Pistols embarked on a two-week USA tour. There was rising tension within the band. Rotten was barely speaking to anyone. Warner Bros., which organized and staffed the tour, insisted that Vicious clean up his heroin habit, so he was using methadone. He was in a constant state of semi-withdrawal and furious that the band had blocked Spungen from accompanying them on the tour. McLaren had long been keeping Vicious on rations of $14.00 (US) a week but he still managed to find drugs. To make matters worse, McLaren, ever eager for more chaos and careful that journalists were on-scene, booked the band, not into the clubs of New York, but into bars in Louisiana, Georgia, Tennessee, and Texas. In San Antonio on 8 January, Vicious felt antagonised by an audience member and struck him on the head with his bass. Before the Sex Pistols took the stage of the Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas on 10 January, Vicious carved the words &quot;gimme a fix&quot; into his chest with a razor (later joking that &quot;if you try to kill yourself [with a razor to the chest], it won&#x27;t work&quot;). He greeted the audience by calling them &quot;cowboy faggots&quot;; in return, he was struck by a full can of beer to the head. The next night, 11 January, he punched a hole in the Green Room wall after the band&#x27;s show at Cain&#x27;s Ballroom in Tulsa. It was long rumoured that at their 14 January show at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, Vicious did not bother to plug in his bass at all, although video from the show makes it clear when Jones&#x27;s guitar cuts out during &quot;Bodies&quot; that Vicious was both playing bass and the right notes. There is also a pre-show soundcheck audio recording where Rotten says to turn Vicious down because his bass was too loud. At the end of the show, Johnny Rotten uttered the famous quote &quot;Ever get the feeling you&#x27;ve been cheated?&quot;, marking the end of the Sex Pistols.

== Post-Sex Pistols ==
On 19 January, Vicious boarded a flight from San Francisco to New York. By the time the plane landed at JFK Airport, he had slipped into a diazepam-, methadone- and alcohol-induced coma and was rushed to a hospital in Queens where, as he told the photographer Roberta Bayley, the doctor told him that if he did not quit drinking, he would be dead in six months.

When he was released, he re-united with Spungen. In April, the two travelled to Paris to film the Sex Pistols mockumentary &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot;, where they spent most of their time in their hotel room, doing drugs. Director Julien Temple was able to get Vicious to attend production long enough to record three song covers: &quot;C&#x27;mon Everybody&quot;, &quot;Something Else&quot; and &quot;My Way&quot;. When Vicious returned to his hotel, he found that Spungen had retaliated for being left alone by superficially cutting her wrists.

The couple then traveled to London where, by August, they needed to return to the US but had no money. Sid bumped into Glen Matlock, who by this point had founded the band Rich Kids, and suggested that they play a gig together. For this concert, Vicious and Matlock recruited Rich Kids guitarist and singer Steve New, and the Damned&#x27;s drummer Rat Scabies. They called themselves Vicious White Kids and performed once—at the Electric Ballroom in Camden Town on 15 August 1978. Vicious did not play bass in this band; he was the lead singer. Spungen joined on backing vocals but Matlock made sure that her microphone was not plugged in for the concert.

Vicious and Spungen then returned to New York, where they settled into Room 100 of the Hotel Chelsea (after causing a fire in their first room) as Mr. and Mrs. John Ritchie. Spungen acted as his manager, putting together the band of Steve Dior, Jerry Nolan and Arthur Kane and booking him into the New York club Max&#x27;s Kansas City. Spungen sang with him, and they were sometimes joined by Mick Jones and Johnny Thunders. He drew large crowds, though some performances were &quot;hellish&quot;, with the audience booing his attempted imitation of Rotten, and Vicious insulting the audience. Examples of this can be heard in the in-between tracks on his live album &quot;Sid Sings&quot;; these performances were also released in 2002 (and again in 2011), as &quot;Live at Max&#x27;s Kansas City, NY 1978&quot;. In the documentary &quot;Who Killed Nancy?&quot;, Dior said that Vicious &quot;got good money for those shows&quot; but Spungen often had to call her parents for money. In one of these conversations, Spungen said that she was having problems with her kidneys, and asked her mother to look into getting her, and Vicious, into a detox program.

== Death of Nancy Spungen ==

On the night of 11 October 1978, Vicious and Spungen hosted a party in their hotel room, during which Vicious took approximately 30 Tuinal tablets, and was comatose for the rest of the night while numerous people came and went. At about 11 a.m. the next day, hotel staff found Spungen dead on the bathroom floor, with a knife wound to her abdomen. Vicious was found wandering the hallway. He first claimed to have killed her, then said he remembered nothing. Two people who had been at the party stated that Spungen was alive at 5 a.m. The murder weapon was identified as a Jaguar K-11 hunting knife, which Spungen had purchased for Vicious a few days earlier. Vicious was arrested and charged with second-degree murder. He told police that he and Spungen had argued that night but gave conflicting versions of what happened next, saying, &quot;I stabbed her, but I never meant to kill her&quot; then saying that he did not remember anything, then that Spungen had fallen onto the knife. The arresting officer, Sgt. Thomas Kilroy of the Third Homicide Unit, said: &quot;... Vicious admitted killing Miss Spungen during a dispute.&quot;

Lawyer Michael Berger first dealt with the matter, but McLaren and Anne Beverley were lawyer-shopping. They interviewed several high-profile lawyers, including Melvin Belli, Gerald B. Lefcourt and William Kunstler before settling on F. Lee Bailey. Bailey never appeared in court, but another lawyer from his firm, Jim Merberg, arranged for Vicious to be released on $50,000 bail, with the conditions that he not leave New York and that he sign in daily at the Third Homicide Unit offices, and at the Lafayette Street Methadone Center. All legal costs were paid by the Sex Pistols&#x27; label, Virgin Records. Vicious returned to the Chelsea Hotel, where he was joined by McLaren and his mother.

McLaren firmly believed that Vicious was innocent. Noting that the knife was left in plain view and that the couple kept their cash in a drawer, he believed that Spungen caught one of the party guests stealing money and was stabbed by that person. Given the number of people who had been through the hotel room on the night of the murder, Bailey had his investigator look into the possibility that a third party was involved in Spungen&#x27;s death.

Bailey also hired forensic psychiatrist Dr. Stephen Teich to evaluate Vicious. After their initial conversation, during which Vicious was preoccupied by the &#x27;working class in Berlin&#x27; and remained fixated on the television, Teich told Anne Beverley that Vicious must not be left alone. Hours later, Beverley called Teich and said that Vicious had slashed his arms with a smashed light bulb. Teich returned to the hotel and called an ambulance. EMS staff arrived with the police; when Vicious saw them, he headed for the window but was blocked by Teich. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital and then moved to the New York-Presbyterian Westchester Behavioral Health Center in White Plains, New York. He was released on 26 November and returned to the Chelsea. At this time, Rotten tried to contact Vicious, but his calls were barred by Beverley and McLaren. On 28 November, Vicious was interviewed by the Irish journalist Bernard Clarke. He said that Spungen&#x27;s death was &quot;meant to happen&quot; and that &quot;Nancy always said she&#x27;d die before she was 21&quot;. He said that he just wanted to have fun. When asked where he would like to be, he replied, &quot;Under the ground&quot;.

In the meantime, McLaren announced that the Sex Pistols would reunite to record a Christmas album to benefit Vicious&#x27;s defence, and sold T-shirts with the slogan, &quot;She&#x27;s Dead, I&#x27;m Alive, I&#x27;m Yours.&quot;

===Theories about the killer===
In his 2007 book &quot;Pretty Vacant: A History of Punk&quot;, director Phil Strongman stated his conviction that it was actor Rockets Redglare who killed Nancy Spungen, noting that Redglare not only knew about the large amounts of cash kept in the bedside table, but also brought the Tuinal to the party. Redglare, who died in 2001, had publicly denied this but privately confessed it to friends. However, Howie Pyro insisted that it was Redglare&#x27;s habit to tell stories to gain attention. Strongman also implicated Redglare&#x27;s friend, punk rocker Neon Leon, who lived down the hall from Vicious and Spungen and was found to be in possession of many of Vicious&#x27;s belongings, including his leather jacket. Leon claimed that Vicious had given the items to him for safe-keeping. He later surrendered them to police. Lester Bangs also told &quot;The Village Voice&quot; that he telephoned Leon after Spungen&#x27;s death and that Leon had told him he knew who the murderer was, but refused to name the person. Leon has since claimed, in two memoirs, that he had already left the Chelsea Hotel when Bangs claimed to have called him there.

== Assault on Todd Smith ==
By December, Vicious had started dating rocker Judy Nylon as well as fellow drug addicts Connie Gripp (ex-girlfriend of Dee Dee Ramone) and Michelle Robinson, an aspiring actress. On 5 December 1978, Vicious went to the Hurrah nightclub with Boothe, photographers David Still and Peter Kodick Gravelle, and the comedian and drug-dealer Rockets Redglare who had appointed himself Vicious&#x27;s bodyguard. Playing that night was Skafish; their drum roadie, Tarrah, was the girlfriend of Todd Smith (Patti Smith&#x27;s brother). Vicious began flirting with Tarrah. She rebuffed him and he pinched her. Smith told him to back off and Vicious smashed a beer bottle and jammed it into Smith&#x27;s face. Smith required five stitches. Redglare told police that Smith provoked Vicious, that the bottle broke in Vicious&#x27;s hand and, producing the glass shards, said that Smith&#x27;s wound was the accidental result of flying glass. On 7 December, Vicious was arrested and charged with assault. The judge agreed that Vicious had broken the terms of his previous bail and sent him to Rikers Island, where he underwent opiate detoxification. While he was in Rikers, Anne Beverley brought Robinson to visit her son.

On 18 January, Vicious appeared in court, represented by Jim Merberg. To everyone&#x27;s surprise, the judge, James Leff, not only released Vicious on $10,000.00 bail, but reduced his previous bail conditions—he now had to report to the Homicide Unit only three days a week and did not have to appear at the methadone centre at all. Leff applied one condition—that Vicious not frequent night clubs.

While it was widely reported, including by Rotten, that Mick Jagger paid Vicious&#x27; bail, that was untrue; Virgin Records continued to pay his legal fees. Anne Beverley, who was in court with Robison, was happy with the outcome, telling reporters &quot;Now the public will know he is a good boy.&quot;

== Death and aftermath ==

On the morning of 1 February 1979, after completing his detoxification program, Vicious was released from Rikers Island. He arrived in Manhattan, and by chance, met his friend Peter Gravelle. Vicious asked Gravelle to find him some heroin. Gravelle brought $200 worth of the drug to the apartment of Michelle Robinson at 63 Bank Street, where he joined Vicious, Robinson, Beverley, Jerry Only of the band Misfits, Eileen Polk, Jerry Nolan of the Heartbreakers, Esther Herskovits, and Howie Pyro. Gravelle said that they sat around doing drugs, and he left at 3:00 a.m. 

Only said that he and Anne Beverley made dinner, and that he, Polk, and Pyro left early, when the heroin use began. He noted that Vicious was already nodding off, and around 11:00 p.m., he &quot;picked him up and slapped him around&quot; before Beverley put a blanket over him and told Only &quot;that he&#x27;d be okay. I was like, he&#x27;s just been in prison for two months so he had to be clean so you know you can&#x27;t be messing with him.&quot; However, Gravelle said that Robinson gave Vicious four Tuinal (a barbiturate and a favourite of Sid&#x27;s) to help him sleep. Vicious died in the night of a drug overdose. Robinson and Beverley discovered his body the next morning, Friday, 2 February 1979.

Anne Beverley later claimed that Vicious and Spungen had made a suicide pact and that Vicious&#x27;s death was not accidental. She produced a handwritten note, which she said she found in the pocket of Vicious&#x27;s leather jacket, reading &quot;We had a death pact, and I have to keep my half of the bargain. Please bury me next to my baby. Bury me in my leather jacket, jeans and motorcycle boots. Goodbye.&quot; According to Deborah Spungen, Vicious wrote a letter to her when he was last hospitalized, saying approximately the same thing. &quot;We always knew that we would go to the same place when we died&quot;, he wrote. &quot;We so much wanted to die together in each other&#x27;s arms. I cry every time I think about that. I promised my baby that I would kill myself if anything ever happened to her, and she promised me the same. This is my final commitment to my love.&quot; Spungen was Jewish, and is buried in a Jewish cemetery in Pennsylvania. As an inter-faith burial was not possible, Sid&#x27;s body was cremated at Garden State Crematory in New Jersey. According to Polk, Beverley asked Deborah Spungen if she could scatter Vicious&#x27; ashes over Nancy&#x27;s grave and Spungen said no. Regardless, Polk said that Jerry Only drove Beverley, her sister, and two of Vicious&#x27; friends, to Nancy&#x27;s gravesite, where Beverley scattered Sid&#x27;s ashes.

By the time of Vicious&#x27;s death, he and Spungen were internationally notorious. His death made the front pages of most New York newspapers for days, and Robinson&#x27;s apartment building was thronged by reporters. Robinson would soon change her name. The first of many posthumous albums appeared in 1980; &quot;Sid Vicious&quot;, released by EMI sub-label Innocent Records, has as its jacket image the photo of Vicious&#x27;s body being removed from 63 Bank St.

== Legacy ==
Several online sources state that the estate of Sid Vicious continues to earn approximately $400,000 annually in royalties. These statements are not verified. In &quot;Lonely Boy&quot;, Jones states that Vicious&#x27; estate passed to maternal cousins.

In 1986, &quot;Vicious&quot;, an American play about the life of Sid Vicious premiered in Los Angeles and was the theater debut of actor George Clooney who played a male prostitute drug dealer. 

In 2006, the Sex Pistols were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The surviving members declined to attend the ceremony.

Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong said of Vicious: &quot;[He] was everything that&#x27;s cool about punk rock: a skinny rocker who had a ton of attitude, sort of an Elvis, James Dean kind of guy&quot;. Steven Severin of Siouxsie and the Banshees remembered Vicious in positive terms: &quot;Before he got deeply into drugs, he was one of the funniest guys. He had a brilliant sense of humour, goofy, sweet, and very cute.&quot; In 2009, Lydon told &quot;The Independent&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, God, for the day I brought Sid into the band. He felt so isolated, poor old Sid, because he wasn&#x27;t the sharpest knife on the block. The best aspect of his character, which was his humour, just vanished the day he joined the Pistols.&quot;

In 1996, Anne Beverley sold Vicious&#x27;s bass guitar– a white Fender Precision Bass with a black pickguard and a leather strap with the name &#x27;Sid&#x27; etched into it– to Steve Jones for £2,000.

On 20 January 2009, &quot;In Search of Sid&quot;, a 30-minute documentary about Vicious recorded by his close friend Jah Wobble was aired on the BBC Radio 4.

In 2011, a suit of Vicious&#x27;s sold at auction by Christie&#x27;s for £11,000.

As of 2025, Vicious-themed souvenirs are widely available for purchase. Many recordings with Vicious have been repeatedly released. His singles &quot;My Way&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Shit&quot; were last released by the American label Cleopatra Records in 2021. Also in 2021, Cleopatra&#x27;s sub-label, Anarchy Records, released the album &quot;Love Kills&quot;.

== Music tributes ==

Numerous bands have recorded songs about Vicious. In 1979, the band Helpless Huw released the four-track recording &quot;Sid Vicious Was Innocent&quot;. In 1982, the Exploited included the song &quot;Sid Vicious Was Innocent&quot; on their album &quot;Troops of Tomorrow&quot;. Former frontman for the Clash, Joe Strummer, recorded &quot;Love Kills&quot; and &quot;Dum Dum Club&quot; for the &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; soundtrack. In 1986, the Ramones released &quot;Love Kills&quot; on their album &quot;Animal Boy&quot;, which was a tribute to both Vicious and Spungen. In 1994, NOFX released &quot;Punk Guy&quot; on their album &quot;Punk in Drublic&quot;, which makes references to a number of famous punk rock musicians; the line &quot;Exudes a vicious disposition&quot; referencing Vicious. In 2017, Foster the People released &quot;Loyal Like Sid &amp; Nancy&quot;, which references Vicious and Spungen&#x27;s relationship, as the second single from their album &quot;Sacred Hearts Club&quot;. In 2015, Medusa released a music video to their song &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; which portrays the two as children. In 2017, Industrial Metal band Powerman 5000 released a single called &quot;Sid Vicious in a Dress,&quot; which is about a female punk rocker who exhibits similar chaos and violent nature of the former Sex Pistols bassist. In 2017, singer-songwriter Phoebe Bridgers recorded a track titled &quot;Chelsea&quot;, included on her debut album &quot;Stranger in the Alps&quot;. The track was originally a poem about Vicious and Spungen&#x27;s relationship in their final two months of life. In Remy Bond&#x27;s 2024 &#x27;Summer Song&#x27;, Sid and Nancy are mentioned in the line &quot;I want real love just like Sid and Nancy&quot;. 
In his 2022 album &quot;Mainstream Sellout&quot;, artist Machine Gun Kelly released a track titled &quot;Sid &amp; Nancy&quot;, about a couple who was deeply in love but shared some dark ideas. The song ends with the sound of two consecutive gunshots.

== Portrayals ==
The critically acclaimed 1986 film &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot;, directed by Alex Cox, portrays Vicious&#x27;s life from his joining the Sex Pistols to the end of his life. It stars Gary Oldman as Vicious and Chloe Webb as Nancy Spungen. Oldman&#x27;s performance was praised by &quot;Uncut&quot; as a &quot;hugely sympathetic reading of the punk figurehead as a lost and bewildered manchild&quot; though Oldman himself detested the film and punk music in general.

In 1993, Ade Edmondson played Vicious in &quot;The Comic Strip Presents: Demonella&quot;. In the film, which was directed by Paul Bartel, Vicious resides in Hell with Oscar Wilde, Adolf Hitler, Genghis Khan and Marie Antoinette.

The Foo Fighters&#x27; 1997 video for &quot;Everlong&quot; is about Vicious and Spungen, with Vicious defending Spungen against party demons. Dave Grohl and Taylor Hawkins play Vicious and Spungen, respectively.

Love, Springfieldian Style, the Valentine&#x27;s Day episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; 2008 season, spoofs Vicious and Spungen&#x27;s relationship.

In September 2009, the Roy Smiles play &quot;Kurt and Sid&quot; debuted at the Trafalgar Studios in London&#x27;s West End. The play, set in Kurt Cobain&#x27;s greenhouse on the day of his suicide, revolves around the ghost of Vicious visiting Cobain to try and convince him not to kill himself. Vicious was played by Danny Dyer.

In January 2021, FX announced that a series about the Sex Pistols, called &quot;Pistol&quot;, had gone into production, with Vicious to be portrayed by Louis Partridge. It is based on Steve Jones&#x27;s memoir &quot;Lonely Boy&quot; and is directed by Danny Boyle. Lydon called the series &quot;The most disrespectful shit I&#x27;ve ever had to endure&quot; and unsuccessfully sued to block the use of the Sex Pistols&#x27; music in the series.

<text>Julius Mosen (8 July 1803 – 10 October 1867) was a German poet and author of Jewish descent, associated with the Young Germany movement, and now remembered principally for his patriotic poem the &quot;Andreas-Hofer-Lied&quot;.

==Life==
Julius Mosen (Julius Moses) was born at Marieney in the Saxon Vogtland, the son of Johannes Gottlob Moses, the cantor and schoolmaster of Marieney. He studied at the &quot;Gymnasium&quot; in Plauen from 1817 to 1822, and afterwards studied law at the University of Jena. During a two-year-long visit to Italy, he received the inspiration that resulted several years later in his major works (&quot;Ritter Wahn&quot;, &quot;Cola Rienzi&quot;, &quot;Der Kongreß von Verona&quot;).

On his return, he finished his law studies at Leipzig, where he then worked as a lawyer. From 1835 to 1844 he was an independent advocate in Dresden. He had meanwhile shown great literary promise in his &quot;Lied vom Ritter Wahn&quot; (1831). This was followed by the more philosophical &quot;Ahasvar&quot; (1838), and by a volume of poems, &quot;Gedichte&quot; (1836, 2nd ed., 1843), among which &quot;Andreas Hofer&quot; and &quot;Die letzten Zehn vom vierten Regiment&quot; became popular. As an active freemason in Dresden he encountered several important literary figures, including Ludwig Tieck, Ludwig Uhland, Georg Herwegh, Richard Wagner and Gottfried Semper, and was soon himself reckoned to be among the best-known German poets.

He also wrote the historical plays &quot;Heinrich der Fünfte&quot; (Leipzig, 1836), &quot;Cola Rienzi, Die Bräute von Florenz, Wendelin und Helene&quot; and &quot;Kaiser Otto III&quot; (the four last being published in his &quot;Theater&quot; 1842). His tragedies were very well received and were performed at the Dresden court theatre (&quot;Dresdner Hofbühne&quot;). For his services to German theatre the faculty of Philosophy at the University of Jena awarded him an honorary doctorate.

In addition he tried his hand at fiction, in his only novel, the politico-historical &quot;Der Kongress von Verona&quot; (1842), and in a collection of short stories published in 1846, &quot;Bilder im Moose&quot;.

In 1844 the Grand Duke Paul Friedrich August von Oldenburg offered him the appointment of dramaturgist at the Court Theatre in Oldenburg, which he accepted, in the hope of putting into practice his vision of German national theatre. In the same year he had his family name changed from &quot;Moses&quot; to &quot;Mosen&quot; by Dresden ministerial decree. In 1846 he was stricken with paralysis as the result of a rheumatic illness, and after remaining bed-ridden for the rest of his life, died at Oldenburg on 10 October 1867. He was buried in the churchyard of St. Gertrude&#x27;s Chapel (&quot;Gertrudenfriedhof&quot;) in Oldenburg.

Of his later works may be mentioned &quot;Die Dresdner Gemäldegallerie&quot; (1844), and the tragedies &quot;Herzog Bernhard&quot; (1855) and &quot;Der Sohn des Fürsten&quot; (1858). A collection of his works, &quot;Sämtliche Werke&quot;, appeared in 8 volumes in 1863 (a new edition was produced by his son, with a biography, in 6 volumes in 1880).

== Artistic work ==
His best-known poem is the text of the &quot;Andreas-Hofer-Lied&quot; (&quot;Zu Mantua in Banden&quot;), the present anthem of the Austrian &quot;Bundesland&quot; of the Tyrol. Robert Schumann wrote a lied using as lyrics his poem &#x27;Der Nussbaum&#x27; (the walnut tree). German composer Georgina Schubert used his text for her lieder “Der traumende See.”

There are three principal themes in Mosen&#x27;s life and work: love of the home country, the battle for freedom, and the now-destroyed German-Jewish symbiosis.
In &quot;Erinnerungen&quot; (&quot;Memories&quot;), he writes of the &quot;dependency on the soil of home, the Vogtland&quot; that draws and holds the gaze &quot;as though yonder, far back in the distance beneath the sap-dripping pines, there where the mountains rise up like terraces in dark blue, some secret were hidden that lures us to it and that would gladly reveal itself to us&quot;. The Vogtländer for him are the &quot;Saxon Tyrolese, only pleasanter, livelier, more persistent in the pursuit of their goal, but just as sober, if also rougher.&quot;

<doc id="158293" wikidata="Q294862" url="?curid=158293" title="Marcus Furius Camillus">
<text>Marcus Furius Camillus (; possibly – ) is a semi-legendary Roman statesman and politician during the early Roman republic who is most famous for his capture of Veii and defence of Rome from Gallic sack after the Battle of the Allia. Modern scholars are dubious of Camillus&#x27; supposed exploits and believe many of them are wrongly attributed or otherwise wholly fictitious.

== Historicity ==

The traditional account of Camillus&#x27; life comes from Livy and Plutarch&#x27;s eponymous &quot;Life&quot;. But these were based on a larger annalistic tradition which painted Camillus as the dominant figure in this period of history; Livy, for his part, organised his fifth and sixth books around Camillus&#x27; career (Camillus enters public office at the start of the fifth book and leaves it at the end of the sixth). Little evidence of this tradition survives, though fragments of Quintus Claudius Quadrigarius&#x27; work indicate that the myth of Camillus was well-established by the 80s and 70s BC.

The &quot;name&quot; Camillus is attested in the Etruscan François Tomb, built near Vulci. One of the paintings therein describes a &quot;Gneve Tarchunies Rumach&quot; (probably Gnaeus Tarquinius the Roman) being killed by a &quot;Marce Camitlnas&quot; (possibly Marcus Camitilius or Marcus Camillus). It is not known, however, what specific legend the tomb depicts. Some scholars have suggested that Camitlnas refers to the Camillus of this article, but such attribution is problematic.

Scholars believe Camillus qua &quot;person&quot; probably existed: the , if believed, record his importance and influence in Roman public life at this time. But, in general, the quality of the sources – which interject &quot;plenty of myth, embellishment, and fantasy&quot; – led Mary Beard, in the book &quot;SPQR&quot;, to write &quot;Camillus is probably not much less fictional than the first Romulus&quot;. Mommsen, writing in &quot;Römisches Strafrecht&quot;, called Camillus&#x27; legend &quot;the most dishonest of all Roman legends&quot;. Tim Cornell, writing of Camillus, calls him &quot;the most artificially contrived of all Rome&#x27;s heroes&quot;.

Other scholars have suggested that Camillus emerged from a popular oral tradition which linked the &quot;names&quot; Camillus, Manlius Capitolinus, and Sulpicius to inscriptions placed on the temple of Juno Moneta (erected in 345 BC by Lucius Furius Camillus).

== Biography ==

The cognomen derives from the title of an aristocratic youth who helped in religious duties; it is possible that a young Camillus served in such a position. His filiation is identical with that of the consul of 413 BC, Lucius Furius Medullinus, which may indicate that Medullinus and Camillus were brothers.

=== Early career ===

Camillus is first firmly recorded as entering public office in 401 BC. He served in that year and again in 398 BC as consular tribune against the Falisci and the Capenates. Both were tribes near Rome and Veii. His first supposed office was that of censor (before having held any other public office) in the year 403 BC.

He was then supposed to have, as dictator, completed a campaign against Veii which saw the city captured in 396 BC. The specific story of Veii&#x27;s capture in Livy is mostly legendary. After a ten-year siege (the third Veientine war) – &quot;obviously modelled on the Greek legend of the Trojan war&quot; – the Alban Lake rises supernaturally after a supposed prophecy of Veii&#x27;s destruction in its &quot;Books of Fate&quot;. The Romans then extirpate the prodigy by building a tunnel to drain the lake after being so instructed by the oracle at Delphi. Camillus, as commander, then persuades Veii&#x27;s goddess, Juno Regina, to leave the city and move to Rome. Archaeological remains near Veii include blocked drainage tunnels from the fifth-century, which may indicate the possibility that this story in Livy arises a Romans breakthrough into the city through them.

Following the capture of the city, Livy reports that Camillus had its free population sold into slavery before the land was resettled with Roman citizens with land allotments of seven jugera. Archaeological evidence points to Romans switching quarries: after the capture of Veii&#x27;s better-quality quarries, Roman structures switch largely to using stone sourced therefrom, which may suggest enslaved Veientine quarry workers. Camillus then celebrates a triumph and dedicates a temple of Juno on the Aventine. It is likely that many of the details of his return in Livy were copied from the less historically distant triumphal entrances of Scipio Africanus or Sulla.

In 394 BC, he supposedly secured the surrender of the Falisci in their main town of Falerii Veteres (modern Civita Castellana) after refusing to accept pupils from a schoolmaster as hostages. Much of the Livian narrative about the exchange with the schoolmaster is meant to recount an which stresses the importance of Roman good will () and the importance of gentlemanly aristocratic behaviour.

After taking Veii and Falisci, Camillus is supposed to have been prosecuted. Accounts differ: he may have been accused by the quaestors of misappropriating spoils of war or of his extravagance in purchasing four white horses for his triumph. Whatever the charge, though a quaestorian trial for misappropriation is more likely, Camillus was reportedly convicted and sent into exile. Historians believe this story of disgrace before the courts is modelled on fates of Achilles and Scipio Africanus and is meant to draw comparison with Themistocles and Gnaeus Marcius Coriolanus. The underlying source for the story likely postdates the Sullan period and is an &quot;evident anachronism&quot;. The story of conviction, however, likely did not happen and was instead adduced to place Camillus away from Rome when the Gallic sack occurs, excusing him of any blame for Rome&#x27;s defeat.

=== Gallic sack ===

In 390 BC (Varronian), or more likely in 387 BC, a large group of Gauls crossed the Apennines into northern Etruria. They advanced until they reached Roman territory and there defeated Rome&#x27;s army at the Battle of the Allia. In the following days, they entered Rome and sacked it. They then induced the surrender of Roman holdouts on the Capitoline hill before receiving a large ransom of gold and withdrawing north. This account is corroborated by Greek sources as early as the 4th century BC; Polybius places the sack in the same year as the Peace of Antalcidas and the siege of Rhegium.

According to Livy, after the fall of the city, Camillus is recalled from exile at Ardea by the people and appointed again as dictator – even though a consular tribune was available to nominate a dictator in the normal fashion – in the city&#x27;s hour of need. Then, at the climax of the Gallic sack, when a thousand pounds of gold is being weighed out, Camillus and a hastily organised army returns and defeats the Gauls, saving the city and recovering the ransom. This story was probably a creation of Roman annalists during the first century BC; Ogilvie in his &quot;Commentary on Livy&quot;, calls it &quot;one of the most daring fabrications in Roman history&quot;. Other traditions have different narratives: for example, the Livii Drusi are supposed to have by single combat with a Gaul named Drausus recovered the same ransom; Plutarch records a fragment of Aristotle asserting that &quot;a certain Lucius&quot; (probably a Lucius Albinius who is recorded to have secreted away the Vestal Virgins and sacred objects to Caere) having saved the city.

Polybius reports that rather than being defeated by Camillus, the Gauls occupied the city for some seven months before the Romans bought them off and they departed of their own accord to deal with an invasion of their territory by the Veneti. While the literary sources assert Rome was sacked and had to be rebuilt, there is no archaeological evidence of major damage to pre-fourth century BC buildings in the forum, which indicates that the sack – if it occurred – consisted largely of stealing portable property.

After the sack, Camillus is supposed to have led the opposition to a proposal circulating among the plebs to relocate the city to Veii. This story also cannot be accepted and is more likely &quot;a reflection of the tensions that arose concerning the distribution of the conquered territory of Veii&quot; and to introduce &quot;anti-plebeian elements&quot; into the Camillan narrative. The speech does not appear in Polybius and may have been invented in order to oppose by historical precedent Gaius Gracchus&#x27; proposal to establish a colony at Carthage with further embellishment of its anti-Italian themes during the time of the Social War.

Regardless, the ancient tradition records that within a year after Rome was reduced to ruins, the city had been completely rebuilt and all rebellions by Roman allies suppressed due to the extraordinary leadership of Camillus, who is therefore regarded as the city&#x27;s &quot;second founder&quot;. In these victories, he is supposed to have dedicated three gold saucers to Juno for victory against the Volscians, Aequians, and Etruscans all the next year in 389 BC. None of these achievements are mentioned in Polybius or Diodorus.

=== Later career ===

Livy next reports Rome sending Camillus to take the city of Tusculum in 381 BC. The city, already surrounded by Roman territory, immediately surrenders and the inhabitants thereof are given Roman citizenship with some level of self-rule, becoming the first Roman &quot;municipium&quot;. Tusculum would be one of the first to revolt in the Second Latin War.

Both Camillus&#x27; role in Manlius&#x27; sedition and his later dictatorship (engaging the Gauls and plebeian reforms) may be anachronistic and fictitious insertions.

==== Manlius ====
The account of Dio, coming from a Byzantine summary by Zonaras, asserts Camillus was elected dictator in 384 BC to put down the sedition of Marcus Manlius Capitolinus, who is believed to be trying to make himself king. Camillus reportedly has Manlius arrested by a slave before a trial; Manlius is convicted and then thrown from the Tarpeian Rock. No such attribution is given in the accounts of Livy and Plutarch, who note Camillus merely as one of the six consular tribunes in that year.

==== Licinio-Sextian rogations ====
According to Livy, there are ten years in which Gaius Licinius Stolo and Lucius Sextius Lateranus were elected plebeian tribunes continuously. During the last five or six years, they blocked the election of all magistrates in an attempt to pass what would become the Licinio-Sextian rogations. Camillus is alleged to have been elected dictator in 368 BC and attempted to obstruct their attempts, without success. But the next year, he is appointed dictator again. He then reconciles the plebeians and the patricians with a proposal to appoint a patrician-only praetor and curule aediles (in exchange for plebeian eligibility to the consulship); all accept the passage of the rogations and domestic harmony is restored; Camillus then constructs a temple to Concordia. &quot;Very little of this narrative can be accepted as it stands&quot;. While Diodorus Siculus reports the length of the anarchy to have been merely one year, it is implausible that Rome could have been without magistrates for more than a few months. More damningly, a passage of Aulus Gellius&#x27; &quot;Attic Nights&quot; (5.4) preserves a fragment of Numerius Fabius Pictor that shows that alleged years where tribunes blocked all elections were a late annalistic invention, likely to line up Greek and Roman chronologies.

The three alleged rogations touched on a number of topics. The first rogation was a mechanism for debt relief. The second imposed a possession limit of 500 jugera of public land. The third was the reform that abolished the consular tribunate and required the election of consuls, one of which had to be a plebeian. Gary Forsythe, in &quot;Critical history of early Rome&quot;, accepts that the first law is consistent with voiced concerns over indebtedness from this period, that the second (limits on public land possession) is attested to in later speeches, and that the third is reflected in the consular fasti.

Livy includes in the same year of this compromise, 367 BC, another alleged victory by Camillus over the Gauls. Modern scholars are especially suspicious of this report, especially because Livy notes confusion in his own sources over this victory, which is alternatively attributed to Titus Manlius Torquatus.

==== Death ====
According the ancient Roman tradition, Camillus died during an epidemic that hit Rome in 365 BC. However, it is unlikely that any evidence of Camillus&#x27; death was known in later times: Münzer, writing in the &quot;Realencyclopädie&quot;, believes later annalists simply assumed Camillus died in the epidemic.

== Legacy ==

By the late republic, after centuries of embellishment from the fourth to the first century BC, the Romans believed that Camillus had captured Veii, saved the city from the Gallic sack, saved the city from foreign threats on all sides, opened the highest magistracies to the plebeians, ensured domestic harmony, and largely settled the struggle of the orders. Through it all, they believed he had held six consular tribunates and been dictator five times. For these reasons, he was hailed as the second founder of the city. A bronze statue of Camillus also bedecked itself on the rostra in the Forum.

His reputation by the late republic and early empire was such that Camillus was a source of : fables giving lessons for Romans on how to act in line both with morals and with Roman tradition and procedures. One of the most famous ones is during Camillus&#x27; capture of Faliscii: one of their schoolmasters defects, bringing with him to the camp his pupils who are Faliscan nobles&#x27; children. Camillus, displaying his exemplary , has the schoolmaster reprimanded and punished by the pupils; the Faliscans then surrender the city before Camillus&#x27; good faith. Camillus is similarly alleged to have resigned a dictatorship to which he was appointed merely because of faulty procedure; Livy mentions it – an event that &quot;almost certainly never took place&quot; – as an example of Roman legal scruples. In all, Camillus is mentioned in Livy&#x27;s &quot;Ab urbe condita&quot; as an example to be followed eight times, an &quot;unusually high frequency&quot;, usually in relation to his alleged successes as a general, moderation in the face of hot-headed colleagues, and triumphant recall from exile.

The memory of Camillus became part of the public image of the first Roman emperor Augustus. The history of Livy, for example, may have been written to coincide at the beginning of a consisting of 360–365 years. Starting with Romulus, the cycle reaches a peak under king Servius Tullius before a second founding under Camillus, completing the cycle. The next cycle has a second peak in the time of Scipio Africanus before Augustus enters as the figure to re-found Rome again and restart the great year, with Livy suggesting that Romulus, Camillus, and Augustus are coequal heroic figures.

<text>&quot;Under Pressure&quot; is a song by the British rock band Queen and singer David Bowie. Originally released as a single in October 1981, it was later included on Queen&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;Hot Space&quot;. The song reached number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Queen&#x27;s second number-one hit in their home country and Bowie&#x27;s third, and also charted in the top 10 in more than 10 countries around the world.

The song has been described as a &quot;monster rock track that stood out&quot; on the &quot;Hot Space&quot; album, as well as &quot;an incredibly powerful and poignant pop song&quot;. &quot;Under Pressure&quot; was listed at number 31 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Songs of the &#x27;80s, and voted the second-best collaboration of all time in a poll by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In 2021, it was ranked number 429 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It was played live at every Queen concert from 1981 until the end of the band&#x27;s touring career in 1986. Live recordings had appeared on various Queen live albums such as &quot;Queen Rock Montreal&quot; and &quot;Live at Wembley &#x27;86&quot;.

The song was included on some editions of Queen&#x27;s first &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilations, such as the original 1981 Elektra release in North America. It is included on the band&#x27;s compilation albums &quot;Greatest Hits II&quot;, &quot;Classic Queen&quot;, and &quot;Absolute Greatest&quot;, as well as Bowie compilations such as &quot;Best of Bowie&quot; (2002), &quot;The Platinum Collection&quot; (2005), &quot; The Best of David Bowie 1980/1987&quot; (2007), &quot;Nothing Has Changed&quot; (2014), &quot;Legacy&quot; (2016), and &quot;Re:Call 3&quot; (2017).

&quot;Under Pressure&quot; was sampled by American rapper Vanilla Ice for his 1990 single &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot;. Vanilla Ice initially did not credit Bowie or Queen for the sample, resulting in a lawsuit that gave Bowie and Queen songwriting credit. &quot;Under Pressure&quot; has been covered by American rock bands My Chemical Romance and the Used, and singer Shawn Mendes, whose version featured singer Teddy Geiger. Xiu Xiu also covered the song with Swans frontman Michael Gira, a version that was included on Xiu Xiu&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Women as Lovers&quot;.

==Background and composition==
&quot;Under Pressure&quot; was recorded at Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland, in July 1981. Queen, working on their 1982 album &quot;Hot Space&quot;, had been working on a song called &quot;Feel Like&quot;, but were not satisfied with the result. While they were there, David Bowie was also at Mountain recording his vocals for &quot;Cat People (Putting Out Fire)&quot;, the title song for the 1982 horror film of the same name. The artists ran into each other during the session. Bowie sang backing vocals for Queen&#x27;s song &quot;Cool Cat&quot;, but his vocals were removed from the final song because he was not satisfied with his performance. Afterwards, they worked together for a while and wrote &quot;Under Pressure&quot;. It was credited as being co-written by the five musicians. The scat singing that dominates much of the song is evidence of the jam-beginnings as improvisation. However, according to Queen bassist John Deacon (as quoted in a French magazine in 1984), the song&#x27;s primary musical songwriter was Freddie Mercury – though all contributed to the arrangement. As Brian May recalled to &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine in October 2008, &quot;It was hard, because you had four very precocious boys and David, who was precocious enough for all of us. David took over the song lyrically. Looking back, it&#x27;s a great song, but it should have been mixed differently. Freddie and David had a fierce battle over that. It&#x27;s a significant song because of David and its lyrical content.&quot; The earlier, embryonic version of the song without Bowie, &quot;Feel Like&quot;, is widely available in bootleg form, and was written by Queen drummer Roger Taylor.

Also, some confusion has arisen about who had created the song&#x27;s bassline. John Deacon said (in Japanese magazine &quot;Music life&quot; in 1982) that David Bowie created it. In more recent interviews, Brian May and Roger Taylor credited the bass riff to Deacon. Bowie, on his website, said the bassline was already written before he became involved. Roger Taylor, in an interview for the BBC documentary &quot;Queen: The Days of Our Lives&quot;, stated that Deacon did indeed create the bassline, and that all through the sessions in the studio, he had been playing the riff over and over. He also claims that when the band returned from dinner, Deacon misremembered the riff, but Taylor was still able to remember it. Brian May clarified matters in a 2016 article for Mirror Online, writing that it was actually Bowie, not Taylor, who had inadvertently changed the riff. The riff began as &quot;Deacy began playing, 6 notes the same, then one note a fourth down&quot;. After the dinner break, Bowie changed Deacon&#x27;s memory of the riff to &quot;Ding-Ding-Ding Diddle Ing-Ding&quot;.

== Reception ==
&quot;Under Pressure&quot; has received critical acclaim since its release, with multiple publications ranking it among Queen and Bowie&#x27;s best songs and among the greatest songs of all time. On release, Sandy Robertson of &quot;Sounds&quot; called &quot;Under Pressure&quot; the &quot;cornerstone&quot; of its parent album. &quot;Record World&quot; said that &quot;Bowie and Freddie Mercury combine for a spellbinding musical experience.&quot; Reviewing &quot;Hot Space&quot; decades later, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called &quot;Under Pressure&quot; as the album&#x27;s &quot;undeniable saving grace&quot; and &quot;the only reason most listeners remember this album&quot;. He described the song as &quot;an utterly majestic, otherworldly duet... that recaptures the effortless grace of Queen&#x27;s mid-&#x27;70s peak, but is underscored with a truly affecting melancholy heart that gives it a genuine human warmth unheard in much of their music.&quot; Similarly, Ned Raggett of AllMusic described the song as &quot;anthemic, showy, and warm-hearted, [and] a clear standout for both acts&quot;.

Following Bowie&#x27;s death in 2016, Jack Hamilton of &quot;Slate&quot; called &quot;Under Pressure&quot; a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and is a reminder to the public that Bowie could be &quot;wonderfully, powerfully human.&quot; Jack Whatley wrote for &quot;Far Out Magazine&quot; &quot;with all the animosity, wine, cocaine, and vocal battles, which helped come together to birth the song, what remains is an incredibly powerful and poignant pop song that we will likely not see matched in our lifetimes. The two juggernauts of Freddie Mercury and David Bowie collide here with perfect and enriching precision.&quot;

The September 2005 edition of online music magazine &quot;Stylus&quot; singled out the bassline as the best in popular music history. In November 2004, &quot;Stylus&quot; music critic Anthony Miccio commented that &quot;Under Pressure&quot; &quot;is the best song of all time&quot; and described it as Queen&#x27;s &quot;opus&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed &quot;Under Pressure&quot; as the 21st best single of the 1980s. It was listed at number 31 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Songs of the &#x27;80s and voted the second best collaboration of all time in a poll by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. It is ranked number 429 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

==Music video==
The music video for the song features neither Queen nor David Bowie due to touring commitments. Taking the theme of pressure, director David Mallet edited together stock footage of traffic jams, commuter trains packed with passengers, explosions, riots, cars being crushed, and various pieces of footage from silent films of the 1920s, most notably Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s influential Soviet film &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot;, &quot;My Lady of Whims&quot;, the silent &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; starring John Barrymore, and F.W. Murnau&#x27;s &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, a masterpiece of the German Expressionist movement. The video explores the pressure-cooker mentality of a culture willing to wage war against political machines, and at the same time love and have fun (there is also footage of crowds enjoying concerts, and many black and white kissing scenes). &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; refused to show the video in its original form due to it containing footage of explosions in Northern Ireland, so an edited version was instead shown. In 2003, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; ranked &quot;Under Pressure&quot; number 27 among the 100 greatest music videos of all time.

==&quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot; sampling controversy==

Controversy arose when Vanilla Ice sampled the song&#x27;s intro bassline and piano chords for his 1990 single &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot;. Initially, he denied the accusation and then said he had modified it but did not originally pay songwriting credit or royalties to Queen and Bowie. A lawsuit resulted in Bowie and all members of Queen receiving songwriting credit for the sample. Vanilla Ice later claimed that he purchased the publishing rights to &quot;Under Pressure&quot;, saying that buying the song made more financial sense than paying out royalties, but a Queen spokesman clarified that Vanilla Ice&#x27;s statement was inaccurate.

== Live performances ==
Although very much a joint project, only Queen incorporated the song into their live shows at the time. Bowie chose not to perform the song before an audience until the 1992 Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, when he and Annie Lennox sang it as a duet (backed by the surviving Queen members). However, after Mercury&#x27;s death and the &quot;Outside&quot; tour in 1995, Bowie performed the song at virtually every one of his live shows, with bassist Gail Ann Dorsey taking Mercury&#x27;s vocal part. The song also appeared in set lists from A Reality Tour mounted by Bowie in 2004, when he frequently would dedicate it to Freddie Mercury. Queen + Paul Rodgers have performed the song. In summer of 2012, Queen + Adam Lambert toured, including a performance of the song by Lambert and Roger Taylor in each show. While Bowie was never present for a live performance of the song with Mercury, Taylor instead filled for backing vocals in unison with Mercury, as Mercury took over all of Bowie&#x27;s parts.

== Live recordings ==
* Queen first recorded a live full version of the song at the Montreal Forum in Canada on 24 November 1981. This was included in the concert films &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;Queen Rock Montreal&quot;. Incidentally it is one of the few times in concert where Mercury used falsetto in the song on the line &quot;these are the days it never rains but it pours&quot;.
* A second live version of the song was recorded at Milton Keynes, England, in 1982. This was released in 2004 on the live album/DVD &quot;Queen on Fire - Live at the Bowl&quot;. Prior to the concert, rumours circulated that Bowie would appear with Queen to sing his parts on stage, but he probably did not even attend the concert.
* In September 1982 the band performed the song during an appearance on the eighth-season premiere of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, which turned out to be Freddie Mercury&#x27;s final live performance with Queen in the United States.
* Later, Queen recorded a third live version of the song at Wembley Stadium, London, in 1986. This was released on the live album/DVD &quot;Live at Wembley Stadium&quot;. Another rendition from this same tour (from Queen&#x27;s concert in Budapest) appeared in edited form on the album &quot;Live Magic&quot; in 1986. A recording taken from Queen&#x27;s last gig in Knebworth Park in 1986, appears, albeit in remixed form, as a B-side from second CD single of &quot;Rah Mix&quot; version of this song, released in 1999. &quot;(See below)&quot;
* During the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert in 1992, the surviving members of Queen along with Bowie and Annie Lennox (fulfilling Mercury&#x27;s role) performed the song. The concert was later released on DVD in 2002 for the 10th anniversary.
* A version recorded by David Bowie&#x27;s live band in 1995 was released on the bonus disc included with some versions of &quot;Outside – Version 2&quot;. This live version was also released on the single &quot;Hallo Spaceboy&quot; in 1996. Two live recordings from the Outside Tour appear on Bowie&#x27;s live concert albums &quot;Ouvre le Chien (Live Dallas 95)&quot; (2020) and &quot;No Trendy Réchauffé (Live Birmingham 95)&quot; (2020).
* Bowie&#x27;s 25 June 2000 performance of the song at the Glastonbury Festival was released in 2018 on &quot;Glastonbury 2000&quot;.
* Bowie&#x27;s DVD &quot;A Reality Tour&quot; (2004) and album &quot;A Reality Tour&quot; (2010) include a November 2003 live version from the A Reality Tour, recorded in Dublin, with Bowie&#x27;s bassist Gail Ann Dorsey singing Mercury&#x27;s parts.
* The 2006 VH1 Rock Honors at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas, featured Queen + Paul Rodgers performing &quot;Under Pressure&quot; along with &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; as a live broadcast.

===Other remixes===
Mouth Pressure. Released in January 2017 as a part of the Neil Cicierega album &quot;Mouth Moods&quot;, &quot;Mouth Pressure&quot; pairs the instrumentals from &quot;Under Pressure&quot; with the vocals from Smash Mouth&#x27;s &quot;All Star&quot;.

Percy&#x27;s Pressure. A karaoke version of the song was released in September as a part of the soundtrack of the animated Warner Brothers musical film &quot;Smallfoot&quot; whose lyrics detail one of the central human characters Percy&#x27;s (voiced by James Corden) fall from fame and his need to bounce back. Additional lyrics were written by Karey Kirkpatrick, the film&#x27;s director, and his brother Wayne Kirkpatrick.

==Use in other media==
A radically remixed version is used in Charlotte Wells&#x27; 2022 BAFTA winning film &quot;Aftersun&quot;. The track appears at the climactic ending of the film in a version which gradually strips away most of the instrumentation leaving Bowie and Mercury’s vocals to be accompanied by electronic drones and cello from composer Oliver Coates.

==Charts==
In the U.K., &quot;Under Pressure&quot; was Queen&#x27;s second number-one hit and Bowie&#x27;s third. Queen&#x27;s smash hit &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; reached number one in November 1975, just two weeks after Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Space Oddity&quot; had done the same. Bowie also topped the British charts in August 1980 with &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, his answer song to &quot;Space Oddity&quot;.

== My Chemical Romance and the Used version ==
The song was covered in 2005 by American alternative rock bands the Used and My Chemical Romance for tsunami relief. The cover was originally released as an Internet download track but has subsequently been featured as a bonus track on the 2005 re-release of the Used&#x27;s second studio album &quot;In Love and Death&quot;, and received wide airplay in 2005.

On the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, the single reached number 28 on Modern Rock chart and number 41 on the Hot 100.


== Shawn Mendes version ==
In October 2018, Canadian singer-songwriter Shawn Mendes featuring American singer-songwriter Teddy Geiger (credited as teddy&lt;3) released a version of the song.

The song was released to coincide with the release of the film &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. Universal Music Group released three tracks by different artists &quot;channeling their inner Freddie Mercury&quot;; this was the first installment, released in October 2018 followed by 5 Seconds of Summer&#x27;s &quot;Killer Queen&quot; cover track.

A portion of the profits from the &quot;Under Pressure&quot; cover was donated to Mercury Phoenix Trust, which was founded by Queen&#x27;s Brian May and Roger Taylor (and the group&#x27;s manager, Jim Beach) after Mercury&#x27;s death to help fight AIDS worldwide. Mendes said in a statement: &quot;I am so honoured to be able to support the amazing legacy of Freddie and Queen by doing a cover of one of my favourite songs, &#x27;Under Pressure&#x27;&quot;.

===Reception===
Taylor Weatherby from &quot;Billboard&quot; called the track &quot;breezy&quot; and said &quot;Mendes and Geiger put their voices at the forefront of the stripped-down rendition, with Mendes&#x27; falsetto and Geiger&#x27;s &#x27;raspier&#x27; tone complementing their plucky acoustic guitars.&quot;

<text>Falerii is a village in the municipality of Fabrica di Roma in the Province of Viterbo, Italy. Its name is better known for two nearby ancient cities, &quot;Falerii Veteres&quot; (old Falerii) and &quot;Falerii Novi&quot; (new Falerii).

&quot;Falerii Veteres&quot;, now Civita Castellana, was one of the chief cities of the &quot;duodecim populi&quot; of ancient Etruria. The site is about 2 km west of the course of the Via Flaminia, some 50 km north of Rome.

It was the main city of the Falisci, a people whose language was Faliscan and was part of the Latino-Faliscan language group. The Ager Faliscus (Faliscan Country), which included the towns of Capena, Nepet, and Sutrium, was close to the Monti Cimini.

== Location ==

The site of the original Falerii is a plateau, about 1100 × 400 m, not higher than the surrounding country (140 m) but separated from it by gorges over 60 m in depth, and only connected with it on the western side, which was strongly fortified with a mound and ditch. The rest of the city was defended by walls constructed of rectangular blocks of tuff of which some remains still exist.

== History ==
===Founding===

According to legend, Falerii Veteres was of Argive origin. Strabo&#x27;s assertion that the population, the Falisci, were of a different race from the Etruscans is supported by the evidence of the inscriptions which have been found here. They were written in a Latin dialect. Most of the surviving inscriptions date back to the second half of the fourth century BC and the first half of the third century BC. The Faliscan language survived &quot;the domination of the [surrounding] Etruscan culture, as well as, for a long time, the expansion of the Romans&quot;.

===Conflicts with Rome===
==== 5th century BC====

Falerii was relatively close to Rome, and the Faliscans viewed the Romans as a threat to their security. For this reason, they supported the Etruscan cities of Veii and Fidenae (which was near Veii, on the other bank of the river) in their conflicts with Rome in the fifth century. Livy noted that: &quot;As these two States [Falerii and the nearby Capena] were nearest in point of distance, they believed that if Veii fell they would be the next on whom Rome would make war&quot;. There had been a history of on-and-off conflicts between Rome and Veii, which often involved Fidenae. The Romans had placed a colony at Fidenae to garrison the city. In 437 BC Fidenae revolted, attacked the Roman settlers and sided with Veii. Roman envoys who were sent to Fidenae were killed on the order of the king of Veii. The Romans advanced on Fidenae. The Faliscans sent troops in support. The Veientes and Fidenates (the inhabitants of Veii and Fidenae) wanted to prolong the war, but the Faliscans wanted a pitched battle. The Romans routed the combined enemy forces. In 436 BC the Romans raided the territory of Veii and Falerii, but did not attack the two cities. In 435 BC the Fidenates crossed into Roman territory to raid it and called in the army of Veii. Falerii did not want to renew the war. In 434 the Romans seized Fidenae. This alarmed Veii and Falerii. They sent envoys to the Etruscan League (a council of the twelve major Etruscan cities) for assistance, but the league refused to help Veii.

In 403 BC war broke out between Rome and Veii. The Romans began a siege which lasted until 396 BC when they seized and destroyed this city. In 402 BC Falerii and Capena bound themselves by an oath and sent troops to Veii. They attacked the smaller the two Roman camps from the rear. The Veientes attacked the Roman siege works form the front. The lack of unity between the Roman commanders led to a rout of the Romans, and the capture of the smaller camp. Some Romans escaped to the larger camp and some withdrew to Rome. 

==== 4th century BC====

In 400 BC the Romans recaptured the lost camp, raided the territories of Falerii and Capena, but did not attack the two cities. In 399 BC Falerii and Capena sent troops to relieve Veii. The Romans made a sortie from their camp, put their forces to flight and pursued them killed many of their men. Soon after this a contingent was sent to raid the territory of Capena. It fell on the survivors of the battle and destroyed them. In 398 BC The Romans raided the territories of Falerii and Capena, &quot;carried off huge spoils and left nothing untouched that iron or fire could destroy&quot;. Livy mentioned Roman campaigns against Veii, of Falerii, and of Capena in 397 BC, but did not give any details. He wrote that the campaign at Veii was indecisive. In that year the Etruscan League held a council &quot;where the Capenates and Faliscans proposed that all the nations of Etruria should unite in a common resolution &#x27;and design to raise the siege of Veii.&quot; However, the request was refused because Veii had not consulted the other Etruscan cities &quot;for advice in so weighty a matter.&quot; Moreover, &quot;[t]here was now in the greatest part of Etruria a strange race, new settlers, with whom they were neither securely at peace nor yet certain to have war.&quot; This must have been a reference to the Gauls who had invaded northern Italy, close to Etruria. The council allowed Etruscan men to volunteer to serve in the war and many men did so. In 396 BC two Roman commanders marched against Falerii and Capena. However, they were poor commanders and fell into an ambush. One of them fell and the other withdrew. There was a rumour that Faliscans and Capenates were advancing and getting close to Veii &quot;with the whole military strength of Etruria.&quot; This caused panic in Rome. This led to a Roman push at Veii, which was captured and destroyed. In 395 BC the Romans conducted operations against Falerii and Capena. They did not attack the cities. They ravaged the countryside and &quot;despoiled the farmers of their possessions, leaving not one fruit-tree in the land nor any productive plant.&quot; Capena sued for peace, but the war with Falerii continued.

In 394 BC the war with Falerii was entrusted to Marcus Furius Camillus. He forced the Faliscans to come out of their town by ravaging the fields and burning the farmhouses. They encamped only one mile from the town, on a spot which they thought was safe because it was difficult to access. Guided by Faliscan prisoners, Camillus placed himself in a superior position near the camp. Enemy forces which tried to hinder the work were routed and the Faliscans fled back to their city. Camillus proceeded to besiege it. The town had plenty of food supplies and the siege seemed a prolonged affair. The inhabitants carried on with their usual lives and their boys went to school. The Faliscans had adopted the Greek practice of entrusting their boys to one tutor. This tutor decided to betray the town. He led the boys out of the town daily to exercise them. At first he kept them close to the city walls. Then he ventured further out. Eventually he reached the Roman outposts and handed the boys to the enemy. He communicated to Camillus his intention to betray Falerii. Camillus ordered that the man be stripped, scourged, and driven back into the city by the boys. When the Faliscans saw the tutor coming back in this fashion, they admired the righteousness of Camillus and sent envoys to him, &quot;entrusting him with their lives and fortunes&quot;. Camillus sent them to Rome and they told the senate that &quot;the Romans, by esteeming righteousness above victory, had taught them to love defeat above freedom and considered themselves &quot;vanquished in virtue&quot;. According to Livy they also promised fidelity to Roman rule. The senate entrusted the matter to Camillus who demanded the town to pay the wages of the Roman soldiers for that year. In Livy&#x27;s account, he granted peace; in Plutarch&#x27;s account, he &quot;established friendship with all the Faliscans&quot;. He then went back to Rome.

In 359 BC, war broke out between Rome and the Etruscan city-state of Tarquinii because the latter plundered Roman territory adjoining Etruria. In 357 BC, Faliscan men joined the Tarquinenses and refused to hand back Roman prisoners they had taken to Falerii. Livy wrote that the consul Gnaeus Manlius accomplished very little and mentioned that he was encamped at Sutrium, in Faliscan territory. In 356 BC, the Romans engaged the Faliscans and Tarquinenses. The priests of the latter rushed towards the Romans carrying snakes and torches. This dismayed the Roman soldiers, who fled to their rampart. They were mocked by their officers and they rushed against the enemy, routed them and seized their camp. All Etruscans then rose in arms led by Tarquinii and Falerii and advanced as far as the Roman salt works at the mouth of the River Tiber. The Romans crossed the river on rafts. They caught straggling pillagers in the fields and sized the enemy camp by surprise. The enemy was driven out of Roman territory. In 365 BC, another Etruscan city, Caere, joined Tarquinii. It was defeated and granted a 100-year truce. The Faliscans were accused of participating in the war and the brunt of the war was turned against them. The Romans could not find their forces and pillaged their land. In 351 BC the Romans conducted a campaign against Tarquinii and Falerii, ravaging their fields until their resistance was broken. The two city-states requested a truce and a forty-year truce was granted. In 342 BC, the Roman victory over the Samnites in the First Samnite War (344-342 BC) induced Falerii to ask Rome to convert their forty years&#x27; truce into a permanent treaty of peace.

==== 3rd century BC ====

In the first years of the Third Samnite War (298-290 BC), when Etruscan city-states rose against Rome, the Faliscans remained loyal to Rome. In 298 BC, after a fight with Volaterrae, a city-state in northern Etruria, the Romans went to the Faliscan territory, left their baggage in Falerii and proceeded to ravage enemy territory. In 297 BC, envoys for the Faliscan cities of Sutrium, Nepete, and Falerii went to Rome to inform the Romans that the city assemblies of Etruria were discussing suing for peace. In 295 BC, before the Battle of Sentinum, where the Romans faced a combined force of Samnites, Etruscans, Umbrians and Senone Gauls, the Romans stationed a reserve army in Faliscan territory. However, in 293 BC, the Faliscans made common cause with the Etruscans and Rome declared war on them. They seized the city of Troilum and then took five strong fortresses by storm. The Faliscans sued for peace and were granted a one-year truce after paying an indemnity of 100,000 asses of bronze coinage and year&#x27;s pay for the troops of the consul who campaigned in Etruria.

Falerii Veteres revolted against the Roman Republic in 241 BC. The Roman consul Titus Manlius Torquatus was sent and during the first battle the Romans heavy infantry was defeated, but the Faliscan cavalry lost. The Romans won a second battle and the Faiscans&#x27; arms, cavalry, goods, slaves and half of their territory were confiscated. Later the town was destroyed and a new one built on a more accessible site.

== The site ==

Remains of a temple were found at Lo Scasato, at the highest point of the ancient town, in 1888, and others have been excavated in the outskirts. The attribution of one of these to Juno Quiritis is uncertain. These buildings were of wood, with fine decorations of coloured terracotta. Numerous tombs hewn in the rock are visible on all sides of the town, and important discoveries have been made in them; many objects, both from the temples and from the tombs, are in the Museo di Villa Giulia at Rome. Similar finds have also been made at Calcata, ten km to the south, and Corchiano, around ten km north-west.

<text>The Dragon in the Sea (1956), also known as Under Pressure from its serialization, is a novel by Frank Herbert. It was first serialized in &quot;Astounding&quot; magazine from 1955 to 1956, then reworked and published as a standalone novel in 1956. A 1961 2nd printing of the Avon paperback, catalog # G-1092, was titled 21st Century Sub with the previous title in parentheses, and a short 36 page version of the novel was later collected in &quot;Eye&quot;. It is usually classified as a psychological novel.

== Plot ==
In a near-future earth, the West and the East have been at war for more than a decade, and resources are running thin. The West is stealing oil from the East with specialized nuclear submarines (&quot;subtugs&quot;) that sneak into the underwater oil fields of the East to secretly pump out the oil and bring it back. Each carrying a crew of four, these submarines undertake the most hazardous, stressful missions conceivable, and of late, the missions have been failing, with the last twenty submarines simply disappearing.

The East has been very successful in planting sleepers in the West&#x27;s military and command structures, and the suspicion is that sleepers are sabotaging the subs or revealing their positions once at sea. John Ramsey, a young psychologist from the Bureau of Psychology (BuPsych), is trained as an electronics operator and sent on the next mission, replacing the previous officer who went insane. His secret mission is to find the sleeper, or figure out why the crews are going insane.

== Major themes ==
Herbert&#x27;s portrayal of submarines towing large bags filled with surreptitiously pumped oil has been cited as an inspiration for the invention called the Dracone, for which development started in the year following Herbert&#x27;s serial.

== Reception ==
&quot;Galaxy&quot; reviewer Floyd C. Gale praised &quot;Dragon in the Sea&quot; as &quot;a dramatically fascinating story. . . . [a] tense and well-written novel.&quot; Algis Budrys described it as &quot;hypnotically fascinating,&quot; praising Herbert&#x27;s &quot;intelligence, sophistication, [and] capacity for research&quot; as well as his &quot;ability to write clean prose as an unobtrusive but effective vehicle for a cleanly told story.&quot; Anthony Boucher found the novel &quot;as impressive in its cumulative depiction of a specialized scientific background as anything since Hal Clement&#x27;s&quot; Mission of Gravity&quot;.&quot; Spider Robinson, reviewing a mid-1970s reissue, faulted the novel&#x27;s characterizations, saying &quot;there are no real people in it, only psychological types and syndromes walking around on legs.&quot;

J. Francis McComas praised the novel in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, comparing it to Forester and Wouk and declaring, &quot;In this fine blend of speculation and action, Mr. Herbert has created a novel that ranks with the best of modern science fiction.&quot;

== Awards ==
&quot;The Dragon in the Sea&quot; tied for number thirty-four in the 1975 Locus All-Time Poll.

<doc id="158298" wikidata="Q45788" url="?curid=158298" title="Himnusz">
<text>The &quot;&quot; () is the national anthem of Hungary. The lyrics were written by Ferenc Kölcsey, a nationally renowned poet, in 1823, and its currently official musical setting was composed by the romantic composer Ferenc Erkel in 1844, although other lesser known musical versions exist. The poem bore the subtitle (&#x27;From Stormy Centuries of the Hungarian Folk&#x27;); it is often argued that this subtitle – by emphasising past rather than contemporary national troubles – was added expressly to enable the poem to pass Habsburg censorship. The full meaning of the poem&#x27;s text is evident only to those well acquainted with Hungarian history. The first stanza is sung at official ceremonies and as well in common. It was &quot;de facto&quot; used as hymn of the Kingdom of Hungary from its composition in 1844, and was officially adopted as national anthem of the Third Hungarian Republic in 1989.

The lyrics of the &quot;Himnusz&quot; are a prayer beginning with the words &quot;God bless the Hungarians&quot; (, ).

==Name==
The title in the original manuscript is &quot;Hymnus&quot;, a Latin word for . The Hungarian word is itself derived from the Latin word , which is in turn borrowed
from Ancient Greek , meaning (generally in praise of gods or heroes); and in many languages of Europe, the word is used as a loanword to mean both and . The word replaced the original Latin word over time, and as the poem gained widespread acceptance as the &quot;de facto&quot; national anthem of Hungary, so too did the word took on the meaning of .

==History==
Although Ferenc Kölcsey completed the poem on 22 January 1823, it was only published first in 1829 in Károly Kisfaludy&#x27;s &quot;Aurora&quot;, without the subtitle, despite it being part of the manuscript. It subsequently appeared in a collection of Kölcsey&#x27;s works in 1832, this time with the subtitle. A competition for composers to make the poem suitable to be sung by the public was staged in 1844 and won by Ferenc Erkel&#x27;s entry. His version was first performed in the National Theatre (where he was conductor) in July 1844, then in front of a larger audience on 10 August 1844, at the inaugural voyage of the steamship Széchenyi. By the end of the 1850s it became customary to sing &quot;Himnusz&quot; at special occasions either alongside Vörösmarty&#x27;s &quot;Szózat&quot; or on its own.

In the early 1900s, various members of the Hungarian Parliament proposed making the status of Himnusz as the national anthem of Hungary within Austria-Hungary official, but their efforts never got enough traction for such a law to be passed. Later, in the 1950s, communist dictator Mátyás Rákosi made plans to have the anthem replaced by one more suited to the Communist ideology, but the persons he had in mind for the task, poet Gyula Illyés and composer Zoltán Kodály, both refused. It wasn&#x27;t until 1989 that Erkel&#x27;s musical adaptation of Himnusz finally gained official recognition as Hungary&#x27;s national anthem, by being mentioned as such in the Constitution of Hungary.

==Official uses==
The public radio station Kossuth Rádió plays Himnusz at ten minutes past midnight each day at the close of transmissions in the AM band, as do the state TV channels at the end of the day&#x27;s broadcasts. Himnusz is also traditionally played on Hungarian television at the stroke of midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve.

==Alternative anthems==
&quot;Szózat&quot;, another Hungarian patriotic song, enjoys a social status nearly equal to that of &quot;Himnusz&quot;, even though only &quot;Himnusz&quot; is mentioned in the Constitution of Hungary. &quot;Szózat&quot; is often considered to be a &quot;de facto&quot; second national anthem of Hungary. Traditionally, &quot;Himnusz&quot; is sung at the beginning of ceremonies, and Szózat at the end (although the Himnusz, resembling a Protestant Chorale, is substantially easier to sing than the difficult rhythm of the Szózat, which is often only played from recording).

Recognition is also given to the &quot;Rákóczi March&quot;, a short wordless piece (composer unknown, but sometimes attributed to János Bihari and Franz Liszt) which is often used on state military occasions; and the poem &quot;Nemzeti dal&quot; written by Sándor Petőfi.

Another popular song is the &quot;Székely Himnusz&quot;, an unofficial ethnic anthem of the Hungarian-speaking Székelys living in eastern Transylvania—the Székely Land (now part of Romania) and in the rest of the world.

==Lyrics==
The first verse is officially sung at ceremonies. The last two lines of every stanza is rarely repeated twice.

Two English versions are given below; both are free translations of the Hungarian words. As Hungarian is a genderless language, masculine pronouns in the English translations are in fact addressed to all Hungarians regardless of gender.

== Himnusz sculpture ==
On 7 May 2006, a sculpture was inaugurated for Himnusz at Szarvas Square, Budakeszi, a small town close to Budapest. It was created by Mária V. Majzik, an artist with the Hungarian Heritage Award, depicting the full text of the poem in a circle, centered around a two metres high bronze figure of God, with 21 bronze bells in seven arches between eight pieces of stone, each four and a half metres high. The musical form of the poem can be played on the bells. The cost of its construction, 40 million forints (roughly 200,000 USD), was collected through public subscription.

<doc id="158300" wikidata="Q693844" url="?curid=158300" title="Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod">
<text>The Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod (LCMS), also known as the Missouri Synod, is a confessional Lutheran denomination in the United States. With 1.7 million members as of 2022 it is the second-largest Lutheran body in the United States, behind the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The LCMS was organized in 1847 at a meeting in Chicago, as the German Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri, Ohio, and Other States (), a name which partially reflected the geographic locations of the founding congregations.

The LCMS has congregations in all 50 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces, but over half of its members are located in the Midwest. It is a member of the International Lutheran Council and is in altar and pulpit fellowship with most of that group&#x27;s members. The LCMS is headquartered in Kirkwood, Missouri, a suburb west of St. Louis and is divided into 35 districts—33 of which are geographic and two (the English and the SELC) non-geographic. The current president is Matthew C. Harrison, who took office on September 1, 2010.

==History==

===Origins===
The Missouri Synod emerged from several communities of German Lutheran immigrants during the 1830s and 1840s. Isolated Germans in dense forests of the American frontier in Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan were brought together and ministered to by missionary F. C. D. Wyneken. A communal emigration from Saxony under Bishop Martin Stephan created a community in Perry County, Missouri, and in St. Louis. In Michigan and Ohio, missionaries sent by Wilhelm Löhe ministered to scattered congregations and founded German Lutheran communities in Frankenmuth, Michigan, and the Saginaw Valley of Michigan.

====Saxon immigration====

In the 19th-century German Kingdom of Saxony, Lutheran pastor Martin Stephan and many of his followers found themselves increasingly at odds with Rationalism, Christian ecumenism, and the prospect of a forced unionism of the Lutheran church with the Reformed church. In the neighboring Kingdom of Prussia, the Prussian Union of 1817 put in place what they considered non-Lutheran communion and baptismal doctrine and practice. In order to freely practice their Christian faith in accordance with the Lutheran confessions outlined in the Book of Concord, Stephan and between 600 and 700 other Saxon Lutherans left for the United States in November 1838.

Their ships arrived between December 31, 1838, and January 20, 1839, in New Orleans with one ship lost at sea. Most of the remaining immigrants left almost immediately, with the first group arriving in St. Louis on January 19, 1839. The final group, led by Stephan, remained in New Orleans for ten days, possibly to wait for the passengers of the lost ship &quot;Amalia&quot;. The immigrants ultimately settled in Perry County, Missouri, and in and around St. Louis. Stephan was initially the bishop of the new settlement, but he soon became embroiled in charges of corruption and sexual misconduct with members of the congregation and was expelled from the settlement, leaving C. F. W. Walther as the leader of the colony.

During that period, there was considerable debate within the settlement over the proper status of the church in the New World: whether it was a new church or whether it remained within the Lutheran hierarchy in Germany. Walther&#x27;s view that they could consider themselves a new church prevailed.

====Löhe missionaries====

Beginning in 1841, the parish pastor in Neuendettelsau, Bavaria—Wilhelm Löhe—inspired by appeals for aid to the German immigrants in North America, began to solicit funds for missionary work among them. He also began training men to become pastors and teachers, sending his first two students—Adam Ernst and Georg Burger—to America on August 5, 1842. Löhe ultimately sent over 80 pastors and students of theology to America; these pastors founded and served congregations throughout Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana.

Löhe also led an early and largely abortive effort to send missionaries to convert the Native Americans. In 1844 and 1845, he solicited colonists to form a German Lutheran settlement in Michigan, with the thought that this settlement would also serve as the base for missionary activity among the Native Americans. The colonists left Germany on April 20, 1845, under the leadership of Pastor August Crämer, and arrived in Saginaw County, Michigan, in August of that year. They founded several villages—Frankenmuth, Frankenlust, Frankentrost, and Frankenhilf (now known as Richville)—and worked to convert the Native Americans. They had limited success, however, and the villages became nearly exclusively German settlements within a few years.

In addition to sending pastors, theological students, and colonists to America, Löhe played an instrumental role in the formation of Concordia Theological Seminary in Fort Wayne, Indiana, raising funds for the new institution and sending eleven theological students and a professor from Germany to help found it. The seminary&#x27;s first president, Wilhelm Sihler, had also been sent by Löhe to America several years before.

Due to Löhe&#x27;s great zeal and indefatigable labors, LCMS&#x27; first president, C. F. W. Walther, said of him, &quot;Next to God, it is Pastor Loehe to whom our Synod is indebted for its happy beginning and rapid growth in which it rejoices; it may well honor him as its spiritual father. It would fill the pages of an entire book to recount even briefly what for many years this man, with tireless zeal in the noblest unselfish spirit, has done for our Lutheran Church and our Synod in particular.&quot;

===Founding and early years===

In 1844 and 1845, these two groups (the Saxons and the Löhe men) as well as Wyneken and one of his assistants began discussing the possibility of forming a new, confessional Lutheran church body. As a result of the discussions, the Löhe missionaries and Wyneken and his assistant (F. W. Husmann) decided to leave their synods. Planning meetings were held in St. Louis in May 1846 and in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in July 1846. On April 26, 1847, twelve pastors representing fourteen German Lutheran congregations met in Chicago and officially founded the German Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri, Ohio and Other States. Walther became the fledgling denomination&#x27;s first president.

The synod was quickly noted for its conservatism and self-professed orthodoxy. The synod&#x27;s constitution required all members (both pastors and congregations) to pledge fealty to the entire Book of Concord, to reject unionism and syncretism of every kind, to use only doctrinally pure books in both church and school, and to provide for the Christian education of their children. Among other things, these requirements meant that altar and pulpit fellowship was usually restricted to those Lutheran congregations and synods who were in complete doctrinal agreement with the Missouri Synod.

The LCMS&#x27; conservatism soon drew it into conflict with other Lutheran synods, the majority of which were then experimenting with so-called &quot;American Lutheranism&quot;. In addition, the LCMS also quickly became embroiled in a dispute with the Buffalo Synod and its leader, Johannes Andreas August Grabau, over the proper understanding of the church and the ministry. Within a few years, this conflict led to a separation between the Missouri Synod and Löhe, as Löhe&#x27;s views were close to those of Grabau.

Despite these conflicts, the Missouri Synod experienced fairly rapid growth in its early years, leading to the subdivision of the synod into four district synods (Central, Eastern, Northern, and Western) in 1854. This growth was due largely to the synod&#x27;s efforts, under the leadership of its second president, F. C. D. Wyneken, to care for German immigrants, help them find a home among other Germans, build churches and parochial schools, and train pastors and teachers. The synod continued these outreach efforts throughout the 19th century, becoming the largest Lutheran church body in the United States by 1888. By the synod&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary in 1897, it had grown to 687,000 members.

===Synodical Conference===

Between 1856 and 1859, the Missouri Synod hosted a series of four free conferences in order to explore the possibility of entering into fellowship agreements with other conservative Lutheran synods. As a result of these conferences, the LCMS entered into fellowship with the Norwegian Synod in 1857. In 1872, these two synods joined the Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, and Illinois Synods, which were also conservative Lutheran bodies, to form the Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America.

In 1876, the constituent synods of the Synodical Conference considered a plan to reorganize into a single unified church body with a single seminary. Some preliminary moves were made in this direction (including the 1880 absorption of the Illinois Synod into the LCMS&#x27; Illinois District), but opposition from some synods postponed the complete implementation of this plan, and the Predestinarian Controversy of the 1880s scuttled the plan entirely. As a result of the controversy, several pastors and congregations withdrew from the Ohio Synod to form the Concordia Synod; this synod merged with the LCMS in 1886.

Efforts were made in the 1920s to establish fellowship with the Ohio, Iowa, and Buffalo synods. Representatives from the synods formulated the &quot;Chicago Theses&quot; as a for agreement, but the 1929 LCMS synodical convention did not accept them and instead created a committee that, in 1932, produced the &quot;Brief Statement of the Doctrinal Position of the Missouri Synod&quot;. After the Ohio, Iowa, and Buffalo synods merged in 1930 to form the first American Lutheran Church (ALC), representatives from the ALC and the LCMS came to agreement on the &quot;Brief Statement&quot; and the ALC&#x27;s &quot;Declaration&quot; in 1938, but again no further action was taken.

===English transition===

For the first thirty years of its existence, the Missouri Synod focused almost exclusively on meeting the spiritual needs of German-speaking Lutherans, leaving work among English-speaking Lutherans to other synods, particularly the Tennessee and Ohio synods. In 1872, members of the Tennessee Synod invited representatives from the Missouri, Holston, and Norwegian synods to discuss the promotion of English work among the more &quot;Americanized&quot; Lutherans, resulting in the organization of the &quot;English Evangelical Lutheran Conference of Missouri.&quot; This conference was reorganized in 1888 as an independent church body, the English Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri and Other States, which subsequently merged into the LCMS as its English District in 1911. In its first twenty years, the English Synod became responsible for two colleges, organized dozens of congregations and parochial schools, took over the publication of &quot;The&quot; &quot;Lutheran Witness&quot; (an English-language newspaper published by LCMS pastors in Cleveland, Ohio), and published several hymnals and other books.

English work became more widespread in the LCMS during the first two decades of the twentieth century, with older members of the synod continuing to speak primarily German and younger members increasingly switching to English. As one scholar has explained, &quot;The overwhelming evidence from internal documents of these [Missouri Synod] churches, and particularly their schools ... indicates that the German-American school was a bilingual one much (perhaps a whole generation or more) earlier than 1917, and that the majority of the pupils may have been English-dominant bilinguals from the early 1880s on.&quot; The anti-German sentiment during the wars hastened the &quot;Americanization&quot; of the church and caused many churches to add English services and in some cases, drop German services entirely. During the years of language transition, the synod&#x27;s membership continued to grow, until by 1947, the synod had grown to over 1.5 million members.
During this time, the LCMS expanded its missionary efforts through the creation of its own radio station—KFUO (AM) (1924)—and its own international radio program—&quot;The Lutheran Hour&quot; (1930). Several years later, the synod began broadcasting its own TV drama—&quot;This Is the Life&quot; (1952).

===Post-WWII===

In 1945, a group of 44 leaders and theologians in the synod issued a statement criticizing the synod&#x27;s approach toward other Lutheran bodies. The document, known as &#x27;A Statement of the Forty-four&quot;. was signed by Theodore Graebner and four other professors at Concordia Seminary and by H. B. Hemmeter, who had recently retired as president of Concordia Theological Seminary, among others. The statement provoked immediate response from others in the synod.

In 1947, its centennial year, the church body shortened its name from &quot;The Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri, Ohio, and other States&quot; to the present one, &quot;The Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod&quot;. The 1947 convention also directed the Committee on Doctrinal Unity to meet with the Fellowship Commission of the ALC to develop a set of doctrinal theses. The first meeting was on May 17, 1948, and, after additional meetings, the &quot;Common Confession&quot;, Part I, was approved by the two committees on December 5–6, 1949. Both the ALC and the LCMS accepted the document in 1950. The two committees continued meeting to develop Part II of the &quot;Common Confession&quot; covering additional topics. The ALC accepted Part II in 1954. The 1956 convention of the LCMS recognized the &quot;Common Confession&quot; as one document in two parts that is a statement &quot;in harmony with the Sacred Scriptures and the Lutheran Confessions&quot;; however, it also declared that the document should not be &quot;regarded or employed as a functioning basic document toward the establishment of altar and pulpit fellowship with other church bodies&quot;.

The renewed interest in the ALC led a number of parties to fear that the synod was losing its doctrinal basis. In 1951, a small group of pastors and congregations left the synod to form the Orthodox Lutheran Conference, but the main impetus for the move was not church fellowship, but the question of whether breaking an engagement (in the modern sense) is the same as the breaking of a betrothal (historically) and therefore a sin, as those leaving the synod contended. Concerns about the LCMS becoming more open to less conservative Lutheran bodies caused problems in the Synodical Conference. In 1955, the Evangelical Lutheran Synod (ELS) broke fellowship with the LCMS, and in 1957, the WELS publicly admonished the LCMS, and, in 1961, it finally broke fellowship with the LCMS. Both the ELS and the WELS withdrew from the Synodical Conference in 1963, leaving only the LCMS and the Synod of Evangelical Lutheran Churches (SELC), an historically Slovak-American church, as members. In 1971, the SELC merged with the LCMS, forming the SELC District. The National Evangelical Lutheran Church, an historically Finnish-American Lutheran church, had already merged with the LCMS on January 1, 1964.

When the 1959 synodical convention did not take any action against the liberal movement, a number of pastors and laymen met in a State of the Church Conference at Trinity Lutheran Church in New Haven, Missouri, in which that church&#x27;s pastor, Herman Otten, presented a book of documentation of the various controversies that had arisen in the LCMS since 1950 and before. Several additional conferences were held, with the one in Milwaukee on May 15–16, 1961, attracting over 400 people. Plans were made at that conference for actions they wanted the 1962 synodical convention to take. The failure of the convention to do so led a dozen or so congregations and pastors to form the Lutheran Churches of the Reformation on April 28–29, 1964, at Emmaus Lutheran Church in Chicago. However, many of those opposed to the direction of the LCMS decided to remain in the synod, hoping to influence its direction.

In 1967, the LCMS agreed with the second American Lutheran Church (the successor to the first ALC) and the Lutheran Church in America (LCA) to form the Lutheran Council in the United States of America (LCUSA), but only on the assurance that a program of theological discussion would be implemented. With the election of J. A. O. Preus II as its president over the incumbent, Oliver Harms, in 1969, the LCMS began a sharp turn towards a more conservative direction. A dispute over the use of the historical-critical method for Biblical interpretation led to the suspension of John Tietjen as president of Concordia Seminary. In response, many of the faculty and students left the seminary and formed Seminex (Concordia Seminary in Exile), which took up residence at the nearby Eden Theological Seminary in suburban St. Louis.

The same convention which elected Preus as president also established altar and pulpit fellowship with the ALC. This was seen by many as a gesture toward Harms, who had supported the declaration of fellowship. Eight years later, the 1977 convention declared a state of &quot;fellowship in protest&quot; as the ALC exhibited closer ties to the more liberal LCA. The 1981 convention terminated the fellowship agreement. A number of pastors and others did not think that Preus&#x27;s method of dealing with false doctrine would be successful. On November 1–2, 1971, members of the Conference for Authentic Lutheranism in California and the Free Association for Authentic Lutheranism in the Midwest met in Libertyville, Illinois, north of Chicago, to form a new church body, the Federation for Authentic Lutheranism (FAL). They expected 50 to 60 congregations to join, but in the end, only six did as the conservative wing continued to gain strength in the LCMS. FAL declared fellowship with the WELS in 1973, but did not survive very long thereafter.

In 1976, about 250 of the congregations supporting Seminex left the LCMS to form the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches (AELC). The LCMS restricted its participation with LCUSA shortly after the AELC schism and announced that it would not participate in any merger discussions. In 1988, the AELC, ALC, and LCA merged to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, and LCUSA was dissolved.

==Foreign missions==

In 1900, the LCMS began sending missionaries to Brazil to minister to German-speaking immigrants in that country, and in 1904 created the Brazil District for the administration of the resulting congregations. Work was begun in Argentina in 1905 as part of the Brazil District. A separate Argentina District was established in 1926/1927. Both districts became independent church bodies that retain close relationships with the LCMS: the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Brazil in 1980, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Argentina in 1988.

The LCMS supervised an extensive roster of congregations in Canada until 1988, when the Canadian component became a separate and autonomous organization, Lutheran Church-Canada. However, this was an administrative, not theological division, and the two groups still share close ties and are in full communion with one another. A small number of congregations in Ontario and Quebec that are in the non-geographical English and SELC districts remain within the LCMS.

==Beliefs==

===Doctrinal sources===
One of the signature teachings of the Lutheran Reformation is &quot;Sola scriptura&quot;—&quot;Scripture alone.&quot; The LCMS believes that the Bible is the only standard by which church teachings can be judged, and holds that Scripture is best explained and interpreted by the &quot;Book of Concord&quot;—a series of confessions of faith adopted by Lutherans in the 16th century. LCMS pastors and congregations agree to teach in harmony with the Book of Concord &quot;because&quot; they believe that it teaches and faithfully explains the Word of God, not based on its own authority alone. Since the LCMS is a confessional church body, its ordained and commissioned ministers of religion are sworn by their oaths of ordination or installation, or both, to interpret the Sacred Scriptures according to the &quot;Book of Concord&quot;. Its ordained and commissioned ministers of religion are asked to honor and uphold other official teachings of the synod, meaning &quot;to abide by, act, and teach in accordance with,&quot; but are not sworn to believe, confess and teach them as correct interpretations of the Sacred Scriptures. The Missouri Synod also teaches biblical inerrancy, the teaching that the Bible is inspired by God and is without error. For this reason, they reject much—if not all—of modern liberal scholarship. The &quot;Brief Statement of the Doctrinal Position of the Missouri Synod&quot;, written by Franz August Otto Pieper, was adopted by the synodical convention in 1932 as a summary of the major beliefs of the LCMS.

====Salvation====
The LCMS believes that justification comes from God &quot;by divine grace alone, through faith alone, on account of Christ alone.&quot; It teaches that Jesus is the focus of the entire Bible and that faith in him alone is the way to eternal salvation. The synod rejects any attempt to attribute salvation to anything other than Christ&#x27;s death and resurrection.

====Means of grace====
The synod teaches that the Word of God, both written and preached, and the Sacraments are means of grace through which the Holy Spirit gives the gift of God&#x27;s grace, creates faith in the hearts of individuals, forgives sins for the sake of Christ&#x27;s death on the cross, and grants eternal life and salvation. Many Missouri Synod Lutherans define a sacrament as an action instituted by Jesus that combines a promise in God&#x27;s Word with a physical element, although the synod holds no official definition for sacrament. This means that some may disagree on the number of sacraments. All agree that Baptism and Communion are sacraments. Confession and absolution is called a sacrament in the Apology of the Augsburg Confession and so is also considered by many Lutherans to be a sacrament, because it was instituted by Christ and has His promise of grace, even though it is not tied to a physical element.

Unlike Calvinists, Lutherans agree that the means of grace are resistible; this belief is based on numerous biblical references as discussed in the &quot;Book of Concord&quot;.

====Sacramental Union and the Eucharist====
Regarding the Eucharist, the LCMS rejects both the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation and the Reformed teaching that the true body and blood of Christ are not consumed with the consecrated bread and wine in the Eucharist. Rather, it believes in the doctrine of the sacramental union, Real Presence, that the Body and Blood of Christ are truly present &quot;in, with, and under&quot; the elements of bread and wine. Or, as the Smalcald Articles express this mystery: &quot;Of the Sacrament of the Altar, we hold that the bread and wine in the Supper are Christ&#x27;s true body and blood.&quot; This is commonly known as the doctrine of consubstantiation, though the term is generally rejected by Lutherans and is explicitly rejected by the LCMS as an attempt to define the holy mystery of Christ&#x27;s presence.

====Eschatology====
The Missouri Synod flatly rejects millennialism and considers itself amillennialist. This means that it believes there will be no literal 1000-year visible earthly kingdom of Jesus, a view termed as &quot;realized millennialism&quot; in which the &quot;thousand years&quot; of Rev 20:1–10 is taken figuratively as a reference to the time of Christ&#x27;s reign as king from the day of his ascension. Hence, the millennium is a present reality (Christ&#x27;s heavenly reign), not a future hope for a rule of Christ on earth after his return (the parousia) (cf. Mt 13:41–42; Mt 28:18; Eph 2:6; Col 3:1–3).

====Law and Gospel====
The LCMS believes that the Holy Scriptures contain two crucial teachings—Law and Gospel. The Law is all those demands in the Bible which must be obeyed in order to gain salvation. However, because all people are sinners, it is impossible for people to completely obey the Law. Therefore, the Law implies an inevitable consequence of God&#x27;s wrath, judgment, and damnation. The Gospel, on the other hand, is the promise of free salvation from God to sinners. The Law condemns; the Gospel saves. Both the Law and the Gospel are gifts from God; both are necessary. The function of the law is to show people their sinful nature and drive them to 

The LCMS holds that the Old Testament and the New Testament both contain both Law and Gospel. The Old Testament, therefore, is valuable to Christians. Its teachings point forward in time to the Cross of Christ in the same way that the New Testament points backward in time to the Cross. That Lutheran doctrine is summarized by C. F. W. Walther in &quot;The Proper Distinction Between Law and Gospel&quot;.

===Other doctrine===

====Antichrists====
The LCMS holds that all &quot;false teachers who teach contrary to Christ&#x27;s Word are opponents of Christ&quot; and, insofar as they do so, are anti-Christ. The LCMS does not teach, nor has it ever taught, that any individual pope as a person is to be identified with the Antichrist. However, to the extent that the papacy continues to claim as official dogma the canons and decrees of the Council of Trent, the LCMS position is that the office of the papacy is the Antichrist.

====Creationism====
The LCMS officially supports literal creationism but does not have an official position on the precise age of the Earth. An official publication of the synod, the &quot;Brief Statement&quot; of 1932, states under the heading &quot;Of Creation&quot;: &quot;We teach that God has created heaven and earth, and that in the manner and in the space of time recorded in the Holy Scriptures, especially Gen. 1 and 2, namely, by His almighty creative word, and in six days.&quot; According to the recent 2004 LCMS synodical resolution 2-08A &quot;To commend preaching and teaching Creation&quot;, all LCMS churches and educational institutions—including preschool through 12th grade, universities, and seminaries—are &quot;to teach creation from the Biblical perspective.&quot; The LCMS web site says that an individual&#x27;s personal views regarding creation do not disqualify a person from being a member of the LCMS.

====Freemasonry====
The LCMS believes that the teachings of Freemasonry are in direct conflict with the Gospel and instructs its pastors and laypeople to avoid membership or participation in it.

===Baptism and other doctrine===
The LCMS practices infant baptism, based on Acts 2:38–39 and other passages of Scripture. It subscribes to the statement of faith found in the Apostles&#x27; Creed, the Ten Commandments, and the Lord&#x27;s Prayer being applicable to daily life. The doctrines are emphasized in &quot;Luther&#x27;s Small Catechism&quot;.

==Practices==

===Worship and music===
The original constitution of the LCMS stated that one of its purposes is to strive toward uniformity in practice, while more recent changes to those documents also encourage responsible and doctrinally sound diversity. The synod requires that hymns, songs, liturgies, and practices be in harmony with the Bible and &quot;Book of Concord&quot;. Worship in LCMS congregations is generally thought of as orthodox and liturgical, utilizing a printed order of service and hymnal, and is typically accompanied by a pipe organ or piano. The contents of LCMS hymnals from the past, such as &quot;The Lutheran Hymnal&quot; and &quot;Lutheran Worship&quot;, and those of its newest hymnal, &quot;Lutheran Service Book&quot;, highlight the synod&#x27;s unwavering stance towards more traditional styles of hymnody and liturgy. More traditional LCMS Lutherans point to the Lutheran Confessions in their defense of liturgical worship.

Towards the later parts of the twentieth century and up until present day, some congregations have adopted a more progressive style of worship, employing different styles such as contemporary Christian music with guitars and praise bands and often project song lyrics onto screens instead of using hymnals. While this shift in style challenges the traditionalism of hymnody that the LCMS holds strongly, the LCMS has released a statement on worship stating that, &quot;The best of musical traditions, both ancient and modern, are embraced by the Lutheran church in its worship, with an emphasis on congregational singing, reinforced by the choir.&quot;

===Reception of communion===
The LCMS endorses the doctrine of close or closed communion—the policy of sharing the Eucharist ordinarily only with those who are baptized and confirmed members of one of the congregations of the LCMS or of a congregation of one of its sister churches with which it has formally declared altar and pulpit fellowship (i.e., agreement in all articles of doctrine). Missouri Synod congregations implement closed communion in various ways, requiring conformity to official doctrine in various degrees. Usually, visitors are asked to speak with the pastor before coming to that congregation&#x27;s altar for the first time. Most congregations invite those uneducated on the subject of the Eucharist to join in the fellowship and receive a blessing instead of the body and blood of Christ.

===Ordination===
Ordination is seen as a public ceremony of recognition that a man has received and accepted a divine call, and hence is considered to be in the office of the Holy Ministry. The Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope agrees that &quot;ordination was nothing else than such a ratification&quot; of local elections by the people. The LCMS does not believe that the rite of ordination, though an accepted and praiseworthy ceremony, is divinely mandated or an extension of an episcopal form of apostolic succession but sees the office grounded in the Word and Sacrament ministry of the Gospel, arguing that Scripture makes no distinction between a presbyter (priest) and a bishop (see Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope, paragraphs 63,64, citing St. Jerome). The Augsburg Confession (Article XIV) holds that no one is to preach, teach, or administer the sacraments without a regular call.

LCMS pastors are generally required to have a four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree (in any discipline), as well as a four-year Master of Divinity degree, which is usually obtained from one of these institutions: Concordia Seminary in St. Louis or the Concordia Theological Seminary in Fort Wayne, Indiana or at the two seminaries run by the Lutheran Church–Canada. Candidates may earn their Master of Divinity degree at other seminaries but may then be required to take colloquy classes at either St. Louis or Ft. Wayne. Seminary training includes classwork in historical theology, Biblical languages (Biblical Greek and Hebrew), practical application (education, preaching, and mission), and doctrine (the basic teachings and beliefs of the synod).

===Role of women in the church===
The Missouri Synod teaches that the ordination of women as clergy is contrary to scripture. The issue of women&#x27;s roles in the church body has continued to be a subject of debate within the synod. During the Cooperative Clergy Study Project in 2000, 10% out of 652 LCMS pastors surveyed stated that all clergy positions should be open to women, while 82% disagreed. Congregations were permitted to enact female suffrage within Missouri Synod congregations in 1969, and it was affirmed at the synod&#x27;s 2004 convention that women may also &quot;serve in humanly established offices&quot; as long as those offices do not include any of the &quot;distinctive functions of the pastoral office&quot;. Thus in some congregations of the LCMS, women now serve as congregation president or chairperson, etc. This is the cause of contention within the LCMS, with some congregations utilizing women in public worship to read lessons and assist in the distribution of holy communion. Other traditional Lutherans reject such practices as unbiblical, with a minority of congregations continuing the historic practice of male suffrage, similar to the Wisconsin Synod.

===Interfaith services===
The LCMS bars its clergy from worshiping with other faiths, holding &quot;that church fellowship or merger between church bodies in doctrinal disagreement with one another is not in keeping with what the Bible teaches about church fellowship.&quot; In practice of this, a Connecticut LCMS pastor was asked to apologize by the president of the denomination, and did so, for participating in an interfaith prayer vigil for the 26 children and adults killed at a Newtown elementary school, and an LCMS pastor in New York was suspended for praying at an interfaith vigil in 2001, 12 days after the September 11 attacks.

===LCMS National Youth Gathering===
The National Youth Gathering is held every three years. The most recent gathering took place from July 9–13, 2022, in Houston with a theme of &quot;In All Things.&quot; The 2019 gathering was held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with a theme of &quot;Real. Present. God.&quot; The theme for the 2016 gathering in New Orleans was &quot;In Christ Alone.&quot; The previous gathering took place in 2013 in San Antonio, Texas from July 1–5, 2013. It was based on the theme, &quot;Live Love(d).&quot; The 2010 gathering in New Orleans was based on the theme &quot;We Believe&quot;. In both 2007 and 2004, The LCMS National Youth Gatherings were held at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, Florida. The gathering&#x27;s theme in 2007 was &quot;Chosen.&quot; The gathering in 2007 was originally planned to be held in New Orleans, but due to Hurricane Katrina the location was changed to Orlando. About 25,000 youth attend each gathering. Many Christian bands and artists perform at the gatherings.

==Church structure==

The LCMS has a synodical polity, which can be described as modified congregational polity with episcopal polity elements. It is organized into 35 districts, each of which has a president who oversees the parishes in his district, akin to the role of bishop used in other church traditions. However, resolutions passed by the synod and the respective districts are not binding on a congregation if they are not according to Scripture or are inexpedient for a congregation. That is somewhat different from some other Lutheran bodies which have maintained complete episcopal polity; however, this is not a point of doctrine, as the LCMS is in fellowship with some Lutheran church bodies in Europe and elsewhere that have an episcopal structure.

The LCMS is formally composed of two types of members: self-governing local congregations that qualify for membership by mutual agreement to adhere to stated principles, and clergymen who qualify by similar means. Congregations hold legal title to their church buildings and other property, and call (hire) and dismiss their own clergy. It allows the congregations to work together on projects too large for even a local consortium of congregations to accomplish, such as foreign mission work.

===Synod===
The LCMS as a whole is led by an ordained synodical president, currently Matthew C. Harrison. The president is chosen at a synodical convention, a gathering of the two membership groups (clergymen and lay representatives from the member congregations). The convention is held every three years; discussions of doctrine and policy take place at these events, and elections are held to fill various synod positions. The latest LCMS convention took place in 2023 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Local conventions within each circuit and district are held in the intervening years.

===Districts===

The entire synod is divided into 35 districts. Of these, 33 have jurisdiction over specific geographic areas. The other two, the English and the SELC, are non-geographic and were formed when the English Missouri Synod and the Slovak Synod, respectively, merged with the formerly German-speaking Missouri Synod. Each district is led by an elected district president, who must be an ordained clergyman. Most district presidencies are full-time positions, but there are a few exceptions in which the district president also serves as a parish pastor. The districts are subdivided into circuits, each of which is led by a circuit visitor, who is an ordained pastor from one of the member congregations. Districts are analogous to dioceses in other Christian communities.

===Congregations===
Most congregations are served by full-time clergy. Some congregations, usually in rural areas, are served by ordained bi-vocational ministers (worker-priests) who maintain secular employment for sustenance and receive a small stipend or none at all.

==Organizations==
===Educational institutions===
In addition to its two seminaries, the LCMS operates seven universities, known as the Concordia University System.

===Auxiliary organizations===
Among the LCMS&#x27;s other auxiliary organizations are the Lutheran Laymen&#x27;s League (now known as Lutheran Hour Ministries), which conducts outreach ministries including &quot;The Lutheran Hour&quot; radio program; and the Lutheran Women&#x27;s Missionary League. The synod also operates Concordia Publishing House, through which it publishes its official magazine, &quot;The Lutheran Witness,&quot; and newspaper, &quot;Reporter&quot;.

The LCMS also operates the LCMS Foundation for trust and benefit purposes and the Lutheran Church Extension Fund to provide loans to LCMS congregations, organizations, and workers.

==Relationship with other Evangelical Lutheran bodies==
Maintaining its position as a confessional church body emphasizing the importance of full agreement in the teachings of the Bible, the LCMS is not associated with the majority of ecumenical religious organizations such as the National Council of Churches of Christ in the U.S.A. / National Council of Churches (NCCC-USA) the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE), the World Council of Churches (wCC) or the Lutheran World Federation (LWF). It is, however, a member of the International Lutheran Council (ILC), made up of over 50 Evangelical Lutheran churches worldwide that support the conservative / confessional doctrines of the Bible and the Unaltered Augsburg Confession of 1530, among other generally accepted theological documents, most included in the subsequent seminal Book of Concord of 1580, accepted by worldwide Evangelical Lutheranism. 

At the 2007 LC-MS convention, the delegates voted to establish altar and pulpit fellowship with the recently established American Association of Lutheran Churches (AALC).

Although its strongly conservative views on theology and ethics might seem to make the LCMS politically compatible with other Protestant evangelicals and fundamentalists in the United States and around the world, the LCMS largely eschews political activity, partly out of concerns to keep the denomination untainted with potential heresies and also because of its strict understanding of the Lutheran distinction between the Two Kingdoms. However, many LCMS and evangelicals share the common belief that life begins and should be protected by law since conception.

The LCMS is distinguished from the also conservative Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) (the third largest Evangelical Lutheran denomination in the U.S.) by three main theological beliefs:
#The biblical understanding of fellowship: the LCMS believes in a distinction between the altar, pulpit fellowship, and other manifestations of Christian fellowship (in other words, a prayer fellowship). The WELS does not.
#The doctrine of the ministry: the LCMS believes that the Pastoral office is divinely established, but all other offices are human institutions and hence are not divinely established. The WELS believes that the Ministry of the Word is divinely established and that congregations and the synod may choose the forms of public ministry they wish to use.
#The role of women in the church: Although both the LCMS and WELS agree that Scripture reserves the pastoral office and ordination for men, the WELS also believes that Scripture forbids women&#x27;s suffrage in the congregation and councils.

Respondents to the recent Pew Research Center&#x27;s U.S. Religious Landscape Survey of 2008 included members of the LCMS and the larger Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA)
==Membership and demographics==
Membership growth was substantial in the first half of the 20th century. According to the &quot;Yearbook of American &amp; Canadian Churches&quot;, the LCMS had 628,695 members in 1925. By 1950 the number of members had grown to over 1.6 million. Membership peaked in 1970 at just under 2.8 million. In 2020,the LCMS reported 1,861,129 members and 5,976 churches, with 5,938 active clergy. LCMS membership continues to be concentrated in the Upper Midwest. The five states with the highest rates of adherence are Nebraska, Wisconsin, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Iowa.
The Pew Research Center&#x27;s U.S. Religious Landscape Survey in 2014 found that the LCMS was the third-least racially diverse major religious group in the country. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America was second and the National Baptist Convention was the least diverse. The 2008 figures were:

<doc id="158302" wikidata="Q253482" url="?curid=158302" title="Falisci">
<text>The Falisci were an Italic tribe who lived in what is now northern Lazio, on the Etruscan side of the Tiber River. They spoke an Italic language, Faliscan, closely related to Latin. Originally a sovereign state, politically and socially they supported the Etruscans, joining the Etruscan League. This conviction and affiliation led to their ultimate near destruction and total subjugation by Rome.

Only one instance of their own endonym has been found to date: an inscription from Falerii Novi from the late 2nd century AD refers to the &#x27;, &quot;the Faliscans who are in [[Sardinia]]&quot;, where&#x27; is the nominative plural case. An Etruscan inscription calls them the &quot;&quot;. The Latin cannot be far different from the original name. The -sc- suffix is &quot;distinctive of the Italic ethnonyms&quot;.

==Geography==
The Falisci resided in a region called by the Romans the &quot;&quot;, &quot;Faliscan Country&quot;, located on the right bank of the Tiber River between and including Grotta Porciosa in the north and Capena in the south. The 1st-century Roman writer Pliny the Elder and the 1st-century BCE Latin poet Horace both state that the Monte Soratte was within Faliscan territory; it likely functioned as the border between Faliscan country and Capenate territory. The land between Monte Soratte and the Tiber is of unclear ownership; although nearly all the 4th-3rd century BCE inscriptions from the area east of Monte Soratte are Faliscan, most scholars consider the land to have been part of the &quot;ager Capenas&quot;. To the west, the corners of the roughly square area were on the slopes of the Monti Sabatini in the south and the Monti Cimini in the north. Pollen samples from Lake Bracciano, Lake Monterosi and Lake Vico reveal that the montane forests, formed by oaks, were very dense until the 2nd century BC. According to the 1st-century BCE Roman historian Livy, the forest by Monti Cimini was dangerous for foreigners as of the 4th-century BCE; he claims that &quot;not a single trader had, up to that time, ventured through it.&quot;

The arable land was contained within an enclosure of volcanic highlands and the Tiber River. The northern border of the enclosure went along the ridge of the Monti Cimini, the southern along the ridge connecting the Monti Sabatini and Monte Soratte, the western along the highlands connecting the two large volcanic lakes. The inner slopes are drained by streams pointing at the Tiber, which collect into converging canyons and finally into the canyon of the Treja river, which empties into the Tiber. These streams required an extensive network of bridges.

Most of the through traffic went along the Via Tiburtina on the west bank of the river, which could only be crossed south of Capena or at Grotta Porciosa in the north. There the Via Flaminia, earlier the Via Amerina, led inland into the country of the Sabines via the valley of the Nar River. On the western side, the Via Cassia or its predecessor led to the coast over Sutri gap. The Falisci therefore prospered by being on a protected crossroad.

The primary urban center in Faliscan territory was the city of Falerii, now the modern settlement of Civita Castellana. Falerii was situated at the conjunction of several small rivers from Monti Sabatini and the larger Treia river. Following the Roman conquest of 241 BCE, the city of Falerii was destroyed and the inhabitants were moved to the less defensible position of Falerii Novi. Another major city mentioned in ancient literature is Fescennium, which is said by Festus to be the origin site of the Roman wedding tradition known as the Fescennine verses. Other Faliscan cities unmentioned by the ancient sources include Corchiano, Vignanello, Gallese and Grotta Porciosa.

==History==
The Falisci, often allied with the Etruscans, resisted Rome for a long time. They were allied with Veii when it was defeated in 396 BC. In the aftermath, Falerii was occupied by the victorious Romans. When, in 358, Tarquinia rebelled, the Falisci again took arms against Rome, but were again crushed c. 351 BC. This time an alliance was signed between the contenders, and a Roman garrison was settled in Falerii.

The Falisci took advantage of the First Punic War to declare their independence, but their revolt ended in 241 BC with the death of 15,000 Falisci and the destruction of Falerii; the survivors were moved to a new city, &quot;Falerii Novi&quot;.

==Culture==

It is unclear precisely how the Faliscans saw themselves and what characteristics they believed separated them from neighboring cultures. The only instance of the Falisci referring to their own ethnicity comes from a 2nd-century Latin inscription from Falerii Novi describing Faliscans in Sardinia: &quot;&quot;falesce·quei·in·Sardinia·sunt&quot;.&quot; Ancient Roman authors sometimes equate the Falisci and the Etruscans; the 4th-century Latin writer Servius the Grammarian calls the city of Falerii a Tuscan city and Livy calls the Falisci an Etruscan people. The 1st-century BCE historian Dionysus of Halicarnassus claimed that Faliscan culture developed from earlier, supposedly Pelasgian, inhabitants of the region. However, the 1st-century BCE geographer Strabo notes that the Falisci differed from the Etruscans in numerous ways: &quot;Some say that the inhabitants of Falerii are not Etruscans, but Faliscans, a distinct people; and some, too, that the Faliscans are a &quot;polis&quot; with a distinct tongue.&quot;

Dionysius describes Faliscan weaponry in his works, stating that their spears and bucklers resembled Greek equipment used in Argos. Dionysius likely intended this description to further support his proposed connection between Argos and the Falisci. He further claims that whenever the Faliscan army left their borders, they sent unarmed holy men ahead of the rest of the army carrying the terms of peace. Cato the Elder, a 3rd-century BCE Roman politician, mentions a type of cattle-stall called the &quot;praesepe Faliscum&quot;, although such a device was possibly not exclusive to the &quot;ager Faliscus&quot;.

=== Pottery ===
The Faliscans earned large quantities of black and red-figure pottery from trade with the Attic parts of Greece and immigration of Attic artisans. By the 4th-century BCE, the red-figure style became the predominant type of pottery in the &quot;ager Faliscus&quot;. During this same century, the city of Falerii experienced significant artistic development; 4th-century BCE pottery from Falerii demonstrates standardized design and highly technical craftsmanship. Vincent Jolviet studied Faliscan tombs and divided Faliscan red-figure pottery into two categories: the &quot;Style ancien,&quot; which comprises pottery produced around 380 BCE, and the &quot;Style récent,&quot; consisting of pottery made from 340-280 BCE. The ancient Faliscan style contained distinctly Faliscan characteristics such as the decorations under the handles, although it remained strongly influenced by its Attic origins. In contrast, the recent style shows greater evidence of technical differences from Attic pottery: decorations in the recent style were painted without relief-lines, using thin, rushed, and watery paint lines instead. Late Faliscan pottery contained volutes, tongue-decorations on the shoulders, and palmettes beneath the handles. Dionysian imagery, such as depictions of satyrs and maenads alongside birds, also became staples of late Faliscan pottery. Winged figures were used to fill up blank spaces easily, expediting the production process.

=== Social structure ===
The exact political mechanisms underpinning Faliscan society remain unclear due to limited archaeological evidence. Middle Faliscan inscriptions mention the political position of &quot;efiles&quot;, a term that may have emerged as a calque on the Latin word &quot;aedilis.&quot; Late Faliscan inscriptions from Falerii Novi (dated to after the Roman conquest) mention a &quot;cuestod&quot; (quaestor), a censor, several &quot;duouiri&quot; (Duumviri), and a &quot;pretod&quot; (praetor) that served a—possibly local—senate. The term &quot;rex&quot;, meaning &quot;king,&quot; appears on the &quot;cursus honorum&quot; in a Middle Faliscan text. It is possible that this position performed religious duties, similar to the Roman &quot;Rex sacrorum&quot;. The title appears at the end of the &quot;cursus&quot;, indicating that these magistrates may have served for a limited duration of time or served periodically. Another possible explanation for this placement is that the office was not a part of the traditional Roman &quot;cursus honorum&quot;.

The usage of patronymic instead of matronymic filiations indicates that Faliscan society may have been somewhat patriarchal. There are several examples of Faliscan praenomina which are seemingly unique to Faliscan culture or are rare outside of the &quot;ager Faliscus&quot;; the names &quot;Iuna&quot; and &quot;Volta&quot; are included within this category, they are especially unique as they are masculine names with the ending -&quot;a&quot;. Other names such as &quot;Gaius&quot; and &quot;Gaia&quot; are much more common in Faliscan inscriptions than in other cultures. Instances of double gentillicum are found in a Middle Faliscan inscription containing the name &quot;uel[ · ]uisni · olna&quot; and in a Middle or Late Faliscan text containing the name &quot;m · tito · tulio · uoltilio · hescuna.&quot; In Etruscan culture, this naming convention was used to mark an individual as a freedman. One Middle Faliscan inscription from Falerii mentions a freedwoman named &quot;loụṛia&quot; who was inhumed in the same &quot;loculus&quot; as the freeborn &quot;fasies : c[ai]sia&quot;.

=== Literature ===

Faliscan impasto pottery from the 7th-century BCE sometimes bear the signatures of their creators, a mark that possibly signified that the works were commissioned by individuals of high social-standing. Inscriptions such as those found on pottery, alongside the numerous other examples of Faliscan writing, suggest that some segments of the population were literate. Although, levels of literacy amongst the Faliscan people likely varied significantly between different social classes. The 1st-century BCE Roman historian Livy provides information on Faliscan schooling practices; he states that, like the Greeks, they placed several boys under the tutorship of one man who functioned as both the teacher and companion of the children. Livy recites a specific incidence of a well-educated schoolmaster who was entrusted with teaching the children of the local leaders. According to Livy, this man took his students outside the walls of the city of Falerii for play and exercise. During the war with the Romans, the teacher was said by Livy to have taken the students further and further from the walls each day, until he saw the opportunity to flee to the Roman camp with the children and surrendered them to the Roman general Camillus. Livy states that Camillus refused to accept the hostages, instead declaring that Falerii shall be conquered through Roman bravery and strategy; Camillus is said to have given the children rods and instructed them to lead the schoolmaster back to the city whilst beating him. Livy concluded by stating that the local Faliscan magistrates were so impressed by this display of Roman virtue, that they voluntarily surrendered themselves believing that they would live better under the Romans than their own laws. There is some evidence of a distinctly Faliscan literature; the Fescennine verses are attributed to the Faliscans and the &quot;metrum Faliscum&quot; (Faliscan meter) may also have been created by the Falisci, although the &quot;metrum Faliscum&quot; is attributed to an unknown author named Serenus by the 2nd-century Latin grammarian Terentianus. Servius states that several laws in the Twelve Tables derive from the Faliscans, however no original Faliscan laws have survived.

=== Funerary practices ===
Possibly the most uniquely Faliscan aspect of Faliscan material culture was their funerary rites. During the beginning of the 8th-century BCE, around the earliest periods of Faliscan history, they cremated their dead and stored the ashes in stone cists. By the last quarter of the 8th-century BCE, burial became more common for upper-class women while cremation remained common for upper-class men. Throughout the rest of the century, Faliscan burial practices evolved towards inhumation in trench or pit tombs and then the usage of sarcophagi. Sarcophagi were replaced with wooden caskets typically made from a hollowed tree trunk by the end of the century. Loculi—a specific type of burial niche—began to be incorporated into Faliscan funerary sites around this time, becoming grave sites themselves by the end of the century. Loculus tombs can be divided into two distinct categories depending upon the number of loculi: the Narce type, containing one loculus, and the Montarano type, containing two. Another loculus tomb discovered in the Celle necropolis uniquely does not contain two loculi placed on opposite walls, but instead on adjacent walls in an L-shaped formation. In the first quarter of the 7th-century BCE, the Faliscans began to use rock-cut chamber tombs. In the northern and southern regions of Faliscan territory, it is common for the chamber tombs to be carved around a pilaster. Faliscan chamber tombs often contain multiple loculi closed with tiles, a layout unlike other contemporary cultures.

In Narce, a 2.8 by 1.55 meter Faliscan sarcophagus was uncovered buried within a 1.45-meter-deep hole in 2012. The sarcophagus was contained inside a recess at the bottom of a trench filled with sand. At the long ends of the sarcophagus, a layer of compacted tufa fragments held the coffin in place. It was enclosed with a layer of irregularly placed rocks, which are then placed beneath separate layers of coal mixed with clay underneath a layer of sand and pozzolana. The final layer, covering all previous strata, consists of large tufa blocks mixed with clay. On the bottom of the sarcophagus, a drainage channel roughly shaped like the letter &quot;Y&quot; ending in a circular hole likely functioned to remove slurry and natural tissues liquified as part of the process of decomposition. This drainage system potentially motivated the unique sloped position of the sarcophagus; the placement on a slope allowed the fluids the flow out of the tomb. Collectively, these practices served to protect the tomb from damage and to preserve the body; in particular, the drainage of fluids helped to delay the rotting of the corpse and possibly to ritualistically purify the body. The grave goods were likely stolen prior to excavation, although remnants of a cup and a bronze fusiform pendant were uncovered.

==== Burial goods ====
Faliscan funerary goods varied depending upon the social status of the deceased; the graves of elites had more ostentatious collections of objects while the graves of lower-class persons stored few offerings. One of the most common burial items in Faliscan society was a type of Etruscan vase called a &quot;holmos&quot;; the number of &quot;holmoi&quot; in a grave is often equivalent to the number of burials. In many circumstances, the grave goods of Faliscan burials were heavily influenced by the material culture of nearby pre-Roman societies. For instance, a bronze bowl with a cuneiform inscription was found in a grave in Falerii. Trade routes connecting various civilizations from across the Mediterranean likely brought material goods from various distinct cultures to the &quot;ager Faliscus&quot;. It is likely that these trade routes, in particular commercial routes with the Etruscans, are responsible for the numerous foreign objects found in Faliscan burials. During the 5th and 6th centuries BCE, the Faliscans traded with the Attic parts of Greece, resulting in large quantities of black and red-figure pottery appearing in Faliscan sites.

Adult Faliscans were buried with grave goods reflecting their role within society; men were often buried with spears and swords on the left side of their corpse while women were often buried with tools for spinning or weaving such as spindle whorls, wooden spindles, a weaving comb pendant, and distaffs. Bronze distaffs occupy the same position in the tombs of women as weaponry occupies in the graves of men. These distaffs were often ornately decorated with inlay of amber and gold. They likely did not serve a utilitarian function for spinning like regular distaffs; instead, they probably served a ceremonial purpose. Linen is mentioned as a characteristic feature of the Faliscan people by the 1st-century CE Roman writer Silius Italicus. Although weapons such as swords and spears are most often found in male graves, ritual axes have been uncovered in female graves. In one burial, a 30–40-year-old woman was buried with a miniature axe covering her forehead. This grave good likely reflected the significance of women or priestesses for religious sacrifice; it possibly reflects a more specific connection between women and the division of the meat of sacrificed animals. 

The graves of female adolescents or children uniquely contain smaller, scaled down burial goods that lack any reference to work-related activities and are sometimes connected to childhood play; they also usually, although not always, lack any reference to the funerary symposium. It was common for the clothing of young girls to be covered in metal plates sometimes adorned with swastikas. Within a Faliscan tomb on the slopes of Monte Greco are the bodies of a mother and daughter, both buried in a trench tomb. Both women wore jewelry, although mother has larger amounts of jewelry and the highest-quality jewelry. The mother was buried with amber pendants that possibly functioned to protect fertility, one of which depicts a woman with their bare hands grasping their belly and the other portrays a monkey. Another, likely fertility-related, pendant from a tomb in Pizzo Piede depicts a woman placing both her hands on her hips, drawing attention to the pubis. This same tomb contains a two-wheeled chariot as a grave good, possibly symbolic of the wedding and funeral rituals as well as the journey into the afterlife.

Archaeological analysis of a cremated Faliscan woman from Narce, who either had recently given birth or was in the late stages of pregnancy, revealed that a necklace of glass paste and amber beads was placed inside the &quot;olla&quot; following the cremation. Beads placed next to objects relating to the mother are similarly found in other structures identified as the graves of infants or female children. Amber is common throughout upper-class Faliscan graves in Narce, likely reflecting a high demand for exotic products. However, amber decorations and full-sized fibulae are primarily found in the graves of women over 30. The material was used to make complex necklaces, embellish tools or the parts of clothing, and—primarily in Narce—to make figurines. Amber figurines are almost exclusively found in female graves, although male graves sometimes contain several amber beads or some amber in fibulae.

Faliscan burial goods contain evidence for Faliscan fashion styles and cosmetics, Figures depicting heads of women found in female—likely high-class—burials that potentially served as wedding gifts, also provide archaeologists with depictions of Faliscan hairstyles; they suggest that Faliscan women may have used a snood to cover their hear. Further evidence for this piece of headgear derives from a mid-4th-century BCE tomb in Coste di Manone; the tomb contains a female skeleton with the remains of hair and fabric, possibly once a component of a snood embroidered with a purple or blue thread. Women are also found buried with cosmetic goods such as—from the 6th-century BCE onwards—bronze mirrors. One glazed black cup from the 3rd-century BCE, contains evidence of a red powder possibly used as lipstick or a rouge. Ancient Faliscan women may have used cylindrical cases to store cosmetic products. Evidence for this is found in a Faliscan krater made in the mid-4th-century BCE, although the usage of these objects for this purpose was likely not as common as in other regions such as Latium. The Faliscans had a tradition of decorating the cinerary urns of women with clothing and garments. Funerary &quot;ollae&quot; belonging to women from the Tufi necropolis were richly ornamented with clothing designs, one urn was wrapped in a belt that likely symbolically represented the body of the deceased. In Narce, the necks of cinerary urns were covered in fibulae and pendants.

=== Religion ===
Several Faliscan deities are attested in Faliscan writings. The &quot;Ceres inscription,&quot; a Faliscan text dated to the 7th or 6th centuries BCE mentioning the name of the goddess Ceres, reads &quot;&quot;ceres ⁝ farme[ ]tom ⁝ louf[ ]rui[ ]m: [ ]kad&quot;.&quot; The name &quot;&quot;ceres&quot; is closely connected to the word &quot;far&quot;,&quot; meaning grain; Ceres, an agricultural goddess, is closely connected to grain in Roman religion. It is also possible that the inscription mentions the name &quot;loụfir&quot;, potentially referring to the god Liber—a Roman viticulture deity—in connection to the Faliscan word &quot;uinom&quot;, meaning wine. However, this interpretation of the text is rejected as &quot;epigraphically impossible&quot; by the Faliscan scholar Gabriël Bakkum.

According to the 1st-century BCE Roman writer Ovid, Faliscan culture heavily emphasized the worship of the goddess Juno: Ovid refers to the Faliscans as &quot;Iunonicolae&quot; in his poem &quot;Fasti&quot;. Ovid described a Faliscan temple of Juno he visited, stating that it resembled Hellenistic structures and reached placed in a clearing surrounded by dark woods reached via a steep road. Another sanctuary at Falerii likely dedicated to Juno contains votive offerings such as axes, spear heads, and a bronze statuette depicting a warrior. Dionysius believed that the Faliscan civilization originated from Argos, citing the supposed similarities between the temple of Juno in Falerii and the temple of Hera at Argos. Dionysius and Ovid both state that the cult of Juno at Falerii continued into their lifetime. Archaeological evidence corroborates this narrative; ancient Roman inscriptions suggest that the cult of Juno Curritis was active during the reign of Emperor Trajan (). However, the religious practices of the cult under Roman occupation may not accurately reflect the traditional Faliscan practices.Various Roman authors mention another popular Faliscan cult called the &quot;Hirpi Sorani&quot; who were said to have conducted ceremonies at Monte Sorratte. This ritual is entirely unmentioned in the epigraphical record, save for one inscription possibly containing the word &quot;sorex&quot; (&quot;priest&quot;) that is potentially connected to this practice. Roman authors largely connect the &quot;Hirpi Sorani&quot; to the god Apollo, an account that is supported by Faliscan inscriptions mentioning cult sites of Apollo. The Faliscans may have worshipped a deity unique to their culture called &quot;Titus Mercus&quot;, a god possibly related to Oscan Mercus or the Roman Mercury. Jupiter is possibly attested in a broken Middle Faliscan inscription reading &quot;&quot;[...]s pater&quot;.&quot; The inscription can be restored as something resembling &quot;dies pater,&quot; an archaic name for Jupiter. Further evidence for Jupiter worship in Faliscan culture comes a statue possibly depicting Jupiter found in a temple in Civita Castellana. Minerva is attested for in the same Middle Faliscan text, which contains the word &quot;&quot;menerua&quot;.&quot; Ovid proposes that the goddess Minerva earned the epithet &quot;Capta&quot; due to an &quot;evocatio&quot; from the Faliscans. Italian archaeologist Mario Torelli argued that the Roman cult of Minerva Capta predated the conquest of the Faliscans and that the &quot;evocatio&quot; merely referred to the capture of the Faliscan statue of Minerva. Similarly, the Roman writers Macrobius and Servius both claim that the cult of Janus Quadrifons was brought to Rome after the conquest of the &quot;ager Faliscus&quot;. 

Faliscan legends and tales are almost exclusively attested on through artwork depicting mythological scenes, often events from Etruscan mythology. However, one Middle Faliscan inscription mentions the name &quot;canumede&quot;, implying that the Faliscans shared the story of Ganymede with other cultures. Ganymede is possibly depicted in a headless statue of a naked young boy holding an &quot;oenochoe&quot; found in a Faliscan temple. If this statue does portray Ganymede, then it possibly indicates that the deity was involved in ceremonial rites of passage for young men in the city. Few Faliscan religious positions are described in the sources; one inscription mentions a &quot;haruspex&quot;, another mentions a &quot;rex&quot; possibly connected to the Rex sacrorum, and Servius claims the &quot;fetiales&quot; priesthood originated from the Faliscans. Two Faliscan festivals, the &quot;Struppearia&quot; and &quot;decimatrus&quot; are described by the 2nd-century Roman grammarian Festus. According to Dionysius, holy women had an important religious function at the temple of Juno in Falerii; he writes that an unmarried girl, called the &quot;canephorus&quot; or the &quot;basket-bearer,&quot; performed the initial sacrificial rites and that an ensemble of virgins sung songs in praise of the goddess. 

===Language===

The Faliscan language, attested by the 7th century BC is an Indo-European language. Together with Latin, it forms the Latino-Faliscan languages group of the Italic languages. It seems probable that the language persisted, being gradually permeated with Latin, until at least 150 BC.

<text>Aarschot () is a city and municipality in the province of Flemish Brabant, in Flanders, Belgium. The municipality comprises the city of Aarschot proper and the towns of Gelrode, Langdorp and Rillaar. On 1 January 2019, Aarschot had a total population of 30,106. The total area is which gives a population density of 446 inhabitants per km2.

It is located in the part of Flemish Brabant called Hageland, located to the east of Leuven. Aarschot is a very typical town with a long history, dating back to the era of the Roman emperors, according to myths. The church, which dominates the look of the city, is built with the typical brown stone quarried from the hills in the surrounding areas. These same hills were in the Middle Ages home to some of the most well-regarded vineyards of Europe. Today the chain hills, which originate in Bolderberg, Heusden-Zolder, and continue as far as Calais in France, are mainly covered with woods and fruit yards.

The title of Duke of Aarschot, created in 1533, is the oldest (not-Sovereign) Ducal title in Belgium (title created for the House of Croÿ, later inherited by the House of Arenberg that still holds it).

While the Church of Our Lady (&quot;Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk&quot;) definitely leaves its mark on the appearance of the city, nothing defines Aarschot better than the river that passes through it: the Demer. Aarschot is situated in the valley of this brown-colored river.

Aarschot was hit very hard in World War I. When German troops occupied the city on 19 August 1914, Colonel Stenger, commander of the 8th German Infantry Brigade, was shot dead on the balcony of the house of Mayor Tielemans, in which he was quartered. Later on it was established that the deadly shots were fired by one of his own German soldiers. The German reprisal was extremely harsh.
Many houses were set alight and 156 people were executed, including Mayor Tielemans and his 15-year-old son. The next day, the entire population was ordered to evacuate the city. Aarschot is known as one of the seven Martyr cities of Belgium because of this event.

==Economy== 
Aarschot is known in the region as a hub for schools and shopping, with a fairly extensive industrial area. In the city center, numerous shops line the streets leading to the Grote Markt. However, the city faces significant vacancy in its downtown area. Since the beginning of 2014, the city has implemented regulations to promote the opening of pop-up stores in the short term, aiming to reduce vacancy rates. In the Hageland region, Leuven serves as the dominant commercial center, offering a wider and more varied range of goods and services. Aarschot is also known for its several large retail spaces. Some garden centers have established themselves along the road to Rillaar. Nearby, the Gouden Kruispunt (Tielt-Winge) serves as a retail hub with over 60 stores. In 2015, construction began on the De Witte Molen small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) zone.

It gains its name from the Germanic name &quot;Baco&quot; and the word &quot;voorde&quot; (which means a place of ferriage, where one can easily cross a stream via a place where the waters are lower), thus roughly meaning &quot;Baco&#x27;s wade&quot;. This ferriage formed the historical center of the town and is nowadays known as the road Steenberg, from Bekkevoort to Zichem and Scherpenheuvel.

<text>Diest () is a city and municipality located in the Belgian province of Flemish Brabant. Situated in the northeast of the Hageland region, Diest neighbours the provinces of Antwerp to its North, and Limburg to the East and is situated around 60 km from Brussels. The municipality comprises the city of Diest proper and the towns of Deurne, Kaggevinne, Molenstede, Schaffen and Webbekom. As of January 1, 2006, Diest had a total population of 22,845. The total area is 58.20 km2 which gives a population density of 393 inhabitants per km2.

==History==
Between 1499 and 1795 the town was controlled by the House of Nassau (as were Breda in the Netherlands, Dillenburg in Germany and Orange in France) which was also the family of the Princes of Orange who at the end of the Napoleonic Wars became in 1815 the kings and queens of the Netherlands after the termination of the Dutch republic at the hands of revolutionary forces in 1795. The most famous representative of the House of Orange was William I of Orange-Nassau. Also known as William the Silent (1533-1584), who led the revolt of the United Provinces against Spain. His son Philip William - who unlike his father remained a pious Catholic throughout his life - is buried in Diest. In his will Philip William commanded that the city&#x27;s parish church of Saint Sulpice should celebrate a yearly Requiem Mass for his soul.

Diest is surrounded by high ramparts, which are partially preserved.

==Attractions==
The Grote Markt (Grand Square) is the central square of Diest and is surrounded by picturesque houses from the 16th to 18th Century. The city hall, which was designed in the 18th century by Willem Ignatius Kerricx, is also located here. In its basement is located the city museum. Exhibits in the museum include the armour of Philip of Orange and a portrait of René of Orange-Nassau and his wife Anna of Lorraine.

The church of St. Sulpitius is also located on the Grote Markt. It was built in 1417-1534 from brown sandstone, typical of this period. The grave of Philip of Orange can be found here. After the death of his father William I of Orange-Nassau, he became Lord of the city. In the turret on the church a famous carillon made by Pieter Hemony in 1671.

Town Centre: The house &quot;Hof van Nassau&quot; in the centre is worth a visit, along with the Gothic church of Our Lady (built 1253-1288) which has an impressive pulpit and high altar. In the Sint Jan Berchmansstraat is the &quot;Gulden Maan&quot; , the house where St. John Berchmans was born.

=== Citadel of Diest ===

The is the only brick citadel left in Flanders. The citadel was built between 1845 and 1843 on the Allerheiligenberg. The construction of the Citadel was the dominant final piece in the transformation of Diest into a fortified city, as the city walls and gates had been built prior. The whole structure is purely geared towards military functionality, with the only embellishment being the bluestone gate in neoclassical style.

The citadel is located on the hills on the Demer. Major Laurillard-Fallot (1787-1842) was responsible for its design. The structure has the shape of a bastioned pentagon with sides of about 190 meters. The whole was surrounded by a dry moat and in front of the gate was a drawbridge. The citadel is located on a site of 28ha and the buildings themselves cover an area of 10,200 m2.

On August 26, 1895, the Royal Decree appeared declassifying the core fortress. The citadel served for a few more years as a barrage fortress to protect the railroad but suffered the same fate on April 20, 1906. After the declassification, a disciplinary company was stationed in the citadel. From 1930 to 1940, it housed a depot of the Third Army Corps. The Germans used the citadel during World War II, and after the surrender, the Allies used it for a short time as a prison. In 1946, National Defense Department placed the citadel at the disposal of the city, and 63 emergency houses were built there. Three years later, all kinds of renovation works to prepare the citadel as accommodation for the First Parachute Battalion began. They arrived on 2 August 1953. In 1968, the two city fronts of the citadel were partially demolished to make way for new buildings.

Since 1996 the citadel has been a protected monument. Together with the other parts of the Diestsesteenweg defence works, Fort Leopold, the Schaffensepoort, and the guard-locks of the Zichem and Leuven gates, it provides a good idea of the military architecture of the second quarter of the 19th century. In 2011, the citadel became vacant. The future of the citadel has not yet been determined. The city of Diest started looking for a new destination for the site.

In 2012, the city council of Diest decided to build a new hospital on the site. This new building were projected to be ready by 2023 in an agreement in principle between &quot;stad Diest&quot; and the &quot;vzw Vereniging Diestse Ziekenhuizen&quot;. These plans were dropped in 2017 and a new destination is being sought for this listed site.

The citadel is home to various sports clubs, cultural associations, educational institutions and youth work. The municipality has made plans for better access with a new staircase and elevator. This should also make the citadel more attractive to tourists. In cooperation with private parties, the municipality will make plans for the further development of the citadel.

<text>Hoegaarden () is a municipality in the province of Flemish Brabant, in Flanders, one of the three regions of Belgium. The municipality comprises the villages of Hoegaarden proper, Meldert and Outgaarden. On January 1, 2006, Hoegaarden had a total population of 6,225. The total area is which gives a population density of 183 inhabitants per km2.

==History==

The current village was founded in 981 by the last ruler of the county of Brunengeruz. Countess Alpaïdis (Alpeide) later gave her county and castle (today the site of St-Gorgoniuskerk) to the Prince-Bishop of Liège. As an enclave of the Liège prince bishopric the village had tax advantages over the villages in the surrounding Duchy of Brabant, leading to the growth of the brewing industry. This tax advantage was lost after the French Revolution once the Prince-Bishopric of Liège was abolished. The industry had withered to nothing by 1955, but Pierre Celis later re-launched the town&#x27;s now iconic white beer which has since gone on to become a global brand. In December 2005, it was decided to close the Hoegaarden Brewery and move the production of the beers to the Jupille brewery in southern Belgium. However, the beer could not be brewed there with the right characteristics, and so was cancelled.
==Famous inhabitants==

<text>Huldenberg () is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Flemish Brabant. The municipality comprises the towns and villages of Huldenberg proper, Loonbeek, , Ottenburg and Sint-Agatha-Rode. On January 1, 2011, Huldenberg had a total population of 9,464. The total area is 39.64 km² which gives a population density of 230 inhabitants per km².

It is the seat of the Belgian branch of the House of Limburg-Stirum.

It has a football club called VK Huldenberg, which was created from a fusion of the clubs FC Huldenberg and VK Rode.

Every Tuesday there is a market from 8h - 13h. This market is located at the Gemeenteplein, near town hall.

At the end of WW II, Mary Churchill, daughter of the British prime minister, was a member of a British all-women anti-aircraft battery 481 that was stationed at Huldenberg for three months. She was entertained by the then burgomaster of Huldenberg, Count Thierry de Limburg Stirum and his wife Marie, &quot;née&quot; Princess of Croÿ. She noted that she found the local people very friendly and helpful and stated (&quot;somewhat priggishly&quot; she admitted) &quot;...the flouting by all of and sundry of whatever regulations existed here, and the wide-spread use of the flourishing &#x27;black market&#x27;. This had been regarded as almost a &#x27;patriotic duty&#x27; during the occupation, but it was still going on now - apparently unrestrained.&quot;

<text>Kortenberg (; ) is a Belgian municipality located in the province of Flemish Brabant, about halfway between the cities of Brussels and Leuven. The municipality comprises the subdivisions or deelgemeenten of Erps-Kwerps, Everberg, Kortenberg proper and Meerbeek. On 1 January 2013 Kortenberg had a total population of 19,393. The total area is 34.52 km2 which gives a population density of about 562 inhabitants per km2. In the southern part of Everberg there is also a hamlet called Vrebos, while between Erps-Kwerps and Meerbeek there is another hamlet called Schoonaarde, which can be found in the proximity of the train station of Erps-Kwerps.

==History==
On the territory of Erps-Kwerps an ancient Roman villa has been excavated. The same archeological site revealed a burial-ground of the Frankish civilisation.

In 1095, Gualgericus, Bishop of Cambrai, acknowledged the existence of a religious community on the Curtenbergh (meaning &#x27;short hill&#x27;). For this reason, 1095 has been accepted as the founding year of Kortenberg. The conventuals moved in 1222 from the hill (the &#x27;Curtenbergh&#x27;) to lower grounds at the Minneveld, where the Abbey of Kortenberg still exists on this day.

From these early days, the Lords of Cortenberg lived in this village. They were of great significance in the history of the duchy of Brabant. 
The formerly independent municipality of Erps had the main bailiwick in the area since 1286.

The construction of a paved road from 1706 until 1709 was an important event in the growth of the municipality, together with the construction of a railroad in 1866. In the end of the nineteenth century the new bourgeoisie built a whole range of new residences in the style of the Belle Epoque with the typical spires.

On 27 August 1914 German troops put a local brewery, some residences and a little castle on fire while invading Kortenberg.

==Abbey of Kortenberg==
There has been a Benedictine abbey in Kortenberg since 1222. In 1312, John II, Duke of Brabant signed the Charter of Kortenberg in the abbey, thereby establishing a constitution for the entire Duchy of Brabant and granting powers to a precursory democratic institution. After the Magna Carta, it is the second document in western history to limit the powers of monarchs in favour of a number of civil freedoms.

The abbey has a stirring history of arson, plundering and reconstruction. The oldest still remaining parts are the gate building with the gothic spired gate from the early seventeenth century, the Cattle Courtyard (&quot;Veehof&quot;) from 1650, the lease courtyard, the Brewery from 1732, and the abbey castle which was built from 1779 until 1783. The traditional great hall and the baroque chapel are dated from 1934. The abbey, which is owned by the diocese, became a protected monument on 14 February 2005 as part of resolution made by the Flemish government. The Old Abbey Kortenberg is a center of contemplation. Today, the grounds have been opened to the public as a park for recreational use.

==Transportation==

The municipality is crossed by the highway A3/E40 (Brussels-Liège). Although the territory contains a parking lot adjacent to this highway, it doesn&#x27;t have any access or exit roads. It lies between exit 21 (Sterrebeek) and exit 22 (Bertem). The main secondary road is the N2, which connects Brussels with Leuven.

<doc id="158328" wikidata="Q926139" url="?curid=158328" title="Rotselaar">
<text>Rotselaar () is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Flemish-Brabant, near the convergence of the Demer and the Dijle. Since 1 January 1977 the municipality comprises the towns of Rotselaar proper, Werchter and Wezemaal. On 1 January 2006 Rotselaar had a total population of 15,068. The total area is 37.57 km² which gives a population density of 401 inhabitants per km².

==Geography==

Rotselaar is located at the convergence of two rivers, the Demer and the Dijle, which in turn have the Winge and the Losting as tributaries, and the Laak River forms the border between Werchter and Tremelo to the north. It&#x27;s also located at the junction of three geographical areas. In rough terms, Werchter to the north of the Demer is a part of the South Campine, Wezemaal and Rotselaar Heikant of the Hageland, whereas Rotselaar-Centre to the west of the Dijle is a part of Binnen-Vlaanderen (Inner Flanders), which is also known as Dijleland.

==History==

Rotselaar and Wezemaal were first mentioned in written accounts in 1044. Only a century later, between 1138 and 1152, Werchter appears in historical documents.

In the 12th century, Rotselaar and Wezemaal were ruled by the Duke of Brabant, whereas the Counts of Aarschot and the House of the Berthouts controlled Werchter. From about 1170, vassals of the Duke of Brabant settled at Wezemaal and Rotselaar. In the course of the 13th century, these vassals rose to the noble Hereditary Marshals of Brabant and started to &quot;rule&quot; the dominium of Rotselaar and Wezemaal as lords. In the 14th century, the Lords of Wezemaal and Rotselaar managed to detract Werchter (and Haacht) from the sphere of influence of the House of the Berthouts, thus uniting the three villages of Wezemaal, Werchter and Rotselaar for the first time in history, which from that moment on together formed the Land, or the Barony of Rotselaar. The Barony of Rotselaar passed into the hands of the powerful House of Croÿ in 1516, to be added to the Margraviate of Aarschot, which was later elevated to the Duchy of Aarschot in 1533.

Until deep in the 19th century, the inhabitants lived primarily of agriculture. From 1488 onwards, the population of Wezemaal, Werchter and Rotselaar was severely hit by periodically recurring wars (1488-1489, 1542, and a series of wars from 1570 up to 1750). From 1750, welfare began to increase again, first thanks to agricultural innovations and in the second half of the 19th century thanks to the effects of the Industrial Revolution.

An artillery duel was fought in Rotselaar in the First World War, known as the ‘Slag aan de Molen’ (English: Battle of the Mill). In that battle, 360 Belgian and German soldiers were killed. During the First World War, a total 67 houses were burned and 38 civilians were killed in Rotselaar.

==Etymology==

===Origin of the names Rotselaar, Wezemaal and Werchter===

The origin of the placenames is unclear. Rotselaar is thought to mean &quot;laar of Hrosda&quot;. A &quot;laar&quot; (plural form is &quot;laren&quot;) is an open spot or clearing in a forest suitable for living, &quot;laren&quot; were used quite intensively by man in the past, amongst others for grazing the cattle, and Hrosda is a male Germanic name. Wezemaal is believed to come from &quot;Wis&quot; and &quot;male&quot; (a depression), and Werchter is thought to be a watername, but the meaning of the name is unknown.

When the name of Rotselaar first appeared in written accounts, it was spelled &quot;Rotslar&quot;. Over the centuries, this evolved into &quot;Rotselaer&quot;, and eventually into &quot;Rotselaar&quot;. In Middle Dutch, the &quot;e&quot; in &quot;Rotselaer&quot; was used to show that the vowel preceding it sounds longer, in modern spelling the vowel is doubled to achieve the same effect, which gives &quot;Rotselaar&quot;.

===Meanings of the name Rotselaar===

The name &quot;Rotselaar&quot; can have four different meanings, and it is important to make a distinction between these meanings in order to avoid ambiguities. In a first meaning, &quot;Rotselaar&quot; refers to the whole of the municipality of Rotselaar as it exists since the merger of municipalities that came into effect on 1 January 1977 and reduced the number of autonomous municipalities in Belgium to 589. If used in this sense, the name &quot;Rotselaar&quot; includes Wezemaal and Werchter. The term &quot;Groot-Rotselaar&quot; (Greater Rotselaar) is also commonly used to refer to Rotselaar, Wezemaal and Werchter as a whole. In a second meaning, &quot;Rotselaar&quot; refers specifically to the town of Rotselaar proper as it existed before the merger with Wezemaal and Werchter in 1977. This is, especially within Groot-Rotselaar, the most common meaning of the name &quot;Rotselaar&quot;. In a third meaning, &quot;Rotselaar&quot; refers to the historical Land of Rotselaar, which comprised not only modern-day Rotselaar, Wezemaal and Werchter, but also other villages, such as Haacht and Wakkerzeel. The name &quot;Rotselaar&quot; in this sense is rarely used.

Rotselaar can also have a fourth meaning, where it refers to Rotselaar-Centre, as opposed to Rotselaar Heikant, which is also referred to as simply &quot;Heikant&quot;. Rotselaar proper (as it existed prior to 1977) consists of two parts: Rotselaar-Centre and Rotselaar Heikant. If used in this sense, the name &quot;Rotselaar&quot; refers only to Rotselaar-Centre and doesn&#x27;t include Heikant. In most cases, the name &quot;Rotselaar&quot; includes Rotselaar Heikant, but the name &quot;Heikant&quot; is commonly used to distinguish between the two parts of Rotselaar.

==Local government==
===Municipal Council===

The Municipal Council is a unicameral body composed of 25 councillors, including the mayor and aldermen. The councillors are elected directly by the voters in the municipality. The Municipal Council is renewed entirely every six years. The municipal elections of 8 October 2006 were the first municipal and provincial elections in Belgium since the transfer of the competence with regards to the municipalities and provinces from the Federal Government to the Regions on 13 June 2001.

The Municipal Council is responsible for everything that is of local interest. This organ draws up rules and ordinances, establishes municipal taxes, approves the budget and the accounts of the municipality, scrutinises the local services, and looks after the interests of its population in general (spatial planning, road building, security, health, youth, sport...). The council also appoints the aldermen. The mayor is nominated by the majority and appointed by the Flemish Government. The council meets once per month.

Between 2007 and 2013, the majority consisted of the CD&amp;V/N-VA combined list, with 14 out of 25 seats. VLD (5 seats), SP.A-Spirit (2 seats), Groen!Sociaal (2 seats) and Vlaams Belang (2 seats) were in the opposition in the Municipal Council, and together had 11 seats out of 25. The Presiding Officer of the Municipal Council was Werner Mertens (CD&amp;V).

Between 2013 and 2018, the majority consisted of CD&amp;V and OpenVLD, CD&amp;V having attained 12 seats, and OpenVLD 3 seats, forming a majority. NV-A (5 seats), GroenSociaal (2 seats) and anders (a local party, 3 seats) were part of the opposition.

In the elections of October 2018, CD&amp;V stayed the largest party with 10 seats, followed by N-VA (5 seats), Open VLD (3 seats), anders (3 seats), Groen (3 seats) and SP.A (1 seat). CD&amp;V announced a coalition with the second party N-VA to form a majority for the legislative session of 2019 and beyond.

===College of Mayor and Aldermen===

The current mayor of Rotselaar is Jelle Wouters (CD&amp;V). His primary responsibilities as mayor include, but are not limited to: security (police, fire service), personnel, communication, festivities, honorary and legal affairs. The mayor is assisted by a number of aldermen, who together form the College of Mayor and Aldermen. Rotselaar is entitled to five aldermen because it has between 10,000 and 19,999 inhabitants.

===Coat of arms and logo ===
The official coat of arms of the municipality of Rotselaar was adopted by the municipal council in 1968 and ratified by Royal Decree in 1973. After the merger with the municipalities of Werchter and Wezemaal, the coat of arms was confirmed by the municipal council and 1981 and ratified in 1982.
The coat of arms consists of three fleur-de-lis gules on a field of silver.

In line with many other municipalities adopting modern fashions, the municipal government decided in 2002 to introduce a new house style with a modern logo replacing the coat of arms in communication and on municipal documents.

This is the meaning of the logo: the keep &quot;Ter Heide&quot; is the symbol for the cultural heritage of Rotselaar, the field tracks symbolise the rural aspects of the municipality and the agriculture, the blue river is the symbol for the three rivers of Rotselaar, the Demer, the Dijle and the Winge, and the lake, the green represents the natural environment and nature reserves of Rotselaar, the plantations and the hills covered with forests, and last but not least, the sun gives Rotselaar blossoming vineyards and refers to the recreational facilities and activities in Rotselaar.

==Demographics==

==Education==

There are 7 primary schools in Rotselaar. There is also a secondary school in Rotselaar, the Montfortcollege, which has a good reputation in the field of education in the region. The Montfortcollege also offers boarding facilities. While many of Rotselaar&#x27;s youths attend primary schools in Rotselaar itself, most go to secondary schools outside of Rotselaar because the waiting lists for the Montfortcollege are often very long, except for boarding school students. Of the youths who attend secondary schools outside of Rotselaar, most go to school in Leuven. The &quot;Hagelandse Academie voor Beeldende Kunst&quot; (Hageland Academy for Visual Arts) is also located in Rotselaar.

==Places of interest==

* The keep &quot;Ter Heide&quot;, this unique tower is based on a Greek cross floorplan and was probably built around the year 1350 on order of Gerard vander Heyden, Drossard of Brabant, who rose to the nobility through marriage. The keep, and the moat surrounding it, was meant to stress his prestige. The keep has six floors that are connected by a spiral staircase. The basement floor and the entrance level are roofed with a barrel vault. The tower was built in brick on a whitestone base, which is directly in the water. The construction was embellished with sandstone and ironstone. The keep has been protected as a monument since 3 July 1942 and was thoroughly restored in 1948. The keep &quot;Ter Heide&quot; is no longer open to the public.

* The watermill &quot;Van Doren&quot;, this watermill was first mentioned in the 12th century and was repeatedly expanded and restored since the 16th century. All these phases were preserved, so the building offers and overview of its archeological and industrial past. The water turbine (1902) has been restored in 1995, since then it generates electricity (70 kW) once more.
* The Sint-Jan-De-Doperkerk (Saint John the Baptist&#x27;s Church) in Werchter, this church dates back to 1439.
* The Sint-Pieterskerk (Saint Peter&#x27;s Church) in Rotselaar, a Neo-Gothic church in the centre of Rotselaar which was rebuilt in 1846.
* The building of the former brewery Mena.
==Recreation==

The Domain Ter Heide is the main recreational domain in Rotselaar. It is also called, in Dutch, &quot;het meer van Rotselaar&quot; or &quot;de Plas van Rotselaar&quot; (the lake of Rotselaar). It is popular among walkers, cyclists and bird-watchers. Fishing is allowed in the fishing zone domain from June 1 to April 15, between sunrise and sunset. But you have to have a public Flemish fishing permit, which is available in the post office.

A variety of other leisure activities are also possible, such as swimming or sunbathing. Outside of the swimming season, the domain&#x27;s swimming zone is open daily from 08:30 to sunset, but during the swimming season it is open from 10:00 to 20:30. Access to the swimming zone is free for inhabitants of Rotselaar. Others have to pay for entry and swimming is only allowed when lifeguards are present and the green flag is out. The swimming season lasts roughly from the middle of May to the end of August, depending on the weather. The swimming zone is delimited by a ditch and a line of buoys, and swimming is prohibited outside of this zone, among other reasons because there is a surfing zone as well. For reasons of hygiene, dogs are not allowed during the swimming season in the entire domain, however, from September 1 dogs on a leash are allowed in the domain, but not in the swimming zone.

Windsurfing is allowed from the Easter holidays to October 15 in the surfing zone, which is separate from the swimming zone for reasons of safety. Ice skating on natural ice is possible as well, though rarely, but it is strictly forbidden to enter the ice unless the municipal government explicitly allows ice skating. If the municipal government allows ice skating, it will publish so in the local press, the &quot;Dorpskrant&quot; (a local newspaper published by the municipal government) and on the website of Rotselaar. There is also a nature zone in the domain, which is off-limits to the public. Other possible activities include, but are not limited to, squash and beach volleyball.

==Rock Werchter==

Rock Werchter is a music festival held annually during the first weekend of the summer holidays in Werchter. It was first organised in 1974 and since 2003 the festival lasts four days, and the 2003 and 2005 editions won the Arthur award for the best festival in the world of the International Live Music Conference. It&#x27;s the largest music festival in Belgium and one of the largest festivals in Europe. It&#x27;s even famous over the Belgian borders. Each year, many renowned groups and artists perform at Rock Werchter, and over 320,000 people come to the festival. Originally it was a double-festival, called &quot;Rock Torhout-Werchter&quot;, with two festival areas on different places in Belgium: one in Werchter and one in Torhout. There is also a &quot;Rock Werchterroute&quot;, a cycling route, around Werchter and Leuven, which also organises an annual music festival which is among the most popular in Belgium, Marktrock. 

==International friendship==
Rotselaar maintains sister city relationships with Bad Gandersheim, a city in southern Lower Saxony, Germany, located between Hannover and Kassel, since 1987. In 1990, a town twinning committee was created for the purpose of furthering the ties between Rotselaar and Bad Gandersheim through visits, s, language courses and other initiatives. An annual town twinning weekend is organised as well, alternately in Rotselaar and Bad Gandersheim.
There has been a cooperation project between Rotselaar and Sal, one of the islands in the archipelago of Cape Verde. The island is around 30 km long by 15 km wide, and has roughly the same number of inhabitants as Rotselaar. Sal has 4 habitational centres: Espargos with the main urban and administrative centre and the international airport of Cape Verde, Santa Maria, where tourism and hotels are situated, Pedra de Lume, once the site of salt collection (hence the name of the island, &quot;sal&quot; is Portuguese for &quot;salt&quot;), and Palmeira, a fishing village with a port.

The request for cooperation came from Sal itself. Basilio Ramos, then mayor of Sal, sought to establish a link with a municipality in the vicinity of Leuven. As a former student of the K.U.Leuven he wanted to strengthen the ties with Belgium. This form of cooperation is different from the others. The cooperation with Sal is a form of development cooperation where the accent is on exchange and partnership in the administrative and the professional fields, and in particular on the exchange of experiences in the fields of environment and youth work.

In 1989, the municipal government adopted the Romanian village of Vrânceni, which is a part of Căiuţi in the eastern county of Bacău, as part of the project &quot;AdoptieDorpen Roemenië&quot; (Adoption Villages Romania). The local action committee organises various activities throughout the year, of which the yields go to the adoption village. Among others, a school building was constructed in Vrânceni with the help of Rotselaar.

<text>Scherpenheuvel-Zichem (; ) is a city and municipality located in the province of Flemish Brabant, Flemish Region, Belgium, encompassing the towns of Averbode, Messelbroek, Okselaar, Scherpenheuvel, Schoonderbuken, Keiberg, Kaggevinne, Testelt and Zichem (previously spelled Sichem, like the biblical town). On January 1, 2020, Scherpenheuvel-Zichem had a total population of 23,135. The total area is 50.50km2 which gives a population density of 458.1 inhabitants per km2.

==Holy site==

Scherpenheuvel (English: &quot;Sharp Hill&quot;), the most important pilgrimage (Roman Catholic) site in Belgium, is located some 50km east of Brussels. Its origins date back to the pagan worship that still survived during the Middle-Ages around a holy oak on this hilltop. The cross-shaped tree was thus &quot;Christianized&quot; with a statue of the Holy Mary.

Legend has it that around AD 1500 the Virgin Mary performed a miracle here, freezing into place a shepherd boy who tried to take home the small statue, thus foiling the theft. As of the 1550s, a flood of devoted pilgrims, arriving from surrounding areas, came to the tree to pray for the health and recovery of their ill loved ones. In 1580, the statue disappeared as Dutch-Protestant iconoclasts pillaged the region. Seven years later it was replaced by a new one, which still stands on the altar of the present-day pilgrimage-church. The oak tree being almost dead but still inspiring in fetishist worship alongside the Roman Catholic devotion to Mary was felled by order of the Bishop of Antwerp. A first wooden chapel was built on the site and a number of statues of the Holy Virgin cut out of the trunk found their way to various sanctuaries (such as Luxembourg). The fame of Scherpenheuvel increased and increasing numbers of people arrived, begging for protection against plague and famine that swept the Low Countries as a consequence of the &quot;Eighty Years War&quot; (Dutch Revolt). The chapel soon became far too small for them.

In January 1603 another miracle was reported: the statue wept tears of blood. The religious schism in the Netherlands was blamed for the pain Mary felt. In November 1603 the Spanish army defeated Protestant troops besieging &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, an important fortification in Northern Brabant.
Archduke Albert of Austria (appointed by the King of Spain as the governor of the Low Countries), and his wife, the Archduchess Isabella (daughter of King Philip II of Spain) donated funds for the construction of a stone chapel in Scherpenheuvel and made a pilgrimage themselves.

In 1604, a few months after its inauguration by the Bishop of Mechelen, the new chapel was looted by Northern troops. The statue was secured by Jesuits. Two months later the Protestants were chased out of Ostend, their last stronghold in the Southern Netherlands. Again, this victory was attributed to the Holy Virgin. Scherpenheuvel was privileged as a city.

Also in 1604, Philips Numann, clerk of the archbishop of Mechelen, described the legend of Scherpenheuvel in his &quot;Historie der Mirakelen&quot; (History of Miracles). The legend was classified as a &quot;folk-tale&quot;, but he also reported the miracles that were recognised as such by the Catholic authorities. His book was translated from Dutch into French, Spanish and English and spread the fame of Scherpenheuvel all over Western Europe.

In 1607, the famous architect-engineer Wenceslas Cobergher was commissioned to build a bastion of Catholic Counter-reformation: the whole city was to be an allegorical homage to the Mother of God, a &quot;hortus conclusus&quot; symbolizing her eternal virginity. Seven lanes lead towards the church. Its layout is based on a 7-pointed star, which stands for the abundance of God&#x27;s mercy. In the church, the advent of Jesus is announced by six Old Testament prophets and realised by Mary who gives birth to the Messiah. In 1609 the first stone was put in place for the unique structure in highly developed baroque style, which was finally inaugurated in 1627. The streets and layout of the town itself were designed to mirror the shape. With its surroundings, it is now one of the best examples of the triumphalist architecture of Counter-Reformation in Belgium.
The dome, adorned with 298 golden stars, symbolizes the cosmos. The main altar is said to be placed on the exact spot where the old oak tree once stood.
Archduchess Isabella attended the inauguration-mass without her deceased husband. She came on foot from nearby Diest, which gave rise to the foot-pilgrimages that still survive from places as distant as Maastricht and Bergen op Zoom. She put all her gold and jewellery before the altar, a custom that persists to this day, in the form of coin throwing.

The pilgrimage at Scherpenheuvel flourished. The &quot;Oratorianen&quot;, an order of religious fathers occupied with religious worship and pilgrimage logistics, had their abbey connected to the church by the &quot;baroque gallery&quot;. They were chased away during the French occupation after the 1797 revolution and did not return until after the religious restoration at the beginning of the 19th century.

In 1927, the church was proclaimed a Roman Catholic &quot;basilica minor&quot;.

Other traditions that survive the centuries at Scherpenheuvel are the &quot;Kaarskensprocessie&quot; (Procession of the candles) on 2 November and blessing-processions for people, pets and animals, and vehicles. The popularity of the pilgrimage also has a lot to do with the year-round fairground atmosphere that characterizes the place: Many stalls selling souvenirs, sweets, typical baked goods such as &quot;pepernoten&quot; and &quot;noppen&quot;, hotels, bars and restaurants of different kinds.

<text>Tervuren (; ) is a municipality in the province of Flemish Brabant, in the Flemish region of Belgium. The municipality comprises the villages of Duisburg, Tervuren proper, Vossem and Moorsel. On 1 January 2006, Tervuren had a total population of 20,636. The total area is , which gives a population density of .

The official language of Tervuren is Dutch, as in the rest of Flanders. Local minorities consist primarily of French-speakers and nationals of many countries of the European Union, the UK, the USA, and Canada. The reason for this diverse mix of nationalities is the presence of expatriate workers and their families working in and around Brussels, usually either for the EU, NATO or for multinational corporations. The British School of Brussels has been located in Tervuren since 1970. Tervuren is also home of the English speaking St. Paul&#x27;s Church, part of the Anglican Church

Tervuren is one of the richest municipalities in Belgium. Directly adjoining the Brussels-Capital Region but only at the unpopulated Sonian Forest, it is linked to Brussels by a large processional avenue, Tervurenlaan, built by King Leopold II for the Universal Exhibition of 1897, which runs through the town, the forest, neighbourhoods of Woluwe-Saint-Pierre and all the way to Cinquantenaire Park at Etterbeek, and is now part of the N3 road. This interweaves with a combined heritage and commuter tramline. Until 1959, Tervuren was also served by an electric railway, whose disused terminus opposite the Royal Museum for Central Africa became a pub named the &quot;Spoorloos Station&quot; (&quot;Trackless Station&quot;), currently named &quot;Bar des Amis&quot;.

==History==
For centuries people thought that Tervuren was the same place as &quot;Fura&quot;, where Saint Hubert (Hubertus) died in 727 AD. There is, however, no historical proof of this, and recent scholarship locates &quot;Fura&quot; in Voeren/Fourons, between Maastricht and Liège.

A document dating from 1213 AD proves the presence of Henry I, Duke of Brabant, possibly in a wooden fortification. This evolved into Tervuren castle, the residence of the dukes of Brabant in the 14th and 15th centuries. The castle was demolished in 1782 under Joseph II, who also demolished the Château Charles, the short-lived summer retreat of Charles of Lorraine. After 1815, the park of Tervuren was granted to William, the prince of Orange and son of the King of the United Netherlands, who constructed the Pavilion of Tervuren, which burned down in 1879.

Tram 44, which travels between Brussels (Montgomery) and Tervuren (and the Royal Museum for Central Africa) exists because of Leopold II&#x27;s desire to bring visitors from around the world to his 1897 exhibition of the Congo Free State.

==Culture==
* The Royal Museum for Central Africa (RMCA), communicating under the name AfricaMuseum since 2018, is an ethnographical and natural history museum. It focuses on the Congo, a former Belgian colony. The sphere of interest, however, especially in biological research, extends to the whole Congo Basin, Central Africa, East Africa, and West Africa. Intended originally as a colonial museum, from 1960 onwards it has focused more on ethnography and anthropology. Some researchers have strong ties with the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences. The museum is surrounded by gardens, with the biggest giant redwood in Flanders, and a large park with lakes. St Hubert Chapel is located at the west end of the park.
* Tervuren Library (Gemeentelijke Openbare Bibliotheek Tervuren - GOBT) is situated at &quot;Markt 7&quot;. It contains around 43,300 printed documents, and 886 DVDs.
==Education==


The Gemeentelijke Basisschool Tervuren has a kindergarten and a primary school. The Heilig Hartcollege (HHC) Tervuren has a primary school as well. It also has a grammar school. The Koninklijke Atheneum Tervuren (KAT) is a primary and grammar school. 
There is also the GITO, a secondary technical school.
The British School of Brussels has been located in Tervuren since 1970.
There are also several alternative schools including the Kristoffel Steiner School (originally for children 2.5 to 6 years and now introducing primary school education). The Steiner method of teaching is subsidised by the Government and follows the curriculum from the Federation of Steiner Schools in Flanders; Dutch speaking but encompasses and accommodates children from different nationalities.

==Twin towns==
Tervuren is twinned with Dachau, Oosterbeek (in Renkum) and Kloster Lehnin.

== Notable people ==

* Luc Coene, governor of the National Bank of Belgium
* Ward Lernout, painter
* Miel Puttemans, athlete
* Prince Laurent of Belgium
* Henry Van de Velde, painter, architect, and interior designer
* Christian Dotremont, painter and co-founder of the COBRA movement
* Frank Vandenbroucke, politician

<text>Tienen (; ) is a city and municipality in the province of Flemish Brabant, in Flanders, Belgium. The municipality comprises Tienen itself and the towns of Bost, Goetsenhoven, Hakendover, Kumtich, Oorbeek, Oplinter, Sint-Margriete-Houtem and Vissenaken.

On 1 January 2017, Tienen had a total population of 34,365. The total area is , which gives a population density of .

==History==
Tienen was once a Roman settlement and trade center with roads to other important places. In the early Middle Ages, the town was probably ruled by an old German family Thienen.

During the 1635 to 1659 Franco-Spanish War, Tienen was part of the Spanish Netherlands and was captured by a combined Franco-Dutch army in May 1635. Its capture resulted in one of the most serious atrocities of the Dutch Revolt; the town was sacked, over 200 civilians killed and many buildings damaged, including Catholic churches and monasteries. This ended Dutch prospects of winning over the predominantly Catholic population of the Southern Netherlands.

After the 1714 Treaty of Utrecht, the town was incorporated into the Austrian Netherlands; in the French Revolutionary Wars, it was used as a base by French Republican General Charles François Dumouriez during the Battle of Neerwinden. On 16 March 1793, the French repulsed an Austrian army commanded by Prince Josias of Coburg. This was the last victory for the veteran Dumouriez, hero of Valmy and Jemappes; within a week, his army suffered such catastrophic defeats that he defected to the French Royalists.

==Economy==
Tienen is the centre of sugar production in Belgium; a huge sugar beet processing factory, the Sugar refinery of Tienen (&quot;Tiense Suikerraffinaderij - Raffinerie Tirlemontoise&quot;), is located at the eastern edge of the town. It is the site of facilities owned by Citrique Belge, that produces citric acid, and Havells Sylvania, a manufacturer of energy saving lamps.

==Culture and significant landmarks==
Tienen is the location of a summer rock festival known as &#x27;Suikerrock&#x27;.

The Sint-Germanus (St. Germain) Church dates from the 12th century and has an altarpiece by the 19th-century painter Gustaaf Wappers. Its belfry has earned that complex a designation on the UNESCO World Heritage Site list of Belfries of Belgium and France.

The principal church, Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-ten-Poel (Our Lady of the Pool), was begun in the 12th and enlarged in the 15th century; it remains unfinished.

==Transport==
The town is served by Tienen railway station, the oldest in Belgium still in use. There are also some taxi companies.

<doc id="158338" wikidata="Q882739" url="?curid=158338" title="Blue Nile">
<text>The Blue Nile is a river originating at Lake Tana in Ethiopia. It travels for approximately through Ethiopia and Sudan. Along with the White Nile, it is one of the two major tributaries of the Nile and supplies about 85.6% of the water to the Nile during the rainy season.

== Course ==
The distance of the river from its source to its confluence has been variously reported between . This uncertainty might result from the fact that the river flows through a series of virtually impenetrable gorges cut in the Ethiopian Highlands to a depth of some . According to materials published by the Central Statistical Agency, an Ethiopian government agency, the Blue Nile has a total length of , of which are inside Ethiopia. 

=== In Ethiopia ===
The Blue Nile originates at Lake Tana in Ethiopia (where it is called the Abay River). The river flows generally south before entering a canyon about long, about from Lake Tana, which is a tremendous obstacle for travel and communication between north and south Ethiopia. The canyon was first referred to as the &quot;Grand Canyon&quot; in 1968 by a British team that accomplished the first descent of the river from Lake Tana to the end of the canyon; subsequent river rafting parties called it the &quot;Grand Canyon of the Nile&quot;. The Blue Nile Falls (Amharic: Tis Abay, literally &quot;great smoke&quot;), one of Ethiopia&#x27;s biggest tourist attractions, is located at the start of the canyon.

The river loops across northwest Ethiopia before being fed by numerous tributaries between Lake Tana and the Ethiopia–Sudan border. Those on its left bank, in downstream order, include the Wanqa River, the Bashilo River, the Walaqa River, the Wanchet River, the Jamma River, the Muger River, the Guder River, the Agwel River, the Nedi River, the Didessa River and the Dabus River. Those on the right side, also in downstream order, include the Handassa, Tul, Abaya, Sade, Tammi, Cha, Shita, Suha, Muga, Gulla, Temcha, Bachat, Katlan, Jiba, Chamoga, Weter and the Beles.

=== In Sudan ===
The Blue Nile then heads northwest into Sudan. It travels for approximately , flowing past Er Roseires and receiving the Dinder River on its right bank at Dinder. At Khartoum, the Blue Nile joins the White Nile and, as the Nile, flows through Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria.

== Water flow ==

The flow of the Blue Nile reaches maximum volume in the rainy season from June to September, when it supplies 8086% of the water of the Nile proper. The river was a major source of the flooding of the Nile in Egypt that contributed to the fertility of the Nile Valley and the consequent rise of Ancient Egypt and Egyptian mythology. With the completion of the Aswan Dam in 1970, these floods stopped occurring in lower Egypt. During the summer monsoon season, the Blue Nile floods erode a vast amount of fertile soil from the Ethiopian Highlands and carry it downstream as silt, turning the water dark brown or almost black.

The Blue Nile is vital to the livelihood of Egypt: as the most significant tributary of the Nile, it contributes over 85% of the Nile&#x27;s streamflow. Though shorter than the White Nile, 59% of the water that reaches Egypt originates from the Ethiopian highlands via the Blue Nile. The river is also an important resource for Sudan, where the Roseires Dam and Sennar Dam contribute to the 80% of the country&#x27;s electricity generation from hydropower. These dams also help irrigate the Gezira Scheme, which is most famous for its high-quality cotton, as well as wheat and animal feed crop production in the area.

In November 2012, Ethiopia began construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, a 6000-megawatt hydroelectric dam on the river. The dam is expected to be a boost for the Ethiopian economy. Sudan and Egypt, however, voiced their concerns over a potential reduction in water available. Electricity generation began in February 2022.

== History ==

=== Early European exploration ===
The first European known to have seen the Blue Nile in Ethiopia and the river&#x27;s source was Pedro Páez, a Spanish Jesuit who reached the river&#x27;s source on 21 April 1618. However, the Portuguese João Bermudes, the self-described &quot;Patriarch of Ethiopia,&quot; provided the first description of the Tis Abay River Falls in his memoirs published in 1565, and any number of Europeans who lived in Ethiopia in the late 15th century such as Pêro da Covilhã could have seen the river long before Páez, but not reached its source. The source of the Nile proper was also reached in 1629 by the Portuguese Jesuit missionary Jerónimo Lobo and in 1770 by the Scottish explorer James Bruce.

Although European explorers contemplated tracing the course of the Nile from the Blue Nile&#x27;s confluence with the White Nile to Lake Tana, the Blue Nile Canyon has discouraged all attempts since Frédéric Cailliaud&#x27;s attempt in 1821. The first serious attempt by a non-local to explore this reach of the river was undertaken by the American W.W. Macmillan in 1902, assisted by the Norwegian explorer B.H. Jenssen; Jenssen proceeded upriver from Khartoum while Macmillan sailed downstream from Lake Tana. However, Jenssen&#x27;s boats were blocked by the rapids at Famaka short of the Sudan-Ethiopia border, and Macmillan&#x27;s boats were wrecked shortly after they had been launched. Macmillan encouraged Jenssen to try to sail upstream from Khartoum again in 1905, but he was forced to stop short of Lake Tana. Robert Cheesman, who records his surprise on arriving in Ethiopia at finding that the upper waters of &quot;one of the most famous of the rivers of the world, and one whose name was well known to the ancients&quot; was in his lifetime &quot;marked on the map by dotted lines&quot;, managed to map the upper course of the Blue Nile between 1925 and 1933. He did this not by following the river along its banks and through its impassable canyon but by following it from the highlands above, travelling some by mule in the adjacent country.

=== Present day ===
In the 1950s and 1960s, several kayakers paddled parts of the canyon. In 1968, at the request of Haile Selassie, a team of 60 British and Ethiopian servicemen and scientists made the first full descent of the river from Lake Tana to a point near the Sudanese border led by explorer John Blashford-Snell. The team used specially-built Avon Inflatables and modified Royal Engineers assault boats to navigate the formidable rapids. Subsequent rafting expeditions in the 1970s and 1980s generally only covered parts of the river canyon.

In 1999, writer Virginia Morell and photographer Nevada Wier made the journey by raft from Lake Tana to Sudan, publishing a documentary about their journey afterwards. In 2000, American and National Geographic reader, Kenneth Frantz, saw a photo taken by Nevada Wier for &quot;National Geographic&quot; which would lead him to found the charity Bridges to Prosperity. This photo showed a bridge broken during World War II, with 10 men on either side of the broken span pulling each other across the dangerous gap by rope. This historic bridge was built by Emperor Fasilides in approximately 1660 with Roman bridge technology brought to Ethiopia by Portuguese soldiers during the battle with the Muslim invaders in 1507. In both 2001 and 2009, Bridges to Prosperity volunteers travelled from the United States to repair the broken bridge across the Blue Nile and later built a new suspension bridge not susceptible to flood.

On 28 April 2004, geologist Pasquale Scaturro and his partner, kayaker and documentary filmmaker Gordon Brown, became the first known people to navigate the Blue Nile in its entirety. Though their expedition included several others, Brown and Scaturro were the only ones to remain on the expedition for the entire journey. They chronicled their adventure with an IMAX camera and two handheld video cameras, sharing their story in the film &quot;Mystery of the Nile&quot; and in a book of the same title.

On 29 January 2005, Canadian Les Jickling and his teammate New Zealander Mark Tanner completed the first fully human-powered transit of the entire Blue Nile and the Nile in the Sudan and Egypt. Their journey of over took five months and traveled through Ethiopia, Sudan, and Egypt. They recount that they paddled through civil war conflict zones, regions known for bandits, and encountered multiple hazards and rapids.

<text>Whipping Star is a 1970 science fiction novel by American writer Frank Herbert. It is the first full-length novel set in the ConSentiency universe established by Herbert in his short stories “A Matter of Traces” and “The Tactful Saboteur”.

== Plot summary ==

In a far-flung future in which Earth is not so much as mentioned, Homo sapiens and other sentient species, namely the Gowachin, Laclac, Wreaves, Pan Spechi, Taprisiots, and Caleban, comprise the galaxy-spanning ConSentiency. After suffering the unexpected consequences a pure democracy –laws could be created so quickly that no thought could be given to their full consequences– the sentients formed Bureau of Sabotage (BuSab) to slow the wheels of government, thereby precluding reckless legislation. Not itself a law-enforcement organization, its ambit comprises elements of both espionage and diplomacy.

Jorj X. McKie is a &quot;saboteur extraordinary&quot;, a born troublemaker who has naturally become one of BuSab&#x27;s best agents. As the novel opens, the small population of immensely powerful Calebans, by far the most powerful and inscrutable members of the ConSentiency, have been disappearing one by one, inexplicably leaving millions of deaths and numerous cases of incurable insanity in their wake. Only one remains: the partially corporeal Fanny Mae. 

Ninety years prior to the setting of &quot;Whipping Star&quot;, the Calebans had appeared and offered jumpdoors to the ConSentiency, affording instantaneous travel to any point in the galaxy. This seemingly miraculous technology was accepted with out `too many questions being asked (and even fewer being answered), and the sociology of the ConSentiency was remade. Mliss Abnethe, a sociopathic sadist human female of immense power and wealth had however somehow contractually bound the all-too-curious Caleban Fanny Mae to be apparently whipped to death; when Fanny May dies, everyone who has ever used a jumpdoor (which is practically speaking everyone in existence) will die as well. 

The Calebans begin to flee one at a time, leaving our plane of existence (or exiting &quot;our wave&quot;). Inasmuch as all Calebans are interconnected, if they were to remain in our wave of existence when Fanny Mae dies, they would also die. McKie has to find Mliss and stop her mad, solipsistic project before Fanny Mae reaches, in her words, &quot;ultimate discontinuity&quot; and civilization utterly collapses and all sentience with it. Maddeningly he is constrained by the law protecting private individuals, which restricts the ministrations of BuSab to public entities.

===Editorial review===

The action ranges from solar systems to office politics, ontology to semantics, and more. In the denouement Fanny Mae&#x27;s insatiable curiosity stands her in good stead, and sufficient communication is established with BuSab for the mystery to be solved and the omnigenocidal gang to be hoist by their own petard. It proves that the Caleban are more alien than any of the other species imagined, or could have imagined. Not only were the jumpdoors intrinsic aspects of their own hyperdimensional being (they &quot;were&quot; the network), they partially manifested in our wave as stars. Accordingly &quot;Fannie Mae&quot;, home being an important plot element and her identity more fully revealed, requests that she be addressed as Thyone, a star in the Pleiades henceforth.

==Related works==
&quot;Whipping Star&quot; was preceded by the short story &quot;The Tactful Saboteur&quot;. It was followed in 1977 by Herbert&#x27;s &quot;The Dosadi Experiment&quot;. These stories take place in the same imaginary universe and have the same main character, Jorj X. McKie, as in &quot;Whipping Star&quot;.

==Features related to other Herbert works==

The chairdogs that appear in multiple &quot;Dune&quot; novels—both the original series by Frank Herbert, as well as the extended series by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson—are also a feature of the later &quot;Whipping Star&quot; novel.

== Main characters ==

<text>Donald King (born August 20, 1931) is an American boxing promoter, known for his involvement in several historic boxing matchups.

King&#x27;s career highlights include, among multiple other enterprises, promoting &quot;The Rumble in the Jungle&quot; and the &quot;Thrilla in Manila&quot;. King has promoted some of the most prominent names in boxing, including Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, George Foreman, Larry Holmes, Tomasz Adamek, Roberto Duran, Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Chris Byrd, John Ruiz, Julio César Chávez, Ricardo Mayorga, Andrew Golota, Bernard Hopkins, Félix Trinidad, Roy Jones Jr., Azumah Nelson, Gerald McClellan, Marco Antonio Barrera, Salvador Sanchez, Wilfred Benitez, Wilfredo Gomez and Christy Martin. Some of these boxers sued him for allegedly defrauding them. Mike Tyson was quoted as saying, &quot;He did more bad to black fighters than any white promoter ever in the history of boxing.&quot;

King has been charged with killing two people in incidents 13 years apart. In 1954, King shot a man in the back after spotting him trying to rob one of his gambling houses; this incident was ruled a justifiable homicide. In 1967, King was convicted of voluntary manslaughter for stomping one of his employees to death because he owed him $600. For this, he served three years and eleven months in prison.

== Early life ==
King was born in Cleveland, Ohio, as the fifth of six children to Clarence and Hattie King. Clarence worked at the Otis Steel plant owned by the Jones &amp; Laughlin company and was killed in a workplace accident on December 7, 1941, when a ladle exploded and engulfed him in molten steel. Hattie received $10,000 () in compensation and relocated the family to the middle-class Mount Pleasant neighborhood. His mother made a living selling peanuts and homemade pies, helped by King and his younger sister and sold the wares at a local &quot;policy house&quot; that used the guise of a concession stand to run a numbers game. King and his older brothers all eventually became involved in the betting scheme, with King later stating &quot;So now what we did is we capitalized off of this here, and we hustled. It was statutorily illegal, but who knew about the statutes?&quot;. King graduated from John Adams High in 1951 and briefly attended Kent State University before dropping out.

=== Bookmaking and killings ===
Beginning in 1951, King ran an illegal bookmaking operation out of the basement of a record store on Kinsman Road, earning the byname &quot;The Kid&quot;, as well as the nicknames &quot;Kingpin&quot; and &quot;the Numbers Czar&quot;. During this time, King was charged with killing two men in incidents 13 years apart. On December 2, 1954, King fatally shot Hillary Brown in the back while he and two accomplices were attempting to rob one of King&#x27;s gambling houses on East 123rd Street. This first killing was determined to be justifiable homicide.

On April 20, 1966, King killed an employee, 34-year-old Sam Garrett, in an open street in front of several witnesses, for owing $600 in debt. King beat and kicked Garrett and held a .357 magnum revolver to his head; Garrett never regained consciousness and died of severe head trauma on April 24. King claimed self-defense, while the prosecution, supported by witness testimony, including that of arresting police officer Bob Tonne, argued that Garrett was attacked by King, with Garrett&#x27;s last words being quoted as &quot;Don, I&#x27;ll pay you the money&quot;. He was convicted of second-degree murder for the second killing in 1967 and sentenced to one-to-twenty years imprisonment. While he served his term at the Marion Correctional Institution, he began self-education; according to his own words, he read everything in the prison library he could get his hands on.
I learned this here, in the in the penitentiary, in reading everything that I can find my hands on, and didn&#x27;t living the life that I live before I got to the penitentiary. That gave me an enlightenment on life that &quot;don&#x27;t get mad, get smart.&quot; That&#x27;s why I want other kids to educate themselves, put it in their brain, they can&#x27;t take that away.

In 1972 after serving three years and eleven months, King was released when his attorney reduced the conviction to manslaughter. King was pardoned in 1983 by Ohio Governor Jim Rhodes, with letters from Jesse Jackson, Coretta Scott King, George Voinovich, Art Modell, and Gabe Paul, among others, being written in support of King.

== Career ==
King entered the boxing world after convincing Muhammad Ali to box in a charity exhibition for a local hospital in Cleveland with the help of singer Lloyd Price. Early on, he formed a partnership with a local promoter named Don Elbaum, who already had a stable of fighters in Cleveland and years of experience in boxing. In 1974, King negotiated to promote a heavyweight championship fight between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in Zaire, popularly known as &quot;The Rumble in the Jungle&quot;. The fight between Ali and Foreman was a much-anticipated event. King&#x27;s rivals all sought to promote the bout, but King was able to secure the then-record $10 million purse through an arrangement with the government of Zaire.

King arranged Ali&#x27;s 1975 fight against journeyman Chuck Wepner. It is widely believed the fight inspired Sylvester Stallone to write the screenplay for &quot;Rocky&quot; (1976).

King solidified his position as one of boxing&#x27;s preeminent promoters later that year with the third fight between Ali and Joe Frazier in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, which King deemed the &quot;Thrilla in Manila&quot;. Aside from promoting the premier heavyweight fights of the 1970s, King was also busy expanding his boxing empire. Throughout the decade, he compiled an impressive roster of fighters, many of whom would finish their career with Hall of Fame credentials. Fighters including Larry Holmes, Wilfred Benítez, Roberto Durán, Salvador Sánchez, Wilfredo Gómez, and Alexis Argüello would all fight under the Don King Productions promotional banner in the 1970s.

For the next two decades, King continued to be among boxing&#x27;s most successful promoters. Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Julio César Chávez, Aaron Pryor, Bernard Hopkins, Ricardo López, Félix Trinidad, Terry Norris, Carlos Zárate, Azumah Nelson, Andrew Gołota, Mike McCallum, Gerald McClellan, Meldrick Taylor, Marco Antonio Barrera, Tomasz Adamek, John Ruiz, and Ricardo Mayorga are some of the boxers who chose King to promote many of their biggest fights.

Outside of boxing, he was the concert promoter for The Jacksons&#x27; 1984 Victory Tour. In 1998, King purchased a Cleveland-based weekly newspaper serving the African American community in Ohio, the &quot;Call and Post&quot;, and as of 2011 continued as its publisher.

King was elected to the Gaming Hall of Fame in 2008.

In 2023, He was announced as the financier of the Bomaye Fight Club in Major League Wrestling.

As of 2024, King still promoted world champions and was in talks with Canadian boxing promoter Dan Otter to stage a WBC cruiserweight world title bout sometime that year.

== Personal life ==

Don King&#x27;s wife, Henrietta, died on December 2, 2010, at the age of 87. They had one biological daughter, Debbie, a son, Eric and adopted son Carl, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

King is politically active and supported Barack Obama in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. During the previous election, he had made media appearances promoting George W. Bush, which had included attendance at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City. He also has been a longtime supporter of Donald Trump.

On June 10, 1987, King was made a &#x27;Mason-at-Sight&#x27; by &quot;Grand Master&quot; Odes J. Kyle Jr. of the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Ohio, thereby making him a Prince Hall Freemason. In the following year, he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humane letters degree from Central State University in Wilberforce, Ohio, by University President Dr. Arthur E. Thomas.

King has conducted an annual turkey giveaway each Christmas for several years, in which he distributes two thousand free turkeys to needy South Floridians.

In September 2024, King was hospitalized for an unspecified illness that required a blood transfusion. Widespread concern for King&#x27;s health was prompted by a Mike Tyson media interview where he said, &quot;You know, Don is not doing well right now. He&#x27;s probably close to 100 years old. He&#x27;s not doing well.&quot;

== Lawsuits and prosecutions ==
King has been investigated for possible connections with organized crime. On May 20, 1957, the porch of King&#x27;s house was bombed and in October of the same year, King was shot in the head and neck with a shotgun by unidentified gunmen, reportedly due to his refusal to pay $200 in monthly protection money to crime boss Shondor Birns. In December 1957, King&#x27;s house was raided by the IRS for evasion of $32,029 () in policy tax. Charges of blackmail against Birns and five others were ultimately dropped in July 1958 when King declined to testify in court. During a 1992 Senate investigation, King invoked the Fifth Amendment when questioned about his connection to mobster John Gotti. When IBF president Robert W. Lee Sr. was indicted for racketeering in 1999, King was not indicted, nor did he testify at Lee&#x27;s trial, though prosecutors reportedly &quot;called him an unindicted co-conspirator who was the principal beneficiary of Lee&#x27;s machinations.&quot;

King has been involved in many fraud litigation cases with boxers. In 1982, he was sued by Muhammad Ali for underpaying him $1.1 million for a fight with Larry Holmes. King called in an old friend of Ali, Jeremiah Shabazz, and handed him a suitcase containing $50,000 in cash and a letter ending Ali&#x27;s lawsuit against King. He asked Shabazz to visit Ali (who was in the hospital due to his failing health), get him to sign the letter, and then give Ali the $50,000. Ali signed it. The letter even gave King the right to promote any future Ali fights. According to Shabazz, &quot;Ali was ailing by then and mumbling a lot. I guess he needed the money.&quot; Shabazz later regretted helping King. Ali&#x27;s lawyer cried when he learned that Ali had ended the lawsuit without telling him.

Larry Holmes has alleged that over the course of his career, King cheated him out of $10 million in fight purses, including claiming 25% of his purses as a hidden manager. Holmes says he received only $150,000 of a contracted $500,000 for his fight with Ken Norton, and $50,000 of $200,000 for facing Earnie Shavers, and claims King cut his purses for bouts with Muhammad Ali, Randall &quot;Tex&quot; Cobb, and Leon Spinks, underpaying him $2 million, $700,000, and $250,000, respectively. Holmes sued King over the accounting and auditing for the Gerry Cooney fight, charging that he was underpaid by $2 to $3 million. Holmes sued King after King deducted a $300,000 &#x27;finder&#x27;s fee&#x27; from his fight purse against Mike Tyson; Holmes settled for $150,000 and also signed a legal agreement pledging not to give any more negative information about King to reporters.

Tim Witherspoon was threatened with being blackballed if he did not sign exclusive contracts with King and his stepson Carl. Not permitted to have his own lawyer present, he signed four &quot;contracts of servitude&quot; (according to Jack Newfield). One was an exclusive promotional contract with Don King, two were managerial contracts with Carl King, identical except one was &quot;for show&quot; that gave Carl King 33% of Witherspoon&#x27;s purses and the other gave King a 50% share, more than is allowed by many boxing commissions. The fourth contract was completely blank. Other examples include Witherspoon being promised $150,000 for his fight with Larry Holmes but receiving only $52,750. King&#x27;s son Carl took 50% of Witherspoon&#x27;s purse, illegal under Nevada rules, and the WBC sanctioning fee was also deducted from his purse. He was forced to train at King&#x27;s own training camp at Orwell, Ohio, instead of Ali&#x27;s Deer Lake camp which Ali allowed Witherspoon to use for free. For his fight with Greg Page he received a net amount of $44,460 from his guaranteed purse of $250,000. King had deducted money for training expenses, sparring partners, fight and airplane tickets for his friends and family. Witherspoon was never paid a stipulated $100,000 for his training expenses and instead was billed $150 a day for using King&#x27;s training camp. Carl King again received 50% of his purse, despite Don King Productions falsely claiming he had only been paid 33%. HBO paid King $1,700,000 for Witherspoon to fight Frank Bruno. Witherspoon got a purse of $500,000 but received only $90,000 after King&#x27;s deductions. Carl King received $275,000. In 1987, Witherspoon sued King for $25 million in damages. He eventually settled for $1 million out of court.

Former undisputed World Heavyweight Boxing Champion Mike Tyson has described King, his former promoter, as &quot;ruthless&quot;, &quot;deplorable&quot;, and &quot;greedy&quot;. In 1998, Tyson sued King for $100 million, alleging that the boxing promoter had cheated him out of millions over more than a decade. The lawsuit was later settled out of court, with Tyson receiving $14 million.

In 1996, Terry Norris sued King, alleging that King had stolen money from him and conspired with his manager to underpay him for fights. The case went to trial, but King settled out of court for $7.5 million in 2003. King also acceded to Norris&#x27;s demand that the settlement be made public.
In 2005, King launched a $2.5 billion defamation suit against the Walt Disney Pictures–owned ESPN, the makers of &quot;SportsCentury&quot;, after a documentary alleged that King had &quot;killed, not once, but twice&quot;, threatened to break Larry Holmes&#x27; legs, had a hospital invest in a film that was never made, cheated Meldrick Taylor out of $1 million, and then threatened to have Taylor killed. Though the documentary repeated many claims that were already made, King said he had now had enough. King&#x27;s attorney said &quot;It was slanted to show Don in the worst way. It was one-sided from day one, Don is a strong man, but he has been hurt by this.&quot; The case was dismissed on summary judgment with a finding that King could not show &quot;actual malice&quot; from the defendants, and that King had failed to prove that any of the challenged statements were false. The judgment also pointed out that the studio had tried on a number of occasions to interview King for the documentary, but he had declined; while not suggesting that King had a legal obligation to do so, the court sympathized with ESPN&#x27;s circumstances on those grounds. King appealed the decision and, 3 years later, the Second District Court of Appeals upheld the summary judgment, but disagreed with the original finding that none of the statements were false. In any case, Judge Dorian Damoorgian ruled, &quot;Nothing in the record shows that ESPN purposefully made false statements about King in order to bolster the theme of the program or to inflict harm on King&quot;.

In May 2003, King was sued by Lennox Lewis, who wanted $385 million from the promoter, claiming King used threats to pull Tyson away from a rematch with Lewis.

<text>The Volsci (, , ) were an Italic tribe, well known in the history of the first century of the Roman Republic. At the time they inhabited the partly hilly, partly marshy district of the south of Latium, bounded by the Aurunci and Samnites on the south, the Hernici on the east, and stretching roughly from Norba and Cora in the north to Antium in the south. Rivals of Rome for several hundred years, their territories were taken over by and assimilated into the growing republic by 304 BC. Rome&#x27;s first emperor Augustus was of Volscian descent.

==Description by the ancient geographers==
Strabo says that the Volsci formed a sovereign state near the site of Rome. It was placed in the Pomentine plain, between the Latins and the Pontine marshes, which took their name from the plain. 

The Volsci were divided in Antiates Volsci (capital Antium) on the Tyrrhenian coast, and Ecetran Volsci (Ecetra) in the hinterland.

==Language==

The Volsci spoke Volscian, a Sabellic Italic language, which was closely related to Oscan and Umbrian, and more distantly to Latin.

In the Volscian territory lay the little town of Velitrae (modern Velletri), home of the ancestors of Caesar Augustus. From this town comes an inscription dating probably from early in the 3rd century BC; it is cut upon a small bronze plate (now in the Naples Museum), which must have once been fixed to some votive object, and dedicated to the god Declunus (or the goddess Decluna).

==Conflict with ancient Rome==

The Volsci were among the most dangerous enemies of ancient Rome, and frequently allied with the Aequi, whereas their neighbors, the Hernici, were allied with Rome after 486 BC. 

According to the semi-legendary history of early Rome, its seventh and last king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, was the first to go to war against the Volsci, commencing two centuries of conflict between the two states.

Gaius Marcius Coriolanus, the legendary Roman warrior, earned his cognomen after capturing the Volscian town of Corioli in 493 BC. The reputed rise and fall of this Roman hero is chronicled in Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, which served as the basis for the Shakespeare play, &quot;Coriolanus&quot;. 

However, if Livy&#x27;s account of the war between Rome and Clusium is accurate, it would seem that the relationship between Rome and the Volsci was not always hostile. Livy writes that at the approach of the Clusian army in 508 BC, with the prospect of a siege, the Roman senate arranged for the purchase of grain from the Volsci to feed the lower classes of Rome.

== Prominent Volsci ==

* Camilla in Virgil&#x27;s Aeneid, a Volscian Warrior Maiden (like the legendary Amazons).
* Attius Tullus Aufidius, leader of the Volsci during the Roman–Volscian wars.

=== Prominent Romans of Volscian ancestry ===

* Augustus, first Roman emperor.
* Decius, Roman emperor from 249 to 251.

=== Roman Gentes of Volscian origin ===
* Balventia gens
* Messia gens
* Octavia gens
* Pomptina gens
* Publicia gens

<doc id="158354" wikidata="Q2527160" url="?curid=158354" title="The Dosadi Experiment">
<text>The Dosadi Experiment is a 1977 science fiction novel by American writer Frank Herbert. It is the second full-length novel set in the ConSentiency universe established by Herbert in his short stories &quot;A Matter of Traces&quot; and &quot;The Tactful Saboteur&quot;, and continued in his novel &quot;Whipping Star&quot;. It was first published as a four-part serial in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; magazine from May to August, 1977.

==Plot summary==
The novel is set in a distant future when humans are part of an interstellar civilization, the ConSentiency comprising numerous species. Mysterious and powerful Caleban provide &quot;jump-doors&quot; (which allow instantaneous travel between any two points in the universe); this is the glue that holds the far-flung ConSentiency together. Unfortunately, one consequence of the technology is the possibility that large numbers of unsuspecting sentients can be diverted to destinations unknown for nefarious purposes. A government saboteur attempts to expose one such plot.

Jorj X. McKie is a &quot;Saboteur Extraordinary&quot;, one of the principals of the Bureau of Sabotage, and the only human admitted to practice law before the Gowachin bar as a &quot;legum&quot; (lawyer). Whilst meditating in a park on the grounds the Bureau&#x27;s headquarters, McKie is mentally contacted by the Caleban Fannie Mae, a nominally female member of a multidimensional species of unparalleled power, who cryptically explains his mission. (Their dialogue has elements of a lover&#x27;s spat, which is indicative of the depth of their relationship.)

Generations ago, a secret, unauthorized experiment by the Gowachins was carried out with the help of a contract with the Calebans. The planet Dosadi was isolated behind an impenetrable barrier (called &quot;The God Wall&quot;) and populated with humans and Gowachin. The planet and its biosphere are massively poisonous except for a deep narrow valley containing the city-state &quot;Chu&quot;, into which nearly 89 million humans and Gowachin are crowded under terrible conditions. The culture of ordinary day-to-day power on Dosadi is hence extremely violent. At the time of the story Chu is ruled by a dictator. Numerous other governmental systems have been installed by DemoPol, a computer system used to manipulate the populace without its consent or knowledge. Furthermore, addictive drugs are a commonplace method of control. 

In this milieu Senior Liator (or Liaitor) Keila Jedrik begins a war that will change Dosadi, and ultimately the ConSentiency itself forever. Jorj, having been thoroughly but narrowly briefed, arrives ignorant of what possible benefits the Dosadi experiment had been expected to yield. The saboteur and the bureaucrat join forces via ego sharing, and by 
using a hole in the contract isolating Dosadi they escape via jump gate. By further legal manoeuvring the Dosadi population itself is unleashed upon the ConSentiency for good or ill. The Gowachin, having sent McKie to Dosadi in the first place in the hopes of a solution more in keeping with their interests could be found, must deal with the consequences.

==Main characters==

===Jorj X. McKie===
Jorj X. McKie is the leading &quot;saboteur extraordinary&quot; in the Bureau of Sabotage (BuSab), an organization found in &quot;The Dosadi Experiment&quot; as well as two earlier short stories. He is described as a squat and ugly man of Pacific Islander ancestry, with green eyes and a shock of red hair. The Gowachin say they feel their bones age in his presence, because when he smiles, he bears a remarkable resemblance to their &quot;Frog god&quot;, the nearly-divine Lawgiver, Mrreg.

A born troublemaker, Jorj McKie finds BuSab to be a natural outlet for his tendencies. But McKie&#x27;s success as a BuSab agent is really the result of a formidable intelligence and an exquisite sensitivity to the traditions of other races combined with the ability to adapt to &quot;any&quot; circumstances. Sent by the agency to Dosadi as their &quot;best&quot;, he was like an infant in swaddling clothes in comparison to a people honed by fifteen generations of violence –at least initially. In less than a week he finds his bearings, and Keila Jedrik appraises him as &quot;more Dosadi than Dosadi.&quot;

His feelings of genuine love for the Caleban Fannie Mae aside (a love which is fully reciprocated), McKie never forms long-term attachments to human women; his more than fifty marriages have been strictly transactional. Nevertheless, he finds in Keila Jedrik a companion who becomes far, far more than a soul mate.

===Keila Jedrik===
Keila Jedrik is a human native of Dosadi with short, bristly black hair and icy blue eyes. She introduced a subtle flaw in the computer system governing food distribution, which eliminated her own position as &quot;Senior Liaitor&quot; (or Liator) along with the jobs of 49 other human beings. This small, dislodged pebble becomes the avalanche which leads to a full-scale race-war against the Gowachin, a crisis for which she had long prepared: Jedrik is the culmination of an eight-generation plan to break free of the God Wall enclosing Dosadi.

She captures McKie before he could fall into the hands of Dosadi&#x27;s nominal ruler, Broey, whereupon the novel chronicles the character development of these two remarkable individuals in becoming utterly joined in body, mind, and purpose.

===Broey===
Elector Broey, the Gowachin ruler of Dosadi, is slow to recognize that the race riots are the beginning of a world war, much less one orchestrated by a mid-level functionary. Such is the crisis that after only a few days cuts his human allies loose to devote all of his resources defending a narrow corridor through Chu to the Rim and to the wider world. Acknowledging the superior abilities of Jedrik, he nevertheless dispatches suicide bombers to make her inevitable victory as costly as possible. He is shocked into personally surrendering to Jedrik, however, after the God Wall Caleban turns the sky of Dosadi black in preparation for the total destruction of the planet.

Later, temporarily allied with Jedrik, Broey seizes the reins of power throughout the ConSentiency universe after the God Wall contract is cancelled. Furthermore, he is the only judge to survive the courtarena when the Dosadi affair comes to trial. In the end, however, he only succeeds in providing a single target for the &quot;ministrations&quot; of the Bureau of Sabotage under its new leader, Jorj X. McKie.

==Reception==
C. Ben Ostrander reviewed &quot;The Dosadi Experiment&quot; in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 13. Ostrander commented that &quot;The wheels-within-wheels plotting is one of the most enjoyable reading experiences any SF fan can have. I recommend this book highly.&quot;

===Awards===
&quot;The Dosadi Experiment&quot; was nominated for a Locus Award for best science fiction novel in 1978 but lost to Frederik Pohl&#x27;s novel &quot;Gateway&quot;.
