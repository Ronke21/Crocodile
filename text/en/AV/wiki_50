<text>Fort Mills (Corregidor, the Philippines) was the location of US Major General George F. Moore&#x27;s headquarters for the Philippine Department&#x27;s Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays in early World War II, and was the largest seacoast fort in the Philippines. Most of this Coast Artillery Corps fort was built 1904–1910 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers as part of the Taft program of seacoast defense. The fort was named for Brigadier General Samuel Meyers Mills Jr., Chief of Artillery 1905–1906. It was the primary location of the Battle of Corregidor in the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in 1941–42, and of the recapture of Corregidor in February 1945, both in World War II.

==Overview==
The United States acquired the Philippines as a territory as a result of the Spanish–American War in 1898. The Taft board of 1905 recommended extensive, then-modern fortifications at the entrance to Manila Bay. The islands there had been declared military reservations on 11 April 1902. Construction soon started and the forts were substantially complete by 1915 as the Coast Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays (renamed Harbor Defenses in 1925). All of them were on islands at the mouth of the bay, except Fort Wint on Grande Island in Subic Bay. As the only large island of these, Corregidor had more gun batteries than the others, along with barracks, other garrison buildings, and facilities for controlling two underwater minefields. Corregidor also had 13 miles of electric railway, an unusual feature in US forts. The forts were designed for one purpose: to prevent enemy surface vessels from entering Manila Bay or Subic Bay. They were designed before airplanes became important in war, and (except for Fort Drum) were vulnerable to air and high-angle artillery attack, being protected only by camouflage. Except for the mortar batteries, the turrets of Fort Drum, and the two guns of the 1920s Batteries Smith and Hearn, the forts&#x27; guns had restricted arcs of fire of about 170°, and could only bear on targets entering the bay from the west.

==Construction==
The initial construction on Fort Mills was largely complete by 1911 except three 3-inch gun batteries. The initial gun batteries were:

Three additional batteries of two guns each followed within a few years; Battery Keyes in 1913 and Batteries Cushing and Hanna in 1919. The 3-inch &quot;mine defense&quot; guns were intended to prevent enemy minesweepers from clearing paths through underwater minefields.

The last new armament at Fort Mills until 1940 was significant but small in quantity: Batteries Smith and Hearn, completed in 1921. These had one M1895 gun each on an M1917 long-range carriage, with an elevation of 35° and 360° of traverse, with range increased from on a disappearing carriage to . The disadvantage was that the guns were completely unprotected. This type of battery was also built at eight other harbor defense commands in CONUS, Hawaii, and Panama. In 1923 the Washington Naval Treaty prohibited additional fortifications in the Pacific, thus the Philippine forts received no further weapons until after 1936, when Japan withdrew from the treaty, rendering it void. Ironically, had these batteries been modernized, they would have been casemated, restricting them to a 180° field of fire, and would have been less useful against the Japanese on Bataan. One result of the Washington Naval Treaty was the diversion of twelve 240 mm howitzers on a ship bound for the Philippines to Hawaii, where they were placed on fixed mountings on Oahu. The total lack of mobile high-angle artillery was a major impediment to the defense of the Philippines.

Spare gun barrels were provided near some batteries, including Smith and Hearn, due to the inability to re-line used barrels except at specialized facilities in the continental United States (CONUS).

===Battery names===
The name sources for the batteries at Fort Mills were:



===Minefields===
Manila Bay and Subic Bay had Army-operated minefields as well as naval mines. These minefields were designed to stop all vessels except submarines and shallow-draft surface craft. In Manila Bay, two controlled minefields were placed, one extending west from Corregidor to La Monja Island, and the other extending north from Corregidor to the Bataan Peninsula east of Mariveles Bay. Both of these were operated from Corregidor. Also, in mid-1941 US Navy minefields of contact mines were laid between Mariveles Bay and La Monja Island, and between Corregidor and Carabao Islands, to close off the bay approaches not covered by Army mines.

On the night of 16–17 December 1941 the passenger ship SS &quot;Corregidor&quot; (formerly HMS &quot;Engadine&quot;) hit a mine and sank near Corregidor Island. The ship departed Manila that night without obtaining permission from the US Navy&#x27;s Inshore Patrol, which meant the minefield operators were not alerted that a friendly ship was departing the harbor. The minefield&#x27;s usual state in wartime was active, which meant they would detonate on contact. This probably applied to the mines in the designated ship channel as well. When the ship was spotted, some accounts state that Colonel Paul Bunker, commander of the Seaward Defenses, ordered that the minefield remain active. Due to wartime conditions, no official investigation was ever conducted, leaving many questions open. The location at which the ship sank has not been determined, for example. Accounts state that US Army officers informally told Filipino reporters that the mines were placed in safe mode immediately after the sinking. The ship was crowded with 1,200 to 1,500 persons, mostly Filipino civilians evacuating to Mindanao. 150 Philippine Army personnel and seven Americans were on board, along with several 2.95-inch mountain guns badly needed by the forces in the southern Philippines. Three PT boats (&quot;PT-32&quot;, &quot;PT-34&quot; and &quot;PT-35&quot;) picked up 282 survivors, of which seven later died.

===The Malinta Tunnel===

The main part of the Malinta Tunnel complex was built on Corregidor from 1932 to 1934, with construction continuing until the Philippines were invaded in December 1941. Most US forts of this era had only small underground facilities, and this tunnel complex was the largest in the US coastal defense system. Due to the Washington Naval Treaty&#x27;s prohibition on new fortifications, most of the complex was built without appropriated funds, using Filipino convict labor for unskilled tasks, and explosives slated for disposal. During the siege, the Malinta Tunnel proved important to the survival of the Philippine government, the military high command, the medical staff, and numerous civilians.

==Japanese conquest of the Philippines==
===Prelude===
From the late 1930s through the surrender in 1942 a number of batteries for GPF guns were built at Fort Mills. These were mobile field guns adopted by the Coast Artillery Corps for use in &quot;tractor-drawn&quot; units, such as the 92nd Coast Artillery. At least a few of these were delivered to the Philippines in 1921 with transfer of the 59th Coast Artillery to the islands. Nine batteries with emplacements for 22 guns were built. The US Army&#x27;s official history states that 19 of these weapons were on Corregidor during the final battle in 1942. Most of these batteries simply had &quot;Panama mounts&quot;, circular concrete platforms to stabilize the gun on its mobile carriage. One battery was exceptional, Battery Monja in the southwest part of Corregidor, with two emplacements. One or both of these were casemated by being built into a rock face; this proved to be crucial to the battery remaining in action during the siege. By December 1941 there were seven antiaircraft batteries totaling 28 3-inch guns on Corregidor (including one nearby on Bataan), some manned by the 60th Coast Artillery (AA) and some manned by batteries of the harbor defense regiments.

On 26 July 1941 Lieutenant General Douglas MacArthur was recalled to active duty and made the commander of U.S. Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE), which included the Philippine Scouts and the Philippine Commonwealth Army. MacArthur had been an official U.S. advisor to the Philippine forces as a Philippine Field Marshal from 1935 to 1937, and had continued this function as a civilian since his retirement from the U.S. Army at the end of that period.

===The siege begins===
The Japanese invaded northern Luzon a few days after the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 that brought the US into the war. They advanced rapidly, with other landings elsewhere, notably at Legazpi in southeast Luzon on 12 December, Davao on Mindanao on 20 December, and Lingayen Gulf on 22 December. On 26 December 1941 Manila was declared an open city, with the Philippine government and MacArthur&#x27;s headquarters evacuated to the Malinta Tunnel. Amid the evacuations, a re-inauguration ceremony for Philippine President Manuel Quezon&#x27;s second term was held just outside the tunnel on 30 December. The Japanese entered Manila on 2 January 1942. Five days later the U.S. and Philippine forces completed a fighting withdrawal to the Bataan peninsula, northwest of Corregidor, and prepared to defend it. In the northern Philippines, this left only Bataan, Corregidor, and Forts Hughes, Frank, and Drum in Allied hands. This situation had been anticipated in the prewar War Plan Orange-3, under which the forces in the Philippines were expected to hold out at the mouth of Manila Bay for six months. By that time it was anticipated that a relief expedition from the U.S. might arrive. General MacArthur had hoped to defend the Philippines more aggressively under the Rainbow Plan, and was able to get some reinforcements in the months prior to the U.S. entering the war, but this fell apart with the rapid Japanese advance in December 1941. And, with almost all of the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s battleships sunk or damaged at Pearl Harbor, and the Japanese advancing in several parts of Southeast Asia at a much greater rate than expected, no relief was organized. Although extensive guerrilla operations were conducted by Filipinos with U.S. support, U.S. forces did not return to the Philippines in strength until the invasion of Leyte Gulf in October 1944.

One aspect of MacArthur&#x27;s Rainbow Plan was the Inland Seas Project, intended to defend a shipping route to keep his forces supplied. Part of this was a buildup of Philippine Commonwealth forces, and a projected deployment of coast artillery weapons manned by them in the central Philippines. In 1940-41 eight railway guns and 24 GPF guns were delivered to the Philippines, without crews as they were to be locally manned. The 8-inch guns were sent north in December 1941 to engage the invading Japanese forces, but six of them were destroyed by air attack. One gun was eventually placed on a fixed mount as Battery RJ-43 on Corregidor in March 1942; the other may have been at Bagac, Bataan. Reportedly the Corregidor gun fired only five proof rounds, then went unused for lack of a crew until knocked off its mount by bombing or shelling. The history of the Bataan gun is unknown. Most or all of the 24 155 mm GPF guns were eventually deployed at Corregidor and/or Bataan.

===Fall of Bataan===
Although the US and Filipino forces achieved success in defending Bataan through the end of February, they had taken 50 percent casualties and were worn out and poorly supplied. Also, the British fortress of Singapore had surrendered on 15 February, and the Japanese had taken several major islands of the Dutch East Indies, essentially preventing any reinforcement of the Philippines. Philippine President Manuel Quezon, with his family and senior officials, was evacuated to the southern Philippines by the submarine on 20 February. MacArthur was ordered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to relocate to Australia to prevent his capture and to direct further operations. He departed Corregidor on 12 March 1942, initially by PT boat to Mindanao, completing his journey by air. On 20 March he made a speech with the famous phrase &quot;I shall return&quot;. He left Lieutenant General Jonathan M. Wainwright IV in a subordinate command in the Philippines, telling the key officers there that he (MacArthur) would control the Philippines from Australia. However, he neglected to inform Washington of this arrangement, and Washington intended Wainwright to be in charge. It was not until 20 March that the extent of Wainwright&#x27;s authority and degree of independence from MacArthur was clarified by a message from General George C. Marshall, the Army chief of staff.

The Japanese in Bataan received substantial reinforcements and replacements in March, including 240 mm howitzers and aircraft, and prepared for an offensive scheduled for 3 April. It started with a five-hour air and artillery bombardment that destroyed many of the Allied defensive positions and stunned the defenders; a three-day assault threw them back along much of the line. On 6 April the US and Filipino forces attempted a counterattack, which ran into a fresh Japanese attack that eventually threw the Allies further back. Over the next two days many Allied units disintegrated, and on 9 April the Allied forces on Bataan surrendered. About 2,000 stragglers made it to Corregidor, while about 78,000 became prisoners of the Japanese and were transferred to camps in northern Luzon on the Bataan Death March.

===Fall of Corregidor===
Corregidor had been bombed intermittently since 29 December 1941. Supplies on the island were short, with food and water severely rationed and the defenders correspondingly weakened. Japanese artillery bombardment of Corregidor began immediately after the fall of Bataan on 9 April. It became intense over the next few weeks as more guns were brought up, and one day&#x27;s shelling was said to equal all the bombing raids combined in damage inflicted. However, after an initial response from a 155 mm GPF battery, Lt. Gen. Wainwright prohibited counterbattery fire for three days, fearing there were wounded POWs on Bataan who might be killed. Japanese aircraft flew 614 missions, dropping 1,701 bombs totaling some 365 tons of explosive. Joining the aerial bombardment were nine howitzers, thirty-four howitzers, and 32 other artillery pieces, which pounded Corregidor day and night. It was estimated that on 4 May alone, more than 16,000 shells hit Corregidor. Forts Frank and Drum had been bombarded from the Pico de Loro hills on the Cavite shore since 6 February by a gradually increasing Japanese artillery force.

On 3 February 1942 arrived at Corregidor with 3,500 rounds of 3-inch anti-aircraft ammunition. Along with mail and important documents, &quot;Trout&quot; was loaded with 20 tons of gold and silver previously removed from banks in the Philippines before departing.

By the end of April Corregidor&#x27;s main power plant was too damaged to function most of the time. This was needed for the ammunition hoists of the disappearing gun batteries, which had gasoline-powered generators but for which fuel could not be spared. The Malinta Tunnel had its own generators, but sometimes these failed too. The bombardment by high-angle artillery and aircraft gradually destroyed the utility of almost all of Corregidor&#x27;s big guns, which had no overhead protection except for magazines and generators. The mortars of Battery Geary and Battery Way fared better until near the end; their battery arrangement did not require electric power for ammunition hoists. However, Battery Way at least had been out of service for years; only three mortars were restored to service and these not until 28 April, and by 5 May two of these were out of action. There was also a shortage of high explosive shells, and adapting the armor piercing shells for instantaneous detonation was time-consuming at only 25 shells per day. On 2 May a 240 mm shell penetrated one of Battery Geary&#x27;s magazines; the resulting explosion put the entire battery out of action, blowing one mortar from the battery and embedding another mortar entirely inside another magazine. Among the harbor forts, only Fort Drum&#x27;s turrets proved impregnable to attack; they remained in action until the surrender despite damage to other parts of the fort.

On the night of 4 May a submarine returning to Australia from patrol evacuated 25 persons. Among the passengers were Colonel Constant Irwin, who carried a complete roster of all Army, Navy, and Marine personnel still alive; Col. Royal G. Jenks, a finance officer, with financial accounts; Col. Milton A. Hill, the inspector general, 3 other Army and 6 Navy officers, and about 13 nurses. Included in the cargo sent from Corregidor were several bags of mail, the last to go out of the Philippines, and &quot;many USAFFE and USFIP records and orders&quot;.

The bombardment increased in intensity through 5 May, and the Japanese landed that night. Their initial landing was near the east end of the island, north of Kindley Field, the airstrip. This was somewhat east of their objective, which was between Infantry Point and Cavalry Point, due to a miscalculation of the current. The 4th Marine Regiment coordinated the ground forces, which included many soldiers and sailors from support units untrained in ground combat, many of them escapees from Bataan. Several coast artillery and antiaircraft batteries were abandoned to free their crews as ground forces. Of 229 officers and 3,770 enlisted men attached to the regiment, only around 1,500 were US Marines. The Japanese landed on the night of 5 May about 2300, with 75 mm and 37 mm guns deployed for beach defense reportedly causing them heavy casualties. At least three of the 155 mm guns were also still in action. However, by 0130 the Japanese captured Battery Denver, turning back three Allied counterattacks by 0400. At dawn, around 0440, more invasion barges were spotted and fire support from Fort Drum&#x27;s 14-inch (356 mm) guns was requested. Although smoke obscured the barges, Fort Drum was directed to fire &quot;anywhere between you and Cabcaben&quot; (in Bataan), and over 100 rounds were fired on the invasion route. By 1000 the Japanese were firmly lodged on the island. With 600-800 Allied troops killed and over 1,000 wounded, no reserves were left. No one was available to evacuate the wounded, and most of those who attempted to walk to the Malinta Tunnel were either further wounded or killed. General Wainwright felt certain that further Japanese troops would land in the night and seize the Malinta Tunnel, where they might massacre the wounded and noncombatants. He decided to sacrifice one day of freedom to save several thousand lives. After giving orders to his forces to destroy their weapons to prevent their use by the enemy, he surrendered.

Although all the harbor forts were included in the surrender, General Wainwright made every effort to avoid surrendering the troops in the southern Philippines. He sent an order placing them directly under MacArthur just before surrendering Corregidor. However, the Japanese insisted that all US and Filipino forces in the islands be included, and stated they would not cease offensive operations until that took place. Wainwright believed this meant they might start executing the 10,000 or so prisoners from Corregidor and the other forts, so he ordered the surrender of all forces. The units in the south were in much better positions for both supplies and continued resistance than those at Bataan or Corregidor were, and their commanders believed Wainwright&#x27;s surrender orders were made under duress. It was not until 9 June that the Japanese accepted that all of the islands had surrendered. Some units never did surrender, and became nuclei for guerrilla operations that continued until the Japanese were mostly killed or captured in early 1945, following MacArthur&#x27;s return to the Philippines in force in October 1944.

The conquest of the Philippines by Japan is often considered the worst military defeat in United States history. About 23,000 American military personnel were killed or captured, while Filipino soldiers killed or captured totaled around 100,000.

The Philippines, Burma, and the Dutch East Indies were the last major territories the Japanese invaded in World War II, all captured in early 1942. As Corregidor surrendered, the Battle of the Coral Sea was in progress, turning back a Japanese attempt to seize Port Moresby, New Guinea by sea. By the final surrender on 9 June, the Battle of Midway was over, blunting Japan&#x27;s naval strength with the loss of four large aircraft carriers and hundreds of skilled pilots. Both of these victories were costly to the US Navy as well, with two aircraft carriers lost, but the United States could replace their ships and train more pilots, and Japan, for the most part, could not do so adequately.

==Recapture of Corregidor==


US forces returned to the Philippines in a major invasion at Leyte beginning on 20 October 1944, with General MacArthur soon declaring &quot;I have returned&quot;. The Imperial Japanese Navy attacked the invasion fleet on 23–26 October in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the largest naval battle of the war, but were repulsed with heavy losses. By early February 1945 much of the Manila area and part of Bataan had been secured. Corregidor was the biggest obstacle to reopening Manila Bay to shipping. A risky operation to recapture the island via near-simultaneous airborne and amphibious assault was devised. The invasion was set for 16 February. Air bombardment began on 22 January, and naval bombardment on 13 February. The easiest place for a parachute drop on the island was Kindley Field, the disused airstrip. However, this would put the paratroops in an exposed position, and planners decided to immediately seize the island&#x27;s high ground with a drop on Topside, the western part of the island. Only two barely-adequate drop zones were available: the parade ground and the former golf course. Each plane would have to make two or three passes to unload all of the paratroopers and equipment on these small areas. The drop would also have to be divided into two lifts, separated by at least four hours. Each lift could carry a reinforced battalion, and another drop was planned for the 17th to deliver the remainder of the regimental combat team. The overall plan was for the first airborne assault at 0830, the amphibious landing at 1030, and the second airborne lift at 1215. The airborne force was the 503rd Parachute Regimental Combat Team of Lieutenant Colonel George M. Jones. The 503rd PRCT drop force included the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment, Co. C, 161st Airborne Engineer Battalion, and elements of the 462nd Parachute Field Artillery Battalion with 75 mm pack howitzers. They were airlifted by C-47 aircraft of the 317th Troop Carrier Group. The amphibious assault was by the reinforced 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry Regiment of the 24th Infantry Division, carried by Landing Craft Mechanized (LCMs) of the 592nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment of the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade. Japanese forces were estimated at 850. There were actually about 5,000 Japanese military personnel on the island, primarily naval forces under Japanese Navy Captain Akira Itagaki. Surprisingly, the low initial estimate of Japanese strength did not become a major problem.

The airborne assault began on schedule at 0833 on 16 February 1945. It achieved surprise and Japanese resistance was light. However, a higher drop altitude and stronger winds than planned, combined with the small drop zones, resulted in a 25 percent injury rate. Many troops landed outside the drop zones in wooded or rocky areas, or on ruined buildings and gun batteries. One group of paratroopers landed on an observation post that included the Japanese commander, and killed him. The amphibious assault at 1030 on the south shore of Bottomside at San Jose was also successful, despite encountering land mines. The surface of Malinta Hill was captured in half an hour, although numerous Japanese remained in the Malinta Tunnel below it. The second paratroop lift dropped at 1240, with a much lower injury rate than the first lift. However, due to the success of the attack, the commander of the 503rd decided to cancel the drop scheduled for the 17th, and bring the remaining paratroops in by sea. The combined forces on Corregidor became known as &quot;Rock Force&quot;.

As well as the force in the Malinta Tunnel, the Japanese were dug in on various parts of the island, occupying numerous tunnels and small bunkers. Many of these were south and west of Topside. Rock Force cleared the bunkers in the typical fashion of the war in the Pacific: air-delivered napalm bombs where needed, followed by assaults with flamethrowers and white phosphorus grenades among other weapons. The Japanese would sometimes reoccupy these positions at night. In some cases demolition charges were used to entomb the Japanese in their bunkers and tunnels. The Japanese occasionally made banzai charges at this point in the war, which mainly succeeded in increasing their own casualties. There were attempts made to persuade the Japanese to surrender, but few did so. On at least three occasions the Japanese were able to detonate ammunition caches near American troops, usually followed by an attack, though these tactics killed more Japanese than Americans. The most spectacular of these was the detonation of a large amount of explosives in the Malinta Tunnel on the night of 21 February. Apparently the intention was to shock the Americans on and near Malinta Hill and allow the force in the tunnel to escape eastward to the island&#x27;s tail. However, it appeared that the explosion was larger than intended, though perhaps several hundred Japanese out of an estimated 2,000 in the tunnel were able to join their main force on the tail. Two nights later more explosions shook Malinta Hill, probably the suicide of its remaining defenders. By this time the entire western part of the island was cleared and preparations made to clear the tail area. On 24 February the 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry was relieved by the 2nd Battalion, 151st Infantry of the 38th Infantry Division. At 1100 on 26 February the Japanese apparently decided to finish themselves and take some Americans with them, setting off an ammunition-filled bunker at Monkey Point. Perhaps 200 Japanese were killed outright, along with 50 Americans killed and 150 wounded. Within a few hours the only Japanese left alive were in a few caves along the island&#x27;s waterline, who were mopped up in a few days.

==Corregidor&#x27;s flags==

===Flag re-hoisted during bombardment===
On 16 April 1942, during an intense Japanese artillery bombardment, the 100-foot flagpole&#x27;s halyard was severed and the flag began to come down. Four men of Battery B, 60th Coast Artillery (AA), including Captain Arthur E. Huff, left shelter to catch the flag before it reached the ground. They repaired the halyard, re-raised the flag, and returned to shelter. Each of them received the Silver Star.

===Pieces of flag preserved===
Just before surrendering on 6 May 1942, Colonel Paul Bunker, commander of the 59th Coast Artillery and the Seaward Defenses, followed General Wainwright&#x27;s orders to haul down and burn Corregidor&#x27;s flag, to avoid turning it over to the Japanese, and run up the white flag. He kept a piece of the American flag that he sewed into his clothing.

On 10 June 1942, in the Bilibid Prison hospital, Manila, Bunker sent for Colonel Delbert Ausmus, cut the flag remnant into two pieces and gave one of the pieces to Ausmus. He told Colonel Ausmus he did not expect to survive the prison camp and that it was Ausmus&#x27; duty to take his piece of the flag to the Secretary of War. Ausmus concealed the remnant in his shirt cuff, and shortly after the war ended, Ausmus delivered it to Secretary Patterson. In November 1945, Ausmus described the circumstances under which he received the remnant from Bunker:&quot;He was taken to Bilibid prison in Manila and came down with pneumonia. While he was in the hospital Col. Paul D. Bunker of Taunton, Mass., was brought in suffering from seriously infected blisters on his feet and blood poisoning in one leg. On June 10, Bunker watching carefully &#x27;to see that there were no Japs near,&#x27; swore him to secrecy, Ausmus continued, and &#x27;said he wanted to turn something over to me to deliver to the Secretary of War.&#x27; From beneath a false patch set into the left pocket of his shirt Bunker took a bit of red cloth. Solemnly he gave Ausmus part of it and put the rest back.&quot;

On 16 March 1943, Colonel Bunker died in a Japanese prison camp in Karenko, Taiwan. While giving one piece of the flag to Ausmus, he held onto another piece until the time of his death. General Wainwright later recalled the circumstances of Bunker&#x27;s death in the prison camp, still holding onto the remnant: &quot;He must have suffered ... constant pain of hunger ... I sat with him for a part of the last two hours of his life ... [He was] cremated in the rags in which he had carefully sewn a bit of the American flag he had pulled down in Corregidor.&quot;

Ausmus did deliver it to the Secretary of War who unveiled it during a speech on the event of Flag Day in June 1946. The remnant of the U.S. flag from Corregidor saved by Bunker and Ausmus is on display in the West Point museum.

===Flag raised again on Corregidor===
On 2 March 1945, with Corregidor secured, a flag-raising ceremony with General MacArthur present was held at Topside. With a new flag raised, Colonel Jones of the 503rd Parachute Infantry saluted the general and said simply, &quot;Sir, I present to you Fortress Corregidor.&quot;

==Present==
The ruins of Fort Mills are impressive, and feature the largest concentration of surviving US coast defense guns in the world. Including spare barrels, twelve guns, ten mortars, three guns, one gun, and five guns are on the island.

<text>The Philippine Division, or from 1944–1947 the 12th Infantry Division, was the core U.S. infantry division of the United States Army&#x27;s Philippine Department before and during World War II. 

The division was organized in April 1922 and primarily consisted of United States Army officers and Filipino enlisted men. It primary purpose was to defend the Philippines from invasion. When the Philippine Army was established in 1935, it provided a potential candidate pool of Filipinos with military experience.

On 31 July 1941, the division consisted of 10,473 troops, mostly enlisted Filipinos, known as the Philippine Scouts who formed the 45th and 57th US Infantry Regiments. All of the division&#x27;s enlisted men, with the exception of the 31st Infantry Regiment, and various military police and headquarters troops, were Philippine Scouts.

In October 1941, as part of the U.S. Army Forces Far East, plans were made to &quot;triangularize&quot; the division. The 34th Infantry was detached from the 8th Infantry Division and moved to a port of embarkation in December 1941, along with two battalions of 105mm field artillery. The Philippine Division was to have two complete U.S. regimental combat teams in place by January 1942 to provide General Douglas MacArthur with a modern, trained mobile reaction force, while freeing up Philippine Scouts for rounding out other units. The outbreak of war in December 1941, however, isolated the Philippines and prevented implementation of the plan.

==History==

The Philippine Division was constituted in the Regular Army on 7 December 1921 and activated at Fort William McKinley, Philippine Islands, on 10 April 1922. The division was the primary ground force of the Philippine Department and was given the mission of defending the Philippine archipelago from potential invaders. The division began organizing around the nucleus of the 23rd Infantry Brigade (consisting of the 45th and 57th Infantry Regiments), which was activated on 15 December 1921. Additionally, the 31st Infantry, the 1st Battalion, 24th Field Artillery, the 1st Battalion, 14th Engineers, and several of the companies in the division special troops were already organized and integrated into the division. The division continued to receive and activate units throughout 1922, adding HHC, 24th Infantry Brigade; HHC, 12th Field Artillery Brigade, Headquarters, Philippine Division Quartermaster Train, and several of the train’s elements, and the 12th Motorcycle Company by April. The 15th Infantry Regiment was assigned to the division in July 1922, however, only the 1st Battalion was stationed in the Philippines. The remainder of the regiment was posted to the American Barracks in Tientsin, China, and attached to Headquarters, American Forces in China. By the end of 1922, the 12th Medical Regiment was activated and rounded out the division’s structure. The Philippine Division was forced to inactivate several units over the interwar years due to budget decreases, starting with the 12th Field Artillery Brigade headquarters in 1922, followed by the 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry in 1929, and the 24th Infantry Brigade headquarters in 1930. With the relief of the 31st Infantry from the division in 1931, the 24th Infantry Brigade was redesignated as a Philippine Scout (PS) organization and the 43rd and 44th Infantry Regiments (PS) were added to the brigade as inactive units. Additionally, the inactive 25th Field Artillery (PS) was relieved and the 23rd Field Artillery (PS) replaced it as the division’s other indirect fire regiment, also in an inactive status. 

Like other overseas divisions at the time, the Philippine Division was fortunate in that it was located on the terrain on which it would fight if the archipelago was ever invaded. Therefore, the training in which it participated tended to be more realistic and provided a more focused military environment. The environment helped to develop many of the Army officers who would lead the United States to victory in World War II. Due to the archipelago’s seasonal weather patterns, the division conducted individual training, marksmanship training, and schools for specialists during the rainy months of June–August. The drier months of September–November were devoted to officer and noncommissioned officer schools, garrison work details, inspections, and maneuver preparation. The late part of the year began with small unit training, reconnaissance of the maneuver areas for the next major department exercise, and exercising transportation and communications systems. These activities were followed by the repair and construction of roads leading to and on the peninsula of Bataan. The preparations finally culminated in the large-scale division and department maneuvers in January and February. The maneuvers occasionally included large surface squadrons from the Navy as well as amphibious invasion forces provided by the US Marine Corps. 

In 1933, the Philippine Division began to train in earnest to prepare for an invasion, which Army planners believed would come at the beaches of Lingayen. The January 1934 maneuver was actually little more than a thorough reconnaissance of the Bataan peninsula with particular emphasis on the Miraveles Mountains. This reconnaissance revealed the poor internal road net of the peninsula, and the 14th Engineers and 23rd Field Artillery were put to work improving the trails and roads. The 1935 maneuver was again held on Bataan. This exercise focused on determining the enemy avenues of approach and selecting defensive positions to block those approaches. The 1936 maneuver came uncannily close to rehearsing what would occur 6 years later when the Japanese invaded. The 26th Cavalry, with the 23rd Field Artillery in support, was sent to scout the Lingayan landing areas and report movements of the invasion force, while the Philippine Division concentrated near Fort Stotsenburg. As the enemy forced the cavalry back, the Philippine Division fought a delaying action, fell back onto Bataan to defend the Olongopo Road, and then centered its defense on the Miraveles Mountains where the exercise ended.

The next change to the division’s structure came in 1936 with the reorganization of the Quartermaster Train into the 12th Quartermaster Regiment. Shortly before Pearl Harbor, the 31st Infantry was reassigned to the Philippine Division, and the 1st Battalions of the 43rd Infantry and the 23rd Field Artillery were activated. Interestingly, the 24th Infantry Brigade was still assigned as an inactive unit; therefore, the Philippine Division was the only Regular Army infantry division that retained the “square” structure (at least on paper) on entry into World War II. The location of the division headquarters on 7 December 1941 was Fort William McKinley.

==Combat chronicle==

*Units of the Philippine Division were on security missions at Manila, Fort William McKinley, and Bataan prior to the declaration of war in the Pacific, 8 December 1941. After undergoing 2 days of bombings, the Division moved into the field to cover the withdrawal of troops to Bataan and to resist the enemy in the Subic Bay area. From 11 December 1941 to 23 December 1941, positions were organized and strengthened and on 23 December 1941 the Division was assigned to the Bataan Defense Forces. While the 31st Infantry Regiment moved to the vicinity of Zig Zag Pass to cover the flanks of troops withdrawing from central and southern Luzon, 30 December 1941, the rest of the Division organized the main and reserve positions on Bataan. The 31st Infantry Regiment moved to a defensive position on the west side of the Olongapo Road near Layac Junction, 5 January 1942. This junction was lost on 6 January 1942, but the withdrawal to Bataan had been successfully concluded.
*The Division was placed in reserve from 7 January 1942 to 14 January 1942. This period was largely one of reconnaissance and development by the Japanese in preparation for their attack on the main battle position on the Abucay line. Elements repulsed night attacks near Abucay on 10 January 1942 – 12 January 1942, and other elements of the Division counterattacked on 16 January 1942. Strong offensive and defensive action was not able to prevent enemy penetrations and the Division withdrew to the Reserve Battle Position in the Pilar – Bagac area, 2 February 1942. Until the latter part of March the enemy, made cautious by heavy losses, engaged in patrols and limited local attacks, and after a general retirement, 24 March 1942, did not undertake any serious activity on this front until 28 March 1942. During this period elements of the Division were shifted to assist in the defense of other sectors. The enemy attack on 28 March struck at a division weakened by malnutrition, sickness, and prolonged exposure to combat. The Division, no longer operating as a coordinated unit, was unable to counterattack against heavy enemy assaults.
*On 8 April 1942, the 57th Infantry Regiment and the 31st Infantry Regiment were lost near the Alangan River, and the 45th Infantry Regiment surrendered, 10 April 1942.

The division was redesignated on 6 April 1946 as the 12th Infantry Division, inactivated 30 April 1947, and disbanded on 23 March 1953.

==Miscellaneous==
The regimental colors of the 12th Quartermaster Regiment (PS) were given to an Army nurse (one of the &quot;Angels of Bataan and Corregidor&quot;) by the regimental commander. Upon her capture she told the Japanese that it was &quot;only a shawl&quot; and kept it safe throughout more than three years of captivity. Today, the colors are on display at the U.S. Army Quartermaster Museum, Fort Gregg-Adams, Virginia.

<doc id="161856" wikidata="Q187082" url="?curid=161856" title="Ovulation">
<text>Ovulation is an important part of the menstrual cycle in female vertebrates where the egg cells are released from the ovaries as part of the ovarian cycle. In female humans ovulation typically occurs near the midpoint in the menstrual cycle and after the follicular phase. Ovulation is stimulated by an increase in luteinizing hormone (LH). The ovarian follicles rupture and release the secondary oocyte ovarian cells. 

After ovulation, during the luteal phase, the egg will be available to be fertilized by sperm. If it is not, it will break down in less than a day. Meanwhile, the uterine lining (endometrium) continues to thicken to be able to receive a fertilized egg. If no conception occurs, the uterine lining will eventually break down and be shed from the body via the vagina during menstruation.

Some people choose to track ovulation in order to improve or aid becoming pregnant by timing intercourse with the their ovulation. The signs of ovulation may include cervical mucus changes, mild cramping in the abdominal area, and a small rise in basal body temperature. Medication is also sometimes required by those experiencing infertility to induce ovulation.

== Process ==

Ovulation occurs about midway through the menstrual cycle, after the follicular phase. The days in which a woman is most fertile can be calculated based on the date of the last menstrual period and the length of a typical menstrual cycle. The few days surrounding ovulation (from approximately days 10 to 18 of a 28-day cycle), constitute the most fertile phase. The time from the beginning of the last menstrual period (LMP) until ovulation is, on average, 14.6 days, but with substantial variation among females and between cycles in any single female, with an overall 95% prediction interval of 8.2 to 20.5 days.

The process of ovulation is controlled by the hypothalamus of the brain and through the release of hormones secreted in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). In the preovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle, the ovarian follicle will undergo a series of transformations called cumulus expansion, which is stimulated by FSH. After this is done, a hole called the stigma will form in the follicle, and the secondary oocyte will leave the follicle through this hole. Ovulation is triggered by a spike in the amount of FSH and LH released from the pituitary gland. During the luteal (post-ovulatory) phase, the secondary oocyte will travel through the fallopian tubes toward the uterus. If fertilized by a sperm, the fertilized secondary oocyte or ovum may implant there 6–12 days later.

=== Follicular phase ===
The follicular phase (or proliferative phase) is the phase of the menstrual cycle during which the ovarian follicles mature. The follicular phase lasts from the beginning of menstruation to the start of ovulation.

For ovulation to be successful, the ovum must be supported by the corona radiata and cumulus oophorous granulosa cells. The latter undergo a period of proliferation and mucification known as cumulus expansion. Mucification is the secretion of a hyaluronic acid-rich cocktail that disperses and gathers the cumulus cell network in a sticky matrix around the ovum. This network stays with the ovum after ovulation and has been shown to be necessary for fertilization.

=== Ovulation ===

Estrogen levels peak towards the end of the follicular phase, around 12 and 24 hours. This, by positive feedback, causes a surge in levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This lasts from 24 to 36 hours, and results in the rupture of the ovarian follicles, causing the oocyte to be released from the ovary.

Through a signal transduction cascade initiated by LH, which activates the pro-inflammatory genes through cAMP secondary messenger, proteolytic enzymes are secreted by the follicle that degrade the follicular tissue at the site of the blister, forming a hole called the &quot;stigma&quot;. The secondary oocyte leaves the ruptured follicle and moves out into the peritoneal cavity through the stigma, where it is caught by the fimbriae at the end of the fallopian tube. After entering the fallopian tube, the oocyte is pushed along by cilia, beginning its journey toward the uterus.

By this time, the oocyte has completed meiosis I, yielding two cells: the larger secondary oocyte that contains all of the cytoplasmic material and a smaller, inactive first polar body. Meiosis II follows at once but will be arrested in the metaphase and will so remain until fertilization. The spindle apparatus of the second meiotic division appears at the time of ovulation. If no fertilization occurs, the oocyte will degenerate between 12 and 24 hours after ovulation. Approximately 1–2% of ovulations release more than one oocyte. This tendency increases with maternal age. Fertilization of two different oocytes by two different spermatozoa results in fraternal twins.

The precise moment of ovulation was captured on film for the first time in 2008, coincidentally, during a routine hysterectomy procedure. According to the attending gynecologist, the ovum&#x27;s emergence and subsequent release from the ovarian follicle occurred within a 15-minute timeframe. 

=== Luteal phase ===
The follicle proper has met the end of its lifespan. Without the oocyte, the follicle folds inward on itself, transforming into the corpus luteum (pl. corpora lutea), a steroidogenic cluster of cells that produces estrogen and progesterone. These hormones induce the endometrial glands to begin production of the proliferative endometrium and later into secretory endometrium, the site of embryonic growth if implantation occurs. The action of progesterone increases basal body temperature by one-quarter to one-half degree Celsius (one-half to one degree Fahrenheit). The corpus luteum continues this paracrine action for the remainder of the menstrual cycle, maintaining the endometrium, before disintegrating into scar tissue during menses.

==Clinical presentation==

The start of ovulation may be detected by signs that are not readily discernible other than to the ovulating female herself, thus humans are said to have a concealed ovulation. In many animal species there are distinctive signals indicating the period when the female is fertile. Several explanations have been proposed to explain concealed ovulation in humans.

Females near ovulation experience changes in the cervical mucus, and in basal body temperature. Furthermore, many females experience secondary fertility signs including Mittelschmerz (pain associated with ovulation) and a heightened sense of smell, and can sense the precise moment of ovulation. However, midcycle pain may also not be due to Mittelschmerz, but due to other factors such as cysts, endometriosis, sexually transmitted infections, or an ectopic pregnancy. Other possible signs of ovulation include tender breasts, bloating, and cramps, although these symptoms are not a guarantee that ovulation is taking place.

Many females experience heightened sexual desire in the several days immediately before ovulation. One study concluded that females subtly improve their facial attractiveness during ovulation.
Symptoms related to the onset of ovulation, the moment of ovulation and the body&#x27;s process of beginning and ending the menstrual cycle vary in intensity with each female but are fundamentally the same. The charting of such symptoms — primarily basal body temperature, mittelschmerz and cervical position — is referred to as the sympto-thermal method of fertility awareness, which allow auto-diagnosis by a female of her state of ovulation. Once training has been given by a suitable authority, fertility charts can be completed on a cycle-by-cycle basis to show ovulation. This gives the possibility of using the data to predict fertility for natural contraception and pregnancy planning.

Urine levels of the hormone pregnanediol 3-glucuronide of over 5 μg/mL has been used to confirm ovulation. This test has a 100% specificity over 107 women.

== Disorders ==
Disorders of ovulation, also known as ovulatory disorders are classified as menstrual disorders and include oligoovulation (infrequent or irregular ovulation) and anovulation (absence of ovulation):

* Oligoovulation is infrequent or irregular ovulation (usually defined as cycles of greater than 36 days or fewer than 8 cycles a year)
* Anovulation is absence of ovulation when it would be normally expected (in a post-menarchal, premenopausal female). Anovulation usually manifests itself as irregularity of menstrual periods, that is, unpredictable variability of intervals, duration, or bleeding. Anovulation can also cause cessation of periods (secondary amenorrhea) or excessive bleeding (dysfunctional uterine bleeding).

The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed the following classification of ovulatory disorders:

* WHO group I: Hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis failure
* WHO group II: Hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis dysfunction. WHO group II is the most common cause of ovulatory disorders, and the most common causative member is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
* WHO group III: Ovarian failure
* WHO group IV: Hyperprolactinemia

Menstrual disorders can often indicate ovulatory disorder.

==Ovulation induction==

Ovulation induction is a promising assisted reproductive technology for patients with conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and oligomenorrhea. It is also used in in vitro fertilization to make the follicles mature before egg retrieval. Usually, ovarian stimulation is used in conjunction with ovulation induction to stimulate the formation of multiple oocytes. Some sources include ovulation induction in the definition of &quot;ovarian stimulation&quot;.

A low dose of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) may be injected after completed ovarian stimulation. Ovulation will occur between 24 and 36 hours after the HCG injection.

By contrast, induced ovulation in some animal species occurs naturally, ovulation can be stimulated by coitus.

==Ovulation suppression==
Combined hormonal contraceptives inhibit follicular development and prevent ovulation as a primary mechanism of action. The &quot;ovulation-inhibiting dose&quot; (OID) of an estrogen or progestogen refers to the dose required to consistently inhibit ovulation in women. Ovulation inhibition is an antigonadotropic effect and is mediated by inhibition of the secretion of the gonadotropins, LH and FSH, from the pituitary gland.

In assisted reproductive technology including in vitro fertilization, cycles where a transvaginal oocyte retrieval is planned generally necessitates ovulation suppression, because it is not practically feasible to collect oocytes after ovulation. For this purpose, ovulation can be suppressed by either a GnRH agonist or a GnRH antagonist, with different protocols depending on which substance is used. 

== Fertility and timing of ovulation ==
Most women who are able to conceive are fertile for an estimated five days before ovulation and one day after ovulation. There is some evidence that for couples who have been trying to conceive a child for less than 12 months, and the female is under 40 years old, practicing timed intercourse (timing intercourse with ovulation using urine tests that predict ovulation) may help improve the rate of pregnancy and live births. The role that stress plays in ovulation, fertility, and understanding the biological basis for stress-induced anovulation and the role of cortisol is not entirely clear.

<text>For the vowel shift that occurred in Early Modern English, see Great Vowel Shift.

A vowel shift is a systematic sound change in the pronunciation of the vowel sounds of a language.

The best-known example in the English language is the Great Vowel Shift, which began in the 15th century. The Greek language also underwent a vowel shift near the beginning of the Common Era, which included iotacism. Among the Semitic languages, the Canaanite languages underwent a shift in which Proto-Semitic *ā became ō in Proto-Canaanite (a language likely very similar to Biblical Hebrew).

A vowel shift can involve a merger of two previously different sounds, or it can be a chain shift.

==US examples==
One of the several major vowel shifts that is currently underway in the US is the Northern Cities Vowel Shift. This change pattern is characterized by the longer and lower vowels moving forward and upward, while the shorter vowels move downward and backward. This vowel rotation, for example, is noticeable as the vowel sound in &quot;coffee&quot; is moving toward the vowel in &quot;father&quot;. While there are undoubtedly several other change patterns that define the shift in the Northern Cities, they are diffusing throughout the North in a unique manner, and are inherently different from dialect shifts taking place in other regions.

In addition to the Northern Cities Vowel Shift, the dialect change patterns that are taking place in the South also indicate undeniable pronunciation changes in the region. In contrast to the changes in the North, however, the Southern Cities Vowel Shift is characterized by the shorter, front vowels moving upward and adopting the characteristics of traditionally longer vowels. To exemplify this Southern vowel change, the vowel in the word &quot;bed&quot; is commonly used, as the &quot;e&quot; moves upward and gains a glide and causes the word to be pronounced more like &quot;bayd&quot;.

=== California English Vowel Shift ===
California Vowel Shift (CVS) has several identifying features. These include the low back vowel mergers of words such as bought and bot, fronting of back vowels /oʊ/ as in coat and /ʊ/ in nook or look, as well as that which is found in words such as loot or hoot. Another identifying feature of CVS is the raising or backing of the vowel /æ/ such as that found in cat, depending on its linguistic environment and whether it is pre-nasal or not. Since California is such a large state, and home to millions of people from diverse ethnic origins and backgrounds, California has seen vowel shifts within its own borders, allowing linguists to see phonological differences between Northern, Southern and Bay Area regions of California. While linguists recognize that not all native Californians have shifted their vowels to these placements within their speech acts, it is prevalent enough to recognize the chain shift that is occurring in the largest Western state.

==== Northern California Vowel Shift ====
In Northern California, there is a chain vowel shift occurring. Short front vowels that used to be higher are shifting to lower vowel spaces in native Northern California speech acts involving the vowels /i/, /ɛ/ and /æ/. Additionally, Northern California speech acts are centralizing the sound that occurs in words such as boat (/oʊ/). These shifts in vowel shortening and centralization, while not entirely unique to the region of Northern California natives, does represent the most obvious changes that are occurring within the area in regards to native speech acts.

==== Bay Area Vowel Shift ====
The region of California that includes the Silicon Valley and the populous cities of San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose utilizes the same speech vowel shifts as their native Northern California neighbors in regards to vowel shortening and centralization of the diphthong in words such as boat or coat. However, this area is uniquely influenced by the acoustic accouterments associated with the gay identity which include fronting of back vowels and merging vowel sounds found in words such as cot and caught. Native Bay Area residents tend to have a more intensive vowel shift in regards to the components that comprise CVS. These shifts include changes in voice and intonation.

=== Chicano English ===
Due to the increasing migration from multiple Latin American countries, especially from its southern neighbor Mexico, California is influenced in speech patterns and speech acts from this population. Changes in native California speech due to this influence include a shift from /ɪŋ/ to /iŋ/ in California English. These changes are most obvious in areas with large Latin American communities.

==Canadian Shift==
===Lowering of vowels and chain shifts===
The Canadian Vowel Shift can be described to have a lot of systematic changes, however one of the main ones can be found in the lowering of /ɪ/, /ɛ/, /æ/. In the early stages of the Canadian shift there is a stabilizing in the retraction of the vowel /æ/. The first reported case of the vowels /ɪ/, /ɛ/, and /æ/ in Canadian English was involved in a chain shift, which can be described as the lowering of the front lax vowels over time.

===Canadian Raising===
There is another characteristic found in Canadian English called Canadian Raising. This feature includes the vowel diphthongs onsets of /aj/ and /aw/ raise to mid vowels when they precede voiceless obstruents (the sounds /p/, /t/, /k/, /s/, and /f/). Canadian pronunciation of &quot;about&quot; often sounds like &quot;aboot&quot;, pronunciation of /aw/ is articulated with the tongue in a low position, and because it raises to a mid position in Canadian English when the vowel precedes the voiceless obstruents listed above. Speakers of other varieties of English will immediately detect the vowel raising, but will sometimes think that the vowel has raised farther than it actually does, all the way to /u/. The raised vowels /aɪ/ typically raises [ɐɪ], while the raised variant of /aʊ/ differs by dialects in Canada, with [ɐʊ~ʌʊ] more common in Western Canada and a fronted variant [əʊ~ɛʊ] is mostly heard in Central Canada. The open vowel component of the diphthongs changes to a mid vowel ([ʌ], [ɐ], [ɛ] or [ə]).

==Standard Southern British Shift==

In recent decades, Standard Southern British (SSB) has undergone an &quot;anti-clockwise&quot; vowel shift. The front vowels are lower ([e] has lowered to [ɛ] and [æ] to [a]), the starting vowel of the /aɪ/ diphthong is backer (from [a] to [ɑ] or [ʌ]), back vowels are higher ([ɒ] has raised to [ɔ] and [ɔː] to [oː]) and [uː] has fronted and diphthongized to [ʉw].

<text>Epiphanius of Constantinople (also &quot;Epiphanios&quot;; ; died 5 June 535) was the patriarch of Constantinople from 25 February 520 to 5 June 535, succeeding John Cappadocia.

== Biography ==
The Byzantine Empire experienced a period of significant growth and success due to the military victories achieved by its generals, Belisarius and Narses. As part of the empire&#x27;s religious policies, efforts were made to suppress idolatry, leading to the burning of pagan books, destruction of images, and imprisonment and flogging of adherents of the old religion. During the patriarchate of Epiphanius in Constantinople, Emperor Justinian I demonstrated his strong commitment to church affairs through the introduction of laws regulating episcopal elections and duties. These enactments, along with the compliance of Epiphanius and his clergy, indicate the absence of exclusive clerical legislation for spiritual matters at that time.

Epiphanius initially held the position of overseeing the catechumens in Constantinople. In 519, a year prior to his election, he was sent, along with John Cappadocia and count Licinius, to Macedonia to collect documents known as &quot;libellos&quot; or subscriptions from those seeking reunification with the Catholic Church, upon the request of Dorotheus, bishop of Thessalonica&#x27;s apocrisiarius.

On 25 February 520, Epiphanius was elected bishop by Emperor Justin I, with the consent of bishops, monks, and the people. In a letter from the synod of Constantinople to Pope Hormisdas, Epiphanius is described as someone who held the correct faith and exhibited a fatherly concern for orphans.

Epiphanius accepted the peace conditions previously established between the East and West by his predecessor, Patriarch John Cappadocia, and Pope Hormisdas, and ratified them at a council held in Constantinople. At the same council, he also affirmed the decrees of Chalcedon. Antipope Dioscorus, the representative of Pope Hormisdas in Constantinople, noted Epiphanius&#x27;s promising words but remained uncertain about his ability to fulfill them, as he had not yet requested communion with the pope. Four letters from Epiphanius to Hormisdas have survived, in which he informs the pope of his election, sends him his creed, and declares his condemnation of those whose names the pope had forbidden to be mentioned in the diptychs.

Epiphanius adhered to the symbols of Nicaea, the decrees of Ephesus, Constantinople, and Chalcedon, as well as the letters of Pope Leo I in defense of the faith. Accompanying his second letter to the pope were several gifts, including a gold chalice adorned with precious stones, a gold patina, a silver chalice, and two silk veils, which he presented to the Roman church. In his effort to ensure widespread peace, he advised the pope to show leniency in removing the names of former bishops from the diptychs. His excuse for the bishops of Pontus, Asia, and the East was expressed in eloquent language. The responses from Hormisdas can be found in the Acts of the Council of Constantinople held under Menas of Constantinople, where he expresses trust in Epiphanius&#x27;s prudence and experience and recommends leniency towards those who are returning while advocating for severity towards the obstinate. Epiphanius was tasked with finalizing the reunification process himself.

The strict measures implemented by Emperor Justin to establish Catholic supremacy in the East provoked Theodoric the Great, the Arian and Ostrogothic ruler of Italy, to retaliate in the West. Pope John I, who succeeded Hormisdas, became concerned, and in 525, he traveled to Constantinople in response to Theodoric&#x27;s demands to revoke the edict against the Arians and restore their churches (according to Marcellinus Comes).

Pope John I received great honor during his visit to the Eastern capital. The people greeted him twelve miles outside the city, carrying ceremonial tapers and crosses. Emperor Justin prostrated himself before the pope and expressed a desire to be crowned by his hand. Patriarch Epiphanius invited the Pope to celebrate Mass, but due the traditional policy of encroachment, the Pope refused to proceed until he was offered the primary seat. With great solemnity, the Pope conducted the Latin office on Easter Day, communing with all the bishops of the East except for Patriarch Timothy IV of Alexandria, a staunch opponent of Chalcedon.

In 531, the dispute between Rome and Constantinople was reignited by the appeal of Stephen, the metropolitan of Larissa, to Pope Boniface II, contesting a decision made by Epiphanius. Despite Stephen&#x27;s appeal, he was eventually deposed.

Epiphanius died after an episcopate of 15 years and 3 months. The information available about him portrays him in a positive light. In addition to his letters to Hormisdas, we also have records of the council&#x27;s ruling against Severus of Antioch and Peter III of Alexandria. Epiphanius is attributed with forty-five canons.

<text>Katharine Anne Hnida (; born May 17, 1981) is a former American football player who became the first woman to score in an NCAA Division I-A game, college football&#x27;s highest level. She accomplished this as placekicker for the University of New Mexico Lobos on August 30, 2003.

Hnida is the third woman to have scored in a college football game, after Liz Heaston, who played for NAIA Willamette University in 1997, and Ashley Martin, who played for NCAA Division I-AA Jacksonville State University in 2001. While at University of Colorado Boulder in 1999 she became the second woman to dress for a Division I-A game, and the first to do so for a bowl game.

==Early life==
Hnida grew up in Littleton, Colorado. She attended Chatfield Senior High School near Littleton, where she was a member of the football team. She went 3 for 3 in field goal attempts, and 27 for 28 in extra point attempts in her senior year. She was a member of the varsity team and named one of America&#x27;s &quot;20 most influential teens&quot; by &quot;Teen People&quot; magazine. Rick Reilly wrote a &quot;Life of Reilly&quot; column about her.

==College career==
After high school, Hnida enrolled at the University of Colorado Boulder. Due to her success in high school football, she was invited to join the Colorado Buffaloes football team as a walk-on freshman placekicker by then coach Rick Neuheisel. Neuheisel left Colorado in 1998, but his replacement Gary Barnett kept the walk-on offer open. Hnida never saw playing time at Colorado, though she did suit up for games, becoming the second woman to do so in Division I football, and the first to do so in a bowl game, when Colorado went to the 1999 Insight.com Bowl. In 2000, after falling ill with mononucleosis and tonsillitis, Hnida was unable to compete for a roster spot.

Hnida left Colorado in 2001 and eventually transferred to the University of New Mexico the following year. There she made the New Mexico Lobos football team as a walk-on placekicker. While at New Mexico, she became the first woman to play in a Division I-A bowl game when she played in the 2002 Las Vegas Bowl against UCLA, where her extra point attempt was blocked. On August 30, 2003, she became the first woman to score in a Division I-A game when she kicked two extra points against Texas State University in the fourth quarter of a 72–8 New Mexico win. She graduated in December 2004.

Hnida made more news in February 2004 when she told &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Rick Reilly that she had been raped by one of her teammates at Colorado in 2000, and sexually harassed on other occasions. She was one of several women who reported being assaulted by members or recruits of the Colorado football team during this time. Colorado coach Gary Barnett denied Hnida&#x27;s allegation in a statement, during which he also criticized Hnida&#x27;s abilities as a player. The school subsequently suspended Barnett for his comments.

==Post-playing life==
Hnida travels around the country to share her athletic story and her journey as a victim of sexual assault. She commonly speaks at colleges and universities to educate and raise awareness about assault. Katie has worked with many organizations that help victims of assault, including The Joyful Heart Foundation and the Voices and Faces Project. She resides in Los Angeles where she manages her speaking engagements and book tour.

Hnida&#x27;s father, Dave, is a physician and the medical reporter for the CBS affiliate in Denver. He is also the author of &quot;Paradise General: Riding the Surge at a Combat Hospital in Iraq.&quot;

In 2006, Hnida wrote a book about her experiences, titled &quot;Still Kicking: My Journey as the First Woman to Play Division One College Football&quot;. It details abuse and sexual assault she experienced while at Colorado, as well as her experiences afterward at the University of New Mexico.

In 2010, Hnida became the kicker for the Fort Wayne FireHawks in the Continental Indoor Football League. The league&#x27;s first female player, and only the second female professional football player in history (after placeholder Patricia Palinkas), Hnida played in the first three games of the team&#x27;s season but was released later that year after developing a blood clot in her kicking leg.

In 2018, Hnida became gravely ill after an adverse reaction to a prescribed antibiotic sent her into multiple organ failure; her family reported her kidneys and liver failed and her bone marrow quit functioning, resulting in admission to an intensive care unit and emergency dialysis.

<text>Days of Wine and Roses is a 1962 American romantic drama film directed by Blake Edwards with a screenplay by JP Miller adapted from his own 1958 &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; teleplay of the same name. The film was produced by Martin Manulis in co-operation with Lemmon&#x27;s Jalem Productions (the first for his independent film production company), with music by Henry Mancini, and stars Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick, with supporting roles by Charles Bickford and Jack Klugman. The film depicts the downward spiral of two average Americans who succumb to alcoholism and their repeated attempts to deal with their problems.

An Academy Award went to the film&#x27;s theme music, composed by Mancini with lyrics by Johnny Mercer. The film received four other Oscar nominations, including Best Actor and Best Actress. In 2018, &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==
San Francisco public relations executive Joe Clay meets secretary Kirsten Arnesen. At first, he mistakes her for a call girl, but then when he learns she is a client&#x27;s secretary, he tries to apologize and court her but she brushes him off. Eventually she warms to him and they begin dating. Kirsten is a teetotaler until Joe introduces her to social drinking. She is initially reluctant, but after her first few Brandy Alexanders, she admits that having a drink makes her &quot;feel good.&quot; Despite the misgivings of Kirsten&#x27;s father, who runs a San Mateo plant nursery and landscaping business, they marry and have a daughter, Debbie.

Joe and Kirsten slowly go from the &quot;two-martini lunch&quot; to full-blown alcoholism. Joe is demoted due to poor performance, and is sent out of town to work on a minor account. Kirsten is alone with their daughter all day and finds drinking the best way to pass the time. While drunk one afternoon, she causes a fire in their apartment that almost kills her and Debbie. Eventually, Joe is fired, and he spends the next several years going from job to job.

One day, Joe sees his reflection in a bar window and realizes in horror that he hardly knows his own face. He tells Kirsten that they must stop drinking, and while not keen on the idea, she agrees. Seeking escape from their addiction, Joe and Kirsten work together in Arnesen&#x27;s business and stay sober for two months. But the urge is too strong, and during a late-night drinking binge, Joe destroys his father-in-law&#x27;s greenhouse while looking for a stashed liquor bottle.

Joe is committed to a sanitarium, where he suffers from delirium tremens while confined in a straitjacket. After his release, Joe finally gets sober with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous, a dedicated sponsor named Jim Hungerford, and regular AA meetings. Jim explains to Joe how alcoholics often demonstrate obsessive behavior, pointing out that Kirsten&#x27;s previous passion for chocolate may have been the first sign of an addictive personality. He advises Joe that most drinkers hate to drink alone or in the company of sober people.

Meanwhile, Kirsten&#x27;s drinking persists, and she disappears for several days without contacting Joe. She is eventually located at a nearby motel, drunk, but when Joe tries to help her, he ends up drinking again. When their supply runs out, Joe happens upon a liquor store that has closed for the night. He breaks in and steals a bottle but trips and is taunted by the store owner. The result is another trip to the sanitarium, where he is stripped down and tied to a treatment table. Jim appears at his side and warns him that he must keep sober no matter what, even if that means staying away from Kirsten.

Joe finally gets sober, becomes a responsible father to Debbie, and holds down a steady job. He tries to make amends to his father-in-law by offering him payment for past debts and wrongs, but Arnesen accuses him of being indirectly responsible for Kirsten&#x27;s alcoholism. After calming down, Arnesen says that Kirsten has been disappearing for long periods and is picking up strangers in bars.

One night, Kirsten, shakily sober for two days, comes to Joe&#x27;s apartment to attempt a reconciliation. Joe tells her she is welcome back anytime if she stops drinking, saying he will not abandon sobriety for her or anything else. Despite acknowledging she can&#x27;t stop, Kirsten refuses to admit she is an alcoholic and suggests Joe give up on her before leaving.

Joe fights the urge to go after her, calling her name as she turns away from a bar. His cries wake a sleeping Debbie, who asks if Kirsten is coming back. Joe tells her Kirsten is sick and, after deflecting her questions about Kirsten &quot;getting well,&quot; stares out at the empty street, the bar&#x27;s flashing neon sign reflected in the window.

==Production==
===Background===
JP Miller found his title in the 1896 poem &quot;Vitae Summa Brevis Spem Nos Vetat Incohare Longam&quot; by the English writer Ernest Dowson (1867–1900): It also inspired the title song devised by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer.
:They are not long, the weeping and the laughter,
:Love and desire and hate;
:I think they have no portion in us after
:We pass the gate.

:They are not long, the days of wine and roses:
:Out of a misty dream
:Our path emerges for a while, then closes
:Within a dream.

Johnny Mercer had also written the lyrics for the theme from &quot;Laura&quot;, a 1944 film in which Dowson&#x27;s poem is quoted in its entirety.

Miller&#x27;s teleplay for &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, also titled &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot;, had received favorable critical attention and was nominated for an Emmy Award in the category Best Writing of a Single Dramatic Program - One Hour or Longer. Manulis, a &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; producer, decided the material was ideal for a movie. Some critics observed that the movie lacked the impact of the original television production, which starred Cliff Robertson as Joe and Piper Laurie as Kirsten. In an article written for &quot;DVD Journal,&quot; critic D.K. Holm noted numerous changes that altered the original considerably when the material was filmed. He cites as an example the hiring of Jack Lemmon. With his participation &quot;little remained of the founding teleplay, except for actor Charles Bickford reprising his role.&quot;

===Filming===
The film&#x27;s locations included San Francisco, Albany, California, and the Golden Gate Fields race track. The Oscar-winning title song had music by Henry Mancini and lyrics by Johnny Mercer. Single records by Andy Williams and the Henry Mancini chorus made the Billboard Top 40.

Director Blake Edwards became a non-drinker a year after completing the film and went into substance-abuse recovery. He said that he and Jack Lemmon were heavy drinkers while making the film. Edwards used the theme of alcohol abuse often in his films, including &quot;10&quot; (1979), &quot;Blind Date&quot; (1987) and &quot;Skin Deep&quot; (1989). Both Lemmon and Remick sought help from Alcoholics Anonymous long after they had completed the film. Lemmon revealed to James Lipton on &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; his past drinking problems and his recovery. The film had a lasting effect in reinforcing the growing social acceptance of Alcoholics Anonymous.

In the interview on &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;, Lemmon stated that there was pressure by the studio to change the ending. To preserve the integrity of the movie, scenes were filmed in the same order as they appeared in the script, with the last scene filmed last. This is in contrast with the standard practice of filming different scenes together that take place in the same location, which reduces expenses, shortens the schedule, and aids with scheduling the actors&#x27; time on set. Immediately following the completion of filming, Lemmon left for Europe and remained out of communication so that the studio would be forced to release the movie without changing the story.

==Release==
The producers used the following tagline to market the film: &quot;This, in its own terrifying way, is a love story.&quot;

The picture opened in the United States on December 26, 1962.

===Home media===
Warner Home Video released the film on video on February 9, 1983, as part of their &quot;A Night At the Movies&quot; series, featuring a Hearst Metrotone Newsreel; a Warner Bros. animated short; and a coming attractions trailer of films from 1962. A LaserDisc was released in 1990. A DVD of the film was released on January 6, 2004, by Warner Home Video containing an extra commentary track by director Blake Edwards and an interview with Jack Lemmon. A Warner Archive Blu-ray was released on October 29, 2019.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film became one of Blake Edwards&#x27; better-regarded films, opening to praise from the critics and audiences alike. Bosley Crowther, film critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote &quot;[It] is a commanding picture, and it is extremely well played by Mr. Lemmon and Miss Remick, who spare themselves none of the shameful, painful scenes. But for all their brilliant performing and the taut direction of Blake Edwards, they do not bring two pitiful characters to complete and overpowering life.&quot;

&quot;Tube.&quot; at &quot;Variety&quot; liked the film, especially the acting and writing: &quot;Miller&#x27;s gruelling drama illustrates how the unquenchable lure of alcohol can supersede even love, and how marital communication cannot exist in a house divided by one-sided boozing ... Lemmon gives a dynamic and chilling performance. Scenes of his collapse, particularly in the violent ward, are brutally realistic and terrifying. Miss Remick, too, is effective, and there is solid featured work from Charles Bickford and Jack Klugman and a number of fine supporting performances.&quot;

In a review of the DVD, critic Gary W. Tooze lauded Edwards&#x27; direction: &quot;Blake Edwards&#x27;s powerful adaptation of J.P. Miller&#x27;s &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; story, starring Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick in career performances, remains a variation in his body of work largely devoted to comedy... Lemmon is at his best and ditto for Remick in this harrowing tale of people consumed by their mutual addiction. This turns to an honest and heartbreaking portrayal of alcoholism as deftly done as any film I can remember.&quot;

Margaret Parsons, film curator at the National Gallery of Art, stated &quot;[The film] remains one of the most gut-wrenching dramas of alcohol-related ruin and recovery ever captured on film...and it&#x27;s also one of the pioneering films of the genre.&quot;

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 100% based on 14 reviews, with an average score of 8.80/10.

===Box office===
Jack L. Warner claimed the film needed to earn theatrical rentals of 2.5 times its $2 million budget to become profitable. It earned $4 million in rentals in the United States and Canada, from a gross of $8.1 million, ranking it 14th among high-grossing films of the year.

===Awards and nominations===
Other Honors
* Selected by the film critics of &quot;The New York Times&quot; as one of the 1000 best films ever made.
* Selected as one of American Film Institute&#x27;s best 400 films.

== Musical adaptation ==

The musical adaptation based on the film and the original teleplay was produced by the Atlantic Theater Company in 2023, starring Kelli O&#x27;Hara as Kirsten and Brian d&#x27;Arcy James as Joe. The musical has a book by Craig Lucas and music and lyrics by Adam Guettel, the same writing team behind &quot;The Light in the Piazza&quot;, and is directed by Michael Greif. It opened May 5, 2023, and closed on July 5 of the same year. The musical transferred to Broadway and opened on January 28, 2024 at Studio 54 and closed on March 31, 2024. 

==In popular culture==
Bill Withers was inspired by &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot;. Withers was watching it on television, and the doomed relationship at the film&#x27;s center brought to mind a phrase: &quot;Ain’t no sunshine when she’s gone.&quot; This led him to write &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Sunshine&quot; in 1971.

The 15th episode of season 9 of the American television show &quot;Cheers&quot; is titled &quot;Days of Wine and Neuroses&quot; and features the character Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley) going through a tragicomic alcoholic binge while assessing her ambiguous feelings about a romantic relationship.

A sixth season episode titled &quot;Wine and Roses&quot; from the American crime drama series &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; is named after &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; and features an instrumental version of the movie&#x27;s title song.

<doc id="161870" wikidata="Q55469" url="?curid=161870" title="Marcello Mastroianni">
<text>Marcello Vincenzo Domenico Mastroianni (28 September 1924 – 19 December 1996) was an Italian actor. He is generally regarded one of Italy&#x27;s most iconic male performers of the 20th-century, who played leading roles for many of the country&#x27;s top directors, in a career spanning 147 films between 1939 and 1996, garnering many international honours including two BAFTA Awards, two Best Actor awards at the Venice and Cannes film festivals, two Golden Globes, and three Academy Award nominations.

Born in the province of Frosinone and raised in Turin and Rome, Mastroianni made his film debut in 1939 at the age of 14, but did not seriously pursue acting until the 1950s, when he made his critical and commercial breakthrough in the caper comedy &quot;Big Deal on Madonna Street&quot; (1959). He became an international celebrity through his collaborations with director Federico Fellini, first as a disillusioned tabloid columnist in &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; (1960), then as a creatively-stifled filmmaker in &quot;8½&quot; (1963). Excelling in both dramatic and comedic roles, he formed a notable on-screen duo with actress and sex symbol Sophia Loren, co-starring with her in eight films between 1954 and 1994.

Despite international acclaim, Mastroianni largely shunned Hollywood, and remained a quintessentially Italian thespian for the majority of his career. He was the first actor to receive an Academy Award nomination for a non-English language performance, and was nominated for Best Actor three times – &quot;Divorce Italian Style&quot; (1961), &quot;A Special Day&quot; (1977), and &quot;Dark Eyes&quot; (1987). He was one of only three actors, the others being Jack Lemmon and Dean Stockwell, to win the prestigious Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor twice. Mastroianni&#x27;s contributions to Italian art and culture saw him receive multiple civil honours, including the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic, the highest-ranking knighthood of the country.

==Early life==
Mastroianni was born in Fontana Liri, a small village in the Apennines within the Lazio province of Frosinone, and grew up in Turin and Rome. He was the son of Ida (née Irolle) and Ottone Mastroianni. Both of his parents were from the nearby town of Arpino. His father ran a carpentry shop. Mastroianni was a nephew of sculptor Umberto Mastroianni. During World War II, after the division into Axis and Allied Italy, he was interned in a loosely guarded German prison camp, from which he escaped to hide in Venice.

His brother Ruggero Mastroianni was a film editor who worked on some of Marcello&#x27;s films (&quot;City of Women&quot;, &quot;Ginger and Fred&quot;), and appeared alongside Marcello in &quot;Scipione detto anche l&#x27;Africano&quot;, a spoof of the once popular Sword and Sandal film genre released in 1971.

==Acting career==

Mastroianni made his screen debut as an uncredited extra in &quot;Marionette&quot; (1939) when he was fourteen, and made intermittent minor film appearances until landing his first big role in &quot;Atto d&#x27;accusa&quot; (1951). Within a decade he became a major international celebrity, starring in &quot;Big Deal on Madonna Street&quot; (1958); and in Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; (1960) playing a disillusioned and self-loathing tabloid columnist who spends his days and nights exploring Rome&#x27;s decadent high society. Mastroianni followed &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; with another signature role, that of a film director who, amidst self-doubt and troubled love affairs, finds himself in a creative block while making a film in Fellini&#x27;s &quot;8½&quot; (1963).

His other prominent films include &quot;Days of Love&quot; (1954) with Marina Vlady; &quot;La Notte&quot; (1961) with Jeanne Moreau; &quot;Too Bad She&#x27;s Bad&quot; (1954), &quot;Lucky to Be a Woman&quot; (1956), &quot;Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow&quot; (1963), &quot;Marriage Italian Style&quot; (1964), &quot;Sunflower&quot; (1970), &quot;The Priest&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1971), &quot;A Special Day&quot; (1977) and Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Prêt-à-Porter&quot; (1994) – all co-starring Sophia Loren; Luchino Visconti&#x27;s &quot;White Nights&quot; (1957); Pietro Germi&#x27;s &quot;Divorce Italian Style&quot; (1961); &quot;Family Diary&quot; (1962) with Jacques Perrin; &quot;A Very Private Affair&quot; (1962) with Brigitte Bardot; Mario Monicelli&#x27;s &quot;Casanova 70&quot; (1965); &quot;Diamonds for Breakfast&quot; (1968) with Rita Tushingham; &quot;The Pizza Triangle&quot; (1970) with Monica Vitti; &quot;Massacre in Rome&quot; (1973) with Richard Burton; &quot;The Sunday Woman&quot; (1975) with Jacqueline Bisset; &quot;Stay As You Are&quot; (1978) with Nastassja Kinski; Fellini&#x27;s &quot;City of Women&quot; (1980) and &quot;Ginger and Fred&quot; (1986); Marco Bellocchio&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV&quot; (1984); &quot;Macaroni&quot; (1985) with Jack Lemmon; Nikita Mikhalkov&#x27;s &quot;Dark Eyes&quot; (1987) with Marthe Keller; Giuseppe Tornatore&#x27;s &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Fine&quot; (1990); &quot;Used People&quot; (1992) with Shirley MacLaine; and Agnès Varda&#x27;s &quot;One Hundred and One Nights&quot; (1995).

He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor three times: for &quot;Divorce Italian Style&quot;, &quot;A Special Day&quot; and &quot;Dark Eyes&quot;. Mastroianni, Dean Stockwell and Jack Lemmon are the only actors to have been twice awarded the Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival. Mastroianni won it in 1970 for &quot;The Pizza Triangle&quot; and in 1987 for &quot;Dark Eyes&quot;.

Mastroianni starred alongside his daughter, Chiara Mastroianni, in Raúl Ruiz&#x27;s &quot;Three Lives and Only One Death&quot; in 1996. For this performance he won the Silver Wave Award at the Ft. Lauderdale International Film Festival. His final film, &quot;Voyage to the Beginning of the World&quot; (1997), was released posthumously.

==Personal life==
Mastroianni married Flora Carabella on 12 August 1950. They had one daughter together, Barbara (1951–2018), and informally separated in 1964 because of his affairs with younger women. Mastroianni&#x27;s first serious relationship after the separation was with Faye Dunaway, his co-star in &quot;A Place for Lovers&quot; (1968). Dunaway wanted to marry and have children, but Mastroianni, a Catholic, refused to divorce Carabella. In 1970, after more than two years of waiting for Mastroianni to change his mind, Dunaway left him. Mastroianni told a reporter for &quot;People&quot; magazine in 1987 that he never got over the breakup. &quot;She was the woman I loved the most,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;ll always be sorry to have lost her. I was whole with her for the first time in my life.&quot; In her 1995 autobiography &quot;Looking for Gatsby&quot;, Dunaway wrote: &quot;I wish to this day it had worked out.&quot; In the 2024 documentary &quot;Faye&quot;, she described him as the love of her life.

After the break up with Dunaway, Mastroianni began a relationship with French actress Catherine Deneuve, who was nearly 20 years his junior. They lived together for four years during the 1970s and had a daughter, Chiara Mastroianni (born 28 May 1972) During their time together the couple made four films: &quot;It Only Happens to Others&quot; (1971), &quot;La cagna&quot; (1972), &quot;A Slightly Pregnant Man&quot; (1973) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Touch the White Woman!&quot; (1974). After Mastroianni and Deneuve broke up, his estranged wife Carabella reportedly offered to adopt Chiara because her parents&#x27; busy careers kept them away from her so often. Deneuve adamantly refused.

Mastroianni&#x27;s other lovers reportedly included actresses Anouk Aimée, Carole Mallory, Claudia Cardinale, Lauren Hutton and Ursula Andress. By 1976, he became involved with Anna Maria Tatò, an author and filmmaker. They remained together until his death in 1996.

He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in 1994.

==Death==

Mastroianni died of pancreatic cancer on 19 December 1996 at the age of 72. Both of his daughters, as well as Deneuve and Tatò, were at his bedside. The Trevi Fountain in Rome, associated with his role in Fellini&#x27;s &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;, was symbolically turned-off and draped in black as a tribute. A funeral was held at the Church of St. Sulpice in Saint-Germain-des-Prés in Paris 20 December 1996 before his remains were transferred to Rome where a second ceremony took place at the city hall on 22 December before he was interred in his family vault in Verano Cemetery.

At the 1997 Venice Film Festival, Chiara, Carabella, and Deneuve tried to block the screening of Tatò&#x27;s four-hour documentary, &quot;Marcello Mastroianni: I Remember&quot; The festival refused and the film was shown. The three women reportedly tried to do the same thing at Cannes. Tatò said Mastroianni had willed her all rights to his image.

<text>Divorce Italian Style () is a 1961 Italian black comedy film directed by Pietro Germi. The screenplay is by Germi, Ennio De Concini, Alfredo Giannetti, and Agenore Incrocci, based on Giovanni Arpino&#x27;s novel &quot;Un delitto d&#x27;onore&quot; (English title &quot;A Crime of Honor&quot;). It stars Marcello Mastroianni, Daniela Rocca, Stefania Sandrelli, Lando Buzzanca, and Leopoldo Trieste.

It received the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, two Golden Globe Awards and numerous other International film prizes. In 2008, the film was included in the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage&#x27;s 100 Italian films to be saved, a list of 100 films that &quot;have changed the collective memory of the country between 1942 and 1978.&quot;

==Plot==
Ferdinando Cefalù, a 37-year-old impoverished Sicilian nobleman, is married to Rosalia, a devoted wife he no longer loves. He is in love with his cousin Angela, a 16-year-old girl he sees only during the summer because her family sends her away to Catholic school in the city. Besides his wife, he shares his life with his elderly parents, his sister, and her fiancé, a funeral director. The family share their once stately palace with his uncles, who are slowly but surely eating away the remainders of their once rich estate.

Aware that divorce is illegal, Ferdinando fantasizes about doing away with his wife, such as by throwing her into a boiling cauldron, sending her into space in a rocket, or drowning her in quicksand. After a chance encounter with Angela during a family trip, he discovers that she shares his feelings. 

Inspired by a local story of a woman who killed her husband in a rage of jealousy, he resolves to lead his wife into having an affair so that he can catch her &quot;&quot;, murder her, and receive a light sentence for committing an honour killing. He first needs to find a suitable lover for his wife, whom he finds in the local priest&#x27;s godson, Carmelo Patanè, a painter who has had feelings for Rosalia for years. For a time he was presumed killed during World War II. Ferdinando also procures the State Prosecutor&#x27;s friendship with a small favor. The final stage of his plan is to arrange for Carmelo&#x27;s constant presence in his house, which he achieves by feigning interest in having his palace frescoes restored.

But Carmelo is timid with Rosalia, and she is initially committed to conjugal fidelity. Ferdinando tapes their private conversations and has to ward off the maid Sisina&#x27;s infatuation with Carmelo. After Carmelo makes a pass at Sisina, she tells the priest, Carmelo&#x27;s godfather, at confession, who informs her that Carmelo is married with three children. She relays that information to Ferdinando. Rosalia and Carmelo finally give in to their passion, but the tape of their conversation runs out just as they are arranging their next meeting. All Ferdinando knows is that it will take place the next evening.

Rosalia feigns a headache and remains home while the rest of the family goes to the cinema to see the local première of &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;, a film so scandalous that no one wants to miss it. Ferdinando sneaks out of the theater and returns home, arriving just in time to see Rosalia leaving for the train station. He retrieves his gun to kill her, but arrives at the station just after their train departs. He revisits his plan and the Criminal Code. It defines a crime of passion as executed in the heat of the moment or in defense of one&#x27;s honor, so he embraces the role of a cuckold.

All along, Angela has been writing Ferdinando to assure him of her undying love for him. Her last letter is misdelivered to her father, who dies of a heart attack upon reading it. At the funeral, Ferdinando is approached by Mrs. Patanè, who demands to know what he will do about their situation. After he responds noncommittally, she spits in his face in front of the entire town, which gives him what he needs: an open insult to the family&#x27;s honor due to his wife&#x27;s elopement. 

The local Mafia boss offers to find the lovers within 24 hours, which he does. As Ferdinando goes to the lovers&#x27; hideout, he hears Mrs. Patanè kill Carmelo. He follows suit and kills Rosalia. At his trial he is defended by the State Prosecutor, who blames the whole thing on Ferdinando&#x27;s father, saying that he failed to give his son enough love when raising him as a boy. Ferdinando is released from prison after three years and returns home to find Angela waiting for him.

Later, Ferdinando and Angela are happily sailing at sea. As they kiss, Angela seductively rubs her feet against those of the young workman piloting the boat.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===

Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 100% based on 17 reviews. Upon release in the United States, Bosley Crowther of The New York Times called it &quot;one of the funniest pictures the Italians have sent along&quot; and praised Germi as &quot;a genius with the sly twist.&quot; James Powers of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised the &quot;mocking, sardonic farce&quot; as &quot;bold, irreverent, and human to the bone,&quot; and he predicted it would be successful in America due its dual nature as both an arthouse film and a film that achieves general appeal. &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a positive review, calling the satire &quot;a penetrating, almost brutal glimpse of Sicily and its antiquated way of life.&quot;

===Box Office===

When the film was released in the United States, it earned theatrical rentals of $803,666 in 1962 and a further $1,449,347 in 1963 for a total of $2,252,013 in the United States and Canada. It was still in release in 1964.

===Accolades===
==Adaptations==
In 2008 Giorgio Battistelli adapted &quot;Divorce Italian Style&quot; into an opera, &quot;Divorce à l&#x27;Italienne&quot;, which premiered by the Opéra national de Lorraine on September 30 of that year with tenor Wolfgang Ablinger Sperrhacke in Mastroianni&#x27;s role. Battistelli chose to set every female role except Angela for low male voice; sang the role of Rosalia.

<text>Dana Stewart Scott (born October 11, 1932) is an American logician who is the emeritus Hillman University Professor of Computer Science, Philosophy, and Mathematical Logic at Carnegie Mellon University; he is now retired and lives in Berkeley, California. His work on automata theory earned him the Turing Award in 1976, while his collaborative work with Christopher Strachey in the 1970s laid the foundations of modern approaches to the semantics of programming languages. He has also worked on modal logic, topology, and category theory.

==Early career==
He received his B.A. in Mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1954. He wrote his Ph.D. thesis on &quot;Convergent Sequences of Complete Theories&quot; under the supervision of Alonzo Church while at Princeton, and defended his thesis in 1958. Solomon Feferman (2005) writes of this period:

After completing his Ph.D. studies, he moved to the University of Chicago, working as an instructor there until 1960. In 1959, he published a joint paper with Michael O. Rabin, a colleague from Princeton, titled &quot;Finite Automata and Their Decision Problem&quot; (Scott and Rabin 1959) which introduced the idea of nondeterministic machines to automata theory. This work led to the joint bestowal of the Turing Award on the two, for the introduction of this fundamental concept of computational complexity theory.

==University of California, Berkeley, 1960–1963==
Scott took up a post as Assistant Professor of Mathematics, back at the University of California, Berkeley, and involved himself with classical issues in mathematical logic, especially set theory and Tarskian model theory. He proved that the axiom of constructibility is incompatible with the existence of a measurable cardinal, a result considered &quot;seminal&quot; in the evolution of set theory.

During this period he started supervising Ph.D. students, such as James Halpern (&quot;Contributions to the Study of the Independence of the Axiom of Choice&quot;) and Edgar Lopez-Escobar (&quot;Infinitely Long Formulas with Countable Quantifier Degrees&quot;).

===Modal and tense logic===
Scott also began working on modal logic in this period, beginning a collaboration with John Lemmon, who moved to Claremont, California, in 1963. Scott was especially interested in Arthur Prior&#x27;s approach to tense logic and the connection to the treatment of time in natural-language semantics, and began collaborating with Richard Montague (Copeland 2004), whom he had known from his days as an undergraduate at Berkeley. Later, Scott and Montague independently discovered an important generalisation of Kripke semantics for modal and tense logic, called Scott-Montague semantics (Scott 1970).

John Lemmon and Scott began work on a modal-logic textbook that was interrupted by Lemmon&#x27;s death in 1966. Scott circulated the incomplete monograph amongst colleagues, introducing a number of important techniques in the semantics of model theory, most importantly presenting a refinement of the &quot;canonical model&quot; that became standard, and introducing the technique of constructing models through &quot;filtrations&quot;, both of which are core concepts in modern Kripke semantics (Blackburn, de Rijke, and Venema, 2001). Scott eventually published the work as &quot;An Introduction to Modal Logic&quot; (Lemmon &amp; Scott, 1977).

==Stanford, Amsterdam and Princeton, 1963–1972==
Following an initial observation of Robert Solovay, Scott formulated the concept of Boolean-valued model, as Solovay and Petr Vopěnka did likewise at around the same time. In 1967, Scott published a paper, &quot;A Proof of the Independence of the Continuum Hypothesis&quot;, in which he used Boolean-valued models to provide an alternate analysis of the independence of the continuum hypothesis to that provided by Paul Cohen. This work led to the award of the Leroy P. Steele Prize in 1972.

==University of Oxford, 1972–1981==
Scott took up a post as Professor of Mathematical Logic on the Philosophy faculty of the University of Oxford in 1972. He was member of Merton College while at Oxford and is now an Honorary Fellow of the college.

===Semantics of programming languages===
This period saw Scott working with Christopher Strachey, and the two
managed, despite administrative pressures, to do work on providing a mathematical foundation for the semantics of programming languages, the work for which Scott is best known. Together, their work constitutes the Scott–Strachey approach to denotational semantics, an important and seminal contribution to theoretical computer science. One of Scott&#x27;s contributions is his formulation of domain theory, allowing programs involving recursive functions and looping-control constructs to be given denotational semantics. Additionally, he provided a foundation for the understanding of infinitary and continuous information through domain theory and his theory of information systems.

Scott&#x27;s work of this period led to the bestowal of:
* The 1990 Harold Pender Award for his &quot;application of concepts from logic and algebra to the development of mathematical semantics of programming languages&quot;;
* The 1997 Rolf Schock Prize in logic and philosophy from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for &quot;his conceptually oriented logical works, especially the creation of domain theory, which has made it possible to extend Tarski&#x27;s semantic paradigm to programming languages as well as to construct models of Curry&#x27;s combinatory logic and Church&#x27;s calculus of lambda conversion&quot;; and
* The 2001 Bolzano Prize for Merit in the Mathematical Sciences by the Czech Academy of Sciences
* The 2007 EATCS Award for his contribution to theoretical computer science.

==Carnegie Mellon University, 1981–2003==
At Carnegie Mellon University, Scott proposed the theory of equilogical spaces as a successor theory to domain theory; among its many advantages, the category of equilogical spaces is a cartesian closed category, whereas the category of domains is not. In 1994, he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

<text>This Sporting Life is a 1963 British kitchen sink drama film directed by Lindsay Anderson. Based on the 1960 novel of the same name by David Storey, which won the 1960 Macmillan Fiction Award, it recounts the story of a rugby league footballer in Wakefield, a mining city in Yorkshire, whose romantic life is not as successful as his sporting life. Storey, a former professional rugby league footballer, also wrote the screenplay.

The film stars Richard Harris, Rachel Roberts, William Hartnell, and Alan Badel. It was Harris&#x27;s first starring role, and won him the Best Actor Award at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival. He was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. For her work in the film, Roberts won her second BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. The film opened at the Odeon Leicester Square in London&#x27;s West End on 7 February 1963.

==Plot== 
Set in the fictional city of City, the film is about Frank Machin, a bitter young coal miner from the West Riding of Yorkshire. The first part of the story is told through a series of flashbacks when Frank is anaesthetised in a dentist&#x27;s chair, having had his front teeth broken in a rugby league match, and recovering at a Christmas party. The second part takes place after he has fully regained his senses, and proceeds without flashbacks.

Following a nightclub altercation, in which Frank takes on the captain of the local rugby league club and punches a couple of other players, he asks a scout for the team to help him get a tryout. Although at first somewhat uncoordinated at the sport, he impresses Gerald Weaver, one of the team&#x27;s owners, with the spirit and brutality of his playing style during the trial game. He receives a large signing bonus to join the top team as a loose forward (number 13) and impresses all with his aggressive forward play. He often punches or elbows the opposing players—and sometimes even those of his own team.

Off the field, Frank is much less successful. His recently-widowed landlady, Mrs Margaret Hammond, a mother of two young children, rebuffs Frank&#x27;s attempts to court her and treats him rudely and abrasively. She lost her husband in an accident at Weaver&#x27;s engraving firm, but received little financial compensation, because the death was suspected to be a suicide. One day, Frank takes Margaret and her children to play in the River Wharfe next to Bolton Priory. Another time, Margaret gets annoyed when Frank comes home drunk. He desires her sexually and, eventually, grabs her and forces her onto his bed. Her daughter interrupts them, but then she acquiesces and they have sexual relations.

At Weaver&#x27;s Christmas party, Frank quarrels with Weaver and his predatory wife, whose advances Frank had rejected, much to her chagrin, and it is clear that he has lost Weaver&#x27;s favour, though Slomer, the team&#x27;s other owner, still supports him. When he gets home after the party, Margaret agrees to share his bed to keep him warm, as he looks unwell with his swollen face and missing teeth, but, in her grief, she cannot really return his affection, saying she is scared to invest her feelings in one person, as they might go away or die. She sometimes insults him, referring to him as &quot;just a great ape&quot;, and, on their first proper date, Frank insults the staff and flaunts protocol at the fancy restaurant to which he takes her. Margaret is embarrassed and leaves, and the scene is witnessed by the Weavers.

Maurice, Frank&#x27;s friend and teammate, gets married, and Frank and Margaret attend the ceremony. When Frank goes over to congratulate the couple, Margaret walks away. She says she feels ashamed, like a kept woman, especially since Frank bought her a fur coat. He strikes her, and then says he thought she was finally becoming happy. On another occasion, she says that their neighbours think she is a slut and she and the children are not &quot;proper people&quot; because of Frank. They have a row, and Frank goes out drinking with Maurice. He says he wants another job, &quot;something permanent&quot;, and believes Margaret needs him, though she does not realise it.

Frank tries to talk to Margaret, but she defends her privacy, saying he knows nothing about Eric, her husband. He says she drove Eric to suicide, and Margaret, outraged, demands that Frank leave and starts throwing his belongings out of his room. Frank says he loves her, but she is furious with him. Eventually, he goes to stay at a cheap boarding house in a bombed-out area, leaving his Jaguar incongruously parked outside.

Intending a reconciliation with Margaret, Frank returns to her house, but a neighbour says she is in hospital. The doctor tells him that Margaret is unconscious, having suffered a brain haemorrhage, and that she may not have the strength, or perhaps the will, to survive. Frank sits with her, holding her hand and talking gently. Distracted by a large spider on the wall, when he looks back at Margaret, blood seeps from her mouth, and she dies. In his rage, Frank punches the spider. He does not speak to the children or their minder when he leaves the hospital. Returning to Margaret&#x27;s house and breaking in by the back door, Frank wanders through the empty space and calls out her name before collapsing in tears.

In the closing scene, Frank is seen on the rugby field, now exhausted and vulnerable to the ravages of time and injury.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Background===
&quot;This Sporting Life&quot; was Anderson&#x27;s first feature film as director, though he had made numerous short documentaries in the previous fifteen years, and even won an Oscar for 1954&#x27;s &quot;Thursday&#x27;s Children&quot;. The film had first been discussed by The Rank Organisation as a possible project for Joseph Losey, and then Karel Reisz, who, reluctant to direct another film with a similar setting and theme to &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot; (1960), suggested that Anderson direct it, with himself serving as producer.

===Casting===
Among the film&#x27;s supporting cast is William Hartnell, who shortly afterwards began his role as the first Doctor Who; it was his role in &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; that brought Hartnell to the attention of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;-producer Verity Lambert. The film also features Arthur Lowe, who would go on to star in &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; and appear in four later films directed by Anderson. In addition, Edward Fox, Anton Rodgers, and Bryan Mosley appear as uncredited extras.

===Filming locations===
Many of the scenes in &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; were filmed at Belle Vue, the home stadium of Wakefield Trinity, and Thrum Hall, the home stadium of Halifax. The scene where Frank (Richard Harris) leaps from a bus to buy a newspaper, and then leaps back onto the bus, was filmed at the top of Westgate, Wakefield. The location is still instantly recognisable, and has changed little in the decades since. The houses used for filming the outdoor scenes in &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; were in Servia Terrace in Leeds. The riverside location where Frank takes Margaret and her family for an outing in his new car is Bolton Priory in the Yorkshire Dales.

===Editing===
Anthony Sloman wrote about the film&#x27;s editing:
Another description of the editing says:
===Direction===
Anderson wrote in his diary on 23 April 1962, after the first month or so of production: &quot;the most striking feature of it all, I suppose, has been the splendour and misery of my work and relationship with Richard&quot;. He felt that Harris was acting better than ever before in his career, but feared his feelings for Harris, whose combination of physicality, affection and cruelty fascinated him, meant that he lacked the detachment he needed as a director, continuing: &quot;I ought to be calm and detached with him. Instead I am impulsive, affectionate, infinitely susceptible.&quot;

==Release==
===Critical reception and box office===
Critical response to the film was favourable. In the United States, the Reuters news agency described it as being praised unanimously by the critics for New York City publications. &quot;Variety&quot; praised the film&#x27;s &quot;gutsy vitality&quot;, as well as the production of Reisz and the directorial efforts of Anderson, who &quot;brings the keen, observant eye of a documentary man to many vivid episodes without sacrificing the story line&quot;.

On its initial release, the film was a commercial flop with British audiences and did not recoup its cost. John Davis, the Chairman of The Rank Organisation, announced that the company would not venture further with &quot;kitchen sink&quot; film projects, nor would his company make such a &quot;squalid&quot; film again, and &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; has been seen more generally as ending producers&#x27; willingness to back such British New Wave films. However, after 13 years, the film had earned a distributor’s gross of £92,612 in the UK and £128,599 from overseas.

Writing in 1980, John Russell Taylor thought it a mistake to link &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; with the &quot;kitchen sink&quot; films released in the preceding few years, because its &quot;emotionalism&quot; made it &quot;unique&quot;, setting it apart from the earlier works:

===Awards and nominations===
===Home media===
On 22 January 2008, the film was released as a Region 1 DVD by The Criterion Collection.

<doc id="161878" wikidata="Q377986" url="?curid=161878" title="Clean (programming language)">
<text>Clean is a general-purpose purely functional programming language. Originally called the Concurrent Clean System or the Clean System, it has been developed by a group of researchers from the Radboud University in Nijmegen since 1987. Although development of the language has slowed, some researchers are still working in the language. In 2018, a spin-off company was founded that uses Clean.

==Features==
Clean shares many properties and syntax with a younger sibling language, Haskell: referential transparency, list comprehension, guards, garbage collection, higher order functions, currying, and lazy evaluation. However, Clean deals with mutable state and input/output (I/O) through a uniqueness type system, in contrast to Haskell&#x27;s use of monads. The compiler takes advantage of the uniqueness type system to generate more efficient code, because it knows that at any point during the execution of the program, only one reference can exist to a value with a unique type. Therefore, a unique value can be changed in place.

An integrated development environment (IDE) for Microsoft Windows is included in the Clean distribution.

==Examples==
Hello world:

 Start = &quot;Hello, world!&quot;

Factorial:

Fibonacci sequence:

Infix operator:

(^) infixr 8 :: Int Int -&gt; Int
(^) x 0 = 1
(^) x n = x * x ^ (n-1)

The type declaration states that the function is a right associative infix operator with priority 8: this states that codice_1 is equivalent to codice_2 as opposed to codice_3. This operator is pre-defined in StdEnv, the Clean standard library.

==How Clean works==
Computing is based on graph rewriting and reduction. Constants such as numbers are graphs and functions are graph rewriting formulas. This, combined with compiling to native code, makes Clean programs which use high abstraction run relatively fast according to The Computer Language Benchmarks Game. A 2008 benchmark showed that Clean native code performs similarly to the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), depending on the benchmark.

==Compiling==
Compilation of Clean to machine code is performed as follows:

# Source files (.icl) and definition files (.dcl) are translated into Core Clean, a basic variant of Clean, by the compiler frontend written in Clean.
# Core clean is converted into Clean&#x27;s platform-independent intermediate language (.abc), by the compiler backend written in Clean and C.
# Intermediate ABC code is converted to object code (.o) by the code generator written in C.
# Object code is linked with other files in the module and the runtime system and converted into a normal executable using the system linker (when available) or a dedicated linker written in Clean on Windows.

Earlier versions of the Clean compiler were written completely in C, thus avoiding bootstrapping issues.

=== The ABC machine ===
The ABC code mentioned above is an intermediate representation for an abstract machine. Because machine code generation for ABC code is relatively straightforward, it is easy to support new architectures. The ABC machine is an imperative abstract graph rewriting machine. It consists of a graph store to hold the Clean graph that is being rewritten and three stacks:
* The A(rgument)-stack holds arguments that refer to nodes in the graph store.
* The B(asic value)-stack holds basic values (integers, characters, reals, etc.). Although these values could be nodes in the graph store, a separate stack is used for efficiency.
* The C(ontrol)-stack holds return addresses for flow control.
The runtime system, which is linked into every executable, builds a codice_4 node in the graph store and pushes it on the A-stack. It then begins printing it, evaluating it as needed.

=== Running Clean in the browser ===
Although Clean is typically used to generate native executables, several projects have enabled applications in web browsers.
The now abandoned SAPL project compiled Core Clean to JavaScript and did not use ABC code. Since 2019, an interpreter for ABC code, written in WebAssembly, is used instead.

==Platforms==
Clean is available for Microsoft Windows (IA-32 and X86-64), macOS (X86-64), and Linux (IA-32, X86-64, and AArch64).

Some libraries are not available on all platforms, like ObjectIO which is only available on Windows. Also the feature to write dynamics to files is only available on Windows.

The availability of Clean per platform varies with each version:

==Comparison to Haskell==
The syntax of Clean is very similar to that of Haskell, with some notable differences. In general, Haskell has introduced more syntactic sugar than Clean:

<text>In mathematics and physics, a scalar field is a function associating a single number to each point in a region of space – possibly physical space. The scalar may either be a pure mathematical number (dimensionless) or a scalar physical quantity (with units).

In a physical context, scalar fields are required to be independent of the choice of reference frame. That is, any two observers using the same units will agree on the value of the scalar field at the same absolute point in space (or spacetime) regardless of their respective points of origin. Examples used in physics include the temperature distribution throughout space, the pressure distribution in a fluid, and spin-zero quantum fields, such as the Higgs field. These fields are the subject of scalar field theory.

==Definition==
Mathematically, a scalar field on a region &quot;U&quot; is a real or complex-valued function or distribution on &quot;U&quot;. The region &quot;U&quot; may be a set in some Euclidean space, Minkowski space, or more generally a subset of a manifold, and it is typical in mathematics to impose further conditions on the field, such that it be continuous or often continuously differentiable to some order. A scalar field is a tensor field of order zero, and the term &quot;scalar field&quot; may be used to distinguish a function of this kind with a more general tensor field, density, or differential form.

Physically, a scalar field is additionally distinguished by having units of measurement associated with it. In this context, a scalar field should also be independent of the coordinate system used to describe the physical system—that is, any two observers using the same units must agree on the numerical value of a scalar field at any given point of physical space. Scalar fields are contrasted with other physical quantities such as vector fields, which associate a vector to every point of a region, as well as tensor fields and spinor fields. More subtly, scalar fields are often contrasted with pseudoscalar fields.

==Uses in physics==
In physics, scalar fields often describe the potential energy associated with a particular force. The force is a vector field, which can be obtained as a factor of the gradient of the potential energy scalar field. Examples include:
*Potential fields, such as the Newtonian gravitational potential, or the electric potential in electrostatics, are scalar fields which describe the more familiar forces.
* A temperature, humidity, or pressure field, such as those used in meteorology.

===Examples in quantum theory and relativity===
* In quantum field theory, a scalar field is associated with spin-0 particles. The scalar field may be real or complex valued. Complex scalar fields represent charged particles. These include the Higgs field of the Standard Model, as well as the charged pions mediating the strong nuclear interaction.
* In the Standard Model of elementary particles, a scalar Higgs field is used to give the leptons and massive vector bosons their mass, via a combination of the Yukawa interaction and the spontaneous symmetry breaking. This mechanism is known as the Higgs mechanism. A candidate for the Higgs boson was first detected at CERN in 2012.
* In scalar theories of gravitation scalar fields are used to describe the gravitational field.
* Scalar–tensor theories represent the gravitational interaction through both a tensor and a scalar. Such attempts are for example the Jordan theory as a generalization of the Kaluza–Klein theory and the Brans–Dicke theory.
:* Scalar fields like the Higgs field can be found within scalar–tensor theories, using as scalar field the Higgs field of the Standard Model. This field interacts gravitationally and Yukawa-like (short-ranged) with the particles that get mass through it.
* Scalar fields are found within superstring theories as dilaton fields, breaking the conformal symmetry of the string, though balancing the quantum anomalies of this tensor.
* Scalar fields are hypothesized to have caused the high accelerated expansion of the early universe (inflation), helping to solve the horizon problem and giving a hypothetical reason for the non-vanishing cosmological constant of cosmology. Massless (i.e. long-ranged) scalar fields in this context are known as inflatons. Massive (i.e. short-ranged) scalar fields are proposed, too, using for example Higgs-like fields.

==Other kinds of fields==
*Vector fields, which associate a vector to every point in space. Some examples of vector fields include the electromagnetic field and air flow (wind) in meteorology.
*Tensor fields, which associate a tensor to every point in space. For example, in general relativity gravitation is associated with the tensor field called Einstein tensor. In Kaluza–Klein theory, spacetime is extended to five dimensions and its Riemann curvature tensor can be separated out into ordinary four-dimensional gravitation plus an extra set, which is equivalent to Maxwell&#x27;s equations for the electromagnetic field, plus an extra scalar field known as the &quot;dilaton&quot;. (The dilaton scalar is also found among the massless bosonic fields in string theory.)

<doc id="161880" wikidata="Q1198073" url="?curid=161880" title="Hud (1963 film)">
<text>Hud is a 1963 American Western film starring Paul Newman, Melvyn Douglas, Brandon deWilde, and Patricia Neal. Directed by Martin Ritt, it was produced by Ritt and Newman&#x27;s recently founded company, Salem Productions, and was their first film for Paramount Pictures. &quot;Hud&quot; was filmed on location on the Texas Panhandle, including Claude, Texas. Its screenplay was by Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr. and was based on Larry McMurtry&#x27;s 1961 novel, &quot;Horseman, Pass By&quot;. The film&#x27;s title character, Hud Bannon, was a minor character in the original screenplay, but was reworked as the lead role. With its main character an antihero, &quot;Hud&quot; was later described as a revisionist Western.

The film centers on the ongoing conflict between principled patriarch Homer Bannon and his unscrupulous and arrogant son, Hud, during an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease putting the family&#x27;s cattle ranch at risk. Lonnie, Homer&#x27;s grandson and Hud&#x27;s nephew, is caught in the conflict and forced to choose which character to follow.

&quot;Hud&quot; premiered at the Venice International Film Festival, and was a critical and commercial success at its general release. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning three; Patricia Neal won Best Actress, Melvyn Douglas won Best Supporting Actor, and James Wong Howe the Academy Award for Best Black and White Cinematography. Howe&#x27;s use of contrast to create space and his selection of black-and-white was acclaimed by critics. In later reviews, the film received additional praise. In 2018, the film was included in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.

==Plot==
Hud is the ambitious, self-centered son of deeply principled Texas rancher Homer Bannon. Lonnie, teenaged orphan son of Hud&#x27;s elder brother Norman, looks up to both men, but is most impressed by Hud. Both young men are attracted to the Bannons&#x27; earthy housekeeper, Alma. Although she finds Hud physically attractive, Alma keeps her distance because she has been mistreated in the past by self-centered men.
 
After one of their cows suddenly dies, Homer sends Lonnie to town to bring Hud to the ranch for his opinion. Lonnie finds Hud, only to have his wastrel uncle shift the blame onto him for his tryst with a married woman. Back at the ranch, Hud drives over Alma&#x27;s flowers. He shoots several buzzards to scare the flock away from the dead cow, against his father&#x27;s protestations that they keep the land clean and killing them is illegal. True to form, Hud claims immunity to laws that inconvenience him. Hud is annoyed by his father&#x27;s decision to summon the state veterinarian, pushing for unloading the cattle to unsuspecting neighbors before the news spreads; otherwise, government agents will kill the entire herd and destroy everything they have worked for. He blames his father for not realizing that the Mexican herd he recently purchased was sick before he bought them. Homer is revolted by Hud&#x27;s suggestions. After a quick inspection the veterinarian immediately quarantines the ranch for a possible outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. Aware that a positive test may cost him everything, Homer nevertheless complies.

One night Hud takes Lonnie out drinking, with the pair proving a successful tag-team in a barroom brawl. Back at the ranch Hud regales how he and Lonnie&#x27;s father did the same thing as kids, revealing in a rare unguarded moment his role in the death of his brother and his father&#x27;s antipathy toward him. When they enter the house, Homer confronts Hud, accusing him of trying to corrupt Lonnie. They argue, with Hud accusing Homer of hypocrisy and resentment of him for causing Norman&#x27;s death. Homer replies that his disappointment in Hud began long before that, over his caring for no one and nothing but himself. Hurt and angry, Hud retorts that his Mama loved him, but she died. When Lonnie tells Homer that he was too hard on Hud and other people behave like him, Homer replies that one day Lonnie will have to decide for himself what is right and wrong.

After learning from Lonnie that Hud is trying to have him declared incompetent and seize the ranch, Homer confronts a drunken Hud. Homer asserts he will lose. He admits that he made mistakes raising Hud, and was too hard on him. When Hud accuses him of having a &quot;shape up or ship out&quot; policy, Homer wonders aloud how a man like Hud can be his son and storms off to his room. Hud, drunk and angry, goes to Alma&#x27;s room and attempts to rape her before Lonnie comes to her aid.

When the Bannon&#x27;s herd tests positive for foot-and-mouth, the veterinarian orders it to be destroyed and buried on the ranch under state supervision to keep the disease from spreading. Hud suggests selling some leases to drill for untapped oil on their land to keep the ranch profitable, but Homer refuses, stating he only has pride in what he earns through hard work with his own hands.

After the cattle have been killed, the state veterinarian and his assistant drive up to the ranch and notice that two Longhorns are still alive, a single pair of a dying breed Homer keeps for sentimental reasons. The assistant gets his rifle, with the intention of killing them. Homer stops him and tells him he will take care of it himself. The assistant curtly expresses doubts Homer will be able to go through with it. Hud soundly defends his father&#x27;s word, snapping, &quot;He just said he would.&quot;

Having had her fill of drama, Alma decides to leave the ranch. After Lonnie drops her off at the bus stop, Hud sees her waiting. He apologizes for his drunken behavior, but not for his attraction to her, saying he would remember her as &quot;the one who got away&quot;. Driving back to the ranch Lonnie finds his grandfather lying on the side of the road, having fallen from his horse while surveying the ranch. Hud drives up, but despite their efforts Homer dies.

Lonnie is disgusted by Hud&#x27;s treatment of Homer and Alma and pulls stakes after his grandfather&#x27;s funeral, uncertain if he will ever return. After Lonnie tells his uncle to put his half of their inheritance in the bank, Hud replies that Lonnie now sees him as Homer did. As Lonnie walks away, Hud, now alone, retreats into the family house.

==Production==
===Development===
After working together on other projects, director Martin Ritt and Paul Newman co-founded Salem Productions and the company made a three-film deal with Paramount Studios. For its first film, Salem hired husband-and-wife scriptwriters Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr., who had worked with Ritt and Newman on &quot;The Long, Hot Summer&quot;. Ravetch found Larry McMurtry&#x27;s novel, &quot;Horseman, Pass By&quot;, in an airport shop during a Dallas stopover and presented the project to Ritt and Newman after reading a description of Hud Bannon. The partners met Ravetch and Frank at their home, approved the project, and the writers adapted the script.

Although McMurtry&#x27;s novel focuses on Lonnie Bannon, Ravetch and Frank expanded Hud&#x27;s character to the lead role. Ritt wanted Hud to be an antihero who did not regret his actions at the end of the film. He was changed from Homer&#x27;s stepson to his son, and the character of Homer&#x27;s wife was eliminated. Newman and Ritt initially named the project &quot;Wild Desire&quot;, followed by &quot;The Winners&quot;, &quot;Hud Bannon Against the World&quot;, &quot;Hud Bannon&quot; and finally &quot;Hud&quot;. Ravetch and Frank accompanied Ritt and Newman through preproduction, casting, and publicity design.

Ritt asked that the housekeeper character (originally Halmea, a black woman) be renamed Alma and played by a white actress, because he thought a relationship between Hud and a black woman would not work. According to Ravetch and Frank, &quot;Neither American Western film nor American society was quite ready for that back then.&quot; Although Halmea is assaulted by Hud in the novel, Ravetch and Frank added Lonnie&#x27;s intervention to &quot;highlight&quot; his significance and keep Hud &quot;human&quot; and not &quot;totally and simplistically evil.&quot; To accentuate the scene&#x27;s violence, Hud&#x27;s roughness was complemented by the use of shadows, while a camera was attached on Newman&#x27;s back to create a &quot;man&#x27;s view angle&quot; while he chased Neal. Film critic Pauline Kael described Neal&#x27;s performance as &quot;perhaps the first female equivalent of the white-negro.&quot;

Cinematographer James Wong Howe shot &quot;Hud&quot; in black-and-white to &quot;elevate its dramatic propensities.&quot; Filmed in Panavision, Howe used high contrast with unbalanced light and dark tones. He highlighted the white ground and clear skies, making the shadows black. Dark tones were &quot;overpowered&quot; by light ones, creating a sense of &quot;infinite space.&quot; For faces and structures, Howe used light reflected from the ground. The contrast between the environment and objects silhouetted against the background provides a sense of depth. Ritt&#x27;s biographer, Carlton Jackson, wrote that in &quot;Hud&quot; &quot;the scenery becomes a part of the thematic development itself.&quot; According to &quot;Texas Monthly&quot;, &quot;Howe&#x27;s austere rendition of Texas landscapes [...] remains one of the film&#x27;s most distinctive pleasures.&quot;

===Casting===
Paul Newman worked for 10 days on a Texas ranch, sleeping in a bunkhouse. For his Texas accent, he was coached by Bob Hinkle, who coached James Dean for his role as Jett Rink in &quot;Giant&quot;. Although Paramount was doubtful about casting Melvyn Douglas due to his heart condition, Martin Ritt insisted that he was the right actor for the role. Brandon deWilde was a former child actor best known at the time for his award-winning role in &quot;Shane&quot;. Ritt decided to cast Patricia Neal (whom he had met at the Actors Studio) when he was impressed by her performance in &quot;The Untouchables&quot; episode &quot;The Maggie Storm Story&quot;. The actress signed for $30,000; although she had third billing and 22 minutes of screen time. The film and her Academy Award-winning performance in it had a major impact on her career.

===Filming===
&quot;Hud&quot; was shot over a four-week period in and around the Texas Panhandle, using the town of Claude as a setting. Location filming began on May 21, 1962, and was finished by the second week of June. Outdoor scenes were filmed at the Goodnight Ranch. To avoid surpassing the shooting schedule due to weather conditions, the cast had to cancel two scenes originally planned for the location that featured people from Claude and Amarillo. The rest of the scenes were shot at the Paramount sound stages in Hollywood beginning in the first week of July. The film was completed on August 1, 1962. The pig-scramble scene, written by dialect coach Bob Hinkle, replaced a softball game in Ravetch and Frank&#x27;s script; Hinkle played the announcer in the scene. For the filming of the cattle-slaughter scene, the Humane Society was present to monitor the animals&#x27; treatment. The herd was sprayed with a substance to make it appear ill, and bungee cords were tied to the cattle&#x27;s legs. Camera angles were arranged by Ritt and Howe to avoid showing the death of the cattle. When a man was shown shooting, the camera would switch to the cattle; the crew shook the cords, creating an effect of the herd being shot. During location shooting, Newman and deWilde often changed hotel rooms due to female fans following them.

Elmer Bernstein used sparse arrangements for &quot;Hud&quot;″s score; in its theme, Bernstein &quot;insinuated&quot; natural sounds with &quot;poignant strings on the guitar.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called the theme &quot;vital and noteworthy,&quot; &quot;sombre, plaintive and foreboding.&quot;

John Ashley had a role, but it was mostly removed during the edit process.

&quot;Hud&quot;″s budget was $2.35 million, and Paramount executives were unhappy with the film. They felt it was too dark and were displeased by the black-and-white cinematography and Hud&#x27;s lack of remorse and unchanged behavior. Although Martin Rackin asked Ritt to change the film&#x27;s ending, Newman and he decided to keep the original. After &quot;Hud&quot; was previewed, Paramount considered dropping the project, feeling that it was not &quot;commercial enough,&quot; but Ritt flew to New York and convinced the executives to release the film unmodified.
Advertising posters, with Newman in blue jeans in a &quot;suggestive, full-length pose,&quot; read: &quot;Paul Newman is &#x27;Hud&#x27;! ... the man with the barbed-wire soul.&quot;

==Release and reception==
&quot;Hud&quot; was acclaimed during its premiere at the 24th Venice International Film Festival. After its general release on May 29, 1963, the film grossed $10 million at the domestic box office, earning $5 million in theatrical rentals. It was the 19th-highest-grossing film of the year. &quot;Life&quot; called &quot;Hud&quot; an &quot;arrestingalmost greatmovie&quot;, describing Paul Newman&#x27;s acting as &quot;faultless&quot;. An &quot;Outlook&quot; reviewer wrote that the four main cast members acted &quot;splendidly&quot;; Newman &quot;speaks at times with an unpleasant nasal twang, but is clearly suited to the part.&quot; They described Melvyn Douglas&#x27; performance as &quot;impeccable&quot;, Brandon deWilde&#x27;s as &quot;[successful] in looking earnest unsure of himself&quot; and praised Patricia Neal&#x27;s expressiveness. &quot;Time&quot; called the performances &quot;splendid&quot;, and Howe&#x27;s photography &quot;brings the Texas Panhandle to dusty, sweaty life.&quot; The &quot;New York Times&quot;, in a favorable review, said Ritt&#x27;s direction had &quot;[a] powerfully realistic style&quot; and called Ravetch and Frank&#x27;s work &quot;[an] excellent screenplay.&quot; The newspaper called Newman&#x27;s acting &quot;tremendous&quot;, Douglas&#x27; &quot;magnificent&quot;, deWilde&#x27;s &quot;eloquent of clean, modern youth&quot; and Patricia Neal&#x27;s &quot;brilliant.&quot; The review also praised James Wong Howe&#x27;s &quot;excellent&quot; camera work and Elmer Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;poignant&quot; score. &quot;Variety&quot; called &quot;Hud&quot; &quot;a near miss&quot;; its screenplay fails to &quot;filter its meaning and theme lucidly through its characters and story&quot;, although it called the four leads&#x27; performances &quot;excellent.&quot;

Through the character of Hud, Ritt and Newman had intended to show the corruption of modern capitalism and the pitfalls of admiring an individual blindly, without observing his character. Critics, however, did not universally echo this view. &quot;Life&quot;″s review described Hud as &quot;likable, smart, and [with] the potential to measure up to his tough, honorable father&quot; and &quot;Saturday Review&quot; called him a &quot;charming, raffish monster&quot;. According to &quot;Outlook&quot;, &quot;Hud Bannon is a mean, unscrupulous man who never has even a momentary twinge of conscience or change of heart&quot;; in the end scene, Hud &quot;[p]ulls down the shade on the world of goodness and decency&quot;. Pauline Kael initially described the film as an &quot;anti-Western&quot;; she called it an &quot;anti-American film&quot;, which was &quot;so astutely made and yet such a mess that it (was) redeemed by its fundamental dishonesty.&quot;

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic John L. Scott felt that the film was &quot;a bewildering, at times brilliant, bitter look at life in the raw&quot;. The reviewer described the relation between Hud and Homer and determined that &quot;two hours of this type of conflict can prove distasteful&quot; but he added that the &quot;vivid performances of principals&quot; and &quot;some yeoman work&quot; by Ritt &quot;are definite credits, turning &#x27;Hud&#x27; into an absorbing, if troubling, cinematic experience&quot;. Scott commented that in the film &quot;Newman gives one of his finest portrayals&quot;. Meanwhile, he deemed Douglas&#x27;s acting &quot;a powerful, wrenching portrayal&quot;. He praised Neal&#x27;s &quot;bawdy humor&quot; that &quot;combines drabness and attractiveness in quite wonderful fashion.&quot; and called De Wilde &quot;a good choice for the role&quot;. The reviewer celebrated Howe as &quot;long one of the best, with fine photography&quot;. &quot;The New York Daily News&quot; rated &quot;Hud&quot; four stars, as the publication consider the movie &quot;a rarity, a realistic film about real people, hard, stubborn cattlemen of Texas, a drama unsentimental and uncompromising in a strained relationship&quot;. The piece determined that Ritt &quot;made a picture that has nothing wrong with it&quot; and that it was &quot;storytelling at its best&quot;. The performances of Newman, De Wilde, Douglas and Neal were welcomed as &quot;uniform perfection&quot; as the review further added that they &quot;play these strong people as if they had lived them&quot;. The column concluded that &quot;Hud&quot; was &quot;a western of a rare variety, modern and effectively dramatic.&quot;

&quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; wrote that calling the film &quot;a western&quot; would put it &quot;a very specific story into a very general category&quot;. Reviewer Henry Murdock felt that &quot;Hud&quot; had &quot;a highly individualistic, arresting approach of its own.&quot; The review expressed that it was &quot;filled with good performances&quot; and that Ritt &quot;can make mood as important as action&quot;. Murdock hailed Newman and Douglas&#x27;s performance as &quot;superb as the antagonists&quot;, while he remarked De Wilde&#x27;s &quot;intuition to the role&quot;. However, the review focused on Neal&#x27;s appearance that the review considered &quot;of such courage and clarity , such understating of Hud&#x27;s character&quot; That Murdock &quot;wanted to violate all the rules of critics&#x27; behaviour by applauding her terrific performance.&quot; Meanwhile, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; attributed the main character&#x27;s behavior as &quot;one of the reasons for this pictures&#x27; power, in addition to some superior performances, is that provides no easy answers.&quot; Newman&#x27;s interpretation, that treated the role in a &quot;smoldering, shattering fashion&quot; was deemed &quot;powerful&quot;. Douglas&#x27;s appearance was seen as &quot;the perfect touch of a true professional&quot;, while De Wilde&#x27;s offered &quot;innocence and vulnerability without the slightest trace of mawkishness.&quot; The review finished crediting Ritt with &quot;an uncompromising story with economical effectiveness.&quot;

&quot;The Miami Herald&quot; praised the film, as the publication opined that Ritt produced &quot;superb performances out of his first rate cast.&quot; Critic Jack Anderson hailed Ravetch and Frank&#x27;s adaptation that offered &quot;a well balanced script&quot; and &quot;skillfully managed inter-relationship of its characters.&quot; Meanwhile, he described Howe&#x27;s capture of the Texas Panhandle as &quot;spell-binding effectiveness&quot;. While Anderson felt that the story was &quot;a depressing one&quot;, he opined that it was &quot;so well told and acted that it transcends its emotional murkiness to make it completely fascinating to watch.&quot; &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; favored Newman&#x27;s &quot;enormous range and depth&quot;. The reviewer felt that &quot;Hud&quot; was &quot;much like life&quot; as in the end &quot;Nothing is settled, no real victories are won and none of the principals undergoes a major change in character or personality&quot;. For the reviewer, Neal showed &quot;wit and allure&quot; and De Wilde appeared &quot;callow, yet wise; eager, yet restrained&quot;. The publication attributed its positive reception to Ravetch and Frank&#x27;s screenplay, as well as to Ritt&#x27;s interpretation of the material. It described Ritt&#x27;s direction as &quot;building tansion and then changing step quickly as the fury mounts&quot;. For the reviewer, &quot;Hud&quot; was &quot;enhanced considerably by the use of black and white film&quot; , while he added that the characters were &quot;so vital&quot; that &quot;color photography might have overstated the general tone&quot;.

Although Hud was conceived as an outwardly charming, but morally repugnant character, audiences, especially young people, found him likable, even admirable. Paul Newman said, &quot;We thought [the] last thing people would do was accept Hud as a heroic character ... His amorality just went over [the audience&#x27;s] head; all they saw was this Western, heroic individual&quot;. Martin Ritt later attributed audience interpretation of the character to the counterculture of the 1960s which &quot;changed the values&quot; of the young audiences who saw Hud as a hero.

MAD Magazine satirized the film as &quot;Hood&quot; in its December 1963 issue.

In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

===Later evaluation in film guides===
&quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s Movie Guide&quot; gave &quot;Hud&quot; four stars out of four. Maltin called the film &quot;An excellent story of moral degradation, with impeccable performances by all&quot;. Steven H. Scheuer&#x27;s &quot;Movies on TV&quot; also gave the film four stars out of four; Scheuer called it &quot;a must for movie-drama fans&quot;, and said the cast was &quot;superb&quot;. In &quot;Film and Video Guide&quot; Leslie Halliwell gave &quot;Hud&quot; four stars out of four, calling it &quot;unique&quot;. &quot;Allmovie&quot; gave &quot;Hud&quot; five stars out of five, calling the film &quot;a warning shot for the Sixties&quot; and saying that its &quot;generational conflict would prove prescient&quot;. It praised Howe&#x27;s cinematography, which gave the film &quot;an authentic Western feel&quot;.

===Awards and nominations===
==Preservation==
The Academy Film Archive preserved &quot;Hud&quot; in 2005. In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

<doc id="161881" wikidata="Q7886969" url="?curid=161881" title="Uniqueness type">
<text>In computing, a unique type guarantees that an object is used in a single-threaded way, with at most a single reference to it. If a value has a unique type, a function applied to it can be optimized to update the value in-place in the object code. Such in-place updates improve the efficiency of functional languages while maintaining referential transparency. Unique types can also be used to integrate functional and imperative programming.

==Introduction==
Uniqueness typing is best explained using an example. Consider a function codice_1 that reads the next line of text from a given file:

function readLine(File f) returns String
 return line where
 String line = doImperativeReadLineSystemCall(f)
 end
end

Now codice_2 reads the next line from the file using an OS-level system call which has the side effect of changing the current position in the file. But this violates referential transparency because calling it multiple times with the same argument will return different results each time as the current position in the file gets moved. This in turn makes codice_1 violate referential transparency because it calls codice_2.

However, using uniqueness typing, we can construct a new version of codice_1 that is referentially transparent even though it&#x27;s built on top of a function that&#x27;s not referentially transparent:

function readLine2(unique File f) returns (unique File, String)
 return (differentF, line) where
 String line = doImperativeReadLineSystemCall(f)
 File differentF = newFileFromExistingFile(f)
 end
end

The codice_6 declaration specifies that the type of codice_7 is unique; that is to say that codice_7 may never be referred to again by the caller of codice_9 after codice_9 returns, and this restriction is enforced by the type system. And since codice_9 does not return codice_7 itself but rather a new, different file object codice_13, this means that it&#x27;s impossible for codice_9 to be called with codice_7 as an argument ever again, thus preserving referential transparency while allowing for side effects to occur.

==Programming languages==
Uniqueness types are implemented in functional programming languages such as Clean, Mercury, SAC and Idris. They are sometimes used for doing I/O operations in functional languages in lieu of monads.

A compiler extension has been developed for the Scala programming language which uses annotations to handle uniqueness in the context of message passing between actors.

==Relationship to linear typing==
A unique type is very similar to a linear type, to the point that the terms are often used interchangeably, but there is in fact a distinction: actual linear typing allows a non-linear value to be typecast to a linear form, while still retaining multiple references to it. Uniqueness guarantees that a value has no other references to it, while linearity guarantees that no more references can be made to a value.

Linearity and uniqueness can be seen as particularly distinct when in relation to non-linearity and non-uniqueness modalities, but can then also be unified in a single type system.

<doc id="161882" wikidata="Q76824" url="?curid=161882" title="Cat Ballou">
<text>Cat Ballou is a 1965 American western comedy film starring Jane Fonda and Lee Marvin, who won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his dual role. The story involves a woman who hires a notorious gunman to protect her father&#x27;s ranch, and later to avenge his murder, only to find that the gunman is not what she expected. The supporting cast features Tom Nardini, Michael Callan, Dwayne Hickman, and Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye, who together perform the film&#x27;s theme song, and who appear throughout the film in the form of travelling minstrels or troubadours as a kind of musical Greek chorus and framing device.

The film was directed by Elliot Silverstein from a screenplay by Walter Newman and Frank Pierson adapted from the 1956 novel &quot;The Ballad of Cat Ballou&quot; by Roy Chanslor, who also wrote the novel filmed as &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot;. Chanslor&#x27;s novel was a serious Western, and though it was turned into a comedy for the film, the filmmakers retained some darker elements. The film references many classic Western films, notably &quot;Shane&quot;. The film was selected by the American Film Institute as the 10th greatest Western of all time in its AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 list in 2008.

==Plot==
Catherine &quot;Cat&quot; Ballou, a notorious outlaw, is set to be executed in the small town of Wolf City, Wyoming. Two banjo and guitar playing &quot;Shouters&quot;, Professor Sam the Shade and the Sunrise Kid, sing the ballad of Cat Ballou and regale the audience with the tale of how she began her career of crime.

Some months prior, Catherine, then an aspiring schoolteacher, is returning home by train to Wolf City from finishing school. On the way, she unwittingly helps accused cattle rustler Clay Boone elude his captor, Sheriff Maledon, when Boone&#x27;s Uncle Jed, disguised as a preacher, distracts the lawman.

Arriving home at her father Frankie Ballou&#x27;s ranch, Catherine learns that the Wolf City Development Corporation is scheming to take his ranch. Frankie&#x27;s sole defender is his ranch hand, educated Native American Jackson Two-Bears. Clay and Jed appear and reluctantly offer to help Catherine. She hires legendary gunfighter Kid Shelleen to help protect her father from gunslinger Tim Strawn, the tin-nosed hired killer who is threatening him.

Shelleen arrives and proves to be a drunken bum who is a crack shot only when he is inebriated. His presence proves to be useless, as Strawn abruptly kills Frankie. When the townspeople refuse to bring Strawn to justice, Catherine becomes a revenge-seeking outlaw, known as Cat Ballou. She and her gang rob a train carrying the Wolf City payroll, then take refuge in the desperado hideout &quot;Hole-in-the-Wall&quot;. Shelleen is shocked to discover the legendary outlaw Cassidy is, now, a humble saloonkeeper in Hole-in-the-Wall.

The gang is thrown out when it is learned what they have done, due to Hole-in-the-Wall&#x27;s continued existence being dependent on the sufferance of Wolf City. Strawn arrives and threatens Cat. Shelleen, motivated by his affection for Cat, works himself into shape. Dressed up in his finest gunfighter outfit, he goes into town and kills Strawn, then reveals he is Strawn&#x27;s brother.

Cat poses as a prostitute and confronts Sir Harry Percival, the head of the Wolf City Development Corporation. She attempts to force him into confessing that he ordered her father&#x27;s murder. A struggle ensues; Sir Harry is killed, and Cat is sentenced to be hanged. With Sir Harry dead, Wolf City&#x27;s future is hopeless, and the townspeople have no mercy for Cat. As the noose is placed around her neck, Uncle Jed, again disguised as a preacher, appears and cuts the rope just as the trapdoor opens. Cat safely falls through and onto a wagon, and her gang spirits her away in a daring rescue.

==Cast==

==Production==
&quot;Cat Ballou&quot; was director Elliot Silverstein&#x27;s second feature film, with the pressure of filming leading to some quarrels with the producer Harold Hecht, although the film was ultimately a box office success.

Ann-Margret was the first choice for the title role, but her manager turned it down without letting the actress know. Ann-Margret wrote in her autobiography that she would have taken the part. Among others, Kirk Douglas and Dick Van Dyke turned down the role of Shelleen.

The film was shot on location in Colorado, including parts of Canon City and Texas Creek, as well as the ghost towns of Rosita and Buckskin Joe. It was also filmed around the Tunnel Drive Trail and the Wet Mountain Valley.

Nat King Cole was ill with lung cancer during the filming of &quot;Cat Ballou&quot;. A chain smoker, Cole died four months before the film was released.

Jay C. Flippen suffered a circulatory failure during filming and, as a result, later had his leg amputated, due to gangrene.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Cat Ballou&quot; earned over $20.6million in North America, making it the 7th highest-grossing film of 1965.

===Critical response===

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a breezy little film&quot; which &quot;does have flashes of good satiric wit. But, under Elliott Silverstein&#x27;s direction, it is mostly just juvenile lampoon.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film &quot;emerges middlingly successful, sparked by an amusing way-out approach and some sparkling performances.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised the film as a &quot;springy satire&quot;, adding, &quot;What makes this fun is the style. Forming a mighty cool duo, Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye sing their way in and out of the plot with folk songs which Cole &#x27;Don&#x27;t Fence Me In&#x27; Porter would have relished. The format is novel and stylishly delivered.&quot; Pauline Kael in &quot;Film Quarterly&quot; called it &quot;lumpen, coy, and obvious, a self-consciously cute movie,&quot; adding that &quot;mainly it is full of sort-of-funny and trying-to-be-funny &quot;ideas&quot; and a movie is not just ideas.&quot; Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;I&#x27;m in the minority, apparently. &quot;Cat Ballou,&quot; which is being hailed as a cowboy &quot;Tom Jones&quot; or something of the sort, seems to me about as funny as a soundtrack burp.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;The jokes in &quot;Cat Ballou&quot; are uneven, but the mood behind the film is happily consistent.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
In his Oscar acceptance speech, Lee Marvin concluded by saying: &quot;I think, though, that half of this belongs to a horse somewhere out in San Fernando Valley&quot;, a reference to the horse Kid Shelleen rode, which appeared to be as drunk as Shelleen was.

==Television pilots==
Two separate television pilots were filmed. A 1970 pilot, written and produced by Aaron Ruben, featured Lesley Ann Warren as Cat, Jack Elam as Kid Shelleen and Tom Nardini repeating his role, while a 1971 pilot starred Jo Ann Harris as Cat, Forrest Tucker as Kid Shelleen and Lee J. Casey as Jackson Two-Bears.

==In popular culture==
*&quot;Cat Ballou&quot; is the favorite film of comedy directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly, as stated in The AFI &quot;100 Years, 100 Laughs&quot; television special. The Balladeers from their film, &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot;, are inspired by similar characters in &quot;Cat Ballou&quot;.
*Imagery from the hanging scene of Jane Fonda was spoofed advocating her execution for treason, following her 1972 visit to Hanoi. A brief shot from that scene was used as part of Alex DeLarge&#x27;s sadistic reverie in the movie &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;.
*&quot;Cat Ballou&quot; is a card in the Spaghetti Western board game &quot;Bang!&quot;
*In a 2014 interview on NPR, actor Bryan Cranston called &quot;Cat Ballou&quot; the &quot;movie that had the most impact&quot; on him when he was growing up.
*Part of the opening animation of the Columbia logo featuring Jane Fonda was incorporated in the beginning of &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot; (2018).
*In episode 69 of the popular fiction podcast &quot;Welcome to Night Vale&quot;, Cecil Palmer mentions that he watched this movie with his boyfriend Carlos the Scientist repeatedly. Later episodes confirm that Cecil is a fan of the film, and episode 192, &quot;It Doesn&#x27;t Hold Up&quot; features Cecil discussing the film.

<doc id="161883" wikidata="Q1049183" url="?curid=161883" title="Formal methods">
<text>In computer science, formal methods are mathematically rigorous techniques for the specification, development, analysis, and verification of software and hardware systems. The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design.

Formal methods employ a variety of theoretical computer science fundamentals, including logic calculi, formal languages, automata theory, control theory, program semantics, type systems, and type theory.

==Uses==

Formal methods can be applied at various points through the development process.

===Specification===

Formal methods may be used to give a formal description of the system to be developed, at whatever level of detail desired. Further formal methods may depend on this specification to synthesize a program or to verify the correctness of a system. 

Alternatively, specification may be the only stage in which formal methods is used. By writing a specification, ambiguities in the informal requirements can be discovered and resolved. Additionally, engineers can use a formal specification as a reference to guide their development processes.

The need for formal specification systems has been noted for years. In the ALGOL 58 report, John Backus presented a formal notation for describing programming language syntax, later named Backus normal form then renamed Backus–Naur form (BNF). Backus also wrote that a formal description of the meaning of syntactically valid ALGOL programs was not completed in time for inclusion in the report, stating that it &quot;will be included in a subsequent paper.&quot; However, no paper describing the formal semantics was ever released.

===Synthesis===

Program synthesis is the process of automatically creating a program that conforms to a specification. Deductive synthesis approaches rely on a complete formal specification of the program, whereas inductive approaches infer the specification from examples. Synthesizers perform a search over the space of possible programs to find a program consistent with the specification. Because of the size of this search space, developing efficient search algorithms is one of the major challenges in program synthesis.

===Verification===

Formal verification is the use of software tools to prove properties of a formal specification, or to prove that a formal model of a system implementation satisfies its specification.

Once a formal specification has been developed, the specification may be used as the basis for proving properties of the specification, and by inference, properties of the system implementation.

==== Sign-off verification ====
Sign-off verification is the use of a formal verification tool that is highly trusted. Such a tool can replace traditional verification methods (the tool may even be certified).

====Human-directed proof====
Sometimes, the motivation for proving the correctness of a system is not the obvious need for reassurance of the correctness of the system, but a desire to understand the system better. Consequently, some proofs of correctness are produced in the style of mathematical proof: handwritten (or typeset) using natural language, using a level of informality common to such proofs. A &quot;good&quot; proof is one that is readable and understandable by other human readers.

Critics of such approaches point out that the ambiguity inherent in natural language allows errors to be undetected in such proofs; often, subtle errors can be present in the low-level details typically overlooked by such proofs. Additionally, the work involved in producing such a good proof requires a high level of mathematical sophistication and expertise.

====Automated proof====
In contrast, there is increasing interest in producing proofs of correctness of such systems by automated means. Automated techniques fall into three general categories:
* Automated theorem proving, in which a system attempts to produce a formal proof from scratch, given a description of the system, a set of logical axioms, and a set of inference rules.
* Model checking, in which a system verifies certain properties by means of an exhaustive search of all possible states that a system could enter during its execution.
* Abstract interpretation, in which a system verifies an over-approximation of a behavioural property of the program, using a fixpoint computation over a (possibly complete) lattice representing it.

Some automated theorem provers require guidance as to which properties are &quot;interesting&quot; enough to pursue, while others work without human intervention. Model checkers can quickly get bogged down in checking millions of uninteresting states if not given a sufficiently abstract model.

Proponents of such systems argue that the results have greater mathematical certainty than human-produced proofs, since all the tedious details have been algorithmically verified. The training required to use such systems is also less than that required to produce good mathematical proofs by hand, making the techniques accessible to a wider variety of practitioners.

Critics note that some of those systems are like oracles: they make a pronouncement of truth, yet give no explanation of that truth. There is also the problem of &quot;verifying the verifier&quot;; if the program that aids in the verification is itself unproven, there may be reason to doubt the soundness of the produced results. Some modern model checking tools produce a &quot;proof log&quot; detailing each step in their proof, making it possible to perform, given suitable tools, independent verification.

The main feature of the abstract interpretation approach is that it provides a sound analysis, i.e. no false negatives are returned. Moreover, it is efficiently scalable, by tuning the abstract domain representing the property to be analyzed, and by applying widening operators to get fast convergence.

==Techniques==

Formal methods includes a number of different techniques.

===Specification languages===

The design of a computing system can be expressed using a specification language, which is a formal language that includes a proof system. Using this proof system, formal verification tools can reason about the specification and establish that a system adheres to the specification.

===Binary decision diagrams===

A binary decision diagram is a data structure that represents a Boolean function. If a Boolean formula formula_1 expresses that an execution of a program conforms to the specification, a binary decision diagram can be used to determine if formula_1 is a tautology; that is, it always evaluates to TRUE. If this is the case, then the program always conforms to the specification.

===SAT solvers=== 

A SAT solver is a program that can solve the Boolean satisfiability problem, the problem of finding an assignment of variables that makes a given propositional formula evaluate to true. If a Boolean formula formula_1 expresses that a specific execution of a program conforms to the specification, then determining that formula_4 is unsatisfiable is equivalent to determining that all executions conform to the specification. SAT solvers are often used in bounded model checking, but can also be used in unbounded model checking.

==Applications==
Formal methods are applied in different areas of hardware and software, including routers, Ethernet switches, routing protocols, security applications, and operating system microkernels such as seL4. There are several examples in which they have been used to verify the functionality of the hardware and software used in data centres. IBM used ACL2, a theorem prover, in the AMD x86 processor development process. Intel uses such methods to verify its hardware and firmware (permanent software programmed into a read-only memory). Dansk Datamatik Center used formal methods in the 1980s to develop a compiler system for the Ada programming language that went on to become a long-lived commercial product.

There are several other projects of NASA in which formal methods are applied, such as Next Generation Air Transportation System, Unmanned Aircraft System integration in National Airspace System, and Airborne Coordinated Conflict Resolution and Detection (ACCoRD).
B-Method with Atelier B, is used to develop safety automatisms for the various subways installed throughout the world by Alstom and Siemens, and also for Common Criteria certification and the development of system models by ATMEL and STMicroelectronics.

Formal verification has been frequently used in hardware by most of the well-known hardware vendors, such as IBM, Intel, and AMD. There are many areas of hardware, where Intel have used formal methods to verify the working of the products, such as parameterized verification of cache-coherent protocol, Intel Core i7 processor execution engine validation (using theorem proving, BDDs, and symbolic evaluation), optimization for Intel IA-64 architecture using HOL light theorem prover, and verification of high-performance dual-port gigabit Ethernet controller with support for PCI express protocol and Intel advance management technology using Cadence. Similarly, IBM has used formal methods in the verification of power gates, registers, and functional verification of the IBM Power7 microprocessor.

==In software development==
In software development, formal methods are mathematical approaches to solving software (and hardware) problems at the requirements, specification, and design levels. Formal methods are most likely to be applied to safety-critical or security-critical software and systems, such as avionics software. Software safety assurance standards, such as DO-178C allows the usage of formal methods through supplementation, and Common Criteria mandates formal methods at the highest levels of categorization.

For sequential software, examples of formal methods include the B-Method, the specification languages used in automated theorem proving, RAISE, and the Z notation.

In functional programming, property-based testing has allowed the mathematical specification and testing (if not exhaustive testing) of the expected behaviour of individual functions.

The Object Constraint Language (and specializations such as Java Modeling Language) has allowed object-oriented systems to be formally specified, if not necessarily formally verified.

For concurrent software and systems, Petri nets, process algebra, and finite-state machines (which are based on automata theory; see also virtual finite state machine or event driven finite state machine) allow executable software specification and can be used to build up and validate application behaviour.

Another approach to formal methods in software development is to write a specification in some form of logic—usually a variation of first-order logic—and then to directly execute the logic as though it were a program. The OWL language, based on description logic, is an example. There is also work on mapping some version of English (or another natural language) automatically to and from logic, as well as executing the logic directly. Examples are Attempto Controlled English, and Internet Business Logic, which do not seek to control the vocabulary or syntax. A feature of systems that support bidirectional English–logic mapping and direct execution of the logic is that they can be made to explain their results, in English, at the business or scientific level.

==Semi-formal methods==
Semi-formal methods are formalisms and languages that are not considered fully &quot;formal&quot;. It defers the task of completing the semantics to a later stage, which is then done either by human interpretation or by interpretation through software like code or test case generators.

Some practitioners believe that the formal methods community has overemphasized full formalization of a specification or design. They contend that the expressiveness of the languages involved, as well as the complexity of the systems being modelled, make full formalization a difficult and expensive task. As an alternative, various &quot;lightweight&quot; formal methods, which emphasize partial specification and focused application, have been proposed. Examples of this lightweight approach to formal methods include the Alloy object modelling notation, Denney&#x27;s synthesis of some aspects of the Z notation with use case driven development, and the CSK VDM Tools.

==Solvers and competitions==

Many problems in formal methods are NP-hard, but can be solved in cases arising in practice. For example, the Boolean satisfiability problem is NP-complete by the Cook–Levin theorem, but SAT solvers can solve a variety of large instances. There are &quot;solvers&quot; for a variety of problems that arise in formal methods, and there are many periodic competitions to evaluate the state-of-the-art in solving such problems.

<text>The Spy Who Came in from the Cold is a 1963 Cold War spy novel by the British author John le Carré. It depicts Alec Leamas, a British intelligence officer, being sent to East Germany as a faux defector to sow disinformation about a powerful East German intelligence officer. It serves as a sequel to le Carré&#x27;s previous novels &quot;Call for the Dead&quot; and &quot;A Murder of Quality&quot;, which also featured the fictitious British intelligence organisation, &quot;The Circus&quot;, and its agents George Smiley and Peter Guillam.

&quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; portrays Western espionage methods as morally inconsistent with Western democracy and values. The novel received critical acclaim at the time of its publication and became an international best-seller; it was selected as one of the &quot;All-Time 100 Novels&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

In 1965, Martin Ritt directed a cinematic adaptation, with Richard Burton as Leamas. Characters and events from &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; are revisited in &quot;A Legacy of Spies&quot;, le Carré&#x27;s 2017 novel centering on an ageing Guillam.

==Background==
&quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; occurs during the heightened tensions that characterised the late 1950s and early 1960s Cold War, when a Warsaw Pact–NATO war sparked in Germany seemed likely. The story begins and concludes in Berlin, about a year after the completion of the Berlin Wall and around the time when double-agent Heinz Felfe was exposed and tried.

Le Carré&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;Call for the Dead&quot;, introduced the characters George Smiley and Hans-Dieter Mundt. In that story, Smiley investigates the suicide of Samuel Fennan. He quickly establishes a link between the East German Secret Service and the deceased, and learns that Mundt, an assassin, killed the man after a misunderstanding between Fennan and their controller, Dieter Frey. Mundt escaped from England shortly after, getting back into East Germany before Smiley and Guillam could catch him. &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; picks up two years later, where Mundt has had a somewhat meteoric rise to become the head of the Abteilung, because of his success with counter-intelligence operations against British networks, as well as a member of the Presidium of the Socialist Unity Party.

Le Carré said that the inspiration for the character of Leamas came from a &quot;Peter Finch-like figure in a raincoat&quot; whom he remembered seeing pull out a wad of foreign currencies at London Airport, demanding a large Scotch; an &quot;archetypal secret agent figure – exhausted, barely knows what country he&#x27;s in, much-travelled, down on his luck.&quot; He was also inspired by &quot;The Darkroom of Damocles&quot; by Dutch writer Willem Frederik Hermans; Hermans famously disparaged le Carré and accused him of plagiarism.

==Plot==
During the Cold War, Alec Leamas, a former SOE operative who fought in the Netherlands and Norway, runs a sizeable East German intelligence ring through his posting as Station Head of Berlin Station. Hans-Dieter Mundt, a former low level Abteilung officer who murdered Samuel Fennan a few years prior, has risen to power in the counterintelligence section and systematically eradicates the network. Leamas attempts to save Karl Riemeck, his final undercover source and member of the praesidium of the Socialist Unity Party, but fails, witnessing his death as he attempts to cross into West Germany. With his network destroyed, Leamas returns to London and visits the Circus&#x27; elusive chief, Control, to sanction his return &quot;from the cold&quot; and retirement. Instead, Control requests he stay in play for one final operation; a simulated defection to East Germany to frame Mundt as a double agent. Control explains that Mundt&#x27;s deputy, Jens Fiedler, suspects his superior may be a turncoat for western intelligence services and could tip the balance in favour of ousting Mundt from power. In exchange for his success, Leamas will retain anything he makes on the mission, a pension pot, and will receive official sanction to retire from the Service.

In order to attract the attention of East German intelligence, Control organises Leamas&#x27; demotion to the finance department. Leamas begins to show signs of alcoholism and is eventually dismissed for fraudulent activity with Circus accounts. Leamas is forced onto the dole, lives in a substandard flat, and eventually starts working in a run-down library around local CPGB secretary Liz Gold. Leamas and Gold gradually strike up a friendship and eventually become lovers. After a period of illness reveals the extent of Liz&#x27;s feelings for him, Leamas confesses he will soon be forced to say goodbye and she must not look for him. A few days later, he says goodbye, and takes the &quot;final plunge&quot; into Control&#x27;s plan, getting arrested for assault and sentenced to three months in prison. Before fully involving himself in the scheme, however, he forces Control to promise to keep Liz out of the Circus&#x27; plans.

Following his release, Leamas is approached by a recruiter who claims to know him from Berlin. He lets Leamas stay at his home, before introducing him to a contact who takes Leamas to the Netherlands on a forged passport. There, an Abteilung agent interrogates Leamas at a safe house before smuggling him into East Germany. Leamas is gradually exposed to more senior officials within the Abteilung, during which he drops hints about ongoing payments to a double agent. In Britain, Liz is suddenly visited by a-now-retired George Smiley, who tells her to come to him should she need anything, inquires about her relationship with Leamas, and pays off the outstanding rent on Leamas&#x27; flat.

After rigorous interrogations, Leamas is moved to an isolated property and held under guard, where he is finally introduced to Jens Fiedler. His days consist largely of extended interviewing about his previous Circus work while hiking alongside Fiedler or a guard. In their time together, both men end up regularly debating the philosophical distinctions between Leamas&#x27; pragmatism and Fiedler&#x27;s idealism of life in the DDR. Through these debates, Leamas interprets Fiedler to be inherently concerned about the righteousness of his actions and their impacts on the country. In contrast, Mundt is portrayed by Fiedler as an opportunistic mercenary who abandoned the Nazis and &#x27;became&#x27; a Communist out of self-preservation. As the pair get closer, Fiedler also conveys his fears about Mundt&#x27;s long standing anti-semitism affecting him, a Jewish man. Near the end of Fiedler&#x27;s interrogations, the power struggle in the Abteilung escalates when Mundt abruptly arrests Fiedler and Leamas. In the panic Leamas inadvertently kills an East German guard, and awakes in Mundt&#x27;s facility, where Mundt interrogates and tortures both men. It is then revealed, however, that Fiedler had also submitted an arrest warrant for Mundt, leading the East German régime to intervene and convene a court. Fiedler and Mundt are both released, and then summoned to present their cases to a tribunal convened &quot;in camera.&quot; During the trial, Leamas further elaborates on previous mentions of undercover payments to a foreign agent in bank accounts which match locations that Mundt had travelled to, while Fiedler presents other evidence implicating Mundt to be a British agent.

While Leamas is away, Liz receives an invitation from the East Germans to participate in an exchange of party members with the British Communist Party. Surprisingly, she is summoned by Mundt&#x27;s attorney as a witness and forced to testify at the tribunal. She then admits Smiley paid the apartment lease, and that Smiley offered help should she need it. She also confesses that Leamas made her promise not to look for him, and that he said goodbye immediately before he assaulted the grocer. Leamas, realising his cover has been blown, offers to tell them about the mission in exchange for Liz&#x27;s freedom, but realises the true nature of the scheme during the course of the tribunal. Fiedler is then arrested at the tribunal&#x27;s end.

Immediately after the trial, Mundt subtly locates and then releases Leamas and Liz from jail, and gives them a car to get from their current location to the Berlin Wall. During the drive, Leamas explains the entire situation to a bemused Liz. Mundt is actually a British double agent, who reports to Smiley, who is actually undercover in the mission and pretending to be retired. Mundt was turned against the East Germans before he returned following the murder of Samuel Fennan a few years earlier, and the mission&#x27;s true target was Fiedler, who was closing on exposing Mundt as a double agent. On account of Leamas’ and Liz&#x27;s intimate relationship, however, Mundt (and Smiley) were provided with the means of discrediting Leamas&#x27; ability to provide evidence to the tribunal, and as such discredit Fiedler. Liz, however, is shaken, and realises that her actions have enabled the Circus to protect their asset Mundt at the expense of the thoughtful and idealistic Fiedler. When asked what will become of Fiedler, Leamas replies that he will be shot.

Although disgusted, Liz overcomes this on account of her love for Leamas. The two drive to the Berlin wall, and make a break for West Germany by ascending the wall and through a section of sabotaged barbed wire atop the wall. Leamas reaches the top, but as he reaches down to help Liz, she is shot and killed by one of Mundt&#x27;s operatives. She falls back down, and as Smiley calls to Leamas from the other side of the wall, he hesitates, before eventually descending the wall on the East German side to die.

==Cultural impact==
At its publication during the Cold War, the moral presentation of &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; rendered it a revolutionary espionage novel by showing the intelligence services of both the Eastern and Western nations as engaging in the same expedient amorality in the name of national security. Le Carré also presents his western spy as morally burnt-out.

The espionage world of Alec Leamas portrays love as a three-dimensional emotion that can have disastrous consequences for those involved. Good does not always vanquish evil in Leamas&#x27;s world, a defeatist attitude that was criticised in &quot;The Times&quot;.

In 1990, the Crime Writers&#x27; Association ranked the novel third in their list The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time. Five years later in a similar list by Mystery Writers of America the novel was ranked sixth.&quot; Time&quot; magazine, while including &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; in its top 100 novels list, stated that the novel was &quot;a sad, sympathetic portrait of a man who has lived by lies and subterfuge for so long, he&#x27;s forgotten how to tell the truth.&quot; The book also headed the &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;″s list of 15 top spy novels in 2006.

According to Jon Stock, writing in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;: &quot;The plot of &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; is assembled with more precision than a Swiss watch. The heartless way in which Alec Leamas is manipulated; Control&#x27;s ruthless playing of Mundt and Fiedler; and of course the dramatic ending on the Berlin Wall, immortalised in the film starring Richard Burton. My favourite le Carré, it gets better with each re-read.&quot;

==Adaptations==
In 1965, Martin Ritt directed the film adaptation, with Richard Burton as Leamas, Oskar Werner as Fiedler, and Claire Bloom as Nan Perry, a renaming of the character of Liz Gold.

In 2016, Paramount Television and The Ink Factory – who produced television adaptations of Le Carré&#x27;s &quot;The Night Manager&quot; – announced that they were developing a limited series based on &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot;, with Simon Beaufoy as the writer. On 14 January 2017, AMC and the BBC joined with The Ink Factory for the series.

In 2024, David Eldridge wrote a theatrical adaptation of the novel which played in the Minerva Theatre at Chichester Festival Theatre, running from 23 August to 21 September 2024. It starred Rory Keenan as Alec Leamas, Agnes O&#x27;Casey as Liz Gold and John Ramm as George Smiley, directed by Jeremy Herrin. In a mostly positive review for The Times Literary Supplement, theatre critic Jim Keaveney notes that the role of Smiley is significantly &quot;recast&quot; in Eldridge&#x27;s version: &quot;Smiley does not fulfil the peripheral role le Carré provided for him. Instead he is central to the intrigue.&quot;

==Related novels==
&quot;A Legacy of Spies&quot;, le Carré&#x27;s 2017 novel, recounts the backstory to &quot;The Spy Who Came in From the Cold&quot; within a modern-day frame story told from the point of view of Peter Guillam.

&quot;Karla&#x27;s Choice&quot;, a 2024 Le Carré continuation novel by Nick Harkaway, the son of le Carré, takes place not long after that of &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot;. Harkaway re-creates several of the original book&#x27;s main characters, especially George Smiley, in the context of le Carré&#x27;s later novels. Harkaway&#x27;s book takes as one of its themes the various characters&#x27; recriminations over Leamas&#x27;s death.

==Awards and nominations==
Le Carré&#x27;s book won a 1963 Gold Dagger award from the Crime Writers&#x27; Association for &quot;Best Crime Novel&quot;. Two years later the US edition was awarded the Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for &quot;Best Mystery Novel&quot;. It was the first work to win the award for &quot;Best Novel&quot; from both mystery writing organisations. Screenwriters Paul Dehn and Guy Trosper, who adapted the book for the 1965 movie, received an Edgar the following year for &quot;Best Motion Picture Screenplay&quot; for an American movie.

In 2005, the fiftieth anniversary of the Dagger Awards, &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; was awarded the Dagger of Daggers, a one-time award given to the Golden Dagger winner regarded as the stand-out among all fifty winners over the history of the Crime Writers&#x27; Association.

<text>The Isabelle automated theorem prover is a higher-order logic (HOL) theorem prover, written in Standard ML and Scala. As a Logic for Computable Functions (LCF) style theorem prover, it is based on a small logical core (kernel) to increase the trustworthiness of proofs without requiring, yet supporting, explicit proof objects.

Isabelle is available inside a flexible system framework allowing for logically safe extensions, which comprise both theories and implementations for code-generating, documenting, and specific support for a variety of formal methods. It can be seen as an integrated development environment (IDE) for formal methods. In recent years, a substantial number of theories and system extensions have been collected in the Isabelle &quot;Archive of Formal Proofs&quot; (Isabelle AFP)

Isabelle was named by Lawrence Paulson after Gérard Huet&#x27;s daughter.

The Isabelle theorem prover is free software, released under the revised BSD license.

==Features==
Isabelle is generic: it provides a meta-logic (a weak type theory), which is used to encode object logics like first-order logic (FOL), higher-order logic (HOL) or Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC). The most widely used object logic is Isabelle/HOL, although significant set theory developments were completed in Isabelle/ZF. Isabelle&#x27;s main proof method is a higher-order version of resolution, based on higher-order unification.

Though interactive, Isabelle features efficient automatic reasoning tools, such as a term rewriting engine and a tableaux prover, various decision procedures, and, through the Sledgehammer proof-automation interface, external satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers (including CVC4) and resolution-based automated theorem provers (ATPs), including E, SPASS, and Vampire (the Metis proof method reconstructs resolution proofs generated by these ATPs). It also features two model finders (counterexample generators): Nitpick and Nunchaku.

Isabelle features locales which are modules that structure large proofs. A locale fixes types, constants, and assumptions within a specified scope so that they do not have to be repeated for every lemma. 

Isar (&quot;intelligible semi-automated reasoning&quot;) is Isabelle&#x27;s formal proof language. It is inspired by the Mizar system.

==Example proof==
Isabelle allows proofs to be written in two different styles, the procedural and the declarative. Procedural proofs specify a series of tactics (theorem proving functions/procedures) to apply. While reflecting the procedure that a human mathematician might apply to proving a result, they are typically hard to read as they do not describe the outcome of these steps. Declarative proofs (supported by Isabelle&#x27;s proof language, Isar), on the other hand, specify the actual mathematical operations to be performed, and are therefore more easily read and checked by humans.

The procedural style has been deprecated in recent versions of Isabelle.

For example, a declarative proof by contradiction in Isar that the square root of two is not rational can be written as follows.
 sqrt2_not_rational:
 
 ?x = 
 m n :: nat 
 sqrt_rat: lowest_terms: 
 (rule Rats_abs_nat_div_natE)
 (auto simp add: power2_eq_square)
 eq: of_nat_eq_iff power2_eq_square fastforce
 simp
 simp
 k ..
 eq simp
 simp
 simp
 (rule gcd_greatest)
 lowest_terms simp
 False odd_one blast


==Applications==
Isabelle has been used to aid formal methods for the specification, development and verification of software and hardware systems.

Isabelle has been used to formalize numerous theorems from mathematics and computer science, like Gödel&#x27;s completeness theorem, Gödel&#x27;s theorem about the consistency of the axiom of choice, the prime number theorem, correctness of security protocols, and properties of programming language semantics. Many of the formal proofs are, as mentioned, maintained in the Archive of Formal Proofs, which contains (as of 2019) at least 500 articles with over 2 million lines of proof in total.

* In 2009, the L4.verified project at NICTA produced the first formal proof of functional correctness of a general-purpose operating system kernel: the seL4 (secure embedded L4) microkernel. The proof is constructed and checked in Isabelle/HOL and comprises over 200,000 lines of proof script to verify 7,500 lines of C. The verification covers code, design, and implementation, and the main theorem states that the C code correctly implements the formal specification of the kernel. The proof uncovered 144 bugs in an early version of the C code of the seL4 kernel, and about 150 issues in each of design and specification.

* The definition of the programming language Lightweight Java was proven type-sound in Isabelle.

Larry Paulson keeps a list of research projects that use Isabelle.

==Alternatives==

<text>The Pawnbroker (1961) is a novel by Edward Lewis Wallant which tells the story of Sol Nazerman, a concentration camp survivor who suffers flashbacks of his past Nazi imprisonment as he tries to cope with his daily life operating a pawn shop in East Harlem. It was adapted into a motion picture by Sidney Lumet.

Nazerman is a bulky man, 45 years old, who before the war had been a professor at the University of Kraków. He has dealt with his trauma by deliberately shutting down his emotions, with the result that he sees everyone around him, especially the desperate people who come into his shop, as &quot;scum.&quot; Nazerman is plagued by nightmares and headaches stemming from the physical and mental trauma of his wartime experiences, in which his wife was forced into prostitution and his son drowned in the excrement of a cattle car on the way to the concentration camp.

Having lost his family in the camps, Sol now lives with his sister Bertha in the suburb of Mt. Vernon. She has married a mid-westerner and prizes her &quot;American&quot;-looking blonde haired daughter over her more Jewish-looking son. He is also taking care of his best friend&#x27;s widow, Tessie, and her dying father, Mendel. Sol supports both families through the pawnshop, which is in reality a front for Mafia money.

The novel deals not only with the after-effects of the camp experience, but also with making a parallel between the desperation of the residents of Harlem and that of the people in the camps. The major characters include Sol&#x27;s Latino assistant, Jesus Ortiz, and a recently arrived social worker, Marilyn Birchfield. There are numerous minor characters who are local Harlem residents, some of whom treat Sol with affection and receive only indifference in return.

The climax of the story occurs on the anniversary of Sol&#x27;s family&#x27;s death and forces him to confront his own emotions, including his guilt over having survived and his desire to die. The novel details the relationship with Sol&#x27;s nephew, a troubled young man with whom he achieves a bond.

<text>HOL (Higher Order Logic) denotes a family of interactive theorem proving systems using similar (higher-order) logics and implementation strategies. Systems in this family follow the LCF approach as they are implemented as a library which defines an abstract data type of proven theorems such that new objects of this type can only be created using the functions in the library which correspond to inference rules in higher-order logic. As long as these functions are correctly implemented, all theorems proven in the system must be valid. As such, a large system can be built on top of a small trusted kernel.

Systems in the HOL family use ML or its successors. ML was originally developed along with LCF as a meta-language for theorem proving systems; in fact, the name stands for &quot;Meta-Language&quot;.

==Underlying logic==
HOL systems use variants of classical higher-order logic, which has simple axiomatic foundations with few axioms and well-understood semantics.

The logic used in HOL provers is closely related to Isabelle/HOL, the most widely used logic of Isabelle.

==HOL implementations==
A number of HOL systems (sharing essentially the same logic) remain active and in use:

# HOL4 the only presently maintained and developed system stemming from the HOL88 system, which was the culmination of the original HOL implementation effort, led by Mike Gordon. HOL88 included its own ML implementation, which was in turn implemented on top of Common Lisp. The systems that followed HOL88 (HOL90, hol98 and HOL4) were all implemented in Standard ML; while hol98 is coupled to Moscow ML, HOL4 can be built with either Moscow ML or Poly/ML. All come with large libraries of theorem proving code which implement extra automation on top of the very simple core code. HOL4 is BSD licensed.
# HOL Light an experimental &quot;minimalist&quot; version of HOL which has since grown into another mainstream HOL variant; its logical foundations remain unusually simple. HOL Light, originally implemented in Caml Light, now uses OCaml. HOL Light is available under the new BSD license.
# ProofPower a collection of tools designed to provide special support for working with the Z notation for formal specification. 5 of the 6 tools are GNU GPL v2 licensed. The sixth (PPDaz) has a proprietary license.
# HOL Zero a minimalist implementation focused on trustworthiness. HOL Zero is GNU GPL 3+ licensed.
# Candle An end-to-end verified HOL Light implementation on top of CakeML.

==Formal proof developments==
The CakeML project developed a formally proven compiler for ML. Previously, HOL was used to develop a formally proven Lisp implementation running on ARM, x86 and PowerPC.

HOL was also used to formalize the semantics of x86 multiprocessors as well as the machine code for Power ISA and ARM architectures.

<text>Douglas Eaglesham Dunn, OBE (born 23 October 1942) is a Scottish poet, academic, and critic. He is Professor of English and Director of St Andrew&#x27;s Scottish Studies Institute at St Andrew&#x27;s University.

==Background==
Dunn was born in Inchinnan, Renfrewshire. He was educated at the Scottish School of Librarianship, and worked as a librarian before he started his studies in Hull. After graduating with a First Class Honours degree from the University of Hull, he worked in the university&#x27;s Brynmor Jones Library under Philip Larkin. He was friendly with Larkin and admired his poetry, but did not share his political opinions.

He was a Professor of English at the University of St Andrews from 1991, becoming Director of the University&#x27;s Scottish Studies Centre in 1993 until his retirement in September 2008. He is now an Honorary Professor at St Andrews, still undertaking postgraduate supervision in the School of English. He was a member of the Scottish Arts Council (1992–1994). He holds an honorary doctorate (LL.D., law) from the University of Dundee, an honorary doctorate (D.Litt., literature) from the University of Hull and St Andrews. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1981, and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 2003. 

&quot;Terry Street&quot;, Dunn&#x27;s first collection of poems, appeared in 1969 and received a Scottish Arts Council Book Award as well as a Somerset Maugham Award. Evoking his time working in Hull, the poems take as their inspiration working class life on a street of back-to-backs just off the Beverley Road (the street remains today, but all of the houses have been replaced).

<text>Oskar Werner (; born Oskar Josef Bschließmayer; 13 November 1922 – 23 October 1984) was an Austrian stage and cinema actor who reached international fame. His most prominent roles include two 1965 films, &quot;The Spy Who Came In from the Cold&quot; and &quot;Ship of Fools.&quot; For the latter Werner received an Oscar nomination. Other notable films include &quot;Decision Before Dawn&quot; (1951), &quot;Jules and Jim&quot; (1962), &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; (1966), &quot;The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot; (1968) and &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; (1976).

Werner accepted both stage and film roles throughout his career. He won a New York Film Critics Circle Award, a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor and was nominated two additional Golden Globes, as well as two BAFTA Awards, and an Academy Award, among other honors.

==Early life==
Born in Vienna, Werner spent much of his childhood in the care of his grandmother, who entertained him with stories about the Burgtheater, the Austrian state theatre, where he was accepted at the age of 18 by Lothar Müthel. He was the youngest person to receive this recognition. He made his theatre debut using the stage name Oskar Werner in October 1941.

In December 1941, Werner was drafted into the Deutsche Wehrmacht. As a pacifist and staunch opponent of National Socialism, he was determined to avoid advancement in the army: 
He was assigned to peeling potatoes and cleaning latrines instead of being sent to the Eastern Front. In 1944, he secretly married actress , who was half Jewish.

They had a daughter Eleanore. That December, he deserted the Wehrmacht and fled with his wife and daughter to the Wienerwald (Vienna Woods), where they remained in hiding until the end of the war. He would later remember, &quot;The artillery fire was constant for two and a half days. The shells hit all around our little hut and it was shaking like a leaf ... We knew that to go out there would be suicide, but it was better than to have to wait for execution.&quot;

==Career==
===Early===
Werner returned to the Burgtheater and acted in productions at the Raimund Theater and the Theater in der Josefstadt, frequently playing character roles. He made his film debut in &quot;Der Engel mit der Posaune&quot;, directed by Karl Hartl, in 1948. The following year he portrayed Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s nephew Karl in &quot;Eroica&quot;.

In 1950, Werner journeyed to the United Kingdom to reprise the role he had played in &quot;Der Engel mit der Posaune&quot; in its English-language version &quot;The Angel with the Trumpet&quot;, directed by Anthony Bushell. He and his wife divorced at about this time but remained friends. He appeared in a few more German-Austrian films before going to Hollywood for a lead role in the 20th Century Fox war film &quot;Decision Before Dawn&quot;.

When the subsequent roles promised by the studio failed to materialize, he returned to Europe and settled in Triesen, Liechtenstein in a home he designed and built with a friend. He returned to the stage and performed in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Danton&#x27;s Death&quot;, &quot;Henry IV&quot;, &quot;Henry V&quot;, &quot;Torquato Tasso&quot;, and &quot;Becket&quot;.

After a period of inactivity in films, Werner appeared in five in 1955, including &quot;Mozart&quot;, in which he played the title role, and &quot;Lola Montès&quot;, directed by Max Ophüls. It was not until 1962, when he appeared in &quot;Jules and Jim&quot;, that he began to draw critical acclaim and international recognition.

===Later===
Werner&#x27;s portrayal of the philosophical Dr. Schumann in the 1965 film &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; won him the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor and nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, and the BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actor. His portrayal of Fiedler in &quot;The Spy Who Came In from the Cold&quot; (1965) won him the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture and his second BAFTA nomination.

In 1966, he played a book-burning fireman Guy Montag who rebels against a controlled society in François Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; by Ray Bradbury. He played an orchestra conductor in &quot;Interlude&quot; and a Vatican priest loosely based on Pierre Teilhard de Chardin in &quot;The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot; in 1968.

In the early 1970s, Werner returned to the stage and spent time traveling in Israel, Italy, Malta, France, and the United States. He appeared in the episode of &quot;Columbo&quot; titled &quot;Playback&quot; in 1975, and the following year made his final screen appearance in &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot;, for which he received another Golden Globe nomination. He had an uncredited role as a Wehrmacht Officer in the 1974 film &quot;The Odessa File&quot;.

Werner was also set to appear in Michael Cimino&#x27;s love triangle drama &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; alongside Roy Scheider and Romy Schneider. The film was two weeks into preproduction shooting when it was halted, due to a lot of political machinations at the studio.

His last stage appearance was in a production of &quot;The Prince of Homburg&quot; in 1983, and he made his last public appearance in 1984 at the Mozart Hall in Salzburg ten days before his death.

==Personal life==
In 1944, while serving in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, Werner secretly married actress Elisabeth Kallina, who was half Jewish. The couple had a daughter, Eleanore. They divorced in 1952. In 1954, he married Anne Power, the daughter of French actress Annabella and adopted daughter of Tyrone Power. They were divorced in 1968. From 1965 to 1969, Werner was in a relationship with Diana Bennett Wanger, daughter of actress Joan Bennett, and they had one son, Felix Florian Werner, born 1966.

Werner was an alcoholic, which contributed heavily to the decline of his health and career. He was cast in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; as Captain Potzdorf, then replaced after a week, due to his drinking, by Hardy Krüger.

On 22 October 1984, he cancelled a reading at the Hotel Europäischer Hof in Marburg an der Lahn, Germany, feeling ill. He was found dead of a heart attack the following morning, at 61. He is buried in Liechtenstein.

<doc id="161891" wikidata="Q215333" url="?curid=161891" title="Carl Czerny">
<text>Carl Czerny (; ; 21 February 1791 – 15 July 1857) was an Austrian composer, teacher, and pianist of Czech origin whose music spanned the late Classical and early Romantic eras. His vast musical production amounted to over a thousand works and his books of studies for the piano are still widely used in piano teaching. He was one of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s best-known pupils and would later on be one of the main teachers of Franz Liszt.

==Early life==
===Infancy===

Carl Czerny was born in Vienna (Leopoldstadt) and was baptized in St. Leopold parish. His father was of Czech origin; his mother was Moravian. Czerny came from a musical family: his grandfather was a violinist at Nimburg, near Prague, and his father, Wenzel, was an oboist, organist and pianist. When Czerny was six months old, his father took a job as a piano teacher at a Polish manor and the family moved to Poland, where they lived until the third partition of Poland prompted the family to return to Vienna in 1795.

As a child prodigy, Czerny began playing piano at age three and composing at age seven. His first piano teacher was his father, who taught him mainly Bach, Haydn and Mozart. He began performing piano recitals in his parents&#x27; home. Czerny made his first public performance in 1800 playing Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 24 in C minor.

===Studies with Beethoven===
In 1801, Wenzel Krumpholz, a Czech composer and violinist, scheduled a presentation for Czerny at the home of Ludwig van Beethoven. Beethoven asked Czerny to play his &quot;&quot;Pathétique&quot; Sonata&quot; and &quot;Adelaide&quot;. Beethoven was impressed with the 10-year-old and accepted him as a pupil. Czerny remained under Beethoven&#x27;s tutelage until 1804 and sporadically thereafter. He particularly admired Beethoven&#x27;s facility at improvisation, his expertise at fingering, the rapidity of his scales and trills, and his restrained demeanour while performing.

Czerny&#x27;s autobiography and letters give many important references and details of Beethoven during this period. Czerny was the first to report symptoms of Beethoven&#x27;s deafness, several years before the matter became public. Of his first meeting with Beethoven, he wrote: &quot;I also noticed with that visual quickness peculiar to children that he had cotton which seemed to have been steeped in a yellowish ointment, in his ears.&quot;

Beethoven selected Czerny as pianist for the premiere of the former&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1 in 1806 and, at the age of 21, in February 1812, Czerny gave the Vienna premiere of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Emperor&quot; Piano Concerto. Czerny wrote that his musical memory enabled him to play virtually all of Beethoven&#x27;s piano works by heart without exception and, during the years 1804–1805, he used to play these works in this manner at Prince Lichnowsky&#x27;s palace once or twice a week, with the Prince calling out only the desired opus numbers. Czerny maintained a friendship with Beethoven throughout his life, and also gave piano lessons to Beethoven&#x27;s nephew Carl.

==Later career==
===Teacher and composer===
At the age of fifteen, Czerny began a very successful teaching career. Basing his method on the teaching of Beethoven, Muzio Clementi and Johann Nepomuk Hummel, Czerny taught up to twelve lessons a day in the homes of Viennese nobility. His &#x27;star&#x27; pupils included Theodor Döhler, Stephen Heller, Anna Sick, and Ninette de Belleville. In 1819, the father of Franz Liszt brought his son to Czerny, who recalled:He was a pale, sickly-looking child, who, while playing, swayed about on the stool as if drunk...His playing was... irregular, untidy, confused, and...he threw his fingers quite arbitrarily all over the keyboard. But that notwithstanding, I was astonished at the talent Nature had bestowed upon him. Liszt became Czerny&#x27;s most famous pupil. He trained the child with the works of Mozart, Beethoven, Clementi, Ignaz Moscheles and Johann Sebastian Bach. The Liszt family lived in the same street in Vienna as Czerny, who was so impressed by the boy that he taught him free of charge. Liszt was later to repay this confidence by introducing the music of Czerny at many of his Paris recitals. Shortly before Liszt&#x27;s Vienna concert of 13 April 1823 (his final concert of that season), Czerny arranged, with some difficulty (as Beethoven increasingly disliked child prodigies) the introduction of Liszt to Beethoven. Beethoven was sufficiently impressed with the young Liszt to give him a kiss on the forehead. Liszt remained close to Czerny, and in 1852 his &quot;Études d&#x27;exécution transcendante&quot; were published with a dedication to Czerny.

Czerny left Vienna only to make trips to Italy, France (in 1837, when he was assisted by Liszt) and England. After 1840, Czerny devoted himself exclusively to composition. He wrote a large number of piano solo exercises for the development of the pianistic technique, designed to cover from the first lessons for children up to the needs of the most advanced virtuoso. (see List of compositions by Carl Czerny).

===Death===
Czerny died in Vienna at the age of 66. He never married and had no near relatives. His large fortune he willed to charities (including an institution for the deaf), his housekeeper and the Society of Friends of Music in Vienna, after making provision for the performance of a Requiem mass in his memory.

==Compositions==
===Overview===

Czerny composed a very large number of pieces (more than one thousand and up to Op. 861).

Czerny&#x27;s works include not only piano music (études, nocturnes, sonatas, opera theme arrangements and variations) but also masses and choral music, symphonies, concertos, songs, string quartets and other chamber music. The better known part of Czerny&#x27;s repertoire is the large number of didactic piano pieces he wrote, such as &quot;The School of Velocity&quot; and &quot;The Art of Finger Dexterity.&quot; He was one of the first composers to use étude (&quot;study&quot;) for a title. Czerny&#x27;s body of works also include arrangements of many popular opera themes.

The majority of the pieces called by Czerny &quot;serious music&quot; (masses, choral music, quartets, orchestral and chamber music) remain in unpublished manuscript form and are held by Vienna&#x27;s Society for the Friends of Music, to which Czerny (a childless bachelor) willed his estate.

===Piano music===
Czerny&#x27;s piano sonatas show themselves as an intermediate stage between the works of Beethoven and Liszt. They blend the traditional sonata form elements with Baroque elements, such as the use of fugato, and free forms of fantasy. Recordings of these sonatas have been made by Martin Jones, Anton Kuerti and Daniel Blumenthal.

Czerny&#x27;s piano nocturnes show some of the elements present in Chopin nocturnes, such as the rhythmic fluidity and the intimate character. Chopin met Czerny in Vienna in 1828 and may have been influenced by his nocturnes.

Czerny composed approximately 180 pieces that bear the title &quot;Variations&quot;. Among them is &quot;La Ricordanza&quot;, Op 33, which Vladimir Horowitz recorded. Czerny used not only his own themes but themes from other composers as well, including Daniel Auber, Ludwig van Beethoven, Vincenzo Bellini, Anton Diabelli, Gaetano Donizetti, Joseph Haydn, Heinrich Marschner, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Niccolò Paganini, Gioachino Rossini, Franz Schubert, Carl Maria von Weber and many others. These works range from solo piano pieces to piano pieces for four, six, and eight hands, with some variations having optional accompaniment of orchestra or string quartet. Czerny sometimes combined his variations with other genres, such as fantasy, rondo, or impromptu.

Czerny was one of 50 composers who wrote a &quot;Variation on a theme of Anton Diabelli&quot; for Part II of the &quot;Vaterländischer Künstlerverein&quot; (published 1824). He also wrote a coda to round out the collection. Part I was devoted to the 33 variations supplied by Beethoven, his &quot;Diabelli Variations&quot;, Op. 120. Together with Liszt, Chopin, Henri Herz, Johann Peter Pixis and Sigismond Thalberg, Czerny was a contributor to the compendium set of variations for piano, &quot;Hexameron&quot; (1837).

===Other compositions===
The seven symphonies of Czerny began to be recorded in 1990s. In the 21st century, two new symphonies came to light (Symphony No. 6 and a large Symphony written in 1814); also two overtures (in C Minor and E Major) and some symphonic choral music (Psalm 130 and &quot;Die Macht des Gesanges&quot;).

Czerny was a prolific composer of chamber music, normally including the piano: Trios for strings and Piano, Quintets for strings and Piano, Sonatas for Violin and Piano, and also Piano Variations with Flute, Horn, and other instruments. However, there are many works without piano, including string quartets, which have enjoyed a new appreciation in recent years.

Czerny, a devout Catholic, also composed many religious pieces. These works include a number of Masses and hymns.

==Publications==
In 1842 Czerny published an autobiographical sketch, &quot;Erinnerungen aus meinem Leben&quot; (&quot;Memories from My Life&quot;). Other works by Czerny, apart from his compositions, include: his edition of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;; &quot;Letters to a young lady, on the art of playing the pianoforte&quot;; his three-volume &quot;School of Practical Composition&quot; (published as his Op. 600), of which the last volume is a treatise on orchestration; his edition of Domenico Scarlatti&#x27;s sonatas (1840); and &quot;On the proper performance of all Beethoven&#x27;s works for piano&quot; (1846), as well as several editions of Beethoven&#x27;s works for piano.

==Legacy ==
===Influence===
Czerny can be considered as a father of modern piano technique for generations of pianists, when it is taken into account that many of his students, such as Theodor Leschetizky, Franz Liszt and Theodor Kullak, also became teachers and passed on his legacy. The US music magazine &quot;The Etude&quot; presented in its issue of April 1927 an illustration (see above) showing how Czerny could be considered the father of modern piano technique and the basis of an entire generation of pianists. This list can be extended to the present day: examples of &#x27;descent&#x27; are:
* Wanda Landowska: pupil of Moritz Moszkowski ← Theodor Kullak ← Czerny;
* Sergei Prokofiev: pupil of Anna Yesipova ← Theodor Leschetizky ← Czerny;
* Claudio Arrau: pupil of Martin Krause ← Liszt ← Czerny;
* Ernő Dohnányi: pupil of István Thomán ← Liszt ← Czerny;
* Georges Cziffra: pupil of István Thomán ← Liszt ← Czerny;
* Daniel Barenboim: pupil of Edwin Fischer ← Martin Krause ← Liszt ← Czerny;
* Van Cliburn: pupil of Rildia Bee Cliburn ← Arthur Friedheim ← Liszt ← Czerny; 
* Sergei Rachmaninoff: pupil of Alexander Siloti ← Liszt ← Czerny;
* Leon Fleisher: pupil of Artur Schnabel ← Theodor Leschetizky ← Czerny;
Czerny wrote an essay on the correct performing of the piano sonatas of Beethoven, &quot;On the Proper performance of all Beethoven&#x27;s works for piano&quot; (1846). Johannes Brahms wrote about it to Clara Schumann in a letter of March 1878: &quot;I certainly think Czerny&#x27;s large pianoforte course Op. 500 is worthy of study, particularly in regard to what he says about Beethoven and the performance of his works, for he was a diligent and attentive pupil ... Czerny&#x27;s fingering is particularly worthy for attention. In fact I think that people today ought to have more respect for this excellent man&quot; In a letter written to Otto Jahn of 30 October 1852, Liszt wrote: &quot;In the twenties, when a great portion of Beethoven&#x27;s creations was a kind of Sphinx, Czerny was playing Beethoven exclusively, with an understanding as excellent as his technique was efficient and effective; and, later on, he did not set himself up against some progress that had been made in technique, but contributed materially to it by his own teaching and works.&quot;

Czerny had an influential role in defining the canon of classical piano repertoire. Volume 4 (1847) of his &quot;Theoretico-Practical Piano School&quot; listed what he considered to be the most important piano works of the previous eighty years, including works of Mozart, Clementi, Chopin, Schumann, Liszt, Schubert, Mendelssohn, and works of his own.

===Reputation===
From Czerny&#x27;s death until the end of the 20th century, negative views about his work have predominated. Robert Schumann in the &quot;Neue Zeitschrift für Musik&quot; (New Musical Gazette), said of Czerny&#x27;s op. 424: &quot;It would be difficult to find a failure of imagination greater than that of Czerny.&quot;

Liszt included several Czerny compositions in his repertoire and also dedicated his twelve &quot;Transcendental Études&quot; to Czerny. He also collaborated with Czerny on the &quot;Hexaméron&quot;. But even Liszt suggested, in an 1852 letter to Otto Jahn: &quot;It is ... a pity that, by a too super-abundant productiveness, he has necessarily weakened himself, and has not gone on further on the road of his first Sonata (Op. 7, A-flat major) and of other works of that period, which I rate very highly, as compositions of importance, beautifully formed and having the noblest tendency.&quot; In &quot;Men, Women and Pianos&quot; Arthur Loesser describes Czerny&#x27;s music as &quot;without depth, intensity, or wit, but always smooth and pretty and rather ear-tickling when played fast ... endless variety of patterns and endless monotony of import.&quot;

More positive views have been offered by musicians such as Anton Kuerti, Brahms, and Leon Botstein. Igor Stravinsky wrote about his admiration for Czerny also as a composer: &quot;As to Czerny, I have been appreciating the full-blooded musician in him more than the remarkable pedagogue.&quot;

==Early life and education ==
Alan Wolf Arkin was born in Brooklyn, a borough of New York City, on March 26, 1934, the son of teacher, painter, writer and lyricist David I. Arkin (1906–1980) (co-writer of the hit Three Dog Night song &quot;Black and White&quot;), and his wife, Beatrice (née Wortis) (1909–1991), a teacher. The family lived in Crown Heights. He was raised in a Jewish family with &quot;no emphasis on religion&quot;. His grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Ukraine, Russia, and Germany. His parents moved to Los Angeles when Alan was 11, but an 8-month Hollywood strike cost his father his job as a set designer. During the 1950s Red Scare, Arkin&#x27;s parents were accused of being Communists, and his father was fired when he refused to answer questions about his political ideology. David Arkin challenged the dismissal, but he was vindicated only after his death.

Arkin, who had been taking acting lessons since age 10, became a scholarship student at various drama academies, including one run by the Stanislavsky student Benjamin Zemach, who taught Arkin a psychological approach to acting. Arkin attended Los Angeles State College from 1951 to 1953. He also attended Bennington College.

==Career==
=== 1956–1969 ===

He started his career in the 1950s as a singer and guitarist in the folk group, The Tarriers. They had two hits in 1956–7: &quot;Cindy, Oh Cindy&quot; and &quot;Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)&quot;. They performed the latter in the 1957 musical movie, &quot;Calypso Heat Wave&quot;, and sang &quot;Choucoune&quot; in this too. Arkin went on to sing with another folk group, The Baby Sitters. Arkin was an early member of the Second City comedy troupe in the 1960s. In 1957, he made his feature film acting debut in a small role in the musical &quot;Calypso Heat Wave&quot;.

He also received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. The following year he appeared in the Vittorio De Sica sex comedy &quot;Woman Times Seven&quot; starring Shirley MacLaine, and in Terence Young&#x27;s psychological thriller film &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot; starring Audrey Hepburn.

In 1968, he starred as Inspector Jacques Clouseau in the third installment of &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; franchise, titled &quot;Inspector Clouseau&quot;, after Peter Sellers dissociated himself from the role. The film was not well-received by Sellers&#x27; fans and critics, but Penelope Gilliatt of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it &quot;an incredibly bad film, but Alan Arkin is sometimes very funny in it, especially when he doesn&#x27;t try to be.&quot; That same year, he co-starred with Sondra Locke in &quot;The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter&quot;, playing a suicidal deaf mute. For his performance, he received nominations for an Academy Award for Best Actor and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, and won a New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor.

The film opened to a lukewarm review by Roger Greenspun, and a more positive one by Vincent Canby in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Roger Ebert&#x27;s review in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; was enthusiastic, stating &quot;One of the reasons it works and is indeed a definitive reflection of America&#x27;s darker moods is that it breaks audiences down into isolated individuals, vulnerable and uncertain.&quot; Arkin also directed &quot;Fire Sale&quot; (1977).

<doc id="161896" wikidata="Q384866" url="?curid=161896" title="Herb Ritts">
<text>Herbert Ritts Jr. (August 13, 1952 – December 26, 2002) was an American fashion photographer and director known for his photographs of celebrities, models, and other cultural figures throughout the 1980s and 1990s. His work concentrated on black and white photography and portraits, often in the style of classical Greek sculpture, which emphasized the human shape.

== Early life and education ==
Ritts was born on August 13, 1952, in Brentwood, Los Angeles. His father, Herb Ritts Sr. (née Rittigstein), was a furniture designer and his mother, Shirley Ritts (née Roos), was an interior designer. Together, their furniture business helped to popularize rattan furniture in the 1950s and 1960s. Raised in an affluent Jewish family, he and his three younger siblings lived next door to actor Steve McQueen, whom he considered to be &quot;like a second father&quot;. 

At his bar mitzvah, his father gifted him with a Kodak Brownie camera. He attended Palisades High School and moved to upstate New York in 1972 to study at Bard College, where he received a degree in economics with a minor in art history. Upon graduation in 1975, he moved back to California to work as a sales representative in the family business.&quot;I’m glad I didn’t go to school for photography. Other photographers I know, Helmut Newton and Bruce Weber didn’t either. Even Steven Meisel didn’t, really—he went to fashion school. For me, the most important thing I learned was just honing my eye. [...] I was tutoring myself, I suppose. Many people who excel are self-taught&quot;.Ritts bought his first camera in 1976, a 35mm Miranda DX-3.

== Career ==
Later, while living in Los Angeles, he became interested in photography when he and friend Richard Gere, then an aspiring actor, decided to shoot some photographs in front of an old Buick. The picture gained Ritts some coverage and he began to be more serious about photography. He photographed Brooke Shields for the cover of the October 12, 1981 edition of &quot;Elle&quot; and he photographed Olivia Newton-John for her &quot;Physical&quot; album in 1981. Five years later he replicated that cover pose with Madonna for her 1986 release &quot;True Blue&quot;. That year he photographed Tina Turner for the album &quot;Break Every Rule&quot;.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Ritts photographed celebrities in various locales throughout California. Some of his subjects during this time included musical artists. He also took fashion and nude photographs of models Naomi Campbell, Stephanie Seymour, Tatjana Patitz, Christy Turlington, and Cindy Crawford, including &quot;Tatjana, Veiled Head, Tight View, Joshua Tree, 1988.&quot; Ritts&#x27; work with them ushered in the 1990s era of the supermodel and was consecrated by one of his most celebrated images, &quot;Stephanie, Cindy, Christy, Tatjana, Naomi, Hollywood, 1989&quot; taken for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

He also worked for &quot;Interview&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Allure&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Details&quot;, and &quot;Elle&quot;. Ritts took publicity portraits for &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, and &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; which appeared on magazine covers and merchandise throughout the 1990s. He published books on photography for various fashion designers.

From 1996 to 1997 Ritts&#x27; work was displayed at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, attracting more than 250,000 people to the exhibit, and in 2003 a solo exhibition was held at the Daimaru Museum, in Kyoto, Japan.

== Personal life ==
Ritts was openly gay. He was in a relationship with entertainment lawyer Erik Hyman from 1996 until his death in 2002. His parents were accepting and supportive of his sexuality. Ritts was HIV-positive. He was first diagnosed in 1989, and used alternative herbal treatments to fight his condition. He never publicly disclosed his diagnosis.

== Death ==
On December 26, 2002, Ritts died in Los Angeles from pneumonia at the age of 50. According to Ritts&#x27; publicist, &quot;Herb was HIV-positive, but this particular pneumonia was not PCP (pneumocystis pneumonia), a common opportunistic infection of AIDS. But at the end of the day, his immune system was compromised.&quot;

<doc id="161897" wikidata="Q684150" url="?curid=161897" title="Cool Hand Luke">
<text>Cool Hand Luke is a 1967 American prison drama film directed by Stuart Rosenberg, starring Paul Newman and featuring George Kennedy in an Oscar-winning performance. Newman stars in the title role as Luke, a prisoner in a Florida prison camp who refuses to submit to the system. Set in the early 1950s, it is based on Donn Pearce&#x27;s 1965 novel &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot;.

Roger Ebert called &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; an anti-establishment film shot during emerging popular opposition to the Vietnam War. Filming took place within California&#x27;s San Joaquin River Delta region; the set, imitating a prison farm in the Deep South, was based on photographs and measurements made by a crew the filmmakers sent to a Road Prison in Gainesville, Florida.

Upon its release, &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; received favorable reviews and was a box-office success. It cemented Newman&#x27;s status as one of the era&#x27;s top actors, and was called the &quot;touchstone of an era&quot;. Newman was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, Kennedy won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Pearce and Pierson were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and Lalo Schifrin was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score. In 2005, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, considering it &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film has a 100% rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, and the prison warden&#x27;s (Strother Martin) line in the film beginning with &quot;What we&#x27;ve got here is failure to communicate&quot; was listed at number 11 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes list.

==Plot==
In early 1950s Florida, decorated World War II veteran Lucas &quot;Luke&quot; Jackson drunkenly beheads several parking meters. He is sentenced to two years on a chain gang in a prison camp run by the Captain, a stern warden, and Walking Boss Godfrey, a quiet rifleman nicknamed &quot;the man with no eyes&quot; because he always wears mirrored sunglasses. There, even minor violations are punished by &quot;a night in the box&quot;, a small wooden booth in the prison yard with limited air and space.

Luke refuses to observe the established order among the prisoners and quickly runs afoul of their leader, Dragline. When the two have a boxing match, Luke is severely outmatched but refuses to acquiesce. Eventually, Dragline stops the fight, but Luke&#x27;s tenacity earns the prisoners&#x27; respect and draws the guards&#x27; attention. He later wins a poker game by bluffing with a hand worth nothing, and Dragline christens him &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot;.

After a visit from his sick mother, Arletta, Luke becomes more optimistic about his situation. He repeatedly shows defiance to the Captain and the guards, and his sense of humor and independence prove inspiring to the other prisoners. Luke&#x27;s struggle for supremacy peaks when he leads a work crew in a seemingly impossible but successful effort to complete a road-paving job in less than a day. The prisoners start to idolize him after he wins a bet that he can eat 50 hard-boiled eggs in an hour.

One evening, Luke receives notice that his mother has died. Anticipating that Luke might attempt to escape to attend the funeral, the Captain has him locked in the box. After being released, Luke becomes determined to escape. Under cover of a Fourth of July celebration, he makes his initial escape attempt. He is recaptured by local police and returned to the chain gang. The Captain has Luke fitted with leg irons and delivers a warning speech to the inmates.

Shortly afterward, Luke escapes a second time. While free, Luke mails the prison a magazine that includes a photograph of himself with two beautiful women. He is soon recaptured, beaten, returned to the prison camp, and fitted with two sets of leg irons. The Captain warns Luke that he will be killed if he ever attempts to escape again. Luke becomes annoyed by the other prisoners fawning over the magazine photo and says he faked it. At first, the other prisoners are angry, but when Luke returns after a long stay in the box and is punished by being forced to eat a massive serving of rice, the others help him finish it.

For his escape, the guards brutalize Luke to the point of exhaustion, particularly when he is forced to repeatedly dig and refill a grave-sized hole in the prison yard. He eventually breaks down and begs for mercy, losing the respect of his fellow inmates. Luke seems to succumb to cowardice and become an errand boy for the guards, but when an opportunity presents itself, he flees again by stealing a truck, with Dragline joining him. After abandoning the truck, the pair agree to separate. Luke enters a church and talks to God, whom he blames for sabotaging him so he cannot win in life. Police cars appear moments later, and Dragline arrives to tell him that he will not be hurt if he surrenders peacefully. Instead, Luke mockingly repeats the Captain&#x27;s warning speech at the police. Godfrey shoots him in the neck. Dragline carries Luke outside and surrenders, but charges at Godfrey and strangles him until he is subdued by the guards.

While Luke is loaded into the Captain&#x27;s car, Dragline tearfully implores him to live. Despite protests from local police, the Captain decides to take Luke to the distant prison infirmary instead of the local hospital to ensure Luke will not survive the trip. As the car drives away, a semi-conscious Luke weakly smiles while the tires crush Godfrey&#x27;s sunglasses. (It is implied that Luke soon dies of his injuries.)

Some time later, the prison crew works near a rural intersection close to where Luke was shot, with Dragline now wearing leg irons and a new Walking Boss supervising. Dragline and the other prisoners fondly reminisce about Luke.

==Cast==
==Production==

===Florida prison===
Pearce, a merchant seaman who later became a counterfeiter and safe cracker, wrote the novel &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; about his experiences working on a chain gang while serving in a Florida prison. A contemporary source states that he sold the story to Warner Bros. for $80,000 and received another $15,000 to write the screenplay. After working in television for over a decade, director Rosenberg chose it to make it his directorial debut in cinema. He took the idea to Jalem Productions, actor Jack Lemmon&#x27;s independent film production company. 

However, newspaper reports of the era announced that Lemmon and his producing partner, Gordon Carroll, purchased the story directly from Pearce in August 1965, for $100,000. It was also announced that it would be made at Columbia Pictures, where Jalem Productions had an existing six-picture deal, as the first film to be produced by Lemmon without his starring power. Lemmon was clear in announcing to the press that he was not going to play any role in the film. Rosenberg was also under a non-exclusive three-picture contract with Jalem Productions, before the story was purchased.

Since Pearce had no experience writing screenplays, the producers eventually hired Academy Award nominated writer Frank Pierson in March 1966, to work on the script. In May 1966, the production moved from Columbia Pictures to Warner Brothers Pictures, when Newman was signed for the role. Conrad Hall was hired as the cinematographer, while Paul Newman&#x27;s brother, Arthur, was hired as the unit production manager. Newman&#x27;s biographer, Marie Edelman Borden, wrote that the &quot;tough, honest&quot; script drew together threads from earlier movies, especially &quot;Hombre&quot;, Newman&#x27;s earlier film of 1967. Rosenberg altered the script&#x27;s original ending, adding &quot;an upbeat ending that would reprise Luke&#x27;s (and Newman&#x27;s) trademark smile.&quot;

===Casting===
Paul Newman&#x27;s character, Luke, is a decorated war veteran who is sentenced to serve two years in a Florida rural prison. He constantly defies the prison authorities, becoming a leader among the prisoners, as well as escaping multiple times. While the script was being developed, the leading role was initially considered for Jack Lemmon or Telly Savalas. Newman asked to play the leading role after hearing about the project. To develop his character, he traveled to West Virginia, where he recorded local accents and surveyed people&#x27;s behavior. George Kennedy turned in an Academy Award-winning performance as Dragline, who fights Luke and comes to respect him. During the nomination process, worried about the box-office success of &quot;Camelot&quot; and &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, Kennedy spent $5,000 on trade advertising to promote himself. He later said that thanks to the award, his salary was &quot;multiplied by ten the minute [he] won&quot;, adding, &quot;the happiest part was that I didn&#x27;t have to play only villains anymore&quot;.

Strother Martin, known for his appearances in westerns, was cast as the Captain, a prison warden depicted as a cruel and insensitive leader, severely punishing Luke for his escapes. The role of Luke&#x27;s dying mother, Arletta, who visits him in prison, was passed to Jo Van Fleet after it was rejected by Bette Davis. Morgan Woodward was cast as Boss Godfrey, a laconic, cruel and remorseless prison officer Woodward described as a &quot;walking Mephistopheles&quot;. He was dubbed &quot;the man with no eyes&quot; by the inmates for his mirrored sunglasses. The blonde Joy Harmon was cast for the scene where she teases the prisoners by washing her car after her manager, Leon Lance, contacted the producers. She auditioned in front of Rosenberg and Newman wearing a bikini, without speaking.

===Filming===
Filming began on October 3, 1966, on the San Joaquin River Delta. The set, imitating a southern prison farm, was built in Stockton, California. The filmmakers sent a crew to Tavares Road Prison in Tavares, Florida, where Pearce had served his time, to take photographs and measurements. The structures built in Stockton included barracks, a mess hall, the warden&#x27;s quarters, a guard shack and dog kennels. The trees on the set were decorated with spanish moss that the producers took to the area. The construction soon attracted the attention of a county building inspector who confused it with migrant worker housing and ordered it &quot;condemned for code violations&quot;. The opening scene where Newman cuts the parking meters was filmed in Lodi, California. The scene in which Luke is chased by bloodhounds and other exteriors were shot in Jacksonville, Florida, at Callahan Road Prison. Luke was played by a stunt actor, using dogs from the Florida Department of Corrections.

Rosenberg wanted the cast to internalize life on a chain gang and banned the presence of wives on set. After Harmon arrived on location, she remained for two days in her hotel room, and was not seen by the rest of the cast until shooting commenced. Despite Rosenberg&#x27;s intentions, the scene was ultimately filmed separately. Rosenberg instructed an unaware Harmon of the different movements and expressions he wanted. Originally planned to be shot in half a day, Harmon&#x27;s scene took three. For the part of the scene featuring the chain gang, Rosenberg substituted a teenage cheerleader, who wore an overcoat.

===Soundtrack===

The Academy Award-nominated original score was by Lalo Schifrin, who wrote tunes with a background in popular music and jazz. Some tracks include guitars, banjos and harmonicas; others include trumpets, violins, flutes and piano.

An edited version of the musical cue from the &quot;Tar Sequence&quot; (where the inmates are energetically paving the road) has been used for years as the theme music for local television stations&#x27; news programs around the world, mostly those owned and operated by ABC in the United States. Although the music was written for the film, it became more familiar for its association with TV news, in part because its staccato melody resembles the sound of a telegraph.

==Themes==
===Christian imagery===
Pierson included in his draft explicit religious symbolism. The film contains several elements based on Christian themes, including the concept of Luke as a saint who wins over the crowds and is ultimately sacrificed. Luke is portrayed as a &quot;Jesus-like redeemer figure&quot;. After winning the egg-eating bet, he lies exhausted on the table in the position of Jesus as depicted in his crucifixion, hands outstretched, feet folded over each other. After learning of his mother&#x27;s death, Luke sings &quot;Plastic Jesus&quot;. Greg Garrett also compares Luke to Jesus, in that like Jesus, he was not physically threatening to society because of his actions, and like Jesus&#x27; crucifixion, his punishment was &quot;out of all proportion&quot;.

Luke challenges God during the rainstorm on the road, telling him to do anything to him. Later, while he is digging and filling trenches and confronted by the guards, Tramp (Harry Dean Stanton) performs the spiritual &quot;No Grave Gonna Keep my Body Down&quot;. Toward the end of the film, Luke speaks to God, evoking the conversation between God and Jesus at the Garden of Gethsemane, depicted in the Gospel of Luke. In the final scene, Dragline eulogizes Luke. He explains that despite Luke&#x27;s death, his actions succeeded in defeating the system. The closing shot shows inmates working on crossroads from far above, such that the intersection is in the shape of the cross. Superimposed on this is the repaired photo Luke sent during his second escape, the creases of which also form a cross.

===Use of traffic signs and signals===
Different traffic signs are used throughout the film, complementing the characters&#x27; actions. At the beginning, while Luke cuts the heads off the parking meters, the word &quot;Violation&quot; appears. Stop signs are also seen. Instances include the road-paving scene and the last scene, where the road meets at a cross section. Traffic lights turn from green to red in the background at the time Luke is arrested, while at the end, when he is fatally wounded, a green light in the background turns red.

===&quot;Failure to communicate&quot;===
After writing the line, Pierson worried that the phrase was too complex for the warden. To explain its origin, he created a backstory that was included in the stage directions. Pierson explained that in order to advance in the Florida prison system, officers had to take criminology and penology courses at the state university, showing how the warden might know such words. Strother Martin later clarified that he felt the line was the kind that his character would very likely have heard or read from some &quot;pointy-headed intellectuals&quot; who had begun to infiltrate his character&#x27;s world under the general rubric of a new, enlightened approach to incarceration. Some authors believe that the quotation was a metaphor for the ongoing Vietnam War, which was taking place during the filming; others have applied it to corporations and even teenagers. The quotation was listed at number 11 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of the 100 most memorable movie lines.

A sample of the line is included in the Guns N&#x27; Roses songs &quot;Civil War&quot; and &quot;Madagascar&quot;. Zero Mostel paraphrases the line in &quot;The Great Bank Robbery&quot; (1969). When Strother Martin hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on April 19, 1980, he played the strict owner of a language camp for children, parodying his &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; role. He paraphrased his line from the movie as, &quot;What we have here is failure to communicate BILINGUALLY!&quot;

In Terry Pratchett&#x27;s fantasy humor novel &quot;The Truth&quot;, hired thug Mr Pin says to Charlie, a kidnapped (and not very bright) shopkeeper he is somewhat unsuccessfully training to impersonate Lord Vetinari, the chief ruler of the city-state of Ankh-Morpork, &quot;I think what we have here is a failure to communicate.&quot;

==Release and reception==
&quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; opened on October 31, 1967, at Loew&#x27;s State Theatre in New York City. The proceeds of the premiere went to charities. The film was a box-office success, grossing $16,217,773 in domestic screenings.

&quot;Variety&quot; called Newman&#x27;s performance &quot;excellent&quot; and the supporting cast &quot;versatile and competent&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film, remarking Pearce and Pierson&#x27;s &quot;sharp script&quot;, Rosenberg&#x27;s &quot;ruthlessly realistic and plausible&quot; staging and direction and Newman&#x27;s &quot;splendid&quot; performance with an &quot;unfaultable&quot; cast that &quot;elevates&quot; it among other prison films. Kennedy&#x27;s portrayal was considered &quot;powerfully obsessive&quot; and the actors&#x27; playing the prison staff, &quot;blood-chilling&quot;. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; gave &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; three-and-a-half stars. Reviewer Ann Guarino noted that the film was based on Pearce&#x27;s experience working with a chain gang and added, &quot;if the cruelties depicted are true, the film should encourage reforms&quot;. Guarino called Newman&#x27;s acting &quot;excellent&quot; and &quot;charming and likeable&quot;, and wrote that &quot;humor is supplied&quot; by Kennedy. She wrote that Arletta was &quot;played outstandingly&quot; by van Fleet, that Martin was &quot;effective&quot; as the warden and that the rest of the cast &quot;do well in their roles&quot;. For &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, Marjory Adams noted that &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; &quot;hits hard, spares no punches, deals with rough, sadistic and unhappy men&quot;. The review deemed Newman &quot;tremendously effective&quot;, and his portrayal &quot;played with perceptiveness, honesty and compassion&quot;. Adams pointed out that &quot;Kennedy stands out as unofficial leader of the convicts&quot;, she called van Fleet&#x27;s role &quot;short but poignant&quot; and Harmon&#x27;s appearance &quot;a masterpiece of woman&#x27;s inhumanity to men&quot;. According to Adams, the direction by Rosenberg was &quot;sharp, discerning and realistic&quot;.
For the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Clifford Terry wrote that the film &quot;works beautifully&quot;, adding that it is &quot;sharp, absorbing, extremely entertaining&quot;. Terry remarked on Newman&#x27;s &quot;usual competent performance&quot; and the &quot;strong support of the cast&quot;, and praised Kennedy, Martin, Askew and Woodward. Van Fleet&#x27;s acting was deemed &quot;masterfully played&quot;. Rosenberg&#x27;s direction was called &quot;diverse&quot; in its &quot;exploration of moods&quot;. Terry opined that the &quot;believable, tuned-in dialog&quot; by Pierson and Person and Conrad Hall&#x27;s &quot;sun-centered photography&quot; created a &quot;great feeling of the southern discomfort&quot;. He felt that &quot;the final 10 minutes&quot; that featured Luke&#x27;s monologue &quot;almost destroy the preceding 110&quot;, with the &quot;unlikely&quot; monologue and the &quot;artsy camera shot&quot; of the breaking of the &quot;hating overseer&#x27;s sunglasses&quot; contributing to the scene&#x27;s &quot;awkward artificiality&quot;. But &quot;everything else works&quot;, Terry wrote.

For the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, reviewer Charles Champlin called the film &quot;remarkably interesting and impressive&quot;. He wrote that &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; &quot;has its flaws&quot; that &quot;mar an otherwise special achievement&quot;, but that &quot;it still remains an achievement&quot;. He felt that the film was a &quot;triumph&quot; for Newman. Champlin deemed the scene featuring van Fleet a &quot;stunning piece of writing and acting&quot;. He called the roles of the prison staff &quot;triumphantly hateable&quot; and Kennedy &quot;superb&quot;. He called the sequence with Harmon &quot;a scene of cruel sexuality&quot; and Schifrin&#x27;s music &quot;lonely and hunting&quot;. Champlin felt that Newman&#x27;s end monologue was &quot;stagey, sentimental and redundant&quot;. He added that &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; &quot;played at the level of observable reality&quot; and that &quot;the intrusion of cinematic artifice seems wholly wrong&quot;. He wrote that the filmmakers &quot;had not reckoned their own strength at making their symbolic points&quot; but that the result was &quot;a picture with riveting impact&quot;.

&quot;Time&quot; wrote that &quot;the beauty comes from the careful building of the individuals&#x27; characters&quot;. Its review said that Rosenberg &quot;tells the story simply and directly&quot;, while lamenting the &quot;anti-climatic&quot;, &quot;unfortunate montages&quot; at the end of the film. &quot;The St. Louis Dispatch&quot; praised Kennedy&#x27;s acting as &quot;raw realism in a fine performance&quot; and Rosenberg&#x27;s work as &quot;above the cut of the ordinary chain-gang motion picture&quot;. The review praised the &quot;fluid camera, working in for telling expressions&quot; that made the prisoners &quot;merge as varied and interesting individuals&quot;. The &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot; called the film &quot;absorbing, well-thought-out&quot;. The script was deemed &quot;taut and deftly honed, flavored by humor and perceptive accents&quot; and Rosenberg&#x27;s direction &quot;smoothly flowing as it is brutally realistic and occasionally raw&quot;. Newman&#x27;s performance was hailed as &quot;sureness as style that is totally convincing&quot;; the review concluded that the film &quot;can be appreciated on any level&quot;.

===Later reviews===
 &quot;Empire&quot; rated it five stars out of five, declaring the movie one of Newman&#x27;s best performances. &quot;Slant&quot; rated the film three stars out of four. It described Newman&#x27;s role as &quot;iconic&quot;, also praising its cinematography and sound score. Allmovie praised Newman&#x27;s performance as &quot;one of the most indelible anti-authoritarian heroes in movie history&quot;. Roger Ebert included the film in his review collection &quot;The Great Movies&quot;, rating it four stars out of four. He called it a &quot;great&quot; film and also an anti-establishment one during the Vietnam War. He believed the film was a product of its time and that no major film company would be interested in producing a film of such &quot;physical punishment, psychological cruelty, hopelessness and equal parts of sadism and masochism&quot; today. He praised the cinematography, capturing the &quot;punishing heat&quot; of the location, and stated that &quot;the physical presence of Paul Newman is the reason this movie works: The smile, the innocent blue eyes, the lack of strutting&quot;, which no other actor could have produced as effectively.

Newman&#x27;s biographer Lawrence J. Quirk considered it one of Newman&#x27;s weaker performances, writing, &quot;For once, even Newman&#x27;s famed charisma fails him, for in &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; he completely lacks the charm that, say, Al Pacino in &quot;Scarecrow&quot; effortlessly exhibits when he plays a screw-up who also winds up (briefly) incarcerated.&quot; Quirk added that Newman&#x27;s performance was stronger in the second half: &quot;to be fair to Newman, he was trying his damnedest to play an impossible part, since Luke is a convict&#x27;s rationalization fantasy and never a real character&quot;. Some authors have criticized the film&#x27;s depiction of prison life at the time. In a review called &quot;Sheer Beauty in the Wrong Place&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, while praising the film&#x27;s photography, criticized the influence of the visual styles in the depictions of the prison camp. The magazine declared that the landscapes turned it into &quot;a rest camp [in which] the men are getting plenty of sleep, food and healthy outdoor exercise&quot;, and that despite the presence of the guards, it showed that there were &quot;worse ways to pay one&#x27;s debt with society&quot;. Ron Clooney also remarked that prisons &quot;were not hotels and certainly not the stuff of &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; movies&quot;.

===Awards and nominations===
===Legacy===
In 2003, AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains rated Luke the 30th-greatest hero in American cinema, and three years later, AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Cheers: America&#x27;s Most Inspiring Movies rated Cool Hand Luke number 71. In 2006, Luke was ranked 53rd in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Greatest Movie Characters&quot;. The film solidified Newman&#x27;s status as a box-office star, while the film is considered a touchstone of the era. The film was an inductee of the 2005 National Film Registry list.

An episode of the television show &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; titled &quot;Cool Hands Luke and Bo&quot; was shown with Morgan Woodward playing &quot;Colonel Cassius Claiborne&quot; the boss of a neighboring county and warden of its prison farm. He wears the trademark shades of Boss Godfrey throughout the episode.

The book was adapted into a West End play by Emma Reeves. It opened at London&#x27;s Aldwych Theatre in 2011 starring Marc Warren, but closed after less than two months, after poor reviews. The show was chosen by &quot;The Times&quot; both as &quot;Critic&#x27;s Choice&quot; and &quot;What the Critics Would Pay To See&quot;.

Nashville-based Christian alternative rock band Cool Hand Luke is named after the film.

Luke Humphries, 2024 PDC world darts champion, also uses &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; as his nickname.

<text>Clifford Parker Robertson III (September 9, 1923 – September 10, 2011) was an American actor whose career in film and television spanned over six decades. Robertson portrayed a young John F. Kennedy in the 1963 film &quot;PT 109&quot;, and won the 1968 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in the film &quot;Charly&quot;.

On television, Robertson portrayed retired astronaut Buzz Aldrin in the 1976 TV film adaptation of Aldrin&#x27;s autobiographic &quot;Return to Earth&quot;, played a fictional character based on Director of Central Intelligence Richard Helms in the 1977 miniseries &quot;&quot;, and portrayed Henry Ford in &quot;&quot; (1987). His last well-known film appearances were as Uncle Ben in the 2002–2007 &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film trilogy.

Robertson was an accomplished aviator who served as the founding chairman of the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA)&#x27;s Young Eagles Program at its inception in the early 1990s. It became the most successful aviation youth advocacy program in history.

==Early life and education==
Robertson was born in La Jolla, California, the son of Clifford Parker Robertson Jr. (1902–1968) and his first wife, Audrey Olga Robertson (&quot;née&quot; Willingham; 1903–1925). His Texas-born father was described as &quot;the idle heir to a tidy sum of ranching money&quot;. Robertson once said, &quot;[My father] was a very romantic figure – tall, handsome. He married four or five times, and between marriages he&#x27;d pop in to see me. He was a great raconteur, and he was always surrounded by sycophants who let him pick up the tab. During the Great Depression, he tapped the trust for $500,000, and six months later he was back for more.&quot;

Robertson&#x27;s parents divorced when he was one, and his mother died of peritonitis a year later in El Paso, Texas, at the age of 21. He was raised by his maternal grandmother, Mary Eleanor &quot;Eleanora&quot; Willingham (&quot;née&quot; Sawyer, 1875–1957), in California, and rarely saw his father. He graduated in 1941 from La Jolla High School, where he was known as &quot;The Walking Phoenix&quot;.

He served as a third mate in the U.S. Merchant Marine during World War II, before attending Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, and dropping out to work for a short time as a journalist.

==Career==
Robertson studied at the Actors Studio, becoming a life member. In the early 1950s he worked steadily in television, including a stint as the lead of &quot;Rod Brown of the Rocket Rangers&quot; (1953–1954). He appeared in Broadway in &quot;Late Love&quot; (1953–1954) and &quot;The Wisteria Trees&quot; (1955), the latter written by Joshua Logan.

===Columbia===
Robertson made his film debut in &quot;Picnic&quot; (1955), directed by Logan. Robertson played the role of William Holden&#x27;s best friend – a part originated on stage by Paul Newman. Newman was under contract to Warner Bros. when the film was being made and was then considered too big a star to reprise his stage performance. Logan&#x27;s wife recommended Robertson after seeing him in a revival of &quot;The Wisteria Trees&quot;, and the director remembered him from a Chicago production of &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;.

The film was a box office success and Robertson was promoted to Joan Crawford&#x27;s co-star in &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; (1956), also at Columbia Pictures, playing her mentally unstable younger lover. This meant he had to pass up the chance to replace Ben Gazzara on Broadway in &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;. However he did return to Broadway to appear in &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot; by Tennessee Williams, which only had a short run.
Robertson went to RKO to make two films: &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; (1958), an adaptation of the famous novel, co-starring Aldo Ray; and &quot;The Girl Most Likely&quot; (1958), a musical – the last film made by RKO Studios. Robertson received superb reviews for &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; on TV with Piper Laurie.

He was in Columbia&#x27;s &quot;Gidget&quot; (1959), appearing opposite Sandra Dee as the Big Kahuna. It was popular and led to two sequels, neither of which Robertson appeared in. Less successful was a war film at Columbia, &quot;Battle of the Coral Sea&quot; (1959).

In 1961, he was the third lead in Paramount&#x27;s &quot;All in a Night&#x27;s Work&quot;, starred in Samuel Fuller&#x27;s &quot;Underworld U.S.A.&quot; at Columbia, and supported Esther Williams in &quot;The Big Show&quot;. He had his first film hit since &quot;Gidget&quot; with Columbia&#x27;s &quot;The Interns&quot; (1962). After supporting Debbie Reynolds in &quot;My Six Loves&quot; (1963), Robertson was President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s personal choice to play him in 1963&#x27;s &quot;PT 109&quot;. The film was not a success at the box office.

More popular was &quot;Sunday in New York&quot; (1963), where Robertson supported Rod Taylor and Jane Fonda, and &quot;The Best Man&quot; where he was a ruthless presidential candidate.

Robertson appeared in a popular war film &quot;633 Squadron&quot; (1964) then supported Lana Turner in a melodrama, &quot;Love Has Many Faces&quot; (1965). In 1965 he said his contract with Columbia was for one film a year.

===&quot;Charly&quot;===
In 1961 Robertson played the lead role in a &quot;United States Steel Hour&quot; television production titled &quot;The Two Worlds of Charlie Gordon&quot;, based on the novel &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; by Daniel Keyes. Frustrated at the progress of his career, Robertson optioned the rights to the teleplay and hired William Goldman to write a script. Before Goldman completed his work, Robertson arranged for Goldman to be hired to Americanize the dialogue for &quot;Masquerade&quot; (1965), a spy spoof which Robertson starred in, replacing Rex Harrison. 

Robertson then made a war film, &quot;Up from the Beach&quot; (1965) for Fox and guest-starred on that studio&#x27;s TV show, &quot;Batman&quot; (1966). He co-starred with Harrison in &quot;The Honey Pot&quot; (1967) for Joseph L. Mankiewicz then appeared in another war film, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Brigade&quot; (1968) with William Holden.

Robertson disliked Goldman&#x27;s &quot;Algernon&quot; script and replaced the writer with Stirling Silliphant for what became &quot;Charly&quot; (1968). The film was another box office success and Robertson won the 1968 Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of a mentally-challenged man.

===Stardom===
&quot;Charly&quot; was made by ABC Pictures, which insisted that Robert Aldrich use Robertson in &quot;Too Late the Hero&quot; (1970), a war film with Michael Caine that was a disappointment at the box office.

Robertson turned down roles in &quot;The Anderson Tapes&quot;, &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; (before Peckinpah was involved), and &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;. Instead Robertson co-wrote, starred in, and directed &quot;J. W. Coop&quot; (1972), another commercial disappointment despite excellent reviews.

Looking back on his career, Robertson said: &quot;nobody made more mediocre movies than I did. Nobody ever did such a wide variety of mediocrity&quot;.

In 1969, immediately after winning the Academy Award for &quot;Charly&quot;, Robertson, a lifelong aviation enthusiast, attempted to produce and direct an aviation film, &quot;I Shot Down the Red Baron, I Think&quot;, featuring World War I aerial combat, using Lynn Garrison&#x27;s Irish aviation facility. The comedic storyline portrayed the Red Baron as gay. The aircraft featured garish paint schemes. The film was never completed or released.

Robertson played Cole Younger in &quot;The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid&quot; (1972) and a pilot in &quot;Ace Eli and Rodger of the Skies&quot; (1973). He appeared in the 1974 thriller &quot;Man on a Swing&quot; and the 1975 British drama &quot;Out of Season&quot;.

===Later career===
Robertson returned to supporting parts in &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; (1975), which was a big hit. He played the lead in &quot;Obsession&quot; (1976), a popular thriller from Brian De Palma and Paul Schrader, and in the Canadian drama &quot;Shoot&quot; (1976). He was also one of several stars in &quot;Midway&quot; (1976).

Robertson turned to television for &quot;&quot; (1977), then had the lead in a thriller, &quot;Dominique&quot; (1978). He returned to directing for &quot;The Pilot&quot; (1980), also playing the title role, an alcoholic flyer. Robertson played Hugh Hefner in &quot;Star 80&quot; (1983). He attempted to make &quot;Charly II&quot; in 1980 but it did not happen.

From the 1980s and 1990s onwards, Robertson was predominantly a character actor. He played villains in &quot;Class&quot; (1983) and &quot;Brainstorm&quot; (1983). He did have the lead in &quot;Shaker Run&quot; (1985) in New Zealand, and &quot;Dreams of Gold: The Mel Fisher Story&quot; (1986) on TV.

In addition, he served as the company spokesperson for AT&amp;T from 1983 to 1992 and appeared in various commercials for their long-distance service and consumer telephones.

He was a villain in &quot;Malone&quot; (1987), did &quot;Dead Reckoning&quot; (1990) on TV and supported in &quot;Wild Hearts Can&#x27;t Be Broken&quot; (1991), &quot;Wind&quot; (1991), &quot;Renaissance Man&quot; (1994) and John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; (1996).

Late in his life Robertson&#x27;s career had a resurgence. He appeared as Uncle Ben Parker in Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002), as well as in the sequels &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; (2004) and &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; (2007; his last acting role). He commented on his website: &quot;Since &quot;Spider-Man 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;, I seem to have a whole new generation of fans. That in itself is a fine residual.&quot; He also starred in and wrote &quot;13th Child&quot; (2002) and appeared in &quot;Riding the Bullet&quot; (2004), both horror films.

In 1989, he was a member of the jury at the 39th Berlin International Film Festival.

===Television===

Robertson&#x27;s early television appearances included a starring role in the live space opera &quot;Rod Brown of the Rocket Rangers&quot; (1953–1954), as well as recurring roles on &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; (1952), &quot;Alcoa Theatre&quot; (1959), and &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; (1958, 1960), &quot;Outlaws&quot; (three episodes). Robertson also appeared as a special guest star on &quot;Wagon Train&quot; for one episode, portraying an Irish immigrant.

In 1958, Robertson portrayed Joe Clay in the first broadcast of &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot;. In 1960, he was cast as Martinus Van Der Brig, a con man, in the episode &quot;End of a Dream&quot; of &quot;Riverboat&quot;.

Other appearances included: &quot;Wagon Train&quot; (1958), &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episodes &quot;A Hundred Yards Over the Rim&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Dummy&quot; (1962), followed by &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot; in the 1963 episode &quot;The Man Who Came Home Late&quot;. He guest-starred on such television series as &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, &quot;Breaking Point&quot; and &quot;ABC Stage 67&quot;. He had starring roles in episodes of both the 1960s and 1990s versions of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, including &quot;The Galaxy Being&quot;, the first episode of the original series. He was awarded an Emmy for his leading role in a 1965 episode, &quot;The Game&quot; of &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot;. He appeared as a villain on five episodes of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; series as the gunfighter &quot;Shame&quot; (1966 and 1968), the second time with his wife, Dina Merrill, as &quot;Calamity Jan&quot;.

In 1976, he portrayed a retired Buzz Aldrin in an adaptation of Aldrin&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Return to Earth&quot;. The next year, he portrayed a fictional Director of Central Intelligence (based on Richard Helms) in &quot;&quot;, an adaptation of John Ehrlichman&#x27;s roman à clef &quot;The Company&quot;, in turn based on the Watergate scandal. In 1987, he portrayed Henry Ford in &quot;Ford: The Man and The Machine&quot;. From 1983 to 1984, he played Dr. Michael Ranson in &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;. 

==Columbia Pictures scandal==
In 1977, Robertson discovered that his signature had been forged on a $10,000 check payable to him, although it was for work he had not performed. He also learned that the forgery had been carried out by then-Columbia Pictures head David Begelman, and on reporting it he inadvertently triggered one of the biggest Hollywood scandals of the 1970s. Begelman was charged with embezzlement, convicted, and later fired from Columbia. Despite pressure to remain quiet, Robertson and his wife Dina Merrill spoke to the press. As a result, Columbia blacklisted him and would not make another film with him in it until 2002&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot;.

He finally returned to studio film five years later, starring in &quot;Brainstorm&quot; (1983). The story of the scandal is told in David McClintick&#x27;s 1982 bestseller, &quot;Indecent Exposure&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1957, Robertson married actress Cynthia Stone, the former wife of actor Jack Lemmon. They had a daughter, Stephanie, before divorcing in 1959; he also had a stepson by this marriage, Chris Lemmon. In 1966, he married actress and Post Cereals heiress Dina Merrill, the former wife of Stanley M. Rumbough Jr.; they had a daughter, Heather (1968–2007), before divorcing. He resided in Water Mill, New York.

Robertson was a Democrat and supported Arizona congressman Morris K. Udall during the 1976 Democratic presidential primaries.

===Aviation===
A certified private pilot, one of Robertson&#x27;s main hobbies was flying and, among other aircraft, he owned several de Havilland Tiger Moths, a Messerschmitt Bf 108, and a genuine World War II–era Mk. IX Supermarine Spitfire (MK923). His first plane flight was in a Lockheed Model 9 Orion. As a 13-year-old, he cleaned hangars for airplane rides. He met Paul Mantz, Art Scholl, and Charles Lindbergh while flying at local California airports. His piloting skills helped him get the part as the squadron leader in the British war film &quot;633 Squadron&quot;. He entered balloon races, including one in 1964 from the mainland to Catalina Island that ended with him being rescued from the Pacific Ocean. He was also a glider pilot and owned a Grob Astir.

In 1969, during the civil war conflict in Nigeria, Robertson helped organize an effort to fly food and medical supplies into the area. He also organized flights of supplies to the ravaged country of Ethiopia when it experienced famine in 1978.

Robertson was flying a private Beechcraft Baron over New York City on the morning of September 11, 2001, two days after his 78th birthday. He was directly above the World Trade Center, climbing through 7,500 feet when the first Boeing 767 struck. He was instructed by air traffic control to land immediately at the nearest airport after a nationwide order to ground all civilian and commercial aircraft following the attacks.

====Young Eagles====
He was a longtime member of the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA), working his way through the ranks in prominence and eventually co-founding the Young Eagles Program with EAA president Tom Poberezny. Robertson chaired the program from its 1992 inception to 1994 (succeeded by former test pilot Chuck Yeager). Along with educating youth about aviation, the initial goal of the Young Eagles was to fly one million children (many of them never having flown before) prior to the 100th Anniversary of Flight celebration on December 17, 2003. That goal was achieved on November 13, 2003. On July 28, 2016, the two millionth Young Eagle was flown by actor Harrison Ford. Within the EAA, he also founded the Cliff Robertson Work Experience in 1993, which offers youths the chance to work for flight and ground school instruction.

==Death==
On September 10, 2011, one day after his 88th birthday, Robertson died of natural causes in Stony Brook, New York. His body was cremated, and a private funeral was held at St. Luke&#x27;s Episcopal Church in East Hampton, New York and was interred at the Cedar Lawn Cemetery.

==Filmography==
== Awards ==
Robertson was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 2006. He received the Rebecca Rice Alumni Award from Antioch College in 2007. In addition to his Oscar and Emmy and several lifetime achievement awards from various film festivals, Robertson has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6801 Hollywood Blvd. He was also awarded the 2008 Ambassador of Good Will Aviation Award by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Bar Association in Alexandria, Virginia, for his leadership in and promotion of general aviation. In 2009, Robertson was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum, and was part of the Living Legends of Aviation.

<text>Edge of Sanity was a Swedish death metal band that, alongside Opeth, is commonly regarded as being the first to fuse extreme metal styles like death and black metal with progressive rock. The group was founded by Dan Swanö in 1989 and ended in 2003.

== History ==
Edge of Sanity began as a death metal band with their debut release &quot;Nothing but Death Remains&quot;. The band&#x27;s second release, &quot;Unorthodox&quot;, with tracks like &quot;Enigma&quot; and &quot;When All Is Said&quot;, showed Edge of Sanity branching out from some of the genre&#x27;s conventions. &quot;The Spectral Sorrows&quot;, &quot;Until Eternity Ends&quot;, and &quot;Purgatory Afterglow&quot; continued the trend, so that by the release of &quot;Crimson&quot; (1996), Edge of Sanity was a progressive metal band. &quot;Crimson&quot; was a 40-minute concept album consisting entirely of one track, concerning a post-apocalyptic future in which mankind had lost the ability to breed. After one more album, &quot;Infernal&quot; (1997), guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Dan Swanö left Edge of Sanity, and his departure is generally associated with a decline in quality in the band&#x27;s material. Swanö was replaced by Robert Karlsson, the vocalist of Pan.Thy.Monium (a side project in which Swanö was also involved), but after one more album, &quot;Cryptic&quot;, the band split up.

In 2003, Swanö revived the outfit as a one-man band (with several session musicians), and recorded a sequel to &quot;Crimson&quot;, &quot;Crimson II&quot;. Immediately after, he re-dissolved the project.

The &quot;Kur-Nu-Gi-A&quot; demo was re-released on LP in 2011, and on CD in 2012.

In the spring of 2024, Century Media Records and InsideOutMusic revealed plans to launch the first chapter of an extensive reissue campaign for Edge Of Sanity&#x27;s catalogue. These definitive reissues were remastered by Swanö. In June 2024, a video was shared featuring the remastered version of &quot;Black Tears&quot;, from the band&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Purgatory Afterglow&quot;.

<doc id="161900" wikidata="Q6667462" url="?curid=161900" title="Logic for Computable Functions">
<text>Logic for Computable Functions (LCF) is an interactive automated theorem prover developed at Stanford and Edinburgh by Robin Milner and collaborators in early 1970s, based on the theoretical foundation of logic [[Logic for Computable Functions|of]] computable functions previously proposed by Dana Scott. Work on the LCF system introduced the general-purpose programming language ML to allow users to write theorem-proving tactics, supporting algebraic data types, parametric polymorphism, abstract data types, and exceptions.

== Basic idea ==

Theorems in the system are terms of a special &quot;theorem&quot; abstract data type. The general mechanism of abstract data types of ML ensures that theorems are derived using only the inference rules given by the operations of the theorem abstract type. Users can write arbitrarily complex ML programs to compute theorems; the validity of theorems does not depend on the complexity of such programs, but follows from the soundness of the abstract data type implementation and the correctness of the ML compiler.

== Advantages ==

The LCF approach provides similar trustworthiness to systems that generate explicit proof certificates but without the need to store proof objects in memory. The Theorem data type can be easily implemented to optionally store proof objects, depending on the system&#x27;s run-time configuration, so it generalizes the basic proof-generation approach. The design decision to use a general-purpose programming language for developing theorems means that, depending on the complexity of programs written, it is possible to use the same language to write step-by-step proofs, decision procedures, or theorem provers.

== Disadvantages ==

=== Trusted computing base ===

The implementation of the underlying ML compiler adds to the trusted computing base. Work on CakeML resulted in a formally verified ML compiler, alleviating some of these concerns.

=== Efficiency and complexity of proof procedures ===

Theorem proving often benefits from decision procedures and theorem proving algorithms, whose correctness has been extensively analyzed. A straightforward way of implementing these procedures in an LCF approach requires such procedures to always derive outcomes from the axioms, lemmas, and inference rules of the system, as opposed to directly computing the outcome. A potentially more efficient approach is to use reflection to prove that a function operating on formulas always gives correct result.

== Influences ==

Among subsequent implementations is Cambridge LCF. Later systems simplified the logic to use total instead of partial functions, leading to HOL, HOL Light, and the Isabelle proof assistant that supports various logics. As of 2019, the Isabelle proof assistant still contains an implementation of an LCF logic, Isabelle/LCF.

<doc id="161901" wikidata="Q1067502" url="?curid=161901" title="Charly (1968 film)">
<text>Charly (marketed and stylized as CHAЯLY) is a 1968 American science fiction drama film directed and produced by Ralph Nelson and written by Stirling Silliphant. It is based on &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot;, a science-fiction short story (1958) and subsequent novel (1966) by Daniel Keyes.

The film stars Cliff Robertson as Charly Gordon, an intellectually disabled adult who is selected by two doctors to undergo a surgical procedure that triples his IQ as it had done for a laboratory mouse that underwent the same procedure. The film also stars Claire Bloom, Lilia Skala, Leon Janney, Dick Van Patten and Barney Martin. Robertson had played the same role in a 1961 television adaptation titled &quot;The Two Worlds of Charlie Gordon,&quot; an episode of the anthology series &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;.

The film received positive reviews and was a success at the box office and later in home media sales. Robertson won Best Actor at the Academy Awards.

== Plot ==
Charly Gordon is an intellectually disabled man who lives in Boston. He has a desire to learn and has attended night school for two years, taking a class taught by Alice Kinnian. He learns to read and write, though his spelling and penmanship are poor and he is unable to spell his own name. He works as a janitor at a bakery, where his coworkers amuse themselves by taking advantage of his disability, and he enjoys playing with children at a playground.

Alice takes Charly to researchers Dr. Richard Nemur and Dr. Anna Straus, who have been investigating methods for increasing intelligence. Having successfully tested a surgical procedure on a lab mouse named Algernon, they are looking for a human test subject. They put Charly through a battery of aptitude tests and have him try to solve a series of paper mazes while Algernon runs through models of them. Charly consistently loses to Algernon, but is selected for the surgery.

After surgery, Charly loses to Algernon again and is frustrated at not immediately becoming smarter. After some time passes, he finally beats Algernon and his intelligence begins to increase. His coworkers tell him to operate a complex machine, hoping that he will break it so they can have the day off, but he successfully operates it. Embarrassed and frightened by his new intelligence, they persuade the bakery owners to fire Charly. Alice continues teaching him, but his intelligence continues to increase and eventually surpasses hers. Lacking emotional maturity, Charly becomes infatuated with Alice and confesses his love for her, but she sharply rejects his advances. He flees in an act of rebellion but eventually returns to Boston, and the two start to consider marriage.

Nemur and Straus present their research at a scientific convention. After playing the film of Charly&#x27;s original aptitude tests, they bring him out for a question-and-answer session. He is now the intellectual equal or superior of everyone in the audience, but he has also developed a cynical view of humanity that the attendees mistake for humor. He reveals that Algernon has lost his enhanced intelligence and died, facts that the research team kept from him, and expects to undergo a similar decline. Fleeing the convention and seeing hallucinations of his previous self everywhere, Charly stops to help a busboy pick up a tray of dropped glasses after observing that he is intellectually disabled.

Charly overhears Alice, Nemur, and Straus discussing his situation and offers to assist in finding a way to preserve his intelligence, but their combined efforts prove fruitless. He falls into a depression and asks Alice never to visit him again. Some time later, Alice sees Charly playing with children on the playground, having fully regressed to his original level of disability.

== Production history ==
===Development===

The short story &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; had been the basis of &quot;The Two Worlds of Charlie Gordon&quot;, a 1961 television adaptation in which Robertson had also starred for &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;. Robertson had starred in a number of television shows that were turned into films with other actors playing his roles, such as &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot;. He bought the rights to the story, hoping to star in the film version as well.

Robertson originally hired William Goldman to write the screenplay on the strength of Goldman&#x27;s novel &quot;No Way to Treat a Lady&quot;, paying him $30,000 out of his own pocket. However, Robertson was unhappy with Goldman&#x27;s work and then hired Stirling Silliphant to write a draft.

Robertson received $25,000 for his role in the film.

==Release==
The film premiered at the Berlin Film Festival on June 28, 1968. It then opened at the Baronet Theatre in New York City on September 23, 1968.

==Box office==
The film was a hit, earning $7.25 million in theatrical rentals during its release in North America, and it earned an additional $1.25 million in theatrical rentals overseas, making it the 16th-highest-grossing film of 1968. After all costs were deducted (including $1,325,000 paid to profit share), the film reported a profit of $1,390,000, making it one of the few successful films made by Selmur/ABC Pictures.

== Critical reception ==
Vincent Canby called the film a &quot;self-conscious contemporary drama, the first ever to exploit mental retardation for...the bittersweet romance of it&quot;; he called Robertson&#x27;s performance &quot;earnest&quot; but points out that &quot;we [the audience] are forced into the vaguely unpleasant position of being voyeurs, congratulating ourselves for not being Charly as often as we feel a distant pity for him.&quot; Canby calls Nelson&#x27;s direction &quot;neo-Expo 67&quot;, referring to the use of split screen to &quot;show simultaneously the reactions of two people facing each other and conversing&quot; and the use of &quot;little postage stamp-sized inserts of images within the larger screen frame.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine called &quot;Charly&quot; an &quot;odd little movie about mental retardation and the dangers of all-conquering science, done with a dash of whimsy.&quot; While &quot;the historic sights in and around Charly&#x27;s Boston setting have never been more lovingly filmed&quot;, &quot;The impact of [Robertson&#x27;s] performance...is lessened by Producer-Director Ralph Nelson&#x27;s determination to prove that he learned how to be new and now at Expo &#x27;67: almost every other sequence is done in split screens, multiple images, still shots or slow motion.&quot; Screenwriter Maurice Rapf called Robertson&#x27;s performance &quot;extraordinary&quot; and called &quot;astonishing&quot; his on-screen &quot;transformation from one end of the intellectual spectrum to the other&quot;; Rapf took issue with what he called the &quot;pyrotechnics of the camera&quot; and the &quot;flashy opticals&quot;, calling the effects &quot;jarringly out of place&quot; and better suited for a &quot;no-story mod film like &quot;The Knack&quot;.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, writing &quot;The relationship between Charly (Cliff Robertson) and the girl (Claire Bloom) is handled delicately and well. She cares for him, but inadequately understands the problems he&#x27;s facing. These become more serious when he passes normal IQ and moves into the genius category; his emotional development falls behind. It is this story, involving a personal crisis, which makes &quot;Charly&quot; a warm and rewarding film.&quot; By contrast, Ebert pointed out &quot;the whole scientific hocus-pocus, which causes his crisis, is irrelevant and weakens the movie by distracting us.&quot;

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 55% approval rating based on 20 critical reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10.

In 2009, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed &quot;Charly&quot; among its &quot;25 Best Movie Tearjerkers Ever.&quot;

== Awards and nominations ==
== Proposed sequel ==

In the late 1970s, following a period of extended unemployment after having alerted authorities to illegal activities committed by Columbia Pictures president David Begelman, Robertson wrote and attempted to produce &quot;Charly II&quot;, to no avail.

== Home media ==

&quot;Charly&quot; was released on Region 1 DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on March 31, 2005.

<doc id="161903" wikidata="Q1645466" url="?curid=161903" title="The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter">
<text>The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (1940) is the debut novel by the American author Carson McCullers; she was 23 at the time of publication. It is about a deaf man named John Singer and the people he encounters in a 1930s mill town in the US state of Georgia.

A. S. Knowles Jr., author of &quot;Six Bronze Petals and Two Red: Carson McCullers in the Forties&quot;, wrote that the book &quot;still seems to capture [the author&#x27;s] total sensibility more completely than her other works.&quot; Frederic I. Carpenter wrote in the &quot;English Journal&quot; that the novel &quot;essentially [...] described the struggle of all these lonely people to come to terms with their world, to become members of their society, to find human love—in short, to become mature.&quot;

== Title ==

The title comes from the poem &quot;The Lonely Hunter&quot; by the Scottish poet William Sharp, who used the pseudonym &quot;Fiona MacLeod&quot;.
&quot;Deep in the heart of Summer, sweet is life to me still, But my heart is a lonely hunter that hunts on a lonely hill.&quot;

== Plot ==

The book begins with a focus on the relationship between two close friends, John Singer and Spiros Antonapoulos, deaf people who have lived together for several years. Antonapoulos becomes mentally ill, misbehaves, and, despite attempts at intervention from Singer, is eventually put into an insane asylum far away from town. Now alone, Singer moves into a new room.

The remainder of the narrative centers on the struggles of four of John Singer&#x27;s acquaintances: Mick Kelly, a tomboy who loves music and dreams of buying a piano; Jake Blount, an alcoholic labor agitator; Biff Brannon, the observant owner of a diner; and Dr. Benedict Mady Copeland, an idealistic physician.

Three times, Singer takes a long trip to visit Spiros in the asylum where he has been placed. On the third trip he learns that Spiros had died; no one had notified Singer.

==Creation and conception==
McCullers sought to create a novel about a character to whom other characters reveal their innermost secrets. Initially her main character was Jewish.

==Characters==
The scholar Nancy B. Rich stated that many of the supporting characters are only concerned about their own causes and never achieve a &quot;clear voice&quot; due to their lack of courtesy to one another. Rich also stated that most of the characters do not stand a chance at making meaningful changes towards the governing system.

* John Singer
** Singer, a deaf engraver, has learned to speak but chooses to only sign once he meets Antonapoulos. Various characters perceive Singer as being from or sympathetic to their respective demographic groups. Nancy B. Rich states that the character &quot;neither confirms nor denies&quot; these beliefs, making the question of whether they are true &quot;moot&quot;. Rich also characterizes Singer as doing &quot;almost nothing&quot; in the story except benevolent acts that &quot;suggest democracy at work&quot;. Rich added that Singer &quot;appears prominent, but in reality[...]is little more than a memory or an expectation in the minds of other characters&quot; and that the character has an &quot;accessibility&quot; that declines on part of the story. Hamilton stated that other characters perceive him as being sympathetic to their needs because he does not speak, and that the characters are wrong in perceiving him as a &quot;god&quot;, and that Singer&#x27;s thoughts centrally concern himself and his own needs.
** The majority of literary critics have perceived Singer as, in Rich&#x27;s words, &quot;the pivotal character of the novel&quot;, and Rich argues that the interaction of other characters with him is the reason for this. Rich described Singer as being there to &quot;objectify the negative force of government&quot;. Rich stated that critics who did not perceive the political &quot;parable&quot; perceive Singer as a &quot;God figure&quot; with the remaining main cast being &quot;of equal stature in a row behind him.&quot;
** Initially McCullers conceived him as a Jewish character named Harry Minowitz, based on a painting of a Jewish man in an art gallery whose expression she found to be, as described by Oliver Evans in &quot;The Georgia Review &quot;, &quot;wise, kindly, and compassionate&quot;.
* Spiros Antonapoulos
** Spiros, the initial character depicted in the story, is a sweets manufacturer who is of Greek ancestry. Hamilton stated that before Antonapoulos&#x27;s mental breakdown, he and Singer are not lonely even though the two had no other significant friendships. Carpenter wrote that Singer&#x27;s and Antonapoulos&#x27;s &quot;devotion to each other recalls the desperate attachment of the two lonely ranch hands in Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;.&quot;
**Rich stated that Spiros&#x27;s status as a &quot;deaf mute&quot; &quot;signals that his role...is associated with government&quot; and serves as an &quot;arm&quot; of it. Rich wrote that Antonapoulos &quot;has always remained just out of view of the major characters.&quot; Singer is the sole character to remind himself about Antonapoulos. Rich also stated that Antonapoulos symbolizes the Greek and Christian roots of the American political system. Hamilton stated that Singer overlooks the negative traits of Antonapoulos and thinks of positive ones, and so &quot;offers his worship&quot; to the latter.
* Margaret &quot;Mick&quot; Kelly
** Mick faces the effects of poverty which prevent her from achieving her dreams. According to Rich, the character &quot;thinks of herself as an individualist&quot; and has &quot;delusions about her morality&quot;, and that she does &quot;little thinking in general&quot;. Furthermore, Mick &quot;seems at first to be a nonconformist&quot; while in fact Mick is shown to conform by the end of the story, adopting a feminine mode of dress while initially being a tomboy. Mick instills a sense of toughness in her brothers because she perceives the outside world as requiring strength from individuals. She also uses Singer as, in Carpenter&#x27;s words, a &quot;confidant&quot;. Rich stated that ultimately Mick &quot;never matures&quot; in terms of morals nor in terms of her intelligence. She becomes depressed after Singer&#x27;s death.
** McCullers initially conceived Mick as a male character named Jester.
** Rich describes Mick as representing women and ordinary White Americans, particularly the silent majority. Most reviewers perceived her as the, according to McDonald, &quot;central personage&quot;. Rich argues that &quot;she represents the real causes of the failure of democracy&quot; as while she has dreams she is unable to figure out what they are, and that she represents &quot;public apathy&quot;. Rich stated that many reviewers perceive her problems as being external, &quot;social and economic&quot;, as opposed to personal issues.
* Biff Brannon
** Hamilton states that Brannon has many qualities that could have allowed other characters to turn to him for support, or to make him their &quot;god&quot;, and yet the characters instead do that to Singer. Rich states that the character represents &quot;an average, middle class American&quot; through his passion for democracy, gainful employment, and being &quot;vaguely patriotic&quot;. Rich wrote that &quot;Biff represents middle-class business interests&quot;. According to Rich, this makes him the sole character who has a chance of making meaningful changes in the governing system. Rich also stated that were critics wrongly perceiving him to be &quot;a deviate&quot; with some believing he is secretly attracted to men. Rich wrote that Biff fails to &quot;understand&quot; the issues facing other characters even though he &quot;is sympathetic to the others&quot;. Hamilton wrote that Brannon has the widest &quot;vision&quot; of the five supporting characters and that he realizes that &quot;order&quot; is possible and that dilemmas may be solved. According to Hamilton, &quot;For Biff, universal love is the answer to darkness.&quot;
** Rich believes that critics have not focused enough attention on him, arguing &quot;he is the most important character in the parable&quot;.
* Dr. Benedict Mady Copeland
** Dr. Copeland, a Black physician, is estranged from his family due to his focus on what Hamilton calls &quot;his love to man&quot;, and Hamilton described him as agnostic. Rich stated that &quot;Dr. Copeland is only interested in the Negro problem&quot; and that this limits his effectiveness in enacting societal change. Carpenter wrote that Singer treats Copeland &quot;as his equal&quot; and &quot;shares [Copeland&#x27;s] tortured protests against racial injustice.&quot; Copeland suffers a beating from prison guards when he tries to help his son, and moves to a poor farm as his tuberculosis is fatal.
* Jake Blount
** Hamilton stated that Jake is &quot;drunk and abusive&quot; and that &quot;Singer thinks Jake is crazy.&quot; Rich argues that his lack of contact with Mick limits his effectiveness. Carpenter wrote that with Jake, Singer takes the role as &quot;sympathetic &quot;listener&quot;&quot;.

==Background==
McCullers had started a politically oriented magazine and voiced a possibility of becoming active in politics.

==Reception==
When published in 1940, the novel created a literary sensation and enjoyed a rapid rise to the top of the bestseller lists; it was the first in a string of works by McCullers that give voice to those who are rejected, forgotten, mistreated or oppressed. Evans wrote that the initial reaction was &quot;a divided reception from the critics, some of whom were inclined to view it, not so much as a novel in its own right, but as a kind of literary phenomenon—as the precocious product&quot; of a young author who may turn out higher quality product when she is older.

Alice Hamilton wrote in the &quot;Dalhousie Review&quot; that the presence of so many mutes in the storyline &quot;Taken literally [...] strains the bounds of credulity.&quot;

Frederic I. Carpenter wrote in &quot;The English Journal&quot; that the ending exhibits &quot;frustration&quot; as Biff Brannon makes comments and as Adolf Hitler makes proclamations over the radio.

The Modern Library ranked the novel seventeenth on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. &quot;Time&quot; included it in &quot;TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005&quot;. In 2004 the novel was selected for Oprah&#x27;s Book Club.

==Adaptations==

A film adaptation was made in 1968, starring Alan Arkin, Sondra Locke and Cicely Tyson.

A stage adaptation of &quot;The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter&quot; premiered on March 30, 2005, at the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia. The show ran until April 24 of that year, then toured. The play was an Alliance Theater presentation done in association with The Acting Company out of New York. The play, adapted by Rebecca Gilman, was directed by Doug Hughes.

British artist Joe Simpson made McCullers&#x27;s book the centerpiece of his 2014 painting, &quot;The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter&quot;. The painting shows two characters each reading the book on the London Underground; it is one of his ongoing series of paintings entitled, &quot;London&quot;.

A radio dramatization was broadcast in two parts by BBC Radio 4 on 15 and 22 March 2020.

<text>In computer science, program analysis is the process of analyzing the behavior of computer programs regarding a property such as correctness, robustness, safety and liveness. 
Program analysis focuses on two major areas: program optimization and program correctness. The first focuses on improving the program’s performance while reducing the resource usage while the latter focuses on ensuring that the program does what it is supposed to do.

Program analysis can be performed without executing the program (static program analysis), during runtime (dynamic program analysis) or in a combination of both.

==Static program analysis==

In the context of program correctness, static analysis can discover vulnerabilities during the development phase of the program. These vulnerabilities are easier to correct than the ones found during the testing phase since static analysis leads to the root of the vulnerability.

Due to many forms of static analysis being computationally undecidable, the mechanisms for performing it may not always terminate with the correct answer. This can result in either false negatives (&quot;no problems found&quot; when the code does in fact have issues) or false positives, or because they may never return an incorrect answer but may also never terminate. Despite these limitations, static analysis can still be valuable: the first type of mechanism might reduce the number of vulnerabilities, while the second can sometimes provide strong assurance of the absence of certain classes of vulnerabilities.

Incorrect optimizations are highly undesirable. So, in the context of program optimization, there are two main strategies to handle computationally undecidable analysis:

# An optimizer that is expected to complete in a relatively short amount of time, such as the optimizer in an optimizing compiler, may use a truncated version of an analysis that is guaranteed to complete in a finite amount of time, and guaranteed to only find correct optimizations.
# A third-party optimization tool may be implemented in such a way as to never produce an incorrect optimization, but also so that it can, in some situations, continue running indefinitely until it finds one (which may never happen). In this case, the developer using the tool would have to stop the tool and avoid running the tool on that piece of code again (or possibly modify the code to avoid tripping up the tool).

However, there is also a third strategy that is sometimes applicable for languages that are not completely specified, such as C. An optimizing compiler is at liberty to generate code that does anything at runtime even crashes if it encounters source code whose semantics are unspecified by the language standard in use.

=== Control-flow ===

The purpose of control-flow analysis is to obtain information about which functions can be called at various points during the execution of a program. The collected information is represented by a control-flow graph (CFG) where the nodes are instructions of the program and the edges represent the flow of control. By identifying code blocks and loops a CFG becomes a starting point for compiler-made optimizations.

=== Data-flow analysis ===

Data-flow analysis is a technique designed to gather information about the values at each point of the program and how they change over time. This technique is often used by compilers to optimize the code.
One of the most well known examples of data-flow analysis is taint checking, which consists of considering all variables that contain user-supplied data which is considered &quot;tainted&quot;, i.e. insecure and preventing those variables from being used until they have been sanitized. This technique is often used to prevent SQL injection attacks. Taint checking can be done statically or dynamically.

=== Abstract interpretation ===

Abstract interpretation allows the extraction of information about a possible execution of a program without actually executing the program. 
This information can be used by compilers to look for possible optimizations or for certifying a program against certain classes of bugs.

=== Type systems ===

Type systems associate types to programs that fulfill certain requirements. Their purpose is to select a subset of programs of a language that are considered correct according to a property.

* Type checking – verify whether the program is accepted by the type system.

Type checking is used in programming to limit how programming objects are used and what can they do. This is done by the compiler or interpreter. Type checking can also help prevent vulnerabilities by ensuring that a signed value isn&#x27;t attributed to an unsigned variable.
Type checking can be done statically (at compile time), dynamically (at runtime) or a combination of both.

Static type information (either inferred, or explicitly provided by type annotations in the source code) can also be used to do optimizations, such as replacing boxed arrays with unboxed arrays.

=== Effect systems ===

Effect systems are formal systems designed to represent the effects that executing a function or method can have. An effect codifies what is being done and with what it is being done usually referred to as &quot;effect kind&quot; and &quot;effect region&quot;, respectively.

=== Model checking ===

Model checking refers to strict, formal, and automated ways to check if a &quot;model&quot; (which in this context means a formal model of a piece of code, though in other contexts it can be a model of a piece of hardware) complies with a given specification. Due to the inherent finite-state nature of code, and both the specification and the code being convertible into logical formulae, it is possible to check if the system violates the specification using efficient algorithmic methods.

==Dynamic program analysis==

Dynamic analysis can use runtime knowledge of the program to increase the precision of the analysis, while also providing runtime protection, but it can only analyze a single execution of the problem and might degrade the program’s performance due to the runtime checks.

=== Testing ===

Software should be tested to ensure its quality and that it performs as it is supposed to in a reliable manner, and that it won’t create conflicts with other software that may function alongside it. The tests are performed by executing the program with an input and evaluating its behavior and the produced output.
Even if no security requirements are specified, additional security testing should be performed to ensure that an attacker can’t tamper with the software and steal information, disrupt the software’s normal operations, or use it as a pivot to attack its users.

=== Monitoring ===
Program monitoring records and logs different kinds of information about the program such as resource usage, events, and interactions, so that it can be reviewed to find or pinpoint causes of abnormal behavior. Furthermore, it can be used to perform security audits. Automated monitoring of programs is sometimes referred to as runtime verification.

=== Program slicing ===

For a given subset of a program’s behavior, program slicing consists of reducing the program to the minimum form that still produces the selected behavior. The reduced program is called a “slice” and is a faithful representation of the original program within the domain of the specified behavior subset. 
Generally, finding a slice is an unsolvable problem, but by specifying the target behavior subset by the values of a set of variables, it is possible to obtain approximate slices using a data-flow algorithm. These slices are usually used by developers during debugging to locate the source of errors.

<doc id="161907" wikidata="Q309160" url="?curid=161907" title="Alan Bates">
<text>Sir Alan Arthur Bates (17 February 1934 – 27 December 2003) was an English actor who came to prominence in the 1960s, when he appeared in films ranging from &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot; to the kitchen sink drama &quot;A Kind of Loving&quot;.

Bates is also known for his performance with Anthony Quinn in &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot;, as well as his roles in &quot;King of Hearts&quot;, &quot;Georgy Girl&quot;, &quot;Far From the Madding Crowd&quot; and &quot;The Fixer&quot;, for which he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. In 1969, he starred in the Ken Russell film &quot;Women in Love&quot; with Oliver Reed and Glenda Jackson.

Bates went on to star in &quot;The Go-Between&quot;, &quot;An Unmarried Woman&quot;, &quot;Nijinsky&quot; and in &quot;The Rose&quot; with Bette Midler, as well as many television dramas, including &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot;, Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Collection&quot;, &quot;A Voyage Round My Father&quot;, &quot;An Englishman Abroad&quot; (as Guy Burgess) and &quot;Pack of Lies&quot;. He also appeared on the stage, notably in the plays of Simon Gray, such as &quot;Butley&quot; and &quot;Otherwise Engaged&quot;.

==Early life==

Bates was born at the Queen Mary Nursing Home, Darley Abbey, Derby, England, on 17 February 1934, the eldest of three boys born to Florence Mary (née Wheatcroft), a housewife and a pianist, and Harold Arthur Bates, an insurance broker and a cellist. They lived in Allestree, Derby, at the time of Bates&#x27; birth, but briefly moved to Mickleover before returning to Allestree.

Both his parents were amateur musicians who encouraged Bates to pursue music. By the age of 11, having decided to become an actor, he studied drama instead. He further developed his vocation by attending productions at Derby&#x27;s Little Theatre.

Bates was educated at the Herbert Strutt Grammar School, Derby Road, Belper, Derbyshire (now &quot;Strutts&quot;, a volunteer led business and community centre) and later gained a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, where he studied with Albert Finney and Peter O&#x27;Toole, before leaving to join the RAF for National Service at RAF Newton.

==Career==
===Early stage appearances===
Bates&#x27;s stage debut was in 1955, in &quot;You and Your Wife&quot;, in Coventry.

In 1956, Bates made his West End debut as Cliff in &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;, a role he had originated at the Royal Court and which made him a star. He also played the role on television (for the &quot;ITV Play of the Week&quot;) and on Broadway. He also was a member of the 1967 acting company at the Stratford Festival in Canada, playing the title role in Richard III.

===Television===
In the late 1950s, Bates appeared in several plays for television in Britain in shows such as &quot;ITV Play of the Week&quot;, &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; and &quot;ITV Television Playhouse&quot;.

In 1960, Bates appeared as Giorgio in the final episode of &quot;The Four Just Men (TV series)&quot; entitled Treviso Dam.

Bates made his feature film debut in &quot;The Entertainer&quot; (1960) opposite Laurence Olivier. Bates worked for the &quot;Padded Wagon Moving Company&quot; in the early 1960s while acting at the &quot;Circle in the Square Theatre&quot; in New York City.

===Film stardom===
Bates played the lead in his second feature, &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot; (1961), directed by Bryan Forbes. He followed it with the lead in &quot;A Kind of Loving&quot; (1962), directed by John Schlesinger. Both films were very popular, establishing Bates as a film star.

Film critics cited the 1963 film noir &quot;The Running Man&quot; as being one of Bates&#x27; finest performances. The film starred Laurence Harvey as a man who fakes his death, with Bates in the supporting role of Stephen Maddox, an insurance company investigator.

Bates went into an adaptation of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Caretaker&quot; (1963) with Donald Pleasence and Robert Shaw. It was directed by Clive Donner who then made &quot;Nothing But the Best&quot; (1964) with Bates.

Bates supported Anthony Quinn in &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; (1964) and James Mason in &quot;Georgy Girl&quot; (1966). Bates returned to TV doing episodes of &quot;Wednesday Theatre&quot; and starred in Philippe de Broca&#x27;s &quot;King of Hearts&quot; (1966).

Bates was reunited with Schlesinger in &quot;Far From the Madding Crowd&quot; (1967), starring Julie Christie then did the Bernard Malamud film &quot;The Fixer&quot; (1968), which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.

In 1969 Bates starred in &quot;Women in Love&quot; directed by Ken Russell with Oliver Reed and Glenda Jackson, in which Bates and Reed wrestled naked. He followed it appearing as Col. Vershinin in the National Theatre&#x27;s film of &quot;Three Sisters&quot;, directed by and co-starring Laurence Olivier.

Bates was handpicked by director John Schlesinger (with whom he had previously worked on &quot;A Kind of Loving&quot; and &quot;Far From The Madding Crowd&quot;) to play the starring role of Dr Daniel Hirsh in the film &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; (1971). Bates was held up filming &quot;The Go-Between&quot; (1971) for director Joseph Losey alongside Christie, and had also become a father around that time, and so he had to refuse the role. (The part then went first to Ian Bannen, who balked at kissing and simulating sex with another man, and then to Peter Finch who earned an Academy Award nomination for the role.)

Bates starred in the film of &quot;A Day in the Death of Joe Egg&quot; (1972) and produced and appeared in a short, &quot;Second Best&quot; (1972).

Bates starred in &quot;Story of a Love Story&quot; (1973), and some play adaptations, &quot;Butley&quot; (1974) and &quot;In Celebration&quot; (1975). He was the villain in &quot;Royal Flash&quot; (1975) and appeared on television in &quot;Plays for Today&quot; and the &quot;Laurence Olivier Presents&quot; version of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Collection&quot; (1976).

===Television (1970s and 80s)===

Bates starred in the TV movie &quot;Piccadilly Circus&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; (1978). In the latter he played Michael Henchard, the ultimately-disgraced lead, which he described as his favourite role.
He starred in such international films as &quot;An Unmarried Woman&quot; (1978) and &quot;Nijinsky&quot; (1980), and also played Bette Midler&#x27;s ruthless business manager in the film &quot;The Rose&quot; (1979). He was also in &quot;The Shout&quot; (1979) and &quot;Very Like a Whale&quot; (1980).

Bates played two diametrically opposed roles in &quot;An Englishman Abroad&quot; (1983), as Guy Burgess, a member of the Cambridge spy ring exiled in Moscow, and in &quot;Pack of Lies&quot; (1987), as a British Secret Service agent tracking several Soviet spies.

===Later career===
Bates continued working in film and television in the 1990s, including the role of Claudius in Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1990). In 2001 he joined an all-star cast in Robert Altman&#x27;s critically acclaimed period drama &quot;Gosford Park&quot;, in which he played the butler Jennings. He later played Antonius Agrippa in the 2004 TV film &quot;Spartacus&quot;, but died before it premiered. The film was dedicated to his memory and that of writer Howard Fast, who wrote the original novel that inspired the film &quot;Spartacus&quot; by Stanley Kubrick.

On stage, Bates had a particular association with the plays of Simon Gray, appearing in &quot;Butley&quot;, &quot;Otherwise Engaged&quot;, &quot;Stage Struck&quot;, &quot;Melon&quot;, &quot;Life Support&quot;, and &quot;Simply Disconnected&quot;, as well as the film of &quot;Butley&quot; and Gray&#x27;s TV series &quot;Unnatural Pursuits&quot;. In &quot;Otherwise Engaged&quot;, his co-star was Ian Charleson, who became a friend, and Bates later contributed a chapter to a 1990 book on his colleague after Charleson&#x27;s early death.

Bates was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1995 Birthday Honours, and was knighted in the 2003 New Year Honours, in both cases for services to drama. and was a patron of The Actors Centre, Covent Garden, London, from 1994 until his death in 2003.

==Personal life==

Bates was married to actress Victoria Ward from 1970 until her death from a heart attack in 1992, although they had separated many years earlier. They had twin sons, born in November 1970: the actors Benedick Bates and Tristan Bates. Tristan died following an asthma attack in Tokyo in 1990.

Bates had numerous gay relationships, including those with actor Nickolas Grace and Olympic skater John Curry, as detailed in Donald Spoto&#x27;s authorised biography &quot;Otherwise Engaged: The Life of Alan Bates&quot;. Spoto characterised Bates&#x27;s sexuality as ambiguous, and said, &quot;he loved women but enjoyed his closest relationships with men&quot;. Even after homosexuality was partially decriminalised in England in 1967, Bates rigorously avoided interviews and questions about his personal life, and even denied to his male lovers that there was a homosexual component in his nature. Throughout his life, Bates sought to be regarded as charming and charismatic, or at least as a man who, as an actor, could appear attractive to and attracted by women. He also chose some roles with an aspect of homosexuality or bisexuality, including the role of Rupert in the 1969 film &quot;Women in Love&quot; and the role of Frank in the 1988 film &quot;We Think the World of You&quot;.

In the later years of his life, Bates had a relationship with the Welsh actress Angharad Rees.

==Death==
Bates died of pancreatic cancer on 27 December 2003, after slipping into a coma. He was buried at All Saints&#x27; Church, Bradbourne in Derbyshire. Bates bequeathed companion and actress Joanna Pettet £95,000 () upon his death. The two had been friends since 1964, and Pettet provided support and companionship during his final months after he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in February 2003. Pettet was quoted as saying: &quot;It was a very touching gesture because he had done everything while he was in hospital to make sure I would be looked after following his death.&quot;

==&quot;Otherwise Engaged: The Life of Alan Bates&quot;==
Donald Spoto&#x27;s 2007 book, &quot;Otherwise Engaged: The Life of Alan Bates&quot;, is a posthumous authorised biography of Alan Bates. It was written with the cooperation of his son Benedick and features more than one hundred interviews, including with Michael Linnit and Rosalind Chatto.

==Tristan Bates Theatre==
Bates and his family created the Tristan Bates Theatre at the Actors&#x27; Centre in Covent Garden, in memory of his son Tristan who died at the age of 19. Tristan&#x27;s twin brother, Benedick, is a vice-director.

<doc id="161908" wikidata="Q7734317" url="?curid=161908" title="The Fixer (novel)">
<text>The Fixer is a novel by Bernard Malamud published in 1966 by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. It won the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction (his second)
and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.

&quot;The Fixer&quot; provides a fictionalized version of the Beilis case. Menahem Mendel Beilis was a Jew unjustly imprisoned in Tsarist Russia. The &quot;Beilis trial&quot; of 1913 caused an international uproar and Beilis was acquitted by a jury.

The book was adapted into a 1968 film of the same name starring Alan Bates (Yakov Bok) who received an Oscar nomination.

==Plagiarism controversy==

Descendants of Mendel Beilis have long argued that in writing &quot;The Fixer&quot;, Malamud plagiarized from the 1926 English edition of Beilis&#x27;s memoir, &quot;The Story of My Sufferings&quot;. One of Beilis&#x27;s sons made such claims in correspondence to Malamud when &quot;The Fixer&quot; was first published. A 2011 edition of Beilis&#x27;s memoir, co-edited by one of his grandsons, claims to identify 35 instances of plagiarism by Malamud.

Responding to the allegations of plagiarism made by Beilis&#x27;s descendants, Malamud&#x27;s biographer Philip Davis acknowledged &quot;some close verbal parallels&quot; between Beilis&#x27;s memoir and Malamud&#x27;s novel. Davis argued, however, &quot;When it mattered most, [Malamud&#x27;s] sentences offered a different dimension and a deeper emotion.&quot;

Jewish Studies scholar Michael Tritt has characterized the relationship between Malamud&#x27;s &quot;The Fixer&quot; and Beilis&#x27;s &quot;The Story of My Sufferings&quot; as one of &quot;indebtedness and innovation&quot;.

==Censorship==
The book was one of several removed from school libraries by the board of education of the Island Trees Union Free School District in New York, which was the subject of a U.S. Supreme Court case in 1982.

In 2022, a school district in South Carolina removed the book from its library because of a parental complaint lodged against dozens of books. In 2023, after a review, the book was returned to the library. The book is still listed on a conservative site as a book that should be of concern to parents with a rating of &quot;minor restricted.&quot;

==In popular culture==
In episode 7 of &quot;Mad Men&quot; Season 5, the character Don Draper is seen reading the novel in bed and recommending it to his wife Megan.

In Stephen King’s novel Doctor Sleep the character Dan Torrance recommends the novel to Abra Stone.

<text>Ron Moody (born Ronald Moodnick; 8 January 1924 – 11 June 2015) was an English actor, composer, singer and writer. He was best known for his portrayal of Fagin in &quot;Oliver!&quot; (1968) and its 1983 Broadway revival. Moody earned a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award nomination for the film, as well as a Tony Award nomination for the stage production. Other notable projects include &quot;The Mouse on the Moon&quot; (1963), Mel Brooks&#x27; &quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot; (1970) and &quot;Flight of the Doves&quot; (1971), in which Moody shared the screen with &quot;Oliver!&quot; co-star Jack Wild.

==Early life and education==
Moody was born on 8 January 1924 in Tottenham, Middlesex, the son of Kate (née Ogus; 1898–1980) and Bernard/Barnett Moodnick (1896–1964), a studio executive. His father was a Russian Jew and his mother was a Lithuanian Jew; said Moody, &quot;I&#x27;m 100% Jewish—totally kosher!&quot; He was a cousin of director Laurence Moody and actress Clare Lawrence. His surname was legally changed to the more anglicised Moody in 1930.

Moody was educated at Southgate County School, which at the time was a state grammar school, and based in Palmers Green, Middlesex, followed by the London School of Economics in Central London, where he trained to become an economist. During World War II, he enlisted in the Royal Air Force (RAF) and became a radar technician.

==Career==
Despite training to be an economist, Moody began appearing in theatrical shows and later decided to become a professional actor.
Moody worked in a variety of genres, but he is perhaps best known for his starring role as Fagin in Lionel Bart&#x27;s stage and film musical &quot;Oliver!&quot; based on &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; by Charles Dickens. He created the role in the original West End production in 1960 and reprised it in the 1984 Broadway revival, receiving a Tony Award nomination for Best Actor in a Musical. For his performance in the 1968 film &quot;Oliver!&quot;, he received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor (Musical/Comedy), the Best Actor award at the 6th Moscow International Film Festival and an Academy Award nomination in the same category. Reflecting on the role, Moody states: &quot;Fate destined me to play Fagin. It was the part of a lifetime. That summer of 1967 [during filming] was one of the happiest times of my life&quot;. He reprised his role as Fagin in the 1983 Channel 4 television programme &quot;The Other Side of London&quot;, and again at the 1985 Royal Variety Performance in Theatre Royal, Drury Lane before Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh.

Moody appeared in several children&#x27;s television series, including the voice of Badger and Toad in the TV Adaptation of Colin Dann&#x27;s &quot;The Animals of Farthing Wood&quot;, &quot;Noah&#x27;s Island&quot;, &quot;Telebugs&quot;, and &quot;Into the Labyrinth&quot;. Among his better known roles was that of Prime Minister Rupert Mountjoy in the comedy &quot;The Mouse on the Moon&quot; (1963), alongside Margaret Rutherford, with whom he appeared again the following year in &quot;Murder Most Foul&quot; (1964), one of Rutherford&#x27;s Miss Marple films. He played French entertainer and mime artist The Great Orlando in the 1963 Cliff Richard film &quot;Summer Holiday&quot;. He appeared as Hopkirk in the 1966 episode entitled &quot;Honey For the Prince&quot; of &quot;The Avengers&quot;. He acted again with former &quot;Oliver!&quot; co-star Jack Wild in &quot;Flight of the Doves&quot; (1971). 

In 1969, Moody was offered, but declined, the lead role in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, following the departure of Patrick Troughton from the part. He later told many people (including &quot;Doctor Who&quot; companion Elisabeth Sladen) that declining the role was a decision he subsequently regretted. He played Ippolit Vorobyaninov alongside Frank Langella (as Ostap Bender) in Mel Brooks&#x27; version of &quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot; (1970).In 1995 he appeared in the UK&#x27;s longest running TV comedy series &#x27;Last of the Summer Wine&#x27; as Lieutenant Willoughby. In 2003, he starred in the black comedy &quot;Paradise Grove&quot; alongside Rula Lenska, and played Edwin Caldecott, an old nemesis of Jim Branning on the BBC soap &quot;EastEnders&quot;. In 2005, he acted in the Big Finish Productions &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio play &quot;Other Lives&quot;, playing the Duke of Wellington. He made several appearances in BBC TVs long running variety show, &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;, enacting pastiche/comic Victorian melodramas.

Moody wrote a novel, &quot;The Devil You Don&#x27;t&quot;, which was published by Robson Books, London, in 1980. 

In 2004, the British ITV1 nostalgia series &quot;After They Were Famous&quot; hosted a documentary of the surviving cast of the film &quot;Oliver!&quot; Several of the film&#x27;s musical numbers were reenacted. Moody, then 80 but still spry, and Jack Wild (seriously ill with oral cancer at the time) recreated their dance from the closing credits of the film.

Moody was a guest star in an episode of ITV’s long running police drama &quot;The Bill&quot; in 2004 along with actress Molly Sugden and appeared in BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Casualty&quot; (aired on 30 January 2010) as a Scottish patient who had served with the Black Watch during the Second World War. On 30 June 2010, Moody appeared on stage at the end of a performance of Cameron Mackintosh&#x27;s revival of &quot;Oliver!&quot; and made a humorous speech about the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary. He then reprised the &quot;Pick a Pocket or Two&quot; number with the cast.

Moody was a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur F.C.

==Personal life==
Moody married a Pilates teacher, Therese Blackbourn, in 1985. The couple had six children. Catherine Laura (B. July 1986), Daniel Maxmillian (B. September 1988), Matthew Alexander (B. Sept 1990), Micheal Orlando (B. July 1992), Jonathan Barnaby (B. April 1994) &amp; Conrad Augustus (B. July 1996) who manage the family business Pilates On The Green Limited located in Southgate, London. 

==Death==
Moody died of natural causes while in a London hospital on 11 June 2015, aged 91.

<text>Emigration is the act of leaving a resident country or place of residence with the intent to settle elsewhere (to permanently leave a country). Conversely, immigration describes the movement of people into one country from another (to permanently move to a country). A migrant &quot;emigrates&quot; from their old country, and &quot;immigrates&quot; to their new country. Thus, both emigration and immigration describe migration, but from different countries&#x27; perspectives. 

Demographers examine push and pull factors for people to be pushed out of one place and attracted to another. There can be a desire to escape negative circumstances such as shortages of land or jobs, or unfair treatment. People can be pulled to the opportunities available elsewhere. Fleeing from oppressive conditions, being a refugee and seeking asylum to get refugee status in a foreign country, may lead to permanent emigration.

Forced displacement refers to groups that are forced to abandon their native country, such as by enforced population transfer or the threat of ethnic cleansing. Refugees and asylum seekers in this sense are the most marginalized extreme cases of migration, facing multiple hurdles in their journey and efforts to integrate into the new settings. Scholars in this sense have called for cross-sector engagement from businesses, non-governmental organizations, educational institutions, and other stakeholders within the receiving communities.

== History ==

Patterns of emigration have been shaped by numerous economic, social, and political changes throughout the world in the last few hundred years. For instance, millions of individuals fled poverty, violence, and political turmoil in Europe to settle in the Americas and Oceania during the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. Likewise, millions left South China in the Chinese diaspora during the 19th and early 20th centuries.

== &quot;Push&quot; and &quot;pull&quot; factors==

Demographers distinguish factors at the origin that push people out, versus those at the destination that pull them in. Motives to migrate can be either incentives attracting people away, known as &quot;pull&quot; factors, or circumstances encouraging a person to leave. Diversity of push and pull factors inform management scholarship in their efforts to understand migrant movement.

=== Push factors ===
* Poor living conditions or overcrowding
* Lack of employment or entrepreneurial opportunities
* Lack of educational opportunities
* Threat of arrest or punishment
* Persecution or intolerance based on race, religion, gender or sexual orientation
* Political corruption, lack of government transparency or freedom of speech
* Inability to find a spouse for marriage
* Lack of freedom to choose religion, or to choose no religion
* Resource depletion, scarcity or austerity
* Military draft, warfare or terrorism
* Expulsion by armed force or coercion
* Recession or economic collapse
* Famine or drought
* Cultural fights with other cultural groups

=== Pull factors ===
*Higher quality of life, economic growth or lower cost of living
*Encouragement to join relatives or fellow countrymen; chain migration
*Quick wealth (as in a gold rush)
*More job opportunities or promise of higher pay
*Prosperity or economic surplus
*Educational opportunity (including university for adults or K-12 for children)
*Prepaid travel (as from relatives)
*Building a new nation (historically)
*Building specific cultural or religious communities
*Political freedom
*Cultural opportunities
*Greater opportunity to find a spouse
*Favorable climate 
*Ease of crossing boundaries
*Reduced tariff

=== Criticism ===
Some scholars criticize the &quot;push-pull&quot; approach to understanding international migration. Regarding lists of positive or negative factors about a place, Jose C. Moya writes &quot;one could easily compile similar lists for periods and places where no migration took place.&quot;

==Emigration waves by country==

*Jews escaping from German-occupied Europe
*Yerida (Jewish emigration from Israel)
*Swedish emigration to the United States

== Statistics ==

Unlike immigration, in many countries few if any records have been recorded or maintained in regard to persons leaving a country either on a temporary or permanent basis. Therefore, estimates on emigration must be derived from secondary sources such as immigration records of the receiving country or records from other administrative agencies.

The rate of emigration has continued to grow, reaching 280 million in 2017.

In Armenia, for example, the migration is calculated by counting people arriving or leaving the country via airplane, train, railway or other means of transportation. Here, the emigration index is high: 1.5% of population leaves the country annually. In fact, it is one of the countries, where emigration has become a part of culture since 20th century. For example, between 1990 and 2005 approximately 700,000–1,300,000 Armenians left the country. The highly rising numbers of emigration are a direct response to socio-political and economic areas of the country. The internal migration (migration in country) is big (28.7%), while international migration is 71.3% of the total migration by people aging 15 and above. It is important to understand the reasons for both types of migration and the availability of the options. For example, in Armenia, everything is localized in the capital city Yerevan, thus, internal migration is from the villages and small cities to the biggest city of the country. The reason for the migration can be work or study. International migration follows the same reasoning of migration: work or study. The main destinations for it are Russia, France and US.

== Emigration restrictions ==

Some countries restrict the ability of their citizens to emigrate to other countries. After 1668, the Qing Emperor banned Han Chinese migration to Manchuria. In 1681, the emperor ordered construction of the Willow Palisade, a barrier beyond which the Chinese were prohibited from encroaching on Manchu and Mongol lands.

The Soviet Socialist Republics of the later Soviet Union began such restrictions in 1918, with laws and borders tightening until even illegal emigration was nearly impossible by 1928. To strengthen this, they set up internal passport controls and individual city Propiska (&quot;place of residence&quot;) permits, along with internal freedom of movement restrictions often called the 101st kilometre, rules which greatly restricted mobility within even small areas.

At the end of World War II in 1945, the Soviet Union occupied several Central European countries, together called the Eastern Bloc, with the majority of those living in the newly acquired areas aspiring to independence and wanted the Soviets to leave. Before 1950, over 15 million people emigrated from the Soviet-occupied eastern European countries and immigrated into the west in the five years immediately following World War II. By the early 1950s, the Soviet approach to controlling national movement was emulated by most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc. Restrictions implemented in the Eastern Bloc stopped most east–west migration, with only 13.3 million migrations westward between 1950 and 1990. However, hundreds of thousands of East Germans annually immigrated to West Germany through a &quot;loophole&quot; in the system that existed between East and West Berlin, where the four occupying World War II powers governed movement. The emigration resulted in massive &quot;brain drain&quot; from East Germany to West Germany of younger educated professionals, such that nearly 20% of East Germany&#x27;s population had migrated to West Germany by 1961. In 1961, East Germany erected a barbed-wire barrier that would eventually be expanded through construction into the Berlin Wall, effectively closing the loophole. In 1989, the Berlin Wall fell, followed by German reunification and within two years the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

By the early 1950s, the Soviet approach to controlling international movement was also emulated by China, Mongolia, and North Korea. North Korea still tightly restricts emigration, and maintains one of the strictest emigration bans in the world, although some North Koreans still manage to illegally emigrate to China. Other countries with tight emigration restrictions at one time or another included Angola, Egypt, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Somalia, Afghanistan, Burma, Democratic Kampuchea (Cambodia from 1975 to 1979), Laos, North Vietnam, Iraq, South Yemen and Cuba.

<doc id="161912" wikidata="Q603263" url="?curid=161912" title="True Grit (1969 film)">
<text>True Grit is a 1969 American Western film directed by Henry Hathaway, starring John Wayne as U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn, Glen Campbell as La Boeuf and Kim Darby as Mattie Ross. It is the first film adaptation of Charles Portis&#x27; 1968 novel of the same name. The screenplay was written by Marguerite Roberts. Wayne won an Oscar for his performance in the film and reprised his character for the 1975 sequel &quot;Rooster Cogburn&quot;.

Historians believe Cogburn was based on Deputy U.S. Marshal Heck Thomas, who brought in some of the toughest outlaws. The cast also features Robert Duvall, Dennis Hopper, Jeff Corey and Strother Martin. The title song, sung by Campbell, was also Oscar-nominated.

The movie&#x27;s success launched a series of films including a 1975 sequel, a 1978 made-for-TV sequel, and a 2010 remake film adaptation.

==Plot==
In 1880, Frank Ross, of Yell County, Arkansas, is murdered and robbed by his hired hand, Tom Chaney. Ross&#x27;s young daughter, Mattie, travels to Fort Smith and hires aging U.S. Marshal Reuben &quot;Rooster&quot; J. Cogburn to apprehend Chaney. Mattie earns enough to pay his fee by horse trading. Meanwhile, Chaney has taken up with outlaw &quot;Lucky&quot; Ned Pepper in Indian Territory.

Young Texas Ranger La Boeuf is also pursuing Chaney and joins forces with Cogburn, despite Mattie&#x27;s protest. The two try, unsuccessfully, to ditch Mattie.

Days later, the three discover horse thieves Emmett Quincy and Moon, who are waiting for Pepper at a remote dugout cabin. Cogburn captures and interrogates the two men. Moon is shot in the leg during the capture, and Cogburn uses the injury as leverage for information about Pepper. Quincy slams a knife down on Moon&#x27;s hand to shut him up, severing four of his fingers, then kills him. Cogburn shoots Quincy dead. Before dying, Moon reveals Pepper and his gang are due at the cabin that night for fresh mounts.

Rooster and La Boeuf lay a trap. Upon arriving, Pepper is suspicious and draws La Boeuf&#x27;s fire, which blows cover of the planned ambush with a premature shot, inadvertently killing Pepper&#x27;s horse. A firefight ensues, during which Cogburn and La Boeuf kill two gang members, but Pepper and the rest of his men escape unharmed. Cogburn, La Boeuf, and Mattie go to McAlester&#x27;s store with the dead bodies. Cogburn tries, unsuccessfully, to persuade Mattie to stay at McAlester&#x27;s.

The two lawmen and Mattie resume their pursuit. Fetching water one morning, Mattie finds herself face-to-face with Chaney. She shoots Chaney with her father&#x27;s gun, injuring him, and then calling out to her partners. Chaney takes Mattie hostage when her gun misfires. Pepper and his gang arrive, Pepper takes charge of Mattie and threatens to kill her if Cogburn and La Boeuf do not ride away. Pepper leaves Mattie with Chaney, instructing him not to harm her.

Cogburn and La Boeuf double back. La Boeuf finds and takes charge of Mattie, and they watch from a high bluff as Cogburn confronts Pepper and his gang of three. Cogburn gives Pepper a choice between being killed now, or surrendering and being hanged in Fort Smith. Pepper starts mocking Cogburn.

Enraged, Cogburn charges the outlaws, guns blazing, and manages to hit Ned in the chest. Cogburn eventually kills the Parmalee brothers, with &quot;Dirty Bob&quot; fleeing. Severely wounded, Ned has enough strength to shoot Rooster&#x27;s horse, trapping Rooster&#x27;s leg under him as Bo goes down. Pepper prepares to kill Rooster, but La Boeuf makes a long shot with his rifle, killing Ned.

As La Boeuf and Mattie return to Pepper&#x27;s camp, Chaney comes out from behind a tree and strikes La Boeuf with a rock, knocking him unconscious. Mattie shoots Chaney again, but the gun&#x27;s recoil knocks her back into a snake pit. Her arm is broken in the fall and she is caught in a hole, drawing the attention of a rattlesnake. Cogburn appears and shoots Chaney, who falls into the pit, dead. Cogburn lowers himself down into the pit to retrieve Mattie, who is bitten by the snake before he shoots and kills it. La Boeuf helps them out of the pit before dying.

Cogburn is forced to leave La Boeuf behind as he and Mattie race to get help on Mattie&#x27;s pony, which drops from exhaustion, forcing Cogburn to commandeer a wagon to get Mattie to a doctor in the territory. Later, Mattie&#x27;s attorney, J. Noble Daggett, meets Cogburn in Fort Smith. On Mattie&#x27;s behalf, Daggett pays Cogburn the remainder of his fee in Chaney&#x27;s capture, plus a $200 bonus for saving her life. Cogburn offers to wager the money on a bet that Mattie will recover just fine, a bet Daggett declines.

Mattie, her arm in a sling, is back at home recovering from her injuries. She promises Cogburn he will be buried next to her in the Ross family plot after his death. Cogburn accepts her offer and leaves, jumping over a fence on his new horse to disprove her good-natured jab that he was too old and fat to clear a four-rail fence.

==Production==
Hathaway says he decided to make the film like &quot;a fairytale... a fantasy that I couched in as realistic terms as possible.&quot;

Filming took place mainly in Ouray County, Colorado, in the vicinity of Ridgway (now the home of the True Grit Cafe), around the town of Montrose (in Montrose County), and the town of Ouray. (The script maintains the novel&#x27;s references to place names in Arkansas and Oklahoma, in dramatic contrast to the Colorado topography.) The courtroom scenes were filmed at Ouray County Courthouse in Ouray.

The scenes that take place at the &quot;dugout&quot; and along the creek where Quincy and Moon are killed, as well as the scene where Rooster carries Mattie on her horse Little Blackie after the snakebite, were filmed at Hot Creek on the east side of the Sierra Nevada near the town of Mammoth Lakes, California. Mount Morrison and Laurel Mountain form the backdrop above the creek. This location was also used in &quot;North to Alaska&quot;. Filming was done from September to December 1968.

Mia Farrow was originally cast as Mattie and was keen on the role. However, prior to filming, she made the film &quot;Secret Ceremony&quot; in England with Robert Mitchum, who advised her not to work with director Henry Hathaway because he was &quot;cantankerous&quot;. Farrow asked producer Hal B. Wallis to replace Hathaway with Roman Polanski, who had directed Farrow in &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;, but Wallis refused. Farrow quit the film, which was then offered to Michele Carey, Sondra Locke and Tuesday Weld, but all three were under contract for another film. John Wayne met Karen Carpenter at a talent show he was hosting and recommended her for the part, though the producers decided against it because she had no acting experience. Wayne had also lobbied for his daughter Aissa to win the part. Olivia Hussey was also offered the role by Wallis, but the offer was rescinded after she said she &quot;couldn&#x27;t see herself with Wayne&quot; and said that he &quot;can&#x27;t act.&quot; After also considering Sally Field, the role went to Kim Darby.

Elvis Presley was the original choice for LaBoeuf, but the producers turned him down when his agent demanded top billing over both Wayne and Darby. Glen Campbell was then cast instead. In multiple interviews, Campbell claimed that Wayne, along with his daughter, approached him backstage at his show, and asked him if he would like to be in a movie.

Wayne began lobbying for the part of Rooster Cogburn after reading the novel by Charles Portis.

Wayne called Marguerite Roberts&#x27; script &quot;the best script he had ever read&quot;, and was instrumental in getting her script approved and credited to her name after Roberts had been blacklisted for alleged leftist affiliations years before. This came in spite of Wayne&#x27;s own conservative ideals. He particularly liked the scene with Darby where Rooster tells Mattie about his life in Illinois (where he has a restaurant, his wife Nola leaves him because of his degenerate friends, and has a clumsy son named Horace), calling it &quot;about the best scene I ever did&quot;. Garry Wills notes in his book, &quot;John Wayne&#x27;s America: The Politics of Celebrity&quot;, that Wayne&#x27;s performance as Rooster Cogburn bears close resemblance to the way Wallace Beery portrayed similar characters in the 1930s and 1940s, an inspired if surprising choice on Wayne&#x27;s part. Wills comments that it is difficult for one actor to imitate another for the entire length of a movie and that the Beery mannerisms temporarily recede during the aforementioned scene in which Cogburn discusses his wife and child.

Veteran John Wayne stunt-double Tom Gosnell does the stunt in the meadow, where &quot;Bo&quot; goes down, on his longtime horse Twinkle Toes. In the last scene, Mattie gives Rooster her father&#x27;s gun. She comments that he has gotten a tall horse, as she expected he would. He notes that his new horse can jump a four-rail fence. Then she admonishes him, &quot;You&#x27;re too old and fat to be jumping horses.&quot; Rooster responds with a smile, saying, &quot;Well, come see a fat old man sometime,&quot; and jumps his new horse over a four-rail fence. Although many of Wayne&#x27;s stunts over the years were done by Chuck Hayward and Chuck Roberson, it is Wayne on Twinkle Toes going over the fence. This stunt had been left to the last shot as Wayne wanted to do it himself and following his lung surgery in 1965, neither Hathaway nor Wayne was sure he could make the jump. Darby&#x27;s stunts were done by Polly Burson.

The horse shown during the final scene of &quot;True Grit&quot; (before he jumps the fence on Twinkle Toes) was Dollor, a two-year-old (in 1969) chestnut Quarter Horse gelding. Dollor (&#x27;Ol Dollor) was Wayne&#x27;s favorite horse for 10 years. Wayne fell in love with the horse, which carried him through several more Westerns, including his final movie, &quot;The Shootist&quot;. Wayne had Dollor written into the script of &quot;The Shootist&quot; because of his love for the horse; it was a condition for him working on the project. Wayne would not let anyone else ride the horse, the lone exception being Robert Wagner, who rode the horse in a segment of the &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; television show, after Wayne&#x27;s death.
After reading &quot;True Grit&quot; by Charles Portis, John Wayne was enthusiastic about playing the part of Rooster Cogburn, but as production got closer, Wayne got jumpy — he did not have a handle on how to play Rooster Cogburn. He was, of course, nervous because the part was out of his comfort zone and had not been specifically tailored to his screen character by one of his in-house screenwriters. Henry Hathaway, who directed the film, calmed Wayne&#x27;s doubts, most notably concerning the eye patch which was made of gauze, allowing Wayne to see. John Wayne thought the picture had been edited too tightly by Hathaway. Nevertheless, in May 1969, a few weeks before the picture was released, Wayne wrote to Marguerite Roberts thanking her for her &quot;magnificent&quot; screenplay, especially for the beautiful ending in the cemetery that she had devised in Portis&#x27;s style. Wayne and Kim Darby worked very well together, but Henry Hathaway disliked her, stating: &quot;My problem with her was simple, she&#x27;s not particularly attractive, so her book of tricks consisted mostly [of] being a little cute. All through the film, I had to stop her from acting funny, doing bits of business and so forth.&quot;

By the time the picture got back to the studio interiors, Kim Darby told Hal Wallis she would never work for Hathaway again. John Wayne was another matter. &quot;He was wonderful to work with, he really was&quot;, said Darby. &quot;When you work with someone who&#x27;s a big star as he is ... there&#x27;s an unspoken thing that they sort of set the environment for the working conditions on the set and the feeling on the set. And he creates an environment that is very safe to work in. He&#x27;s very supportive of the people around him and the people he works with, very supportive. He&#x27;s really a reflection, an honest reflection, of what he really is. I mean that&#x27;s what you see on the screen. He&#x27;s simple and direct, and I love that in his work.&quot; Surrounded by an angry director, a nervous actress, and the inexperienced Glen Campbell, Wayne took the reins between his teeth the same way Rooster Cogburn does in the climax of the film. &quot;He was there on the set before anyone else and knew every line perfectly&quot;, said Kim Darby. Both Wayne and Hathaway had difficulties with Robert Duvall, with the director having constant shouting matches with his supporting actor, and Duvall and Wayne nearly coming to blows.

Hathaway says Campbell &quot;was so damn lazy&quot; and had troubles with Darby (&quot;I had to stop her from acting funny&quot;.)

The film was initially given an M rating when it was submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America&#x27;s rating board. The filmmakers subsequently edited &quot;four-letter words&quot; out of some scenes to accommodate a G rating.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film premiered in Little Rock, Arkansas on June 12, 1969, and opened at the Chinese theatre in Los Angeles on June 13, 1969 where it grossed $38,000 in its first week. After 11 weeks, it reached number one at the US box office and returned to the top three weeks later.

The film earned an estimated $11.5 million in rentals at the United States and Canada box office during its first year of release.

===Critical reception===

 John Simon wrote, &quot;Worthy of succinct notice is &quot;True Grit&quot;&#x27;, an amusing, unassuming western, antiheroic with a vengeance.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
John Wayne won the Academy Award for Best Actor. Upon accepting his Oscar, Wayne said, &quot;Wow! If I&#x27;d known that, I&#x27;d have put that patch on 35 years earlier.&quot;

==Sequels and other film versions==
A film sequel, &quot;Rooster Cogburn&quot;, was made in 1975, with Wayne reprising his role and Katharine Hepburn as an elderly spinster, Eula Goodnight, who teams with him. The plot has been described as a rehash of the original &quot;True Grit&quot; with elements of the Bogart–Hepburn film &quot;The African Queen&quot;. A further made-for-television sequel titled &quot;True Grit: A Further Adventure&quot; appeared in 1978, starring Warren Oates as Rooster Cogburn and Lisa Pelikan as Mattie Ross.

In 2010, Joel and Ethan Coen directed another adaptation of the novel. Their adaptation focuses more on Mattie&#x27;s point of view, as in the novel, and is somewhat more faithful to its Oklahoma setting—though it was filmed in New Mexico. Hailee Steinfeld portrays Mattie Ross, Jeff Bridges plays Rooster Cogburn, and the cast includes Matt Damon as La Boeuf and Josh Brolin as Tom Chaney.

<text>Melvyn Douglas (born Melvyn Edouard Hesselberg, April 5, 1901 – August 4, 1981) was an American actor. Douglas came to prominence in 1929 as a suave leading man, perhaps best typified by his performance in the romantic comedy &quot;Ninotchka&quot; (1939) with Greta Garbo. Douglas later played mature and fatherly characters, as in his Academy Award-winning performances in &quot;Hud&quot; (1963) and &quot;Being There&quot; (1979) and his Academy Award–nominated performance in &quot;I Never Sang for My Father&quot; (1970). Douglas was one of 24 performers to win the Triple Crown of Acting. In the last few years of his life Douglas appeared in films with supernatural stories involving ghosts, including &quot;The Changeling&quot; in 1980 and &quot;Ghost Story&quot; in 1981, his last completed film role.

==Early life==
Douglas was born in Macon, Georgia, the son of Lena Priscilla (née Shackelford) and Edouard Gregory Hesselberg, a concert pianist and composer. His father was a Jewish emigrant from Riga, Latvia, then part of the Russian Empire. His mother, a native of Tennessee, was Protestant and a &quot;Mayflower&quot; descendant.

Douglas, in his autobiography, &quot;See You at the Movies&quot; (1987), wrote that he was unaware of his Jewish background until later in his youth: &quot;I did not learn about the non-Christian part of my heritage until my early teens.&quot; His parents preferred to hide his Jewish heritage. His aunts, on his father&#x27;s side, told him &quot;the truth&quot; when he was 14. He wrote that he &quot;admired them unstintingly&quot;; they in turn, treated him like a son.

Though his father, a prominent concert pianist, taught music at a succession of colleges in the U.S. and Canada, Douglas never graduated from high school. He took the surname of his maternal grandmother and became known as Melvyn Douglas.

==Career==
Douglas developed his acting skills in Shakespearean repertory while in his teens and with stock companies in Sioux City, Iowa, Evansville, Indiana, Madison, Wisconsin and Detroit, Michigan. He served in the United States Army in World War I. He established an outdoor theatre in Chicago. He had a long theatre, film and television career as a lead player, stretching from his 1930 Broadway role in &quot;Tonight or Never&quot; (opposite his future wife, Helen Gahagan) until just before his death. Douglas shared top billing with Boris Karloff and Charles Laughton in James Whale&#x27;s sardonic horror classic &quot;The Old Dark House&quot; in 1932. 

Douglas appeared as the hero in the 1932 horror film &quot;The Vampire Bat&quot; and the sophisticated leading man in &quot;She Married Her Boss&quot; (1935). He appeared with Joan Crawford in several films, most notably &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Face&quot; (1941), and starred opposite Greta Garbo in three films: &quot;As You Desire Me&quot; (1932), &quot;Ninotchka&quot; (1939) and Garbo&#x27;s final film &quot;Two-Faced Woman&quot; (1941). One of his most sympathetic roles was as the belatedly attentive father in &quot;Captains Courageous&quot; (1937).

During World War II, Douglas served first as a director of the Arts Council in the Office of Civilian Defense, and he then again served in the United States Army rising to the rank of major in the Special Services Entertainment Production Unit. According to his granddaughter Illeana Douglas, Melvyn Douglas first met Peter Sellers, his future &quot;Being There&quot; co-star while in Burma, when Sellers was serving in the Royal Air Force during the war. After the war, Douglas returned to films and more mature roles in &quot;The Sea of Grass&quot; (1947) and &quot;Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House&quot; (1948).

From 1952 to 1961, Douglas made no film appearances, concentrating instead on stage and television work. During November 1952 to January 1953, Douglas starred in the DuMont detective show &quot;Steve Randall&quot; (&quot;Hollywood Off Beat&quot;) which then moved to CBS. In the summer of 1953, he briefly hosted the DuMont game show &quot;Blind Date&quot;. In the summer of 1959, Douglas hosted eleven original episodes of a CBS Western anthology television series called &quot;Frontier Justice&quot;, a production of Dick Powell&#x27;s Four Star Television.

Douglas returned to films in the 1960s. As he aged, he took on older-man and fatherly roles in movies such as &quot;Hud&quot; (1963), for which he won his first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, &quot;The Americanization of Emily&quot; (1964), the American Civil War comedy &quot;Advance to the Rear&quot; (1964), an episode of &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1966), &quot;I Never Sang for My Father&quot; (1970), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and &quot;The Candidate&quot; (1972). He won his second Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the comedy-drama &quot;Being There&quot; (1979). However, Douglas confirmed in one of his final interviews that he refused to attend the 52nd Academy Awards ceremony because he could not bear having to compete against child actor Justin Henry for &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot;.

In addition to his Academy Awards, Douglas won a Tony Award for his Broadway lead role in the 1960 &quot;The Best Man&quot; by Gore Vidal and an Emmy for his 1967 role in &quot;Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night&quot;. 

Douglas&#x27; final complete screen appearance was in the 1981 horror film &quot;Ghost Story&quot;. He died before completing all of his scenes for the film &quot;The Hot Touch&quot; (1982); the film had to be edited to compensate for Douglas&#x27; incomplete role. 

Douglas has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame; one for movies located at 6423 Hollywood Boulevard and another for television at 6601 Hollywood Boulevard.

== Personal life ==
Douglas, as Hesselberg, was married briefly to artist Rosalind Hightower, and they had one child, (Melvyn) Gregory Hesselberg,&lt;ref name=&quot;gt/GH&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in 1926.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/obit/melvyn-douglas&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hesselberg, an artist, is the father of actress Illeana Douglas. 

In 1931, Douglas married actress-turned-politician Helen Gahagan. They traveled to Europe that same year, and &quot;were horrified by French and German anti-Semitism&quot;. As a result, they became outspoken anti-fascists. 

Gahagan Douglas (she began using her husband&#x27;s name when she entered politics), as a three-term congresswoman, was Richard M. Nixon&#x27;s unsuccessful opponent for the United States Senate seat from California in 1950. Nixon accused Gahagan Douglas of being soft on Communism because of her opposition to the House Un-American Activities Committee. Nixon went so far as to infamously call her &quot;pink right down to her underwear&quot;. It was Gahagan Douglas who popularized Nixon&#x27;s epithet nickname &quot;Tricky Dick&quot;.

Melvyn and Helen Gahagan Douglas hired architect Roland Coate to design a home for them in 1938 on a lot they owned in Outpost Estates, Los Angeles. The result was a one-story, home.

The Douglases had two children: Peter Gahagan Douglas (1933) and Mary Helen Douglas (1938). The couple remained married until Helen Gahagan Douglas&#x27;s death in 1980 from cancer. Melvyn Douglas died a year later, in 1981, aged 80, from pneumonia and cardiac complications in New York City.

<text>I Never Sang for My Father is a 1970 American drama film. It tells the story of a widowed college professor who feels dominated by his aging father, yet still has regrets about his plan to leave him behind when he remarries and moves to California. It stars Melvyn Douglas, Gene Hackman, Dorothy Stickney, Estelle Parsons, and Elizabeth Hubbard.

The film was produced and directed by Gilbert Cates, and Robert Anderson adapted the screenplay from his 1968 Broadway play.

It was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Melvyn Douglas), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Gene Hackman), and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium (Robert Anderson).

==Plot==
At the airport, college professor Gene Garrison meets his parents who have returned from Florida. After driving them home, he takes them out to dinner. Back home, he spends the evening with them. The barbs of his father, Tom, run through his mind as he drives home. Gene seeks solace in the arms of Norma, a woman he&#x27;s been seeing, who pines for a more serious relationship with him. Soon after, his mother, Margaret, suffers a heart attack and is hospitalized. Upon visiting her at the hospital, Gene finds Tom pacing in the waiting room. Tom asks Gene to go to the Rotary Club with him, though Gene was expecting not to leave his mother&#x27;s side.

When Margaret dies, Gene helps his father shop for a casket. His sister, Alice, arrives without her husband and children. She explains to Gene that Tom&#x27;s failing memory and health will require constant care either in a nursing home or with live-in assistance. She broaches the idea with their father, who rejects it outright. The conversation brings up old tensions about Tom&#x27;s disinheritance of Alice over her taking a Jewish spouse. Alice leaves Gene to deal with their father by himself.

Gene&#x27;s girlfriend Peggy arrives for a visit. She is charmed by Tom and offers to relocate to New York to live with Gene and his father. That night, Gene and Tom reminisce together over old photographs. Tom&#x27;s love for his son comes shining through in their conversation and he asks about a tune that Gene used to sing for him as a boy. Gene confesses that he never sang the tune for his father, but Tom recalls otherwise. Gene tells Tom that he is thinking about moving to California to be with Peggy, where she has a successful gynecological practice. Tom becomes irate at the notion, feeling abandoned. Gene leaves the house with Peggy and never comes back.

==Production==
===Original play===
Gilbert Cates had been one of the producers of the original stage play together with Doris Warner Vidor. Directed by Alan Schneider and starring Alan Webb, Lillian Gish and Hal Holbrook, it initially ran for 124 performances in New York in 1968 and lost most of its $195,000 investment. The story was widely considered to be quasi-autobiographical.

The play was profiled in the William Goldman book &quot;The Season: A Candid Look at Broadway&quot;.

===Filming===
The film was shot at several locations, including Southern California and the Great Neck-Douglaston area of New York. Applauded by critics and viewers, the film (and play)
predicted the coming of the sandwich generation, in this case, grown children and other family members helping their elderly parents who are up in age.

==Critical reception==
Roger Ebert summarized the film in his review: &quot;These bare bones of plot hardly give any hint of the power of this film. I&#x27;ve suggested something of what it&#x27;s about, but almost nothing about the way the writing, the direction, and the performances come together to create one of the most unforgettably human films I can remember.&quot;

Vincent Canby, in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, was far less complimentary, writing &quot;(The film) does the human spirit a disservice in the way it pleads for sympathy for people who are small and flat, like comic strip characters, without sweetness, without imagination, without any suspected reserves of emotion. Indeed, it almost becomes ridiculous when you realize that it is without any honest problem, either psychological or economic.&quot; Murf. of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot; dull, distended, and lacking clear point of view&quot;l however he called the performances of the lead actors &quot;superb&quot;.

<doc id="161916" wikidata="Q7737991" url="?curid=161916" title="The Great White Hope">
<text>The Great White Hope is a 1967 play written by Howard Sackler, later adapted in 1970 for a film of the same name.

The play was first produced by Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., and debuted on Broadway at the Alvin Theatre in October 1968, directed by Edwin Sherin with James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander in the lead roles. The play won the 1969 Tony Award for Best Play and the 1969 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. With the only singing role as Barbara Johnson Tucker. Subsequent touring companies of the play featured Brock Peters and Claudette Nevins in the lead roles.

The play is based on the true story of Jack Johnson (fictionalized under the character name &quot;Jack Jefferson&quot;) and his fight against Jim Jeffries, and also covers the controversy over his marriage to first wife, Etta Terry Duryea, and Duryea&#x27;s death by suicide in 1912.

==Background==
While the play is often described as being thematically about racism, this is not how Sackler viewed his work. Though not denying the racist issues confronted in the play, Sackler once said in an interview, &quot;What interested me was not the topicality but the combination of circumstances, the destiny of a man pitted against society. It&#x27;s a metaphor of struggle between man and the outside world. Some people spoke of the play as if it were a cliché of white liberalism, but I kept to the line straight through, of showing that it wasn&#x27;t a case of blacks being good and whites being bad. I was appalled at the first reaction.&quot;

In a comment, reflecting on both the racist theme dealt with in the play and Sackler&#x27;s notion that the play is about a man fighting society, Muhammad Ali, greatly impressed with James Earl Jones&#x27; performance in the play, reportedly commented to the actor, &quot;Hey! This play is about me! Take out the interracial love stuff and Jack Johnson is the original me!&quot; He added, &quot;You just change the time, date and the details and it&#x27;s about me!&quot; Ali was fighting being drafted into the Army at the time on grounds of being a conscientious objector.

== Productions ==
&quot;The Great White Hope&quot; premiered at the Arena Stage in December 1967.

The initial production at Arena Stage, paid for in part by two grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, was so well-received that the entire original cast, including James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander, moved to Broadway. It was the first time the cast of a regional theater production was brought to Broadway. The play opened on Broadway on October 3, 1968, and closed on January 31, 1970, after 546 performances. Using proceeds from his screenwriting contract, Sackler substantially funded the Broadway production by investing a reported US$225,000. In addition to winning the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, Jones won the 1969 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play and Alexander won the 1969 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play, as well as the Drama Desk Award for each, for their respective portrayals of Jack Jefferson and Eleanor Bachman. A recording of the production was released by Tetragrammaton Records.

Yaphet Kotto replaced Jones and Maria Tucci replaced Alexander on September 8, 1969.

In 2000, Arena Stage mounted a new production of &quot;The Great White Hope&quot; in honor of the theater&#x27;s 50th season.

== Film adaptation ==
&quot;The Great White Hope&quot; was adapted by Sackler for a film released in 1970, directed by Martin Ritt, starring James Earl Jones, Jane Alexander, Chester Morris, Hal Holbrook, Beah Richards and Moses Gunn. Jones and Alexander, who both had starred in the theatrical version, each received best actor Academy Award nominations for their performances. The Oscars for their categories were ultimately presented to George C. Scott for &quot;Patton&quot;, and Glenda Jackson for &quot;Women in Love.&quot;

In the movie, the role of &quot;the Kid,&quot; or the &quot;great white hope,&quot; was played by professional heavyweight boxer James J. Beattie (6&#x27;9&quot;, 240 pounds), the #10-ranked world heavyweight contender and an Ali sparring partner.

== &quot;The Great White Hope&quot; ==
The term, &quot;the great white hope,&quot; reflects the racism and segregation of the era in which Jack Johnson fought. Johnson, the first African American to hold the World Heavyweight Championship title, was one of the best fighters of his generation. Yet, white reaction against Johnson&#x27;s win and his very public relationships with white women was so strong that, in 1912, the United States Congress, concerned that film scenes of Johnson pummeling white boxers would cause race riots, passed a law making it illegal to transport prizefight films across state lines. &quot;The great white hope&quot; is a reference to the white boxer who many white people hoped would finally defeat Johnson.

William Warren Barbour, who won the American and Canadian amateur heavyweight championship in 1910 and 1911, respectively, was &quot;Gentleman Jim&quot; Corbett&#x27;s choice to be &quot;the great white hope,&quot; but Barbour declined to take up the mantle. Some 30 years later, it was Barbour who, as U.S. Senator (R) from New Jersey in 1940, worked successfully to repeal the 1912 law prohibiting interstate transportation of boxing film footage. About 30 years after that, William Warren Barbour&#x27;s nephew, Thomas Barbour, played four small parts, including Sir William Griswald, in the Broadway production of &quot;The Great White Hope.&quot;

The first &quot;great white hope&quot; boxer to accept the challenge was Jim Jeffries, who came out of retirement to fight Johnson unsuccessfully in 1910. Johnson&#x27;s title was eventually lost to Jess Willard, a white boxer, in 1915. There was some controversy surrounding Willard&#x27;s win, with Johnson claiming he threw the fight. In part because of white animosity toward Johnson, it was 20 years before another African American boxer was allowed to contend for the world professional heavyweight title. In 1937, Joe Louis defeated James J. Braddock, &quot;The Cinderella Man,&quot; to become the second African-American boxer to hold the world heavyweight championship title.

<doc id="161917" wikidata="Q317797" url="?curid=161917" title="Gulbuddin Hekmatyar">
<text>Gulbuddin Hekmatyar (born 1 August 1949) is an Afghan politician, and former mujahideen leader and drug trafficker. He is the founder and current leader of the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin political party, so called after Mohammad Yunus Khalis split from Hezbi Islami in 1979 to found Hezb-i Islami Khalis. He twice served as prime minister during the 1990s.

Hekmatyar joined the Muslim Youth organization as a student in the early 1970s, where he was known for his Islamic radicalism rejected by much of the organization. He spent time in Pakistan before returning to Afghanistan when the Soviet–Afghan War began in 1979, at which time the CIA began funding his rapidly growing Hezb-e Islami organization through the Pakistani intelligence service, ISI, one of the largest of the Afghan mujahideen. He received more CIA funding than any other mujahideen leader during the Soviet-Afghan War.

In the late 1980s Hekmatyar and his organization used the funds and weapons provided to them by the CIA to start trafficking opium, and later moved into manufacturing heroin. He established himself and his group amongst the leading heroin suppliers in the Middle East. Given the CIA&#x27;s connection, this became a subject of diplomatic embarrassment for the US foreign service. Following the ouster of Soviet-backed Afghan President Mohammad Najibullah in 1992, Hekmatyar declined to form part of the new government and, with other warlords, engaged in the Afghan civil war, leading to the death of around 50,000 civilians in Kabul alone. Hekmatyar was accused of bearing the most responsibility for the rocket attacks on the city. In the meantime, as part of the peace and power-sharing efforts led by Ahmad Shah Massoud, Hekmatyar became Prime Minister of Afghanistan from 1993 to 1994 and again briefly in 1996, before the Taliban takeover of Kabul forced him to flee to Iran&#x27;s capital Tehran.

Sometime after the Taliban&#x27;s fall in 2001 he went to Pakistan, leading his paramilitary forces into an unsuccessful armed campaign against Hamid Karzai&#x27;s government and the international coalition in Afghanistan.

In 2016, he signed a peace deal with the Afghan government and was allowed to return to Afghanistan after almost 20 years in exile. Following the collapse of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, on 17 August 2021, Hekmatyar met with both Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, former chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation and former chief executive, in Doha seeking to form a government. However they were subdued as the Taliban formed a non-inclusive government in September 2021. Hekmatyar remains in Kabul.

==Early life==
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was born in 1949 in Imam Saheb, Kunduz province, in the north of what was then the Kingdom of Afghanistan, a member of the Kharoti tribe of Ghilji Pashtuns. His father, Ghulam Qader, who migrated to Kunduz, is originally from the Ghazni province. Afghan businessman and Kharoti tribal leader Gholam Serwar Nasher deemed Hekmatyar to be a bright young man and sent him to the Mahtab Qala military academy in 1968, but he was expelled due to his political views two years later. From 1969 to 1972, Hekmatyar attended Kabul University&#x27;s engineering department. During his first year at the university he wrote a 149-page book entitled &quot;The Priority of Sense Over Matter&quot;, where he refutes communists denying the existence of God by quoting European philosophers and scientists like Hegel or Francesco Redi. Though he did not complete his degree, his followers still address him as &quot;Engineer Hekmatyar&quot;.

During his years in university, Hekmatyar joined the Sazman-i Jawanan-i Musulman (&quot;Organization of Muslim Youth&quot;) which was gaining influence because of its opposition to the Soviet influence in Afghanistan increasing through the PDPA elements in Daoud&#x27;s government. He was one of the foundational members of the organization. He may have also been influenced by the ideological teachings of Muslim Brotherhood member Sayyid Qutb. By his own account he became an Islamist when he heard of Qutb&#x27;s death in 1966, on radio, and also contradicts that he was a communist during his youth. Although some believe that Hekmatyar threw acid at multiple female students, others have attributed this claim to the Soviet KGB&#x27;s black propaganda. Hekmatyar&#x27;s radicalism put him in confrontation with elements in the Muslim Youth surrounding Ahmad Shah Massoud, also an engineering student at Kabul University. In 1975, trying to assassinate a rival for the second time in three years, Hekmatyar with Pakistani help tried to assassinate Massoud, then 22 years old, but failed. In 1975, the &quot;Islamic Society&quot; split between supporters of Massoud and Burhanuddin Rabbani, who led the Jamiat-e Islami, and elements surrounding Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who then founded the Hezb-i Islami. Akbarzadeh and Yasmeen describe Hekmatyar&#x27;s approach as &quot;radical&quot; and antagonistic as opposed to an &quot;inclusive&quot; and &quot;moderate&quot; strategy by Rabbani.

==Exile in Pakistan==
The arrival of Afghan opposition militants in Peshawar coincided with a period of diplomatic tension between Pakistan and Afghanistan, due to Daoud&#x27;s revival of the Pashtunistan issue. Under the patronage of Pakistani General Naseerullah Babar, then governor of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and with the blessing of Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, camps were set up to train Hekmatyar and other anti-Daoud Islamists. The Islamist movement had two main tendencies: the &quot;Jamiat-e islami&quot; (&quot;Islamic society&quot;) led by Burhanuddin Rabbani, that advocated a gradualist strategy to gain power, through infiltration of society and the state apparatus. Rabbani advocated for the &quot;building of a widely based movement that would create popular support&quot;. The other movement, called &quot;Hezb-i Islami&quot; (&quot;Islamic Party&quot;), was led by Hekmatyar, who favored a radical approach in the form of violent armed conflict. Pakistani support largely went to Hekmatyar&#x27;s group, who, in October 1975, undertook to instigate an uprising against the government. Without popular support, the rebellion ended in complete failure, and hundreds of militants were arrested.

Hekmatyar&#x27;s Hezb-e-Islami was formed as an elitist avant-garde based on a strictly disciplined Islamist ideology within a homogeneous organization that Olivier Roy described as &quot;Leninist&quot;, and employed the rhetoric of the Iranian Revolution. It had its operational base in the Nasir Bagh, Worsak and Shamshatoo refugee camps in Pakistan. In these camps, Hezb-i Islami formed a social and political network and operated everything from schools to prisons, with the support of the Pakistani government and their Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). From 1976 to 1977 Afghan President Daoud made overtures to Pakistan which led to reconciliation with Pakistani leader Bhutto. Bhutto&#x27;s support to Hekmatyar, however, continued and when Bhutto was removed from power in Pakistan by Zia-ul-Haq in 1977, Zia continued supporting Hekmatyar.

==Soviet war in Afghanistan==
During the Soviet–Afghan War, Hekmatyar received large amounts of aid from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United States. Hekmatyar also gained the support of the British MI6 and even met Margaret Thatcher in Downing Street. According to the ISI, their decision to allocate the highest percentage of covert aid to Hekmatyar was based on his record as an effective anti-Soviet military commander in Afghanistan. Others describe his position as the result of having &quot;almost no grassroots support and no military base inside Afghanistan&quot;, and thus being the much more &quot;dependent on Pakistani President Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s protection and financial largesse&quot; than other mujahideen factions. 

Author Peter Bergen states that &quot;by the most conservative estimates, $600 million&quot; in American aid through Pakistan &quot;went to the Hizb party ... Hekmatyar&#x27;s party had the dubious distinction of never winning a significant battle during the war, training a variety of militant Islamists from around the world, killing significant numbers of mujahideen from other parties, and taking a virulently anti-Western line. In addition to hundreds of millions of dollars of American aid, Hekmatyar also received the lion&#x27;s share of aid from the Saudis.&quot; Hekmatyar&#x27;s constant scheming against all of the mujahideen factions led Pakistani general and leader Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq to warn Hekmatyar that it was Pakistan that made him an Afghan leader and that Pakistan could and would destroy him if he resisted operational control by ISI.

==Heroin trafficking==
As the Soviet-Afghan War was coming to its end, Hekmatyar used the funds and weapons provided to him by the CIA and ISI to establish his organization as one of the leading heroin producers in the Middle East. Hekmatyar first became involved in the narcotics trade in the summer of 1988, as it became apparent that the Soviets were intending to withdraw. Initially becoming involved in trafficking opium, Hekmatyar&#x27;s was the first of the mujahideen groups to establish and operate heroin production factories in the region. Hekmatyar&#x27;s involvement in the production and distribution of illegal narcotics became a subject of diplomatic embarrassment for the United States Foreign Service. The CIA officer with responsibility for its operations in Afghanistan at the time, Charles Cogan, said &quot;Every situation has its fallout...There was fallout in terms of drugs, yes. But the main objective was accomplished.&quot;

==Warfare with other Afghan groups==

Hezb-e-Islami distinguished itself among the mujahideen by its practice of &quot;takfir&quot;, or pronouncing apostasy against other Muslims. On that basis it regularly attacked other mujahideen factions as well as the Soviet occupation. Hekmatyar&#x27;s conflict with Jamiat-e Islami and its commander Ahmad Shah Massoud was particularly contentious. Massoud was arrested in Pakistan for espionage in 1976 with Hekmatyar&#x27;s cooperation. Later Massoud and Hekmatyar agreed to stage a takeover operation in the Panjshir valley. Hekmatyar at the last minute refused to engage his part of the offensive, leaving Massoud open and vulnerable. Massoud&#x27;s forces barely escaped with their lives. In July 1989 Hezb-e-Islami commander Sayyed Jamal ambushed and killed 30 commanders of Massoud&#x27;s &quot;Shura-ye-Nazar&quot; at Farkhar in Takhar province. The attack was typical of Hekmatyar&#x27;s strategy of trying to cripple rival factions, and incurred widespread condemnation among the mujahideen.

Hekmatyar&#x27;s faction also attacked non-combatants such as British cameraman Andy Skrzypkowiak, who was killed in 1987 while carrying footage of Massoud&#x27;s successes to the West. Despite protests from British representatives, Hekmatyar did not punish the culprits, and instead rewarded them with gifts. The same year Médecins Sans Frontières reported that Hekmatyar&#x27;s guerrillas hijacked a 96-horse caravan bringing aid into northern Afghanistan, stealing a year&#x27;s supply of medicine and cash that was to be distributed to villagers. This would have allowed the villagers to buy food. French relief officials also asserted that Thierry Niquet, an aid coordinator bringing cash to Afghan villagers, was killed by one of Hekmatyar&#x27;s commanders in 1986. It is thought that two American journalists traveling with Hekmatyar in 1987, Lee Shapiro and Jim Lindelof, were killed not by the Soviets, as Hekmatyar&#x27;s men claimed, but during a firefight initiated by Hekmatyar&#x27;s forces against another mujahideen group.

Hekmatyar made an unlikely alliance with hardline communist and Minister of Defence Shahnawaz Tanai who launched a failed coup attempt in March 1990 against President Najibullah. Many senior members of his party resigned in protest of the coalition, and other Mujahideen groups ridiculed Hekmatyar for uniting with Khalqists to oust the Parcham government. In addition, there were frequent reports throughout the war of Hekmatyar&#x27;s commanders negotiating and dealing with pro-Communist local militias in northern Afghanistan.

Overall, Hekmatyar has been accused of spending &quot;more time fighting other Mujahideen than killing Soviets.&quot; Through the anti-Soviet war and beyond, he remained a controversial yet persistently influential figure whom &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as &quot;perhaps the most brutal of a generally brutal group&quot;.

==Post-DRA civil war==

A highly controversial commander, Hekmatyar has been dubbed the &quot;Butcher of Kabul&quot;, accused of being responsible for the destruction and civilian deaths Kabul experienced in the early 1990s.

According to the U.S. Special Envoy to Afghanistan in 1989–1992, Peter Tomsen, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was hired in 1990 by the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to conquer and rule Afghanistan in the benefit of Pakistani interests. The plan was delayed until 1992 due to US pressure to cancel that plan.

In April 1992, as the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan began to collapse, government officials joined the mujahideen, choosing different parties according to their ethnic and political affinities. For the most part, the members of the &quot;khalq&quot; faction of the PDPA, who were predominantly Pashtuns, joined with Hekmatyar. With their help, he began on 24 April to infiltrate troops into Kabul, and announced that he had seized the city, and that should any other leaders try to fly into Kabul, he would shoot their plane down. The new leader of the &quot;Islamic Interim Government of Afghanistan&quot;, Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, appointed Ahmad Shah Massoud as defense minister, and urged him to take action. This he did, taking the offensive on 25 April, and after two days heavy fighting, the Hezb-i Islami and its allies were expelled from Kabul. A peace agreement was signed with Massoud on 25 May 1992, which made Hekmatyar Prime Minister. However, the agreement fell apart when he was blamed for a rocket attack on President Mojaddedi&#x27;s plane. The following day, fighting resumed between Burhanuddin Rabbani&#x27;s and Ahmed Shah Massoud&#x27;s Jamiat, Abdul Rashid Dostum&#x27;s Jumbish forces and Hekmatyar&#x27;s Hezb-i Islami forces.

From 1992 to 1996, the warring factions destroyed most of Kabul and killed thousands, many of them civilians, during the Afghan civil war. All the different parties participated in the destruction, but Hekmatyar&#x27;s group was responsible for most of the damage, because of his practice of deliberately targeting civilian areas. Hekmatyar is thought to have bombarded Kabul in retaliation for what he considered its inhabitants&#x27; collaboration with the Soviets, and out of religious conviction. He once told a &quot;New York Times&quot; journalist that Afghanistan &quot;already had one and a half million martyrs. We are ready to offer as many to establish a true Islamic Republic.&quot; His attacks also had a political objective: to undermine the Rabbani government by proving that Rabbani and Massoud were unable to protect the population. In 1994 Hekmatyar would shift alliances, joining with Dostum as well as &quot;Hizb-e-Wahdat&quot;, a Hazara Shi&#x27;a party, to form the &quot;Shura-i Hamahangi&quot; (&quot;Council of coordination&quot;). Together they laid Siege on Kabul, unleashing massive barrages of artillery and rockets that led to the evacuation of U.N. personnel from Kabul, and caused several government members to abandon their posts. However the new alliance did not spell victory for Hekmatyar, and in June 1994, Massoud had driven Dostum&#x27;s troops from the capital.

==Relations with the Taliban==

The Pakistani military had supported Hekmatyar until then in the hope of installing a Pashtun-dominated government in Kabul, which would be friendly to their interests. By 1994, it had become clear that Hekmatyar would never achieve this, and that his extremism had antagonised most Pashtuns, so the Pakistanis began turning towards the predominantly Pashtun Taliban. After capturing Kandahar in November 1994, the Taliban made rapid progress towards Kabul, making inroads into Hezb-e Islami positions. They captured Wardak on 2 February 1995, and moved on to Maidan Shahr on 10 February and Mohammed Agha the next day. Very soon, Hekmatyar found himself caught between the advancing Taliban and the government forces, and the morale of his men collapsed. On 14 February, he was forced to abandon his headquarters at Charasiab, from where rockets were fired at Kabul, and flee in disorder to Surobi.

Nonetheless, in May 1996, Rabbani and Hekmatyar finally formed a power-sharing government in which Hekmatyar was made prime minister. Rabbani was anxious to enhance the legitimacy of his government by enlisting the support of Pashtun leaders. However, the Mahipar agreement did not bring any such benefits to him as Hekmatyar had little grassroots support, but did have many adverse effects: it caused outrage among Jamiat supporters, and among the population of Kabul, who had endured Hekmatyar&#x27;s attacks for the last four years. Moreover, the agreement was clearly not what the Pakistanis wanted, and convinced them of Hekmatyar&#x27;s weakness, and that they should shift their aid entirely over to the Taliban. Hekmatyar took office on 26 June, and immediately started issuing severe decrees on women&#x27;s dress that struck a sharp contrast with the relatively liberal policy that Massoud had followed until then. The Taliban responded to the agreement with a further spate of rocket attacks on the capital. The Rabbani/Hekmatyar regime lasted only a few months before the Taliban took control of Kabul in September 1996. Many of the Hezb-e Islami local commanders joined the Taliban, &quot;both out of ideological sympathy and for reason of tribal solidarity.&quot; Those that did not were expelled by the Taliban. In Pakistan, Hezb-e Islami training camps &quot;were taken over by the Taliban and handed over&quot; to Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) groups such as the Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP). Hekmatyar then fled to Massoud&#x27;s stronghold in Panjshir who, despite Hekmatyar&#x27;s history of animosity towards him, helped him flee to Iran in 1997, where he is said to have resided for almost six years. Isolated from Afghanistan he is reported to have &quot;lost ... his power base back home&quot; to defections or inactivity of former members. He was also distrusted by the Iranian Government, who found him too unpredictable, unreliable, and an unnecessary liability, considering its tense relations at the time with the Taliban and the Pakistani government. Despite his pleas, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards refused to establish a proxy through any of his organizations or assist him in any way. Allegedly, they even cut his phone lines and turned away anyone who wished to see him in his villa in North Tehran.

==Activities in the Islamic Republic==

After the 9/11 attacks in the United States Hekmatyar, who had allegedly &quot;worked closely&quot; with bin Laden in the early 1990s, declared his opposition to the US campaign in Afghanistan and criticized Pakistan for assisting the United States. After the U.S. entry into the anti-Taliban alliance and the fall of the Taliban, Hekmatyar rejected the U.N.-brokered accord of 5 December 2001 negotiated in Germany as a post-Taliban interim government for Afghanistan. As a result of pressure by the U.S. and the Karzai administration, on 10 February 2002 all the offices of Hezb-e-Islami were closed in Iran and Hekmatyar was expelled by his Iranian hosts.

The United States accused Hekmatyar of urging Taliban fighters to re-form and fight against Coalition troops in Afghanistan. He was also accused of offering bounties for those who kill U.S. troops. He has been labeled a war criminal by members of the U.S.-backed President Hamid Karzai&#x27;s government. ISAF identified Hekmatyar in 2002 as the number one security threat, ahead of the Taliban or al-Qaeda. He was also a suspect behind the 5 September 2002 assassination attempt on Karzai in Kandahar and a bomb the same day that killed more than a dozen people in Kabul. That same month, he released newsletters and tape messages calling for jihad against the United States. One of his commanders commented that there &quot;will be suicide attacks [...] against soldiers&quot;. On 25 December 2002, news broke that American spy organizations had discovered Hekmatyar attempting to join al-Qaeda. According to the news, he had said that he was available to aid them. However, in a video released by Hekmatyar 1 September 2003, he denied forming alliances with the Taliban or al-Qaeda, but praised attacks against U.S. and international forces.

On 10 February 2003, the Afghan government reported that Hekmatyar was planning an alliance with Taliban and al-Qaeda factions. His group was involved in an intense battle with the U.S. army near Spin Boldak. On February 19, 2003, the United States State Department and the United States Treasury Department jointly designated Hekmatyar a &quot;global terrorist.&quot; This designation meant that any assets Hekmatyar held in the U.S., or held through companies based in the U.S., would be frozen. The U.S. also requested the United Nations Committee on Terrorism to follow suit, and designate Hekmatyar an associate of Osama bin Laden. In October 2003, he declared a ceasefire with local commanders in Jalalabad, Kunar, Logar and Surobi, and stated that they should only fight foreigners. Hekmatyar was classified as a terrorist organization in Canada in 2005, and is one of two individuals on Canada&#x27;s list; his party Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin was added in 2006.

In May 2006, he released a video to Al Jazeera in which he accused Iran of backing the U.S. in the Afghan conflict and said he was ready to fight alongside Osama bin Laden and blamed the ongoing conflicts in Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan on U.S. interference. In an audiotape released the same month, he called for revolt against U.S. forces and Karzai&#x27;s &quot;puppet government&quot;, and directly threatened to kill Lt. General Karl Eikenberry. In September 2006, he was reported as captured, but the report was later retracted. In December 2006, a video was released in Pakistan, where Hekmatyar claimed &quot;the fate Soviet Union faced is awaiting America as well.&quot; In January 2007 CNN reported that Hekmatyar claimed &quot;that his fighters helped Osama bin Laden escape from the mountains of Tora Bora five years ago.&quot; BBC news reported a quote from a December 2006 interview broadcast on GEO TV, &quot;We helped them [bin Laden and Zawahiri] get out of the caves and led them to a safe place.&quot;

===2008 resurgence===
In May 2008, the Jamestown Foundation reported that after being &quot;sidelined from Afghan politics&quot; since the mid-1990s, Hekmatyar&#x27;s HIG group had &quot;recently reemerged as an aggressive militant group, claiming responsibility for many bloody attacks against Coalition forces at the time, primarily the International Security Assistance Force and the administration of President Hamid Karzai.&quot; The re-emergence of him as an &quot;experienced guerrilla strategist&quot; came at a propitious time for insurgency, following the killing of Taliban commander Mullah Dadullah, when some elements of the Taliban were becoming &quot;disorganized and frustrated.&quot; HIG claimed responsibility for and is thought to have at least assisted in a 27 April 2008 attempt on the life of President Karzai in Kabul that killed three Afghan citizens, including a member of parliament. Other attacks for which it was thought to be responsible included the 2 January 2008 shooting down in Laghman province of a helicopter containing foreign troops; the shooting and forcing down of a U.S. military helicopter in Sarubi district of Kabul on 22 January; and blowing up a Kabul police vehicle in March 2008, killing 10 soldiers.

In interviews he demanded &quot;all foreign forces to leave immediately unconditionally.&quot; Offers by President Hamid Karzai to open talks with &quot;opponents of the government&quot; and hints that they would be offered official posts &quot;such as deputy minister or head of department&quot;, were thought to be directed at Hekmatyar. It was reported in 2008 that Hekmatyar lived in an unknown location in southeastern Afghanistan, close to the Pakistani border. In 2008, he denied any links with the Taliban or al-Qaeda and was even considered for prime minister. At the time, Hekmatyar was believed to shuttle between hideouts in Pakistan&#x27;s mountainous tribal areas and northeast Afghanistan.

In January 2010, he was still considered one of the three main leaders of the Afghan insurgency. By then, he held out the possibility of negotiations with President Karzai and outlined a roadmap for political reconciliation. This contrasted with the views of Taliban leader Mullah Omar and allied insurgent chief Sirajuddin Haqqani, who refused any talks with Kabul as long as foreign troops remained in the country, Hekmatyar appeared less reluctant.

On 10 February 2014, Hekmatyar&#x27;s HIG group executed an attack which killed two US civilians, Paul Goins and Michael Hughes, and wounded two other Americans and seven Afghan nationals. HIG was also responsible for a 16 May 2013 suicide VBIED attack in Kabul, which destroyed a US armored SUV and killed two US soldiers, four US civilian contractors, eight Afghans—including two children—and wounded at least 37 others. The attack marked the deadliest incident against US personnel in Kabul in 2013.

===2016 peace deal and pardon===
On 22 September 2016, Hekmatyar was pardoned by the Afghan government as part of a peace deal between Hezb-i-Islami and the government. The deal also allowed for the release of Hezb-i-Islami prisoners and the return of Hekmatyar to public life. The deal led a group of young activists to organise a protest against the pardoning less than a mile away from the signing ceremony. Human Rights Watch called the deal &quot;an affront to victims of grave abuses&quot;. Hezb-i-Islami agreed to cease hostilities, cut ties to extremist groups and respect the Afghan Constitution in exchange for government recognition of the group and support for the removal of United Nations and American sanctions against Hekmatyar, who was also promised an honorary post in the government.

The agreement was formalised on 29 September 2016 with both Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Hekmatyar, who appeared via a video link in the presidential palace, signing the agreement. UN sanctions on him were formally lifted on 3 February 2017. On 4 May 2017, he returned to Kabul along with his fighters to meet President Ghani after spending two decades in hiding.

He has then called on the Taliban to end their insurgency and lay down arms. Hekmatyar ran in the 2019 Afghan presidential election and finished a distant third.

==During and after U.S. withdrawal==
Hekmatyar and his organization are reported to have joined the Council of Reconciliation formed by the Taliban. After the Taliban&#x27;s return to power he voiced in September 2021 his support for the Taliban even if he and his party will not be included in governance. In October 2022, Hekmatyar told a sermon in Kabul that the talks of Bonn (2001) and Doha (2019–2020) failed to bring peace to Afghanistan because of the influence of &quot;foreigners&quot;. He proposed intra-Afghan talks to form an inclusive government to replace the current interim Taliban government.

In 2024, the Taliban cracked down on Hekmatyar, forcing him out of his government residence and shutting down his weekly sermons and the TV station that aired them.

==Relatives==
Some of Hekmatyar&#x27;s relatives have served or are suspected of serving as his deputies.

==Books==
Hekmatyar has been described as a &quot;prolific writer&quot; who, &quot;despite rarely ceasing to fight, has authored more than 60 (reportedly 79) books on linguistics, Pashto grammar, comparative religion and political analysis.&quot; His publications include:

*&quot;Buḥrān-i mushkīlāt-i rāhhā-yi ḥal&quot;, 2000, 194 p. 
*&quot;Shiʻr va ʻirfān dar miḥak-i Qurʼān va shaqāyiq-i adabī&quot;, 2001, 104 p.

*&quot;Da Qurʼān palwashe&quot;, 2006–2011, 8 volumes.

<text>Jacopo Peri (20 August 156112 August 1633) was an Italian composer, singer and instrumentalist of the late Renaissance and early Baroque periods. He wrote what is considered the first opera, the mostly lost &quot;Dafne&quot; (), and also the earliest extant opera, &quot;Euridice&quot; (1600). 

He is sometimes known by the byname lo Zazzerino ().

==Life and career==
Jacopo di Antonio di Franceso Peri was born in either Rome or Florence to a middle-class family. Peri himself claimed to be from Rome, but considering the pro-Roman sentiments of the reigning Fernando de&#x27;Medici, it was a disadvantage to be known as a Florentine, which may have motivated Peri to lie about his true birthplace. Nonetheless, he was employed to sing at the Servite monastery of SS. Annunziati in the city of Florence. He likely received an education from the monastery school as well. Due to its size and favour with the Medici court, who attended mass each week, SS. Annunziati was a pipeline for many musical students into musical careers. Because of his talent and education, Peri was able to study in Florence with Cristofano Malvezzi, and went on to work in a number of churches there, both as an organist and as a singer. He subsequently began to work in the Medici court around September 1588, first as a tenor singer and keyboard player, and later as a composer. His earliest works were incidental music for plays, &quot;intermedi&quot; and madrigals.

In the 1590s, Peri became associated with Jacopo Corsi, the leading patron of music in Florence. They believed contemporary art was inferior to classical Greek and Roman works, and decided to attempt to recreate Greek tragedy, as they understood it. Their work added to that of the Florentine Camerata of the previous decade, which produced the first experiments in monody, the solo song style over continuo bass which eventually developed into recitative and aria. Peri and Corsi brought in the poet Ottavio Rinuccini to write a text, and the result, &quot;Dafne&quot;, is seen as the first work in a new form, opera.

Rinuccini and Peri next collaborated on &quot;Euridice&quot;. This was first performed on 6 October 1600 at the Palazzo Pitti for the wedding of Princess Marie de&#x27; Medici and Henry IV. Unlike &quot;Dafne&quot;, it has survived to the present day (though it is hardly ever staged, and then only as a historical curio). The work made use of recitatives, a new development which went between the arias and choruses and served to move the action along.

Peri produced a number of other operas, often in collaboration with other composers (such as &quot;La Flora&quot; with Marco da Gagliano), and also wrote a number of other pieces for various court entertainments. Few of his pieces are still performed today, and even by the time of his death, his operatic style was looking rather old-fashioned when compared to the work of relatively younger reformist composers such as Claudio Monteverdi. Peri&#x27;s influence on those later composers, however, was large.

<text>Charles Patrick Ryan O&#x27;Neal (April 20, 1941 – December 8, 2023) was an American actor. Born in Los Angeles, he trained as an amateur boxer before beginning a career in acting in 1960.

In 1964, he landed the role of Rodney Harrington on the ABC nighttime soap opera &quot;Peyton Place&quot;. It was an instant hit and boosted O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s career. He later found success in films, most notably in the romantic drama &quot;Love Story&quot; (1970), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama; Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot; (1972); &quot;Paper Moon&quot; (1973), which earned him a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy; Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; (1975), in which he portrayed the titular character; Richard Attenborough&#x27;s &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977); and Walter Hill&#x27;s &quot;The Driver&quot; (1978). 

From 2005 to 2017, he had a recurring role in the Fox television series &quot;Bones&quot; as Max, the father of the show&#x27;s eponymous protagonist.

==Early life and education==
O&#x27;Neal was born in Los Angeles, on April 20, 1941, the elder son of actress Patricia ( O&#x27;Callaghan) and novelist/screenwriter Charles O&#x27;Neal. His father was of Irish and English descent, while his mother was of paternal Irish and maternal Jewish ancestry. His only sibling, younger brother, Kevin O&#x27;Neal (19452023), was also an actor as well as a screenwriter.

O&#x27;Neal attended University High School in Los Angeles, and trained there to become a Golden Gloves boxer. During the late 1950s, his father had a job writing on a television series called &quot;Citizen Soldier&quot;, and moved the family to Munich, where O&#x27;Neal attended Munich American High School.

== Career ==
=== 1960–1969: Television roles ===
In Germany, O&#x27;Neal was struggling at school, so his mother pulled some favors and got him a job as a stand-in on a show being shot in the area, &quot;Tales of the Vikings&quot;. O&#x27;Neal worked on it as an extra and stuntman and became interested in acting. O&#x27;Neal returned to the U.S. and tried to make it as an actor. He made his first television appearance guest starring on &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot; episode &quot;The Hunger Strike&quot; in 1960. He followed this with guest slots on &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot;, &quot;Laramie&quot;, &quot;Two Faces West&quot;, &quot;Westinghouse Playhouse&quot; (several episodes), &quot;Bachelor Father&quot;, &quot;My Three Sons&quot;, &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; episode &quot;Wally Goes Steady&quot; in 1961, and &quot;The Virginian&quot;. He was under contract to Universal but they let it lapse. From 1962 to 1963, O&#x27;Neal was a regular on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Empire&quot;, a modern-day western, where he played &quot;Tal Garrett&quot; in support of Richard Egan. It ran for 33 episodes. In 1963, the series was revived as &quot;Redigo&quot;, but O&#x27;Neal turned down the chance to reprise his role. When the series ended, O&#x27;Neal went back to guest-starring on shows such as &quot;Perry Mason&quot; and &quot;Wagon Train&quot;.

In 1964 he was cast as Rodney Harrington in the prime time serial drama &quot;Peyton Place&quot;. O&#x27;Neal said he got the role because &quot;the studio was looking for a young Doug McClure&quot;. The series was a big success, making national names of its cast including O&#x27;Neal. Several were offered movie roles, including Mia Farrow, &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1968), and Barbara Parkins, &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; (1967), and O&#x27;Neal was keen to do films. During the series&#x27; run O&#x27;Neal appeared in a pilot for a proposed series, &quot;European Eye&quot; (1968). He was also signed to ABC for a recording contract. O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s first lead in a feature came with &quot;The Big Bounce&quot; (1969), based on an Elmore Leonard novel. In 1969, he appeared in a TV version of &quot;Under the Yum Yum Tree&quot; (1963).

=== 1970–1980: Film stardom ===
In 1970, O&#x27;Neal played an Olympic athlete in &quot;The Games&quot;. The film had been co-written by Erich Segal, who recommended O&#x27;Neal for the lead in the romantic drama &quot;Love Story&quot; (1970), based on Segal&#x27;s novel and script. A number of actors had turned down the role including Beau Bridges and Jon Voight before it was offered to O&#x27;Neal. His fee was $25,000; he said he had an offer that paid five times as much to appear in a Jerry Lewis film, but O&#x27;Neal knew that &quot;Love Story&quot; was the better prospect and selected that instead. Paramount Pictures studio head, Robert Evans, who was married to the film&#x27;s female lead, Ali MacGraw, said they tested 14 other actors but no one compared to O&#x27;Neal; he said the part was &quot;a Cary Grant role – a handsome leading man with lots of emotion.&quot; &quot;I hope the young people like it&quot;, O&#x27;Neal said before the film came out. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to go back to TV. I don&#x27;t want to go back to those NAB conventions.&quot; &quot;Love Story&quot; turned out to be a box office phenomenon, making O&#x27;Neal a star and earning him nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, although O&#x27;Neal was bitter that he was never given a percentage of the profits, unlike co-star Ali MacGraw.
In between the film&#x27;s production and release, O&#x27;Neal appeared in a TV movie written by Eric Ambler, &quot;Love Hate Love&quot; (1971), which received good ratings. He also made a Western, &quot;Wild Rovers&quot; (1971) with William Holden for director Blake Edwards. &quot;Wild Rovers&quot;, badly cut by MGM, was considerably less popular than &quot;Love Story&quot;. O&#x27;Neal was going to make another film for MGM, &quot;Deadly Honeymoon&quot; (1974), from a novel by Lawrence Block. However, O&#x27;Neal pulled out. Peter Bogdanovich later said MGM head Jim Aubrey was &quot;cruel&quot; to O&#x27;Neal.

Director Nic Roeg wanted O&#x27;Neal to appear opposite Julie Christie in an adaptation of &quot;Out of Africa&quot; that was never made. Instead, O&#x27;Neal starred in the screwball comedy &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot; (1972) for Bogdanovich and opposite Barbra Streisand. The film was the third-highest-grossing film of 1972 and led to his receiving an offer to star in a movie for Stanley Kubrick, &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;. While that film was in pre-production, O&#x27;Neal played a jewel thief in &quot;The Thief Who Came to Dinner&quot; (1972) opposite Jacqueline Bisset and Warren Oates. Then he was reunited with Bogdanovich for &quot;Paper Moon&quot; (1973) in which he starred opposite his daughter Tatum O&#x27;Neal. His performance in the film earned him a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, and he was voted by exhibitors as the second-most-popular star of 1973 in the United States, behind Clint Eastwood.

O&#x27;Neal spent over a year making &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; (1975) for Kubrick. The resulting film, despite being nominated for seven Academy Awards, was considered a commercial disappointment and had a mixed critical reception; it won O&#x27;Neal a Harvard Lampoon Award for the Worst Actor of 1975. Reflecting in 1985, O&#x27;Neal said the film was &quot;all right but he [Kubrick] completely changed the picture during the year he spent editing it&quot;. The film&#x27;s reputation has risen in recent years but O&#x27;Neal said his career never recovered from the film&#x27;s reception.

O&#x27;Neal had been originally meant to star in Bogdanovich&#x27;s flop musical &quot;At Long Last Love&quot; but was replaced by Burt Reynolds. However he made the screwball comedy &quot;Nickelodeon&quot; (1976) with Reynolds, Bogdanovich, and Tatum O&#x27;Neal, for a fee of $750,000. The film flopped at the box office. O&#x27;Neal followed this with a small role in the all-star war film &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977), playing General James Gavin. O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s performance as a hardened general was much criticised, although O&#x27;Neal was only a year older than Gavin at the time of the events in the film. &quot;Can I help it if I photograph like I&#x27;m 16 and they gave me a helmet that was too big for my head?&quot; he later said. &quot;At least I did my own parachute jump.&quot; The film was the 6th most popular movie of 1977.

O&#x27;Neal initially turned down a reported $3 million to star in &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Story&quot; (1978), a sequel to &quot;Love Story&quot;. Instead he appeared in the car-chase film &quot;The Driver&quot; (1978), directed by Walter Hill, who had written &quot;The Thief Who Came to Dinner&quot;. This was a box office disappointment in the U.S. but, like &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;, did better overseas. Hill later said he &quot;was so pleased with Ryan in the movie and I was very disappointed that people didn&#x27;t particularly give him any credit for what he did. To me, he&#x27;s the best he&#x27;s ever been. I cannot imagine another actor.&quot; O&#x27;Neal was meant to follow this with &quot;The Champ&quot; (1979), directed by Franco Zeffirelli, but decided to pull out after Zeffirelli refused to cast O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s son Griffin opposite him. Instead he agreed to make &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Story&quot; after all once the script was rewritten. However the film was a flop at the box office.

&quot;What I have to do now, seriously, is win a few hearts as an actor,&quot; he said in 1978. &quot;The way Cary Grant did. I know I&#x27;ve got a lot of winning to do. But I&#x27;m young enough. I&#x27;ll get there...&quot; Around this time, O&#x27;Neal was meant to star in &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;, from a Lawrence Kasdan script, opposite Diana Ross for director John Boorman. However the film fell over when Ross pulled out, and it would not be made until 1992, with Kevin Costner in O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s old role. There was some talk he would appear in a film from Michelangelo Antonioni, &quot;Suffer or Die&quot;, but this did not happen.

O&#x27;Neal instead played a boxer in a comedy, &quot;The Main Event&quot;, reuniting him with Streisand. He received a fee of $1 million plus a percentage of the profits. &quot;The Main Event&quot; was a sizeable hit at the box office. Also in 1979, he produced a documentary, &quot;The Contender&quot;, about a boxer he managed.

A 1980 profile of O&#x27;Neal described him:

=== 1981–1987: Career fluctuations ===
O&#x27;Neal was looking next to act in the lead role in the film version of &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; to be directed by Arthur Hiller, but the book ended up being adapted as a miniseries. Instead O&#x27;Neal made a British-financed thriller, &quot;Green Ice&quot; (1981), for the most money he had ever received up front. The movie had a troublesome production (the original director quit during filming) and flopped at the box office. He had a cameo in &quot;Circle of Two&quot;, a film his daughter made with Richard Burton. O&#x27;Neal said Burton told him during filming he was &quot;five years away from winning acceptance as a serious actor&quot; ... [and that] .. &quot;On the other hand, my agent, Sue Mengers says I&#x27;m right on the threshold. Split the difference, that&#x27;s two and a half years. One good picture, that&#x27;s all I need...&quot;

However, in the early 1980s he focused on comedies. He received $2 million for the lead in &quot;So Fine&quot;. This was followed by &quot;Partners&quot; (1982), a farce written by Francis Veber in which O&#x27;Neal played a straight cop who goes undercover as one half of a gay couple. He then played a film director loosely based on Peter Bogdanovich in &quot;Irreconcilable Differences&quot; (1984); he received no upfront fee but got a percentage of the profits. It was a minor box office success. A 1984 profile called him &quot;the Billy Martin of Hollywood, whether it&#x27;s his love affair with Farrah Fawcett... his precocious actor daughter Tatum or fisticuffs with his son Griffin. He just can&#x27;t seem to stay out of the news.&quot; O&#x27;Neal said he felt more like Rocky Marciano, &quot;wondering why guys are always picking fights with me. If I&#x27;m in a good picture, they&#x27;ll like me. If I&#x27;m not they&#x27;ll hate me. Hey I&#x27;m mad too when I don&#x27;t make good pictures.&quot;

O&#x27;Neal said too many of the roles he had played were &quot;off the beaten path for me&quot;. In particular he regretted doing &quot;The Thief Who Came to Dinner&quot;, &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;, &quot;The Driver&quot;, &quot;So Fine&quot;, &quot;Partners&quot;, and &quot;Green Ice&quot;. He blamed this in part on having to pay alimony and child support. He also said agent Sue Mengers encouraged him to constantly work. &quot;If I could get a good director to choose me for a picture, I was okay&quot;, he said. &quot;But they stopped calling me in the mid-70s... I made a whole bunch of pictures that didn&#x27;t make any money and people lost interest in me... Directors take me reluctantly. I feel I&#x27;m lucky to be here in the first place and they know it too. I&#x27;m a glamour boy, a Hollywood product. I have a TV background and they can point to the silly movies I&#x27;ve made.&quot; In 1985, O&#x27;Neal tried something different, playing an &quot;L.A. Herald Examiner&quot; sportswriter and sports columnist who also gambles far too much in &quot;Fever Pitch&quot; (1985), the final movie for director Richard Brooks. Even less conventional was &quot;Tough Guys Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; (1987) for director Norman Mailer. Both movies flopped at the box office, and received poor reviews.

=== 1988–2017: Later roles ===
O&#x27;Neal had a supporting part in a Liza Minnelli TV special &quot;Sam Found Out: A Triple Play&quot; (1988), and also supported in the romantic comedy &quot;Chances Are&quot; (1989). He returned to TV opposite his then-partner Farrah Fawcett in &quot;Small Sacrifices&quot; (1989). He and Fawcett made a short-lived CBS series, &quot;Good Sports&quot; (1991), which lasted 15 episodes. O&#x27;Neal co starred with Katharine Hepburn in the TV movie &quot;The Man Upstairs&quot; (1992) and had a cameo in Fawcett&#x27;s &quot;Man of the House&quot; (1995). He had a good role in &quot;Faithful&quot; (1996) with Cher. It was directed by Paul Mazursky who later said of O&#x27;Neal:

He&#x27;s sweet as sugar, and he&#x27;s volatile. He&#x27;s got some of that Irish stuff in him, and he can blow up a bit. One day he was doing a scene, and I said, &quot;Bring it down a little bit,&quot; and Ryan said, &quot;I quit! You can&#x27;t say &#x27;Bring it down&#x27; to me that loud!&quot; I said, &quot;If you quit, I&#x27;m going to break your nose.&quot; He started to cry. He&#x27;s sort of a big baby at times, but he&#x27;s a good guy, and he&#x27;s very talented. He&#x27;s had a strange career, but he was a monster star.

O&#x27;Neal had a supporting role in &quot;Hacks&quot; (1997) and the lead in &quot;An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn&quot; (1998). He had the third lead in &quot;Zero Effect&quot; (1999) and was top billed in &quot;The List&quot; (2000). He had a semi-recurring role in &quot;Bull&quot; (2001) and supporting parts in &quot;Epoch&quot; (2001), &quot;People I Know&quot; (2002) with Al Pacino, &quot;Gentleman B.&quot; (2002), and &quot;Malibu&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; (2003). O&#x27;Neal had a regular part on the TV series &quot;Miss Match&quot; (2003) with Alicia Silverstone, which ran for 18 episodes. Around this time he guest starred on shows such as &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; and &quot;90210&quot;. In 2009 he said that he &quot;made a tremendous amount of money on real estate&quot;.

O&#x27;Neal was a recurring character on Fox&#x27;s &quot;Bones&quot; from seasons 2 to 12, with his final episode airing in February 2017. In 2011, Ryan and Tatum attempted to restore their broken father/daughter relationship after 25 years. Their reunion and reconciliation process was captured in the Oprah Winfrey Network series &quot;Ryan and Tatum: The O&#x27;Neals&quot;, which O&#x27;Neal produced. It ran only nine episodes, and he later said that it left their relationship in a worse state than before. O&#x27;Neal could be seen in &quot;Slumber Party Slaughter&quot; (2012) and &quot;Knight of Cups&quot; (2015) in a small role.

In 2016, O&#x27;Neal reunited with &quot;Love Story&quot; co-star Ali MacGraw in a staging of A. R. Gurney&#x27;s play &quot;Love Letters&quot;. In February 2021, O&#x27;Neal and MacGraw were honored with stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, nearly 50 years after the release of &quot;Love Story&quot;.

== Personal life ==
=== Relationships ===
O&#x27;Neal married his first wife, actress Joanna Moore, in 1963. They had two children before separating in 1966. Moore eventually lost custody of their children to O&#x27;Neal as a result of her alcoholism and drug addiction.

His second marriage was to actress and his &quot;Peyton Place&quot; co-star Leigh Taylor-Young, with whom he had a son. They remained friends after divorcing in 1973. &quot;I could speak to parts of Ryan like temper and volatility and reactivity, but I deeply know his goodness&quot;, Taylor-Young said.

O&#x27;Neal was in a relationship with actress Farrah Fawcett from 1979 to 1997. The relationship was tumultuous due to his infidelity and volatile behavior. O&#x27;Neal and Fawcett reunited in 2001 and were together until her death in 2009.

&quot;I got married at 21, and I was not a real mature 21,&quot; said O&#x27;Neal. &quot;My first child was born when I was 22. I was a man&#x27;s man; I didn&#x27;t discover women until I was married, and then it was too late.&quot; He had romances with Ursula Andress, Bianca Jagger, Anouk Aimée, Jacqueline Bisset, Barbra Streisand, Joan Collins, Diana Ross, and Anjelica Huston. According to his daughter Tatum O&#x27;Neal, he also had an affair with Melanie Griffith. In her 2014 memoir, Anjelica Huston claimed that O&#x27;Neal physically abused her.

=== Children ===
O&#x27;Neal had four children: Tatum O&#x27;Neal and Griffin O&#x27;Neal with Moore, Patrick O&#x27;Neal with Taylor-Young, and Redmond James Fawcett O&#x27;Neal with Fawcett. 

For several years, O&#x27;Neal was estranged from his three elder children. &quot;I&#x27;m a hopeless father. I don&#x27;t know why. I don&#x27;t think I was supposed to be a father. Just look around at my work—they&#x27;re either in jail or they should be,&quot; he told &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. In her autobiography, &quot;A Paper Life&quot;, Tatum wrote that she had suffered physical and emotional abuse as a result of her father&#x27;s drug abuse. Griffin O&#x27;Neal also suggested their family&#x27;s problems stemmed from Ryan. &quot;My father gave me cocaine when I was 11 and insisted I take it,&quot; he said. Griffin added, &quot;He was a very abusive, narcissistic psychopath. He gets so mad he can&#x27;t control anything he&#x27;s doing.&quot;

In 2007, O&#x27;Neal was arrested for shooting at Griffin, which he claimed was in self-defense; the charges were dropped. O&#x27;Neal refused to allow Griffin to attend Fawcett&#x27;s funeral in 2009. He hit on Tatum at Fawcett&#x27;s funeral, not recognizing her as his daughter.

In 2011, Tatum published a book with her father and appeared with him on the TV show &quot;Ryan and Tatum: the O&#x27;Neals&quot;. In August of that year, O&#x27;Neal, Tatum, and Patrick attended Redmond&#x27;s court appearance on firearms and drug charges. 

Redmond has struggled with drug addiction for most of his adult life. In 2008, O&#x27;Neal and Redmond were arrested for drug possession in their Malibu home. In 2015, Redmond&#x27;s probation was revoked and he was sentenced to three years in the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. In 2018, Redmond was arrested and charged with attempted murder, robbery, assault and drug possession after he allegedly tried to rob a convenience store in Santa Monica. In an interview from jail he blamed his struggles on his parents.

==Illness and death==
In 2001, O&#x27;Neal was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). After struggling with leukemia, O&#x27;Neal was frequently seen at Fawcett&#x27;s side when she was battling cancer. He told &quot;People&quot; magazine, &quot;It&#x27;s a love story. I just don&#x27;t know how to play this one. I won&#x27;t know this world without her. Cancer is an insidious enemy.&quot; In April 2012, O&#x27;Neal stated he had been diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer. He later stated it was stage 2.

O&#x27;Neal died at Saint John&#x27;s Health Center in Santa Monica, California, on December 8, 2023, at the age of 82. His cause of death was congestive heart failure, with cardiomyopathy listed as a contributing factor. O&#x27;Neal was interred next to Fawcett at Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park and Mortuary.

<doc id="161921" wikidata="Q6959045" url="?curid=161921" title="Predicative verb">
<text>A predicative verb is a verb that behaves as a grammatical adjective; that is, it predicates (qualifies or informs about the properties of its argument). It is a special kind of stative verb.

Many languages do not use the present forms of the verb &quot;to be&quot; to separate an adjective from its noun: instead, these forms of the verb &quot;to be&quot; are understood as part of the adjective. Egyptian uses this structure: &quot;my mouth is red&quot; is written as &quot;red my mouth&quot; (/dSr=f r=i/). Other languages to use this structure include the Northwest Caucasian languages, the Thai language, Indonesian, the East Slavic languages, the Semitic languages, some Nilotic languages and the Athabaskan languages. Many adjectives in Chinese and Japanese also behave like this.

In the Akkadian languages, the &quot;predicative&quot; (also called the &quot;permansive&quot; or &quot;stative&quot;) is a set of pronominal inflections used to convert noun stems into effective sentences, so that the form &quot;šarrāku&quot; is a single word more or less equivalent to either of the sentences &quot;šarrum anāku&quot; &quot;I am king&quot; or &quot;šarratum anāku&quot; &quot;I am queen&quot;.

<text>Glottal consonants are consonants using the glottis as their primary articulation. Many phoneticians consider them, or at least the glottal fricative, to be transitional states of the glottis without a point of articulation as other consonants have, while some do not consider them to be consonants at all. However, glottal consonants behave as typical consonants in many languages. For example, in Literary Arabic, most words are formed from a root &quot;C-C-C&quot; consisting of three consonants, which are inserted into templates such as or . The glottal consonants and can occupy any of the three root consonant slots, just like &quot;normal&quot; consonants such as or .

The glottal consonants in the International Phonetic Alphabet are as follows:

==Characteristics==
In many languages, the &quot;fricatives&quot; are not true fricatives. This is a historical usage of the word. They instead represent transitional states of the glottis (phonation) without a specific place of articulation, and may behave as approximants. is a voiceless transition. is a breathy-voiced transition, and could be transcribed as . Lamé is one of very few languages that contrasts voiceless and voiced glottal fricatives.

The glottal stop occurs in many languages. Often all vocalic onsets are preceded by a glottal stop, for example in German (in careful pronunciation; often omitted in practice). The Hawaiian language writes the glottal stop as the ‘okina ‘, which resembles a single open quotation mark. Some alphabets use diacritics for the glottal stop, such as hamza in the Arabic alphabet; in many languages of Mesoamerica, the Latin letter is used for glottal stop, in Maltese, the letter is used, and in many indigenous languages of the Caucasus, the letter commonly referred to as heng is used.

Because the glottis is necessarily closed for the glottal stop, it cannot be voiced. So-called voiced glottal stops are not full stops, but rather creaky voiced glottal approximants that may be transcribed . They occur as the intervocalic allophone of glottal stop in many languages. Gimi contrasts and , corresponding to and in related languages.

<doc id="161924" wikidata="Q854708" url="?curid=161924" title="Kotch">
<text>Kotch is a 1971 American comedy-drama film directed by Jack Lemmon and starring Walter Matthau, Deborah Winters, Felicia Farr (Lemmon&#x27;s wife), Charles Aidman and Ellen Geer.

Adapted by John Paxton from Katharine Topkins&#x27;s 1965 novel, the film tells the story of an elderly man who leaves his family rather than go to a nursing home, and strikes up a friendship with a pregnant teenage girl. It is Lemmon&#x27;s only film behind the camera, and partnered him with friend and frequent co-star Matthau. It was also co-produced by Lemmon&#x27;s company, Jalem Productions, in co-production with Paxton and Carter&#x27;s company Brier Productions.

==Plot==
In Los Angeles, young mother Wilma Kotcher hires Erica &quot;Ricky&quot; Herzenstiel to babysit her infant son Duncan. Wilma&#x27;s father-in-law, nicknamed &quot;Kotch&quot;, interrupts the arrangement with an unrelated and confusing story about another Herzenstiel. Erica takes Duncan to the park, but when her boyfriend arrives, she leaves Kotch behind. At the park, Kotch saves a young girl from drowning and, in an attempt to be friendly, gives her a pat on the back. The girl&#x27;s mother and a Parks Department representative are offended, and Kotch&#x27;s son Gerald is also displeased.

While Gerald and Wilma go out, Kotch discovers Erica and her boyfriend having sex in the living room. He quietly leaves and later discusses his frustrations with Gerald, questioning why he and Wilma do not trust him with Duncan. Kotch&#x27;s complaints about Wilma taking tranquilizers lead her to insist that Gerald remove Kotch from their household. Gerald subsequently takes Kotch to an upscale retirement community, but Kotch is put off by the tests that he must take.

Kotch finds Erica at her high school, upset over her unplanned pregnancy and her decision to leave school for a job in San Bernardino. Despite her initial refusal, Erica accepts a small payment from Kotch, promising to repay it. Kotch subsequently travels across the country by bus, staying in motels and sending postcards to Duncan.

Returning unannounced to the Kotcher home, Kotch learns through a Halloween party letter that Erica cannot repay her debt due to serious issues. Acting as a private investigator, Kotch discovers that Erica was dismissed from her job as a hair stylist for being unlicensed and is now looking for work in Palm Springs. Kotch finds Erica, takes her on a tram ride, and offers her a job as his housekeeper. After spending autumn alone, Erica returns on Christmas Eve, ready to accept his offer.

In Palm Springs, Erica decorates and knits while Kotch buys an old car. Erica leaves a note saying that she is at a hospital, but Kotch finds out that she is attending a class on midwifery. When Erica decides to give up her baby for adoption, Kotch hires a nurse and tries to find a new family for Erica. However, Erica begins to have contractions and needs to be rushed to the hospital. Kotch ends up delivering the baby at a gas station.

Erica decides to keep her baby, and returns to Los Angeles. Gerald and Wilma offer a place to Kotch in their home, but he declines. Kotch instead plans to buy the Palm Springs house and work at a local hardware store. While cleaning up, Kotch finds a note indicating that he would have made a great-grandfather under better circumstances. He leaves with Pablo, ready for new adventures.

<doc id="161930" wikidata="Q6619138" url="?curid=161930" title="List of Australia-New Guinea species extinct in the Holocene">
<text>This is a list of Australia-New Guinea species extinct in the Holocene that covers extinctions from the Holocene epoch, a geologic epoch that began about 11,650 years before present (about 9700 BCE) and continues to the present day.

The Australian continent is also called Australia-New Guinea or Sahul to avoid confusion with the country of Australia. The continent includes mainland Australia, Tasmania, the island of New Guinea, the Aru Islands, and other nearby islands. Australia-New Guinea is divided between three countries: Australia (mainland Australia and Tasmania), Papua New Guinea (eastern New Guinea), and Indonesia (Western New Guinea and the Aru Islands). Extinct animals from the rest of Indonesia are covered in List of Asian animals extinct in the Holocene. Species from the outlying islands of the country of Australia and the Bismarck Archipelago of Papua New Guinea are included below. The Solomon Islands archipelago, split between Papua New Guinea (Autonomous Region of Bougainville) and the country of Solomon Islands, is covered in List of Oceanian species extinct in the Holocene. 

The fauna of Australia-New Guinea is very unique. Marsupials and monotremes also existed on other continents, but only in Australia-New Guinea did they come to dominate. Aside from marine mammals, only two orders of placental mammals are native to Australia-New Guinea: rodents and bats. Dingoes and New Guinea singing dogs are considered feral dogs (&quot;Canis familiaris&quot;) introduced by humans. The Christmas Island shrew is related to Asian shrews; no members of the order Eulipotyphla are native to Australia-New Guinea proper. 

New Zealand species extinct in the Holocene are listed separately. The fauna of New Zealand is distinct from Australia-New Guinea. Birds, including numerous flightless birds, are the most important part of New Zealand&#x27;s vertebrate fauna. Bats are New Zealand&#x27;s only native land mammals.

Numerous species have disappeared from Australia-New Guinea as part of the ongoing Holocene extinction, driven by human activity. Most Australian megafauna disappeared in the Late Pleistocene, considerably earlier than in other continental landmasses. As a result, Australian Holocene extinctions generally are of modest size. Most extinctions occurred after the European settlement of Australia, which began with the First Fleet in 1788 CE. However, the thylacine, Tasmanian devil, and Tasmanian nativehen were extirpated from mainland Australia thousands of years before European settlement, although they survived in Tasmania. The Norfolk swamphen and several New Guinea mammals also disappeared before European colonisation.

=== Plants listed as extinct by the federal government ===
Plants and animals are listed as extinct and the federal level under the auspices of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The Act lists all plants considered to have become extinct since the commencement of European settlement of Australia in 1788. There are 37 species currently listed as extinct under the Act.

Of note, the species &quot;Pimelea spinescens&quot; subsp. &quot;pubiflora&quot; was presumed extinct after 1901, but a population was discovered in 2005. The orchid &quot;Diuris bracteata&quot; was also considered extinct after its first collection in 1899, but it was thought to have been rediscovered in 1998. The later collections are now considered to be &quot;Diuris platichila&quot;. The spiny everlasting (&quot;Acanthocladium dockeri&quot;) was reclassified as critically endangered in 2006 after it was rediscovered in 1999. Bennett&#x27;s Seaweed, declared extinct under the EPBC Act in 1999; was the first protist listed as extinct by the IUCN in 2004.

<text>Merrily We Roll Along is a play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. It concerns a man who has lost the idealistic values of his youth. Its innovative structure presents the story in reverse order, with the character regressing from a mournful adult to a young man whose future is filled with promise.

The 1934 Broadway production received mostly good notices but was a financial failure and has not been revived on Broadway. The 1981 musical adaptation was initially a failure but has subsequently been more successful, having been revived several times.

==Plot==
The play has three acts of three scenes each. Every scene is set earlier than the previous one.

=== Act One ===
In Scene I, it is 1934, and Richard Niles is a pretentious 40-year-old playwright who writes successful but forgettable frothy comedies. Niles is hosting a party for his wealthy friends at his Long Island home on the opening night of his newest play. His life is empty, petty and loveless. Among the guests at the party is Althea Royce, his materialistic wife; Sam Frankl, a prolific composer; and Julia Glenn, Niles&#x27;s final remaining true friend and a struggling alcoholic. The party guests play poker and talk until Cyrus Winthrop, an art dealer who invented a material called &quot;cellopaper&quot; a long time before, mentions a painter named Jonathan Crale. Crale used to be a close friend of Niles, but they have since parted ways. After the arrival of newspapers gushing praise for Niles&#x27;s newest play, Julia returns heavily drunk and collapses onto the drink table. After returning to her feet, she leaves the party and Niles for good. After one of the guests, Ivy Carrol, cuts her hand picking up glass, another guest, David, retrieves iodine to treat the wound. After Ivy and David leave, Althea confronts Niles about his possible affair with Ivy and how he only cares about making a hit. The argument is reaching a climax when Ivy returns, and in the heat of the moment Althea throws the iodine in Ivy&#x27;s face and proclaims that everything is over between her and Niles. The curtain comes down.

In Scene II, it is 1927 in the Restaurant Le Coq D&#x27;Or. Several guests are chatting about the plays of Althea Royce, who is at the height of her peak as an actress. She has only recently married Niles. Julia and Crale arrive, trying to rekindle their friendship with Niles. Niles has cut off all contact with Crale, and Crale is now going to Niles&#x27;s favorite lunch spot to see if he can talk to him. Julia and Crale reminisce about their past for a bit, but then Niles appears. Niles and Crale&#x27;s reunion quickly devolves into blows. Julia pleads with the two to stop fighting as an excited crowd gathers. The curtain comes down on the crowd&#x27;s cheers drowning out Julia.

In Scene III, it is 1926 in Richard Niles&#x27;s apartment. Niles&#x27;s brother George comes to visit, and confronts him about rumors of an affair with Royce, who is married to Harry Nixon. He denies it, and the conversation is interrupted with news that his latest play&#x27;s movie rights were bought for $75,000. George leaves and Crale enters. Crale reminds Niles of the time when he was just starting out and wrote plays for art, not money, and tells him to remove Althea&#x27;s bad influence from his life and focus on the woman who truly loves him: Julia, who has taken up drinking to cope with witnessing Niles&#x27;s destruction. Crale leaves, and Niles is about to start following his advice when Althea enters. She has divorced Harry to be with Niles. Niles receives word that Harry has killed himself in response. Althea embraces Niles, and after a moment he embraces her too. The act one curtain comes down.

=== Act Two ===
In Scene I, it is 1925 in Crale&#x27;s studio. Julia arrives, practically giddy with excitement. Niles is to return soon from an eight-month cruise and she is excited to see him again. While Crale and Julia are trying to figure out which port he will arrive at, Niles comes into the house accompanied by Albert Ogden, the boat&#x27;s captain. Julia asks Niles whether he&#x27;s finished the play he&#x27;s been working on, and Ogden replies yes; Niles has finished a yacht-set comedy play called &quot;All On Deck&quot; that Ogden is sure will be a hit. This isn&#x27;t the play Niles had been writing his friends about; he had been working on a more serious play about coal miners. When Julia asks Niles why he abandoned that play, he replies, &quot;[People] don&#x27;t want plays like that now.&quot; Niles leaves, and Julia breaks down. Julia laments that the last time they saw the &quot;real&quot; Niles was the day he got on the boat, and regrets telling him to take the cruise. Crale slumps into an east chair and plays a chord on his accordion, and the curtain comes down.

In Scene II, it is 1924 in the courthouse. The divorce proceedings for Richard Niles and Helen Murney have attracted large crowds. Helen filed for divorce after catching Niles cheating with Althea on a leopard skin rug after returning to a party, and the tabloids have been covering the scandal and trial nonstop. The trial has been very stressful for Niles, and his friends, along with Ogden, try to convince him to take a cruise to escape the stress. Niles seems unconvinced and wants to stay with his friends, but abruptly two tabloid photographers jump in with the leopard skin rug and stage a photo op. Niles breaks down crying and agrees to go on the cruise, and the curtain comes down.

In Scene III, it is 1923 in Althea&#x27;s apartment. Althea is having a party to celebrate the success of Niles&#x27;s newest play. At the party is Harry Nixon, Althea&#x27;s husband. He

==Background and production history==
On a journey from Hollywood to New York in 1931, Hart was inspired to write a play about an American family&#x27;s difficulty over 30 years coping with the challenges of life in the 20th century, beginning with their innocence and optimism at the century&#x27;s start to the dashed hopes caused by the stock market crash of 1929. But before he could realize his vision, Noël Coward&#x27;s British version of a similar story, &quot;Cavalcade&quot;, premiered, and he shelved the idea. A few years later, Hart turned to Kaufman, his collaborator on the 1930 hit &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot;. The idea had now evolved to tell a story backward about an idealistic but ambitious playwright and his difficulties.

The Broadway production, directed by Kaufman, opened on September 29, 1934, at the Music Box Theatre, where it ran for 155 performances. The 55-member cast included Kenneth MacKenna as Richard Niles, Walter Abel as Jonathan Crale, Jessie Royce Landis as Althea Royce, and Mary Philips as Julia Glenn.

The play has not been revived on Broadway, and its tour following the Broadway production was short.

==Critical response==
Critic Brooks Atkinson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;After this declaration of ethics, it will be impossible to dismiss Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Hart as clever jesters with an instinct for the stage.&quot; &quot;Time &quot;wrote, &quot;Superbly staged...; superbly acted by the biggest cast seen in a legitimate Broadway production this season, Merrily We Roll Along is an amusing and affecting study...&quot;&quot;&quot;

Despite good notices, the play was not a financial success, as the demands of the large-scale production made it expensive. 
In retrospect, the &quot;Times&quot; has noted that the play suffers from a &quot;Depression sensibility. The notion that you can&#x27;t get ahead without selling out is one that held particular appeal... There was something both morally and politically suspect about worldly fortune at a time when, as Franklin D. Roosevelt said in his 1937 inaugural address, one-third of the nation was &#x27;ill housed, ill clad, ill nourished.&#x27;&quot;

==Adaptations==
In 1981, the play was loosely adapted as a musical of the same name with a book by George Furth and lyrics and music by Stephen Sondheim. While the original Broadway production was a notorious failure, the musical has since been successfully staged with numerous changes. Sondheim contributed new songs to several of the show&#x27;s incarnations.

<text>Jean Vigo (; 26 April 1905 – 5 October 1934) was a French film director who helped establish poetic realism in film in the 1930s. His work influenced French New Wave cinema of the late 1950s and early 1960s.

==Biography==
Vigo was born to Emily Clero and the militant anarchist Miguel Almereyda. Much of Vigo&#x27;s early life was spent on the run with his parents. His father was imprisoned and probably murdered in Fresnes Prison on 13 August 1917, although the death was officially a suicide. Some speculated that Almereyda&#x27;s death was hushed up on orders of the Radical politicians Louis Malvy and Joseph Caillaux, who were later punished for wartime treason. The young Vigo was subsequently sent to boarding school under an assumed name, Jean Sales, to conceal his identity.

Vigo was married and had a daughter, Luce Vigo, a film critic, in 1931. He died in 1934 of complications from tuberculosis, which he had contracted eight years earlier.

==Career==
Vigo is noted for two films that affected the future development of both French and world cinema: &quot;Zero for Conduct&quot; (1933) and &quot;L&#x27;Atalante&quot; (1934). &quot;Zero for Conduct&quot; was approvingly described by critic David Thomson in &quot;The New Biographical Dictionary of Film&quot; as &quot;forty-four minutes of sustained, if roughly shot anarchic crescendo.&quot; &quot;L&#x27;Atalante&quot; was Vigo&#x27;s only full-length feature. The simple story of a newly married couple splitting and reuniting effortlessly merges unpolished, naturalistic filmmaking with shimmering, dreamlike sequences and effects. Thomson described the result as &quot;not so much a masterpiece as a definition of cinema, and thus a film that stands resolutely apart from the great body of films.&quot;

His career began with two other films: &quot;À propos de Nice&quot; (&quot;about Nice&quot;, 1930), a subversive silent film that considered social inequity in the resort town of Nice and was inspired by Soviet newsreels; and &quot;Jean Taris, Swimming Champion&quot; (1931), a study of swimmer Jean Taris. None of his four films was a financial success; at one point, with his and his wife&#x27;s health suffering, Vigo was forced to sell his camera.

&quot;Zero for Conduct&quot; was banned by the French government until after the war, and &quot;L&#x27;Atalante&quot; was mutilated by its distributor. By this point, Vigo was too ill to strenuously fight the matter. Both films have outlived their detractors; &quot;L&#x27;Atalante&quot; was chosen as the 10th-greatest film of all time in &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;″s 1962 poll, and as the 6th-best in its 1992 poll. In the late 1980s a 1934 copy of &quot;L&#x27;Atalante&quot; was found in the British National Film and Television Archive, and became a key element in the restoration of the film to its original version.

Writing on Vigo&#x27;s career in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, film critic Andrew Johnston stated: &quot;The ranks of the great film directors are short on Keatses and Shelleys, young artists cut off in their prime, leaving behind a handful of great works that suggest what might have been. But one who qualifies is Jean Vigo, the French director who died of tuberculosis at age 29 in 1934.&quot;

== Filmography ==
* 1930: &quot;À propos de Nice&quot;
* 1931: &quot;La Natation par Jean Taris&quot; or &quot;Taris, roi de l&#x27;eau&quot;
* 1933: &quot;Zéro de conduite&quot;
* 1934: &quot;L&#x27;Atalante&quot;

==Awards==
2011 Parajanov-Vartanov Institute Award posthumously honored Jean Vigo for &quot;Zero for Conduct&quot; and was presented to his daughter and French film critic Luce Vigo. Martin Scorsese wrote a letter for the occasion with praise for Vigo, Sergei Parajanov and Mikhail Vartanov, all of whom struggled with heavy censorship.

<doc id="161935" wikidata="Q266569" url="?curid=161935" title="Animator">
<text>An animator is an artist who creates images, known as frames, which give an illusion of movement called animation when displayed in rapid sequence. Animators can work in a variety of fields including film, television, and video games. Animation is closely related to filmmaking and like filmmaking is extremely labor-intensive, which means that most significant works require the collaboration of several animators. The methods of creating the images or frames for an animation piece depend on the animators&#x27; artistic styles and their field.

Other artists who contribute to animated cartoons, but who are not animators, include layout artists (who design the backgrounds, lighting, and camera angles), storyboard artists (who draw panels of the action from the script), and background artists (who paint the &quot;scenery&quot;). Animated films share some film crew positions with regular live action films, such as director, producer, sound engineer, and editor, but differ radically in that for most of the history of animation, they did not need most of the crew positions seen on a physical set.

In hand-drawn Japanese animation productions, such as in Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s films, the key animator handles both layout and key animation. Some animators in Japan such as Mitsuo Iso take full responsibility for their scenes, making them become more than just the key animator.

==Specialized fields==
Animators often specialize. One important distinction is between character animators (artists who specialize in character movement, dialogue, acting, etc.) and special effects animators (who animate anything that is &quot;not&quot; a character; most commonly vehicles, machinery, and natural phenomena such as rain, snow, and water).

Stop motion animators do not draw their images, instead they move models or cut-outs frame-by-frame, famous animators of this genre being Ray Harryhausen and Nick Park. 

==Inbetweeners and cleanup artists==
In large-scale productions by major studios, each animator usually has one or more assistants, &quot;inbetweeners&quot; and &quot;clean-up artists&quot;, who make drawings between the &quot;key poses&quot; drawn by the animator, and also re-draw any sketches that are too roughly made to be used as such. Usually, a young artist seeking to break into animation is hired for the first time in one of these categories, and can later advance to the rank of full animator (usually after working on several productions).

==Methods==
Historically, the creation of animation was a long and arduous process. Each frame of a given scene was hand-drawn, then transposed onto celluloid, where it would be traced and painted. These finished &quot;cels&quot; were then placed together in sequence over painted backgrounds and filmed, one frame at a time.

Animation methods have become far more varied in recent years. Today&#x27;s cartoons could be created using any number of methods, mostly using computers to make the animation process cheaper and faster. These more efficient animation procedures have made the animator&#x27;s job less tedious and more creative.

Audiences generally find animation to be much more interesting with sound. Voice actors and musicians, among other talent, may contribute vocal or music tracks. Some early animated films asked the vocal and music talent to synchronize their recordings to already-extant animation (and this is still the case when films are dubbed for international audiences). For the majority of animated films today, the soundtrack is recorded first in the language of the film&#x27;s primary target market and the animators are required to synchronize their work to the soundtrack.

==Evolution of animator&#x27;s roles==

As a result of the ongoing transition from traditional 2D to 3D computer animation, the animator&#x27;s traditional task of redrawing and repainting the same character 24 times a second (for each second of finished animation) has now been superseded by the modern task of developing dozens (or hundreds) of movements of different parts of a character in a virtual scene.

Because of the transition to computer animation, many additional support positions have become essential, with the result that the animator has become but one component of a very long and highly specialized production pipeline. In the 21st century, visual development artists design a character as a 2D drawing or painting, then hand it off to modelers who build the character as a collection of digital polygons. Texture artists &quot;paint&quot; the character with colorful or complex textures, and technical directors set up rigging so that the character can be easily moved and posed. For each scene, layout artists set up virtual cameras and rough blocking. Finally, when a character&#x27;s bugs have been worked out and its scenes have been blocked, it is handed off to an animator (that is, a person with that actual job title) who can start developing the exact movements of the character&#x27;s virtual limbs, muscles, and facial expressions in each specific scene.

At that point, the role of the modern computer animator overlaps in some respects with that of his or her predecessors in traditional animation: namely, trying to create scenes already storyboarded in rough form by a team of story artists, and synchronizing lip or mouth movements to dialogue already prepared by a screenwriter and recorded by vocal talent. Despite those constraints, the animator is still capable of exercising significant artistic skill and discretion in developing the character&#x27;s movements to accomplish the objective of each scene. There is an obvious analogy here between the art of animation and the art of acting, in that actors also must do the best they can with the lines they are given; it is often encapsulated by the common industry saying that animators are &quot;actors with pencils&quot;. In 2015, Chris Buck noted in an interview that animators have become &quot;actors with mice.&quot; Some studios bring in acting coaches on feature films to help animators work through such issues. Once each scene is complete and has been perfected through the &quot;sweat box&quot; feedback process, the resulting data can be dispatched to a render farm, where computers handle the tedious task of actually rendering all the frames. Each finished film clip is then checked for quality and rushed to a film editor, who assembles the clips together to create the film.

While early computer animation was heavily criticized for rendering human characters that looked plastic or even worse, eerie (see uncanny valley), contemporary software can now render strikingly realistic clothing, hair, and skin. The solid shading of traditional animation has been replaced by very sophisticated virtual lighting in computer animation, and computer animation can take advantage of many camera techniques used in live-action filmmaking (i.e., simulating real-world &quot;camera shake&quot; through motion capture of a cameraman&#x27;s movements). As a result, some studios now hire nearly as many lighting artists as animators for animated films, while costume designers, hairstylists, choreographers, and cinematographers have occasionally been called upon as consultants to computer-animated projects.

<text>The Tzadikim Nistarim (, &quot;hidden righteous ones&quot;) or Lamed Vav Tzadikim (,x&quot;36 righteous ones&quot;), often abbreviated to &quot;Lamed Vav(niks)&quot;, refers to 36 righteous people, a notion rooted within the mystical dimensions of Judaism. The singular form is Tzadik Nistar ().

==Origins==
The existence of 36 righteous people is first mentioned in the Talmud:
:There are no fewer than 36 righteous people in the world who greet the Shekhinah in each generation.

Another Talmudic passage mentions the righteous people, most of them unknown, who sustain the world. However, it gives a number other than 36:
:&quot;A homer of barley, and a letech of barley&quot; () - [this refers to] 45 righteous who cause the world to be sustained ... 30 in the land of Israel and 15 here [in Babylonia]. Abaye said: And most of them can be found in the synagogue, under the upper room [i.e. among the unhonored masses].

These two sources were combined into the idea that the world is sustained by 36 righteous people. The combination may have derived from the fact that to &quot;greet the Shekhinah&quot; was originally associated with Temple service, and Temple service was considered to sustain the world (Pirkei Avot 1:2).

The idea of 36 righteous became fully fleshed out in later generations:
As a mystical concept, the number 36 is even more intriguing. It is said that at all times there are 36 special people in the world, and that were it not for them, all of them, if even one of them was missing, the world would come to an end. The two Hebrew letters for 36 are the &quot;lamed&quot;, which is 30, and the &quot;vav&quot;, which is 6. Therefore, these 36 are referred to as the &quot;Lamed-Vav Tzadikim&quot;.
The idea is particularly prominent in Hasidic Judaism. Tzvi Elimelech Spira of Dinov, for example, wrote that &quot;in every generation, there are great righteous people who could perform wondrous acts, but the generation is not deserving of that, so the stature of the righteous people is hidden and they are not known to the public; sometimes they are woodchoppers or water-drawers.&quot;

===Revealed and hidden righteous===
The Baal Shem Tov wrote that &quot;just as there are 36 hidden righteous, there are 36 revealed righteous.&quot;

Commenting on (&quot;...those who lead the masses to righteousness will be like the stars forever and ever&quot;), the midrash explains that &quot;just as the stars are sometimes revealed and sometimes hidden, so, too with righteous people. And just as there are innumerable clusters of stars, so, too, there are innumerable clusters of righteous people,&quot; which indicates that there are significantly more than 36 in the world.

==Their purpose==

Mystical Hasidic Judaism as well as other segments of Judaism believe that there exist thirty-six righteous people whose role in life is to justify the purpose of humanity in the eyes of God. Jewish tradition holds that their identities are unknown to each other and that, if one of them comes to a realization of their true purpose, they would never admit it:

The &quot;Lamed-Vav Tzaddikim&quot; are also called the &quot;Nistarim&quot; (&quot;concealed ones&quot;). In our folk tales, they emerge from their self-imposed concealment and, by the mystic powers, which they possess, they succeed in averting the threatened disasters of a people persecuted by the enemies that surround them. They return to their anonymity as soon as their task is accomplished, &#x27;concealing&#x27; themselves once again in a Jewish community wherein they are relatively unknown. The &quot;lamed-vavniks&quot;, scattered as they are throughout the Diaspora, have no acquaintance with one another. On very rare occasions, one of them is &#x27;discovered&#x27; by accident, in which case the secret of their identity must not be disclosed. The lamed-vavniks do not themselves know that they are one of the 36. In fact, tradition has it that should a person claim to be one of the 36, that is proof positive that they are certainly not one. Since the 36 are each exemplars of &quot;anavah&quot;, (&quot;humility&quot;), having such a virtue would preclude against one’s self-proclamation of being among the special righteous. The 36 are simply too humble to believe that they are one of the 36.

==&quot;Lamedvovniks&quot;==

&quot;Lamedvovnik&quot; (), is the Yiddish term for one of the 36 humble righteous ones or &quot;Tzadikim&quot; mentioned in kabbalah or Jewish mysticism. According to this teaching, at any given time there are at least 36 holy persons in the world who are &quot;Tzadikim&quot;. These holy people are hidden; i.e., nobody knows who they are. According to some versions of the story, they themselves may not know who they are. For the sake of these 36 hidden saints, God preserves the world even if the rest of humanity has degenerated to the level of total barbarism. This is similar to the story of Sodom and Gomorrah in the Hebrew Bible, where God told Abraham that he would spare the city of Sodom if there was a quorum of at least 10 righteous men. Since nobody knows who the &quot;Lamedvovniks&quot; are, not even themselves, every Jew should act &quot;as if&quot; he or she might be one of them; i.e., lead a holy and humble life and pray for the sake of fellow human beings. It is also said that one of these 36 could potentially be the Jewish Messiah if the world is ready for them to reveal themselves. Otherwise, they live and die as an ordinary person. Whether the person knows they are the potential Messiah is debated.

The term &quot;lamedvovnik&quot; is derived from the Hebrew letters &quot;Lamed&quot; (L) and &quot;Vav&quot; (V), whose numerical value (see Gematria) adds up to 36. The &quot;nik&quot; at the end is a Russian or Yiddish suffix indicating &quot;a person who...&quot; (As in &quot;Beatnik&quot;; in English, this would be something like calling them &quot;The Thirty-Sixers&quot;.) The number 36 is twice 18. In gematria (a form of numerology used in Judaism), the number 18 stands for &quot;life&quot;, because the Hebrew letters that spell &quot;chai&quot;, meaning &quot;living&quot;, add up to 18. Because 36 = 2×18, it represents &quot;two lives&quot;.

In some Hasidic stories, disciples consider their Rebbes and other religious figures to be among the &quot;Lamedvovniks&quot;. It is also possible for a &quot;Lamedvovnik&quot; to reveal themselves as such, although that rarely happens—a &quot;Lamedvovnik&quot;&#x27;s status as an exemplar of humility would preclude it. More often, it is the disciples who speculate.

These beliefs are articulated in the works of Max Brod, and some (like Jorge Luis Borges) believe the concept to have originated in the Book of Genesis 18:26:

<text>A scene graph is a general data structure commonly used by vector-based graphics editing applications and modern computer games, which arranges the logical and often spatial representation of a graphical scene. It is a collection of nodes in a graph or tree structure. A tree node may have many children but only a single parent, with the effect of a parent applied to all its child nodes; an operation performed on a group automatically propagates its effect to all of its members. In many programs, associating a geometrical transformation matrix (see also transformation and matrix) at each group level and concatenating such matrices together is an efficient and natural way to process such operations. A common feature, for instance, is the ability to group related shapes and objects into a compound object that can then be manipulated as easily as a single object.

==Scene graphs in graphics editing tools==
In vector-based graphics editing, each leaf node in a scene graph represents some atomic unit of the document, usually a shape such as an ellipse or Bezier path. Although shapes themselves (particularly paths) can be decomposed further into nodes such as spline nodes, it is practical to think of the scene graph as composed of shapes rather than going to a lower level of representation.

Another useful and user-driven node concept is the layer. A layer acts like a transparent sheet upon which any number of shapes and shape groups can be placed. The document then becomes a set of layers, any of which can be conveniently made invisible, dimmed, or locked (made read-only). Some applications place all layers in a linear list, while others support layers within layers to any desired depth.

Internally, there may be no real structural difference between layers and groups at all, since they are both just nodes of a scene graph. If differences are needed, a common type declaration in C++ would be to make a generic node class, and then derive layers and groups as subclasses. A visibility member, for example, would be a feature of a layer, but not necessarily of a group.

==Scene graphs in games and 3D applications==
Scene graphs are useful for modern games using 3D graphics and increasingly large worlds or levels. In such applications, nodes in a scene graph (generally) represent entities or objects in the scene.

For instance, a game might define a logical relationship between a knight and a horse so that the knight is considered an extension to the horse. The scene graph would have a &#x27;horse&#x27; node with a &#x27;knight&#x27; node attached to it.

The scene graph may also describe the spatial, as well as the logical, relationship of the various entities: the knight moves through 3D space as the horse moves.

In these large applications, memory requirements are major considerations when designing a scene graph. For this reason, many large scene graph systems use geometry instancing to reduce memory costs and increase speed. In our example above, each knight is a separate scene node, but the graphical representation of the knight (made up of a 3D mesh, textures, materials and shaders) is instanced. This means that only a single copy of the data is kept, which is then referenced by any &#x27;knight&#x27; nodes in the scene graph. This allows a reduced memory budget and increased speed, since when a new knight node is created, the appearance data needs not be duplicated.

==Scene graph implementation==
The simplest form of scene graph uses an array or linked list data structure, and displaying its shapes is simply a matter of linearly iterating the nodes one by one. Other common operations, such as checking to see which shape intersects the mouse pointer are also done via linear searches. For small scene graphs, this tends to suffice.

===Scene graph operations and dispatch===
Applying an operation on a scene graph requires some way of dispatching an operation based on a node&#x27;s type. For example, in a render operation, a transformation group node would accumulate its transformation by matrix multiplication, vector displacement, quaternions or Euler angles. After which a leaf node sends the object off for rendering to the renderer. Some implementations might render the object directly, which invokes the underlying rendering API, such as DirectX or OpenGL. But since the underlying implementation of the rendering API usually lacks portability, one might separate the scene graph and rendering systems instead. In order to accomplish this type of dispatching, several different approaches can be taken.

In object-oriented languages such as C++, this can easily be achieved by virtual functions, where each represents an operation that can be performed on a node. Virtual functions are simple to write, but it is usually impossible to add new operations to nodes without access to the source code. Alternatively, the &quot;visitor pattern&quot; can be used. This has a similar disadvantage in that it is similarly difficult to add new node types.

Other techniques involve the use of RTTI (Run-Time Type Information). The operation can be realised as a class that is passed to the current node; it then queries the node&#x27;s type using RTTI and looks up the correct operation in an array of callbacks or functors. This requires that the map of types to callbacks or functors be initialized at runtime, but offers more flexibility, speed and extensibility.

Variations on these techniques exist, and new methods can offer added benefits. One alternative is scene graph rebuilding, where the scene graph is rebuilt for each of the operations performed. This, however, can be very slow, but produces a highly optimised scene graph. It demonstrates that a good scene graph implementation depends heavily on the application in which it is used.

====Traversals====
Traversals are the key to the power of applying operations to scene graphs. A traversal generally consists of starting at some arbitrary node (often the root of the scene graph), applying the operation(s) (often the updating and rendering operations are applied one after the other), and recursively moving down the scene graph (tree) to the child nodes, until a leaf node is reached. At this point, many scene graph engines then traverse back up the tree, applying a similar operation. For example, consider a render operation that takes transformations into account: while recursively traversing down the scene graph hierarchy, a pre-render operation is called. If the node is a transformation node, it adds its own transformation to the current transformation matrix. Once the operation finishes traversing all the children of a node, it calls the node&#x27;s post-render operation so that the transformation node can undo the transformation. This approach drastically reduces the necessary amount of matrix multiplication.

Some scene graph operations are actually more efficient when nodes are traversed in a different order – this is where some systems implement scene graph rebuilding to reorder the scene graph into an easier-to-parse format or tree.

For example, in 2D cases, scene graphs typically render themselves by starting at the tree&#x27;s root node and then recursively draw the child nodes. The tree&#x27;s leaves represent the most foreground objects. Since drawing proceeds from back to front with closer objects simply overwriting farther ones, the process is known as employing the Painter&#x27;s algorithm. In 3D systems, which often employ depth buffers, it is more efficient to draw the closest objects first, since farther objects often need only be depth-tested instead of actually rendered, because they are occluded by nearer objects.

==Scene graphs and bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs)==
Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVHs) are useful for numerous tasks – including efficient culling and speeding up collision detection between objects. A BVH is a spatial structure, but doesn&#x27;t have to partition the geometry (see spatial partitioning below).

A BVH is a tree of bounding volumes (often spheres, axis-aligned bounding boxes or oriented bounding boxes). At the bottom of the hierarchy, the size of the volume is just large enough to encompass a single object tightly (or possibly even some smaller fraction of an object in high resolution BVHs). As one ascends the hierarchy, each node has its own volume that tightly encompasses all the volumes beneath it. At the root of the tree is a volume that encompasses all the volumes in the tree (the whole scene).

BVHs are useful for speeding up collision detection between objects. If an object&#x27;s bounding volume does not intersect a volume higher in the tree, it cannot intersect any object below that node (so they are all rejected very quickly).

There are some similarities between BVHs and scene graphs. A scene graph can easily be adapted to include/become a BVH – if each node has a volume associated or there is a purpose-built &quot;bound node&quot; added in at convenient location in the hierarchy. This may not be the typical view of a scene graph, but there are benefits to including a BVH in a scene graph.

==Scene graphs and spatial partitioning==
An effective way of combining spatial partitioning and scene graphs is by creating a scene leaf node that contains the spatial partitioning data. This can increase computational efficiency of rendering.

Spatial data is usually static and generally contains non-moving scene data in some partitioned form. Some systems may have the systems and their rendering separately. This is fine and there are no real advantages to either method. In particular, it is bad to have the scene graph contained within the spatial partitioning system, as the scene graph is better thought of as the grander system to the spatial partitioning.

Very large drawings, or scene graphs that are generated solely at runtime (as happens in ray tracing rendering programs), require defining of group nodes in a more automated fashion. A raytracer, for example, will take a scene description of a 3D model and build an internal representation that breaks up its individual parts into bounding boxes (also called bounding slabs). These boxes are grouped hierarchically so that ray intersection tests (as part of visibility determination) can be efficiently computed. A group box that does not intersect an eye ray, for example, can entirely skip testing any of its members.

A similar efficiency holds in 2D applications as well. If the user has magnified a document so that only part of it is visible on his computer screen, and then scrolls in it, it is useful to use a bounding box (or in this case, a bounding rectangle scheme) to quickly determine which scene graph elements are visible and thus actually need to be drawn.

Depending on the particulars of the application&#x27;s drawing performance, a large part of the scene graph&#x27;s design can be impacted by rendering efficiency considerations. In 3D video games such as Quake, binary space partitioning (BSP) trees are heavily favored to minimize visibility tests. BSP trees, however, take a very long time to compute from design scene graphs, and must be recomputed if the design scene graph changes, so the levels tend to remain static, and dynamic characters aren&#x27;t generally considered in the spatial partitioning scheme.

Scene graphs for dense regular objects such as heightfields and polygon meshes tend to employ quadtrees and octrees, which are specialized variants of a 3D bounding box hierarchy. Since a heightfield occupies a box volume itself, recursively subdividing this box into eight subboxes (hence the &#x27;oct&#x27; in octree) until individual heightfield elements are reached is efficient and natural. A quadtree is simply a 2D octree.

==Standards==

===PHIGS===
PHIGS was the first commercial scene graph specification, and became an ANSI standard in 1988. Disparate implementations were provided by Unix hardware vendors. The HOOPS 3D Graphics System appears to have been the first commercial scene graph library provided by a single software vendor. It was designed to run on disparate lower-level 2D and 3D interfaces, with the first major production version (v3.0) completed in 1991.

===SGI===
Silicon Graphics (SGI) released OpenGL Performer or more commonly called Performer in 1991 which was the primary scenegraph system for most SGI products into the future. IRIS Inventor 1.0 (1992) was released by SGI, which was a high level scene graph built on top of Performer. It was followed up with Open Inventor in 1994, another iteration of the high level scene graph built on top of newer releases of Performer. More 3D scene graph libraries can be found in :Category:3D scenegraph APIs.

===X3D===
X3D is a royalty-free open standards file format and run-time architecture to represent and communicate 3D scenes and objects using XML. It is an ISO-ratified standard that provides a system for the storage, retrieval and playback of real-time graphics content embedded in applications, all within an open architecture to support a wide array of domains and user scenarios.
