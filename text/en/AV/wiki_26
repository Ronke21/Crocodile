<text>Mississauga is a Canadian city in the province of Ontario. Situated on the western shore of Lake Ontario in the Regional Municipality of Peel, it borders Toronto (Etobicoke) to the east, Brampton to the north, Milton to the northwest, and Oakville to the southwest. With a population of 717,961 as of 2021, Mississauga is the seventh-most populous municipality in Canada, third-most in Ontario, and second-most in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) after Toronto itself. However, for the first time in its history, the city&#x27;s population declined according to the 2021 census, from a 2016 population of 721,599 to 717,961, a 0.5 per cent decrease.

The growth of Mississauga was initially attributed to its proximity to Toronto. However, during the latter half of the 20th century, the city attracted a diverse and multicultural population. Over time, it built up a thriving, transit-oriented central business district of its own, which is now known as Mississauga City Centre. Malton, a neighbourhood of the city located in its northeast end, is home to Toronto Pearson International Airport, Canada&#x27;s busiest airport, as well as the headquarters of many Canadian and multinational corporations. Mississauga is not a traditional city, but is instead an amalgamation of three former villages, two townships, and a number of rural hamlets (a general pattern common to several suburban GTA cities) that were significant population centres, with none being clearly dominant, prior to the city&#x27;s incorporation that later coalesced into a single urban area.

Indigenous people have lived in the area for thousands of years and Mississauga is situated on the traditional territory of the Huron-Wendat, Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabeg people, including the namesake Mississaugas. Most of present-day Mississauga was founded in 1805 as Toronto Township within York County, and became part of Peel County when new counties were formed by splitting off parts of the original county in 1851. Mississauga itself was established in 1968 as a town, and was reincorporated as a city in 1974, when Peel was restructured into a regional municipality.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Mississauga&quot; comes from the Anishinaabe word , meaning &quot;[Those at the] Great River-mouth&quot;.

Other forms such as &quot;Sauga&quot; and, in reference to the city&#x27;s residents, &quot;Saugans&quot;, and &quot;Mississaugans&quot;, are also commonly used.

==History==
=== Palaeo-Indigenous period (9000–8500 BCE) ===
A single site in Mississauga with Hi-Lo projectile points was registered in the Ontario Ministry of Culture database of archaeological sites. Lake Ontario was much smaller at this time, and sites from this period may be 500 m into the lake.

=== Archaic period (8000–1000 BCE) ===
According to Smith, there was a growing population at this time. There are 23 known Archaic sites in Mississauga, mostly in the Credit River and Cooksville Creek drainage systems. People would congregate at rapids and the mouths of these rivers to catch fish during spawning runs. They would harvest nuts and wild rice at the wetland margins in the late summer. During late Archaic times, there were large cemeteries.

=== Woodland period (1000 BCE–1650 CE) ===
&quot;The accelerating upward population increase continued,&quot; with 23 known sites from this period. Pottery first appears during this period in the style of the Point Peninsula complex, and near the end of the Woodland period, the first semi-permanent villages appear. Artifacts show that these people engaged in long-distance trade, likely as part of the Hopewell tradition.

==== Late Woodland culture (500–1650 CE) ====
&quot;The band level of social organization that characterized earlier cultures gave way eventually to the tribal level of the Ontario Iroquoian Tradition,&quot; and people began cultivation of crops such as maize, beans, squash, sunflowers, and tobacco. This led to the development of the Wyandot or Huron, Iroquoian-speaking culture. The Lightfoot site with four to six longhouses was located on the Credit River near Mississauga&#x27;s border with Brampton. Another village with many longhouses was on the Antrex site, located on a wide ridge bounded by two small tributaries of Cooksville Creek.

=== Arrival of the Haudenosaunee, the Anishinaabe, and the Europeans ===
Around the end of the Woodland period, the Haudenosaunee, another Iroquoian confederacy, began to move into the area, and, as part of a long conflict known as the Beaver wars, they had dispersed the Wyandot by 1650. But by 1687, the Haudenosaunee had abandoned their new settlements along the north shore of Lake Ontario.

The Algonquian-speaking Anishinaabe Ojibwe people had been aligned with the Wyandot, and when they were dispersed, the Anishinaabe expanded eastward into the Credit River Valley area, clashing with the Haudenosaunee and eventually taking over when the Haudenosaunee retreated. The European traders would gather annually at the mouth of what is now known as the Credit River to give the Anishinaabe credit for the following year. &quot;From this, the Mississauga bands at the western end of the lake became known collectively as the Credit River Mississaugas.&quot;

Toronto Township, consisting of most of present-day Mississauga, was formed on 2 August 1805 when officials from York (what is now the City of Toronto) purchased 85,000 acres (340 km2) of land from the Mississaugas under Treaty 14. A second treaty was signed in 1818 that surrendered 2,622 km2 of Mississauga land to the British Crown. In total Mississauga is covered by four treaties: Treaty 14, Treaty 19, Treaty 22 and Treaty 23.

=== Founding of Settlements ===
Mississauga&#x27;s original villages (and some later incorporated towns) settled included Clarkson, Cooksville, Dixie, Erindale (called Springfield until 1890), Lakeview, Lorne Park, Port Credit, Sheridan, and Summerville. The region became known as Toronto Township. Part of northeast Mississauga, including the Airport lands and Malton were a part of Toronto Gore Township.

After the land was surveyed, the Crown gave much of it in the form of land grants to United Empire Loyalists who emigrated from the Thirteen Colonies during and after the American Revolution, as well as loyalists from New Brunswick. A group of settlers from New York State arrived in the 1830s. The government wanted to compensate the Loyalists for property lost in the colonies and encourage development of what was considered frontier. In 1820, the government purchased additional land from the Mississaugas. Additional settlements were established, including: Barbertown, Britannia, Burnhamthorpe, Churchville, Derry West, Elmbank, Malton, Meadowvale (Village), Mount Charles, and Streetsville. European-Canadian settlement led to the eventual displacement of the Mississaugas. In 1847, the government relocated them to a reserve in the Grand River Valley, near present-day Hagersville. Pre-confederation, the Township of Toronto was formed as a local government; settlements within were not legal villages until much later.

=== Suburban growth and the creation of Mississauga ===
Except for small villages and some gristmills and brickworks served by railway lines, most of present-day Mississauga was agricultural land, including fruit orchards, through much of the 19th and first half of the 20th century. In the 1920s, cottages were constructed along the shores of Lake Ontario as weekend getaway homes for Torontonians. 

The Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) highway, one of the first controlled-access highways in the world, opened from Highway 27 to Highway 10 (Hurontario Street) in Port Credit, in 1935 and later expanded to Hamilton and Niagara in 1939.

In 1937, 1,410.8 acres of land was sold to build Malton Airport (which later became Pearson Airport). It became Canada&#x27;s busiest airport which later put the end to the community of Elmbank.

The first prototypical suburban growth of Toronto Township began after World War II, Applewood Acres was the first major planned development near the QEW and Dixie Road, and urbanization soon rapidly expanded north and west. In 1952, Toronto Township annexed the southern portion of Toronto Gore Township. Two large new towns; Erin Mills and (New) Meadowvale, were started in 1968 and 1969, respectively. Most of Mississauga was built out by 2005. 

While the Township had many settlements within it, none of them (save for the larger enclave communities of Port Credit and Streetsville) were incorporated, and all residents were represented by a singular Township council (Malton had special status as a police village, allowing it partial autonomy). To reflect the community&#x27;s shift away from rural to urban, council desired conversion into a town, and in 1965 a call for public input on naming it received thousands of letters offering hundreds of different suggestions. &quot;Mississauga&quot; was chosen by plebiscite over &quot;Sheridan&quot; by a vote of 11,796 to 4,331, and in 1968 the reincorporation went forward, absorbing Malton in the process. Port Credit and Streetsville remained separate, uninterested in ceding their autonomy or being taxed to the needs of a growing municipality. Political will, as well as a belief that a larger city would be a hegemony in Peel County, kept them as independent enclaves within the Town of Mississauga, but both were amalgamated into Mississauga when it reincorporated as a city in 1974. At this time, Mississauga annexed lands west of Winston Churchill Boulevard from Oakville in the northwest, in exchange for lands in the northernmost extremity (which included Churchville) south of Steeles Avenue which were transferred to Brampton. That year, Square One Shopping Centre opened; it has since expanded several times.

On 10 November 1979, a 106-car freight train derailed on the CP rail line while carrying explosive and poisonous chemicals just north of the intersection of Mavis Road and Dundas Street. One of the tank cars carrying propane exploded, and since other tank cars were carrying chlorine, the decision was made to evacuate nearby residents. With the possibility of a deadly cloud of chlorine gas spreading through Mississauga, 218,000 people were evacuated. Residents were allowed to return home once the site was deemed safe. At the time, it was the largest peacetime evacuation in North American history. Due to the speed and efficiency with which it was conducted, many cities later studied and modelled their own emergency plans after Mississauga&#x27;s. For many years afterwards, the name &quot;Mississauga&quot; was, for Canadians, associated with a major rail disaster.

North American telephone customers placing calls to Mississauga (and other post-1970 Ontario cities) may not recognise the charge details on their bills. The area&#x27;s incumbent local exchange carrier, Bell Canada, continues to split the city into five historical rate centres–Clarkson, Cooksville, Malton, Port Credit, and Streetsville. However, they are combined as a single Mississauga listing in the phone book. The first Touch-Tone telephones in Canada were introduced in Malton on 15 June 1964.

On 1 January 2010, Mississauga bought land from the Town of Milton and expanded its border by , to Highway 407, affecting 25 residents. Also in January 2010, the Mississaugas and the federal government settled a land claim, in which the band of indigenous people received $145,000,000, as just compensation for their land and lost income.

==Geography==

Mississauga covers of land, fronting of shoreline on Lake Ontario.

Mississauga is bounded by Oakville and Milton to the west/southwest, Brampton to the north, Toronto to the east, and Lake Ontario to the south/south-east. Halton Hills borders Mississauga&#x27;s north-west corner. With the exception of the southeast border with Toronto (Etobicoke Creek), Mississauga shares a land border with all previously mentioned municipalities.

Two major river valleys feed into the lake. The Credit River is by far the longest with the heaviest flow, it divides the western side of Mississauga from the central/eastern portions and enters the lake at the Port Credit harbour. The indented, mostly forested valley was inhabited by first nation peoples long before European exploration of the area. The valley is protected and maintained by the Credit Valley Conservation Authority (CVCA).

Etobicoke Creek forms part of the eastern border of Mississauga with the city of Toronto. North of there it passes through the western limits of Pearson Airport. There have been two aviation accidents, in 1978 and 2005 where aircraft overshot the runway and slid into the Etobicoke creek banks. In 1954, heavy flooding resulted in some homes along the riverbank being swept into the lake after heavy rains from Hurricane Hazel. Since that storm, houses are no longer constructed along the floodplain. The creek and its tributaries are administered by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA).

Most land in Mississauga drains to either of the two main river systems, with the exception of the smaller Mary Fix and Cooksville Creeks which run roughly through the centre of Mississauga entering the lake near Port Credit. Some small streams and reservoirs are part of the Sixteen Mile Creek system in the far north-west corner of the city, but these drain toward the lake in neighbouring Milton and Oakville.

The shoreline of former Glacial Lake Iroquois roughly follows the Dundas Street alignment, although it is not noticeable in some places but is more prominent in others, such as the site of the former brickyard (Shoreline Dr. near Mavis Rd.), the ancient shoreline promenteau affords a clear view of downtown Toronto and Lake Ontario on clear days. The land in Mississauga in ranges from a maximum elevation of 214 m (699 ft) ASL in the far western corner, near the Hwy. 407/401 junction, to a minimum elevation at the Lake Ontario shore of 76 m (249 ft) above sea level.

Apart from the embankments of Credit River valley, it tributaries and the Iroquois shoreline, the only noticeable hills in Mississauga are actually part of the former Britannia Landfill, now a golf course on Terry Fox Way.

On August 17 2024, heavy rainfalls caused localized flooding in areas across the city. The floods caused many traffic disruptions as well as dangerous road conditions and road closures. All creeks and rivers throughout Mississauga were either at full capacity or flooded into parks and greenspaces.

===Climate===
Mississauga&#x27;s climate is similar to that of Toronto and is considered to be moderate, located in plant hardiness zone 6b. Under the Köppen climate classification, Mississauga has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa/Dfb&quot;). Summers can bring periods of high temperatures accompanied with high humidity. While the average daily high temperature in July and August is , temperatures can rise above . In an average summer, there are an average of 15.8 days where the temperature rises above . Winters can be cold with temperatures that are frequently below freezing. In January and February, the mean temperatures are and respectively, it is common for temperatures to fall to , usually for only short periods. In an average winter, there are 3.9 nights where the temperature falls below . The amount of snowfall received during an average winter season is , averaging 44.4 days with measurable snowfall. The climate of Mississauga is officially represented by Pearson International Airport but because of its topography and large surface area conditions can differ depending on location: fog tends to be more common along the Lakeshore and in the Credit River Valley at certain times of year, particularly during the spring and autumn.

During snowfalls when temperatures hover close to freezing, northern parts of the city, such as around Derry Road, including Pearson Airport away from warmer Lake Ontario usually get more snow that sticks to the ground because of the lower temperatures, often when rain transitions into snow or mixed precipitation. The reverse occurs when a strong storm approaches from the south kicking up lake effect snow, bringing higher snowfall totals to south Mississauga. 
The city usually experiences at least six months of snow-free weather; however, there is the odd occurrence where snow does fall either in October or May, none which sticks to the ground. The Port Credit and Lakeview areas have a micro-climate more affected by the proximity of the open lake, warming winter temperatures as a result, but it can be sharply cooler on spring and summer afternoons, this can also be the case in Clarkson, but with much less consistency.

Most thunderstorms are not severe but can occasionally bring violent winds. The last known tornado to cause significant damage touched down on 7 July 1985, when an F1-rated tornado struck an industrial park in the Meadowvale area (Argentia Road), heavily damaging some buildings and some parked tractor trailers. A relatively strong tornado tore a path across Mississauga (then part of Toronto Township) on 24 June 1923, cutting a swath from present-day Meadowvale to near Cooksville, killing four people and causing massive property damage in a time when most of Mississauga was still rural farmland dotted with fruit orchards.

==Attractions==
===Mississauga Celebration Square===

In 2006, with the help of Project for Public Spaces, the city started hosting &quot;My Mississauga&quot; summer festivities at its Civic Square. Mississauga planned over 60 free events to bring more people to the city square. The square was transformed and included a movable stage, a snack bar, extra seating, and sports and gaming facilities (basketball nets, hockey arena, chess and checker boards) including a skate park. Some of the events included Senior&#x27;s day on Tuesday, Family day on Wednesday, Vintage car Thursdays, with the main events being the Canada Day celebration, Rotary Ribfest, Tree Lighting Ceremony, and Beachfest.

Civic Square has completed its restructuring project using federal stimulus money, which features a permanent stage, a larger ice rink (which also serves as a fountain and wading pool during the summer season), media screens, and a permanent restaurant. It officially reopened at 22 June 2011 and has since been renamed as Mississauga Celebration Square. More events have been added such as holding free outdoor live concerts, and live telecast of UEFA European Football Championship. The square also holds weekly programming such as fitness classes, amphitheatre performances and movie nights during the summer, children&#x27;s activities during spring and fall, and skate parties during the winter. The opening of the square has also allowed the city to hold its first annual New Year&#x27;s Eve celebration in 2011.

In October 2012, the square had attracted its one millionth visitor.

Mississauga City Council consists of the mayor and eleven city councillors, each representing one of the city&#x27;s eleven numbered wards. The former mayor, Hazel McCallion, at one time the longest-serving mayor in Canada, was succeeded by Bonnie Crombie in November 2014, who resigned in January 2024 to become the leader of the liberal party of Ontario. Currently, the seat is held by Carolyn Parrish since 2024.

===Wards and councillors===
Council elected in the 2022 municipal election:

The City of Mississauga has had only four mayors in its history. Martin Dobkin was the city&#x27;s first mayor in 1974. He was then followed by Ron A. Searle. Searle was defeated in 1978 by then-city councillor and former mayor of Streetsville, McCallion. McCallion won 12 consecutive terms as mayor, but she chose to retire prior to the November 2014 election and was succeeded by Bonnie Crombie, who won the election.

McCallion was regarded as a force in provincial politics and often referred to as &quot;Hurricane Hazel&quot;, after the devastating 1954 storm that struck the Toronto area. McCallion won or was acclaimed in every mayoral election from 1978 to 2010, in some later elections without even campaigning. In October 2010, McCallion won her twelfth term in office with over 76% of the votes. McCallion was the nation&#x27;s longest-serving mayor and was runner-up in World Mayor 2005. In 2014 McCallion did not run again, but endorsed Crombie, the eventual winner who became mayor in November 2014.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Rail====
Mississauga is on three major railway lines (one each owned by the Canadian National Railway, the Canadian Pacific Railway, and Metrolinx). Toronto–Sarnia Via Rail trains on the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor pass through Mississauga and make request stops at Malton GO Station in the northeast of the city. Other Via Rail services stop in the neighbouring cities of Brampton, Oakville, and Toronto.

====Commuter rail====

Commuter rail service is provided by GO Transit, a division of Metrolinx, on the Lakeshore West, Kitchener, and Milton lines. All-day service is provided along the Lakeshore West line, while the Kitchener and Milton lines serve commuters going to and from Toronto&#x27;s Union Station during rush hours.

====Bus====

The city&#x27;s public transit service, MiWay (formerly Mississauga Transit), provides bus service along more than 60 routes across the city, and connects to commuter rail with GO Transit as well as with Brampton Transit, Oakville Transit, and the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). MiWay operates routes for both local service (branded as &quot;MiLocal&quot;) and limited-stop service (branded as &quot;MiExpress&quot;).

Intercity buses operated by GO Transit stop at GO Train stations throughout the city and the Square One Bus Terminal.

====Mississauga Transitway====

A 12-station busway similar to Ottawa&#x27;s Transitway was built parallel to Highway 403 from Winston Churchill Boulevard to Renforth Avenue, via the Mississauga City Centre Transit Terminal. Opened in stages, the Mississauga Transitway was completed on 22 November 2017 with the opening of the final station: Renforth. The service also connects to Kipling Subway Station in Toronto, via mixed lane traffic after Renforth station.

====Hurontario LRT====

There are plans for the construction of an LRT line along Hurontario Street stretching from Port Credit to southern Brampton, and possibly to Brampton&#x27;s downtown. The project went through the Transit Project Assessment Process (TPAP) which includes environmental assessment. The line will be fully funded by the provincial government, with construction set to begin in 2018. Rapid transit lines could possibly be built on some other main thoroughfares, namely Dundas Street and Lakeshore Road, but no definite dates have been set.

As of 2024, progress for the Hurontario LRT is well underway, with an expected completion of late 2024 to mid-2025.

====Toronto Subway====

In addition to the light rail line, there are plans to extend Line 5 Eglinton to Renforth station and Toronto Pearson International Airport though eastern Mississauga by 2030–2031 bringing the Toronto Subway into Mississauga. There will be 4 stops in the city at Renforth Gateway connecting with the Mississauga Transitway and serving the Airport Corporate Centre, Convair serving the GTAA headquarters and airfield and aircraft maintenance areas, Silver Dart serving rental car facilities and airport hotels, and Pearson Airport serving the airport at a future transit hub.

====Highways====
Highway 401 (or the Macdonald-Cartier Freeway, connecting Windsor to the Quebec border) passes through the city&#x27;s north end. The eastern part uses the collector/express lane system and feeds into Highway 403, the main freeway in the city, which runs through the City Centre and Erin Mills areas. The Queen Elizabeth Way, the city&#x27;s first freeway, runs through the southern half of the city. These three freeways each run east–west, with the exception of the 403 from the 401 to Cawthra Road, and from the 407 to QEW. North of the 401, the collector lanes of the 403 become Highway 410, which goes to Brampton. Part of Highway 409 is within the city of Mississauga, and it provides access to Pearson Airport. Two other freeways run along or close to Mississauga&#x27;s municipal borders. Highway 407 runs metres from the northern city limits in a power transmission corridor and forms the city&#x27;s boundary with Milton between highways 401 and 403. Highway 427 forms the Toronto-Mississauga boundary in the northeast, and is always within 2 kilometres of the boundary further south, with the exception of the area around Centennial Park.

====Air====

Lester B. Pearson International Airport (YYZ), operated by the Greater Toronto Airports Authority in the northeastern part of the city, is the largest and busiest airport in Canada. In 2015, it handled 41,036,847 passengers and 443,958 aircraft movements. It is a major North American global gateway, handling more international passengers than any airport in North America other than John F. Kennedy International Airport. Pearson is the main hub for Air Canada, and a hub for passenger airline WestJet and cargo airline FedEx Express. It is served by over 75 airlines, having over 180 destinations.

====Bicycle====
In 2010, the City of Mississauga approved a Cycling Master Plan outlining a strategy to develop over of on and off-road cycling routes in the city over the next 20 years. Over 1,000 Mississauga citizens and stakeholders contributed their thoughts and ideas to help develop this plan. The plan focuses on fostering cycling as a way of life in the city, building an integrated network of cycling routes and aims to adopt a safety first approach to cycling.

As of 2024, the city has bi-directional bus lanes on most major arteries, with designated bike paths on many roads such as Eglinton Avenue, Lakeshore Road West, Burnhamthorpe Road and Derry Road, to name a few. For roads which do not have designated bike lanes, there is often signage posted as well as markings on the road, indicating that bikes are permitted to use the shoulder where available, or the right-most lane in most other situations.

===Emergency services===
Peel Regional Police provide policing within the city of Mississauga and airport. In addition, the Ontario Provincial Police have a Port Credit detachment in the city for patrolling provincial highways. Mississauga Fire and Emergency Services provide fire fighting services and Peel Regional Paramedic Services provides emergency medical services. Toronto Pearson also has its own fire department with two halls that service calls within the airport grounds.

===Healthcare===
The city&#x27;s two main hospitals—Credit Valley Hospital and Mississauga Hospital—were amalgamated into the Trillium Health Partners hospital group in December 2011. The health system and the administration for students in Mississauga was the property of the Peel District School Board Health Centre and the health support for citizens in Mississauga was the property of Peel Health Centre. The eastern part of Mississauga was the property of Pearson Health (Greater Toronto Area Health Department).

*serving Orangeville and Brampton and connecting with Brampton GO Station on the Georgetown line via Highway 10 and Brampton&#x27;s Main Street.

====Local transit====

Due to its largely rural nature, Caledon does not have its own transit system; however, Brampton Transit provides a rush hour-only bus line, 41 Bolton in Bolton and travels south down Highway 50 in to Queen Street/Highway 7 (at the border of Brampton and Vaughan) to make connections with other Brampton Transit routes and York Region Transit (YRT). Brampton Transit also operates three other routes short distances into suburban areas bordering Brampton within the town: Route 81 Mayfield West serves Kennedy Road in Mayfield West, and Routes 18 Dixie and 30 Airport Road provide limited service into industrial areas.

Paratransit services for the elderly, disabled, and infirm are provided by Caledon Community Services Transportation and Transhelp. Both are run by the Region of Peel Accessible Transportation Services.

====History====

There were two earlier privately-operated transit services running solely within Bolton with no connections to other services: In 1999 a company named Caledon Transit Incorporated ran a trial bus service in the community. In 2006, the growing population of Bolton prompted local resident Darren Parberry to start a second bus service with two routes using leased school buses, called Métis Transit. One route ran briefly in 2006. Both services ceased operations due to low ridership. Between 2019 and 2024, there was a third service, operated by a private contractor, Voyago, which provided minibus service in Bolton and traveled south down Highway 50 to Queen Street/Highway 7 to connect with Brampton Transit and YRT until it was replaced by the current Brampton Transit Route 41 on May 1, 2024. Adult cash fares were $4.00 and there were no free transfers with these systems.

<doc id="160096" wikidata="Q1869303" url="?curid=160096" title="Mutts (comic strip)">
<text>MUTTS is a daily comic strip created by Patrick McDonnell and launched on September 5, 1994. Distributed by King Features Syndicate, it follows the adventures of Earl, a dog, and Mooch, a cat. Earl and Mooch interact with each other, their human owners, as well as the animals around their neighborhood.

&quot;MUTTS&quot; has received numerous awards internationally, both for comic strip excellence and for its themes of animal protection. &quot;Peanuts&quot; creator Charles Schulz praised &quot;MUTTS&quot;, calling it &quot;one of the best comic strips of all time.&quot;

==Characters and story==

The friendship of Mooch and Earl focuses on the differences between cats and dogs as human companions and as friends with each other: Earl is friendly, loves the company of his human companion, and likes to play outside; Mooch is often indifferent to his human companions, except when being fed, and prefers to stay inside or is often seen with Earl, his best friend. Both animals frequently express themselves through thought balloons when their owners are present.

===Earl===
Earl is an innocent black and white Jack Russell terrier who lives with his human companion Ozzie, a bachelor. They love spending time together and taking frequent walks. Earl often howls in loneliness when Ozzie is away from home. Earl spends much of his free time with Mooch, either inside or wandering around town visiting other animals. He loves to eat both human food and his own dog food. It is revealed in a 2011 Valentine&#x27;s Day strip that Earl was adopted by Ozzie from a shelter. Earl was inspired by Patrick McDonnell&#x27;s late Jack Russell terrier, also named Earl, who lived with Patrick and his wife for more than 18 years.

===Mooch===
Mooch is a curious tuxedo cat with a large nose who lives next door to Earl with his human companions Millie (who often calls him &quot;Moochie,&quot; &quot;Moo Moo Cakes,&quot; or &quot;Shmoochums,&quot; and he calls her &quot;Shmillie&quot;) and Frank, a goldfish named Sid, and a snail named Little Earl. Mooch can be reclusive, sometimes preferring to stay inside and nap, or play with his Little Pink Sock, rather than go outside with Earl. He has a speech impediment that causes him to insert an &quot;sh&quot; into words, such as &quot;yesh&quot; (yes), &quot;shmilk&quot; (milk) and &quot;shmousie&quot; (mousie). He frequently snubs (or shnubs) his cat food, much to Millie&#x27;s chagrin, dislikes car rides, and, like Earl, he eats human food at every opportunity.

=== Appearances in other comics ===
In 2005, Earl and Mooch appeared as guests in Blondie and Dagwood&#x27;s 75th anniversary in the comic strip &quot;Blondie.&quot; In 2004, &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot; crossed over with &quot;MUTTS.&quot; In that strip, Rat goes to Comics Re-education Camp, where Earl and Mooch try to teach Rat to be a Lovable comic strip character. In another strip, Frank and Mooch are hanging out with many old comic strip characters, including but not limited to: &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, &quot;Peanuts&quot;, and Little Nemo&quot;.&quot;

==Other characters==
===Humans===
*Ozzie – The beloved guardian of Earl, a 30-something bachelor
*Millie – The doting guardian of Mooch, married to Frank
*Frank – The cantankerous and sometimes reluctant caretaker of Mooch, married to Millie
*Butchie – Owner of Fatty Snax Deli, who tries to stop Mooch and Earl from eating his food. Formerly a butcher, Butchie became a vegan in June 2020, and re-opened his deli with a vegan menu.

*Sparky (formerly Guard Dog) – A tough-looking, tethered dog with a soft heart. Sparky&#x27;s mission is to remind humans that it&#x27;s wrong to perpetually chain a dog. He was finally untethered in a November-December 2023 storyline after being abandoned by his previous owner and saved by Earl, Mooch, Ozzie, Doozy and her mother. Doozy adopted Guard Dog who was renamed Sparky, McDonnell&#x27;s homage to Charles M. Schulz.

==Recurring storylines==
From time to time there are special sets of daily comic strips. Some, such as Shelter Stories (which focus on animals in shelters), serve to remind readers about one of the key beliefs that MUTTS holds dear: compassion for all animals. Others, such as Animal Idol (a parody of &quot;American Idol&quot;), are an homage to various pop culture references. One set of strips was a nod to &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, featuring Mooch as the Dude, with different characters quoting lines from other characters from the film.

Other storylines are set around the time of year. Each summer, Earl, Mooch, and their families visit the Jersey Shore, where they are joined by Crabby, Mussels Marinara, and McGarry. Mooch often finds himself hosting the MUTTS Book Club in the fall, where he sits on a rock and reads books to Chippy and Monk. In the winter, Mooch and Earl often try to hibernate for the season. Around holidays such as Valentine&#x27;s Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas and during the change from one season to the next, the characters are often featured alongside a famous and poignant quote. On Groundhog Day, Lamont talks to Earl and Mooch about seeing his shadow or not. And during Farm Animal Awareness Week, Earl and Mooch often visit a farm animal sanctuary.

Additionally, there are recurring storylines that are not timebound. For instance, from time to time, Mooch drapes a towel over his head and delivers oracles or answers to the chipmunks&#x27; questions as The Shphinx. In other strips, Mooch dons a wizard&#x27;s hat and performs magic, often including seeing the future or time traveling. Squirrels Bip and Bop embark on their campaign of bonking ground-dwellers&#x27; heads with nuts. Mooch can be found playing with his beloved Little Pink Sock. Every so often, the characters will encounter lifelike drawings of animals, often when they travel in their dreams to distant locations. Occasionally, Mooch can be seen driving Doozy&#x27;s electric car.

==Animal welfare and animal rights==

On occasion, McDonnell devotes the strip for a week or more to animal welfare issues, especially the adoption of pets from animal shelters. Themes include Farm Animal Awareness Week and Shelter Stories, where pet adoption as well as pet shelter life is the key focus. In the sixth episode of &quot;Shelter Me&quot;, a PBS series presented by the Petco Foundations, McDonnell visited Animal Care Centers of NYC to inspire a series of Shelter Stories to share with MUTTS readers. McDonnell has also produced several short animated public service announcements advocating animal adoption from shelters. One week included a reference to the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society.

McDonnell also created artwork for the second generation New Jersey Animal Friendly specialty license plate, first issued in 2001. A portion of the revenue from the plates goes to the New Jersey Department of Health&#x27;s Animal Population Control Program.

Additionally, McDonnell speaks out (usually using character Shtinky Puddin&#x27;) about numerous animal rights causes, including seal clubbing, whale hunting, and the cause closest to Shtinky&#x27;s hearts, saving the tigers. Additionally, McDonnell occasionally features Guard Dog, a tough-looking but tender-hearted dog who is chained in his yard. Supported by many animal welfare groups, Guard Dog serves as a symbol for all chained dogs, to remind people that no dog should have to live that way. McDonnell promised his readers that one day Guard Dog would be freed from his chains in the comic strip, though he already runs free in McDonnell&#x27;s sketchbooks. In November 2023, McDonnell wrote a storyline where Guard Dog&#x27;s owners move away without him, forcing the other characters to free him so can receive medical treatment. After being freed, Guard Dog is renamed Sparky.

Many strips over the years have been devoted to Dr. Jane Goodall and her numerous contributions to animal conservancy throughout her lifetime. Some feature quotes from Dr. Goodall, while others feature Shtinky and other MUTTS characters on their quest to meet, observe, and learn from Dr. Goodall.

==Sunday title panels==
Sunday strips are in color and their title panels are sometimes a tribute to a famous comic strip, a work of art, or another subject, including Flash #1, Dalí&#x27;s &quot;The Persistence of Memory,&quot; Elvis Presley, &quot;Trout Mask Replica,&quot; and Magritte&#x27;s &quot;Golconda&quot;.

==Setting==
&quot;MUTTS &quot;is set in New Jersey, where McDonnell grew up and still resides. The characters go down to the Jersey Shore each summer for vacation.

== &quot;The Gift of Nothing&quot; ==
Patrick McDonnell&#x27;s beloved picture book, &quot;The Gift of Nothing&quot;, features &quot;MUTTS &quot;characters Mooch, the cat, as he seeks the perfect gift for his dear friend Earl, the dog. Released in October 2005, the book quickly became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. In 2014, it was adapted as a musical for the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., where it won a Helen Hayes Award for Outstanding Play or Musical Adaptation. Then in 2016, it was adapted into a board book called &quot;The Little Gift of Nothing&quot;. The book also inspired The Gift of Nothing Day, a holiday that was first celebrated in December 2017 and is recognized yearly, around the world, on or around December 15. On Gift of Nothing Day, participants are encouraged to gift someone the experience of spending quality time together and sharing love with one another.

== &quot;Guardians of Being: Spiritual Teachings from Our Dogs and Cats&quot; ==
In 2009, the book &quot;Guardians of Being: Spiritual Teachings From Our Dogs and Cats&quot; was released, written by Eckhart Tolle and illustrated by Patrick McDonnell. The book features images of MUTTS characters joined with quotes and insights from Eckhart Tolle. The book aims to teach readers to find inner peace by living in the now, just as our companion animals do, to transform our consciousness and arise as more enlightened versions of ourselves. It highlights that while we humans are lost in our thoughts and the busy nature of everyday life, our pets become the key to the present moment — our guardians of being.

== &quot;Darling, I Love You: Poems from the Hearts of Our Glorious Mutts and All Our Animal Friends&quot; ==
The book &quot;Darling, I Love You: Poems from the Hearts of Our Glorious Mutts and All Our Animal Friends&quot; is a collection of poetry from Daniel Ladinsky paired with illustrations from Patrick McDonnell. This book, released in 2017 honors the special bond between animals and their human companions. McDonnell happened upon Ladinsky&#x27;s work in a bookstore and was inspired to illustrate a selection of poems. McDonnell sent some examples to Ladinsky and the pair decided to collaborate on the book, in which Ladinsky wrote new poems based on the MUTTS characters in addition to his other works.

==Cancelled film==
In July 2011, it was reported that 20th Century Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios were developing a feature-length animated film based on the &quot;MUTTS&quot; comic. Patrick McDonnell and his brother Robert McDonnell were hired to write the script, while Patrick would also executive produce. In late 2014, Patrick delivered the final draft of the film script, which was then, according to him, on a drawing board. Blue Sky was closed in April 2021, ending development on the film.

<doc id="160097" wikidata="Q1865791" url="?curid=160097" title="Little Orphan Annie">
<text>Little Orphan Annie was a daily American comic strip created by Harold Gray and syndicated by the Tribune Media Services. The strip took its name from the 1885 poem &quot;Little Orphant Annie&quot; by James Whitcomb Riley, and it made its debut on August 5, 1924, in the New York &quot;Daily News&quot;.

The plot followed the wide-ranging adventures of Annie, her dog Sandy and her benefactor Oliver &quot;Daddy&quot; Warbucks. Secondary characters include Punjab, the Asp and Mr. Am. The strip attracted adult readers with political commentary that targeted (among other things) organized labor, the New Deal and communism.

Following Gray&#x27;s death in 1968, several artists drew the strip and, for a time, &quot;classic&quot; strips were rerun. &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; inspired a radio show in 1930, film adaptations by RKO in 1932 and Paramount in 1938 and a Broadway musical &quot;Annie&quot; in 1977 (which was adapted on screen four times, once in 1982, once on TV in 1999, once in 2014, and a live TV production in 2021). The strip&#x27;s popularity declined over the years; it was running in only 20 newspapers when it ended on June 13, 2010. The characters now appear occasionally as supporting cast in &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;.

==Story==
&quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; displays literary kinship with the picaresque novel in its seemingly endless string of episodic and unrelated adventures in the life of a character who wanders like an innocent vagabond through a corrupt world. In Annie&#x27;s first year, the picaresque pattern that characterizes her story is set, with the major players – Annie, Sandy and &quot;Daddy&quot; Warbucks – introduced within the strip&#x27;s first several weeks.

The story opens in a dreary and Dickensian orphanage where Annie is routinely abused by the cold and sarcastic matron Miss Asthma, who eventually is replaced by the equally mean Miss Treat (whose name is a play on the word &quot;mistreat&quot;).

One day, the wealthy but mean-spirited Mrs. Warbucks takes Annie into her home &quot;on trial&quot;. She makes it clear that she does not like Annie and tries to send her back to &quot;the Home&quot;, but one of her society friends catches her in the act, and immediately, to her disgust, she changes her mind.

Her husband Oliver, who returned from a business trip, instantly develops a paternal affection for Annie and instructs her to address him as &quot;Daddy&quot;. Originally, the Warbucks had a dog named One-Lung, who liked Annie. Their household staff also takes to Annie and they like her.

However, the staff despises Mrs. Warbucks, the daughter of a &quot;nouveau riche&quot; plumber&#x27;s assistant. Cold-hearted Mrs. Warbucks sends Annie back to &quot;the Home&quot; numerous times, and the staff hates her for that. &quot;Daddy&quot; (Oliver) keeps thinking of her as his daughter. Mrs. Warbucks often argues with Oliver over how much he &quot;mortifies her when company comes&quot; and his affection for Annie. A very status-conscious woman, she feels that Oliver and Annie are ruining her socially. However, Oliver usually is able to put her in her place, especially when she criticizes Annie.

==Story formulas==

The strip developed a series of formulas that ran over its course to facilitate a wide range of stories. The earlier strips relied on a formula by which Daddy Warbucks is called away on business and through a variety of contrivances, Annie is cast out of the Warbucks mansion, usually by her enemy, the nasty Mrs. Warbucks. Annie then wanders the countryside and has adventures meeting and helping new people in their daily struggles. Early stories dealt with political corruption, criminal gangs and corrupt institutions, which Annie would confront. Annie ultimately would encounter troubles with the villain, who would be vanquished by the returning Daddy Warbucks. Annie and Daddy would then be reunited, at which point, after several weeks, the formula would play out again. In the series, each strip represented a single day in the life of the characters. This device was dropped by the end of the &#x27;20s.

By the 1930s, during the Great Depression, the formula was tweaked: Daddy Warbucks lost his fortune due to a corrupt rival and briefly died from despair at the 1944 re-election of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Annie remained an orphan, and for several years had adventures that involved more internationally based enemies. The contemporary events taking place in Europe were reflected in the strips during the 1940s and World War II. Daddy Warbucks was reunited with Annie, as his death was retconned to coma, from which he woke in 1945, coinciding with Roosevelt&#x27;s real-world death.

By this time, the series enlarged its world with the addition of characters such as Asp and Punjab, bodyguards and servants to Annie and Daddy Warbucks. They traveled the world, with Annie having adventures on her own or with her adopted family.

==Characters==

Annie is a ten-year-old orphan. Her distinguishing physical characteristics are curly red hair, a red dress and vacant circles for eyes. Her catchphrases are &quot;Gee whiskers&quot; and &quot;Leapin&#x27; lizards!&quot; In the comic, Annie attributes her lasting youthfulness to her birthday being on February 29 in a leap year, and ages only one year in appearance for every four years that pass. Annie is a plucky, generous, compassionate, and optimistic youngster who can hold her own against bullies, and has a strong and intuitive sense of right and wrong.

Sandy enters the story in a January 1925 strip as a puppy of no particular breed which Annie rescues from a gang of abusive boys. The girl is working as a drudge in Mrs. Bottle&#x27;s grocery store at the time and manages to keep the puppy briefly concealed. She finally gives him to Paddy Lynch, a gentle man who owns a &quot;steak joint&quot; and can give Sandy a good home. Sandy is a mature dog when he suddenly reappears in a May 1925 strip to rescue Annie from gypsy kidnappers. Annie and Sandy remain together thereafter.

Oliver &quot;Daddy&quot; Warbucks first appears in a September 1924 strip and reveals a month later he was formerly a small machine shop owner who acquired his enormous wealth producing munitions during World War I. He is a large, powerfully-built bald man, the idealized capitalist, who typically wears a tuxedo and diamond stickpin in his shirtfront. He likes Annie at once, instructing her to call him &quot;Daddy&quot;, but his wife (the daughter of a plumber&#x27;s assistant) is a snobbish, gossiping &quot;nouveau riche&quot; who derides her husband&#x27;s affection for Annie. When Warbucks is suddenly called to Siberia on business, his wife spitefully sends Annie back to the orphanage.

Other major characters include Warbucks&#x27; right-hand men: Punjab, an eight-foot native of India, introduced in 1935, and the Asp, an inscrutably generalized East Asian, who first appeared in 1937. Also introduced in 1937 was the mysterious Mr. Am, a bearded sage millions of years old, whose supernatural powers include bringing the dead back to life.

==Publication history==

After World War I, cartoonist Harold Gray joined the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; which, at that time, was being reworked by owner Joseph Medill Patterson into an important national journal. As part of his plan, Patterson wanted to publish comic strips that would lend themselves to nationwide syndication and to film and radio adaptations. Gray&#x27;s strips were consistently rejected by Patterson, but &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; was finally accepted and debuted in a test run on August 5, 1924, in the New York &quot;Daily News&quot;, a &quot;Tribune&quot;-owned tabloid. Reader response was positive, and &quot;Annie&quot; began appearing as a Sunday strip in the &quot;Tribune&quot; on November 2 and as a daily strip on November 10. It was soon offered for syndication and picked up by the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; and &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot;.

Gray reported in 1952 that Annie&#x27;s origin lay in a chance meeting he had with a ragamuffin while wandering the streets of Chicago looking for cartooning ideas. &quot;I talked to this little kid and liked her right away&quot;, Gray said. &quot;She had common sense, knew how to take care of herself. She had to. Her name was Annie. At the time some 40 strips were using boys as the main characters; only three were using girls. I chose Annie for mine, and made her an orphan, so she&#x27;d have no family, no tangling alliances, but freedom to go where she pleased.&quot; By changing the gender of his lead character, Gray differentiated himself in the field of comics (and likely increased his readership by appealing to female readers). In designing the strip, Gray was influenced by his midwestern farm boyhood, Victorian poetry and novels such as Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, Sidney Smith&#x27;s wildly popular comic strip &quot;The Gumps&quot;, and the histrionics of the silent films and melodramas of the period. Initially, there was no continuity between the dailies and the Sunday strips, but by the early 1930s the two had become one. The strip (whose title was borrowed from James Whitcomb Riley&#x27;s 1885 poem &quot;Little Orphant Annie&quot;) was &quot;conservative and topical&quot;, according to the editors of &quot;The Great Depression in America: A Cultural Encyclopedia&quot;, and &quot;represents the personal vision&quot; of Gray and Riley&#x27;s &quot;homespun philosophy of hard work, respect for elders, and a cheerful outlook on life&quot;. A &quot;Fortune&quot; popularity poll in 1937 indicated &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; ranked number one and ahead of &quot;Popeye&quot;, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot;, &quot;The Gumps&quot;, &quot;Blondie&quot;, &quot;Moon Mullins&quot;, &quot;Joe Palooka&quot;, &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; and &quot;Tillie the Toiler&quot;.

===1929 to World War II===
Gray was little affected by the stock market crash of 1929. The strip was more popular than ever and brought him a good income, which was only enhanced when the strip became the basis for a radio program in 1930 and two films in 1932 and 1938. Unsurprisingly, Gray was mocked by some for his strip&#x27;s lecturing to the poor on hard work, initiative, and motivation, while still enjoying his successful lifestyle.

Starting January 4, 1931, Gray added a topper strip to the &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; Sunday page called &quot;Private Life Of...&quot; The strip chose a common object each week like potatoes, hats and baseballs, and told their &quot;stories&quot;. That idea ran for two years, ending on Christmas Day, 1932. A new three-panel gag strip about an elderly lady, &quot;Maw Green&quot;, began on January 1, 1933, and ran along the bottom of the Sunday page until 1973.

In 1935, Punjab, a gigantic, sword-wielding, beturbaned Indian, was introduced to the strip and became one of its iconic characters. Whereas Annie&#x27;s adventures up to the point of Punjab&#x27;s appearance were realistic and believable, her adventures following his introduction touched upon the supernatural, the cosmic, and the fantastic.

In November 1932, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected president and proposed his New Deal. Many, including Gray, saw this and other programs as government interference in private enterprise. Gray railed against Roosevelt and his programs. (Gray even seemingly killed Daddy Warbucks off in 1944, but following FDR&#x27;s death in 1945, Gray brought back Warbucks, who said to Annie, &quot;Somehow I feel that the climate here has changed since I went away&quot;, suggesting that Warbucks could not coexist in the world with FDR.) Annie&#x27;s life was complicated not only by thugs and gangsters but also by New Deal do-gooders and bureaucrats. Organized labor was feared by businessmen and Gray took the businessmen&#x27;s side. Some writers and editors took issue with this strip&#x27;s criticisms of FDR&#x27;s New Deal and 1930s labor unionism. &quot;The New Republic&quot; described &quot;Annie&quot; as &quot;Hooverism in the Funnies&quot;, arguing that Gray&#x27;s strip was defending utility company bosses then being investigated by the government. The &quot;Herald Dispatch&quot; of Huntington, West Virginia, stopped running &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;, printing a front-page editorial rebuking Gray&#x27;s politics. A subsequent &quot;New Republic&quot; editorial praised the paper&#x27;s move, and &quot;The Nation&quot; likewise voiced its support.

In the late 1920s, the strip had taken on a more adult and adventurous feel with Annie encountering killers, gangsters, spies, and saboteurs. It was about this time that Gray, whose politics seem to have been broadly conservative and libertarian with a decided populist streak, introduced some of his more controversial storylines. He would look into the darker aspects of human nature, such as greed and treachery. The gap between rich and poor was an important theme. His hostility toward labor unions was dramatized in the 1935 story &quot;Eonite&quot;. Other targets were the New Deal, communism, and corrupt businessmen.

Gray was especially critical of the justice system, which he saw as not doing enough to deal with criminals. Thus, some of his storylines featured people taking the law into their own hands. This happened as early as 1927 in an adventure named &quot;The Haunted House&quot;. Annie is kidnapped by a gangster called Mister Mack. Warbucks rescues her and takes Mack and his gang into custody. He then contacts a local Senator who owes him a favor. Warbucks persuades the politician to use his influence with the judge and make sure that the trial goes their way and that Mack and his men get their just deserts. Annie questions the use of such methods but concludes it is necessary to counteract criminals manipulating the justice system in their own way.

Warbucks became much more ruthless in later years. After catching yet another gang of Annie kidnappers, he announced that he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t think of troubling the police with you boys&quot;, implying that while he and Annie celebrated their reunion, the Asp and his men took the kidnappers away to be lynched. In another Sunday strip, published during World War II, a war-profiteer expresses the hope that the conflict would last another 20 years. An outraged member of the public physically assaults the man for his opinion, claiming revenge for his two sons who have already been killed in the fighting. When a passing policeman is about to intervene, Annie talks him out of it, suggesting, &quot;It&#x27;s better some times to let folks settle some questions by what you might call &quot;democratic&quot; processes.&quot;

===World War II and Annie&#x27;s Junior Commandos===
As war clouds gathered, both the Chicago &quot;Tribune&quot; and the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; advocated neutrality; &quot;Daddy&quot; Warbucks, however, was gleefully manufacturing tanks, planes, and munitions. Journalist James Edward Vlamos deplored the loss of fantasy, innocence, and humor in the &quot;funnies&quot;, and took to task one of Gray&#x27;s sequences about espionage, noting that the &quot;fate of the nation&quot; rested on &quot;Annie&#x27;s frail shoulders&quot;. Vlamos advised readers to &quot;Stick to the saner world of war and horror on the front pages.&quot;

When the US entered World War II, Annie not only played her part by blowing up a German submarine but organized and led groups of children called the Junior Commandos in the collection of newspapers, scrap metal, and other recyclable materials for the war effort. Annie herself wore an armband emblazoned with &quot;JC&quot; and called herself &quot;Colonel Annie&quot;. In real life, the idea caught on, and schools and parents were encouraged to organize similar groups. Twenty thousand Junior Commandos were reportedly registered in Boston.

Gray was praised far and wide for his war effort brainchild. &quot;Editor &amp; Publisher&quot; wrote,

Harold Gray, &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; creator, has done one of the biggest jobs to date for the scrap drive. His &#x27;Junior Commando&#x27; project, which he inaugurated some months ago, has caught on all around the country, and tons of scrap have been collected and contributed to the campaign. The kids sell the scrap, and the proceeds are turned into stamps and bonds.

Not all was rosy for Gray, however. His application for extra gas coupons was denied by the Office of Price Administration, as cartoonists were not deemed essential to the war effort. Gray appealed, but the decision was upheld. Furious, Gray used the strip to criticize the government&#x27;s decision as well as the clerk who made the original denial, whom he thinly caricatured in the strip. This storyline was controversial, with both sides garnering criticism in local papers. The clerk eventually threatened to sue for libel, and some papers cancelled the strip. Gray showed no remorse, but did discontinue the sequence.

Gray was criticized by a Southern newspaper for including a black child among the white children in the Junior Commandos. In his reply, Gray denied being a reformer, but pointed out that Annie was a friend to all, and his inclusion of a black character, was &quot;merely a casual gesture toward a very large block of readers.&quot; African-American readers wrote letters to Gray thanking him for the incorporation of a black child in the strip, although no record survives of any replies from Gray.

In the summer of 1944, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whom Gray despised, was nominated for a fourth term as President of the United States. Gray responded with a dramatic month-long storyline that ended with Warbucks dying of a jungle fever. Readers were generally unhappy with Gray&#x27;s decision to kill off the character, although one New York Man wrote to suggest that Annie also be killed off and the strip ended.

By the following November, Annie was working as a maid in an abusive home. The public begged Gray to have mercy on Annie; instead, he had her framed for her mistress&#x27;s murder, though she was later exonerated. Following Roosevelt&#x27;s death in April 1945, Gray resurrected Warbucks with the explanation that he had only been playing dead to thwart his enemies, and once again the billionaire began expounding the joys of capitalism.

===Post-war years===
In the post-war years, Annie took on The Bomb, communism, teenage rebellion and a host of other social and political concerns, often provoking the enmity of clergymen, union leaders and others. For example, Gray believed children should be allowed to work. &quot;A little work never hurt any kid,&quot; Gray stated, &quot;One of the reasons we have so much juvenile delinquency is that kids are forced by law to loaf around on street corners and get into trouble.&quot; His belief brought upon him the wrath of the labor movement, which staunchly supported the child labor laws.

A London newspaper columnist thought some of Gray&#x27;s sequences a threat to world peace, but a Detroit newspaper supported Gray on his &quot;shoot first, ask questions later&quot; foreign policy. Gray was criticized for the gruesome violence in the strips, particularly a sequence in which Annie and Sandy were run over by a car. Gray responded to the criticism by giving Annie a year-long bout with amnesia that allowed her to trip through several adventures without Daddy. In 1956, a sequence about juvenile delinquency, drug addiction, switchblades, prostitutes, crooked cops, and the ties between teens and adult gangsters unleashed a firestorm of criticism; 30 newspapers cancelled the strip. The syndicate ordered Gray to drop the sequence and develop another adventure.

===Gray&#x27;s death===
Gray died in May 1968 of cancer, and the strip was continued under other cartoonists. Gray&#x27;s cousin and assistant Robert Leffingwell was the first on the job but proved inadequate and the strip was handed over to &quot;Tribune&quot; staff artist Henry Arnold and general manager Henry Raduta as the search continued for a permanent replacement. Tex Blaisdell, an experienced comics artist, got the job with Elliot Caplin as writer. Caplin avoided political themes and concentrated instead on character stories. The two worked together six years on the strip, but subscriptions fell off and both left at the end of 1973. The strip was passed to others and during this time complaints were registered regarding Annie&#x27;s appearance, her conservative politics, and her lack of spunk. Early in 1974, David Lettick took the strip, but his Annie was drawn in an entirely different and more &quot;cartoonish&quot; style, leading to reader complaints, and he left after only three months. In April 1974, the decision was made to reprint Gray&#x27;s classic strips, beginning in 1936. Subscriptions increased. The reprints ran from April 22, 1974, to December 8, 1979.

Following the success of the Broadway musical &quot;Annie&quot;, the strip was resurrected on December 9, 1979, as &quot;Annie&quot;, written and drawn by Leonard Starr. Starr, the creator of &quot;Mary Perkins, On Stage&quot;, was the only one besides Gray to achieve notable success with the strip.

Starr&#x27;s last strip ran on February 20, 2000, and the strip went into reprints again for several months. Starr was succeeded by &quot;Daily News&quot; writer Jay Maeder and artist Andrew Pepoy, beginning Monday, June 5, 2000. Pepoy was eventually succeeded by Alan Kupperberg (April 1, 2001 – July 11, 2004) and Ted Slampyak (July 5, 2004 – June 13, 2010). The new creators updated the strip&#x27;s settings and characters for a modern audience, giving Annie a new hairdo and jeans rather than her trademark dress. However, Maeder&#x27;s new stories never managed to live up to the pathos and emotional engagement of the stories by Gray and Starr. Annie herself was often reduced to a supporting role, and she was a far less complex character than the girl readers had known for seven decades. Maeder&#x27;s writing style also tended to make the stories feel like tongue-in-cheek adventures compared to the serious, heartfelt tales Gray and Starr favored. &quot;Annie&quot; gradually lost subscribers during the 2000s, and, by 2010, it was running in fewer than 20 U.S. newspapers.

===Cancellation===
On May 13, 2010, Tribune Media Services announced that the strip&#x27;s final installment would appear on Sunday, June 13, 2010, ending after 86 years. At the time of the cancellation announcement, it was running in fewer than 20 newspapers, some of which, such as the New York &quot;Daily News&quot;, had carried the strip for its entire life. The final cartoonist, Ted Slampyak, said, &quot;It&#x27;s kind of painful. It&#x27;s almost like mourning the loss of a friend.&quot;

The last strip was the culmination of a story arc where Annie was kidnapped from her hotel by a wanted war criminal from eastern Europe who checked in under a phony name with a fake passport. Although Warbucks enlists the help of the FBI and Interpol to find her, by the end of the final strip he has begun to resign himself to the very strong possibility that Annie most likely will not be found alive. Unfortunately, Warbucks is unaware that Annie is still alive and has made her way to Guatemala with her captor, known simply as the &quot;Butcher of the Balkans&quot;. Although Annie wants to be let go, the Butcher tells her that he neither will let her go nor kill her—for fear of being captured and because he will not kill a child despite his many political killings—and adds that she has a new life now with him. The final panel of the strip reads &quot;And this is where we leave our Annie. For Now—&quot;.

Since the cancellation, rerun strips have been running on the GoComics site.

===Final resolution: Warbucks calls on Dick Tracy===
In 2013, the team behind &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; began a story line that would permanently resolve the fate of Annie. The week of June 10, 2013, featured several &quot;Annie&quot; characters in extended cameos complete with dialogue, including Warbucks, the Asp and Punjab. On June 16, Warbucks implies that Annie is still missing and that he might even enlist Tracy&#x27;s help in finding her. Asp and Punjab appeared again on March 26, 2014. The caption says that these events will soon impact on the detective.

The storyline resumed on June 8, 2014, with Warbucks asking for Tracy&#x27;s assistance in finding Annie. In the course of the story, Tracy receives a letter from Annie and determines her location. Meanwhile, the name of the kidnapper is revealed as Henrik Wilemse, and he has been tracked to the city where he is found and made to disappear. Tracy and Warbucks rescued Annie, and the storyline wrapped up on October 12.

Annie again visited Dick Tracy, visiting his granddaughter Honeymoon Tracy, starting June 6, 2015. This arc concluded September 26, 2015 with Dick Tracy sending the girls home from a crime scene to keep them out of the news.

A third appearance of Annie and her supporting cast in Dick Tracy&#x27;s strip began on May 16, 2019, and involves both B-B Eyes&#x27; murder and doubts about the fate of Trixie. The arc also establishes that Warbucks has &quot;formally&quot; adopted Annie, as opposed to being just his ward.

==Adaptations==

===Radio===
&quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; was adapted to a 15-minute radio show that debuted on WGN Chicago in 1930 and went national on NBC&#x27;s Blue Network beginning April 6, 1931. The show was one of the first comic strips adapted to radio, attracted about 6 million fans, and left the air in 1942. Radio historian Jim Harmon attributes the show&#x27;s popularity in &quot;The Great Radio Heroes&quot; to the fact that it was the only radio show to deal with and appeal to young children.
===1930s films based on the comic strip===
Two film adaptations were released at the height of Annie&#x27;s popularity in the 1930s. &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;, the first adaptation, was produced by David O. Selznick for RKO in 1932 and starred Mitzi Green as Annie. The plot was simple: Warbucks leaves on business and Annie finds herself in the orphanage again. She pals around with a little boy named Mickey, and when he is adopted by a wealthy woman, she visits him in his new home. Warbucks returns and holds a Christmas party for all. The film opened on Christmas Eve 1932. &quot;Variety&quot; panned it, and the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; was &quot;slightly disappointed&quot; with the film, thinking Green too &quot;big and buxom&quot; for the role. Paramount brought Ann Gillis to the role of Annie in their 1938 film adaptation, but this version was panned as well. One reviewer thought it &quot;stupid and thoroughly boresome&quot; and was uncomfortable with the &quot;sugar-coated Pollyanna characterization&quot; given Annie.

Three years after the RKO release, Gray wrote a sequence for the strip that sent Annie to Hollywood. She is hired at low wages to play the stand-in and stunt double for the bratty child star Tootsie McSnoots. Young starlet Janey Spangles tips off Annie to the corrupt practices in Hollywood. Annie handles the information with maturity and has a good time with Janey while doing her job on the set. Annie doesn&#x27;t become a star. As Bruce Smith remarks in &quot;The History of Little Orphan Annie&quot;, &quot;Gray was smart enough never to let [Annie] get too successful.&quot;

===Broadway===

In 1977, &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; was adapted to the Broadway stage as &quot;Annie&quot;. With music by Charles Strouse, lyrics by Martin Charnin and book by Thomas Meehan, the original production ran from April 21, 1977, to January 2, 1983. The work has been staged internationally. The musical took considerable liberties with the original comic strip plot, the least of which being Oliver Warbucks supporting President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s agenda.

The Broadway Annies were Andrea McArdle, Shelly Bruce, Sarah Jessica Parker, Allison Smith and Alyson Kirk. Actresses who portrayed Miss Hannigan are Dorothy Loudon, Alice Ghostley, Betty Hutton, Ruth Kobart, Marcia Lewis, June Havoc, Nell Carter and Sally Struthers. Songs from the musical include &quot;Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s the Hard Knock Life&quot;. There is also a children&#x27;s version of &quot;Annie&quot; called &quot;Annie Junior&quot;. Two sequels to the musical, &quot;Annie 2: Miss Hannigan&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (1989) and &quot;Annie Warbucks&quot; (1992-93), were written by the same creative team; neither show opened on Broadway. There were also many &quot;bus &amp; truck&quot; tours of &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; throughout the United States during the success of the Broadway Shows.

===Film adaptations of the Broadway musical===
In addition to the two &quot;Annie&quot; films of the 1930s, there have been three film adaptations of the Broadway play. All have the same title. They are &quot;Annie&quot; (1982), &quot;Annie &quot;(1999, a made-for-television adaptation) and &quot;Annie&quot; (2014).

The 1982 version was directed by John Huston and starred Aileen Quinn as Annie, Albert Finney as Warbucks, Ann Reinking as his secretary Grace Farrell, and Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan. The film departed from the Broadway production in several respects, most notably changing the climax of the story from Christmas to the Fourth of July. It also featured five new songs, &quot;Dumb Dog&quot;, &quot;Sandy&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to the Movies&quot;, &quot;Sign&quot;, and &quot;We Got Annie&quot;, while cutting &quot;We&#x27;d like to Thank You, Herbert Hoover&quot;, &quot;N.Y.C&quot;, &quot;You Won&#x27;t Be an Orphan for Long&quot;, &quot;Something Was Missing&quot;, &quot;Annie&quot;, and &quot;New Deal for Christmas&quot;. It received mixed critical reviews and, while becoming the 10th highest-grossing film of 1982, barely recouped its $50 million budget.

A direct-to-video film, &quot;&quot; was released in 1996 as a sequel to the 1982 film. It features Ashley Johnson as Annie and focuses on the adventures of Annie and her friends Hannah and Molly. It is set in England in 1943, about 10 years after the first film, when Annie and her friends Hannah and Molly sail to England after Daddy Warbucks is invited to receive a knighthood. None of the original 1982 cast appear and the film features no musical numbers apart from a reprise of &quot;Tomorrow&quot;.

The animated &quot;Little Orphan Annie&#x27;s A Very Animated Christmas&quot; was produced as a direct-to-video film in 1995.

The 1999 television film was produced for &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;. It starred Victor Garber, Alan Cumming, Audra McDonald and Kristin Chenoweth, with Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Miss Hannigan and newcomer Alicia Morton as Annie. While its plot stuck closer to the original Broadway production, it also omitted &quot;We&#x27;d Like to Thank You, Herbert Hoover&quot;, &quot;Annie&quot;, &quot;New Deal for Christmas&quot;, and a reprise of &quot;Tomorrow.&quot; Generally favorably received, the production earned two Emmy Awards and George Foster Peabody Award.

The 2014 film &quot;Annie&quot; was produced by Jay-Z and Will Smith. It starred Quvenzhané Wallis in the title role and Jamie Foxx in the role of Will Stacks (a role similar to Warbucks). The film follows the basic plot of the musical but is set in the present day and features new songs along re-mixed versions of older ones. It was released on December 19, 2014.

==Parodies, imitations and cultural citations==
The characters and concept of &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; have been influential in comics and other media during the original run and continuing into the modern day. Between 1936 and October 17, 1959, the comic strip &quot;Belinda Blue-Eyes&quot; (later shortened to &quot;Belinda&quot;) ran in the United Kingdom in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. Writers Bill Connor and Don Freeman and artists Stephen Dowling and Tony Royle all worked on the strip over the years. In &quot;The Penguin Book of Comics&quot; Belinda is described as &quot;a perpetual waif, a British counterpart to the transatlantic &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;.&quot; The strip also influenced &quot;Little Annie Rooney&quot; (Jan. 10, 1927–1966) and &quot;Frankie Doodle&quot; (1934-1938).

In 1995, &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; was one of 20 American comic strips included in the Comic Strip Classics series of commemorative U.S. postage stamps. Rapper Jay-Z has referenced &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; in at least two of his songs, as well as sampling &quot;It&#x27;s the Hard Knock Life&quot; for &quot;Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)&quot; (1998). On the album cover of punk rock cover band Me First and the Gimme Gimmes&#x27; 1999 album &quot;Are a Drag&quot;, rhythm guitarist and Lagwagon vocalist Joey Cape is dressed as Annie, as she was depicted in the 1982 film. Starting in 2014, red-haired comedian Michelle Wolf appeared on numerous segments on &quot;Late Night&quot; as her fictional persona, &quot;Grown-Up Annie&quot;, an adult version of Little Orphan Annie.

In medicine, &quot;Orphan Annie eye&quot; (empty or &quot;ground glass&quot;) nuclei are a characteristic histological finding in papillary carcinoma of the thyroid gland.

Many comics, cartoons, TV shows and other media have parodied or referenced the name &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;. Early examples &quot;Little Arf &#x27;n Nonnie&quot; and &quot;Lulu Arfin&#x27; Nanny&quot; appear in the Walt Kelly strip &quot;Pogo&quot;. &quot;Little Orphan Melvin&quot; appears in the ninth issue of &quot;Mad&quot; magazine by Harvey Kurtzman and Wally Wood, published 1952. Kurtzman later produced a long-running erotic comic for &quot;Playboy&quot; called &quot;Little Annie Fanny.&quot; In &quot;The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers&quot;, Gilbert Shelton satirized the strip as &quot;Little Orphan Amphetamine&quot;. 1980s children&#x27;s program &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot; parodied the character as &quot;Little Orphan Andrea&quot; in its &quot;Adoption&quot; episode, later banned. The &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; comics by Mirage Studios feature a fictional toy line named &quot;Little Orphan Aliens&quot;.

==Archives==
Harold Gray&#x27;s work is in the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University. The Gray collection includes artwork, printed material, correspondence, manuscripts and photographs.

* Between 1926 and 1934, Cupples &amp; Leon published nine collections of Annie strips:
# Little Orphan Annie (1925 strips, reprinted by Dover and Pacific Comics Club)
# In the Circus (1926 strips, reprinted by Pacific Comics Club)

* &quot;Arf: The Life and Hard Times of Little Orphan Annie&quot; (1970): reprints approximately half the daily strips from 1935 to 1945. However, many of the storylines are edited and shortened, with gaps of several months between some strips.
* Dover Publications reprinted two of the Cupples &amp; Leon books and an original collection &quot;Little Orphan Annie in the Great Depression&quot; which contains all the daily strips from January to September, 1931.
* Pacific Comics Club has reprinted eight of the Cupples &amp; Leon books. They have also published a new series of reprints, with complete runs of daily strip, in the same format at the C&amp;L books, covering some of the daily strips from 1925 to 29:
# The Sentence, 1925 strips
# The Dreamer, strips from January 22, 1926, to April 30, 1926
# Daddy, strips from September 6, 1926, to December 4, 1926.
# The Hobo, strips from December 6, 1926, to March 5, 1927.

<text>Patrick McDonnell (born March 17, 1956) is a cartoonist, author, and playwright. He is the creator of the daily comic strip &quot;Mutts&quot;, which follows the adventures of a dog and a cat, that has been syndicated since 1994. Prior to creating &quot;Mutts&quot;, he was a prolific magazine illustrator, and would frequently include a dog in the backgrounds of his drawings. 

McDonnell&#x27;s picture book, &quot;The Gift of Nothing&quot;, was adapted as a musical for the Kennedy Center stage, as was his picture book about the childhood of Jane Goodall, &quot;Me . . . Jane&quot;, which won a Caldecott Honor in 2012. His work has been animated for television commercials, most notably a public service announcement for the NY Philharmonic. He is a co-author of &quot;Krazy Kat: The Comic Art of George Herriman&quot;, published in 1986 by Abrams Books.

McDonnell is involved with many animal and environmental charities. His characters have been used by the United States Marines, the American Library Association, and by the Humane Society of the United States. The &quot;Mutts&quot; characters appear on the New Jersey Animal Friendly license plates, which fund state pet population programs.

He won the Harvey Award for Best Comic Strip eight times, and has been given four National Cartoonists Society Awards.

==Early life==
Patrick Luigi McDonnell was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, the son of an Irish father and an Italian-American mother. Early artistic influences were Charles M. Schulz, George Herriman, and E. C. Segar. McDonnell was raised in Edison, New Jersey and, after graduating from Edison High School in 1974, he attended the School of Visual Arts in New York on scholarship, graduating in 1978.

==Career==
At SVA, McDonnell met a group of underground cartoonists, such as Peter Bagge and Kazimieras G. Prapuolenis (Kaz). Moving to Hoboken, New Jersey, shortly after graduating, McDonnell had some of his earliest professional drawings published in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, and as &quot;Jerseyana&quot; in &quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine. His first high-profile ongoing freelance work was providing illustrations for the Russell Baker &quot;Observer&quot; column for &quot;The New York Times Sunday Magazine&quot; from 1978 to 1993. His work on the &quot;Observer&quot; column got McDonnell interested in the idea of eventually doing a comic strip.

McDonnell created a monthly comic strip, &quot;Bad Baby&quot;, for &quot;Parents Magazine&quot;, which ran for ten years. The &quot;Bad Baby&quot; strips were collected and published by Ballantine Books in 1988. &quot;Bad Baby&quot; was adapted into an animated TV movie in 1997. During that time he also was a regular contributor to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, and many other national magazines. McDonnell&#x27;s illustrations for magazines, books, and greeting cards earned him two National Cartoonists Society Awards in 1991.

&quot;Mutts&quot; became syndicated, distributed by King Features Syndicate, starting in 1994. It won the Harvey Award for Best Comic Strip in 1997, 1999, 2001, 2002, and 2003. &quot;Peanuts&quot; creator Charles M. Schulz said of &quot;Mutts&quot;, &quot;To me, MUTTS is exactly what a comic strip should be.&quot; A book of McDonnell&#x27;s life and work, &quot;Mutts: The Comic Art of Patrick McDonnell&quot;, was published in 2003 by Abrams Books.

In 2005, McDonnell curated an exhibition — &quot;Top Dogs: Comic Canines Before and After Snoopy&quot; — at the Charles M. Schulz Museum in Santa Rosa, California. 

In 2006, the &quot;Mutts&quot; characters were featured in the United States Marines&#x27; Toys for Tots holiday poster, and in 2007 were part of the American Library Association&#x27;s &quot;Read!&quot; poster. The 2007-2008 Mazdaspeed Team featured &quot;Mutts&quot;-themed vehicles promoting pet adoption and the work of the Humane Society of the United States. He also created a set of &quot;humane postage stamps&quot; for the Humane Society. 

In 2009 McDonnell collaborated with author Eckhart Tolle to create &quot;Guardians of Being&quot;, a philosophical book about nature and the present moment. In 2011, McDonnell&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;Me... Jane&quot; was published. It is a story about naturalist Jane Goodall growing up and her awakening curiosity about the lives of animals around her. A sequence of &quot;Mutts&quot; strips led to Goodall&#x27;s interest in working with McDonnell on the book. &quot;Me... Jane&quot; won a Caldecott Honor in 2012. In 2010, the &quot;Mutts&quot; comic strip was appearing in more than 700 newspapers across 20 countries.

==Personal life==
McDonnell has been a vegetarian since around 1990 and a vegan since 2005. McDonnell is a member of the board of directors of the Humane Society of the United States, the Fund for Animals, and The Charles M. Schulz Museum. 

McDonnell and his wife Karen O&#x27;Connell — whom he met in the late 1970s while both members of the punk band Steel Tips — reside in Princeton, New Jersey, with their dog Amelie, and their cat, Willie Lebowsky. Their Jack Russell Terrier, Earl, who was the inspiration and constant muse for the &quot;Mutts&quot; character of the same name, died in November 2007 after living with McDonnell for over 18 years.

<doc id="160103" wikidata="Q1137794" url="?curid=160103" title="Gasoline Alley (comic strip)">
<text>Gasoline Alley is a comic strip created by Frank King and distributed by Tribune Content Agency. It centers on the lives of patriarch Walt Wallet, his family, and residents in the town of Gasoline Alley, with storylines reflecting traditional American values.

The strip debuted on November 24, 1918; , it is the longest-running current strip in the United States, and the second-longest running strip of all time in the United States, after &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot; (which ran for 109 years, 1897–2006). &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot; has received critical accolades for its influential innovations. In addition to new color and page design concepts, King introduced real-time continuity to comic strips by depicting his characters aging over generations.

==Early years==

The strip originated on the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;&#x27;s black-and-white Sunday page, &quot;The Rectangle&quot;, where staff artists contributed one-shot panels, continuing plots or themes. One corner of &quot;The Rectangle&quot; introduced King&#x27;s &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot;, where characters Walt, Doc, Avery, and Bill held weekly conversations about automobiles. This panel slowly gained recognition, and the daily comic strip began August 24, 1919, in the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;.

Some of the early characters were based on people Frank King knew. Skeezix was based on his son Robert Drew King. Walt was based on &quot;jolly&quot; overweight bachelor and Western Union traffic engineer Walter W. Drew, who had &quot;a wisp of unruly hair&quot;. Bill and Amy were based on locomotive engineer William D. Gannon and his wife Gertrude. Doc was based on Dr. Hughie Johnson.

==Skeezix arrives==
The early years were dominated by the character Walt Wallet. &quot;Tribune&quot; editor Joseph Patterson wanted to attract women to the strip by introducing a baby, but Walt was not married. That obstacle was avoided when Walt found a baby on his doorstep, as described by comics historian Don Markstein:


Skeezix called his adoptive father Uncle Walt. Unlike most comic strip children (like the Katzenjammer Kids or Little Orphan Annie), he did not remain a baby or even a little boy for long. He grew up to manhood, the first occasion where real time was shown continually elapsing in a major comic strip over generations. By the time the United States entered World War II, Skeezix was an adult, courting Nina Clock and enlisting in the armed forces in June 1942. He later married Nina and had children. In the late 1960s, he faced a typical midlife crisis. Walt Wallet himself married Phyllis Blossom on June 24, 1926, and had other children, who grew up and had kids of their own. During the 1970s and 1980s, under Dick Moores&#x27; authorship, the characters stopped aging. When Jim Scancarelli took over, natural aging was restored.

==Sunday strips==
The Sunday strip was launched October 24, 1920. The 1930s Sunday pages did not always employ traditional gags, but often offered a gentle view of nature, imaginary daydreaming with expressive art, or naturalistic views of small-town life. Reviewing Peter Maresca and Chris Ware&#x27;s &quot;Sundays with Walt and Skeezix&quot; (Sunday Press Books, 2007), comics critic Steve Duin quoted writer Jeet Heer:

The Sunday pages included several toppers over the course of the run: &quot;That Phoney Nickel&quot; (Dec 14, 1930 – Sept 17, 1933), &quot;Puny Puns&quot; (Feb 5 – Sept 17, 1933), &quot;Corky&quot; (Aug 18, 1935 – 1945), and &quot;Little Brother Hugo&quot; aka &quot;Wilmer&#x27;s Little Brother Hugo&quot; (January 30, 1944 – 1973).

==21st century ==
The strip is still published in newspapers in the 21st century. Walt Wallet is now well over a century old (124, as of February 2024), while Skeezix has become a centenarian. Walt&#x27;s wife Phyllis, age an estimated 105, died in the April 26, 2004, strip; Walt was left a widower after nearly eight decades of marriage. Walt Wallet appeared as a guest at Blondie and Dagwood&#x27;s anniversary party, and on &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot;&#x27;s 90th anniversary, &quot;Blondie&quot;, &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot;, &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, and &quot;Snuffy Smith&quot; each acknowledged the &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot; anniversary in their dialogue. &quot;Snuffy Smith&quot; presented a character crossover with Walt in the doorway of Snuffy&#x27;s house where he was being welcomed and invited in by Snuffy. In May 2013 at the cartoon retirement home, Walt is at a dinner when Maggie&#x27;s (of &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot;) pearl brooch is stolen; Fearless Fosdick is his usual incompetent self trying to catch the thief; cameos include such &quot;retired&quot; comics characters as Lil&#x27; Abner; Smokey Stover and Pogo and Albert. Even the active cartoon character Rex Morgan, M.D., appears.

==Characters==
===First-generation characters===
;Walt Wallet
:Full name Walter Weatherby Wallet. Patriarch of the family and veteran of World War I. For many years, he ran a successful furniture company, Wicker and Wallet. He has been retired for years.
;Phyllis Corkleigh Blossom Wallet
:Walt&#x27;s wife. Phyllis was widowed before marrying Walt; Corkleigh was her maiden name before Blossom was her married name. Phyllis and Walt married June 24, 1926. She died April 26, 2004.
;Avery
:Walt&#x27;s cranky neighbor, who drove an old car that started with a crank long after everyone else had bought a car with a starter. He died &quot;off-stage.&quot;
;Bill
:He also died &quot;off-stage&quot;.
;Doc
:He retired with a young woman on his arm, going off to a well-deserved retirement community. He died &quot;off-stage&quot;.
;Uriah Pert
:A rich and miserly man. He was long the villain of many stories. Since his death his reputation has been rehabilitated a little bit, and shown to have a better character than his nephew, Senator Bobble.

===Timeless characters===
These characters break the strip&#x27;s rule about aging with the calendar.
;Joel
:Trashman. He drives a wagon drawn by a mule named Betsy. His full name Joseph L. Smith is mentioned June 4, 1965. 
;Rufus
:A &quot;good-for-not-much&quot;. He frequently accompanies Joel. He always has &quot;kitty&quot; hanging from the crook of his arm. He lives in a shack.
;Magnus
:Rufus&#x27; no-good brother. He is usually in jail.
;Melba Rose
:The forever mayor of the city. The strip on June 15, 2022, shows her as the current mayor.

===Second-generation characters===
;Allison &quot;Skeezix&quot; Wallet
:After Walt, the central character of the strip. He was left on Walt&#x27;s doorstep February 14, 1921. He was born February 9, 1921. He married Nina Clock on June 28, 1944. For years he ran the Gasoline Alley Garage. Now he sometimes minds it when Clovia and Slim are away.
;Nina Clock Wallet
:Skeezix&#x27;s wife.
;Sarge (Sgt. Bloney)
:Fought in WWII in Africa, Italy, and Yugoslavia alongside Skeezix and later worked as a handyman and mechanic for him.
;Hack 
:WWII veteran who worked for Skeezix as a mechanic. His automotive repair skills were the reason the Wallet &amp; Bobble Co. branched into automotive repairs and built the Gasoline Alley Garage.
;Corkleigh &quot;Corky&quot; Wallet
:Walt and Phyllis&#x27; son, born May 2, 1928, named after Phyllis&#x27;s maiden name. He married Hope Hassel on October 1, 1949. He runs a diner in a standalone building.
;Hope Hassel Wallet
:Corky&#x27;s wife.
;Judy Wallet Grubb
:Left in Walt&#x27;s car February 28, 1935. She married Gideon Grubb on May 4, 1961.
;Senator Wilmer Bobble
:Pert&#x27;s nephew. Originally an office coworker with Skeezix at Wumple &amp; Co. in Detropolis. He also occasionally met Skeezix as a fellow soldier in Africa in WWII. After the war he partnered with Skeezix to form the Wallet and Bobble Co. This was originally a handyman and general repair business, but soon branched into automotive repairs and started the Gasoline Alley Garage. Went on to become an example of a self-serving politician. When seen he is disliked and is often the villain of the current story.

===Principal characters of subsequent generations===
;Clovia Wallet Skinner
:Third generation. Skeezix and Nina&#x27;s daughter. Born May 15, 1949. Married Slim Skinner. She runs the business end of the Gasoline Alley Garage.
;Slim Skinner
:Third generation. Married Clovia. Overweight and seems a slacker. He is principal, and perhaps only, mechanic at the Garage. Sometimes seen are Slim&#x27;s greedy, manipulative card-playing mother Lil, and cousin Chubby. Clovia considers both Lil and Chubby to be no good (particularly Lil, who frequently causes trouble and is quick to blame others for her wrongdoing).
;Thomas Walter &quot;Chipper&quot; Wallet
:Third generation. Skeezix and Nina&#x27;s son. Born April 1, 1945. He went to college, then joined the Navy and served in the Vietnam War as a medic. After leaving the Navy he became a Physician Assistant.
;Phylip Figg &quot;Nubbin&quot; Wallet
:Third generation. Corky and Hope&#x27;s first child. Born January 1, 1954.
;Adam Wallet

;Eve Wallet
:Third generation. Corky&#x27;s daughter, Adam&#x27;s twin sister. Born April 21, 1960. Apparently something of a black sheep of the family, she briefly moved into Walt&#x27;s house after Phyllis&#x27; death, ostensibly to act as his caregiver. She invited a large number of people into the house, police were called, and she was last seen in jail.
;Teeka Tok Wallet

King was succeeded by his former assistants, with Bill Perry taking responsibility for Sunday strips in 1951 and Dick Moores, first hired in 1956, becoming sole writer and artist for the daily strip in 1959. When Perry retired in 1975, Moores took over the Sunday strips, as well, combining the daily and Sunday stories into one continuity starting September 28, 1975. Moores died in 1986, and since then, &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot; has been written and drawn by Scancarelli, former assistant to Moores. Scancarelli returned to done-in-one separate situations for the Sunday strip.

==Awards==
The strip and King were recognized with the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Humor Strip Award in 1957, 1973, 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1985. King received the 1958 Society&#x27;s Reuben Award, and Moores received it in 1974. Scancarelli received the Society&#x27;s Story Comic Strip Award in 1988. The strip received an NCS plaque for the year&#x27;s best story strip in 1981, 1982 and 1983.

==Reprint collections==
Examples of the full page Sunday strip were printed in &quot;The Comic Strip Century&quot; (1995, reissued in 2004 as &quot;100 Years of Comic Strips&quot;), edited by Bill Blackbeard, Dale Crain and James Vance. Moores&#x27; dailies and Sundays have appeared in &quot;Comics Revue&quot; monthly, as have the first Scancarelli strips. In 1995, the strip was one of 20 included in the Comic Strip Classics series of commemorative US postage stamps.

===&quot;Frank King&#x27;s Gasoline Alley Nostalgia Journal&quot;===
In 2003, Spec Productions began a series of softcover collections, &quot;Frank King&#x27;s Gasoline Alley Nostalgia Journal&quot;, reprinting the strip from the first &quot;Rectangle&quot; panel (November 24, 1918). To date, four volumes have appeared:
* Volume 1, November 24, 1918, to September 22, 1919
* Volume 2, September 23, 1919, to March 2, 1920
* Volume 3, March 3, 1920, to July 25, 1920
* Volume 4, July 26, 1920, to December 31, 1920

===&quot;Walt and Skeezix&quot;===

In 2005, the first of a series of reprint books, &quot;Walt and Skeezix&quot;, was published by Drawn &amp; Quarterly, edited by Chris Ware and included contributions by Jeet Heer. The first volume covers 1921–22, beginning several weeks before baby Skeezix appears. These reprint only the daily strips, with Sundays slated to appear in another series:

===Sunday Press===
In 2007, Sunday Press Books published &quot;Sundays with Walt and Skeezix&quot;, which collects early Sunday strips in the original size and color.

===Dark Horse===
In 2014, Dark Horse Comics published &quot;Gasoline Alley: The Complete Sundays Volume 1 1920–1922&quot; and &quot;Gasoline Alley: The Complete Sundays Volume 2 1923–1925&quot; in hardback.

===Dick Moores===
Moores&#x27; work on the strip was published in three different collections, all currently out of print, as well as being serialized in &quot;Comics Revue&quot; magazine:
* &quot;Gasoline Alley: Comic Art as Social Comment: Changing Life in America Over More Than Half a Century as Seen Through the Eyes of a Unique &#x27;First Family&quot;&#x27;, Avon/Flare, 1976. Introduction by Nat Hentoff, history of the strip with 1970s continuities. 
* &quot;The Smoke from Gasoline Alley&quot;, Sheed and Ward, 1976. 
* &quot;Rover from Gasoline Alley&quot;, Blackthorne, 1985. Collects the strips introducing Slim and Clovia&#x27;s adopted son Rover. 

On October 9, 2012, IDW Publishing&#x27;s imprint The Library of American Comics published a hardback collection titled &quot;Gasoline Alley, Volume 1&quot;, collecting several years of the daily strip by Frank King and Dick Moores.

==Radio==
Several radio adaptations were made. &quot;Uncle Walt and Skeezix&quot; in 1931 starred Bill Idelson as Skeezix with Jean Gillespie as Nina Clock. Jimmy McCallion was Skeezix in the series that ran on NBC from February 17 to April 11, 1941, continuing on the Blue Network from April 28 to May 9 of that same year. The 15-minute series aired weekdays at 5:30 pm. Along with Nina (Janice Gilbert), the characters included Skeezix&#x27;s boss Wumple (Cliff Soubier) and Ling Wee (Junius Matthews), a waiter in a Chinese restaurant. Charles Schenck directed the scripts by Kane Campbell.

The syndicated series of 1948–49 featured a cast of Bill Lipton, Mason Adams, and Robert Dryden. Sponsored by Autolite, the program used opening theme music by the Polka Dots, a harmonica group. The 15-minute episodes focused on Skeezix running a gas station and garage, the Wallet and Bobble Garage, with his partner, Wilmer Bobble. In New York, this series aired on WOR from July 16, 1948, to January 7, 1949.

==Films==
&quot;Gasoline Alley&quot; was adapted into two feature films, &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot; (1951) and &quot;Corky of Gasoline Alley&quot; (1951). The films starred Jimmy Lydon as Skeezix, known at that time for &quot;Life with Father&quot; (1947) and his earlier character of Henry Aldrich.

<doc id="160106" wikidata="Q7759881" url="?curid=160106" title="The Red House Mystery">
<text>The Red House Mystery is a whodunnit by A. A. Milne, published in 1922. It was Milne&#x27;s only mystery novel (except for &quot;Four Days Wonder&quot;).

==Plot introduction==
The setting is an English country house, where Mark Ablett has been entertaining a house party consisting of a widow and her marriageable daughter, a retired major, a wilful actress, and Bill Beverley, a young man about town. Mark&#x27;s long-lost brother Robert, the black sheep of the family, arrives from Australia and shortly thereafter is found dead, shot through the head. Mark Ablett has disappeared, so Tony Gillingham, a stranger who has just arrived to call on his friend Bill, decides to investigate. Gillingham plays Sherlock Holmes to his younger counterpart&#x27;s Doctor Watson; they progress almost playfully through the novel while the clues mount up and the theories abound.

==Literary significance and criticism==
&quot;The Red House Mystery&quot; was immediately popular; Alexander Woollcott called it &quot;one of the three best mystery stories of all time&quot;, though Raymond Chandler, in his essay &quot;The Simple Art of Murder&quot; (1944), criticised Woollcott for that claim, referring to him as, &quot;rather a fast man with a superlative&quot;. Chandler wrote of Milne&#x27;s novel, &quot;It is an agreeable book, light, amusing in the &quot;Punch&quot; style, written with a deceptive smoothness that is not as easy as it looks [...] Yet, however light in texture the story may be, it is offered as a problem of logic and deduction. If it is not that, it is nothing at all. There is nothing else for it to be. If the situation is false, you cannot even accept it as a light novel, for there is no story for the light novel to be about.&quot;

In his introduction to the 1926 UK edition, A. A. Milne said he had &quot;a passion&quot; for detective stories, having &quot;all sorts of curious preferences&quot; about them: though in real life the best detectives and criminals are professionals, Milne demanded that the detective be an unscientific amateur, accompanied by a likable Watson, rubbing shoulders with an amateur villain against whom dossiers and fingerprints are of no avail.

Chandler&#x27;s essay rejects this model, declaring: &quot;It is the ladies and gentlemen of what Mr. Howard Haycraft (in his book &quot;Murder for Pleasure&quot;) calls the Golden Age of Detective Fiction that really get me down.&quot; He uses &quot;The Red House Mystery&quot; to illustrate the problems he saw in many mystery stories of this type, particularly the central puzzle (which was intricate and clever but implausible in many ways) and the fact that the amateur detective&#x27;s chance to shine comes only because the police are incompetent and surprisingly willing to put up with a &quot;brash amateur&quot; romping through their territory. (&quot;English police seem to endure him with their customary stoicism; but I shudder to think of what the boys down at the Homicide Bureau in my city would do to him.&quot;)

Chandler noted that &quot;The Red House Mystery&quot; seemed to have been in print in the US for about 16 years. &quot;That happens to few books of any kind.&quot; By 1948, 23 editions had been published in the UK. The most recent UK reprint was the Hatchard&#x27;s limited edition in cloth binding, stylish dust jacket and beautiful endpapers, published in 2022.

<doc id="160108" wikidata="Q11831" url="?curid=160108" title="Snow White">
<text>&quot;Snow White&quot; is a German fairy tale, first written down in the early 19th century. The Brothers Grimm published it in 1812 in the first edition of their collection &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot;, numbered as Tale 53. The original German title was &quot;Sneewittchen&quot;; the modern spelling is &quot;Schneewittchen&quot;. The Grimms completed their final revision of the story in 1854, which can be found in the 1857 version of &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot;.

The fairy tale features elements such as the magic mirror, the poisoned apple, the glass coffin, and the characters of the Evil Queen and the seven Dwarfs. The seven dwarfs were first given individual names in the 1912 Broadway play &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; and then given different names in Walt Disney&#x27;s 1937 film &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;. The Grimm story, which is commonly referred to as &quot;Snow White&quot;, should not be confused with the story of &quot;Snow-White and Rose-Red&quot; (in German &quot;&quot;), another fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm. 

In the Aarne–Thompson folklore classification, tales of this kind are grouped together as type 709, Snow White. Others of this kind include &quot;Bella Venezia&quot;, &quot;Myrsina&quot;, &quot;Nourie Hadig&quot;, &quot;Gold-Tree and Silver-Tree&quot;, &quot;The Young Slave&quot;, and &quot;La petite Toute-Belle&quot;.

==Plot==

At the beginning of the story, a queen sits sewing at an open window during a winter snowfall when she pricks her finger with her needle, causing three drops of blood to drip onto the freshly fallen snow on the black window sill. Then she says to herself, &quot;How I wish that I had a daughter who had skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood and hair as black as ebony.&quot; Some time later, the queen dies giving birth to a baby daughter whom she names Snow White. (However, in the 1812 version of the tale, the queen does not die but later behaves the same way the stepmother does in later versions of the tale, including the 1854 iteration.) A year later, Snow White&#x27;s father, the king, marries again. His new wife is very beautiful, but a vain and wicked woman who practices witchcraft. The new queen possesses a magic mirror, which she asks every morning, &quot;Mirror mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?&quot; The mirror always tells the queen that she is the fairest. The Queen is always pleased with that response because the magic mirror never lies. When Snow White is seven years old, her fairness surpasses that of her stepmother. When the Queen again asks her mirror the same question, it tells her that Snow White is the fairest.

This gives the Queen a great shock. She becomes envious, and from that moment on, her heart turns against Snow White, whom the Queen grows to hate increasingly with time. Eventually, she orders a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. As proof that Snow White is dead, the Queen also wants him to return with her lungs and liver, so she can eat them with salt. The huntsman takes Snow White into the forest, but after raising his dagger, he finds himself unable to kill her when Snow White realizes her stepmother&#x27;s plan and tearfully begs the huntsman, &quot;Spare me this mockery of justice! I will run away into the forest and never come home again!&quot; After seeing the tears in the princess&#x27;s eyes, the huntsman reluctantly agrees to spare Snow White and brings the Queen a boar&#x27;s lungs and liver instead. The Queen, believing them to be Snow White&#x27;s, cooks them with salt and eats them.

After wandering through the forest for hours, Snow White discovers a tiny cottage belonging to a group of seven dwarfs. Since no one is at home, she eats some of the tiny meals, drinks some of their wine, and then tests all the beds. Finally, the last bed is comfortable enough for her, and she falls asleep. When the dwarfs return home, they immediately become aware that there has been a burglar in their house because everything in their home is in disorder. Prowling about frantically, they head upstairs and discover the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them about her stepmother&#x27;s attempt to kill her, and the dwarfs take pity on her and let her stay with them in exchange for a job as a housemaid. They warn her to be careful when alone at home and to let no one in while they are working in the mountains.

Snow White grows into a lovely, fair, and beautiful young maiden. Meanwhile, the queen, who believes she got rid of Snow White, asks her mirror once again: &quot;Mirror mirror on the wall, who now is the fairest one of all?&quot; The mirror tells her that not only is Snow White still the fairest in the land, but is also currently hiding with the dwarfs. The Queen is furious and decides to kill her herself. First, she appears at the dwarfs&#x27; cottage, disguised as an old peddler, and offers Snow White a colourful, silky laced bodice as a present. The Queen laces her up so tightly that Snow White faints; the dwarfs return just in time to revive Snow White by loosening the laces. Next, the Queen dresses up as a comb seller and convinces Snow White to take a beautiful comb as a present; she strokes Snow White&#x27;s hair with the poisoned comb. The girl is overcome by the poison from the comb, but is again revived by the dwarfs when they remove the comb from her hair. Finally, the queen disguises herself as a farmer&#x27;s wife and offers Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White is hesitant to accept it, so the queen cuts the apple in half, eating the white (harmless) half and giving the red poisoned half to Snow White; the girl eagerly takes a bite and then falls into a coma, causing the Queen to think she has finally triumphed. This time, the dwarfs are unable to revive Snow White, and, assuming that the queen has finally killed her, they place her in a glass casket as a funeral for her.

Some time later, a prince stumbles upon a seemingly dead Snow White lying in her glass coffin during a hunting trip. After hearing her story from the seven dwarfs, the prince is allowed to take Snow White to her proper resting place back at her father&#x27;s castle. All of a sudden, while Snow White is being transported, one of the prince&#x27;s servants trips and loses his balance. This dislodges the piece of the poisoned apple from Snow White&#x27;s throat, magically reviving her. (In the 1812 version, the prince becomes so obsessed with Snow White that he carries her coffin wherever he goes, until one of his servants, in anger, lifts Snow White from the coffin and strikes her on the back, causing the piece of apple to come out of her throat.) The Prince is overjoyed by this, and he declares his love for the now alive and well Snow White, who, surprised to meet him face to face, humbly accepts his marriage proposal. The prince invites everyone in the land to their wedding except for Snow White&#x27;s stepmother.

The Queen, believing herself finally to be rid of Snow White, asks again her magic mirror, who is the fairest in the land. The mirror says that there is a bride of a prince who is yet fairer. The queen decides to go to the wedding and investigate. Once she arrives, the Queen becomes frozen with rage and fear when she finds out that the prince&#x27;s bride is her stepdaughter, Snow White herself. The furious Queen tries to sow chaos and attempts to kill her again, but the prince recognizes her as a threat to Snow White when he learns the truth from his bride. As punishment for the attempted murder of Snow White, the prince orders the Queen to wear a pair of red-hot iron slippers and to dance in them until she drops dead. With the Queen finally defeated and dead, Snow White&#x27;s wedding to the prince peacefully continues.

==Characters==
===Snow White===
Snow White is the main character in the story and stepdaughter to the Evil Queen. She is described by the Evil Queen&#x27;s Magic Mirror as the fairest of the land. She survives several attempts by the jealous queen to murder her. After Snow White is spared by the huntsman sent by her stepmother to assassinate her, she takes shelter at the home of seven dwarves. Finally, the queen disguises herself as an old woman and tricks Snow White into eating a poison apple, which puts her in a deep sleep. Snow White is later revived and marries the prince.

===Seven Dwarfs===

The Seven Dwarfs are a group of dwarfs that let Snow White live with them.

===The Evil Queen===

The Evil Queen deeply envies Snow White for her looks and her jealousy leads her to attempt to murder Snow White in multiple different ways. The Evil Queen first tries to murder Snow White via a huntsman who she has sent to assassinate her. The Evil Queen then decides to murder Snow White by disguising herself as an old woman in order to gain her trust so she can then poison her. The Evil Queen initially attempts to poison Snow White with a comb, but when that fails, she disguises herself as an old woman and gives Snow White a poison apple. The Evil Queen&#x27;s third attempt to kill Snow White is successful: Snow White bites into the poisoned apple and dies.

===The Huntsman===
The Evil Queen orders an unnamed Huntsman to take Snow White into the deepest woods to be killed. As proof that Snow White is dead, the Queen demands that he return with her lungs and liver. The Huntsman takes Snow White into the forest, but spares her. The Huntsman leaves her behind alive, convinced that the girl would be eaten by some wild animal. He instead brings the Queen the lungs and liver of a wild boar, which is prepared by the cook and eaten by the Queen.

===The Magic Mirror===

The Magic Mirror is an omniscient and seemingly sentient mirror that the Queen uses to confirm her status as the &quot;fairest in the land&quot;.

===The King===
The King is the father of Snow White and a minor character in the story.

===The Prince===
The Prince marries Snow White after she is revived while the Prince and his servants take her to be buried.

==Inspiration==
Scholars have theorized about the possible origins of the tale, with folklorists such as Sigrid Schmidt, Joseph Jacobs and Christine Goldberg noting that it combines multiple motifs also found in other folktales. Scholar Graham Anderson compares the fairy tale to the Roman legend of Chione, or &quot;Snow,&quot; recorded in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;.

In the 1980s and 1990s, some German authors suggested that the fairy tale could have been inspired by a real person. Eckhard Sander, a teacher, claimed that the inspiration was Margaretha von Waldeck, a German countess born in 1533, as well as several other women in her family. Karlheinz Bartels, a pharmacist and scholar from Lohr am Main, a town in northwestern Bavaria, created a tongue-in-cheek theory that Snow White was Maria Sophia Margarethe Catharina, Baroness von und zu Erthal, born in 1725. However, these theories are generally dismissed by serious scholars, with folklore professor Donald Haase calling them &quot;pure speculation and not at all convincing.&quot;

==Variations==

The principal studies of traditional &quot;Snow White&quot; variants are Ernst Böklen&#x27;s, &quot;Schneewittchen Studien&quot; of 1910, which reprints fifty Snow White variants, and studies by Steven Swann Jones. In their first edition, the Brothers Grimm published the version they had first collected, in which the villain is Snow White&#x27;s jealous biological mother. In a version sent to another folklorist prior to the first edition, additionally, she does not order a servant to take her to the woods, but takes her there herself to gather flowers and abandons her; in the first edition, this task was transferred to a servant. It is believed that the change to a stepmother in later editions was to tone down the story for children.

A popular but sanitized version of the story is the 1937 American animated film &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; by Walt Disney. Disney&#x27;s variation of Snow White gave the dwarfs names and included a singing Snow White. The Disney film also is the only version in which Snow White and her prince meet before she bites the apple; in fact, it is this meeting that sets the plot in motion. Instead of her lungs and liver, as written in the original, the huntsman is asked by the queen to bring back Snow White&#x27;s heart. While the heart is mentioned, it is never shown in the box. Snow White is also older and more mature. Also, she is discovered by the dwarfs after cleaning the house, not vandalizing it. Furthermore, in the Disney movie, the evil queen tries only once to kill Snow White (with the poisoned apple) and fails. She then dies by falling down a cliff and being crushed by a boulder, after the dwarfs had chased her through the forest. In the original, the queen is forced to dance to death in red hot iron slippers.

===Variants and parallels to other tales===
This tale type is widespread in Europe, in America, in Africa and &quot;in some Turkic traditions,&quot; the Middle East, in China, in India and in the Americas. Jörg Bäcker draws a parallel to Turkic tales, as well as other tales with a separate origin but overlapping themes, such as those in Central Asia and Eastern Siberia, among the Mongolians and Tungusian peoples. Due to Portuguese colonization, Sigrid Schmidt posits the presence of the tale in modern times in former Portuguese colonies, and contrasts it with other distinct African tales.

===Europe===
A primary analysis by Celtic folklorist Alfred Nutt, in the 19th century, established the tale type, in Europe, was distributed &quot;from the Balkan peninsula to Iceland, and from Russia to Catalonia&quot;, with the highest number of variants being found in Germany and Italy.

This geographical distribution seemed to be confirmed by scholarly studies of the 20th century. A 1957 article by Italian philologist Gianfranco D&#x27;Aronco (it) studied the most diffused &quot;Tales of Magic&quot; in Italian territory, among which &quot;Biancaneve&quot;. A scholarly inquiry by Italian &quot;Istituto centrale per i beni sonori ed audiovisivi&quot; (&quot;Central Institute of Sound and Audiovisual Heritage&quot;), produced in the late 1960s and early 1970s, found thirty-seven variants of the tale across Italian sources. A similar assessment was made by scholar Sigrid Schmidt, who claimed that the tale type was &quot;particularly popular&quot; in Southern Europe, &quot;specially&quot; in Italy, Greece and the Iberian Peninsula. In addition, Swedish scholar suggested Italy as center of diffusion of the story, since he considered Italy as the source of tale (&quot;Ursprung&quot;), and it holds the highest number of variants not derived from the Grimm&#x27;s tale.

Another study, by researcher Theo Meder, points to a wide distribution in Western Europe, specially in Ireland, Iceland and Scandinavia.

====Germany====
The Brothers Grimm&#x27;s &quot;Snow White&quot; was predated by several other German versions of the tale, with the earliest being Johann Karl August Musäus&#x27;s &quot;Richilde&quot; (1782), a satirical novella told from the wicked stepmother&#x27;s point of view. Albert Ludwig Grimm (no relation to the Brothers Grimm) published a play version, &quot;Schneewittchen&quot;, in 1809. The Grimms collected at least eight other distinct variants of the tale, which they considered one of the most famous German folktales.

====Italy====
The Pentamerone, published 1634-1636, contains some stories with similarities to Snow White, such as an enchanted sleep in &quot;The Young Slave&quot; and a female character with snow-white skin in &quot;The Raven.&quot; In most Italian versions of Snow White, the heroine is not the daughter of a king but an innkeeper, the antagonist is not her stepmother but her biological mother, and instead of dwarfs she takes refuge with robbers. For instance, in &quot;La Bella Venezia&quot;, an Abruzzian version collected by Antonio De Nino, the mother asks her customers if they have seen a woman more beautiful than she. If they say they did not, she only charges them half the price, if they say they did she charges them twice the price. When the customers tell her that her daughter is prettier than her, she gets jealous. In &quot;Maria, her Evil Stepmother and the Seven Robbers&quot; (&quot;Maria, die böse Stiefmutter und die sieben Räuber&quot;), a Sicilian version collected by Laura Gonzenbach the heroine also lives with robbers, but the antagonist is her stepmother and she&#x27;s not an innkeeper.

Sometimes the heroine&#x27;s protectors are female instead of male, as in &quot;The Cruel Stepmother&quot; (), a variant collected by Angelo de Gubernatis in which, like in the Grimm&#x27;s version, Snow White&#x27;s counterpart, called here Caterina, is the daughter of a king, and the antagonist is her stepmother, who orders her servants to kill her stepdaughter after she hears people commenting how much prettier Caterina is than she. One day the two women are going to mass together. Instead of a male protector, Caterina takes refuge in a house by the seashore where an old woman lives. Later a witch discovers that Caterina&#x27;s still alive and where she lives, so she goes to tell the queen, who sends her back to the cottage to kill her with poisoned flowers instead of an apple. A similar version from Siena was collected by Sicilian folklorist Giuseppe Pitrè, in which the heroine, called Ermellina, runs away from home riding an eagle who takes her away to a palace inhabited by fairies. Ermellina&#x27;s stepmother sends a witch disguised as her stepdaughter&#x27;s servants to the fairies&#x27; palace to try to kill her twice, first with poisoned sweetmeats and the second time with an enchanted dress. Pitré also collected a variant from Palermo titled &quot;Child Margarita&quot; (&quot;La &#x27;Nfanti Margarita&quot;) where the heroine stays in a haunted castle.

There&#x27;s also a couple of conversions that combines the ATU tale type 709 with the second part of the type 410 &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, in which, when the heroine is awakened, the prince&#x27;s mother tries to kill her and the children she has had with the prince. Gonzenbach collected two variants from Sicily, the first one called &quot;Maruzzedda&quot; and the second &quot;Beautiful Anna&quot;; and Vittorio Imbriani collected a version titled &quot;La Bella Ostessina&quot;.

In some versions, the antagonists are not the heroine&#x27;s mother or stepmother, but her two elder sisters, as in a version from Trentino collected by Christian Schneller, or a version from Bologna collected by Carolina Coronedi-Berti. In this last version, the role of both the mirror and the dwarfs is played by the Moon, which tells the elder sisters that the youngest, called Ziricochel, is the prettiest, and later hides her in his palace. When the sisters discover Ziricochel is still alive, they send an astrologer to kill her. After several attempts, she finally manages to turn her into a statue with an enchanted shirt. Ziricochel is revived after the prince&#x27;s sisters take the shirt off.

Italo Calvino included the version from Bologna collected by Coronedi Berti, retitling it &quot;Giricoccola&quot;, and the Abruzzian version collected by De Nino in Italian Folktales.

====France====
Paul Sébillot collected two variants from Brittany in northwestern France. In the first one, titled &quot;The Enchanted Stockings&quot; (&quot;Les Bas enchantés&quot;), starts similarly to Gubernatis&#x27; version, with the heroine being the daughter of a queen, and her mother wanting to kill her after a soldier marching in front of her balcony says the princess is prettier than the queen. The role of the poisoned apple is fulfilled by the titular stockings, and the heroine is revived after the prince&#x27;s little sister takes them off when she&#x27;s playing. In the second, titled La petite Toute-Belle, a servant accuses the heroine of stealing the things she stole and then throws her in a well. The heroine survives the fall and ends up living with three dragons that live at the bottom of the well. When the heroine&#x27;s mother discovers her daughter is still alive, she twice sends a fairy to attempt to kill her, first with sugar almonds, which the dragons warn her are poisoned before she eats them, and then with a red dress. In another version from Brittany, this one collected by François Cadic, the heroine is called Rose-Neige (Eng: Snow-Rose) because her mother pricked her finger with a rose in a snowy day and wished to have a child as beautiful as the rose. The role of the dwarfs is played by Korrigans, dwarf-like creatures from the Breton folklore. Louis Morin collected a version from Troyes in northeastern France, where like in the Grimm&#x27;s version the mother questions a magic mirror. A version from Corsica titled &quot;Anghjulina&quot; was collected by Geneviève Massignon, where the roles of both the huntsman and the dwarfs are instead a group of bandits whom Anghjulina&#x27;s mother asks to kill her daughter, but they instead take her away to live with them in the woods.

====Belgium and the Netherlands====
A Flemish version from Antwerp collected by Victor de Meyere is quite similar to the version collected by the brothers Grimm. The heroine is called Sneeuwwitje (Snow White in Dutch), she is the queen&#x27;s stepdaughter, and the stepmother questions a mirror. Instead of dwarfs, the princess is taken in by seven kabouters. Instead of going to kill Snow White herself, the queen twice sends the witch who had sold her the magic mirror to kill Sneeuwwitje, first with a comb and the second time with an apple. But the most significant difference is that the role of the prince in this version is instead Snow White&#x27;s father, the king.

Another Flemish variant, this one from Hamme, differs more from Grimm&#x27;s story. The one who wants to kill the heroine, called here Mauricia, is her own biological mother. She is convinced by a demon with a spider head that if her daughter dies, she will become beautiful. The mother sends two servants to kill Mauricia, bringing as proof a lock of her hair, a bottle with her blood, a piece of her tongue and a piece of her clothes. The servants spare Mauricia&#x27;s life, as well as her pet sheep. To deceive Mauricia&#x27;s mother, they buy a goat and bring a bottle with the animal&#x27;s blood as well as a piece of his tongue. Meanwhile, Mauricia is taken in by seventeen robbers who live in a cave deep in the forest, instead of seven dwarfs. When Mauricia&#x27;s mother discovers that her daughter is still alive, she goes to the robbers&#x27; cave disguised. She turns her daughter into a bird, and she takes her place. The plan fails and Mauricia recovers her human form, so the mother tries to kill her by using a magic ring which the demon gave her. Mauricia is awoken when a prince takes the ring off her finger. When he asks her if he would marry her, she rejects him and returns with the seventeen robbers.

====Iberian Peninsula====
One of the first versions from Spain, titled &quot;The Beautiful Stepdaughter&quot; (&quot;La hermosa hijastra&quot;), was collected by Manuel Milà i Fontanals, in which a demon tells the stepmother that her stepdaughter is prettier than she is when she&#x27;s looking at herself in the mirror. The stepmother orders her servants to take her stepdaughter to the forest and kill her, bringing a bottle with her blood as proof. But the servants spare her life and instead kill a dog. Eight days later the demon warns her that the blood in the bottle is not her stepdaughter&#x27;s, and the stepmother sends her servants again, ordering them to bring one of her heart and bare-toes as proof. The stepdaughter later discovers four men living in the forest, inside a rock that can open and close with the right words. Every day after she sees the men leave she enters the cave and cleans it up. Believing it must be an intruder, the men take turns to stay at the cavern, but the first one falls asleep during his watch. The second one manages to catch the girl, and they agree to let the girl live with them. Later, the same demon that told her stepmother that her stepdaughter was prettier gives the girl an enchanted ring, that has the same role that the apple in the Grimm&#x27;s version. The version in Catalan included by Francisco Maspons y Labrós in the second volume of &quot;Lo Rondallayre&quot; follows that plot fairly closely, with some minor differences.

In an Aragonese version titled &quot;The Good Daughter&quot; (&quot;La buena hija&quot;) collected by Romualdo Nogués y Milagro, there&#x27;s no mirror. Instead, the story starts with the mother already hating her daughter because she&#x27;s prettier, and ordering a servant to kill her, bringing as proof her heart, tongue, and her little finger. The servant spares her and brings the mother the heart and tongue from a dog he ran over and says he lost the finger. The daughter is taken in by robbers living in a cavern, but despite all, she still misses her mother. One day an old woman appears and gives her a ring, saying that if she puts it on she&#x27;ll see her mother. The daughter actually falls unconscious when she does put it on because the old woman is actually a witch who wants to kidnap her, but she can&#x27;t because of the scapular the girl is wearing, so she locks her in a crystal casket, where the girl is later found by the prince.

In a version from Mallorca collected by Antoni Maria Alcover i Sureda titled &quot;Na Magraneta,&quot; a queen wishes to have a daughter after eating a pomegranate and calls her Magraneta. As in the Grimm&#x27;s version the queen asks her mirror who&#x27;s the most beautiful. The dwarf&#x27;s role is fulfilled by thirteen men who are described as big as giants, who live in a castle in the middle of the forest called &quot;Castell de la Colometa&quot;, whose doors can open and close by command. When the queen discovers thanks to her mirror that her daughter is still alive she sends an evil fairy disguised as an old woman. The role of the poisoned apple is fulfilled by an iron ring.

Aurelio Macedonio Espinosa Sr. collected two Spanish versions. The first one, titled &quot;Blanca Flor&quot;, is from Villaluenga de la Sagra, in Toledo. In this one the villain is the heroine&#x27;s own biological mother, and like in &quot;Na Magraneta&quot; she questions a mirror if there&#x27;s a woman more beautiful than she is. Instead of ordering a huntsman or servant to kill her daughter, after the mirror tells the woman her daughter has surpassed her, she tries to get rid of her daughter herself, inviting her to go for a walk in the countryside, and when they reach a rock she recites some spells from her book, making the rock swallow her daughter. Fortunately thanks to her prayers to the Virgin the daughter survives and gets out the rock, and she is later taken in by twelve robbers living in a castle. When the mother discovers her daughter is still alive, she sends a witch to kill her, who gives the daughter an enchanted silk shirt. The moment she puts it on, she falls in a deathlike state. She&#x27;s later revived when a sexton takes the shirt off. The second one, titled &quot;The Envious Mother&quot; (&quot;La madre envidiosa&quot;), comes from Jaraíz de la Vera, Cáceres. Here the villain is also the heroine&#x27;s biological mother, and she&#x27;s an innkeeper who asks a witch whether there&#x27;s a woman prettier than she is. Instead of a shirt, here the role of the apple is fulfilled by enchanted shoes. Aurelio de Llano Roza de Ampudia collected an Asturian version from Teverga titled &quot;The Envious Stepmother&quot; (&quot;La madrastra envidiosa&quot;), in which the stepmother locks her stepdaughter in a room with the hope that no one will see her and think she&#x27;s more beautiful. But the attempt fails when a guest tells the mother the girl locked in a room is prettier than she is. The story ends with the men who found the heroine discussing who should marry the girl once she&#x27;s revived, and she replies by telling them that she chooses to marry the servant who revived her. Aurelio Macedonio Espinosa Jr. collected four versions. The first one is titled &quot;Blancanieves&quot;, is from Medina del Campo, Valladolid, and follows the plot of the Grimm&#x27;s version fairly closely with barely any significant differences. The same happens with the second one, titled &quot;Blancaflor&quot;, that comes from Tordesillas, another location from Valladolid. The last two are the ones that present more significant differences, although like in Grimm&#x27;s the stepmother questions a magic mirror. &quot;The Bad Stepmother&quot; (&quot;La mala madrastra&quot;) comes from Sepúlveda, Segovia, and also has instead of seven dwarfs the robbers that live in a cave deep in the forest, that can open and close at command. Here the words to make it happen are &quot;Open, parsley!&quot; and &quot;Close, peppermint!&quot; The last one, &quot;Blancaflor&quot;, is from Siete Iglesias de Trabancos, also in Valladolid, ends with the heroine buried after biting a poisoned pear, and the mirror proclaiming that, now that her stepdaughter is finally dead, the stepmother is the most beautiful again.

One of the first Portuguese versions was collected by Francisco Adolfo Coelho. It was titled &quot;The Enchanted Shoes&quot; (&quot;Os sapatinhos encantados&quot;), where the heroine is the daughter of an innkeeper, who asks muleteers if they have seen a woman prettier than she is. One day, one answers that her daughter is prettier. The daughter takes refugee with a group of robbers who live in the forest, and the role of the apple is fulfilled by the titular enchanted shoes. Zófimo Consiglieri Pedroso collected another version, titled &quot;The Vain Queen&quot;, in which the titular queen questions her maids of honor and servants who&#x27;s the most beautiful. One day, when she asks the same question to her chamberlain, he replies the queen&#x27;s daughter is more beautiful than she is. The queen orders her servants to behead her daughter and bring back her tongue as proof, but they instead spare her and bring the queen a dog&#x27;s tongue. The princess is taken in by a man, who gives her two options, to live with him as either his wife or his daughter, and the princess chooses the second. The rest of the tale is quite different from most versions, with the titular queen completely disappeared from the story, and the story focusing instead of a prince that falls in love with the princess.

====Great Britain====
In the Scottish version Gold-Tree and Silver-Tree, queen Silver-Tree asks a trout in a well, instead of a magic mirror, who&#x27;s the most beautiful. When the trout tells her that Gold-Tree, her daughter, is more beautiful, Silver-Tree pretends to fall ill, declaring that her only cure is to eat her own daughter&#x27;s heart and liver. To save his daughter&#x27;s life, the king marries her off to a prince, and serves his wife a goat&#x27;s heart and liver. After Silver-Tree discovers that she has been deceived thanks to the trout, she visits her daughter and sticks her finger on a poisoned thorn. The prince later remarries, and his second wife removes the poisoned thorn from Gold-Tree, reviving her. The second wife then tricks the queen into drinking the poison that was meant for Gold-Tree. In another Scottish version, &quot;Lasair Gheug, the King of Ireland&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, the heroine&#x27;s stepmother frames the princess for the murder of the queen&#x27;s firstborn and manages to make her swear she&#x27;ll never tell the truth to anybody. Lasair Gheug, a name that in Gaelic means Flame of Branches, take refugee with thirteen cats, who turn out to be an enchanted prince and his squires. After marrying the prince and having three sons with him the queen discovers her stepdaughter is still alive, also thanks to a talking trout, and sends three giants of ice to put her in a death-like state. As in &quot;Gold-Tree and Silver-Tree&quot; the prince takes a second wife afterwards, and the second wife is the one who revives the heroine. Thomas William Thompson collected an English version from Blackburn simply titled &quot;Snow White&quot; which follows Grimm&#x27;s plot much more closely, although with some significant differences, such as Snow White being taken in by three robbers instead of seven dwarfs.

====Scandinavia====
One of the first Danish versions collected was &quot;Snehvide&quot; (&quot;Snow White&quot;), by Mathias Winther. In this variant, the stepmother is the princess&#x27; nurse, who persuades Snow White to ask her father to marry her. Because the king says he won&#x27;t remarry until grass grows in the grave of the princess&#x27; mother, the nurse plants magic seeds in the grave so grass will grow quicker. Then, after the king marries the nurse, Snow White gets betrothed to a prince, who choses her over the nurse&#x27;s three biological daughters, but after that the king and the prince had to leave to fight in a war. The queen seizes her opportunity to chase Snow White away, and she ends up living with the dwarfs in a mountain. When the queen finds out Snow White is still alive thanks to a magic mirror, she sends her daughters three times, each time one of them, with poisoned gifts to give them to her. With the third gift, a poisoned apple, Snow White falls into a deep sleep, and the dwarfs leave her in the forest, fearing that the king would accuse them of killing her once he comes back. When the king and the prince finally come back from the war and find Snow White&#x27;s body, the king dies of sorrow, but the prince manages to wake her up. After that we see an ending quite similar to the ones in &quot;The Goose Girl&quot; and &quot;The Three Oranges of Love&quot; the prince and Snow White get married, and the prince invites the stepmother and asks her what punishment deserve someone who has hurt someone as innocent as Snow White. The queen suggests for the culprit to be put inside a barrel full of needles, and the prince tells the stepmother she has pronounced her own sentence. Evald Tang Kristensen collected a version titled &quot;The Pretty Girl and the Crystal Bowls&quot; (), which, like some Italian variants, combines the tale type 709 with the type 410. In this version, the stepmother questions a pair of crystal bowls instead of a magic mirror, and when they tell her that her stepdaughter is prettier, she sends her to a witch&#x27;s hut where she&#x27;s tricked to eat a porridge that makes her pregnant. Ashamed that her daughter has become pregnant out of wedlock she kicks her out, but the girl is taken in by a shepherd. Later a crow lets a ring fall on the huts&#x27; floor, and, when the heroine puts it on, she falls in a deathlike state. Believing she&#x27;s dead the shepherd kills himself and the heroine is later revived when she gives birth to twins, each one of them with a star on the forehead, and one of them sucks the ring off her finger. She&#x27;s later found by a prince, whose mother tries to kill the girl and her children.

A Swedish version titled &quot;The Daughter of the Sun and the Twelve Bewitched Princes&quot; () starts pretty similarly to the Grimm&#x27;s version, with a queen wishing to have a child as white as snow and as red as blood, but that child turned out to be not the heroine but the villain, her own biological mother. Instead of a mirror, the queen asks the Sun, who tells her that her daughter will surpass her in beauty. Because of it the queen orders that her daughter must be raised in the countryside, away from the Royal Court, but when it&#x27;s time for the princess to come back the queen orders a servant to throw her in a well before she arrives. In the bottom, the princess meets twelve princes cursed to be chimeras, and she agrees to live with them. When the queen and the servant discover she is alive, they give her poisoned candy, which she eats. After being revived by a young king she marries him and has a son with him, but the queen goes to the castle pretending to be a midwife, turns her daughter into a golden bird by sticking a needle on her head, and then the queen takes her daughter&#x27;s place. After disenchanting the twelve princes with her singing, the princess returns to the court, where she&#x27;s finally restored to her human form, and her mother is punished after she believed she ate her own daughter while she was still under the spell.

====Greece and Albania====
French folklorist Henri Carnoy collected a Greek version, titled &quot;Marietta and the Witch her Stepmother&quot; (), in which the heroine is manipulated by her governess to kill her own mother, so the governess could marry her father. Soon after she marries Marietta&#x27;s father, the new stepmother orders her husband to get rid of his daughter. Marietta ends up living in a castle with forty giants. Meanwhile, Marietta&#x27;s stepmother, believing her stepdaughter is dead, asks the Sun who&#x27;s the most beautiful. When the Sun answers Marietta is more beautiful, she realises her stepdaughter is still alive, and, disguised as a peddler, goes to the giants&#x27; castle to kill her. She goes twice, the first trying to kill her with an enchanted ring, and the second with poisoned grapes. After Marietta is awoken and marries the prince, the stepmother goes to the prince&#x27;s castle pretending to be a midwife, sticks a fork on Marietta&#x27;s head to turn her into a pigeon, and then takes her place. After several transformations, Marietta recovers her human form and her stepmother is punished. Georgios A. Megas collected another Greek version, titled Myrsina, in which the antagonists are the heroine&#x27;s two elder sisters, and the role of the seven dwarfs is fulfilled by the Twelve Months. 

Austrian diplomat Johann Georg von Hahn collected a version from Albania, that also starts with the heroine, called Marigo, getting manipulated by the governess into killing her mother. She snaps her mother&#x27;s head off with a marble lid, while she was leaning over the marble chest to get her figs and almonds. After Marigo tells her father to marry the governess, the king refuses, making up various excuses, like his shoes turning red or his robes being full of holes. All of them are fulfilled by Marigo under the manipulation of her governess, therefore, the king keeps his promise and marries her. Some years after, Marigo grows up to be a beautiful young woman, even more attractive than the queen. Jealous, the stepmother forces her husband to choose between them. Either she kills herself or the king kills his daughter. But the king doesn&#x27;t have the heart to murder his own child, so he takes Marigo into the woods and tells her to fetch him the loaf of bread and the wooden flask which he threw off the cliff. When Marigo comes back, she fails to find her father and realises that he has abandoned her. As it was dark, the girl climbs up a wooden tree to spend the night. While she is asleep, the three Fatia, goddesses of fate, take pity on her and decide to wish her good. Each of the fatia suggest a choice for the girl. The third goddess tells her to find the castle inhabited by forty dragons who are all brothers. They take Marigo as their surrogate sister and she helps them with the castle chores, while they gift her precious jewellery. After discovering her stepdaughter is still alive thanks to the Sun, the queen twice sends her husband to the dragons&#x27; castle to kill Marigo, first with enchanted hair-pins and the second time with an enchanted ring. After the dragons fail to bring her alive, they decide to bury her in a coffin adorned with pearls. They hang it in a young king&#x27;s garden where an ancient tree near a beautiful fountain is to be found. The dragons suspend the coffin on four silver chains so that it would dangle right over the fountain. When the king finds the coffin, he takes it to his bedchamber and hides it for an entire year, refusing to eat, drink or sleep out of sorrow. His mother, the dowager queen, finds Marigo&#x27;s corpse and tells the maids to burn her. Marigo wakes up when one of the maids steals the ring off her finger. Eventually, she marries the young king and lives happily aver after. 

In another Albanian version, titled &quot;Fatimé,&quot; collected by French folklorist Auguste Dozon, the antagonists are the heroine&#x27;s two elder sisters.

====Russia and Eastern Europe====
According to Christine Shojaei Kawan, the earliest surviving folktale version of the Snow White story is a Russian tale published anonymously in 1795. The heroine is Olga, a merchant&#x27;s daughter, and the role of the magic mirror is played by some beggars who comment on her beauty. In the Russian tale, titled &quot;Сказка о старичках-келейчиках&quot;, a merchant has a daughter named Olga, and marries another woman. Years later, the girl&#x27;s stepmother welcomes some beggars in need of alms, who tell her Olga is more beautiful than her. A servant takes Olga to the open field and, in tears, tells the girl the stepmother ordered her to be killed and her heart and little finger brought back as proof of the deed. Olga cuts off her little finger and gives to the servant, who kills a little dog and takes out its heart. Olga takes refuge in a cottage with hunters, and asks the beggars to trade gifts with her stepmother: Olga sends a pie, and her stepmother sends her a poisoned pearl-studded shirt. Olga puts on the shirt and faints, as if dead. The hunters find her apparently dead body and place it in a crystal tomb. A prince appears to them and asks to take the coffin with him to his palace. Later, the prince&#x27;s mother takes off the pearl-studded shirt from Olga&#x27;s body and she wakes up.

Alexander Afanasyev collected a Russian version titled &quot;The Magic Mirror&quot;, in which the reason that the heroine has to leave her parents&#x27; house is different from the usual. Instead of being the daughter of a king, she is the daughter of a merchant, who&#x27;s left with her uncle while her father and brothers travel. During their absence, the heroine&#x27;s uncle attempts to assault her, but she frustrates his plans. To get his revenge he writes a letter to the heroine&#x27;s father, accusing her of misconduct. Believing what&#x27;s written in the letter, the merchant sends his son back home to kill his own sister, but the merchant&#x27;s son does not trust his uncle&#x27;s letter, and after discovering what&#x27;s in the letter are lies, he warns her sister, who escapes and is taken in by two bogatyrs. The elements of the stepmother and the mirror are introduced much later, after the merchant returns home believing his daughter is dead and remarries the woman who owns the titular magic mirror, that tells her that her stepdaughter is still alive and is more beautiful than she is. In another Russian version the heroine is the daughter of a Tsar, and her stepmother decides to kill her after asking three different mirrors and all of them told her her stepdaughters is more beautiful than she is. The dwarfs&#x27; role is fulfilled by twelve brothers cursed to be hawks, living at the top of a glass mountain.

Arthur and Albert Schott collected a Romanian version titled &quot;The Magic Mirror&quot; (; ), in which the villain is the heroine&#x27;s biological mother. After the titular mirror tells her that her daughter is prettiest, she takes her to go for a walk in the woods and feeds her extremely salty bread, so her daughter will become so thirsty that she would agree to let her tear out her eyes in exchange for water. Once the daughter is blinded her mother leaves her in the forest, where she manages to restore her eyes and is taken in by twelve thieves. After discovering her daughter is still alive, the mother sends an old woman to the thieves&#x27; house three times. The first she gives the daughter a ring, the second earrings, and the third poisoned flowers. After the heroine marries the prince, she has a child, and the mother goes to the castle pretending to be a midwife to kill both her daughter and the newborn. After killing the infant, she&#x27;s stopped before she can kill the heroine.

The Pushkin fairytale The Tale of the Dead Princess and the Seven Knights bears a striking similarity to the tale of Snow White. However, the Dead Princess befriends 7 knights instead of dwarfs, and it is the Sun and Moon who aid the Prince to the resting place of the Dead Princess, where he breaks with his sword the coffin of the Tsarevna, bringing her back to life.

===Americas===
In a Louisiana tale, &quot;Lé Roi Pan&quot; (&quot;The King Peacock&quot;), a mother has a child who becomes more beautiful than she, so she orders her daughter&#x27;s nurse to kill her. The daughter resigns to her fate, but the nurse spares her and gives her three seeds. After failing to drown in a well and to be eaten by an ogre, the girl eats a seed and falls into a deep sleep. The ogre family (who took her in after seeing her beauty) put her in a crystal coffin to float down the river. Her coffin is found by the titular King Peacock, who takes the seed from her mouth and awakens her. The King Peacock shares &quot;motifs and tropes&quot; with Snow White, according to Maria Tatar.

<text>Pitseolak Ashoona ( – May 28, 1983) was a Canadian Inuk artist admired for her prolific body of work. She was also a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.

==Biography==
Pitseolak was born to Timungiak and Oootochie on Nottingham Island in the Northwest Territories, now Nunavut. Her name means &quot;sea pigeon&quot; in Inuktitut. She grew up in the traditional life of her people, with food dependent on hunting and gathering. Her culture relied on angakuit.

In 1922 (or 1923), Pitseolak married Ashoona, a hunter, in the Foxe Peninsula of Baffin Island. They had 17 children, though only six (Namoonie, Qaqaq, Kumwartok, Kiugak, Napachie, and Ottochie) lived with Pitseolak until adulthood. Some died in childhood, and others were adopted out according to custom, and raised by other Inuit families.

After her husband died at the age of 40 from a viral sickness, Pitseolak raised four of the children, Kumwartok, Qaqaq, Kiawak or Kiugak, and daughter Napachie Pootoogook, herself. Years of hardship followed the death of Ashoona, which occurred sometime in the early to mid 1940s. He died in the early years of the Second World War, a time of decline in the market for furs.

Over time the loss of Ashoona led Pitseolak to become an artist. Making prints eased her loneliness and she described her art as what made her &quot;the happiest since he died&quot;. Pitseolak&#x27;s artwork later enabled her to support her family. Though her art arose from painful circumstances, it expressed mostly positive memories and experiences. As Christine Lalonde notes in &quot;Pitseolak Ashoona: Life &amp; Work&quot;: &quot;scenes of deprivation and suffering almost never appear in her drawings, though certain images convey sadness and longing&quot; about the passing of Ashoona.

Pitseolak is recognized as one of the first Inuit artists to create autobiographical works. Her art contained images of traditional Inuit life and contributed to the establishment of a modern Inuit art form, one that transmitted traditional knowledge and values while at the same time achieving worldwide popular and commercial success.

Pitseolak died on May 28, 1983, in Cape Dorset now Kinngait. She was survived by a large family of artists, including:

* Napatchie Pootoogook, daughter, graphic artist 
** Annie Pootoogook, (1969–2016), artist; granddaughter
* Qaqaq Ashoona (&quot;Kaka&quot;) (1928–1996), elder son and sculptor
** Ohitok, sculptor – grandson
* Kiugak Ashoona (1933–2014), son and sculptor
** Shuvinai Ashoona, (born 1961) artist, granddaughter
* Kumwartok Ashoona, son and sculptor

==Artistic career==

Pitseolak Ashoona was one of the first artists in the 1960s to make drawings for the print studio in Cape Dorset. She was a self-taught artist, who worked out solutions to artistic problems through what Lalonde described as &quot;a self directed-program of repetitious drawing&quot;.

Initially Pitseolak worked sewing and embroidering goods for sale as part of the arts and crafts program. It was initiated by the Department of Northern Affairs and National Resources as a way for Inuit to earn money. It was introduced by James Archibald Houston and Alma Houston at Cape Dorset in 1956. Upon seeing the work of her cousin Kiakshuk (1886–1966), who was part of the Cape Dorset graphic studio, Pitseolak decided to take up drawing. Her early work was well received and she soon became one of the most popular artists among those creating images for the Cape Dorset print collection.

First working with graphite pencil, Pitseolak would later move on to coloured pencil and felt-tip pens. Lalonde said these became her favoured medium because their &quot;rich and vibrant colours&quot; best expressed &quot;the joyfulness that characterizes her work&quot;.

Pitseolak&#x27;s cousin, Kiakshuk, and Houston both inspired her to try her hand at drawing. She also worked on copper plates, but did not enjoy this technique.

In the last two decades of her life, from 1960 onwards, she produced a collection of more than 7,000 images, 233 of which were created as prints in her Cape Dorset Collection. She said these illustrated life pre-contact, &quot;the things we did long ago before there were many white men.&quot;

Her artwork focuses on both daily life and legends, or &quot;Taleelayu&quot;. Pitseolak was inspired by other artists in her community who started before her, saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t know who did the first print, but Kiakshuk, Niviaksiak, Oshawetok and Tudlik were all drawing at the beginning. I liked the first prints ... because they were truly Eskimo.&quot; Pitseolak was accepted into the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 1974 and was awarded the Order of Canada in 1977 for her work.

Pitseolak found prints to be the most challenging, as she said in Dorothy Harley Eber&#x27;s book &quot;Pitseolak: Pictures of My Life&quot;; &quot;To make prints is not easy. You must think first and this is hard to do. But I am happy doing the prints.&quot; Though not active as a printmaker, Pitseolak experimented with drawing directly on copper plates and, to a lesser degree, lithographic stones.

In 1973 she narrated her story in the National Film Board&#x27;s animated documentary &quot;Pictures out of My Life&quot;, directed by Bozenna Heczko and based on interviews from Eber&#x27;s book. Pitseolak was also featured on a stamp, issued on March 8, 1993, and designed by Heather J. Cooper, in commemoration of International Woman&#x27;s Day.

Pitseolak&#x27;s work has been featured in exhibitions at Canadian museums, including the National Gallery of Canada, the Winnipeg Art Gallery, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Canadian museum of civilizations, and the Vancouver Art Gallery. In 1975 she had a retrospective at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., organized by the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada.

In 2020, Ashoona was one of eight finalists for the person to be depicted on $5 polymer bills in Canada.

<text>The Order of Canada () is a Canadian national order and the second-highest honour for merit in the system of orders, decorations, and medals of Canada, after the Order of Merit.

To coincide with the centennial of Canadian Confederation, the three-tiered order was established in 1967 as a fellowship recognizing the outstanding merit or distinguished service of Canadians who make a major difference to Canada through lifelong contributions in every field of endeavour, as well as efforts by non-Canadians who have made the world better by their actions. Membership is accorded to those who exemplify the order&#x27;s Latin motto, , meaning &quot;they desire a better country&quot;, a phrase taken from Hebrews 11:16. The three tiers of the order are Companion, Officer and Member. Specific people may be given extraordinary membership and deserving non-Canadians may receive honorary appointment into each grade.

, the reigning Canadian monarch, is the order&#x27;s sovereign. The governor general administers the order as its Chancellor and Principal Companion. Appointees to the order are recommended by an advisory board and formally inducted by the governor general or the sovereign. Initially awards required the prior approval of the sovereign; however since 1978 the sovereign is only informed of awards after they have been made. 

, 8,375 people have been appointed to the order, including scientists, musicians, politicians, artists, athletes, business people, film stars and benefactors. Some have resigned or have been removed from the order, while other appointments have been controversial. Appointees are presented with insignia and receive the right to armorial bearings.

==History==
The process of founding the Order of Canada began in early 1966 and concluded on 17 April 1967, when the organization was instituted by Queen Elizabeth II, on the advice of the Canadian prime minister, Lester B. Pearson, who was assisted with the establishment of the order by John Matheson. The snowflake design for the order was suggested by the diplomat John G. H. Halstead. The association was officially launched on 1 July 1967, the 100th anniversary of Canadian Confederation, with Governor General Roland Michener being the first inductee to the order, to the level of Companion, and on 7 July of the same year, 90 more people were appointed, including former Governor General Vincent Massey, former prime minister Louis St. Laurent, novelist Hugh MacLennan, religious leader David Bauer, novelist Gabrielle Roy, historian Donald Creighton, feminist politician and future senator Thérèse Casgrain, pioneering neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield, painter Arthur Lismer, public health leader Brock Chisholm, former political leader M. J. Coldwell, disability advocate Edwin Baker, painter Alex Colville, and ice hockey player Maurice Richard. During a visit to London, United Kingdom, later in 1970, Michener presented the Queen with her Sovereign&#x27;s badge for the Order of Canada, which she first wore during a banquet in Yellowknife in July 1970.

From the Order of Canada grew a Canadian honours system, thereby reducing the use of British honours (i.e. those administered by the Queen in her UK Privy Council). Among the civilian awards of the Canadian honours system, the Order of Canada comes third, after the Cross of Valour and membership in the Order of Merit, which is within the personal gift of Canada&#x27;s monarch. By the 1980s, Canada&#x27;s provinces began to develop their own distinct honours and decorations.

Canadian historian Margaret MacMillan represented the order at the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Westminster Abbey on 6 May 2023.

==Grades==

The Canadian monarch, seen as the fount of honour, is at the apex of the Order of Canada as its Sovereign, followed by the governor general, who serves as the fellowship&#x27;s Chancellor. Thereafter follow three grades, which are, in order of precedence: &quot;Companion&quot; (), &quot;Officer&quot; (), and &quot;Member&quot; (), each having accordant post-nominal letters that members are entitled to use. Each incumbent governor general is also installed as the Principal Companion for the duration of his or her time in the viceregal post and continues as an extraordinary Companion thereafter. Additionally, any governor general, viceregal consort, former governor general, former viceregal consort, or member of the Canadian royal family may be appointed as an extraordinary Companion, Officer, or Member. Promotions in grade are possible, though this is ordinarily not done within five years of the initial appointment, and a maximum of five honorary appointments into any of the three grades may be made by the governor general each year. , there have been 28 honorary appointments.
There were originally, in effect, only two ranks to the Order of Canada: &quot;Companion&quot; and the &quot;Medal of Service&quot;. There was, however, also a third award, the &quot;Medal of Courage&quot;, meant to recognize acts of gallantry. This latter decoration fell in rank between the other two levels, but was anomalous within the Order of Canada, being a separate award of a different nature rather than a middle grade of the order. Without ever having been awarded, the Medal of Courage was on 1 July 1972 replaced by the autonomous Cross of Valour and, at the same time, the levels of Officer and Member were introduced, with all existing holders of the Medal of Service created as Officers. Lester Pearson&#x27;s vision of a three-tiered structure to the order was thus fulfilled.

Companions of the Order of Canada (post-nominals: &quot;CC&quot;, in ) have demonstrated the highest degree of merit to Canada and humanity, on either the national or international scene. Up to 15 Companions are appointed annually, with an imposed limit of 180 living Companions at any given time, not including those appointed as extraordinary Companions or in an honorary capacity. , there are 146 living Companions. Since 1994, substantive members are the only regular citizens who are empowered to administer the Canadian Oath of Citizenship.

Officers of the Order of Canada (post-nominals: &quot;OC&quot;, in ) have demonstrated an outstanding level of talent and service to Canadians, and up to 64 may be appointed each year, not including those inducted as extraordinary Officers or in an honorary capacity, with no limit to how many may be living at one time. , there were 1,049 living Officers.

Members of the Order of Canada (post-nominals: &quot;CM&quot;, in ) have made an exceptional contribution to Canada or Canadians at a local or regional level, group, field or activity. As many as 136 Members may be appointed annually, not including extraordinary Members and those inducted on an honorary basis, and there is no limit on how many Members may be living at one time. , there were 2,281 living Members.

==Insignia==

Upon admission into the Order of Canada, members are given various insignia of the organization, all designed by Bruce W. Beatty, who &quot;broke new ground in the design of insignia of Orders within The Queen&#x27;s realms&quot; and was himself made a member of the order in 1990; Beatty attended every investiture ceremony between 1967 and early 2010. The badge belonging to the Sovereign consists of a jewelled, 18-carat gold crown of rubies, emeralds, and sapphires, from which is suspended a white, enamelled, hexagonal snowflake design, with six equal leaves and diamonds between each. At the centre is a disc bearing a maple leaf in pavé-laid rubies on a white enamel background, surrounded at its edge by a red enamel ring (annulus) bearing the motto of the order. The Chancellor wears the badge of a Companion and is, upon installation as governor general, granted a livery collar for wear at Order of Canada investiture ceremonies.

The badges for inductees are of a similar design to the Sovereign&#x27;s badge, though without precious stones, and slight differences for each grade. For Companions, the emblem is gilt with a red enamel maple leaf in the central disk; for Officers, it is gilt with a gold maple leaf; and for Members, both the badge itself and the maple leaf are silver. All are topped by a St. Edward&#x27;s Crown, symbolizing that the order is headed by the Sovereign, and the reverse is plain except for the word &quot;CANADA&quot;.

The ribbon is white and bordered in red stripes, similar to the Canadian national flag. The ribbon bar for each grade has the same ribbon and is differentiated by a maple leaf in the centre, the colour of which matches that on the badge of the related grade (red for Companion, gold for Officer and silver for Member). For civilian wear on less formal occasions, a lapel pin may be worn, which is a miniature version of the recipient&#x27;s badge and thus is distinct for each grade.

Wear of the insignia is according to guidelines issued by the Chancellery of Honours, which stipulate that the badges be worn before most other national orders, that is, at the end of an individual&#x27;s medal bar closest to the centre of the chest or at the wearer&#x27;s neck, with only the Victoria Cross, the Cross of Valour, and the badge of the Order of Merit permitted to be worn before the badges of the Order of Canada. Those in the grades of Companion or Officer may wear their badges on a neck ribbon, while those in the Member group display their insignia suspended by a ribbon from a medal bar on the left chest. Protocol originally followed the British tradition, wherein female appointees wore their Order of Canada emblem on a ribbon bow positioned on the left shoulder. These regulations were altered in 1997, and women may wear their insignia in either the traditional manner or in the same fashion as the men.
With the patriation in 1988 of oversight of heraldry from the UK to Canada through the Canadian Heraldic Authority, the constitution of the Order of Canada was amended to include the entitlement of all inductees to petition the Chief Herald of Canada for personal armorial bearings (coats of arms), should they not already possess any. Companions may receive supporters, and all members may have the escutcheon (shield) of their arms encircled with a red ribbon bearing the order&#x27;s motto in gold, and from which is suspended a rendition of the holder&#x27;s Order of Canada badge. The Queen, Sovereign of the Order of Canada, approved the augmentation of her royal arms for Canada with the order&#x27;s ribbon in 1987.

On the grant to Bishop&#x27;s College School, Quebec, the Sovereign&#x27;s insignia of the Order was depicted below the Royal Arms of Canada, the only time the badge has been incorporated into a grant document.

===Possession and sale===
The constitution of the Order of Canada states that the insignia remain property of the Crown, and requires any member of the order to return to the chancellery their original emblem should they be upgraded within the order to a higher rank. Thus, while badges may be passed down as family heirlooms, or loaned or donated for display in museums, they theoretically cannot be sold. However, this has proved impossible to enforce, with several Order of Canada insignia put up for sale over the decades. The first was the Companion&#x27;s badge of M. J. Coldwell, who was appointed in 1967; his badge was sold at auction in 1981, an act that received criticism from government officials.

In 2007, it was revealed that one of the first ever issued insignia of the Order of Canada, a Medal of Service awarded originally to Quebec historian Gustave Lanctot, was put up for sale via e-mail. Originally, the anonymous auctioneer, who had purchased the decoration for $45 at an estate sale in Montreal, attempted to sell the insignia on eBay; however, after the bidding reached $15,000, eBay removed the item, citing its policy against the sale of government property, including &quot;any die, seal or stamp provided by, belonging to, or used by a government department, diplomatic or military authority appointed by or acting under the authority of Her Majesty.&quot; Rideau Hall stated that selling medals was &quot;highly discouraged&quot;; however, the owner continued efforts to sell the insignia via the internet. Five years later, a miniature insignia presented to Tommy Douglas was put on auction in Ontario as part of a larger collection of Douglas artifacts. Douglas&#x27;s daughter, Shirley Douglas, purchased the set for $20,000.

==Eligibility and appointment==

Any of the three levels of the Order of Canada are open to all living Canadian citizens, except all federal and provincial politicians and judges while they hold office. The order recognizes the achievement of outstanding merit or distinguished service by Canadians who made a major difference to Canada through lifelong contributions in every field of endeavour, as well as the efforts made by non-Canadians who have made the world better by their actions. Membership is thus accorded to those who exemplify the order&#x27;s Latin motto, taken from of the Christian Bible, , meaning &quot;they desire a better country.&quot; Each of the six to eight hundred nominations submitted each year, by any person or organization, is received by the order&#x27;s Advisory Council, which, along with the governor general, makes the final choice of new inductees, typically by consensus rather than a vote; a process that, when conceived, was the first of its kind in the world. Appointees are then accepted into the organization at an investiture ceremony typically conducted by the governor general at Rideau Hall, although the monarch or a provincial viceroy may perform the task, and the ceremony may take place in other locations. Since the 1991 investiture of Ted Rogers, Order of Canada installment ceremonies have been broadcast on various television channels and the Internet; recipients are given a complimentary video recording of their investiture ceremony from Rogers Cable.

At certain periods, holders of the order were presented with other awards, usually commemorative medals. Thus far, two commemoratives have been given automatically to every living member of the Order of Canada: the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977 and the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012.

===Advisory council===

The task of the order&#x27;s advisory council is to evaluate the nominations of potential inductees, decide if the candidates are worthy enough to be accepted into the order, and make recommendations to the governor general, who appoints the new members. The council is chaired by the chief justice of Canada, and includes the clerk of the Privy Council, the deputy minister of Canadian Heritage, the chair of the Canada Council for the Arts, the president of the Royal Society of Canada, the chair of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada, and five members of the order who sit on the council for a three-year period. If a nomination involves a non-Canadian citizen, the deputy minister of Foreign Affairs is invited by the Advisory Council to offer evaluation. Decisions of the council and new appointments to and dismissals from the Order of Canada are announced through the &quot;Canada Gazette&quot;.

, the members of the advisory council are:
* Richard Wagner, Chief Justice of Canada (Chair)
* Ewan Affleck
* Susan Aglukark
* John Hannaford, Clerk of the Privy Council and Secretary to the Cabinet
* Sharon Davis-Murdoch
* Marie Yvonne Delorme
* Stephanie Dixon
* Alain-G. Gagnon, President of the Royal Society of Canada
* Daniel Germain
* Karina LeBlanc
* Isabelle Mondou, Deputy Minister of the Department of Canadian Heritage
* Deep Saini, Chair of Universities Canada and President &amp; Vice-Chancellor of McGill University
* Jesse Wente, Chair of the Canada Council for the Arts

===Refusal===
Few have declined entry into the Order of Canada; , 1.5 per cent of offered appointments to the order had been refused. The identities of those individuals who have declined induction since the 1970s are kept confidential, so the full list is not publicly known. Some, however, have spoken openly about their decisions, including Robert Weaver, who stated that he was critical of the &quot;three-tier&quot; nature of the order; Claude Ryan and Morley Callaghan, who both declined the honour in 1967; Mordecai Richler, who twice declined; and Marcel Dubé, Roger Lemelin and Glenn Gould, who all declined in 1970. However, all the above individuals, save for Gould, later did accept appointment into the order. Others have rejected appointment on the basis of being supporters of the Quebec sovereignty movement, such as Luc-André Godbout, Rina Lasnier and Geneviève Bujold, while Alice Parizeau, another supporter of Quebec sovereignty, was criticized for accepting entry into the order despite her beliefs.
Victoria Cross recipient Cecil Meritt cited the fact that he already held Canada&#x27;s highest decoration as a reason not to be admitted to the Order of Canada. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was in 1982 offered appointment to the order as an honorary Companion; however, he refused on the grounds that, as the consort of the Queen, he was a Canadian and thus entitled to a substantive appointment. In 1993, the Advisory Council proposed an amendment to the constitution of the Order of Canada, making the monarch&#x27;s spouse automatically a Companion, but Prince Philip again refused, stating that if he was to be appointed, it should be on his merits. Congruent with these arguments, he in 1988 accepted without issue a substantive induction as a Companion of the Order of Australia. In 2013, the constitution of the Order of Canada was amended in a way that permitted the substantive appointment of Royal Family members and Prince Philip accepted induction as the first extraordinary Companion of the Order of Canada on 26 April 2013. Former Premier of Newfoundland Joseph Smallwood declined appointment as a Companion because he felt that, as a self-proclaimed Father of Confederation, he deserved a knighthood. Smallwood was never knighted and later accepted induction as a Companion.

===Resignation and removal===

Resignations from the order can take place only through prescribed channels, which include the member submitting to the Secretary General of the Order of Canada a letter notifying the chancellery of his or her desire to terminate their membership, and only with the governor general&#x27;s approval can the resignation take effect. On 1 June 2009, the governor general accepted the resignations of astronomer and inventor René Racine, pianist Jacqueline Richard, and Cardinal Jean-Claude Turcotte; on 11 January 2010, the same was done for Renato Giuseppe Bosisio, an engineering professor, and Father Lucien Larré; and on 19 April 2010 for Frank Chauvin. It was also reported that other constituents of the Order of Canada had, in reaction to Henry Morgentaler&#x27;s induction into their ranks, indicated that they would return or had returned their emblems in protest, including organizations such as the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate and Madonna House Apostolate doing so on behalf of deceased former members.

Members may be removed from the order if the Advisory Council feels their actions have brought the order into disrepute. In order for this to be done, the council must agree to take action and then send a letter to the person both telling of the group&#x27;s decision and requesting a response. Anyone removed from the order is required to return their insignia. nine people have been removed from the Order of Canada: Alan Eagleson, who was dismissed after being jailed for fraud in 1998; David Ahenakew, who faced calls for his removal due to antisemitic comments he made in 2002; T. Sher Singh, after the Law Society of Upper Canada found him guilty of professional misconduct and revoked his licence to practise law; Steve Fonyo, due to &quot;his multiple criminal convictions, for which there are no outstanding appeals&quot;; Garth Drabinsky, who was found guilty of fraud and forgery in Ontario and has been a fugitive from American law for related crimes; Conrad Black, who was convicted in the United States in 2007 of fraud and obstruction of justice; Ranjit Chandra, whose scientific work was discredited by allegations of fraud; Johnny Issaluk, following allegations of sexual misconduct; and Buffy Sainte-Marie, after her claims of Indigenous ancestry were reported to be inconsistent with publicly available documents. In 2013, Norman Barwin resigned from the order as a result of the Advisory Council moving forward with his pending removal due to his being found guilty of professional misconduct. 

The Order&#x27;s Advisory Council considered a request made in 2021 for the expulsion of Julie Payette, the 29th Governor General of Canada, from the order. Payette, an Extraordinary Companion, resigned from the viceregal post over allegations of harassment of personnel at Rideau Hall.

===Controversial appointments===
The advisory board attempts to remain apolitical and pragmatic in its approach to selecting new members of the Order of Canada, generally operating without input from ministers of the Crown; political interference has occurred only once, when in 1978 Paul Desmarais&#x27;s investiture was delayed for six months by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. However, some of the committee&#x27;s selections have caused controversy. For instance, the admission in 2001 of sex educator Sue Johanson, host of the long-running &quot;Sunday Night Sex Show&quot;, as a Member stirred controversy among some of Canada&#x27;s Christian organizations, as Johanson had taught teenagers methods of safe sex alongside abstinence. Similarly, the acceptance of birth control advocate Elizabeth Bagshaw and gay rights campaigner Brent Hawkes also incited debate.
Abortion-rights activist Henry Morgentaler&#x27;s appointment to the order on 1 July 2008 not only marked the first time the Advisory Council had not been unanimous in its decision, but also proved to be one of the most controversial appointments in the order&#x27;s history. Opponents of Morgentaler&#x27;s abortion activism organized protests outside of Rideau Hall on 9 July, while compatriots did the same in front of Government House in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, the official residence of that province&#x27;s lieutenant governor.

One former police detective, Frank Chauvin, along with a Catholic anti-abortion activist, filed suit against the Order of Canada Advisory Council, demanding that the minutes of the meeting relating to Morgentaler be made public. The appointment of Morgentaler prompted former Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) Clifford Lincoln to write that the workings of the Advisory Council were &quot;mysterious&quot;, citing what he theorized to be inbuilt partiality and conflict of interest as reasons why Margaret Somerville, whom Lincoln had twice nominated to the Advisory Council, was turned down for appointment, yet Morgentaler was accepted. Journalist Henry Aubin in the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; opined that the council&#x27;s rejection of Somerville, her personal opposition to same-sex marriage, and the acceptance of Brent Hawkes, Jane Rule, and Jean Chrétien, all regarded as supporting same-sex unions, as well as the appointment of a controversial figure such as Morgentaler, were all signs that the Advisory Council operated with partisan bias. Aubin also pointed to the presence on the council of members of the Royal Society of Canada, an organization into which Somerville was received.

Peter Savaryn, a member of the Waffen-SS Galician Division, was awarded the Order of Canada in 1987, for which Governor General of Canada Mary Simon expressed &quot;deep regret&quot; in 2023.

==Proposed amendments==
At a 2006 conference on Commonwealth honours, Christopher McCreery, an expert on Canada&#x27;s honours, raised the concern that the three grades of the Order of Canada were insufficient to recognize the nation&#x27;s very best; one suggestion was to add two more levels to the order, equivalent to knighthoods in British orders. The order of precedence also came under scrutiny, particularly the anomaly that all three grades of the Order of Canada supersede the top levels of each of the other orders (except the Order of Merit), contrary to international practice.

In June 2010, McCreery suggested reforms to the Order of Canada that would avert the awkwardness around appointing members of the Canadian royal family as full members of the order: He theorized that the Queen, as the order&#x27;s Sovereign, could simply appoint, on ministerial advice, anyone as an extra member, or the monarch could issue an ordinance allowing for her relations to be made regular members when approved. Similarly, McCreery proposed that a new division of the order could be established specifically for governors general, their spouses, and members of the royal family, a version of which was adopted in 2013.

<text>The Four Asian Tigers ( the Four Asian Dragons or Four Little Dragons in Chinese and Korean) are the developed Asian economies of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. Between the early 1950s and 1990s, they underwent rapid industrialization and maintained exceptionally high growth rates of more than 7 percent a year.

By the early 21st century, these economies had developed into high-income economies, specializing in areas of competitive advantage. Hong Kong and Singapore have become leading international financial centres, whereas South Korea and Taiwan are leaders in manufacturing electronic components and devices; South Korea has also developed into a major global arms manufacturer. Large institutions have pushed to have them serve as role models for many developing countries, especially the Tiger Cub Economies of Southeast Asia.

In 1993, a World Bank report &quot;The East Asian Miracle&quot; credited neoliberal policies with the economic boom, including the maintenance of export-oriented policies, low taxes and minimal welfare states. Institutional analyses found that some level of state intervention was involved. Some analysts argued that industrial policy and state intervention had a much greater influence than the World Bank report suggested.

==Overview==

Prior to the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the growth of the Four Asian Tiger economies (commonly referred to as &quot;the Asian Miracle&quot;) has been attributed to export oriented policies and strong development policies. Unique to these economies were the sustained rapid growth and high levels of equal income distribution. A World Bank report suggests two development policies among others as sources for the Asian miracle: factor accumulation and macroeconomic management.

The Hong Kong economy was the first out of the four to undergo industrialization with the development of a textile industry in the 1950s. By the 1960s, manufacturing in the British colony had expanded and diversified to include clothing, electronics, and plastics for export orientation. Following Singapore&#x27;s independence from Malaysia, the Economic Development Board formulated and implemented national economic strategies to promote the country&#x27;s manufacturing sector. Industrial estates were set up and foreign investment was attracted to the country with tax incentives. Meanwhile, Taiwan and South Korea began to industrialize in the mid-1960s with heavy government involvement including initiatives and policies. Both countries pursued export-oriented industrialization as in Hong Kong and Singapore. The four countries were inspired by Japan&#x27;s evident success, and they collectively pursued the same goal by investing in the same categories: infrastructure and education. They also benefited from foreign trade advantages that set them apart from other countries, most significantly economic support from the United States; part of this is manifested in the proliferation of American electronic products in common households of the Four Tigers.

By the end of the 1960s, levels in physical and human capital in the four economies far exceeded other countries at similar levels of development. This subsequently led to a rapid growth in per capita income levels. While high investments were essential to their economic growth, the role of human capital was also important. Education in particular is cited as playing a major role in the Asian economic miracle. The levels of education enrollment in the Four Asian Tigers were higher than predicted given their level of income. By 1965, all four nations had achieved universal primary education. South Korea in particular had achieved a secondary education enrollment rate of 88% by 1987. There was also a notable decrease in the gap between male and female enrollments during the Asian miracle. Overall these advances in education allowed for high levels of literacy and cognitive skills.

The creation of stable macroeconomic environments was the foundation upon which the Asian miracle was built. Each of the Four Asian Tiger states managed, to various degrees of success, three variables in: budget deficits, external debt and exchange rates. Each Tiger nation&#x27;s budget deficits were kept within the limits of their financial limits, as to not destabilize the macro-economy. South Korea in particular had deficits lower than the OECD average in the 1980s. External debt was non-existent for Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, as they did not borrow from abroad. Although South Korea was the exception to this – its debt to GNP ratio was quite high during the period 1980–1985, it was sustained by the country&#x27;s high level of exports. Exchange rates in the Four Asian Tiger nations had been changed from long-term fixed rate regimes to fixed-but-adjustable rate regimes with the occasional steep devaluation of managed floating rate regimes. This active exchange rate management allowed the Four Tiger economies to avoid exchange rate appreciation and maintain a stable real exchange rate.

Export policies have been the de facto reason for the rise of these Four Asian Tiger economies. The approach taken has been different among the four nations. Hong Kong, and Singapore introduced trade regimes that were neoliberal in nature and encouraged free trade, while South Korea and Taiwan adopted mixed regimes that accommodated their own export industries. In Hong Kong and Singapore, due to small domestic markets, domestic prices were linked to international prices. South Korea and Taiwan introduced export incentives for the traded-goods sector. The governments of Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan also worked to promote specific exporting industries, which were termed as an export push strategy. All these policies helped these four nations to achieve a growth averaging 7.5% each year for three decades and as such they achieved developed country status.

Dani Rodrik, economist at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, has in a number of studies argued that state intervention was important in the East Asian growth miracle. He has argued &quot;it is impossible to understand the East Asian growth miracle without appreciating the important role that government policy played in stimulating private investment&quot;.

=== 1997 Asian financial crisis ===
The Tiger economies experienced a setback in the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Hong Kong came under intense speculative attacks against its stock market and currency necessitating unprecedented market interventions by the state Hong Kong Monetary Authority. South Korea was hit the hardest as its foreign debt burdens swelled resulting in its currency falling between 35 and 50%. By the beginning of 1997, the stock market in Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea also saw losses of at least 60% in dollar terms. Singapore and Taiwan were relatively unscathed. The Four Asian Tigers recovered from the 1997 crisis faster than other countries due to various economic advantages including their high savings rate (except South Korea) and their openness to trade.

=== 2008 financial crisis ===
The export-oriented tiger economies, which benefited from American consumption, were hit hard by the financial crisis of 2007–08. By the fourth quarter of 2008, the GDP of all four nations fell by an average annualized rate of around 15%.
Exports also fell by a 50% annualized rate.
Weak domestic demand also affected the recovery of these economies. In 2008, retail sales fell 3% in Hong Kong, 6% in Singapore and 11% in Taiwan.

As the world recovered from the financial crisis, the Four Asian Tiger economies have also rebounded strongly. This is due in no small part to each country&#x27;s government fiscal stimulus measures. These fiscal packages accounted for more than 4% of each country&#x27;s GDP in 2009.
Another reason for the strong bounce back is the modest corporate and household debt in these four nations.

A 2011 article published in &quot;Applied Economics Letters&quot; by financial economist Mete Feridun of University of Greenwich Business School and his international colleagues investigates the causal relationship between financial development and economic growth for Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, China, India and Singapore for the period between 1979 and 2009, using Johansen cointegration tests and vector error correction models. The results suggest that in the case of Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, China and India financial development leads to economic growth, whereas in the case of Thailand there exists a bidirectional causality between these variables. The results further suggest that in the case of Malaysia, financial development does not seem to cause economic growth.

== Gross domestic product (GDP) ==
In 2018, the combined economy of the Four Asian Tigers constituted 3.46% of the world&#x27;s economy with a total Gross domestic product (GDP) of 2,932 billion US dollars. The GDP in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan was worth 363.03 billion, 361.1 billion, 1,619.42 billion and 589.39 billion US dollars respectively in 2018, which represented 0.428%, 0.426%, 1.911% and 0.696% of the world economy. Together, their combined economy surpassed the United Kingdom&#x27;s GDP of 3.34% of the world&#x27;s economy some time in the mid-2010s. In 2021, each of the Four Asian Tigers&#x27; GDP Per capita (nominal) exceeds $30,000 according to IMF&#x27;s estimate.


== Education and technology ==
The four governments focused on investing heavily in their infrastructure as well as education to benefit their country through skilled workers and higher level jobs such as engineers and doctors. The policy was generally successful and helped develop the countries into more advanced and high-income industrialized developed countries. For example, all four countries have become global education centers with Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong high school students scoring well on math and science exams such as the PISA exam and with Taiwanese students winning several medals in International Olympiads.

In relation to higher-level education, there are many prestigious colleges as in most developed countries. In the 2023 QS University Rankings, the top 100 universities in the world include 5 universities from Hong Kong, 6 universities from South Korea, 2 from Singapore and 1 from Taiwan. Despite the small populations and the relatively short history of universities in the four countries, they together account for a quarter of the top 100 universities located outside of the United States or the United Kingdom. Notable schools include the National Taiwan University, Chinese University of Hong Kong, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Seoul National University, National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University and University of Hong Kong. The cities of Hong Kong, Singapore and Seoul are prominent hubs in higher education.

== Cultural basis ==
The role of Confucianism has been used to explain the success of the Four Asian Tigers. This conclusion is similar to the Protestant work ethic theory in the West promoted by German sociologist Max Weber in his book &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot;. The culture of Confucianism is said to have been compatible with industrialization because it valued stability, hard work, discipline, and loyalty and respect towards authority figures. There is a significant influence of Confucianism on the corporate and political institutions of the Asian Tigers. Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew advocated Asian values as an alternative to the influence of Western culture in Asia. This theory was not without its critics. There was a lack of mainland Chinese economic success during the same time frame as the Four Tigers, and yet China was the birthplace of Confucianism. During the May Fourth Movement of 1919, Confucianism was blamed for China&#x27;s inability to compete with Western powers.

In 1996, the economist Joseph Stiglitz pointed out that, ironically, &quot;not that long ago, the Confucian heritage, with its emphasis on traditional values, was cited as an explanation for why these countries had not grown.&quot;

<doc id="160115" wikidata="Q7455980" url="?curid=160115" title="Sesame Park">
<text>Sesame Park is the Canadian version of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; co-produced by Sesame Workshop and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

The series originally functioned as a re-edited version of the original American series, and was named Sesame Street Canada and later, Canadian Sesame Street, with some of the segments replaced with ones produced in Canada and later featuring Canadian-exclusive Muppet characters. In 1996, the series adopted a new format and was renamed &quot;Sesame Park&quot;.

==&quot;Canadian Sesame Street&quot;==

Daniel McCarthy, the director of the CBC Sesame Street Project, developed &quot;Sesame Street Canada&quot; for CBC Television. The series, which debuted in 1972, was originally a hybrid of American and Canadian production segments. McCarthy partnered with the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop to introduce new, CBC-produced segments to the show&#x27;s original American footage. He also introduced distinct Canadian themes and set designs to the show.

The series was later titled &quot;Canadian Sesame Street.&quot; During the 1970s and 1980s it anchored a three-show block that included &quot;Friendly Giant&quot; (later replaced by &quot;Fred Penner&#x27;s Place&quot;) and &quot;Mr. Dressup&quot;.

Most of the production of the Canadian segments took place in Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Halifax, and Montreal.

=== Content ===
In 1972, the bulk of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;&#x27;s content was licensed out to CBC Television, originally as five-minute interstitials during commercial breaks. CBC then added live-action and animated segments teaching about Canadian culture and French bilingualism, replacing segments on Spanish and American history on the original program. Some Spanish segments still aired in Canada, although fewer in number and usually related to the show&#x27;s Hispanic main-cast characters, Maria and Luis.

In 1981, the amount of Canadian content per show was increased to 30 minutes.

In 1990 a seasonal special was created for the series, titled Basil Hears A Noise.

=== Characters ===
In 1987, a series of specially made Canadian Muppet characters were introduced, including Basil the Bear, French-Canadian Louis the Otter, and Dodi the bush pilot. The following year, additional new characters included Dr. Bazuki, Fern, Robert, and wheelchair-user Katie.

The Henson Muppet shop also provided some Anything Muppets which could be redressed to become whatever characters the script called for, including Barbara Plum (a parody of CBC broadcasting legend Barbara Frum). Beau Beaver, an animated character, would discuss national symbols, particularly those appearing on Canadian money. In 1994, anchorman Peter Londonbridge and storyteller Margaret Redwood were added to the cast.

=== Messaging ===
The 1987 season focused on multiculturalism, family, and the environment.

==&quot;Sesame Park&quot;==
In 1996, the CBC decided to take on the job of producing different kinds of content for the series; specifically to have their own &quot;street&quot;. Producer Shirley Greenfield and screenwriter Jill Golick decided to set the show in a park, rather than on an urban street. A new half-hour series entitled &quot;Sesame Park&quot; was born. The series premiered in September 1996. It joined the CBC Playground lineup on October 21, along with &quot;Wimzie&#x27;s House&quot;.

The show&#x27;s animated sequences were created in Toronto, while live-action segments were shot in Regina, Vancouver, and Winnipeg.

&quot;Sesame Park&quot; was cancelled in 2001 for undisclosed reasons.

=== Characters ===
Added to the cast were a Muppet kitten named Chaos (who is similar to Elmo, serving the same role, and is named after Golick&#x27;s own cat), and a human character named Ray. Basil was now played by Bob Stutt.

Guest appearances included &quot;Red Green&quot;, a Canadian situation-comedy character played by Steve Smith, Eric Peterson as Old King Cole, and Janet-Laine Green as Goldilocks.

=== Content ===
About sixty percent of the new series was produced in Canada, with the remaining forty percent being segments from Children&#x27;s Television Workshop.

== Awards ==
In 1999, the series received its nomination and win from the Gemini Awards, for Best Preschool Program or Series (Wendy Smith, Susan Sheehan, Duncan Lamb). Bob Stutt was nominated that year for Best Performance in a Preschool Program or Series. In 2000, Sheila McCarthy won Best Performance in a Preschool Program or Series, for her role in an episode of the show, beating out fellow guest star Pier Kohl, as well as others. In 2001, the series won Best Preschool Program or Series (Wendy Smith, Susan Sheehan, Duncan Lamb), beating out &quot;Land O&#x27; Hands&quot; and &quot;The Nook Counting Network&quot;. Guest Eric Peterson won again for Best Performance in a Preschool Program or Series, beating out Pier Kohl, James Rankin, Natasha LaForce and Gisèle Corinthios.

==Legacy==
As with the original &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, some segments of &quot;Canadian Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;Sesame Park&quot; were farmed out to other versions of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, in particular, &quot;Plaza Sésamo&quot;, the Latin American version of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. In addition, since the rise of cable television in Canada in the 1970s (and before that for communities close to the US border), the original American &quot;Sesame Street&quot; could still be viewed on PBS-affiliated stations.

&quot;Sesame Street&quot; now airs on Treehouse TV, a Canadian channel aimed at preschoolers, with specials airing on the Global Television Network, one of Canada’s major terrestrial broadcast networks. Various segments, including &quot;Global Grover&quot; and &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot;, have aired separately on the channel for many years after &quot;Open Sesame&quot;.

<text>Barbara Frum (née Rosberg; September 8, 1937 – March 26, 1992), OC was an American-born Canadian radio and television journalist, acclaimed for her interviews for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

==Personal life==
Barbara Frum was born Barbara Rosberg in Niagara Falls, New York, the oldest of three children of Harold Rosberg and Florence Hirschowitz Rosberg. Her family is Jewish. Frum&#x27;s father, who was born in Kielce, Poland, immigrated to Canada as a child with his parents in 1913, and was the proprietor of Rosberg&#x27;s Department Store in Niagara Falls, Ontario. Frum&#x27;s mother was born in New York City, and moved to Canada in 1935, the year she got married. Frum grew up in Niagara Falls, Ontario. Attending Stamford Collegiate high school, where she was a classmate of Bob McAdorey, Barbara served on the student council. She was also a member of Theta Kappa Sigma, Alpha chapter, her high school sorority. She studied history at the University of Toronto, where she graduated with a BA in 1959. In 1957, she married Toronto dentist Murray Frum, who later became a real-estate developer. They had two children and adopted a third, an Indigenous child, Matthew. Her daughter, Linda Frum, was a Canadian senator and a member of the Canada-Israel Committee, and her son, David Frum became a political journalist and, after he moved to the United States, was a speechwriter for George W. Bush.

==Career==
After her graduation, Frum undertook volunteer work in the community and began writing for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; as a freelancer, specializing in social-issues stories. In 1971, she joined CBC Radio as one of the first hosts of &quot;As It Happens&quot;, a newsmagazine program which used the telephone to conduct live interviews with newsmakers and other witnesses to news events, as well as quirky human-interest stories. Frum&#x27;s skills as a tough, incisive and well-informed interviewer quickly made the program one of CBC Radio&#x27;s most popular and enduring programs (it still airs today, in virtually the same format), and she continued to host until 1981.

Between October 1974 and July 1975, she hosted her own self-titled talk show, first locally broadcast in Toronto until May 1975 before the program moved to the national CBC network for seven shows in June and July 1975. The shows featured both interviews with personalities and special segments devoted to isolated topics.

In 1981, CBC Television created &quot;The Journal&quot;, a newsmagazine series which would follow &quot;The National&quot; each night at 10:22 p.m., and Frum and Mary Lou Finlay were hired as the show&#x27;s hosts. On January 11, 1982, &quot;The Journal&quot; debuted as a showcase for features which delved more deeply into the day&#x27;s news than the traditional newscast format of &quot;The National&quot;.

The show included field reports, short documentaries, public forums, debates, business, sports, and arts and science news, but Frum&#x27;s interviews were the show&#x27;s centrepiece, and made it one of Canadian television&#x27;s most popular programs. After the first year, Frum became the sole host of the program, although Finlay continued to be associated with the program as a reporter and documentarian. Frum interviewed many notable people, including British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Nelson Mandela.

She angered many when, on December 7, 1989, on &quot;The Journal&quot;, she refused to acknowledge that the École Polytechnique massacre, by a killer who proclaimed as he shot and stabbed women, &quot;I hate feminists!&quot; was an attack on women and feminism, saying: &quot;Why do we diminish it by suggesting that it was an act against just one group?&quot;

Frum was frequently parodied on &quot;CODCO&quot; by Greg Malone, whose portrayal involved the recurring catchphrase &quot;But are you bitter?&quot; Frum and Malone (in his Frum drag) also presented a Gemini Award together.

Frum was also the inspiration for the muppet &quot;Barbara Plum&quot;, host of &quot;The Notebook&quot;, on &quot;Canadian Sesame Street&quot; (later reworked as &quot;Sesame Park&quot;). In the episode &quot;The Headline Hunter!&quot; of the Canadian animated series &quot;The Raccoons&quot;, Frum herself portrayed a reporter called &quot;Barbara LaFrum&quot;, who interviewed Cyril Sneer after his pigs told her of his unsavoury business practices.

==Awards and honours==
Frum received four Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists (ACTRA) Awards, won the National Press Club of Canada Award for Outstanding Contribution to Canadian Journalism in 1975, and was named to the Order of Canada in 1979. A library in Toronto, called the Barbara Frum Public Library, is dedicated to her. In late 2022 Ms. Frum was inducted into the Canada Walk of Fame as the most influential woman in Canadian Broadcasting.

==Death and legacy==

Frum died of chronic leukemia on March 26, 1992. Her illness had been first diagnosed in 1974, but only a small circle of family and friends knew about it. On the evening of her death, virtually the entire broadcasts of both &quot;The National&quot; and &quot;The Journal&quot; were tributes to her and retrospectives of her career. Among the many tributes was an editorial cartoon depicting her at the gates of Heaven with a reporter&#x27;s notebook, insisting on interviewing God. Several other editorial cartoons simply depicted &quot;The Journal&quot; set with an empty anchor chair, or Frum likened to a CBC symbol.

She was originally buried at Pardes Shalom Cemetery and was later reinterred at York Cemetery, Toronto, where she is buried with her husband.

Following Frum&#x27;s death, &quot;The National&quot; and &quot;The Journal&quot; were merged into a new program called &quot;Prime Time News&quot;.

The atrium in the CBC&#x27;s Canadian Broadcasting Centre in Toronto, which opened in 1993, is named &quot;Barbara Frum Atrium&quot; in her honour.

The Toronto Public Library branch located at 20 Covington Rd was named in her honour and opened shortly after her death. The building of the library was donated by Murray Frum as part of a redevelopment project, Frum was in the foreground on the Canadian stamp honouring CBC in 1999, a television biography, &quot;The Life and Times of Barbara Frum&quot;, was broadcast on CBC in 2002, and a day lily has been named the &quot;Barbara Frum Day Lily&quot; in recognition of her enthusiasm for gardening.

Frum&#x27;s daughter Linda, a conservative author and journalist, wrote a best-selling biography of her mother in 1996. She was appointed to the Senate of Canada as a Conservative by Prime Minister Stephen Harper in August 2009. Frum&#x27;s son, David, is a political journalist and author of several books. He collaborated with others in coining the phrase &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; while a speechwriter for George W. Bush. Frum&#x27;s adopted son Matthew, a First Nations child whom the Frums adopted in the 1960s during the Sixties Scoop, had problems as a teenager, and ultimately reclaimed his aboriginal roots and renewed contact with his birth parents.

<text>Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates (full title: &quot;Hans Brinker; or, the Silver Skates: A Story of Life in Holland&quot;) is a children&#x27;s novel by American author Mary Mapes Dodge, first published in 1865. The novel takes place in the Netherlands and is a colorful fictional portrait of early 19th-century Dutch life, as well as a tale of youthful honor.

The book&#x27;s title refers to the beautiful silver skates to be awarded to the winner of the ice-skating race Hans Brinker hopes to enter. The novel introduced the sport of Dutch speed skating to Americans, and in U.S. media Hans Brinker is still considered the prototypical speed skater.

The book is also notable for popularizing the story of the little Dutch boy who plugs a dike with his finger.

==Overview==
Mary Mapes Dodge, who never visited the Netherlands until after the novel was published, wrote the novel at age 34. She was inspired by her reading of John L. Motley&#x27;s lengthy, multi-volume history works: &quot;The Rise of the Dutch Republic&quot; (1856), and &quot;History of the United Netherlands&quot; (1860–1867). Dodge subsequently did further bibliographical research into the country. She also received much firsthand information about Dutch life from her immigrant Dutch neighbors, the Scharffs, and Dodge wrote in her preface to the 1875 edition of the book that the story of Hans Brinker&#x27;s father was &quot;founded strictly upon fact&quot;. Even so, many of the story&#x27;s characters have names that are morphologically German rather than Dutch, or are completely obscure. Some editions of the story contain a footnote explaining that &quot;Ludwig, Gretel, and Carl were named after German friends&quot; and correctly giving Lodewijk, Grietje and Karel as the Dutch-language equivalents. Other names that seem fictitious, such as &quot;Voost&quot;, &quot;Broom&quot; or &quot;Rychie&quot;, could be corruptions of existing Dutch forms (in this case &quot;Joost&quot;, &quot;Bram&quot; and &quot;Riekie&quot;). In Dutch editions of the book, names and other elements were adapted to make the story more believable to Dutch children; hence, translator P.J. Andriessen renamed German-sounding &quot;Gretel&quot; to &quot;Griete&quot; in the first Dutch edition of 1867, and Margreet Bruijn changed the main characters&#x27; names to the authentically Dutch regional forms of &quot;Hannes&quot; and &quot;Geertje&quot; in her 1954 adaptation.

Full of Dutch cultural and historical information, the book became an instant bestseller, outselling all other books in its first year of publication except Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;. The novel has since been continuously in print, most often in multiple editions and formats, and remains a children&#x27;s classic.

==Plot==
In Holland, poor but industrious and honorable 15-year-old Hans Brinker and his younger sister Gretel yearn to participate in December&#x27;s great ice skating race on the canal. They have little chance of doing well on their handmade wooden skates, but the prospect of the race and the prize of the silver skates excites them and fires their dreams.

Hans&#x27; father, Raff Brinker, suffered head trauma when he fell from a dike. It left him chronically ill, with episodes of amnesia and occasional violent outbursts, so he is unable to work. Mrs. Brinker, Hans, and Gretel must all work to support the family and are looked down upon in the community because they are poor. By chance, Hans meets the famous surgeon Dr. Boekman and begs him to treat their father, but the doctor&#x27;s fees are expensive and he has been very gruff following the death of his wife and disappearance of his son. Eventually, Dr. Boekman is persuaded to examine Mr. Brinker. He diagnoses pressure on the brain, which can be cured by a risky and expensive operation involving trephining (a surgical intervention in which a hole is drilled or scraped into the human skull). This has been recognized as an early description of chronic subdural hematoma.

Hans earns money to buy Gretel a pair of steel skates for the race. Later, when he earns enough to buy himself a pair of skates, he instead offers the money to Doctor Boekman to pay for his father&#x27;s operation. Touched by this gesture, Dr. Boekman provides the surgery for free, and Hans is able to buy good skates for himself to skate in the race. Hans sacrifices his opportunity to win the boys&#x27; race by dropping out of the race to help a friend win. Gretel wins the girls&#x27; race and the precious prize: the eponymous Silver Skates. 

Mr. Brinker&#x27;s operation is successful, and he is restored to health and memory. Dr. Boekman is also changed, losing his gruff demeanour when he is reunited with his lost son through the unexpected help of Mr. Brinker. The Brinkers&#x27; fortunes are changed further by the almost miraculous recovery of Mr. Brinker&#x27;s savings, which had been thought lost or stolen ten years ago.

The Brinker parents live a long and happy life. Dr. Boekman helps Hans go to medical school, and Hans becomes a successful doctor. Gretel also grows up to enjoy a happy adult life.

==Medical history==
The description of the father&#x27;s medical condition has been recognized as an early description of chronic subdural hematoma.

==Film adaptations==
&quot;Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates&quot; has been adapted into several films and plays, all of which center on the dramatic ice-skating competition as the climax of the story, in keeping with the book. The film adaptations include:

*A 1958 Hallmark Hall of Fame live television musical, &quot;Hans Brinker and the Silver Skates&quot;, directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Tab Hunter as Hans.
*A 1962 made-for-television Disney film, starring Rony Zeaner. Shown in two parts in the U.S. on the Walt Disney anthology television series.
*A 1969 NBC made-for-television musical film, starring Robin Askwith as Hans.
*A 1991 Australian animated television film produced by Burbank Animation Studios.
*A 1998 very loose modern adaptation or homage, &quot;Brink!&quot;, a Disney Channel original movie. The story takes place in Los Angeles, California, and centers on competitive inline skating rather than ice skating. It stars Erik von Detten as Andy &quot;Brink&quot; Brinker.
*A 2020 Russian film, &quot;The Silver Skates&quot;, is a free retelling of the book, the events of the plot take place in the pre-Christmas St. Petersburg of 1899.

==Popular culture: the legend of the boy and the dike==
A short story within the novel has become well known in its own right in popular culture. The story, read aloud in a schoolroom in England, is about a Dutch boy who saves his country by putting his finger in a leaking dike. The boy stays there all night, in spite of the cold, until the villagers find him and repair the dike.

Found in Chapter 18 &quot;Friends in Need&quot;, the boy and the story are called simply &quot;The Hero of Haarlem&quot;. Although the hero of the dike-plugging tale is nameless in the book, Hans Brinker&#x27;s name has sometimes erroneously been associated with the character.

This small tale within &quot;Hans Brinker or The Silver Skates&quot; has generated numerous versions and adaptations in media. American poet Phoebe Cary—at whose New York City literary gatherings Dodge was a regular guest—wrote a lengthy poem about it called &quot;The Leak in the Dike&quot;, published posthumously in 1873, which has been widely anthologized in books of poetry for schoolchildren. Cary also gave the boy a name: Peter.

The tale has also inspired full-fledged children&#x27;s books of its own, which include:

* &quot;The Hole in the Dike&quot;, by Norma Green (1974)
* &quot;The Boy Who Held Back the Sea&quot;, by Lenny Hort (1987)

===Statues of the boy and the dike===
For tourism purposes, statues of the fictional dike-plugging boy have been erected in Dutch locations such as Spaarndam, Madurodam and Harlingen. The statues are sometimes mistakenly titled &quot;Hans Brinker&quot;; others are known as &quot;Peter of Haarlem&quot;. The story of the dike-plugging boy is, however, not widely known in the Netherlands—it is a piece of American, rather than Dutch, folklore.

===Origin of the story of the boy and the dike===
Versions of the story prior to &quot;Hans Brinker&quot; appear in several English-language publications from 1850 onward, including the following British and American publications:

In the United Kingdom:

* An 1850 edition of Sharpe&#x27;s &quot;London Journal of Entertainment and Instruction&quot;: &quot;The Little Hero of Haarlem&quot;
* The February 23, 1850, edition of &quot;Eliza Cook&#x27;s Journal&quot;: &quot;The Brave Little Hollander&quot;
* The 1855 edition of Beeton&#x27;s &quot;Boys&#x27; Own&quot; magazine: &quot;The Little Dutch Hero&quot;
* &quot;The &#x27;Sixth&#x27; Standard Reader&quot;, compiled by J. S. Laurie (1863): &quot;The Little Dutch Hero&quot;

In the U.S.:

* &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, August 1850: &quot;The Little Hero of Haarlem&quot;
* The 1852 edition of &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Repository&quot;: &quot;The Little Hero of Haarlem&quot;
* In 1854, &quot;Literary Gem: Van Court&#x27;s New Monthly Magazine&quot;: &quot;The Little Hero of Haarlem&quot;
* Julia Matilda Olin&#x27;s 1856 book, &quot;A Winter at Wood Lawn&quot;
* In 1857, &quot;McGuffey&#x27;s New High School Reader for Advanced Classes&quot;: &quot;The Little Hero of Haarlem&quot;
* In 1858, &quot;The Rhode Island Schoolmaster&quot;: &quot;The Boy at the Dike&quot;
* In 1858/1859, &quot;Sargent&#x27;s School Monthly&quot;: &quot;The Boy at the Dike&quot;

The actual authorship and genesis of the story of the boy and the dike is probably the story &quot;Le Petit Éclusier&quot; by prolific French children&#x27;s author Eugenie Foa (1796–1852), first published in 1848. This appeared in an English translation by Sarah West Lander, titled &quot;The Little Dykeman&quot; and attributed to Foa, in the monthly magazine &quot;Merry&#x27;s Museum for Boys and Girls&quot; in March 1868.

Although Dodge was not the originator of the story of the boy and the dike, the immense popularity of her novel &quot;Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates&quot; made the story very widely known. The story within a story of the nameless little boy&#x27;s heroism also parallels and emphasizes Hans Brinker&#x27;s own heroism in the novel.

<doc id="160118" wikidata="Q4916085" url="?curid=160118" title="Birds of Australia">
<text>Australia and its offshore islands and territories have 898 recorded bird species as of 2014. Of the recorded birds, 165 are considered vagrant or accidental visitors, of the remainder over 45% are classified as Australian endemics: found nowhere else on earth. It has been suggested that up to 10% of Australian bird species may go extinct by the year 2100 as a result of climate change.

Australian species range from the tiny weebill to the huge, flightless emu. Many species of Australian birds will immediately seem familiar to visitors from the Northern Hemisphere: Australian wrens look and act much like northern wrens, and Australian robins seem to be close relatives of the northern robins. However, the majority of Australian passerines are descended from the ancestors of the crow family, and the close resemblance is misleading: the cause is not genetic relatedness but convergent evolution.

For example, almost any land habitat offers a nice home for a small bird that specialises in finding small insects: the form best fitted to that task is one with long legs for agility and obstacle clearance, moderately-sized wings optimised for quick, short flights, and a large, upright tail for rapid changes of direction. In consequence, the unrelated birds that fill that role in the Americas and in Australia look and act as though they are close relatives.

Australian birds which show convergent evolution with Northern Hemisphere species:
* honeyeaters (resemble sunbirds)
* sittellas (resemble nuthatches)
* Australasian babblers (resemble scimitar babblers)
* Australian robins (resemble Old World chats)
* Scrub robins (resemble thrushes)

==Kinds of birds==
Australian birds can be classified into six categories:
* Old endemics: long-established non-passerines of ultimately Gondwanan origin, notably emus, cassowaries and the huge parrot group
* Corvid radiation: Passerines peculiar to Australasia, descended from the crow family, and now occupying a vast range of roles and sizes; examples include wrens, robins, magpies, thornbills, pardalotes, the huge honeyeater family, treecreepers, lyrebirds, birds-of-paradise and bowerbirds
* Eurasian colonists: later colonists from Eurasia, including plovers, swallows, larks, thrushes, cisticolas, sunbirds and some raptors
* Recent introductions: birds recently introduced by humans; some, such as the European goldfinch and greenfinch, appear to coexist with native fauna; others, such as the common starling, blackbird, house and tree sparrows, and the common myna, are more destructive
* Migratory shorebirds: a suite of waders in the Scolopacidae and Charadriidae families which breed in northern Asia and Alaska and spend the non-breeding season in Australasia
* Seabirds: a large and cosmopolitan group of petrels, albatrosses, sulids, gulls, terns and cormorants, many of which either breed on islands within Australian territory or frequent its coast and territorial waters

<doc id="160121" wikidata="Q529939" url="?curid=160121" title="Fredric Wertham">
<text>Fredric Wertham (; born Friedrich Ignatz Wertheimer, March 20, 1895 – November 18, 1981) was a German–American psychiatrist and author. Wertham had an early reputation as a progressive psychiatrist who treated poor black patients at his Lafargue Clinic at a time of heightened discrimination in urban mental health practice. Wertham also authored a definitive textbook on the brain, and his institutional stressor findings were cited when courts overturned multiple segregation statutes, most notably in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education.&quot;

Despite this, Wertham remains best known for his concerns about the effects of violent imagery in mass media and the effects of comic books on the development of children. His best-known book is &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; (1954), which asserted that comic books caused youth to become delinquents. Besides &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot;, Wertham also wrote articles and testified before government inquiries into comic books, most notably as part of a U.S. Congressional inquiry into the comic book industry. Wertham&#x27;s work, in addition to the 1954 comic book hearings, led to the creation of the Comics Code Authority, although later scholars cast doubt on his observations. 

==Early life==
Wertham was born Friedrich Ignatz Wertheimer on March 20, 1895, in Nuremberg to the middle-class Jewish family of Sigmund and Mathilde Wertheimer. Ella Winter (originally Wertheimer) was a relative. He did not change his name legally to Fredric Wertham until 1927. He studied at King&#x27;s College London, at the Universities of Munich and Erlangen, and graduated with an M.D. degree from the University of Würzburg in 1921. He was very much influenced by Dr. Emil Kraepelin, a professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of Munich, and worked briefly at the Kraepelin Clinic in Munich in 1922. Kraepelin emphasized the effects of environment and social background on psychological development. Around this time Wertham corresponded and visited with Sigmund Freud, who influenced him in his choice of psychiatry as his specialty.

==Career==
In 1922, he accepted an invitation to come to the United States and work under Adolf Meyer at the Phipps Psychiatric Clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. He became a United States citizen and married the sculptor Florence Hesketh in 1927. He moved to New York City in 1932 to accept a senior staff position at the Bellevue Mental Hygiene Clinic, the psychiatric clinic connected with the New York Court of General Sessions in which all convicted felons received a psychiatric examination that was used in court. In 1935 he testified for the defense in the trial of cannibalistic child rapist and serial killer Albert Fish, declaring him insane. In 1946, Wertham opened the Lafargue Clinic in the basement of St. Philip&#x27;s Church in Harlem, a low-cost psychiatric clinic specializing in the treatment of Black teenagers. The clinic was financed by voluntary contributions.

===&quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; and Senate hearings===
&quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; described overt or covert depictions of violence, sex, drug use, and other adult fare within &quot;crime comics&quot;—a term Wertham used to describe not only the popular gangster/murder-oriented titles of the time but also superhero and horror comics as well—and asserted, based largely on undocumented anecdotes, that reading this material encouraged similar behavior in children.

Comics, especially the crime/horror titles pioneered by EC Comics, were not lacking in gruesome images; Wertham reproduced these extensively, pointing out what he saw as recurring morbid themes such as &quot;injury to the eye&quot; (as depicted in &quot;Plastic Man&quot; creator Jack Cole&#x27;s &quot;Murder, Morphine and Me&quot;, which he illustrated and probably wrote for publisher Magazine Village&#x27;s &quot;True Crime Comics&quot; No. 2 (May 1947); it involved drug dealing protagonist Mary Kennedy nearly getting stabbed in the eye &quot;by a junkie with a hypodermic needle&quot; in her dream sequence). 

Many of his other conjectures, particularly about hidden sexual themes (e.g. images of female nudity concealed in drawings of muscles and tree bark, or Batman and Robin as gay lovers), were met with skepticism from his fellow mental health professionals, but found an audience in those concerned with &quot;public morals&quot;, such as Senator Estes Kefauver, who had Wertham testify before the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency, which he led.

In extensive testimony before the committee, Wertham restated arguments from his book and pointed to comics as a major cause of juvenile crime. Beaty notes &quot;Wertham repeated his call ... [for] national legislation based on the public health ideal that would prohibit the circulation and display of comic books to children under the age of fifteen.&quot; The committee&#x27;s questioning of their next witness, EC publisher William Gaines, focused on violent scenes of the type Wertham had decried. Though the committee&#x27;s final report did not blame comics for crime, it recommended that the comics industry tone down its content voluntarily; possibly taking this as a veiled threat of potential censorship, publishers developed the Comics Code Authority to censor their own content. The Code banned not only violent images but also entire words and concepts (e.g. &quot;terror&quot; and &quot;zombies&quot;) and dictated that criminals must always be punished—thus destroying most EC-style titles, and leaving a sanitized subset of superhero comics as the chief remaining genre.

Citing one of Wertham&#x27;s arguments, that 95% of children in reform school read comics proves that comics cause juvenile delinquency (an example of the well-known logical fallacy correlation implies causation), Stan Lee recounted that Wertham &quot;said things that impressed the public, and it was like shouting fire in a theater, but there was little scientific validity to it. And yet because he had the name doctor people took what he said seriously, and it started a whole crusade against comics.&quot;

&quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; also analyzed the advertisements that appeared in 1950s comic books and the commercial context in which these publications existed. Wertham objected to not only the violence in the stories but also the fact that air rifles and knives were advertised alongside them. Wertham claimed that retailers who did not want to sell material with which they were uncomfortable, such as horror comics, were essentially held to ransom by the distributors. According to Wertham, news vendors were told by the distributors that if they did not sell the objectionable comic books, they would not be allowed to sell any of the other publications being distributed. Also in 1954, Wertham was the Court&#x27;s appointed psychiatric expert in the trial of the Brooklyn Thrill Killers. When the gang&#x27;s 18-year-old leader admitted that he had read simply comic books, Wertham concluded that the books were to blame for his crimes.

===Later career===
Wertham&#x27;s views on mass media have largely overshadowed his broader concerns with violence and with overprotecting children from psychological harm. His writings about the effects of racial segregation were used as evidence in the landmark Supreme Court case &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, and part of his 1966 book &quot;A Sign for Cain&quot; dealt with the involvement of medical professionals in the Holocaust. To promote this book, Wertham made two memorable appearances on the &quot;Mike Douglas Show&quot; where he ended up debating his theories with the co-hosts, Barbara Feldon (April 10, 1967) and Vincent Price (June 19, 1967). Excerpts were shown at the 2003 San Diego Comic-Con.

University of Calgary professor Bart Beaty, the only person allowed access to Wertham&#x27;s personal papers before they were unsealed in 2010, reveals that Wertham tried in 1959 to sell a follow-up to &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; concerning the effects of television on children, to be titled &quot;The War on Children&quot;. Much to Wertham&#x27;s frustration, no publishers were interested in publishing it.

Wertham always denied that he favored censorship or had anything against comic books in principle, and in the 1970s he focused his interest on the benign aspects of the comic fandom subculture; in his last book, &quot;The World of Fanzines&quot; (1974), he concluded that fanzines were &quot;a constructive and healthy exercise of creative drives&quot;. This led to an invitation for Wertham to address the New York Comic Art Convention. Still infamous to most comics fans of the time, Wertham encountered suspicion and heckling at the convention, and stopped writing about comics thereafter.

Before retirement he became a professor of psychiatry at New York University, a senior psychiatrist in the New York City Department of Hospitals, and a psychiatrist and the director of the Mental Hygiene Clinic at the Bellevue Hospital Center.

===Death===
Wertham died on November 18, 1981, at his retirement home in Kempton, Pennsylvania, at age 86.

== Accusations of falsified data ==
After Wertham&#x27;s manuscript collection at the Library of Congress was unsealed in 2010, Carol Tilley, a University of Illinois librarian and information science professor, investigated his research and found his conclusions to be largely baseless. In a 2012 study, Tilley wrote &quot;Wertham manipulated, overstated, compromised, and fabricated evidence—especially that evidence he attributed to personal clinical research with young people—for rhetorical gain.&quot;

Among the criticisms leveled at &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; are that Wertham used a non-representative sample of young people who were already mentally troubled, that he misrepresented stories from colleagues as being his own, and that Wertham manipulated statements from adolescents by deliberately neglecting some passages while rephrasing others such that they better suited his thesis.

==Legacy==
Wertham&#x27;s papers (including the manuscript to the unpublished &quot;The War on Children&quot;) were donated to the Library of Congress and are held by the Manuscript Division. They were made available for use by scholars for research on May 20, 2010. A register of the papers has been prepared that displays the eclectic reach of Wertham&#x27;s interests.

In 2014, documentary filmmaker Robert A. Emmons Jr. produced the documentary &quot;Diagram for Delinquents&quot;, which details the complicated and controversial history of Fredric Wertham and comic books in the 1940s and 1950s. The film&#x27;s goal was to create a more complex picture of Wertham than what had previously been depicted in comic book documentaries.

His activism was cited in the 2011 US supreme court decision &quot;Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association&quot;.

Wertham was satirized as a Dr. Bertham who was kidnapped and turned into a monster by a mad scientist in Seaboard&#x27;s &quot;Brute&quot; No. 2 (April 1975).

Issue No. 1 of Bongo Comics&#x27; &quot;Radioactive Man&quot; shows comics from a young boy&#x27;s collection that satirize Wertham&#x27;s negative view of comic books. These include &quot;Crime Does Pay&quot; (violence and gore); &quot;Headlights&quot; (women with ludicrously pointed breasts); &quot;Stab&quot; (pathological fixation on eye injuries); and &quot;Tales of Revolting Filth&quot; (pretty much subsuming every other category). Wertham himself is also parodied in the issue.

According to the supplementary material of the HBO series &quot;Watchmen&quot;, within that fictional universe Fredric Wertham created a system for cataloging the mental states of costumed adventurers.

The character of Doctor Fredreich &quot;Werthers&quot; on the last season of the CW show &quot;Riverdale&quot; is based on Wertham.

Wertham makes an appearance in the fifth book of Dav Pilkey&#x27;s &quot;Cat Kid Comic Club&quot; series in the short comic book &quot;I Am Dr. Fredric Wertham&quot; written by the character Melvin.

<doc id="160125" wikidata="Q935710" url="?curid=160125" title="Mitochondrial disease">
<text>Mitochondrial disease is a group of disorders caused by mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondria are the organelles that generate energy for the cell and are found in every cell of the human body except red blood cells. They convert the energy of food molecules into the ATP that powers most cell functions.

Mitochondrial diseases take on unique characteristics both because of the way the diseases are often inherited and because mitochondria are so critical to cell function. A subclass of these diseases that have neuromuscular symptoms are known as mitochondrial myopathies.

== Types ==

Mitochondrial disease can manifest in many different ways whether in children or adults. Examples of mitochondrial diseases include:
* Mitochondrial myopathy
* Maternally inherited diabetes mellitus and deafness (MIDD)
** While diabetes mellitus and deafness can be found together for other reasons, at an early age this combination can be due to mitochondrial disease, as may occur in Kearns–Sayre syndrome and Pearson syndrome 
* Leber&#x27;s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON)
**LHON is an eye disorder characterized by progressive loss of central vision due to degeneration of the optic nerves and retina (apparently affecting between 1 in 30,000 and 1 in 50,000 people); visual loss typically begins in young adulthood
* Leigh syndrome, subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy
** after normal development the disease usually begins late in the first year of life, although onset may occur in adulthood
** a rapid decline in function occurs and is marked by seizures, altered states of consciousness, dementia, ventilatory failure
* Neuropathy, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, and ptosis (NARP)
** progressive symptoms as described in the acronym
** dementia
* Myoneurogenic gastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE)
** gastrointestinal pseudo-obstruction
** neuropathy
* MERRF syndrome
** progressive myoclonic epilepsy
** &quot;Ragged Red Fibers&quot; are clumps of diseased mitochondria that accumulate in the subsarcolemmal region of the muscle fiber and appear when muscle is stained with modified Gömöri trichrome stain
** short stature
** hearing loss
** lactic acidosis
** exercise intolerance
* MELAS syndrome, mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes
* Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome

&quot;Conditions such as Friedreich&#x27;s ataxia can affect the mitochondria but are not associated with mitochondrial proteins.&quot;

==Presentation==
===Associated conditions===
Acquired conditions in which mitochondrial dysfunction has been involved include:
* ALS
* Alzheimer&#x27;s disease,
* Bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, aging and senescence, anxiety disorders
* Cancer
* Cardiovascular disease
* Diabetes
* Huntington&#x27;s disease
* Long Covid
* ME/CFS
* Parkinson&#x27;s disease
* Sarcopenia

The body, and each mutation, is modulated by other genome variants; the mutation that in one individual may cause liver disease might in another person cause a brain disorder. The severity of the specific defect may also be great or small. Some defects include exercise intolerance. Defects often affect the operation of the mitochondria and multiple tissues more severely, leading to multi-system diseases.

It has also been reported that drug tolerant cancer cells have an increased number and size of mitochondria, which suggested an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis. A recent study in &quot;Nature Nanotechnology&quot; has reported that cancer cells can hijack the mitochondria from immune cells via physical tunneling nanotubes.

As a rule, mitochondrial diseases are worse when the defective mitochondria are present in the muscles, cerebrum, or nerves, because these cells use more energy than most other cells in the body.

Although mitochondrial diseases vary greatly in presentation from person to person, several major clinical categories of these conditions have been defined, based on the most common phenotypic features, symptoms, and signs associated with the particular mutations that tend to cause them.

An outstanding question and area of research is whether ATP depletion or reactive oxygen species are in fact responsible for the observed phenotypic consequences.

Cerebellar atrophy or hypoplasia has sometimes been reported to be associated.

==Causes==
Mitochondrial disorders may be caused by mutations (acquired or inherited), in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), or in nuclear genes that code for mitochondrial components. They may also be the result of acquired mitochondrial dysfunction due to adverse effects of drugs, infections, or other environmental causes.
Nuclear DNA has two copies per cell (except for sperm and egg cells), one copy being inherited from the father and the other from the mother. Mitochondrial DNA, however, is inherited from the mother only (with some exceptions) and each mitochondrion typically contains between 2 and 10 mtDNA copies. During cell division the mitochondria segregate randomly between the two new cells. Those mitochondria make more copies, normally reaching 500 mitochondria per cell. As mtDNA is copied when mitochondria proliferate, they can accumulate random mutations, a phenomenon called heteroplasmy. If only a few of the mtDNA copies inherited from the mother are defective, mitochondrial division may cause most of the defective copies to end up in just one of the new mitochondria (for more detailed inheritance patterns, see human mitochondrial genetics). Mitochondrial disease may become clinically apparent once the number of affected mitochondria reaches a certain level; this phenomenon is called &quot;threshold expression&quot;.

Mitochondria possess many of the same DNA repair pathways as nuclei do—but not all of them; therefore, mutations occur more frequently in mitochondrial DNA than in nuclear DNA (see Mutation rate). This means that mitochondrial DNA disorders may occur spontaneously and relatively often. Defects in enzymes that control mitochondrial DNA replication (all of which are encoded for by genes in the nuclear DNA) may also cause mitochondrial DNA mutations.

Most mitochondrial function and biogenesis is controlled by nuclear DNA. Human mitochondrial DNA encodes 13 proteins of the respiratory chain, while most of the estimated 1,500 proteins and components targeted to mitochondria are nuclear-encoded. Defects in nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes are associated with hundreds of clinical disease phenotypes including anemia, dementia, hypertension, lymphoma, retinopathy, seizures, and neurodevelopmental disorders.

A study by Yale University researchers (published in the February 12, 2004, issue of the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot;) explored the role of mitochondria in insulin resistance among the offspring of patients with type 2 diabetes.
Other studies have shown that the mechanism may involve the interruption of the mitochondrial signaling process in body cells (intramyocellular lipids). A study conducted at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana showed that this, in turn, partially disables the genes that produce mitochondria.

==Mechanisms==

The effective overall energy unit for the available body energy is referred to as the daily glycogen generation capacity, and is used to compare the mitochondrial output of affected or chronically glycogen-depleted individuals to healthy individuals. 

The glycogen generation capacity is entirely dependent on, and determined by, the operating levels of the mitochondria in all of the cells of the human body; however, the relation between the energy generated by the mitochondria and the glycogen capacity is very loose and is mediated by many biochemical pathways. The energy output of full healthy mitochondrial function can be predicted exactly by a complicated theoretical argument, but this argument is not straightforward, as most energy is consumed by the brain and is not easily measurable.

== Diagnosis ==
Mitochondrial diseases are usually detected by analysing muscle samples, where the presence of these organelles is higher. The most common tests for the detection of these diseases are:
# Southern blot to detect large deletions or duplications
# Polymerase chain reaction and specific mutation testing
# Sequencing

==Treatments==
Although research is ongoing, treatment options are currently limited; vitamins are frequently prescribed, though the evidence for their effectiveness is limited.
Pyruvate has been proposed in 2007 as a treatment option. N-acetyl cysteine reverses many models of mitochondrial dysfunction. 

=== Mood disorders ===
In the case of mood disorders, specifically bipolar disorder, it is hypothesized that N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR), S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), creatine monohydrate (CM), and melatonin could be potential treatment options.

===Gene therapy prior to conception===
Mitochondrial replacement therapy (MRT), where the nuclear DNA is transferred to another healthy egg cell leaving the defective mitochondrial DNA behind, is an IVF treatment procedure. Using a similar pronuclear transfer technique, researchers at Newcastle University led by Douglass Turnbull successfully transplanted healthy DNA in human eggs from women with mitochondrial disease into the eggs of women donors who were unaffected. In such cases, ethical questions have been raised regarding biological motherhood, since the child receives genes and gene regulatory molecules from two different women. Using genetic engineering in attempts to produce babies free of mitochondrial disease is controversial in some circles and raises important ethical issues. A male baby was born in Mexico in 2016 from a mother with Leigh syndrome using MRT.

In September 2012 a public consultation was launched in the UK to explore the ethical issues involved. Human genetic engineering was used on a small scale to allow infertile women with genetic defects in their mitochondria to have children. 
In June 2013, the United Kingdom government agreed to develop legislation that would legalize the &#x27;three-person IVF&#x27; procedure as a treatment to fix or eliminate mitochondrial diseases that are passed on from mother to child. The procedure could be offered from 29 October 2015 once regulations had been established.
Embryonic mitochondrial transplant and protofection have been proposed as a possible treatment for inherited mitochondrial disease, and allotopic expression of mitochondrial proteins as a radical treatment for mtDNA mutation load.

In June 2018 Australian Senate&#x27;s Senate Community Affairs References Committee recommended a move towards legalising Mitochondrial replacement therapy (MRT). Research and clinical applications of MRT were overseen by laws made by federal and state governments. State laws were, for the most part, consistent with federal law. In all states, legislation prohibited the use of MRT techniques in the clinic, and except for Western Australia, research on a limited range of MRT was permissible up to day 14 of embryo development, subject to a license being granted. In 2010, the Hon. Mark Butler MP, then Federal Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, had appointed an independent committee to review the two relevant acts: the &quot;Prohibition of Human Cloning for Reproduction Act 2002&quot; and the &quot;Research Involving Human Embryos Act 2002&quot;. The committee&#x27;s report, released in July 2011, recommended the existing legislation remain unchanged

Currently, human clinical trials are underway at GenSight Biologics (ClinicalTrials.gov # NCT02064569) and the University of Miami (ClinicalTrials.gov # NCT02161380) to examine the safety and efficacy of mitochondrial gene therapy in Leber&#x27;s hereditary optic neuropathy.

==Epidemiology==
About 1 in 4,000 children in the United States will develop mitochondrial disease by the age of 10 years. Up to 4,000 children per year in the US are born with a type of mitochondrial disease. Because mitochondrial disorders contain many variations and subsets, some particular mitochondrial disorders are very rare.

The average number of births per year among women at risk for transmitting mtDNA disease is estimated to approximately 150 in the United Kingdom and 800 in the United States.

==History==
The first pathogenic mutation in mitochondrial DNA was identified in 1988; from that time to 2016, around 275 other disease-causing mutations were identified.

==Notable cases==
Notable people with mitochondrial disease include:
* Mattie Stepanek, a poet, peace advocate, and motivational speaker who had dysautonomic mitochondrial myopathy, and who died at age 13.
* Rocco Baldelli, a coach and former center fielder in Major League Baseball who had to retire from active play at age 29 due to mitochondrial channelopathy.
* Charlie Gard, a British boy who had mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome; decisions about his care were taken to various law courts.
* Charles Darwin, a nineteenth century naturalist who suffered from a disabling illness, is speculated to have MELAS syndrome.

<text>Catherine Élise Blanchett ( ; born 14 May 1969) is an Australian actor and producer. Regarded as one of the best performers of her generation, she is recognised for her versatile work across independent films, blockbusters, and the stage. Blanchett has received numerous accolades, including two Academy Awards, four British Academy Film Awards, and four Golden Globe Awards, in addition to nominations for two Primetime Emmy Awards and a Tony Award.

A graduate of the National Institute of Dramatic Art, Blanchett began her career on the Australian stage in 1992 and made her feature film debut in 1997. She came to international prominence for her performance as Queen Elizabeth I in the period drama &quot;Elizabeth&quot; (1998), for which she received her first Academy Award nomination. She won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Katharine Hepburn in the biopic &quot;The Aviator&quot; (2004), and Best Actress for playing a neurotic former socialite in the comedy-drama &quot;Blue Jasmine&quot; (2013). Her other Oscar-nominated roles were in &quot;Notes on a Scandal&quot; (2006), &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot; (2007), &quot;&quot; (2007), &quot;Carol&quot; (2015), and &quot;Tár&quot; (2022), making her the most-nominated Australian. Her biggest commercial successes include &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy (2001–2003), &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; (2008), &quot;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&quot; (2008), &quot;Cinderella&quot; (2015), &quot;&quot; (2017), &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 8&quot; (2018), and &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Up&quot; (2021).

Blanchett has performed in over twenty stage productions. She and her husband, Andrew Upton, were the artistic directors of the Sydney Theatre Company from 2008 to 2013. Some of her stage roles during this period were in revivals of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, &quot;Big and Little&quot; and &quot;The Maids&quot;. She made her Broadway debut in 2017 in &quot;The Present&quot;, for which she was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. She has also produced and starred in the FX on Hulu miniseries &quot;Mrs. America&quot; (2020), in which she portrayed Phyllis Schlafly, and the Apple TV+ miniseries &quot;Disclaimer&quot; (2024). 

Blanchett is the recipient of several honorary awards. The Australian government awarded her the Centenary Medal in 2001, and she was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2017. In 2012, she was appointed Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French government. Blanchett was honoured by the Museum of Modern Art and received the British Film Institute Fellowship in 2015. &quot;Time&quot; named her one of its 100 most influential people in the world in 2007. In 2018, she was ranked among the world&#x27;s highest-paid actresses. She also received honorary Doctor of Letters degrees from the University of New South Wales, University of Sydney and Macquarie University.

==Early life and education==
Catherine Élise Blanchett was born on 14 May 1969 in the Melbourne suburb of Ivanhoe. Her Australian mother, June (née Gamble), was a property developer and teacher; and her American father, Robert DeWitt Blanchett Jr., a Texas native, was a United States Navy Chief Petty Officer who became an advertising executive. They met when Robert&#x27;s ship broke down in Melbourne. When Blanchett was ten, her father died of a heart attack, leaving her mother to raise the family. Blanchett is the second of three children, with an older brother and younger sister. Her ancestry includes English, some Scottish, and remote French roots.

Blanchett has described herself as a &quot;part extrovert, part wallflower&quot; child. During her teenage years she had a penchant for dressing in traditionally masculine clothing, and went through goth and punk phases, at one point shaving her head. She attended primary school in Melbourne at Ivanhoe East Primary School; for her secondary education, she attended Ivanhoe Girls&#x27; Grammar School and then Methodist Ladies&#x27; College, where she explored her passion for the performing arts. In her late teens and early twenties, she worked at a nursing home in Victoria. After high school, she began a Bachelor of business administration at the University of Melbourne. While in Egypt, Blanchett was asked to be an extra as an American cheerleader in the Egyptian boxing film &quot;Kaboria&quot; (1990); in need of money, she accepted the job. On returning to Australia, she moved to Sydney and enrolled at the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), graduating in 1992 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts.

==Career==

===1992–2000: Early work and international breakthrough===
Blanchett&#x27;s first stage role was opposite Geoffrey Rush, in the 1992 David Mamet play &quot;Oleanna&quot; for the Sydney Theatre Company. That year, she was also cast as Clytemnestra in a production of &quot;Sophocles&#x27; Electra&quot;. A couple of weeks after rehearsals, the actress playing the title role pulled out, and director Lindy Davies cast Blanchett in the role. Her performance as Electra became one of her most acclaimed at NIDA. In 1993, Blanchett was awarded the Sydney Theatre Critics&#x27; Best Newcomer Award for her performance in Timothy Daly&#x27;s &quot;Kafka Dances&quot; and won Best Actress for her performance in Mamet&#x27;s &quot;Oleanna&quot;, making her the first actor to win both categories in the same year. Blanchett played the role of Ophelia in a 1994–1995 Company B production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; directed by Neil Armfield, starring Rush and Richard Roxburgh, and was nominated for a Green Room Award.

Blanchett&#x27;s first screen appearance was in the 1994 TV miniseries &quot;Heartland&quot; opposite Ernie Dingo, and she went on to appear in the miniseries &quot;Bordertown&quot; (1995) with Hugo Weaving, and in an episode of &quot;Police Rescue&quot; entitled &quot;The Loaded Boy&quot;. She also appeared in the 50-minute drama short film &quot;Parklands&quot; (1996), which received an Australian Film Institute (AFI) nomination for Best Original Screenplay.

Blanchett made her feature film debut with a supporting role as an Australian nurse captured by the Japanese Army during World War II, in Bruce Beresford&#x27;s film &quot;Paradise Road&quot; (1997), which co-starred Glenn Close and Frances McDormand. The film made just over $2 million at the box office on a budget of $19 million and received mixed reviews from critics. Her first leading role came later that year as eccentric heiress Lucinda Leplastrier in Gillian Armstrong&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Oscar and Lucinda&quot; (1997), opposite Ralph Fiennes. Blanchett received wide acclaim for her performance, with Emanuel Levy of &quot;Variety&quot; declaring, &quot;luminous newcomer Blanchett, in a role originally intended for Judy Davis, is bound to become a major star&quot;. She earned her first AFI Award nomination as Best Leading Actress for &quot;Oscar and Lucinda&quot;. She won the AFI Best Actress Award in the same year for her starring role as Lizzie in the romantic comedy &quot;Thank God He Met Lizzie&quot; (1997), co-starring Richard Roxburgh and Frances O&#x27;Connor.

Blanchett&#x27;s played a young Elizabeth I in the historical drama &quot;Elizabeth&quot; (1998), directed by Shekhar Kapur. The film catapulted her to international prominence, earning her the Golden Globe Award and British Academy Award (BAFTA), and her first Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. In his review for &quot;Variety&quot;, critic David Rooney wrote of her performance, &quot;Blanchett conveys with grace, poise and intelligence that Elizabeth was a wily, decisive, advanced thinker, far too aware of her own exceptional nature to bow to any man. [She] builds the juicy character almost imperceptibly from a smart but wary young woman who may be in over her head into a powerful creature of her own invention.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Blanchett&#x27;s performance &quot;brings spirit, beauty and substance to what otherwise might have been turned into a vacuous role&quot;, and Alicia Potter writing for the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; stated that, &quot;In the end, Kapur&#x27;s crown jewel is a tale of twin transformations, that of Elizabeth into one of history&#x27;s most enigmatic and powerful women, and that of Blanchett into, well, a bona fide screen queen.&quot;

The following year, Blanchett appeared in &quot;Bangers&quot; (1999), an Australian short film and part of &quot;Stories of Lost Souls&quot;, a compilation of thematically related short stories. The short was written and directed by her husband, Andrew Upton, and produced by Blanchett and Upton. She also appeared in the Mike Newell comedy &quot;Pushing Tin&quot; (1999), with her performance singled out by critics, and the critically acclaimed and financially successful film &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; (1999), alongside Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. She received her second BAFTA nomination for her performance as Meredith Logue in &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;.

=== 2001–2007: &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and established actor ===
Blanchett appeared in Peter Jackson&#x27;s blockbuster trilogy, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, playing the role of elf leader Galadriel in all three films. The trilogy was a major critical and financial success, earning $2.981 billion at the box office worldwide, and all three films were later ranked within the top 10 greatest fantasy movies of all time in a poll conducted by American magazine &quot;Wired&quot; in 2012. In addition to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, 2001 also saw Blanchett diversify her portfolio with a range of roles in the dramas &quot;Charlotte Gray&quot; and &quot;The Shipping News&quot; and the American crime-comedy &quot;Bandits&quot;, for which she earned a second Golden Globe and SAG Award nomination. &quot;Bandits&quot; marked Blanchett&#x27;s first notable foray into the comedy genre, with Ben Falk of the BBC declaring her and co-star Billy Bob Thornton &quot;a real find as comedians&quot; and calling her performance as an unsatisfied housewife caught between two escaped convicts, &quot;unhinged, though undeniably sexy&quot;.

In 2002, Blanchett starred opposite Giovanni Ribisi in Tom Tykwer-directed &quot;Heaven&quot;, the first film in an unfinished trilogy by writer-director Krzysztof Kieślowski. Her performance in the film as a grieving woman who commits a desperate act of terrorism was highly praised, with Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; calling it, &quot;the most compelling screen performance of her career&quot; and going on to state, &quot;Although Ms. Blanchett face has always registered emotion with a mercurial fluidity, the immediacy of feeling she conveys in &quot;Heaven&quot; is astonishing.&quot; 2003 saw Blanchett again playing a wide range of roles: Galadriel in the third and final instalment of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy (which won the Academy Award for Best Picture); the Ron Howard-directed western thriller &quot;The Missing&quot;; Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Coffee and Cigarettes&quot;, playing two roles (both against herself), for which she received an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female nomination; and the biographical &quot;Veronica Guerin&quot;, which earned her a Golden Globe Best Actress Drama nomination. In 2004, Blanchett portrayed a pregnant journalist chronicling an underwater voyage by an eccentric oceanographer in Wes Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot;.

Blanchett won her first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 2005, for her highly acclaimed portrayal of Katharine Hepburn in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Aviator&quot; (2004). This made Blanchett the first actor in history to win an Academy Award for portraying another Academy Award-winning actor. She lent her Oscar statuette to the Australian Centre for the Moving Image. In his review for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, David Ansen wrote that Blanchett portrayed Hepburn with &quot;lip-smacking vivacity&quot;, and Roger Ebert lauded the performance, describing it as &quot;delightful and yet touching; mannered and tomboyish&quot;. During her preparation for the role, and at the request of Scorsese, Blanchett reviewed 35-millimetre prints of all of Hepburn&#x27;s first 15 screen performances to study and memorise her poise, mannerisms and speech pattern. Blanchett spoke of the responsibility of portraying such an iconic star, stating, &quot;Representing Kate in the same medium, film, in which she existed was very daunting. But because she was so private and few people really knew her, we basically know Hepburn through her films. So of course you have to give a nod to her screen persona when playing her.&quot; That year, Blanchett also won the Australian Film Institute Best Actress Award for her performance as Tracy Heart, a former heroin addict, in the Australian film &quot;Little Fish&quot; (2005), co-produced by her and her husband&#x27;s production company, Dirty Films. Though lesser known globally than some of her other films, the sober and sensitive &quot;Little Fish&quot; received great critical acclaim in Blanchett&#x27;s native Australia and was nominated for 13 Australian Film Institute awards.

In 2006, Blanchett portrayed Hedda Gabler at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in the Sydney Theatre Company production of &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;, directed by Robyn Nevin. She then starred opposite Brad Pitt in Alejandro González Iñárritu&#x27;s multi-lingual, multi-narrative drama &quot;Babel&quot;, as one half of a grieving couple who get caught up in an international incident in Morocco. &quot;Babel&quot; received seven Academy Award nominations. She also co-starred in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s World War II-era drama &quot;The Good German&quot; with George Clooney, and the psychological thriller &quot;Notes on a Scandal&quot; opposite Dame Judi Dench. Blanchett received a third Academy Award nomination for her performance in the latter film, where she portrays a lonely teacher who embarks on an affair with a 15-year-old student and becomes the object of obsession for an older woman played by Dench. Both Blanchett&#x27;s and Dench&#x27;s performances were highly acclaimed, with Peter Bradshaw writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Director Richard Eyre, with unshowy authority, gets the best out of Dench and Blanchett and, with great shrewdness, elicits from these two actors all the little tensions and exasperations - as well as the genuine tenderness - in their tragically fraught relationship.&quot;

In 2007, Blanchett was named one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 Most Influential People in the World, and appeared on &quot;Forbes&quot;″ Celebrity 100 list. She made a cameo as Janine, forensic scientist and ex-girlfriend of Simon Pegg&#x27;s character, in Edgar Wright&#x27;s action comedy film &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot; (2007). The cameo was uncredited and she gave her fee to charity. She reprised her role as Queen Elizabeth I in the 2007 sequel &quot;&quot; directed by Shekhar Kapur, and portrayed Jude Quinn, one of six incarnations of Bob Dylan in Todd Haynes&#x27; experimental film &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot;. She won the Volpi Cup Best Actress Award at the Venice Film Festival, the Independent Spirit Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Jude Quinn. At the 80th Academy Awards, Blanchett received two nominations – Best Actress for &quot;Elizabeth: the Golden Age&quot; and Best Supporting Actress for &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot; – becoming the first actress to receive a second nomination with the reprisal of a role. Of her achievement that year, Roger Ebert said, &quot;That Blanchett could appear in the same Toronto International Film Festival playing Elizabeth and Bob Dylan, both splendidly, is a wonder of acting.&quot;

===2008–2011: Directing the Sydney Theatre Company===
Blanchett next appeared in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; (2008), as the villainous KGB agent Col. Dr. Irina Spalko. The film received mixed reviews from critics and audiences but was a major box office success, grossing over $790 million worldwide. In David Fincher&#x27;s Oscar-nominated &quot;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&quot;, she co-starred with Brad Pitt for a second time, playing the title character&#x27;s love interest, Daisy Fuller. In the same year, Blanchett voiced the character of Granmamare for the English language version of Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;Ponyo&quot;, released in July 2008.

Also in 2008, Blanchett and her husband Andrew Upton became co-CEOs and artistic directors of the Sydney Theatre Company. Blanchett returned to acting in the theatre in 2009 with the Sydney Theatre Company production of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, directed by Liv Ullmann. She starred as Blanche DuBois alongside Joel Edgerton as Stanley Kowalski. Ullmann and Blanchett had been meaning to collaborate on a project since Ullman&#x27;s intended film adaption of &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; fell by the wayside. Blanchett proposed embarking on &quot;Streetcar&quot; to Ullmann, who jumped at the opportunity after initial discussion.

&quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; production travelled from Sydney to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York, and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. It was a critical and commercial success and Blanchett received acclaim for her performance as Blanche DuBois. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Ben Brantley said, &quot;Ms. Ullmann and Ms. Blanchett have performed the play as if it had never been staged before, with the result that, as a friend of mine put it, &#x27;you feel like you&#x27;re hearing words you thought you knew pronounced correctly for the first time. John Lahr of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote of her portrayal, &quot;with her alert mind, her informed heart, and her lithe, patrician silhouette, [Blanchett] gets it right from the first beat ... I don&#x27;t expect to see a better performance of this role in my lifetime.&quot; Jane Fonda, who attended a New York show, deemed it &quot;perhaps the greatest stage performance I have ever seen&quot;, and Meryl Streep declared, &quot;That performance was as naked, as raw and extraordinary and astonishing and surprising and scary as anything I&#x27;ve ever seen ... I thought I&#x27;d seen that play, I thought I knew all the lines by heart, because I&#x27;ve seen it so many times, but I&#x27;d never seen the play until I saw that performance.&quot; Blanchett won the Sydney Theatre Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. The production and Blanchett received Helen Hayes Awards, for Outstanding Non-Resident Production and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Non-Resident Production award, respectively.

In 2010, Blanchett starred as Lady Marion opposite Russell Crowe&#x27;s titular hero in Ridley Scott&#x27;s epic &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. The film received mixed reviews from critics but was a financial success, earning $321 million at the worldwide box office. In 2011, she played the antagonist CIA agent Marissa Wiegler in Joe Wright&#x27;s action thriller film &quot;Hanna&quot;, co-starring with Saoirse Ronan and Eric Bana.

In 2011, Blanchett took part in two Sydney Theatre Company productions. She played Lotte Kotte in a new translation of Botho Strauß&#x27;s 1978 play &quot;Groß und klein&quot; (&quot;Big and Small&quot;) from Martin Crimp, directed by Benedict Andrews. After its Sydney run, the production travelled to London, Paris, the Vienna Festival and Ruhrfestspiele. Blanchett and the production received wide acclaim. Blanchett was nominated for the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Theatre Awards for Best Actress, and won the Sydney Theatre Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role and the Helpmann Award for Best Actress. She then played Yelena, opposite Hugo Weaving and Richard Roxburgh, in Andrew Upton&#x27;s adaptation of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, which travelled to the Kennedy Center and the New York City Center as part of the Lincoln Center Festival. The production and Blanchett received critical acclaim, with &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Ben Brantley declaring, &quot;I consider the three hours I spent on Saturday night watching [the characters] complain about how bored they are among the happiest of my theatregoing life ... This Uncle Vanya gets under your skin like no other I have seen ... [Blanchett] confirms her status as one of the best and bravest actresses on the planet.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Peter Marks dubbed the production Washington, D.C.&#x27;s top theatrical event of 2011. Blanchett received the Helen Hayes Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Non-Resident Production, and the Helpmann Award for Best Actress.

===2012–2016: &quot;Blue Jasmine&quot; and resurgence in Hollywood===
Blanchett reprised her role as Galadriel in Peter Jackson&#x27;s adaptations of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (2012–2014), prequel to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; series, filmed in New Zealand. While less critically acclaimed than &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; trilogy was nonetheless a major box office success, earning nearly $3 billion worldwide. The character of Galadriel does not appear in J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s original novel, but the story was amended by co-writer Guillermo del Toro and director Peter Jackson so that Blanchett could appear in the film trilogy. She voiced the role of &quot;Penelope&quot; in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Stewie&quot;, which aired on 29 April 2012, and Queen Elizabeth II in the episode &quot;Family Guy Viewer Mail 2&quot;. Blanchett returned to Australian film with her appearance in &quot;The Turning&quot; (2013), an anthology film based on a collection of short stories by Tim Winton. She was head of jury of the 2012 and 2013 Dubai International Film Festival. The Sydney Theatre Company&#x27;s 2013 season was Blanchett&#x27;s final one as co-CEO and artistic director.

In 2013, Blanchett played Jasmine Francis, the lead role in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Blue Jasmine&quot;, co-starring Alec Baldwin and Sally Hawkins. Her performance garnered widespread acclaim, with some critics considering it to be the finest of her career to that point (surpassing her performance in &quot;Elizabeth&quot;). In his review for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Mark Kermode proclaimed, &quot;Blanchett takes on the challenge like a peak-fitness runner facing a marathon, ploughing her way through 26 miles of emotional road pounding, with all the ups and downs, strains and tears, stomach turns and heartburns that that entails, a feat that occasionally leaves her (and us) gasping for breath.&quot; Peter Travers, reviewing the film for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, called Blanchett&#x27;s performance, &quot;miraculous&quot;, and went on to write, &quot;The sight of Jasmine – lost, alone and unable to conjure magic out of unyielding reality – is devastating. This is Blanchett triumphant, and not to be missed.&quot; The performance won her more than 40 industry and critics&#x27; awards, including the LAFCA Award, NYFCC Award, NSFC Award, Critics&#x27; Choice Award, Santa Barbara International Film Festival Outstanding Performance of the Year Award, SAG Award, Golden Globe Award, BAFTA Award, Independent Film Spirit Award and the Academy Award for Best Actress. Blanchett&#x27;s win made her just the sixth actress to win an Oscar in both of the acting categories, the third to win Best Actress after Best Supporting Actress, and the first Australian to win more than one acting Oscar.

Allen&#x27;s adopted daughter Dylan Farrow has since criticised Blanchett and other actresses for working with Allen. Blanchett responded, &quot;It&#x27;s obviously been a long and painful situation for the family and I hope they find some resolution and peace.&quot; On the subject of the Me Too movement, Blanchett said she thinks that &quot;social media is fantastic about raising awareness about issues, but it&#x27;s not the judge and jury&quot; and the cases &quot;need to go into court, so if these abuses have happened, the person is prosecuted, so someone, who is not in the shiny industry that I am, can use that legal precedent to protect themselves. Always, in my industry or any other industry, they&#x27;re preyed upon because they&#x27;re vulnerable.&quot;

In 2014, Blanchett co-starred with Matt Damon and George Clooney in the latter&#x27;s ensemble film, &quot;The Monuments Men&quot;, based on the true story of a crew of art historians and museum curators who recover renowned works of art stolen by Nazis. The French heroine Rose Valland was an inspiration for Blanchett&#x27;s character of Claire Simone. &quot;The Monuments Men&quot; received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $155 million at the worldwide box office. That year, Blanchett also voiced the part of Valka in the DreamWorks Animation film &quot;How to Train Your Dragon 2&quot;. The film received critical acclaim and was a box office success. It went on to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film and receive a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Blanchett guest starred on the Australian show &quot;Rake&quot;, as the onscreen female version of Richard Roxburgh&#x27;s rogue protagonist, Cleaver. On 29 January 2015, she co-hosted the 4th AACTA Awards with Deborah Mailman.

In 2015, Blanchett starred in five films. She portrayed Nancy in Terrence Malick&#x27;s &quot;Knight Of Cups&quot;, which premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival. &quot;IndieWire&quot; named Blanchett&#x27;s performance in &quot;Knight of Cups&quot; one of the 15 best performances in Terrence Malick films. She starred as the villainous Lady Tremaine in Disney&#x27;s Kenneth Branagh-directed live-action adaptation of &quot;Cinderella&quot;, to critical acclaim. Writing for &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Richard Corliss declared that &quot;Blanchett [earns top billing], radiating a hauteur that chills as it amuses; the performance is grand without skirting parody.&quot; She then starred opposite Rooney Mara in &quot;Carol&quot;, the film adaptation of Patricia Highsmith&#x27;s &quot;The Price of Salt&quot;, reuniting her with director Todd Haynes. Blanchett, who also served as an executive producer of the film, drew rave reviews for her performance as the titular character, which was widely cited as one of the best of her career, alongside &quot;Elizabeth&quot; and &quot;Blue Jasmine&quot;. Justin Chang of &quot;Variety&quot; proclaimed, &quot;As a study in the way beautiful surfaces can simultaneously conceal and expose deeper meanings, [Blanchett&#x27;s] performance represents an all-too-fitting centerpiece for this magnificently realized movie.&quot; For &quot;Carol&quot;, Blanchett received again Oscar, Golden Globe, and BAFTA Award nominations.

Blanchett portrayed Mary Mapes opposite Robert Redford&#x27;s Dan Rather in &quot;Truth&quot; (2015), a film about the Killian documents controversy. Blanchett&#x27;s production company was a producing partner for the film. She then starred in &quot;Manifesto&quot;, Julian Rosefeldt&#x27;s multi-screen video installation, in which 12 artist manifestos are depicted by 13 different characters all played by Blanchett. The project, and Blanchett, received critical acclaim, with Roberta Smith of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stating: &quot;If the art world gave out Oscars, Cate Blanchett should win for her tour de force of starring roles in &#x27;Manifesto&#x27;&quot;. In 2016, Blanchett narrated one of two versions of Terence Malick&#x27;s documentary on Earth and the universe, &quot;Voyage of Time&quot;, which had its world premiere at the 73rd Venice Film Festival.

===2017–2020: Broadway debut and television success===
Blanchett starred in the Sydney Theatre Company play &quot;The Present&quot;, Andrew Upton&#x27;s adaption of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s play &quot;Platonov&quot;, directed by John Crowley. The production debuted in Sydney in 2015, to critical acclaim, and transferred to Broadway in 2017, marking Blanchett&#x27;s Broadway debut. Blanchett&#x27;s performance during the play&#x27;s Broadway run received acclaim. Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked that &quot;Blanchett knows how to hold a stage and, if necessary, hijack it ... Such commanding, try-anything charisma is useful if you&#x27;re attempting to hold together a badly assembled party or, for that matter, play.&quot; For her work, Blanchett received a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Play, a Drama Desk Award nomination, and a Drama League Award nomination for the Distinguished Performance Award. In 2017, Blanchett also appeared in Terrence Malick&#x27;s &quot;Song to Song&quot;, shot back-to-back with &quot;Knight of Cups&quot; in 2012, and portrayed the goddess of death Hela in the Marvel Studios film &quot;&quot;, directed by Taika Waititi. &quot;Thor: Ragnarok&quot; was both a critical and financial success, earning $854 million at the worldwide box office.

In 2018, Blanchett starred in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 8&quot;, the all-female spin-off of the &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; franchise, directed by Gary Ross, opposite Sandra Bullock, Anne Hathaway, Sarah Paulson, Mindy Kaling, Helena Bonham Carter, Rihanna and Awkwafina. The film garnered mainly mixed reviews but was a box office success, earning over $297 million worldwide. She also portrayed Florence Zimmerman in the film adaptation of &quot;The House with a Clock in Its Walls&quot; directed by Eli Roth and narrated Shannon Ashlyn&#x27;s award-winning Australian historical fantasy film . Blanchett was appointed the president of the jury of the 71st Cannes Film Festival, which took place in May 2018. That year, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed her as one of world&#x27;s highest-paid actresses with annual earnings of $12.5 million.
Blanchett portrayed a female version of the python Kaa in Andy Serkis&#x27; adaptation of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; titled &quot;&quot; (2018). Serkis utilised a mixture of motion capture, CG animation and live-action in the film, and the role of Kaa was written to be much closer to the original character in the short stories by the author Rudyard Kipling, which is as a mentor-like figure for Mowgli. The film was released on Netflix in 2019. In the same year, Blanchett starred in &quot;Where&#x27;d You Go, Bernadette&quot;, an adaptation of the best-selling book of the same name, which was directed by Richard Linklater. The film received mostly mixed reviews and made $10.4 million at the box office against a budget of $18 million, but Blanchett&#x27;s performance as the titular character received praise, with Pete Hammond writing in his review for &quot;Deadline&quot;, &quot;[The film] doesn&#x27;t quite measure up to expectations, despite a game performance from the incandescent Cate Blanchett, who clearly is the best reason to see this movie.&quot; She received her tenth Golden Globe nomination for her performance in the film. Also that year, she reprised her role as Valka in &quot;How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World&quot;, which was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 92nd Academy Awards.

In 2020, Blanchett&#x27;s Dirty Films production company was signed with New Republic Pictures for feature films and FX Networks for television. Blanchett returned to television by starring in two miniseries. She played a supporting role in the Australian drama series &quot;Stateless&quot;, inspired by the controversial mandatory detention case of Cornelia Rau. &quot;Stateless&quot; was funded by Screen Australia and Blanchett also served as co-creator and executive producer for the series. It aired on the Australian public broadcaster ABC, and premiered internationally on Netflix. Blanchett won two awards at the 10th AACTA Awards for &quot;Stateless&quot;: Best Guest or Supporting Actress for her performance, and Best Mini-Series for her role as executive producer.

Blanchett also headlined and produced the FX/Hulu historical drama miniseries &quot;Mrs. America&quot; (2020), starring as conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly. The nine-part series aired to widespread critical acclaim, with James Poniewozik writing in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Her final scene, wordless and devastating, might as well end with Blanchett being handed an Emmy onscreen&quot;; and Michael Idato for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; proclaiming, &quot;Blanchett&#x27;s track record speaks for itself, but here something else is happening. Every time Blanchett&#x27;s Schlafly glides perfectly into the frame, there is simply nowhere else to look.&quot; At the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards, she received nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie and Outstanding Limited Series, as well as nominations for the Golden Globe Award, the Screen Actors Guild Award (both for her performance), and the Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Drama. Blanchett also served as an executive producer on the Greek film &quot;Apples&quot; (2020), directed by Christos Nikou. The film premiered at the Venice International Film Festival to critical praise, and was selected to be the country&#x27;s submission to the Academy Awards as their Best Foreign Language Film.

=== 2021–present: &quot;Tár&quot; and further acclaim ===
In 2021, Blanchett starred alongside Bradley Cooper in Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot;, which was released to positive reviews. David Ehrlich of &quot;IndieWire&quot; praised the chemistry between the two leads writing, &quot;It’s such a thrill to watch Blanchett spar with Cooper&quot;. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards including Best Picture. She also acted alongside Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio in Adam McKay&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Up&quot;, an apocalyptic political satire black comedy film for Netflix. Pete Hammond of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote, &quot;Blanchett is having a ball as your typical entertainment-oriented blonde anchorwoman&quot;. The film also received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. With &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Up&quot;″s Best Picture Oscar nominations, Blanchett broke the record held by actress Olivia de Havilland of being the female actor with the most credited roles in Best Picture nominees.

Blanchett then starred in the 2022 film &quot;Tár&quot;, directed by Todd Field. Her performance as Lydia Tár, a fictional renowned conductor, received widespread critical acclaim. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s David Rooney wrote that Blanchett gives an &quot;astonishing performance — flinty, commandingly self-possessed and ever so slowly splintering under pressure&quot;, adding that it &quot;marks yet another career peak for Blanchett – many are likely to argue her greatest&quot;. For her performance, she won her second Volpi Cup for Best Actress, fourth Golden Globe Award, and fourth BAFTA Award. She also swept the major critics awards trifecta (NYFCC, LAFCA, NSFC) for the second time and went on to receive her eighth Oscar nomination, tying for the fourth most Oscar-nominated actress. That year, Blanchett also voiced Spazzatura in the Netflix film adaptation &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, reuniting her with del Toro.

In 2023, Blanchett co-starred in the Australian drama film &quot;The New Boy&quot;, and reprised the role of Hela in the season two episode &quot;What If... Hela Found the Ten Rings?&quot; of the Marvel series &quot;What If...?&quot;. She also co-produced the Apple TV+ science fiction romantic drama film &quot;Fingernails&quot;. The following year, Blanchett reunited with Eli Roth to portray Lilith in the &quot;Borderlands&quot;, a live action film adaptation of the video games of the same name. The film premiered to negative reviews from critics and became a box-office bomb. She then headlined the Apple TV+ psychological thriller miniseries &quot;Disclaimer&quot;, written and directed by Alfonso Cuarón, and co-starring Kevin Kline, Sacha Baron Cohen and Louis Partridge. It premiered in October to a mostly positive critical reception. Blanchett will next produce and star in &quot;A Manual for Cleaning Women&quot;, based on Lucia Berlin&#x27;s 43-part collection of short stories. 

In July 2024, she joined the short film &quot;Marion&quot; as an executive producer. Starting in March 2025, Blanchett will star opposite Tom Burke, Emma Corrin, and Kodi Smit-McPhee in a reimagining of the Anton Chekov play &quot;The Seagull&quot; at the Barbican Theater in London.

==Style and reception==
Blanchett is regarded as one of the finest and most versatile actors of her generation. She is noted for her ability to play characters from many different walks of life, and for headlining and being an ensemble player in a wide range of film genres and production scales, from low-budget independent films to high-profile blockbusters. She has also been praised for her mastery over a wide array of diverse accents, including English, Irish, French, and various regional American accents. In a 2022 readers&#x27; poll by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, Blanchett was voted one of the 50 greatest actors of all time.

Commenting on her appeal as a screen actor in &quot;Vulture&quot;, Will Leitch and Tim Grierson stated that her greatest skill was &quot;her ability to combine relatability and elusiveness: She is always completely present and yet just out of grasp. She has been forever daring, uncompromising and perpetually, resolutely, herself.&quot; Blanchett&#x27;s performance in the film &quot;Carol&quot; was ranked as the 2nd best movie performance of the decade by IndieWire in 2019. Writing of her performance in the film, Christian Zilko states, &quot;The greatest performance in a career where almost every role feels like a legitimate contender, Cate Blanchett&#x27;s take on Carol Aird is a veritable symphony of repressive silence.&quot;

Blanchett has been cited in the press as being a style icon and has frequently topped lists of the best dressed women in the world. In 2004, Blanchett was named the third most naturally beautiful woman of all time by a panel of beauty and fashion editors, make-up artists, model agencies and photographers, behind Audrey Hepburn and Liv Tyler. She was in &quot;Empire&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Sexiest Movie Stars of All-Time&quot; in 2007 and 2013. In 2022, she was named in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s listing of &quot;Women in Entertainment Power 100&quot;.

In 2006, a portrait of Blanchett and her family painted by McLean Edwards was a finalist for the Art Gallery of New South Wales&#x27; Archibald Prize. Another portrait of Blanchett was a finalist for the Archibald Prize in 2014. Blanchett appeared in a series of commemorative postage stamps called Australian Legends in 2009, in recognition of the outstanding contribution made to Australian entertainment and culture. In 2015, Madame Tussauds Hollywood unveiled a wax statue of Blanchett draped in a recreation of the yellow Valentino dress she wore to the 77th Academy Awards in 2005. In 2019, Blanchett was among the &quot;10 inspirational women honored with a larger-than-life bronze sculpture&quot; as part of the Statues for Equality project, which &quot;aims to balance gender representation in public art and honor women&#x27;s contributions to society&quot;. The bronze statues were unveiled on Women&#x27;s Equality Day: 26 August 2019 on Avenue of the Americas in New York City. Blanchett&#x27;s statue is &quot;a creation based on a single image from the 2003 photoshoot by Matt Jones for &quot;Movieline&#x27;s Hollywood Life&quot; magazine.&quot;

== Activism ==
=== Environmental ===
Blanchett has been a long term proponent of individual and collective action on climate change and other environmental issues. In 2006, she joined former US Vice-president Al Gore&#x27;s Climate Project. In 2007, Blanchett became the ambassador for the Australian Conservation Foundation. She was made an honorary life member of the Australian Conservation Foundation in 2012, in recognition of her support for environmental issues. At the beginning of 2011, Blanchett lent her support for a carbon tax. She received some criticism for this, particularly from conservatives. Blanchett is a patron of the international development charity SolarAid, which works to create a sustainable market for solar lights in Africa.

From 2008 to 2011, the Sydney Theatre Company under the leadership of Blanchett and her husband Andrew Upton, initiated a comprehensive large scale environmental program called &quot;Greening the Wharf&quot;, which invested in solar energy, rainwater harvesting, energy efficiency measures and best practice waste management. The program won a Green Globe Award which was accepted by Blanchett and Upton.

In January 2014, Blanchett took part in the Green Carpet Challenge, an initiative to raise the public profile of sustainable fashion, founded by Livia Firth of Eco-Age. In September 2020, as part of her role as Jury President of the 77th Venice International Film Festival, Blanchett vowed that during the festival she would only wear outfits that she had previously worn at public events in an effort to highlight the issue of sustainability in the fashion industry. In October of the same year, Blanchett was appointed by Prince William as a council member for the Earthshot Prize, which provides 50 environmental pioneers with the funds needed to further their work in tackling major problems impacting the environment. In 2022, Blanchett launched the &quot;Climate of Change&quot; podcast on Audible together with Danny Kennedy to discuss climate change and the importance of preserving the environment. In 2024, Blanchett was announced as the new ambassador of Wakehurst.
The ecohouse that Blanchett and Upton are having built in Mawgan Porth, Cornwall, on the site of a stone cottage they bought for £1.6 million and then demolished, has been the subject of controversy, as the noise from its construction is alleged to have &quot;destroyed the family holidays&quot; of a number of people in 2023. The couple&#x27;s application to build an extension and space for parking had been described by a local resident as a &quot;blatant attempt to erode an environmentally important piece of land by stealth and incorporate it&quot;. The architects developing the site denied that anyone has been inconvenienced by the noise.

===Humanitarian===
Blanchett has been working with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) since 2015. In May 2016, the UNHCR announced her appointment as a global Goodwill Ambassador. Blanchett, along with other celebrities, featured in a video from the UNHCR to help raise awareness to the global refugee crisis. The video, titled &quot;What They Took With Them&quot;, has the actors reading a poem written by Jenifer Toksvig and inspired by primary accounts of refugees, and is part of UNHCR&#x27;s &quot;WithRefugees&quot; campaign, which also includes a petition to governments to expand asylum to provide further shelter, integrating job opportunities, and education.

Blanchett has undertaken missions with the UNHCR to Jordan in 2015, Lebanon in 2016 and Bangladesh in 2018 to meet with and highlight the issues faced by both Syrian and Rohingya refugees in those areas. In January 2018, she was awarded the Crystal Award at the World Economic Forum to honour her advocacy for refugees and displaced people around the world, and in August 2018, she addressed the United Nations Security Council about the atrocities committed against the Rohingya people in Myanmar.

In July 2020, the Australian miniseries &quot;Stateless&quot;, which was co-created and produced by Blanchett (and originally aired on the ABC network in Australia), premiered on Netflix. The series was inspired by Blanchett&#x27;s work with the UNHCR and focuses on four strangers whose lives collide at an immigration detention centre in Australia. In Blanchett&#x27;s words, the show&#x27;s aim is to &quot;build empathy and understanding for refugees, particularly those who have been and still are in detention.&quot;

As an esteemed member of the performing arts community that was seriously impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and a person concerned about environmental and humanitarian issues, Blanchett contributed an essay to &quot;Upturn: A Better Normal After COVID-19&quot;, a book published in 2020 about what could be done to improve society after the pandemic in her native Australia. Blanchett said:

In May 2020, Blanchett was among the celebrities who read an installment of Roald Dahl&#x27;s children&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; in aid of the global-non profit charity Partners In Health, co-founded by Dahl&#x27;s daughter Ophelia, which had been fighting COVID-19 in vulnerable areas.

In September 2020, Blanchett, Helen Mirren, Eddie Redmayne, Salman Rushdie and other figures of British cultural life support the protests of University for Theater and Film Arts (SZFE) students in Budapest against changes ushered Prime Minister Viktor Orban&#x27;s government that forced a transfer of control of the public institution to a private foundation and a new structure to guide key decisions at the storied SZFE.

In October 2023, Blanchett signed the Artists4Ceasefire open letter calling for a ceasefire during the Israel-Hamas war.

== Personal life ==


Blanchett is married to playwright and screenwriter Andrew Upton. They met in Australia in the mid-1990s and married on 29 December 1997. They have three sons, and a daughter, who was adopted in 2015. Blanchett said that she and her husband had wanted to adopt since the birth of their first son.

After making Brighton, England, their main family home for nearly 10 years, she and her husband returned to their native Australia in 2006. In November 2006, Blanchett attributed the move to their desire to select a permanent home for her children, to be closer to her family, and to have a sense of belonging to the Australian theatrical community. She and her family lived in the Sydney suburb of Hunters Hill, extensively renovating their home in 2007 to be more eco-friendly. Following its sale in 2015, she and Upton relocated back to England and purchased a house in Crowborough, East Sussex, in early 2016.

Blanchett has spoken about feminism and politics, telling Sky News in 2013 that she was concerned that &quot;a wave of conservatism sweeping the globe&quot; was threatening women&#x27;s role in society. She has also commented on the pressures women in Hollywood face now: &quot;Honestly, I think about my appearance less than I did ten years ago. People talk about the golden age of Hollywood because of how women were lit then. You could be Joan Crawford and Bette Davis and work well into your 50s, because you were lit and made into a goddess. Now, with everything being sort of gritty, women have this sense of their use-by date.&quot;

Blanchett was the first ambassador and has been a patron of the Australian Film Institute and its academy, the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts, since 2001. She is also a patron of the Sydney Film Festival. Blanchett is a patron of the new Australian Pavilion in the Venice Biennale, and spoke at its opening at the Venice Giardini in May 2015. Blanchett spoke at former Prime Minister of Australia Gough Whitlam&#x27;s state funeral in 2014, and at the Margaret Whitlam dinner and fundraiser event hosted by politician Tanya Plibersek in June 2015.

Blanchett became a spokeswoman for and the face of SK-II, the luxury skin care brand owned by Procter &amp; Gamble, in 2005, and brand ambassador for Giorgio Armani fragrances for women in 2013, being paid $10 million for the latter. In 2018 Armani announced Blanchett would become the first beauty ambassador for the company, representing the company globally by absorbing responsibilities for skincare and make-up, in addition to her previous 2013 commitments to fragrances. In 2022, Louis Vuitton announced Blanchett as its new house ambassador.

<doc id="160128" wikidata="Q31112" url="?curid=160128" title="Bill Frist">
<text>William Harrison Frist (born February 22, 1952) is an American physician, businessman, conservationist and policymaker who served as a United States Senator from Tennessee from 1995 to 2007. A member of the Republican Party, he also served as Senate Majority Leader from 2003 to 2007. Born in Nashville, Tennessee, Frist studied government and health care policy at Princeton University and earned a Doctor of Medicine degree from Harvard Medical School. He trained as a cardiothoracic transplant surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital and Stanford University School of Medicine, and later founded the Vanderbilt Transplant Center. In the 1994 United States Senate election in Tennessee, he defeated incumbent Democratic Senator Jim Sasser.

After serving as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Frist succeeded Tom Daschle as the Senate Majority Leader. Frist helped pass several parts of President George W. Bush&#x27;s domestic agenda, including the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 and the Medicare Modernization Act. Frist left the Senate in 2007, honoring his pledge to serve no more than two terms.

In his post-Senate career, he serves as chair of the global board of The Nature Conservancy. He is also a founding partner of Frist Cressey Ventures, a special partner and chairman of the Executives Council of the health service investment firm Cressey &amp; Company, and co-chair of the Health Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center. He currently hosts the &quot;A Second Opinion Podcast&quot; on the intersection of policy, medicine, and innovation.

==Early life and education==
Frist was born in Nashville, Tennessee, the son of Dorothy (née Cate) Frist and Thomas Fearn Frist Sr. He is a fourth-generation Tennessean. His father was a doctor and co-founded the health care business organization which became Hospital Corporation of America (HCA). Frist&#x27;s brother, HCA co-founder Thomas F. Frist, Jr., became chairman and chief executive of HCA in 1997. His other siblings include Robert A. Frist; Dorothy F. Boensch; and Mary F. Barfield.

Frist graduated in 1970 from Montgomery Bell Academy in Nashville, and then from Princeton University&#x27;s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs in 1974. Frist was a member of University Cottage Club while he was a student at Princeton. In 1972, he held a summer internship with Tennessee Congressman Joe L. Evins, who advised Frist that if he wanted to pursue a political career, he should first have a career outside politics. Frist proceeded to Harvard Medical School, where he received the degree of Doctor of Medicine with honors in 1978.

While he was a medical school student in the 1970s, Frist acknowledged in his book &quot;Transplant&quot; that he performed medical experiments and vivisection on shelter cats while conducting research at Harvard Medical School. He writes about having succumbed to the pressure to succeed in a highly competitive medical school, acknowledging it was &quot;a heinous and dishonest thing to do.&quot; This issue became controversial in his first Senate campaign in 1994, and gained national attention after his election to Senate Majority Leader.

==Medical career==
While in medical school, Frist joined the laboratory of W. John Powell Jr. at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1977, where he continued his training in cardiovascular physiology. In 1978, he became a resident in surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital. In 1983, he spent time at Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, England as a senior registrar in cardiothoracic surgery. He returned to Massachusetts General in 1984 as chief resident and fellow in cardiothoracic surgery. From 1985 until 1986, Frist was a senior fellow and chief resident in cardiac transplant service and cardiothoracic surgery at the Stanford University School of Medicine. There, he trained under Dr. Norman Shumway, a pioneering surgeon known as the father of heart transplantation.

After completing his fellowship, Frist became a faculty member at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where he began a heart and lung transplantation program. There, he performed the first heart-lung transplant in the Southeast. And in 1990, he performed Tennessee&#x27;s first single-lung transplant, a notoriously difficult procedure. He also served as a staff surgeon at the Nashville Veterans Administration Hospital. In 1989, he founded the Vanderbilt Transplant Center, which today performs more heart transplants than any other center in the world.

In 1991 Frist operated on then–Lieutenant Colonel David Petraeus after he had been shot in a training accident at Fort Campbell. Their paths crossed again when Frist was elected to the Senate and Petraeus rose through the military ranks to General. They later ran the Army 10-miler together in 2002 in Washington, DC.

In 1992, Frist organized a statewide grassroots campaign to return the organ donation card to the Tennessee driver&#x27;s license and received the Distinguished Service Award from the Tennessee Medical Association for his efforts.

In 1995 Frist, then a sitting senator, successfully resuscitated a constituent suffering a heart attack in the Dirksen Senate Office building.

In 1998, Frist administered emergency aid to victims and the shooter in the 1998 Capitol Shooting.

Frist regularly participated in global medical mission and international relief trips, often with non-profit Samaritan&#x27;s Purse, providing medical aid in sub-Saharan Africa and taking part in emergency response to hurricanes (Katrina), earthquakes (Haiti), tsunami (Sri Lanka) and famine (Sudan and Ethiopia).

During his 20 years in medicine, Frist performed over 150 heart and lung transplants and authored over 100 peer-reviewed medical articles.  He is board certified in both general and heart surgery.

==United States senator (1995–2007)==
In 1990, Frist met with former Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker about the possibilities of public office. Baker advised him to pursue the Senate and suggested in 1992 that Frist begin preparations to run in 1994. Frist began to build support. He served on the Tennessee Governor&#x27;s Medicaid Task Force from 1992 to 1993, joined the National Steering Committee of the Republican National Committee&#x27;s Health Care Coalition and was deputy director of the Tennessee Bush-Quayle 1992 campaign.

During the 1994 election, Frist promised not to serve for more than two terms, a promise he honored.

Frist accused his 1994 opponent, incumbent senator Jim Sasser, of &quot;sending Tennessee money to Washington, DC&quot;, and said, &quot;While I&#x27;ve been transplanting lungs and hearts to heal Tennesseans, Jim Sasser has been transplanting Tennesseans&#x27; wallets to Washington, home of Marion Barry.&quot; During the campaign he also criticized Sasser for trying to become Senate Majority Leader, claiming that his opponent would be spending more time taking care of Senate business than Tennessee business. Frist won the election, defeating Sasser by 13 points in the 1994 Republican sweep of both houses of Congress, thus becoming the first doctor in the Senate since June 17, 1938, when Royal S. Copeland died.

In his 2000 reelection campaign, Frist easily won with 66 percent of the vote. He received the largest vote total ever by a statewide candidate. Frist&#x27;s 2000 campaign organization was later fined by the Federal Election Commission for failing to disclose a $1.44 million loan taken out jointly with the 1994 campaign organization. Frist paid a civil fine of $11,000 in a settlement with the FEC.

Frist supported the Iraq war while in the Senate; he supported the initial invasion as well as the war during the Iraqi Insurgency.

Frist first entered the national spotlight when two Capitol police officers were shot inside the United States Capitol by Russell Eugene Weston Jr. in 1998. Frist, the closest doctor, provided immediate medical attention (he was unable to save the two officers, but was able to save Weston). Frist said of that experience, &quot;You’re trained to respond. … In moments like that, you are not a judge, not a jury, you are a physician. It was a tragic incident. I know almost all of the Capitol guards.&quot;

As the only physician in the Senate, Frist served as the Congressional spokesman during the 2001 anthrax attacks. His book, &quot;When Every Moment Counts: What You Need to Know About Bioterrorism from the Senate&#x27;s Only Doctor&quot;, was published following the attacks and provides a question-and-answer format with timely information on responding to biological agents like anthrax.

Over the course of his 12 years in the Senate, his committee assignments included: Committee on Finance, Committee on Health, Education, and Pensions, Committee on Rules and Administration, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Committee on Labor and Human Resources, Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, Committee on Foreign Relations, Committee on Small Business, and Committee on the Budget.

He served as chairman of the Subcommittee on Disability Policy, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, chairman of the Subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space, and chairman of the Budget Committee Task Force on Education.

As the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, he helped Republicans win back the Senate in the 2002 midterm election. His committee collected $66.4 million for 2001–2002, 50% more than the previous year.

===Senate majority leader (2003–2007)===
On December 23, 2002, Frist was elected Senate majority leader. He became the third-youngest Senate Majority Leader in U.S. history, and had served fewer total years in Congress than any person previously chosen to lead that body. In his 2005 book, &quot;Herding Cats, A Lifetime in Politics&quot;, Frist&#x27;s predecessor, Trent Lott, accused Frist of conspiring to push Lott out of the Senate Majority Leader post, a charge Frist denied.

Legislative success

In the 2003 legislative session, Frist enjoyed many successes. He was able to push many initiatives through to fruition, including the Bush administration&#x27;s third major tax cut and the Medicare Modernization Act that established Medicare Part D (the prescription drug benefit for seniors) and the modern-day Medicare Advantage program. He also was instrumental in developing and then passing the President&#x27;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the historic and unprecedented funding commitment to fight AIDS that has saved the lives of 25 million people globally. Motivated to address the AIDS epidemic following his medical mission trips to sub-Saharan Africa, Frist laid the initial groundwork for PEPFAR with legislation he drafted with then-Senator John Kerry (D-MA). When President Bush made the PEPFAR program a priority of his 2003 agenda, Frist built a bipartisan coalition to secure the legislation&#x27;s rapid passage.

Frist continued to support global health investments during his time as majority leader, and helped shepherd the enactment of the senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005, which made the provision of safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) an objective of U.S. foreign assistance, recognizing a lack of clean water and sanitation as the leading cause of preventable death in the developing world.

Following the 2001 anthrax attacks and 2004 ricin attacks, Frist led the Senate to pass the Project BioShield Act, a $5.6 billion research effort to develop and acquire medical vaccines and treatments to protect against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) attacks. In December 2006, during Frist&#x27;s final month as Senate Majority Leader, Congress passed the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), as a part of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, to strengthen BioShield by creating a dedicated agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services focused on the procurement and development of CBRN medical countermeasures. The mechanisms and agencies established by this legislation became vital 14 years later during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Stem cells

In 2001, President George W. Bush prohibited federal funding of most human embryonic cell research, limiting federal funding only to cell lines from embryos before the date of his announcement. At the time there were believed to be 78 viable lines. Frist supported the President in 2001, but as time progressed, the stem cell lines became less stable and by 2005 only 22 viable lines remained. In 2001, Frist had laid out 10 principles that guided his views on stem cells, which he restated on the Senate floor in 2006. He said, &quot;President Bush and I do not differ about the need for strong guidelines governing stem cell research. His policy was generally consistent with the principles I set forth a month before his announcement back in 2001. However, as science has progressed over the last 5 years, we have learned that fewer than the anticipated number of cell lines have proved suitable for research, and I think the limit on cell lines available for federally funded research is too restrictive.&quot; Frist led the Senate to pass on July 18, 2006 the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act (H.R. 810) which would have expanded federal funding for stem cell research to include stem cells derived from embryos created for but not used in fertilization. The legislation drew criticism from James Dobson and other Christians, but garnered praise from former First Lady Nancy Reagan. H.R. 810 was vetoed by President Bush and Congress failed to override the veto.

====Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA)====
Just before Congress adjourned for the 2006 elections, in what politicos call a &quot;midnight drop&quot;, Frist inserted the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) clauses into the larger, unrelated Security and Accountability for Every Port (SAFE) Act. The SAFE Act itself was a late &quot;must pass&quot; bill designed to safeguard ports from terrorist infiltration. The UIGEA became the basis for the April 15, 2011, US Department of Justice government crackdown and domain name seizure of three of the world&#x27;s top online poker sites, dubbed &quot;black Friday&quot; in the poker community. The DOJ Office of Legal Counsel subsequently issued an opinion in September 2011, stating that the UIGEA applies only to betting on sporting events and contests and not to other types of online gambling.

Schiavo case

In the Terri Schiavo case, a brain-damaged woman whose husband wanted to remove her gastric feeding tube, Frist opposed the removal. In a 2005 speech delivered on the Senate Floor, he questioned the diagnosis of Schiavo&#x27;s doctors of Schiavo being in a persistent vegetative state (PVS): &quot;I question it based on a review of the video footage which I spent an hour or so looking at last night in my office.&quot; After her death, the autopsy showed signs of long-term and irreversible damage to a brain consistent with PVS. Frist defended his actions after the autopsy.

Campaigns and elections

In a prominent and nationally broadcast speech to the Republican National Convention in August 2004, Frist highlighted his background as a doctor and focused on several issues related to health care. He spoke in favor of the recently passed Medicare prescription drug benefit and the passage of legislation providing for health savings accounts.

In an impassioned argument for medical malpractice tort reform, Frist called personal injury trial lawyers &quot;predators&quot;: &quot;We must stop them from twisting American medicine into a litigation lottery where they hit the jackpot and every patient ends up paying.&quot; Frist has been an advocate for imposing caps on the amount of money courts can award plaintiffs for noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases.

During the 2004 election season, Frist employed the unprecedented political tactic of going to the home state of the opposition party&#x27;s minority leader, Democrat Tom Daschle of South Dakota. Daschle&#x27;s Republican opponent, John Thune, defeated Daschle. Later Frist and Daschle work together at the Bipartisan Policy Center and have spoken together frequently at healthcare conventions and events and written numerous joint op-eds on policy issues of bipartisan agreement.
Frist pledged to leave the Senate after two terms in 2006 and did not run for reelection. He campaigned heavily for Republican candidate Bob Corker, who won by a small margin over Congressman Harold Ford Jr. in the general election.

==Post-Senate career==
===Political involvement===
Frist was mentioned as a potential 2008 Republican presidential candidate and as a potential 2010 Republican candidate for Governor of Tennessee. Ultimately, he did not run for either office.

In 2009, Frist stated that he would have broken with his party by voting in favor of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was unanimously opposed by Republicans. In January 2011, after the Republicans regained a majority in the House, Frist called on them not to attempt to repeal the health care law.

===Business career===
In 2008, he became a partner in Chicago-based Cressey &amp; Co., investing in the nation&#x27;s health care market. Today, he serves as special partner and chairman of the Executives Council at Cressey.

In 2013, Frist partnered with Brad Smith to start Aspire Health, which grew to be the largest non-hospice community-based palliative care company in the U.S. before it was acquired by Anthem in 2018. The care model was inspired in part by the team-based approach Frist had used in caring for patients awaiting transplants.

In 2015, Frist co-founded Frist Cressey Ventures, a Nashville-based venture capital firm focused on partnering with early-stage healthcare companies. He is an active partner in the firm today.

Frist also serves as board chair of Monogram Health, a value-based specialty provider of in-home evidence-based care and benefit management services for patients living with polychronic conditions, including chronic kidney and end-stage renal disease. Based in Nashville, Tennessee, and privately held by Frist Cressey Ventures and other leading strategic and financial investors, Monogram Health provides care for patients across 34 states and all insurance products.

===Philanthropy===
In 2009, Frist launched a statewide education reform nonprofit organization targeting K-12 education called SCORE (State Collaborative on Reforming Education). The organization&#x27;s mission is to &quot;collaboratively support Tennessee&#x27;s work to prepare students for college and the workforce.&quot; Frist has served as chairman of SCORE&#x27;s board of directors. As part of SCORE&#x27;s work, Frist annually presents the State of Education in Tennessee report, a comprehensive look at the state&#x27;s efforts to improve public education. In 2013, Frist voiced support for higher academic standards in grades K-12, reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and improving efforts to identify, foster, and reward effective teaching.

In 2010, Frist served on the six-person board of the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund, which had raised $66 million for immediate earthquake relief and long-term recovery efforts in the Caribbean country.

Frist also founded and chairs Hope Through Healing Hands, a global health non-profit, as well as community health collaborative NashvilleHealth. In 2019 NashvilleHealth completed, in partnership with the Nashville Metro Public Health Department, the first community health and well-being survey of Nashville/Davidson County residents in nearly 20 years. The organization also led a review of Nashville&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, detailing recommendations to improve future crisis response in a report, &quot;Strategies for Future Preparedness: Examining the Impact of COVID-19 in Nashville&quot;.

===Board service===

He currently serves as chairman of the lllGlobal lllBoard of The Nature Conservancy, a three-year term that began in October 2022, and has been a member of the board since June 2015, previously as vice-chair. He has also served on the non-profit boards of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (2013–2023), and previously spent 10 years on the board of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Frist has held numerous roles with the Smithsonian Institution, including serving on its board of regents (1997–2007). Congress established the Smithsonian in 1846 as &quot;an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge,&quot; and vested responsibility for the administration of the Smithsonian in a board of regents, consisting of the chief justice of the United States, the vice president of the United States, three members of the United States Senate, three members of the United States House of Representatives, and nine citizens. Frist later served on the advisory board of the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of the American Indian.

===Other endeavors===

After leaving the U.S. Senate, Frist taught at Princeton and Vanderbilt. From 2007- 2008 Frist served as the Frederick H. Schultz Class of 1951 Visiting professor of International Economic Policy at Princeton&#x27;s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, teaching with his longtime mentor, renowned healthcare economist Uwe Reinhardt.  From 2009 – 2010, Frist taught as a Distinguished Professor at Vanderbilt University with Congressman Jim Cooper (D-TN).

Frist also became a co-chair of One Vote &#x27;08, an initiative of the ONE campaign, with former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD). According to OneVote.org, &quot;One Vote &#x27;08 is an unprecedented, non-partisan campaign to make global health and extreme poverty foreign policy priorities in the 2008 presidential election.&quot; Frist traveled to Africa for the ONE campaign in July 2008.

Since 2011, Frist has served as a senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center, and is co-chair of the organization&#x27;s Health Project with former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle.

Frist is a trained pilot, a skill he used to annually travel to all 95 Tennessee counties while campaigning and in office.

An active runner while in the Senate, Frist completed seven marathons from 1998 – 2001.

==Books==
In June 1989, Frist published his first book, &quot;Transplant: A Heart Surgeon&#x27;s Account of the Life-And-Death Dramas of the New Medicine&quot;, in which he wrote, &quot;A doctor is a man whose job justifies everything ... Life [is] a gift, not an inalienable right.&quot;

With J. H. Helderman, he edited &quot;Grand Rounds in Transplantation&quot; in 1995, which described case studies in kidney, heart, lung, liver, and bone marrow transplantation drawn from Vanderbilt&#x27;s case load.

In October 1999, Frist co-authored &quot;Tennessee Senators, 1911–2001: Portraits of Leadership in a Century of Change&quot; with J. Lee Annis Jr.

In March 2002, Frist published, &quot;When Every Moment Counts: What You Need to Know About Bioterrorism from the Senate&#x27;s Only Doctor&quot;, sharing practical guidance following the 2001 anthrax attacks on how to stay safe in the event of a bioterrorism attack.

In 2003, Frist and co-author Shirley Wilson released the book, &quot;Good People Beget Good People: A Genealogy of the Frist Family&quot;.

In October 2009, Frist published &quot;A Heart to Serve: The Passion to Bring Health, Hope, and Healing&quot;. The book details his family legacy, his experiences as a heart and lung transplant surgeon and a U.S. Senator, and covers several of his medical mission trips in Africa, the process to enact PEPFAR, the 2001 anthrax attacks and SARS, the Medicare Modernization Act, and the 1998 Capitol shooting where he administered care.

He coedited with Dr. Manish Sethi &quot;An Introduction to Health Policy&quot; in 2013.

==Personal life==
In 1981, Frist married Karyn McLaughlin. They had three sons: Harrison, Jonathan, and Bryan. The Frist family were members of the National Presbyterian Church in Washington, D.C. The Frists were divorced in December 2012.

On May 29, 2015, Frist married Tracy Lynne Roberts (b. April 14, 1962). The couple resides in Franklin, Tennessee.

===Finances===
As of 2005, Frist had a fortune in the millions of dollars, most of it the result of his ownership of stock in Hospital Corporation of America, the for-profit hospital chain founded by his brother and father. Frist&#x27;s 2005 financial disclosure form listed blind trusts valued between $15 million and $45 million.

Members of the Frist family have been major donors to Princeton University, pledging a reported $25 million in 1997 for the construction of the Frist Campus Center.

Bill and Karyn Frist were the sole trustees in charge of a family foundation bearing the senator&#x27;s name which had more than $2 million in assets in 2004. He and his siblings were vice presidents of another charitable foundation bearing their parents&#x27; names. The status of Frist&#x27;s blind trust, and subsequent statements about it and activities within it, led to an SEC investigation. He was questioned in 2005 by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) about stock sales allegedly based on inside information. The investigation was closed after 18 months with no charges were filed. Frist said in a statement, &quot;I&#x27;ve always conducted myself according to the highest ethical standards in both my personal and public life, and my family and I are pleased that this matter has been resolved.&quot;

==Recognition==

Frist was named one of the 100 Most Powerful People in Healthcare by &quot;Modern Healthcare&quot; in 2002, 2003 and 2004.  He was also named to The Time 100: The 2005 list of the world&#x27;s most influential people by &quot;Time Magazine.&quot;

In 2001, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 2003, Frist received Princeton University&#x27;s Woodrow Wilson Award, which is conferred annually upon an alumnus or alumna of the undergraduate college whose achievements exemplify Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s memorable phrase, &quot;Princeton in the nation’s service.&quot;

In 2011, he received the Al Ueltschi Award for Humanitarian Leadership in recognition of his life-saving efforts worldwide, and the importance of business aviation to those endeavors.

Between 1997 and 2006, Frist received honorary degrees from five historically black colleges and universities, including Fisk University, Howard University, LeMoyne-Owen College, Meharry Medical College, and the Morehouse School of Medicine.

<doc id="160130" wikidata="Q1140668" url="?curid=160130" title="54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment">
<text>The 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment was an infantry regiment that saw extensive service in the Union Army during the American Civil War. The unit was the second African-American regiment, following the 1st Kansas Colored Volunteer Infantry Regiment, organized in the Northern states during the Civil War. Authorized by the Emancipation Proclamation, the regiment consisted of African-American enlisted men commanded by white officers. The 54th Massachusetts was a major force in the pioneering of African American civil war regiments, with 150 all-black regiments being raised after the raising of the 54th Massachusetts.

The unit began recruiting in February 1863 and trained at Camp Meigs on the outskirts of Boston, Massachusetts. Prominent abolitionists were active in recruitment efforts, including Frederick Douglass, whose two sons were among the first to enlist. Massachusetts Governor John Albion Andrew, who had long pressured the U.S. Department of War to begin recruiting African-Americans, placed a high priority on the formation of the 54th Massachusetts. Andrew appointed Robert Gould Shaw, the son of Boston abolitionists, to command the regiment as Colonel. The free black community in Boston was also instrumental in recruiting efforts, utilizing networks reaching beyond Massachusetts and even into the Southern states to attract soldiers and fill out the ranks. After it departed from Massachusetts on May 28, 1863, the 54th Massachusetts was shipped to Beaufort, South Carolina and became part of the X Corps commanded by Major General David Hunter.

During its service with the X Corps, the 54th Massachusetts took part in operations against Charleston, South Carolina, including the Battle of Grimball&#x27;s Landing on July 16, 1863, and the more famous Second Battle of Fort Wagner on July 18, 1863. During the latter engagement, the 54th Massachusetts, with other Union regiments, executed a frontal assault against Fort Wagner and suffered casualties of 20 killed, 125 wounded, and 102 missing (primarily presumed dead)—roughly 40 percent of the unit&#x27;s numbers at that time. Col. Robert G. Shaw was killed on the parapet of Fort Wagner. In 1864, as part of the Union Army&#x27;s Department of Florida, the 54th Massachusetts took part in the Battle of Olustee.

The service of the 54th Massachusetts, particularly their charge at Fort Wagner, soon became one of the most famous episodes of the war, interpreted through artwork, poetry, and song. More recently, the 54th Massachusetts gained prominence in popular culture through the 1989 film &quot;Glory&quot;.

==Organization and early service==

General recruitment of African Americans for service in the Union Army was authorized by the Emancipation Proclamation issued by President Lincoln on January 1, 1863. Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton accordingly instructed the Governor of Massachusetts, John A. Andrew, to begin raising regiments including &quot;persons of African descent&quot; on January 26, 1863. Andrew selected Robert Gould Shaw to be the regiment&#x27;s colonel and Norwood Penrose &quot;Pen&quot; Hallowell to be its lieutenant colonel. Like many officers of regiments of African-American troops, both Robert Gould Shaw and Hallowell, captains at the time, were promoted several grades. The rest of the officers were evaluated by Shaw and Hallowell: these officers included Luis Emilio, and Garth Wilkinson &quot;Wilkie&quot; James, brother of Henry James and William James. Many of these officers were of abolitionist families, and Governor Andrew himself chose several. Lt. Col. Norwood Hallowell was joined by his younger brother Edward Needles Hallowell, who commanded the 54th as a full colonel for the rest of the war after Shaw&#x27;s death. Twenty-four of the 29 officers were veterans, but only six had been previously commissioned.

The soldiers were recruited by black abolitionists like Frederick Douglass and Major Martin Robison Delany, M.D., and white abolitionists, including Shaw&#x27;s parents. Lieutenant J. Appleton, the first white man commissioned in the regiment, posted a notice in the &quot;Boston Journal&quot;. Wendell Phillips and Edward L. Pierce spoke at a Joy Street Church recruiting rally, encouraging free blacks to enlist. About 100 people were actively involved in recruitment, including those from Joy Street Church and a group of individuals appointed by Governor Andrew to enlist black men for the 54th. Among those appointed was George E. Stephens, African-American military correspondent to the &quot;Weekly Anglo-African&quot; who recruited over 200 men in Philadelphia and would go on to serve as a First Sergeant in the 54th.

The 54th trained at Camp Meigs in Readville near Boston. While there, they received considerable moral support from abolitionists in Massachusetts, including Ralph Waldo Emerson. Material support included warm clothing items, battle flags, and $500 contributed for the equipping and training of a regimental band. As it became evident that many more recruits were coming forward than were needed, the medical exam for the 54th was described as &quot;rigid and thorough&quot; by the Massachusetts Surgeon-General. This resulted in what he described as &quot;a more robust, strong and healthy set of men were never mustered into the service of the United States.&quot; Despite this, as was common in the Civil War, a few men died of disease before the 54th departed from Camp Meigs.

By most accounts, the 54th left Boston with very high morale. This was despite the fact that Jefferson Davis&#x27;s proclamation of December 23, 1862, effectively put both African-American enlisted men and white officers under a death sentence if captured on the grounds that they were inciting servile insurrection.

After muster into federal service on May 13, 1863, the 54th left Boston with fanfare on May 28, and arrived to more celebrations in Beaufort, South Carolina. They were greeted by local blacks and by Northern abolitionists, some of whom had deployed from Boston a year earlier as missionaries to the Port Royal Experiment. In Beaufort, they joined with the 2nd South Carolina Volunteers, a unit of South Carolina freedmen led by James Montgomery. After the 2nd Volunteers&#x27; successful Raid at Combahee Ferry, Montgomery led both units in a raid on the town of Darien, Georgia. The population had fled, and Montgomery ordered the soldiers to loot and burn the empty town. Shaw objected to this activity and complained over Montgomery&#x27;s head that burning and looting were not suitable activities for his model regiment.

==Battle of Grimball&#x27;s Landing==
The regiment&#x27;s first engagement took place during the Battle of Grimball&#x27;s Landing on James Island, just outside of Charleston, South Carolina, on July 16, 1863. The Union attack on James Island was intended to draw Confederate troops away from Fort Wagner in anticipation of an upcoming Union assault on the fort. During the Battle of Grimball&#x27;s Landing, the 54th Massachusetts stopped a Confederate advance, taking 45 casualties in the process.

In an account of the engagement, which was later published, First Sergeant Robert John Simmons of the 54th Massachusetts (a British Army veteran from Bermuda) described a &quot;desperate battle&quot; in which about 250 pickets of the regiment were attacked by about 900 Confederates. He estimated that a reserve of 3,000 men supported the Confederates in their front. The 54th Massachusetts stopped the Confederate advance then, as he described, &quot;had to fire and retreat toward our own encampment.&quot;

After the engagement, their division commander, Brig. Gen. Alfred H. Terry, complimented &quot;steadiness and soldierly conduct&quot; of 54th Massachusetts by courier to Col. Shaw and in his official report of the action. This recognition raised the morale of the regiment.

==Battle of Fort Wagner==
The regiment gained widespread acclaim on July 18, 1863, when it spearheaded an assault on Fort Wagner, a key position overlooking the water approach to Charleston Harbor. The 54th Massachusetts had only recently returned from James Island after a difficult withdrawal during which they spent two days without food. They returned to the main Union force late on the afternoon of July 18 and the tired and hungry men were immediately placed in the vanguard of the assault force of 4,000 men. The assault was launched at 7:45 pm along a narrow spit of land. The distance to the Confederate line was some , and the spit and treacherous marshland&#x27;s narrow confines disorganized the attackers. The approach required them to pass beyond some of the Confederate fortifications before turning to make their assault. The men crossed a water-filled ditch and took the fort&#x27;s outer wall. Because of the strength of the defending force, the position could only be held for an hour before the two Union brigades were withdrawn at around 9:00 pm.

The 54th Massachusetts numbered 600 men at the time of the assault. Of these, 270 were killed, wounded, or captured during the engagement. Col. Shaw was killed, along with 29 of his men; 24 more later died of wounds, 15 were captured, 52 were missing in action and never accounted for, and 149 were wounded. These casualties represented the highest in the history of the regiment during a single engagement. Two company commanders were killed during the attack.

Although Union forces were not able to take and hold the fort, the 54th was widely acclaimed for its valor during the battle, and the event helped encourage the further enlistment and mobilization of African-American troops, a critical development that President Abraham Lincoln once noted as helping to secure the final victory. Decades later, Sergeant William Harvey Carney was awarded the Medal of Honor for grabbing the U.S. flag as the flag bearer fell, carrying the flag to the enemy ramparts and back, and saying &quot;Boys, the old flag never touched the ground!&quot; which would be turned into a song in his honor in 1900. While other African Americans had since been granted the award by the time it was presented to Carney, Carney&#x27;s is the earliest action for which the Medal of Honor was awarded to an African American.

After the battle of Fort Wagner many officers had been killed leading to vacancies in leadership. Non-commissioned officers exercised de-facto control of their companies due to these vacancies. Rather than promote black soldiers to these open roles, inexperienced whites were brought from other regiments to lead the 54th Massachusetts, many of whom lacked the same anti-slavery convictions as the previous white officers.

==Battle of Olustee==
Under the command of now-Colonel Edward Hallowell, the 54th fought a rear-guard action covering the Union retreat to Jacksonville Florida after their defeat at the Battle of Olustee. During the retreat they, along with the 35th United States Colored Troops, were able to repulse the Confederate advance and secure the Union withdrawal to Jacksonville. The 54th Massachusetts was sent up from the reserves into the fight as the seventh New Hampshire and Eighth Colored Troops broke into retreat. It was here that their delaying action covered the withdrawal of the Union forces, with the 54th Massachusetts expending over 20,000 rounds of ammunition. After the Battle there was a large number of wounded soldiers and abandoned equipment from the 54th Massachusetts, as well as the Federal Cavalry, and part of the 7th Connecticut. Fortunately for the Union forces, the Confederate pursuit of their massive retreat was poorly executed, and the Union soldiers were able to retreat to safety. While retreating, the unit was suddenly ordered to counter-march back to Ten Mile station. The locomotive of a train carrying wounded Union soldiers had broken down, and the wounded were in danger of capture. When the 54th arrived, the men attached ropes to the engine and cars and manually pulled the train approximately to Camp Finegan, where horses were secured to help pull the train. After that, the train was pulled by both men and horses to Jacksonville for a total distance of . It took forty-two hours to pull the train that distance. The Union army successfully retreated to Jacksonville two days after the battle on February 22. By the end of the ordeal, from the arrival of the 54th Massachusetts to Olustee, the fighting of the battle, and then the retreat back to Jacksonville, the troops had marched roughly 120 miles in a span of four and a half days, causing exhaustion within the regiment.

This defeat at Olustee, along with the Union retreat after the battle, was not without consequences; there were 1,861 total casualties for the Union: 203 deaths, 1,152 wounded, and 506 missing in action. Of that total, 87 casualties came from the 54th Massachusetts during their rearguard action with 3 officers and 84 enlisted men either being killed, wounded or missing. In contrast to the Confederate forces, this total was greatly imbalanced; with 946 casualties for the Confederates, a 5,400 strong force, roughly equal to what the Union had brought to the battle.

In the aftermath of the war, discrepancies appeared surrounding the battle of Olustee, which revolved around the involvement of the 7th Connecticut and the 54th Massachusetts. Brevet Major General Joseph Hawley, commanding the second brigade of Seymour&#x27;s army, containing the 7th Connecticut, 7th New Hampshire and Eighth United States Colored Troops, was frustrated by what he considered inaccuracy in newspaper reports. He stated, &quot;The papers are so full of lies that I know that no true history of any event was ever or ever will be written&quot;. Hawley wrote to Charles Dudley saying, &quot;Don&#x27;t publish the damned lie that anybody on foot but the 7th Conn. covered the entire retreat from Olustee. The &#x27;officer&#x27; who wrote the lie that the 54th Mass. and the 1st Nor. Car. &#x27;Saved the day&#x27; and &#x27;covered the retreat&#x27; deserves to be shot.

Later in the Florida campaign, as part of an all-black brigade under Col. Alfred S. Hartwell, the 54th Massachusetts unsuccessfully attacked entrenched Confederate militia at the November 1864 Battle of Honey Hill. In mid-April 1865, they fought at the Battle of Boykin&#x27;s Mill, a small affair in South Carolina that proved to be one of the last engagements of the war.

==Pay controversy==
The enlisted men of the 54th were recruited on the promise of pay and allowances equal to their white counterparts. This was supposed to amount to subsistence and $13 a month. Instead, they were informed upon arriving in South Carolina that the Department of the South would pay them only $7 per month ($10 with $3 withheld for clothing, while white soldiers did not pay for clothing at all.) Colonel Shaw and many others immediately began protesting the measure. Joseph Barquet, another member of the regiment, also protested the quality of the food which the soldiers were given, which led to him being court-martialed. Although Massachusetts offered to make up the difference in pay, on principle, a regiment-wide boycott of the pay tables on paydays became the norm.

After Shaw&#x27;s death at Fort Wagner, Colonel Edward Needles Hallowell took up the fight to get full pay for the troops. Lt. Col. Hooper took command of the regiment starting June 18, 1864. After nearly a month, Colonel Hallowell returned on July 16.

Refusing their reduced pay became a point of honor for the men of the 54th. In fact, at the Battle of Olustee, when ordered forward to protect the retreat of the Union forces, the men moved forward shouting, &quot;Massachusetts and Seven Dollars a Month!&quot;

The Congressional bill, enacted on June 16, 1864, authorized equal and full pay to those enlisted troops who had been free men as of April 19, 1861. Of course, not all the troops qualified. Colonel Hallowell, a Quaker, rationalized that because he did not believe in slavery, he could have all the troops swear that they were free men on April 19, 1861. Before being given their back pay, the entire regiment was administered what became known as &quot;the Quaker oath&quot;. Colonel Hallowell skillfully crafted the oath to say: &quot;You do solemnly swear that you owed no man unrequited labor on or before the 19th day of April 1861. So help you God&quot;.

On September 28, 1864, the U.S. Congress took action to pay the men of the 54th. Most of the men had served 18 months.

==Legacy==
A monument to Shaw and the 54th Massachusetts regiment, constructed 1884–1898 by Augustus Saint-Gaudens on the Boston Common, is part of the Boston Black Heritage Trail. A plaster of this monument was also displayed in the entryway to the U.S. paintings galleries at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900.

Governor John A. Andrew said of the regiment, &quot;I know not where, in all of human history, to any given thousand men in arms there has been committed a work at once so proud, so precious, so full of hope and glory.&quot;

A famous composition by Charles Ives, &quot;Col. Shaw and his Colored Regiment&quot;, the opening movement of &quot;Three Places in New England&quot;, is based both on the monument and the regiment.

Sergeant Stephen A. Swails of the 54th Massachusetts regiment became the first African American to receive commission as an officer of a combat regiment of the regular Union army.

Colonel Shaw and his men feature prominently in Robert Lowell&#x27;s Civil War centennial poem &quot;For the Union Dead.&quot; It was originally titled &quot;Colonel Shaw and the Massachusetts&#x27; 54th&quot; and published in &quot;Life Studies&quot; (1959). In the poem, Lowell uses the Robert Gould Shaw memorial as a symbolic device to comment on broader societal change, including racism and segregation, as well as his more personal struggle to cope with a rapidly changing Boston.

A Union officer had asked the Confederates at Battery Wagner for the return of Shaw&#x27;s body but was informed by the Confederate commander, Brigadier General Johnson Hagood, &quot;We buried him with his niggers.&quot; Shaw&#x27;s father wrote in response that he was proud that Robert, a fierce fighter for equality, had been buried in that manner. &quot;We hold that a soldier&#x27;s most appropriate burial-place is on the field where he has fallen.&quot; As a recognition and honor, at the end of the Civil War, the 1st South Carolina Volunteers, and the 33rd Colored Regiment were mustered out at the Battery Wagner site of the mass burial of the 54th Massachusetts.

More recently, the story of the unit was depicted in the 1989 Academy Award-winning film &quot;Glory&quot;, starring Matthew Broderick as Shaw, Denzel Washington as Private Trip, Morgan Freeman, Cary Elwes, Jihmi Kennedy and Andre Braugher The film re-established the now-popular image of the combat role African Americans played in the Civil War, and the unit, often represented in historical battle reenactments, now has the nickname the &quot;Glory&quot; regiment.

==2008 reactivation==
The unit was reactivated on November 21, 2008, to serve as the Massachusetts Army National Guard ceremonial unit to render military honors at funerals and state functions. The new unit is known as the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Regiment.

<text>Processual archaeology (formerly, the New Archaeology) is a form of archaeological theory. It had its beginnings in 1958 with the work of Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips, &quot;Method and Theory in American Archaeology,&quot; in which the pair stated that &quot;American archaeology is anthropology, or it is nothing&quot; (Willey and Phillips, 1958:2), a rephrasing of Frederic William Maitland&#x27;s comment: &quot;My own belief is that by and by, anthropology will have the choice between being history, and being nothing.&quot; The idea implied that the goals of archaeology were the goals of anthropology, which were to answer questions about humans and human culture. This was meant to be a critique of the former period in archaeology, the cultural-history phase in which archaeologists thought that information artifacts contained about past culture would be lost once the items became included in the archaeological record. Willey and Phillips believed all that could be done was to catalogue, describe, and create timelines based on the artifacts.

Proponents of processual archaeology claimed that the rigorous use of the scientific method made it possible to get past the limits of the archaeological record and to learn something about the lifestyles of those who created or used artifacts. Colin Renfrew, a proponent of processual archaeology, observed in 1987 that it focuses attention on &quot;the underlying historical processes which are at the root of change&quot;. Archaeology, he noted, &quot;has learnt to speak with greater authority and accuracy about the ecology of past societies, their technology, their economic basis and their social organization. Now it is beginning to interest itself in the ideology of early communities: their religions, the way they expressed rank, status and group identity.&quot;

==Theory==
Processual archaeologists believe they can understand past cultural systems through the remains they left behind. One theory that influences this is Leslie White&#x27;s theory that culture can be defined as the exosomatic (outside the body) means of environmental adaptation for humans. That is, archaeologists study cultural adaptation to environmental change rather than the humans&#x27; adaptation over generations, which is dealt with by evolutionary biologists. This focus on environmental adaptation is based on the cultural ecology and multilinear evolution ideas of anthropologists such as Julian Steward. In exosomatic adaptation, the culture is determined by its environmental constraints. As a result, processual archaeologists propose that cultural change happens within a set predictable framework, and they seek to understand the adaptation analyzing its components. Moreover, because the framework is predictable, science is the key to unlocking how those components interacted with the culture as a whole. Consequently, processual archaeologists hold that cultural changes are driven by evolutionary &quot;processes&quot; in cultural development. The resulting cultural changes would be adaptive relative to the environment. In this framework, the changes within the culture are not only understandable, but also scientifically predictable once the interaction of the variables is understood. In effect, archeologists should then be able to completely reconstruct these &quot;cultural processes.&quot; Hence the name &quot;processual archaeology,&quot; and its practitioners becoming known as &quot;new archaeologists&quot;.

Scientifically however, the challenge facing proponents of New archaeology was developing a methodology of analyzing the archaeological remains in a more scientific fashion, as no such framework existed. The lack of this type of analysis in works of archeological science led Willey and Phillips to state in 1958, &quot;So little work has been done in American archaeology on the explanatory level that it is difficult to find a name for it&quot;. Different researchers had alternative approaches to this problem. Lewis Binford felt that ethno-historical (history of peoples) information was necessary to facilitate an understanding of archaeological context. Ethno-historical research involves living and studying the life of those who would have used the artifacts—or at least studying a similar culture. Binford wanted to prove that the Mousterian assemblage, a group of stone artifacts from France during the ice age, was adapted to its environment. To prove this, Binford spent time with the Nunamiut of Alaska, a people living in conditions very similar to those of France during the period in question. Binford was successful with this approach, and though his specific problem ultimately eluded complete understanding, the ethno-historical work he did is often referred to by researchers today and has since been emulated by many.

The new methodological approaches of the processual research paradigm include logical positivism (the idea that all aspects of culture are accessible through the material record), the use of quantitative data, and the hypothetico-deductive model (scientific method of observation and hypothesis testing).

During the late 1960s and into the 1970s, archaeologist Kent Flannery began championing the idea that systems theory could be used in archaeology to approach questions of culture from an unbiased perspective, as the study focuses on the symbiotic whole of a culture rather than its parts, or artifacts. Systems theory however, proved to have problematic limitations for archaeology as a whole, in that it works well when describing how elements of a culture interact, but performs poorly when describing why they interact the way they do. Despite its lacking, Systems Theory has become a very important part of processualism, as it sets archaeologists with parameters to examine other cultures unique to its peoples, while limiting interference from the researcher&#x27;s own cultural biases.

An example of processualism, in the field of paleolinguistics, Colin Renfrew—who in his 1987 re-examining of Proto-Indo-European language made a case for the spread of Indo-European languages through neolithic Europe in connection with the spread of farming—outlined three basic primary processes through which a language comes to be spoken in a specific area. These processes are initial colonization, replacement, and continuous development. Supported by linguistic analyses, accepted migration progressions, and archeological records, Renfrew proposed a radical new conclusion that contradicted long-held linguistic-origin theories. With Renfrew&#x27;s proposal being far from conclusive, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published the findings, claiming that Renfrew&#x27;s work has since been both supported and challenged in multiple studies by linguists, archaeologists, biologists, geneticists, statisticians, and computational mathematicians. Though Renfrew&#x27;s conclusions still garner debate, the scientific understanding gained from the wide interdisciplinary studies demonstrates processual analyses of a complex topic provides valuable data that can be analyzed, refuted, and built upon to further understand cultural history.

==Further theoretical development==
In 1973, the processualist David Clarke of Cambridge University would publish an academic paper in &quot;Antiquity&quot; claiming that as a discipline, archaeology had moved from its original &quot;noble innocence&quot; through to &quot;self-consciousness&quot; and then onto &quot;critical self-consciousness&quot;, a symptom of which was the development of the New Archaeology. As a result, he argued, archaeology had suffered a &quot;loss of innocence&quot; as archaeologists became skeptical of the work of their predecessors. Clarke&#x27;s paper would later be described as &quot;one of the seminal statements of the New Archaeology, by one of its leading proponents&quot; in Britain, if not elsewhere, by the archaeologists Caroline Malone and Simon Stoddart.

Processualism&#x27;s development transformed archaeology, and is sometimes called the &quot;New Archaeology.&quot; With few notable exceptions such as Boston University, universities in America classify archaeology as a sub-discipline of anthropology, while in Europe it is thought to be a subject more like historical studies. It is important to analyze which sciences are related because such analysis highlights the questions of what archaeology ought to study and in what ways. Like the other social scientists, the New Archaeologists or processualists wanted to utilize scientific methodology in their work. Archaeology, and in particular archaeology of the historical period, has sometimes been allied more with humanities disciplines, such as Classics. The question of where to put archaeology as a discipline, and its concomitant issues of what archaeology ought to study and which methods it ought to use, likely played no small part in the emergence of post-processualism in Europe.

==Legacy==

In his 2010 book on archaeological theory Matthew Johnson, then of the University of Southampton, now at Northwestern University, argued that despite the 40 years since its development, the &quot;intellectual questions&quot; first posed by processualism remained &quot;absolutely central&quot; to archaeology.

==Criticism==
Processual archaeologist David L. Clarke suggested that the New Archaeology would face particular opposition from amateurs, historical archaeologists, and practical excavators but argued that such individuals would still benefit from the theory&#x27;s adoption.

Processualism began to be critiqued soon after it emerged, initiating a theoretical movement that would come to be called post-processualism. Post-processualist critics consider the main weaknesses of processual archaeology to be:
*environmental determinism
*lack of human agency
*view of cultures as homeostatic, with cultural change only resulting from outside stimuli
*failure to take into account factors such as gender, ethnicity, identity, social relations etc.
*supposed objectivity of interpretation

Writing in 1987, the archaeologist Christopher Chippindale of Cambridge University spoke on the view of processualism at that time, putting it in the context of the 1960s, when he stated that:The sharper students of the current generation reasonably regard the &quot;New Archaeology&quot; in its pristine form as a period piece, as strange an artefact of that remote era as the Paris &quot;évènements&quot; or Woodstock. They have some cause: the then-radical insistence that nothing valuable had been written in archaeology before 1960 matched the hippie belief that anyone over 30 was too ancient to be intelligent, and the optimism that &quot;anything&quot; could be recovered from the archaeological record if only you searched hard enough was the archaeological version of the hope that the Pentagon could be levitated if only enough people had sufficient faith.

<text>Stanley Ben Prusiner (born May 28, 1942) is an American neurologist and biochemist. He is the director of the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Prusiner discovered prions, a class of infectious self-reproducing pathogens primarily or solely composed of protein, a scientific theory considered by many as a heretical idea when first proposed. He received the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 1994 and the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1997 for research on prion diseases developed by him and his team of experts (D. E. Garfin, D. P. Stites, W. J. Hadlow, C. M. Eklund) beginning in the early 1970s.

==Early life, career and research==
He was born in Des Moines, Iowa, into a Jewish family to Miriam (Spigel) and Lawrence Prusiner, an architect. He spent his childhood in Des Moines and Cincinnati, Ohio, where he attended Walnut Hills High School, where he was known as &quot;the little genius&quot; for his groundbreaking work on a repellent for Boxelder bugs. Prusiner received a Bachelor of Arts degree in chemistry from the University of Pennsylvania and later received his M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Prusiner then completed an internship in medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. Later Prusiner moved to the National Institutes of Health, where he studied glutaminases in &quot;E. coli&quot; in the laboratory of Earl Stadtman.

After three years at NIH, Prusiner returned to UCSF to complete a residency in neurology. Upon completion of the residency in 1974, Prusiner joined the faculty of the UCSF neurology department. Since that time, Prusiner has held various faculty and visiting faculty positions at both UCSF and UC Berkeley.

Since 1999, Prusiner has been director of the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases research laboratory at UCSF, working on prion diseases, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and tauopathies.

==Prion: an heretical idea==
In his 1998 PNAS review article on Prions, Prusiner wrote: &quot;The idea that scrapie prions were composed of an amyloidogenic protein was truly heretical when it was introduced&quot; (by Tikvah Alper).
Encephalopathy was a mysterious disease that attacks the brain, and leaves the brains of its victims full of holes. Scientists did not know what pathogen or disease-causing organism that produced such pattern. Prusiner and his co-workers suggested &quot;One scientific theory, viewed as heretical in that it seems to challenge the role of nucleic acids as the exclusive carriers of genetic information.&quot; This theory suggested that this pathogen might be a &quot;deadly variety of a normal protein that has the ability to amplify itself in the brain. The hypothetical protein is called a prion (pronounced PREE-on).&quot;

==Awards and honors==
Stanley Prusiner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1997 for his work in proposing an explanation for the cause of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (&quot;mad cow disease&quot;) and its human equivalent, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. In this work, he coined the term &quot;prion&quot;, which comes from the words &quot;proteinaceous&quot; and &quot;infectious,&quot; in 1982 to refer to a previously undescribed form of infection due to protein misfolding.

Prusiner was elected to the National Academy of Science in 1992 and to its governing council in 2007. He is also an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1993), a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1997, and the American Philosophical Society (1998), the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (2003), and the Institute of Medicine.

<text>Post-processual archaeology, which is sometimes alternatively referred to as the interpretative archaeologies by its adherents, is a movement in archaeological theory that emphasizes the subjectivity of archaeological interpretations. Despite having a vague series of similarities, post-processualism consists of &quot;very diverse strands of thought coalesced into a loose cluster of traditions&quot;. Within the post-processualist movement, a wide variety of theoretical viewpoints have been embraced, including structuralism and Neo-Marxism, as have a variety of different archaeological techniques, such as phenomenology.

The post-processual movement originated in the United Kingdom during the late 1970s and early 1980s, pioneered by archaeologists such as Ian Hodder, Daniel Miller, Christopher Tilley and Peter Ucko, who were influenced by French Marxist anthropology, postmodernism and similar trends in sociocultural anthropology. Parallel developments soon followed in the United States. Initially post-processualism was primarily a reaction to and critique of processual archaeology, a paradigm developed in the 1960s by &#x27;New Archaeologists&#x27; such as Lewis Binford, and which had become dominant in Anglophone archaeology by the 1970s. Post-processualism was heavily critical of a key tenet of processualism, namely its assertion that archaeological interpretations could, if the scientific method was applied, come to completely objective conclusions.

In the United States, archaeologists widely see post-processualism as an accompaniment to the processual movement, while in the United Kingdom, they remain largely thought of as separate and opposing theoretical movements. In other parts of the world, post-processualism has made less of an impact on archaeological thought.

== Approach to archaeology ==

=== Subjectivism ===
The post-processualists&#x27; approach to archaeology is diametrically opposed to that of the processualists. The processualists, as positivists, believed that the scientific method should and could apply to archaeological investigation, therefore allowing archaeologists to present objective statements about past societies based upon the evidence. Post-processual archaeology, however, questioned this stance, and instead emphasized that archaeology was subjective rather than objective, and that what truth could be ascertained from the archaeological record was often relative to the viewpoint of the archaeologist responsible for unearthing and presenting the data. As the archaeologist Matthew Johnson noted, &quot;Postprocessualists suggest that we can never confront theory and data; instead, we see data through a cloud of theory.&quot;

=== Interpretation ===
Due to the fact that they believe archaeology to be inherently subjective, post-processualists argue that &quot;all archaeologists... whether they overtly admit it or not&quot;, always impose their own views and biases into their interpretations of the archaeological data. In many cases, they hold that this bias is political in nature. Post-processualist Daniel Miller believed that the positivist approach of the processualists, in holding that only that which could be sensed, tested and predicted was valid, only sought to produce technical knowledge that facilitated the oppression of ordinary people by elites. In a similar criticism, Miller and Chris Tilley believed that by putting forward the concept that human societies were irresistibly shaped by external influences and pressures, archaeologists were tacitly accepting social injustice. Many post-processualists took this further and criticised the fact that archaeologists from wealthy, Western countries were studying and writing the histories of poorer nations in the Second and Third Worlds. Ian Hodder stated that archaeologists had no right to interpret the prehistories of other ethnic or cultural groups, and that instead they should simply provide individuals from these groups with the ability to construct their own views of the past. While Hodder&#x27;s viewpoint was not universally accepted among post-processualists, there was enough support for opposing racism, colonialism and professional elitism within the discipline that in 1986 the World Archaeological Congress was established.

A number of post-processualists, such as Michael Shanks, Christopher Tilley and Peter Ucko, undermined &quot;archaeology&#x27;s claims to be an authoritative source of knowledge about the past&quot;, thereby &quot;encourag[ing] people to question and resist all forms of authority… This position was hailed by its supporters as democratizing archaeology and purging it… of elitist pretensions&quot;.

== Understanding past societies ==

=== Materialism and idealism ===
Whereas the processualists had been firm materialists, and the culture-historical archaeologists had, by contrast, been idealists, the post-processualists argued that past societies should be interpreted through both materialist and idealist ideas. As Johnson noted, &quot;Many postprocessualists claim that we should reject the whole opposition between material and ideal in the first place.&quot; While recognizing that past societies would have interpreted the world around them in a partially materialistic way, the post-processualists argue that many historic societies have also placed a great emphasis on ideology (which included religion) in both interpreting their world and influencing their behaviour. Examples of this can be seen in the work of Bernard Knapp, who examined how the social elite manipulated ideology to maintain their political and economic control, and of Mike Parker Pearson, who asserted that tools were just as much a product of ideology as were a crown or a law code.

Using an example to explain this belief in materialist-idealist unity, the archaeologist Matthew Johnson looked at the idea of landscape among past societies. He argued that:

:On the one hand, a materialist view of landscape tends to stress how it may be seen in terms of a set of resources, for example for hunter-gatherers or early farming groups. This leads one to turn, for example, to optimal foraging theory and other economic models for an understanding of how people exploited the landscape &#x27;rationally&#x27;. Postprocessualists like to argue that landscapes are always viewed in different ways by different peoples. They reject the &#x27;rational&#x27; view of &#x27;landscape-as-a-set-of-resources&#x27; as that of our own society and one that is ideologically loaded in its own way, loaded towards ideas of commodity and exploitation found in our own society. They suggest that ancient peoples would have had different views of what was &#x27;real&#x27; in that landscape. On the other hand, an exclusively idealist view of landscape does not work either. Postprocessualists like to stress that such an understanding of landscape was not formed in the abstract—that the way people moved around and used that landscape affected their understanding of it.

=== Structuralism ===
Many, although not all post-processualists have adhered to the theory of structuralism in understanding historical societies. Structuralism itself was a theory developed by the French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss (1908–2009), and held to the idea that &quot;cultural patterns need not be caused by anything outside themselves… [and that] underlying every culture was a deep structure, or essence, governed by its own laws, that people were unaware of but which ensured regularities in the cultural productions that emanate from it.&quot; At the centre of his structuralist theory, Lévi-Strauss held that &quot;all human thought was governed by conceptual dichotomies, or bilateral oppositions, such as culture/nature, male/female, day/night, and life/death. He believed that the principle of oppositions was a universal characteristic inherent in the human brain, but that each culture was based on a unique selection of oppositions&quot;. This structuralist approach was first taken from anthropology and applied into forms of archaeology by the French archaeologist André Leroi-Gourhan (1911–1986), who used it to interpret prehistoric symbols in his 1964 work, .

Within the post-processual movement, Ian Hodder became &quot;the leading exponent of a structuralist approach&quot;. In a 1984 article, he looked at the similarities between the houses and the tombs of Neolithic Europe, and used a structuralist approach as a basis for his ideas on their symbolism. He then went on, in his seminal book &quot;The Domestication of Europe&quot; (1990), to use structuralist ideas to come up with his theory that within Neolithic Europe, there was a dichotomy between field (&quot;agrios&quot;) and house (&quot;domus&quot;), with this duality being mediated by a boundary (&quot;foris&quot;).

=== Human agency ===
Post-processualists have also adopted beliefs regarding human agency, arguing that in other theoretical approaches to archaeology such as cultural-historical and processual, &quot;the individual is lost&quot;, and humans are therefore portrayed as &quot;passive dupes who blindly follow social rules.&quot; Post-processualists instead argue that humans are free agents who in many cases act in their own interests rather than simply following societal rules, and by accepting these ideas, post-processualists argue that society is conflict-driven. Influenced by the sociologist Anthony Giddens (born 1938) and his structuration theory, many post-processualists accepted that most human beings, while knowing and understanding the rules of their society, choose to manipulate them rather than following them obediently. In turn, by bending the societal rules, these rules eventually change.

Other post-processualists have instead taken the view of sociologist Karl Marx (1818–1883) that class conflict was the force for this social change. In this manner they share similarities with Marxist archaeologists. A minority of post-processualists, such as Julian Thomas have however argued that human agency is not a useful aspect for looking at past societies, thereby accepting a culturally determinist position.

== Marginalised archaeologies ==
Post-processualism places great emphasis on encouraging marginalised groups to interact with archaeology.

=== Gender archaeology ===

In the 1960s and 1970s, feminist archaeology emerged as adherents of the second wave feminist movement began to argue that women in the archaeological record had been ignored by archaeologists up until that time. According to archaeologist Sam Lucy, &quot;The agendas of feminist archaeology and post-processualism highlighted the importance of social and political factors on supposedly &#x27;objective&#x27; investigation&quot;.

===Indigenous archaeology===
== History ==

=== Precedents ===
Although it would not be actually termed &quot;post-processual archaeology&quot; until 1985 (by one of its most prominent proponents, Ian Hodder), an archaeological alternative to processual archaeology had begun to develop during the 1970s. Some had already anticipated the theory&#x27;s emergence, with the social anthropologist Edmund Leach informing the assembled archaeologists at a 1971 discussion on the topic of &quot;The Explanation of Culture Change&quot; held at the University of Sheffield that cultural structuralism, which was then popular among social anthropologists, would soon make its way into the archaeological community.

Bruce Trigger, a Canadian archaeologist who produced a seminal study of archaeological theory, identified the existence of three main influences upon post-processualism. The first of these was &quot;the Marxist-inspired social anthropology that had developed in France during the 1960s and already had influenced British social anthropology.&quot; This, Trigger noted, &quot;had its roots not in orthodox Marxism but in efforts to combine Marxism and structuralism by anthropologists such as Maurice Godelier, Emmanuel Terray, and Pierre-Phillipe Rey&quot;. The second main influence was postmodernism, which &quot;emphasized the subjective nature of knowledge and embraced extreme relativism and idealism&quot;. Having originated among the disciplines of comparative literature, literary criticism and cultural studies, postmodernist thinking had begun to develop within archaeology. The third influence identified by Trigger was the New cultural anthropology movement within the cultural anthropological discipline, which had arisen after the collapse of Boasian anthropology. The new cultural anthropologists &quot;denounced studies of cultural evolution as being ethnocentric and intellectually and morally untenable in a multicultural, postcolonial environment.&quot;

=== Origins in Britain ===
Post-processual archaeology began in Britain during the late 1970s, spearheaded by a number of British archaeologists who had become interested in aspects of French Marxist anthropology. Most prominent among these was Ian Hodder (born 1948), a former processualist who had made a name for himself for his economic analysis of spatial patterns and early development of simulation studies, particularly relating to trade, markets and urbanization in Iron Age and Roman Britain. Having been influenced by the &quot;New Geography&quot; and the work of the processualist David Clarke, as his research progressed, he became increasingly sceptical that such models and simulations actually tested or proved anything, coming to the conclusion that a particular pattern in the archaeological record could be produced by a number of different simulated processes, and that there was no way to accurately test which of these alternatives was correct. In effect, he came to believe that even using the processual approach to understanding archaeological data, there were still many different ways that that data could be interpreted, and that therefore radically different conclusions could be put forward by different archaeologists, despite processualism&#x27;s claim that using the scientific method it could gain objective fact from the archaeological record. As a result of this, Hodder grew increasingly critical of the processualist approach, developing an interest in how culture shaped human behaviour. He was supported in this new endeavour by many of his students, including Matthew Spriggs.

In 1980 these early post-processualists held a conference at Cambridge University, from which a book was produced, entitled &quot;Symbolic and Structural Archaeology&quot; (1982), which was edited by Hodder himself and published by Cambridge University Press. In his introduction to the book, Hodder noted that:

:During the early period of exploration and development of ideas, premature conference presentations and individual seminars were given by various members of the Cambridge group in other archaeological departments in England and abroad. Individual scholars who were invited to talk to us in Cambridge in that period often felt, understandably, obliged to maintain a distinct opposition. While it is certainly the case that these presentations had occurred before our views had even begun to settle down, and that they were excessively aggressive, they played an important role in the process of enquiry and reformulation. In particular, the contrasts which were set up by us and by outside scholars allowed the views of the seminar group, and the differences of viewpoint within the group, to be clarified. The opposition highlighted our own opinion but also threw the spotlight on the blind alleys down which there was a danger of straying. Our aggression resulted from the conviction that we were doing something new. This, too, was important. In the initial period there was a clear idea of what was wrong with existing approaches and there was a faith that something else could be done.

Bruce Trigger considered this book to be &quot;a postprocessual showcase and counterpart to &quot;New Perspectives in Archaeology&quot;&quot;, the 1968 book written by American archaeologist Lewis Binford (1931–2011) that helped to launch the processual movement.

=== Development in the United States ===
Post-processual archaeology developed largely independently among the archaeological community in the United States. As such its primary influence was critical theory, as opposed to the French Marxist anthropology which had been the primary influence upon their British counterparts. Many American archaeologists had begun to recognise issues of bias within the scientific community, and within the processual movement itself which attempted to be scientific. They also began to notice elements of ethnic prejudice within archaeology, particularly in regards to Native American peoples, who had commonly not had a chance to participate in their own heritage management up until the 1990s. Many American archaeologists also began to take note of a gender bias in the archaeological interpretation and in the discipline as a whole, as women had been largely marginalised. The 1980s saw archaeological studies finally being published that dealt with this issue, namely through Joan Gero&#x27;s paper on &quot;Gender bias in archaeology: a cross-cultural perspective&quot; (1983) and Margaret Conkey and Janet Spector&#x27;s paper on &quot;Archaeology and the Study of Gender&quot; (1984). Among the post-processualists, less emphasis was put on correcting class biases in the American archaeological record than had been put into studying gender and ethnic differences. Instead, it was mostly among historical archaeologists (those who study the archaeology of the historic, or literate period of the past), that such investigation into marginalised classes such as workers and slaves took place.

== Criticism ==
As the archaeologists Colin Renfrew and Paul Bahn noted, &quot;For its most severe critics, [post-processualism], while making a number of valid criticisms, simply developed some of the ideas and theoretical problems introduced by [processualism]. To these critics it brought in a variety of approaches from other disciplines, so that the term &quot;postprocessual,&quot; while rather neatly echoing the epithet &quot;postmodern&quot; in literary studies, was a shade arrogant in presuming to supersede what it might quite properly claim to complement.&quot;

In their article &quot;Processual Archaeology and the Radical Critique&quot; (1987), Timothy K. Earle and Robert W. Preucel examined the post-processual movement&#x27;s &quot;radical critique&quot; of processualism, and while accepting that it had some merit and highlighted some important points, they came to the conclusion that on the whole, the post-processual approach was flawed because it failed to produce an explicit methodology.

<doc id="160144" wikidata="Q7663881" url="?curid=160144" title="Systems theory in archaeology">
<text>Systems theory in archaeology is the application of systems theory and systems thinking in archaeology. It originated with the work of Ludwig von Bertalanffy in the 1950s, and is introduced in archaeology in the 1960s with the work of Sally R. Binford and Lewis Binford&#x27;s &quot;New Perspectives in Archaeology&quot; and Kent V. Flannery&#x27;s &quot;Archaeological Systems Theory and Early Mesoamerica&quot;.

== Overview ==
Bertalanffy attempted to construct a general systems theory that would explain the interactions of different variables in a variety of systems, no matter what those variables actually represented. A system was defined as a group of interacting parts and the relative influence of these parts followed rules which, once formulated could be used to describe the system no matter what the actual components were. 

Binford stated the problem in &quot;New Perspectives in Archaeology&quot;, identifying the low range theory, the middle range theory, and the upper range theory. 
* The low range theory could be used to explain a specific aspect of a specific culture, such as the archaeology of Mesoamerican agriculture. 
* A middle range theory could describe any cultural system outside of its specific cultural context, for example, the archaeology of agriculture. 
* An upper range theory can explain any cultural system, independent of any specifics and regardless of the nature of the variables. 
At the time Binford thought the middle range theory may be as far as archaeologists could ever go, but in the mid-1970s some believed that systems theory offered the definitive upper range theory.

Archaeologist Kent Flannery described the application of systems theory to archaeology in his paper &quot;Archaeological Systems Theory and Early Mesoamerica&quot;. Systems theory allowed archaeologists to treat the archaeological record in a completely new way. No longer did it matter what was being looked at, because it was being broken down to its elemental system components. Culture may be subjective, but unless the model of systems theory is attacked in general and as long as it is treated mathematically the same way a retreating glacier is treated, the results were objective. In other words, the problem of cultural bias no longer had any meaning, unless it was a problem with systems theory itself. Culture was now just another natural system that could be explained in mathematical terms.

== Criticism ==
Archaeologists found it was rarely possible to use systems theory in a rigorously mathematical way. While it provided a framework for describing interactions in terms of types of feedback within the system, it was rarely possible to put the quantitative values that systems theory requires for full use, as Flannery himself admits. The result was that in the long run systems theory turned out to be more useful in describing change than in explaining it.

Systems theory also eventually went on to show that predictions that a high amount of cultural regularities would be found were certainly overly optimistic during the early stages of processual archaeology, the opposite of what processual archaeologists were hoping it would be able to do with systems theory. However, systems theory is still used to describe how variables inside a cultural system can interact.

Systems theory, at least, was important in the rise of processual archaeology and was a call against culture-historical methods of past generations. It held argument that one could contemplate the past impartially and sidestep pitfalls through rigour.

<doc id="160153" wikidata="Q198341" url="?curid=160153" title="Jorge Castro (boxer)">
<text>Jorge Fernando &quot;Locomotora&quot; Castro () (born August 18, 1967) is an Argentine former professional boxer and former WBA middleweight champion of the world, who is best known for his second defense of the title against John David Jackson in 1994.

==Early years==
Castro, who in 1985 was set to become a professional boxer but suffered a bicycle accident that left him injured so badly that doctors told him he&#x27;d never be able to fight as a professional, recuperated from the accident and turned professional, defying the doctor&#x27;s predictions, in 1987.

==Professional career==
In December 1991, at Palais Omnisports, Bercy, France, Castro lost to Terry Norris by a wide unanimous decision in a challenge for the WBC super welterweight title. It was reported that prior to the bout, Castro had done roadwork for the first time in his life.

In June 1992, at the Civic Center in Pensacola, Florida, United States, Castro lost a wide decision over ten rounds to future pound for pound king Roy Jones Jr.

Castro became a world champion in 1994 by defeating Reggie Johnson in Buenos Aires by split decision to win the vacant WBA middleweight title. After defeating Alex Ramos by a knockout in two rounds to retain the belt, he travelled to Monterrey, Mexico, to defend against the former undefeated holder of the WBA title John David Jackson in December 1994.

What began merely as an undercard world title fight in a pay-per-view program featuring Félix Trinidad vs Oba Carr and Julio César Chávez vs Tony Lopez, soon became a fight that is part of boxing&#x27;s lore. Castro was trailing badly on all three scorecards, with one eye closed and the other one only halfway opened, bleeding and taking combination after combination against the ropes. Seemingly on the verge of being stopped, Castro landed a left hook to Jackson&#x27;s chin and Jackson hit the floor. Jackson got up, but he suffered two more knockdowns and Castro completed what could be said that was one of the greatest turnarounds ever in a boxing fight, retaining the title by a knockout in the ninth round.

At the press conference after the fight, Castro called his winning punch &quot;La mano de Dios&quot;, (&quot;The hand of God&quot;), in reference to the Hand of God goal by Diego Maradona during a win by Argentina national football team at the 1986 FIFA World Cup, which, like the fight, had taken place in Mexico. Therefore, that moment became known as boxing&#x27;s version of &quot;The hand of God&quot;. The fight, and its ending, were talked about for months on many boxing magazines and books.

Castro defended his title another two times, including a rematch win over Reggie Johnson, and then he lost the title to Shinji Takehara by a decision in twelve. He split two 10-round decisions with Roberto Durán, winning the first in Argentina, but losing the rematch in Panama, and then he gave Jackson a rematch, this time winning by a decision in ten.

Castro has lost two more world championship fights: in December 2000, he went to Germany and lost by a knockout in 10 to WBC cruiserweight champion Juan Carlos Gómez, and in February 2002, he went to Phoenix and challenged IBF cruiserweight champion Vassiliy Jirov, a Kazakhstan native who lives in Phoenix, losing by a decision in twelve. Despite his failures in these attempts to become a world champion again, he did not announce a retirement until 2013.

On June 18, 2005, Jorge Castro suffered a car accident in Buenos Aires, with a collapsed lung and some broken ribs. The accident and its consequences were similar to the one suffered by archrival Duran in Buenos Aires a few years before. Castro required hospitalization and emergency surgery, and was in stable condition after the surgery. He recuperated from his injuries.

On April 22, 2006, Castro fought Jose Luis Herrera, losing by a fourth-round knockout. He had his &quot;revenge&quot; against the same opponent on January 27, 2007, when Castro won by technical K.O. in the second round.

Currently, he has a record of 130 wins, 11 losses and 3 draws, with 89 knockout wins, which ranks him among the most prolific knockout winners in boxing history according to the records of Ring Magazine.

==Professional boxing record==

==Trivia==

*In Argentina, he is also known as &quot;el Roña&quot; (Spanish for &#x27;the dirt&#x27;).
*On May 13, 2007, &quot;Locomotora&quot; Castro joined the reality TV show &quot;Gran Hermano Famosos&quot; (&quot;Big Brother&quot;), along with 13 other celebrities from Argentina. The show was aired on Telefe Channel. Castro was the 8th eliminated, after staying in the house 58 days.
* He was a contestant in Bailando 2011, but he and his partner, Sofía Macaggi, were the 2nd couple eliminated.

<text>Carmita Jiménez (August 3, 1939 – August 10, 2003) was a Puerto Rican singer who was considered a diva in Puerto Rico. She was born in San Lorenzo. Carmita Jiménez started her singing career at the young age of six, on the radio show named &quot;El Abuelito Welch&quot; (&quot;Grandpa Welch&quot;) with another legendary Puerto Rican show business legend, José Miguel Agrelot. This show, as its name suggested, was sponsored by the Welch&#x27;s grape juice brand.

At 15, Jimenez performed the &quot;Habanera&quot; from Bizet&#x27;s opera &quot;Carmen&quot;. Soon after, she joined popular music groups like the Moncho Usera orchestra, and then she released her first album, which contained the hit &quot;Tierra Rica&quot; (&quot;Rich Earth&quot;).

During the 1960s, Jimenez became a popular fixture on Puerto Rico&#x27;s television and enjoyed great renown. She decided then that it was time to internationalize her career and moved to Peru in 1961, to promote herself in South America. Her stay in Peru, which lasted until 1968, made her very popular among the citizens of that country too. There she gave birth to her only daughter, María Nahíma, who as her mother, began singing professionally since a child. Carmita kept on releasing albums and scoring more hits.

After she returned to Puerto Rico in 1968, she landed her own section on WAPA-TV&#x27;s popular lunch-time show &quot;El Show Del Mediodia&quot;.

During the 1970s, Carmita became a part of the Disco Music movement in her country, and had the number one hit &quot;La Generacion De Hoy&quot; (&quot;Today&#x27;s Generation&quot;), produced by Alfred D. Herger, which was followed by &quot;La Vida En Rosa&quot; (&quot;Life In Pink&quot;), a song which was later a hit in English too, Grace Jones performing the English version.

Jimenez began bringing down her yearly number of appearances since 1985, becoming a more private person. In September 1990 she debuted as a stage actress in the San Juan premiere production of Rodolfo Santana&#x27;s &quot;Baño de Damas&quot;, with an all-star cast that included Gladys Rodriguez, Giselle Blondet, Marisol Calero, and Johanna Rosaly. In February 1991 she returned to the stage as Sister Mary Hubert (Sor María José) in the San Juan premiere production of Dan Goggins&#x27; musical comedy &quot;Sor-Presas&quot; (Nunsense). Both productions played at the historic Tapia Theater in Old San Juan. In 1994, she participated in a concert named &quot;Algo Mas Que Una Cantante&quot; (&quot;More Than Just a Singer&quot;) at San Juan&#x27;s Centro de Bellas Artes, a concert which reunited many international singing super-stars.

As it turned out, there was a reason for her winding down the number of public appearances each year: In 2002, she announced during an interview with Vea that she had been diagnosed with cancer in 1985. The fact is that the cancer she had for almost 20 years had spread into bone metastasis and she battled it all that time. She tried several cures, including a 4 month-visit to a private clinic in Switzerland with her daughter, singer and lyricist Maria Nahima. Carmita died at her home in Caguas, Puerto Rico after succumbing to breast cancer. She was buried at Cementerio Borinquen Memorial Park I in Caguas, Puerto Rico.
One of the rooms at the (a performing arts center in Caguas which underwent major renovations after Hurricane Maria) is named after Carmita Jiménez.

<text>Phineas Taylor Barnum (July 5, 1810 – April 7, 1891) was an American showman, businessman, and politician remembered for promoting celebrated hoaxes and founding with James Anthony Bailey the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. He was also an author, publisher, and philanthropist, although he said of himself: &quot;I am a showman by profession ... and all the gilding shall make nothing else of me.&quot; According to Barnum&#x27;s critics, his personal aim was &quot;to put money in his own coffers&quot;. The adage &quot;there&#x27;s a sucker born every minute&quot; has frequently been attributed to him, although no evidence exists that he had coined the phrase.

Barnum became a small-business owner in his early twenties and founded a weekly newspaper before moving to New York City in 1834. He embarked on an entertainment career, first with a variety troupe called &quot;Barnum&#x27;s Grand Scientific and Musical Theater&quot;, and soon after by purchasing Scudder&#x27;s American Museum, which he renamed after himself. He used the museum as a platform to promote hoaxes and human curiosities such as the Fiji mermaid and General Tom Thumb. In 1850, he promoted the American tour of Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind, paying her an unprecedented $1,000, , per night for 150 nights. He suffered economic reversals in the 1850s from unwise investments, as well as years of litigation and public humiliation, but he embarked on a lecture tour as a temperance speaker to emerge from debt. His museum added America&#x27;s first aquarium and expanded its wax-figure department.

Barnum served two terms in the Connecticut legislature in 1865 as a Republican for Fairfield, Connecticut. He spoke before the legislature concerning the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which abolished slavery and involuntary servitude: &quot;A human soul, &#x27;that God has created and Christ died for,&#x27; is not to be trifled with. It may tenant the body of a Chinaman, a Turk, an Arab, or a Hottentot—it is still an immortal spirit.&quot; He was elected in 1875 as mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut, where he worked to improve the water supply, bring gas lighting to streets and enforce liquor and prostitution laws. He was instrumental in the inception of Bridgeport Hospital in 1878 and was its first president. The circus business, begun when he was 60 years old, was the source of much of his enduring fame. He established P. T. Barnum&#x27;s Grand Traveling Museum, Menagerie, Caravan &amp; Hippodrome in 1870, a traveling circus, menagerie and museum of &quot;freaks&quot; that adopted many names over the years.

Barnum was married to Charity Hallett from 1829 until her death in 1873, and they had four children. In 1874, a few months after his wife&#x27;s death, he married Nancy Fish, his friend&#x27;s daughter and 40 years his junior. They were married until 1891 when Barnum died of a stroke at his home. He was buried in Mountain Grove Cemetery, Bridgeport, which he designed himself.

==Early life and family==
Barnum was born in Bethel, Connecticut, the son of innkeeper, tailor and storekeeper Philo Barnum (1778–1826) and Philo&#x27;s second wife, Irene Taylor. Barnum&#x27;s maternal grandfather Phineas Taylor was a Whig, legislator, landowner, justice of the peace, and lottery schemer who had a great influence upon him.

==Career beginnings ==
Barnum ran several businesses, including a general store, a book-auctioning trade, real estate speculation and a statewide lottery network. He started a weekly newspaper in 1831 called &quot;The Herald of Freedom&quot; in Bethel, Connecticut. His editorials against the elders of local churches led to libel suits and prosecution, and he was imprisoned for two months. While incarcerated, Barnum sought the help of Rev. L.F.W. Andrews, publisher of the &quot;Gospel Witness&quot; from Hartford. Barnum and Andrews then published a joint paper, the &quot;Herald of Freedom and Gospel Witness.&quot; They dissolved their partnership a year later in October 1833. Barnum then moved the publication of the paper to neighboring Danbury, Connecticut.

In November 1834, after publishing 160 issues of the &quot;Herald of Freedom&quot;, Barnum passed control of the paper to his brother-in-law, John W. Amerman, who published the paper for another year in Norwalk, Connecticut. When Amerman sold the paper to Mr. George Taylor, the Barnum family&#x27;s connection to the &quot;Herald of Freedom&quot; ended. Barnum sold his store in 1834.

He began his career as a showman in 1835 at the age of 25 with the purchase and exhibition of a blind and almost completely paralyzed slave woman named Joice Heth, whom an acquaintance was billing around Philadelphia as George Washington&#x27;s 161 year-old former nurse. Slavery was already outlawed in New York, but Barnum exploited a loophole that allowed him to lease Heth for a year for $1,000, borrowing $500 to complete the sale. Barnum forced her to work for 10 to 12 hours per day, and she died in February 1836 at no more than 80 years of age. Barnum hosted a live autopsy of Heth&#x27;s body in a New York saloon to demonstrate her actual age before spectators paying 50 cents each.

==Showman and promotions==


Barnum had a year of mixed success with his first variety troupe, Barnum&#x27;s Grand Scientific and Musical Theater, followed by the Panic of 1837 and three years of difficult circumstances. He purchased Scudder&#x27;s American Museum in 1841, located at Broadway and Ann Street in Manhattan. Renaming it Barnum&#x27;s American Museum, he improved it, upgrading the building and adding exhibits.

It became a popular showplace. He added a lighthouse lamp that attracted attention up and down Broadway and flags along the roof&#x27;s edge that attracted attention in daytime, while giant paintings of animals between the upper windows drew attention from pedestrians. The roof was transformed to a strolling garden with a view of the city, where Barnum launched hot-air balloon rides daily. A changing series of live acts and curiosities were added to the exhibits of stuffed animals, including albinos, giants, little people, jugglers, magicians, exotic women, detailed models of cities and famous battles and a menagerie of animals.

===Fiji mermaid and Tom Thumb===

In 1842, Barnum introduced his first major hoax: a creature with the body of a monkey and the tail of a fish known as the &quot;Feejee&quot; mermaid. He leased it from fellow museum owner Moses Kimball of Boston who became his friend, confidant and collaborator. Barnum justified his hoaxes by calling them advertisements to draw attention to the museum. He said, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in duping the public, but I believe in first attracting and then pleasing them.&quot;

He followed the mermaid act by exhibiting the four-year-old actor Charles Stratton, billed as the 11-year-old General Tom Thumb. Stratton was taught to imitate famous figures such as Hercules and Napoleon.

In 1843, Barnum hired the Native American dancer Do-Hum-Me, the first of many Natives that he would present. During 1844–45, he toured with General Tom Thumb in Europe and met Queen Victoria, who was amused but saddened by Stratton, and the event was a publicity coup. It opened the door to visits with royalty throughout Europe, including the tsar of Russia, and enabled Barnum to acquire many new attractions, including automatons and other mechanical marvels. During this time, he bought other museums, including artist Rembrandt Peale&#x27;s Philadelphia Museum (the nation&#x27;s first major museum), and the Baltimore Museum and Gallery of Fine Arts. By late 1846, Barnum&#x27;s American Museum was drawing 400,000 visitors per year.

===Jenny Lind===
Barnum became aware of the popularity of Jenny Lind, the &quot;Swedish Nightingale&quot;, during his European tour with Tom Thumb when her career was at its height in Europe. Barnum, admittedly unmusical, had never heard Lind&#x27;s voice but he offered her the chance to sing in the US at $1,000 a night for 150 nights, with all expenses paid.

Lind demanded the fee in advance, and Barnum agreed. She used the fee to raise a fund for charities, principally endowing schools for poor children in Sweden. Barnum borrowed heavily on his mansion and his museum to raise the money to pay Lind. He was still short of funds, so he persuaded a Philadelphia minister that Lind would be a positive influence on American morals, and the minister lent him the final $6,000. The contract also afforded Lind the option of withdrawing from the tour after 60 or 100 performances, paying Barnum $50,000 (~$ in ) if she did so.

Lind and her small company sailed to the US in September 1850. She was a celebrity before she arrived, following Barnum&#x27;s months of preparations. Nearly 40,000 people greeted her at the docks and another 20,000 at her hotel, and merchandise was sold. When Lind realized how much money she stood to earn from the tour, she insisted upon a new agreement, which Barnum signed on September 3, 1850. This paid Lind the original fee plus the remainder of each concert&#x27;s profits after Barnum&#x27;s $5,500 management fee. Lind was determined to accumulate as much money as possible for her charities.
The tour began with a concert at Castle Garden on September 11, 1850. It was a major success, recouping Barnum four times his investment. Washington Irving proclaimed, &quot;She is enough to counterbalance, of herself, all the evil that the world is threatened with by the great convention of women. So God save Jenny Lind!&quot; Tickets for some of her concerts were in such demand that Barnum sold them at auction, and public enthusiasm was so strong that the press coined the term &quot;Lind mania&quot;. The blatant commercialism of Barnum&#x27;s ticket auctions distressed Lind, and she persuaded him to reserve a substantial portion of tickets at reduced prices.

On the tour, Barnum&#x27;s publicity always preceded Lind&#x27;s arrival and generated enthusiasm, as he had as many as 26 journalists on his payroll. After New York, the company toured the East Coast with continued success and later traveled through the southern states and Cuba. By early 1851, Lind had become uncomfortable with Barnum&#x27;s relentless marketing of the tour, and she invoked a contractual right to sever her ties with him. They parted amicably, and she continued the tour for nearly a year under her own management. Lind performed 93 concerts in the US for Barnum, earning her about $350,000, while Barnum netted at least $500,000, .

===Diversified activities===
Barnum&#x27;s next challenge was to change public attitudes about the theater, which was widely regarded as a salacious enterprise. He wanted theaters to become palaces of edification and delight as respectable middle-class entertainment. He built New York City&#x27;s largest and most modern theater, naming it the Moral Lecture Room. Barnum hoped that this would avoid seedy connotations, attract a family crowd and win the approval of the city&#x27;s moral crusaders. He started the nation&#x27;s first theatrical matinées to encourage families and to lessen the fear of crime.

The theater opened with &quot;The Drunkard&quot;, a thinly disguised temperance lecture. Barnum had become a teetotaler after returning from Europe. He followed it with melodramas, farces and historical plays performed by highly regarded actors. He edited Shakespearean plays and other works such as &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; to render them more palatable for family audiences.

Barnum organized flower shows, beauty contests, dog shows and poultry contests, but the most popular were baby contests. In 1853 he started the pictorial weekly newspaper &quot;Illustrated News&quot;. He completed his autobiography one year later, which sold more than one million copies over the course of numerous revisions. Mark Twain loved the book, but the &quot;British Examiner&quot; thought it &quot;trashy&quot; and &quot;offensive&quot; and wrote that it inspired &quot;nothing but sensations of disgust&quot; and &quot;sincere pity for the wretched man who compiled it.&quot;

In the early 1850s, Barnum began investing to develop East Bridgeport, Connecticut. He extended substantial loans to the Jerome Clock Company to lure it to move to his new industrial area, but the company went bankrupt by 1856, taking Barnum&#x27;s wealth with it. This began four years of litigation and public humiliation. Ralph Waldo Emerson proclaimed that Barnum&#x27;s downfall showed &quot;the gods visible again&quot;, and other critics celebrated Barnum&#x27;s public dilemma. However, Tom Thumb offered his services, as he was touring on his own, and the two began another European tour. Barnum also started a lecture tour, mostly as a temperance speaker. By 1860, he emerged from debt and built a mansion that he called Lindencroft, and he resumed ownership of his museum.

Barnum created America&#x27;s first aquarium and expanded the wax figure section of his museum. His &quot;Seven Grand Salons&quot; demonstrated the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The collections expanded to four buildings, and he published a museum guidebook that claimed 850,000 &quot;curiosities&quot;. Late in 1860, Siamese twins Chang and Eng emerged from retirement and appeared at Barnum&#x27;s museum for six weeks. Also in 1860, Barnum introduced Zip the Pinhead, a microcephalic black man who spoke a mysterious language created by Barnum. In 1862, Barnum discovered giantess Anna Swan and dwarf Commodore Nutt, a new Tom Thumb with whom Barnum visited President Abraham Lincoln at the White House.

During the Civil War, Barnum&#x27;s museum drew large audiences seeking diversion from the conflict. He added pro-Union exhibits, lectures and dramas, and he demonstrated commitment to the cause. He hired Pauline Cushman in 1864, an actress who had served as a spy for the Union, to lecture about her &quot;thrilling adventures&quot; behind Confederate lines. Barnum&#x27;s Unionist sympathies incited a Confederate sympathizer to start a fire in 1864. Barnum&#x27;s American Museum burned to the ground on July 13, 1865, from a fire of unknown origin. Barnum reestablished it at another location in New York City, but this was also destroyed by fire in March 1868. The loss was too great the second time, and Barnum retired from the museum business.

==Circus==


Barnum did not enter the circus business until he was 60 years old. He established &quot;P. T. Barnum&#x27;s Grand Traveling Museum, Menagerie, Caravan &amp; Hippodrome&quot; in Delavan, Wisconsin in 1870 with William Cameron Coup. It was a traveling circus, menagerie and museum of &quot;freaks&quot; that assumed various names: &quot;P. T. Barnum&#x27;s Travelling World&#x27;s Fair, Great Roman Hippodrome and Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, and &quot;P. T. Barnum&#x27;s Greatest Show on Earth, and the Great London Circus, Sanger&#x27;s Royal British Menagerie and the Grand International Allied Shows United&quot; after an 1881 merger with James Bailey and James L. Hutchinson, soon shortened to &quot;Barnum &amp; Bailey&#x27;s&quot;. This was the first circus to display three rings.

The show&#x27;s first primary attraction was Jumbo, an African elephant that Barnum purchased in 1882 from the London Zoo. The Barnum and Bailey Circus still contained acts similar to his Traveling Menagerie, including acrobats, freak shows and General Tom Thumb. Barnum persisted in growing the circus in spite of more fires, train disasters and other setbacks, and he was aided by circus professionals who ran the daily operations. He and Bailey parted ways in 1885, but they rejoined in 1888 with the &quot;Barnum &amp; Bailey Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, later the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, which toured the world.

Barnum was among the first circus owners to move his circus by train, a suggestion by Bailey and other business partners, and probably the first to own his own train. He became known as the &quot;Shakespeare of Advertising&quot; because of his innovative and impressive ideas. In this new business venture, Barnum leaned on the advice of Bailey and other business partners.

==Author and debunker==

Barnum wrote several books, including &quot;Life of P. T. Barnum&quot; (1855), &quot;The Humbugs of the World&quot; (1865), &quot;Struggles and Triumphs&quot; (1869), &quot;Forest and Jungle, or, Thrilling Adventures in All Quarters of the Globe&quot; and &quot;The Art of Money-Getting&quot; (1880).

Barnum was often called the Prince of Humbugs and felt that entertainers and vendors perpetrating hoaxes (or &quot;humbugs&quot;) in promotional material were justified if the public received value in return. However, he was contemptuous of those who accrued money through fraud, especially the spiritualist mediums popular in his day. He testified against noted &quot;spirit photographer&quot; William H. Mumler in his trial for fraud, and he exposed the tricks employed by mediums to cheat the bereaved. In &quot;The Humbugs of the World&quot;, Barnum offered $500 () to any medium who could prove the power to communicate with the dead.

== Role in politics ==
Barnum was significantly involved in politics. He mainly focused on race, slavery and sectionalism in the period preceding the American Civil War. He opposed the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854, which supported slavery, and left the Democratic Party because it had endorsed slavery. Barnum joined the new anti-slavery Republican Party.

Barnum claimed that &quot;politics were always distasteful to me&quot;, but he was elected to the Connecticut General Assembly in 1865 as a Republican representing Fairfield. He hired spies to acquire insider information on the New York and New Haven Railroad lines and exposed a secret that would raise fares by 20 percent. He said during the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution: &quot;A human soul, &#x27;that God has created and Christ died for,&#x27; is not to be trifled with. It may tenant the body of a Chinaman, a Turk, an Arab or a Hottentot—it is still an immortal spirit.&quot; He acknowledged that he had owned slaves when he lived in the South: &quot;I whipped my slaves. I ought to have been whipped a thousand times for this myself. But then I was a Democrat—one of those &quot;nondescript&quot; Democrats, who are Northern men with Southern principles.&quot;

Barnum was elected for the next four Connecticut legislature sessions and succeeded senator Orris S. Ferry. He was the legislative sponsor of an 1879 law that prohibited the use of &quot;any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception&quot; and criminalized acting as an accessory to the use of contraception. This law remained in effect in Connecticut until it was overturned in 1965 by the U.S. Supreme Court in its &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; decision.

Barnum campaigned for the U.S. Congress in 1867 and lost to his third cousin William Henry Barnum. In 1875, he served as mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut to improve the water supply, bring gas lighting to streets and enforce liquor and prostitution laws. He was instrumental in the inception of Bridgeport Hospital, founded in 1878, and was its first president.

==Profitable philanthropy==
Barnum enjoyed what he publicly dubbed &quot;profitable philanthropy&quot;, saying: &quot;If by improving and beautifying our city Bridgeport, Connecticut, and adding to the pleasure and prosperity of my neighbors, [and] I can do so at a profit, the incentive to &#x27;good works&#x27; will be twice as strong as if it were otherwise.&quot; He was appointed to the board of trustees of Tufts University prior to its founding. He extended several significant contributions to the school, including a gift of $50,000, , in 1883 to establish a museum, later known as Barnum Museum of Natural History, and hall for the department of natural history. Tufts made Jumbo the Elephant the school&#x27;s mascot. Tufts students are known as Jumbos.

==Personal life and death==

On November 8, 1829, Barnum married Charity Hallett, and they had four children: Caroline Cornelia (1833–1911), Helen Maria (1840–1915), Frances Irena (1842–1844) and Pauline Taylor (1846–1877). His wife died on November 19, 1873. In 1874, he married Nancy Fish, the daughter of his close friend John Fish and 40 years Barnum&#x27;s junior.

Barnum died from a stroke at home in 1891 at the age of 80. He is buried in Mountain Grove Cemetery in Bridgeport, Connecticut, a cemetery that he designed.

==Legacy==

Barnum built four mansions in Bridgeport, Connecticut: Iranistan, Lindencroft, Waldemere and Marina. Iranistan was the most notable, a Moorish Revival architecture designed by Leopold Eidlitz with domes, spires and lacy fretwork inspired by the Royal Pavilion in Brighton, England. It was built in 1848 but it was destroyed by fire in 1857. The Marina was demolished by the University of Bridgeport in 1964 in order to build a cafeteria.

At his death, critics praised Barnum for his philanthropy and called him an icon of American spirit and ingenuity. He asked the &quot;Evening Sun&quot; to print his obituary just prior to his death so that he might read it. On April 7, 1891, Barnum asked about the box-office receipts for the day, and a few hours later, he died.

In 1893, a statue in Barnum&#x27;s honor was erected by his former partners James Bailey, James A. Hutchinson and W. W. Cole at Seaside Park in Bridgeport. Barnum had donated the land for the park in 1865. His circus was sold to Ringling Brothers on July 8, 1907, for $400,000, . The Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey circuses ran separately until they merged in 1919, forming the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus.

The United States Mint issued a commemorative coin in 1936 for Bridgeport&#x27;s centennial celebration with Barnum&#x27;s portrait for the obverse. Cartoonist Walt Kelly, a Bridgeport native, named a character in Barnum&#x27;s honor in his &quot;Pogo&quot; comic strip. An ongoing annual multi-week Barnum Festival has been held since 1949 in Bridgeport. The Bethel Historical Society commissioned a life-sized sculpture to honor the 200th anniversary of his birth, created by local resident David Gesualdi and placed outside the public library. The statue was dedicated in September 2010.

In 1883 Barnum cofounded, with Charles E. Tooker, the Bridgeport &amp; Port Jefferson Steamboat Company, which continues to operate across Long Island Sound between Port Jefferson, New York and Bridgeport. The company owns and operates three vessels, one of which is named the M.V. &quot;PT Barnum&quot;. The Barnum Museum in Bridgeport houses many of his oddities and curiosities.

<text>Cesare Baronio, C.O. (as an author also known as Caesar Baronius; 30 August 1538 – 30 June 1607) was an Italian Oratorian, cardinal and historian of the Catholic Church. His best-known works are his &quot;Annales Ecclesiastici&quot; (&quot;Ecclesiastical Annals&quot;), which appeared in 12 folio volumes (1588–1607). He is under consideration for sainthood and, in 1745, Pope Benedict XIV declared him &quot;Venerable.&quot;

== Life ==
Cesare Baronio was born in the Duchy of Sora (present day Sora in Italy) on 31 October 1538, the only child of Camillo Baronio and his wife Porzia Febonia. His family was of Neapolitan origin.

Baronio was educated at Veroli and Naples, where he commenced his law studies in October 1556. Because of the fear of an imminent French invasion, he left Naples on 29 October 1557, and traveled to Rome, where he continued his legal studies and obtained a doctorate &quot;in utroque iure&quot; in 1561. He took up residence in a house on the Piazza Duca, now the Piazza Farnese, not far from the church of San Girolamo della Carità, where Philip Neri lived. Baronio was soon drawn to the circle of Philip Neri, who opened a meeting place for churchmen and laity who were interested in intellectual discussions on religion and philosophy. The Bible, church reform, ethics, and liturgy were some of the main themes of their evening discussions. Among those who frequented the evening meetings at Neri&#x27;s residence were some of the most influential church leaders of the Counter-Reformation - Charles Borromeo, Federico Borromeo, Jacopo Sadoleto, and Gian Matteo Giberti, to name a few.

Contacts with such illustrious humanist-reformers and the charismatic Neri brought about a dramatic change in the young Baronio. As a result he switched his main interest from law to theology. In 1557 Baronio became a member of the Congregation of the Oratory founded by Philip Neri, and was ordained to the subdiaconate on 21 December 1560 and to the diaconate on 20 May 1561. Ordination to the priesthood followed in 1564. 

Neri directed Baronius to focus his attention on the study and explanation of Church History. Baronius spent the next few years balancing his studies, lectures, and continued involvement in apostolic work. In 1588, he began to publish the &quot;Annales&quot;. He succeeded Philip Neri as superior of the Roman Oratory in 1593.

Pope Clement VIII, whose confessor he was from 1594, made him a cardinale on 5 June 1596 and also appointed him to head the Vatican Library. Baronio was given the red hat on 8 June and on 21 June was assigned the title of Cardinal Priest of Santi Nereo e Achilleo. Baronio restored this titular church and in 1597 a procession was held to transfer there a number of relics. Baronius also renovated the Church of San Gregorio Magno al Celio.

At subsequent conclaves, Baronio was twice considered to be papabile – the conclaves which in the event elected Pope Leo XI and Pope Paul V. On each occasion, Baronio was opposed by Spain on account of his work &quot;On the Monarchy of Sicily&quot;, in which he supported the papal claims against those of the Spanish government. In 1602 he commissioned the Oratorio di Santa Silvia in San Gregorio Magno al Celio.

Baronio&#x27;s last days were spent in the Oratory at Santa Maria in Vallicella. He found solace in the humble surroundings of the Oratory and in the company of his fellow religious. There he died on 30 June 1607, and was buried in that same church. He was named &quot;Venerable&quot;, an honor to which Pope Benedict XIV elevated him in 1745.

==Works==
Baronio is best known for his &quot;Annales Ecclesiastici&quot;. It was after almost three decades of lecturing at Santa Maria in Vallicella that he was asked by Philip Neri to tackle this work, as an answer to a polemical anti-Catholic historical work, the &quot;Magdeburg Centuries&quot;. Baronio was at first unwilling that the task should be given to him and tried to persuade Neri to entrust the work to Onofrio Panvinio, who was already working on a history of the Church. After repeated commands from Neri, however, Baronius changed his mind and spent the rest of his life devoted to this enormous task.

In the &quot;Annales&quot;, he treats history in strict chronological order and keeps theology in the background. Lord Acton called it &quot;the greatest history of the Church ever written&quot;. In the &quot;Annales&quot;, Baronio coined the term &quot;Dark Age&quot; in the Latin form &quot;saeculum obscurum&quot;, to refer to the period between the end of the Carolingian Empire in 888 and the first inklings of the Gregorian Reform under Pope Clement II in 1046.

Notwithstanding its errors, especially in Greek history where he was obliged to depend upon secondhand information, Baronio&#x27;s work stands as an honest attempt at historiography. Sarpi, in urging Casaubon to write a refutation of the &quot;Annales&quot;, warned him never to accuse or suspect Baronio of bad faith.

Baronio also undertook a new edition of the Roman Martyrology (1586), in the course of his work he applied critical considerations to removed entries he considered implausible for historical reasons, and added or corrected others according to what he found in the sources to which he had access. He is also considered as saying, cited in the context of the controversies about the work of Copernicus and Galileo, &quot;The Bible teaches us how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go.&quot; This remark, which probably Baronio (according to some) made in conversation with Galileo, before the controversy, as he died before it, was cited by the latter (without precise attribution) in his &quot;Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina&quot; (1615).

At the time of the Venetian Interdict, Baronio published a pamphlet, &quot;Paraenesis ad rempublicam Venetam&quot; (1606). It took a stringent papalist line on the crisis. It was answered in the same year by the &quot;Antiparaenesis ad Caesarem Baronium&quot; of Nicolò Crasso.

==Biographies==
A Latin biography of Baronio by the oratorian Hieronymus Barnabeus (Girolamo Barnabeo or Barnabò) appeared in 1651 as &quot;Vita Caesaris Baronii&quot;. Another Oratorian, Raymundus Albericus (Raimondo Alberici), edited three volumes of Baronio&#x27;s correspondence from 1759. There are other biographies by Amabel Kerr (1898), and by Generoso Calenzio (&quot;La vita e gli scritti del cardinale Cesare Baronio&quot;, Rome 1907). The works of Mario Borrelli also contributed to the biographia of Baronius.

==Beatification==
Baronio left a reputation for sanctity, which led Pope Benedict XIV to approve the introductions of his cause for canonization; Baronio was proclaimed &quot;Venerable&quot; on 12 January 1745.

In 2007, on the 400th anniversary of his death, a petition was presented by the Procurator General of the Oratory of St Philip Neri. to reopen the cause for his canonization.

<text>The Auckland Islands (Māori: &quot;Motu Maha&quot; &quot;Many islands&quot; or &quot;Maungahuka&quot; &quot;Snowy mountains&quot;) are an archipelago of New Zealand, lying south of the South Island. The main Auckland Island, occupying , is surrounded by smaller Adams Island, Enderby Island, Disappointment Island, Ewing Island, Rose Island, Dundas Island, and Green Island, with a combined area of . The islands have no permanent human inhabitants.

The islands are listed with the New Zealand Outlying Islands. The islands are an immediate part of New Zealand, but not part of any region or district, but instead &quot;Area Outside Territorial Authority&quot;, like all the other outlying islands except the Solander Islands.

Ecologically, the Auckland Islands form part of the Antipodes Subantarctic Islands tundra ecoregion. Along with other New Zealand Subantarctic Islands, they were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998.

== Geography ==

The Auckland Islands lie south of Stewart Island, and from the South Island port of Bluff, between the latitudes 50° 30&#x27; and 50° 55&#x27; S and longitudes 165° 50&#x27; and 166° 20&#x27; E.

They include Auckland Island, Adams Island, Enderby Island, Disappointment Island, Ewing Island, Rose Island, Dundas Island, and Green Island, with a combined area of . The islands are close to each other, separated by narrow channels, and the coastline is rugged, with numerous deep inlets.

Auckland Island, the main island, has an approximate land area of , and a length of . It is notable for its steep cliffs and rugged terrain, which rises to over . Prominent peaks include Cavern Peak (), Mount Raynal (), Mount D&#x27;Urville (), Mount Easton (), and the Tower of Babel (). The southern end of the island broadens to a width of .

Here, the narrow channel of Carnley Harbour (the Adams Straits on some maps) separates the main island from the roughly triangular Adams Island (), which is even more mountainous, reaching a height of at Mount Dick. The channel is the remains of the crater of an extinct volcano, and Adams Island and the southern part of the main island form the crater rim. The main island features many sharply incised inlets, notably Port Ross at the northern end.

The group includes numerous other smaller islands, notably Disappointment Island (northwest of the main island) and Enderby Island (off the northern tip of the main island), altogether covering .

Most of the islands have a volcanic origin, with the archipelago dominated by two 12-million-year-old Miocene shield volcanoes, subsequently eroded and dissected. These rest on older volcanic rocks 15–25 million years old with some older granites and fossil-bearing sedimentary rocks from around 100 million years ago.

=== Islands ===

The following table includes named islands according to Land Information New Zealand.


=== Climate ===
Port Ross features a subpolar oceanic climate (&quot;Cfc&quot; according to the Köppen climate classification system). Like many other Subpolar oceanic climates, Port Ross, along with the Auckland Islands in general, are characterised by the near-constant overcast weather and never being too hot or too cold.

This borders on an extremely mild-wintered, maritime-influenced tundra climate.


Carnley Harbour also features a subpolar oceanic climate (&quot;Cfc&quot; according to the Köppen climate classification system), though it exaggerates the features shown in Port Ross, as it is much wetter and a lot more affected by ocean-moderation.

The Auckland Islands have a fairly constant cool and wet weather year-round, with neither winter being excessively cold nor summer excessively hot. The climate is most similar to that seen in the Faroe Islands and Aleutian Islands.

== History ==
=== Discovery and early exploitation ===
Evidence exists that Polynesian voyagers first discovered the Auckland Islands. Traces of Polynesian settlement, possibly dating to the 13th century, have been found by archaeologists on Enderby Island. This is the most southerly settlement by Polynesians yet known.

The whaler rediscovered the islands in 1806, finding them uninhabited.
Captain Abraham Bristow named them &quot;Lord Auckland&#x27;s&quot; on 18 August 1806 in honour of his father&#x27;s friend William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland (whose son the Earl of Auckland would be namesake of New Zealand&#x27;s largest city). Bristow worked for the businessman Samuel Enderby, the namesake of Enderby Island. The following year Bristow returned on to claim the archipelago for Britain. The explorers Dumont D&#x27;Urville and James Clark Ross visited in 1839 and in 1840 respectively.

Whalers and sealers set up temporary bases, the islands becoming one of the principal sealing stations in the Pacific in the years immediately after their discovery. By 1812, so many seals had been killed that the islands lost their commercial importance and sealers redirected their efforts towards Campbell and Macquarie Islands. Visits to the islands declined, although recovering seal populations allowed a modest revival in sealing in the mid-1820s.

The sealing era lasted from 1807 till 1894, during which time 82 vessels are recorded as visiting for sealing purposes. Some 11 of these ships were wrecked off-shore. Relics of the sealing period include inscriptions, the remains of huts, and graves.

=== Settlement ===

Now uninhabited, the islands saw unsuccessful settlements in the mid-19th century. In 1842, a small party of 70 Māori and their Moriori slaves from the Chatham Islands migrated to the archipelago, surviving for about 20 years or so on sealing and flax growing. Samuel Enderby&#x27;s grandson, Charles Enderby, proposed a community based on agriculture and whaling in 1846. This settlement, established at Port Ross in 1849 and named Hardwicke, lasted only two and a half years. Māori and Moriori settlement continued until 1866, when most of the Māori and some of the Moriori returned to the Chatham Islands; however, most of the Moriori settled on Stewart Island / Rakiura, where some of their descendants continue to live today.

The Auckland Islands were part of the Colony of New Zealand under the Letters Patent of April 1842, which fixed the southern boundary of New Zealand at 53° south, but they were then excluded by the New Zealand Constitution Act 1846, which defined the southern boundary at 47° 10&#x27; south; however, they were again included by the New Zealand Boundaries Act of 1863, an act of the Imperial Parliament at Westminster that extended the boundaries of the colony once more.

=== Shipwrecks ===

The , captained by Thomas Musgrave, was wrecked in Carnley Harbour in 1864. Madelene Ferguson Allen&#x27;s narrative about her great-grandfather, Robert Holding, and the wreck of the Scottish sailing ship , wrecked in the Auckland Islands a few months later in 1864, counterpoints the &quot;Grafton&quot; story. François Édouard Raynal wrote &quot;Wrecked on a Reef&quot;.

In 1866, one of New Zealand&#x27;s most famous shipwrecks, that of the &quot;General Grant&quot;, occurred on the western coast. Ten survivors waited for rescue on Auckland Island for 18 months. Several attempts have failed to salvage its cargo, allegedly including bullion.

Because of the probability of wrecks around the islands, calls arose for the establishment of emergency depots for castaways in 1868. The New Zealand authorities established and maintained three such depots, at Port Ross, Norman Inlet and Carnley Harbour from 1887. They also cached additional supplies, including boats (to help reach the depots) and 40 finger-posts (which had smaller amounts of supplies), around the islands.

A further maritime tragedy occurred in 1907, with the loss of the and 12 of her crew, off Disappointment Island. The 15 survivors lived off the supplies in the Auckland Island depot.

In 2019, a helicopter with three people on board crashed into the ocean near Enderby Island, when they were en route to uplift an ill man on a fishing trawler. All three survived the crash, and were found the next day with only minor injuries. The rescue effort was led by Richard Hayes.

=== Scientific research and reserve ===
Three independent scientific expeditions visited the Auckland Islands in 1840. These included the United States Wilkes Expedition aboard the &quot;USS Porpoise,&quot; d&#x27;Urville&#x27;s second voyage of the &quot;Astrolabe&quot; (French)&quot;,&quot; and the British Ross Expedition aboard the &quot;Erebus&quot; and &quot;Terror.&quot;

The Sub-Antarctic Islands Scientific Expedition of 1907 by the Philosophical Institute of Canterbury, New Zealand, aboard the ship &quot;Hinemoa,&quot; spent two weeks on the islands conducting a magnetic survey and taking botanical, zoological and geological specimens.

From 1941 to 1945, the islands hosted a New Zealand meteorological station as part of a World War II coastwatching programme staffed by scientist volunteers and known for security reasons as the &quot;Cape Expedition&quot;.&quot;&quot; Along with their other duties the Cape Expedition staff undertook biodiversity research and collected scientific specimens. The staff of the Cape Expedition included Robert Falla, later an eminent New Zealand scientist.&quot;&quot; The 1972–1973 Auckland Islands Expedition spent several months studying the fauna and flora of the Auckland Islands.

 the islands have no inhabitants, although scientists visit regularly and the authorities allow limited tourism on Enderby Island and Auckland Island.&quot;&quot;

The marine environment surrounding the archipelago became a marine mammal sanctuary in 1993 and, unusually, also a marine reserve in 2003, measuring . The Subantarctic Islands marine reserves around the Auckland, Antipodes, Bounty and Campbell Islands combined form the largest natural sanctuary in New Zealand.

== Ecology ==

=== Plants ===

The botany of the islands was first described in the &quot;Flora of Lord Auckland and Campbell&#x27;s Islands&quot;, a product of the Ross expedition of 1839–43, written by Joseph Dalton Hooker and published by Reeve Brothers in London between 1843 and 1845. Since then, many other botanists have studied the flora of the Auckland Islands, which comprises 228 vascular plant species, of which over 80% are indigenous and about 20% are introduced.

The vegetation of the islands sub-divides into distinct altitudinal zones. Inland from the salt-spray zone, the fringes of the islands predominantly feature forests of southern rātā &quot;Metrosideros umbellata&quot;, and in places the subantarctic tree daisy (&quot;Olearia lyallii&quot;), probably introduced by sealers. Above this exists a subalpine shrub zone dominated by &quot;Dracophyllum&quot;, &quot;Coprosma&quot; and &quot;Myrsine&quot; (with some rātā). At higher elevations tussock grass and megaherb communities dominate the flora.


=== Invertebrates ===
The islands host the largest communities of subantarctic invertebrates, with 24 species of spider, 11 species of springtail and over 200 insects. These include 57 species of beetle, 110 flies and 39 moths. The islands also boast an endemic genus and species of wētā, &quot;Dendroplectron aucklandensis&quot;.

=== Fresh and saltwater fauna ===
The freshwater environments of the islands host a freshwater fish, the kōaro or climbing galaxias, which lives in saltwater as a juvenile but which returns to the rivers as an adult. The islands have 19 species of endemic freshwater invertebrates, including one mollusc, one crustacean, a mayfly, 12 flies and two caddisflies. The Auckland Islands cockle is endemic to the islands.

=== Marine mammals ===
There are two species of seal which haul out on the islands, the New Zealand fur seal and the threatened New Zealand sea lion. Southern elephant seals are frequent migrants in winter, and leopard seals may also appear.

A well-recovering population in excess of 2,000 southern right whales is found off the islands, and Port Ross area is considered to be the most important and well-established congregating ground for whales in New Zealand waters. Its importance exceeds the Campbell Island ground.

=== Birds ===
The islands hold important seabird breeding colonies, among them albatrosses, penguins and several small petrels, with a million pairs of sooty shearwater. Landbirds include red-fronted and yellow-crowned parakeet, New Zealand falcon, tūī, bellbirds, pipits, and an endemic subspecies of tomtit.

The whole Auckland Island group has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for several species of seabirds as well as eight endemic species or subspecies, including Auckland shag, Auckland teal, Auckland rail, Auckland snipe, Gibson&#x27;s albatross, Auckland Island banded dotterel, Auckland Island tomtit, and the now extinct Auckland Island merganser. The seabirds include southern rockhopper and yellow-eyed penguins; Antipodean, southern royal, light-mantled and white-capped albatrosses; and white-chinned petrel.

=== Ecological history ===
Several introduced species have come to the islands; goats, other useful animals and seed were brought to the islands by Captains Musgrave and Norman 1865, returning to search for castaways; ecologists eliminated or allowed to go extinct cattle, sheep, goats, dogs, possums and rabbits in the 1990s, but feral cats, pigs and mice remain on Auckland Island. The last rabbits on Enderby Island were removed in 1993 through the application of poison, also eradicating mice there. Curiously, rats have never colonised the islands, in spite of numerous visits and shipwrecks and their ubiquity on other islands. Introduced species have significantly negatively altered habitats and ecosystem processes, suppressed vegetation, and reduced or extirpated birds on many of the islands. They have, for example, caused the extinction of the New Zealand merganser, a duck formerly widespread in southern New Zealand, and ultimately confined to the islands until its extinction.

The New Zealand Department of Conservation plans to remove the last remaining introduced mammals from Auckland Island, making the entire island group pest-free, in what would be one of the largest multi-species eradication plans in the world. This project started in November 2018, with NZ$2 million of initial scoping work. The total cost for the eradication could stretch to NZ$40–50 million over 10 years.

<text>Noble Gábor Baross de Bellus (6 July 1848 – 8 May 1892) was a Hungarian statesman in Hungarian parliament, was born at Barossháza now Pružina near Trencsén (now Trenčín, Slovakia). He was for a time one of the professors there under Cardinal Kolos Vaszary. After acquiring considerable local reputation as chief notary of his county, he entered parliament in 1875, where he apparently gained a nickname &quot;Slovak blackman&quot; (tót szerecsen), due to his darker tanned complexity. He at once attached himself to Kálmán Tisza and remained faithful to his chief even after the Bosnian occupation had alienated so many of the supporters of the prime minister.

It was he who drew up the reply to the malcontents on this occasion, for the first time demonstrating his many-sided ability and his genius for sustained hard work. But it was in the field of economics that he principally achieved his fame. In 1883 he was appointed secretary to the ministry of ways and communications. Baross, who had prepared himself for quite another career, and had only become acquainted with the civilized West at the time of the Compromise of 1867, mastered, in an incredibly short time, the details of this difficult department. His zeal, conscientiousness and energy were so universally recognized, that on the retirement of Gábor Kemény, in 1886, he was appointed minister of ways and communications. He devoted himself especially to the development of the national railways, and the gigantic network of the Austro-Hungarian railway system and its unification was mainly his work.

But his most original creation in this respect was the zone system, which immensely facilitated and cheapened the circulation of all wares and produce, and brought the remotest districts into direct communication with the central point at Budapest. The amalgamation of the ministry of commerce with the ministry of ways in 1889 further enabled Baross to realize his great idea of making the trade of Hungary independent of foreign influences, of increasing the commercial productiveness of the kingdom and of gaining every possible advantage for her export trade by a revision of tolls. This patriotic policy provoked loud protests both from Austria and Germany at the conference of Vienna in 1890, and Baross was obliged somewhat to modify his system. This was by no means the only instance in which his commercial policy was attacked and even hampered by foreign courts. But wherever he was allowed a free hand he introduced epoch-making reforms in all the branches of his department, including posts, telegraphs, and so on.

A man of such strength of character was not to be turned from his course by any amount of opposition, and he rather enjoyed to be alluded to as &quot;the iron-handed minister.&quot; The crowning point of his railway policy was the regulation of the Danube at the hitherto impassable Iron-Gates Rapids by the construction of canals, which opened up the eastern trade to Hungary and was an event of international importance. It was while inspecting his work there in March 1892 that he caught a chill, from which he died on 8 May. The day of his burial was a day of national mourning.
In Budapest today he is commemorated by a square () named in his honour, Baross tér, at the front of Budapest Keleti railway station. A large bronze statue of him was reinstated there on 6 December 2013 after several years of major works for the new Budapest Metro Line 4.

<text>Joachim Barrande (11 August 1799 – 5 October 1883) was a French geologist and palaeontologist. He was particularly known for his work on trilobites, published in the &quot;Systéme Silurien de la Bohéme&quot; which he published in 22 parts. Trained under the school of Georges Cuvier, he opposed the evolutionary views of Charles Darwin.

==Life and career==
Barrande was born on the family estate at Saugues, Haute Loire, and he was educated in the École Polytechnique and École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées at Paris. He attended the lectures of Georges Cuvier, Brongniart, Jussieu, Prevost, Serres, Auduoin, and de Blainville. He received the training of an engineer and was initially appointed engineer at Decize where he built an acqueduct over the Loire. While living in Decize he was introduced to Louis-Antoine de Bourbon, duke d&#x27;Angoulême and he was then appointed tutor to family of the duc de Bordeaux (afterwards known as the comte de Chambord), grandson of Charles X. He set up a laboratory for their education at Tuileries that was later destroyed. When the king abdicated in 1830, Barrande accompanied the royal exiles to England and Scotland, and afterwards to Prague. Settling in that city in 1831, he became occupied in engineering works, and his attention was then attracted to the fossils from the Lower Palaeozoic rocks of Bohemia. He began to build up a collection at his home Kleinseite No. 419, Chotekgasse. He also had a house in Paris. Apart from French, he mastered English, German and Czech.

The publication in 1839 of &quot;Murchison&#x27;s Silurian System&quot; incited Barrande to carry on systematic researches on the equivalent strata in Bohemia. For ten years (1840–1850) he made a detailed study of these rocks, engaging workmen specially to collect fossils, and in this way he obtained upwards of 3500 species of graptolites, brachiopoda, mollusca, trilobites and fishes. The first volume of his great work, &quot;Système silurien du centre de la Bohême&quot; (dealing with trilobites, several genera, including &quot;Deiphon&quot;, which he personally described), appeared in 1852; and from that date until 1881, he issued twenty-one quarto volumes of text and plates. Two other volumes were issued after his death in 1887 and 1894. It is estimated that he spent nearly £10,000 on these works. In addition he published a large number of separate papers.

In recognition of his important researches the Geological Society of London in 1857 awarded to him the Wollaston medal. In 1862, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society. In 1870, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1875.

Barrande died at Frohsdorf on 5 October 1883 after suffering from a lung infection. His extensive collection has been stored in National Museum in Prague on grounds of his testament.

In 1884 the Silurian strata at Kuchelbad was named as Barrande rock and a slab with his name was placed on it. This was done by Anton Fritsch and other Czech scientists. On 24 February 1928, a district of Prague, &quot;Barrandov&quot;, was named after him.

==Opposition to evolution==

Barrande was an advocate of the theory of catastrophes (as taught by Georges Cuvier). He later opposed Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution. He rejected transmutation of species. He also wrote a five-volume book on the defense of his theory of so-called &quot;colonies&quot;, presuming that the cause of the presence of fossils typical for one layer surrounded by those typical for another is atectonical. He tended to name those colonies with names of his scientific adversaries. The opponents included Jan Krejci, M. V. Lipold and J.E. Marr.

Barrande also took part victoriously in the dispute concerning the independence of the so-called Taconic System in North America, ending a discussion of many years by proving that the fauna which was discovered by Emmons and Marcou represented his primordial Cambrian fauna.

His anti-evolutionary views were criticized by geologist Henry Hicks who commented that &quot;Barrande is well known to be a determined opponent to the theory of evolution, and doubtless this strong bias has prevented him from seeing and accepting many facts which would otherwise, to so keen and careful an observer, have seemed inconsistent with such strong views.&quot;

<text>Edith Newbold Wharton (; ; January 24, 1862 – August 11, 1937) was an American writer and designer. Wharton drew upon her insider&#x27;s knowledge of the upper-class New York &quot;aristocracy&quot; to portray, realistically, the lives and morals of the Gilded Age. In 1921, she became the first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for her novel &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot;. She was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1996. Her other well-known works are &quot;The House of Mirth&quot;, the novella &quot;Ethan Frome&quot;, and several notable ghost stories.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Edith Newbold Jones was born on January 24, 1862, to George Frederic Jones and Lucretia Stevens Rhinelander, at their brownstone at 14 West Twenty-third Street in New York City. To her friends and family, she was known as &quot;Pussy Jones&quot;. She had two elder brothers, Frederic Rhinelander and Henry Edward. Frederic married Mary Cadwalader Rawle; their daughter was landscape architect Beatrix Farrand. Edith was baptized April 20, 1862, Easter Sunday, at Grace Church.

Wharton&#x27;s paternal family, the Joneses, were a very wealthy and socially prominent family, having made their money in real estate. The saying &quot;keeping up with the Joneses&quot; is said to refer to her father&#x27;s family. She was related to the Rensselaers, the most prestigious of the old patroon families, who had received land grants from the former Dutch government of New York and New Jersey. Her father&#x27;s first cousin was Caroline Schermerhorn Astor. Fort Stevens, in New York, was named for Wharton&#x27;s maternal great-grandfather, Ebenezer Stevens, a Revolutionary War hero and general.

Wharton was born during the Civil War. However, in describing her family life, Wharton does not mention the war, except that their travels to Europe after the war were due to the depreciation of American currency. From 1866 to 1872, the Jones family visited France, Italy, Germany, and Spain. During her travels, the young Edith became fluent in French, German, and Italian. At the age of nine, she suffered from typhoid fever, which nearly killed her, while the family was at a spa in the Black Forest. After the family returned to the United States in 1872, they spent their winters in New York City and their summers in Newport, Rhode Island. While in Europe, she was educated by tutors and governesses. She rejected the standards of fashion and etiquette that were expected of young girls at the time, which were intended to allow women to marry well and to be put on display at balls and parties. She considered these fashions superficial and oppressive. Edith wanted more education than she received, so, she read from her father&#x27;s library and from the libraries of her father&#x27;s friends. Her mother forbade her to read novels until she was married, and Edith obeyed this command.

===Early writing===
Wharton wrote and told stories from an early age. When her family moved to Europe and she was just four or five, she started what she called &quot;making up.&quot; She invented stories for her family and walked with an open book, turning the pages as if reading while improvising a story. Wharton began writing poetry and fiction as a young girl, and she attempted to write her first novel at the age of 11. Her mother&#x27;s criticism quashed her ambition, however, and she turned to poetry. She was 15 years old when her first published work appeared, a translation of a German poem &quot;Was die Steine Erzählen&quot; (&quot;What the Stones Tell&quot;) by Heinrich Karl Brugsch, for which she was paid $50. Her family did not want her name to appear in print, since writing was not considered a proper occupation for a society woman of her time. Consequently, the poem was published under the name of a friend&#x27;s father, E. A. Washburn, a cousin of Ralph Waldo Emerson, who supported women&#x27;s education. In 1877, at the age of 15, she secretly wrote a novella, &quot;Fast and Loose&quot;. In 1878, her father arranged for a collection of two dozen original poems and five translations, &quot;Verses,&quot; to be privately published. Wharton published a poem under a pseudonym in the &quot;New York World,&quot; in 1879. In 1880, she had five poems published anonymously in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, an important literary magazine. Despite these early successes, she was not encouraged by her family or her social circle, and though she continued to write, she did not publish anything more until her poem &quot;The Last Giustiniani&quot; was published in &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in October 1889.

=== The &quot;debutante&quot; years ===
Between 1880 and 1890, Wharton put her writing aside to participate in the social rituals of the New York upper classes. She keenly observed the social changes happening around her, which she later used in her writing. Wharton officially came out as a debutante to society in 1879. She was allowed to bare her shoulders and wear her hair up for the first time at a December dance, which was given by a Society matron, Anna Morton. Wharton began a courtship with Henry Leyden Stevens, the son of Paran Stevens, a wealthy hotelier and real estate investor from rural New Hampshire. His sister, Minnie, married Arthur Paget. The Jones family did not approve of Stevens.

In the middle of her debutante season, the Jones family returned to Europe in 1881 for her father&#x27;s health. In spite of this, her father, George Frederic Jones, died of a stroke in Cannes in 1882. Stevens was with the Jones family in Europe during this time. After returning to the United States with her mother, Wharton continued her courtship with Stevens, announcing their engagement in August 1882. The month the two were to marry, the engagement ended.

Wharton&#x27;s mother, Lucretia Stevens Rhinelander Jones, moved back to Paris in 1883, and she lived there until her death in 1901.

===1880s–1900s===
On April 29, 1885, at the age of 23, Wharton married Edward Robbins (Teddy) Wharton, who was 12 years her senior, at the Trinity Chapel Complex in Manhattan. From a well-established Boston family, he was a sportsman and a gentleman of the same social class and shared her love of travel. The Whartons set up house at Pencraig Cottage in Newport. In 1893, they bought a house named Land&#x27;s End, on the other side of Newport, for $80,000, and moved into it. Wharton decorated Land&#x27;s End, with the help of designer Ogden Codman. In 1897, the Whartons purchased their New York home, 884 Park Avenue. Between 1886 and 1897, they traveled overseas, in the period from February to June, mostly visiting Italy but also Paris and England. From her marriage onwards, three interests came to dominate Wharton&#x27;s life: American houses, writing, and Italy.

From the late 1880s until 1902, Teddy Wharton suffered from chronic depression. The couple, then, ceased their extensive travel. At that time, his depression became more debilitating, after which they lived almost exclusively at their estate, The Mount, in Lenox, Massachusetts. During those same years, Wharton, herself, was said to suffer from asthma and periods of depression.

In 1908, Teddy Wharton&#x27;s mental condition was determined to be incurable. In that year, Wharton began an affair with Morton Fullerton, an author, and foreign correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot; of London, in whom she found an intellectual partner. She divorced Edward Wharton, in 1913, after 28 years of marriage. Around the same time, she was beset with harsh literary criticism from the naturalist school of writers.

In addition to novels, Wharton wrote at least 85 short stories. She was also a garden designer, an interior designer, and a taste-maker of her time. She wrote several design books, including her first major published work, &quot;The Decoration of Houses&quot; (1897), co-authored by Ogden Codman. Another of her &quot;home and garden&quot; books is the generously illustrated &quot;Italian Villas and Their Gardens&quot; of 1904, illustrated by Maxfield Parrish.

===Travels and life abroad===

Over the course of her life, she crossed the Atlantic 60 times. In Europe, her primary destinations were Italy, France, and England. She also went to Morocco. She wrote many books about her travels, including &quot;Italian Backgrounds&quot; and &quot;A Motor-Flight through France&quot;.

Her husband, Edward Wharton, shared her love of travel and for many years, they spent at least four months of each year abroad, mainly in Italy. Their friend, Egerton Winthrop, accompanied them, on many journeys there. In 1888, the Whartons and their friend, James Van Alen, took a cruise through the Aegean islands. Wharton was 26. The trip cost the Whartons $10,000 and lasted four months. She kept a travel journal, during this trip, that was thought to be lost but was later published as &quot;The Cruise of the Vanadis&quot;, now considered her earliest known travel writing.

In 1897, Edith Wharton purchased Land&#x27;s End in Newport, Rhode Island, from Robert Livingston Beeckman, a former U.S. Open Tennis Championship runner-up who became governor of Rhode Island. At the time, Wharton described the main house as &quot;incurably ugly.&quot; Wharton agreed to pay $80,000 for the property, and she spent thousands more to alter the home&#x27;s facade, decorate the interior, and landscape the grounds.

In 1902, Wharton designed The Mount, her estate in Lenox, Massachusetts, which survives, today, as an example of her design principles. She wrote several of her novels there, including &quot;The House of Mirth&quot; (1905), the first of many chronicles of life in old New York. At The Mount, she entertained the cream of American literary society, including her close friend, novelist Henry James, who described the estate as &quot;a delicate French chateau mirrored in a Massachusetts pond&quot;. Although she spent many months traveling in Europe nearly every year, with her friend, Egerton Winthrop (a descendant of John Winthrop), The Mount was her primary residence, until 1911. When living there and while traveling abroad, Wharton was usually driven to appointments by her longtime chauffeur and friend, Charles Cook, a native of nearby South Lee, Massachusetts. When her marriage deteriorated, she decided to move, permanently, to France, living, first, at 53 Rue de Varenne, Paris, in an apartment that belonged to George Washington Vanderbilt II.

Wharton was preparing to vacation for the summer, when World War I broke out. Though many fled Paris, she moved back to her Paris apartment on the Rue de Varenne and for four years, she was a tireless and ardent supporter of the French war effort. One of the first causes she undertook, in August 1914, was the opening of a workroom for unemployed women. Here, they were fed and paid one franc a day. What began, with 30 women, soon doubled, to 60 women, and their sewing business began to thrive. When the Germans invaded Belgium in the fall of 1914 and Paris was flooded with Belgian refugees, she helped to set up the American Hostels for Refugees, which managed to get them shelter, meals, and clothes, and eventually created an employment agency to help them find work. She collected more than $100,000 on their behalf. In early 1915, she organized the Children of Flanders Rescue Committee, which gave shelter to nearly 900 Belgian refugees who had fled when their homes were bombed by the Germans.

Aided by her influential connections in the French government, she and her long-time friend, Walter Berry (then president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Paris), were among the few foreigners in France allowed to travel to the front lines, during World War I. She and Berry made five journeys, between February and August 1915, which Wharton described in a series of articles that were first published in &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and later as &quot;Fighting France: From Dunkerque to Belfort&quot;, which became an American bestseller. Travelling by car, Wharton and Berry drove through the war zone, viewing one devastated French village after another. She visited the trenches and was within earshot of artillery fire. She wrote, &quot;We woke to a noise of guns closer and more incessant, and when we went out into the streets, it seemed as if, overnight, a new army had sprung out of the ground&quot;.

Throughout the war, she worked in charitable efforts for refugees, the injured, the unemployed, and the displaced. She was a &quot;heroic worker on behalf of her adopted country&quot;. On April 18, 1916, Raymond Poincaré, the then-President of France, appointed her Chevalier of the Legion of Honour, the country&#x27;s highest award, in recognition of her dedication to the war effort. Her relief work included setting up workrooms for unemployed French women, organizing concerts to provide work for musicians, raising tens of thousands of dollars for the war effort, and opening tuberculosis hospitals. In 1915, Wharton edited a charity benefit volume, &quot;The Book of the Homeless,&quot; which included essays, art, poetry, and musical scores by many major contemporary European and American artists, including Henry James, Joseph Conrad, William Dean Howells, Anna de Noailles, Jean Cocteau, and Walter Gay, among others. Wharton proposed the book to her publisher, Scribner&#x27;s, handled the business arrangements, lined up contributors, and translated the French entries into English. Theodore Roosevelt wrote a two-page introduction, in which he praised Wharton&#x27;s effort and urged Americans to support the war. She also kept up her own work, continuing to write novels, short stories, and poems, as well as reporting for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and keeping up her enormous correspondence. Wharton urged Americans to support the war effort and encouraged America to enter the war. She wrote the popular romantic novel, &quot;Summer&quot; in 1917, the war novella, &quot;The Marne,&quot; in 1918, and &quot;A Son at the Front,&quot; in 1919 (published 1923). When the war ended, she watched the Victory Parade from the Champs Elysees&#x27; balcony of a friend&#x27;s apartment. After four years of intense effort, she decided to leave Paris for the quiet of the countryside. Wharton settled north of Paris in Saint-Brice-sous-Forêt, buying an 18th-century house on seven acres of land that she called Pavillon Colombe. She lived there, in summer and autumn, for the rest of her life, spending winters and springs on the French Riviera at Sainte Claire du Vieux Chateau in Hyères.

Wharton was a committed supporter of French imperialism, describing herself as a &quot;rabid imperialist&quot;, and the war solidified her political views. After the war, she traveled to Morocco, as the guest of Resident General Hubert Lyautey and wrote the book &quot;In Morocco&quot;, full of praise for the French administration, Lyautey, and particularly, his wife.

During the post-war years, she divided her time between Hyères and Provence, where she finished &quot;The Age of Innocence,&quot; in 1920. She returned to the United States only once, after the war, to receive an honorary doctorate from Yale University in 1923.

===Later years===
&quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; (1920) won the 1921 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, making Wharton the first woman to win the award. The three fiction judges – literary critic Stuart Pratt Sherman, literature professor Robert Morss Lovett, and novelist Hamlin Garland – voted to give the prize to Sinclair Lewis for his satire &quot;Main Street&quot;, but Columbia University&#x27;s advisory board, led by conservative university president Nicholas Murray Butler, overturned their decision and awarded the prize to &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot;. Wharton was also nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1927, 1928, and 1930.

Wharton was friend and confidante to many prominent intellectuals of her time: Henry James, Sinclair Lewis, Jean Cocteau, and André Gide were all her guests, at one time or another. Theodore Roosevelt, Bernard Berenson, and Kenneth Clark were valued friends, as well. Particularly notable was her meeting with F. Scott Fitzgerald, described by the editors of her letters as &quot;one of the better known failed encounters in the American literary annals.&quot; She spoke fluent French, Italian, and German, and many of her books were published in both French and English.

In 1934, Wharton&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;A Backward Glance,&quot; was published. In the view of Judith E. Funston, writing on Edith Wharton in &quot;American National Biography&quot;, What is most notable about &quot;A Backward Glance,&quot; however, is what it does not tell: her criticism of Lucretia Jones [her mother], her difficulties with Teddy, and her affair with Morton Fullerton, which did not come to light until her papers, deposited in Yale&#x27;s Beinecke Rare Book Room and Manuscript Library, were opened in 1968.
===Death===
On June 1, 1937, Wharton was at her French country home (shared with architect and interior decorator Ogden Codman), where she was at work on a revised edition of &quot;The Decoration of Houses&quot;, when she suffered a heart attack and collapsed.
She died of a stroke on August 11, 1937, at &quot;Le Pavillon Colombe&quot;, her 18th-century house on Rue de Montmorency in Saint-Brice-sous-Forêt. She died at 5:30 p.m., but her death was not known in Paris. At her bedside was her friend, Mrs. Royall Tyler. Wharton was buried in the American Protestant section of the Cimetière des Gonards in Versailles, &quot;with all the honors owed a war hero and a chevalier of the Legion of Honor ... a group of some one hundred friends sang a verse of the hymn &#x27;O Paradise&#x27;...&quot;

==Writing==

===Career===
Despite not publishing her first novel until she was forty, Wharton became an extraordinarily productive writer. In addition to
her 15 novels, seven novellas, and eighty-five short stories, she published poetry, books on design, travel, literary and cultural criticism, and a memoir.

In 1873, Wharton wrote a short story and gave it to her mother to read. Stinging from her mother&#x27;s critique, Wharton decided to write only poetry. While she constantly sought her mother&#x27;s approval and love, she rarely received either, and their relationship was a troubled one. Before she was 15, Wharton wrote &quot;Fast and Loose&quot; (1877). In her youth, she wrote about society. Her central themes came from her experiences with her parents. She was very critical of her work and wrote public reviews criticizing it. She also wrote about her own experiences with life. &quot;Intense Love&#x27;s Utterance&quot; is a poem written about Henry Stevens.

In 1889, she sent out three poems for publication, to &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Century&quot;. Edward L. Burlingame published &quot;The Last Giustiniani&quot; for &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot;. It was not until Wharton was 29 that her first short story was published: &quot;Mrs. Manstey&#x27;s View&quot; had very little success, and it took her more than a year to publish another story. She completed &quot;The Fullness of Life&quot;, following her annual European trip with Teddy. Burlingame was critical of this story, but Wharton did not want to make edits to it. This story, along with many others, speaks about her marriage. She sent &quot;Bunner Sisters&quot; to Scribner&#x27;s, in 1892. Burlingame wrote back that it was too long for Scribner&#x27;s to publish. This story is believed to be based on an experience she had as a child. It did not see publication until 1916, and it is included in the collection called &quot;Xingu&quot;.
After a visit with her friend, Paul Bourget, she wrote &quot;The Good May Come&quot; and &quot;The Lamp of Psyche&quot;. &quot;The Lamp of Psyche&quot; was a comical story, with verbal wit and sorrow. After &quot;Something Exquisite&quot; was rejected by Burlingame, she lost confidence in herself. She started travel writing, in 1894.

In 1901, Wharton wrote a two-act play called &quot;Man of Genius&quot;. This play was about an English man who was having an affair with his secretary. The play was rehearsed but was never produced. Another 1901 play, &quot;The Shadow of a Doubt&quot;, which also came close to being staged but fell through, was thought to be lost, until it was discovered, in 2017. It had a radio adaptation broadcast on BBC Radio 3, in 2018. It wouldn&#x27;t be until 2023, over a century later, that the world stage premiere took place in Canada at the Shaw Festival, directed by Peter Hinton-Davis.

She collaborated with Marie Tempest to write another play, but the two only completed four acts, before Marie decided she was no longer interested in costume plays. One of her earliest literary endeavors (1902) was the translation of the play &quot;Es Lebe das Leben&quot; (&quot;The Joy of Living&quot;), by Hermann Sudermann. &quot;The Joy of Living&quot; was criticized for its title, because the heroine swallows poison, at the end, and was a short-lived Broadway production. It was, however, a successful book.

Many of Wharton&#x27;s novels are characterized by subtle use of dramatic irony. Having grown up in upper-class, late-19th-century society, Wharton became one of its most astute critics, in such works as &quot;The House of Mirth&quot; and &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot;.

===Themes===
Versions of her mother, Lucretia Jones, often appeared in Wharton&#x27;s fiction. Biographer Hermione Lee described it as &quot;one of the most lethal acts of revenge ever taken by a writing daughter.&quot; In her memoir, &quot;A Backward Glance&quot;, Wharton describes her mother as indolent, spendthrift, censorious, disapproving, superficial, icy, dry and ironic.

Wharton&#x27;s writings often dealt with themes such as &quot;social and individual fulfillment, repressed sexuality, and the manners of old families and the new elite.&quot; Maureen Howard, editor of &quot;Edith Wharton: Collected Stories&quot;, notes several recurring themes in Wharton&#x27;s short stories, including confinement and attempts at freedom, the morality of the author, critiques of intellectual pretension, and the &quot;unmasking&quot; of the truth. Wharton&#x27;s writing also explored themes of &quot;social mores and social reform&quot; as they relate to the &quot;extremes and anxieties of the Gilded Age&quot;.

A key recurring theme in Wharton&#x27;s writing is the relationship between the house as a physical space and its relationship to its inhabitant&#x27;s characteristics and emotions. Maureen Howard argues &quot;Edith Wharton conceived of houses, dwelling places, in extended imagery of shelter and dispossession. Houses – their confinement and their theatrical possibilities ... they are never mere settings.&quot;

===Influences===
American children&#x27;s stories containing slang were forbidden in Wharton&#x27;s childhood home. This included such popular authors as Mark Twain, Bret Harte, and Joel Chandler Harris. She was allowed to read Louisa May Alcott but Wharton preferred Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; and Charles Kingsley&#x27;s &quot;The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby&quot;. Wharton&#x27;s mother forbade her from reading many novels and Wharton said she &quot;read everything else but novels until the day of my marriage.&quot; Instead Wharton read the classics, philosophy, history, and poetry in her father&#x27;s library including Daniel Defoe, John Milton, Thomas Carlyle, Alphonse de Lamartine, Victor Hugo, Jean Racine, Thomas Moore, Lord Byron, William Wordsworth, John Ruskin, and Washington Irving. Biographer Hermione Lee describes Wharton as having read herself &quot;out of Old New York&quot; and her influences included Herbert Spencer, Charles Darwin, Friedrich Nietzsche, T. H. Huxley, George Romanes, James Frazer, and Thorstein Veblen. These influenced her ethnographic style of novelization. Wharton developed a passion for Walt Whitman.

<text>Paul François Jean Nicolas, [[Viscount|Vicomte]] de Barras (; 30 June 1755 – 29 January 1829), commonly known as Paul Barras, was a French politician of the French Revolution, and the main executive leader of the Directory regime of 1795–1799.

==Early life==
Descended from a noble family of Provence, he was born at Fox-Amphoux, in today&#x27;s Var &quot;département&quot;. At the age of sixteen, he entered the regiment of Languedoc as a &quot;gentleman cadet&quot;. In 1776, he embarked for French India.

Shipwrecked on his voyage, he still managed to reach Pondicherry in time to contribute to the defence of that city during the Second Anglo-Mysore War. Besieged by British forces, the city surrendered on 18 October 1778; after the French garrison was released, Barras returned to France. He took part in a second expedition to the region in 1782/83, serving in the fleet of the renowned Admiral Pierre André de Suffren. Afterwards, he spent several years back home in France at leisure in relative obscurity.

==National Convention==
At the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789, he advocated the democratic cause, and became one of the administrators of the Var. In June 1792 he took his seat in the high national court at Orléans. Later in that year, on the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, Barras became commissioner to the French Army, which was facing the forces of Sardinia in the Italian Peninsula, and entered the National Convention as a deputy for the Var.

In January 1793, he voted with the majority for the execution of Louis XVI. However, he was mostly absent from Paris on missions to the regions of the south-east of France. During this period, he made the acquaintance of Napoleon Bonaparte at the Siege of Toulon (his later clash with Napoleon made him downplay the latter&#x27;s abilities as a soldier: he noted in his &quot;Memoirs&quot; that the siege had been carried out by 30,000 men against a minor royalist defending force, whereas the real number was 12,000; he also sought to minimize the share taken by Bonaparte in the capture of the city). When Barras became Director, he gave Napoleon position of general in the battalion of Italians.

==Thermidor and the Directory==

In 1794, Barras sided with the men who sought to overthrow Maximilien Robespierre&#x27;s faction. The Thermidorian Reaction of 27 July 1794 made him rise to prominence. In the next year, when the Convention felt threatened by the malcontent National Guards of Paris, it appointed Barras to command the troops engaged in its defence. His nomination of Bonaparte led to the adoption of violent measures, ensuring the dispersion of royalists and other malcontents in the streets near the Tuileries Palace, remembered as the &quot;13 Vendémiaire&quot; (5 October 1795). Subsequently, Barras became one of the five Directors who controlled the executive of the French Republic.

Owing to his intimate relations with Joséphine de Beauharnais, Barras helped to facilitate a marriage between her and Bonaparte. Some of his contemporaries alleged that this was the reason behind Barras&#x27;s nomination of Bonaparte to the command of the army of Italy early in the year 1796. Bonaparte&#x27;s success gave the Directory unprecedented stability, and when, in the summer of 1797, the royalist and surviving Girondist opposition again met the government with resistance, Bonaparte sent General Augereau, a Jacobin, to repress their movement in the Coup of 18 Fructidor (4 September 1797).

==Downfall and later life==

Barras was alleged to have dozens of mistresses and male lovers. The corruption of his administration was claimed to be extraordinary even for France. Barras&#x27;s alleged immorality in public and private life is often cited as a major contribution to the fall of the Directory, and the creation of the Consulate. In any case, Bonaparte met little resistance during his 18 Brumaire coup of November 1799. Barras supported the change of government, but was left aside by the First Consul when the latter reshaped the government of France.

Since he had amassed a large fortune, Barras spent his later years in luxury. Napoleon had him confined to the Château de Grosbois (Barras&#x27;s property), then exiled to Brussels and Rome, and ultimately, in 1810, interned in Montpellier; set free after the fall of the Empire, he died in Chaillot (now Paris), and was interred in Père Lachaise Cemetery. Although a partisan of the Second Restoration, Barras was kept in check during the reigns of Louis XVIII and Charles X (and his &quot;Memoirs&quot; were censored after his death).
==Films and television==
Richard McCabe played Barras in the &quot;Napoleon&quot; episode of the BBC series &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; (2007).

Barras was portrayed by Tahar Rahim in the 2023 film &quot;Napoleon&quot;.

<text>Lieutenant-Colonel Isaac Barré (15 October 1726 – 20 July 1802) was a British Army officer and politician. Barré served with distinction serving in the Seven Years&#x27; War and later became a member of parliament, where he was a vocal supporter of William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. He is known for coining the term &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot; in reference to the Patriots of the Thirteen Colonies.

==Early life==
Barré was born in Dublin on 15 October 1726, the son of Marie Madelaine (Raboteau) Barré and Peter Barré, Huguenot refugees who escaped to Ireland. Peter Barré became a linen dealer and served as High Sheriff of Dublin City. Isaac Barré was educated at Trinity College, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1745. His parents hoped he would study law, and David Garrick thought he had potential as an actor and offered to hire and train him, but Barré decided on a military career and entered the British Army in 1746.

==Military career==

Barré joined the 32nd Regiment of Foot as an ensign in 1746. The regiment was based in Flanders during the War of the Austrian Succession, and Barré gained his initial army experience prior to the end of the conflict in 1748. He continued to serve, and was promoted to lieutenant in 1755, and captain in 1756. During the French and Indian War, he served under his patron General James Wolfe on the Rochefort expedition of 1757, when he first met Lord Shelburne, and afterwards in Canada where he was appointed adjutant-general, fighting at both Louisbourg (1758) and Quebec (1759). In 1759, he was promoted to major, but the rank applied only during his service in America. In the Quebec expedition, in which Wolfe was killed, Barré was severely wounded by a bullet in the cheek and lost the use of his right eye. He was among the group gathered around the dying Wolfe, which was immortalised in Benjamin West&#x27;s celebrated picture.

Returning to England in September 1760, despite many years of commendable service, Barré was denied promotion by William Pitt the Elder and turned to Shelburne for help. After undertaking a tour of Shelburne&#x27;s Irish estates, he was advanced to lieutenant colonel of the 106th Foot, and in 1763 he was appointed to the lucrative posts of adjutant general of the British Army and Governor of Stirling Castle.

==Political career==

Shelburne introduced Barré to Lord Bute and brought him into parliament for his borough of Chipping Wycombe (1761–1774), having selected him as a &quot;bravo&quot; to take on Pitt. In 1774, Barré&#x27;s constituency switched to Calne, and he served until 1790. One of the few self-made soldiers in parliament, Barré became one of Shelburne&#x27;s principal supporters in the House of Commons. In his first political speech, he vehemently attacked the absent war minister William Pitt, renewing this assault the next day to Pitt&#x27;s face. This caused a sensation, and set the tone of a long and colourful parliamentary career in which he acquired a fearsome reputation as an orator. However, he ultimately became a devoted Pitt adherent.

From 1766 to 1768, Barré was a Vice-Treasurer of Ireland. His 1782 appointment as Treasurer of the Navy, which carried a pension of £3,200 a year at a time when the government was ostensibly advocating stringency, caused great discontent. William Pitt the Younger replied that the pension was compensation for Barré&#x27;s dismissal from his military offices in 1763; he then appointed Barré to the even more lucrative position of Paymaster General of the forces, with responsibility for England&#x27;s entire army payroll, which he held from August 1782 to April 1783. In 1784, Barré relinquished his pension in exchange for appointment to the sinecure of Clerk of the Pells. Nominally responsible for maintaining records of all Exchequer income and payments, the Clerk of the Pells was paid on a percentage system, which enabled Barré to accumulate a sizable fortune.

Barré&#x27;s knowledge of North America (he was one of the few politicians with friendships among the American mercantile classes) made him a champion of the colonists. He opposed taxation of America. Barré called the colonists &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot; in response to Charles Townshend&#x27;s observation when introducing the Stamp Act resolutions that the colonies should &quot;contribute to the mother country which had planted, nurtured and indulged them&quot;:

They planted by your care? No! Your oppression planted &#x27;em in America. They fled from your tyranny to a then uncultivated and unhospitable country where they exposed themselves to almost all the hardships to which human nature is liable, and among others to the cruelties of a savage foe, the most subtle, and I take upon me to say, the most formidable of any people upon the face of God’s earth...

They nourished by your indulgence? They grew by your neglect of &#x27;em. As soon as you began to care about &#x27;em, that care was exercised in sending persons to rule over &#x27;em, in one department and another, who were perhaps the deputies of deputies to some member of this house, sent to spy out their liberty, to misrepresent their actions and to prey upon &#x27;em; men whose behaviour on many occasions has caused the blood of those sons of liberty to recoil within them...

They protected by your arms? They have nobly taken up arms in your defence, have exerted a valour amidst their constant and laborious industry for the defence of a country whose frontier while drenched in blood, its interior parts have yielded all its little savings to your emolument ... The people I believe are as truly loyal as any subjects the king has, but a people jealous of their liberties and who will vindicate them if ever they should be violated; but the subject is too delicate and I will say no more.&quot;

In the Stamp Act crisis, Barré not only championed repeal but also followed Pitt in opposing the complete right of taxation as stated in the Declaratory Act.

Horace Walpole described Barré as &quot;a black [meaning his hair was black], robust man, of a military figure, rather hard-favoured than not, young, with a peculiar distortion on one side of his face, which it seems was a bullet lodged loosely in his cheek, and which gave a savage glare to one eye&quot;.

Barré became blind in 1783 and missed several sessions of Parliament. He later resumed his seat, but was not as effective as he had been previously. He retired in 1790.

==Death and burial==
Barré died at his home on Stanhope Street in the Mayfair district of London on 20 July 1802. He was buried at St. Mary Churchyard in East Raynham.

Barré&#x27;s residuary legatee was Anne Townshend, Marchioness Townshend, whom he had known before her marriage to George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend. She received approximately £24,000 (equivalent to about £2.3 million in 2018, or $3.2 million).

==Legacy==
The city of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, is named for him, as is the town of Barre, Massachusetts. There are also a town and a city named for Barré in Vermont (Barre City and Barre Town), as well as the towns of Barre, New York, and Barre, Wisconsin. There is a memorial to Barré in New York City, and numerous eastern US cities have named streets for him.
