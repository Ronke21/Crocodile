<text>[[Physiological]] plant disorders are caused by non-pathological conditions such as poor light, adverse weather, water-logging, phytotoxic compounds or a lack of nutrients, and affect the functioning of the plant system. Physiological disorders are distinguished from plant diseases caused by pathogens, such as a virus or fungus. While the symptoms of physiological disorders may appear disease-like, they can usually be prevented by altering environmental conditions. However, once a plant shows symptoms of a physiological disorder, it is likely that that season&#x27;s growth or yield will be reduced.

==Diagnosis of disorders==
Diagnosis of the cause of a physiological disorder (or disease) can be difficult, but there are many web-based guides that may assist with this. Examples are: &quot;Abiotic plant disorders: Symptoms, signs and solutions&quot;; &quot;Georgia Corn Diagnostic Guide&quot;; &quot;Diagnosing Plant Problems&quot; (Kentucky); and &quot;Diagnosing Plant Problems&quot; (Virginia).
Some general tips to diagnosing plant disorders:
*Examine where symptoms first appear on a plant—on new leaves, old leaves or all over?
*Note the pattern of any discolouration or yellowing—is it all over, between the veins or around the edges? If only the veins are yellow, deficiency is probably not involved.
*Note general patterns rather than looking at individual plants—are the symptoms distributed throughout a group of plants of the same type growing together? In the case of a deficiency all of the plants should be similarly effected, although distribution will depend on past treatments applied to the soil.
*Soil analysis, such as determining pH, can help to confirm the presence of physiological disorders. 
*Considering recent conditions, such as heavy rains, dry spells, frosts, etc., may also help to determine the cause of plant disorders.

==Weather damage==

Frost and cold are major causes of crop damage to tender plants, although hardy plants can also suffer if new growth is exposed to a hard frost following a period of warm weather. Symptoms will often appear overnight, affecting many types of plants. Leaves and stems may turn black, and buds and flowers may be discoloured, and frosted blooms may not produce fruit. Many annual plants, or plants grown in frost free areas, can suffer from damage when the air temperature drops below 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius). Tropical plants may begin to experience cold damage when the temperature is , symptoms include wilting of the top of the stems and/or leaves, and blackening or softening of the plant tissue.

Frost or cold damage can be avoided by ensuring that tender plants are properly hardened before planting, and that they are not planted too early in the season, before the risk of frost has passed. Avoid planting susceptible plants in frost pockets, or where they will receive early morning sun. Protect young buds and bloom with horticultural fleece if frost is forecast. Cold, drying easterly winds can also severely inhibit spring growth even without an actual frost, thus adequate shelter or the use of windbreaks is important.

Drought can cause plants to suffer from water stress and wilt. Adequate irrigation is required during prolonged hot, dry periods. Rather than shallow daily watering, during a drought water should be directed towards the roots, ensuring that the soil is thoroughly soaked two or three times a week. Mulches also help preserve soil moisture and keep roots cool.

Heavy rains, particularly after prolonged dry periods, can also cause roots to split, onion saddleback (splitting at the base), tomatoes split and potatoes to become deformed or hollow. Using mulches or adding organic matter such as leaf mold, compost or well rotted manure to the soil will help to act as a &#x27;buffer&#x27; between sudden changes in
conditions. Water-logging can occur on poorly drained soils, particularly following heavy rains. Plants can become yellow and stunted, and will tend to be more prone to drought and diseases. Improving drainage will help to alleviate this problem.

Hail can cause damage to soft skinned fruits, and may also allow brown rot or other fungi to penetrate the plant. Brown spot markings or lines on one side of a mature apple are indicative of a spring hailstorm.

Plants affected by salt stress are able to take water from soil, due to an osmotic imbalance between soil and plant.

==Nutrient deficiencies==

Poor growth and a variety of disorders such as leaf discolouration (chlorosis) can be caused by a shortage of one or more plant nutrients. Poor plant uptake of a nutrient from the soil (or other growing medium) may be due to an absolute shortage of that element in the growing medium, or because that element is present in a form that is not available to the plant. The latter can be caused by incorrect pH, shortage of water, poor root growth or an excess of another nutrient. Plant nutrient deficiencies can be avoided or corrected using a variety of approaches including the consultation of experts on-site, the use of soil and plant-tissue testing services, the application of prescription-blend fertilizers, the application of fresh or well-decomposed organic matter, and the use of biological systems such as cover crops, intercropping, improved fallows, ley cropping, permaculture, or crop rotation.

Nutrient (or mineral) deficiencies include:
*Boron deficiency
*Calcium deficiency
*Iron deficiency
*Magnesium deficiency
*Manganese deficiency
*Molybdenum deficiency
*Nitrogen deficiency
*Phosphorus deficiency
*Potassium deficiency
*Zinc deficiency

<text>The Battle of Malakoff (, ) or the Storming of the Malakhov Kurgan () was a series of French attacks against Russian forces on the Malakoff redoubt. The first attack was unsuccessful, and occurred on 18 June 1855; subsequent capture of the redoubt was on 8 September 1855. The assaults were parts of the Crimean War and the siege of Sevastopol. The French army under General MacMahon successfully stormed the Malakoff redoubt on 8th, while a simultaneous British attack on the Redan to the south of the Malakoff was repulsed. In one of the war&#x27;s defining moments, the French &quot;zouave&quot; Eugène Libaut raised the French flag on the top of the Russian redoubt. The battle of Malakoff resulted in the fall of Sevastopol on 9 September, bringing the 11-month siege to an end.

==Background==

Until 1784, most of the fortifications around Sevastopol were dedicated to the protection of the harbour entrance, the city itself and its naval base and were positioned close to these features. The construction of fortifications in the surrounding hills had been planned as early as 1837, but at the time of the battle only basic facilities and roadways had been completed on the north side of the long, westward-facing bay. To the south the central anchor of the defence system was the Malakoff-Kurgan ridge. Situated about southeast of the city, it consisted of a two-story stone tower of limestone on which the Russians had placed five heavy 18-pounder cannons at the beginning of the siege.

There is some mystery surrounding this tower. Although it is known that the tower was built some time before the start of the war, the historical records do not show exactly when this occurred, and no mention of this is made in the contemporary descriptions of the siege itself. Additionally, there are different spellings and translations into or from Russian, including Малахова башня. What is known is that the tower was originally built or expanded by Sevastopol merchants and then later taken over by the Russian Navy. The tower had a diameter of about and a height of . In its centre the battery known as &quot;Lunette Kamchatka&quot; was placed. This was a smaller fortification that was designed to protect several artillery pieces.

At this time the Russian cartographers marked all landmarks in and around this ridge as &quot;Fort Malakoff&quot;. This included several large grave mounds and the same ridge lying in front known as Mamelon (&quot;vert Mamelon&quot;). The name &quot;Fortmortal Malakoff&quot; (or French &quot;Fort Malakoff&quot;, Russian &quot;Malakhov&quot;) was retained after the war in Western literature covering the Crimean War.

The harbour of Sevastopol, formed by the estuary of the Chernaya, was protected against attack by sea not only by the Russian war-vessels, afloat and sunken, but also by heavy granite forts on the south side and by the defensive works. For the town itself, and the suburb of Korabelnaya, the plans for the works had been laid down for years. The Malakoff Tower covered the suburb, flanked on either side by the Redan and the Little Redan. The town was covered by a line of works marked by a flagstaff and central bastions, and separated from the Redan by the inner harbour.

Lieutenant Colonel Eduard Totleben, the Russian chief engineer, had begun work on these sites early in the war. Through daily efforts to rebuild, re-arm and improve the fortifications, he was able to finally connect them with a continuous defence system enceinte. Yet early in October 1854, Sevastopol was not the towering fortress it later became, and Totleben himself maintained that had the allies assaulted it immediately, they would have succeeded in taking the city. There were, however, many reasons against them doing so at the time, and it was not until 17 October that the first attack took place.

==Battle==

Throughout 17 October, a tremendous artillery duel raged. The Russian artillery was initially successful, the French corps fell under siege and suffered heavy losses. The advancing fleet engaging the harbour batteries also suffered a loss of 500 men and several ships were heavily damaged. Still, British siege batteries managed to silence the Malakoff and its annexes, after having succeeded in hitting a munitions depot and, if failure had not occurred at the other points of attack, an assault might have succeeded. As it was, by daybreak, Totleben&#x27;s engineers had repaired and improved the damaged works.

For months the siege of Sevastopol continued. During July the Russians lost on an average of 250 men a day, and finally the Russians decided to break the stalemate and gradual attrition of their army. Gorchakov and the field army were to make another attack at the Chernaya, the first since the Inkerman. On 16 August, both Pavel Liprandi and Read&#x27;s corps furiously attacked the 37,000 French and Sardinian troops on the heights above Traktir Bridge. The assailants came on with the greatest determination, but they were ultimately unsuccessful. At the end of the day, the Russians drew off leaving 260 officers and 8,000 men dead or dying on the field; the French and British only lost 1,700. With this defeat the last chance of saving Sevastopol vanished.

The same day, a determined bombardment once more reduced the Malakoff and its dependencies to impotence, and it was with absolute confidence in the result that Marshal Pélissier planned the final assault. At noon on 8 September 1855, the whole of Bosquet&#x27;s corps suddenly attacked all along the right sector. The fighting was of the most desperate kind: the French attack on the Malakoff was successful, but the other two French attacks were repelled. The British attack on the Redan was initially successful, but a Russian counterattack drove the British out of the bastion after two hours after the French attacks on the Flagstaff Bastion (left of the Great Redan) were repelled. With the failure of the French attacks in the left sector but with the fall of the Malakoff in French hands further attacks were cancelled. The Russian positions around the city were no longer tenable.

Throughout the day the bombardment mowed down the massed Russian soldiers along the whole line. The fall of the Malakoff was the end of the siege of the city. That night the Russians fled over the bridges to the north side, and on 9 September the victors took possession of the empty and burning city. The losses in the last assault had been very heavy: for the Allies over 8,000 men, for the Russians 13,000. At least nineteen generals had fallen on the final day and with the capture of Sevastopol the war was decided. No serious operations were undertaken against Gorchakov who, with the field army and the remnants of the garrison, held the heights at Mackenzie&#x27;s Farm. But Kinburn was attacked by sea and, from the naval point of view, became the first instance of the employment of Ironclad warships. An armistice was agreed upon on 26 February and the Treaty of Paris was signed on 30 March 1856.

==Aftermath==

At first sight Russia would seem to be almost invulnerable to a sea power, and no first success, however crushing, could have humbled Nicholas I. Indeed, the mere capture of Sevastopol would not have been strategically decisive. However, as the Tsar had decided to defend it at all costs and with unlimited resources, it became an unpleasant defeat, especially as the Allies had reached victory with limited resources.

During the nearly one-year siege of Sevastopol in the Crimean War, the fortifications on the Malakhov were hotly contested as they overlooked the whole city and the inner harbour. After the success of the French troops under the command of Marshal Pelissier, later the Duke of Malakoff (French: Duc de Malakoff), and General Patrice de Mac-Mahon, the Russian defenders evacuated the entire city on 8 September 1855, bringing a climax to the war.

As the fortress enabled the control of the Black Sea port of Sevastopol, the Russian forces destroyed all of their equipment and withdrew, leaving Russia with no more military fortifications on the Black Sea. The long-awaited Russian domination of the inland sea to obtain free passage through the Bosporus to the Mediterranean (and beyond) was now not possible.

In terms of logistics, the British and French had a significant advantage over the Russians as they were able to receive supplies from the sea, while the Russians had to bring supplies over the underdeveloped and dangerous desert tracks of southern Russia. The Russians lost many men and horses in bringing supplies to Sevastopol. The hasty nature, too, of the fortifications, which were damaged every day during the siege by the fire of a thousand guns, and had to be rebuilt every night, required large, unprotected working parties and the losses amongst these were correspondingly heavy. These losses exhausted Russia&#x27;s resources and when they were forced to employ large bodies of militia in the Battle of Traktir Bridge, it was obvious that the end was at hand.

The short stories of Leo Tolstoy, who was present at the siege, give a graphic picture of the war from the Russian point of view, portraying the miseries of the desert march, the still greater miseries of life in the casemates, and the almost daily ordeal of manning the lines, under shell-fire, against an assault which might or might not come.

Among the seven surviving defenders of a stone tower on the Malakov Kurgan, which were found by French troops among the dead, was the seriously wounded Vasily Kolchak, the father of Aleksandr Vasiliyevich Kolchak. Kolchak would later become the head of all the counter-revolutionary anti-communist White forces during the Russian Civil War.

As a result of press coverage of the siege of the tower, Malakhov Kurgan became a household name in Europe and many large and expensive towers in Western Europe were named after it. Among these were a number of stone mining towers in the Ruhrgebiet, the so-called caponier Fort Malakoff in Mainz, and the yellow sandstone Malakoff Tower in the city of Luxembourg. In addition, the Malakoff cake was named after the Duke of Malakoff, as was a cheese dish in parts of Switzerland. In France, the battle was officially commemorated in a rare way: apart from the Battle of Magenta (in the Italian Campaign), it was the only one of Emperor Napoleon III&#x27;s exploits to result in the awarding of a victory title (both of ducal rank); this distinction was bestowed upon Marshal Pélissier.

A suburb of Paris was also named after this battle, as well as the Avenue de Malakoff. Malakhov Kurgan, where it was fought, now contains the Eternal Fire, commemorating the siege of Sevastopol during World War II. A branch of Franz Roubaud&#x27;s great panorama representing the battle of 1855 is also located there.

<text>Blue Meanies were an American ska-core band founded in Carbondale, Illinois, at Southern Illinois University, in 1989.

==History==
===Independent years===
The Blue Meanies were formed in Carbondale, Illinois in 1989, where they emerged from the city&#x27;s college party circuit in the early 1990s. The band made their recording debut in 1991 with the release of their first single, &quot;Grandma Shampoo&quot; c/w &quot;Dickory Dock&quot;. Although their personnel was continuously changing, The Blue Meanies&#x27; sound would remain consistent throughout their first four albums, &quot;Peace Love Groove&quot; (1991), &quot;Pave The World&quot; (1992), &quot;Kiss Your Ass Goodbye&quot; (1995), &quot;Full Throttle&quot; (1997), and the live record &quot;Sonic Documentation Of Exhibition And Banter&quot; (1998).

The Blue Meanies took part in the 1998 Ska Against Racism tour.

===MCA Records era===
The band signed with MCA Records towards the end of the commercially successful third wave of ska, with a line-up consisting of John Paul Camp (III) (saxophone/ vocals), Sean Dolan (guitar), Jimmy Flame (trumpet/ vocals), Chaz Linde (keyboard/ vocal), Dave Lund (bass/ vocals), Billy Spunke (vocals/ megaphone), and Bob Trondson (drums). By this time, a total of twenty-two musicians had passed through the band since their formation, including Jay Vance, as a bass player, who went on to form the one-man metal band Captured! By Robots.

Their sixth full-length album, &quot;The Post Wave&quot;, released in late 2000 on MCA Records, was the most musically different from their other five albums. In 2001, the band regained the rights to &quot;The Post Wave&quot; and reissued it on Thick Records, their original record label.

The band ceased touring, though they never issued an official break-up statement.

===Post-breakup===
In the summer of 2004, it was confirmed that the Blue Meanies would temporarily revive the old tradition of the Winter Nationals. For years the Blue Meanies would have a show on December 23 in their hometown of Chicago. On December 22, 2004 the band played its first show in three years at Double Door with The Tossers and Cougars supporting. The next day the band played an all ages show at The Metro with Mu330, The Methadones, and New Black supporting. The Metro show was filmed with multiple cameras but no plans for a release of the footage have been announced.

The Blue Meanies reunited for Riot Fest 2006, an annual punk rock festival held in Chicago.

On May 13, 2014, the organizers of Riot Fest and Blue Meanies revealed that the band would reunite and perform at the Chicago version of the 2014 festival.

<doc id="157667" wikidata="Q299612" url="?curid=157667" title="Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse">
<text>Raymond of Saint-Gilles ( 1041 – 28 February 1105), also called Raymond IV of Toulouse or Raymond I of Tripoli, was the count of Toulouse, duke of Narbonne, and margrave of Provence from 1094, and one of the leaders of the First Crusade from 1096 to 1099. He spent the last five years of his life establishing the County of Tripoli in the Near East.

==Early years==

Raymond was a son of Pons of Toulouse and Almodis de La Marche. He received Saint-Gilles with the title of &quot;count&quot; from his father and displaced his niece Philippa, Duchess of Aquitaine, his brother William IV&#x27;s daughter, in 1094 from inheriting Toulouse.
In 1094, William Bertrand of Provence died and his margravial title to Provence passed to Raymond. A bull of Urban&#x27;s dated 22 July 1096 names Raymond &quot;comes nimirum Tholosanorum ac Ruthenensium et marchio Provintie Raimundus&quot; (&quot;Raymond, count of Toulouse and Rouergue, margrave of Provence&quot;).

==The First Crusade==

Raymond was deeply religious, and wished to die in the Holy Land, and so when the call was raised for the First Crusade, he was one of the first to take the cross. He is sometimes called &quot;the one-eyed&quot; (&quot;monoculus&quot; in Latin) after a rumour that he had lost an eye in a scuffle with the doorkeeper of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre during an earlier pilgrimage to Jerusalem. The oldest and the richest of the crusaders, Raymond left Toulouse at the end of October 1096, with a large company that included his wife Elvira of Castile, his infant son (who would die on the journey) and Adhemar, bishop of Le Puy, the papal legate. He ignored requests by his niece, Philippa (the rightful heiress to Toulouse) to grant the rule of Toulouse to her in his stead; instead, he left Bertrand, his eldest son, to govern. He marched to Dyrrhachium, and then east to Constantinople along the same route used by Bohemond of Taranto. At the end of April 1097, he was the only crusade leader not to swear an oath of fealty to Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos. Instead, Raymond swore an oath of friendship, and offered his support against Bohemond, mutual enemy of both Raymond and Alexios.

He was present at the siege of Nicaea and the Battle of Dorylaeum in 1097, but his first major role came in October 1097 at the siege of Antioch. The crusaders heard a rumour that Antioch had been deserted by the Seljuk Turks, so Raymond sent his army ahead to occupy it, offending Bohemond of Taranto who wanted the city for himself. The city was, however, still occupied, and was taken by the crusaders only after a difficult siege in June 1098. Raymond took the &quot;palatium Cassiani&quot; (the palace of emir Yaghi-Siyan) and the tower over the Bridge Gate. He was ill during the second siege of Antioch by Kerbogha which culminated in a controversial rediscovery of the Holy Lance by a monk named Peter Bartholomew.

The &quot;miracle&quot; raised the morale of the crusaders, and to their surprise they were able to rout Kerbogha outside Antioch. The Lance itself became a valuable relic among Raymond&#x27;s followers, despite Adhemar of Le Puy&#x27;s skepticism and Bohemond&#x27;s disbelief and occasional mockery. Raymond also refused to relinquish his control of the city to Bohemond, reminding Bohemond that he was obligated to return Antioch to the court of Emperor Alexios, as he had sworn to do. A struggle then arose between Raymond&#x27;s supporters and the supporters of Bohemond, partly over the genuineness of the Lance, but mostly over the possession of Antioch.

==Extending his territorial reach==
Many of the minor knights and foot soldiers preferred to continue their march to Jerusalem, and they convinced Raymond to lead them there in the autumn of 1098. Raymond led them out to besiege Maarat al-Numan, although he left a small detachment of his troops in Antioch, where Bohemond also remained. As Adhemar had died in Antioch, Raymond, along with the prestige given to him by the Holy Lance, became the new leader of the crusade. Bohemond however, expelled Raymond&#x27;s detachment from Antioch in January 1099. Raymond then began to search for a city of his own. He marched from Maarat, which had been captured in December 1098, into the emirate of Tripoli, and began the siege of Arqa on 14 February 1099, apparently with the intent of founding an independent territory in Tripoli that could limit the power of Bohemond to expand the Principality of Antioch to the south.

The siege of Arqa, a town outside Tripoli, lasted longer than Raymond had hoped. Although he successfully captured Hisn al-Akrad, a fortress that would later become the important Krak des Chevaliers, his insistence on taking Tripoli delayed the march to Jerusalem, and he lost much of the support he had gained after Antioch. Raymond finally agreed to continue the march to Jerusalem on 13 May, and after months of siege the city was captured on 15 July. Raymond was offered the crown of the new Kingdom of Jerusalem, but refused, as he was reluctant to rule in the city in which Jesus had suffered. He said that he shuddered to think of being called &quot;King of Jerusalem&quot;. It is also likely that he wished to continue the siege of Tripoli rather than remain in Jerusalem. However, he was also reluctant to give up the Tower of David in Jerusalem, which he had taken after the fall of the city, and it was only with difficulty that Godfrey of Bouillon was able to take it from him.

Raymond participated in the battle of Ascalon soon after the capture of Jerusalem, during which an invading army from Egypt was defeated. However, Raymond wanted to occupy Ascalon himself rather than give it to Godfrey, and in the resulting dispute Ascalon remained unoccupied. It was not taken by the crusaders until 1153. Godfrey also blamed him for the failure of his army to capture Arsuf. When Raymond went north, in the winter of 1099–1100, his first act was one of hostility against Bohemond, capturing Laodicea from him (Bohemond had himself recently taken it from Alexios). From Laodicea he went to Constantinople, where he allied with Alexios I, Bohemond&#x27;s most powerful enemy. Bohemond was at the time attempting to expand Antioch into Byzantine territory, and blatantly refused to fulfill his oath to the Byzantine Empire.

==Crusade of 1101, siege of Tripoli, and death==

Raymond was part of the doomed Crusade of 1101, where he was defeated at the Battle of Mersivan in Anatolia. He escaped and returned to Constantinople. In 1102, he travelled by sea from Constantinople to Antioch, where he was imprisoned by Tancred, regent of Antioch during the captivity of Bohemond, and was only dismissed after promising not to attempt any conquests in the country between Antioch and Acre. He immediately broke his promise, attacking and capturing Tartus, and began to build a castle on the Mons Peregrinus (&quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Mountain&quot;) which would help in his siege of Tripoli. He was aided by Alexius I, who preferred a friendly state in Tripoli to balance the hostile state in Antioch.

The &quot;qadi&quot; of Tripoli, Fakhr al-Mulk ibn Ammar, led an attack on Mons Peregrinus in September 1104 and set a wing of the citadel on fire. Raymond himself managed to escape across a rooftop, but was badly burned and spent his final months in agony. He died of his injuries on February 28, 1105, before Tripoli was captured.

==Spouses and progeny==
Raymond IV of Toulouse was married three times, and twice excommunicated for marrying within forbidden degrees of consanguinity
by Pope Gregory VII in 1076 and in 1078. These excommunications were lifted in 1080, on the death of his first wife.
His first wife was the daughter of Godfrey I, Count of Arles. Married in 1066, she was repudiated in 1076. Their son was Bertrand. 
His second wife was Matilda (Mafalda), the daughter of Count Roger I of Sicily. Married in 1080, Mafalda died in 1094.

Raymond&#x27;s third wife was Elvira, the illegitimate daughter of King Alfonso VI of León. They married in 1094. Together they had Alfonso Jordan.

Following Raymond&#x27;s death, his nephew William-Jordan in 1109, with the aid of King Baldwin I of Jerusalem, finally captured Tripoli and established the County of Tripoli. William was deposed in the same year by Raymond&#x27;s eldest son Bertrand, and the county remained in the possession of the counts of Toulouse throughout the 12th century.

Raymond of Toulouse seems to have been driven both by religious and material motives. On the one hand he accepted the discovery of the Holy Lance and rejected the kingship of Jerusalem, but on the other hand he could not resist the temptation of a new territory. Raymond of Aguilers, a clerk in Raymond&#x27;s army, wrote an account of the crusade from Raymond&#x27;s point of view.

<text>The Battle of Malplaquet took place on 11 September 1709 during the War of the Spanish Succession, near Taisnières-sur-Hon in modern France, then part of the Spanish Netherlands. A French army of around 75,000 men, commanded by the Duke of Villars, engaged a Grand Alliance force of 86,000 under the Duke of Marlborough. In one of the bloodiest battles of the 18th century, the Allies won a narrow victory, but suffered heavy casualties.

Allied advances in 1708 led to the renewal of peace talks, which collapsed in April 1709. After taking Tournai in early September, the Allies besieged Mons, whose capture would allow them to enter France itself, and Louis XIV ordered Villars to prevent its loss. Although the two armies made contact on 10 September, the attack was delayed until the next day, giving Villars time to construct strong defensive positions.

After an opening artillery barrage, the Allied infantry made simultaneous assaults on the French flanks. These were intended to divert troops from their centre, weakening it sufficiently so it could then be broken by a mass Allied cavalry charge. Although successful in previous battles, at Malplaquet the flank attacks incurred heavy casualties, while the French cavalry ensured their centre did not collapse. This allowed their infantry to retreat in good order, with the Allies too exhausted to conduct a pursuit.

Most historians estimate Allied losses as about 22,000 killed or wounded, those of the French being around 11,000. These levels shocked contemporaries, and heightened internal divisions within the Grand Alliance over the wisdom of continuing the war. By saving his army, Villars ultimately enabled Louis to negotiate far better peace terms in 1713 than those available in 1709. However, it did little to change the immediate strategic situation; Mons surrendered shortly afterward and the Allies resumed their advance in 1710.

==Background==
By early 1709, the French state was bankrupt, while the severe winter of 1708–1709 caused widespread famine; garrisons at Tournai, Arras, St Omer, Valenciennes and Cambrai all mutinied over lack of food and pay. Desperate to end the war, Louis XIV initiated peace talks with the Grand Alliance in The Hague. He accepted most of their terms, including replacing his grandson Philip V of Spain with the Habsburg candidate Archduke Charles, the principle for which they were ostensibly fighting. However, he and his ministers could not agree to the demand French troops be used to remove Philip, and talks broke down at the end of April.

When the 1709 campaign began, Louis ordered Villars to avoid battle and to prevent any further deterioration in the French position. Ordinarily an extremely aggressive general, Villars instead built defensive lines along the River Scarpe, running from Saint-Venant to Douai.

For their part, the Allies were convinced France was on the verge of collapse, and looked to keep up the pressure by advancing through the line of border fortresses known as the &quot;Frontière de fer&quot;. While French strategy was always ultimately determined by Louis XIV, that of the Allies had to be approved separately by the British, Dutch and Austrian governments, which often required compromise. Marlborough, the Allied commander, considered the positions held by Villars too strong for a frontal assault, and since the Dutch opposed his preferred option of Ypres, he agreed to make Tournai the main objective for 1709.

Although persistent heavy rain caused further delays, the siege of Tournai commenced on 15 June; one of the strongest fortresses in France and held by a garrison of 7,700, it surrendered on 3 September and Marlborough immediately marched on Mons. Having assumed Tournai would hold out until October and thus consume the entire 1709 campaign season, Louis now ordered Villars to prevent the loss of Mons &quot;at all costs...the salvation of France is at stake&quot;. The main Allied army arrived east of the town on 7 September, awaiting the arrival of their siege artillery from Tournai; Villars took up positions to the southwest on the 9th, leaving the two forces facing each other across the gap of Malplaquet.

==Prelude==
Knowing Villars had been instructed to fight for Mons, Marlborough and his deputy Prince Eugene of Savoy were confident of winning a victory that would effectively end the war. At the same time, while conscious of the implications of defeat, Villars informed Louis XIV he must fight, or his army would dissolve. The Allies delayed their attack pending the arrival of 1,900 men from Tournai under Henry Withers, a decision criticised then and later, one analyst arguing &quot;the battle should have taken place on 10 September, or not at all&quot;. This gave Villars an extra day to construct defensive positions, including earthworks covering the open ground in the centre, and additional entrenchments extending into the woods on either side.

Marlborough&#x27;s plan was the same as he had successfully employed at Blenheim, Ramillies and Oudenarde. On each occasion, frontal assaults on the French flanks forced them to move troops from the centre, which was then broken by mass cavalry attacks. Although the leading units took heavy casualties, overall Allied losses were substantially less than those suffered by the defeated. In contrast, at Malplaquet the French held strong defensive positions, were better led, and highly motivated.

Villars had also learned from Ramillies, where Villeroy arguably contributed to his own defeat by over-extending his line. He was helped by the fact that the battlefield at Malplaquet was much more restricted, allowing him to concentrate his infantry in defensive positions. It also prevented Marlborough from quickly shifting troops between wings, a tactic he often adopted to keep opponents off balance.

The French army consisted of 80 guns and between 75,000 and 80,000 men, including significant numbers of Bavarian and Swiss mercenaries, as well as the Irish Brigade. Villars himself commanded the left, de la Colonie led the centre, with the right, where Villars had placed the bulk of the infantry, led by 67-year-old Marshal Louis-François de Boufflers, who was senior to Villars in rank but volunteered to serve under him. The infantry held a continuous line of entrenchments supported by artillery, with the cavalry massed in the rear.

Facing them was an Allied force of roughly 86,000 men and 100 guns, with the right wing formed of 30,000 German and Danish infantry led by Prince Eugene. The Earl of Orkney commanded the Allied centre, with 8,000 mostly British infantry, and the bulk of the 30,000 cavalry to their rear. Finally, the Allied left was held by the Dutch, with 18,000 infantry under the Prince of Orange, plus 10,000 cavalry under the Prince of Hesse-Kassel. Overall control was exercised by Count Tilly, who had succeeded Lord Overkirk as senior Dutch commander.

==Battle==
At 07:00 on 11 September, the Allies opened the battle with an artillery bombardment. This ended at 08:30, when their right wing assaulted French troops based in Sars Wood, led by Count Finckenstein, Lottum and Schulenburg. Three hours of close combat ensued, both sides taking heavy losses; Prince Eugene was slightly wounded, but refused to leave the field. At around 09:00, the Dutch, commanded by François Nicolas Fagel, moved against the French right with 13 battalions, including Swiss mercenaries and the Scots Brigade. After initial success, they were repulsed, and the Prince of Orange and Sicco van Goslinga then ordered another 17 battalions to support Fagel by attacking French positions around Blairon Farm.

A frontal assault on strongly entrenched troops meant the Dutch incurred over 5,000 casualties capturing Blairon Farm, including many senior officers. Despite these losses, the Prince of Orange continued his attacks until Marlborough ordered him to stop. Covered by their cavalry, the Dutch withdrew to their original positions, while Orkney later wrote their dead lay &quot;as thick as ever you saw a flock of sheep.&quot; Boufflers, in command of the French right, had over 60 battalions at his disposal, but made no attempt to launch a counterattack, a decision later criticised. Suggestions the Dutch action was only intended as a demonstration appear unlikely. Marlborough blamed himself for not monitoring it more closely, and took full responsibility for the failure.

Meanwhile, pressure from Prince Eugene forced Villars to keep moving troops from the centre to prevent the collapse of his left wing. Withers and the detachment from Tournai arrived too late to support the Dutch, and were instructed instead to make a flanking move north of the French lines in Sars Wood. This manoeuvre took over two hours to complete, by which time the fighting had largely ended, but their approach forced Villars to reinforce his left with another twelve battalions. By midday, this left nine French battalions and sixty cavalry squadrons in the centre, facing twenty-three and eighty respectively. In the early afternoon, Villars was badly wounded, and transferred overall command to Boufflers, with Puységur taking over the left.

Despite their losses, the Dutch assaults prevented the French right reinforcing their centre. This was now over-run by Orkney&#x27;s infantry, while the Dutch cavalry under Grovestins broke into their rear, before being attacked by the elite cavalry under Boufflers. Superior numbers forced the Allied cavalry back, before the French in turn were repulsed by Orkney&#x27;s infantry. The Allies advanced once again, and engaged the French in what was the largest cavalry action of the 18th century. As this unfolded, the French left finally started to crumble under pressure from Withers and Schulenburg.

Puységur now ordered his troops to withdraw, while the Prince of Orange led another mass assault against the French right. The Dutch infantry made some progress but were repulsed once again, before Grovestins&#x27; cavalry approached the French rear, forcing them to finally abandon their entrenchments. At 15:00 Boufflers ordered a general retreat towards Le Quesnoy, some away, with the Allies too exhausted to pursue.

==Casualties==
Most commentators put Allied casualties between 21,000 and 25,000 killed or wounded, 8,462 of which were incurred by the Dutch infantry. Other estimates range from a low of 15,000 to a high of 30,000. There is less consensus on French losses, which are generally put at between 11,000 and 14,000, Other estimates suggest a low of 7,000, to a high of 17,000 killed or wounded, plus 500 prisoners. The Allies also captured 16 French artillery pieces.

==Aftermath==
Although horrified by the casualties, contemporaries viewed Malplaquet as an Allied victory, and most modern historians concur. The French commanders focused on the losses they had inflicted, Boufflers reporting to Louis XIV &quot;...misfortune compels me to announce the loss of another battle, but I can assure your Majesty misfortune has never been accompanied by greater glory&quot;. In a similar vein, Villars later wrote: &quot;If God grants us the grace to lose such a battle again, Your Majesty can count on all of his enemies being destroyed&quot;.

The Prince of Orange was left to oversee the siege of Mons, which surrendered on 21 October. Despite this loss, in the long term Malplaquet arguably allowed Louis to negotiate far better terms at Utrecht in 1713 than those available in 1709. When negotiations resumed in March 1710, the French strategic position was largely unchanged, but Maplaquet accentuated Allied divisions over war aims and their associated cost. Even before the 1709 campaign, Marlborough himself felt Whig demands of &quot;No Peace Without Spain&quot; were excessive. In that respect, Malplaquet had less impact on British policy than Spanish successes the same year at Alicante and La Gudina, which made prospects of victory there increasingly remote.

Before peace talks resumed in 1710, Marlborough wrote to the Allied negotiators that &quot;thanks to our victory..., you may have what peace you want&quot;. This view was used on the loss of Mons, which exposed the French interior, while the losses incurred at Malplaquet meant they could only act on the defensive. In spring 1710, the Allies resumed their advance almost unopposed; by September they had broken through the secondary line of the &quot;Pré carré&quot;, capturing Douai, Béthune, Aire and Saint-Venant. Short of supplies, and with many regiments reduced to less than half their official size, Villars could not risk the last significant French field army in another battle.

As a result, the immediate impact of Malplaquet was political rather than military. When peace negotiations resumed in March 1710 at Geertruidenberg, it was clear the mood in Britain had changed. Although British losses were comparatively low, Marlborough&#x27;s domestic opponents used the heavy casualties to attack him. Reluctance to continue fighting for what seemed marginal gains resulted in a landslide victory for the Tories in the October 1710 British general election, although they confirmed their commitment to the war to prevent a credit crisis. Despite success in France, British opposition to continuing the war was strengthened by further defeats at Brihuega and Villaviciosa in December 1710 which confirmed Philip V as king of Spain, ostensibly the original cause of the war.

The Dutch blamed their losses on Marlborough&#x27;s tactics, Withers for allegedly failing to support their attack, and the Prince of Orange for continuing when it became clear the French positions were too strong. Although Grand Pensionary Anthonie Heinsius and several Dutch &quot;regenten&quot; felt the casualties justified more stringent peace terms, others considered this unrealistic. Sicco van Goslinga, a Dutch field deputy attached to Marlborough&#x27;s staff, argued such casualties were to be expected, given they had taken Tournai and Mons, &quot;two of the strongest fortresses in Europe&quot;, and won &quot;one of the hardest battles ever fought&quot;.

In April 1711, the Habsburg candidate for the Spanish throne, Archduke Charles, succeeded his brother Joseph as Holy Roman Emperor. Since the British and Dutch viewed a union of Spain with Austria as unwelcome as one with France, this effectively undermined a key reason for continuing the war. While the capture of Bouchain in September 1711 removed one of the last significant obstacles to the Allied advance, the new British government had already secretly negotiated peace terms with Louis XIV, signing the Preliminary Articles of London on 8 October 1711. At the end of 1711, Marlborough was replaced by the Tory Duke of Ormonde, who was ordered to prevent any further offensive action by British troops.

==Legacy==

While the battle is now chiefly remembered by British and Dutch commentators for the casualties incurred, the French view it differently. At the beginning of the war, their army was considered the best in Europe, a reputation shattered by a series of defeats between 1704 and 1708. Despite being a narrow defeat which did little to change the immediate strategic situation, Malplaquet is seen as more important than victory at Denain in 1712. Historian André Corvisier suggests its significance in French military history is primarily psychological. He argues 18th century authors viewed it as the point when the French army regained its confidence, while for those writing after the 1870 Franco-Prussian War, it provided proof of French resilience and ability to recover from catastrophic defeat.

A total of fourteen battalions of Swiss mercenaries fought in the battle, six with the French, including two of Swiss Guards, and another eight with the Dutch. More than 8,000 of these became casualties, while Malplaquet was the last action where Swiss mercenaries directly engaged one another until Bailén in 1808.

Written many years later, a firsthand account of the battle is given in the book &quot;Amiable Renegade: The Memoirs of Peter Drake (1671–1753)&quot;. An Irishman who served in various European armies, Drake fought with the &quot;Maison du Roi&quot; at Malplaquet and was captured after being wounded several times. Another émigré of Irish descent, Féilim Ó Néill, was among those killed serving with the Irish Brigade.

<text>Osterode () was a district in Lower Saxony, Germany. It was bounded by (from the southwest and clockwise) the districts of Göttingen, Northeim and Goslar, and by the state of Thuringia (districts of Nordhausen and Eichsfeld).

==History==

This part of the Harz mountains was ruled by the Welfen dynasty from the 12th century on. Osterode was the centre of the Principality of Brunswick-Grubenhagen, one of many small states within Brunswick-Lüneburg. Later this principality became part of Hanover, which in turn fell to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1866. In 1885 the Prussian administration established districts, among them Osterode.

On 1 November 2016, Osterode ceased to become a separate district and was merged with an enlarged Göttingen.

==Geography==

More than two thirds of the district&#x27;s area were occupied by the southwestern part of the Harz mountains, including the southern portion of the Harz National Park.

<doc id="157671" wikidata="Q273011" url="?curid=157671" title="Battle of Marengo">
<text>The Battle of Marengo was fought on 14 June 1800 between French forces under the First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte and Austrian forces near the city of Alessandria, in Piedmont, Italy. Near the end of the day, the French overcame General Michael von Melas&#x27; surprise attack, drove the Austrians out of Italy and consolidated Bonaparte&#x27;s political position in Paris as First Consul of France in the wake of his coup d&#x27;état the previous November.

Surprised by the Austrian advance toward Genoa in mid-April 1800, Bonaparte hastily led his army over the Alps in mid-May and reached Milan on 2 June. After cutting Melas&#x27;s line of communications by crossing the river Po and defeating &quot;Feldmarschallleutnant&quot; (FML) Peter Karl Ott von Bátorkéz at Montebello on 9 June, the French closed in on the Austrian Army, which had massed in Alessandria. Deceived by a local double agent, Bonaparte dispatched large forces to the north and the south, but the Austrians launched a surprise attack on 14 June against the main French army, under General Louis Alexandre Berthier.

Initially, their two assaults across the Fontanone stream near Marengo village were repelled, and General Jean Lannes reinforced the French right. Bonaparte realized the true position and issued orders at 11:00 am to recall the detachment under &quot;Général de Division&quot; (GdD) Louis Desaix while he moved his reserve forward. On the Austrian left, Ott&#x27;s column had taken Castel Ceriolo, and its advance guard moved south to attack Lannes&#x27; flank. Melas renewed the main assault, and the Austrians broke the central French position. By 2:30 pm, the French were withdrawing, and Austrian dragoons seized the Marengo farm. Bonaparte had by then arrived with the reserve, but Berthier&#x27;s troops began to fall back on the main vine belts. Knowing that Desaix was approaching, Bonaparte was anxious about a column of Ott&#x27;s soldiers marching from the north and so he deployed his Consular Guard infantry to delay it. The French then withdrew steadily eastward toward San Giuliano Vecchio as the Austrians formed a column to follow them, as Ott also advanced in the northern sector.

Desaix&#x27;s arrival at around 5:30 pm stabilized the French position, as the 9th Light Infantry Regiment delayed the Austrian advance down the main road and the rest of the army reformed north of Cascina Grossa. As the pursuing Austrian troops arrived, a mix of musketry and artillery fire concealed the surprise attack of &quot;Général de Brigade&quot; (GdB) François Étienne de Kellermann’s cavalry, which threw the Austrian pursuit into disordered flight back into Alessandria, with about 14,000 killed, wounded or captured. The French casualties were considerably fewer but included Desaix. The whole French line chased after the Austrians to seal &quot;une victoire politique&quot; (a political victory) that secured Bonaparte&#x27;s grip on power after the coup. It would be followed by a propaganda campaign that sought to rewrite the story of the battle three times during his rule.

==Background==
The Battle of Marengo was the victory that sealed the success of Bonaparte&#x27;s Italian campaign of 1800 and is best understood in the context of that campaign. By a daring crossing of the Alps with his Army of the Reserve (officially commanded by Louis Alexandre Berthier) in mid-May 1800 almost before the passes were open, Bonaparte (who crossed on a mule) had threatened Melas&#x27; lines of communications in northern Italy. The French army then seized Milan on 2 June, followed by Pavia, Piacenza and Stradella, Lombardy, cutting the main Austrian supply route eastward along the south bank of the Po. Bonaparte hoped that Melas&#x27; preoccupation with the Siege of Genoa, held by Gen. André Masséna, would prevent the Austrians from responding to his offensive. However, Genoa surrendered on 4 June, freeing a large number of Austrians for operations against the French.

On 9 June Gen. Jean Lannes beat Feldmarschallleutnant Peter Ott in the Battle of Montebello. This caused Bonaparte to become overconfident. He became convinced that Melas would not attack and, further, that the Austrians were about to retreat. As other French forces closed from the west and south, the Austrian commander had withdrawn most of his troops from their positions near Nice and Genoa to Alessandria on the main Turin-Mantua road.

===Austrian plans and preliminary French moves===
The Austrians planned to fight their way out eastward but—using a local double agent, usually known by his cover of François Toli—attempted to deceive Bonaparte into thinking they would try to march north, cross the Po and head for Milan, joined by the remaining troops marching up from Genoa. The spy would advise Bonaparte to march via Sale on the northern side of the plain, so that he could be engaged by the Austrian left wing; meanwhile the main force would move through Marengo village in the centre, turn north and fall into the French left flank. Ott arrived from Montebello of 13 June in a war council. The senior generals of the Austrian army strongly approved this plan, as the alternative would have meant that the army would have had to retreat along the river Po and leave Piedmont to the enemy without a fight. Nonetheless, by abandoning the San Giuliano plain, where the superior Austrian cavalry could have given him an edge, Melas probably made a serious mistake.

Bonaparte knew that Ott had no way out from Alessandria, but he had no idea of Melas&#x27; position. Following his meeting with the spy and fearing that the Austrian general might try to escape, Bonaparte spread his army out in a wide net by sending Louis Desaix with Divisional General Jean Boudet&#x27;s division (6,000 men) south to Novi Ligure and Divisional General Jean François Cornu de La Poype (3,500 men) north on the other bank of the Po. Further north, from Vercelli to Lake Maggiore, were stationed the divisions of Antoine de Béthencourt and Joseph Chabran and, further to the rear, north of Piacenza, Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge&#x27;s division. Bonaparte&#x27;s view was confirmed when Gen. Claude Victor-Perrin, supported by Divisional General Joachim Murat’s cavalry, swiftly evicted FML Andreas O&#x27;Reilly von Ballinlough’s Austrian brigade from Marengo village that afternoon. Victor then deployed divisional generals Gaspard Amédée Gardanne and Jacques-Antoine de Chambarlhac de Laubespin&#x27;s divisions along the Fontanone stream. Austrian headquarters debated building a bridge to the north to outflank the French, but the lack of pontoons and time forced the Austrians to cross the river Bormida and then launch a single, direct assault across the Fontanone bridge.

==Prelude==
===Battlefield===

The battle took place to the east of Alessandria, on a plain crossed by a river forming meanders, the Bormida, over which the Austrians installed a bridgehead. On the plain were spread numerous hamlets and farms that represented strategic points. The three main sites of the battle formed a triangle, with Marengo in the west, Castel Ceriolo in the north and San Giuliano Vecchio in the east. A small stream, the Fontanone, passed between Marengo and the Bormida. The First Consul had established his headquarters at Torre Garofoli, which was further to the east. This headquarters, nowadays visitable, is situated in the street: &quot;Strada Comunale Cerca&quot; coordinates N44°53&#x27;37.01&quot; E 8°48&#x27;14.12&quot;

===Forces===

The 30,000 Austrians and their 100 guns were initially opposed by 22,000 French and their 15 guns. Meanwhile, after the arrival of Desaix, 6,000 men would reinforce Bonaparte&#x27;s army.

The 1799 campaign had exhausted the Austrian army in Italy, casualties and disease reducing some regiments to 300 men. The largest component of the army was in Piedmont and the neighbouring Po
valley; only a few units were moved to winter quarters in better-supplied areas. Long distances from the home bases, from which the regiments drew reinforcements, meant that troop transports had to endure miserable conditions, so only about 15% reached the field army. The army of March 1800 was scarcely larger than at the conclusion of the 1799 campaign. Equipment and uniforms were improved and updated. Although a simpler uniform, with a leather helmet and smaller-caliber muskets, was introduced, little had reached the field armies by 1800. Efforts were made to standardize equipment, but many units used a variety of musket and saber patterns. Melas split his army into three corps facing the Bormida, in front of Alessandria. In the north Ott commanded Friedrich Heinrich von Gottesheim&#x27;s advance guard plus Joseph von Schellenberg and Ludwig von Vogelsang&#x27;s divisions. In the south was Feldmarschallleutnant Andreas O&#x27;Reilly von Ballinlough&#x27;s division. Melas himself took control of the center, with the divisions of Karl Joseph Hadik von Futak, Konrad Valentin von Kaim, Ferdinand Johann von Morzin and Anton von Elsnitz.

In 1799 the 36,000 French troops in Italy were in a desperate state similar to that at the end of 1795. Supplies of all sorts were inadequate, discipline was breaking down, desertion was increasing and, on a few occasions, whole formations marched to the rear in search of food. The
survivors would be of limited combat value. In establishing the Army of the Reserve in France, Bonaparte&#x27;s first move was to overhaul the supply system to provide the troops with regular food and decent uniforms. Lacking the large superiority in infantry and artillery enjoyed in many
Republican campaigns, the core of Bonaparte&#x27;s reserve was 30,000 men, mostly from the Batavian Republic, who had been used under Guillaume Marie Anne Brune to crush the rebellion in the Vendée. Additional veteran troops came from the remains of the former Army of England. The new military doctrine emphasised the offensive, mobility and the bayonet over linear firepower. In front of the Austrian army were stationed, in and to the south of Marengo, the corps of Victor (Jacques-Antoine de Chambarlhac de Laubespin and Gaspard Amédée Gardanne&#x27;s divisions), supported on the left by François Étienne de Kellermann&#x27;s cavalry and, further to the northeast, by the corps of Lannes (François Watrin&#x27;s division, Mainoni&#x27;s brigade) together with two cavalry brigades. To the east of Castel Ceriolo took position Jean-Charles Monnier&#x27;s division, supported by the Guard, which formed the reserve. Victor was the one who would bear the brunt of the Austrian attack.

==Battle==
===Austrian attack===

The Austrian troops advanced from Alessandria eastwards across the river Bormida by two bridges debouching in a narrow bend of the river (the river being not easily crossed elsewhere). Poor Austrian staff work prevented any rapid development of their attack and the entire army had to file through a narrow bridgehead. The movement began about 6 am with the first shots fired around 8 am, but the attack was not fully developed until 9 am.

The 1,200-man Austrian advance guard, under Colonel (&quot;Oberst&quot;) Johann Maria Philipp Frimont and a division of 3,300 men under FML O&#x27;Reilly, pushed the French outposts back and deployed to become the Austrian right wing, driving the enemy from Pedrabona farm, then
heading south to tackle the French at La Stortiglione farm. The Austrian centre (about 18,000 under Melas) advanced towards Marengo until halted by GdD Gardanne&#x27;s French infantry deployed in front of the Fontanone stream. On the Austrian left, 7,500 men under FML Peter Ott waited for the road to clear before heading for the village of Castel Ceriolo well to the north of the French positions. This move threatened either an envelopment of the French right, or a further advance to cut the French line of communication with Milan.

Gardanne&#x27;s men gave a good account of themselves, holding up the Austrian deployment for a considerable time. When Gardanne&#x27;s division was exhausted, Victor pulled it back behind the Fontanone and committed his second division under GdD Chambarlhac (this officer soon lost his nerve and fled). The French held Marengo village and the line of the Fontanone until about noon, with both flanks in the air. First, at 8 am, Melas hurled FML Karl Joseph Hadik von Futak&#x27;s division (four battalions) at Victor&#x27;s defenses, supported by Frimont&#x27;s advance guard battery along the stream. Forced into a funnel by the bad ground and Fontanone stream, Hadik&#x27;s attack came under fire from two sides and failed, with Hadik being killed. The Austrian commander then committed FML Konrad Valentin von Kaim&#x27;s division but this attack was also thwarted by 11 am. Finally, as the French position was reinforced by François Étienne de Kellermann&#x27;s cavalry and Jean Lannes&#x27;s formation was on the way, FML Ferdinand Johann von Morzin&#x27;s elite grenadier division was sent in to attack Marengo village. Melas also committed a serious tactical blunder, detaching &quot;Generalmajor&quot; (GM) Nimptsch&#x27;s brigade of 2,300 hussars and two artillery batteries back over the Bormida bridge to block the corps of General Louis Gabriel Suchet, which was mistakenly reported around 9 am from Acqui Terme to be approaching Alessandria from the south. Besides delaying the crossing of the Austrian left wing, this also meant that, being 30 kilometers away, Nimptsch&#x27;s brigade would play no part in the battle.

====Stalemate in the centre around Marengo====

It took Bonaparte (5 kilometers away from Marengo) until about 10 am to recognize that the Austrian activity was not a diversionary attack to cover the anticipated retreat by Melas. His subordinates had brought their troops up in support of Victor&#x27;s corps. Lannes&#x27;s corps had deployed on the crucial right flank. GM Friedrich Joseph Anton von Bellegarde’s part of Kaim&#x27;s division had crossed the Fontanone north of Marengo and occupied La Barbotta farm. Lannes directed Watrin&#x27;s infantry to drive Bellegarde back. They briefly crossed the Fontanone before Austrian reserve guns drove the French back. Kellermann&#x27;s heavy cavalry brigade and the 8th Dragoons took up a covering position on the left, smashing an attempt by GM Giovanni Pilatti&#x27;s light dragoon brigade which attempted to cross the steep-sided Fontanone at its southern end to envelop Victor&#x27;s flank. On the right, GdB Pierre Champeaux was killed trying to stop the progress of Ott&#x27;s column. A small part of the 6ème Légère (6th Light Infantry Regiment) occupied Castel Ceriolo to the north, but soon Ott&#x27;s lead units took it around 11:30 am and began putting pressure on the French right flank. Ott could not see any sign of the expected main French advance from Sale (to the northeast), so he sent GM Friedrich Heinrich von Gottesheim’s reinforced advance guard to outflank Lannes north of Marengo. By 11 am Bonaparte was on the battlefield. He sent urgent recalls to his recently detached forces and summoned up his last reserves. As they came up, GdD Jean-Charles Monnier&#x27;s division and the Consular Guard were committed to extend and shore up the French right, rather than to try to hold Marengo where Victor&#x27;s men were running short of ammunition.

====Austrian breakout across the Fontanone====
Toward 12:30 pm Lannes moved the rest of his force to face Gottesheim in a hook shape, while Kaim attacked again, but this time against Victor&#x27;s wings. A &quot;Laufbrücke&quot; (small bridge) was thrown over the Fontanone and supported by reserve artillery. GM Christoph von Lattermann’s grenadiers crossed to engage Olivier Macoux Rivaud de la Raffinière’s two demibrigades defending Marengo village, while Bellegarde and Frimont&#x27;s four squadrons split Watrin off. Although Rivaud retook the village, O’Reilly had taken Stortiglione by 2:00 pm, and in the north, Ott prepared to send FML Joseph von Schellenberg’s column to support Gottesheim. After securing the Fontanone bridge, Pilatti&#x27;s cavalry crossed but were again charged and defeated by Kellermann. However, Victor could no longer hold his positions and withdrew southeast to the main vine belt (grape vines slung among mulberry trees), Lannes mirroring the move. The Marengo farm garrison was abandoned and at around 2:30 pm Melas led two cavalry squadrons to capture them.
At about 2:00 pm the French attacked Castel Ceriolo and delayed the advance of Schellenberg&#x27;s column by attacking its tail. Aided by Frimont, Ott defeated Monnier and forced two-thirds of his command to retreat to the northeast. About the same time, Marengo had fallen to the Austrians, forcing Napoleon&#x27;s men into a general retreat. As Austrian troops crossed the Fontanone, their guns bombarded the French infantry in the vines. In a bid to further delay Schellenberg&#x27;s advance, Bonaparte committed his main Guard battalion and its artillery, which moved to flank the column. After driving off Austrian dragoons with the aid of GdB Champeaux&#x27;s remaining cavalry (under Joachim Murat), they engaged the head of the column. After a 15-minute firefight around 4:00 pm the Guard were surprised and destroyed by Frimont&#x27;s cavalry.

The French fell back c. 3 km and attempted to regroup to hold the village of San Giuliano. With the French outnumbered and driven from their best defensive position, the battle was as good as won by the Austrians. Melas, who was slightly wounded, and 71, handed over command to his chief of staff, General Anton von Zach, and Kaim. The Austrian centre formed into a massive pursuit column in order to chase the French off the battlefield, with the advance guard commanded by GM Franz Xaver Saint-Julien. The column formed up around Spinetta, southeast of Marengo, and advanced down the New Road. However, delays in the flanks led to the Austrian army forming a crescent shape with a thinly stretched central sector. On the Austrian right wing, O&#x27;Reilly wasted time hunting down a 300-man French detachment led by Achille Dampierre (which was finally captured) and moved southeast. This took his troops out of supporting distance from the Austrian main body. On the Austrian left, Ott hesitated to press hard against the French because GdB Jean Rivaud&#x27;s small brigade of French cavalry hovered to the north.

===French counter-attack===
However, Desaix, in charge of the force Bonaparte had detached southwards, had hastened his advance and reached a small road junction north of Cascina Grossa (3 km west of San Giuliano). Shortly before 5:00 pm, he reported to Bonaparte in person with the news that his force (6,000 men and 9 guns of Boudet&#x27;s division) was not far behind. The story goes that, asked by Bonaparte what he thought of the situation, Desaix replied: &quot;This battle is completely lost. However, there is time to win another.&quot;

The French were fast to bring up and deploy the fresh troops in front of San Giuliano, and the Austrians were slow to mount their attack. Boudet and the 9ème Légère (9th Light Infantry Regiment) were quickly moved on to the exit from the main vine belt, where they surprised the head of Saint-Julien&#x27;s column. As the Austrian infantry deployed on the south side of the road, the 9ème Légère conducted a steady withdrawal for 30 minutes back to Desaix&#x27;s position. There he had placed GdB Louis Charles de Guénand&#x27;s brigade on the north side while most of the remaining French army (Monnier and Lannes) were forming up north from there. The Austrians deployed three artillery batteries on the north side of the road supported by a dragoon regiment. GdB Auguste de Marmont massed the remaining French cannon against the Austrians as they advanced. Boudet&#x27;s division advanced in line of brigades against the head of the Austrian column, defeating Saint-Julien&#x27;s leading Austrian brigade. Zach brought forward GM Lattermann&#x27;s grenadier brigade in line and renewed the attack. Faced with a crisis, Napoleon sent Desaix forward again and ordered a cavalry charge requested by Desaix. The 9ème Légère halted to face the main Austrian advance and Marmont&#x27;s guns blasted the Austrians with grapeshot at close range. Further back, an Austrian ammunition limber exploded. In the temporary heightening of confusion, Lattermann&#x27;s formation was charged on its left flank by Kellermann&#x27;s heavy cavalry (ca. 400 men) and disintegrated. At the decisive moment of the battle, Desaix was shot from his horse. Zach and at least 2,000 of his men were taken prisoners.
Murat and Kellermann immediately pounced on the supporting Liechtenstein Dragoons who were too slow to respond and routed them as well. The fleeing Austrian horsemen crashed into the ranks of Pilatti&#x27;s rattled troopers and carried them away. As the mob of terrified cavalry stampeded past them, the exhausted Austrian infantry of the main body lost heart, provoking a wild rush to the rear. The gun teams fled, pursued by French cavalry, while their whole infantry line advanced westward. The second grenadier brigade under GM Karl Philippi von Weidenfeld and some unpanicked cavalry delayed Boudet&#x27;s advance long enough for O’Reilly&#x27;s cavalry to return, and together with Frimont, they mounted a last defense around Marengo village as night fell, allowing the Austrian centre to reach safety behind the Bormida. Ott with the Austrian left failed to intervene and found his retreat through Castel Ceriolo blocked by French troops advancing northwest from the centre, but managed to fight his way back to the Bormida bridgehead.

The Austrians fell back into Alessandria, having lost about half the forces they had committed. The Austrians had lost heavily in the 12 hours of fighting: 15 colours, 40 guns, almost 8,000 taken prisoner, and 6,500 dead or wounded. French casualties (killed and wounded) were on the order of 4,700 and 900 missing or captured, but they retained the battlefield and the strategic initiative. Desaix&#x27;s body was found among the slain.

==Aftermath==
Bonaparte needed to depart for Paris urgently and the next morning sent Berthier on a surprise visit to Austrian headquarters. Within 24 hours of the battle, Melas entered into negotiations (the Convention of Alessandria) which led to the Austrians evacuating northwestern Italy west of the Ticino, and suspending military operations in Italy.

Bonaparte&#x27;s position as First Consul was strengthened by the successful outcome of the battle and the preceding campaign. After this victory, Napoleon could breathe a sigh of relief. The generals who had been hostile to him could see that his luck had not abandoned him. Thus, he had surpassed Schérer, Joubert, Championnet, and even Moreau, none of whom having been able to inflict a decisive blow on the Coalition. Moreau&#x27;s victory at Hohenlinden, which was the one that in reality had put an end to the war, was minimised by Bonaparte who, from then on, would pose as a saviour of the fatherland, and even of the Republic. He rejected offers from Louis XVIII, who had considered the Consulate to be a mere transition toward the restoration of the king. Thanks to the victory at Marengo, Napoleon could finally set about reforming France according to his own vision.

===Propaganda===
A last-gasp victory in reality, Marengo was mythologised in an army bulletin and three increasingly glamourised &quot;Official Reports&quot; during Bonaparte&#x27;s reign. Tales were invented about the Guard and the 72ème demibrigade, which had been under his direct control throughout.

General François Kellermann distinguished himself at Marengo. Melas, trapped in Alessandria with his hopes of breaking through to the east shattered, sent the same evening to Vienna a message in which he explained that the &quot;charge of Kellermann had broken the soldiers and this sudden and terrible change of fortunes finished by smashing the courage of the troops. The disorder of the cavalry which had disorganised our infantry precipitated its retreat.&quot; At the same time, Murat was writing to Berthier: &quot;I especially have to tell you about Kellermann; through a powerful charge he managed to tilt the balance in our favour.&quot; However, in the &quot;Bulletin de l&#x27;armée&quot; issued the following day, Napoleon sought to counterbalance Kellermann&#x27;s charge with Jean-Baptiste Bessières&#x27;s: &quot;The &quot;chef de brigade&quot; Bessières, in front of the reckless grenadiers of the guard, executed a charge with as much activity as valour and penetrated the line of the enemy cavalry; this resulted in the entire rout of the army.&quot;

Another piece of work which attempted to justify the retreat maneuver and to present it as a highly strategic calculation was Berthier&#x27;s &quot;Relation de la bataille de Marengo&quot;, published in 1804. Berthier suggests that time had to be given to Desaix and Boudet&#x27;s division to occupy their positions: &quot;The enemy general misinterpreted this maneuver and thought the army was in full retreat, while in reality it was only executing a movement of conversion.&quot; However, it is known that Desaix&#x27;s arrival, while definitely expected, was not certain before the retreat. The bulletin explains that Desaix&#x27;s forces were waiting in reserve with artillery pieces, which in reality was false, because they arrived late in the battle. Several participants to the fighting reveal the precarious condition of the army throughout the day, including Marmont in his Memoirs, Captain Coignet: &quot;We were retreating in good order but all ready to start running at the earliest sign of danger&quot;, Captain Gervais: &quot;In this battle, we were many times on the verge of being defeated. The enemy cavalry, on a terrain favourable to this arm, charged us repeatedly. We were often obliged to concentrate and even to retreat&quot;, and General Thévenet: &quot;There is no doubt that a part of the French army was repelled up to the Scrivia&quot;.

==Legacy==
===Marengo museum===
The Museum of Marengo &quot;Museo della Battaglia di Marengo&quot; is located in Via della Barbotta, Spinetta Marengo, Alessandria. This is the place where most of the fights between the French and Austrian armies took place. It is a part of Villa Delavo, with the park of the museum surrounding the village of Marengo.

===Remembrance===

Napoleon sought to ensure that his victory would not be forgotten, so, besides the propaganda campaign, he entrusted General Chasseloup with the construction of a pyramid on the site of the battle. On 5 May 1805, a ceremony took place on the field of Marengo. Napoleon, together with Empress Joséphine seated on a throne placed under a tent, oversaw a military parade. Then, Chasseloup gave Napoleon the founding stone, on which was inscribed: &quot;Napoleon, Emperor of the French and King of Italy, to the &quot;manes&quot; of the defenders of the fatherland who perished on the day of Marengo.&quot; This pyramid was actually part of a very ambitious project meant to glorify Bonaparte&#x27;s conquests in Italy. The field of Marengo was supposed to become the site of a &quot;city of Victories&quot; whose boulevards, named after Italian battles, would converge to the pyramid. In the event, the project was abandoned in 1815 and the stones recovered by the peasants. The column erected in 1801 was also removed, only to be restored in 1922.

Napoleon ordered that several ships of the French Navy be named Marengo, including &quot;Sceptre (1780)&quot;, &quot;Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1795)&quot;, &quot;Ville de Paris (1851)&quot; and &quot;Marengo (1810)&quot;. In 1802, the Marengo department was named in the honour of the battle. Furthermore, Napoleon&#x27;s mount throughout the battle was named Marengo and further carried the Emperor in the Battle of Austerlitz, Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, Battle of Wagram, and Battle of Waterloo.

After Napoleon&#x27;s fall, Marengo County, Alabama, first settled by Napoleonic refugees with their Vine and Olive Colony, was named in honour of this battle. Since then, numerous settlements were named Marengo in Canada and the United States (see places named Marengo).

Presently, a museum of the battle exists on the outskirts of Alessandria. Re-enactments are also organised every year to commemorate the event.

<text>Bremen (), officially the Free [[Hanseatic League#Lists of former Hansa cities|Hanseatic]] City of Bremen (; ), is the smallest and least populous of Germany&#x27;s 16 states. It is informally called (&#x27;State of Bremen&#x27;), although the term is sometimes used in official contexts. The state consists of the city of Bremen and its seaport exclave, Bremerhaven, surrounded by the larger state of Lower Saxony in northern Germany.

==Geography==
The state of Bremen consists of two non-contiguous territories. These enclaves contain Bremen, officially the &#x27;City&#x27; (&quot;Stadtgemeinde Bremen&quot;) which is the state capital, and the city of Bremerhaven (&quot;Stadt Bremerhaven&quot;). Both are located on the River Weser; Bremerhaven (&quot;Bremen&#x27;s harbour&quot;) is further downstream on the mouth of the Weser with open access to the North Sea. Both enclaves are completely surrounded by the neighbouring State of Lower Saxony (&quot;Niedersachsen&quot;). The highest point in the state is in Friedehorst Park (32.5 metres; 107&#x27;).

==History==
When the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in 1806, what had been since 1646 (after earlier privileges of autonomy of 1186) the Free Imperial City of Bremen was not mediatised. Rather than being incorporated into the enlarged territory of one of the surrounding monarchies, it was recognised (along with Hamburg) as a sovereign &quot;Free Hanseatic City&quot;. Its currency until 1873 was the Bremen thaler. 

In 1811, in an effort to enforce Napoleon&#x27;s Berlin Decree embargoing Britain, the First French Empire had annexed the city-state. But at the Congress of Vienna of 1815, Bremen&#x27;s emissary, and later burgomaster, Johann Smidt, lobbied successfully to have the city&#x27;s independence restored as one of the 39 sovereign states within the new German Confederation.

In 1827, Bremen bought land at the mouth of the Weser from the Kingdom of Hanover, in order to build a new seaport, Bremerhaven. This ensured that Bremen remained Germany&#x27;s main port of embarkation for emigrants to the Americas, and that it developed as an entrepôt for Germany&#x27;s late developing colonial trade.

In 1867, the year following Prussia&#x27;s defeat of Austria and its annexation of Hanover, Bremen joined the North German Confederation. In 1871, following victory over the French, this became the German Empire with Bremen as one of the Reich&#x27;s 26 constituent states.

As an international port and industrial centre, Bremen had a strong left and liberal tradition. In January 1913, at the last elections to the Imperial Reichstag in Berlin, the Social Democrats (SPD) secured over half the vote, or 53.4%. Left Liberals (Linksliberale) took another 41.4%. Only 5.1% went to the Conservatives. During the Weimar Republic, there were seven elections to the &quot;Burgerschaft&quot;, the Bremen parliament. At the November 1932 German federal election, the last broadly free election during this time, the Social Democrats won 31.2% of the vote, and the Communists (KPD) 16.8%, compared to 20.8% for the Nazis.

Following the heavily compromised national elections of March 1933, the Nazis still achieved only a third of the popular vote in Bremen (32.7%). Bremen, like all the German states, then underwent the process of &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; (coordination) whereby the Nazi regime, through a campaign of violent demonstrations and intimidation, first forced the resignation of the executive Senate and later dissolved the &quot;Bürgerschaft&quot;. Bremen remained for the next twelve years under the direct authority of a &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; (Reich Governor) who simultaneously held the post of Nazi Party &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Gau Weser-Ems. During these years, Bremen&#x27;s small Jewish community (1,438 people registered at the beginning of 1933) was destroyed through coerced emigration and deportation to death camps in the occupied east.

Allied bombing during World War II destroyed or severely damaged 60% of the city&#x27;s built fabric, including much of its historic centre. Following a further bombardment, British troops entered Bremen in late April 1945. Transferred to the Americans, Bremen became the supply port for the US zones of occupation in west Berlin and southern Germany.

The city was reestablished as a state in 1947 and, from 1949, was again known as the &quot;Free Hanseatic City of Bremen&quot;, becoming a Land or state of the new Federal Republic of Germany, informally referred to as &quot;West Germany&quot; until 1990.

==Politics==
===Political system===

The legislature of the state of Bremen is the 87-member Bürgerschaft (citizens&#x27; assembly), elected by the citizens in the two cities of Bremen and Bremerhaven.

The executive is constituted by the Senate of Bremen, elected by the Bürgerschaft. The Senate is chaired by the President of the senate (&quot;Senatspräsident&quot;), who is also one of the mayors of the city of Bremen (&quot;Bürgermeister&quot;) and is elected directly by the Bürgerschaft. The Senate selects of its members as a second mayor who serves as deputy of the president. In contrast to the Federal Chancellor of Germany or other German states, the President of the Senate has no authority to override senators on policy, which is decided upon by the senate collectively. Since 1945, the Senate has continuously been dominated by the Social Democratic Party.

On a municipal level, the two cities in the state are administered separately:
* The administration of the city of Bremen is headed by the two mayors and controlled by the portion of the Bürgerschaft elected in the city of Bremen (72 members).
* Bremerhaven, on the other hand, has a municipal assembly distinct from the state legislature and an administration under a distinct head mayor (&quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot;) and a distinct second mayor.

===Political majorities===
In post-war Bremen, the port, shipyards and related industries sustained a large and unionised working class. As before 1933, this translated into support for the Social Democrats, considered Bremen&#x27;s natural governing party. However, in the 1980s mechanisation of the port and closure of the city&#x27;s leading shipbuilder induced an employment crisis and shook the confidence of the party&#x27;s traditional voter base. The SPD, which had still polled 51% in 1987, lost its effective majority. The once dominant left-liberal vote split, and coalition government became the norm.

The 2019 Bremen state election was held on 26 May 2019 to elect the members of the Bürgerschaft of Bremen, as well as the city councils of Bremen and Bremerhaven. The election took place on the same day as the 2019 European Parliament election. The Christian Democratic Union (CDU), for the first time, became the largest party in the Bürgerschaft, while the Social Democratic Party (SPD) fell to second place. The Greens and The Left made small gains. After the election, the SPD, Greens, and Left agreed to form a coalition government. Carsten Sieling resigned as mayor and was replaced by fellow SPD member Andreas Bovenschulte.

==Economy==
Bremen&#x27;s post-World War II economy boomed in line with the &quot;Wirtschaftswunder&quot; (English: &quot;economic miracle&quot;) of the 1950s and 1960s in West Germany. This saw the growth and permanent settlement in Bremen of a large migrant worker population of &quot;Gastarbeiter&quot; (English: &quot;guest workers&quot;), drawn largely from Turkey and other countries in Southern Europe.

Some of the city&#x27;s heavier industries failed to recover from the 1973 oil-price-shock recession. Specialist construction yards, ship outfitters and parts suppliers remain, but AG Weser (which employed 16,000 workers at its peak) and Bremer Vulkan, Bremen&#x27;s major shipbuilders, closed in 1983 and 1997 respectively. Further job losses were caused by the restructuring and increasing mechanization of harbour-related activities and other industrial sectors. Semi and unskilled harbour workers found it very difficult to re-enter the labour market, and unemployment—for a period in the 1980s almost double the West German average—remained comparatively high.

At a time when structural change in the economy has forced Bremen to spend more on social services, suburbanization has reduced population and tax revenue, namely due to 1969 federal tax reform—before that, income taxes would be collected by the municipality of the workplace, but after that, by the municipality of the residency. Incorporating surrounding suburban municipalities is not an option for the state of Bremen, as these already belong to the state of Lower Saxony.

With financial assistance from the European Union and the Federal Government of Germany, economic policy has focused on supporting those established economic sectors that are based on advanced technology, such as aerospace and aircraft production, automobile production, maritime and logistics services, and on developing the education and business-park infrastructure for new science-based and digital enterprises. In this an important role is accorded to the growing university sector. Further investment went into the revitalisation of the city centre but a culture-driven regeneration around entertainment and tourism was not very successful. Several experts described Bremen&#x27;s service sector as underdeveloped, due to a lack of major company headquarters.

=== Unemployment ===
At the turn of the 21st century, unemployment in Bremen stood at 13%, a rate matched in the Federal Republic only by the &quot;new states&quot; in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). By 2022, while reduced to 10.2% it was the highest among all 16 German states.
===Industries===
Despite historic job losses in the industrial sector, the state of Bremen has retained, and continues to develop, a broad manufacturing base:

*Automotive with Mercedes-Benz factory, which is main manufacturing base of C-Class (12,500 employees). Automotive components from Hella and Lear. Assembly lines for powertrain and batteries are supplied from ThyssenKrupp Automation Engineering.
*Aerospace with Airbus aircraft component factories (4,100 employees), rocket components Ariane (550 empl.) and spacecraft OHB (1,200 empl.)
*Iron &amp; Steel with large ArcelorMittal work (3,000 employees);
*Electronic manufacturers for naval/marine Atlas Elektronik (1,400 employees) and defence Rheinmetall Defence Electronics (1,200 employees)
*Shipbuilding represented Lürssen Bremen features the full spectrum of construction, production and assembly facilities for superyachts greater than 100 in length (1,200 employees).
*Food manufacturing of coffee (Kraft, Jacobs, Melitta, Eduscho, Azul), chocolate (Hachez), beer (Beck&#x27;s Brewery), cereal food (Kellogg&#x27;s), fish (Frosta, Frozen Fish, Deutsche See), dairy products (DMK Deutsches Milchkontor), pet food (Vitacraft)

===Education===
The University of Bremen is the largest university in Bremen. It is one of 11 institutions classed as an &quot;Elite university&quot; in Germany, and teaches approximately 23,500 people from 126 countries. Bremen also has a University of the Arts Bremen, a University of Applied Sciences with campuses in both Bremen city and Bremerhaven, and more recently the Jacobs University Bremen, an international research university located in Vegesack.

<doc id="157674" wikidata="Q220806" url="?curid=157674" title="Bohemond I of Antioch">
<text>Bohemond I of Antioch (5 or 7 March 1111), also known as Bohemond of Taranto or Bohemond of Hauteville, was the prince of Taranto from 1089 to 1111 and the prince of Antioch from 1098 to 1111. He was a leader of the First Crusade, leading a contingent of Normans on the quest eastward. Knowledgeable about the Byzantine Empire through earlier campaigns with his father, he was the most experienced military leader of the crusade.

==Early life==

===Childhood and youth===

Bohemond was the son of Robert Guiscard, Count of Apulia and Calabria, and his first wife, Alberada of Buonalbergo. He was born between 1050 and 1058—in 1054 according to historian John Julius Norwich. He was baptised Mark, possibly because he was born at his father&#x27;s castle at San Marco Argentano in Calabria.

His parents were related within the degree of kinship that made their marriage invalid under canon law. In 1058, Pope Nicholas II strengthened existing canon law against consanguinity and, on that basis, Guiscard repudiated Alberada in favour of a then more advantageous marriage to Sikelgaita, the sister of Gisulf, the Lombard Prince of Salerno. With the annulment of his parents&#x27; marriage, Bohemond became a bastard. Before long, Alberada married Robert Guiscard&#x27;s nephew, Richard of Hauteville. She arranged for a knightly education for Bohemond. Bohemond was multilingual. Apart from his native Norman, he most likely understood or even spoke Romance &quot;Lombard Italian&quot; and spoke and possibly even read Greek.

Robert Guiscard was taken seriously ill in early 1073. Fearing that he was dying, Sikelgaita held an assembly in Bari. She persuaded Robert&#x27;s vassals who were present to proclaim her eldest son, the thirteen-year-old Roger Borsa, Robert&#x27;s heir, claiming that the half-Lombard Roger would be the ruler most acceptable to the Lombard nobles in Southern Italy. Robert&#x27;s nephew, Abelard of Hauteville, was the only baron to protest, because he regarded himself Robert&#x27;s lawful heir.

===Byzantine wars===

Bohemond fought in his father&#x27;s army during the rebellion of Jordan I of Capua, Geoffrey of Conversano and other Norman barons in 1079. His father dispatched him at the head of an advance guard against the Byzantine Empire in early 1081 and he captured Valona (now Vlorë in Albania). He sailed to Corfu, but did not invade the island since the local garrison outnumbered his army. He withdrew to Butrinto to await the arrival of his father&#x27;s forces. After Robert Guiscard arrived in the latter half of May, they laid siege to Dyrrhachium (present-day Durrës). The Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos came to the rescue of the town but, on 18 October, his army suffered a crushing defeat. Bohemond commanded the left flank, which defeated the Emperor&#x27;s largely Anglo-Saxon Varangian Guard.

The Normans captured Dyrrhachium on 21 February 1082. They marched along the Via Egnatia as far as Kastoria, but Alexios&#x27;s agents stirred up a rebellion in Southern Italy, forcing Robert Guiscard to return to his realm in April. He charged Bohemond with the command of his army in the Balkans. Bohemond defeated the Byzantines at Ioannina and at Arta, taking control of most of Macedonia and Thessaly; however, the six-month siege of Larissa was unsuccessful. Supply and pay problems (and the gifts promised to deserters by the Byzantines) undermined the morale of the Norman army, so Bohemond returned to Italy for financial support. During his absence, most of the Norman commanders deserted to the Byzantines and a Venetian fleet recaptured Dyrrhachium and Corfu.

Bohemond accompanied his father to the Byzantine Empire again in 1084, when they defeated the Venetian fleet and captured Corfu. An epidemic decimated the Normans and Bohemond, who was taken seriously ill, was forced to return to Italy in December 1084.

===Succession crisis===

Robert Guiscard died at Cephalonia on 17 July 1085. Orderic Vitalis, William of Malmesbury and other contemporaneous writers accused his widow, Sikelgaita, of having poisoned Robert to secure Apulia for her son, Roger Borsa, but failed to establish her guilt. She persuaded the army to acclaim Roger Borsa his father&#x27;s successor and they hurried back to Southern Italy. Two months later, the assembly of the Norman barons confirmed the succession, but Bohemond regarded himself his father&#x27;s lawful heir. He made an alliance with Jordan of Capua, and captured Oria and Otranto. Bohemond and Roger Borsa met at their father&#x27;s tomb at Venosa to reach a compromise. Under the terms of their agreement, Bohemond received Taranto, Oria, Otranto, Brindisi (through the transfer of Geoffrey of Conversano&#x27;s vassalage from Roger to Bohemond) and Gallipoli, but acknowledged Roger Borsa&#x27;s succession.

Bohemond renewed the war against his brother in the autumn of 1087. The ensuing civil war prevented the Normans from supporting Pope Urban II, and enabled the brothers&#x27; uncle, Roger I of Sicily, to increase his power. Bohemond captured Bari in 1090 and before long, took control of most lands to the south of Melfi.

==Physical appearance==
Byzantine princess Anna Komnene, in her Alexiad wrote a description of Bohemond&#x27;s physical appearance; “The appearance of this man was, to put it briefly, unlike that of any other man whether Greek or barbarian seen in those days on Roman soil. The sight of him inspired admiration, the mention of his name terror. I will describe in detail the barbarian&#x27;s characteristics. His stature was such that he towered almost a full cubit over the tallest men. He was slender of waist and flanks, with broad shoulders and chest, strong in the arms; overall he was neither too slender, nor too heavily built and fleshy, but perfectly proportioned - one might say that he conformed to the ideal of Polyklitos. His hands were large, he had a good firm stance, and his neck and back were compact. If to the astute and meticulous observer he appeared to stoop slightly, that was not caused by any weakness of the vertebrae of the lower spine, but presumably there was some malformation there from birth. The skin all over his body was very pale, except for his face which was pale but with some colour to it too. His hair was light-colored and did not go down to his shoulders as it does with other barbarians; in fact, the man had no great predilection for long hair, but cut his short, to the ears. Whether his beard was red or of any other color I cannot say, for the razor had passed over it closely, leaving his chin smoother than any marble. However, it seemed that it would have been red. His eyes were light-blue and gave some hint of the man&#x27;s spirit and dignity. He breathed freely through nostrils that were broad, worthy of his chest and a fine outlet for the breath that came in gusts from his lungs.&quot;

== First Crusade ==
In 1097, Bohemond and his uncle Roger I of Sicily were attacking Amalfi, which had revolted against Duke Roger, when bands of crusaders began to pass on their way through Italy to Constantinople. It is possible that Bohemond had religious reasons for joining the First Crusade. It is equally likely that he saw in the First Crusade the chance to gain a lordship in the Middle East. Lilie details that Bohemond&#x27;s &quot;father&#x27;s second marriage deprived him of future prospects,&quot; in Norman Italy. While he was well known as a warrior, Bohemond&#x27;s lordship in Italy was small. Geoffrey Malaterra bluntly states that Bohemond took the Cross with the intention of plundering and conquering Byzantine lands. Another reason to suspect Bohemond&#x27;s religious zeal is the supposed embassy Bohemond sent to Godfrey of Bouillon, a powerful Crusade leader, asking him to join forces to sack Constantinople. While Godfrey declined his offer, taking Constantinople was never far from Bohemond&#x27;s mind, as seen in his later attempt to take over the Byzantine Empire.

He gathered a Norman army, which would have been one of the smaller crusade forces with 500 knights and about 2,500–3,500 infantry soldiers, alongside his nephew Tancred&#x27;s force of 2,000 men. What contributed to the Norman army&#x27;s reputation as a great fighting force was their experience fighting in the East. Many Normans had been employed as mercenaries by the Byzantine Empire. Others like Bohemond had experience fighting the Byzantines and Muslim groups in the East fifteen years prior with Robert Guiscard. Bohemond crossed the Adriatic Sea to Constantinople along the route he had tried to follow in 1082–1084 when attacking the Byzantine Empire. He was careful to observe the correct attitude towards Alexios along this route, which was mainly keeping his soldiers from plundering Byzantine villages en route to Constantinople.

When he arrived at Constantinople in April 1097, he took an oath of homage to Emperor Alexios, which he demanded from all crusade leaders. It&#x27;s not clear what exact negotiations Bohemond and Alexios made concerning Bohemond governing the part of the eastern lands of the Byzantine Empire Alexios hoped the crusaders would reclaim. Alexios had no reason to trust Bohemond enough to give him a position at the time, but hinted that he could get a position by proving his loyalty, similarly to Bohemond&#x27;s half-brother Guy. Bohemond&#x27;s best chance at gaining a favorable position was to be loyal to Alexios, which he attempted to prove while the crusaders were camped around Constantinople. Bohemond, proficient in Greek, was a conduit between Alexios and the crusade leaders. Bohemond also attempted to prove his loyalty by convincing other crusade leaders to take the oath of homage to Alexios.

From Constantinople to Antioch, Bohemond was a stand out among the leaders of the First Crusade. Bohemond&#x27;s reputation as an effective strategist and leader came from his fighting experience in the Balkans when he took charge of his father&#x27;s army against Emperor Alexios (1082–1085). There Bohemond became familiar with various Byzantine and Muslim strategies, including an encircling strategy used by Turkish forces at the siege of Nicaea. Mounted archers would encircle the crusader force, who would be unable to retaliate using close combat weaponry. Bohemond&#x27;s familiarity with this Eastern strategy allowed him to adapt quickly, leading to crusader victories through Antioch.

The Emperor&#x27;s daughter, Anna Comnena, leaves a portrait of him in her &quot;Alexiad&quot;. She met him for the first time when she was fourteen and was seemingly fascinated by him, leaving no similar portrait of any other Crusader prince. Of Bohemond, she wrote:
Bohemond saw the opportunity to use the crusade for his own ends at the siege of Antioch. When his nephew Tancred left the main army at Heraclea Cybistra and attempted to establish a footing in Cilicia, the movement may have been already intended as a preparation for Bohemond&#x27;s eastern principality. Bohemond was the first to take up a position before Antioch (October 1097). In the subsequent siege of Antioch, he played a key role in gathering supplies, stopping the attempt of Ridwan of Aleppo to relieve the city from the east, and connecting the besiegers on the west with the Genoese fleet which lay in the port of St. Simeon. Due to his successful efforts Bohemond was seen as the actual leader of the siege of Antioch, rather than the elected leader Stephen of Blois, who would soon leave the siege, claiming illness.

Bohemond was able to make a deal with Firouz, one of the commanders of the city wall to end the siege of Antioch. However, he did not press to end the siege until May 1098 when learning of the approach of Kerbogha with a relief army. He then proposed to the other crusade leaders that the one to take Antioch should be put in charge of the city, as Alexios&#x27; representative Tetigus had left in February 1098. Firouz led Bohemond&#x27;s force up the walls of Antioch, allowing the Norman troops to infiltrate and ultimately capture the city.

The Crusaders&#x27; troubles were not over, however, as Kerbogha started his own siege on Antioch. Bohemond was credited as the general and creator of the battle plan used to defeat Kerbogha by Raymond of Aguilers. Running very low on food and supplies Bohemond took the initiative by leaving the city and attacking Kerbogha&#x27;s forces, leading to a victory for the crusaders.

Bohemond then wanted to take control of Antioch for himself, but there were some problems he had to face first. Raymond of Toulouse, a prominent crusade leader, did not want to hand Antioch over to Bohemond. Raymond claimed that Bohemond and other leaders would be breaking their oath to Alexios, which was to give any conquered lands to the Byzantine Empire. Bohemond argued that because Alexios had failed to come to the crusaders&#x27; aid at Antioch that the oath was no longer valid. Bohemond set himself up as the Prince of Antioch, and no Latin crusader or Byzantine force came to take it from him. Raymond of Toulouse decided to give up Antioch to Bohemond in January 1099, as the other crusaders moved south to the capture of Jerusalem.

After the fall of Jerusalem, Bohemond was besieging the Byzantine garrison in Latakia but he was forced by returning crusading leaders, including Raymond, to abandon the siege. Bohemond went together with Baldwin of Edessa to Jerusalem at Christmas 1099 to fulfill his crusade vows. While there he took part in the installation of Dagobert of Pisa as Patriarch of Jerusalem, perhaps in order to check the growth of Godfrey and his knights of Lorraine&#x27;s power in the city. By submitting to the patriarch, Bohemond made connections to Jerusalem, a potential ally against future attacks on Antioch, and to remain in the Pope&#x27;s good graces. While Bohemond had the fine territory, strategic position, and army necessary to found a principality in Antioch, he had to face two great forces—the Byzantine Empire, which claimed the whole of his territories, and the strong Muslim principalities in the north-east of Syria. Against these two forces he would ultimately fail.

==Wars between Antioch and the Byzantine Empire==
In 1100, Bohemond received a petition for help from Armenian chieftain Gabriel of Melitene. Gabriel was in possession of one of the major cities controlling the access to Anatolia and had received reports that Gazi Gümüshtigin of Sebastea was preparing an expedition to capture Melitene. The Armenians sought help from Bohemond and even offered his daughter in marriage.

Afraid to weaken his forces at Antioch, but not wishing to avoid the chance to extend his domain northwards, in August 1100 Bohemond marched north with only 300 knights and a small force of foot soldiers. Failing to send scouting parties, they were ambushed by the Turks and completely encircled at the Battle of Melitene. Bohemond managed to send one soldier to seek help from Baldwin of Edessa but was captured. He was laden with chains and imprisoned in Neo-Caesarea (modern Niksar) until 1103.

Emperor Alexios was incensed that Bohemond had broken his oath made in Constantinople and kept Antioch for himself. When he heard of Bohemond&#x27;s capture, he offered to redeem the Norman commander for 260,000 dinars, if Gümüshtigin would hand the prisoner over to Byzantium. When Kilij Arslan I, the Seljuk overlord of Gümüshtigin, heard of the proposed payment, he threatened to attack unless given half the ransom. Bohemond proposed instead a ransom of 130,000 dinars paid just to Gümüshtigin. The bargain was concluded, and Gümüshtigin and Bohemond exchanged oaths of friendship. Ransomed by Baldwin of Edessa, he returned in triumph to Antioch in August 1103. Instrumental in the release of Bohemond was according to Matthew of Edessa the Armenian Kogh Vasil, who organised the collection of ransom, contributing substantially himself and apparently even adopting Bohemond as son afterwards.

His nephew Tancred had taken his uncle&#x27;s place for three years. During that time, he had attacked the Byzantines, and had added Tarsus, Adana and Massissa in Cilicia to his uncle&#x27;s territory; he was now deprived of his lordship by Bohemond&#x27;s return. During the summer of 1103, the northern Franks attacked Ridwan of Aleppo to gain supplies and compelled him to pay tribute. Meanwhile, Raymond of Toulouse had established himself in Tripoli with the aid of Alexios, and was able to check the expansion of Antioch to the south. Early in 1104, Baldwin and Bohemond passed Aleppo to move eastward and attack Harran.

Whilst leading the campaign against Harran, Bohemond was defeated at Balak, near Raqqa on the Euphrates (see Battle of Harran). The defeat was decisive, making the great eastern principality which Bohemond had contemplated impossible. It was followed by a Greek attack on Cilicia and, despairing of his own resources, Bohemond returned to Europe for reinforcements in late 1104. It is a matter of historical debate whether his &quot;crusade&quot; against the Byzantine empire was to gain the backing and indulgences of Pope Paschal II. Either way, he enthralled audiences across France with gifts of relics from the Holy Land and tales of heroism while fighting the infidel, gathering a large army in the process. Henry I of England famously prevented him from landing on English shores, since the king anticipated Bohemond&#x27;s great attraction to the English nobility. His newfound status won him the hand of Constance, daughter of the French king, Philip I. Of this marriage wrote Abbot Suger:
Bohemond and Constance produced a son, Bohemond II of Antioch.
Bohemond saw the root of his problems in Alexios and Constantinople when it came to preserving the Principality of Antioch. In speech at the shrine of Saint-Léonard-de-Noblat in early 1106, written down by Bishop Walram of Naumburg, Bohemond said of the emperor:

Bohemond was then resolved to use his newly recruited army of 34,000 men not to defend Antioch against the Greeks, but to attack Alexios. Bohemond took a route similar to the one that was successful for his father in Illyria and Greece. Alexios, aided by the Venetians, proved to be much stronger than when he faced Bohemond and Robert Guiscard in 1082–1084. Alexios was used to Norman battle tactics and their strength, and decided on a war of attrition rather than face them head on. During the Norman siege of Dyrrhachium of 1107–1108, Alexios blockaded the Norman camp until Bohemond was forced to negotiate.

Bohemond had to submit to a humiliating peace, all his ambitions destroyed. Under the Treaty of Deabolis in 1108, he became the vassal of Alexios with the title of &quot;sebastos&quot;, consented to receive Alexios&#x27; pay, and promised to cede disputed territories and to admit a Greek patriarch into Antioch. Henceforth, Bohemond was a broken man. He died six months later without returning to Antioch. With one last jab at Alexios, by not returning to Antioch the Treaty of Deabolis became null and void as it only applied to Bohemond himself. Antioch was left in Norman hands with Bohemond&#x27;s nephew Tancred.

Bohemond was buried at Canosa in Apulia, in 1111.

==Bohemond I in literature and media==
The anonymous &quot;Gesta Francorum&quot; was written by one of Bohemond&#x27;s followers. The &quot;Alexiad&quot; of Anna Comnena is a primary authority for the whole of his life. A 1924 biography exists by R. B. Yewdale. See also the &quot;Gesta Tancredi&quot; by Ralph of Caen, which is a panegyric of Bohemond&#x27;s second-in-command, Tancred. His career is discussed by B. von Kügler, &quot;Bohemund und Tancred&quot; (1862); while L. von Heinemann, &quot;Geschichte der Normannen in Sizilien und Unteritalien&quot; (1894), and Reinhold Röhricht&#x27;s &quot;Geschichte des ersten Kreuzzuges&quot; (1901) and &quot;Geschichte des Königreichs Jerusalem&quot; (1898) may also be consulted for his history. The only major biography (of Tancred) that exists in English is &quot;Tancred: a study of his career and work in their relation to the First Crusade and the establishment of the Latin states in Syria and Palestine&quot; by Robert Lawrence Nicholson. Details of his pre-crusade career can found in Geoffrey Malaterra&#x27;s &quot;Deeds of Count Roger...&quot;.

&quot;Count Bohemund&quot; by Alfred Duggan (1964) is a historical novel concerning the life of Bohemond and its events up to the fall of Jerusalem to the crusaders. Bohemond also appears in the historical novel &quot;Silver Leopard&quot; by F. Van Wyck Mason (1955), the short story &quot;The Track of Bohemond&quot; in the collection &quot;The Road of Azrael&quot; by Robert E. Howard (1979) and in the fantastical novel &quot;Pilgermann&quot; by Russell Hoban (1983).

The historical fiction novel &quot;Wine of Satan&quot; (1949) written by Laverne Gay gives an embellished accounting of the life of Bohemond.

The &quot;Crusades&quot; series by David Donachie (writing as Jack Ludlow) casts Bohemond as the main protagonist.

In &quot;Age of Empires II: Lords of the West&quot;, there are two campaigns relating to Bohemond for his victory against Alexios Kommenus and his defending against Kerbogha&#x27;s siege of Antioch.

<text>The Unseen is an American punk rock band that was formed in 1993 in Hingham, Massachusetts. One of the more prominent bands to revive street punk, The Unseen was originally called The Extinct.

==History==
The first incarnation of The Unseen was formed in Hingham, Massachusetts in 1993 after Drummer Mark Civitarese, Bassist Tripp Underwood, and guitarist Paul Morey parted ways with their original singer, In search of a replacement lead singer, local varsity hockey star Marc Carlson was recruited, the band played their first show at an event known as Hagapolozza, Morey soon lost interest in playing guitar and left the group not long after, Phil Reily was brought in as a replacement, but he was dismissed after a show at the Cape Cod hard rock club, the Approach, local guitarist Scott Hadyia was offered to join, after a few practices, he joined the group, the band soon recorded their first &quot;7&quot;, &quot;Too Young to Know to Reckless to Care&quot;, after the release of their &quot;7&quot;, the band and Carlson parted ways, Not long after his dismissal, Paul Russo, a long time friend of Tripp started hanging around practices and he was asked to join the band, more shows followed, the band recorded and released two EP&#x27;s, &quot;Protect and Serve&quot; and &quot;Raise your finger, Raise your Fist&quot;, which were released within months of each other, the band began touring up and down the New England area, a year later the band released their first album, &quot;Lower Class Crucifixion&quot;, after a few tours, Russo left the band to go play drums in Blanks 77, he was replaced by band roadie, Brian &quot;Chainsaw&quot; Reily, this lineup recorded a few songs that would end up on a split EP with Tom and Boot Boys, and two songs, &quot;System’s Destruction&quot;and &quot;No Evacuation&quot;, on a compilation called &quot;Sound of Rebellion&quot;, after six months, Russo rejoined the band, keeping Chainsaw on as a singer/3rd Guitarist, after a tour with Anti-Flag, the band parted ways with Chainsaw. They then moved to Boston. Along with other street punk bands, they set out to revive the English street punk sound of the 1980s.

The quintet released a best-of compilation for the European market in June 2000 titled &quot;Totally Unseen: The Best of the Unseen&quot;, which contained two previously unreleased tracks.

The group&#x27;s solid early line-up consisted of Tripp on bass guitar and vocals, Scott on lead guitar, Civitarese on drums and vocals and Paul Russo on second guitar and vocals as well as drums and bass guitar during live shows when the band switched instruments for certain songs. Most shows began with Russo and Tripp singing lead, and ended with Russo playing drums and Civitarese singing lead. Russo went on to play in The Pinkerton Thugs as well as a solo project called The Strings. He is currently playing in a punk band called Broken Stereo.

Mark Unseen (real name: Mark Civitarese), who played drums on the band&#x27;s first few albums, became the lead singer after Russo&#x27;s departure. He also formed and runs ADD Records. He briefly joined the Boston punk group A Global Threat as a second singer, and recorded the full-length albums &quot;What The Fuck Will Change?&quot; and &quot;Until We Die&quot; before deciding to concentrate on his work with The Unseen. However shortly after his departure he and Unseen guitarist Scott with Mike Graves and Peter Curtis (then both members of A Global Threat) formed Self Destruct. They released only one 7-inch EP, entitled &quot;Violent Affair&quot;, and played fewer than ten shows but the musical style and lyrical content displayed on their one record had great influence on all Unseen music to follow, helping to shape their future sound with Civitarese as lead singer. In 2010, Civitarese started a punk rock band called Ashers and released a 7&quot; vinyl and full-length album &quot;Kill Your Master&quot;. More recently, Civitarese joined with various member of Boston&#x27;s hardcore scene to form the hardcore/metal band Tenebrae.

There has been some controversy concerning the band, including allegations that in recent years they have &quot;sold out&quot; and that the band should have stopped after losing Russo and therefore their strong political message. (Russo wrote and sang most of &quot;Lower Class Crucifixion&quot;, &quot;So This Is Freedom?&quot; and &quot;The Anger and The Truth&quot;.) Most widely criticised is that The Unseen have produced music videos to show on commercial music video channels such as GMTV2, a practice looked-down upon in the underground street punk scene which also goes against the political message of the first few albums. Darkbuster, a band from The Unseen&#x27;s area of origin, even released a joke song called &quot;I Hate The Unseen&quot;. Members of Darkbuster and The Unseen are friends.

They have toured Europe, North America, Australia, Japan and Mexico with other punk bands such as The Bouncing Souls and Rancid and decidedly more hardcore bands like Hatebreed and Sick of It All. Since the departure of Russo, the band has used many replacements on tour such as members of The Virus, Strike Anywhere and F-Minus. However, recently, on their MySpace page, The Unseen have included a fifth band member, Jonny Thayer, formerly a guitarist with A Global Threat, who was in the band at the same time as Civitarese.

In 2006, the publication of Underwood&#x27;s book, &quot;So This Is Readin&#x27;?&quot;, detailed the life and hardships of being in an underground band with dry comedy. It started as a lengthy band history on the band&#x27;s website, but after a few amusing &quot;chapters&quot; he was contacted by a publishing company to release it in book form.

In May 2006, The Unseen announced on their official website that they would begin writing their sixth full-length studio album during summer that year. The album, &quot;Internal Salvation&quot;, was released on July 10, 2007. The first song released from that album is titled &quot;Right Before Your Eyes&quot; and was followed up by the &quot;Break Away&quot;, for which the band made a music video. In support of the album, the band joined the thirteenth Warped Tour in 2007 and launched a US–Canada tour in March 2008.

The Unseen remained inactive, until May 25, 2013, when they played at Punk Rock Bowling at the Fremont Country Club in Las Vegas. They have continued performing live sporadically since.

<doc id="157680" wikidata="Q333884" url="?curid=157680" title="Bohemond II of Antioch">
<text>Bohemond II (1107/1108 – February 1130) was Prince of Taranto from 1111 to 1128 and Prince of Antioch from 1111/1119 to 1130. He was the son of Bohemond I, who in 1108 was forced to submit to the authority of the Byzantine Empire in the Treaty of Devol. Three years later, the infant Bohemond inherited the Principality of Taranto under the guardianship of his mother, Constance of France. The Principality of Antioch was administered by his father&#x27;s nephew, Tancred, until 1111. Tancred&#x27;s cousin, Roger of Salerno, managed the principality from 1111 to 1119. After Roger died in the Battle of the Field of Blood, Baldwin II of Jerusalem took over the administration of Antioch. However, he did acknowledge Bohemond&#x27;s right to personally rule the principality upon reaching the age of majority.

Bohemond came to Antioch in autumn 1126. He launched successful military campaigns against the nearby Muslim rulers, but his conflict with Joscelin I of Courtenay enabled Imad ad-Din Zengi to secure Mosul and Aleppo. Meanwhile, Roger II of Sicily occupied the Principality of Taranto in 1128. Bohemond died fighting against Danishmend Emir Gazi during a military campaign against Cilician Armenia, and Gümüshtigin sent Bohemond&#x27;s embalmed head to the Abbasid caliph.

== Early life ==

Bohemond II was the son of Prince Bohemond I of Taranto and Antioch and Constance of France. He was born in 1107 or 1108. In 1104, Bohemond I returned to Europe to seek military assistance against the Byzantine Empire and left his nephew Tancred in Syria to administer Antioch. Two charters show that Tancred styled himself prince of Antioch in 1108. In September of that year, Bohemond I was forced to sign the Treaty of Devol, which authorized the Byzantine Empire to annex Antioch upon his death.

Bohemond I died in Apulia in 1111. Bohemond II was still a minor, so his mother took charge of the government of Taranto. The Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos sent envoys to Tancred to demand control of Antioch, but Tancred refused to obey and continued to govern the principality. Tancred died in 1112 and bequeathed Antioch to his nephew, Roger of Salerno.

Roger&#x27;s legal status during his rule in Antioch is uncertain. According to William of Tyre, Tancred made Roger his successor &quot;with the understanding that, at the demand of Bohemond or his heirs, he should not refuse to return it,&quot; suggesting that Roger was simply regent for the child Bohemond. Roger adopted the title of prince, which implies that he regarded himself the ruler of Antioch in his own right. The contemporaneous Fulcher of Chartres accused Roger of depriving of &quot;his inheritance his own lord, the son of Bohemond [I], then living in Apulia with his mother.&quot; Charters issued in Bohemond&#x27;s Italian domains between 1117 and 1119 emphasized that he was the son of the prince of Antioch, but did not style him prince.

After Roger and most Antiochene noblemen perished in the Battle of the Field of Blood on 28 June 1119, King Baldwin II of Jerusalem hurried to Syria to save Antioch from Ilghazi, the Artuqid ruler of Mardin. The notables of Antioch proclaimed Baldwin ruler of Antioch, but they emphasized that Antioch was Bohemond&#x27;s &quot;rightful inheritance,&quot; according to Walter the Chancellor. Baldwin promised to cede Antioch to Bohemond if Bohemond came to the principality. Those who were present at the meeting agreed that Bohemond should marry Baldwin&#x27;s daughter, Alice. They also decreed that Bohemond would not be entitled to reclaim grants made during his absence from the principality.

Baldwin II was captured in 1123, and the burghers of Antioch sent envoys to Bohemond, urging him to come to his principality. Bohemond reached the age of majority at the age of 16. According to William of Tyre, he made an agreement with Duke William II of Apulia, stipulating that the one who first died without issue was to will his principality to the other; however, the reliability of William&#x27;s report is suspect. Alexander of Telese recorded that before leaving for Syria, Bohemond entrusted his Italian domains to the Holy See, but Romuald of Salerno said that he made Alexander, Count of Conversano, the overseer of those lands. Bohemond sailed from Otranto with a fleet of twenty-four ships in September 1126.

== Prince of Antioch ==

Bohemond landed at the port of St. Symeon in the Principality of Antioch in October or November. He went to Antioch to meet Baldwin II of Jerusalem, who subsequently ceded Antioch to him. Bohemond was officially installed as prince in Baldwin&#x27;s presence.

Matthew of Edessa portrayed Bohemond as &quot;a forceful character and great power.&quot; Badr ad-Daulah captured Kafartab shortly after Bohemond&#x27;s arrival, but Bohemond quickly recaptured the fortress in early 1127. According to historian Steven Runciman, Bohemond&#x27;s attack against the Munqidhites of Shaizar, which was recorded by Usama ibn Munqidh, also occurred during this period.

Bohemond came into conflict with Joscelin I of Edessa in 1127, although sources do not reveal the reason behind the enmity of the two Christian rulers. According to Runciman, Joscelin seized former Antiochene territories from Il-Bursuqi, governor of Mosul. Furthermore, Bohemond refused to cede Azaz to Joscelin, despite the fact that Roger of Salerno promised it to Joscelin as the dowry of his second wife, Maria of Salerno. Taking advantage of Bohemond&#x27;s absence due to a campaign, Joscelin invaded Antioch with the assistance of Turkish mercenaries, plundering the villages along the frontier.

Bernard of Valence, Latin Patriarch of Antioch, imposed an interdict on the County of Edessa. Baldwin II of Jerusalem hurried to Syria to mediate between Bohemond and Joscelin in early 1128. Joscelin, who had become seriously ill, agreed to restore the property to Bohemond and to do homage to him. However, the conflict between Bohemond and Joscelin enabled Imad ad-Din Zengi, Il-Bursuqi&#x27;s successor as governor of Mosul, to seize Aleppo without resistance on 28 June 1128.

Meanwhile, Bohemond&#x27;s cousin William II of Apulia had died without issue on 25 July 1127. Pope Honorius II tried to prevent Count Roger II of Sicily (the cousin of both William and Bohemond) from seizing Apulia, but Roger did not obey him. In May 1128, he invaded Bohemond&#x27;s Italian principality, capturing Taranto, Otranto and Brindisi without resistance. He completed the conquest of the whole principality around 15 June.

Taking advantage of the disputes between the Assassins and Taj al-Muluk Buri, atabeg of Damascus, Baldwin II of Jerusalem invaded Damascene territory and laid siege to Banias in November 1129. Bohemond and Joscelin joined Baldwin, but a heavy rainfall forced the crusaders to abandon the siege.

Bohemond decided to recover Anazarbus and other territories which had been lost to the Cilician Armenia. He invaded Cilicia in February 1130, traveling along the Ceyhan River. Leo I of Cilicia sought assistance from the Danishmend Emir Gazi who made a surprise attack on Bohemond&#x27;s army. Bohemond and his soldiers were massacred in the battle. According to Michael the Syrian, the Turks killed Bohemond because they did not recognize him; had they recognized him, they would have saved him so they could demand a ransom from him. Gümüshtigin had Bohemond&#x27;s head embalmed and sent to Al-Mustarshid, the Abbasid caliph.

== Family ==
Bohemond&#x27;s wife, Alice, was the second daughter of Baldwin II of Jerusalem and Morphia of Melitene. Their only child, Constance, was two when Bohemond died in 1130. Alice tried to secure the regency for Constance for herself, but the Antiochene noblemen preferred her father, Baldwin II of Jerusalem. After Bohemond&#x27;s death, Roger II of Sicily laid claim to Antioch, but he could never assert it against Constance.

<text>The Battle of Montereau (18 February 1814) was fought during the War of the Sixth Coalition between an Imperial French army led by Emperor Napoleon and a corps of Austrians and Württembergers commanded by Crown Prince Frederick William of Württemberg. While Napoleon&#x27;s army mauled an Allied army under Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, the main Allied army commanded by Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, advanced to a position dangerously close to Paris. Gathering up his outnumbered forces, Napoleon rushed his soldiers south to deal with Schwarzenberg. Hearing of the approach of the French emperor, the Allied commander ordered a withdrawal, but on 17 February saw his rear guards overrun or brushed aside.

Ordered to hold Montereau until nightfall on 18 February, the Crown Prince of Württemberg posted a strong force on the north bank of the Seine River. All morning and past noon, the Allies stoutly held off a series of French attacks. However, under increasing French pressure, the Crown Prince&#x27;s lines buckled in the afternoon and his troops ran for the single bridge to their rear. Brilliantly led by Pierre Claude Pajol, the French cavalry got among the fugitives, captured the spans over both the Seine and Yonne Rivers and seized Montereau. The Allied force suffered heavy losses, and the defeat confirmed Schwarzenberg&#x27;s decision to continue the retreat to Troyes.

==Background==

===Allied advance===
On 10 February, the Army of Bohemia under Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg began advancing from Troyes. On the right, Peter Wittgenstein and Karl Philipp von Wrede headed for Nogent-sur-Seine and Bray-sur-Seine on the Seine River supported by the Guards and Reserves. On the left, Crown Prince Frederick William of Württemberg moved on Sens with the I Corps of Frederick Bianchi, Duke of Casalanza on his left. The left flank forces were backed by Ignác Gyulay&#x27;s corps. The Allies were briefly checked at Nogent on 10 February by 1,000 French troops under Louis-Auguste-Victor, Count de Ghaisnes de Bourmont. Sens was taken on 11 February after a skirmish between the Crown Prince and Jacques-Alexandre-François Allix de Vaux.

Tasked with the defense of the Seine, Marshal Claude-Victor Perrin held Nogent and Marshal Nicolas Oudinot defended Montereau-Fault-Yonne. On 12 February the Allies captured Bray from a weak force of French National Guards as well as the bridge at Pont-sur-Seine near Montereau-Fault-Yonne. Afraid of being surrounded, Victor evacuated Nogent and fell back. The appearance of troops under Marshal Jacques MacDonald did not stop the retreat and by 15 February the French were moving back to the Yerres River only from Paris. Alexander Nikitich Seslavin led a scouting force of three Russian hussar squadrons and one Cossack regiment well to the south to seize Montargis and threaten Orléans. Auxerre was stormed and its garrison wiped out. Cossacks roamed freely in the Forest and Palace of Fontainebleau. When Victor&#x27;s wagon train appeared at Charenton-le-Pont the Parisians were thrown into panic. Meanwhile, fleeing peasants reported that Paris would soon be attacked by 200,000 Cossacks.

===French counteroffensive===
Following his successes in the Six Days&#x27; Campaign on 10–14 February 1814, Emperor Napoleon headed southward towards the Seine to stop Schwarzenberg&#x27;s threat to Paris. Forces under Marshals Édouard Mortier and Auguste Marmont were left behind to keep Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher&#x27;s Army of Silesia under observation. Giving up his plans to finish off Blücher, Napoleon left Montmirail on 15 February with the Imperial Guard and Emmanuel Grouchy&#x27;s cavalry. In an epic march, with some infantry traveling in carts and wagons, Napoleon&#x27;s leading forces reached Guignes at 3:00 pm on the 16th after moving in 36 hours. Another authority stated that some troops marched in 36 hours.

Hearing of Blücher&#x27;s defeat and the approach of Napoleon, the cautious Schwarzenberg scrambled to put the Seine between his army and the French emperor. On 17 February, he ordered Wittgenstein to retreat to Provins while Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly massed the Russian and Prussian Guards near Nogent. He instructed Wrede to fall back to Donnemarie while leaving an advanced guard at Nangis. Württemberg and Bianchi were posted near Montereau while Gyulai held Pont-sur-Yonne and the Austrian Reserve was at Sens. If the Army of Bohemia needed to retreat farther, it was important to hold the position at Montereau. Matvei Platov was to the west at Nemours where his 2,100 Cossacks captured 600 men of an Imperial Guard depot battalion on the 16th.

Early on 17 February, Napoleon&#x27;s leading elements under Etienne Maurice Gérard enveloped a Russian force led by Peter Petrovich Pahlen. In the Battle of Mormant, Pahlen&#x27;s 2,500 infantry and 1,250 cavalry were overwhelmed by the French, suffering 3,114 killed, wounded or captured. A nearby Austrian force led by Anton von Hardegg remained largely inert while its allies were being cut to pieces. Finally, Hardegg allowed 550 troopers from the Schwarzenberg Uhlan Regiment Nr. 2 to assist the Russians. The Reval and Selenginsk Infantry Regiments suffered such heavy losses that they were withdrawn from the campaign. Next, the French struck Wrede&#x27;s advance guard at Nangis and threw it back to Villeneuve-le-Comte.

At Nangis Napoleon split his army into three columns. The right column including Victor&#x27;s II Corps, Gerard&#x27;s Reserve of Paris and cavalry under Samuel-François Lhéritier and Étienne Tardif de Pommeroux de Bordesoulle took the road south toward Montereau. The center column consisted of MacDonald&#x27;s XI Corps, two cavalry divisions and the Imperial Guard. This force headed for Bray. The left column, made up of Oudinot&#x27;s VII Corps and François Étienne de Kellermann&#x27;s cavalry, pursued Wittgenstein east toward Provins. Pierre Claude Pajol&#x27;s cavalry and Michel-Marie Pacthod&#x27;s National Guards set out from Melun and advanced southeast toward Montereau. The divisions of Allix and Henri François Marie Charpentier moved south from Melun to Fontainebleau. MacDonald and Oudinot pressed Hardegg&#x27;s rear guard back, capturing some wagons. Victor came across one of Wrede&#x27;s divisions drawn up on the heights of Valjouan near Villeneuve. Victor sent Gérard to attack the Bavarians in front while Bordesoulle circled to take them from behind. Soon the Bavarians were retreating in disorder and Lhéritier missed a chance to deliver the &quot;coup de grace&quot; with his cavalry. Nevertheless, Wrede&#x27;s corps sustained 2,500 casualties during the day. Victor&#x27;s soldiers were exhausted, so he called a halt. Napoleon was furious that Victor disobeyed his orders to press on to Montereau during the night and asked his chief of staff Louis-Alexandre Berthier to write him a harsh reprimand.

===Forces===
The Crown Prince&#x27;s IV Corps consisted of an infantry division led by Christian Johann Gottgetreu von Koch and a cavalry division under Prince Adam von Württemberg. Ludwig Stockmeyer&#x27;s brigade consisted of two battalions of King Frederick Jäger Regiment Nr. 9 and one battalion of Light Infantry Regiment Nr. 10. Christoph Friedrich David Döring&#x27;s brigade was made up of two battalions each of Infantry Regiments Duke Wilhelm Nr. 2, Nr. 3 and Nr. 7. Prince Karl von Hohenlohe-Kirchberg&#x27;s brigade included two battalions each of Infantry Regiments Nr. 4 and Crown Prince Nr. 6. Walsleben&#x27;s cavalry brigade comprised four squadrons each of Duke Louis Jäger zu Pferde Regiment Nr. 2 and Crown Prince Dragoon Regiment Nr. 3. Karl August Maximillian Jett&#x27;s cavalry brigade had four squadrons of Prince Adam Jäger zu Pferde Regiment Nr. 4. Attached to each cavalry brigade was one horse artillery battery while Döring&#x27;s and Hohenlohe&#x27;s brigades each had a foot artillery battery. All four batteries were armed with four 6-pound cannons and two howitzers.

Attached to the IV Corps was Joseph Schäffer&#x27;s Austrian brigade. This unit consisted of two battalions each of Infantry Regiments Gyulai Nr. 21, Esterhazy Nr. 32 and Josef Colloredo Nr. 57, three battalions of Infantry Regiment Zach Nr. 15, six squadrons of Archduke Ferdinand Hussar Regiment Nr. 3 and two-foot artillery batteries. Altogether there were 11,000 Württembergers and 4,000 Austrians present. A second source credited the Allies with 18,000 troops in Montereau.

Victor&#x27;s II Corps had the divisions of Louis Huguet-Chateau and Guillaume Philibert Duhesme. Chateau&#x27;s 1st Division was made up of 1st Battalions of the 11th and 24th Light and the 2nd, 19th, 37th and 56th Line Infantry Regiments. Duhesme&#x27;s 2nd Division included 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 4th, 18th and 46th Line and 1st Battalions of the 72nd and 93rd Line and 26th Light. Chateau&#x27;s division numbered only 1,536 officers and men, since all units except the 477-strong 19th were sadly understrength, while Duhesme had 2,442 effectives. The 1st Division was supported by five 6-pound cannons and one howitzer while the 2nd Division counted eight 6-pound cannons and four howitzers. With 475 gunners and 135 sappers, Victor&#x27;s total strength was 4,588 soldiers. Gérard&#x27;s Reserve of Paris included the divisions of Georges Joseph Dufour and Jacques Félix Jan de La Hamelinaye. The 1st Division was made up of one battalion each of the 5th, 12th, 15th and 29th Light and the 32nd, 58th and 135th Line. The 2nd Division comprised the 26th, 82nd, 86th, 121st, 122nd and 142nd Line. Gérard&#x27;s force had 214 artillerists from three companies attached.

Pajol led a provisional cavalry corps consisting of three small brigades, 460 Chasseurs à Cheval under Jacques-Antoine-Adrien Delort, 476 Dragoons under François Grouvel and 400 Hussars under Charles Yves César Du Coetlosquet. Pacthod commanded 3,000 National Guards and there were 800 gendarmes (military police) with this column. MacDonald&#x27;s XI Corps counted three divisions led by Joseph Jean Baptiste Albert, François Pierre Joseph Amey and Michel Sylvestre Brayer. Lhéritier commanded the V Cavalry Corps which was formed from three mounted divisions. Hippolyte Piré&#x27;s 3rd Light Cavalry Division included the 14th, 26th and 27th Chasseurs à Cheval and the 3rd Hussars, André Louis Briche&#x27;s 3rd Heavy Cavalry Division the 2nd, 6th, 11th, 13th and 15th Dragoons and Lhéritier&#x27;s 4th Cavalry Division the 18th, 19th, 20th, 22nd and 25th Dragoons. Bordesoulle&#x27;s detachment numbered 500 horsemen from depot squadrons.

The Imperial Guard consisted of the Old Guard Division of Louis Friant, the 1st Young Guard Division of Claude Marie Meunier, the 2nd Young Guard Division of Philibert Jean-Baptiste Curial, and the 2nd and 3rd Guard Cavalry Divisions. Marshal Michel Ney led the two Young Guard divisions while Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty led the Guard cavalry divisions. The 2nd Guard Cavalry was made up of the 1st Polish Guard Lancer, Empress Dragoon and Polish and 3rd Éclaireur Regiments. The 3rd Guard Cavalry Division had the Guard Horse Grenadier and Guard Chasseurs à Cheval Regiments. According to one authority, units that fought in the battle included most of the regiments from the corps of Victor and Gérard, the Guard artillery, Guard Chasseurs à Cheval and 2nd Guard Lancers, 3rd Hussars from Jacques Gervais, baron Subervie&#x27;s brigade, 18th Dragoons of Auguste Lamotte&#x27;s brigade, 25th Dragoons from Jean Antoine de Collaert&#x27;s brigade, 9th Lancers and 22nd Chasseurs à Cheval from Kellermann&#x27;s VI Cavalry Corps and the 7th Lancers, 9th Chasseurs à Cheval and 7th Hussars from unidentified corps. MacDonald&#x27;s corps and the Guard infantry were not engaged.

===Action===
After issuing conflicting orders concerning the defense of Montereau, Schwarzenberg finally directed the Crown Prince to hold the town until the evening of 18 February. Meanwhile, Oudinot&#x27;s leading troops found that Wittgenstein had withdrawn across the Seine at Nogent while Wrede was across at Bray. At both places, the Allies broke the bridges. While Montereau on the south bank is in flat terrain, the north bank is crowned by a height with a steep slope next to the river and a gentler slope on the north side. Atop the ridge, Surville chateau overlooks the bridges and town of Montereau, which was surrounded by vineyards and meadows to the south and east. The Paris road approached Montereau from the northwest where there was a forest. The road from Salins came from the northeast and ran alongside the river from Courbeton chateau to the bridge. The hamlet of Les Ormeaux was a short distance east of the Paris road. The roads from the north join at the bridge which crosses the Seine to the eastern suburb, then immediately crosses the Yonne into Montereau. The Seine bridge was the site of the Assassination of John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy in 1419.

The Crown Prince deployed 8,500-foot soldiers, 1,000 horsemen and 26 field guns on the north bank of the Seine. A second authority counted 12,000 defenders. The left flank was anchored in Les Ormeaux, the center incorporated the Surville chateau and park while the right flank included the Courbeton chateau and blocked the road from Salins. Two Austrian batteries from Bianchi&#x27;s corps were positioned on the south bank, one covering each flank. There was also a IV Corps brigade on the south bank near the eastern suburb at the Motteux Farm. Schäffer&#x27;s Austrians held the Surville park in the center. The Allies were supported by a total of 40 field pieces.

Napoleon ordered Victor to be at Montereau at 6:00 am but the first French forces to arrive were Pajol&#x27;s cavalry and Pacthod&#x27;s National Guards at 8:00 am. Aside from numbering no more than 4,500 men, the horsemen had almost no training while the National Guards were ill-equipped and ill-trained. They made no impression on the Crown Prince&#x27;s defenders. Victor leading elements arrived at 9:00 am and their initial attack was repulsed. When the divisions of Chateau and Duhesme reached the field they were thrown into an attack on Les Ormeaux. This was beaten back and Chateau, who was Victor&#x27;s son-in-law, was fatally wounded. The Württemberg cavalry charged and drove the French horsemen back into the forest. Unable to make any progress by 11:00 am, Victor awaited the coming of Gérard&#x27;s corps. Angry at the marshal&#x27;s slowness, Napoleon replaced Victor and placed command of the II Corps in Gérard&#x27;s hands.
Gérard led his troops up the heights but the Allied artillery was well-served and threw back assault after assault. In the afternoon, the Imperial Guard artillery arrived and 40 more guns were brought into action. At 3:00 pm, Napoleon hurled three attack columns at Les Ormeaux and Surville and another one against the Allied right flank along the Seine. While the Guard remained in reserve, the French artillery unleashed a barrage at Surville chateau. The French finally overran Les Ormeaux, causing the Crown Prince to order Schäffer&#x27;s Austrians to cover the retreat. As the Württembergers began pulling back, Pajol launched a cavalry charge down the Paris highway against the Allied left flank. At this time, French infantry rushed the Surville chateau and made its garrison prisoners. There were now 30,000 French troops on the field supported by 70 or 80 field pieces.

At first the withdrawal was conducted in good order, but the Allied soldiers became more disorganized as they tried to negotiate the steep slope. They fell into complete confusion upon encountering a sunken road. Soon, every Allied soldier was running for the Seine bridge. The Crown Prince tried to rally his men and was nearly captured by the French cavalry. The French emperor ordered 60 guns onto the Surville heights where they unlimbered and fired their missiles into the fleeing mob of Allies crowding the bridges. When Napoleon personally sighted one of the cannons, his guardsmen begged him to leave. He refused saying, &quot;Courage my friends, the bullet which is to kill me is not yet cast&quot;.
Pajol&#x27;s horsemen charged into the fleeing mass of soldiers and managed to seize first the Seine bridge and then the Yonne bridge before either could be blown up, though they were rigged for demolition. Duhesme&#x27;s division rapidly crossed after the cavalry and helped clear Montereau of the Allies. The beaten Allies joined Hohenlohe&#x27;s brigade and began a disorderly retreat toward Le Tombe, a village on the road to Bray. The movement was covered by Jett&#x27;s cavalry brigade. Napoleon sent Marshal François Joseph Lefebvre and his own cavalry escort in pursuit toward Bray. An eyewitness wrote that Lefebvre foamed at the mouth and struck at Allied soldiers with his saber.

== Results ==
According to Digby Smith, the Allies had losses of 1,400 killed and wounded, of which the Württembergers lost 92 killed and 714 wounded; Prince Hohenlohe was killed. The French captured 3,600 men, two cannons and two ammunition wagons. Of these totals, the Austrians had about 2,000 casualties and Schäffer became a French prisoner. The French lost 2,000 killed and wounded. A source quoted by Smith gave 4,895 Allied casualties and 15 guns lost. Francis Loraine Petre asserted that the Allies lost nearly 5,000 men and 15 field pieces. David G. Chandler stated that the Allies suffered 6,000 casualties and lost 15 cannons; the French lost 2,500 casualties. Another authority wrote that both the French and Allies lost 3,000 killed and wounded, while the French took 2,000 men, six guns and four colors. Chateau died from his wounds on 8 May 1814.

The victory failed to live up to Napoleon&#x27;s expectations. He lamented, &quot;The foe has enjoyed a stroke of rare good fortune, the heavy frosts permitted him to move over the fields – otherwise at least half his guns and transport would have been taken.&quot; In his disappointment he turned on his generals. After the battle when Victor complained to the emperor about losing his command, Napoleon unleashed a storm of abuse on his hapless subordinate. He also raged against Victor&#x27;s wife whom he accused of snubbing Empress Marie Louise. Victor managed to blunt his sovereign&#x27;s fury by recalling their military exploits in Italy and by reminding Napoleon that his son-in-law Chateau lay dying. Finally, Napoleon relented and gave him the two Young Guard divisions of Charpentier and Joseph Boyer de Rebeval. Other generals who felt Napoleon&#x27;s wrath at this time were Lhéritier for failing to charge at Valjouan, Jean François Aimé Dejean for not providing enough artillery ammunition and Claude-Étienne Guyot for losing some cannons.

Even before the battle started, Schwarzenberg ordered a general withdrawal to Troyes. He ordered Wrede to hold Bray until nightfall on 19 February and sent a dispatch to Blücher asking him to support his right flank at Méry-sur-Seine on 21 February. The Prussian replied that he would be at the rendezvous with 53,000 troops and 300 guns. With Montereau in French hands, the position of the Austrians on the left flank along the Loing River became precarious. Under the guise of negotiations with Allix, they retreated to join the wreckage of Schäffer&#x27;s brigade at Saint-Sérotin. Seslavin was ordered to relinquish his far left flank position and take a position on the opposite flank. Napoleon&#x27;s pursuit was hampered by a lack of bridges and the Allies got a two-day head start in the march to Troyes. The next series of actions between the two armies started at Méry-sur-Seine on 22 February and led to the Battle of Bar-sur-Aube.

== Battlefield today ==
Currently, part of this historic battle site near the village of Montereau-Fault-Yonne has been proposed for development as a theme park celebrating the life of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. The park, Napoleonland, was originally set for completion in 2017.

<doc id="157683" wikidata="Q574663" url="?curid=157683" title="Anti-Flag">
<text>Anti-Flag was an American punk rock band formed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1988. The band was known for its left-wing political activism. For the majority of the band&#x27;s career, their members included Justin Sane (vocals and guitar), Chris Head (guitar), Pat Thetic (drums), and Chris Barker, also known as Chris No. 2 (vocals and bass). 

Gaining popularity through the punk underground, Anti-Flag controversially signed to RCA Records and released their major label debut &quot;For Blood and Empire&quot; in 2006. It contained singles such as &quot;The Press Corpse&quot; (which was the band&#x27;s only appearance on the US Alternative Airplay chart) and &quot;This is the End (For You My Friend)&quot;, which featured in multiple video games. 

The band remained active past their commercial peak, releasing a total of thirteen albums, the last of which came out months before their disbandment. The band also operated their own record label, A-F Records.

Anti-Flag suddenly broke up in July 2023 amidst several rape and sexual assault allegations made against Sane. The other members directly condemned him and disbanded. In March 2024, Sarhadi&#x27;s legal team learned that Sane had sold his Pittsburgh home and transferred funds to a bank account in Ireland, where he holds dual citizenship. They later claimed that Sane had successfully fled the United States, although they could not confirm the country to which Sane moved.

==History==
===Early years (1988, 1992–1996)===
Anti-Flag was originally formed in 1988 by Justin Sane and Pat Thetic. Various guitarists and bassists joined and left the band during the band&#x27;s early years, including Sane&#x27;s sister, Lucy Fester, who was formerly part of the Chicago band Toothpaste. The band failed to solidify and disbanded after performing in just one show.
In 1992, Sane and Thetic reformed the band with Andy Flag as their bassist. A 17-song demo album called &quot;17 Songs&quot; was released the same year.

===First three albums (1996–1999)===
In 1996, Anti-Flag released their first album, &quot;Die For the Government&quot;, on New Red Archives. Andy Flag left the band in mid-1996 because of personal disputes with Justin. After Andy&#x27;s departure in 1996, Sean Whelan from the Pittsburgh band the Bad Genes briefly filled in as their bassist. During this time, Sean was also playing in another band (57 Defective) with Pittsburgh guitarist Chris Head, whom he introduced to Anti-Flag.

In early 1997, Chris Head began filling in on bass. In late 1997, Jamie Cock took over as the new bassist, giving Chris Head his preferred role as the second guitar. The band&#x27;s current lineup was finalized in 1999 when Chris Barker, also known as Chris No. 2, replaced Jamie Cock on bass.

In 1998, Anti-Flag released their second full-length album, &quot;Their System Doesn&#x27;t Work for You&quot;. The album contained all nine Anti-Flag songs from the 1996 Anti-Flag/d.b.s. split album &quot;North America Sucks&quot;, as well as 10 new unreleased songs. The band decided to release the album independently, and &quot;Their System Doesn&#x27;t Work for You&quot; became the debut release for the band&#x27;s own A-F Records.

In 1999, Anti-Flag released the album &quot;A New Kind of Army&quot; on Go-Kart Records/A-F Records. The album addressed topics such as abortion, political corruption, racism, fascism, troubled youth, police brutality, and unity amongst American youths. The cover art page unfolded into a poster featuring the phrase, &quot;Too smart to fight. Too smart to kill. Join now. A new kind of army.&quot; In addition, the band had a disclaimer at the bottom of its album cover, which said, &quot;Anti-Flag does not mean Anti-American. Anti-Flag means anti-war. Anti-Flag means unity.&quot;

===Fat Wreck Chords (2000–2004)===
In 2000, Anti-Flag was invited to participate in Vans Warped Tour. During this time, the members of Anti-Flag met NOFX&#x27;s Fat Mike, owner of the Fat Wreck Chords record label. This meeting built a friendship between them that would lead to Anti-Flag releasing two albums under Fat Wreck Chords.
In 2001, Anti-Flag teamed up with punk music producer Mass Giorgini to record the album &quot;Underground Network&quot; on Fat Wreck Chords. The album&#x27;s release is arguably the moment Anti-Flag emerged from the hardcore underground into more of a mainstream spotlight. The album addressed the topics of fascism (specifically neo-Nazis infiltrating the &quot;hardcore scene&quot;) and the foreign policy of the United States. The album was the first of theirs to contain the now-commonplace booklet filled with essays from historians and political commentators, most notably Professor Howard Zinn.

In February 2002, Anti-Flag released the album &quot;Mobilize&quot; on A-F Records. The album featured eight new studio tracks, as well as eight live tracks of songs from other albums. In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States, Anti-Flag spoke out against the push for war with the album&#x27;s title track, &quot;911 for Peace&quot;. During this time, many music stores took Anti-Flag&#x27;s records off their shelves, as their music was labeled as &quot;anti-American.&quot;
In 2003, Anti-Flag released the album &quot;The Terror State&quot; on Fat Wreck Chords, which primarily focused on criticizing the Bush Administration&#x27;s actions regarding the War on Terrorism. As before, a booklet filled with essays by the band and other political commentators was included in the album. The album also contained a song called &quot;Post-War Breakout,&quot; whose lyrics were originally written by Woody Guthrie. The track&#x27;s music was arranged by the members of Anti-Flag, as Guthrie had never committed the arrangements to paper.
On October 8, 2004, U.S. Representative Jim McDermott gave a speech in the House of Representatives, commending Anti-Flag for their work in encouraging young people to register and vote.

===RCA (2005–2009)===
In 2005, Anti-Flag signed a two-album record contract with the major label RCA. In an interview with British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Justin Sane explained the band&#x27;s move to a major label:

The first of these two albums, &quot;For Blood and Empire&quot;, was released on March 21, 2006. The album&#x27;s main focus is criticism of the U.S. government&#x27;s mishandling of the War on Terrorism. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;This Is The End (For You My Friend),&quot; is featured in the video game Madden NFL 07 and NHL 07. This single strays from the theme of war and instead focuses on troubled youth. They finished their &quot;War Sucks, Let&#x27;s Party&quot; United States headlining tour in April and worked on some side projects such as the African Well Fund and Start to Finish MS Now.

Throughout Anti-Flag&#x27;s career, numerous other bands have been added to the roster of the band&#x27;s own label, A-F Records. These bands include The Code, Pipedown, Much the Same, The Vacancy, The Unseen, Modey Lemon, Thought Riot, Tabula Rasa, and many others.

On November 25, Anti-Flag revealed that their latest album was called &quot;The Bright Lights of America&quot;. The album was produced by Tony Visconti and was released on April 1, 2008. The album&#x27;s title single was released exclusively on iTunes on February 12, 2008. A video of the song was released some weeks later.

In 2008, while on tour with Canadian band Billy Talent in Europe, Justin Sane and Chris No. 2 joined Billy Talent singer Ben Kowalewicz and guitarist Ian D&#x27;Sa, singing their new song &quot;Turn Your Back&quot; from their upcoming unreleased album. The two also play on the single version of the song.

In March 2009, Anti-Flag was forced to cancel a series of tours after Sane broke his collarbone at the UEA LCR in Norwich by jumping off the stage, trying to stop someone that was throwing objects at the band.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer breaks collarbone in stage dive, Norwich Evening News, 7/3/09&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===SideOneDummy (2009–2014)===
On September 30, 2008, Chris No. 2 started posting on his blog that the band had begun to work on their seventh studio album. On December 2, Anti-Flag began recording the album, starting with &quot;The Economy is Suffering... Let It Die&quot;.

On March 31, 2009, Anti-Flag announced that their next CD, &quot;The People or the Gun&quot;, would be released on SideOneDummy on June 9, 2009. The band recorded the album in a home studio they built themselves. The first track of the album &quot;Sodom, Gomorrah, and Washington DC (Sheep in Shepherd&#x27;s Clothing)&quot; could be listened to on Anti-Flag&#x27;s website. On May 1, 2009, the band performed a full set of The Clash covers at Hoodwink in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

In September 2009, Anti-Flag planned to play a show during a G-20 protest that was taking place in their hometown. However, the show was cancelled by the promoter due to severe parking restrictions and police presence near the venue. Even so, the band continued to personally take part in the protests.

In November 2009, Anti-Flag showed their support to the protesting students in Vienna, Austria by giving a speech at the main building of the University of Vienna. They also had one of the student representatives speak at their two shows in Vienna.

In January 2010, Anti-Flag completed a full US tour supported by Aiden and Cancer Bats, with various bands filling another supporting slot and local bands opening as many of the shows as possible. The tour was sponsored by Amnesty International, peta2, Greenpeace, and Innes Clothing. The band followed the US tour with an Australian tour, playing the Soundwave Festival dates in February 2010, with bands such as AFI, Paramore, Escape the Fate, A Day to Remember, and HIM. They also played two headlining dates supported by Alexisonfire and Comeback Kid.

Throughout mid-2010, Anti-Flag played in various festivals such as Ruisrock and Woodstock en Beauce. They also played the last few dates of the Vans Warped Tour. In September 2010, the band headlined a Canadian tour with support from the Menzingers. This tour was followed by the European Vans Off the Wall Music Tour in October, with supporting acts by The Swellers and Pulled Apart by Horses.

In March–April 2011, Anti-flag made a live comeback by headlining a South American tour with This Is a Standoff, and supporting My Chemical Romance in the U.S. In May–June 2011, the band returned to Europe to play in the Slam Dunk Festival, and play supporting System of a Down in Milan, Italy.

On June 21, 2011, Justin Sane announced that Anti-Flag was working on material for a new album, which was planned to be released later in the year. The album had the working title of &quot;Magnum&quot;. Sane also announced plans to record a new solo album in the future, as he had also been working on some folk-oriented solo material.

On March 20, 2012, Anti-Flag released an album called &quot;The General Strike&quot;, which was recorded and produced by the band at their home studio. The band also intended to go on The General Strike Record Release Tour with The Flatliners and the Have Nots. They released a lyric video for the song &quot;1915&quot; which talked about Joe Hill.

In June 2014, Anti-Flag announced that they were going to release a new album called &quot;A Document of Dissent: 1993-2013&quot;. The album was a compilation of their releases from 1993 to 2013, and was planned to be released on Fat Wreck Chords, which was the band&#x27;s first release with the label since &quot;The Terror State&quot; in 2003. The album was released on July 21, 2014.

===Spinefarm and Beyond Barricades documentary (2015–2023)===
On January 16, 2015, Anti-Flag announced they would release their ninth studio album called &quot;American Spring&quot; on the label Spinefarm Records. The album was released on May 26, 2015. Later in the year, Anti-Flag released a compilation album called &quot;Cease Fires&quot; which contains two previously unreleased songs from their &quot;American Spring&quot; recording sessions and twelve songs from their &quot;20 Years of Hell&quot; EP series. It was released on December 18, 2015. In an interview in 2016, Chris No. 2 revealed that he doesn&#x27;t read books. On August 14, 2017, in reaction to the events of the 2017 Unite the Right rally, the band released a song titled &quot;Racists&quot; to the Spinefarm Records YouTube channel. On August 18, 2017, the band announced that a new album titled &quot;American Fall&quot; would be released on Spinefarm Records on November 3, 2017, by premiering a song from the album titled &quot;American Attraction&quot; on Anti-Flag&#x27;s YouTube channel.

In early 2018, Anti-Flag toured with Stray from the Path, The White Noise and Sharptooth.

From July until September 2018, Anti-Flag played with AFI and Rise Against in the &quot;Mourning in Amerika&quot; Tour.

On October 4, 2019, Anti-Flag released their song &quot;Christian Nationalist&quot; alongside an announcement of a European tour the following year. On the band&#x27;s website, the song&#x27;s meaning was explained by a quote from Justin:

The website also provided a list of Republican politicians, along with sources indicating that the politicians had accepted large donations from the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) and other gun lobbyists for the politician&#x27;s support for certain policies and actions, along with a list of mass shooting incidents.

Later that same month, Anti-Flag announced their twelfth studio album, &quot;20/20 Vision&quot;, alongside the release of the song &quot;Hate Conquers All&quot; and the song&#x27;s music video. Additional songs &quot;Unbreakable&quot; and &quot;The Disease&quot; were also released ahead of the album, which released on January 17, 2020. Many of the songs on the album directly discuss the band&#x27;s opposition of former president, Donald Trump, which in the past, the band has avoided directly naming presidents. Justin revealed that this was done because the band believed that “Donald Trump IS the problem, so we have to go directly at the problem. You could say he’s a symptom of a larger problem and I believe that’s true, but he IS the symptom.&quot; In support of the album, Anti-Flag embarked on a world tour with dates throughout 2020. However, many of these dates were delayed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Before the tour resumed, a digital-only deluxe version of the album was released under the new name, &quot;20/20 Division&quot;.

That same year, a documentary released called &quot;Beyond Barricades: The Story of Anti-Flag&quot;. The documentary chronicles the band over their years of touring, writing music, and activism, and features interviews from other musicians from bands such as Rage Against The Machine, Rise Against, Bad Religion, and The Menzingers.

With the pandemic putting the band&#x27;s touring on hold for a long period of time, Anti-Flag was able to spend much more time than usual writing new music. Upon finishing touring for &quot;20/20 Vision&quot;, Anti-Flag returned to the studio to record their next album. The band took a different approach than usual during recording by not only writing a concept album, but bringing in guest musicians for multiple tracks. The band officially announced their final album &quot;Lies They Tell Our Children&quot; on July 29, 2022, alongside the release of the single &quot;Laugh. Cry. Smile. Die.&quot; featuring Silverstein vocalist Shane Told. A music video was also released for the song, which depicts an individual spray painting the walls of an abandoned school with various messages that the band deemed as lies. The album was released on January 6, 2023, coinciding with the second anniversary of the Capitol attack.

===Breakup (2023)===
On July 19, 2023, the band posted an update on their Patreon announcing their disbandment and the intention to refund fans who were subscribed. Following this announcement, their website was taken down, and the band&#x27;s social media accounts were deleted. The band was on tour in Europe at the time of their disbandment, due to support Dropkick Murphys at a show in Prague on July 21; the band also planned to tour in North America alongside The Bouncing Souls in fall 2023. When asked to offer a statement regarding the breakup, the band&#x27;s publicist declined to comment. &quot;Stereogum&quot; and &quot;Us Weekly&quot; linked Anti-Flag&#x27;s July 2023 breakup to a podcast episode released on July 19, the same day as the band&#x27;s dissolution, that leveled possible accusations of sexual assault against &quot;a singer in a political punk band&quot; believed to be frontman Justin Sane.

On July 26, Sane released a statement through his personal Instagram account denying the accusations and calling them &quot;categorically false&quot;; in his statement, Sane also explained the length of time before he made a statement, stating that he needed time to &quot;absorb the initial shock.&quot; Meanwhile, Thetic, Head, and Barker released a statement expressing their shock and sadness upon hearing the allegations, starting with, &quot;A core tenet of the band Anti-Flag is to listen to and believe all survivors of sexual violence and abuse. The recent allegations about Justin are in direct contradiction to that tenet. Therefore, we felt the only immediate option was to disband.&quot; Their statement ended with, &quot;It was a privilege for us to be in the band Anti-Flag. As we seek to find our path forward we wish healing to all survivors.&quot; Following an exposé published by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in September – revealing twelve additional women and girls who accused Sane of sexual misconduct, &quot;serious sexual assaults&quot;, grooming and rape – Thetic, Head, and Barker released a second statement directly condemning Sane, stating they believed he was &quot;in need of serious professional help&quot; and that &quot;it appears you used our beliefs as a cover for egregious activities that you clearly knew we would never condone.&quot;

In November 2023, the original accuser from the July podcast episode sued Sane for sexual assault under the New York Adult Survivors Act. In an amendment to her initial complaint in March 2024, the accuser questioned the rest of the band members&#x27; insistence that they were unaware of Sane&#x27;s actions, accusing Thetic, Head, and Barker of being &quot;aware of [Sane]&#x27;s practice of sexually assaulting young women and girls,&quot; and claiming that the band&#x27;s self-owned distribution company, Hardwork Distribution, &quot;aided and abetted such behavior.&quot; The accuser also stated that &quot;the band was approached about [Sane]&#x27;s predatory behavior at least 25 years ago and did nothing to stop him. They chose their business prospects over the welfare of their fans. For decades, these men financially and socially benefited from [Sane]&#x27;s predation while pretending not to see it.&quot; The accuser also claimed the band unsuccessfully attempted to &quot;coax [her] forgiveness through a restorative justice process&quot;. At least three of the girls and women who spoke to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; for the September 2023 exposé also claimed that Thetic, Head, and Barker were present when Sane brought teenage girls and young women backstage and on the band&#x27;s tour bus. In March 2024, the accuser&#x27;s legal team stated that they believed Sane had approximately 60 victims and that one witness who came forward and had their testimony included in the accuser&#x27;s lawsuit claimed that at a 2002 album release party in Pittsburgh, they witnessed &quot;the members of Anti-Flag [mingling] outside the venue with clearly underage girls&quot; who appeared &quot;to be between 14 and 15 years old,&quot; and that Sane and other band members were &quot;hugging and inappropriately kissing them.&quot;

Within days of Anti-Flag&#x27;s breakup, several bands announced their departure from the band&#x27;s record label A-F Records, including Celebration Summer, Darien Gap, Hanalei, Reconciler, Sammy Kay, and Wolves &amp; Wolves &amp; Wolves &amp; Wolves. The band American Television also announced they would find another way to distribute their upcoming album without the aid of Anti-Flag or the band&#x27;s record label. In September 2023, members of Anti-Flag informed that they were &quot;in the process of unwinding the label, including returning master rights and physical records/merchandise to the bands,&quot; although they stated this would &quot;take some time to complete properly.&quot;

==Name and criticism==
Anti-Flag explained the band name on the artwork for their 1999 release &quot;A New Kind of Army&quot;, saying, &quot;Anti-Flag does not mean Anti-American. Anti-Flag means anti-war. Anti-Flag means the common people of the world are better off living in unity and peace. Anti-Flag means to stand against corporate greed that hurts millions while benefiting a handful of extremely rich. Anti-Flag means to fight against mindless nationalism. Anti-Flag means unity.&quot;

Anti-Flag&#x27;s anti-capitalism stance drew criticism towards them when they started working with RCA Records in 2005, with some saying that the band was selling out. Anti-Flag defended themselves against the criticism by saying that the purpose of signing to the record label was to bring their message to more people.

==Studio projects==
Chris No. 2 and Chris Head work together in another band called White Wives. They released the &quot;Situationists&quot; EP on February 15, 2011, and the album &quot;Happeners&quot; on June 28, 2011. The band and its name were based on the Provo movement and The White Plans.

Wharf Rats, a musical partnership between Chris No. 2, Wade MacNeil, and P.O.S, was created on Warped Tour and recorded in the festival&#x27;s traveling recording studio. They created two songs together, namely &quot;Oh No!&quot; and &quot;Capital Gains&quot;. The two songs were pressed on a limited edition 7-inch single and released on May 31 on No Sleep Records.

==ANTIfest==
ANTIfest was Anti-Flag&#x27;s own hosted festival. It originally took place on May 3, 2012, at The Forum at the University of Hertfordshire. ANTIfest was the first self-established festival hosted by the band, who wanted to make it an annual event. The band personally selected all of the bands that appeared, including other punk bands such as The Bouncing Souls, The Menzingers, Red City Radio, The Computers, and The Skints. Volunteers from certain organizations also took part in the festival, including people from Amnesty International, PETA, and Emmaus.

ANTIFest also took place on July 14, 2013, at Backstage Werk in Munich with support from ZSK, Strike Anywhere, The Computers, and Apologies, I Have None.

==Activism==
Anti-Flag was involved with political activism throughout their musical career. They created many activism groups, which include The Underground Action Alliance, Military Free Zone (created to protest a clause in the No Child Left Behind Act, which gave military recruiters access to students&#x27; personal information), and The Bright Lights.

All members of Anti-Flag were vegan, and were adamant supporters of animal rights. They were frequently featured by PETA, and also appeared on the Fat Wreck Chords compilation album .

The band performed at multiple protests, including two in support of Rage Against the Machine.

They performed outside the Republican National Convention in 2008. Anti-Flag wasn&#x27;t supposed to be the last band to perform at the event, but officials found out that Rage Against the Machine was going to perform after them, so they shut down the stage&#x27;s power and Rage Against the Machine performed two songs using megaphones instead.

Anti-Flag played an acoustic set at the Occupy Wall Street protest in New York City on October 8, 2011.

They regularly supported organizations which include:
* Democracy Now!, whose headlines they showcase on the band&#x27;s homepage.
* PETA, who was one of the sponsors of their 2010 &#x27;The Economy Sucks Let&#x27;s Party&#x27; tour.
* Amnesty International, who was one of the sponsors of their 2010 &#x27;The Economy Sucks Let&#x27;s Party&#x27; tour. Anti-Flag once donated money to them from the sales of &quot;The People and the Gun&quot;. 
* Greenpeace, who was one of the sponsors of their &#x27;The Economy Sucks Let&#x27;s Party&#x27; tour. Anti-Flag once collaborated with them to persuade world leaders to attend the climate conference in Copenhagen.
* Useless, who they collaborated with by selling screen-printed limited-edition T-shirts to raise money for The Kandorwahun project, and by spreading awareness of the organization.

Anti-Flag showed their disapproval of fracking in October 2013, supporting the Clean Water Mob.

Anti-Flag&#x27;s song &quot;Die for Your Government&quot; was sung by anti-war protesters who briefly barricaded a road to prevent U.S. troops from deploying to Iraq in August 2010.

They appeared in the 2010 music documentary &quot;Sounds Like A Revolution&quot;, which talks about new protest music in the United States.

==Symbol==
Anti-Flag&#x27;s logo is the &quot;Gun Star&quot;, which was designed by Chris Head. It was first used on the cover of the album &quot;Mobilize&quot;. It was later used on the band&#x27;s merchandise. The logo is made up of five broken M16 rifles in the shape of a star. The band often used the O &amp; X superposed symbols on the &quot;Die for the Government&quot; LP.

<text>The Battle of Montmirail (11 February 1814) was fought between a French force led by Emperor Napoleon and two Allied corps commanded by Fabian Wilhelm von Osten-Sacken and Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg. In hard fighting that lasted until evening, French troops including the Imperial Guard defeated Sacken&#x27;s Russian soldiers and compelled them to retreat to the north. Part of Yorck&#x27;s Prussian I Corps tried to intervene in the struggle but it was also driven off. The battle occurred near Montmirail, France, during the Six Days Campaign of the Napoleonic Wars. Montmirail is located east of Meaux.

After Napoleon crushed Zakhar Dmitrievich Olsufiev&#x27;s small isolated corps in the Battle of Champaubert on 10 February, he found himself in the midst of Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher&#x27;s widely-spread Army of Silesia. Leaving a small force in the east to watch Blücher, Napoleon turned the bulk of his army to the west in an attempt to destroy Sacken. Unaware of the size of Napoleon&#x27;s army, Sacken tried to smash his way east to join Blücher. The Russians managed to hold their ground for several hours, but were forced back as more and more French soldiers appeared on the battlefield. Yorck&#x27;s troops belatedly arrived only to be repulsed, but the Prussians distracted the French long enough to allow Sacken&#x27;s Russians to join them in a withdrawal to the north. The following day would see the Battle of Château-Thierry as Napoleon launched an all-out pursuit.

==Background==

On the 1st of February 1814, Prussian Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher commanding 80,000 Allied soldiers from his own Army of Silesia and Austrian field marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg&#x27;s Army of Bohemia defeated Napoleon with 45,000 French troops in the Battle of La Rothière. Elated by their triumph, the Allied commanders devised a new plan whereby Schwarzenberg advanced from Troyes toward Paris while Blücher operated on a more northerly axis from Châlons-sur-Marne toward Meaux. The two armies would be linked by Peter Wittgenstein&#x27;s corps and a scouting force led by Alexander Nikitich Seslavin. Within a few days the cautious Schwarzenberg began pulling Wittgenstein&#x27;s troops to the south. Believing the war was almost over, Blücher pressed rapidly west after a smaller French force under Marshal Jacques MacDonald. Unknown to the Prussian field marshal, on 5 February Schwarzenberg switched Seslavin&#x27;s force from the right flank to the extreme left flank without informing Blücher. Since he lacked a liaison officer with Seslavin, the Prussian was unaware that a dangerous gap yawned on his left flank.

Until 6 February, Napoleon planned to strike a blow against the Army of Bohemia. But that day the French emperor received intelligence that Blücher was moving on Paris, via Meaux. Since MacDonald was too weak to stop Army of Silesia, Napoleon was compelled to deal with Blücher first. While sending out patrols to determine the precise whereabouts of the Prussian field marshal&#x27;s army, Napoleon sent Marshal Auguste de Marmont with 8,000 troops to Sézanne. On 8 February these were joined by part of the Imperial Guard and a large force of cavalry. On the same day MacDonald&#x27;s patrols reported that Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg was near Épernay with 18,000 men. When, on the morning of 9 February, Napoleon received news from Marmont that Fabian Wilhelm von Osten-Sacken was near Montmirail with about 15,000 troops, the French army lurched into action.

Marshal Claude Perrin Victor with 14,000 men, consisting of his own corps, a force under Etienne Maurice Gérard and cavalry, would hold Nogent-sur-Seine. Marshal Nicolas Oudinot with 20,000 men including the newly formed VII Corps, a 5,000-man Young Guard division, National Guards and a cavalry force under Pierre Claude Pajol was instructed to guard the bridges at Bray-sur-Seine, Montereau, Pont-sur-Yonne and Sens. At this time, Napoleon had only 70,000 soldiers to confront about 200,000 Allies. With Victor and Oudinot watching Schwarzenberg, Napoleon decided to act against Blücher who he assumed to have 45,000 troops.

In fact, the Army of Silesia had 57,000 soldiers, including 18,000 under Yorck at Château-Thierry, 20,000 under Sacken near La Ferté-sous-Jouarre and 19,000 under Zakhar Dmitrievich Olsufiev, Peter Mikhailovich Kaptzevich and Friedrich von Kleist at Champaubert, Vertus and Bergères-lès-Vertus. However, Blücher&#x27;s army was spread across a front of and Napoleon might count on the help of the 10,000 men under MacDonald. Napoleon striking force numbered 30,000 men and 120 guns. It consisted of Marmont&#x27;s corps, two Young Guard divisions led by Marshal Michel Ney, the I Cavalry Corps, two Old Guard divisions under Marshal Édouard Mortier, duc de Trévise, part of the Guard Cavalry and Jean-Marie Defrance&#x27;s independent cavalry division. Mortier was ordered to bring up the rear.

Fearing that Napoleon would offer battle near Nogent, Schwarzenberg asked his colleague Blücher to send Kleist&#x27;s corps south to help. Obligingly, the Prussian field marshal ordered Kleist, Kaptzevich and Olsufiev to converge on Sézanne on 10 February. Riding with Kleist and Kaptzevich, Blücher led them south from Vertus toward Fère-Champenoise, planning to turn west from there to Sézanne. After days of rain, the roads were swamped, but the French country people assisted the army in dragging Napoleon&#x27;s cannons through the mud. The French army fell on Olsufiev&#x27;s small corps with crushing force in the Battle of Champaubert on 10 February. With only 5,000 men and 24 guns, the Russian general unwisely held his ground; Olsufiev ended the day as a French prisoner and his corps was nearly destroyed. The 1,500 survivors were formed into three or four &quot;ad hoc&quot; battalions.

==Battle==
===Forces===
===Advance to contact===
Blücher was near Fère-Champenoise when heard that Olsufiev&#x27;s corps had been wrecked; he immediately ordered Kleist and Kaptzevich to undertake a night march back to Vertus. The Prussian field marshal ordered Yorck to march to Montmirail while holding the important bridge over the Marne River at Château-Thierry in case a retreat was necessary. During 10 February, Sacken advanced west to Trilport where there was a bridge over the Marne. Blücher recalled Sacken, instructing him to march east to Montmirail to rendezvous with Yorck, then clear the highway between there and Vertus. Blücher neglected to mention anything to Sacken about escaping over the Marne.

Napoleon ordered MacDonald to move east from Trilport. At 7:00 pm, the emperor instructed Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty with two divisions of cavalry to march west to capture Montmirail, followed at 3:00 am by Étienne Pierre Sylvestre Ricard&#x27;s division of Marmont&#x27;s corps. Ney&#x27;s Young Guard divisions would move in their wake at 6:00 am while Mortier&#x27;s Old Guard would march directly from Sézanne to Montmirail. Jean François Leval&#x27;s division was detached from Oudinot and ordered to march to Montmirail via La Ferté-Gaucher. Napoleon posted Marmont at Étoges with Joseph Lagrange&#x27;s division and the I Cavalry Corps. Using his central position, Napoleon hoped to smash Sacken and Yorck while they were isolated from Blücher. Accordingly, he ordered MacDonald to retake Château-Thierry and its vital bridge while Marmont kept an eye on Blücher.

Yorck sent a dispatch to Blücher expressing doubt whether he could join Sacken at Montmirail because his soldiers were too worn out to march on the night of 10–11 February. Instead, Yorck promised to move south to Viffort on the road to Montmirail. When he received his orders, Sacken destroyed the bridge at La Ferté-sous-Jouarre and began marching east at 9:00 pm on the 10th. By 9:00 am the following day, Russian corps commander&#x27;s leading elements were clashing with French patrols east of Viels-Maisons. The French had driven Sacken&#x27;s Cossacks under Akim Akimovich Karpov out of Montmirail early that morning. At 9:00 am Yorck reached Viffort and was skirmishing with French cavalry. With the La Ferté-sous-Jouarre bridge broken to the west and unknown forces looming to the east, Sacken was in serious danger of becoming trapped. Understanding this, Yorck sent a staff officer to his Russian colleague to warn him that his Prussians would be late to the battlefield. Due to the muddy roads, the heavy Prussian field guns and a brigade had to be left behind. Yorck&#x27;s messenger recommended that Sacken retreat north to Château-Thierry.

Sacken would have none of it. Against the advice of his own staff who urged him to move closer to Yorck, the Russian commander deployed his army corps with its main weight to the south. Strictly following his orders, Sacken determined to smash his way east through Montmirail. At the start of the battle Napoleon was significantly outnumbered and could only defend with 5,000 Old Guard infantry, 4,500 cavalry, Ricard&#x27;s division and 36 guns. Because of the bad condition of the roads and the exhaustion of the soldiers, it was not clear whether French reinforcements or Yorck&#x27;s Prussians would first arrive on the field. Napoleon was taking a huge risk.

===Deployment===
Sacken&#x27;s strength was variously given as 18,000 men and 90 guns by David G. Chandler, 14,000 soldiers and 80 guns by George Nafziger, and 18,000 soldiers by Francis Loraine Petre. Prussian staff officer Karl Freiherr von Müffling credited the Russians with 20,000 troops while another German officer counted 16,300 men and 90 guns. Sacken led two infantry and one cavalry corps. The foot soldiers belonged to Alexander Ivanovich Tallisin&#x27;s VI Corps with the 7th and 18th Infantry Divisions and Ivan Andreievich Lieven&#x27;s XI Corps with the 10th and 27th Infantry Divisions and a brigade from the 16th Division. The cavalry corps included Sergei Nicholaevich Lanskoi&#x27;s 2nd Hussar Division and Semyon Davydovich Pandschulishev&#x27;s 3rd Dragoon Division. Artillery chief Alexey Petrovich Nikitin directed three batteries of 12-pound cannons and four batteries of 6-pounders. Tallisin was acting corps commander in place of Alexei Grigorievich Scherbatov who was ill. The cavalry corps was directed by Ilarion Vasilievich Vasilshikov.

According to Chandler and Petre, Napoleon&#x27;s greatest strength during the battle was 20,000 men. Nafziger arrived at a larger total of 27,153 soldiers. The cavalry was made up of the 2,582 troopers of the 1st Guard Cavalry Division under Pierre David de Colbert-Chabanais, the 2,164 sabers of the 3rd Guard Cavalry Division under Louis Marie Levesque de Laferrière and the 896 horsemen of Defrance&#x27;s division. The infantry numbered 4,133 men from Claude Marie Meunier&#x27;s 1st Young Guard Division, 2,840 soldiers from Philibert Jean-Baptiste Curial&#x27;s 2nd Young Guard Division, 4,796 men from Louis Friant&#x27;s 1st Old Guard Division, 3,878 soldiers from Claude-Étienne Michel&#x27;s 2nd Old Guard Division and 2,917 men from Ricard&#x27;s 8th Infantry Division. Finally, Charles Lefebvre-Desnouettes led either 3,535 horsemen from the 2nd Guard Cavalry Division or 4,947 infantry from the 3rd Young Guard Division.

The Petit Morin River flows west on the southern margin of the battlefield, which was mostly rolling terrain covered by several woods. Just north of the Petit Morin there was a forest which anchored the French left flank. On the northern fringe of the forest was the village of Marchais-en-Brie with a north-south stream a little to the west. Farther north was the east-west highway. Napoleon placed Ricard&#x27;s division in columns east of Marchais. Two of Ricard&#x27;s battalions were detached and posted north of the highway in the Bailly Wood. Behind Ricard were Ney&#x27;s two Young Guard divisions under Meunier and Curial. In reserve was Friant&#x27;s division in battalion columns at 100-pace intervals. To keep Sacken and Yorck from linking up, the French emperor deployed Friant&#x27;s division where the Château-Thierry road met the main east-west highway, with Defrance&#x27;s cavalry on his right. Farther north, blocking the Château-Thierry road was Nansouty who had overall command of the Guard cavalry divisions.

Sacken posted Tallisin&#x27;s corps to the south with the 7th Division on the right and the 18th Division in the center. On the north, but still south of the highway was Lieven&#x27;s corps with the 10th Division in the center and the 27th Division on the left. The infantry was arrayed in two lines with each battalion in column. Three lines of skirmishers deployed in front and the light artillery was posted on the flanks of the infantry. The 12-pounders of Battery Nr. 18 were positioned in the center between the 10th and 18th Divisions while the other two heavy batteries were kept in reserve. The Russians massed 36 guns on the west side of the ravine. According to one account, Lieven&#x27;s corps was in reserve west of the village of L&#x27;Épine-aux-Bois. Vasilshikov&#x27;s cavalry was arranged to the left of Lieven&#x27;s infantry near the highway.

===Combat===
Sacken created a 2,360-man task force under General-major Heidenreich that included the Pskov, Vladimir, Kostroma and Tambov Infantry Regiments, two companies of the 11th Jägers, the Lukovkin Cossack Regiment and six guns. Except for the guns which were unable to cross the stream, Heidenreich&#x27;s troops moved east and seized Marchais at about 11:00 am. More French artillery having arrived in the interval, Napoleon ordered Ricard to attack Marchais at noon. A bitter struggle for Marchais raged for two hours, with the Russians retaining control of the village. Napoleon ordered an artillery bombardment while he waited for Michel&#x27;s Old Guard division to march forward from Montmirail. At 2:00 pm the emperor ordered an attack on Sacken&#x27;s left flank. Four of Friant&#x27;s Old Guard battalions marched west along the highway toward Haute-Épine dairy farm, supported on their right by seven squadrons of Gardes d&#x27;Honneur. At the same time, Claude-Étienne Guyot led four Guard cavalry squadrons around the Russian left flank. The combined attacks broke Sacken&#x27;s first line and compelled him to send his second line into action while moving his cavalry to the left to get in contact with Yorck&#x27;s Prussians.

To break the connection with Yorck, Napoleon ordered a new attack straight down the highway by Nansouty with all three of his divisions, Colbert, Desnouettes and Laferrière. This charge broke up some Russian formations, forcing the soldiers to scatter into the Viels-Maisons woods. Vasilshikov&#x27;s cavalry counterattacked, forcing Nansouty&#x27;s horsemen back and restoring the link with the Prussians. By this time Meunier&#x27;s Young Guard division joined Ricard&#x27;s in the fighting for Marchais on Napoleon&#x27;s left flank. The French captured Marchais twice before being driven out again when Sacken&#x27;s 18th Division recaptured the village.

At either 3:00 pm or 3:30 pm Otto Karl Lorenz von Pirch&#x27;s 1st Infantry Brigade and Heinrich Wilhelm von Horn&#x27;s 7th Infantry Brigade arrived at Fontenelle-en-Brie on the Château-Thierry highway. Because of the poor condition of the roads, the Prussians only had brigade Batteries Nrs. 2 and 3 armed with 6-pounders. The heavier cannons were left behind with the 8th Brigade at Château-Thierry. Fearing the appearance of MacDonald&#x27;s forces in his right rear, Yorck also sent his remaining infantry brigade back to hold Château-Thierry. The Prussian reserve cavalry deployed near Fontenelle though it lacked its artillery. Pirch deployed his brigade in two lines between Fontenelle and the hamlet of Tourneux farther east. After waiting for Horn&#x27;s brigade to close up behind him, Pirch began attacking toward the Bailly and Plenois woods. Sacken ordered his two reserve heavy batteries to support the Prussian advance. At the same time, Michel&#x27;s Old Guard division reached the battlefield and was committed to the fight against Yorck.

Napoleon ordered the tired soldiers of Ricard and Meunier back into the battle for Marchais. The emperor sent Marshal François Joseph Lefebvre with two battalions of Old Guard Foot Chasseurs to cut off Marchais from the north. Ricard organized a four-battalion attack from the hamlet of Pomesson in the south. Lefebvre&#x27;s two battalions captured L&#x27;Épine-aux-Bois. Though the French achieved local artillery superiority, the Russians in Marchais continued to resist until 5:00 pm when they were forced to relinquish control of the village and pull back. When they reached the west side of the ravine, Defrance&#x27;s cavalry charged into them, inflicting heavy losses on the brigades of Dietrich and Blagovenzenko. Several hundred Russian skirmishers near Marchais were either cut down or captured. Realizing that without control of Marchais, the battle was lost, Sacken began pulling back his artillery from the right wing toward the center. Near the highway, Russian infantry squares were charged by French cavalry, but they were able to escape when their own cavalry intervened. The Sophia Regiment was completely engulfed by French cavalry but fought its way clear.

Pirch attacked with the 1st East Prussian and West Prussian Grenadier Battalions and the 5th Silesian Landwehr Regiment in the first line screened by a cloud of skirmishers. The second line consisted of the Leib and Silesian Grenadier Battalions and the 13th Landwehr Regiment. Mortier put four Old Guard battalions into the Bailly woods alongside Ricard&#x27;s 2/2nd Light and 7/4th Light Infantry Battalions. Despite the support from Russian artillery, the Prussian attack recoiled amid blistering musketry and canister shot. When French skirmishers threatened to envelop one flank, the 2/5th Silesian Landwehr charged with the bayonet to cut its way out. Ignoring the protests of his staff, Yorck went up to encourage the skirmish line, saying, &quot;I want to die if you cannot stop the enemy.&quot;

After Michel counterattacked the Prussians with ten battalions, the Leib Grenadier Battalion and the 1/5th Silesian Landwehr met them. Two battalions of the Leib Infantry Regiment anchored the Prussian right flank while the 1st Brigade re-formed on their left. Pirch led a bayonet attack that temporarily stopped the French, but he was badly wounded. He was replaced in command by Colonel Losthin. As Prussian retreat continued, the 13th Silesian Landwehr and the Silesian Grenadier Battalion were assailed in the woods, but managed to drive off their French pursuers. The Prussians ended the day between Fontenelle and Viffort.

By evening the Polish Lancers of the Guard fought their way as far west as Viels-Maisons. Sacken was nearly trapped, but Yorck&#x27;s effort gave the Russians enough time and space to get away. With Vasilshikov&#x27;s cavalry covering the withdrawal, the Russians headed for the Château-Thierry road as it rained. The Russian retreat through marshes and woods was guided by a line of bonfires. The artillery was saved by detailing 50 cavalrymen to help pull each gun using ropes, though eight disabled pieces were abandoned. After an all-night march, Sacken&#x27;s troops reached Viffort on the main road and continued marching northward toward Château-Thierry.

==Results==
According to Petre, the French sustained 2,000 casualties while inflicting losses of 2,000 killed and wounded on the Russians while capturing 800 soldiers, six colors and 13 guns. The Prussians suffered an additional 900 casualties. Chandler asserted that the French lost 2,000 men while the Allies lost 4,000. Nafziger noted that the 1st Prussian Brigade lost 877 officers and men while the 7th Brigade&#x27;s casualties are unknown. He cited various sources that gave Allied losses ranging from a low of 1,500 Russians, 877 Prussians and nine guns to a high of 3,000 killed and wounded plus 708 prisoners, 26 guns and 200 wagons. French losses are consistently reported at 2,000 men with Generals Nansouty, Michel and Boudin de Roville wounded.

MacDonald at Meaux was unable to carry out his orders to advance because he had destroyed the Trilport bridge. His subordinate Horace François Bastien Sébastiani de La Porta was unable to move because Sacken had broken the La Ferté-sous-Jouarre bridge. MacDonald sent his cavalry under Antoine Louis Decrest de Saint-Germain to join Napoleon via Coulommiers. Napoleon again ordered MacDonald to seize Château-Thierry, so that the Allied retreat would be blocked. He was taking a gamble. Napoleon intended to pursue Sacken and Yorck with maximum forces, hoping to trap them against the Marne. He also needed to consider that Blücher was positioned to the east with 20,000 men and 80 guns. Though the emperor began getting calls for help from Victor, he calculated that the unaggressive Schwarzenberg would move slowly while he dealt with Blücher&#x27;s army. The Battle of Château-Thierry would be fought on 12 February.

<text>Die for the Government is the debut studio album by the U.S. punk rock band Anti-Flag, released in 1996. After this album, bassist Andy Flag played with Anti-Flag on their EP &quot;North America Sucks&quot;, but left soon after as they couldn&#x27;t get along as a band. The CD booklet bids farewell to Andy Flag.

The front cover gives the title &quot;Die for the Government&quot;, but side of the CD reads &quot;Die for Your Government&quot;.

== Background ==
Some members of the local community accused the band of selling out for signing with a national label.

== Song Information ==

&quot;Fuck Police Brutality&quot; was inspired by events at a Queers show Justin Sane once attended.

Many of the songs on the record were written about the local punk scene, and included condemnation against the Nazi Punks that were infiltrating the music scene at the time, accusing them of ruining concerts and committing violent acts against other fans. The rest of the album features social-political songs heavily influenced by the Persian Gulf War back in 1991.

You&#x27;d Do the Same, Kill the Rich, and No More Dead are all the same versions that were featured on the Kill Kill Kill EP. Davey Destroyed the Punk Scene was also featured on the ep, although it was rerecorded for the album.

Summer Squatter is a more ska-influenced track than the rest of the album. The album&#x27;s liner notes described the song as being against punks who came into the scene, ruined it for other fans, then left, and not being against the practice of squatting. Go-Go Dancer describes the protagonist falling in love with a girl who works at a punk show as a go-go dancer, and is unique among the Anti-Flag catalogue as being their only love song.

==Track listing==
== Personnel ==
*Justin Sane – guitars, lead vocals
*Andy Flag – bass, backing vocals, mixing on tracks 4,6,7,8,12,13,16, and 17

<text>The Battle of Mormant (17 February 1814) was fought during the War of the Sixth Coalition between an Imperial French army under Emperor Napoleon I and a division of Russians under Count Peter Petrovich Pahlen near the town of Mormant, some southeast of Paris. Pahlen&#x27;s outnumbered force was enveloped by cavalry and infantry, and nearly destroyed, with only about a third of its soldiers escaping. 

Later in the day, a French column encountered an Austrian-Bavarian rearguard in the Battle of Valjouan. The Allied force was attacked and mauled by French infantry and cavalry, before it withdrew behind the Seine River. The Mormant-Valjouan actions and the Battle of Montereau the following day marked the start of a French counteroffensive intended to drive back Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg&#x27;s Allied Army of Bohemia.

==Background==
The Allied generals, particularly the Prussians, were exuberant following their victory over Napoleon at the Battle of La Rothière on 1 February 1814. They soon conceived a plan in which the main army under the Austrian Field Marshal Schwarzenberg advanced toward Paris via Troyes. Simultaneously, Prussian Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher&#x27;s army took a more northerly route along the Marne River toward Meaux. When Napoleon realized that Blücher represented the more serious threat on 6 February, he began to shift his strength northward in order to deal with the Prussian field marshal. Leaving Marshals Victor and Nicolas Oudinot with 34,000 men to hold off Schwarzenberg&#x27;s much larger army, Napoleon headed north on 9 February with 30,000 troops.

Napoleon landed some damaging blows on Blücher&#x27;s army in the subsequent Six Days&#x27; Campaign. On 10 February in the Battle of Champaubert, the French army fell on Zakhar Dmitrievich Olsufiev&#x27;s corps, which numbered only 4,000 infantry and 24 guns. Only 1,700 Russians escaped the disaster and the French made Olsufiev a prisoner. The next day, Napoleon defeated Fabian Gottlieb von Osten-Sacken&#x27;s Russians and Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg&#x27;s Prussians in the Battle of Montmirail. For the loss of 2,000 killed and wounded, the French inflicted a loss of 3,700 men and 13 guns on the Allies. On 12 February, the French beat Sacken and Yorck again in the Battle of Château-Thierry. French losses were 600; the Allies lost 2,750 men and nine guns. Blücher attacked the French on 14 February and was nearly destroyed in the Battle of Vauchamps. The French sustained a loss of 600 men while the Allies lost 6,000 men and 16 guns. Altogether, Blücher&#x27;s 56,000-man army lost over 16,000 soldiers and 47 guns during the week while Napoleon&#x27;s losses added up to only 4,000.

While Napoleon was drubbing Blücher, Schwarzenberg&#x27;s main army pushed back the forces of Marshals Victor and Oudinot. On the Allied right wing, Peter Wittgenstein&#x27;s Russian corps advanced toward Nogent-sur-Seine while Karl Philipp von Wrede&#x27;s Austro-Bavarian corps struck toward Bray-sur-Seine. On the Allied left wing, Crown Prince Frederick William of Württemberg&#x27;s Württemberg corps moved toward Sens with Frederick Bianchi&#x27;s Austrian corps on his left. Ignaz Gyulai&#x27;s Austrian corps supported the left wing while Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly&#x27;s Allied Reserves supported the right wing. Wrede got across the Seine at Bray, causing the French to abandon Nogent to Wittgenstein. Victor and Oudinot retreated behind the Yerres stream, dangerously close to Paris. When the marshals called for help, Napoleon sent Marshal Jacques MacDonald to Guignes where he arrived on 14 February with a corps that was rebuilt by replacements from Paris. A blunder caused the army&#x27;s wagon train to withdraw across the Marne near Paris, causing panic in the French capital.

Leaving Marshals Auguste de Marmont and Édouard Mortier to watch Blücher, Napoleon rapidly transferred his strength southward against Schwarzenberg&#x27;s army. The French emperor arrived at Guignes on the evening of 16 February and planned to launch his offensive the next day. He found the army of Victor and Oudinot in good order and prepared to go over to the offensive.

==Battle==
===Armies===
Schwarzenberg had over 100,000 soldiers in his main army. A week later, on 23 February, the army counted Moritz von Liechtenstein&#x27;s 2nd Light Division (4,000), Bianchi&#x27;s I Corps (13,000), Gyulai&#x27;s III Corps (11,000), Württemberg&#x27;s IV Corps (10,000), Wrede&#x27;s V Corps (21,000), Wittgenstein&#x27;s VI Corps (15,000) and Barclay&#x27;s Guard and Reserve Corps (30,000). This reckoning was made after the Battle of Montereau which cost the I Corps 2,000 casualties and the IV Corps 2,844 casualties. When Schwarzenberg heard about Blücher&#x27;s defeats, he ordered his army to pull back behind the Seine. Instead of obeying, Wittgenstein aggressively pushed his corps west beyond Provins toward Nangis while his advanced guard under Pahlen reached Mormant. On 16 February, Wrede&#x27;s corps was near Donnemarie-Dontilly except for Anton von Hardegg&#x27;s division which was in Nangis. Württemberg&#x27;s corps was near Montereau with advance guards near Melun. Bianchi&#x27;s corps was south of the Seine between Moret-sur-Loing and Villeneuve-la-Guyard with advance guards farther west in Fontainebleau. Gyulai&#x27;s corps was in Pont-sur-Yonne, Barclay&#x27;s Russian Reserves were near Nogent while Liechtenstein&#x27;s division and the Austrian Reserves were at Sens.

Napoleon massed his army near Guignes by the evening of 16 February. The Imperial Guard forces included Louis Friant&#x27;s Old Guard division (4,500), Marshal Michel Ney&#x27;s Young Guard divisions (3,000) and Guard cavalry under Louis Marie Laferrière-Levesque, Rémi Joseph Isidore Exelmans and Louis Michel Pac (3,000 total). The line troops consisted of Victor&#x27;s II Corps (6,549 men, 40 guns), from Oudinot&#x27;s VII Corps (7,516 men, 34 guns), from MacDonald&#x27;s XI Corps (8,797 men, 37 guns), Édouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud&#x27;s V Cavalry Corps (4,700) and François Étienne de Kellermann&#x27;s VI Cavalry Corps (2,788). In addition, there were 4,500 men from Étienne Maurice Gérard&#x27;s Reserve of Paris. Farther east near Melun were Henri François Marie Charpentier&#x27;s Young Guard division (3,500), Michel-Marie Pacthod&#x27;s National Guards division (5,000) and Pierre Claude Pajol&#x27;s cavalry division (1,400). On the march to Guignes were Jean François Leval&#x27;s division (4,500), Joseph Boyer de Rébeval&#x27;s Young Guard division (3,300) and Antoine-Louis Decrest de Saint-Germain&#x27;s division (1,300). Étienne Tardif de Pommeroux de Bordesoulle was also on hand with 581 newly recruited horsemen.

===Mormant===
At Mormant, Pahlen became aware that large numbers of French troops were near his position. The Russian placed two battalions in Mormant and massed the rest of his troops on both sides of the highway with his artillery in the center. He was prepared to fight or to retreat. During the night, Wittgenstein received positive orders to withdraw so he marched his corps east toward Provins at dawn. He forwarded the orders to Pahlen but they came too late. At daybreak, Pahlen saw that he faced an overwhelming force and began to retreat. The Russian commanded 2,000–2,500-foot soldiers and 1,500–1,800 mounted troops. The infantry consisted of Selenginsk, Reval, Tenguinsk and Estonia Regiments and the 4th and 34th Jäger Regiments. The cavalry were led by Theodor von Rüdiger and included 14 squadrons from the Soumy Hussar, Olviopol Hussar and Tchougoulev Uhlan Regiments plus the Illowaiski XII, Rebrikov III and two unnamed Cossack regiments. Colonel Rosen&#x27;s brigade was to the east at Bailly. Another source stated that the Grodno rather than the Olviopol Hussars were engaged, that the 20th and 21st Jägers were involved and that the Russians had 12 field pieces.

At 5:00 a.m. the French infantry advanced with Guillaume Philibert Duhesme&#x27;s II Corps division on the left, Gérard&#x27;s Paris Reserve in the center and Louis Huguet-Château&#x27;s II Corps division on the right. Victor&#x27;s corps artillery marched in the intervals. Milhaud&#x27;s corps included Hippolyte Piré&#x27;s light cavalry division, André Briche&#x27;s dragoon division and Samuel-François Lhéritier dragoon division. Kellermann&#x27;s corps had only Anne-François-Charles Trelliard&#x27;s dragoon division, fresh from the Spanish theater. Lhéritier was temporarily assigned to Kellermann. Milhaud commanded the left wing cavalry with Piré&#x27;s horsemen deployed on Duhesme&#x27;s left and Briche&#x27;s troopers echeloned to Piré&#x27;s left rear. Kellermann commanded the right wing cavalry with Trelliard&#x27;s dragoons on Huguet-Château&#x27;s right and Lhéritier&#x27;s troopers echeloned to Trelliard&#x27;s right rear. Behind the front-line units marched two VII Corps units on the north side of the highway. Pierre François Xavier Boyer&#x27;s division was in the lead with Henri Rottembourg&#x27;s division farther back. The Imperial Guard artillery moved along the main road beside the VII Corps. The remainder of the army followed.

Pahlen ordered the two battalions in Mormant to hold back the French at all cost in order to allow the rest of his command to escape. Four Cossack regiments opposed Kellermann&#x27;s corps while Rüdiger&#x27;s regular cavalry faced Milhaud&#x27;s corps. Jacques Gervais, baron Subervie&#x27;s brigade of Pire&#x27;s division turned half-right and swooped down on the Russian skirmishers while the rest of Milhaud&#x27;s cavalry advanced on Rüdiger&#x27;s horsemen. In the center, Gérard&#x27;s infantry forced its way into the village of Mormant, flushing its defenders into the open. Pierre Ismert, leading one of Trelliard&#x27;s brigades, hurled the 4th Dragoons at the fleeing Russians, forcing many to surrender. On the right flank, Lhéritier&#x27;s first brigade under August Étienne Lamotte dispersed the first two Cossack regiments. When the Illowaiski and Rebrikov Cossacks tried to intervene they were swept away by Lhéritier&#x27;s second brigade led by Jean Antoine de Collaert. As Lhéritier&#x27;s horsemen galloped after the routed Cossacks, the 16th Dragoons of Trelliard&#x27;s division charged and broke a Russian square.

On the north flank, Rüdiger deployed nine squadrons in the first line and five squadrons in the second line. Against the Russian horsemen, Milhaud had Piré&#x27;s division (minus Subervie&#x27;s brigade) in the first line, Gabriel Gaspard Montelégier&#x27;s brigade in the second and Denis Éloi Ludot&#x27;s in the third. Successive charges by Piré and Montelégier broke Rüdiger&#x27;s squadrons and chased them off the battlefield with the French light cavalry in pursuit. Milhaud directed Montelégier to deal with the Russian infantry while sending Ludot on a sweep to block Pahlen&#x27;s escape route. Without its supporting cavalry, Pahlen&#x27;s infantry battalions were compelled to form into a square formation to defend against cavalry. Antoine Drouot aggressively pushed 36 guns from the French Guard artillery into the front line where they pummeled the Russians.

Pahlen sent messengers to Nangis pleading for assistance, but Ignaz Splény de Miháldi&#x27;s division had already marched off leaving only Anton Leonhard von Hardegg&#x27;s Austrian division from Wrede&#x27;s V Corps. Hardegg had some infantry battalions in Nangis and two cavalry regiments in Bailly. The Austrian division commander declined to assist his ally and ordered an immediate retreat. However, before they could get away, the two Austrian cavalry regiments were disordered by the fleeing Cossacks and then scattered by Piré&#x27;s and August Lamotte&#x27;s horsemen. The Russian infantry&#x27;s withdrawal continued, leaving a trail of casualties from artillery fire. On the outskirts of Grandpuits they were finally brought to halt by Ludot&#x27;s brigade which was now blocking the Russian line of retreat. Surrounded and hammered by artillery, the Russian battalions were all overrun by cavalry charges. The final square was broken when charged simultaneously by the brigades of Ludot and Ismert.

The Russians probably lost one-third of their cavalry and admitted the loss of 2,114-foot soldiers. The French claimed 9–12 guns and 40 caissons captured while the Russians said they saved two cannons. The French cavalry commanders reported losing 150 horsemen and Gérard reported only 30 casualties. Pahlen&#x27;s survivors dispersed over the French countryside. Another authority stated that Pahlen lost 2,000 men and 10 guns. The Reval and Selenginsk Regiments lost so many men that they were withdrawn to Plock in Poland to reorganize.

===Valjouan===
At Nangis, Napoleon split his advancing army into three columns. Victor led the right-most column south toward Montereau. This force included the II Corps, Paris Reserve, Lhéritier&#x27;s dragoons and Bordesoulle&#x27;s recruits. The left-most column under Oudinot, with the VII Corps and Trelliard&#x27;s dragoons, followed Wittgenstein&#x27;s retreat east toward Provins. MacDonald&#x27;s center column consisted of the XI Corps, Piré light horsemen and Briche&#x27;s dragoons; it headed southeast toward Donnemarie. The French emperor held the Imperial Guard in reserve at Nangis. Wittgenstein retreated rapidly and crossed the Seine at Nogent that evening.

Victor&#x27;s column departed Nangis at 1:30 p.m. and bumped into enemy resistance at Villeneuve-le-Comte about 3:00 p.m. Tipped off by Hardegg&#x27;s survivors, Peter de Lamotte deployed the 3rd Bavarian Division on the Valjouan heights, blocking the road. Lamotte posted the 11th Bavarian Line Infantry in an advanced position at Villeneuve and Grand-Maison farm; his cavalry covered both flanks. The divisions of Hardegg and Splény were behind Lamotte; they began withdrawing as soon as the French appeared. The Schwarzenberg Uhlans Nr. 1 and Archduke Joseph Hussars Nr. 2, rallied from their earlier mauling by the French cavalry, were positioned to assist the Bavarian cavalry. Gérard, whose troops led the infantry column, decided to attack at once and asked Victor for help from the II Corps. Gérard deployed Lhéritier to the right and Bordesoulle to the left.

Supported by 12 cannons, Jacques Félix Jan de La Hamelinaye&#x27;s brigade stormed Villeneuve and Grand-Maison at 3:30 p.m. Gérard held Georges Joseph Dufour&#x27;s brigade in reserve. As the Bavarian foot soldiers bolted from both positions, they were set upon by Bordesoulle&#x27;s cavalrymen. When some Allied cavalry tried to rescue the Bavarians, the French horsemen rode into them and chased them away. Next, the Iller Mobile Legion tried to intervene, only to be routed by the French recruits. Altogether, Bordesoulle&#x27;s half-trained horsemen inflicted about 300 casualties on their foes. They apparently took no prisoners except a wounded Austrian officer who Bordesoulle had to personally save.

Peter de Lamotte formed his division into a square formation and began to retreat, followed by Bordesoulle. At some point during the withdrawal, the two Austrian mounted regiments were attacked by a large force of French cavalry and suffered 200 casualties in the melee. After Lamotte marched about toward Donnemarie, Gérard&#x27;s infantry burst out of the woods and nearly broke up Lamotte&#x27;s division. However, the French cavalry was absent this time, allowing the Bavarians to reform their battalions and resume their retreat. That evening, Wrede got the V Corps across the Seine at Bray, except for a rearguard at Mouy-sur-Seine.

===Other actions===
On 17 February, Charpentier&#x27;s division and a task force under Jacques Alexandre Allix de Vaux advanced south from Melun, driving Ignaz Count Hardegg&#x27;s division (Bianchi&#x27;s I Corps) from Fontainebleau. Pajol and Pacthod left Saint-Germain-Laxis and headed southeast toward Montereau. They skirmished with Prince Adam of Württemberg&#x27;s 1,000 infantry and cavalry during the day.

==Result==
The Allies had become overextended and Napoleon took advantage of this to strike hard at his enemies. George Nafziger estimated that the French sustained 800 casualties while the Allies lost 3,000 men and 14 guns at Mormant and Valjouan. Digby Smith gave casualties for the actions as 600 French and 3,114 Allied, with the French seizing 9 guns and 40 caissons. Pahlen was credited with 2,500 infantry and 1,800 cavalry of which 1,250 were Russian and 550 were Austrian. Though the author listed the Valjouan action, he did not list Bavarian numbers. The French brought 18,000–20,000 men to the battlefield. Gaston Bodart stated that the French brought 18,000 troops into action and sustained losses of 600. Bodart credited the Coalition with 5,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry, and gave their losses as 2,400 men, including 550 Austrians. 

Napoleon was angry at Victor for not pressing on that evening. He expected Victor to be at Montereau at 6:00 a.m. the next day. When Victor did not arrive before the town until 9:00 a.m., the French emperor replaced him with Gérard. Schwarzenberg ordered the Crown Prince of Württemberg to hold a bridgehead at Montereau for a day. The Battle of Montereau was fought on 18 February.

<doc id="157696" wikidata="Q316831" url="?curid=157696" title="Raynald of Châtillon">
<text>Raynald of Châtillon ( 11244 July 1187), also known as Reynald, Reginald, or Renaud, was Prince of Antioch—a crusader state in the Middle East—from 1153 to 1160 or 1161, and Lord of Oultrejordain—a large fiefdom in the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem—from 1175 until his death, ruling both territories (&#x27;by right of wife&#x27;). The second son of a French noble family, he joined the Second Crusade in 1147, and settled in Jerusalem as a mercenary. Six years later, he married Constance, Princess of Antioch, although her subjects regarded the marriage as a mesalliance.

Always in need of funds, Raynald tortured Aimery of Limoges, Latin Patriarch of Antioch, who had refused to pay a subsidy to him. He launched a plundering raid in Cyprus in 1156, causing great destruction in Byzantine territory. Four years later, Manuel I Komnenos, the Byzantine Emperor, led an army towards Antioch, forcing Raynald to accept Byzantine suzerainty. Raynald was raiding the valley of the river Euphrates in 1160 or 1161 when the governor of Aleppo captured him at Marash. He was released for a large ransom in 1176 but did not return to Antioch, because his wife had died in the interim. He married Stephanie of Milly, the wealthy heiress of Oultrejordain. Since King Baldwin IV of Jerusalem had also granted Hebron to him, Raynald became one of the wealthiest barons in the kingdom. After Baldwin, who suffered from leprosy, made him regent in 1177, Raynald led the crusader army that defeated Saladin, the Sultan of Egypt and Syria, at the Battle of Montgisard. In control of the caravan routes between Egypt and Syria, he was the only Christian leader to pursue an offensive policy against Saladin, by making plundering raids against the caravans travelling near his domains. After Raynald&#x27;s newly constructed fleet plundered the coast of the Red Sea in early 1183, threatening the route of Muslim pilgrims to Mecca, Saladin pledged that he would never forgive him.

Raynald was a firm supporter of Baldwin IV&#x27;s sister, Sybilla, and her husband, Guy of Lusignan, during conflicts regarding Baldwin IV&#x27;s succession. Sibylla and Guy were able to seize the throne in 1186 due to Raynald&#x27;s co-operation with her uncle, Joscelin III of Courtenay. In spite of a truce between Saladin and the Kingdom of Jerusalem, Raynald attacked a caravan travelling from Egypt to Syria in late 1186 or early 1187, claiming that the truce was not binding upon him. After Raynald refused to pay compensation, Saladin invaded the kingdom and annihilated the crusader army in the Battle of Hattin. Raynald was captured on the battlefield. Saladin personally beheaded him after he refused to convert to Islam. Many historians have regarded Raynald as an irresponsible adventurer whose lust for booty caused the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. On the other hand, the historian Bernard Hamilton says that he was the only crusader leader who tried to prevent Saladin from unifying the nearby Muslim states.

== Early years ==

Raynald was the younger son of Hervé II, Lord of Donzy in France. In older historiography, Raynald was thought to have been the son of Geoffrey, Count of Gien, but the historian Jean Richard demonstrated Raynald&#x27;s kinship with the lords of Donzy. They were influential noblemen in the Duchy of Burgundy (in present-day eastern France), who claimed descent from the Palladii, a prominent Gallo-Roman aristocratic family during the Later Roman period. Raynald&#x27;s mother, whose name is not known, was a daughter of Hugh the White, Lord of La Ferté-Milon.

Born around 1124, Raynald inherited the lordship of Châtillon-sur-Loire. Years later, he would complain in a letter to Louis VII of France that a part of his patrimony was &quot;violently and unjustly confiscated&quot;. The historian Malcolm Barber says that probably this event prompted Raynald to leave his homeland for the crusader states. According to modern historians, Raynald came to the Kingdom of Jerusalem in LouisVII&#x27;s army during the Second Crusade in 1147, and stayed behind when the French abandoned the military campaign two years later. Early in 1153, he is known to have fought in the army of Baldwin III of Jerusalem during the siege of Ascalon.

The 12th-century historian William of Tyre, who was Raynald&#x27;s political opponent, describes him as &quot;a kind of mercenary knight&quot;, emphasising the distance between Raynald and Princess Constance of Antioch, whom Raynald unexpectedly engaged to marry before the end of the siege. Constance, the only daughter and successor of Bohemond II of Antioch, had been widowed when her husband, Raymond of Poitiers, fell in the Battle of Inab on 28June 1148. To secure the defence of Antioch, BaldwinIII (who was Constance&#x27;s cousin) led his army to Antioch at least three times during the following years. He tried to persuade Constance to remarry, but she did not accept his candidates. She also refused John Roger, whom the Byzantine emperor, Manuel I Komnenos, had proposed to be her husband. Raynald and Constance kept their betrothal a secret until Baldwin gave his permission for their marriage. According to the historian Andrew D. Buck, they needed a royal permission because Raynald was in Baldwin&#x27;s service. The early-13th-century chronicle known as the states that Baldwin happily consented to the marriage because it freed him from his obligation to &quot;defend a land&quot; (namely Antioch) &quot;which was so far away&quot; from his kingdom.

== Prince of Antioch ==

After Baldwin granted his consent, Constance married Raynald. He was installed as prince in or shortly before May 1153. In that month, he confirmed the privileges of the Venetian merchants. William of Tyre records that his subjects were astonished that their &quot;famous, powerful and well-born&quot; princess married a man of low status. No coins struck for Raynald have survived. According to Buck, this indicates that Raynald&#x27;s position was relatively weak. Whereas Raymond of Poitiers had issued around half of his charters without a reference to Constance, Raynald always mentioned that he made the decision with his wife&#x27;s consent. Raynald did control appointments to the highest offices: he made Geoffrey Jordanis the constable and Geoffrey Falsard the duke of Antioch.

The Norman chronicler Robert of Torigni writes that Raynald seized three fortresses from the Aleppans soon after his accession, but does not name them. Aimery of Limoges, the wealthy Latin patriarch of Antioch, did not hide his dismay at Constance&#x27;s second marriage. He even refused to pay a subsidy to Raynald, although Raynald, as Barber underlines, &quot;was in dire need of money&quot;. In retaliation for Aimery&#x27;s refusal, Raynald arrested and tortured him in the summer of 1154, forcing him to sit naked and covered with honey in the sun, before imprisoning him. Aimery was only released on BaldwinIII&#x27;s demand, but he soon left Antioch for Jerusalem. Surprisingly, Raynald was not excommunicated for his abuse of a high-ranking cleric. Buck argues that Raynald could avoid the punishment because of Aimery&#x27;s previous disputes with the papacy over the Archbishopric of Tyre. Instead, Aimery excommunicated Raynald on the demand of the papacy in 1154 as a consequence of a conflict between Antioch and Genoa.

Emperor Manuel, who claimed suzerainty over Antioch, sent his envoys to Raynald, proposing to recognize him as the new prince if he launched a campaign against the Armenians of Cilicia, who had risen up against Byzantine rule. He also promised that he would compensate Raynald for the expenses of the campaign. After Raynald defeated the Armenians at Alexandretta in 1155, the Knights Templar took control of the region of the Syrian Gates that the Armenians had recently invaded. Although the sources are unclear, Runciman and Barber agree that it was Raynald who granted the territory to them.

Always in need of funds, Raynald urged Manuel to send the promised subsidy to him, but Manuel failed to pay the money. Raynald made an alliance with the Armenian lord Thoros II of Cilicia. They attacked Cyprus, plundering the prosperous Byzantine island for three weeks in early 1156. Hearing rumours of an imperial fleet approaching the island, they left Cyprus, but only after they had forced all Cypriots to ransom themselves, with the exception of the wealthiest individuals (including Manuel&#x27;s nephew, John Doukas Komnenos), whom they carried off to Antioch as hostages.

Taking advantage of the presence of Count Thierry of Flanders and his army in the Holy Land and an earthquake that had destroyed most towns in Northern Syria, BaldwinIII of Jerusalem invaded the Muslim territories in the valley of the Orontes River in the autumn of 1157. Raynald joined the royal army, and they laid siege to Shaizar. At this point, Shaizar was held by the Shi&#x27;ite Assassins, but before the earthquake it had been the seat of the Sunnite Munqidhites who paid an annual tribute to Raynald. Baldwin was planning to grant the fortress to Thierry of Flanders, but Raynald demanded that the count should pay homage to him for the town. After Thierry sharply refused to swear fealty to an upstart, the crusaders abandoned the siege. They marched on Harenc (present-day Harem, Syria), which had been an Antiochene fortress before Nur ad-Din captured it in 1150. After the crusaders captured Harenc in February 1158, Raynald granted it to Raynald of Saint-Valery from Flanders.

Emperor Manuel unexpectedly invaded Cilicia, forcing ThorosII to seek refuge in the mountains in December 1158. Unable to resist a full-scale Byzantine invasion, Raynald hurried to Mamistra to voluntarily make his submission to the emperor. On Manuel&#x27;s demand, Raynald and his retainers walked barefoot and bareheaded through the streets of the town to the imperial tent where he prostrated himself, begging for mercy. William of Tyre stated that &quot;the glory of the Latin world was put to shame&quot; on this occasion, because envoys from the nearby Muslim and Christian rulers were also present at Raynald&#x27;s humiliation. Manuel demanded that a Greek patriarch be installed at Antioch. Although his demand was not accepted, documentary evidence indicates that Gerard, the Catholic bishop of Latakia, was forced to move to Jerusalem. Raynald had to promise that he would allow a Byzantine garrison to stay in the citadel whenever it was required and would send a troop to fight in the Byzantine army. Before long, BaldwinIII of Jerusalem persuaded Manuel to consent to the return of the Latin patriarch, Aimery, to Antioch, instead of installing a Greek patriarch. When the emperor entered Antioch with much pomp and ceremony on 12April 1159, Raynald held the bridle of Manuel&#x27;s horse. Manuel left the town eight days later.

Raynald made a plundering raid in the valley of the river Euphrates at Marash to seize cattle, horses and camels from the local peasants in November 1160 or 1161. Majd ad-Din, Nur ad-Din&#x27;s commander of Aleppo, gathered his troops (10,000 people, according to the contemporary historian Matthew of Edessa), and attacked Raynald and his retinue on the way back to Antioch. Raynald tried to fight, but he was unhorsed and captured. He was sent to Aleppo where he was put in jail.

== Captivity and release ==

Almost nothing is known about Raynald&#x27;s life while he was imprisoned for fifteen years. He shared his prison with Joscelin III of Courtenay, the titular count of Edessa, who had been captured a couple of months before him. In Raynald&#x27;s absence, Constance wanted to rule alone, but BaldwinIII of Jerusalem made Patriarch Aimery regent for her fifteen-year-old son (Raynald&#x27;s stepson), Bohemond III of Antioch. Constance died around 1163, shortly after her son reached the age of majority. Her death deprived Raynald of his claim to Antioch. However, he had become an important personality, with prominent family connections, as his stepdaughter, Maria of Antioch, married Emperor Manuel in 1161, and his own daughter, Agnes, became the wife of Béla III of Hungary.

Nur ad-Din died unexpectedly in 1174. His underage son as-Salih Ismail al-Malik succeeded him, and Nur ad-Din&#x27;s (&#x27;slave-soldier&#x27;) Gümüshtekin assumed the regency for him in Aleppo. Being unable to resist attacks by Saladin, Gümüshtekin sought the support of Raynald&#x27;s stepson Bohemond III of Antioch, and on his request released Raynald along with Joscelin of Courtenay and all other Christian prisoners in 1176. Raynald&#x27;s ransom, fixed at 120,000 gold dinars, reflected his prestige. It was most probably paid by Emperor Manuel, according to Barber and Hamilton.

Raynald came to Jerusalem with Joscelin before 1September 1176, where he became a close ally of Joscelin&#x27;s sister, Agnes of Courtenay. She was the mother of the young Baldwin IV of Jerusalem, who suffered from leprosy. Hugo Etherianis, who lived in Constantinople after about 1165, mentioned in the preface of his work &quot;About the Procession of the Holy Spirit,&quot; that he had asked &quot;Prince Raynald&quot; to deliver a copy of the work to Aimery of Limoges. Hamilton writes that these words suggest that Raynald led the embassy that BaldwinIV sent to Constantinople to confirm an alliance between Jerusalem and the Byzantine Empire against Egypt towards the end of 1176.

== Lord of Oultrejordain ==

=== First years ===

After his return from Constantinople early in 1177, Raynald married Stephanie of Milly, the lady of Oultrejordain, and BaldwinIV also granted him Hebron. The first extant charter styling Raynald as &quot;Lord of Hebron and Montréal&quot; was issued in November 1177. He owed service of 60 knights to the Crown, showing that he had become one of the wealthiest barons of the realm. From his castles at Kerak and Montréal, he controlled the routes between the two main parts of Saladin&#x27;s empire, Syria and Egypt. Raynald and BaldwinIV&#x27;s brother-in-law, William of Montferrat, jointly granted large estates to Rodrigo Álvarez, the founder of the Order of Mountjoy, to strengthen the defence of the southern and eastern frontier of the kingdom. After William of Montferrat died in June 1177, the king made Raynald regent of the kingdom.

Baldwin IV&#x27;s cousin Count Philip I of Flanders came to the Holy Land at the head of a crusader army in early August 1177. The king offered him the regency, but Philip refused the offer, saying that he did not want to stay in the kingdom. Philip declared that he was &quot;willing to take orders&quot; from anybody, but he protested when Baldwin confirmed Raynald&#x27;s position as &quot;regent of the kingdom and of the armies&quot; as he thought that a military commander without special powers should lead the army. Philip left the kingdom a month after his arrival.

Saladin invaded the region of Ascalon, but the royal army launched an attack on him in the Battle of Montgisard on 25November, leading to his defeat. William of Tyre and Ernoul attributed the victory to the king, but Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad and other Muslim authors recorded that Raynald was the supreme commander. Saladin himself referred to the battle as a &quot;major defeat which God mended with the famous battle of Hattin&quot;, according to Baha ad-Din.

Raynald signed a majority of royal charters between 1177 and 1180, with his name always first among signatories, showing that he was the king&#x27;s most influential official during this period. Raynald became one of the principal supporters of Guy of Lusignan, who married the king&#x27;s elder sister, Sybilla, in early 1180, although many barons of the realm had opposed the marriage. The king&#x27;s half sister, Isabella (whose stepfather, Balian of Ibelin, was Guy of Lusignan&#x27;s opponent), was engaged to Raynald&#x27;s stepson, Humphrey IV of Toron, in autumn 1180.

BaldwinIV dispatched Raynald, along with Heraclius, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, to mediate a reconciliation between Bohemond III of Antioch and Patriarch Aimery in early 1181. The same year, Roupen III, Lord of Cilician Armenia, married Raynald&#x27;s stepdaughter, Isabella of Toron.

=== Fights against Saladin ===

Raynald was the only Christian leader who fought against Saladin in the 1180s. The contemporary chronicler Ernoul mentions two raids that Raynald made against caravans travelling between Egypt and Syria, breaking the truce. Modern historians debate whether Raynald&#x27;s military actions sprang from a desire for booty, or were deliberate maneuvers to prevent Saladin from annexing new territories. After as-Salih died on 18November 1181, Saladin tried to seize Aleppo, but Raynald stormed into Saladin&#x27;s territory, reaching as far as Tabuk on the route between Damascus and Mecca. Saladin&#x27;s nephew, Farrukh Shah, invaded Oultrejordain instead of attacking Aleppo to compel Raynald to return from the Arabian Desert. Before long, Raynald seized a caravan and imprisoned its members. On Saladin&#x27;s protest, BaldwinIV ordered Raynald to free them, but Raynald refused. His defiance annoyed the king, enabling Raymond III of Tripoli&#x27;s partisans to reconcile him with the monarch. A close relative of Baldwin, Raymond had assumed the regency in 1174 but was banned from the kingdom for allegedly plotting against the ailing king. Raymond&#x27;s return to the royal court put an end to Raynald&#x27;s paramount position. After accepting the new situation, Raynald cooperated with the king and Raymond during the fights against Saladin in the summer of 1182.

Saladin revived the Egyptian naval force and tried to capture Beirut, but his ships were forced to retreat. Raynald ordered the building of at least five ships in Oultrejordain. They were carried across the Negev desert to the Gulf of Aqaba at the northern end of the Red Sea in January or February 1183. He captured the fort of Ayla (present-day Eilat in Israel), and attacked the Egyptian fortress on Pharaoh&#x27;s Island. Part of his fleet made a plundering raid along the coasts against ships delivering Muslim pilgrims and goods, threatening the security of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Raynald left the island, but his fleet continued the siege. Saladin&#x27;s brother, al-Adil, the governor of Egypt, dispatched a fleet to the Red Sea. The Egyptians relieved Pharaoh&#x27;s Island and destroyed the Christian fleet. Some of the soldiers were captured near Medina because they landed either to escape or to attack the city. Raynald&#x27;s men were executed, and Saladin took an oath that he would never forgive him. Though Raynald&#x27;s naval expedition &quot;showed a remarkable degree of initiative&quot; according to Hamilton, most modern historians agree that it contributed to the unification of Syria and Egypt under Saladin&#x27;s rule. Saladin captured Aleppo in June 1183, completing the encirclement of the crusader states.

Baldwin IV, who had become seriously ill, made Guy of Lusignan regent in October 1183. Within a month, Baldwin had dismissed Guy, and had Guy&#x27;s five-year-old stepson, Baldwin V, crowned king in association with himself. Raynald was not present at the child&#x27;s coronation, because he was at the wedding of his stepson, Humphrey, and BaldwinIV&#x27;s sister, Isabella, in Kerak. Saladin unexpectedly invaded Oultrejordain, forcing the local inhabitants to seek refuge in Kerak. After Saladin broke into the town, Raynald only managed to escape to the fortress because one of his retainers had hindered the attackers from seizing the bridge between the town and the castle. Saladin laid siege to Kerak. According to Ernoul, Raynald&#x27;s wife sent dishes from the wedding to Saladin, persuading him to stop bombarding the tower where her son and his wife stayed. After envoys from Kerak informed BaldwinIV of the siege, the royal army left Jerusalem for Kerak under the command of the king and RaymondIII of Tripoli. Saladin abandoned the siege before their arrival on 4December. On Saladin&#x27;s order, Izz ad-Din Usama had a fortress built at Ajloun, near the northern border of Raynald&#x27;s domains.

=== Kingmaker ===

Baldwin IV died in early 1185. His successor, the child BaldwinV, died in late summer 1186. The High Court of Jerusalem had ruled that neither BaldwinV&#x27;s mother, Sybilla (who was Guy of Lusignan&#x27;s wife), nor her sister, Isabella (who was the wife of Raynald&#x27;s stepson), could be crowned without the decision of the pope, the Holy Roman Emperor, and the kings of France and England on BaldwinV&#x27;s lawful successor. However, Sybilla&#x27;s uncle, JoscelinIII of Courtenay, took control of Jerusalem with the support of Raynald and other influential prelates and royal officials. Raynald urged the townspeople to accept Sybilla as the lawful monarch, according to the . RaymondIII of Tripoli, and his supporters tried to prevent her coronation and reminded her partisans of the decision of the High Court. Ignoring their protest, Raynald and Gerard of Ridefort, Grand Master of the Knights Templar, accompanied Sybilla to the Holy Sepulchre, where she was crowned. She also arranged the coronation of her husband, although he was unpopular even among her supporters. Her opponents tried to persuade Raynald&#x27;s stepson, Humphrey, to claim the crown on his wife&#x27;s behalf, but Humphrey deserted them and swore fealty to Sybilla and Guy. Raynald headed the list of secular witnesses in four royal charters issued between 21October 1186 and 7March 1187, showing that he had become a principal figure in the new king&#x27;s court.

Ali ibn al-Athir and other Muslim historians stated that Raynald made a separate truce with Saladin in 1186. This &quot;seems unlikely to be true&quot;, according to Hamilton, because the truce between the Kingdom of Jerusalem and Saladin legally covered Raynald&#x27;s domains as they formed a large fiefdom in the kingdom. In late 1186 or early 1187, a rich caravan travelled through Oultrejordain from Egypt to Syria. Ali ibn al-Athir mentioned that a group of armed men accompanied the caravan. Raynald seized the caravan, possibly because he regarded the presence of soldiers as a breach of the truce, according to Hamilton. He took all the merchants and their families prisoner, seized a large amount of booty, and refused to receive envoys from Saladin demanding compensation. Saladin sent his envoys to Guy of Lusignan, who accepted his demands. However, Raynald refused to obey the king, stating in the words of the that &quot;he was lord of his land, just as Guy was lord of his, and he had no truces with the Saracens&quot;. For Barber, Raynald&#x27;s disobedience indicates that the kingdom was &quot;on the brink of breaking up into a collection of semi-autonomous fiefdoms&quot; under Guy&#x27;s rule. Saladin proclaimed a (or holy war) against the kingdom, taking an oath that he would personally kill Raynald for breaking the truce. The historian Paul M. Cobb remarks that Saladin &quot;badly needed a victory against the Franks to silence those who criticized him for spending so much time at war with his fellow Muslims&quot;.

== Capture and execution ==

The incorrectly claims that Saladin&#x27;s sister was also among the prisoners taken by Raynald when he seized the caravan. She returned from Mecca to Damascus in a separate pilgrim caravan in March 1187. To protect her against an attack by Raynald, Saladin escorted the pilgrims while they were travelling near Oultrejordain. Saladin stormed into Oultrejordain on 26April and pillaged Raynald&#x27;s domains for a month. Thereafter, Saladin marched to Ashtara on the road between Damascus and Tiberias, where the troops coming from all parts of his realm assembled.

The Christian forces assembled at Sepphoris. Raynald and Gerard of Ridefort persuaded Guy of Lusignan to take the initiative and attack Saladin&#x27;s army, although RaymondIII of Tripoli had tried to persuade the king to avoid a direct fight with it. During the debate, Raynald accused Raymond of Tripoli of co-operating with the enemy. Raynald and Rideford had fatally misjudged the situation. Saladin inflicted a crushing defeat on the crusaders in the Battle of Hattin on 4July, and most commanders of the Christian army were captured on the battlefield.

Guy of Lusignan and Raynald were among the prisoners who were brought before Saladin. Saladin handed a cup of iced rose water to Guy. After drinking from the cup, the king handed it to Raynald. Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani (who was present) recorded that Raynald drank from the cup. Since customary law prescribed that a man who gave food or drink to a prisoner could not kill him, Saladin pointed out that it was Guy who had given the cup to Raynald. After calling Raynald to his tent, Saladin accused him of many crimes (including brigandage and blasphemy), offering him to choose between conversion to Islam or death, according to Imad ad-Din and Ibn al-Athir. After Raynald flatly refused to convert, Saladin took a sword and struck Raynald with it. As Raynald fell to the ground, Saladin beheaded him. The reliability of the reports of Saladin&#x27;s offer to Raynald is subject to scholarly debate, because the Muslim authors who recorded them may have only wanted to improve Saladin&#x27;s image. Ernoul&#x27;s chronicle and the recount the events ending with Raynald&#x27;s execution in almost the same language as the Muslim authors. However, according to Ernoul&#x27;s chronicle, Raynald refused to drink from the cup that Guy of Lusignan handed to him. According to Ernoul, Raynald&#x27;s head was struck off by Saladin&#x27;s soldiers and it was brought to Damascus to be &quot;dragged along the ground to show the Saracens, whom the prince had wronged, that vengeance had been exacted&quot;. Baha ad-Din also wrote that Raynald&#x27;s fate shocked Guy of Lusignan, but Saladin soon comforted him, stating that &quot;A king does not kill a king, but that man&#x27;s perfidy and insolence went too far&quot;.

== Family ==

Raynald&#x27;s first wife, Constance of Antioch (born in 1128), was the only daughter of Bohemond II of Antioch and Alice of Jerusalem. Constance succeeded her father in Antioch in 1130. Six years later, she was given in marriage to Raymond of Poitiers who died in 1149. The widowed Constance&#x27;s marriage to Raynald is described as &quot;the misalliance of the century&quot; by Hamilton, but Buck emphasises that &quot;the marriage went unmentioned in Western chronicles&quot;. Buck adds that Raynald&#x27;s relatively low birth &quot;actually made him the ideal candidate&quot; to marry the widowed princess who had a son with a strong claim to rule upon reaching the age of majority, and Raynald was possibly &quot;expected to eventually step aside&quot;. 

The daughter of Raynald and Constance, Agnes, moved to Constantinople in early 1170 to marry Alexios-Béla, the younger brother of Stephen III of Hungary, who lived in the Byzantine Empire. Agnes was renamed Anna in Constantinople. Her husband succeeded his brother as BélaIII of Hungary in 1172. She followed her husband to Hungary, where she gave birth to seven children before she died around 1184. Raynald and Constance&#x27;s second daughter, Alice, became the third wife of Azzo VI of Este in 1204. Raynald also had a son, Baldwin, from Constance, according to Hamilton and Buck, but Runciman says that Baldwin was Constance&#x27;s son from her first husband. Baldwin moved to Constantinople in the early 1160s. He died fighting at the head of a Byzantine cavalry regiment in the Battle of Myriokephalon on 17September 1176.

Raynald&#x27;s second wife, Stephanie of Milly, was the younger daughter of Philip of Milly, Lord of Nablus, and Isabella of Oultrejordain. She was born around 1145. Her first husband, HumphreyIII of Toron, died around 1173. She inherited Oultrejordain from her niece, Beatrice Brisbarre, shortly before she married Miles of Plancy in early 1174. Miles of Plancy was murdered in October 1174.

== Historiography and perceptions ==

Most information on Raynald&#x27;s life was recorded by Muslim authors, who were hostile to him. Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad described him as a &quot;monstrous infidel and terrible oppressor&quot; in his biography of Saladin. Saladin compared Raynald with the king of Ethiopia who had tried to destroy Mecca in 570 and was called the &quot;Elephant&quot; in the Surah Fil of the Quran. Ibn al-Athir described him as &quot;one of the most devilish of the Franks, and one of the most demonic&quot;, adding that Raynald &quot;had the strongest hostility to the Muslims&quot;. Islamic extremists still regard Raynald as a symbol of their enemies: one of the two mail bombs hidden in a cargo aircraft in 2010 was addressed to &quot;Reynald Krak&quot; in clear reference to him. 

Most Christian authors who wrote of Raynald in the 12th and 13th centuries were influenced by Raynald&#x27;s political opponent, William of Tyre. The author of the stated that Raynald&#x27;s attack against a caravan at the turn of 1186 and 1187 was the &quot;reason of the loss of the Kingdom of Jerusalem&quot;. Modern historians have usually also treated Raynald as a &quot;maverick who did more harm to the Christian than to the [Muslim] cause&quot;. Runciman describes him as a marauder who could not resist the temptation presented by the rich caravans passing through Oultrejordain. He argues that Raynald attacked a caravan during the 1180 truce because he &quot;could not understand a policy that ran counter to his wishes&quot;. Cobb introduces Raynald as the nemesis of Saladin&quot;, adding that Raynald&#x27;s provocative actions inevitably led to Saladin&#x27;s fatal invasion against the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Along with Guy of Lusignan and the Knights Templar, Raynald is one of the negative characters in the &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot;, an epic action movie directed by Ridley Scott and released in 2005. Portrayed by Brendan Gleeson, Raynald is presented in the film as an aggressive Christian fanatic who deliberately provokes a conflict with the Muslims to achieve their total destruction.

Some Christian authors regarded Raynald as a martyr for the faith. After learning of Raynald&#x27;s death from King Guy&#x27;s brother Geoffrey of Lusignan, Peter of Blois dedicated a book (entitled &quot;Passion of Prince Raynald of Antioch&quot;) to him shortly after his death. The &quot;Passion&quot; underlines that Raynald defended the True Cross at Hattin. Among modern historians, Hamilton portrays Raynald as &quot;an experienced and responsible crusader leader&quot; who made several attempts to prevent Saladin from uniting the Muslim realms along the borders of the crusader states. His comments are described by Cobb as &quot;attempts to dispel&quot; Raynald&#x27;s &quot;bad press&quot;. The historian Alex Mallett refers to Raynald&#x27;s naval expedition as &quot;one of the most extraordinary episodes in the history of the Crusades, and yet one of the most overlooked&quot;. In 2017, the journalist Jeffrey Lee published a biography about Raynald, entitled &quot;God&#x27;s Wolf&quot;, presenting him, according to the historian John Cotts, in a nearly hagiographic style as a loyal, valiant, and talented warrior. Lee&#x27;s book was praised by James Delingpole—a blogger associated with Breitbart—who attributed Raynald&#x27;s bad reputation in the Western world to &quot;cultural self-hatred&quot;, but historians such as Matthew Gabriele sharply criticised Lee&#x27;s approach. Gabriele concludes that Lee&#x27;s book &quot;does violence to the study of the past&quot; due to his uncritical use of primary sources and his obvious attempt to make a connection between medieval history and 21st-century politics.

<text>The moment of inertia, otherwise known as the mass moment of inertia, angular/rotational mass, second moment of mass, or most accurately, rotational inertia, of a rigid body is defined relative to a rotational axis. It is the ratio between the torque applied and the resulting angular acceleration about that axis. It plays the same role in rotational motion as mass does in linear motion. A body&#x27;s moment of inertia about a particular axis depends both on the mass and its distribution relative to the axis, increasing with mass &amp; distance from the axis.

It is an extensive (additive) property: for a point mass the moment of inertia is simply the mass times the square of the perpendicular distance to the axis of rotation. The moment of inertia of a rigid composite system is the sum of the moments of inertia of its component subsystems (all taken about the same axis). Its simplest definition is the second moment of mass with respect to distance from an axis.

For bodies constrained to rotate in a plane, only their moment of inertia about an axis perpendicular to the plane, a scalar value, matters. For bodies free to rotate in three dimensions, their moments can be described by a symmetric 3-by-3 matrix, with a set of mutually perpendicular principal axes for which this matrix is diagonal and torques around the axes act independently of each other.

In mechanical engineering, simply &quot;inertia&quot; is often used to refer to &quot;inertial mass&quot; or &quot;moment of inertia&quot;.

==Introduction==
When a body is free to rotate around an axis, torque must be applied to change its angular momentum. The amount of torque needed to cause any given angular acceleration (the rate of change in angular velocity) is proportional to the moment of inertia of the body. Moments of inertia may be expressed in units of kilogram metre squared (kg·m2) in SI units and pound-foot-second squared (lbf·ft·s2) in imperial or US units.

The moment of inertia plays the role in rotational kinetics that mass (inertia) plays in linear kinetics—both characterize the resistance of a body to changes in its motion. The moment of inertia depends on how mass is distributed around an axis of rotation, and will vary depending on the chosen axis. For a point-like mass, the moment of inertia about some axis is given by formula_1, where formula_2 is the distance of the point from the axis, and formula_3 is the mass. For an extended rigid body, the moment of inertia is just the sum of all the small pieces of mass multiplied by the square of their distances from the axis in rotation. For an extended body of a regular shape and uniform density, this summation sometimes produces a simple expression that depends on the dimensions, shape and total mass of the object.

In 1673, Christiaan Huygens introduced this parameter in his study of the oscillation of a body hanging from a pivot, known as a compound pendulum. The term &quot;moment of inertia&quot; (&quot;momentum inertiae&quot; in Latin) was introduced by Leonhard Euler in his book &quot;Theoria motus corporum solidorum seu rigidorum&quot; in 1765, and it is incorporated into Euler&#x27;s second law.

The natural frequency of oscillation of a compound pendulum is obtained from the ratio of the torque imposed by gravity on the mass of the pendulum to the resistance to acceleration defined by the moment of inertia. Comparison of this natural frequency to that of a simple pendulum consisting of a single point of mass provides a mathematical formulation for moment of inertia of an extended body.

The moment of inertia also appears in momentum, kinetic energy, and in Newton&#x27;s laws of motion for a rigid body as a physical parameter that combines its shape and mass. There is an interesting difference in the way moment of inertia appears in planar and spatial movement. Planar movement has a single scalar that defines the moment of inertia, while for spatial movement the same calculations yield a 3 × 3 matrix of moments of inertia, called the inertia matrix or inertia tensor.

The moment of inertia of a rotating flywheel is used in a machine to resist variations in applied torque to smooth its rotational output. The moment of inertia of an airplane about its longitudinal, horizontal and vertical axes determine how steering forces on the control surfaces of its wings, elevators and rudder(s) affect the plane&#x27;s motions in roll, pitch and yaw.

== Definition ==
The moment of inertia is defined as the product of mass of section and the square of the distance between the reference axis and the centroid of the section. 
The moment of inertia is also defined as the ratio of the net angular momentum of a system to its angular velocity around a principal axis, that is
formula_4

If the angular momentum of a system is constant, then as the moment of inertia gets smaller, the angular velocity must increase. This occurs when spinning figure skaters pull in their outstretched arms or divers curl their bodies into a tuck position during a dive, to spin faster.

If the shape of the body does not change, then its moment of inertia appears in Newton&#x27;s law of motion as the ratio of an applied torque on a body to the angular acceleration around a principal axis, that is
formula_5

For a simple pendulum, this definition yields a formula for the moment of inertia in terms of the mass of the pendulum and its distance from the pivot point as,
formula_6

Thus, the moment of inertia of the pendulum depends on both the mass of a body and its geometry, or shape, as defined by the distance to the axis of rotation.

This simple formula generalizes to define moment of inertia for an arbitrarily shaped body as the sum of all the elemental point masses each multiplied by the square of its perpendicular distance to an axis . An arbitrary object&#x27;s moment of inertia thus depends on the spatial distribution of its mass.

In general, given an object of mass , an effective radius can be defined, dependent on a particular axis of rotation, with such a value that its moment of inertia around the axis is
formula_7
where is known as the radius of gyration around the axis.

== Examples ==
=== Simple pendulum ===
Mathematically, the moment of inertia of a simple pendulum is the ratio of the torque due to gravity about the pivot of a pendulum to its angular acceleration about that pivot point. For a simple pendulum, this is found to be the product of the mass of the particle formula_3 with the square of its distance formula_2 to the pivot, that is
formula_6

This can be shown as follows:

The force of gravity on the mass of a simple pendulum generates a torque formula_11 around the axis perpendicular to the plane of the pendulum movement. Here formula_12 is the distance vector from the torque axis to the pendulum center of mass, and formula_13 is the net force on the mass. Associated with this torque is an angular acceleration, formula_14, of the string and mass around this axis. Since the mass is constrained to a circle the tangential acceleration of the mass is formula_15. Since formula_16 the torque equation becomes:
formula_17

where formula_18 is a unit vector perpendicular to the plane of the pendulum. (The second to last step uses the vector triple product expansion with the perpendicularity of formula_14 and formula_12.) The quantity formula_21 is the &quot;moment of inertia&quot; of this single mass around the pivot point.

The quantity formula_21 also appears in the angular momentum of a simple pendulum, which is calculated from the velocity formula_23 of the pendulum mass around the pivot, where formula_24 is the angular velocity of the mass about the pivot point. This angular momentum is given by
formula_25
using a similar derivation to the previous equation.

Similarly, the kinetic energy of the pendulum mass is defined by the velocity of the pendulum around the pivot to yield
formula_26

This shows that the quantity formula_21 is how mass combines with the shape of a body to define rotational inertia. The moment of inertia of an arbitrarily shaped body is the sum of the values formula_1 for all of the elements of mass in the body.

=== Compound pendulums ===

A compound pendulum is a body formed from an assembly of particles of continuous shape that rotates rigidly around a pivot. Its moment of inertia is the sum of the moments of inertia of each of the particles that it is composed of. The natural frequency (formula_29) of a compound pendulum depends on its moment of inertia, formula_30,
formula_31
where formula_3 is the mass of the object, formula_33 is local acceleration of gravity, and formula_2 is the distance from the pivot point to the center of mass of the object. Measuring this frequency of oscillation over small angular displacements provides an effective way of measuring moment of inertia of a body.

Thus, to determine the moment of inertia of the body, simply suspend it from a convenient pivot point formula_35 so that it swings freely in a plane perpendicular to the direction of the desired moment of inertia, then measure its natural frequency or period of oscillation (formula_36), to obtain
formula_37
where formula_36 is the period (duration) of oscillation (usually averaged over multiple periods).

====Center of oscillation====
A simple pendulum that has the same natural frequency as a compound pendulum defines the length formula_39 from the pivot to a point called the center of oscillation of the compound pendulum. This point also corresponds to the center of percussion. The length formula_39 is determined from the formula,
formula_41
or
formula_42

The seconds pendulum, which provides the &quot;tick&quot; and &quot;tock&quot; of a grandfather clock, takes one second to swing from side-to-side. This is a period of two seconds, or a natural frequency of formula_43 for the pendulum. In this case, the distance to the center of oscillation, formula_39, can be computed to be
formula_45

Notice that the distance to the center of oscillation of the seconds pendulum must be adjusted to accommodate different values for the local acceleration of gravity. Kater&#x27;s pendulum is a compound pendulum that uses this property to measure the local acceleration of gravity, and is called a gravimeter.

==Measuring moment of inertia==
The moment of inertia of a complex system such as a vehicle or airplane around its vertical axis can be measured by suspending the system from three points to form a trifilar pendulum. A trifilar pendulum is a platform supported by three wires designed to oscillate in torsion around its vertical centroidal axis. The period of oscillation of the trifilar pendulum yields the moment of inertia of the system.

== Moment of inertia of area ==
Moment of inertia of area is also known as the second moment of area and its physical meaning is completely different from the mass moment of inertia.

These calculations are commonly used in civil engineering for structural design of beams and columns. Cross-sectional areas calculated for vertical moment of the x-axis formula_46 and horizontal moment of the y-axis formula_47.&lt;br&gt;
Height (&quot;h&quot;) and breadth (&quot;b&quot;) are the linear measures, except for circles, which are effectively half-breadth derived, formula_2

=== Sectional areas moment calculated thus ===

# Square: formula_49
# Rectangular: formula_50 and; formula_51
# Triangular: formula_52
# Circular: formula_53

== Motion in a fixed plane ==
=== Point mass ===
The moment of inertia about an axis of a body is calculated by summing formula_1 for every particle in the body, where formula_2 is the perpendicular distance to the specified axis. To see how moment of inertia arises in the study of the movement of an extended body, it is convenient to consider a rigid assembly of point masses. (This equation can be used for axes that are not principal axes provided that it is understood that this does not fully describe the moment of inertia.)

Consider the kinetic energy of an assembly of formula_56 masses formula_57 that lie at the distances formula_58 from the pivot point formula_35, which is the nearest point on the axis of rotation. It is the sum of the kinetic energy of the individual masses,

formula_60

This shows that the moment of inertia of the body is the sum of each of the formula_1 terms, that is
formula_62

Thus, moment of inertia is a physical property that combines the mass and distribution of the particles around the rotation axis. Notice that rotation about different axes of the same body yield different moments of inertia.

The moment of inertia of a continuous body rotating about a specified axis is calculated in the same way, except with infinitely many point particles. Thus the limits of summation are removed, and the sum is written as follows:
formula_63

Another expression replaces the summation with an integral,
formula_64

Here, the function formula_65 gives the mass density at each point formula_66, formula_12 is a vector perpendicular to the axis of rotation and extending from a point on the rotation axis to a point formula_66 in the solid, and the integration is evaluated over the volume formula_69 of the body formula_70. The moment of inertia of a flat surface is similar with the mass density being replaced by its areal mass density with the integral evaluated over its area.

Note on second moment of area: The moment of inertia of a body moving in a plane and the second moment of area of a beam&#x27;s cross-section are often confused. The moment of inertia of a body with the shape of the cross-section is the second moment of this area about the formula_71-axis perpendicular to the cross-section, weighted by its density. This is also called the &quot;polar moment of the area&quot;, and is the sum of the second moments about the formula_72- and formula_73-axes. The stresses in a beam are calculated using the second moment of the cross-sectional area around either the formula_72-axis or formula_73-axis depending on the load.

==== Examples ====


The moment of inertia of a compound pendulum constructed from a thin disc mounted at the end of a thin rod that oscillates around a pivot at the other end of the rod, begins with the calculation of the moment of inertia of the thin rod and thin disc about their respective centers of mass.

* The moment of inertia of a thin rod with constant cross-section formula_76 and density formula_65 and with length formula_78 about a perpendicular axis through its center of mass is determined by integration. Align the formula_72-axis with the rod and locate the origin its center of mass at the center of the rod, then formula_80 where formula_81 is the mass of the rod.
* The moment of inertia of a thin disc of constant thickness formula_76, radius formula_83, and density formula_65 about an axis through its center and perpendicular to its face (parallel to its axis of rotational symmetry) is determined by integration. Align the formula_71-axis with the axis of the disc and define a volume element as formula_86, then formula_87 where formula_88 is its mass.
* The moment of inertia of the compound pendulum is now obtained by adding the moment of inertia of the rod and the disc around the pivot point formula_35 as, formula_90 where formula_39 is the length of the pendulum. Notice that the parallel axis theorem is used to shift the moment of inertia from the center of mass to the pivot point of the pendulum.

A list of moments of inertia formulas for standard body shapes provides a way to obtain the moment of inertia of a complex body as an assembly of simpler shaped bodies. The parallel axis theorem is used to shift the reference point of the individual bodies to the reference point of the assembly.
As one more example, consider the moment of inertia of a solid sphere of constant density about an axis through its center of mass. This is determined by summing the moments of inertia of the thin discs that can form the sphere whose centers are along the axis chosen for consideration. If the surface of the sphere is defined by the equation
formula_92

then the square of the radius formula_2 of the disc at the cross-section formula_71 along the formula_71-axis is
formula_96

Therefore, the moment of inertia of the sphere is the sum of the moments of inertia of the discs along the formula_71-axis,
formula_98
where formula_99 is the mass of the sphere.

=== Rigid body ===

If a mechanical system is constrained to move parallel to a fixed plane, then the rotation of a body in the system occurs around an axis formula_18 parallel to this plane. In this case, the moment of inertia of the mass in this system is a scalar known as the &quot;polar moment of inertia&quot;. The definition of the polar moment of inertia can be obtained by considering momentum, kinetic energy and Newton&#x27;s laws for the planar movement of a rigid system of particles.

If a system of formula_101 particles, formula_102, are assembled into a rigid body, then the momentum of the system can be written in terms of positions relative to a reference point formula_103, and absolute velocities formula_104:
formula_105
where formula_24 is the angular velocity of the system and formula_107 is the velocity of formula_103.

For planar movement the angular velocity vector is directed along the unit vector formula_109 which is perpendicular to the plane of movement. Introduce the unit vectors formula_110 from the reference point formula_103 to a point formula_112, and the unit vector formula_113, so
formula_114

This defines the relative position vector and the velocity vector for the rigid system of the particles moving in a plane.

Note on the cross product: When a body moves parallel to a ground plane, the trajectories of all the points in the body lie in planes parallel to this ground plane. This means that any rotation that the body undergoes must be around an axis perpendicular to this plane. Planar movement is often presented as projected onto this ground plane so that the axis of rotation appears as a point. In this case, the angular velocity and angular acceleration of the body are scalars and the fact that they are vectors along the rotation axis is ignored. This is usually preferred for introductions to the topic. But in the case of moment of inertia, the combination of mass and geometry benefits from the geometric properties of the cross product. For this reason, in this section on planar movement the angular velocity and accelerations of the body are vectors perpendicular to the ground plane, and the cross product operations are the same as used for the study of spatial rigid body movement.

====Angular momentum====
The angular momentum vector for the planar movement of a rigid system of particles is given by
formula_115

Use the center of mass formula_116 as the reference point so
formula_117

and define the moment of inertia relative to the center of mass formula_118 as
formula_119

then the equation for angular momentum simplifies to
formula_120

The moment of inertia formula_118 about an axis perpendicular to the movement of the rigid system and through the center of mass is known as the &quot;polar moment of inertia&quot;. Specifically, it is the second moment of mass with respect to the orthogonal distance from an axis (or pole).

For a given amount of angular momentum, a decrease in the moment of inertia results in an increase in the angular velocity. Figure skaters can change their moment of inertia by pulling in their arms. Thus, the angular velocity achieved by a skater with outstretched arms results in a greater angular velocity when the arms are pulled in, because of the reduced moment of inertia. A figure skater is not, however, a rigid body.

====Kinetic energy====

The kinetic energy of a rigid system of particles moving in the plane is given by
formula_122

Let the reference point be the center of mass formula_116 of the system so the second term becomes zero, and introduce the moment of inertia formula_118 so the kinetic energy is given by
formula_125

The moment of inertia formula_118 is the &quot;polar moment of inertia&quot; of the body.

====Newton&#x27;s laws====

Newton&#x27;s laws for a rigid system of formula_101 particles, formula_102, can be written in terms of a resultant force and torque at a reference point formula_103, to yield
formula_130
where formula_112 denotes the trajectory of each particle.

The kinematics of a rigid body yields the formula for the acceleration of the particle formula_132 in terms of the position formula_103 and acceleration formula_134 of the reference particle as well as the angular velocity vector formula_24 and angular acceleration vector formula_14 of the rigid system of particles as,
formula_137

For systems that are constrained to planar movement, the angular velocity and angular acceleration vectors are directed along formula_18 perpendicular to the plane of movement, which simplifies this acceleration equation. In this case, the acceleration vectors can be simplified by introducing the unit vectors formula_139 from the reference point formula_103 to a point formula_112 and the unit vectors formula_113, so
formula_143

This yields the resultant torque on the system as
formula_144

where formula_145, and formula_146 is the unit vector perpendicular to the plane for all of the particles formula_132.

Use the center of mass formula_116 as the reference point and define the moment of inertia relative to the center of mass formula_118, then the equation for the resultant torque simplifies to
formula_150

==Motion in space of a rigid body, and the inertia matrix==
The scalar moments of inertia appear as elements in a matrix when a system of particles is assembled into a rigid body that moves in three-dimensional space. This inertia matrix appears in the calculation of the angular momentum, kinetic energy and resultant torque of the rigid system of particles.

Let the system of formula_101 particles, formula_102 be located at the coordinates formula_112 with velocities formula_104 relative to a fixed reference frame. For a (possibly moving) reference point formula_103, the relative positions are
formula_156
and the (absolute) velocities are
formula_157
where formula_24 is the angular velocity of the system, and formula_159 is the velocity of formula_103.

===Angular momentum===
Note that the cross product can be equivalently written as matrix multiplication by combining the first operand and the operator into a skew-symmetric matrix, formula_161, constructed from the components of formula_162:
formula_163

The inertia matrix is constructed by considering the angular momentum, with the reference point formula_103 of the body chosen to be the center of mass formula_116:
formula_166
where the terms containing formula_159 (formula_168) sum to zero by the definition of center of mass.

Then, the skew-symmetric matrix formula_169 obtained from the relative position vector formula_170, can be used to define,
formula_171
where formula_172 defined by
formula_173
is the symmetric inertia matrix of the rigid system of particles measured relative to the center of mass formula_116.

===Kinetic energy===
The kinetic energy of a rigid system of particles can be formulated in terms of the center of mass and a matrix of mass moments of inertia of the system. Let the system of formula_101 particles formula_102 be located at the coordinates formula_112 with velocities formula_104, then the kinetic energy is
formula_179
where formula_170 is the position vector of a particle relative to the center of mass.

This equation expands to yield three terms
formula_181

Since the center of mass is defined by 
formula_182
, the second term in this equation is zero. Introduce the skew-symmetric matrix formula_169 so the kinetic energy becomes
formula_184

Thus, the kinetic energy of the rigid system of particles is given by
formula_185
where formula_172 is the inertia matrix relative to the center of mass and formula_187 is the total mass.

===Resultant torque===
The inertia matrix appears in the application of Newton&#x27;s second law to a rigid assembly of particles. The resultant torque on this system is,
formula_188
where formula_189 is the acceleration of the particle formula_132. The kinematics of a rigid body yields the formula for the acceleration of the particle formula_132 in terms of the position formula_103 and acceleration formula_193 of the reference point, as well as the angular velocity vector formula_24 and angular acceleration vector formula_14 of the rigid system as,
formula_196

Use the center of mass formula_116 as the reference point, and introduce the skew-symmetric matrix formula_198 to represent the cross product formula_199, to obtain
formula_200

The calculation uses the identity
formula_201
obtained from the Jacobi identity for the triple cross product as shown in the proof below:

Thus, the resultant torque on the rigid system of particles is given by
formula_202
where formula_172 is the inertia matrix relative to the center of mass.

===Parallel axis theorem===

The inertia matrix of a body depends on the choice of the reference point. There is a useful relationship between the inertia matrix relative to the center of mass formula_116 and the inertia matrix relative to another point formula_103. This relationship is called the parallel axis theorem.

Consider the inertia matrix formula_206 obtained for a rigid system of particles measured relative to a reference point formula_103, given by
formula_208

Let formula_116 be the center of mass of the rigid system, then
formula_210
where formula_211 is the vector from the center of mass formula_116 to the reference point formula_103. Use this equation to compute the inertia matrix,
formula_214

Distribute over the cross product to obtain
formula_215

The first term is the inertia matrix formula_172 relative to the center of mass. The second and third terms are zero by definition of the center of mass formula_116. And the last term is the total mass of the system multiplied by the square of the skew-symmetric matrix formula_218 constructed from formula_211.

The result is the parallel axis theorem,
formula_220
where formula_211 is the vector from the center of mass formula_116 to the reference point formula_103.

Note on the minus sign: By using the skew symmetric matrix of position vectors relative to the reference point, the inertia matrix of each particle has the form formula_224, which is similar to the formula_1 that appears in planar movement. However, to make this to work out correctly a minus sign is needed. This minus sign can be absorbed into the term formula_226, if desired, by using the skew-symmetry property of formula_227.

===Scalar moment of inertia in a plane===
The scalar moment of inertia, formula_228, of a body about a specified axis whose direction is specified by the unit vector formula_18 and passes through the body at a point formula_103 is as follows:
formula_231
where formula_206 is the moment of inertia matrix of the system relative to the reference point formula_103, and formula_169 is the skew symmetric matrix obtained from the vector formula_235.

This is derived as follows. Let a rigid assembly of formula_101 particles, formula_102, have coordinates formula_112. Choose formula_103 as a reference point and compute the moment of inertia around a line L defined by the unit vector formula_18 through the reference point formula_103, formula_242. The perpendicular vector from this line to the particle formula_132 is obtained from formula_244 by removing the component that projects onto formula_18.
formula_246
where formula_247 is the identity matrix, so as to avoid confusion with the inertia matrix, and formula_248 is the outer product matrix formed from the unit vector formula_18 along the line formula_39.

To relate this scalar moment of inertia to the inertia matrix of the body, introduce the skew-symmetric matrix formula_251 such that formula_252, then we have the identity
formula_253
noting that formula_18 is a unit vector.

The magnitude squared of the perpendicular vector is
formula_255

The simplification of this equation uses the triple scalar product identity
formula_256
where the dot and the cross products have been interchanged. Exchanging products, and simplifying by noting that formula_244 and formula_18 are orthogonal:
formula_259

Thus, the moment of inertia around the line formula_39 through formula_103 in the direction formula_18 is obtained from the calculation
formula_263
where formula_206 is the moment of inertia matrix of the system relative to the reference point formula_103.

This shows that the inertia matrix can be used to calculate the moment of inertia of a body around any specified rotation axis in the body.

== Inertia tensor ==

For the same object, different axes of rotation will have different moments of inertia about those axes. In general, the moments of inertia are not equal unless the object is symmetric about all axes. The moment of inertia tensor is a convenient way to summarize all moments of inertia of an object with one quantity. It may be calculated with respect to any point in space, although for practical purposes the center of mass is most commonly used.

=== Definition ===

For a rigid object of formula_56 point masses formula_267, the moment of inertia tensor is given by
formula_268

Its components are defined as
formula_269

where
* formula_270, formula_271 is equal to 1, 2 or 3 for formula_72, formula_73, and formula_71, respectively,
* formula_275 is the vector to the point mass formula_276 from the point about which the tensor is calculated and
* formula_277 is the Kronecker delta.

Note that, by the definition, formula_278 is a symmetric tensor.

The diagonal elements are more succinctly written as
formula_279

while the off-diagonal elements, also called the , are
formula_280

Here formula_46 denotes the moment of inertia around the formula_72-axis when the objects are rotated around the x-axis, formula_283 denotes the moment of inertia around the formula_73-axis when the objects are rotated around the formula_72-axis, and so on.

These quantities can be generalized to an object with distributed mass, described by a mass density function, in a similar fashion to the scalar moment of inertia. One then has
formula_286

where formula_287 is their outer product, E3 is the 3×3 identity matrix, and &quot;V&quot; is a region of space completely containing the object.

Alternatively it can also be written in terms of the angular momentum operator formula_288:
formula_289

The inertia tensor can be used in the same way as the inertia matrix to compute the scalar moment of inertia about an arbitrary axis in the direction formula_290,
formula_291

where the dot product is taken with the corresponding elements in the component tensors. A product of inertia term such as formula_292 is obtained by the computation
formula_293
and can be interpreted as the moment of inertia around the formula_72-axis when the object rotates around the formula_73-axis.

The components of tensors of degree two can be assembled into a matrix. For the inertia tensor this matrix is given by,
formula_296

It is common in rigid body mechanics to use notation that explicitly identifies the formula_72, formula_73, and formula_71-axes, such as formula_46 and formula_283, for the components of the inertia tensor.

=== Alternate inertia convention ===
There are some CAD and CAE applications such as SolidWorks, Unigraphics NX/Siemens NX and MSC Adams that use an alternate convention for the products of inertia. According to this convention, the minus sign is removed from the product of inertia formulas and instead inserted in the inertia matrix:
formula_302

==== Determine inertia convention (Principal axes method) ====
If one has the inertia data formula_303 without knowing which inertia convention that has been used, it can be determined if one also has the principal axes. With the principal axes method, one makes inertia matrices from the following two assumptions:

# The standard inertia convention has been used formula_304. 
# The alternate inertia convention has been used formula_305. 
Next, one calculates the eigenvectors for the two matrices. The matrix whose eigenvectors are parallel to the principal axes corresponds to the inertia convention that has been used.

=== Derivation of the tensor components ===

The distance formula_2 of a particle at formula_307 from the axis of rotation passing through the origin in the formula_308 direction is formula_309, where formula_308 is unit vector. The moment of inertia on the axis is
formula_311

Rewrite the equation using matrix transpose:

formula_312

where E3 is the 3×3 identity matrix.

This leads to a tensor formula for the moment of inertia

formula_313

For multiple particles, we need only recall that the moment of inertia is additive in order to see that this formula is correct.

=== Inertia tensor of translation ===

Let formula_314 be the inertia tensor of a body calculated at its center of mass, and formula_103 be the displacement vector of the body. The inertia tensor of the translated body respect to its original center of mass is given by:
formula_316
where formula_3 is the body&#x27;s mass, E3 is the 3 × 3 identity matrix, and formula_318 is the outer product.

=== Inertia tensor of rotation ===

Let formula_103 be the matrix that represents a body&#x27;s rotation. The inertia tensor of the rotated body is given by:
formula_320

== Inertia matrix in different reference frames ==
The use of the inertia matrix in Newton&#x27;s second law assumes its components are computed relative to axes parallel to the inertial frame and not relative to a body-fixed reference frame. This means that as the body moves the components of the inertia matrix change with time. In contrast, the components of the inertia matrix measured in a body-fixed frame are constant.

===Body frame===
Let the body frame inertia matrix relative to the center of mass be denoted formula_321, and define the orientation of the body frame relative to the inertial frame by the rotation matrix formula_134, such that,
formula_323
where vectors formula_324 in the body fixed coordinate frame have coordinates formula_307 in the inertial frame. Then, the inertia matrix of the body measured in the inertial frame is given by
formula_326

Notice that formula_134 changes as the body moves, while formula_321 remains constant.

===Principal axes===
Measured in the body frame, the inertia matrix is a constant real symmetric matrix. A real symmetric matrix has the eigendecomposition into the product of a rotation matrix formula_329 and a diagonal matrix formula_330, given by
formula_331
where
formula_332

The columns of the rotation matrix formula_329 define the directions of the principal axes of the body, and the constants formula_334, formula_335, and formula_336 are called the principal moments of inertia. This result was first shown by J. J. Sylvester (1852), and is a form of Sylvester&#x27;s law of inertia. The principal axis with the highest moment of inertia is sometimes called the figure axis or axis of figure.

A toy top is an example of a rotating rigid body, and the word &quot;top&quot; is used in the names of types of rigid bodies. When all principal moments of inertia are distinct, the principal axes through center of mass are uniquely specified and the rigid body is called an asymmetric top. If two principal moments are the same, the rigid body is called a symmetric top and there is no unique choice for the two corresponding principal axes. If all three principal moments are the same, the rigid body is called a spherical top (although it need not be spherical) and any axis can be considered a principal axis, meaning that the moment of inertia is the same about any axis.

The principal axes are often aligned with the object&#x27;s symmetry axes. If a rigid body has an axis of symmetry of order formula_3, meaning it is symmetrical under rotations of about the given axis, that axis is a principal axis. When formula_338, the rigid body is a symmetric top. If a rigid body has at least two symmetry axes that are not parallel or perpendicular to each other, it is a spherical top, for example, a cube or any other Platonic solid.

The motion of vehicles is often described in terms of yaw, pitch, and roll which usually correspond approximately to rotations about the three principal axes. If the vehicle has bilateral symmetry then one of the principal axes will correspond exactly to the transverse (pitch) axis.

A practical example of this mathematical phenomenon is the routine automotive task of balancing a tire, which basically means adjusting the distribution of mass of a car wheel such that its principal axis of inertia is aligned with the axle so the wheel does not wobble.

Rotating molecules are also classified as asymmetric, symmetric, or spherical tops, and the structure of their rotational spectra is different for each type.

===Ellipsoid===

The moment of inertia matrix in body-frame coordinates is a quadratic form that defines a surface in the body called Poinsot&#x27;s ellipsoid. Let formula_330 be the inertia matrix relative to the center of mass aligned with the principal axes, then the surface
formula_340
or
formula_341
defines an ellipsoid in the body frame. Write this equation in the form,
formula_342
to see that the semi-principal diameters of this ellipsoid are given by
formula_343

Let a point formula_307 on this ellipsoid be defined in terms of its magnitude and direction, formula_345, where formula_290 is a unit vector. Then the relationship presented above, between the inertia matrix and the scalar moment of inertia formula_347 around an axis in the direction formula_290, yields
formula_349

Thus, the magnitude of a point formula_307 in the direction formula_290 on the inertia ellipsoid is
formula_352

<doc id="157702" wikidata="Q312904" url="?curid=157702" title="Fulk, King of Jerusalem">
<text>Fulk (, or &quot;Foulques&quot;; – 13 November 1143), also known as Fulk the Younger, was King of Jerusalem with his wife, Queen Melisende, from 1131 until his death in 1143. Previously, he was Count of Anjou, as Fulk V, from 1109 to 1129. During Fulk&#x27;s reign, the Kingdom of Jerusalem reached its largest territorial extent.

==Count of Anjou==
Fulk was born at Angers, between 1089 and 1092, the son of Count Fulk IV of Anjou and Bertrade de Montfort. In 1092, Bertrade deserted her husband, and bigamously married King Philip I of France. In 1109, Fulk V became count of Anjou upon his father&#x27;s death. In the next year, he married Countess Erembourg (or Ermengarde) of Maine, cementing Angevin control over the County of Maine.

Fulk was originally an opponent of King Henry I of England and a supporter of King Louis VI of France, but in 1118 or 1119 he allied with Henry when he arranged for his daughter Matilda of Anjou to marry Henry&#x27;s son William Adelin. Fulk went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1119 or 1120 and became attached to the Knights Templar. He returned, late in 1121, after which he began to subsidize the Templars, maintaining two knights in the Holy Land for a year. Much later, Henry arranged for his own daughter Matilda to marry Fulk&#x27;s son Geoffrey V of Anjou, which she did in 1127 or 1128.

==Crusader and king==
By 1127, Fulk was preparing to return to Anjou when he received an embassy from King Baldwin II of Jerusalem. Baldwin II had no male heirs but had already designated his daughter Melisende to succeed him. Baldwin II wanted to safeguard his daughter&#x27;s inheritance by marrying her to a powerful lord. Fulk was a wealthy crusader, an experienced military commander, and a widower. His experience in the field would prove invaluable in a frontier state always in the grip of war.

Fulk held out for better terms than a mere consort of the queen. He wanted to be king alongside Melisende. Baldwin II, reflecting on Fulk&#x27;s fortune and military exploits, acquiesced. Fulk abdicated his county seat of Anjou to his son Geoffrey and left for Jerusalem, where he married Melisende on 2 June 1129. Later Baldwin II bolstered Melisende&#x27;s position in the kingdom by making her sole guardian of her son by Fulk, Baldwin III, born in 1130.

In 1131, Fulk and Melisende became joint rulers of Jerusalem after Baldwin II&#x27;s death. From the start Fulk assumed sole control of the government, excluding Melisende altogether. He favoured fellow countrymen from Anjou to the native nobility. The other Crusader states to the north feared that Fulk would attempt to impose the suzerainty of Jerusalem over them, as Baldwin II had done. 

As Fulk was far less powerful than his deceased father-in-law, the northern states rejected his authority. Melisende&#x27;s sister Alice of Antioch, exiled from the Principality by Baldwin II, took control of Antioch once more after the death of her father. In 1132, she allied with Pons of Tripoli and Joscelin II of Edessa to prevent Fulk from marching north. Fulk and Pons fought a brief battle before peace was made and Alice was exiled again.

In Jerusalem as well, Fulk was resented by the second generation of Jerusalem Christians who had grown up there since the First Crusade. These natives focused on Melisende&#x27;s cousin, the popular Hugh II of Le Puiset, count of Jaffa, who was devotedly loyal to Melisende. Fulk saw Hugh as a rival, and it did not help matters when Hugh&#x27;s own stepson accused him of disloyalty. 

In 1134, in order to expose Hugh, Fulk accused him of infidelity with Melisende. Hugh rebelled in protest. Hugh secured himself to Jaffa and allied himself with the Muslims of Ascalon. He was able to defeat the army set against him by Fulk, but this situation could not hold. The patriarch Willam of Malines interceded in the conflict, perhaps at the behest of Melisende. Fulk agreed to peace and Hugh was exiled from the kingdom for three years, a lenient sentence.

However, an assassination attempt was made against Hugh. Fulk, or his supporters, were commonly believed responsible, though direct proof never surfaced. The scandal was all that was needed for the queen&#x27;s party to take over the government in what amounted to a palace coup. Author and historian wrote that Fulk&#x27;s supporters &quot;went in terror of their lives&quot; in the palace. 

Contemporary author and historian William of Tyre wrote of Fulk: &quot;He never attempted to take the initiative, even in trivial matters, without (Melisende&#x27;s) consent.&quot; The result was that Melisende held direct and unquestioned control over the government from 1136 onwards. Sometime before 1136, Fulk reconciled with his wife, and a second son, Amalric, was born.

==Securing the borders==
Jerusalem&#x27;s northern border was of great concern. Fulk had been appointed regent of the Principality of Antioch by Baldwin II. As regent, he had Raymond of Poitou marry the infant princess Constance of Antioch, his and Melisende&#x27;s niece. However, the greatest concern during Fulk&#x27;s reign was the rise of Zengi, atabeg of Mosul.

In 1137, Fulk was defeated in battle near Baarin but allied with Mu&#x27;in ad-Din Unur, the vizier of Damascus. Damascus was also threatened by Zengi. Fulk captured the fort of Banias, to the north of Lake Tiberias and thus secured the northern frontier.

Fulk also strengthened the kingdom&#x27;s southern border. His butler Paganus built the fortress of Kerak to the east of the Dead Sea. To help give the kingdom access to the Red Sea, Fulk had Blanchegarde, Ibelin, and other forts built in the south-west to overpower the Egyptian fortress at Ascalon. This city was a base from which the Egyptian Fatimids launched frequent raids on the Kingdom of Jerusalem and Fulk sought to neutralise this threat.

In 1137 and 1142, Byzantine emperor John II Comnenus arrived in Syria attempting to impose Byzantine control over the crusader states. John&#x27;s intention of making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, accompanied by his impressive army, alarmed Fulk, who wrote to John pointing out that his kingdom was poor and could not support the passage of a large army. This lukewarm response dissuaded John from carrying through his intention, and he postponed his pilgrimage. John died before he could make good his proposed journey to Jerusalem.

==Death==
In 1143, while the king and queen were in Acre, Fulk was killed in a hunting accident. His horse stumbled, fell, and Fulk&#x27;s skull was crushed by the saddle, &quot;and his brains gushed forth from both ears and nostrils&quot;, as William of Tyre describes. He was carried back to Acre, where he lay unconscious for three days before he died. He was buried in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. 

Though their marriage started in conflict, Melisende mourned for him privately as well as publicly. 

A marble panel from his tomb (or Baldwin III&#x27;s) is in the Terra Sancta Museum, Jerusalem. The panel includes rosettes, one of which has a cross pattée in its center.

==Legacy==

===Depictions===
According to William of Tyre, Fulk was &quot;a ruddy man, like David... faithful and gentle, affable and kind... an experienced warrior full of patience and wisdom in military affairs.&quot; His chief fault was an inability to remember names and faces.

William described Fulk as a capable soldier and able politician but observed that Fulk did not adequately attend to the defence of the crusader states to the north. Ibn al-Qalanisi, who calls him &quot;al-Kund Anjur&quot;, an Arabic rendering of &quot;Count of Anjou&quot;, says that &quot;he was not sound in his judgment nor was he successful in his administration.&quot; The Zengids continued their march on the crusader states, culminating in the fall of the county after the Siege of Edessa in 1144, which led to the Second Crusade.

===Family===
In 1110, Fulk married Erembourg/Ermengarde of Maine (died 1126), the daughter of Elias I of Maine. They had:
# Geoffrey V of Anjou (1113–1151), father of Henry II of England.
# Sibylla of Anjou (1112–1165, Bethlehem), married in 1123 William Clito (div. 1124), married in 1134 Thierry, Count of Flanders.
# Matilda of Anjou (c.1111–1154, Fontevrault), married William Adelin; after his death on the &quot;White Ship&quot; disaster of 1120, she became a nun and later Abbess of Fontevrault
# Elias II of Maine (died 1151)

His second wife was Melisende, Queen of Jerusalem. They married in 1129 and had two children:
# Baldwin III of Jerusalem
# Amalric of Jerusalem

<doc id="157703" wikidata="Q1217073" url="?curid=157703" title="Battle of Neresheim">
<text>The Battle of Neresheim (11 August 1796) was fought by the Republican French army under Jean Victor Marie Moreau against the army of the Habsburg monarchy of Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen. Pursued by Moreau&#x27;s &quot;Army of Rhin-et-Moselle&quot;, Charles launched an attack against the French. While the Austrian left wing saw some success, the battle degenerated into a stalemate and the archduke withdrew further into the Electorate of Bavaria. Neresheim is located in the state of Baden-Württemberg in Germany a distance of northeast of Ulm. The action took place during the War of the First Coalition, part of a larger conflict called the French Revolutionary Wars.

In the Rhine Campaign of 1796, two French armies successfully breached the Rhine River to invade Germany, Moreau&#x27;s army in the south and Jean-Baptiste Jourdan&#x27;s &quot;Army of Sambre-et-Meuse&quot; in the north. The French armies operated independently while Charles commanded both Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour&#x27;s &quot;Army of the Upper Rhine&quot; in the south and Wilhelm von Wartensleben&#x27;s &quot;Army of the Lower Rhine&quot; in the north. Charles hoped to concentrate superior strength against one of the two French armies. To keep his enemies separated, the archduke wished to lure Moreau south of the Danube River by crossing to the south bank. To allow his columns to cross the river safely, Charles attacked the French, hoping to push them back. Though he failed to defeat the French, the battle gave the archduke enough space to get his troops over the Danube without interference. Though he had a chance to join his army to Jourdan&#x27;s in the north, Moreau soon crossed to the south bank in pursuit.

==Background==
On 8 June 1796, the &quot;Army of Rhin-et-Moselle&quot; commanded by Jean Victor Marie Moreau numbered 71,581 foot soldiers and 6,515 cavalry, not counting artillerists. The army was formed into a Right Wing under Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino, a Center led by Louis Desaix and a Left Wing directed by Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr. Ferino&#x27;s three divisions were led by François Antoine Louis Bourcier, 9,281 infantry and 690 cavalry, Henri François Delaborde, 8,300 infantry and 174 cavalry and Augustin Tuncq, 7,437 infantry and 432 cavalry. Desaix&#x27;s three divisions were commanded by Michel de Beaupuy, 14,565 infantry and 1,266 cavalry, Antoine Guillaume Delmas, 7,898 infantry and 865 cavalry, and Charles Antoine Xaintrailles, 4,828 infantry and 962 cavalry. Saint-Cyr&#x27;s two divisions were under Guillaume Philibert Duhesme, 7,438 infantry and 895 cavalry, and Alexandre Camille Taponier, 11,823 infantry and 1,231 cavalry. With artillerymen, Moreau&#x27;s host counted a total of 79,592 soldiers.

Originally, the &quot;Army of Rhin-et-Moselle&quot; was opposed by 82,776 Austrians and allies under Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser. But 25,330 Austrians were soon transferred to Italy and Wurmser went with this force on 18 June. Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour was appointed the new commander of the &quot;Army of the Upper Rhine&quot;. The former leader of the &quot;Army of the Lower Rhine&quot;, Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen was replaced by Wilhelm von Wartensleben so he could take overall command of both Austrian armies.

On 24 June 1796, the &quot;Army of Rhin-et-Moselle&quot; mounted a successful assault crossing of the Rhine River in the Battle of Kehl. The French sustained losses of 150 killed, wounded and missing out of 10,065 engaged. The Swabian Regional Contingent defenders numbered 7,000 soldiers in eight foot battalions, eight horse squadrons and two artillery batteries. The Swabians suffered over 700 casualties and lost 14 guns and 22 munition wagons. Moreau&#x27;s forces inflicted a second defeat on a force of 9,000 Swabians and their Austrian allies under Anton Sztáray at Renchen on 28 June. This time the French reported only 200 casualties while inflicting 550 killed and wounded on their enemies. In addition, the French captured 850 soldiers, seven guns and two munition wagons. During this period of maneuvering, Moreau switched the positions of two of his wings. Ferino still commanded the Right Wing, but Desaix now commanded the Left Wing while Saint-Cyr led the Center.

On 30 June, Latour&#x27;s &quot;Army of the Upper Rhine&quot; was divided into a Left Wing under Michael von Fröhlich, a Center led by Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg and a Right Wing that Latour personally controlled. Fröhlich&#x27;s wing was made up of eight battalions and 12 squadrons of Austrians organized in two brigades. Fürstenberg&#x27;s command consisted of 17 battalions, five companies and 10 squadrons, including Swabians and Bavarians, organized into five brigades. Latour&#x27;s wing had 25 battalions and 58 squadrons organized into five divisions under Prince von Fürstemberg, Johann Mészáros von Szoboszló, Johann Sigismund Riesch, Karl von Riese, and Sztáray. There were an additional six battalions and six squadrons holding Mannheim and one battalion garrisoning Philippsburg. Archduke Charles was approaching with an Austrian division under Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze and a Saxon division under General von Lindt. Hotze directed 16 battalions and 20 squadrons in three brigades while Lindt commanded nine battalions and 19 squadrons in five brigades.

With Desaix on the left and Saint-Cyr on the right, Moreau pressed north up the east bank of the Rhine to the Murg River. The French thrust severed Austrians under Fröhlich and French Royalists under Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé from the remainder of Latour&#x27;s army. Ferino&#x27;s wing pursued Fröhlich and Condé to the southeast and seized the region around Freiburg im Breisgau. On the Murg, Desaix won a minor victory over Latour in the Battle of Rastatt. By this time, Archduke Charles arrived from the north with 20,000 reinforcements. The archduke planned to attack on 10 July, but Moreau preempted him by one day. In the Battle of Ettlingen on the 9th, both commanders tried to hold with their left wings and attack with their right. On Moreau&#x27;s right, Saint-Cyr was successful in driving back Konrad Valentin von Kaim&#x27;s Austrians near Frauenalb while Taponier&#x27;s division pushed back Lindt&#x27;s Saxons near Neuenbürg. On the French left, Desaix captured Malsch twice but was ultimately driven out. Despite having won the battle on his right flank, Charles feared Saint-Cyr&#x27;s advance might cut him off from his supply base at Heilbronn so the archduke ordered a retreat to the east.

Archduke Charles stopped long enough at Pforzheim to transfer his military stores to the army&#x27;s wagon train. Moreau was surprised by his foe&#x27;s decision to disengage and took several days to digest this information. The French commander planned to attack Pforzheim on 15 July, but by that date Charles was retreating farther to the east. On 21 July, there was a skirmish at Cannstatt near Stuttgart. There were 8,000 Austrians in nine battalions and eight squadrons involved in the clash. From Cannstatt, Charles retreated toward Schwäbisch Gmünd with Moreau following his enemies at a leisurely pace. Meanwhile, the isolated Austrian left wing withdrew through Villingen with Ferino in pursuit. The Swabians and Bavarian began negotiations with the French to quit the war while the Saxons marched away to the north to join Wartensleben&#x27;s army. When Charles left the banks of the Rhine he left behind 30,000 troops in garrisons at Mannheim, Philippsburg, Mainz, Königstein im Taunus and Ehrenbreitstein Fortress. On 29 July at Biberach an der Riss, the Swabian Regional Contingent was disarmed by Fröhlich on the instructions of Charles. These subtractions left Charles with only three-quarters of the strength of Moreau. On 2 August, Moreau&#x27;s troops bumped into the Austrians at Geislingen an der Steige and for a week afterward there was constant skirmishing with Charles&#x27; rear guard. Saint-Cyr occupied the city of Ulm on 8 August 1796. Two days later, Charles was joined by his left wing. At this time Ferino was at Memmingen to the south of the Danube.

==Battle==
On 13 July in Desaix&#x27;s Left Wing, the division of Delmas consisted of the 50th and 97th Line and 16th Light Infantry Demi-Brigades and four squadrons each of the 7th Hussar and 10th and 17th Dragoon Regiments. Delmas&#x27; brigade commanders were Jean Marie Rodolph Eickemayer, who had been recruited from Mainz, and Maurice Frimont. The division of Beaupuy was made up of the 10th, 62nd and 103rd Line and the 10th Light Demi-Brigades, 4th and 8th Chasseurs à Cheval and the 6th Dragoons. Beaupuy&#x27;s brigadiers were Gilles Joseph Martin Brunteau Saint-Suzanne and Dominique Joba. Bourcier&#x27;s Reserve division comprised the 93rd and 109th Line, the 1st and 2nd Carabiniers and the 2nd, 3rd, 9th, 14th and 15th Cavalry Regiments. All demi-brigades had three battalions, all Cavalry regiments had three squadrons, while the Carabiniers, Chasseurs, Dragoons and Hussars had four squadrons.

A report from 7 August 1796 showed that Saint-Cyr shuffled the brigades in the Center so that Duhesme&#x27;s division had only one while Taponier had the other three. In Duhesme&#x27;s division, Dominique Vandamme&#x27;s brigade was made up of the 17th and 100th Line Infantry Demi-brigades, two squadrons of the 20th Chasseurs à Cheval and a detachment of the 11th Hussars, a total of 5,272 infantry and 292 cavalry. Taponier&#x27;s division included the brigades of Antoine Laroche Dubouscat, Claude Lecourbe and Henri François Lambert. Laroche directed 5,124 soldiers of the 21st Light and 31st Line Infantry, Lecourbe commanded 5,878 men of the 84th and 106th Line and Lambert controlled 5,888 troops of the 93rd and 109th Line. Two squadrons of 240 sabers from the 2nd Chasseurs à Cheval were attached to Lecourbe&#x27;s brigade. Altogether, there were 22,162 foot soldiers, 532 horsemen and 433 gunners in Saint-Cyr&#x27;s command. In addition to the other units, the 9th Hussars were normally attached to Taponier&#x27;s division.

Archduke Charles wished to prevent the army of Moreau from joining with his colleague Jean-Baptiste Jourdan and the &quot;Army of Sambre-et-Meuse&quot;. The Austrian commander hoped to withdraw to the south bank of the Danube but the &quot;Army of Rhin-et-Moselle&quot; was following too closely. By attacking Moreau, the archduke hoped to push the French back in order to prevent their two armies from merging and to give his own troops enough room to cross the Danube safely. Also, he wanted to lure Moreau into crossing the Danube and separating himself from Jourdan. Moreau&#x27;s army was extended across a front wide. Charles drew up plans to attack on 11 August. He sent one column to cross to the north bank of the Danube at Günzburg to get behind the French right flank. His troops were ready to move at midnight, but heavy rains slowed several of his assault columns. On the 10th Saint-Cyr with Taponier&#x27;s division, drove the Austrians in his front out of the village of Eglingen. Urged on by Moreau, Saint-Cyr balked because he believed that the enemy were in strength nearby. Before anything more could be done, the heavy rain began and made it impossible to fire the cannons on both sides. Moreau refused to let his subordinate withdraw to a more defensible position or to order Duhesme&#x27;s division to move closer. The only concession Moreau would make was to send up one regiment of Carabiniers to patrol in front of Taponier. To be on the safe side, Saint-Cyr stationed Lecourbe and one demi brigade at Dischingen where there was a bridge over the Egau River. Meanwhile, Duhesme stayed well to the south at Medlingen in the Danube valley.

The Austrian archduke commanded 43,000 men while Moreau led 44,737 troops. Charles massed his main strength against Saint-Cyr, who commanded 30,426 soldiers if the nearby Reserve was included. On the right flank, Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein led the Advance Guard while Sztáray led the Reserve. They would operate against Bopfingen and seize the Neresheim-Nördlingen road. Charles personally led 5,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry on Dunstelkingen in the center. To Charles&#x27; immediate right, Hotze directed 7,500 foot and 1,800 horse toward Kösingen and Schweindorf. To Charles&#x27; immediate left, Latour&#x27;s 5,500 troops would clear Eglingen and Dischingen. On the left flank, Fröhlich was in charge of the force that would cross the Danube behind the French right flank. He would cooperate with Riese&#x27;s troops. The outnumbered Duhesme was to be assailed by 7,000 infantry and 2,400 cavalry. Once they crushed the French right flank, 3,000 men under Karl Mercandin were to attack Dischingen while the rest were supposed to circle behind Moreau&#x27;s army and keep it from escaping.

The sudden Austrian advance at dawn caused the 150-strong regiment of Carabiniers to retreat at the gallop. Saint-Cyr&#x27;s light cavalry, led by Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty, lost heart at seeing the heavy cavalry fleeing and fell back, leaving the French infantry at Eglingen without support. The Austrian horse fell on the flank of Lambert&#x27;s brigade, routing its six battalions. This left Taponier&#x27;s division with 12 battalions to face Charles&#x27; assault. At this moment Moreau arrived at Saint-Cyr&#x27;s headquarters. Before riding off to consult with Desaix, the French army commander placed Bourcier&#x27;s division in support nearby and agreed to have the Left Wing attack the Austrian right flank. Saint-Cyr deployed nine battalions at Dunstelkingen while keeping Lecourbe&#x27;s three battalions to protect his right rear at Dischingen. At 9:00 AM the Austrians attacked this position but were beaten back. Their artillery set Dunstelkingen on fire but this actually helped prevent the Austrians from advancing. Moreau then returned from his meeting with Desaix to inform Saint-Cyr that the Left Wing&#x27;s attack would be delayed until Delmas&#x27; division could be recalled from the extreme left.

Hotze seized Kösingen but found himself facing a new French line on high ground between him and Neresheim. He attacked this position but was repulsed by Desaix. On Hotze&#x27;s right, Honoré Théodore Maxime Gazan drove the Austrians back to Schweindorf. The Austrians took Bopfingen but found that the French were moving south to assist the center. The clash at Bopfingen was fought by the &quot;Duke Albert&quot; Carabinier Regiment Nr. 5 and the &quot;Siebenburger&quot; Hussar Regiment Nr. 47. Desaix had little trouble fending off these advances. But a message came from the far right that said Duhesme&#x27;s division was in trouble. Riese attacked Duhesme at Medlingen, forcing him to retreat. A large force of Austrian cavalry reached Giengen to block the French retreat, but Duhesme escaped to the northwest. Mercandin ended the day short of Dischingen and Riese moved west to Heidenheim an der Brenz rather than making a sweep into the French rear. Fröhlich&#x27;s column only got as far as Albeck, north of Ulm. Duhesme&#x27;s division lost some cannons and was not able to rejoin Saint-Cyr for three days. The Center&#x27;s artillery park at Heidenheim hurriedly displaced north to Aalen. This left Saint-Cyr&#x27;s troops with no reserve artillery ammunition and dependent on supply from Bourcier&#x27;s small artillery park. Moreau appeared a third time at Saint-Cyr&#x27;s headquarters promising that Desaix would soon attack the Austrian right flank. Though Saint-Cyr was in a tight spot, in fact, Charles became anxious about Moreau&#x27;s commitment of the French Reserve.

The Austrians declined to launch any more serious assaults on Taponier&#x27;s division and by 1:00 PM the contest degenerated into an artillery duel. Part of Lambert&#x27;s brigade was rallied and reoccupied Heidenheim. The Austrians threatening the French right flank began withdrawing to Dillingen an der Donau. For the fourth time that day Moreau came to see Saint-Cyr, this time accompanied by Desaix. They informed their colleague that Delmas&#x27; division was not available yet and it was too late to attack the Austrian right that day. Everything would be ready the next day. Charles hoped that Moreau might concede defeat, but the morning of 12 August found the French army still in position. Charles then gave the order to fall back. Worried about the artillery ammunition shortage, Moreau did not attack Charles&#x27; right, but neither did he panic and retreat. Instead he held his position all day on the 12th waiting for confirmation that the Austrians were withdrawing across the Danube.

Besides the two cavalry regiments that fought at Bopfingen, the Austrian units that came into action were four battalions of Infantry Regiments &quot;Reisky&quot; Nr. 13 and &quot;Slavonier&quot; Grenz, three battalions each of Infantry Regiments &quot;Manfredini&quot; Nr. 12, &quot;Nádasdy&quot; Nr. 39 and &quot;Kinsky&quot; Nr. 47, two battalions of Infantry Regiment &quot;Schröder&quot; Nr. 7, one battalion each of Infantry regiments &quot;Archduke Charles&quot; Nr. 3, &quot;Alton&quot; Nr. 15 and &quot;Ligne&quot; Nr. 30, the &quot;Apfaltrern&quot;, &quot;Candiani&quot;, &quot;Pietsch&quot; and &quot;Retz&quot; Grenadier Battalions, elements of &quot;Archduke Ferdinand&quot; Hussar Regiment Nr. 32 and four squadrons of the &quot;Archduke Franz&quot; Cuirassier Regiment Nr. 29.

==Results==
According to one source that called the battle a French victory, the Austrians lost 1,100 killed and wounded plus 500 captured while the French suffered 1,200 killed and wounded plus 1,200 captured. Another authority characterized the action as a &quot;drawn battle&quot; and stated that casualties numbered 3,000 on each side. The Austrian retreat was not molested by the French, which was one of the reasons why Charles fought the battle. The Austrian army crossed the Danube at Dillingen and Donauwörth, destroying all the bridges behind them. Furious with Duhesme for retreating, Moreau removed him from command of his division. Saint-Cyr persuaded him to rescind the order a few days later.

Moreau deserved criticism for spreading his forces too widely but he can be credited for keeping his composure despite the defeat of Duhesme. But Moreau now fell into a fatal strategic error. Charles entertained a desire to combine forces with Wartensleben at the earliest opportunity in order to defeat Jourdan&#x27;s army. When Charles withdrew to the south bank of the Danube, he left Moreau free to stay on the north bank and join with Jourdan. Charles hoped to lure his opponent onto the south bank which would take Moreau farther away from Jourdan. In fact, Moreau did not begin to advance until 14 August and then he headed for the Danube crossings. Meanwhile, Charles retreated rapidly, increasing the distance between his army and Moreau, but also giving himself more room to maneuver. On 18 and 19 August Moreau&#x27;s army finally crossed to the south bank of the Danube. But on the 17th the archduke made a crucial strategic move. Leaving Latour with 30,288 troops plus Condé&#x27;s 5,000-6,000 men, Charles and 28,000 troops recrossed to the north bank, heading for a rendezvous with Wartensleben. Ignoring this move, Moreau moved steadily to the east on the south bank of the Danube. Napoleon later wrote of Moreau, &quot;One would have said that he was ignorant that a French army existed on his left&quot;. The next actions were the Battle of Amberg and the Battle of Friedberg, both on 24 August 1796.

<text>The Battle of Neuwied (18 April 1797) saw Lazare Hoche lead part of the French Army of Sambre-et-Meuse against Franz von Werneck&#x27;s Austrian army. The French attack surprised their enemies and broke through their lines. Aside from 1,000 men killed and wounded, Austrian losses included at least 3,000 prisoners, 24 artillery pieces, 60 vehicles, and five colors. For their part, the French lost 2,000 men killed, wounded, and captured. The losses were in vain because Napoleon Bonaparte signed the Preliminaries of Leoben with Austria the same day. The armistice halted the fighting so that both sides could negotiate a peace. The action occurred during the War of the First Coalition, part of the French Revolutionary Wars.

==The battle==
The battle opened with an Austrian cannonade causing an attack by the French right wing on the Austrian left wing under Pál Kray. After several attacks against the key position on the Austrian right near the village of Bendorff, the French infantry, aided by several squadrons of chasseurs, were able to dislodge the Austrians from this position. A French cavalry charge drove the Austrians out of the village of Sayn. Hoche then launched a column under Antoine Richepanse in the pursuit of the retreating Austrians. Richepanse succeeded in capturing seven cannons, fifty caissons and five Austrian colors. The French infantry, supported by the guns of François Joseph Lefebvre, managed to dislodge the Austrians from the village of Zolenberg, causing the final defeat of the Austrian left wing.

As the French right wing attacked the Austrian left wing, Hoche launched a second assault, this time on the Austrian center. After an artillery barrage, the grenadiers of General Paul Grenier assaulted the redoubts of Hettersdorff and took the village in a bayonet charge, while the hussars of Michel Ney outflanked the Austrian center position from the left. These attacks forced the Austrian center to retreat.

After being dislodged by Richepanse, the Austrian left was rallied by Kray who was able to withstand further French attacks. To counter this, Hoche launched the grenadiers of Grenier and several squadrons of dragoons and Ney&#x27;s hussars against Kray. Ney with some 500 hussars proceeded to Dierdorf where he engaged the Austrian reserve of 6,000 for four hours until the rest of the French army caught up. During a counterattack by Austrian cavalry Ney&#x27;s horse fell and he was captured. Under this attack the Austrian left collapsed and in the pursuit the hussars captured 4,000 men and two colors. On their part of the battlefield the French left wing under Jean Étienne Championnet succeeded in driving the Austrians out of Altenkirchen and Kerathh.

==Result==
The Austrian army lost 3,000 men in the battle and another 7,000 men were captured in the aftermath of the battle. The French captured twenty-seven cannon and seven Austrian colors in this major success. Hoche&#x27;s successful offensive was stopped by news of the Preliminaries of Leoben which led to the Treaty of Campo Formio. The Battle of Neuwied is inscribed on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

<doc id="157706" wikidata="Q1430673" url="?curid=157706" title="Hemiola">
<text>In music, hemiola (also hemiolia) is the ratio 3:2. The equivalent Latin term is [[Superparticular number|sesquialtera]]. In rhythm, &quot;hemiola&quot; refers to three beats of equal value in the time normally occupied by two beats. In pitch, &quot;hemiola&quot; refers to the interval of a perfect fifth.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;hemiola&quot; comes from the Greek adjective ἡμιόλιος, &quot;hemiolios&quot;, meaning &quot;containing one and a half,&quot; &quot;half as much again,&quot; &quot;in the ratio of one and a half to one (3:2), as in musical sounds.&quot; The words &quot;hemiola&quot; and &quot;sesquialtera&quot; both signify the ratio 3:2, and in music were first used to describe relations of pitch. Dividing the string of a monochord in this ratio produces the interval of a perfect fifth. Beginning in the 15th century, both words were also used to describe rhythmic relationships, specifically the substitution (usually through the use of coloration—red notes in place of black ones, or black in place of &quot;white&quot;, hollow noteheads) of three imperfect notes (divided into two parts) for two perfect ones (divided into three parts) in &quot;tempus perfectum&quot; or in &quot;prolatio maior&quot;.

==Rhythm==
In rhythm, &quot;hemiola&quot; refers to three beats of equal value in the time normally occupied by two beats.

===Vertical hemiola: sesquialtera===
&quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Music&quot; illustrates hemiola with a superimposition of three notes in the time of two and vice versa.

One textbook states that, although the word &quot;hemiola&quot; is commonly used for both simultaneous and successive durational values, describing a simultaneous combination of three against two is less accurate than for successive values and the &quot;preferred term for a vertical two against three … is &quot;sesquialtera&quot;.&quot; &quot;The New Harvard Dictionary of Music&quot; states that in some contexts, a sesquialtera is equivalent to a hemiola. &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, on the other hand, has maintained from the first edition of 1880 down to the most recent edition of 2001 that the Greek and Latin terms are equivalent and interchangeable, both in the realms of pitch and rhythm, although David Hiley, E. Thomas Stanford, and Paul R. Laird hold that, though similar in effect, hemiola properly applies to a momentary occurrence of three duple values in place of two triple ones, whereas sesquialtera represents a proportional metric change between successive sections.

====Sub-Saharan African music====
A repeating vertical hemiola is known as polyrhythm, or more specifically, cross-rhythm. The most basic rhythmic cell of sub-Saharan Africa is the 3:2 cross-rhythm. Novotney observes: &quot;The 3:2 relationship (and [its] permutations) is the foundation of most typical polyrhythmic textures found in West African musics.&quot; Agawu states: &quot;[The] resultant [3:2] rhythm holds the key to understanding ... there is no independence here, because 2 and 3 belong to a single Gestalt.&quot;
In the following example, a Ghanaian gyil plays a hemiola as the basis of an ostinato melody. The left hand (lower notes) sounds the two main beats, while the right hand (upper notes) sounds the three cross-beats.

====European music====
In compound time ( or ). Where a regular pattern of two beats to a measure is established at the start of a phrase. This changes to a pattern of three beats at the end of the phrase.
The minuet from J. S. Bach&#x27;s keyboard Partita No. 5 in G major articulates groups of 2 times 3 quavers that are really in time, despite the metre stated in the initial time-signature. The latter time is restored only at the cadences (bars 4 and 11–12):

Later in the same piece, Bach creates a conflict between the two metres ( against ):

Hemiola is found in many Renaissance pieces in triple rhythm. One composer who exploited this characteristic was the 16th-century French composer Claude Le Jeune, a leading exponent of musique mesurée à l&#x27;antique. One of his best-known chansons is &quot;Revoici venir du printemps&quot;, where the alternation of compound-duple and simple-triple metres with a common counting unit for the beat subdivisions can be clearly heard:

The hemiola was commonly used in baroque music, particularly in dances, such as the courante and minuet. Other composers who have used the device extensively include Corelli, Handel, Weber and Beethoven. A spectacular example from Beethoven comes in the scherzo from his String Quartet No. 6. As Philip Radcliffe puts it, &quot;The constant cross-rhythms shifting between and , more common at certain earlier and later periods, were far from usual in 1800, and here they are made to sound especially eccentric owing to frequent sforzandi on the last quaver of the bar... it looks ahead to later works and must have sounded very disconcerting to contemporary audiences.&quot;
Later in the nineteenth century, Tchaikovsky frequently used hemiolas in his waltzes, as did Richard Strauss in the waltzes from &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;, and the third movement of Robert Schumann&#x27;s Piano Concerto is noted for the ambiguity of its rhythm. John Daverio says that the movement&#x27;s &quot;fanciful hemiolas... serve to legitimize the dance-like material as a vehicle for symphonic elaboration.&quot;

Johannes Brahms was particularly famous for exploiting the hemiola&#x27;s potential for large-scale thematic development. Writing about the rhythm and meter of Brahms&#x27;s Symphony No. 3, Frisch says &quot;Perhaps in no other first movement by Brahms does the development of these elements play so critical a role. The first movement of the third is cast in meter that is also open, through internal recasting as (a so-called hemiola). Metrical ambiguity arises in the very first appearance of the motto [opening theme].&quot;

At the beginning of the second movement, , of his String Quartet (1903), Ravel &quot;uses the &quot;pizzicato&quot; as a vehicle for rhythmic interplay between and .&quot;

===Horizontal hemiola===
Peter Manuel, in the context of an analysis of the flamenco soleá song form, refers to the following figure as a &quot;horizontal hemiola&quot; or &quot;sesquialtera&quot; (which mistranslates as: &quot;six that alters&quot;). It is &quot;a cliché of various Spanish and Latin American musics ... well established in Spain since the sixteenth century&quot;, a twelve-beat scheme with internal accents, consisting of a bar followed by one in , for a 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 pattern.

This figure is a common African bell pattern, used by the Hausa people of Nigeria, in Haitian Vodou drumming, Cuban palo, and many other drumming systems. The horizontal hemiola suggests metric modulation ( changing to ). This interpretational switch has been exploited, for example, by Leonard Bernstein, in the song &quot;America&quot; from &quot;West Side Story&quot;, as can be heard in the prominent motif (suggesting a duple beat scheme, followed by a triple beat scheme):
==Pitch==

===The perfect fifth===
&quot;Hemiola&quot; can be used to describe the ratio of the lengths of two strings as three-to-two (3:2), that together sound a perfect fifth. The early Pythagoreans, such as Hippasus and Philolaus, used this term in a music-theoretic context to mean a perfect fifth.
The justly tuned pitch ratio of a perfect fifth means that the upper note makes three vibrations in the same amount of time that the lower note makes two. In the cent system of pitch measurement, the 3:2 ratio corresponds to approximately 702 cents, or 2% of a semitone wider than seven semitones. The just perfect fifth can be heard when a violin is tuned: if adjacent strings are adjusted to the exact ratio of 3:2, the result is a smooth and consonant sound, and the violin sounds in tune. Just perfect fifths are the basis of Pythagorean tuning, and are employed together with other just intervals in just intonation. The 3:2 just perfect fifth arises in the justly tuned C major scale between C and G.

===Other intervals===
Later Greek authors such as Aristoxenus and Ptolemy use the word to describe smaller intervals as well, such as the hemiolic chromatic &quot;pyknon&quot;, which is one-and-a-half times the size of the semitone comprising the enharmonic &quot;pyknon&quot;.

<text>The Battle of Novi took place on 15 August 1799, was a battle between combined army of the Habsburg monarchy and Imperial Russians under Field Marshal Alexander Suvorov and a Republican French army under General Barthélemy Catherine Joubert. As soon as Joubert fell during the battle, Jean Victor Marie Moreau immediately took overall command of the French forces. After a prolonged and bloody struggle, the Austro-Russians broke through the French defenses and drove their enemies into a disorderly retreat, while French division commanders Catherine-Dominique de Pérignon and Emmanuel Grouchy were captured. Novi Ligure is in the province of Piedmont in Northern Italy a distance of north of Genoa. The battle occurred during the War of the Second Coalition which was part of the French Revolutionary Wars.

Novi was a strong defensive position situated on steep heights. An old fortress wall from the 15th century surrounded the city. This medieval wall served as a good defense for the French chasseurs. It was damaged in many places, there were breaks, but the French had barricaded all these breaches.

In 1799, Russian and Austrian forces swept across the Po River valley, recapturing lands taken by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1796. The French troops in Italy were badly defeated at the major battles of Magnano, Cassano and the Trebbia. Subsequently, French and Cisalpine Italian troops retreated into Genoa and the Ligurian Republic. A new French government placed Joubert in command of the reformed &quot;Army of Italy&quot; and ordered him to take the offensive. Accordingly, the French army moved north across the mountain crests and assembled on high ground at Novi Ligure on 14 August. To Joubert&#x27;s dismay, it was clear that large Coalition forces were nearby. The next morning Paul Kray&#x27;s Austrian corps assaulted the French left flank and the battle was on. After a delay, Suvorov committed a Russian corps to attack the center and Michael von Melas&#x27; Austrian corps to attack the French right flank. Kray&#x27;s troops suffered heavy losses but by evening the French army was badly beaten and the French hold on the Italian Riviera was gravely weakened. Cavalry proved ineffective in such terrain and was hardly used by either the Allied or French sides. The Russo-Austrians deployed it en masse only to pursue. However, the Coalition planners proceeded to throw away their advantage by sending Suvorov&#x27;s Russians to Switzerland, a change of strategy that ended badly.

==Background==
The 1799 campaign in Italy began with the Battle of Verona, a series of costly but indecisive clashes around Verona on 26 March. At the Battle of Magnano on 5 April, the Habsburg Austrian army of Paul Kray triumphed over the Republican French army of Barthélemy Louis Joseph Schérer. While suffering losses of 4,000 killed and wounded and 2,000 captured, Kray&#x27;s Austrians inflicted casualties of 3,500 killed and wounded and captured 4,500 men, 18 artillery pieces and seven colors from the French. Two days later, a distraught Schérer begged to be relieved of command, but before that happens, he would be defeated again in the small battle with Alexander Suvorov at Lecco on 26 April. Michael von Melas arrived to take command of the Austrian army from Kray on 9 April. Hearing that 12,000 Austrians were approaching from the Tyrol to the north, Schérer abandoned the line of the Mincio River on 12 April. Leaving 12,000 troops in the fortress of Mantua and 1,600 more in Peschiera del Garda, the demoralized French commander ordered his crippled army to withdraw. As the soldiers fell back, the skies opened up and turned the retreat into a sodden nightmare.

On 15 April 1799, the veteran Russian field marshal Alexander Suvorov formally took command of the combined Austro-Russian army in Italy. On 27 April Suvorov defeated the French, now under Jean Victor Marie Moreau, at the Battle of Cassano, and then in the First Battle of Marengo (Battle of San Giuliano) on 16 May. At Cassano, the Allies suffered 2,000 casualties while the French sustained losses of 2,500 killed and wounded plus 5,000 soldiers, 27 guns and three colors captured; the next day a 3,000-man French division was trapped and surrendered at Verderio Superiore, however, the Russians subsequently lost the Battle of Bassignana on 12 May. After the battle of Cassano, the next major action was the Battle of the Trebbia from 17 to 20 June where Suvorov&#x27;s 37,000-strong Austro-Russian army (only up to 32,656 troops involved) mauled Jacques MacDonald&#x27;s 33,000-man French army, which had earlier broken through Austrian positions in the Battle of Modena on 12 June. The Allies suffered 5,500 casualties at the Trebbia, while inflicting 16,500 on the French including the taking of 7,000 prisoners. On 20 June, just as the battle of the Trebbia ended, the Second Battle of Marengo (Battle of Cascina Grossa) took place, where the Austrians suffered a setback. Nevertheless, Coalition forces successfully besieged a number of key fortresses in the meantime. Peschiera fell on 6 May, Milan was captured on 24 May and Turin fell on 20 June after a nine-day siege. Suvorov and his Austrian allies had evicted the French from almost all of Italy, while Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen beat André Masséna&#x27;s French army at the First Battle of Zurich on 4–6 June.

A day after defeating MacDonald along the Trebbia River, the Allies captured the 17th Light Demi Brigade, 1,099 men, six guns and three colors. On 22 June Suvorov halted pursuit by his army, exhausted by continuous marching and fighting. At first a division was allowed to follow the French, but this was soon reduced to an Austrian advanced guard under Johann von Klenau which went on to clear the Grand Duchy of Tuscany of enemy forces. On 20 June, Moreau and 14,000 French troops left the security of the mountains to defeat Count Heinrich von Bellegarde and 11,000 Austrians in the Second Battle of Marengo. Bellegarde withdrew to the west after suffering 2,260 casualties but Moreau soon scampered back to the safety of the Apennines after hearing news of the Trebbia. French casualties numbered 1,000 killed and wounded in this encounter.

By 27 June, Suvorov moved his main army west to cover the sieges of Alessandria and Tortona while Kray was still reducing Mantua. Suvorov and his Austrian chief of staff Johann Gabriel Chasteler de Courcelles planned to evict the weakened and battered French forces from Genoa and the Italian Riviera. However, instructions soon arrived from Vienna squelching any notion of offensive operations. Emperor Francis and his foreign minister Johann Amadeus Francis de Paula, Baron of Thugut insisted that the Italian fortresses must first be captured. In fact the emperor and Thugut were suspicious of Russian designs on Genoa and Tuscany, areas which they considered to be in Austria&#x27;s sphere of influence. For his part, Suvorov was annoyed with Viennese officials for trying to direct the war from long distance.

Repeated military defeats shook the public&#x27;s faith in the French Directory. The Coup of 30 Prairial VII occurred on 18 June which pushed Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès and Paul Barras into leading roles and elevated Jean Baptiste Bernadotte to the post of Minister of War. There were two major forces in Italy, the 19,000-strong &quot;Army of the Alps&quot; under Jean Étienne Championnet and 40,713 men of the &quot;Army of Italy&quot;. The French government placed its hopes on Barthélemy Catherine Joubert to retrieve the situation as the new commander of the &quot;Army of Italy&quot;. Not only was Joubert a talented general, but he was believed to be lacking political ambitions and thus not a threat to the government. When Joubert arrived in the theater on 4 August, Moreau gracefully stepped aside and offered his assistance.

The Allies successfully wrapped up the siege of Alessandria on 21 July and the Siege of Mantua on 30 July. These important events released 30,000 Coalition troops for field operations. Suvorov placed Konrad Valentin von Kaim with 14,000 Austrians to guard the west of Piedmont and Karl Joseph Hadik von Futak with 11,000 more to observe the alpine passes into Switzerland to the north. Klenau with 5,000 troops at Sarzana was watching the southeast side of Genoa. Kray was ordered to join the main army as quickly as possible. The rest of Suvorov&#x27;s army was deployed in the area of Alessandria and Tortona. In the meantime, Chasteler was seriously wounded by a canister shot on 17 July during the siege of Alessandria and replaced by another Austrian, Anton von Zach. Despite the pain of his injury, Chasteler produced a new plan for ousting the French from the Ligurian mountains. This plan was put on indefinite hold when the news of the impending French offensive became known.

The &quot;Army of Italy&quot; was fortunate in having capable generals. Catherine-Dominique de Pérignon led the left wing while Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr directed the right wing. Both became Marshals of France under Napoleon along with Joubert&#x27;s chief of staff Louis Gabriel Suchet and division commander Emmanuel Grouchy. Joubert&#x27;s generals wished to wait for Championnet&#x27;s army to come up on their left around 20 August before advancing. However, Joubert believed that his orders to attack from the Directory were imperative and refused to delay. Saint-Cyr&#x27;s wing moved north through the Bocchetta Pass and Gavi. At Serravalle Scrivia they besieged a castle held by four companies of Austrians. This position had been captured by Pyotr Bagration&#x27;s 2,100-man Russian advance guard as recently as 9 August. Pérignon&#x27;s wing had farther to march. This French column pushed some of Bellegarde&#x27;s troops out of Terzo then swung east through Acqui Terme, Rivalta Bormida and Capriata d&#x27;Orba. Saint-Cyr arrived alone at Novi Ligure on 13 August, but Suvorov declined to attack, hoping to lure the French into the plains where his superior cavalry and artillery might prove decisive. That same day contact was established with Pérignon&#x27;s approaching troops.

Kray&#x27;s troops reached Alessandria on 12 June and Suvorov planned to launch them into an attack on Pérignon&#x27;s wing early on the 14th. This proved to be impossible, but Kray managed to join Bellegarde&#x27;s force and he promised to attack on 15 August. Meanwhile, the division of François Watrin moved down from the hills in the direction of Tortona, giving every indication that the French offensive was still in full swing. Joubert had hoped that he was facing only 8,000 enemies. But he was stunned to see that he was facing at least 36,000 enemies including Kray&#x27;s corps in the plains below. Both Pérignon and Saint-Cyr counseled retreat, but Joubert put off a final decision until the next day. Meanwhile, Suvorov assumed that the French army would soon descend into the plains. When the French came forward, Kray and 27,000 soldiers would cut into their left flank while Bagration&#x27;s 5,700-man Russian advance guard would turn their right flank. With luck the two forces would link hands behind the French. Once the turning movements were well developed, Wilhelm Derfelden&#x27;s 9,850 Russians and Melas&#x27; 8,800 Austrians would join the battle. Farther north, Johann Baptist Alcaini&#x27;s 5,260-strong force besieged Tortona, covered by Andrei Grigorevich Rosenberg&#x27;s 8,270 Russians.

==Forces==
===Allied Army===

Kray&#x27;s corps was divided into two Austrian divisions under Bellegarde and Peter Karl Ott von Bátorkéz. The brigade commanders were Friedrich Joseph Anton von Bellegarde, Friedrich Heinrich von Gottesheim, Ferdinand Minckwitz and Alexander Friedrich von Seckendorff. Except for the last-named, it is not clear in which division the brigadiers served. Ott&#x27;s left division included three battalions each of the &quot;Deutschmeister&quot; Nr. 4, &quot;Terzy&quot; Nr. 16 and &quot;Mittrowsky&quot; Nr. 40 Infantry Regiments, two battalions of the &quot;Vukassovich&quot; Nr. 48 Infantry Regiment, one battalion of the &quot;Szluiner&quot; Grenz Infantry Regiment Nr. 4, and six squadrons of the &quot;Archduke John&quot; Dragoon Regiment Nr. 3. Ott commanded 9,979 infantry and 906 cavalry for a total of 10,885.

Bellegarde&#x27;s division consisted of three battalions each of the &quot;Sztáray&quot; Nr. 33 and &quot;Nádasdy&quot; Nr. 39 Infantry Regiments, two battalions each of the &quot;Huff&quot; Nr. 8, &quot;Kheul&quot; Nr. 10, &quot;Gyulai&quot; Nr. 32 and &quot;Lattermann&quot; Nr. 45 Infantry Regiments, six squadrons of the &quot;Kaiser&quot; Dragoon Regiment Nr. 1 and eight squadrons of the &quot;Archduke Joseph&quot; Hussar Regiment Nr. 2. This force numbered 11,796 foot and 1,724 horse or a strength of 13,520 troops. To Bellegarde&#x27;s right was a screening force under Seckendorff which was made up of two battalions of the &quot;Oranien&quot; Nr. 15 Infantry Regiment, one battalion of the &quot;Szluiner&quot; Grenz and three squadrons of the Hussar Regiment Nr. 5. The screening force counted 2,491 infantry and 524 cavalry or a total of 3,015 soldiers. Kray wielded a total of 27,420 troops in his large corps.

On the Allied left, Melas commanded Michael von Fröhlich&#x27;s 8,575-strong Austrian division. The division consisted of more than 3,660 grenadiers in nine battalions, six squadrons each of the &quot;Lobkowitz&quot; Nr. 10 and &quot;Levenehr&quot; Nr. 14 Dragoon Regiments, 1,258 sabers, three battalions of the &quot;Fürstenberg&quot; Infantry Regiment Nr. 36, 2,081 men, and two battalions of the &quot;Stuart&quot; Infantry Regiment Nr. 18, 1,576 troops. One brigadier was Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein, though the troops under his command are not given. Franz Joseph, Marquis de Lusignan led the &quot;Fürstenberg&quot;, &quot;Morzin&quot;, &quot;Paar&quot;, &quot;Pertusi&quot; and &quot;Weber&quot; Grenadier Battalions and Johann Ludwig Alexius von Loudon commanded the &quot;Hohenfeld&quot;, &quot;Goeschen&quot;, &quot;Schiaffinatti&quot; and &quot;Weissenwolff&quot; Grenadier Battalions. Anton Ferdinand Mittrowsky directed two of the &quot;Fürstenberg&quot; infantry battalions and two squadrons of the &quot;Lobkowitz&quot; Dragoons while Johann Benedikt Nobili led the two &quot;Stuart&quot; infantry battalions and two more squadrons of the &quot;Lobkowitz&quot; Regiment.

Derfelden&#x27;s 15,552-man Russian corps was divided into a division under Derfelden himself, a second division led by Mikhail Miloradovich and an Advance Guard led by Bagration. The Advance Guard consisted of two battalions each of the &quot;Bagration&quot; and &quot;Miller&quot; Jäger Regiments, 1,189 foot, the &quot;Dendrygin&quot;, &quot;Lomonosov&quot;, &quot;Sanaev&quot; and &quot;Kalemin&quot; Combined Grenadier Battalions, 1,728 foot, the &quot;Denisov&quot;, &quot;Sychov&quot;, &quot;Grekov&quot; and &quot;Semernikov&quot; Cossack Regiments, 1,948 horse, and six squadrons of the Austrian &quot;Karaczay&quot; Dragoon Regiment Nr. 4, 840 horse. Altogether, the 5,705-man Advance Guard counted 2,917 infantry and 2,788 cavalry. Derfelden&#x27;s 6,127-strong infantry division included two battalions each of the &quot;Schveikovsky&quot;, &quot;Förster&quot;, &quot;Tyrtov&quot; and &quot;Baranovsky&quot; Musketeer Regiments and two battalions of the &quot;Rosenberg&quot; Grenadier Regiment. Miloradovich&#x27;s 3,720-man infantry division had two battalions each of the &quot;Jung-Baden&quot;, &quot;Dalheim&quot; and &quot;Miloradovich&quot; Musketeer Regiments. The strength of Suvorov&#x27;s Austro-Russian army was 44,347 foot and 7,200 horse, a total of 51,547 soldiers, not counting gunners and sappers.

===French Army===
According to one authority Joubert&#x27;s army numbered 32,843 infantry and 2,087 cavalry for a total of 34,930 men. Saint-Cyr stated the army was 34,000-strong but in another place gave a strength of 35,487 foot and 1,765 horse, or a total of 37,252 men not counting artillery. According to Spencer C. Tucker, the total French force amounted 35,000. The French supply arrangements had collapsed and the troops were tired, thirsty and starving. Some soldiers were reduced to eating grass and leaves. Pérignon&#x27;s wing consisted of the infantry divisions of Grouchy and Louis Lemoine plus a two-brigade infantry reserve and Antoine Richepanse&#x27;s cavalry reserve. All demi brigades had two battalions each except where otherwise noted. Grouchy&#x27;s 5,620-man division had a first brigade under Charles Louis Dieudonné Grandjean made up of the 39th and 92nd Line Infantry Demi Brigades and one battalion of the 26th Light Infantry Demi Brigade. The second brigade of Henri François Marie Charpentier consisted of the 93rd and 99th Line Demi Brigades. Lemoine&#x27;s 6,410-strong division included a first brigade under Louis Garreau with the 26th Line and 80th Line and one battalion of the 5th Light and a second brigade under Jean Mathieu Seras counting the 20th Light and 34th Line. The three squadron strong 1st Hussar Regiment was attached to Lemoine. The 4,875-man reserve included Bertrand Clausel&#x27;s brigade with the 29th Light and 74th Line and Louis Partouneaux&#x27;s brigade with the 105th Line and one battalion of the 26th Light. Richepanse commanded 1,002 sabers in the 2nd Chasseurs à Cheval, 12th Dragoon, and the 1st, 3rd and 18th Cavalry Regiments. Each regiment counted two squadrons.

Saint-Cyr&#x27;s wing comprised the infantry divisions of Pierre Garnier de Laboissière, François Watrin and Jean Henri Dombrowski, a strong independent brigade under Louis Léonard Colli-Ricci, plus infantry and cavalry reserves. Laboissière&#x27;s division numbered between 3,645 and 3,976 men in six battalions and had the three squadron strong 6th Hussar Regiment attached. François Jean Baptiste Quesnel&#x27;s brigade included the 17th Light and 63rd Line Demi Brigades while Gaspard Amédée Gardanne&#x27;s brigade counted the 18th Light and 21st Line Demi Brigades. Watrin&#x27;s division had between 4,535 and 6,040 soldiers in 10 battalions including the attached 25th Chasseurs à Cheval of two squadron strength. André Calvin&#x27;s advanced guard counted the 8th, 15th and 27th Light and 2nd Line, Antoine Arnaud&#x27;s brigade consisted of the 12th and 30th Light and brigade had the 62nd and 78th Line. Dombrowski&#x27;s division counted between 2,130 and 2,340 troops in seven battalions. Dombrowski&#x27;s units were the 17th and 55th Line, the Polish Legion including a cavalry squadron and two battalions of the 1st (Italian) Cisalpine. Colli commanded from 3,878 to 4,260 men consisting of two battalions each of the 14th, 24th and 68th Line plus a battalion of Poles. The infantry reserve had 2,420 soldiers in four battalions of the 3rd and 106th Line. cavalry reserve numbered 425 sabers in five squadrons of the 16th and 19th Dragoons and 19th Chasseurs à Cheval.

==Battle==
===Kray attacks===
Joubert did not plan on fighting at Novi Ligure, but the position that his troops held was well-suited for a defensive battle. Facing north, the French held an arc of high ground from Serravalle on the right to Pasturana on the left. In the center, Novi was surrounded by a wall and ditch dating to the Middle Ages. One weakness of the position was that the deep ravines of the Riasco and Braghena streams cut across the rear, obstructing any retreat. Kray had the Allied right wing in movement before dawn with Bellegarde on the right and Ott on the left. Seckendorf on the far right aimed for the place where the Riasco stream emerged from its ravine. The crackle of muskets began at 3:20 am as the Austrian columns bumped into French picket lines. This provoked a great racket in the French camps as their surprised troops rushed into formation. At first light, the Allies saw that the heights were crowned by the blue lines of French infantry. Instead of striking the flank of an enemy army on the move, the Austrians of the right wing were making a frontal attack on a strong position.

On the extreme French right, Dombrowski&#x27;s division blockaded the Austrians in Serravalle Castle. Next in line was Watrin&#x27;s division which was still deployed in the low ground to the east of Novi. Gardanne&#x27;s brigade held Novi while the rest of Laboissière&#x27;s division lined the heights behind the town. Farther to the left was Lemoine&#x27;s division and then Grouchy&#x27;s division on the far left. The left was braced by the reserves of Clausel, Partouneaux and Richepanse.

At the foot of the plateau, Ott and Bellegarde deployed from marching columns into lines. At first their assault enjoyed some success against their sleep-groggy opponents. However, the slopes were steep and obstructed by vineyards, forcing the Austrians to redeploy into column. Pérignon brought Clausel and Partouneaux to the assistance of Grouchy, while Saint-Cyr sent Colli&#x27;s brigade from the right wing to help Lemoine. Moreau took charge of the French center in the contest against Ott. In this phase of the battle Joubert was fatally hit while leading a counterattack by the 26th Light Demi Brigade. Despite mounting losses, the Austrian infantry bravely and repeatedly struggled forward in columns. As they reached the top of the slope and tried to redeploy into line, they were struck by French counterattacks and forced back. At last, Ott&#x27;s columns were overthrown by the 26th Light and 105th Line and Kray&#x27;s entire wing fell back to the bottom of the heights to reform.

By 9:00 am Kray and his officers managed to reorganize their troops when an order arrived from Suvorov to renew the attack. Once more the Austrians attacked the heights and once more they were defeated with loss. While Clausel and Richepanse helped repulse Bellegarde&#x27;s division, Partouneaux counterattacked Ott. Encouraged by his success, Partouneaux unwisely charged down into the plain where his troops were scattered by four squadrons of the &quot;Archduke Joseph&quot; Hussars and &quot;Kaiser&quot; Dragoons. Partouneaux was among those captured. After the repulse of his second attack, Kray massed a 40-gun battery with which he bombarded any French troops who dared to line the crest. But the Austrian general refused to launch more attacks until the rest of the army joined the fight. Suvorov had planned to encircle a French army in motion. The unexpected circumstances threw the Allied plan out of gear.

===Bagration and Miloradovich in battle===
Suvorov realized that every man must be thrown into the battle. Bagration&#x27;s command belatedly attacked Novi at 10:00 am. As the Russians moved forward they were subjected to an intense artillery barrage. Bagration&#x27;s troops were able to press back the French skirmish lines through the outlying ditches, gardens and suburbs of Novi, but were foiled when they encountered Novi&#x27;s city wall. Moving to their right, they were easy marks for the tirailleurs who were concealed in the vineyards and farm buildings. The Russians ran into Quesnel&#x27;s brigade of Laboissière&#x27;s division defending the heights; it held back the Russians. As the Russians pushed forward, they were attacked in flank by Gardanne&#x27;s men from Novi and even by Watrin&#x27;s division from the French right flank, which was eager to gain its revenge for the defeat on the Trebbia. Most of Miloradovich&#x27;s division was sent into the fray to assist Bagration ( was appointed commander of Miloradovich&#x27;s dispatched force): the &quot;Miller&quot; Jaeger and the &quot;Lomonosov&quot; and &quot;Sanaev&quot; grenadiers succeeded in containing Gardanne&#x27;s thrusts from Novi, but every Russian assault on the French center came to grief. Bagration&#x27;s Cossacks found employment by luring French skirmishers into the plain and then killing or capturing them.

===Melas&#x27; movement===
In due course, Derfelden&#x27;s division arrived at the front and was hurled into a new attack near Novi. Kray&#x27;s wing attacked once more and his attack stalled. Around 11:30 am Suvorov directed the Allied left wing under Melas to advance. However, Melas, shortly after Derfelden left, declined to attack Novi as ordered by Suvorov&#x27;s sent adjutant Colonel Lavrov. Instead of a full-fledged frontal attack on the right of the Novi position, he carefully reconnoitered the ground and also decided to head out east of this strong position—on the distant right flank. The Austrian sent Nobili&#x27;s two battalions and two squadrons south along the east bank of the Scrivia River toward the Serravalle Castle to prevent any French threat from that direction. Nobili was aided by Lieutenant Colonel Dworschak and the garrison of Serravalle Castle, which made a sortie into the town. The remainder of the left wing, the main force, moved down the west bank of the river with Mittrowsky&#x27;s brigade on the left and the grenadier battalions on the right, to help the Russians against Watrin as directed; Melas would instruct Lusignan&#x27;s brigade to attack to the east of Novi in conjunction with Derfelden, while Loudon&#x27;s brigade made a wider sweep eastwards toward the heights with Mittrowsky. Loudon and Mittrowsky headed that way due to pressure from the Austro-Russian commander in chief, who directed them to be moved from the east bank, thus only Nobili&#x27;s brigade remained there, going to Serravalle. At the same time Melas himself with Lusignan&#x27;s brigade and Liechtenstein&#x27;s cavalry joined the Russian left flank.

Around 3:00 pm the most recent Austro-Russian attack was repulsed from the line of heights. According to Gryazev&#x27;s chronicles, &quot;Rosenberg&quot; Grenadiers advanced half way up the slopes, but recoiled in the face of a fire at point blank range. They were saved from destruction by Suvorov, who ordered them to veer to the right, and then fall back downhill. By this time Watrin had positioned his division on the heights to the east of Novi. Lusignan&#x27;s grenadiers made three frontal attacks on Watrin without breaking through. Meanwhile, Loudon&#x27;s grenadiers approached Watrin&#x27;s right flank and Mittrowsky&#x27;s command threatened an even deeper envelopment. In the face of the new attacks, Watrin&#x27;s division crumbled. Saint-Cyr threw the 106th Line Demi Brigade into a counterattack which stopped the Austrians and captured Lusignan, who was wounded. By 5:00 pm, Watrin and the 106th were finally beaten by superior numbers and retreated. On the opposite flank Kray attacked again between 3:00 and 4:00 pm.

===Coalition breakthrough===

Around 5:30 pm the entire French position started to disintegrate. The &quot;Paar&quot; Grenadier Battalion drove Colli&#x27;s 68th Line from the crest near Novi. The troops of Derfelden and Melas broke into Novi at about the same time, driving out most of Gardanne&#x27;s men. Laboissière&#x27;s division managed to follow Watrin&#x27;s men in their escape. But at about this time the French army split into two halves which were not reunited until three days later. As the French left started to pull back, the Allies closed in for the kill, unleashing their cavalry. Earlier, Bellegarde had posted a battalion and four squadrons near Pasturana on the far right. Now, as the French retreated they had to negotiate the streets of Pasturana, the Braghena Gorge immediately to the south and Bellegarde&#x27;s small force.

The entire French left wing had to squeeze through the blockage. The Russians took no prisoners, killing every Frenchman that they caught. If a French soldier survived as a prisoner, it was because he was taken by Kray&#x27;s Austrians. In the melee Grouchy tried to rally his men but was cut down and captured. Pérignon was also taken prisoner after suffering three wounds including a deep saber cut above his left eye. Colli and at least 2,000 other French soldiers and 21 artillery pieces were captured, mostly in the bottleneck at Pasturana. As night fell, the French army streamed away and the exhausted Allies stopped. Near midnight, some of Gardanne&#x27;s men were discovered hiding out in Novi and the Russians went through the town again. Having accomplished their purpose, they began looting and Suvorov ordered his drummers to beat assembly to stop the pillage.

==Results==
Years later when Moreau was asked about Suvorov, he replied: &quot;What can you say of a general so resolute to a superhuman degree, and who would perish himself and let his army perish to the last man rather than retreat a single pace.&quot;

Historian Digby Smith called Novi, &quot;one of the bloodiest battles of the era&quot; and the casualties bear this out. Smith claimed that the Allies sustained about 900 killed, 4,200 wounded and 1,400 captured or missing (6,500 totally), plus three guns. Russian generals Aleksey Gorchakov, Tyrtov and Chubarov were wounded. The French lost 1,500 killed, 5,500 wounded and 4,500 prisoners — 11,500 totally. The Allies also captured 37 guns, 40 munition wagons and eight colors. Christopher Duffy stated that one Austrian account admitted a sum of 799 killed, 3,670 wounded and 1,259 missing, though this adds up to less than the 5,754 reported total. Kray&#x27;s wing alone had 710 killed, 3,260 wounded and 1,175 missing. The Russians suffered 2,496 casualties. The two sets of figures add up to a total Allied loss of 8,250. Duffy gave French losses as 6,500 to 6,643; evidently this is only the killed and wounded. Statistician Gaston Bodart noticed 11,000 Frenchmen out of 35,000 and 9,000 allies out of 50,000. Gunther E. Rothenberg asserted that both sides lost 7,000 killed and wounded, while the Allies had 2,000 missing or prisoners and the French had 4,000 prisoners or missing plus 37 guns. David G. Chandler rounded the casualties to 8,000 Allied and 11,000 French. According to Spencer C. Tucker, 11,000 were killed on the French side, and 9,000 on the Allied side. Micheal Clodfelter estimated Allied losses at 8,750, of which 6,050 Austrians were lost including captured, and the Russians lost 2,700 men. The French losses Clodfelter assessed at 9,663, of which 6,663 men were KIA and WIA, and about 3,000 were taken captive. 37 guns were lost. According to David Eggenberger, the Coalition lost 8,000 men in the attack, while the French lost 11,000. According to , Coalition losses amounted to 8,000 men, and French casualties, including those soldiers who fled after the battle, totaled 16,000 and all the wagons. According to another version, — Orlov&#x27;s, — together with the dispersed, the losses amounted to only 15,100, but it is based on the assumptions of some, as stated by the author; by the same estimate 6,500 were killed or wounded and 4,600 captured (11,100 totally). According to , general irretrievable and sanitary losses of the French reached 20,000 soldiers and officers (also including the retreat that followed; i.e. those who deserted, stragglers, died under various circumstances, taken prisoner, battle-wounded and sick who were hospitalized, etc.). Bagration was awarded the Order of Alexander Nevsky while Derfelden earned the Order of St. Andrew.

Once the soldiers of the French left wing got clear of the Braghena Gorge, they quickly left the battlefield far behind. The right wing, however, was in a difficult spot because it was unable to withdraw through Gavi and Nobili&#x27;s command blocked its escape route via Arquata Scrivia. Saint-Cyr was unable to dislodge the Austrians with Dombrowski&#x27;s men and finally shoved Nobili out of the way by using Watrin&#x27;s division. Suvorov brought up Rosenberg&#x27;s corps to the battlefield but did not launch a pursuit. The Russian commander in chief still planned to evict the French from Genoa and the Italian Riviera, but orders soon arrived sending troops elsewhere. Klenau&#x27;s command to the southeast of Genoa was diverted to secure Austrian control of Tuscany. A French offensive seized Valais in southwest Switzerland, routing some of Hadik&#x27;s troops. Suvorov detached Kray to the north with 10,000 Austrians to help.

On 25 August, Suvorov&#x27;s hopes to conquer Liguria were dashed forever when fresh instructions from Emperor Francis reached him. A new strategy put forward by the British and approved by Czar Paul and the Austrians directed Suvorov to take command of a new Russian army assembling in Switzerland. This army would be formed by joining the Russian troops in Italy to another Russian army in Germany under Alexander Korsakov. The army was to invade France through the Jura Mountains. When Korsakov arrived in Switzerland, Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen immediately moved north into Germany with the main Austrian army. The strategy&#x27;s timing failed. Charles left Switzerland too early and Suvorov reached Switzerland too late. André Masséna wrecked the Allied plan when he defeated Korsakov at the Second Battle of Zurich on 26 September 1799.

<doc id="157712" wikidata="Q601872" url="?curid=157712" title="Battle of Ocaña">
<text>The Battle of Ocaña was fought on 19 November 1809 between French forces under Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult against the Spanish army under General Juan Carlos de Aréizaga, which suffered its greatest single defeat in the Peninsular War. 

General Aréizaga&#x27;s Spanish army of 51,000 troops lost nearly 19,000 men killed, wounded, prisoners and deserters, mostly due to the French use of their cavalry. Tactically, the battle was a Cannae-like encirclement of the Spanish army, and the worst defeat ever suffered by a Spanish army on home soil. The strategic consequences were also devastating, as it destroyed the only force capable of defending southern Spain.

==Background==
The Spanish campaign in late 1809 started with the Battle of Talavera.

===Maneuvers===
The Spanish campaign in the autumn of 1809 called for their armies to lunge at Madrid from both north and south. They called for assistance from Arthur Wellesley, Viscount Wellington, but after experiencing a lack of cooperation from the Spanish during the Talavera campaign the British general refused. The French were nearly surprised by the southern thrust. By 9 November, the southern army was within 35 miles of Madrid with only 7,000 French troops blocking them. Then Aréizaga lost his nerve and halted for three days. He then pressed on toward Madrid but ran into two French divisions and pulled back. Several days of fruitless countermarching found the thoroughly alerted French concentrated and moving to intercept the Spanish army.

===Spanish Army===
Aréizaga commanded 51,000-52,000 men in eight infantry and four cavalry divisions, with 60 cannon manned by 1,500 artillerists. Other authorities give the Spanish 60,000 or 56,500 men

==Battle==

===Cavalry action===
On 18 November, one of the largest cavalry actions of the Peninsular War took place. Three of Freire&#x27;s divisions, 4,000 horsemen, attempted to clear a route of retreat for the Spanish army. The French deployed with Paris&#x27;s light cavalry in the front line and Milhaud&#x27;s dragoons in the second line. Paris charged, broke the Spanish first line, and was checked when Freire brought up his reserves. At this juncture, Milhaud&#x27;s dragoons attacked and drove the Spanish cavalry from the field. The French lost less than 100 men, while Spanish losses were in the hundreds, with 80 captured.

William Napier writes of the cavalry action before the battle: &quot;The Spaniards came on at a trot, and Sebastiani directed Paris, with a regiment of light cavalry and the Polish lancers, to turn and fall upon the right flank of the approaching squadrons, which being executed with great vigor, especially by the Poles, caused considerable confusion, which the Spanish general endeavored to remedy by closing to the assailed flank.&quot;

===Positions===
West of Ocaña town, Aréizaga placed Zayas y Chacón&#x27;s Vanguard and Rivas&#x27;s cavalry. From Ocaña to the east, the Spanish commander aligned his center and right. The right flank, which hung in air, was held by Freire&#x27;s remaining three cavalry divisions. From there to Ocaña, Lacy, Castejon, Girón and Vigodet held the front line. Their battalions were arranged in a double line. In reserve behind Castejon stood Jacome&#x27;s men, Zerain supported Giron and Copons backed up Vigodet.

The Royal Guard and one brigade of Dessolles stood north of Ocaña, facing across a deep ravine. The next unit to the east was Louis Rey&#x27;s brigade of Dessolles. Gazan and Girard of the V Corps, Leval and Werlé of IV Corps, and the cavalry completed the line to the east. Soult massed 30 cannons near Dessolles and the V Corps&#x27; positions.

===Battle===
On 19 November, the massed battery pounded the Spanish center as Leval attacked Castejon and Werlé went in against Lacy&#x27;s division. At first the Spanish swung their line back. Then, as the IV Corps halted to wait for artillery to be brought up, the two Spanish divisions surged forward into musket range and opened fire. The Dutch, Germans and Poles began to edge rearward. Soult ordered up Girard&#x27;s division to support the wavering IV Corps battalions.

While this was going on, Milhaud&#x27;s dragoons, supported by Woirgard and Paris, moved rapidly toward the vulnerable Spanish right flank. Screened by olive groves, they suddenly appeared in front of Freire&#x27;s command. The French charged and soon routed the Spanish horsemen. Milhaud, Paris and Woirgard neatly wheeled their squadrons and tore into the unprotected flank of Lacy&#x27;s infantry. Soult sent the French line forward. The massed battery savaged the Spanish line with renewed fury.

Faced by the threat of infantry pressing their front while cavalry slashed into their flank, the Spanish divisions collapsed one after another and bolted for the rear. At this crisis, Dessolles and the Royal Guard dashed across the ravine and burst into Ocaña, severing the Spanish left from their disintegrating center and right. As the Spanish army streamed away to the south, only Zayas&#x27;s division remained intact to cover the retreat. Soult&#x27;s cavalry pressed the pursuit and broke Zayas later in the day.

===Results===
The French captured 14,000 Spaniards, 50 cannon, 30 flags and the entire baggage train. Another 4,000 were killed and wounded. French losses were 2,000 killed and wounded. Paris was killed and Girard wounded. This catastrophe temporarily laid Spain open to French domination. The northern Spanish army was beaten a week later at the Battle of Alba de Tormes. The way was open for the French conquest of Andalusia.

==Aftermath==
The Spanish campaign in late 1809 proceeded with the second Madrid offensive in the Battle of Carpio.

<text>Stokesay Castle is one of the finest surviving fortified manor houses in England, and situated at Stokesay in Shropshire. It was largely built in its present form in the late 13th century by Laurence of Ludlow, on the earlier castle (some of which still survives) founded by its original owners the de Lacy family, from whom it passed to their de Verdun heirs, who retained feudal overlordship of Stokesay until at least 1317. Laurence &#x27;of&#x27; Ludlow was one of the leading wool merchants in England, who intended it to form a secure private house and generate income as a commercial estate. Laurence&#x27;s descendants continued to own the castle until the 16th century, when it passed through various private owners. By the time of the outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642, Stokesay was owned by William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven (1608–1697), a supporter of King Charles I. After the Royalist war effort collapsed in 1645, Parliamentary forces besieged the castle in June and quickly forced its garrison to surrender. Parliament ordered the property to be slighted, but only minor damage was done to the walls, allowing Stokesay to continue to be used as a house by the Baldwyn family until the end of the 17th century.

In the 18th century the Baldwyns rented the castle out for a range of agricultural and manufacturing purposes. It fell into disrepair, and the antiquarian John Britton noted during his visit in 1813 that it had been &quot;abandoned to neglect, and rapidly advancing to ruin&quot;. Restoration work was carried out in the 1830s and 1850s by William Craven, the second Earl of Craven. In 1869 the Craven estate, then heavily in debt, was sold to the wealthy industrialist John Derby Allcroft who paid for another round of extensive restoration during the 1870s. Both of these owners attempted to limit any alterations to the existing buildings during their conservation work, which was unusual for this period. The castle became a popular location for tourists and artists, and was formally opened to paying visitors in 1908.

Allcroft&#x27;s descendants fell into financial difficulties during the early 20th century, however, and it became increasingly difficult for them to cover the costs of maintaining Stokesay. In 1986 Jewell Magnus-Allcroft finally agreed to place Stokesay Castle into the guardianship of English Heritage, and the castle was left to the organisation on her death in 1992. English Heritage carried out extensive restoration of the castle in the late 1980s. In the 21st century, Stokesay Castle continues to be operated as a tourist attraction, receiving 39,218 visitors in 2010.

Architecturally, Stokesay Castle is &quot;one of the best-preserved medieval fortified manor houses in England&quot;, according to historian Henry Summerson. The castle comprises a walled, moated enclosure, with an entrance way through a 17th-century timber and plaster gatehouse. Inside, the courtyard faces a stone hall and solar block, protected by two stone towers. The hall features a 13th-century wooden-beamed ceiling, and 17th-century carved figures ornament the gatehouse and the solar. The castle was never intended to be a serious military fortification, but its style was intended to echo the much larger castles being built by Edward I in North Wales. Originally designed as a prestigious, secure, comfortable home, the castle has changed very little since the 13th century, and is a rare, surviving example of a near complete set of medieval buildings. English Heritage has minimised the amount of interpretative material displayed at the property and kept the castle largely unfurnished.

==History==

===13th–15th centuries===

Stokesay took its name from the Anglo-Saxon word &quot;stoches&quot;, meaning cattle farm, and the surname of the de Says family, who had held the land from the beginning of the 12th century onwards. Stokesay was originally owned by the de Lacy family, who had built the first Ludlow Castle within their manor of Stanton Lacy. In Domesday Book, &quot;Roger de Laci&quot; is recorded as holding &quot;Stoches&quot; of the King in capite. The manor was later held under the de Lacys by members of the de Say family, whose name attached to &#x27;Stoke&#x27; created the name - Stokesay - by which it is still known today. In 1241, the then lord of Stokesay, Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath, died. His son Gilbert had predeceased him, so his extensive estates were divided among Walter&#x27;s granddaughters. One of these, Margery, had married Sir John de Verdun of Alton Castle in Staffordshire, son of the heiress Roesia de Verdun and Theobald le Botiller. Margery&#x27;s share of her grandfather&#x27;s estates included Stokesay and a moiety of nearby Ludlow, which thereafter were held by the de Verduns. On 1 September 1270, to raise money to pay for going on the Eighth Crusade with Prince Edward, John de Verdun conveyed a tenancy of his manor of Stokesay to Philip de Whichecote for a term of 3 years, which was later extended for the term of Philip&#x27;s life, when it would revert to John de Verdun. However, John died in 1274 and Stokesay was inherited by his son Theobald I de Verdun. The Inquisition Post Mortem following John&#x27;s death revealed that the de Verduns&#x27; feoffee at Stokesay at the time was Reginald de Grey. In the feodaries of 1284, Laurence de Ludlow is said to &quot;hold the Vill of Stokesay for one knight&#x27;s-fee under John de Grey, which John held it under Theobald de Verdun, who held of the King&quot;. Stokesay Castle was largely built in its present form during the 1280s and 1290s in the village of Stokesay by Laurence de Ludlow, who was a very wealthy wool merchant.

By chance there may have been earlier connections between Laurence de Ludlow and the de Verduns, which may add to the context within which he became their tenant. Laurence de Ludlow&#x27;s wife was Agnes de Audley, daughter of James de Audley, Justiciar of Ireland and Sheriff of Staffordshire and Shropshire. James de Audley&#x27;s family had been tenants and close associates of the de Verdons of Alton. James&#x27;s father, Henry de Audley was the son of Adam de Audley and Emma, daughter of Ralph/Radulphus fitzOrm whose niece Alina, daughter of Robert fitzOrm, had married Engenulph de Gresley, one of the de Stafford family whose great-grandfather was Robert de Stafford. Engenulph and Alina&#x27;s daughter Hawise de Gresley was Henry de Audley&#x27;s 2nd cousin; she had married Henry de Verdun, son of Bertram III de Verdun. This means that Laurence de Ludlow was related by marriage to cousins of his feudal lord Theobald de Verdun. Laurence&#x27;s mother-in-law Ela de Audley was the daughter of William II Longespée, whose father William I Longespée, Earl of Salisbury was the illegitimate son of Henry II by Ida de Tosny, who became the wife of Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk. John de Verdun&#x27;s grandfather, Nicholas de Verdun had been brought up at the court of Ida and Roger Bigod.

Laurence bought the tenancy of Stokesay from Philip de Whichecote in 1281, possibly for around £266, which he could easily have afforded, as he had made a fortune from the wool trade. Laurence exported wool from the Welsh Marches, travelling across Europe to negotiate sales, and maintaining offices in Shrewsbury and London. He had become the most important wool merchant in England, helping to set government trade policies and lending money to the major nobility. Stokesay Castle would form a secure personal home for Laurence, well-positioned close to his other business operations in the region. It was also intended to be used as a commercial estate, as it was worth around £26 a year, with of agricultural land, of meadows, an expanse of woodland, along with watermills and a dovecot.

Work began on the castle at some point after 1285, and Laurence moved into his new property in the early 1290s. The castle was, as Nigel Pounds describes it, &quot;both pretentious and comfortable&quot;, initially comprising living accommodation and a tower to the north. In 1291 Laurence received permission from the King to fortify his castle - a document called a licence to crenellate - and he may have used this authority to construct the southern tower, which had a particularly martial appearance and was added onto the castle shortly afterwards.

In November 1294 Laurence was drowned at sea off the south of England, and his son, William, may have finished some of the final work on Stokesay. His descendants, who took the Ludlow surname, continued to control Stokesay Castle until the end of the 15th century, when it passed into the Vernon family by marriage.

It appears that in 1317, Stokesay was still being held by the Ludlows under the de Verduns. This is shown by the Inquest Post Mortem of Theobald II de Verdun (son of Theobald I de Verdun), taken in March of that year, which &quot;gives the Heirs of Sir William de Lodlowe as holding of the deceased a knight&#x27;s-fee in Southstoke&quot; (&#x27;north Stoke&#x27; was one of the de Verdun&#x27;s other manors in Shropshire, Stoke-on-Tern). It was only sometime after this date that Stokesay finally passed entirely into the possession of the Ludlow family.

===16th–17th centuries===
Stokesay Castle was passed by Thomas Vernon to his grandson Henry Vernon in 1563. The family had hopes of becoming members of the peerage and, possibly as a consequence, the property began to be regularly called a &quot;castle&quot; for the first time during this period. Henry divided his time between London and Stokesay, probably staying in the north tower. Henry stood surety for an associate&#x27;s debts and when they defaulted, he was pursued for this money, resulting in a period of imprisonment in Fleet Prison; by 1598 he sold the castle for £6,000 to pay off his own substantial debts. The new owner, Sir George Mainwaring, sold the property on again in 1620, via a consortium of investors, to the wealthy widow and former Mayoress of London, Dame Elizabeth Craven for £13,500. The estates around Stokesay were now valuable, bringing in over £300 a year in income.

Elizabeth&#x27;s son, William, spent little time at Stokesay and by the 1640s had leased it out to Charles Baldwyn, and his son Samuel. He rebuilt the gatehouse during 1640 and 1641, however, at a cost of around £533. In 1642 the English Civil War broke out between the supporters of King Charles I and Parliament. A Royalist supporter, William spent the war years at Elizabeth Stuart&#x27;s court at the Hague, and gave large sums of money to the King&#x27;s war effort. William installed a garrison in the castle, where the Baldwins were also strong Royalists, and, as the conflict progressed, the county of Shropshire became increasingly Royalist in sympathies. Despite this, by late 1644 bands of vigilante clubmen had risen up in Shropshire, complaining about the activities of Royalist forces in the region, and demanding, among other things, the removal of the garrison from Stokesay Castle.

By early 1645 the war had turned decisively against the King, and in February, Parliamentary forces seized the county town of Shrewsbury. This exposed the rest of the region to attack, and in June a force of 800 Parliamentary soldiers pushed south towards Ludlow, attacking Stokesay en route. The Royalist garrison, led by Captain Daurett, was heavily outnumbered and it would have been impossible for them to effectively defend the new gatehouse, which was essentially ornamental. Nonetheless, both sides complied with the protocols of warfare at the time, resulting in a bloodless victory for the Parliamentary force: the besiegers demanded that the garrison surrender, the garrison refused, the attackers demanded a surrender for a second time, and this time the garrison were able to give up the castle with dignity.

Shortly afterwards on 9 June, a Royalist force led by Sir Michael Woodhouse attempted to recapture the castle, now garrisoned by Parliament. The counter-attack was unsuccessful, ending in the rout of the Royalist forces in a skirmish at the nearby village of Wistanstow.

Unlike many castles in England which were deliberately seriously damaged, or slighted, to put them beyond military use, Stokesay escaped substantial harm after the war. Parliament sequestrated the property from William and ordered the slighting of the castle in 1647, but only pulled down the castle&#x27;s curtain wall, leaving the rest of the complex intact. Samuel returned in 1649 to continue to rent the castle during the years of the Commonwealth, and put in wood panelling and new windows into parts of the property. With the restoration of Charles II to the throne in 1660, William&#x27;s lands were returned to him, and the Baldwyns continued to lease Stokesay Castle from him.

===18th–19th centuries===
During the 18th century, Stokesay Castle continued to be leased by the Baldwyn family, although they sublet the property to a range of tenants; after this point it ceased to be used as a domestic dwelling. Two wood and plaster buildings, built against the side of the hall, were demolished around 1800, and by the early 19th century the castle was being used for storing grain and manufacturing, including barrel-making, coining and a smithy.

The castle began to deteriorate, and the antiquarian John Britton noted during his visit in 1813 that it had been &quot;abandoned to neglect, and rapidly advancing to ruin: the glass is destroyed, the ceilings and floors are falling, and the rains streams through the opening roof on the damp and mouldering walls&quot;. The smithy in the basement of the south tower resulted in a fire in 1830, which caused considerable damage to the castle, gutting the south tower. Extensive decay in the bases of the cruck tresses in the castle&#x27;s roof posed a particular threat to the hall, as the decaying roof began to push the walls apart.

Restoration work was carried out in the 1830s by William Craven, 2nd Earl of Craven. This was a deliberate attempt at conserving the existing building, rather than rebuilding it, and was a very unusual approach at this time. By 1845, stone buttresses and pillars had been added to support parts of the hall and its roof. Research by Thomas Turner was published in 1851, outlining the history of the castle. Frances Stackhouse Acton, a local landowner, took a particular interest in the castle, and in 1853 convinced William to carry out further repair work on the castle, under her supervision, at a cost of £103.

In 1869 the Craven estate, in size but by now heavily mortgaged, was purchased by John Derby Allcroft for £215,000. Allcroft was the head of Dents, a major glove manufacturer, through which he had become extremely wealthy. The estate included Stokesay Castle, where from around 1875 onwards Allcroft undertook extensive restoration work over several years. Stokesay was in serious need of repairs: the visiting writer Henry James noted in 1877 that the property was in &quot;a state of extreme decay&quot;.

Allcroft attempted what the archaeologist Gill Chitty has described as a &quot;simple and unaffected&quot; programme of work, which generally attempted to avoid excessive intervention. He may have been influenced by the contemporary writings of the local vicar, the Reverend James La Touche, who took a somewhat romanticised approach to the analysis of the castle&#x27;s history and architecture. The castle had become a popular sight for tourists and artists by the 1870s and the gatehouse was fitted out to form a house for a caretaker to oversee the property. Following the work, the castle was in good condition once again by the late 1880s.

===20th–21st centuries===
Further repairs to Stokesay Castle were required in 1902, carried out by Allcroft&#x27;s heir, Herbert, with help from the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. The Allcroft family faced increasing financial difficulty in the 20th century and the castle was formally opened for visitors in 1908, with much of the revenue reinvested in the property, but funds for repairs remained in short supply. By the 1930s the Allcroft estate was in serious financial difficulties, and the payment of two sets of death duties in 1946 and 1950 added to the family&#x27;s problems.

Despite receiving considerable numbers of visitors – over 16,000 in 1955 – it was becoming increasingly impractical to maintain the castle, and calls were made for the State to take over the property. For several decades the owners, Philip and Jewell Magnus-Allcroft, declined these proposals and continued to run the castle privately. In 1986 Jewell finally agreed to place Stokesay Castle into the guardianship of English Heritage, and the castle was left to the organisation on her death in 1992.

The castle was passed to English Heritage largely unfurnished, with minimal interpretative material in place, and it needed fresh restoration. There were various options for taking forward the work, including restoring the castle to resemble a particular period in its history; using interactive approaches such as &quot;living history&quot; to communicate the context to visitors; or using the site to demonstrate restoration techniques appropriate to different periods. These were rejected in favour of a policy of minimising any physical intervention during the restoration and preserving the building in the condition it was passed to English Heritage, including its unfurnished interior. The archaeologist Gill Chitty has described this as encouraging visitors to undergo a &quot;personal discovery of a sense of historical relationship and event&quot; around the castle. Against this background, an extensive programme of restoration work was carried out between August 1986 and December 1989.

In the 21st century, Stokesay Castle continues to be operated by English Heritage as a tourist attraction, receiving 39,218 visitors in 2010. British Airways, in conjunction with English Heritage, named their last Boeing 757 aircraft &quot;Stokesay Castle&quot; in 2010 for its final month of flying. The castle is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building and as a scheduled monument.

==Architecture==

===Structure===
Stokesay Castle was built on a patch of slightly rising ground in the basin of the River Onny. It took the form of a solar block and hall attached to a northern and southern tower; this combination of hall and tower existed elsewhere in England in the 13th century, particularly in northern England. A crenellated curtain wall, destroyed in the 17th century, enclosed a courtyard, with a gatehouse - probably originally constructed from stone, rebuilt in timber and plaster around 1640 - controlling the entrance. The wall would have reached high measured from the base of the moat. The courtyard, around by , contained additional buildings during the castle&#x27;s history, probably including a kitchen, bakehouse and storerooms, which were pulled down around 1800.

The castle was surrounded by a moat, between and across, although it is uncertain whether this was originally a dry moat, as it is in the 21st century, or water-filled from the pond and nearby stream. The spoil from digging out the moat was used to raise the height of the courtyard. Beyond the moat were a lake and ponds that were probably intended to be viewed from the south tower. The parish church of St John the Baptist, of Norman origins but largely rebuilt in the middle of the 17th century, lies just alongside the castle.

Stokesay Castle forms what archaeologist Gill Chitty describes as &quot;a comparatively complete ensemble&quot; of medieval buildings, and their survival, almost unchanged, is extremely unusual. Historian Henry Summerson considers it &quot;one of the best-preserved medieval fortified manor houses in England&quot;.

===Buildings===
The gatehouse is a two-storeyed, 17th-century building with exposed timber and plasterwork, constructed in a distinctively local Shropshire style. It features elaborate wooden carvings on the exterior and interior doorways, including angels, the biblical characters of Adam, Eve and the Serpent from the Garden of Eden, as well as dragons and other nude figures. It was designed as essentially an ornamental building, with little defensive value.

The south tower forms an unequal pentagon in shape, and has three storeys with thick walls. The walls were built to contain the stairs and garderobes, the unevenly positioned empty spaces weakening the structure, and this meant that two large buttresses had to be added to the tower during its construction to support the walls. The current floors are Victorian in origin, having been built after the fire of 1830, but the tower remains unglazed, as in the 13th century, with shutters at the windows providing protection in winter. The basement was originally only accessible from the first floor, and would have provided a secure area for storage, in addition to also containing a well. The first floor, which formed the original entrance to the tower, contains a 17th-century fireplace, reusing the original 13th-century chimney. The second floor has been subdivided in the past, but has been restored to form a single chamber, as it would have been when first built.

The roof of the south tower provides views of the surrounding landscape; in the 13th-century protective wooden mantlets would have been fitted into the gaps of the merlons along the battlements, and during the English Civil War it was equipped with additional wooden defences to protect the garrison.

The hall and solar block are adjacent to the south tower, and were designed to be symmetrical when seen from the courtyard, although the addition of the additional stone buttresses in the 19th century has altered this appearance. The hall is long and wide, with has three large, wooden 13th-century arches supporting the roof, unusually, given its size, using lateral wooden collars, but no vertical king-posts. The roof&#x27;s cruck joists now rest on 19th-century stone supports, but would have originally reached down to the ground. The roof is considered by the historian Henry Summerson to be a &quot;rare survival for the period&quot;. In the medieval period a wooden screen would have cut off the north end, providing a more secluded dining area.

The solar block has two storeys and a cellar, and would have probably acted as the living space for Laurence of Ludlow when he first moved into the castle. The solar room itself is on the first floor, and is reached by external steps. The wood panelling and carved wooden fireplace are of 17th-century origin, probably from around 1640. This woodwork would have originally been brightly painted, and included spy-holes so that the hall could be observed from the solar.

The three-storey north tower is reached by a 13th-century staircase in the hall, which leads onto the first floor. The first floor was divided into two separate rooms shortly after the construction of the tower, and contain various decorative tiles, probably from Laurence&#x27;s house in Ludlow. The walls of the second floor are mostly half-timbered, jettying out above the stone walls beneath them; the tower has its original 13th-century fireplace, although the wooden roof is 19th-century, modelled on the 13th-century original, and the windows are 17th-century insertions. The details and the carpenters&#x27; personal marks on the woodwork show that the hall, solar and north tower were all constructed under the direction of the same carpenter in the late 1280s and early 1290s.

===Interpretation===
Stokesay Castle was never intended to be a serious military fortification. As long ago as 1787, the antiquarian Francis Grose observed that it was &quot;a castellated mansion rather than a castle of strength&quot;, and more recently the historian Nigel Pounds has described the castle as forming &quot;a lightly fortified home&quot;, providing security but not intended to resist a military attack. The historian Henry Summerson describes its military features as &quot;superficial&quot;, and Oliver Creighton characterises Stokesay as being more of a &quot;picturesque residence&quot; than a fortification.

Among its weaknesses were the positioning of its gatehouse, on the wrong side of the castle, facing away from the road, and the huge windows in the hall, reaching down to the ground and making access relatively easy to any intruder. Indeed, this vulnerability may have been intentional. Its builder Laurence was a newly moneyed member of the upper class, and he may not have wanted to erect a fortification that would have threatened the established Marcher Lords in the region.

Nonetheless, Stokesay Castle was intended to have a dramatic, military appearance, echoing the castles then being built by Edward I in North Wales. Visitors would have approached the castle across a causeway, with an excellent view of the south tower, potentially framed by and reflected in the water-filled moat. The south tower was probably intended to resemble the gatehouses of contemporary castles such as Caernarfon and Denbigh, and would probably have originally shared the former&#x27;s &quot;banded&quot; stonework. Cordingley describes the south tower as &quot;adding prestige rather than security&quot;. Visitors would then have passed by the impressive outside of the main hall block, before entering the castle itself, which Robert Liddiard notes might have been an &quot;anticlimax from the point of view of the medieval visitor&quot;.

===Carved 17th-century woodwork===
==In folklore==
According to legend, Stokesay was once the home of two giants, one of whom lived on View Edge, and the other on Norton Camp. They kept their treasure in Stokesay Castle, but upon losing the key to the castle, they both died of grief.

<text>The siege or battle of Pavia was fought in 773–774 in northern Italy, near Ticinum (modern Pavia), and resulted in the victory of the Franks under Charlemagne against the Lombards under King Desiderius.

==Background==
Charlemagne, &quot;rex Francorum&quot;, had succeeded to the throne in 768 jointly with his brother Carloman. At the time there was antagonism between not only the two ruling brothers, but between the king of the Lombards, Desiderius, and the papacy. In 772, Pope Hadrian I expelled all the Lombard officials from the papal curia. In response, Desiderius invaded papal territory, even taking Otriculum (modern Otricoli), just a day&#x27;s march from Rome. Hadrian called Charlemagne for assistance.

Charles had produced an alliance with the Lombards by marrying one of Desiderius&#x27; daughters, Desiderata; within a year, however, he had changed his mind about the marriage and alliance, and divorced his wife, sending her back to her father. This was taken as an insult by the Lombards.

Upon the death of Carloman in 771, his own wife, Gerberge, fled the kingdom with her children for reasons now unclear (Einhard disingenuously protests that she spurned her husband&#x27;s brother &quot;for no reason at all&quot;) and sought refuge with Desiderius at Pavia. Desiderius now returned the insult to the Franks by giving her asylum, and protesting that her children be allowed their share of the Kingdom of the Franks. The relationship between Frank and Lombard now broke down completely and the pope took full advantage. His embassy landed at Marseille and travelled to Thionville, where they delivered this message:

Charlemagne ascertained the truth of Desiderius&#x27; aggressions and the threat he posed to his own Frankish realm and marched his troops towards Italy in the early summer of 773.

==Siege==
Charles&#x27; army had 10,000–40,000 troops; he divided it in half, giving command of one half to his uncle, Bernard, son of Charles Martel, and led it through the Alpine passes; he through that of the Dora Susa near Mont Cenis, and Bernard through the Great St Bernard Pass. At the foot of the mountains, Charles&#x27; army met the fortifications of Desiderius, but scouting forces found an alternate route. A cavalcade was sent to attack the defenders from the flank and, with Bernard&#x27;s forces approaching from the east, the Lombards fled to fortified Pavia. The Frankish troops then marched on to begin the siege of Pavia by September.

The entire Frankish army was capable of wholly surrounding the Lombard capital, however they had brought no siege engines. The Lombards too had failed in their preparations: the city was poorly stocked with food and the surrounding countryside was now in the hands of the Franks. Desiderius remained in Pavia, but Adelchis, his son, had left to stronger Verona to guard over the family of Carloman. Charles led a small force to besiege Verona. Adelchis fled in fear to Constantinople, and the city and Carloman&#x27;s family were taken.

Charles then began to subdue the whole region around Pavia in the early months of 774. Charles even visited the pope in Rome at Easter. No other Lombard dukes or counts made any attempt at relief and Desiderius made no strong counterattack. In the tenth month of the siege, famine was hitting Pavia hard and Desiderius, realising that he was left on his own, opened the gates to Charles and surrendered on some Tuesday in June.

==Legacy==
After the victory, Charlemagne had himself declared &quot;rex Langobardorum&quot;, and from that time onwards he was to be called &quot;King of the Franks &quot;and&quot; Lombards&quot;. This was unique in the history of the Germanic kingdoms of the Early Middle Ages: A current ruler taking the title of the conquered for his own. Charles was forging what could in modern language be called an &quot;empire&quot; proper; he was also allying himself very closely with the Church as its protector. His recognition of temporal Papal authority in central Italy helped lay the foundation for medieval Papal power.
The decline of the Lombard state had been swift, and the changes wrought in Italy by the Frankish conquest were great. Many Franks entered into positions of power and authority in Italy, though many Lombards, on account of their willingness to make peace with Charles, retained their positions.

As Paul K. Davis writes, &quot;The defeat and consequent destruction of the Lombard monarchy rid Rome of its most persistent threat to Papal security, laying the groundwork for the Holy Roman Empire.&quot;

== Memories of the siege ==
In Pavia, where the memory of the Lombard reasoning and the role of capital of the city characterized the urban identity for centuries, there are some testimonies of the siege, some contemporary, such as the sections of the first walls preserved in via dei Mulini, others, albeit later, very significant, such as the cycle of the stories of Saint Theodore of Pavia frescoed in the right aisle of the church of San Teodoro.

The painting, commissioned in 1514 by the rector of the church Giovanni Luchino Corti to an anonymous Lombard artist, depicts some episodes in the life of the holy bishop of Pavia and in particular during the siege of 773-774, which significantly fails in the pictorial cycle. Theodore in fact caused the Ticino waters to swell, flooding the Frankish camp and forcing Charlemagne to abandon the siege. In years in which the wars of Italy created strong uncertainties about the future of the city and of the entire duchy of Milan, the clients, by modifying the real outcome of the siege, intended to underline their strong identity and autonomy, as if the Lombard kingdom had not ever really fallen. 
Always linked to the memory of the siege is the small church of Santa Sofia (Torre d&#x27;Isola) located on a high terrace of Ticino a few kilometers west of the city, which according to a legend (based on the story handed down by the chronicler Notker the Stammerer) was built by Charlemagne during the siege of Pavia in just one day in order to better attend the divine services. However, beyond the imaginative narration of the chronicler, a royal residence certainly arose in the church in the ninth century, in which Louis II of Italy and then Charles the Bald stayed first in the year 876.

<text>The Battle of Pozzolo also known as the Battle of the Mincio River and [[Monzambano]] (25-26 December 1800) was fought during the War of the Second Coalition. A French army under General Guillaume Brune crossed the Mincio River and defeated an Austrian force under General Heinrich von Bellegarde. The Austrians were subsequently pushed back to Treviso where the Armistice of Treviso was signed. This truce would lead to the Treaty of Lunéville and the withdrawal of Austria from the war.

== Background ==
Bellegarde had concentrated 50,000 troops at the Mincio river in anticipation of crossing to attack French forces on the other side. However, he postponed his attack following news of the Austrian defeat at the Battle of Hohenlinden in Germany on 3 December 1800. Taking advantage of this delay, General Brune, who commanded 70,000 men, launched his own attack. He intended to make a decoy assault upon Pozzolo while his main force would cross at Mozambano. Another source credited the French with 66,000 soldiers and 160 guns and the Austrians with 38,000 infantry, 12,000 cavalry, and 100 guns.

== Forces ==
Brune&#x27;s Army of Italy consisted of Right, Center, and Left Wings, an Advanced Guard, and a Reserve. Antoine Guillaume Delmas led the Advance Guard which numbered 10,510 soldiers, including 1,240 cavalry and 160 gunners with 12 artillery pieces. Pierre Dupont de l&#x27;Étang commanded the Right Wing which counted 9,760 infantry, 810 cavalry, and 380 artillerists with 28 guns. The Right Wing included two divisions under Jean-Charles Monnier and François Watrin. Louis-Gabriel Suchet directed the Center with 12,360 infantry, 1,120 cavalry, and no guns. The Center had two divisions under Louis Henri Loison and Honoré Théodore Maxime Gazan de la Peyrière. Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey led the Left Wing which numbered 13,020 infantry, no cavalry, and 420 gunners with 17 artillery pieces. The Left Wing&#x27;s two divisions were under Jean Boudet and Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau. Louis-Nicolas Davout and Claude Ignace François Michaud commanded the Reserve with 10,910 infantry, 4,380 cavalry, and 1,100 artillerists with 103 guns. Gaspard Amédée Gardanne led one division and François Étienne de Kellermann led the heavy cavalry division.

== Battle ==
Dupont&#x27;s corps crossed the river near Pozzolo on Christmas Day 1800 under heavy Austrian artillery fire. This force made a feint on Pozzolo whilst a temporary bridge was constructed at nearby Molino della Bolta. Dupont moved two divisions and a battery of 25 artillery pieces across the new bridge and constructed defences.

Following reinforcement from Suchet, the French defeated an Austrian midday counterattack and successfully took the village of Pozzolo. A second Austrian attack launched at 1:00 pm and was formed of Hungarian troops led by Konrad Valentin von Kaim. They retook the village and forced the French back to their bridgehead. Heavy French artillery fire prevented further progress and a renewed French assault recaptured the village, taking five guns and 700-800 prisoners.

Suchet then constructed a second bridge which allowed a whole French division to cross the river unopposed. The village of Pozzolo was bitterly fought over, changing hands a further three times before a final French assault secured it just before dusk. It was during this fighting that General Kaim was mortally wounded. During the night, the Austrians took advantage of a clear moonlit night to attack the French bivouacs.

From 5:00 am on 26 December French troops constructed another bridge at Monzambano, under the cover of dense fog and supporting fire from 40 guns. They then launched an assault upon the Monte Bianco hills, which were held by around 35,000 Austrians. The Austrians were driven back to Salionze and a French force under Delmas captured Valeggio sul Mincio. Later in the day an Austrian counterattack briefly retook the village before Delmas finally secured it. The French reinforced their positions during the afternoon and defeated an Austrian counterattack in the hills. 

Austrian losses in the battle were around 7,000 men and 40 guns. A second source asserted that the French sustained 4,000 casualties, including General of Brigade André Calvin killed. The Austrians suffered losses of 807 killed, 4,067 wounded, 3,984 captured, and 313 missing, or a total of 9,171. General officer losses were Kaim killed and Charles Alain Gabriel de Rohan wounded. The French captured 14 3-pounder, six 6-pounder, and three 12-pounder cannons, and six 7-pounder howitzers.

== Aftermath ==
Bellegarde withdrew his forces overnight on 26-27 December and pulled back beyond the Adige river. Brune cautiously followed up the Austrian retreat and paused at the river to await the arrival of his pontoon bridging teams. Bellegarde withdrew his troops further to attempt to join with some reinforcements which allowed the French to cross the Adige river unopposed.

After a series of small engagements, the French reached Treviso where an armistice was signed on 16 January 1801. The cessation of hostilities was made permanent with the Treaty of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, which ended the Austrian involvement in the war.

<doc id="157720" wikidata="Q1868040" url="?curid=157720" title="The Logic of Scientific Discovery">
<text>The Logic of Scientific Discovery is a 1959 book about the philosophy of science by the philosopher Karl Popper. Popper rewrote his book in English from the 1934 (imprint &#x27;1935&#x27;) German original, titled &quot;Logik der Forschung. Zur Erkenntnistheorie der modernen Naturwissenschaft&quot;, which literally translates as, &quot;Logic of Research: On the Epistemology of Modern Natural Science&quot;&#x27;.

==Summary==
Popper argues that science should adopt a methodology based on falsifiability, because no number of experiments can ever prove a theory, but a reproducible experiment or observation can refute one. According to Popper: &quot;non-reproducible single occurrences are of no significance to science. Thus a few stray basic statements contradicting a theory will hardly induce us to reject it as falsified. We shall take it as falsified only if we discover a reproducible effect which refutes the theory&quot;. Popper argues that science should adopt a methodology based on &quot;an &quot;asymmetry&quot; between verifiability and falsifiability; an asymmetry which results from the logical form of universal statements. For these are never derivable from singular statements, but can be contradicted by singular statements&quot;.

==Reception==
The psychologist Harry Guntrip wrote that its publication &quot;greatly stimulated the discussion of the nature of scientific knowledge&quot;, including by philosophers who did not completely agree with Popper, such as Thomas Kuhn and Horace Romano Harré. The psychiatrist Carl Jung, founder of analytical psychology, valued the work. The biographer Vincent Brome recalls Jung remarking in 1938 that it exposed &quot;some of the shortcomings of science&quot;. The philosopher Paul Ricœur endorsed &quot;procedures of invalidation&quot; similar to Popper&#x27;s criteria for falsifiability. The historian Peter Gay described the work as &quot;an important treatise in epistemology&quot;. The philosopher Bryan Magee considered Popper&#x27;s criticisms of logical positivism &quot;devastating&quot;. In his view, Popper&#x27;s most important argument against logical positivism is that, while it claimed to be a scientific theory of the world, its central tenet, the verification principle, effectively destroyed all of science. The physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont argued that critiques of Popper&#x27;s work have provoked an &quot;irrationalist drift&quot;, and that a significant part of the problems that currently affect the philosophy of science &quot;can be traced to ambiguities or inadequacies&quot; in &quot;The Logic of Scientific Discovery&quot;. The essayist Nassim Nicholas Taleb, in his book &quot;The Black Swan&quot;, mentions Popper&#x27;s theory of falsification as a way to combat the effects of confirmation bias, crediting his &quot;insight concerning the fundamental, severe, and incurable unpredictability of the world.&quot;

<text>Timothy Lancaster West (20 October 1934 – 12 November 2024) was an English actor with a long and varied career across theatre, film, and television. He began acting in repertory theatres in the 1950s before making his London stage debut in 1959 moving on to three seasons with the Royal Shakespeare Company during the 1960s. During his life, West played &quot;King Lear&quot; (four times) and &quot;Macbeth&quot; (twice) along with other notable roles in &quot;The Master Builder&quot; and &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;. In 1978, West was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Actor of the Year in a Revival for his performance in &quot;The Homecoming&quot;.

On screen, his breakout role was playing King Edward VII in the television series &quot;Edward the Seventh&quot; in 1975, earning him his first nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor, with a second following in 1980. West appeared in major films such as &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; (1971), &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; (1973), and &quot;The Thirty Nine Steps&quot; (1978). His television highlights included &quot;Brass&quot; (1982–1990), &quot;Bedtime&quot; (2001–2003), and &quot;Churchill and the Generals&quot; for which he won a Royal Television Society award in 1980.

As a director, West led productions at the Forum Theatre in Melbourne, Australia and the Old Vic in London. He was also known for his collaborations with his second wife, actress Prunella Scales, in both acting and personal projects.

==Early life and education==
Timothy Lancaster West was born on 20 October 1934 in Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire, the only son of Olive (née Carleton-Crowe; 1902–1985) and actor Lockwood West (1905–1989). He had a sister Patricia who was five years younger than he. He was educated at the John Lyon School, Harrow on the Hill, at Bristol Grammar School, where he was a classmate of Julian Glover, and at Regent Street Polytechnic (now the University of Westminster).

==Career==
West worked as an office furniture salesman and as a recording technician before becoming an assistant stage manager at the Wimbledon Theatre in 1956. 

===Stage===
West played repertory seasons in Newquay, Hull, Northampton, Worthing and Salisbury before making his London debut at the Piccadilly Theatre in 1959 in the farce &quot;Caught Napping&quot;. He was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company for three seasons: the 1962 Arts Theatre Experimental season (&quot;Nil Carborundum&quot; and &quot;Afore Night Come&quot;), the 1964 &#x27;Dirty Plays&#x27; season (&quot;Victor&quot;, the premiere production of &quot;Marat/Sade&quot; and the revival of &quot;Afore Night Come&quot;) and the 1965 season at Stratford and later at the Aldwych Theatre appearing in &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot;, &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;, &quot;The Jew of Malta&quot;, &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; and Peter Hall&#x27;s production of &quot;The Government Inspector&quot;, in a company which included Paul Scofield, Eric Porter, Janet Suzman, Paul Rogers, Ian Richardson, Glenda Jackson and Peter McEnery.

===Screen===
Having spent years as a familiar face who never quite became a household name, West&#x27;s big break came with the major television series &quot;Edward the Seventh&quot; (1975), in which he played the title role from age 23 until the King&#x27;s death; his real-life sons, Samuel and Joseph, played the sons of the King as children. His father, Lockwood West, also portrayed King Edward VII in 1972 in an episode of the LWT television drama series &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;. Other screen appearances included &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; (1971), &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; (1973), &quot;The Thirty Nine Steps&quot; (1978), &quot;Masada&quot; (1981), &quot;Cry Freedom&quot; (1987) and Luc Besson&#x27;s &quot;The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc&quot; (1999). In Richard Eyre&#x27;s &quot;Iris&quot; (2001) he played Maurice and his son Samuel West played Maurice as a young man.

West starred as patriarch Bradley Hardacre in Granada TV&#x27;s satirical Northern super-soap &quot;Brass&quot; over three seasons (1982–1990). He appeared in the series &quot;Miss Marple&quot; in 1985 (in &quot;A Pocket Full of Rye&quot; as the notorious Rex Fortescue) and made an appearance as Professor Furie in &quot;A Very Peculiar Practice&quot; in 1986. In 1997, he played Gloucester in the BBC television production of &quot;King Lear&quot;, with Ian Holm as Lear. From 2001 to 2003, he played the grumpy and frequently volatile Andrew in the BBC drama series &quot;Bedtime&quot;.

In 1989, West played Nigel in the Thames Television sitcom &quot;After Henry&quot; alongside his real-life wife, Prunella Scales, who played Sarah France. They appeared together in the episode &#x27;Upstagers&#x27;, shown on 21 March 1989.

At Christmas 2007, he joined &quot;Not Going Out&quot; as Geoffrey Adams. He reprised the role in two episodes of series three; Geoffrey Whitehead played the role in later seasons. In 2011, he appeared alongside John Simm and Jim Broadbent in the BBC series &quot;Exile&quot;, written by BAFTA-winning Danny Brocklehurst.

In February 2013, West joined the cast of ITV soap &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, playing Eric Babbage. He joined the cast of &quot;EastEnders&quot; in 2013, playing Stan Carter from January 2014. He filmed his final scenes for &quot;EastEnders&quot; in February 2015.

In 2019, West played Private Godfrey in &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army: The Lost Episodes&quot;, a recreation of three missing episodes of the BBC comedy &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;.

His final acting role was in the penultimate episode of the BBC daytime series &quot;Doctors&quot;, which was screened the day after his death.

===Directing===
West was artistic director of the Forum Theatre, Billingham, in 1973, where he directed &quot;We Bombed in New Haven&quot; by Joseph Heller, &quot;The Oz Obscenity Trial&quot; by David Livingstone and &quot;The National Health&quot; by Peter Nichols. He was co-artistic director of the Prospect Theatre Company at the Old Vic from 1980 to 1981, where he directed &quot;Trelawny of the &#x27;Wells&#x27;&quot; and &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. He was director-in-residence at the University of Western Australia in 1982.

In 2004, West toured Australia with the Carl Rosa Opera Company as director of a production of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, also singing the role of Sir Joseph Porter.

==Personal life and death==
West was married to actress Jacqueline Boyer from 1956 to 1961 with whom he had a daughter. In 1963 he married actress Prunella Scales, with whom he had two sons, actor Samuel West and Joseph.

<text>The Battle of Rastatt (5 July 1796) saw part of a Republican French army under Jean Victor Marie Moreau clash with elements of the Habsburg army under Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour which were defending the line of the Murg River. Leading a wing of Moreau&#x27;s army, Louis Desaix attacked the Austrians and drove them back to the Alb River in the War of the First Coalition action. Rastatt is a city in the state of Baden-Württemberg in Germany, located south of Mannheim and west of Stuttgart.

In the Rhine Campaign of 1796, Moreau&#x27;s army made a successful assault crossing of the Rhine River at Kehl on 24 June. Moreau expanded his bridgehead, sending Desaix north, Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr east and Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino south. The French won a clash over Anton Sztáray at Renchen on the 28th before moving against Latour at Rastatt. Soon afterward, Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen joined Latour with reinforcements from the north. The Battle of Ettlingen on 9 July determined whether Moreau would continue his invasion of Germany.

==Background==

The Rhine Campaign of 1795 (April 1795 to January 1796) opened when two Habsburg armies under the overall command of François Sébastien Charles Joseph de Croix, Count of Clerfayt defeated an attempt by two Republican French armies to cross the Rhine River and capture the Fortress of Mainz. At the start of the campaign the French Army of the Sambre and Meuse led by Jean-Baptiste Jourdan confronted Clerfayt&#x27;s Army of the Lower Rhine in the north, while the French Army of Rhine and Moselle under Pichegru lay opposite Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser&#x27;s army in the south. In August, Jourdan crossed and quickly seized Düsseldorf. The Army of the Sambre and Meuse advanced south to the Main River, completely isolating Mainz. Pichegru&#x27;s army made a surprise capture of Mannheim so that both French armies held significant footholds on the east bank of the Rhine. The French fumbled away the promising start to their offensive. Pichegru bungled at least one opportunity to seize Clerfayt&#x27;s supply base in the Battle of Handschuhsheim. With Pichegru unexpectedly inactive, Clerfayt massed against Jourdan, beat him at Höchst in October and forced most of the Army of the Sambre and Meuse to retreat to the west bank of the Rhine. About the same time, Wurmser sealed off the French bridgehead at Mannheim. With Jourdan temporarily out of the picture, the Austrians defeated the left wing of the Army of Rhine and Moselle at the Battle of Mainz and moved down the west bank. In November, Clerfayt gave Pichegru a drubbing at Pfeddersheim and successfully wrapped up the Siege of Mannheim. In January 1796, Clerfayt concluded an armistice with the French, allowing the Austrians to retain large portions of the west bank. During the campaign Pichegru had entered into negotiations with French Royalists. It is debatable whether Pichegru&#x27;s treason or bad generalship was the actual cause of the French failure. which lasted until 20 May 1796, when the Austrians announced that it would end on 31 May. This set the stage for continued action during the campaign months of May through October 1796.
===Terrain===
The Rhine River flows west along the border between the German states and the Swiss Cantons. The stretch between Rheinfall, by Schaffhausen and Basel, the High Rhine cuts through steep hillsides over a gravel bed; in such places as the former rapids at Laufenburg, it moved in torrents. A few miles north and east of Basel, the terrain flattens. The Rhine makes a wide, northerly turn, in what is called the Rhine knee, and enters the so-called Rhine ditch (&quot;Rheingraben&quot;), part of a rift valley bordered by the Black Forest on the east and Vosges Mountains on the west. In 1796, the plain on both sides of the river, some wide, was dotted with villages and farms. At both far edges of the flood plain, especially on the eastern side, the old mountains created dark shadows on the horizon. Tributaries cut through the hilly terrain of the Black Forest, creating deep defiles in the mountains. The tributaries then wind in rivulets through the flood plain to the river.

The Rhine River itself looked different in the 1790s than it does in the twenty-first century; the passage from Basel to Iffezheim was &quot;corrected&quot; (straightened) between 1817 and 1875. Between 1927 and 1975, a canal was constructed to control the water level. In the 1790s, the river was wild and unpredictable, in some places four or more times wider than the twenty-first century incarnation of the river, even under regular conditions. Its channels wound through marsh and meadow, and created islands of trees and vegetation that were periodically submerged by floods. It was crossable at Kehl, by Strasbourg, and Hüningen, by Basel, where systems of viaducts and causeways made access reliable.

===Political complications===
The German-speaking states on the east bank of the Rhine were part of the vast complex of territories in central Europe called the Holy Roman Empire. The considerable number of territories in the Empire included more than 1,000 entities. Their size and influence varied, from the &quot;Kleinstaaterei&quot;, the little states that covered no more than a few square miles, or included several non-contiguous pieces, to the small and complex territories of the princely Hohenlohe family branches, to such sizable, well-defined territories as the Kingdoms of Bavaria and Prussia. The governance of these many states varied: they included the autonomous free imperial cities, also of different sizes and influence, from the powerful Augsburg to the minuscule Weil der Stadt; ecclesiastical territories, also of varying sizes and influence, such as the wealthy Abbey of Reichenau and the powerful Archbishopric of Cologne; and dynastic states such as Württemberg. When viewed on a map, the Empire resembled a &quot;patchwork carpet&quot;. Both the Habsburg domains and Hohenzollern Prussia also included territories outside the Empire. There were also territories completely surrounded by France that belonged to Württemberg, the Archbishopric of Trier, and Hesse-Darmstadt. Among the German-speaking states, the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s administrative and legal mechanisms provided a venue to resolve disputes between peasants and landlords, between jurisdictions, and within jurisdictions. Through the organization of imperial circles, also called &quot;Reichskreise&quot;, groups of states consolidated resources and promoted regional and organizational interests, including economic cooperation and military protection.

===Disposition===
The armies of the First Coalition included the contingents and the infantry and cavalry of the various states, amounted to about 125,000 troops (including the three autonomous corps), a sizable force by eighteenth century standards but a moderate force by the standards of the Revolutionary wars. Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen and brother of the Holy Roman Emperor, served as commander-in-chief. In total, Charles’ troops stretched in a line from Switzerland to the North Sea. Habsburg troops comprised the bulk of the army but the thin white line of Habsburg infantry could not cover the territory from Basel to Frankfurt with sufficient depth to resist the pressure of the opposition. Compared to French coverage, Charles had half the number of troops covering a 211-mile front, stretching from Renchen, near Basel to Bingen. Furthermore, he had concentrated the bulk of his force, commanded by Count Baillet Latour, between Karlsruhe and Darmstadt, where the confluence of the Rhine and the Main made an attack most likely, as it offered a gateway into eastern German states and ultimately to Vienna, with good bridges crossing a relatively well-defined river bank. To the north, Wilhelm von Wartensleben’s autonomous corps stretched in a thin line between Mainz and Giessen.

In spring 1796, drafts from the free imperial cities, and other imperial estates in the Swabian and Franconian Circles augmented the Habsburg force with perhaps 20,000 men at the most. The militias, most of which were Swabian field hands and day laborers drafted for service in the spring of that year, were untrained and unseasoned. As he gathered his army in March and April, it was largely guess work where they should be placed. In particular, Charles did not like to use the militias in any vital location. Consequently, in May and early June, when the French started to mass troops by Mainz and it looked as if the bulk of the French army would cross there—they even engaged the imperial force at Altenkirchen (4 June) and Wetzler and Uckerath (15 June)—Charles felt few qualms placing the 7000-man Swabian militia at the crossing by Kehl.

==French plans==
An assault into the German states was essential, as far as French commanders understood, not only in terms of war aims, but also in practical terms: the French Directory believed that war should pay for itself, and did not budget for the feeding of its troops. The French citizen’s army, created by mass conscription of young men and systematically divested of old men who might have tempered the rash impulses of teenagers and young adults, had already made itself unwelcome throughout France. It was an army entirely dependent for support upon the countryside it occupied for provisions and wages. Until 1796, wages were paid in the worthless &quot;assignat&quot; (France&#x27;s paper currency); after April 1796, although pay was made in metallic value, wages were still in arrears. Throughout that spring and early summer, the French army was in almost constant mutiny: in May 1796, in the border town of Zweibrücken, the 74th Demi-brigade revolted. In June, the 17th Demi-brigade was insubordinate (frequently) and in the 84th Demi-brigade, two companies rebelled.

The French faced a formidable obstacle in addition to the Rhine. The Coalition&#x27;s Army of the Lower Rhine counted 90,000 troops. The 20,000-man right wing under Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of Württemberg stood on the east bank of the Rhine behind the Sieg River, observing the French bridgehead at Düsseldorf. The garrisons of Mainz Fortress and Ehrenbreitstein Fortress included 10,000 more. The remainder held the west bank behind the Nahe River. Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser, who initially commanded the whole operation, led the 80,000-strong Army of the Upper Rhine. Its right wing occupied Kaiserslautern on the west bank while the left wing under Anton Sztáray, Michael von Fröhlich and Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé guarded the Rhine from Mannheim to Switzerland. The original Austrian strategy was to capture Trier and to use their position on the Rhine&#x27;s west bank to strike at each of the French armies in turn. However, after news arrived in Vienna of Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s successes in northern Italy, Wurmser was sent to Italy with 25,000 reinforcements; the Aulic Council gave Archduke Charles command over both Austrian armies and ordered him to hold his ground.

On the French side, the 80,000-man Army of Sambre-et-Meuse held the west bank of the Rhine down to the Nahe and then southwest to Sankt Wendel. On this army&#x27;s left flank, Jean Baptiste Kléber had 22,000 troops entrenched at Düsseldorf. The right wing of the Army of the Rhine and Moselle, under Jean Victor Moreau&#x27;s command, was positioned east of the Rhine from Hüningen (on the border with the French provinces, Switzerland, and the German states) northward, with its center along the Queich River near Landau and its left wing extended west toward Saarbrücken. Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino commanded Moreau&#x27;s right wing at Hüningen, Louis Desaix commanded the center and Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr directed the left wing and included two divisions commanded by Guillaume Philibert Duhesme, and Alexandre Camille Taponier. Ferino&#x27;s wing included three infantry and cavalry divisions under François Antoine Louis Bourcier, and general of division Augustin Tuncq, and Henri François Delaborde. Desaix&#x27;s command included three divisions led by Michel de Beaupuy, Antoine Guillaume Delmas and Charles Antoine Xaintrailles.

The French plan called for its two armies to press against the flanks of the Coalition&#x27;s northern armies in the German states while simultaneously a third army approached Vienna through Italy. Specifically, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan&#x27;s army would push south from Düsseldorf, hopefully drawing troops and attention toward themselves, which would allow Moreau’s army an easier crossing of the Rhine and Huningen and Kehl. If all went according to plan, Jourdan’s army could feint toward Mannheim, which would force Charles to reapportion his troops. Once Charles moved the mass of his army to the north, Moreau’s army, which early in the year had been stationed by Speyer, would move swiftly south to Strasbourg. From there, they could cross the river at Kehl, which was guarded by 7,000-man inexperienced and lightly trained militia—troops recruited that spring from the Swabian circle polities. In the south, by Basel, Ferino’s column was to move speedily across the river and advanced up the Rhine along the Swiss and German shoreline, toward Lake Constance and spread into the southern end of the Black Forest. Ideally, this would encircle and trap Charles and his army as the left wing of Moreau&#x27;s army swung behind him, and as Jourdan&#x27;s force cut off his flank with Wartensleben&#x27;s autonomous corps.

== Battle ==
===Preliminary===
Responding to the French feint, Charles committed most of his forces on the middle and northern Rhine, leaving only the Swabian militia at the Kehl-Strasbourg crossing, and a minor force commanded by Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg at Rastatt. In addition, a small force of about 5,000 French royalists under the command of the Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé, supposedly covering the Rhine from Switzerland to Freiburg im Breisgau. Once Charles committed his main army to the mid and northern Rhine, however, Moreau executed an about face, and a forced march with most his army and arrived at Strasburg before Charles realized the French had even left Speyer. To accomplish this march rapidly, Moreau left his artillery behind; infantry and cavalry move more swiftly. On 20 June, his troops assaulted the forward posts between Strasbourg and the river, overwhelming the pickets there; the militia withdrew to Kehl, leaving behind their cannons, which solved part of Moreau&#x27;s artillery problem.

At Hüningen, near Basel, on the same day that Moreau&#x27;s advance guard crossed at Kehl, Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino executed a full crossing, and advanced unopposed east along the German shore of the Rhine, with the 16th and 50th Demi-brigades, the 68th, 50th and 68th line infantry, and six squadrons of cavalry that included the 3rd and 7th Hussars and the 10th Dragoons. This gave the French the desired pincer effect, with the Army of the Sambre and Meuse approaching from the north, the bulk of the Army of the Rhine and Moselle crossing in the center, and Ferino crossing in the south.

Within a day, Moreau had four divisions across the river, representing a fundamental success of the French plan, and they executed their plan with alacrity. From the south, Ferino pursued Fröhlich and the Condé in a wide sweep east-north-east toward Villingen while Gouvion Saint-Cyr chased the &quot;Kreistruppen&quot; into Rastatt. Latour and Sztáray tried to hold the line of the river Murg. The French employed 19,000 foot soldiers and 1,500 horsemen in the divisions of Alexandre Camille Taponier and François Antoine Louis Bourcier. The Austrian brought 6,000 men into action under the command of Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg and Johann Mészáros von Szoboszló. The French captured 200 Austrians and three field pieces.

===Battle===
On 5 July 1796, Desaix approached Latour at the Rastat.t

=== Impact===
By turning both Latour&#x27;s flanks, Desaix drove his Imperial and Habsburg combined force back to the river Alb. The Habsburg and Imperial armies did not have enough troops to hold off the Army of the Rhine and Moselle and would need reinforcements from Charles, who was occupied in the north keeping Jourdan pinned down on the west bank of the Rhine.

Recognizing the need for reinforcements, and fearing his army would be flanked by Moreau&#x27;s surprise crossings at Kehl and Hüningen, Charles arrived near Rastatt with additional troops and prepared to advance against Moreau on 10 July. The French surprised him by attacking first, on 9 July. Despite the surprise, in the Battle of Ettlingen, Charles repulsed Desaix&#x27;s attacks on his right flank, but Saint-Cyr and Taponier gained ground in the hills to the east of the town, and threatened his flank. Moreau lost 2,400 out of 36,000 men while Charles had 2,600 &quot;hors de combat&quot; out of 32,000 troops. Anxious about the security of his supply lines, though, Charles began a measured and careful retreat to the east.

<text>The Battle of Rivoli (14 January 1797) was a key military engagement during the War of the First Coalition near the village of Rivoli, then part of the Republic of Venice. In the climax of the Italian campaign of 1796-1797, the outnumbered French Army of Italy commanded by General Napoleon Bonaparte decisively defeated the attacking Austrian army commanded by General of the Artillery Jozsef Alvinczi, who was attempting to march south in a fourth and final attempt to relieve the siege of Mantua. The French victory at Rivoli further demonstrated Bonaparte&#x27;s capability and deftness as a military commander, and led to the Austrian surrender of Mantua in February, French consolidation of northern Italy, and ultimately France&#x27;s victory over Austria in the war later that year.

==Forces==
See order of battle at the Battle of Rivoli.

==Prelude==
Alvinczi&#x27;s plan was to rush and overwhelm Barthélemy Joubert in the mountains east of Lake Garda by concentrating 28,000 men in five separate columns, and thereby gain access to the open country north of Mantua where Austrian superior numbers would be able to defeat Bonaparte&#x27;s smaller Army of Italy. Alvinczi attacked Joubert&#x27;s 10,000 men on 12 January. However Joubert held him off and was subsequently joined by Louis-Alexandre Berthier and, at 2 am on 14 January, by Bonaparte, who brought up elements of André Masséna&#x27;s division to support Joubert&#x27;s efforts to form a defensive line on favorable ground just north of Rivoli on the Trambasore Heights. The battle would be a contest between Alvinczi&#x27;s efforts to concentrate his dispersed columns versus the arrival of French reinforcements.

==Battle==
The morning of Saturday 14 January found Alvinczi engaging the division of Joubert. He had united three Austrian columns between Caprino on the right and the chapel of San Marco on the left; the brigade of Franz Josef de Lusignan was advancing to the north of Monte Baldo; and the troops of Peter Vitus von Quosdanovich and Josef Philipp Vukassovich were pouring down the roads on either side of the Adige. Before daybreak as the French were moving on the road from Rivoli to Incanale Joubert attacked and drove the Austrians from the chapel of San Marco.

At 9 a.m., the Austrian brigades of Samuel Koblos and Anton Lipthay counterattacked the French forces on the Trambasore Heights. Another column under Prince Heinrich of Reuss-Plauen attempted to turn the French right via the Rivoli gorge. Meanwhile, on the French right flank, Vukassovich had advanced down the east bank of the Adige and had established batteries opposite Osteria. The fire of his guns and the pressure from Quosdanovich forced the French out of the village of Osteria and onto the Rivoli plateau. By about 11 a.m. the position of Bonaparte was becoming desperate: an Austrian column under Lusignan was cutting off his retreat south of Rivoli. To reopen his line of retreat Bonaparte turned to Massena&#x27;s 18th Demi-brigade (&quot;the Brave&quot;), newly arrived from Lake Garda. Meanwhile, Alvinczi was on the Trambasore Heights urging his victorious battalions forward, though they were unformed by combat and rough terrain.

With the 18th dispatched to check Lusignan, Bonaparte turned all his attention to Quosdanovich. He understood the defeat of this column was the key to the battle. Unfortunately the French had very few reserves left and mostly had to accomplish this with troops already at hand. Making the best of interior lines and his advantage in artillery, Bonaparte thinned out Joubert&#x27;s lines facing the Austrians frontally at the Trambasore Heights as much as possible and concentrated them before the gorge. A battery of 15 French guns were massed and poured canister shot at point blank range into the advancing Austrian column that was emerging from the gorge. This devastating firepower struck first on the advancing Austrian dragoons who broke and stampeded through their own infantry causing mass chaos. At this juncture the brigade of Charles Leclerc assaulted the column frontally while Joubert laid down heavy flanking fire from San Marco. Here Antoine Charles de Lasalle with just 26 horseman of the 22nd Horse Chasseurs charged into the melee. Lasalle&#x27;s men captured a whole Austrian battalion and seized 5 enemy flags.
In the centre the battle was not yet won; Joseph Ocskay renewed his attack from San Marco and drove back the brigade of Honoré Vial. But at midday French cavalry under Joachim Murat charged the flanks of Ocskay&#x27;s troops, which were driven back to the positions they occupied in the morning.

Quosdanovich realized he could not force the defile and ordered his troops to fall back out of artillery range. Meanwhile, while Lusignan was being engaged frontally by the brigade of Guillaume Brune, the division of Gabriel Rey, coming up from Castelnuovo and the brigade of Claude Victor (reserve) began to arrive. They crushed the Austrian column of Lusignan who fled west with less than 2,000 men remaining.
The French lost 3,200 killed and wounded and 1,000 captured, while the Austrians suffered 4,000 killed and wounded, plus 8,000 men and 40 guns captured. Although the number of prisoners can reach 10,000, the total losses exceed two-thirds of the total number of the army. One authority gives the French 5,000 and the Austrians 14,000 total losses.

==Aftermath==
The next day Joubert and Rey began a successful pursuit of Alvinczi, all but destroying his columns, the remnants of which fled north up into the Adige Valley in confusion. The Battle of Rivoli was Bonaparte&#x27;s greatest victory at the time. After that he turned his attention to Giovanni di Provera. On 13 January his corps (9,000 men) had crossed north of Legnano and driven straight for the relief of Mantua which was besieged by French forces under Jean Sérurier. At night on 15 January Provera sent a message to Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser to break out in a concerted attack. On 16 January, when Wurmser attacked he was driven back into Mantua by Sérurier. The Austrians were attacked from the front by Masséna (who had force marched from Rivoli) and from the rear by the division of Pierre Augereau, and were thus forced to surrender the entire force. The Austrian army in North Italy had ceased to exist. On 2 February Mantua surrendered with its garrison of 16,000 men, all that remained of an army of 30,000. The troops marched out with the &#x27;honours of war&#x27;, and laid down their arms. Wurmser with his staff and an escort were allowed to go free. The remainder were sent to Austria after swearing an oath to not serve against the French for a year, 1,500 guns were found in the fortress. On 18 February Bonaparte proceeded with 8,000 men to Rome, determined to come to a settlement with the Papal States, which had shown covert hostility so long as the campaign had proceeded with uncertainty as to the fate of Italy. But with the fall of Mantua the Austrians were finally driven from Italian soil, and Pope Pius VI agreed to an armistice dictated by Bonaparte in Tolentino. Snow had closed the Alpine passes, but Austria still refused Bonaparte terms of a peace agreement. He prepared one last campaign to the east, into the heartland of Austria to the gates of Vienna itself.

==Legacy==
The Rue de Rivoli, a street in central Paris, is named after the battle.

<text>Richard David Briers (14 January 1934 – 17 February 2013) was an English actor whose five-decade career encompassed film, radio, stage and television.

Briers first came to prominence as George Starling in &quot;Marriage Lines&quot; (1961–66), but it was a few years later, when he narrated &quot;Roobarb&quot; (1974–76) and &quot;Noah and Nelly in... SkylArk&quot; (1976–77) and played Tom Good in the BBC sitcom &quot;The Good Life&quot; (1975–78), that he became a household name. He starred as Martin in &quot;Ever Decreasing Circles&quot; (1984–89), and had a leading role as Hector in &quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot; (2000–05). From the late 1980s, with Kenneth Branagh as director, he performed Shakespearean roles in &quot;Henry V&quot; (1989), &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (1993), &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1996) and &quot;As You Like It&quot; (2006), and also appeared in Branagh’s &quot;Swan Song&quot; (1992), &quot;Peter&#x27;s Friends&quot; (1992), &quot;Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein&quot; (1994), and &quot;In the Bleak Midwinter&quot; (1995).
==Early life==
Briers was born on 14 January 1934 in Raynes Park, Surrey, the son of Joseph Benjamin Briers (1901–1980) and his second wife Morna Phyllis (1909–1992), daughter of Frederick Richardson, of the Indian Civil Service. He was the first cousin once removed of actor Terry-Thomas (Terry-Thomas was his father&#x27;s cousin). He spent his childhood at Raynes Park in a flat, Number 2 Pepys Court, behind the now demolished Rialto cinema, and later at Guildford. His father, Joseph Briers, was the son of a stockbroker, of a family of Middlesex tenant farmers; a gregarious and popular man, he contended with a nervous disposition, and drifted between jobs, spending most of his life as a bookmaker but also working as, amongst other things, an estate agent&#x27;s clerk and a factory worker for an air filter manufacturer, as well as being a gifted amateur singer who attended classes at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. His mother, Morna Briers, was a concert pianist and a drama and music teacher, and a member of Equity, who wished for a showbusiness career, having acted in her youth. The couple had met when Joseph Briers asked Morna to stand in for his regular pianist for a performance; by this time his first marriage had collapsed and six months later they had entered a relationship. The family occasionally received money from a wealthy relation, and Briers&#x27;s maternal grandparents paid for his education, despite not being particularly well-off, and having lived in slightly reduced circumstances in India before returning to England and coming to live at Wimbledon.

Briers attended Rokeby School in Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey, and, having failed the examination for King&#x27;s College School, the Ridgeway School in Wimbledon, which he left at the age of 16 without any formal qualifications.

==Early career==
Briers&#x27;s first job was a clerical post with a London cable manufacturer, and for a short time he went to evening classes to qualify in electrical engineering, but soon left and became a filing clerk.

Aged 18, Briers was called up for two years&#x27; national service in the RAF, during which he was a filing clerk at RAF Northwood, where he met future &quot;George and Mildred&quot; actor Brian Murphy. Murphy introduced Briers, who had been interested in acting since the age of 14, to the Dramatic Society at the Borough Polytechnic Institute, now London South Bank University, where he performed in several productions.

When he left the RAF, Briers studied at RADA, which he attended from 1954 to 1956. Placed in a class with both Peter O&#x27;Toole and Albert Finney, Briers later credited academy director John Fernald with nurturing his talent. Graduating from RADA with a silver medal, he won a scholarship with the Liverpool Repertory Company, and after 15 months moved to the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry for 6 months. He made his West End debut in the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre 1959 production of &quot;Gilt And Gingerbread&quot; by Lionel Hale.

==Television career==

In 1961, Briers was cast in the leading role in &quot;Marriage Lines&quot; (1961–66), with Prunella Scales playing the role of his wife. For &quot;Marriage Lines&quot;, &quot;Simon and Laura&quot;, &quot;Points of View&quot;, &quot;Present Laughter&quot; - &quot;Excerpt&quot;, &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot; and &quot;To You at Home Today&quot;, Briers was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor in 1966. In between the pilot and the series itself, Briers appeared in &quot;Brothers in Law&quot; (from the book by Henry Cecil) as callow barrister Roger Thursby in 1962. He was cast in this role by adaptors Frank Muir and Denis Norden, who had seen him in the West End.

His other early appearances included &quot;The Seven Faces of Jim&quot; (1961) with Jimmy Edwards, &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot; (1962), a production of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Hay Fever&quot; (1968) and the storyteller in several episodes of &quot;Jackanory&quot; (1969). In 1970, he starred in the Ben Travers farce &quot;Rookery Nook&quot;, shown on the BBC. In the 1980s he played several Shakespearean roles, including &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;.

Briers was a subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on two occasions, in May 1972 and in March 1994.

In a role specifically written for him by John Esmonde and Bob Larbey, Briers was cast in the lead role in &quot;The Good Life&quot; (1975–78), playing Tom Good, a draughtsman who decides, on his 40th birthday, to give up his job and try his hand at self-sufficiency, with the support of his wife Barbara, played by Felicity Kendal. Briers persuaded the producers to cast his friend Paul Eddington, a fellow council member of Equity, in the role of Jerry. An enormously successful series, the last episode in 1978 was performed in front of Queen Elizabeth II. In 1977, he starred with his &quot;The Good Life&quot; co-star Penelope Keith in the televised version of Alan Ayckbourn&#x27;s trilogy &quot;The Norman Conquests&quot;. He also starred as Ralph in 13 episodes of &quot;The Other One&quot; (1977–79) with Michael Gambon. In 1977, for &quot;The Good Life&quot; and &quot;One-Upmanship&quot;, he was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Light Entertainment Performance.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Briers had leading roles in several television shows, including &quot;Goodbye, Mr Kent&quot; (1982), a rare failure also featuring Hannah Gordon; the lead role of Martin Bryce in &quot;Ever Decreasing Circles&quot; (1984–89); and as Godfrey Spry in the BBC comedy drama &quot;If You See God, Tell Him&quot; (1993). He also starred in &quot;All in Good Faith&quot; (1985), &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; as Albert Dobson (in episode 9/4 &quot;The Verger&quot; – 1988), and the first episode of &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; (1990) as Mr. Sprout. In 1987, he appeared as the principal villain in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Paradise Towers&quot;, a performance which was described by &quot;Radio Times&quot; writer Patrick Mulkern as Briers&#x27;s &quot;career low&quot;. In 1995, he played the character Tony Fairfax in the BBC comedy &quot;Down to Earth&quot;. In the &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; episode &quot;Death is Now My Neighbour&quot;, he played the evil master of Lonsdale College, Sir Clixby Bream.

During the 2000s, Briers was the curmudgeonly and extravagant father Hector MacDonald in the BBC television programme &quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot; (2000–05), appearing in series 1, 2, 3 and 7. Also in the 2000s, specifically 2006, he appeared in an episode of New Tricks entitled Old Dogs playing a character called James Farlow.

==Stage work==
Briers spent much of his career in the theatre, including appearances in plays by Shakespeare and George Bernard Shaw. In 1967, one of his earliest successes was playing alongside Michael Hordern and Celia Johnson in the London production of Alan Ayckbourn&#x27;s &quot;Relatively Speaking&quot;.

After a long career in television sitcom, and looking to expand his career, his daughter Lucy took him to Stratford-upon-Avon to watch Kenneth Branagh in &quot;Henry V&quot;. After meeting Branagh backstage after the performance, Branagh offered Briers the role of Malvolio in the Renaissance Theatre Company production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. Briers joined the company, and went on to play title parts in &quot;King Lear&quot; and &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;. Briers also appeared in many of Branagh&#x27;s films, including &quot;Henry V&quot; (1989, as Bardolph), &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (1993, as Signor Leonato) and &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1996, as Polonius). The theatre production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; (1988) was adapted for television, with Briers reprising his role as Malvolio.

In 1990, Briers appeared in &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; at the National Theatre, which earnt him a nomination for the following year&#x27;s Laurence Olivier Award for Best Comedy Performance.

In 2010, Briers played in the Royal National Theatre revival of Dion Boucicault&#x27;s &quot;London Assurance&quot;, alongside Simon Russell Beale and Fiona Shaw. A performance of this was broadcast live to cinemas round the world as part of the &quot;NT Live!&quot; programme. He also played the character of Captain Bluntschli, in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s play &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;.

==Film==
Briers made his film début in the British feature film &quot;Bottoms Up&quot; (1960). He then took parts in &quot;Murder She Said&quot; (1961), &quot;The Girl on the Boat&quot; (1962), &quot;A Matter of WHO&quot; (1962), &quot;The V.I.P.s&quot; (1963); and Raquel Welch&#x27;s spy spoof &quot;Fathom&quot; (1967).

He later appeared in Michael Winner&#x27;s &quot;A Chorus of Disapproval&quot; (1988) and the film &quot;Unconditional Love&quot; (2002), as well as the Kenneth Branagh adaptation of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (1993), in which he played the role of Leonato. In 1997 he played the Archbishop of Canterbury, a minor role in the film &quot;Spice World&quot;. His last film was &quot;Cockneys vs Zombies&quot; (2012).

==Radio and voice work==
He was a familiar voice actor. Briers narrated the animated children&#x27;s TV programme &quot;Roobarb&quot; (1974). Originally shown on BBC1 just before the evening news, each five-minute cartoon was written by Grange Calveley and produced by Bob Godfrey. He was the original narrator and voice actor for all the characters in the &quot;Noddy&quot; (1975) TV series based on the Enid Blyton character, and then another series with Godfrey, &quot;Noah and Nelly in... SkylArk&quot; (1976). He also provided the voice of Fiver in the animated film adaptation of &quot;Watership Down&quot; (1978). In 1990 Briers provided the narration and voiced all the characters in the five-minute animated series &quot;Coconuts&quot; about a monkey, a king lion and a parrot who lived on a tropical island. The series ran for ten episodes and first aired on ITV on 23 April 1990. In the 1990s, he voiced the part of Mouse, opposite Alan Bennett&#x27;s Mole in the TV series &quot;Mouse and Mole&quot;, based on books by Joyce Dunbar and James Mayhew. He latterly starred alongside Neil Morrissey in &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; (2005) as Bob&#x27;s Dad, Robert to his credit. As well as performing all 12 of Fiona Waters&#x27; stories on the 1995 &quot;Stories For Bedtime&quot; book for audio cassette, he recorded all 4 of the seasonal &quot;Percy the Park Keeper&quot; stories for a grand CD release based on the books by Nick Butterworth, creating memorable voices for all of the animal characters as well as Percy the Park Keeper himself. Briers also featured in the television series adaptation of &quot;Watership Down&quot; (1999–2001), this time voicing a series exclusive character called Captain Broom, and was one of the very few actors who stayed for all three series.

His work in radio included playing Dr. Simon Sparrow in BBC Radio 4&#x27;s adaptions of Richard Gordon&#x27;s &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; and &quot;Doctor at Large&quot; (1968), and a retired thespian in a series of six plays with Stanley Baxter &quot;Two Pipe Problems&quot; (2008), and later the play &quot;Not Talking&quot;, commissioned for BBC Radio 3 by Mike Bartlett. In 1986 he narrated Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Oh, yes it is!&quot;, a history of pantomime written by Gerald Frow. Between 1973 and 1981, Briers played Bertie Wooster in the radio series &quot;What Ho! Jeeves&quot; with Michael Hordern as Jeeves.

Briers narrated numerous commercials, including adverts for the Midland Bank in which he was the voice of the company&#x27;s Griffin symbol. Between 1984 and 1986 he made a series of commercials for the Ford Sierra done in a sitcom style portraying the Sierra as &quot;one of the family&quot;. Briers narrated the public information film &quot;Frances the Firefly&quot;, about the dangers of playing with matches, firstly in the mid 1990s when first made, and then in the early 2000s when re-made by the Government fire safety campaign Fire Kills. He also recorded the voice of a satnav specifically designed for senior citizens in BBC 2&#x27;s TV Show &quot;Top Gear&quot;, Series 19, episode 5, which aired only a week after his death. Presenter Jeremy Clarkson paid a brief tribute to his memory at the end of the episode.

==Later career==
After 1990, he appeared in &quot;Lovejoy&quot;, &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;, &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; &quot;Death&#x27;s Shadow&quot; as Stephen Wentworth in 1999, &quot;Doctors&quot;, &quot;New Tricks&quot;, &quot;Kingdom&quot;, and &quot;If You See God, Tell Him&quot;. Richard Briers starred as Hector in the first three series of &quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot; from 2000 to 2002 (and as a guest in series 7 in 2005), a role which saw him return to the limelight. He contributed &quot;Sonnet 55&quot; to the 2002 compilation album, &quot;When Love Speaks&quot;, which features famous actors and musicians interpreting Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets and play excerpts. In 2005, he appeared alongside Kevin Whately in &quot;Dad&quot;, a TV Film made by BBC Wales exploring issues of elder abuse. In 2006, he made an appearance in an episode of &quot;Extras&quot;, and portrayed the servant Adam in Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s 2006 Shakespeare adaptation, &quot;As You Like It&quot;. He made a cameo appearance as a dying recluse in the 2008 &quot;Torchwood&quot; episode &quot;A Day in the Death&quot;. In 2009 he appeared in Agatha Christie&#x27;s Marple &quot;Why didn&#x27;t they ask Evans?&quot; as Wilson.

On 17 December 2000, Briers was the guest on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. Among his musical choices were &quot;Di quella pira&quot; from &quot;Il trovatore&quot; by Giuseppe Verdi, &quot;I Feel A Song Coming On&quot; by Al Jolson and &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street&quot; by Louis Armstrong. His favourite piece was the Organ Concerto in F major &quot;The Cuckoo and the Nightingale&quot; by George Frideric Handel.

==Personal life==
Briers met Ann Davies while both were at Liverpool Rep. Davies was employed as a stage manager, and had acted on television and in films from the mid-1950s. Soon after meeting, he borrowed £5 from his mother, bought an engagement ring and they were married within six months. They had two daughters, one of whom, Lucy, is also an actress; Kate (or Katie) has worked in stage management, and is a primary school teacher.

Briers and his friend Paul Eddington shared a similar sense of humour, and knew each other before being cast in &quot;The Good Life&quot;. After Eddington was diagnosed with skin cancer, Briers accepted a role opposite him in David Storey&#x27;s play &quot;Home&quot; in 1994, agreeing to take on all of the publicity interviews to allow Eddington time for his treatment. At Eddington&#x27;s memorial service, Briers read both from &quot;Cymbeline&quot; and Wodehouse; he later read chapters from Eddington&#x27;s autobiography on BBC Radio 4.

In 2014, BBC Radio 4 broadcast &quot;Memories of a Cad&quot;, an affectionate comedy drama by Roy Smiles about the relationship between Terry-Thomas and Briers, played by Martin Jarvis and Alistair McGowan respectively. Set in 1984 when he had suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease for many years, Terry-Thomas is delighted by the visit to his home in Ibiza of the much younger Briers, whom he recognises from television, and who proves to be his first cousin once removed. Briers cheers him up by recalling the career the film-star has long forgotten. It was re-broadcast in 2016.

As a result of Terry-Thomas&#x27;s Parkinson&#x27;s, Briers became President of Parkinson&#x27;s UK. He also helped to launch a Sense, The National Deafblind and Rubella Association campaign. Briers was also a non-medical patron of the TOFS (Tracheo-Oesophageal Fistula Support) charity, which supports children and the families of children born unable to swallow.

Interviewed by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2008, Briers admitted that, while on holiday, he enjoyed being recognised, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m gregarious by nature, so I love chatting to people. It really cheers me up.&quot;

Briers was a keen visitor of Britain&#x27;s historic churches, and visited over one hundred for his book &quot;English Country Churches&quot;, which was published in 1988. From his national service in the RAF, he was a supporter for a national memorial for RAF Bomber Command.

Briers was appointed OBE in 1989, and CBE in 2003.

==Declining health and death==
According to his daughter Lucy, he quit smoking in 2001 immediately after a routine chest X-ray suggested he would otherwise soon be in a wheelchair. He was diagnosed with emphysema in 2007.

Briers died at his home in Bedford Park, London, on 17 February 2013 of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His funeral was held at the local church of St Michael and All Angels in Chiswick on 6 March 2013.

==Tributes==
The BBC referred to Richard Briers as &quot;one of Britain&#x27;s best-loved actors&quot;. Sir Kenneth Branagh paid tribute to him, saying, &quot;He was a national treasure, a great actor and a wonderful man. He was greatly loved and he is deeply missed.&quot;

Briers&#x27;s agent, Christopher Farrar, said: &quot;Richard was a wonderful man, a consummate professional and an absolute joy to work alongside. Following his recent discussion of his battle with emphysema, I know he was incredibly touched by the strength of support expressed by friends and the public.&quot;

Fellow television star Penelope Keith said, &quot;He was always courteous, always generous and always self-deprecating&quot; adding, &quot;He was also such a clever actor that he made you feel secure. You believed he was who he was portraying on the screen or on the stage... I just think of Richard and smile.&quot;

Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, critic Michael Coveney described Briers as &quot;always the most modest and self-deprecating of actors, and the sweetest of men,&quot; and noted: &quot;Although he excelled in the plays of Alan Ayckbourn, and became a national figure in his television sitcoms of the 1970s and 80s, notably &quot;The Good Life&quot;, he could mine hidden depths on stage, giving notable performances in Ibsen, Chekhov and, for Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s Renaissance company, Shakespeare.&quot;

On 30 March 2013, BBC Two broadcast a one-hour long review of Briers&#x27;s life and career, with tributes from many friends and colleagues.

===&quot;Ever Increasing Wonder&quot;===
On Christmas Day 2013, BBC Radio 4 Extra broadcast a day of tribute to Briers titled &quot;Ever Increasing Wonder&quot;, with a variety of his BBC Radio recordings, many of them introduced by those who knew him and worked with him. Guest speakers included: Prunella Scales, Stephen Fry, Michael Chaplin, Alan Bennett, Michael Ball, Kenneth Branagh, Ed Harris as well as Briers&#x27;s widow Ann Davies and their daughters.

<text>The Battle of Sant Llorenç de la Muga (in Catalan, in ) was fought on 13 August 1794 between an attacking Spanish–Portuguese army led by the Conde de la Unión and a French army commanded by Jacques François Dugommier. The local French defenders headed by Pierre Augereau and Dominique Pérignon repulsed the allies. The Spanish garrison of Fort de Bellegarde surrendered a month later.

==Background==
In 1793 the Spanish army defeated the ill-trained French armies where the Franco-Spanish border touches the Mediterranean Sea. The Siege of Bellegarde resulted in the surrender of the fort to the Spanish army on 24 June. The Spanish army won the Battle of Truillas and several other actions, and seized the port of Collioure in December. In January 1794, the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees received a new commander in General of Division Jacques François Dugommier. Fresh from his triumph at the Siege of Toulon, the new leader reorganized the army. Dugommier set up supply depots, established hospitals, and improved local roads. By the time the French assumed the offensive in April 1794, their army numbered 28,000 regular soldiers, 20,000 garrison troops, and 9,000 hastily trained volunteers.

Dugommier organized the infantry divisions of Generals of Division Pérignon, Augereau, and Sauret, backed by a cavalry reserve under MG André de La Barre. The French defeated their adversaries at the Battle of Boulou on 1 May. Immediately after their victory, they pushed the Allied army south of the Pyrenees and invested both Collioure and the Fort de Bellegarde. Collioure fell on 29 May, but Bellegarde proved to be much more difficult to capture. In a combat at La Junquera on 7 June, Pérignon repulsed a Spanish attempt to relieve Bellegarde, though La Barre was killed while leading his troopers.

==Battle==
Anxious about the beleaguered garrison of Bellegarde, de la Unión assembled an army of 45,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry. He emerged from his fortified lines covering the Alto Ampurdán to attack Augereau&#x27;s division on the western flank. The fighting took place near Sant Llorenç de la Muga, the site of a cannon ammunition foundry. The Spanish assault, carried out by 14,000 regular infantry and 6,000 provincial militia, failed to break the French defenders, who received some help from Pérignon&#x27;s division in the center. Sauret&#x27;s defenses, on the eastern flank, were not threatened.

General John Forbes covered the retreat with a Portuguese division consisting of one battalion each of the 1st, 2nd, &quot;Olivença&quot;, &quot;Cascais&quot;, &quot;Peniche&quot;, and &quot;Freire de Andrade&quot; Infantry Regiments. The French counted 800 casualties, including General of Brigade Guillaume Mirabel killed. The Spanish suffered losses of 1,400 soldiers killed, wounded, and missing.

==Aftermath==
The Marquis of Val-Santaro surrendered Bellegarde to Pérignon on 17 September. The 1,000 starving survivors of the garrison became prisoners, while 68 cannon and 40,000 rounds of cannon shot fell into French hands. French losses during the blockade were light. The next action was the Battle of the Black Mountain in November 1794.

<text>A hybrid vehicle is one that uses two or more distinct types of power, such as submarines that use diesel when surfaced and batteries when submerged. Other means to store energy include pressurized fluid in hydraulic hybrids.

Hybrid powertrains are designed to switch from one power source to another to maximize both fuel efficiency and energy efficiency. In hybrid electric vehicles, for instance, the electric motor is more efficient at producing torque, or turning power, while the combustion engine is better for maintaining high speed. Improved efficiency, lower emissions, and reduced running costs relative to non-hybrid vehicles are three primary benefits of hybridization. 
==Vehicle types ==

===Two-wheeled and cycle-type vehicles===
Mopeds, electric bicycles, and even electric kick scooters are a simple form of a hybrid, powered by an internal combustion engine or electric motor and the rider&#x27;s muscles. Early prototype motorcycles in the late 19th century used the same principle.

* In a parallel hybrid bicycle human and motor torques are mechanically coupled at the pedal or one of the wheels, e.g. using a hub motor, a roller pressing onto a tire, or a connection to a wheel using a transmission element. Most motorized bicycles, mopeds are of this type.
* In a series hybrid bicycle (SHB) (a kind of chainless bicycle) the user pedals a generator, charging a battery or feeding the motor, which delivers all of the torque required. They are commercially available, being simple in theory and manufacturing.

The first published prototype of an SHB is by Augustus Kinzel (US Patent 3&#x27;884&#x27;317) in 1975. In 1994 Bernie Macdonalds conceived the Electrilite SHB with power electronics allowing regenerative braking and pedaling while stationary. In 1995 Thomas Muller designed and built a &quot;Fahrrad mit elektromagnetischem Antrieb&quot; for his 1995 diploma thesis. In 1996 Jürg Blatter and Andreas Fuchs of Berne University of Applied Sciences built an SHB and in 1998 modified a Leitra tricycle (European patent EP 1165188). Until 2005 they built several prototype SH tricycles and quadricycles. In 1999 Harald Kutzke described an &quot;active bicycle&quot;: the aim is to approach the ideal bicycle weighing nothing and having no drag by electronic compensation.

* A series hybrid electric–petroleum bicycle (SHEPB) is powered by pedals, batteries, a petrol generator, or plug-in charger—providing flexibility and range enhancements over electric-only bicycles.

A SHEPB prototype made by David Kitson in Australia in 2014 used a lightweight brushless DC electric motor from an aerial drone and small hand-tool sized internal combustion engine, and a 3D printed drive system and lightweight housing, altogether weighing less than 4.5 kg. Active cooling keeps plastic parts from softening. The prototype uses a regular electric bicycle charge port.

===Heavy vehicle===
Hybrid power trains use diesel–electric or turbo-electric to power railway locomotives, buses, heavy goods vehicles, mobile hydraulic machinery, and ships. A diesel/turbine engine drives an electric generator or hydraulic pump, which powers electric/hydraulic motors—strictly an electric/hydraulic transmission (not a hybrid), unless it can accept power from outside. With large vehicles, conversion losses decrease and the advantages in distributing power through wires or pipes rather than mechanical elements become more prominent, especially when powering multiple drives—e.g. driven wheels or propellers. Until recently most heavy vehicles had little secondary energy storage, e.g. batteries/hydraulic accumulators—excepting non-nuclear submarines, one of the oldest production hybrids, running on diesel while surfaced and batteries when submerged. Both series and parallel setups were used in World War II-era submarines.

====Rail transport====
Europe
The new Autorail à grande capacité (AGC or high-capacity railcar) built by the Canadian company Bombardier for service in France is diesel/electric motors, using 1500 or 25,000 V on different rail systems. It was tested in Rotterdam, the Netherlands with Railfeeding, a Genesee &amp; Wyoming company.

China
The First Hybrid Evaluating locomotive was designed by rail research center Matrai in 1999 and built in 2000. It was an EMD G12 locomotive upgraded with batteries, a 200 kW diesel generator, and four AC motors.

Japan
Japan&#x27;s first hybrid train with significant energy storage is the KiHa E200, with roof-mounted lithium-ion batteries.

India
Indian railway launched one of its kind CNG-Diesel hybrid trains in January 2015. The train has a 1400 hp engine which uses fumigation technology. The first of these trains is set to run on the 81 km long Rewari-Rohtak route. CNG is less-polluting alternative for diesel and petrol and is popular as an alternative fuel in India. Already many transport vehicles such as auto-rickshaws and buses run on CNG fuel.

North America
In the US, General Electric made a locomotive with sodium–nickel chloride (Na-NiCl2) battery storage. They expect ≥10% fuel economy.

Variant diesel electric locomotive include the Green Goat (GG) and Green Kid (GK) switching/yard engines built by Canada&#x27;s Railpower Technologies, with lead acid (Pba) batteries and 1000 to 2000 hp electric motors, and a new clean-burning ≈160 hp diesel generator. No fuel is wasted for idling: ≈60–85% of the time for these types of locomotives. It is unclear if regenerative braking is used; but in principle, it is easily utilized.

Since these engines typically need extra weight for traction purposes anyway the battery pack&#x27;s weight is a negligible penalty. The diesel generator and batteries are normally built on an existing &quot;retired&quot; &quot;yard&quot; locomotive&#x27;s frame. The existing motors and running gear are all rebuilt and reused. Fuel savings of 40–60% and up to 80% pollution reductions are claimed over a &quot;typical&quot; older switching/yard engine. The advantages hybrid cars have for frequent starts and stops and idle periods apply to typical switching yard use. &quot;Green Goat&quot; locomotives have been purchased by Canadian Pacific, BNSF, Kansas City Southern Railway and Union Pacific among others.

====Cranes====
Railpower Technologies engineers working with TSI Terminal Systems are testing a hybrid diesel–electric power unit with battery storage for use in Rubber Tyred Gantry (RTG) cranes. RTG cranes are typically used for loading and unloading shipping containers onto trains or trucks in ports and container storage yards. The energy used to lift the containers can be partially regained when they are lowered. Diesel fuel and emission reductions of 50–70% are predicted by Railpower engineers. First systems are expected to be operational in 2007.

====Road transport, commercial vehicles====

Hybrid systems are regularly in use for trucks, buses and other heavy highway vehicles. Small fleet sizes and installation costs are compensated by fuel savings, with advances such as higher capacity, lowered battery cost, etc. Toyota, Ford, GM and others are introducing hybrid pickups and SUVs. Kenworth Truck Company recently introduced the Kenworth T270 Class 6 that for city usage seems to be competitive. FedEx and others are investing in hybrid delivery vehicles—particularly for city use where hybrid technology may pay off first. FedEx is trialling two delivery trucks with Wrightspeed electric motors and diesel generators; the retrofit kits are claimed to pay for themselves in a few years. The diesel engines run at a constant RPM for peak efficiency.

In 1978 students at Minneapolis, Minnesota&#x27;s Hennepin Vocational Technical Center, converted a Volkswagen Beetle to a petro-hydraulic hybrid with off-the shelf components. A car rated at 32 mpg was returning 75 mpg with the 60 hp engine replaced by a 16 hp engine, and reached 70 mph.

In the 1990s, engineers at EPA&#x27;s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory developed a petro-hydraulic powertrain for a typical American sedan car. The test car achieved over 80 mpg on combined EPA city/highway driving cycles. Acceleration was 0-60 mph in 8 seconds, using a 1.9-liter diesel engine. No lightweight materials were used. The EPA estimated that produced in high volumes the hydraulic components would add only $700 to the cost. Under EPA testing, a hydraulic hybrid Ford Expedition returned 32 mpg (7.4 L/100 km) City, and 22 mpg (11 L/100 km) highway. UPS currently has two trucks in service using this technology.

====Military off-road vehicles====
Since 1985, the US military has been testing serial hybrid Humvees and have found them to deliver faster acceleration, a stealth mode with low thermal signature, near silent operation, and greater fuel economy.

====Ships====
Ships with both mast-mounted sails and steam engines were an early form of a hybrid vehicle. Another example is the diesel–electric submarine. This runs on batteries when submerged and the batteries can be recharged by the diesel engine when the craft is on the surface.

, there are 550 ships with an average of 1.6 MWh of batteries. The average was 500 kWh in 2016.

Newer hybrid ship-propulsion schemes include large towing kites manufactured by companies such as SkySails. Towing kites can fly at heights several times higher than the tallest ship masts, capturing stronger and steadier winds.

====Aircraft====
The Boeing Fuel Cell Demonstrator Airplane has a Proton-Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell/lithium-ion battery hybrid system to power an electric motor, which is coupled to a conventional propeller. The fuel cell provides all power for the cruise phase of flight. During takeoff and climb, the flight segment that requires the most power, the system draws on lightweight lithium-ion batteries.

The demonstrator aircraft is a Dimona motor glider, built by Diamond Aircraft Industries of Austria, which also carried out structural modifications to the aircraft. With a wingspan of , the airplane will be able to cruise at about on power from the fuel cell.

Hybrid FanWings have been designed. A FanWing is created by two engines with the capability to autorotate and landing like a helicopter.

==Engine type==

===Hybrid electric-petroleum vehicles===


When the term &quot;hybrid vehicle&quot; is used, it most often refers to a Hybrid electric vehicle. These encompass such vehicles as the Saturn Vue, Toyota Prius, Toyota Yaris, Toyota Camry Hybrid, Ford Escape Hybrid, Ford Fusion Hybrid, Toyota Highlander Hybrid, Honda Insight, Honda Civic Hybrid, Lexus RX 400h, and 450h, Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid, Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, Hyundai Elantra Hybrid, Kia Sportage Hybrid, Kia Niro Hybrid, Kia Sorento Hybrid and others. A petroleum-electric hybrid most commonly uses internal combustion engines (using a variety of fuels, generally gasoline or Diesel engines) and electric motors to power the vehicle. The energy is stored in the fuel of the internal combustion engine and an electric battery set. There are many types of petroleum-electric hybrid drivetrains, from Full hybrid to Mild hybrid, which offer varying advantages and disadvantages.

William H. Patton filed a patent application for a gasoline-electric hybrid rail-car propulsion system in early 1889, and for a similar hybrid boat propulsion system in mid 1889. There is no evidence that his hybrid boat met with any success, but he built a prototype hybrid tram and sold a small hybrid locomotive.

In 1899, Henri Pieper developed the world&#x27;s first petro-electric hybrid automobile. In 1900, Ferdinand Porsche developed a series-hybrid using two motor-in-wheel-hub arrangements with an internal combustion generator set providing the electric power; Porsche&#x27;s hybrid set two-speed records.
While liquid fuel/electric hybrids date back to the late 19th century, the braking regenerative hybrid was invented by David Arthurs, an electrical engineer from Springdale, Arkansas, in 1978–79. His home-converted Opel GT was reported to return as much as 75 mpg with plans still sold to this original design, and the &quot;Mother Earth News&quot; modified version on their website.

The plug-in-electric-vehicle (PEV) is becoming more and more common. It has the range needed in locations where there are wide gaps with no services. The batteries can be plugged into house (mains) electricity for charging, as well being charged while the engine is running.

===Continuously outboard recharged electric vehicle===
Some battery electric vehicles can be recharged while the user drives. Such a vehicle establishes contact with an electrified rail, plate, or overhead wires on the highway via an attached conducting wheel or other similar mechanisms (see conduit current collection). The vehicle&#x27;s batteries are recharged by this process—on the highway—and can then be used normally on other roads until the battery is discharged. For example, some of the battery-electric locomotives used for maintenance trains on the London Underground are capable of this mode of operation.

Developing an infrastructure for battery electric vehicles would provide the advantage of virtually unrestricted highway range. Since many destinations are within 100 km of a major highway, this technology could reduce the need for expensive battery systems. However, private use of the existing electrical system is almost universally prohibited. Besides, the technology for such electrical infrastructure is largely outdated and, outside some cities, not widely distributed (see Conduit current collection, trams, electric rail, trolleys, third rail). Updating the required electrical and infrastructure costs could perhaps be funded by toll revenue or by dedicated transportation taxes.

===Hybrid fuel (dual mode)===

In addition to vehicles that use two or more different devices for propulsion, some also consider vehicles that use distinct energy sources or input types (&quot;fuels&quot;) using the same engine to be hybrids, although to avoid confusion with hybrids as described above and to use correctly the terms, these are perhaps more correctly described as dual mode vehicles:
* Some trolleybuses can switch between an onboard diesel engine and overhead electrical power depending on conditions (see dual-mode bus). In principle, this could be combined with a battery subsystem to create a true plug-in hybrid trolleybus, although , no such design seems to have been announced.
* Flexible-fuel vehicles can use a mixture of input fuels mixed in one tank—typically gasoline and ethanol, methanol, or biobutanol.
* Bi-fuel vehicle: Liquified petroleum gas and natural gas are very different from petroleum or diesel and cannot be used in the same tanks, so it would be challenging to build an (LPG or NG) flexible fuel system. Instead vehicles are built with two, parallel, fuel systems feeding one engine. For example, some Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HDs can effortlessly switch between petroleum and natural gas, offering a range of over 1000 km (650 miles). While the duplicated tanks cost space in some applications, the increased range, decreased cost of fuel, and flexibility where LPG or CNG infrastructure is incomplete may be a significant incentive to purchase. While the US Natural gas infrastructure is partially incomplete, it is increasing and in 2013 had 2600 CNG stations in place. Rising gas prices may push consumers to purchase these vehicles. In 2013 when gas prices traded around US, the price of gasoline was US, compared to natural gas&#x27;s . On a per unit of energy comparative basis, this makes natural gas much cheaper than gasoline.
* Some vehicles have been modified to use another fuel source if it is available, such as cars modified to run on autogas (LPG) and diesels modified to run on waste vegetable oil that has not been processed into biodiesel.
* Power-assist mechanisms for bicycles and other human-powered vehicles are also included (see Motorized bicycle).

===Fluid power hybrid===


Hydraulic hybrid and pneumatic hybrid vehicles use an engine or regenerative braking (or both) to charge a pressure accumulator to drive the wheels via hydraulic (liquid) or pneumatic (compressed gas) drive units. In most cases the engine is detached from the drivetrain, serving solely to charge the energy accumulator. The transmission is seamless. Regenerative braking can be used to recover some of the supplied drive energy back into the accumulator.

====Petro-air hybrid====
A French company, MDI, has designed and has running models of a petro-air hybrid engine car. The system does not use air motors to drive the vehicle, being directly driven by a hybrid engine. The engine uses a mixture of compressed air and gasoline injected into the cylinders. A key aspect of the hybrid engine is the &quot;active chamber&quot;, which is a compartment heating air via fuel doubling the energy output. Tata Motors of India assessed the design phase towards full production for the Indian market and moved into &quot;completing detailed development of the compressed air engine into specific vehicle and stationary applications&quot;.

====Petro-hydraulic hybrid====

Petro-hydraulic configurations have been common in trains and heavy vehicles for decades. The auto industry recently focused on this hybrid configuration as it now shows promise for introduction into smaller vehicles.

In petro-hydraulic hybrids, the energy recovery rate is high and therefore the system is more efficient than electric battery charged hybrids using the current electric battery technology, demonstrating a 60% to 70% increase in energy economy in US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) testing. The charging engine needs only to be sized for average usage with acceleration bursts using the stored energy in the hydraulic accumulator, which is charged when in low energy demanding vehicle operation. The charging engine runs at optimum speed and load for efficiency and longevity. Under tests undertaken by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a hydraulic hybrid Ford Expedition returned City, and highway. UPS currently has two trucks in service using this technology.

Although petro-hydraulic hybrid technology has been known for decades and used in trains as well as very large construction vehicles, the high costs of the equipment precluded the systems from lighter trucks and cars. In the modern sense, an experiment proved the viability of small petro-hydraulic hybrid road vehicles in 1978. A group of students at Minneapolis, Minnesota&#x27;s Hennepin Vocational Technical Center, converted a Volkswagen Beetle car to run as a petro-hydraulic hybrid using off-the-shelf components. A car rated at was returning with the 60 hp engine replaced by a 16 hp engine. The experimental car reached .

In the 1990s, a team of engineers working at EPA&#x27;s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory succeeded in developing a revolutionary type of petro-hydraulic hybrid powertrain that would propel a typical American sedan car. The test car achieved over 80 mpg on combined EPA city/highway driving cycles. Acceleration was 0-60 mph in 8 seconds, using a 1.9 L diesel engine. No lightweight materials were used. The EPA estimated that produced in high volumes the hydraulic components would add only $700 to the base cost of the vehicle.

The petro-hydraulic hybrid system has a faster and more efficient charge/discharge cycling than petro-electric hybrids and is also cheaper to build. The accumulator vessel size dictates total energy storage capacity and may require more space than an electric battery set. Any vehicle space consumed by a larger size of accumulator vessel may be offset by the need for a smaller sized charging engine, in HP and physical size.

Research is underway in large corporations and small companies. The focus has now switched to smaller vehicles. The system components were expensive which precluded installation in smaller trucks and cars. A drawback was that the power driving motors were not efficient enough at part load. A British company (Artemis Intelligent Power) made a breakthrough introducing an electronically controlled hydraulic motor/pump, the Digital Displacement® motor/pump. The pump is highly efficient at all speed ranges and loads, giving feasibility to small applications of petro-hydraulic hybrids. The company converted a BMW car as a test bed to prove viability. The BMW 530i gave double the mpg in city driving compared to the standard car. This test was using the standard 3,000 cc engine, with a smaller engine the figures would have been more impressive. The design of petro-hydraulic hybrids using well sized accumulators allows downsizing an engine to average power usage, not peak power usage. Peak power is provided by the energy stored in the accumulator. A smaller more efficient constant speed engine reduces weight and liberates space for a larger accumulator.

Current vehicle bodies are designed around the mechanicals of existing engine/transmission setups. It is restrictive and far from ideal to install petro-hydraulic mechanicals into existing bodies not designed for hydraulic setups. One research project&#x27;s goal is to create a blank paper design new car, to maximize the packaging of petro-hydraulic hybrid components in the vehicle. All bulky hydraulic components are integrated into the chassis of the car. One design has claimed to return 130 mpg in tests by using a large hydraulic accumulator which is also the structural chassis of the car. The small hydraulic driving motors are incorporated within the wheel hubs driving the wheels and reversing to claw-back kinetic braking energy. The hub motors eliminate the need for friction brakes, mechanical transmissions, driveshafts, and U-joints, reducing costs and weight. Hydrostatic drive with no friction brakes is used in industrial vehicles. The aim is 170 mpg in average driving conditions. The energy created by shock absorbers and kinetic braking energy that normally would be wasted assists in charging the accumulator. A small fossil-fuelled piston engine sized for average power use charges the accumulator. The accumulator is sized at running the car for 15 minutes when fully charged. The aim is a fully charged accumulator that will produce a 0-60 mph acceleration speed of under 5 seconds using four wheel drive.

In January 2011 industry giant Chrysler announced a partnership with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to design and develop an experimental petro-hydraulic hybrid powertrain suitable for use in large passenger cars. In 2012 an existing production minivan was adapted to the new hydraulic powertrain for assessment.

PSA Peugeot Citroën exhibited an experimental &quot;Hybrid Air&quot; engine at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show. The vehicle uses nitrogen gas compressed by energy harvested from braking or deceleration to power a hydraulic drive which supplements power from its conventional gasoline engine. The hydraulic and electronic components were supplied by Robert Bosch GmbH. Mileage was estimated to be about on the Euro test cycle if installed in a Citroën C3 type of body. PSA Although the car was ready for production and was proven and feasible delivering the claimed results, Peugeot Citroën were unable to attract a major manufacturer to share the high development costs and are shelving the project until a partnership can be arranged.

===Electric-human power hybrid vehicle===
Another form of a hybrid vehicle are the human-powered electric vehicles. These include such vehicles as the Sinclair C5, Twike, electric bicycles, electric skateboards, and Electric motorcycles and scooters

==Hybrid vehicle power train configurations==
===Parallel hybrid===


In a parallel hybrid vehicle, an electric motor and an internal combustion engine are coupled such that they can power the vehicle either individually or together. Most commonly the internal combustion engine, the electric motor and gearbox are coupled by automatically controlled clutches. For electric driving, the clutch between the internal combustion engine is open while the clutch to the gearbox is engaged. While in combustion mode the engine and motor run at the same speed.

The first mass-production parallel hybrid sold outside Japan was the 1st generation Honda Insight.

The Mercedes-Benz E 300 BlueTEC HYBRID released in 2012 only in European markets is a very rare mass-produced diesel hybrid vehicle powered by a Mercedes-Benz OM651 engine developing paired with a electric motor, positioned between the engine and the gearbox, for a combined output of . The vehicle has a fuel consumption rate of .

===Mild parallel hybrid===
These types use a generally compact electric motor (usually &lt;20 kW) to provide auto-stop/start features and to provide extra power assist during the acceleration, and to generate on the deceleration phase (also known as regenerative braking).

On-road examples include Honda Civic Hybrid, Honda Insight 2nd generation, Honda CR-Z, Honda Accord Hybrid, Mercedes Benz S400 BlueHYBRID, BMW 7 Series hybrids, General Motors BAS Hybrids, Suzuki S-Cross, Suzuki Wagon R and Smart fortwo with micro hybrid drive.

===Power-split or series-parallel hybrid===
In a power-split hybrid electric drive train, there are two motors: a traction electric motor and an internal combustion engine. The power from these two motors can be shared to drive the wheels via a power split device, which is a simple planetary gear set. The ratio can be from 100% for the combustion engine to 100% for the traction electric motor, or anything in between. The combustion engine can act as a generator charging the batteries.

Modern versions such as the Toyota Hybrid Synergy Drive have a second electric motor/generator connected to the planetary gear. In cooperation with the traction motor/generator and the power-split device, this provides a continuously variable transmission.

On the open road, the primary power source is the internal combustion engine. When maximum power is required, for example, to overtake, the traction electric motor is used to assist. This increases the available power for a short period, giving the effect of having a larger engine than actually installed. In most applications, the combustion engine is switched off when the car is slow or stationary thereby reducing curbside emissions.

Passenger car installations include Toyota Prius, Ford Escape and Fusion, as well as Lexus RX400h, RX450h, GS450h, LS600h, and CT200h.

===Series hybrid===

A series- or serial-hybrid vehicle is driven by an electric motor, functioning as an electric vehicle while the battery pack energy supply is sufficient, with an engine tuned for running as a generator when the battery pack is insufficient. There is typically no mechanical connection between the engine and the wheels, and the primary purpose of the range extender is to charge the battery. Series-hybrids have also been referred to as extended range electric vehicle, range-extended electric vehicle, or electric vehicle-extended range (EREV/REEV/EVER).

The BMW i3 with range extender is a production series-hybrid. It operates as an electric vehicle until the battery charge is low, and then activates an engine-powered generator to maintain power, and is also available without the range extender. The Fisker Karma was the first series-hybrid production vehicle.

When describing cars, the battery of a series-hybrid is usually charged by being plugged in—but a series-hybrid may also allow for a battery to only act as a buffer (and for regeneration purposes), and for the electric motor&#x27;s power to be supplied constantly by a supporting engine. Series arrangements have been common in diesel-electric locomotives and ships. Ferdinand Porsche effectively invented this arrangement in speed-record-setting racing cars in the early 20th century, such as the Lohner–Porsche Mixte Hybrid. Porsche named his arrangement &quot;System Mixt&quot; and it was a wheel hub motor design, where each of the two front wheels was powered by a separate motor. This arrangement was sometimes referred to as an &quot;electric transmission&quot;, as the electric generator and driving motor replaced a mechanical transmission. The vehicle could not move unless the internal combustion engine was running.

In 1997 Toyota released the first series-hybrid bus sold in Japan. GM introduced the Chevy Volt series plug-in hybrid in 2010, aiming for an all-electric range of , though this car also has a mechanical connection between the engine and drivetrain. Supercapacitors combined with a lithium-ion battery bank have been used by AFS Trinity in a converted Saturn Vue SUV vehicle. Using supercapacitors they claim up to 150 mpg in a series-hybrid arrangement.

Nissan Note e-power is an example of a series hybrid technology since 2016 in Japan.

===Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle ===


Another subtype of hybrid vehicles is the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. The plug-in hybrid is usually a general fuel-electric (parallel or serial) hybrid with increased energy storage capacity, usually through a lithium-ion battery, which allows the vehicle to drive on all-electric mode a distance that depends on the battery size and its mechanical layout (series or parallel). It may be connected to mains electricity supply at the end of the journey to avoid charging using the on-board internal combustion engine.

This concept is attractive to those seeking to minimize on-road emissions by avoiding—or at least minimizing—the use of ICE during daily driving. As with pure electric vehicles, the total emissions saving, for example in CO2 terms, is dependent upon the energy source of the electricity generating company.

For some users, this type of vehicle may also be financially attractive so long as the electrical energy being used is cheaper than the petrol/diesel that they would have otherwise used. Current tax systems in many European countries use mineral oil taxation as a major income source. This is generally not the case for electricity, which is taxed uniformly for the domestic customer, however that person uses it. Some electricity suppliers also offer price benefits for off-peak night users, which may further increase the attractiveness of the plug-in option for commuters and urban motorists.

===Road safety for cyclists, pedestrians===

A 2009 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report examined hybrid electric vehicle accidents that involved pedestrians and cyclists and compared them to accidents involving internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV). The findings showed that, in certain road situations, HEVs are more dangerous for those on foot or bicycle. For accidents where a vehicle was slowing or stopping, backing up, entering, or leaving a parking space (when the sound difference between HEVs and ICEVs is most pronounced), HEVs were twice as likely to be involved in a pedestrian crash than ICEVs. For crashes involving cyclists or pedestrians, there was a higher incident rate for HEVs than ICEVs when a vehicle was turning a corner. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the types of vehicles when they were driving straight.

Several automakers developed electric vehicle warning sounds designed to alert pedestrians to the presence of electric drive vehicles such as hybrid electric vehicle, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and all-electric vehicles (EVs) travelling at low speeds. Their purpose is to make pedestrians, cyclists, the blind, and others aware of the vehicle&#x27;s presence while operating in all-electric mode.

Vehicles in the market with such safety devices include the Nissan Leaf, Chevrolet Volt, Fisker Karma, Honda FCX Clarity, Nissan Fuga Hybrid/Infiniti M35, Hyundai ix35 FCEV, Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, 2012 Honda Fit EV, the 2012 Toyota Camry Hybrid, 2012 Lexus CT200h, and all the Prius family of cars.

==Environmental issues==

===Fuel consumption and emissions reductions===
The hybrid vehicle typically achieves greater fuel economy and lower emissions than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), resulting in fewer emissions being generated. These savings are primarily achieved by three elements of a typical hybrid design:
# Relying on both the engine and the electric motors for peak power needs, resulting in a smaller engine size more for average usage rather than peak power usage. A smaller engine can have fewer internal losses and lower weight.
# Having significant battery storage capacity to store and reuse recaptured energy, especially in stop-and-go traffic typical of the city driving cycle.
# Recapturing significant amounts of energy during braking that are normally wasted as heat. This regenerative braking reduces vehicle speed by converting some of its kinetic energy into electricity, depending upon the power rating of the motor/generator;
Other techniques that are not necessarily &#x27;hybrid&#x27; features, but that are frequently found on hybrid vehicles include:
# Using Atkinson cycle engines instead of Otto cycle engines for improved fuel economy.
# Shutting down the engine during traffic stops or while coasting or during other idle periods.
# Improving aerodynamics; (part of the reason that SUVs get such bad fuel economy is the drag on the car. A box-shaped car or truck has to exert more force to move through the air causing more stress on the engine making it work harder). Improving the shape and aerodynamics of a car is a good way to help better the fuel economy and also improve vehicle handling at the same time.
# Using low rolling resistance tires (tires were often made to give a quiet, smooth ride, high grip, etc., but efficiency was a lower priority). Tires cause mechanical drag, once again making the engine work harder, consuming more fuel. Hybrid cars may use special tires that are more inflated than regular tires and stiffer or by choice of carcass structure and rubber compound have lower rolling resistance while retaining acceptable grip, and so improving fuel economy whatever the power source.
# Powering the a/c, power steering, and other auxiliary pumps electrically as and when needed; this reduces mechanical losses when compared with driving them continuously with traditional engine belts.

These features make a hybrid vehicle particularly efficient for city traffic where there are frequent stops, coasting, and idling periods. In addition noise emissions are reduced, particularly at idling and low operating speeds, in comparison to conventional engine vehicles. For continuous high-speed highway use, these features are much less useful in reducing emissions.

===Hybrid vehicle emissions===
Hybrid vehicle emissions today are getting close to or even lower than the recommended level set by the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). The recommended levels they suggest for a typical passenger vehicle should be equated to 5.5 metric tons of . The three most popular hybrid vehicles, Honda Civic, Honda Insight and Toyota Prius, set the standards even higher by producing 4.1, 3.5, and 3.5 tons showing a major improvement in carbon dioxide emissions. Hybrid vehicles can reduce air emissions of smog-forming pollutants by up to 90% and cut carbon dioxide emissions in half.

An increase in fossil fuels is needed to build hybrid vehicles versus conventional cars. This increase is more than offset by reduced emissions when running the vehicle.

Hybrid emissions have been understated when comparing certification cycles to real-world driving. In one study using real-world driving data, it was shown they use on average 120 g of per km instead of the 44 g per km in official tests.

Toyota states that three Hybrid vehicles equal one battery electric vehicle in reduction effect from carbon neutrality viewpoint which means reducing emissions to zero throughout the entire life cycle of a product, starting from procurement of raw materials, manufacturing, and transportation to use, recycling, and disposal.

===Environmental impact of hybrid car battery===

Though hybrid cars consume less fuel than conventional cars, there is still an issue regarding the environmental damage of the hybrid car battery. Today, most hybrid car batteries are Lithium-ion, which has higher energy density than nickel–metal hydride batteries and is more environmentally friendly than lead-based batteries which constitute the bulk of petrol car starter batteries today.

There are many types of batteries. Some are far more toxic than others. Lithium-ion is the least toxic of the batteries mentioned above.

The toxicity levels and environmental impact of nickel metal hydride batteries—the type previously used in hybrids—are much lower than batteries like lead acid or nickel cadmium according to one source. Another source claims nickel metal hydride batteries are much more toxic than lead batteries, also that recycling them and disposing of them safely is difficult. In general various soluble and insoluble nickel compounds, such as nickel chloride and nickel oxide, have known carcinogenic effects in chick embryos and rats. The main nickel compound in NiMH batteries is nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH), which is used as the positive electrode. However Nickel Metal Hydride Batteries have fallen out of favour in hybrid vehicles as various lithium-ion chemistries have become more mature to market.

The lithium-ion battery has become a market leader in this segment due to its high energy density, stability, and cost when compared to other technologies. A market leader in this area is Panasonic with their partnership with Tesla

The lithium-ion batteries are appealing because they have the highest energy density of any rechargeable batteries and can produce a voltage more than three times that of nickel–metal hydride battery cell while simultaneously storing large quantities of electricity as well. The batteries also produce higher output (boosting vehicle power), higher efficiency (avoiding wasteful use of electricity), and provides excellent durability, compared with the life of the battery being roughly equivalent to the life of the vehicle. Additionally, the use of lithium-ion batteries reduces the overall weight of the vehicle and also achieves improved fuel economy of 30% better than petro-powered vehicles with a consequent reduction in CO2 emissions helping to prevent global warming.
Lithium-ion batteries are also safer to recycle, with Volkswagen Group pioneering processes to recycle lithium-ion batteries; this is also being chased by various other large companies, such as BMW, Audi, Mercedes-Benz and Tesla. The main goal within many of these companies is to combat disinformation about the nature of lithium batteries, primarily that they are not recyclable, which primarily stem from articles discussing the difficulties of recycling.

===Charging===
There are two different levels of charging in plug-in hybrids. Level one charging is the slower method as it uses a 120 V/15 A single-phase grounded outlet. Level two is a faster method; existing Level 2 equipment offers charging from 208 V or 240 V (at up to 80 A, 19.2 kW). It may require dedicated equipment and a connection installation for home or public units. The optimum charging window for lithium-ion batteries is 3–4.2 V. Recharging with a 120-volt household outlet takes several hours, a 240-volt charger takes 1–4 hours, and a quick charge takes approximately 30 minutes to achieve 80% charge. Three important factors—distance on charge, cost of charging, and time to charge 
In order for hybrids to run on electrical power, the car must perform the action of braking in order to generate some electricity. The electricity then gets discharged most effectively when the car accelerates or climbs up an incline.
In 2014, hybrid electric car batteries can run on solely electricity for 70–130 miles (110–210 km) on a single charge. Hybrid battery capacity currently ranges from 4.4 kWh to 85 kWh on a fully electric car. On a hybrid car, the battery packs currently range from 0.6 kWh to 2.4 kWh representing a large difference in use of electricity in hybrid cars.

===Raw materials increasing costs===

There is an impending increase in the costs of many rare materials used in the manufacture of hybrid cars. For example, the rare-earth element dysprosium is required to fabricate many of the advanced electric motors and battery systems in hybrid propulsion systems. Neodymium is another rare earth metal which is a crucial ingredient in high-strength magnets that are found in permanent magnet electric motors.

Nearly all the rare-earth elements in the world come from China, and many analysts believe that an overall increase in Chinese electronics manufacturing will consume this entire supply by 2012. In addition, export quotas on Chinese rare-earth elements have resulted in an unknown amount of supply.

A few non-Chinese sources such as the advanced Hoidas Lake project in northern Canada as well as Mount Weld in Australia are currently under development; however, the barriers to entry are high and require years to go online.

== How hybrid-electric vehicles work ==
Hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) combine the advantage of gasoline engines and electric motors. The key areas for efficiency or performance gains are regenerative braking, dual power sources, and less idling.
* Regenerative braking. The electric motor normally converts electricity into physical motion. Used in reverse as a generator, it can also convert physical motion into electricity. This both slows the car (braking) and recharges (regenerates) the batteries.
* Dual power. Power can come from either the engine, motor, or both depending on driving circumstances. Additional power to assist the engine in accelerating or climbing might be provided by the electric motor. Or more commonly, a smaller electric motor provides all of the power for low-speed driving conditions and is augmented by the engine at higher speeds.
* Automatic start/shutoff. It automatically shuts off the engine when the vehicle comes to a stop and restarts it when the accelerator is pressed down. This automation is much simpler with an electric motor. Also, see dual power above.

==Alternative green vehicles==

Other types of green vehicles include other vehicles that go fully or partly on alternative energy sources than fossil fuel. Another option is to use alternative fuel composition (i.e. biofuels) in conventional fossil fuel-based vehicles, making them go partly on renewable energy sources.

Other approaches include personal rapid transit, a public transportation concept that offers automated on-demand non-stop transportation, on a network of specially built guideways.

==Marketing==
=== Adoption ===
Automakers spend around $US8 million in marketing Hybrid vehicles each year. With combined effort from many car companies, the Hybrid industry has sold millions of Hybrids.

Hybrid car companies like Toyota, Honda, Ford, and BMW have pulled together to create a movement of Hybrid vehicle sales pushed by Washington lobbyists to lower the world&#x27;s emissions and become less reliant on our petroleum consumption.

In 2005, sales went beyond 200,000 Hybrids, but in retrospect that only reduced the global use for gasoline consumption by 200,000 gallons per day—a tiny fraction of the 360 million gallons used per day. According to Bradley Berman author of &quot;Driving Change—One Hybrid at a time&quot;, &quot;cold economics shows that in real dollars, except for a brief spike in the 1970s, gas prices have remained remarkably steady and cheap. Fuel continues to represent a small part of the overall cost of owning and operating a personal vehicle&quot;. Other marketing tactics include greenwashing which is the &quot;unjustified appropriation of environmental virtue.&quot; 
Temma Ehrenfeld explained in an article by Newsweek. Hybrids may be more efficient than many other gasoline motors as far as gasoline consumption is concerned but as far as being green and good for the environment is completely inaccurate.

Hybrid car companies have a long time to go if they expect to really go green. According to Harvard business professor Theodore Levitt states &quot;managing products&quot; and &quot;meeting customers&#x27; needs&quot;, &quot;you must adapt to consumer expectations and anticipation of future desires.&quot; This means people buy what they want, if they want a fuel efficient car they buy a Hybrid without thinking about the actual efficiency of the product. This &quot;green myopia&quot; as Ottman calls it, fails because marketers focus on the greenness of the product and not on the actual effectiveness.

Researchers and analysts say people are drawn to the new technology, as well as the convenience of fewer fill-ups. Secondly, people find it rewarding to own the better, newer, flashier, and so-called greener car.

=== Misleading advertising ===
In 2019 the term &quot;self-charging hybrid&quot; became prevalent in advertising, though cars referred to by this name do not offer any different functionality than a standard hybrid electric vehicle provides. The only self-charging effect is in energy recovery via regenerative braking, which is also true of plug-in hybrids, fuel cell electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles.

In January 2020, using this term has been prohibited in Norway, for misleading advertising by Toyota and Lexus. &quot;Our claim is based on the fact that customers never have to charge the battery of their vehicle, as it is recharged during the vehicle use. There is no intention to mislead customers, on the contrary: the point is to clearly explain the difference with plug-in hybrid vehicles.&quot;

==Adoption rate==
While the adoption rate for hybrids in the US is small today (2.2% of new car sales in 2011), this compares with a 17.1% share of new car sales in Japan in 2011, and it has the potential to be very large over time as more models are offered and incremental costs decline due to learning and scale benefits. However, forecasts vary widely. For instance, Bob Lutz, a long-time skeptic of hybrids, indicated he expects hybrids &quot;will never comprise more than 10% of the US auto market.&quot; Other sources also expect hybrid penetration rates in the US will remain under 10% for many years.

More optimistic views as of 2006 include predictions that hybrids would dominate new car sales in the US and elsewhere over the next 10 to 20 years. Another approach, taken by Saurin Shah, examines the penetration rates (or S-curves) of four analogs (historical and current) to hybrid and electrical vehicles in an attempt to gauge how quickly the vehicle stock could be hybridized and/or electrified in the United States. The analogs are (1) the electric motors in US factories in the early 20th century, (2) diesel-electric locomotives on US railways in the 1920–1945 period, (3) a range of new automotive features/technologies introduced in the US over the past fifty years, and 4) e-bike purchases in China over the past few years. These analogs collectively suggest it would take at least 30 years for hybrid and electric vehicles to capture 80% of the US passenger vehicle stock.

The EPA expects the combined market share of new gasoline hybrid light-duty vehicles to reach 13.6% for the 2023 model year from 10.2% in the 2022 model year.

==European Union 2020 regulation standards==
The European Parliament, Council, and European Commission have reached an agreement which is aimed at reducing the average CO2 passenger car emissions to 95 g/km by 2020, according to a European Commission press release.

According to the release, the key details of the agreement are as follows:

Emissions target: The agreement will reduce average CO2 emissions from new cars to 95 g/km from 2020, as proposed by the commission. This is a 40% reduction from the mandatory 2015 target of 130 g/km. The target is an average for each manufacturer&#x27;s new car fleet; it allows OEMs to build some vehicles that emit less than the average and some that emit more.
2025 target: The commission is required to propose a further emissions reduction target by the end-2015 to take effect in 2025. This target will be in line with the EU&#x27;s long-term climate goals.
Super credits for low-emission vehicles: The Regulation will give manufacturers additional incentives to produce cars with CO2 emissions of 50 g/km or less (which will be electric or plug-in hybrid cars). Each of these vehicles will be counted as two vehicles in 2020, 1.67 in 2021, 1.33 in 2022, and then as one vehicle from 2023 onwards. These super credits will help manufacturers further reduce the average emissions of their new car fleet. However, to prevent the scheme from undermining the environmental integrity of the legislation, there will be a 2.5 g/km cap per manufacturer on the contribution that super credits can make to their target in any year.

<text>The Battle of Seneffe took place on 11 August 1674 during the Franco-Dutch War, near Seneffe in Belgium, then part of the Spanish Netherlands. A French army commanded by Condé and a combined Dutch, Imperial, and Spanish force under William of Orange. One of the bloodiest battles of the war, over 20% of those engaged on both sides became casualties, and the result is disputed. 

By 1674, Allied forces in the Spanish Netherlands were numerically superior to the French army under Condé, which was based along the Piéton river near Charleroi. William took the offensive and sought to bring on a battle by outflanking the French positions, but the broken ground forced him to divide his army into three separate columns. 

Condé launched a cavalry attack on the Allied vanguard, and by midday on 11 August had halted their advance. Against the advice of his subordinates, he then ordered a series of frontal assaults which led to heavy casualties on both sides with no concrete result. Fighting continued until nightfall, when the French withdrew to their original positions, and William retired the next day in good order. 

Despite heavier casualties, the Allies retained their numerical advantage, and for the rest of the campaign Condé largely remained on the defensive. Of the two other battles in Flanders before the war ended in 1678, Cassel was sparked by an Allied attempt to relieve Saint-Omer, and Saint-Denis to prevent the French capture of Mons.

==Background==
Since both Louis XIV of France and the Dutch Republic viewed control of the Spanish Netherlands as essential for security and trade, it was a contested area for much of the later 17th century. In the 1667-68 War of Devolution with Spain, France occupied much of the region before the Dutch-led Triple Alliance forced them to withdraw in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668). After this, Louis decided the best way to achieve his territorial ambitions was to first defeat the Dutch.

When the Franco-Dutch War began in May 1672, French troops quickly overran large parts of the Netherlands, but by July the Dutch position had stabilised. The unexpected success of his offensive had encouraged Louis to make excessive demands, while concern at French gains brought the Dutch support from Brandenburg-Prussia, Emperor Leopold, and Charles II of Spain. In August 1673, an Imperial army opened a new front in the Rhineland, and Louis responded by withdrawing from the Netherlands, retaining only Grave and Maastricht. In January 1674, Denmark–Norway joined the anti-French coalition, while in February the Treaty of Westminster ended the Third Anglo-Dutch War, depriving Louis of a key ally against the Dutch.

In May, the main French army under Louis himself attacked the largely undefended Spanish territory of Franche-Comté. Condé remained on the defensive in the Spanish Netherlands, while a Dutch-Spanish army led by William of Orange and Count Monterrey spent June and July attempting to bring him to battle. When this proved unsuccessful, William proposed invading French Flanders, which would threaten Condé&#x27;s rear and force him to fight. Monterrey agreed, since it gave the Spanish an opportunity to recapture the key border town of Charleroi.

On 23 July, William was joined near Nivelles by Imperial troops under de Souches, giving him a total of about 65,000. Having occupied Franche-Comté, Louis sent Condé substantial reinforcements, and by early August he had 45,000 men entrenched along the Piéton river, which joined the Sambre at Charleroi. Concluding these positions were too strong to attack, on 9 August the Allies moved into new lines facing the French left, running from Arquennes to Roux. By doing so, they hoped to tempt Condé into an attack, but when he simply shifted his troops to face the threat, the Allied leaders decided to bypass Seneffe, and advance straight into the French rear.

==Battle==
At 4:00 am on 11 August, the Allies set out in three columns, each marching parallel to the French positions, a formation dictated by the poor roads. The left column was commanded by de Souches, the right by the Marqués de Assentar, commander of the Spanish Army of Flanders, with the bulk of the infantry and artillery in the centre under William. A vanguard of 2,000 cavalry covered the gaps between the columns, with another 5,200 bringing up the rear led by Vaudémont.

At 5:30 am, Condé rode out to observe the Allied movement, and quickly perceived their intention. The terrain they were crossing was marshy and broken up by numerous hedges, walls and woods, with limited exit points; gambling these factors would negate their superior numbers, Condé decided to attack. He sent 400 light cavalry under Saint Clar to skirmish with the Allied rearguard and slow down their march, while also despatching a cavalry brigade under the Marquis de Rannes to seize the high ground north of Seneffe.

Around 10:00 am, de Rannes came into contact with Vaudémont, who asked for infantry support and was sent three battalions under William Maurice. These were placed near the bridge over the Zenne river that flowed through Seneffe, with his cavalry just behind. Despite gout so severe he was unable to wear riding boots, Condé himself led the elite Maison du Roi cavalry across the Zenne above Seneffe, and scattered Vaudémont&#x27;s cavalry, whose headlong flight temporarily disrupted the Spanish troops immediately behind them. 

Simultaneous assaults by de Rannes and the duc de Luxembourg eventually overwhelmed the Allied infantry in Seneffe, who were either killed or taken prisoner. By midday, Condé had inflicted significant losses and gained a clear, if minor, victory. However, he then persisted with a series of frontal assaults against the advice of his subordinates, and the battle degenerated into a number of confused and costly firefights.

William halted his march and established a defensive line, mainly composed of Dutch infantry, centred on the nearby Priory of St Nicolas. Just to the north, Assentar rallied the cavalry who had fled from Seneffe, and brought them back into the battle. They were driven back twice, but several French assaults on the priory were repulsed with heavy losses. When Assentar was mortally wounded in a third charge, the cavalry retreated in confusion, riding over their own infantry, and allowing the French to capture the priory. This last attempt was led by Condé, who was unhorsed and had to be rescued by his son. After taking St Nicolas, Luxembourg&#x27;s troops then captured much of the Allied baggage train.

However, this provided time for William and his subordinates, John Maurice and Aylva, to complete a new defensive line at Fayt. This consisted of 23 Dutch battalions, and around 12:00 pm de Souches deployed his Imperial troops on their left. Condé assumed the Allies were retreating towards Mons, and planned to roll up them up from behind. William however turned Fayt into a strong defensive position, placing cannons along the access roads and hedges. The French were further hampered by the fact that the ground in front was unsuitable for cavalry, while their heavy guns had been left behind during the advance.

Condé ordered Luxembourg and Navailles to attack the Allied flanks, while he himself stormed the village with the French and Swiss Guards. The assaults continued throughout the afternoon, and each time were repulsed with heavy loss. On the French right, Luxembourg&#x27;s attack was delayed as his troops were busy looting the baggage train, and it took him some time to restore order. Reinforced with troops detached from the centre, he almost broke through, but was eventually thrown back. At about 17:00, Condé realised Luxembourg&#x27;s men were exhausted, and ordered them to assume defensive positions. 

On the French left, repeated attacks by Navailles on the Dutch positions were also repulsed. Although some troops finally managed to penetrate their lines around 19:00, William and Nassau-Siegen quickly moved the cavalry up, and restored the position after some hard fighting. Two hours later, Condé finally suspended all operations, although isolated firefights continued. 

Many soldiers slept on the battlefield, and both armies held their positions, expecting to renew the battle next morning, but an intense burst of firing broke out around midnight, with men killed on both sides. Once calm was restored, Condé ordered his troops to fall back on Charleroi. William wanted to pursue them, but his colleagues would not agree, notably de Souches, the Imperial commander. Instead, he ordered his troops to fire a triple salvo to claim victory, then withdrew to Mons.

==Aftermath==
Both sides claimed victory on the basis of &quot;holding their ground&quot; at the end of the fighting, but neither gained a clear advantage, and the overall strategic position remained largely unchanged. Condé had failed to take advantage of his initial success, and his poorly judged attacks rescued William from a serious defeat. Historians are divided on the result; it has variously been described as a French victory, an Allied success, or essentially inconclusive.

Casualties on both sides were enormous, with estimates of Allied losses ranging from 10,000 to 15,000, including prisoners. The dead included Sir Walter Vane, deputy commander of the elite Scots Brigade, François Palm, Colonel of the Dutch Marines, and Assentar, whose body was later returned by Condé for burial. French casualties were between 7,000 to 10,000 dead or wounded, with particularly heavy losses among the officer corps. These shocked the French court, one contemporary writing &quot;We have lost so much by this victory that without the Te Deum and captured flags at Notre Dame, we would believe we had lost the battle&quot;. French military engineer and strategist Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban argued Seneffe showed siege warfare was a better way to achieve victory than costly battles, and Louis ordered Condé to avoid a repeat. 

Although Allied casualties were higher than those of the French, they were quickly replaced by troops from nearby garrisons. In addition, a large convoy arrived outside Mons on 31 August, bringing supplies, a month&#x27;s pay in advance for the survivors and five new Dutch regiments. With Condé unable to replace his losses to the same extent, the Allied numerical advantage was greater than before Seneffe, and William proposed another invasion attempt.

However, one less appreciated advantage held by the French over their opponents in this period was the benefit of an undivided command and unified strategy. For different reasons, neither Monterrey or de Souches were willing to risk another battle, and William was forced to compromise by besieging Oudenarde. Operations commenced on 16 September, and Condé began marching to its relief three days later. The Dutch and Spanish redoubled efforts to breach the walls before his arrival, but without advising his colleagues, de Souches sent the Imperial artillery off to Ghent. On 20 September, Condé took up position on the left bank of the Scheldt river and began bombarding the Allied positions on 21st. Since the Imperial troops would not fight without their guns, and the Dutch and Spanish could not face the French on their own, the Allies were forced to abandon the siege, along with most of their remaining equipment.

After strong protests from the Dutch States General, de Souches was relieved of his command, but this did little to solve the reality of diverging objectives. Emperor Leopold preferred to focus Imperial resources on the Upper Rhine, the Spanish wanted to recoup their losses in the Spanish Netherlands, while the Dutch prioritised retaking Grave and Maastricht. Accordingly, the Spanish returned to their garrisons, the Imperial troops recrossed the Meuse, and William assumed command of operations at Grave. Besieged since 28 June, the town finally surrendered on 29 October. 

Condé received a state reception at Versailles for Seneffe, but his health was failing and the casualties had diminished Louis&#x27; trust in his abilities. He temporarily assumed command of French troops in the Rhineland in July 1675, but retired before the end of the year. In the longer term, Seneffe confirmed Louis&#x27; preference for positional warfare, ushering in a period where siege and manoeuvre dominated military tactics. The war became one of attrition, and although both sides were of similar strength, neither was yet ready to negotiate peace.

<text>The Battle of Solferino (referred to in Italy as the Battle of Solferino and San Martino) on 24 June 1859 resulted in the victory of the allied French army under Napoleon III and the Piedmont-Sardinian army under Victor Emmanuel II (together known as the Franco-Sardinian alliance) against the Austrian army under Emperor Franz Joseph I. It was the last major battle in world history where all the armies were under the personal command of their monarchs. Perhaps 300,000 soldiers fought in the important battle, the largest since the Battle of Leipzig in 1813. There were about 130,000 Austrian troops and a combined total of 140,000 French and allied Piedmontese troops. After the battle, the Austrian emperor refrained from further direct command of the army.

The battle led the Swiss Jean-Henri Dunant to write his book &quot;A Memory of Solferino&quot;. Although he did not witness the battle (his statement is contained in an &quot;unpublished page&quot; included in the 1939 English edition published by the American Red Cross), he toured the field following the battle and was greatly moved by what he saw. Horrified by the suffering of wounded soldiers left on the battlefield, Dunant set about a process that led to the Geneva Conventions and the establishment of the International Red Cross.

==Background==
On 22 June, the French (96,000 men) and Piedmontese (37,000 men) allied army advanced from the Chiese to the Mincio river in northern Italy. The left wing consisted of four Piedmontese divisions, the right wing consisted of the French III and IV corps, while the center consisted of the I and II corps, with the Imperial Guard held in reserve. On 23 June, Franz Josef moved his 1st Army (57,000 men) and 2nd Army (45,500 men) across the Mincio. Both forces were converging on Medole, Solferino, and San Martino.

==Battle==

The Battle of Solferino was a decisive engagement in the Second Italian War of Independence, a crucial step in the Italian Risorgimento. The war&#x27;s geopolitical context was the nationalist struggle to unify Italy, which had long been divided among France, Austria, Spain and numerous independent Italian states. The battle took place near the villages of Solferino and San Martino, Italy, south of Lake Garda between Milan and Verona.

The confrontation was between the Austrians, on one side, and the French and Piedmontese forces, who opposed their advance. In the morning of 23 June, after the arrival of emperor Franz Joseph, the Austrian army changed direction to counterattack along the river Chiese. At the same time, Napoleon III ordered his troops to advance, causing the battle to occur in an unpredicted location. While the Piedmontese fought the Austrian right wing near San Martino, the French battled to the south of them near Solferino against the main Austrian corps.

===Opposing forces===

The Austrian forces were personally led by Emperor Franz Joseph, consisting of the 1st Army, containing four corps (II, III, IX and XI) under Franz von Wimpffen, and the 2nd Army, containing four corps (I, V, VII and VIII) under Franz von Schlick.

The French army at Solferino, personally led by Napoleon III, was divided in four Corps plus the Imperial Guard. Many of its men and generals were veterans of the French conquest of Algeria and the Crimean War, but its commander-in-chief had very limited military experience of note. The Sardinian army had four divisions on the field.

Although all three combatants were commanded by their monarchs, each was seconded by professional soldiers. Marshal Jean-Baptiste Philibert Vaillant served as Chief of Staff to Napoleon III, while Victor Emmanuel was accompanied by his Minister of War, Lieutenant General Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora. The Austrian high command was hindered by the rivalry between the Chief of Staff, Heinrich von Heß, and the Emperor&#x27;s Adjutant General Karl Ludwig von Grünne.

===Battle commences===

According to the allied battle plan formulated on 24 June, the Franco-Sardinian army moved east to deploy along the right river banks of the Mincio. The French were to occupy the villages of Solferino, Cavriana, Guidizzolo and Medole with, respectively, the 1st Corps (Baraguey d&#x27;Hilliers), 2nd Corps (Mac-Mahon), 3rd Corps (Canrobert), and 4th Corps (Niel). The four Sardinian divisions were to take Pozzolengo. After marching a few kilometers, the allies came into contact with the Austrian troops, who had entrenched themselves in those villages. In the absence of a fixed battle plan, the fighting which took place was uncoordinated, which is why so many casualties occurred, and it fell into three separate engagements, at Medole (south), Solferino (centre) and San Martino (north).

===Battle of Campo di Medole===

The battle started at Medole around 4 am. Marching towards Guidizzolo, the 4th Corps encountered an Austrian infantry regiment of the Austrian 1st Army. General Niel immediately decided to engage the enemy and deployed his forces east of Medole. This move prevented the three corps (III, IX and XI) of the Austrian 1st Army from aiding their comrades of the 2nd Army near Solferino, where the main French attacks took place.

The French forces were numerically inferior to the Austrians&#x27;. The 4th Corps contained three infantry divisions under de Luzy, Vinoy and Failly and a cavalry brigade. Niel, holding a thin line of in length, was able to stop the Austrian assaults on his position by ably warding off attacks and counterattacking at opportune moments. 

According to Schneid, &quot;By early afternoon, the Austrian attack had failed and Niel pushed beyond Robecco and Casa Nova halfway to Guidizzolo. At 3:00 pm General Renault&#x27;s division of Canrobert&#x27;s III Corps arrived at Robecco. Niel, now reinforced, launched a coordinated attack on Guidizzolo.&quot; However, the arrival of the Austrian III and XI Korps stopped the French assault, and after two hours, Niel withdrew.

===Battle of Solferino===

Around 4:30 am the advance guard of the 1st Corps (three infantry divisions under Forey, de Ladmirault, and Bazaine, and a cavalry division under Desvaux) came into contact with the Austrian V Corps under Stadion near Castiglione delle Stiviere.

Around 5 am 2nd Corps under Mac-Mahon (two infantry divisions and a cavalry brigade under La Motterouge, Decaen and Gaudin) encountered Hungarian units posted near Ca’Morino (Medole). The Austrian forces were three corps strong (I, V and VII) and positioned on the towns of Solferino, Cavriana and Volta Mantovana. The Austrians were able to hold these positions all day against repeated French attacks.

According to Schneid, &quot;Stadion received reinforcements from Clam Gallas&#x27; I Korps but Napoleon III fed the Imperial Guard divisions into the combat and by 2:00 pm the cemetery and town were surrounded.

Near 3 pm the French reserves, formed by Canrobert&#x27;s 3rd Corps and the Imperial Guard under Regnaud, attacked Cavriana, which was defended by the Austrian I Corps under Clam-Gallas, finally occupying it at 6 pm and thereby breaking through the Austrian center. This breakthrough forced a general retreat of both Austrian armies.

===Battle of San Martino===
On the northern side of the battlefield the Sardinians, four divisions strong, encountered the Austrians around 7 am. A long battle erupted over control of Pozzolengo, San Martino and Madonna della Scoperta. The Austrian VIII Corps under Benedek had 39,000 men and 80 guns and was repeatedly attacked by a Sardinian force of 22,000 men with 48 guns. The Austrians were able to ward off three Sardinian attacks, inflicting heavy losses upon the attackers; at the end of the day Benedek was ordered to retreat with the rest of the Austrian army, but ignored the order and kept resisting. At 8:00 pm a fourth Sardinian assault finally captured the contested hills, and Benedek withdrew. The main Sardinian contribution in the overall battle consisted in keeping Benedek&#x27;s corps deeply engaged throughout the day and preventing the sending of two brigades as reinforcement to the force attacked by the French in Solferino.

===Results===
The battle was a particularly gruelling one, lasting over nine hours and resulting in over 2,386 Austrian troops killed with 10,807 wounded and 8,638 missing or captured. The Allied armies also suffered a total of 2,492 killed, 12,512 wounded and 2,922 captured or missing. Reports of wounded and dying soldiers being shot or bayonetted on both sides added to the horror. In the end, the Austrian forces were forced to yield their positions, and the Allied French-Piedmontese armies won a tactical, but costly, victory. The Austrians retreated to the four fortresses of the Quadrilateral, and the campaign essentially ended.

==Aftermath==

Napoleon III was moved by the losses, as he had argued back in 1852 &quot;the French Empire is peace&quot;, and for reasons including the Prussian threat and domestic protests by the Roman Catholics, he decided to put an end to the war with the Armistice of Villafranca on 11 July 1859. The Piedmontese won Lombardy but not Venetia. Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour, resigned. The Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed in 1861.

This battle would have a long-term effect on the future conduct of military actions. Jean-Henri Dunant, who witnessed the aftermath of the battle in person, was motivated by the horrific suffering of wounded soldiers left on the battlefield to begin a campaign that would eventually result in the Geneva Conventions and the establishment of the International Red Cross. The Movement organized the 150th anniversary commemoration of the battle between 23 and 27 June 2009. The Presidency of the European Union adopted a declaration on the occasion stating that &quot;This battle was also the grounds on which the international community of States has developed and adopted instruments of International Humanitarian Law, the international law rules relevant in times of armed conflict, in particular the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, the 60th anniversary of which will be celebrated this year.&quot;

In 2019, an important memorial event took place on the former battlefield in the presence of Karl von Habsburg, the head of the House of Habsburg, representatives of the Order of St. George and the presidents of the Society of Solferino and San Martino to emphasize the peace of the nations. Wreaths were laid in the cemeteries and the museum was honored. During the event, the battle was re-enacted by hundreds of volunteers.

==The battlefield today==
The area contains a number of memorials to the events surrounding the battles.

There is a circular tower, Tower of San Martino della Battaglia, dominating the area, a memorial to Victor Emmanuel II. It is 70 m high and was built in 1893. In the town there is a museum, with uniforms and weapons of the time, and an ossuary chapel.

At Solferino there is also a museum, displaying arms and mementos of the time, and an ossuary, containing the bones of thousands of victims.

Nearby Castiglione delle Stiviere, where many of the wounded were taken after the battle, is the site of the museum of the International Red Cross, focusing on the events that led to the formation of that organization.

==References in popular culture==
Elizabeth Barrett Browning&#x27;s poem &quot;The Forced Recruit at Solferino&quot; commemorates this battle (&quot;Last Poems&quot; 1862).
Joseph Roth&#x27;s 1932 novel &quot;Radetzky March&quot; opens at the Battle of Solferino. There, the father of the novel&#x27;s Trotta dynasty is immortalized as the Hero of Solferino.

The Battle of Solferino was depicted also in a 2006 television drama &quot;Henry Dunant: Du rouge sur la croix&quot; (English title: &quot;Henry Dunant: Red on the Cross&quot;), which tells the story of the signing of the Geneva Conventions and the founding of the Red Cross.

A Memory of Solferino, the battle, and the town itself are discussed in 2010&#x27;s Chang-Rae Lee&#x27;s novel The Surrendered.

<doc id="157739" wikidata="Q16541029" url="?curid=157739" title="Battle of Saint-Dizier (January 1814)">
<text>The first Battle of Saint-Dizier was fought on 27 January 1814 near Saint-Dizier during the Campaign in north-east France (1814) of the War of the Sixth Coalition. It resulted in the victory of the French cavalry under Édouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud (commander in Napoleon&#x27;s army) against Russian cavalry under the command of general Sergey Nikolaevich Lanskoy (Lanskoï). 

The First Battle of Bar-sur-Aube on 24 January 1814 had been an indecisive clash between invading Austrian and Württembergish forces and defending French troops, which retreated afterwards. The Russo-Prussian under the command of Blücher arrived at the river Aube on 27 January, passing Brienne and marching towards Lesmont. A Russian cavalry vanguard led by Lanskoy (part of Fabian Gottlieb von der Osten-Sacken&#x27;s troops) was scouting the area to the north, moving past Saint Dizier towards Vitry-le-François. Meanwhile, in the morning of 27 January, Napoleon sent Milhaud&#x27;s French cavalry from Vitry to Saint-Dizier, followed by the 2nd corps, itself supported by the 6th, the divisions of the young guard and the 1st cavalry corps. 

At dawn, the French cavalry attack took Lanskoy by surprise, and he was driven back to Saint-Dizier. His infantry was soon driven out by general Guillaume Philibert Duhesme&#x27;s infantry division, which did not spare the Russian cavalry, reinforced in the morning by Prince Biron&#x27;s flying brigade. Hotly pursued all the way to Eurville by the French cavalry, Lanskoy, unable to fall back on Wassy, from where he could have taken the most direct route to Brienne via Montier-en-Der, was reduced to heading for Joinville, in order to reach the road to Brienne via Doulevant and Soulaines. He stopped in the evening at Doulevant, while the French cavalry, which had pushed forward along the Joinville and Eclaron roads, reached Wassy.

Napoleon and his troops had left Ligny the day before; Lanskoy held Saint-Dizier with 800 dragoons, and he left the town to join Blücher. 

The second Battle of Saint-Dizier occurred on 26 March 1814, and resulted the victory of French under Napoleon Bonaparte against Russians under General Ferdinand Wintzingerode.

<doc id="157740" wikidata="Q197170" url="?curid=157740" title="Zhang Chunqiao">
<text>Zhang Chunqiao (; 1 February 1917 – 21 April 2005) was a prominent Chinese political theorist, writer, and politician. He came to the national spotlight during the late stages of the Cultural Revolution, and was a member of the ultra-Maoist group dubbed the &quot;Gang of Four&quot;.

Zhang joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1938, later becoming a prominent journalist in charge of &quot;Jiefang Daily&quot; after the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic. He rose to prominence after his October 1958 article entitled &quot;Destroy the Ideology of Bourgeois Right&quot; caught the attention of Mao Zedong, who ordered its reproduction in &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;.

With the onset of the Cultural Revolution, he was appointed as a member of the Cultural Revolution Group. In 1967, Zhang organized the Shanghai People&#x27;s Commune and briefly became its chairman, effectively overthrowing the local Shanghai government and local party structures. Afterwards, he was appointed as the director of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee. He joined the Politburo in 1969, and its inner Standing Committee in 1973, reaching his zenith as the country&#x27;s second-ranking vice premier in 1975.

After Mao&#x27;s death in 1976, Zhang was arrested along with the other members of what would become known as the Gang of Four. He was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve, later commuted to life imprisonment, and then further reduced to 18 years. He was released from prison in 1998 to undergo medical treatment, and died in 2005.

==Early life==
Born in Juye County, Shandong, Zhang worked as a writer in Shanghai in the 1930s, developing strong connections within the city. After attending a 1938 conference in Yan&#x27;an, he joined the Chinese Communist Party.

== People&#x27;s Republic of China ==
With the proclamation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Zhang became a prominent Shanghai journalist, put in charge of the newspaper &quot;Jiefang Daily&quot;. Here, he met Jiang Qing.

Zhang first came to prominence as the result of his October 1958 article in &quot;Jiefang Daily&quot; entitled &quot;Destroy the Ideology of Bourgeois Right&quot;. Mao Zedong took notice of the article, and ordered it to be reprinted in &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;, along with an accompanying &quot;Editor&#x27;s Note&quot; expressing his mild approval. Zhang was seen as one of Mao&#x27;s firmest supporters as the chairman engaged in an ideological struggle within party leadership with rival revolutionary Liu Shaoqi.
=== Cultural Revolution ===
Zhang spent much of the Cultural Revolution shuttling between Beijing and Shanghai. He arrived in Shanghai in November 1966 at representing the Cultural Revolution Group in their push to stop Cao Diqiu from dispersing workers in Anting. He signed the &quot;Five-Point Petition of Workers&quot;, and in February 1967 organized the Shanghai People&#x27;s Commune with Wang Hongwen and Yao Wenyuan, essentially overthrowing the city government and local party structure, becoming chairman of the city&#x27;s Revolutionary Committee, a title that essentially combined the former posts of mayor and party secretary. This structure would persist until the latter post was restored in 1971. 

In April 1969, he joined the Politburo, and in 1973 he was promoted to the Standing Committee therein. In January 1975, Zhang became the second-ranked Vice Premier, and penned &quot;On Exercising All-Round Dictatorship Over the Bourgeoisie&quot; to promote the theoretical study of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Deng Xiaoping was the first-ranked Vice Premier at the time, but was out of the office by 1976. After the death of Zhou Enlai in January 1976, Zhang Chunqiao competed for the position of Premier with his political opponent Deng Xiaoping. However, Mao did not choose either of them. Instead, he chooses Hua Guofeng as the new Premier.

=== Arrest and death ===
Zhang was arrested along with the other members of the so-called &quot;Gang of Four&quot; in October 1976, as part of a conspiracy by Ye Jianying, Li Xiannian and the new party leader Hua Guofeng. He was expelled from the Communist Party in July 1977, and then sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve in 1984, alongside Jiang Qing. His sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment, and was further reduced to 18 years in December 1997.

In 1998, Zhang was released from prison to undergo medical treatment, then lived in obscurity in Shanghai until he died from pancreatic cancer in April 2005.

<text>Yao Wenyuan (January 12, 1931 – December 23, 2005) was a Chinese literary critic, politician, and member of the Gang of Four during China&#x27;s Cultural Revolution.

==Biography==
Yao Wenyuan was born in Zhuji, Zhejiang, to an intellectual family. His father, Yao Pengzi () was a writer, translator and art critic.

He began his career in Shanghai as a literary critic, where he became known for his sharp attacks against colleagues, such as in June 1957 against the newspaper &quot;Wenhuibao&quot;. Since that time, he began to closely collaborate with leftist Shanghai politicians, including the head of the city&#x27;s Propaganda Department, Zhang Chunqiao. His article &quot;On the New Historical Beijing Opera &#x27;Hai Rui Dismissed from Office, published in &quot;Wenhuibao&quot; on November 10, 1965, launched the Cultural Revolution.

The article was about a popular opera by Wu Han, who was deputy mayor of Beijing. Zhang Chunqiao and Jiang Qing feared the play could be counter-revolutionary because parallels could be drawn between the characters in the play and officials in the communist government. In the play, Hai Rui, a government official, speaks for the peasants against the imperial government, criticizing officials for hypocritically oppressing the masses while pretending to be virtuous men. Hai Rui is dismissed because of this. Yao claimed it was a coded attack on Mao for dismissing in 1959 then-minister of defense Peng Dehuai, a critic of Mao&#x27;s Great Leap Forward.

Confused by this unexpected attack, Beijing&#x27;s party leadership tried to protect Wu Han, providing Mao the pretext for a full-scale &quot;struggle&quot; against them in the following year. Yao was soon promoted to the Cultural Revolution Group.

Yao Wenyuan was an ideal candidate for the criticism for such an opera because of his consistent socialist background. In April 1969 he joined the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, working on official propaganda. A member of &quot;Proletarian writers for purity&quot; he was the editor of &quot;Liberation Daily&quot;, one of Shanghai&#x27;s main newspapers. He joined the state&#x27;s efforts to rid China&#x27;s writers union of the famous writer Hu Feng.

On October 6, 1976, he was arrested for his participation in the Cultural Revolution and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment in 1981. He was released on October 5, 1996, and spent the remainder of his life writing a book and studying Chinese history. He lived in Huzhou and Shanghai and became the last surviving member of the Gang of Four after Zhang Chunqiao died in April 2005. According to China&#x27;s official Xinhua news agency, he died of diabetes on December 23, 2005, aged 74.

<text>Wang Hongwen (December 1935 – 3 August 1992) was a Chinese labour activist and politician who was the youngest member of the &quot;Gang of Four&quot;. He rose to prominence during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), after organizing the Shanghai People&#x27;s Commune, to become one of the foremost members of national leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

At the pinnacle of his power he was the second Vice Chairman of the CCP, and ranked third in the Communist Party&#x27;s hierarchy. Following Mao&#x27;s death in 1976, Wang was deposed in an intra-party coup, arrested and charged with &quot;counterrevolutionary activity&quot;, then sentenced to life imprisonment in 1981.

== Early life ==
Wang was born in a village in the outskirts of Changchun, Jilin province. In 1950 he joined the army and, in 1951, he took part in the Korean War as a messenger in the communication department and by playing the horn.
He joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1953. After the war, he was sent to Shanghai to work in Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Textile Mill as a machine operator and in 1960 he moved to the factory security department for militia work, where he later was placed in charge as a security cadre for all militia work on the factory.

== Political career ==
On 12 June 1966, he opposed the factory authorities by posting a Big-character poster where he, and other signatories, accused them of practicing revisionism. Despite at first being admonished for this, he got the blessing of the Cultural Revolution work team dispatched to the factory. This first work team was replaced by a team sent by the Shanghai Provincial Committee which did not support Wang Hongwen&#x27;s attack.

In October he put up a second poster attacking this work team and founded a rebel group named &quot;Warriors Sworn to the Death to Carry Through with the Cultural Revolution to the End.&quot; Then, he went with fifteen of his followers to Beijing and in his return won the admiration of other rebels of Shanghai. This catapulted him as the leader of the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters that was founded in November.

Later, through this position he met Zhang Chunqiao and became involved in a Red Guards group. He organized the Shanghai Commune in January 1967, and was catapulted to national prominence as a daring rebel leader.

=== Rise to power ===
At the 9th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, Wang was elected a member of the Central Committee. Following the Lin Biao incident, Wang was put in charge of the investigation into the case in the Shanghai area, reporting directly to Mao. At the 10th National Congress of the CCP in 1973, Wang, at the age of 38, was elevated to second ranking CCP vice chairman, and the third-ranking member of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), just behind Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai.

Wang was one of the youngest members of the PSC in the post-revolution Communist Party, having joined the body aged 37. He was the same age as some PSC members who took office even after the turn of the century, such as Luo Gan (served on the PSC between 2002 and 2007), who was also born in 1935. All signs pointed to Wang being trained as Mao&#x27;s successor. However, Wang Hongwen was being sidelined by Mao Zedong in 1974 after Mao criticised Wang for the gang of four. Instead, Hua Guofeng, a more moderate figure, was chosen to succeed Zhou instead. Between 1974 and early 1976, Mao transferred much power to Deng Xiaoping, giving Deng the power to run daily affairs of the party, the State Council and the military, and Wang Hongwen complained about this move.

=== Downfall and death ===
Wang was an important player during and after the death of Mao, and served as the masters of ceremonies for his funeral service on national radio on 18 September 1976. After the death of Mao Zedong, Wang Hongwen became the second highest ranking official in the CPC, only behind Hua Guofeng. On October 6, 1976, Hua Guofeng and Ye Jianying pretended to hold a meeting in Zhongnanhai&#x27;s Huairen Hall to discuss the fifth volume of &quot;Mao Zedong&#x27;s Selected Works&quot;, and informed the members of the Gang of Four to come and discuss. When Wang arrived, his personal guards were asked to stay outside the courtyard, and when several agents from the Central Security Bureau restrained him in the corridor, he shouted, &quot;I&#x27;m here for the meeting, what are you doing?&quot; while punching and kicking the agents. Wang came to the hall with his arms restrained, and Hua began to read out the &quot;decision&quot; of the CCP Central Committee to him, but unexpectedly during the reading Wang broke away from the agents and shouted and lunged at Ye Jianying, who was present, but was subdued again before he could reach him. According to historian Immanuel C.Y. Hsü, the coup was not completely bloodless – Wang killed two of the agents trying to capture him, and was wounded himself before being subdued. He was tried and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1981. He died of liver cancer in a Beijing hospital on 3 August 1992, at the age of 56.

<text>The Battle of Steenkerque, also known as &quot;Steenkerke&quot;, &quot;Steenkirk&quot;, &quot;Steynkirk&quot; or &quot;Steinkirk&quot; was fought on 3 August 1692, during the Nine Years&#x27; War, near Steenkerque, then part of the Spanish Netherlands but now in modern Belgium. A French force under Marshal François-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg, repulsed a surprise attack by an Allied army led by William of Orange. After several hours of heavy fighting, the Allies were forced to retreat, although a French counterattack proved fruitless.

==Background==
Luxembourg had already achieved his main objective for 1692 by capturing Namur in June and wanted to avoid battle. He therefore adopted a strong defensive position facing north-west, with his right anchored on the Zenne at Steenkerque and his left near Enghien, assuming the Allies would not dare to attack it. This approach conformed with then accepted tactical wisdom, with battles considered too risky and unpredictable, unless there was a clear chance of defeating the enemy. 

William of Orange had replaced Waldeck as commander of the Allied army, which was encamped about Halle. He would probably have done as Luxembourg expected and not risked an attack had he not seen an opportunity to take the French by surprise. Accordingly, before dawn on 3 August he ordered his troops to move against the French right. 

William had prepared the attack thoroughly. 300 carefully chosen cavalry and dragoons took up positions a short distance from the French army camp. The French paid no attention to them as they assumed these were covering troops for Allied foragers. In reality, however, they served to enable 800 pioneers equipped with axes and shovels to widen forest paths, fill ditches and make passages in hedges unnoticed. Once the pioneers had finished their work, Lieutenant General Württemberg was to take possession of Steenkerke with a vanguard of 5,000 to 6,000 Dutch, English, Danish and German infantrymen, and artillery of six low three-pounders and ten regimental pieces. After the French were driven out, he would have to hold out there until the rest of the army arrived.

The main attack would be carried out by three assault columns: 

The first column under the Prince of Nassau-Usingen, with a strength of 8,000 men, composed of the English Ramsay brigade and the Dutch Fagel brigade.

The second column, commanded by the Frisian stadtholder, Henry Casimir II, with a strength of 6,000 to 7,000 men, composed of the Dutch brigades of Salisch and l&#x27;Ecluse.

The third column under the Count of Solms, with a strength of 11,000 men comprised the Dutch, English and Scottish Guards, Churchill&#x27;s English Brigade and Ellenberger&#x27;s Danish brigade.

Each assault column was equipped with six long three-pounders and 12 regimental pieces. 15,000 horsemen under the Earl of Athlone had the order to follow the infantry and support its attack wherever possible.

==Battle==
Led by the Duke of Wurttemberg the Allied advance guard of infantry and pioneers deployed silently around 5:00 a.m. close to the French encampments. The day began well for the Allies. After a short firefight, Wurttemberg managed to take control of a hill and forest opposite Steenkerke and then deployed artillery, with which he at 9:00 a.m. started methodically cannonading the enemy. For further progress, he depended on the arrival of the main force. 

To Württemberg&#x27;s anger, it took all morning before Lieutenant General Hugh Mackay showed up with the infantry of the first column. Where the other two columns were at the time was unknown to him. Whether through bad luck or mismanagement, the cavalry, which had been supposed to follow the infantry, had deployed in front of the infantry, behind Mackay and Wurttemberg, thus preventing the infantry of the columns under Henry Casimir and Solms from reaching the front line.

Montal, the extremely experienced commander of the French vanguard, meanwhile, hurriedly formed up his troops. William of Orange considered it unwise to wait any longer and despite the delay, loss of surprise and the absence of 2 of the 3 columns, ordered Wurttemberg and Mackay around 1:00 p.m. to finally begin the main attack. Their troops captured the first three lines of trenches and came very close to achieving a stunning victory. However, Montal held off the initial Allied attack long enough to enable Luxembourg to bring up his main force.

The piecemeal deployment of the Allied main body meant little or no attempt was made to engage the French centre. With his troops spread out over the fortifications and under huge pressure from the French, Mackay asked William for permission to withdraw and reorganise. Ordered to continue the assault, he allegedly said &#x27;The Lord&#x27;s will be done&#x27; and taking his place at the head of his regiment was killed with many of his division. Over 8,000 of the 15,000 Allied troops engaged became casualties, with five British regiments almost wiped out. Around 6:00 p.m., William decided to call off the attack. Württemberg raged to Mérode-Westerloo, the young adjutant who came to deliver this news, that he would have been able to drive the French out of their positions if the second and third columns had shown up, when now only 14,000 men had been at his disposal. Mérode-Westerloo rode back to the king and later wrote: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t restrain myself from saying to the king that a great opportunity had been lost to defeat the French. He smiled under his big hat, but said nothing.&quot;

Seeing an opportunity for a decisive victory, Luxembourg committed the elite &quot;Maison du Roi&quot; to a frontal assault, reinforced by troops from Enghien under Boufflers. Contesting every step, Wurttemberg&#x27;s corps plus the remnants of the troops of the first column were driven back. The counterattack, however, proved very costly to the French, for the columns of Henry Casimir and Solms had finally reached the edge of the forest and were now getting into combat with the French. The battle only ended with the coming of darkness. William then ordered his troops to fall back on their original positions around Halle, covered by a rear-guard under Hendrik Van Nassau-Ouwerkerk. The French quickly called off the pursuit, having suffered losses of around 7,000-8,000 killed or wounded themselves.

==Aftermath==
Both sides could claim victory: the French for repelling the Allied attack, holding their ground and possibly foiling an attack on Namur, and the Allies for bloodying the noses of the French and perhaps preventing them from advancing towards Liège. After the battle, the two armies continued to oppose each other for the rest of the summer, but nothing significant happened before they went to winter quarters.

During the battle, the Allies had held the advantage of greater firepower. They fought with the new flintlock muskets while the French had still fought with the old muskets. When Louis XIV heard from his generals that they would have lost had the Allied attack been better coordinated, Louis immediately demanded that his infantry be rearmed with the new musket. However, due to problems with manufacturers and resistance within the French officer corps, it took several years before every infantryman was equipped with the new weapons.

Following the battle, some English politicians claimed their heavy losses were caused not through incompetence, but a deliberate act by Solms, and demanded his removal. These allegations were primarily driven by anti-Dutch sentiment and opposition to the war within Parliament, and cannot be substantiated. Presented with these claims when he returned to London in October, William simply agreed to consider it. Solms died of wounds received at Landen the following year.

==Steenkirk cravat==
An article of dress was named after the battle. A &quot;steenkirk&quot; (also Steinquerque or Stinquerque in the mémoirs of Abbé de Choisy) was a lace cravat loosely or negligently worn, with long lace ends. According to Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Âge de Louis XIV&quot;, it was in fashion after the Battle of Steenkerque, where the French gentlemen had to fight with disarranged cravats on account of the surprise sprung by the Allies. 

The Steenkirk cravat was a popular article in both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s fashion in France for years later. It spread from France to England, where it also was worn by both women and men.

== In popular culture ==
A French-language novel by the Belgian journalist and author René Henoumont was published in 1979 under the title &quot;La maison dans le frêne&quot; (&quot;The House in the Ash Tree&quot;), with the explanatory subtitle &quot;ou la bataille de Steenkerque&quot; (&quot;or the Battle of Steenkerque&quot;). The work is organised into 12 parts, corresponding with the months of the year. Each part contains between 2 and 4 chapters. The narrator and author tells the reader about his (mostly autobiographical) life in the village of Steenkerque as he ponders life, nature, gardening and wars. In his silent dialogue with the nature around, the trees become the men who once waged war in the Belgian village.

<text>The Battles of Stockach and Engen were fought on 3 May 1800 between the army of the First French Republic under Jean Victor Marie Moreau and the army of the Habsburg monarchy led by Paul Kray. The fighting near Engen resulted in a stalemate. However, while the two main armies were engaged at Engen, Claude Lecourbe captured Stockach from its Austrian defenders (the latter commanded by Joseph Louis, Prince of Lorraine-Vaudémont). The loss of his main supply base at Stockach compelled Kray to order a retreat. Stockach is located near the northwestern end of Lake Constance while Engen is west of Stockach. The action occurred during the War of the Second Coalition, part of the French Revolutionary Wars.

==Background==
&quot;See the Messkirch 1800 Order of Battle for details of the French and Austrian armies in the campaign.&quot;

===Plans===
At the beginning of 1800 the armies of France and the Habsburgs faced each other across the Rhine. Feldzeugmeister Paul Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. Beside his regular Austrian soldiers he led 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the Duchy of Württemberg, 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz and 7,000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol. Of these 25,000 men were deployed east of Lake Constance (Bodensee) to protect the Vorarlberg. Kray posted his main body of 95,000 soldiers in the L-shaped angle, where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of Switzerland to a northward flow along the eastern border of France. Unwisely, Kray set up his main magazine at Stockach, only a day&#x27;s march from French-held Switzerland.

Feldmarschall-Leutnant Prince Heinrich XV of Reuss-Plauen commanded the 25,000 troops in the Vorarlberg which included the Tyrolese. The 40,000-man center led by Feldmarschall-Leutnant Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf was posted from Lake Constance on the east to Villingen on the west, with its forward elements along the Rhine between the lake and Basel. The right wing consisted of the 15,000 troops of Feldmarschall-Leutnant Michael von Kienmayer guarding the passes through the Black Forest, 16,000 soldiers under Feldmarschall-Leutnant Anton Sztáray behind the Rhine from the Rench River north to the Main River and 8,000 men defending Frankfurt. Finally, a 20,000-strong reserve hovered near Stockach. There were garrisons in all the major fortresses and a small naval squadron on Lake Constance. In total, Kray disposed of 110,000 infantry, 25,000 cavalry, 4,000 gunners and 500 artillery pieces. In his rear was a major supply base and an entrenched camp at Ulm. The Habsburg general was able to trace one line of supply through Munich to Austria and a second one through Regensburg to Bohemia.

General of Division Jean Victor Marie Moreau commanded a well-equipped army of 137,000 French troops. Of these, 108,000 troops were available for field operations while the other 29,000 watched the Swiss border and held the Rhine fortresses. First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte offered a bold plan of operations based on outflanking the Austrians by a push from Switzerland, but Moreau declined to follow it. Rather, Moreau planned to cross the Rhine near Basel where the river swung to the north. A French column would distract Kray from Moreau&#x27;s true intentions by crossing the Rhine from the west. Bonaparte wanted General of Division Claude Lecourbe&#x27;s corps to be detached to Italy after the initial battles, but Moreau had other plans.

===French Army===
At the beginning of March, Bonaparte ordered Moreau to form his army into all-arms army corps. Accordingly, by 20 March 1800, there were four corps, with the last one serving as an army reserve. The Right Wing was led by Lecourbe and included four divisions led by Generals of Division Dominique Vandamme, Joseph Hélie Désiré Perruquet de Montrichard, Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge and Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty. Vandamme commanded 9,632 infantry and 540 cavalry, Montrichard supervised 6,998 infantry, Lorge had 8,238 infantry and 464 cavalry and Nansouty directed 1,500 grenadiers and 1,280 cavalry. The Center was led by General of Division Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr and comprised four divisions under Generals of Division Michel Ney, Louis Baraguey d&#x27;Hilliers and Jean Victor Tharreau and General of Brigade Nicolas Ernault des Bruslys. Ney had 7,270 infantry and 569 cavalry, d&#x27;Hilliers counted 8,340 infantry and 542 cavalry, Tharreau led 8,326 infantry and 611 cavalry and Bruslys directed 2,474 light infantry and 1,616 cavalry.

The Left Wing was commanded by General of Division Gilles Joseph Martin Brunteau Saint-Suzanne and consisted of four divisions under Generals of Division Claude Sylvestre Colaud, Joseph Souham, Claude Juste Alexandre Legrand and Henri François Delaborde. Colaud led 2,740 infantry and 981 cavalry, Souham had 4,687 infantry and 1,394 cavalry, Legrand counted 5,286 infantry and 1,094 cavalry and Delaborde supervised 2,573 infantry and 286 cavalry. Moreau personally directed the Reserve which was made up of three infantry and one cavalry divisions led by Generals of Division Antoine Guillaume Delmas, Antoine Richepanse, Charles Leclerc and Jean-Joseph Ange d&#x27;Hautpoul. Delmas had 8,635 infantry and 1,031 cavalry, Richepanse directed 6,848 infantry and 1,187 cavalry, Leclerc commanded 6,035 infantry and 963 cavalry and d&#x27;Hautpoul counted 1,504 heavy cavalry.

There were additional detached troops under Moreau&#x27;s overall leadership. These included General of Division Louis-Antoine-Choin de Montchoisy&#x27;s 7,715 infantry and 519 cavalry, detached to hold Switzerland. Fortresses in Alsace and along the Rhine were defended by forces under Generals of Division François Xavier Jacob Freytag, 2,935 infantry, Joseph Gilot, 750 cavalry, Alexandre Paul Guérin de Joyeuse de Chateauneuf-Randon, 3,430 infantry and 485 cavalry, Antoine Laroche Dubouscat, 3,001 infantry and 91 cavalry and Jean François Leval, 5,640 infantry and 426 cavalry.

<doc id="157747" wikidata="Q2342758" url="?curid=157747" title="Battle of the Chernaya">
<text>The Battle of the Chernaya (also Tchernaïa; Russian: Сражение у Черной речки, Сражение у реки Черной, literally: Battle of the Black River) was fought near to the Chernaya River during the Crimean War on August 16, 1855. The battle was fought between Russian, French, Piedmontese and Ottoman troops. The Chernaya River is on the outskirts of Sevastopol, near the line of the allies&#x27; siege of the city. The battle ended in a Russian retreat and a victory for the French, Piedmontese, and Ottomans.

==Planning==
The battle was planned as an offensive by the Russians with the aim of forcing the Allied forces (French, British, Piedmontese, and Ottoman) to retreat and abandon their siege of Sevastopol. Tsar Alexander II had ordered his commander in chief in the Crimea, Prince Michael Gorchakov to attack the besieging forces before they were reinforced further.
&lt;br&gt;The Russian generals prepared a massive force: a 47,000-strong infantry, supported by a 10,000-strong cavalry, which were organized in 6 divisions: the IV, the V, the VI, the VII, the XII, the XVII, together with another division, the II, in reserve.&lt;br&gt;
The Tsar hoped that by gaining a victory, he could force a more favorable resolution to the conflict. Gorchakov did not think that an attack would be successful but believed the greatest chance of success to be near the French and Piedmontese positions on the Chernaya River. The Tsar ordered the hesitating Gorchakov to hold a war council to plan the attack. The attack was planned for the morning of August 16 in the hope to surprise the French and Piedmontese as they had just celebrated the Feast day of the Emperor (France) and Assumption Day (Piedmontese). The Russians hoped that because of these feasts the enemy would be tired and less attentive to the Russians.

==The battle==
58,000 Russian troops in two army corps under Prince Michael Gorchakov fought against 36,000 French and Sardinian troops under French General Aimable Pélissier and Piedmontese General Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora. Ottoman forces—six battalions of infantry and one artillery battery—were commanded by [(Ottoman name &quot;Sefer Pasha&quot;). Although the British correspondents were amazed at the courageousness and impetuosity of the Russian attack, the assault was handicapped by poor organization and lack of experienced soldiers which, due to Sevastopol, forced their corps to consist mostly of militia.

In the cover of the morning fog, the Russians advanced towards Traktir Bridge with 47,000 infantry, 10,000 cavalry and 270 cannon under command of General Pavel Liprandi on the left and General on the right. The two generals had been ordered by Gorchakov not to cross the river until given explicit orders. Annoyed that things weren&#x27;t happening fast enough, Gorchakov sent a note to his generals with the words &quot;Let&#x27;s start it.&quot; By this, Gorchakov only meant that the Russians should start to deploy their forces. His generals interpreted his words as his order to attack and they acted accordingly, although reserve forces were still en route to the battlefield. 

The attacking Russians immediately met stiff resistance from the French and Sardinians. Read&#x27;s forces crossed the river near the Traktir Bridge but without cavalry and artillery support, they were easily stopped by the French on the Fedyukhin Heights (Федюхины высоты). Read then ordered his reserve formation, the 5th Infantry Division, to attack the Heights but instead of launching a coordinated assault, he fed them piecemeal into the fray. Going in regiment by regiment, the assaulting reserve troops accomplished nothing. Seeing this, Gorchakov ordered Read to deploy the entire division against the French. This forced the French back up the hill but the Russians could not capture the Heights. In the following retreat General Read was killed. Upon the death of Read, Gorchakov took personal command of the right and ordered 8 battalions of Liprandi&#x27;s left wing to reinforce the right wing. These forces came under fire from the Sardinians and were driven back. At 10 o’clock in the morning, Gorchakov concluded that the situation was hopeless and ordered a general retreat.

The bravery of Sardinian troops and the French soldiers of the 50th, 82nd, 95th, 97th of the line; the 19th Foot Chasseurs; and the 2nd and 3rd Zouaves was especially noted. The Sardinian troops&#x27; valiant effort at the battle was a contributing factor to their inclusion at the negotiation tables at the end of the war; it was there that the Kingdom of Sardinia began looking for the aid of other European nations towards the Unification of Italy.

==Tolstoy==
Russian Count Leo Tolstoy was a participant in the Battle of the Chernaya River. He witnessed as the Russians crossed the river and started up the hillside in the morning sunlight. Tolstoy saw Russian soldiers being killed in clusters as shells exploded around them. Before the morning was over, the Russians were forced to retreat. They left thousands of their dead comrades behind. Tolstoy was depressed and angered by the slaughter. He believed much of it was due to incompetent generals and staff. Tolstoy vented his anger by composing a satiric stanza, an approximate translation of which reads:

&quot;The toppest brass&quot;
&quot;Sat down to meet&quot;
&quot;And pondered long;&quot;
&quot;Topographers&quot;
&quot;Lined paper black&quot;
&quot;But all forgot&quot;
&quot;The deep ravine&quot;
&quot;They had to cross!&quot;

&lt;br&gt;This humorous song soon gained widespread popularity among the Russian soldiers, and is the only piece of verse Tolstoy is known to have written. The stanza from Tolstoy&#x27;s song &quot;Гладко вписано в бумаге, Да забыли про овраги&quot; (&quot;It was smoothly written into the papers / But it was forgotten about the ravines&quot;) entered as a catch phrase, in a slightly modified form &quot;Гладко было на бумаге...&quot; (&quot;It was 
smooth on the paper, ...&quot;).

==Aftermath==
The battle was a disaster for the Russians. Even with numerical superiority, the Russians had managed to lose the battle and suffer almost five times as many casualties as the Allies. Tsar Alexander had hoped for a Russian victory so that he could negotiate a peace with favorable terms. That hope was now lost. As a result of the slaughter that took place at the battle, the Russian soldiers had lost their trust in the Russian commanders and it was now only a question of time before the Russian army would be forced to surrender Sevastopol.

<text>Since June 30, 1993, Malta has been subdivided into 68 localities, governed by local councils, , meaning municipalities or borough, and considered by the Maltese as the equivalent to a basic village or towns, where appropriate. These form the most basic type of local government and are subdivisions of the country&#x27;s first-level regions.

According to the Local Councils Act (Chapter 363 of the Laws of Malta), Art. 3:

(1) Every locality shall have a Council which shall have all such functions as are granted to it by this Act
(5) Each locality shall be referred to by the name as designated in the Second Schedule and any reference to that locality shall be by the name so designated.
