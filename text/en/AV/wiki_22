<text>John Rogers (c. 1505 – 4 February 1555) was an English clergyman, Bible translator and commentator. He guided the development of the Matthew Bible in vernacular English during the reign of Henry VIII and was the first English Protestant executed as a heretic under Mary I, who was determined to restore Roman Catholicism.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Rogers was born in Deritend, an area of Birmingham then within the parish of Aston. His father was also called John Rogers and was a lorimer – a maker of bits and spurs – whose family came from Aston; his mother was Margaret Wyatt, the daughter of a tanner with family in Erdington and Sutton Coldfield.

Rogers was educated at the Guild School of St John the Baptist in Deritend, and at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge University, where he graduated B.A. in 1526. Between 1532 and 1534 he was rector of Holy Trinity the Less in the City of London.

===Antwerp and the &quot;Matthew Bible&quot;===
In 1534, Rogers went to Antwerp as chaplain to the English merchants of the Company of the Merchant Adventurers.

Here he met William Tyndale, under whose influence he abandoned the Roman Catholic faith, and married Antwerp native Adriana de Weyden (b. 1522, anglicised to Adrana Pratt in 1552) in 1537. After Tyndale&#x27;s death, Rogers pushed on with his predecessor&#x27;s English version of the Old Testament, which he used as far as &quot;2 Chronicles&quot;, employing Myles Coverdale&#x27;s translation (1535) for the remainder and for the &quot;Apocrypha&quot;. Although it is claimed that Rogers was the first person to ever print a complete English Bible that was translated directly from the original Greek and Hebrew, there was also a reliance upon a Latin translation of the Hebrew Bible by Sebastian Münster and published in 1534/5.

Tyndale&#x27;s New Testament was published in 1526. The complete Bible was put out under the pseudonym of Thomas Matthew in 1537; it was printed in Paris and Antwerp by Adriana&#x27;s uncle, Sir Jacobus van Meteren. Richard Grafton published the sheets and got leave to sell the edition (1500 copies) in England. At the insistence of Archbishop Cranmer, the &quot;King&#x27;s most gracious license&quot; was granted to this translation. Previously in the same year, the 1537 reprint of Myles Coverdale&#x27;s translation had been granted such a licence.

The pseudonym &quot;Matthew&quot; is associated with Rogers, but it seems more probable that Matthew stands for Tyndale&#x27;s own name, which, back then, was dangerous to employ in England. Rogers had at least some involvement with the translation, although he most likely used large parts of the Tyndale and the Coverdale versions. Some historians declare Rogers &quot;produced&quot; the Matthew Bible. One source states that he &quot;assembled&quot; the Bible. Other sources suggest that his share in that work was probably confined to translating the prayer of Manasses (inserted here for the first time in a printed English Bible), the general task of editing the materials at his disposal, and preparing the marginal notes collected from various sources. These are often cited as the first original English language commentary on the Bible. Rogers also contributed the Song of Manasses in the Apocrypha, which he found in a French Bible printed in 1535. His work was largely used by those who prepared the Great Bible (1539–40), and this eventually led to the Bishops&#x27; Bible (1568) and the King James Version.

Rogers matriculated at the University of Wittenberg on 25 November 1540, where he remained for three years, becoming a close friend of Philipp Melanchthon and other leading figures of the early Protestant Reformation. On leaving Wittenberg he spent four and a half years as a superintendent of a Lutheran church in Meldorf, Dithmarschen, near the mouth of the River Elbe in the north of Germany.

Rogers returned to England in 1548, where he published a translation of Philipp Melanchthon&#x27;s &quot;Considerations of the Augsburg Interim&quot;.

In 1550 he was presented to the crown livings of St Margaret Moses and St Sepulchre in London, and in 1551 was made a prebendary of St. Paul&#x27;s, where the dean and chapter soon appointed him divinity lecturer. He courageously denounced the greed shown by certain courtiers with reference to the property of the suppressed monasteries and defended himself before the privy council. He also declined to wear the prescribed vestments, donning instead a simple round cap. On the accession of Mary he preached at Paul&#x27;s Cross commending the &quot;true doctrine taught in King Edward&#x27;s days,&quot; and warning his hearers against &quot;pestilent Popery, idolatry and superstition.&quot; Defamatory pamphlets littered the streets exhorting Protestants to take up arms against Mary Tudor. &#x27;Nobles and gentlemen favouring the word of God&#x27; were asked to overthrow the &#x27;detestable papists&#x27;, especially &#x27;the great devil&#x27;, Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester. A number of leading Protestant figures, including John Rogers, were arrested and leading reformist bishops such as John Hooper and Hugh Latimer were imprisoned weeks later. Thomas Cranmer was sent to the Tower for his role in Lady Jane&#x27;s attempted coup.

Rogers was also against radical Protestants. After Joan of Kent was imprisoned in 1548 and convicted in April 1549, John Foxe, one of the few Protestants opposed to burnings, approached Rogers to intervene to save Joan, but he refused with the comment that burning was &quot;sufficiently mild&quot; for a crime as grave as heresy.

===Imprisonment and execution===
On 16 August 1553 he was summoned before the council and bidden to keep within his own house. His emoluments were taken away and his prebend was filled in October. In January 1554, Bonner, the new Bishop of London, sent him to Newgate Prison, where he lay with John Hooper, Laurence Saunders, John Bradford and others for a year. Their petitions, whether for less rigorous treatment or for the opportunity of stating their case, were disregarded. In December 1554, Parliament re-enacted the penal statutes against Lollards, and on 22 January 1555, two days after they took effect, Rogers (with ten other people) came before the council at Gardiner&#x27;s house in Southwark, and defended himself in the examination that took place. On 28 and 29 January he came before the commission appointed by Cardinal Pole, and was sentenced to death by Gardiner for heretically denying the Christian character of the Church of Rome and the real presence in the sacrament. He awaited and met death cheerfully, though he was even denied a meeting with his wife. Shortly before the execution, Rogers was offered a pardon if he were to recant but he refused. He was burned at the stake on 4 February 1555 at Smithfield. Bishop Thomas Cranmer, who had encouraged the Matthew Bible, was executed in 1556 also by Queen Mary I of England.

Antoine de Noailles, the French ambassador, said in a letter that Rogers&#x27; death confirmed the alliance between the Pope and England. He also spoke of the support given to Rogers by the greatest part of the people: &quot;even his children assisted at it, comforting him in such a manner that it seemed as if he had been led to a wedding.&quot;

A bust in his memory was erected at St John&#x27;s Church, Deritend in Birmingham in 1853, by public subscription; the church was demolished in 1947.

==John Rogers, Vicar of St. Sepulchre&#x27;s, and Reader of St. Paul&#x27;s, London==
The quotation that follows is from &quot;Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs&quot;, Chapter 16. It is included here because of its historical significance, being the vehicle by which the story of Rev. John Rogers has been most widely disseminated.

John Rogers was educated at Cambridge, and was afterward many years chaplain to the merchant adventurers at Antwerp in Brabant. Here he met with the celebrated martyr William Tyndale, and Miles Coverdale, both voluntary exiles from their country for their aversion to popish superstition and idolatry. They were the instruments of his conversion; and he united with them in that translation of the Bible into English, entitled &quot;The Translation of Thomas Matthew.&quot; From the Scriptures he knew that unlawful vows may be lawfully broken; hence he married, and removed to Wittenberg in Saxony, for the improvement of learning; and he there learned the Dutch language, and received the charge of a congregation, which he faithfully executed for many years. On King Edward&#x27;s accession, he left Saxony to promote the work of reformation in England; and, after some time, Nicholas Ridley, then bishop of London, gave him a prebend in St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, and the dean and chapter appointed him reader of the divinity lesson there. Here he continued until Queen Mary&#x27;s succession to the throne, when the Gospel and true religion were banished, and the Antichrist of Rome, with his superstition and idolatry, introduced.

The circumstance of Mr. Rogers having preached at Paul&#x27;s cross, after Queen Mary arrived at the Tower, has been already stated. He confirmed in his sermon the true doctrine taught in King Edward&#x27;s time, and exhorted the people to beware of the pestilence of popery, idolatry, and superstition. For this he was called to account, but so ably defended himself that, for that time, he was dismissed. The proclamation of the queen, however, to prohibit true preaching, gave his enemies a new handle against him. Hence he was again summoned before the council, and commanded to keep to his house. He did so, though he might have escaped; and though he perceived the state of the true religion to be desperate. He knew he could not want a living in Germany; and he could not forget a wife and ten children, and to seek means to succor them. But all these things were insufficient to induce him to depart, and, when once called to answer in Christ&#x27;s cause, he stoutly defended it, and hazarded his life for that purpose.

After long imprisonment in his own house, the restless Bonner, bishop of London, caused him to be committed to Newgate, there to be lodged among thieves and murderers.

After Mr. Rogers had been long and straitly imprisoned, and lodged in Newgate among thieves, often examined, and very uncharitably entreated, and at length unjustly and most cruelly condemned by Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, the fourth day of February, in the year of our Lord 1555, being Monday in the morning, he was suddenly warned by the keeper of Newgate&#x27;s wife, to prepare himself for the fire; who, being then sound asleep, could scarce be awaked. At length being raised and awaked, and bid to make haste, then said he, &quot;If it be so, I need not tie my points.&quot; And so was had down, first to bishop Bonner to be degraded: which being done, he craved of Bonner but one petition; and Bonner asked what that should be. Mr. Rogers replied that he might speak a few words with his wife before his burning, but that could not be obtained of him.

When the time came that he should be brought out of Newgate to Smithfield, the place of his execution, Mr. Woodroofe, one of the sheriffs, first came to Mr. Rogers, and asked him if he would revoke his abominable doctrine, and the evil opinion of the Sacrament of the altar. Mr. Rogers answered, &quot;That which I have preached I will seal with my blood.&quot; Then Mr. Woodroofe said, &quot;Thou art an heretic.&quot; &quot;That shall be known,&quot; quoth Mr. Rogers, &quot;at the Day of Judgment.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; said Mr. Woodroofe, &quot;I will never pray for thee.&quot; &quot;But I will pray for you,&quot; said Mr. Rogers; and so was brought the same day, the fourth of February, by the sheriffs, towards Smithfield, saying the Psalm Miserere by the way, all the people wonderfully rejoicing at his constancy; with great praises and thanks to God for the same. And there in the presence of Mr. Rochester, comptroller of the queen&#x27;s household, Sir Richard Southwell, both the sheriffs, and a great number of people, he was burnt to ashes, washing his hands in the flame as he was burning. A little before his burning, his pardon was brought, if he would have recanted; but he utterly refused it. He was the first martyr of all the blessed company that suffered in Queen Mary&#x27;s time that gave the first adventure upon the fire. His wife and children, being eleven in number, ten able to go, and one sucking at her breast, met him by the way, as he went towards Smithfield. This sorrowful sight of his own flesh and blood could nothing move him, but that he constantly and cheerfully took his death with wonderful patience, in the defence and quarrel of the Gospel of Christ.

<doc id="159687" wikidata="Q1944854" url="?curid=159687" title="The Presidents of the United States of America (album)">
<text>The Presidents of the United States of America is the debut studio album by the American alternative rock band The Presidents of the United States of America, released on March 10, 1995, via PopLlama Records. Columbia Records signed the band shortly after its release to handle increased distribution for the album.

Released during the grunge and punk music breakthrough-era, the album produced four singles—&quot;Kitty&quot;, &quot;Lump&quot;, &quot;Peaches&quot; and &quot;Dune Buggy&quot;—that helped the group gain mainstream popularity, and &quot;Lump&quot; can be found on the band&#x27;s 2000 compilation album with the same title. &quot;The Presidents of the United States of America&quot; received positive reviews, and has been certified triple Platinum by the RIAA.

==Background and recording==
Chris Ballew and Dave Dederer met while attending The Bush School in Seattle. In the 1980s and early 1990s they collaborated on various musical projects. Ballew returned to Seattle in the summer of 1993, and he and Dederer formed what would become The Presidents of the United States of America that autumn. Initially a drummerless duo, they performed a half-dozen or so shows in late 1993 as &quot;The Lo-Fis&quot;, &quot;The Dynamic Duo&quot;, and &quot;Pure Frosting.&quot; Ballew eventually came upon the name &quot;The Presidents of the United States of America.&quot; Shortly after settling on their name, Ballew and Dederer added drummer Jason Finn. In early December 1993, the band played their first show as a trio at The Romper Room in Seattle. At the time, Finn was also the drummer in the band Love Battery, who had recently changed record labels from Sub Pop to Atlas Records, an A&amp;M subsidiary.

In early 1994, The Presidents recorded a 10-song cassette, &quot;Froggystyle,&quot; at Laundry Room Studios. The band sold the cassette at shows in 1994. Finn also sold the cassette from behind the bar of Seattle&#x27;s legendary Comet Tavern, where he tended bar.

In 1994, the Presidents signed with the tiny Seattle label PopLlama Records and released their self-titled debut in the following year, featuring several remixed tracks from &quot;Froggystyle&quot;. The band also released a limited edition blue vinyl 7-inch single, &quot;Fuck California&quot;, on C/Z Records. Columbia Records signed the band shortly thereafter and re-released the album in late July 1995. Driven by the singles &quot;Lump&quot;, &quot;Peaches&quot;, and &quot;Kitty&quot;, their debut album proved to be a smash, eventually selling over three million copies.

==Composition==
Critics praised the band&#x27;s catchy, humorous, and self-deprecating songs, which were a major departure from the grunge/post-grunge sound present on the airwaves. The album received Grammy nominations in 1995 and 1996. Though &quot;Peaches&quot; met the most critical success, the band credits &quot;Lump&quot; as their favorite single. The song&#x27;s strange lyrics came from a dream that Ballew had while fighting pneumonia. The antibiotics he was taking caused an allergic reaction that produced several consecutive nights of wild and crazy dreams. The lyrics for &quot;Peaches&quot; were written about a crush Ballew used to have on a girl. According to him, she had a peach tree in the front of her yard, and when he finally summoned the courage to go talk to her, he stood under the tree and smashed peaches in his fist until he decided not to talk to her.

==Packaging and release==
Originally, the album was released in March 1995 on the independent Seattle label, PopLlama Records. This version of the album was noticeably different than other subsequent releases. The inside cover featured a picture of the band with Bill Clinton, who was the president of the United States at the time. The CD looked like a food inspection stamp. &quot;Feather Pluckn&quot; included a verse which was an homage of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Feeling&quot;. The PopLlama release was also pressed on yellow vinyl with two bonus tracks. After the band signed to Columbia Records, the album was re-released on July 25, 1995. This version&#x27;s inside cover featured a picture of the band members painted in red, white and blue in multiple pictures. The CD looks like a vinyl record label. All of the songs were re-mixed, and &quot;Feather Pluckn&quot; lost the &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Feeling&quot; verse. 

In 2004, the band independently re-released the album as a &quot;Ten Year Super Bonus Special Anniversary Edition&quot;. It featured 13 bonus tracks, including B-sides and demos, and (except for the Australian release) a bonus DVD of music videos and performance footage. This version features the food inspection stamp-like design that originally appeared on the 1995 edition. The insert picture features a collage of band performances. In addition, the liner notes were slightly updated. In 2008, the album was re-released on CD for a final time by the band&#x27;s then-current label, Fugitive Recordings, minus the bonus tracks.

In February 2020, the group announced a vinyl reissue via Kickstarter.

==Reception==

===Commercial performance===
&quot;The Presidents of the United States of America&quot; peaked at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. As of 1997, the album has shipped over three million copies and has been certified triple platinum.

===Critical reception===
Critical reception to &quot;The Presidents of the United States of America&quot; was mostly positive. Johnny Loftus of AllMusic retrospectively wrote that &quot;their quirky take on punk-pop did help expand the palette of MTV and alternative radio, and make their oddball singles part of the enduring sound of the era.&quot;

==Track listing==

Ten Year Super Bonus Special Anniversary Edition bonus tracks

14–17 also appear on various editions of the &quot;Peaches&quot; single. 20–24 and 26 are performed entirely by Chris Ballew.&lt;br&gt;

<doc id="159695" wikidata="Q2103034" url="?curid=159695" title="Polynomial-time reduction">
<text>In computational complexity theory, a polynomial-time reduction is a method for solving one problem using another. One shows that if a hypothetical subroutine solving the second problem exists, then the first problem can be solved by transforming or reducing it to inputs for the second problem and calling the subroutine one or more times. If both the time required to transform the first problem to the second, and the number of times the subroutine is called is polynomial, then the first problem is polynomial-time reducible to the second.

A polynomial-time reduction proves that the first problem is no more difficult than the second one, because whenever an efficient algorithm exists for the second problem, one exists for the first problem as well. By contraposition, if no efficient algorithm exists for the first problem, none exists for the second either. Polynomial-time reductions are frequently used in complexity theory for defining both complexity classes and complete problems for those classes.

==Types of reductions==
The three most common types of polynomial-time reduction, from the most to the least restrictive, are polynomial-time many-one reductions, truth-table reductions, and Turing reductions. The most frequently used of these are the many-one reductions, and in some cases the phrase &quot;polynomial-time reduction&quot; may be used to mean a polynomial-time many-one reduction. The most general reductions are the Turing reductions and the most restrictive are the many-one reductions with truth-table reductions occupying the space in between.

===Many-one reductions===
A polynomial-time many-one reduction from a problem &quot;A&quot; to a problem &quot;B&quot; (both of which are usually required to be decision problems) is a polynomial-time algorithm for transforming inputs to problem &quot;A&quot; into inputs to problem &quot;B&quot;, such that the transformed problem has the same output as the original problem. An instance &quot;x&quot; of problem &quot;A&quot; can be solved by applying this transformation to produce an instance &quot;y&quot; of problem &quot;B&quot;, giving &quot;y&quot; as the input to an algorithm for problem &quot;B&quot;, and returning its output. Polynomial-time many-one reductions may also be known as polynomial transformations or Karp reductions, named after Richard Karp. A reduction of this type is denoted by formula_1 or formula_2.

===Truth-table reductions===
A polynomial-time truth-table reduction from a problem &quot;A&quot; to a problem &quot;B&quot; (both decision problems) is a polynomial time algorithm for transforming inputs to problem &quot;A&quot; into a fixed number of inputs to problem &quot;B&quot;, such that the output for the original problem can be expressed as a function of the outputs for &quot;B&quot;. The function that maps outputs for &quot;B&quot; into the output for &quot;A&quot; must be the same for all inputs, so that it can be expressed by a truth table. A reduction of this type may be denoted by the expression formula_3.

===Turing reductions===
A polynomial-time Turing reduction from a problem &quot;A&quot; to a problem &quot;B&quot; is an algorithm that solves problem &quot;A&quot; using a polynomial number of calls to a subroutine for problem &quot;B&quot;, and polynomial time outside of those subroutine calls. Polynomial-time Turing reductions are also known as Cook reductions, named after Stephen Cook. A reduction of this type may be denoted by the expression formula_4. Many-one reductions can be regarded as restricted variants of Turing reductions where the number of calls made to the subroutine for problem &quot;B&quot; is exactly one and the value returned by the reduction is the same value as the one returned by the subroutine.

==Completeness==
A complete problem for a given complexity class C and reduction ≤ is a problem &quot;P&quot; that belongs to C, such that every problem &quot;A&quot; in C has a reduction &quot;A&quot; ≤ &quot;P&quot;. For instance, a problem is NP-complete if it belongs to NP and all problems in NP have polynomial-time many-one reductions to it. A problem that belongs to NP can be proven to be NP-complete by finding a single polynomial-time many-one reduction to it from a known NP-complete problem. Polynomial-time many-one reductions have been used to define complete problems for other complexity classes, including the PSPACE-complete languages and EXPTIME-complete languages.

Every decision problem in P (the class of polynomial-time decision problems) may be reduced to every other nontrivial decision problem (where nontrivial means that not every input has the same output), by a polynomial-time many-one reduction. To transform an instance of problem &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;, solve &quot;A&quot; in polynomial time, and then use the solution to choose one of two instances of problem &quot;B&quot; with different answers. Therefore, for complexity classes within P such as L, NL, NC, and P itself, polynomial-time reductions cannot be used to define complete languages: if they were used in this way, every nontrivial problem in P would be complete. Instead, weaker reductions such as log-space reductions or NC reductions are used for defining classes of complete problems for these classes, such as the P-complete problems.

==Defining complexity classes==
The definitions of the complexity classes NP, PSPACE, and EXPTIME do not involve reductions: reductions come into their study only in the definition of complete languages for these classes. However, in some cases a complexity class may be defined by reductions. If &quot;C&quot; is any decision problem, then one can define a complexity class C consisting of the languages &quot;A&quot; for which formula_5. In this case, &quot;C&quot; will automatically be complete for C, but C may have other complete problems as well.

An example of this is the complexity class formula_6 defined from the existential theory of the reals, a computational problem that is known to be NP-hard and in PSPACE, but is not known to be complete for NP, PSPACE, or any language in the polynomial hierarchy. formula_6 is the set of problems having a polynomial-time many-one reduction to the existential theory of the reals; it has several other complete problems such as determining the rectilinear crossing number of an undirected graph. Each problem in formula_6 inherits the property of belonging to PSPACE, and each formula_6-complete problem is NP-hard.

Similarly, the complexity class GI consists of the problems that can be reduced to the graph isomorphism problem. Since graph isomorphism is known to belong both to NP and co-AM, the same is true for every problem in this class. A problem is GI-complete if it is complete for this class; the graph isomorphism problem itself is GI-complete, as are several other related problems.

<text>Pure Frosting is a compilation album by the American alternative rock band The Presidents of the United States of America. It was released on March 10, 1998.

It was, at the time, the band&#x27;s last album, as they had broken up in 1998. They later reunited and released new albums until breaking up again in 2015.

&quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; originally appeared on &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot; soundtrack, and it is a cover of the song originally by Bruce Woolley and popularized by The Buggles. This is the third version of the song The Presidents has released, as they originally released a live version as a b-side, and released a different studio version on &quot;Rarities&quot;. &quot;Man (Opposable Thumb)&quot; originally appeared on the 1997 soundtrack of &quot;Good Burger&quot;. &quot;Cleveland Rocks&quot; is also a cover, originally by Ian Hunter, and was used as the theme song to &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;.

The album takes its title from an early name for the band.

<doc id="159718" wikidata="Q73755" url="?curid=159718" title="Melba toast">
<text>Melba toast is a dry, crisp and thinly sliced rusk, often served with soup and salad or topped with either melted cheese or pâté. It is named after Dame Nellie Melba, the stage name of Australian opera singer Helen Porter Mitchell. Its name is thought to date from 1897, when the singer was very ill and it became a staple of her diet. The toast was created for her by a chef who was also a fan of her, Auguste Escoffier, who also created the Peach Melba dessert for her. The hotel proprietor César Ritz supposedly named it in a conversation with Escoffier.

Melba toast is made by lightly toasting slices of bread under a grill, on both sides. The resulting toast is then sliced laterally. These thin slices are then returned to the grill with the untoasted sides towards the heat source, resulting in toast half the normal thickness.

Melba toast is also available commercially, and was at one time given to infants who were teething as a hard food substance on which to chew. In the UK, this is similar to a commercial product known as &quot;French toast&quot;, although it is very different from the egg-based dish known as French toast internationally.

In France, it is referred to as &quot;croutes en dentelle&quot;.

==History==
In 1925, the Mayo Brothers prescribed the &quot;Eighteen Day Reducing Diet&quot; to Ethel Barrymore. It included Melba toast, which made the toast very popular at the time.

<text>Jewel Kilcher (born May 23, 1974), mononymously known as Jewel, is an American singer-songwriter. She has been nominated for four Grammy Awards and has sold over 30 million albums worldwide as of 2024.

Jewel was raised near Homer, Alaska, where she grew up singing and yodeling as a musical duo with her father, Atz Kilcher, a local musician. At age fifteen, she received a partial scholarship to the Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan, where she studied operatic voice. After graduating, she began writing and performing at clubs and coffeehouses in San Diego, California. Based on local media attention, she was offered a recording contract with Atlantic Records, which released her debut album &quot;Pieces of You&quot; in 1995. One of the best-selling debut albums of all time, it went 12-times platinum. The debut single from the album, &quot;Who Will Save Your Soul&quot;, peaked at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Singles &quot;You Were Meant for Me&quot; and &quot;Foolish Games&quot; reached number two on the Hot 100, and were listed on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s 1997 year-end singles chart, as well as &quot;Billboard&quot;″s 1998 year-end singles chart.

Jewel&#x27;s sophomore effort, &quot;Spirit&quot;, was released in 1998, followed by &quot;This Way&quot; (2001). In 2003, she released &quot;0304&quot;, which marked a departure from her previous folk-oriented records, featuring electronic arrangements and elements of dance-pop. In 2008, she released &quot;Perfectly Clear&quot;, her first country album, which debuted atop &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Country Albums chart and featured three singles, &quot;Stronger Woman&quot;, &quot;I Do&quot;, and &quot;&#x27;Til It Feels Like Cheating&quot;. In 2009, Jewel released her first independent album, &quot;Lullaby&quot;.

In 1998, Jewel released a collection of poetry, and the following year appeared in a supporting role in Ang Lee&#x27;s Western film &quot;Ride with the Devil&quot; (1999) which earned her critical acclaim. In 2021, she won the sixth season of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as the Queen of Hearts.

== Early life ==
Jewel was born May 23, 1974, in Payson, Utah, the second child of Atz Kilcher and Nedra Kilcher ( Carroll). At the time of her birth, her parents had been living in Utah with her elder brother, Shane; her father was attending Brigham Young University. She is a cousin of actress Q&#x27;orianka Kilcher. Her father, originally from Alaska, was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, though the family stopped attending church after her parents&#x27; divorce when she was eight years old. Her paternal grandfather, Yule Kilcher, was a delegate to the Alaska constitutional convention and a state senator who settled in Alaska after emigrating from Switzerland. He was also the first recorded person to cross the Harding Icefield.

Shortly after Jewel&#x27;s birth, her family relocated to Anchorage, Alaska, settling on the Kilcher family&#x27;s homestead. There, her younger brother Atz Jr. was born. She also has a half-brother, Nikos, who was primarily raised in Oregon by his mother, with whom her father had a brief relationship; Jewel would later become close to him in adulthood. After her parents&#x27; divorce in 1981, Jewel lived with her father near Homer, Alaska. The house she grew up in lacked indoor plumbing and had only a simple outhouse. The Jewel family is featured on the Discovery Channel show &quot;&quot;, which chronicles their day-to-day struggles living in the Alaskan wilderness. Recalling her upbringing, she said: 
According to Jewel, the first song she learned to sing was &quot;Saint Louis Blues&quot;. In her youth, Jewel and her father sometimes earned a living by performing music in roadhouses and taverns as a father-daughter musical duo; they also often sang at hotels in Anchorage, including the Hotel Captain Cook and the Hilton Anchorage. It was during this time that Jewel learned to yodel from her father. She would later credit the time she spent in bars as integral to her formative years: &quot;I saw women who would compromise themselves for compliments, for flattery; or men who would run away from themselves by drinking until they ultimately killed themselves.&quot;

At age fifteen, while working at a dance studio in Anchorage, she was referred by the studio instructor to Interlochen Arts Academy in Interlochen, Michigan, where she applied and received a partial scholarship to study operatic voice. Local businesses in her hometown of Homer donated items for auction to help allocate additional funds, and raised a total of $11,000 to pay the remainder of her first year&#x27;s tuition. She subsequently relocated to Michigan to attend Interlochen, where she received classical training, and also learned to play guitar. She began writing songs on guitar at age sixteen. While in school, she would often perform live in coffeehouses. After graduating, she relocated to San Diego, California, where she worked in a coffee shop and as a phone operator at a computer warehouse.

== Music career ==
=== 1993–1997: Beginnings and &quot;Pieces of You&quot; ===

For a time, Jewel lived in her car while traveling around the country doing street performances and small gigs, mainly in Southern California. She gained recognition by singing at the Inner Change Cafe and Java Joe&#x27;s in San Diego. Her friend Steve Poltz&#x27;s band, the Rugburns, played the same venues. She later collaborated with Poltz on some of her songs, including &quot;You Were Meant for Me&quot;. (He also appeared in the song&#x27;s second, better-known video.) The Rugburns opened for Jewel on her Tiny Lights tour in 1997. Poltz appeared in Jewel&#x27;s band on the Spirit World Tour 1999 playing guitar.

Jewel was discovered by Inga Vainshtein in 1993 when John Hogan, lead singer from the local San Diego band Rust, whom Vainshtein was managing, called to tell her about a girl surfer who sang at a local coffee shop on Thursdays. Vainshtein drove to The Inner Change with a representative of Atlantic Records, and after the show called Danny Goldberg, the head of Atlantic Record&#x27;s West Coast operations, and asked him to pay for her demo, since at the time she was living in a van and lacked the means to record any of her own music. Vainshtein, who at the time was working as a Vice President of Productions at Paramount, went on to become her manager and was instrumental in creating a major bidding war that led to her deal with Atlantic Records. She continued to manage Jewel until the end of the first album cycle and shaped the path of the first five years of Jewel&#x27;s career.

Jewel&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Pieces of You,&quot; was released in 1995 when she was 21 years old. Recorded in a studio on singer Neil Young&#x27;s ranch, it included Young&#x27;s backing band, the Stray Gators, who played on his &quot;Harvest&quot; and &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; albums. Part of the album was recorded live at the Inner Change Cafe in San Diego, where Jewel had risen to local fame. The album stayed on the Billboard 200 for two years, reaching number four at its peak. The album spawned the Top 10 hits &quot;You Were Meant for Me&quot;, &quot;Who Will Save Your Soul&quot;, and &quot;Foolish Games&quot;. To promote the album, she toured as the opening act for Bauhaus frontman Peter Murphy on his 1995 North American tour in support of his album &quot;Cascade&quot;. &quot;Pieces of You&quot; eventually sold over 12 million copies in the United States alone.

In the late 1990s, Mike Connell created an electronic mailing list for fans, known as &quot;Everyday Angels&quot;. Although Jewel does not subscribe to this mailing list, she maintained communication with her EDA fans. On July 18 and 19, 1996, she gave a two-day concert known as &quot;JewelStock&quot; at the Bearsville Theatre. Jewel allowed the concert to be taped, and fans circulated the concert without profit.

=== 1998–2002: &quot;Spirit&quot; and other ventures ===

Jewel was chosen to sing the American national anthem at the opening of Super Bowl XXXII in January 1998 in San Diego. She was introduced as &quot;San Diego&#x27;s own Jewel!&quot; but criticized for lip syncing the anthem to a digitally-recorded track of her own voice. This was especially noticeable due to her missing her cue and not mouthing the first words. Super Bowl producers have since admitted that they attempt to have all performers pre-record their vocals. She performed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; again in the 2003 NBA Finals in one of the New Jersey Nets&#x27; home games.
Jewel&#x27;s second studio album, which she titled &quot;Spirit,&quot; was released on November 17, 1998. The album debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200 with 368,000 copies sold in its first week. It eventually sold 3.7 million units in the United States. Its lead single, &quot;Hands&quot;, peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Other singles followed, including a new version of &quot;Jupiter (Swallow the Moon)&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Simple Is True&quot;, which she meant to be the theme song to her upcoming movie, and the charity single &quot;Life Uncommon&quot;. Shortly after the release of &quot;Spirit,&quot; Jewel made her acting debut playing the character Sue Lee Shelley in Ang Lee&#x27;s Western film &quot;Ride with the Devil&quot; (1999), opposite Tobey Maguire. The film received mixed-positive reviews, though critic Roger Ebert praised her performance, writing: &quot;Jewel deserves praise for, quite simply, performing her character in a convincing and unmannered way. She is an actress here, not a pop star trying out a new hobby.&quot;

In November 1999, Jewel released &quot;.&quot; The album sold over a million copies and peaked at No. 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. She released a cover of &quot;Joy to the World&quot; from the album as a single. In 2000, she completed an autobiography titled &quot;Chasing Down the Dawn,&quot; a collection of diary entries and musings detailing her life growing up in Alaska, her struggle to learn her craft, and life on the road. In November 2001, her fourth studio album, &quot;This Way,&quot; was released. The album peaked at No. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold over 1.5 million copies in the U.S. A song from the album &quot;Standing Still&quot; hit the Top 30. Other singles released were &quot;Break Me&quot;, &quot;This Way&quot;, and &quot;Serve the Ego&quot;; this last gave Jewel her first number one club hit.

=== 2003–2006: &quot;0304&quot; and &quot;Goodbye Alice in Wonderland&quot; ===

In June 2003, Jewel released her fifth studio album, titled &quot;0304&quot;. The album was promoted by its lead single, &quot;Intuition&quot;, which reached No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Pop Songs chart and No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. Within two months of its release, the album had sold over 350,000 in the United States. The shift in musical style on &quot;0304&quot; was noted by several critics, with &quot;People&quot; deeming it &quot;an extreme musical makeover.&quot; In response, Jewel commented that she had been inspired to make a more upbeat-sounding record in light of the Iraq War: &quot;I knew we were headed to war [at the time]... The music that has always done well during wartime has always been music that makes you want to escape.&quot; In his review of the album, Alexis Petridis of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote &quot;It&#x27;s the most dramatic image overhaul you&#x27;re ever likely to see&quot;. Both &quot;Intuition&quot; and its follow-up single &quot;Stand&quot; were number one hits on the Dance Club Songs chart.

On May 2, 2006, Jewel released her sixth studio album, &quot;Goodbye Alice in Wonderland&quot;. The album debuted at No. 8 on the Billboard Albums Chart and sold 82,000 copies in its first week. The lead single &quot;Again and Again&quot; peaked at No. 16 on Adult Top 40 Radio. The second single &quot;Good Day&quot; was released to radio in late June and peaked at No. 30 on the Adult Pop Songs charts. In the album&#x27;s liner notes, Jewel described &quot;Goodbye Alice in Wonderland&quot; as &quot;the story of my life&quot; and &quot;the most autobiographical album I have made since &quot;Pieces of You.&quot;&quot;

To promote the album, a music video for &quot;Stephenville, TX&quot;, Jewel&#x27;s next single, was shown on &quot;Yahoo! Launch&quot;. After a photo shoot at her Texas ranch, Jewel spontaneously decided to have photographer Kurt Markus shoot the music video for the song &quot;Goodbye Alice in Wonderland&quot;.

=== 2007–2008: Label shift and &quot;Perfectly Clear&quot; ===

Jewel released a video for &quot;Quest for Love&quot;, the lead single from the movie &quot;Arthur and the Invisibles&quot;, recorded in 2006; the song is only available on the soundtrack for the film, which was released in January 2007. In early February 2007 Jewel recorded a duet with Jason Michael Carroll, &quot;No Good in Goodbye&quot;, that was featured on Carroll&#x27;s debut CD, &quot;Waitin&#x27; in the Country&quot;. She also made a promotional appearance on the T in Boston for the Verizon Yellow Pages, playing songs on a moving subway car and then doing an hour-long acoustic concert in South Station.

In a 2007 interview with &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, Jewel stated that she was no longer affiliated with a record label, confirming rumors that Atlantic Records had failed to renew her contract after the lackluster sales of her then-latest album. She also hinted that she would like to do a country album next. She worked with John Rich of Big &amp; Rich fame, who said that she was &quot;probably one of the greatest American singer-songwriters we have had.&quot; He also said that &quot;every label in Nashville&quot; was talking to her at the time.

In November 2007, Jewel was signed to Valory Records, a newly formed division of the independent Big Machine Records label. Her first country album, &quot;Perfectly Clear&quot;, was released on June 3, 2008, selling 48,000 units in its first week. It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Country Album Chart and No. 8 on the Billboard 200 Album Chart. In its second week on the charts, the album dropped to No. 25 on the Billboard 200 and No. 5 on the Country Albums chart, with estimated second week sales of 75,000 units. Jewel made her second film appearance in a cameo, appearing as herself in the comedy film &quot;Walk Hard&quot;, released in December 2007.

Approximately a month later, &quot;Stronger Woman&quot;, the lead single from &quot;Perfectly Clear&quot;, was released to country radio on January 17, 2008, and entered the Top 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts. On April 26, 2008, it peaked at No. 13. The next single, &quot;I Do&quot;, was released to radio on June 23, 2008. The video for the single featured her cowboy then-husband, Ty Murray. This song peaked at No. 28. Following it was &quot;&#x27;Til It Feels Like Cheating&quot;, which peaked at No. 57. &quot;Perfectly Clear&quot; was released in Australia in late May 2009. It was then released across Europe by Humphead Records in June 2009.

=== 2009–2013: &quot;Lullaby&quot; and other releases ===

In early 2009, it was announced that Jewel would release a new studio album titled &quot;Lullaby&quot;, a collection of lullabies which she described as &quot;not just for children, but also adults&quot;. Its lead single, &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&quot;, was released on iTunes on March 17, 2009. The album was released on May 5, 2009. &quot;Somewhere Over The Rainbow&quot; was No.1 on The Top Children&#x27;s Songs the week of release. Like 2011&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Goes &#x27;Round&quot;, it is sold under the Fisher Price brand which Jewel described as &quot;a great partnership&quot;.

Jewel also recorded the &quot;Make It Last&quot; with R&amp;B singer Tyrese in conjunction with the release of his comic book &quot;Mayhem!&quot;. It was intended to be used for the soundtrack to &quot;&quot; but did not appear on the final track listing.

In January 2010, Jewel released &quot;Stay Here Forever&quot;, from the soundtrack to the film &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot;. It also served as the lead-off single to Jewel&#x27;s ninth studio album &quot;Sweet and Wild&quot; released on June 8, 2010. The single debuted at No. 48 on the Hot Country Songs chart and reached No. 34 in May 2010. &quot;Satisfied&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single on May 17, 2010, reaching its highest peak of No. 57. On October 10, 2010, Jewel released the third single from &quot;Sweet and Wild&quot;, &quot;Ten&quot;. It made its debut on the Hot Country Songs Chart at No. 55 on the week of October 15, 2010, and peaked at No. 51 two weeks later.

Jewel&#x27;s second children&#x27;s album, &quot;The Merry Goes &#x27;Round&quot;, was released in August 2011. Like 2009&#x27;s &quot;Lullaby&quot;, it is sold under the Fisher-Price brand. In June 2012, Jewel was cast in the lead role as June Carter Cash in the Lifetime original movie &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, opposite Matt Ross. Brian Lowry of &quot;Variety&quot; commended Jewel&#x27;s live singing in the film, and noted: &quot;Jewel and Ross are convincing as the central couple, playing them over an extended span.&quot; On October 16, 2012, Jewel announced via Twitter a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album would be released in 2013. The album features new duets from Kelly Clarkson and the Pistol Annies. Jewel and Clarkson recorded a fresh rendition of Jewel&#x27;s song &quot;Foolish Games&quot; while Jewel and the Pistol Annies recut &quot;You Were Meant for Me&quot;. The &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album was released February 5, 2013.

On August 6, 2013, Jewel announced the release of her second Christmas album, titled &quot;Let It Snow: A Holiday Collection&quot;, scheduled for release on November 12, 2013. In an interview with &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Jewel was quoted as saying &quot;I wanted this record to have a resemblance to the first album. It&#x27;s a continuation of mood and spirit of that record, with the mood and feel of the album artwork with an image and tone that evokes that spirit.&quot;

=== 2014–2018: &quot;Picking Up the Pieces&quot; ===
In February 2014, Jewel began work on her next album and confirmed that it will not be released by a major record label, and that she was producing it herself. In April 2015, she appeared as a guest musician on Blues Traveler&#x27;s album &quot;Blow Up the Moon&quot;, co-writing the song &quot;Hearts Still Awake&quot;. On June 28, she revealed in a Q&amp;A on Facebook that her upcoming album would be released in the second week of September of that year, and would feature a folk sound recorded with a live band. On July 21, Jewel confirmed the title as &quot;Picking Up the Pieces&quot;. &quot;Picking Up the Pieces&quot; was released on September 11, 2015. Four days later, on September 15, she released her third book, a new memoir entitled &quot;Never Broken: Songs Are Only Half the Story&quot;.

In 2016, Jewel was featured in the &quot;Comedy Central Roast of Rob Lowe&quot;, having previously met the actor when she was supposed to co-star with him in &quot;The Lyon&#x27;s Den&quot;. During the &quot;Roast&quot;, Jewel performed a parody of &quot;You Were Meant for Me&quot; claiming she was the 16-year-old caught having sex with Lowe in a 1988 videotape. Also in 2016, Jewel founded Jewel Inc., a platform for her work in music, TV, and film, as well as her entrepreneurial endeavors—in particular regarding mindfulness. Among its ventures was co-creating in partnership with Trevor Drinkwater the Wellness Your Way, Music and Wellness Festival, held originally in 2018 in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 2017, she returned to acting, starring in the &quot;Fixer Upper Mysteries&quot; on the Hallmark Channel.

=== 2019–present: &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; and &quot;Freewheelin&#x27; Woman&quot; ===
Towards the end of 2019, Jewel released a new song &quot;No More Tears&quot;, which was written and recorded for &quot;Lost in America&quot;, a documentary about youth homelessness in America by Rotimi Rainwater. In an interview with &quot;American Songwriter&quot;, Jewel explained that, in addition to being an executive producer on the documentary, she was inspired to write the track because she was moved by the stories of the individuals featured in the film and related those to her own experiences of being homeless when she was eighteen. In the same interview, it was confirmed that &quot;No More Tears&quot; would also be the first track released from her upcoming album which she hoped to release sometime in 2020.

In 2021, Jewel competed in season six of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Queen of Hearts&quot;. Jewel made her way to the finals, where she was declared the winner of season six on December 16, 2021. She was rewarded the golden mask trophy after her encore performance. After her performance of &quot;River&quot;, judge Jenny McCarthy called her the greatest artist that they&#x27;ve ever had on the show. Jewel and her son performed a duet of her song &quot;Hands&quot; on &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; &quot;Christmas Singalong&quot;, aired on Fox on December 22, 2021. Jewel subsequently released a cover EP titled &quot;Queen of Hearts&quot; containing covers of the songs she performed on &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;.

In March 2022, it was announced that Jewel would represent Alaska in the inaugural American Song Contest, set to begin later in the month. She performed &quot;The Story&quot; in the third episode and scored well in the public vote, but her overall score was brought down by a lower jury ranking which narrowly cost Jewel a place in the semi-finals.

Jewel&#x27;s thirteenth studio album, &quot;Freewheelin&#x27; Woman&quot;, was released on April 15, 2022, via her own label, Words Matter Media. The album was co-produced by Jewel and Butch Walker and was developed with the intention for Jewel to create music that she felt connected to and excited about rather than creating in order to meet expectations.

On February 19, 2023, Jewel performed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at the NBA All-Star Game in Salt Lake City, Utah.

On May 28, 2023, Jewel performed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at the Indy 500 in Speedway, Indiana.

On April 9, 2024, Jewel joined Olivia Rodrigo to perform &quot;You Were Meant for Me&quot; at her fourth show at Madison Square Garden for her Guts World Tour.

== Artistry ==

Jewel is a soprano. Caitlin Gibson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described Jewel&#x27;s vocal versatility, stating that &quot;she can summon many voices—deep and powerful, girlish and sweet, piercing and agile.&quot; Gibson also commented about Jewel&#x27;s debut; &quot;In an era still gripped by grunge, [she] climbed to the top of the pop charts with sweet, simple folk tunes&quot;. Her fifth studio album &quot;0304&quot; (2003) was a departure from her previous folk rock-oriented albums and incorporates a more general pop sound. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote about &quot;0304&quot;, describing it as &quot;A record that (is) lyric-driven, like Cole Porter stuff, that also has a lot of swing... that combined dance, urban, and folk music. [...] [it is] an original-sounding album, something with more imagination than the average dance-pop record. Better still, it sounds more authentic (and boasts a better set of songs) than her previous records, which were either too ramshackle or too self-serious and doggedly somber to really reveal much character.&quot; &quot;Perfectly Clear&quot; (2008) was influenced by her appreciation for country music, while &quot;Picking Up The Pieces&quot; (2015) saw Jewel &quot;going back to [her] folk/American roots that [she] began with.&quot;

Owning a wide variety of Taylor Guitars, Jewel uses a Taylor 912-C most often. &quot;Acoustic Guitar&quot; writer Jeffery Pepper Rodgers called the guitar her &quot;steady companion&quot;. All of her guitars are strung with D&#x27;Addario products. To strum, she employs a unique self-created fingerpicking technique or a hard pick.

==Other work==

=== Literary works ===
In 1998, Jewel published a book of poetry titled &quot;A Night Without Armor.&quot; Although it sold over 1 million copies and was a &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller, it received mixed reviews. During an MTV interview in 1998, Kurt Loder pointed out the incorrect usage, in her book of poetry, of the word &quot;&quot; (instead of the intended &quot;casualness&quot;) to which Jewel responded, &quot;You&#x27;re a smartass for pointing that out. Next topic.&quot; In the fall of 1998, the poet Beau Sia composed a book-length response to &quot;A Night Without Armor&quot; that he titled &quot;A Night Without Armor II: The Revenge.&quot; The reviewer Edna Gundersen, writing in &quot;USA Today,&quot; noted, &quot;Hers is flowery and sensitive. His is wry and absurd.&quot;

In 2000, Jewel published a biographical book called &quot;Chasing Down the Dawn&quot; In 2012, Jewel published the children&#x27;s book &quot;That&#x27;s What I&#x27;d Do&quot;. In 2013, Jewel published the children&#x27;s book &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;. In 2015, Jewel published her memoirs under the title &quot;Never Broken: Songs Are Only Half the Story&quot;.

=== Art World Projects ===
In 2024, Jewel created a museum-wide show at the Crystal Bridges Museum in Bentonville, Arkansas called &quot;The Portal: An Art Experience by Jewel&quot;. The show featured her own paintings, a special music and technology installation, and art works from the museum&#x27;s collection including, Mickalene Thomas, Ruth Asawa, Julie Mehretu, and Alma Thomas. The show is organized around Jewel&#x27;s idea of “Three Spheres,” or realms, of human existence: the inner world, the outer world, and the unseen world.

Utilizing new technology alongside the traditional painting techniques in &quot;The Portal&quot;, Jewel choreographed a drone light show in partnership with Nova Sky Stories, which accompanies a new song. Jewel also partnered with the company Proto to present a hologram of her self welcoming visitors and performing songs.

=== Humanitarian activism ===
Jewel formed the nonprofit organization Higher Ground for Humanity along with her mother, Lenedra J. Carroll, and Jewel&#x27;s older brother, Shane Jewel. The organization&#x27;s focus is education, sustainable improvements, and building alliances with like-minded organizations. Jewel donates a portion of her income to the organization and often holds events to benefit the organization. The organization tends to parallel Jewel&#x27;s career since she provides the majority of the organization&#x27;s funding. , the activities of the organization were concluded. One early grantee was the Global Youth Action Network, which has become one of the largest youth movements around the United Nations.

In September 2006, as part of Lifetime&#x27;s &quot;Stop Breast Cancer for Life&quot; campaign, Jewel delivered more than 12 million petition signatures to Capitol Hill, urging Congress to pass the bipartisan Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act of 2005 (S 910/HR1849). The bill would ban the practice of &quot;drive-through&quot; mastectomies, when women are discharged from the hospital just hours after their surgeries. Jewel served as the honorary chairperson of the 2006 &quot;Help the Homeless Walk&quot; in Washington, D.C.

In November 2008, Jewel began work on a project with several dozen singer-songwriters to write and auction their lyrics with donations benefiting her &quot;Project Clean Water&quot; charity. Many singers and songwriters besides herself have donated their written lyrics including Patrick Davis, Alabama&#x27;s Randy Owen, John Mellencamp, Jason Mraz, Gretchen Wilson, and Marv Green. The majority of the lyrics were written on paper and signed by the songwriter, with the exception of Katy Perry&#x27;s &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot;. Many of the artists in addition to writing and signing lyrics, drew pictures to illustrate their lyrics. The auction ran from December 1, 2008, to December 18, 2008, promoted by CMT and Virgin Music. Some of the lyrics that were up for auction included hits such as &quot;So Small&quot;, &quot;Foolish Games&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Yours&quot;, &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot;, &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire (Man in Motion)&quot;, &quot;Live Like You Were Dying&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Need a Man&quot;, &quot;Superman (It&#x27;s Not Easy)&quot; and &quot;Redneck Woman&quot;. The highest bought lyrics being Jewel&#x27;s signature song &quot;You Were Meant For Me&quot; sold for US$1,505, and &quot;Who Will Save Your Soul&quot; and &quot;Hands&quot;, raising more than $1,005 each. Jewel promised that all items sold by December 18 would be delivered by Christmas. After the majority of the auctions ended on December 18 two new lyrics by Craig Wiseman and Ernie Ashworth were put up for auction ending in January 2009.

In May 2013, Jewel served as ambassador for the ReThink: Why Housing Matters initiative. She was included in the initiative&#x27;s public service announcement (PSA) which asked Americans to rethink their views on public housing and consider how it benefits people in their own communities.

== Personal life ==
Jewel and actor Sean Penn began dating in 1995 after Penn spotted her performing on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. Penn invited Jewel to compose a song for his film &quot;The Crossing Guard&quot; and followed her on tour.

After dating for a decade, Jewel and rodeo cowboy Ty Murray were married in the Bahamas in 2008. She gave birth to their son, Kase Townes Murray, on July 11, 2011. In 2014, after nearly six years of marriage, the couple divorced.

Jewel is the daughter of Atz Kilcher, who stars in the Discovery Channel show &quot;&quot;. All three of her brothers live in Alaska.
Her first cousin once removed is actress Q&#x27;orianka Kilcher who is best known for her role as Pocahontas in &quot;The New World&quot; (2005).

Jewel has been estranged from her mother (who served as her business manager) since 2003, when Jewel accused her of stealing millions of dollars from her.

Jewel has said: &quot;I don&#x27;t think I started off young as a feminist. I read a lot of books in Alaska, I was pretty isolated where I grew up, and I think that I never thought I was any different than a man; I was raised in a place where pioneer women were very strong still. They&#x27;d shoe horses and build their own homes and were very self-sufficient. It wasn&#x27;t really until I&#x27;ve gotten older that I really became a fan of women. And a fan of what women are capable of balancing and achieving, by just being them.&quot;

In a 2022 interview with &quot;Mental&quot;, Jewel talks about how she started having panic attacks at age sixteen. Unbeknownst to her then, she employed the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), particularly visualization, to manage them.

On January 20, 2025 Jewel made a surprise performance, singing &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cheryl Hines at the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Inauguration Ball held during the second inauguration of Donald Trump. She later apologized and expressed her support for the LGBTQIA+ community.

<doc id="159730" wikidata="Q3909934" url="?curid=159730" title="Mathematical practice">
<text>Mathematical practice comprises the working practices of professional mathematicians: selecting theorems to prove, using informal notations to persuade themselves and others that various steps in the final proof are convincing, and seeking peer review and publication, as opposed to the end result of proven and published theorems.

Philip Kitcher has proposed a more formal definition of a mathematical practice, as a quintuple. His intention was primarily to document mathematical practice through its historical changes.

==Historical tradition==
The evolution of mathematical practice was slow, and some contributors to modern mathematics did not follow even the practice of their time. For example, Pierre de Fermat was infamous for withholding his proofs, but nonetheless had a vast reputation for correct assertions of results.

One motivation to study mathematical practice is that, despite much work in the 20th century, some still feel that the foundations of mathematics remain unclear and ambiguous. One proposed remedy is to shift focus to some degree onto &#x27;what is meant by a proof&#x27;, and other such questions of method.

If mathematics has been informally used throughout history, in numerous cultures and continents, then it could be argued that &quot;mathematical practice&quot; is the practice, or use, of mathematics in everyday life. One definition of mathematical practice, as described above, is the &quot;working practices of professional mathematicians&quot;. However, another definition, more in keeping with the predominant usage of mathematics, is that mathematical practice is the everyday practice, or use, of math. Whether one is estimating the total cost of their groceries, calculating miles per gallon, or figuring out how many minutes on the treadmill that chocolate éclair will require, math in everyday life relies on practicality (i.e., does it answer the question?) rather than formal proof.

==Teaching practice==
Mathematical teaching usually requires the use of several important teaching pedagogies or components. Most GCSE, A-Level and undergraduate mathematics require the following components: 
# Textbooks or lecture notes which display the mathematical material to be covered/taught within the context of the teaching of mathematics. This requires that the mathematical content being taught at the (say) undergraduate level is of a well documented and widely accepted nature that has been unanimously verified as being correct and meaningful within a mathematical context.
# Workbooks. Usually, in order to ensure that students have an opportunity to learn and test the material that they have learnt, workbooks or question papers enable mathematical understanding to be tested. It is not unknown for exam papers to draw upon questions from such test papers, or to require prerequisite knowledge of such test papers for mathematical progression.
# Exam papers and standardised (and preferably apolitical) testing methods. Often, within countries such as the US, the UK (and, in all likelihood, China) there are standardised qualifications, examinations and workbooks that form the concrete teaching materials needed for secondary-school and pre-university courses (for example, within the UK, all students are required to sit or take Scottish Highers/Advanced Highers, A-levels or their equivalent in order to ensure that a certain minimal level of mathematical competence in a wide variety of topics has been obtained). Note, however, that at the undergraduate, post-graduate and doctoral levels within these countries, there need not be any standardised process via which mathematicians of differing ability levels can be tested or examined. Other common test formats within the UK and beyond include the BMO (which is a multiple-choice test competition paper used in order to determine the best candidates that are to represent countries within the International Mathematical Olympiad).

<doc id="159731" wikidata="Q1960493" url="?curid=159731" title="Quasi-empiricism in mathematics">
<text>Quasi-empiricism in mathematics is the attempt in the philosophy of mathematics to direct philosophers&#x27; attention to mathematical practice, in particular, relations with physics, social sciences, and computational mathematics, rather than solely to issues in the foundations of mathematics. Of concern to this discussion are several topics: the relationship of empiricism (see Penelope Maddy) with mathematics, issues related to realism, the importance of culture, necessity of application, etc.

==Primary arguments==
A primary argument with respect to quasi-empiricism is that whilst mathematics and physics are frequently considered to be closely linked fields of study, this may reflect human cognitive bias. It is claimed that, despite rigorous application of appropriate empirical methods or mathematical practice in either field, this would nonetheless be insufficient to disprove alternate approaches.

Eugene Wigner (1960) noted that this culture need not be restricted to mathematics, physics, or even humans. He stated further that &quot;The miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. We should be grateful for it and hope that it will remain valid in future research and that it will extend, for better or for worse, to our pleasure, even though perhaps also to our bafflement, to wide branches of learning.&quot; Wigner used several examples to demonstrate why &#x27;bafflement&#x27; is an appropriate description, such as showing how mathematics adds to situational knowledge in ways that are either not possible otherwise or are so outside normal thought to be of little notice. The predictive ability, in the sense of describing potential phenomena prior to observation of such, which can be supported by a mathematical system would be another example.

Following up on Wigner, Richard Hamming (1980) wrote about applications of mathematics as a central theme to this topic and suggested that successful use can sometimes trump proof, in the following sense: where a theorem has evident veracity through applicability, later evidence that shows the theorem&#x27;s proof to be problematic would result more in trying to firm up the theorem rather than in trying to redo the applications or to deny results obtained to date. Hamming had four explanations for the &#x27;effectiveness&#x27; that we see with mathematics and definitely saw this topic as worthy of discussion and study.

# &quot;We see what we look for.&quot; Why &#x27;quasi&#x27; is apropos in reference to this discussion.
# &quot;We select the kind of mathematics to use.&quot; Our use and modification of mathematics are essentially situational and goal-driven.
# &quot;Science in fact answers comparatively few problems.&quot; What still needs to be looked at is a larger set.
# &quot;The evolution of man provided the model.&quot; There may be limits attributable to the human element.

For Willard Van Orman Quine (1960), existence is only existence in a structure. This position is relevant to quasi-empiricism because Quine believes that the same evidence that supports theorizing about the structure of the world is the same as the evidence supporting theorizing about mathematical structures.

Hilary Putnam (1975) stated that mathematics had accepted informal proofs and proof by authority, and had made and corrected errors all through its history. Also, he stated that Euclid&#x27;s system of proving geometry theorems was unique to the classical Greeks and did not evolve similarly in other mathematical cultures in China, India, and Arabia. This and other evidence led many mathematicians to reject the label of Platonists, along with Plato&#x27;s ontology which, along with the methods and epistemology of Aristotle, had served as a foundation ontology for the Western world since its beginnings. A truly international culture of mathematics would, Putnam and others (1983) argued, necessarily be at least &#x27;quasi&#x27;-empirical (embracing &#x27;the scientific method&#x27; for consensus if not experiment).

Imre Lakatos (1976), who did his original work on this topic for his dissertation (1961, Cambridge), argued for &#x27;research programs&#x27; as a means to support a basis for mathematics and considered thought experiments as appropriate to mathematical discovery. Lakatos may have been the first to use &#x27;quasi-empiricism&#x27; in the context of this subject.

===Operational aspects===
Several recent works pertain to this topic. Gregory Chaitin&#x27;s and Stephen Wolfram&#x27;s work, though their positions may be considered controversial, apply. Chaitin (1997/2003) suggests an underlying randomness to mathematics and Wolfram (&quot;A New Kind of Science&quot;, 2002) argues that undecidability may have practical relevance, that is, be more than an abstraction.

Another relevant addition would be the discussions concerning interactive computation, especially those related to the meaning and use of Turing&#x27;s model (Church-Turing thesis, Turing machines, etc.).

These works are heavily computational and raise another set of issues. To quote Chaitin (1997/2003): 

The collection of &quot;Undecidables&quot; in Wolfram (&quot;A New Kind of Science&quot;, 2002) is another example.

Wegner&#x27;s 2006 paper &quot;Principles of Problem Solving&quot; suggests that &quot;interactive computation&quot; can help mathematics form a more appropriate framework (empirical) than can be founded with rationalism alone. Related to this argument is that the function (even recursively related ad infinitum) is too simple a construct to handle the reality of entities that resolve (via computation or some type of analog) n-dimensional (general sense of the word) systems.

<doc id="159734" wikidata="Q376360" url="?curid=159734" title="Vuk Branković">
<text>Vuk Branković (, , 1345 – 6 October 1397) was a Serbian medieval nobleman who, during the Fall of the Serbian Empire, inherited a province that extended over present-day southern and southwestern Serbia, entire Kosovo, the northern part of present-day Republic of North Macedonia, and northern Montenegro. His fief (and later state) was known as &quot;Oblast Brankovića&quot; (District of Branković) or simply as &quot;Vukova zemlja&quot; (Vuk&#x27;s land), which he held with the title of &quot;gospodin&quot; (lord, sir), under Prince Lazar of Serbia. After the Battle of Kosovo (1389), Vuk was briefly the &quot;de facto&quot; most powerful Serbian lord.

==Origins==
Branković was born in 1345 and belonged to a Serb noble family that held a prominent role in the 14th century. Vuk was a son of Branko Mladenović (died before 1365), who received the high court title of &quot;sevastokrator&quot; from Emperor Stefan Dušan (r. 1331–1355) and served as governor of Ohrid (present-day North Macedonia). Vuk&#x27;s grandfather was Mladen (died after 1326), who was &quot;župan&quot; (count) in Trebinje under King Stefan Milutin (1282–1321) and &quot;vojvoda&quot; (duke) under King Stefan Dečanski (1321–1331). Later chronicles alleged that the Branković were descended from Vukan Nemanjić, son of Stefan Nemanja.

==Expansion==

After their father&#x27;s death, Vuk and his brothers Grgur and Nikola Radonja retreated to the valley of Drenica (central Kosovo). During the final years of Stefan Uroš V&#x27;s rule, Grgur and Vuk&#x27;s governance was limited to their heritance in Drenica. Vuk took advantage of the death of King Vukašin in the Battle of Maritsa (1371) and conquered Sjenica, Zvečan, and part of the Lim River valley.

Vuk&#x27;s marriage to Mara, the daughter of the most powerful Serbian magnate prince Lazar Hrebeljanović, brought him substantial lands in Kosovo. This marriage sealed the alliance between two houses and secured Lazar&#x27;s assistance for Vuk&#x27;s future plans, although Vuk in return had to acknowledge Lazar as his feudal senior. Soon after the marriage, Lazar and King Tvrtko I of Bosnia attacked župan Nikola Altomanović, who ruled in the western part of Serbia, and conquered and divided his lands in 1373. In the partition of Altomanović&#x27;s land, Vuk got areas of Raška (including the old Serbian capital Ras) and lands in Polimlje (northern Montenegro). After the death of Đurađ I Balšić (13 January 1378), Vuk captured his cities of Prizren and Peć (Peja) and the area of Metohija.

At its peak, the realm of Branković stretched from Sjenica in the west to Skopje in the east, with the cities of Pristina and Vushtrri serving as its capitals. The most important cities in Vuk&#x27;s province were Priština, Prizren, Peć, Skopje, and Ras, as well as the rich mining settlements of Trepča, Janjevo, Gluhavica, and others.

==Battle of Kosovo==
After the Battle of Maritza, the Ottomans forced the southern Serbian feudal lords (in present-day Macedonia and Greece), Konstantin Dragaš, King Marko, Toma Preljubović, and others, to become their vassals and started to attack the northern Serbian lands ruled by prince Lazar and Vuk. After initial Serbian successes at the battles of Dubravnica (1381), Pločnik (1386), and Bileća (1388), the Ottomans launched a full-scale attack on Serbia, aiming at the very heartland of Vuk&#x27;s realm in central Kosovo. In the epic Battle of Kosovo (1389), Vuk participated along with his father-in-law Lazar and a contingent of King Tvrtko&#x27;s army.

Unlike Lazar, who died in the battle along with most of his army, Vuk managed to survive and preserve his army, which later gave material for a popular Serbian folk tradition (represented in folk epic poems and tales) that he betrayed Lazar in order to become supreme ruler of Serbia, a theory that is rejected by modern-day Serbian historians but not by the Serb people. Despite the consensus of modern historiography in Serbia that Vuk Branković was not a traitor in the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, Momčilo Spremić emphasized that there is a possibility that Vuk really betrayed his Serbian allies.

==Last years==
After the Battle of Kosovo, Vuk refused to become an Ottoman vassal (unlike prince Stefan Lazarević, son of prince Lazar, who became an Ottoman vassal in late 1389) and started to plan anti-Ottoman action together with the Hungarian king Sigismund. However, Vuk was unable to resist the Ottomans for long. In 1392, they captured Skopje and forced Vuk to become their vassal and pay tribute. Even after that, Vuk showed some resistance to the Ottomans, refusing to participate on the Ottoman side in the battles of Rovine (1395) and Nicopolis (1396), unlike other Serbian lords such as prince Stefan, prince Marko, and Konstantin Dejanović. He also maintained contacts with Hungary. Finally, the Ottomans ended this situation by attacking Vuk in 1395–96, seizing his land, and giving most of it to prince Stefan Lazarević, while Vuk himself was imprisoned and died in an Ottoman prison. A small part of Vuk&#x27;s land with the towns of Priština and Vučitrn was given to his sons to hold as Ottoman vassals.

==Family==
He married Mara (Marija), the daughter of Lazar of Serbia and Milica Nemanjić in 1371. She died on April 12, 1426. They had three sons:
*Grgur Vuković (1377 - 13 March 1408),
*Đurađ Branković (1377 - 24 December 1456), succeeded his maternal uncle Stefan Lazarević as &quot;Despot&quot; of Serbia (Serbian Despotate), ruling 1427–1456
*Lazar Vuković (died 12 July 1410), knez

==Titles==
He is most often titled &quot;Lord Vuk&quot; (господин Вук), while he signed himself &quot;Lord of Serbs and Podunavlje&quot; (). The Serbian Church had in the period between 1374 and 1379 accepted &quot;knez&quot; Lazar as &quot;Lord of Serbs and Podunavlje&quot;. According to historian R. Mihaljčić, when Vuk claimed the title, Stefan Lazarević was around 15 years old (ca. 1392). Vuk was not recognised with that title, as it was preserved for Lazar and Lazar&#x27;s son Stefan.

==People of his court==
*Braiko Pekpal (fl. 1374)
*Vlatko Hranotić
*Dragosav
*Jakov
*Nikola ( 1389), &quot;kefalija&quot;
*Nikolica ( 1389), &quot;dijak&quot;
*Pribil Kućinić
*Todor Hamirović, &quot;vojvoda&quot; Prnjak and &quot;čelnik&quot; Smil (fl. 1387)
*Stefan (fl. 1395), chancellor.
*Todor, son of Žegar (fl. 1387)

==Legacy==

Folk tradition portraits Vuk as a traitor in the Kosovo Myth: supposedly, Vuk tarnished the family name when he betrayed Prince Lazar at the Battle of Kosovo, which he survived in 1389. This tradition is apocryphal.

<text>Quasi-empirical methods are scientific methods used to gain knowledge in situations where empirical evidence cannot be gathered through experimentation, or experience cannot falsify the ideas involved. Quasi-empirical methods aim to be as closely analogous to empirical methods as possible. 

Empirical research relies on, and its empirical methods involve experimentation and disclosure of apparatus for reproducibility, by which scientific findings are validated by other scientists. Empirical methods are studied extensively in the philosophy of science, but they cannot be used directly in fields whose hypotheses cannot be falsified by real experiment (for example, mathematics, philosophy, theology, and ideology). Because of such limits, the scientific method must rely not only on empirical methods but sometimes also on quasi-empirical ones. The prefix &quot;&quot; came to denote methods that are &quot;almost&quot; or &quot;socially approximate&quot; an ideal of truly empirical methods.

Quasi-empirical method usually refers to a means of choosing problems to focus on (or ignore), selecting prior work on which to build an argument or proof, notations for informal claims, peer review and acceptance, and incentives to discover, ignore, or correct errors. To disprove a theory logically, it is unnecessary to find all counterexamples to a theory; all that is required is one counterexample. The converse does not prove a theory; Bayesian inference simply makes a theory more likely, by weight of evidence. Since it is not possible to find all counter-examples to a theory, it is also possible to argue that no science is strictly empirical, but this is not the usual meaning of &quot;quasi-empirical&quot;.

==Examples==
Albert Einstein&#x27;s discovery of the general relativity theory relied upon thought experiments and mathematics. Empirical methods only became relevant when confirmation was sought. Furthermore, some empirical confirmation was found only some time after the general acceptance of the theory.

Thought experiments are almost standard procedure in philosophy, where a conjecture is tested out in the imagination for possible effects on experience; when these are thought to be implausible, unlikely to occur, or not actually occurring, then the conjecture may be either rejected or amended. Logical positivism was a perhaps extreme version of this practice, though this claim is open to debate.

Quasi-empiricism in mathematics is an important topic in post-20th-century philosophy of mathematics, especially as reflected in the actual mathematical practice of working mathematicians.

<doc id="159737" wikidata="Q314075" url="?curid=159737" title="Miloš Obilić">
<text>Miloš Obilić (, ) is a legendary Serbian knight traditionally said to have served Prince Lazar during the Ottoman invasion of Serbia in the late 14th century. Although absent from contemporary records, he features prominently in later accounts of the 1389 Battle of Kosovo as the assassin of Sultan Murad I. The assassin remains unnamed in historical sources until the late 15th century, but the widespread circulation of the story in Florentine, Serbian, Ottoman, and Greek sources suggests that versions of it were known across the Balkans within decades of the battle.

His original name is believed to have been Miloš Kobilić, though multiple variations exist in historical sources, and his actual existence remains uncertain. The Lazar dynasty, in consolidating its political influence, played a key role in shaping the Kosovo Myth, which incorporated the legend of Obilić. Jelka Ređep notes that Obilić&#x27;s legend significantly evolved through oral tradition, reflecting Serbian cultural ideals of heroism, loyalty and sacrifice. Over time, he became a central figure in Serbian epic poetry, where he was elevated to the status of a national hero embodying medieval Serbian folklore. Alongside Prince Lazar’s martyrdom and the alleged treachery of Vuk Branković, Miloš&#x27;s deed became integral to Serbian narratives surrounding the Battle of Kosovo. By the 19th century, he was also venerated as a saint in the Serbian Orthodox Church.

Miloš Obilić also appears in Albanian epic poetry, where he is remembered as Millosh Kopiliqi, with his birthplace traditionally linked to the Drenica region in modern-day Kosovo, where villages named Kopiliq still exist. However, there is no definitive evidence confirming the identity of Murad’s assassin.

==Name==
Miloš is a Slavic given name recorded from the early Middle Ages among the Bulgarians, Czechs, Poles and Serbs. It is derived from the Slavic root &quot;mil-&quot;, meaning &quot;merciful&quot; or &quot;dear&quot;, which is found in a great number of Slavic given names.

Several versions of the hero&#x27;s surname have been used throughout history. His original surname was Kobilić or Kobilović, a thesis which is further supported by archival findings by historian Mihailo Dinić in Ragusan archives of 1433 which show that Miloš&#x27;s original surname was indeed Kobilić (). In Albanian folklore, the original name is preserved and he is known as Kopiliq. The root of the name &#x27;Kopiliq&#x27; might be in an old Balkan substrat word, in Albanian kopil (child or bastard child), in Romanian copil (child) and in Serbian kopile (bastard child) or kobila (mare, from which kobilić, son of the mare). The etymological origin of his name is indicated in Serbian folk stories which claim that the hero is said to have been nursed by a mare. Jireček connected the surname to two noble families in medieval Ragusa and Trebinje, the Kobilić and Kobiljačić in the 14th and 15th centuries, and noted that they altered their surnames in the 18th century because they considered it &quot;indecent&quot; to be associated with mares. A poem by Croat Andrija Kačić Miošić titled &quot;Pisma od Miloscia Cobilichja i Vuka Brancovichja&quot; (&quot;Pisma od Kobilića i Vuka Brankovića&quot;, modern spelling) preserves the old name in the 18th century.

The rendering Obilić has universally been used by Serbian writers in modern times. Its first version is found in the &quot;History of Montenegro&quot; (1754) by Vasilije Petrović, who wrote of one Miloš Obilijević, and in 1765, the historian Pavle Julinac who rendered the surname as Obilić. According to Czech historian Konstantin Jireček, the surname Obilić and its different renderings are derived from the Serbian words &quot;obilan&quot; (&quot;plenty of&quot;) and &quot;obilje&quot; (&quot;wealth, abundance&quot;).

Miloš is often referred to in the epic poems as &quot;Miloš of Pocerje&quot;, and according to local legends, he came from the western Serbian region of Pocerina. In Pocerina there is a spring known as &quot;Miloševa Banja&quot; (Miloš&#x27;s spring) and an old grave that is claimed to be the grave of Miloš&#x27;s sister.

==Literary sources==
The earliest sources on the Battle of Kosovo, which generally favour the cult of Prince Lazar, do not mention Miloš or his assassination of the sultan. The assassination itself is first recorded by Deacon Ignjatije on 9 July 1389, only 12 days after the battle. The assassination of sultan Murad and one of his sons (Yakub Çelebi) was also mentioned in the instructions of the Venetian Senate issued to Andrea Bembo on 23 July 1389, although Venetians were uncertain if news about the assassination were true. On 1 August 1389 King Tvrtko I of Bosnia (r. 1353–1391) wrote a letter to Trogir to inform its citizens about the Ottoman defeat. Victory over the Turks () was also reported by Coluccio Salutati (died 1406), Chancellor of Florence, in his letter to King Tvrtko, dated 20 October 1389, on behalf of the Florentine Senate. The killer is not named but he is described as one of twelve Christian noblemen who managed to break through the Ottoman ranks:

:&quot;Fortunate, most fortunate are those hands of the twelve loyal lords who, having opened their way with the sword and having penetrated the enemy lines and the circle of chained camels, heroically reached the tent of Amurat [Murad] himself. Fortunate above all is that one who so forcefully killed such a strong vojvoda by stabbing him with a sword in the throat and belly. And blessed are all those who gave their lives and blood through the glorious manner of martyrdom as victims of the dead leader over his ugly corpse.&quot;

Scholars consider many details in Tvrtko&#x27;s letter to be fanciful, including the symbolic number 12.

In 1402, an anonymous Catalan author assigned Murad&#x27;s death to a Hungarian knight. The knight might have been related to Lazar through marriage and had sent a Hungarian contingent to the battle. In the legend, Miloš Obilić was Lazar&#x27;s son-in-law; in reality, Lazar had a Hungarian son-in-law. Another Italian account, Mignanelli&#x27;s 1416 work, asserted that it was Lazar who killed the Ottoman sultan.

The assassin&#x27;s first appearance in Serbian sources is in the biography of Stefan Lazarević, Lazar&#x27;s son, by Constantine the Philosopher, written in the 1440s. The hero, still anonymous, is described as a man of noble birth whom envious tongues had sought to defame before the prince. To prove his loyalty and courage, he left the front line on the pretext of being a deserter, seized the opportunity to stab the sultan to death and was killed himself shortly afterwards. The initial phase of ignominy and its redemption by a courageous plot of slaying the sultan are narrative ingredients which would become essential to the Serbian legend as it evolved in later times.
The loss of the Sultan also made an impression on the earliest Ottoman sources. They usually describe how Murad was unaccompanied on the battlefield and an anonymous Christian who had been lying among the corpses stabbed him to death. In the early 15th century, for instance, the poet Ahmedi writes that &quot;[s]uddenly one of the Christians, who was covered in blood and apparently hidden among the enemy dead, got up, rushed to Murad and stabbed him with a dagger.&quot;

Halil İnalcık explained that one of the most important contemporary Ottomans sources about the Battle of Kosovo is the 1465 work of Enveri (). İnalcık argued that it was based on the testimony of a contemporary eyewitness of the battle, probably Hoca Omer, an envoy sent by the Sultan to Lazar before the battle. In this work Enveri explains that before he became a Serbian nobleman, Miloš (Miloš Ban is how İnalcık rendered the name in Enveri&#x27;s text) was a Muslim at the Sultan&#x27;s court who deserted Ottomans and abjured Islam. The Sultan allegedly called him to return to his service many times. Enveri explains that although Miloš always promised to return, he never did. According to this account, when Lazar was captured, Miloš approached the Sultan who was riding a black stallion and said: &quot;I am Miloš Ban, I want to go back to my Islamic faith and kiss your hand.&quot; When Miloš came close to the Sultan, he struck him with the dagger hidden in his cuff. The Sultan&#x27;s men cut Miloš into pieces with swords and axes.

One historian from Edirne, Oruc Bey, explains the lack of protection by saying that the army was preoccupied with pursuing the enemy in rear flight and introduces an element of deception: the Christian &quot;had promised himself as a sacrifice and approached Murad, who was sitting alone on his horse. Pretending he wished to kiss the Sultan&#x27;s hand, he stabbed the Sultan with a sharp dagger.&quot;

Since about the late 15th century, Greek sources also begin to record the event. The Athenian scholar Laonicus Chalcocondyles (d. &quot;c&quot;. 1490) claims to draw on Greek traditions when he refers to Murad&#x27;s killer as &quot;Miloes&quot;, &quot;a man of noble birth [... who] voluntarily decided to accomplish the heroic act of assassination. He requested what he needed from Prince Lazar, and then rode off to Murad&#x27;s camp with the intention of presenting himself as a deserter. Murad, who was standing in the midst of his troops before the battle, was eager to receive the deserter. Miloes reached the Sultan and his bodyguards, turned his spear against Murad, and killed him.&quot; Writing in the second half of the same century, Michael Doukas regarded the story as worthy of inclusion in his &quot;Historia Byzantina&quot;. He relates how the young nobleman pretended to desert the battle, was captured by the Turks and professing to know the key to victory, managed to gain access to Murad and kill him.

In 1976, Miodrag Popović suggested that the narrative elements of secrecy and stratagem in the Serbian tradition were all introduced from Turkish sources, seeking to defame the capabilities of their Christian opponents by attributing the death of the Murat to &quot;devious&quot; methods. Thomas A. Emmert agrees with him.

Emmert says that Turkish sources mentioned the assassination several times, while Western and Serbian sources didn&#x27;t mention it until much later. He thinks that Serbians knew about the assassination, but decided not to mention it in their first accounts for unknown reasons.

In 1512, Ottoman historian Mehmed Nesri wrote a detailed account of the battle that became the source for later Ottoman and Western descriptions of the battle. Nesri&#x27;s account took several elements from popular Serbian tradition, and described the assassination in a way which reflected negatively on the perpetrators.

There is no evidence about the knight&#x27;s origin; theories that the legend was based on a Serb, Albanian or Hungarian knight have been put forward.

==Oral traditions==
===Serbian traditions===
Miloš Obilić is a major hero of the Serbian legend of Kosovo, whose central part is the Battle of Kosovo. According to the legend, Miloš was married with the princess Jelena, daughter of the Serbian Prince Lazar. A quarrel broke out between his wife and her sister who was married to Vuk Branković, about superiority in valour of their respective husbands. As a consequence of this, Branković took offence and picked a fight with Miloš. Filled with hate, Branković maligned Miloš to Lazar, saying that he conspired with Turks to betray the prince. At Lazar&#x27;s supper on the eve of the battle, the prince reproached Miloš for disloyalty. To prove his loyalty, Miloš went into the Turkish camp feigning defection. At a favourable moment, he stabbed and killed the Turkish Sultan Murad, whose attendants then executed Miloš. The legend then goes on to describe events regarding the battle.

There are two main views about the creation of the Kosovo legend. In one view, its place of origin lies in the region in which the Battle of Kosovo was fought. In the other view, the legend sprang up in more westerly Balkan regions under the influence of the French &quot;chansons de geste&quot;. Serbian philologist Dragutin Kostić stated that the French chivalric epics had in fact no part in the formation of the legend, but that they &quot;only &quot;modified&quot; the already created and formed legend and its first poetic manifestations&quot;. The nucleus from which the legend developed is found in the cultic literature celebrating Prince Lazar as a martyr and saint, written in Moravian Serbia between 1389 and 1420. Especially important in this regard is the &quot;Discourse on Prince Lazar&quot; composed by Serbian Patriarch Danilo III. The legend would gradually evolve during the subsequent centuries.

The tale of the maligned hero who penetrated the Turkish camp and killed Sultan Murad, is found in the &quot;Life of Despot Stefan Lazarević&quot; written in the 1430s by Konstantin the Philosopher. The hero&#x27;s name is not mentioned in this work. The theme of the quarrel between Lazar&#x27;s sons-in-law was first recorded in Herzegovina in the mid-15th century. Lazar&#x27;s supper on the eve of the battle and his reproach of Miloš are mentioned in texts from the 16th century. The argument between Lazar&#x27;s daughters over the valor of their husbands was first recorded by Mavro Orbin in 1601. The fully developed legend of Kosovo, with all of its elements, is recorded in the &quot;Tale of the Battle of Kosovo&quot; composed around the beginning of the 18th century in the Bay of Kotor or Old Montenegro. This was a very popular text, whose copies were continuously produced for some 150 years in an area stretching from the south of ex-Yugoslavia to Budapest and Sofia. The &quot;Tale&quot; played a notable role in the awakening of national consciousness of the Serbs in the Habsburg monarchy, which began in the first half of the 18th century.
The first author to refer to Murad&#x27;s killer by his full name is Konstantin Mihailović, a Serbian Janissary from the village of Ostrovica, near Rudnik, who wrote his &quot;Memoirs of a Janissary&quot; or &quot;Turkish Chronicle&quot; in ca 1497. In a passage intended to infer a moral lesson about disloyalty from the Serbian defeat at Kosovo, Mihailović identifies Miloš Kobila as the knight who on the fateful last Friday of the battle slew Murad. The next time a name is given in the sources is three decades later, in 1530, when the (Slovene) monk Benedikt Kuripečič (Curipeschitz) wrote memoirs of his travels through the Balkan Peninsula. His visit to Murad&#x27;s tomb in Kosovo Polje provides the occasion for the story of the knight whom he names Miloš Kobilović. Kuripešić elaborates on the humiliation and fall out favour which Miloš endured before the battle, his last dinner with Lazar and his nobles, his admittance to Murad&#x27;s tent, the brutal murder and his own death on attempting to escape on horseback. The monk, though not explicit about his sources, writes that Miloš was a celebrated figure in the popular traditions of Serbs, who sing about his heroic exploits on the border. He recorded some legends about the Battle of Kosovo and mentions epic songs about Obilić in regions far from Kosovo, like Bosnia and Croatia. In his 1603 work Richard Knolles described the &quot;country songs&quot; of Serbs about the Battle of Kosovo and refer to Obilić as &quot;Cobelitz&quot;.

In Serbian epic poetry and song (e.g. &quot;Radul-bey and Bulgarian King Šišman&quot; and the song &quot;Dušan&#x27;s Wedding&quot;), Miloš Obilić is often grouped along with other literary creations like Karadjordje, Vuk Karadžić and Njegoš as Serbs of Dinaric origin who distinguished themselves as the great moral and/or intellectual minds of the past in contradistinction to Bulgarian contemporaries, who could claim no such status. In the poem &quot;Obilić Dragon&#x27;s Son&quot;, Miloš is given a mythical ancestry as the son of a dragon to emphasise his superhuman strength on a physical and spiritual level; in this, he joins the ranks of many other heroes of Serbian poetry who fought against Turkish oppression and are claimed to have been descendants of a dragon. Jelka Ređep, a scholar of Serbian folklore and epic poetry, argues that Miloš Obilić’s story developed significantly through oral transmission, shaping him into a symbolic embodiment of Serbian cultural identity and heroic ideals.

===Albanian traditions===
In Albanian epic poetry, the hero is known as Millosh Kopiliqi, a version of the which corresponds to the original name attested in Slavic. He is thought to have been born in the village of Kopiliq in the Drenica region of Kosovo. In Albanian epic poetry, Prince Lazar is not existent in most variants. Instead Milosh Kopiliq, presented as a Christian Albanian warrior, is the sole killer of Sultan Murat. In the story, after Murat&#x27;s death he is betrayed by an old Slavic woman (&quot;shkina&quot; in the original) and then is decapitated by the Ottomans. Gligorije Elezović recorded the Albanian version in the 1920s in Kosovo as sung by folk singers. Albert Lord, an expert in Balkan epic poetry, considered the tale of Milos Kobilić as a &quot;mainly Albanian folk expression which traced its major elements to Albanian oral traditions&quot;. By comparing the Slavic and Albanian traditions about Kobilić, Lord came to the conclusion that they developed independently, but also borrowed from each other. Lord considers this cultural meeting point to have happened in Sandžak, where Albanians and Slavs lived as neighbours.

==Legacy==

The artistically valuable basin by the Šibenik-based goldsmith and engraver (c. 1530–1596) depicts three scenes from the life of the then-already legendary Christian hero, the Serb Miloš Obilić.

It was not until the early 19th century that Miloš was also venerated as a saint in the Serbian Church. During the Serbian Revolution (1804–1815), a fresco of Miloš as a haloed, sword-bearing saint was painted in Prince Lazar&#x27;s narthex in the Hilandar Monastery on Mount Athos (Greece). The historian Rade Mihaljčić suggests that the cult was a popular movement which originated among the Serbs south of the Sava and Danube during the Ottoman period.

Later in the same century, the heroic figure of Miloš was given a national boost in the epic poem &quot;The Mountain Wreath&quot; (1847) by Petar II Petrović-Njegoš, prince-bishop of Montenegro. The poem praises the assassin&#x27;s valour in battle, calling him &quot;the victim of a noble feeling, / An all powerful military genius, / A dreadful thunder that smashes crowns&quot;. Njegoš also instituted the Obilić medal for courage.

This event and the Battle of Kosovo itself has become embedded in the Serbs&#x27; national consciousness, history, and poetry. Njegoš&#x27;s tales, including Miloš, inspired later generations of Serbs – notably Gavrilo Princip, the assassin of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

In 1913, the Medal of Miloš Obilić was awarded by King Peter I to soldiers for the acts of great personal courage, or for personal courage demonstrated on the battlefield. It was given during the Balkan wars, World War I, and during World War II, to members of the Yugoslav Army or allied forces and was discontinued with the end of the war.

In the late 1980s, religious nationalists began to breathe further life into the figure of Miloš and the Kosovo Myth. Special inspiration was taken from Njegoš&#x27;s &quot;The Mountain Wreath&quot;, with its portrayal of Lazar as a Christ-like martyr and Obilić as the Serb sacrificing himself to prove his loyalty and seek retribution. A key event which gave expression to this idea was the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo (Vidovdan) on 28 June 1989, which was held at the Gazimestan plain, near the site of the battle. Obilić&#x27;s feat has been cited as a source of inspiration in public speeches by political leaders, notably President Milošević, who referred to him in his Gazimestan speech on the occasion of the battle anniversary. His regime often alluded to Obilić frequently in comparison to Milosević, who was proclaimed the &quot;saviour of the nation&quot;.

Obilić is featured in Serbian rhymical idiom &quot;Dva loša ubiše Miloša&quot; or &quot;Dva su loša ubila Miloša&quot; which translates as &quot;Two no-goods have killed Miloš&quot;. The idiom addresses the issue of quantity prevailing over quality as a sad fact of life, since Obilić was outnumbered by the enemies.

In Serbian epic poetry, there are several blood brotherhoods. Miloš Obilić with Milan Toplica and Ivan Kosančić, Miloš Obilić with Prince Marko, Miloš Obilić with the Jugović brothers.

He is included in &quot;The 100 most prominent Serbs&quot;.

<text>Imagery intelligence (IMINT), pronounced as either as &quot;Im-Int&quot; or &quot;I-Mint&quot;, is an intelligence gathering discipline wherein imagery is analyzed (or &quot;exploited&quot;) to identify information of intelligence value. Imagery used for defense intelligence purposes is generally collected via satellite imagery or aerial photography.

As an intelligence gathering discipline, IMINT production depends heavily upon a robust intelligence collection management system. IMINT is complemented by non-imaging MASINT electro-optical and radar sensors.

==History==

===Origins===


Although aerial photography was first used extensively in the First World War, it was only in the Second World War that specialized imagery intelligence operations were initiated. High quality images were made possible with a series of innovations in the decade leading up to the war. In 1928, the RAF developed an electric heating system for the aerial camera. This allowed reconnaissance aircraft to take pictures from very high altitudes without the camera parts freezing.

In 1939, Sidney Cotton and Flying Officer Maurice Longbottom of the RAF suggested that airborne reconnaissance may be a task better suited to fast, small aircraft which would use their speed and high service ceiling to avoid detection and interception. They proposed the use of Spitfires with their armament and radios removed and replaced with extra fuel and cameras. This led to the development of the Spitfire PR variants. These planes had a maximum speed of 396 mph at 30,000 feet with their armaments removed, and were used for photo-reconnaissance missions. The aircraft were fitted with five cameras which were heated to ensure good results.

The systematic collection and interpretation of the huge amounts of aerial reconnaissance intelligence data soon became imperative. Beginning in 1941, RAF Medmenham was the main interpretation centre for photographic reconnaissance operations in the European and Mediterranean theatres. The &quot;Central Interpretation Unit&quot; (CIU) was later amalgamated with the Bomber Command Damage Assessment Section and the Night Photographic Interpretation Section of No 3 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit, RAF Oakington, in 1942.

During 1942 and 1943, the CIU gradually expanded and was involved in the planning stages of practically every operation of the war, and in every aspect of intelligence. In 1945, daily intake of material averaged 25,000 negatives and 60,000 prints. Thirty-six million prints were made during the war. By VE-day, the print library, which documented and stored worldwide cover, held 5,000,000 prints from which 40,000 reports had been produced.

American personnel had for some time formed an increasing part of the CIU and on 1 May 1944 this was finally recognized by changing the title of the unit to the &quot;Allied Central Interpretation Unit&quot; (ACIU). There were then over 1,700 personnel on the unit&#x27;s strength. A large number of photographic interpreters were recruited from the Hollywood Film Studios including Xavier Atencio. Two renowned archaeologists also worked there as interpreters: Dorothy Garrod, the first woman to hold an Oxbridge Chair, and Glyn Daniel, who went on to gain popular acclaim as the host of the television game show &quot;Animal, Vegetable or Mineral?&quot;.
Sidney Cotton&#x27;s aerial photographs were far ahead of their time. Together with other members of his reconnaissance squadron, he pioneered the technique of high-altitude, high-speed photography that was instrumental in revealing the locations of many crucial military and intelligence targets. Cotton also worked on ideas such as a prototype specialist reconnaissance aircraft and further refinements of photographic equipment. At its peak, British reconnaissance flights yielded 50,000 images per day to interpret.

Of particular significance in the success of the work of Medmenham was the use of stereoscopic images, using a between plate overlap of exactly 60%. Despite initial scepticism about the possibility of the German rocket technology, major operations, including the 1943 offensives against the V-2 rocket development plant at Peenemünde, were made possible by painstaking work carried out at Medmenham. Later offensives were also made against potential launch sites at Wizernes and 96 other launch sites in northern France.

It is claimed that Medmanham&#x27;s greatest operational success was &quot;Operation Crossbow&quot; which, from 23 December 1943, destroyed the V-1 infrastructure in northern France. According to R.V. Jones, photographs were used to establish the size and the characteristic launching mechanisms for both the V-1 flying bomb and the V-2 rocket.

===Post war spyplanes===

Immediately after World War II, long range aerial reconnaissance was taken up by adapted jet bombers – such as the English Electric Canberra, and its American development, the Martin B-57 – capable of flying higher or faster than the enemy.

Highly specialized and secretive strategic reconnaissance aircraft, or spy planes, such as the Lockheed U-2 and its successor, the SR-71 Blackbird were developed by the United States. Flying these aircraft became an exceptionally demanding task, as much because of the aircraft&#x27;s extreme speed and altitude as the risk of being captured as spies. As a result, the crews of these aircraft were invariably specially selected and trained.

There are claims that the US constructed a hypersonic reconnaissance aircraft, dubbed the Aurora, in the late 1980s to replace the Blackbird. Since the early 1960s, in the United States aerial and satellite reconnaissance has been coordinated by the National Reconnaissance Office.

===Early use of satellites===

Early photographic reconnaissance satellites used photographic film, which was exposed on-orbit and returned to earth for developing. These satellites remained in orbit for days, weeks, or months before ejecting their film-return vehicles, called &quot;buckets&quot;. Between 1959 and 1984 the U.S. launched around 200 such satellites under the codenames CORONA and GAMBIT, with ultimate photographic resolution (ground-resolution distance) better than . The first successful mission concluded on 1960-08-19 with the mid-air recovery by a C-119 of film from the Corona mission code-named Discoverer 14. This was the first successful recovery of film from an orbiting satellite and the first aerial recovery of an object returning from Earth orbit. Because of a tradeoff between area covered and ground resolution, not all reconnaissance satellites have been designed for high resolution; the KH-5-ARGON program had a ground resolution of 140 meters and was intended for mapmaking.

Between 1961 and 1994 the USSR launched perhaps 500 Zenit film-return satellites, which returned both the film and the camera to earth in a pressurized capsule.

The U.S. KH-11 series of satellites, first launched in 1976, was made by Lockheed, the same contractor who built the Hubble Space Telescope. HST has a 2.4 metre telescope mirror and is believed to have had a similar appearance to the KH-11 satellites. These satellites used charge-coupled devices, predecessors to modern digital cameras, rather than film. Russian reconnaissance satellites with comparable capabilities are named Resurs DK and Persona.

==Aircraft==

Low- and high-flying planes have been used all through the last century to gather intelligence about the enemy. U.S. high-flying reconnaissance planes include the Lockheed U-2, and the much faster SR-71 Blackbird, (retired in 1998). One advantage planes have over satellites is that planes can usually produce more detailed photographs and can be placed over the target more quickly, more often, and more cheaply, but planes also have the disadvantage of possibly being intercepted by aircraft or missiles such as in the 1960 U-2 incident.

Unmanned aerial vehicles have been developed for imagery and signals intelligence. These drones are a force multiplier by giving the battlefield commander an &quot;eye in the sky&quot; without risking a pilot.

==Satellite==
Though the resolution of satellite photographs, which must be taken from distances of hundreds of kilometers, is usually poorer than photographs taken by air, satellites offer the possibility of coverage for much of the earth, including hostile territory, without exposing human pilots to the risk of being shot down.
There have been hundreds of reconnaissance satellites launched by dozens of nations since the first years of space exploration. Satellites for imaging intelligence were usually placed in high-inclination low Earth orbits, sometimes in Sun-synchronous orbits. Since the film-return missions were usually short, they could indulge in orbits with low perigees, in the range of 100–200 km, but the more recent CCD-based satellites have been launched into higher orbits, 250–300 km perigee, allowing each to remain in orbit for several years. While the exact resolution and other details of modern spy satellites are classified, some idea of the trade-offs available can be made using simple physics. The formula for the highest possible resolution of an optical system with a circular aperture is given by the Rayleigh criterion:

:formula_1

Using

:formula_2

we can get

:formula_3

where &quot;θ&quot; is the angular resolution, &quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength of light, and &quot;D&quot; is the diameter of the lens or mirror. Were the Hubble Space Telescope, with a 2.4 m telescope, designed for photographing Earth, it would be diffraction-limited to resolutions greater than 16 cm (6 inches) for green light (formula_4 nm) at its orbital altitude of 590 km. This means that it would be impossible to take photographs showing objects smaller than 16 cm with such a telescope at such an altitude. Modern U.S. IMINT satellites are believed to have around 10 cm resolution; contrary to references in popular culture, this is sufficient to detect any type of vehicle, but not to read the headlines of a newspaper.

The primary purpose of most spy satellites is to monitor visible ground activity. While resolution and clarity of images has improved greatly over the years, this role has remained essentially the same. Some other uses of satellite imaging have been to produce detailed 3D maps for use in operations and missile guidance systems, and to monitor normally invisible information such as the growth levels of a country&#x27;s crops or the heat given off by certain facilities. Some of the multi-spectral sensors, such as thermal measurement, are more electro-optical MASINT than true IMINT platforms.

To counter the threat posed by these &quot;eyes in the sky&quot;, the United States, USSR/Russia, China and India have developed systems for destroying enemy spy satellites (either with the use of another &#x27;killer satellite&#x27;, or with some sort of Earth- or air-launched missile).

Since 1985, commercial vendors of satellite imagery have entered the market, beginning with the French SPOT satellites, which had resolutions between 5 and 20 metres. Recent high-resolution (4–0.5 metre) private imaging satellites include TerraSAR-X, IKONOS, Orbview, QuickBird and Worldview-1, allowing any country (or any business for that matter) to buy access to satellite images.

==Analytical Methodology==
The value of IMINT reports are determined on a balance between the timeliness and robustness of the intelligence product. As such, the fidelity of intelligence that may be gleaned from imagery analysis is a traditionally perceived by intelligence professionals as a function of the amount of time an imagery analyst (IA) has to exploit a given image or set of imagery. As such, the United States Army field manual breaks IMINT analysis into three distinct phases, based upon the amount of time expended in exploiting any given image.

===First phase===
First phase imagery analysis is deemed &quot;time-dominant&quot;. This means that given imagery must be rapidly exploited in order to satisfy an immediate requirement for imagery-sourced intelligence from which a leader may make an educated political and/or military decision. Due to the need to produce near-real time intelligence assessments based upon collected imagery, first phase imagery analysis is rarely compared to collateral intelligence.

===Second phase===
Second phase imagery analysis is centered on the further exploitation of recently collected imagery to support short- to mid-term decision-making. Like first phase imagery analysis, second phase imagery analysis is generally catalyzed by a local commander&#x27;s Priority Intelligence Requirements, at least in the context of a military operational setting. Whereas first phase imagery analysis may depend on the exploitation of a relatively small repository of imagery, or even a single image, second phase imagery analysis generally mandates a review of a chronological set of imagery over time, so as to establish a temporal understanding of objects and/or activities of interest.

===Third phase===
Third phase imagery analysis is generally conducted in order to satisfy strategic intelligence questions or to otherwise explore existing data in the search of &quot;discovery intelligence&quot;. Third phase imagery analysis hinges on the use of a large repository of historical imagery as well as access to a variety of sources of information. Third phase imagery analysis incorporates supporting information and intelligence from other intelligence gathering disciplines and is, therefore, generally conducted in support of a multi-source intelligence team. The exploitation of imagery at this level of analysis is typically conducted with the intention of producing Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT).

<doc id="159748" wikidata="Q7060553" url="?curid=159748" title="Muscular system">
<text>The muscular system is an organ system consisting of skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscle. It permits movement of the body, maintains posture, and circulates blood throughout the body. The muscular systems in vertebrates are controlled through the nervous system although some muscles (such as the cardiac muscle) can be completely autonomous. Together with the skeletal system in the human, it forms the musculoskeletal system, which is responsible for the movement of the body.

== Types ==
There are three distinct types of muscle: skeletal muscle, cardiac or heart muscle, and smooth (non-striated) muscle. Muscles provide strength, balance, posture, movement, and heat for the body to keep warm.

There are more than 600 muscles in an adult male human body. A kind of elastic tissue makes up each muscle, which consists of thousands, or tens of thousands, of small muscle fibers. Each fiber comprises many tiny strands called fibrils, impulses from nerve cells control the contraction of each muscle fiber.

=== Skeletal ===

Skeletal muscle, is a type of striated muscle, composed of muscle cells, called muscle fibers, which are in turn composed of myofibrils. Myofibrils are composed of sarcomeres, the basic building blocks of striated muscle tissue. Upon stimulation by an action potential, skeletal muscles perform a coordinated contraction by shortening each sarcomere. The best proposed model for understanding contraction is the sliding filament model of muscle contraction. Within the sarcomere, actin and myosin fibers overlap in a contractile motion towards each other. Myosin filaments have club-shaped myosin heads that project toward the actin filaments, and provide attachment points on binding sites for the actin filaments. The myosin heads move in a coordinated style; they swivel toward the center of the sarcomere, detach, and then reattach to the nearest active site of the actin filament. This is called a ratchet-type drive system.

This process consumes large amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy source of the cell. ATP binds to the cross-bridges between myosin heads and actin filaments. The release of energy powers the swiveling of the myosin head. When ATP is used, it becomes adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and since muscles store little ATP, they must continuously replace the discharged ADP with ATP. Muscle tissue also contains a stored supply of a fast-acting recharge chemical, creatine phosphate, which when necessary can assist with the rapid regeneration of ADP into ATP.

Calcium ions are required for each cycle of the sarcomere. Calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcomere when a muscle is stimulated to contract. This calcium uncovers the actin-binding sites. When the muscle no longer needs to contract, the calcium ions are pumped from the sarcomere and back into storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

There are approximately 639 skeletal muscles in the human body.

=== Cardiac ===

Heart muscle is striated muscle but is distinct from skeletal muscle because the muscle fibers are laterally connected. Furthermore, just as with smooth muscles, their movement is involuntary. Heart muscle is controlled by the sinus node influenced by the autonomic nervous system.

=== Smooth ===

Smooth muscle contraction is regulated by the autonomic nervous system, hormones, and local chemical signals, allowing for gradual and sustained contractions. This type of muscle tissue is also capable of adapting to different levels of stretch and tension, which is important for maintaining proper blood flow and the movement of materials through the digestive system.

== Physiology ==
=== Contraction ===
Neuromuscular junctions are the focal point where a motor neuron attaches to a muscle. Acetylcholine, (a neurotransmitter used in skeletal muscle contraction) is released from the axon terminal of the nerve cell when an action potential reaches the microscopic junction called a synapse. A group of chemical messengers across the synapse and stimulate the formation of electrical changes, which are produced in the muscle cell when the acetylcholine binds to receptors on its surface. Calcium is released from its storage area in the cell&#x27;s sarcoplasmic reticulum. An impulse from a nerve cell causes calcium release and brings about a single, short muscle contraction called a muscle twitch. If there is a problem at the neuromuscular junction, a very prolonged contraction may occur, such as the muscle contractions that result from tetanus. Also, a loss of function at the junction can produce paralysis.

Skeletal muscles are organized into hundreds of motor units, each of which involves a motor neuron, attached by a series of thin finger-like structures called axon terminals. These attach to and control discrete bundles of muscle fibers. A coordinated and fine-tuned response to a specific circumstance will involve controlling the precise number of motor units used. While individual muscle units&#x27; contract as a unit, the entire muscle can contract on a predetermined basis due to the structure of the motor unit. Motor unit coordination, balance, and control frequently come under the direction of the cerebellum of the brain. This allows for complex muscular coordination with little conscious effort, such as when one drives a car without thinking about the process.

=== Tendon ===

A tendon is a piece of connective tissue that connects a muscle to a bone. When a muscle intercepts, it pulls against the skeleton to create movement. A tendon connects this muscle to a bone, making this function possible.

=== Aerobic and anaerobic muscle activity ===
At rest, the body produces the majority of its ATP aerobically in the mitochondria without producing lactic acid or other fatiguing byproducts. During exercise, the method of ATP production varies depending on the fitness of the individual as well as the duration and intensity of exercise. At lower activity levels, when exercise continues for a long duration (several minutes or longer), energy is produced aerobically by combining oxygen with carbohydrates and fats stored in the body.

During activity that is higher in intensity, with possible duration decreasing as intensity increases, ATP production can switch to anaerobic pathways, such as the use of the creatine phosphate and the phosphagen system or anaerobic glycolysis. Aerobic ATP production is biochemically much slower and can only be used for long-duration, low-intensity exercise, but produces no fatiguing waste products that cannot be removed immediately from the sarcomere and the body, and it results in a much greater number of ATP molecules per fat or carbohydrate molecule. Aerobic training allows the oxygen delivery system to be more efficient, allowing aerobic metabolism to begin quicker. Anaerobic ATP production produces ATP much faster and allows near-maximal intensity exercise, but also produces significant amounts of lactic acid which render high-intensity exercise unsustainable for more than several minutes. The phosphagen system is also anaerobic. It allows for the highest levels of exercise intensity, but intramuscular stores of phosphocreatine are very limited and can only provide energy for exercises lasting up to ten seconds. Recovery is very quick, with full creatine stores regenerated within five minutes.

== Clinical significance ==

Multiple diseases can affect the muscular system.

=== Muscular Dystrophy ===

Muscular dystrophy is a group of disorders associated with progressive muscle weakness and loss of muscle mass. These disorders are caused by mutations in a person&#x27;s genes. The disease affects between 19.8 and 25.1 per 100,000 person-years globally.

There are more than 30 types of muscular dystrophy. Depending on the type, muscular dystrophy can affect the patient&#x27;s heart and lungs, and/or their ability to move, walk, and perform daily activities. The most common types include:

* Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD)
* Myotonic dystrophy
* Limb-Girdle (LGMD)
* Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD)
* Congenital dystrophy (CMD)
* Distal (DD)
* Oculopharyngeal dystrophy (OPMD)
* Emery-Dreifuss (EDMD)

<doc id="159749" wikidata="Q817298" url="?curid=159749" title="Benign fasciculation syndrome">
<text>Benign fasciculation syndrome (BFS) is characterized by fasciculation (twitching) of voluntary muscles in the body. The twitching can occur in any voluntary muscle group but is most common in the eyelids, arms, hands, fingers, legs, and feet. The tongue can also be affected. The twitching may be occasional to continuous. BFS must be distinguished from other conditions that include muscle twitches.

==Signs and symptoms==
The main symptom of benign fasciculation syndrome is focal or widespread involuntary muscle activity (fasciculation). The benign twitches usually have a constant location.

Other common symptoms are generalized fatigue or weakness, paraesthesia or numbness, and muscle cramping or spasms. Anxiety and somatic symptom disorders and symptoms are commonly reported. Muscle stiffness may also be present; if muscle weakness is not also present, and cramps are more severe, the stiffness may be categorized instead as cramp fasciculation syndrome. Cramp fasciculation is a variant of BFS which presents with muscle pain and exercise intolerance.

==Causes==
Health anxiety disorder may be a cause among individuals who become concerned they have a motor neuron disease; this persistent concern is a psychiatric condition mostly noted among healthcare professionals and doctors. An association with anxiety level is established; BFS is reportedly found among &quot;anxious medical students&quot; and clinicians under the age of 40, and this phenomenon known as &quot;fasciculation anxiety syndrome&quot; is reinforced by access to information on the internet.

Fasciculations can be caused or worsened by intense and long periods of daily exercise.

BFS can also be caused by long-term use of anticholinergics, and fasciculations may be caused by other drug use or exposure to steroids, nicotine, caffeine, alcohol, insecticides and pesticides. Thyroid disease may also cause similar symptoms.

Fasciculations can also be caused by deficiencies of magnesium and/or calcium.

==Diagnosis==
Benign fasciculation syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion; that is, other potential causes for the twitching must be ruled out before BFS can be diagnosed. Diagnosis includes blood tests, a neurological exam, and electromyography (EMG).

Another step in diagnosing BFS is checking for clinical weakness or wasting, which are found in more serious conditions. Lack of clinical weakness along with normal EMG results (in those with only fasciculations) largely eliminates more serious disorders from potential diagnosis. In younger people with only lower motor neuron (LMN) fasciculations, no muscle weakness, and no thyroid abnormalities, Turner and Talbot (2013) state that &quot;individuals under 40 years can be reassured without resorting to electromyography (EMG) to avoid the small but highly damaging possibility of false-positives&quot;.

According to Kincaid (1997), the diagnosis is made when there is no clinical finding of neurogenic disease; he first reassures patients that no &quot;ominous disease seems to be present&quot;, and says, &quot;I suggest that patients like this be followed for a year or longer with clinical and electromyographic exams at about 6-month intervals before one becomes secure in the diagnosis that the fasciculations are truly benign.&quot; Other publications recommend followups for four or five years before ruling the condition benign, although the percentage of individuals who progress to a more serious condition is very low.

===Classification===
Benign fasciculation syndrome and the variant cramp fasciculation syndrome &quot;can be regarded as part of a larger spectrum of disease that also incorporates acquired auto-immune neuromyotonia.

===Differential===
Other serious diseases that must be distinguished include motor neuron diseases (MND) such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), neuropathy, and spinal cord diseases.

According to Turner and Talbot (2013), &quot;the fasciculations of MND are often abrupt and widespread at onset in an individual previously unaffected by fasciculations in youth. The site of the fasciculations, for example, those in the calves versus abdomen, has not been shown to be discriminatory for a benign disorder. There is conflicting evidence as to whether the character of fasciculations differs neurophysiologically in MND.&quot; It is &quot;exceptionally rare for patients later diagnosed with ALS to present with fasciculations alone&quot;, and ALS is ruled out with a normal EMG and no evidence of muscle wasting.

==Treatment==
There is support for treating any accompanying anxiety using cognitive behavioral therapy or antidepressants. Quinine is effective, but not recommended because of the potential for serious side effects. Calcium channel blockers may be effective, although the evidence for their use is weak. There is little evidence supporting other therapies.

In cases caused by magnesium or calcium deficiencies, curing the deficiency through diet or supplementation is effective.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for those with BFS is good to excellent.

==Research==
There may be an association between widespread fasciculations or paresthesias with small fiber neuropathy.

A 2017 study by Neurology.org also found that Benign Fasciculations are common in the general population, occurring in about 70% of healthy individuals and almost never associated with a serious neuromuscular disorder. Of patients that enrolled in a 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 month study, perceived weakness was reported in 35.3%, 47.1% experienced numbness, 70.6% had tingling, cramps were present in 64.7% and after 24 months, only 5% had their symptoms resolved. Of all the patients, none developed Motor Neuron Disease.

<text>Pectin ( &quot;&quot;: &quot;congealed&quot; and &quot;curdled&quot;) is a heteropolysaccharide, a structural polymer contained in the primary lamella, in the middle lamella, and in the cell walls of terrestrial plants. The principal chemical component of pectin is galacturonic acid (a sugar acid derived from galactose) which was isolated and described by Henri Braconnot in 1825. Commercially produced pectin is a white-to-light-brown powder, produced from citrus fruits for use as an edible gelling agent, especially in jams and jellies, dessert fillings, medications, and sweets; as a food stabiliser in fruit juices and milk drinks, and as a source of dietary fiber.

== Biology ==
Pectin is composed of complex polysaccharides that are present in the primary cell walls of a plant, and are abundant in the green parts of terrestrial plants.
Pectin is the principal component of the middle lamella, where it binds cells. Pectin is deposited by exocytosis into the cell wall via vesicles produced in the Golgi apparatus. The amount, structure and chemical composition of pectin is different among plants, within a plant over time, and in various parts of a plant. Pectin is an important cell wall polysaccharide that allows primary cell wall extension and plant growth. During fruit ripening, pectin is broken down by the enzymes pectinase and pectinesterase, in which process the fruit becomes softer as the middle lamellae break down and cells become separated from each other. A similar process of cell separation caused by the breakdown of pectin occurs in the abscission zone of the petioles of deciduous plants at leaf fall.

Pectin is a natural part of the human , but does not contribute significantly to . The daily intake of pectin from fruits and vegetables can be estimated to be around 5 g if approximately 500 g of fruits and vegetables are consumed per day.

In human digestion, pectin binds to cholesterol in the gastrointestinal tract and slows glucose absorption by trapping carbohydrates. Pectin is thus a soluble dietary fiber. In non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice pectin has been shown to increase the incidence of autoimmune type 1 diabetes.

A study found that after consumption of fruit the concentration of methanol in the human body increased by as much as an order of magnitude due to the degradation of natural pectin (which is esterified with methanol) in the colon.

Pectin has been observed to have some function in repairing the DNA of some types of plant seeds, usually desert plants. Pectinaceous surface pellicles, which are rich in pectin, create a mucilage layer that holds in dew that helps the cell repair its DNA.

Consumption of pectin has been shown to slightly (3–7%) reduce blood LDL cholesterol levels. The effect depends upon the source of pectin; apple and citrus pectins were more effective than orange pulp fibre pectin. The mechanism appears to be an increase of viscosity in the intestinal tract, leading to a reduced absorption of cholesterol from bile or food. In the large intestine and colon, microorganisms degrade pectin and liberate short-chain fatty acids that have a positive prebiotic effect.

==Chemistry==

Pectins, also known as pectic polysaccharides, are rich in galacturonic acid. Several distinct polysaccharides have been identified and characterised within the pectic group. Homogalacturonans are linear chains of α-(1–4)-linked -galacturonic acid. Substituted galacturonans are characterised by the presence of saccharide appendant residues (such as -xylose or -apiose in the respective cases of xylogalacturonan and apiogalacturonan) branching from a backbone of -galacturonic acid residues. Rhamnogalacturonan I pectins (RG-I) contain a backbone of the repeating disaccharide: 4)-α--galacturonic acid-(1,2)-α--rhamnose-(1. From many of the rhamnose residues, sidechains of various neutral sugars branch off. The neutral sugars are mainly -galactose, -arabinose and -xylose, with the types and proportions of neutral sugars varying with the origin of pectin.

Another structural type of pectin is rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II), which is a less frequent, complex, highly branched polysaccharide. Rhamnogalacturonan II is classified by some authors within the group of substituted galacturonans since the rhamnogalacturonan II backbone is made exclusively of -galacturonic acid units.

The molecular weight of isolated pectine greatly varies by the source and the method of isolation. Values have been reported as low as 28 kDa for apple pomace up to 753 kDa for sweet potato peels.

In nature, around 80 percent of carboxyl groups of galacturonic acid are esterified with methanol. This proportion is decreased to a varying degree during pectin extraction. Pectins are classified as high- versus low-methoxy pectins (short HM-pectins versus LM-pectins), with more or less than half of all the galacturonic acid esterified. The ratio of esterified to non-esterified galacturonic acid determines the behaviour of pectin in food applications – HM-pectins can form a gel under acidic conditions in the presence of high sugar concentrations, while LM-pectins form gels by interaction with divalent cations, particularly Ca2+, according to the idealized &#x27;egg box&#x27; model, in which ionic bridges are formed between calcium ions and the ionised carboxyl groups of the galacturonic acid.

In high-methoxy pectins at soluble solids content above 60% and a pH value between 2.8 and 3.6, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions bind the individual pectin chains together. These bonds form as water is bound by sugar and forces pectin strands to stick together. These form a three-dimensional molecular net that creates the macromolecular gel. The gelling-mechanism is called a low-water-activity gel or sugar-acid-pectin gel.

While low-methoxy pectins need calcium to form a gel, they can do so at lower soluble solids and higher pH than high-methoxy pectins. Normally low-methoxy pectins form gels with a range of pH from 2.6 to 7.0 and with a soluble solids content between 10 and 70%.

The non-esterified galacturonic acid units can be either free acids (carboxyl groups) or salts with sodium, potassium, or calcium. The salts of partially esterified pectins are called pectinates, if the degree of esterification is below 5 percent the salts are called pectates, the insoluble acid form, pectic acid.

Some plants, such as sugar beet, potatoes and pears, contain pectins with acetylated galacturonic acid in addition to methyl esters. Acetylation prevents gel-formation but increases the stabilising and emulsifying effects of pectin.

Amidated pectin is a modified form of pectin. Here, some of the galacturonic acid is converted with ammonia to carboxylic acid amide. These pectins are more tolerant of varying calcium concentrations that occur in use.

Thiolated pectin exhibits substantially improved gelling properties since this thiomer is able to crosslink via disulfide bond formation. These high gelling properties are advantageous for various pharmaceutical applications and applications in food industry.

To prepare a pectin-gel, the ingredients are heated, dissolving the pectin. Upon cooling below gelling temperature, a gel starts to form. If gel formation is too strong, syneresis or a granular texture are the result, while weak gelling leads to excessively soft gels.

Amidated pectins behave like low-ester pectins but need less calcium and are more tolerant of excess calcium. Also, gels from amidated pectin are thermoreversible; they can be heated and after cooling solidify again, whereas conventional pectin-gels will afterwards remain liquid.

High-ester pectins set at higher temperatures than low-ester pectins. However, gelling reactions with calcium increase as the degree of esterification falls. Similarly, lower pH-values or higher soluble solids (normally sugars) increase gelling speeds. Suitable pectins can therefore be selected for jams and jellies, or for higher-sugar confectionery jellies.

== Sources and production ==
Pears, apples, guavas, quince, plums, gooseberries, and oranges and other citrus fruits contain large amounts of pectin, while soft fruits, like cherries, grapes, and strawberries, contain small amounts of pectin.

Typical levels of pectin in fresh fruits and vegetables are:
* Apples, 1–1.5%
* Apricots, 1%
* Cherries, 0.4%
* Oranges, 0.5–3.5%
* Carrots 1.4%
* Citrus peels, 30%
* Rose hips, 15%
The main raw materials for pectin production are dried citrus peels or apple pomace, both by-products of juice production. Pomace from sugar beets is also used to a small extent.

From these materials, pectin is extracted by adding hot dilute acid at pH values from 1.5 to 3.5. During several hours of extraction, the protopectin loses some of its branching and chain length and goes into solution. After filtering, the extract is concentrated in a vacuum and the pectin is then precipitated by adding ethanol or isopropanol. An old technique of precipitating pectin with aluminium salts is no longer used (apart from alcohols and polyvalent cations, pectin also precipitates with proteins and detergents).

Alcohol-precipitated pectin is then separated, washed, and dried. Treating the initial pectin with dilute acid leads to low-esterified pectins. When this process includes ammonium hydroxide (NH3(aq)), amidated pectins are obtained. After drying and milling, pectin is usually standardised with sugar, and sometimes calcium salts or organic acids, to optimise performance in a particular application.

==Uses==
The main use for pectin is as a gelling agent, thickening agent and stabiliser in food.

In some countries, pectin is also available as a solution or an extract, or as a blended powder, for home jam making.

The classical application is giving the jelly-like consistency to jams or marmalades, which would otherwise be sweet juices. Pectin also reduces syneresis in jams and marmalades and increases the gel strength of low-calorie jams. For household use, pectin is an ingredient in gelling sugar (also known as &quot;jam sugar&quot;) where it is diluted to the right concentration with sugar and some citric acid to adjust pH.

For various food applications, different kinds of pectins can be distinguished by their properties, such as acidity, degree of esterification, relative number of methoxyl groups in the molecules, etc. For instance, the term &quot;high methoxyl&quot; refers to pectins that have a large proportion of the carboxyl groups in the pectin molecule that are esterified with methanol, compared to low methoxyl pectins:
* high methoxyl pectins are defined as those with a degree of esterification equal to or above 50, are typically used in traditional jam and jelly making; such pectins require high sugar concentrations and acidic conditions to form gels, and provide a smooth texture and suitable to be used in bakery fillings and confectionery applications;
* low methoxyl pectins have a degree of esterification of less than 50, can be either amidated or non-amidated: the percentage level of substitution of the amide group, defined as the degree of amidation, defines the efficacy of a pectin; low methoxyl pectins can provide a range of textures and rheological properties, depending on the calcium concentration and the calcium reactivity of the pectin chosen—amidated low methoxyl pectins are generally thermoreversible, meaning they can form gels that can melt and reform, whereas non-amidated low methoxyl pectins can form thermostable gels that withstand high temperatures; these properties make low methoxyl pectins suitable for low sugar and sugar-free applications, dairy products, and stabilizing acidic protein drinks.

For conventional jams and marmalades that contain above 60% sugar and soluble fruit solids, high-ester (high methoxyl) pectins are used. With low-ester (low methoxyl) pectins and amidated pectins, less sugar is needed, so that diet products can be made. Water extract of aiyu seeds is traditionally used in Taiwan to make aiyu jelly, where the extract gels without heating due to low-ester pectins from the seeds and the bivalent cations from the water.

Pectin is used in confectionery jellies to give a good gel structure, a clean bite and to confer a good flavour release. Pectin can also be used to stabilise acidic protein drinks, such as drinking yogurt, to improve the mouth-feel and the pulp stability in juice based drinks and as a fat substitute in baked goods.

Typical levels of pectin used as a food additive are between 0.5 and 1.0% – this is about the same amount of pectin as in fresh fruit.

In medicine, pectin increases viscosity and volume of stool so that it is used against constipation and diarrhea. Until 2002, it was one of the main ingredients used in Kaopectate – a medication to combat diarrhea – along with kaolinite. It has been used in gentle heavy metal removal from biological systems. Pectin is also used in throat lozenges as a demulcent.

In cosmetic products, pectin acts as a stabiliser. Pectin is also used in wound healing preparations and speciality medical adhesives, such as colostomy devices.

Sriamornsak revealed that pectin could be used in various oral drug delivery platforms, e.g., controlled release systems, gastro-retentive systems, colon-specific delivery systems and mucoadhesive delivery systems, according to its intoxicity and low cost. It was found that pectin from different sources provides different gelling abilities, due to variations in molecular size and chemical composition. Like other natural polymers, a major problem with pectin is inconsistency in reproducibility between samples, which may result in poor reproducibility in drug delivery characteristics.

In ruminant nutrition, depending on the extent of lignification of the cell wall, pectin is up to 90% digestible by bacterial enzymes. Ruminant nutritionists recommend that the digestibility and energy concentration in forages be improved by increasing pectin concentration in the forage.

In cigars, pectin is considered an excellent substitute for vegetable glue and many cigar smokers and collectors use pectin for repairing damaged tobacco leaves on their cigars.

Yablokov &quot;et al.&quot;, writing in &quot;&quot;, quote research conducted by the Ukrainian Center of Radiation Medicine and the Belarusian Institute of Radiation Medicine and Endocrinology, concluded, regarding pectin&#x27;s radioprotective effects, that &quot;adding pectin preparations to the food of inhabitants of the Chernobyl-contaminated regions promotes an effective excretion of incorporated radionuclides&quot; such as cesium-137. The authors reported on the positive results of using pectin food additive preparations in a number of clinical studies conducted on children in severely polluted areas, with up to 50% improvement over control groups.
During the Second World War, Allied pilots were provided with maps printed on silk, for navigation in escape and evasion efforts. The printing process at first proved nearly impossible because the several layers of ink immediately ran, blurring outlines and rendering place names illegible until the inventor of the maps, Clayton Hutton, mixed a little pectin with the ink and at once the pectin coagulated the ink and prevented it from running, allowing small topographic features to be clearly visible.

==Legal status==
At the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee Report on Food Additives and in the European Union, no numerical acceptable daily intake (ADI) has been set, as pectin is considered safe.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union (EU) has not set a daily intake limit for two types of pectin, known as E440(i) and Amidated Pectin E440(ii). The EU has established purity standards for these additives in the EU Commission Regulation (EU)/231/2012. Pectin can be used as needed in most food categories, a concept referred to as &quot;quantum satis&quot;. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) conducted a re-evaluation of Pectin E440(i) and Amidated Pectin E440(ii) in 2017. The EFSA concluded that the use of these food additives poses no safety concern for the general population. Furthermore, the agency stated that it is not necessary to establish a numerical value for the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI).

In the United States, pectin is generally recognised as safe for human consumption.

In the International Numbering System (INS), pectin has the number 440. In Europe, pectins are differentiated into the E numbers E440(i) for non-amidated pectins and E440(ii) for amidated pectins. There are specifications in all national and international legislation defining its quality and regulating its use.

==History==
Pectin was first isolated and described in 1825 by Henri Braconnot, though the action of pectin to make jams and marmalades was known long before. To obtain well-set jams from fruits that had little or only poor quality pectin, pectin-rich fruits or their extracts were mixed into the recipe.

During the Industrial Revolution, the makers of fruit preserves turned to producers of apple juice to obtain dried apple pomace that was cooked to extract pectin. Later, in the 1920s and 1930s, factories were built that commercially extracted pectin from dried apple pomace, and later citrus peel, in regions that produced apple juice in both the US and Europe.

Pectin was first sold as a liquid extract, but is now most often used as dried powder, which is easier than a liquid to store and handle.

<text>Sir Jacobus van Meteren (1519–1555) was the financier and printer of early English versions of the Bible. He was involved in the printing of an edition of Tyndale&#x27;s New Testament in 1535 (Herbert #15). The Coverdale Bible of 1535 (Herbert #18) may also have been his work. He may also have printed the Matthew Bible of 1537 (Herbert #34), the combined work of William Tyndale, Myles Coverdale and John Rogers. It is unknown if he was the only financier, printer or publisher of these works, or one of several.

He was born at Breda, but there has been some debate over the details of his life from the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;:

:In 1877 Henry Stevens, in his catalogue of the Caxton Exhibition, pointed out a statement by a certain Simeon Ruytinck in his life of Emanuel van Meteren, appended to the latter&#x27;s &quot;Nederlandische Historic&quot; (16,4), that Jacob van Meteren, the father of Emanuel, had manifested great zeal in producing at Antwerp a translation of the Bible into English, and had employed for that purpose a certain learned scholar named Miles Conerdale (sic).

:In 1884 further evidence was adduced by W. J. C. Moens, who reprinted an affidavit signed by Emanuel van Meteren, 28 May 1609, to the effect that &quot;he was brought to England anno 1550 . . . by his father, a furtherer of reformed religion, and he that caused the first Bible at his costes to be Englisshed by Mr Myles Coverdal in Andwarp, the w&#x27;h his father, with Mr Edward Whytchurch, printed both in Paris and London&quot; (&quot;Registers of the Dutch Reformed Church&quot;, Austin Friars, 1884, p. xiv).

:Apart from the reference to Whytchurch and the place of printing, this statement agrees with that of Simeon Ruytinck, and it is possible that Van Meteren showed his zeal in the matter by undertaking the cost of printing the work as well as that of remunerating the translator. Mr W. Aldis Wright, however, judging from the facts that the name of Whytchurch was introduced, that the places of printing were given as London and Paris, not Antwerp, and lastly that Emanuel van Meteren being born in 1535 could only have derived his knowledge from hearsay, is inclined to think that the Bible in which J. van Meteren was interested &quot;was Matthew&#x27;s of 1537 or the Great Bible of 1539, and not Coverdale&#x27;s of 1535&quot;.

Since the discovery of Guido Latré in 1997, it is believed that Emanuel van Meteren&#x27;s affidavit of 1609 refers to the printing of the Coverdale Bible in 1535, when his father employed Myles Coverdale as translator. It could also refer to the Matthew Bible of 1537. The names of Grafton and Whitchurch are associated with the Matthew Bible, not the Coverdale Bible.

Rogers married J. van Meteren&#x27;s niece, Adriana de Weyden, the same year that the Matthew Bible was published. If J. van Meteren was the printer of the Coverdale Bible, he would readily have been able to provide Rogers with Coverdale&#x27;s prior work covering those books of the Old Testament which Tyndale had not had time to translate.

<text>In philosophy, a core ontology is a basic and minimal ontology consisting only of the minimal concepts required to understand the other concepts. It must be based on a core glossary in some human language so humans can comprehend the concepts and distinctions made. Each natural language tends to rely on its own conceptual metaphor structure, and so tends to have its own core ontology (according to W. V. Quine). It could be said also to represent the moral core of a human linguistic culture, and to self-correct so as to better represent core cultural ideas.

Such a core ontology is a key pre-requisite to a more complete foundation ontology, or a more general philosophical sense of ontology. Most applicable to teaching, e.g. the Longmans defining dictionary of the simplest meanings of 2,000 English words is used to define the 4,000 most basic English idioms—this is a core glossary of the English language, which permits access to the core ontology (the idioms).

Core ontologies is a concept that is used in information science as well. For example, CIDOC-CRM and CORA are considered as core ontologies.

<doc id="159765" wikidata="Q35342" url="?curid=159765" title="Lake Titicaca">
<text>Lake Titicaca (; ; ) is a large freshwater lake in the Andes mountains on the border of Bolivia and Peru. It is often called the highest navigable lake in the world. Titicaca is the largest lake in South America, both in terms of the volume of water and surface area. It has a surface elevation of .

==Overview==

The lake is located at the northern end of the endorheic Altiplano basin high in the Andes on the border of Peru and Bolivia. The western part of the lake lies within the Puno Region of Peru, and the eastern side is located in the Bolivian La Paz Department.

The lake consists of two nearly separate subbasins connected by the Strait of Tiquina, which is across at the narrowest point. The larger subbasin, &quot;Lago Grande&quot; (also called &quot;Lago Chucuito&quot;), has a mean depth of and a maximum depth of . The smaller subbasin, Wiñaymarka (also called &quot;Lago Pequeño&quot;, &quot;little lake&quot;), has an average depth of and a maximum depth of . The overall average depth of the lake is .

Five major river systems feed into Lake Titicaca. In order of their relative flow volumes, these are Ramis, Coata, Ilave, Huancané, and Suchez. More than 20 other smaller streams empty into Titicaca. The lake has 41 islands, some of which are densely populated.

Having only a single season of free circulation, the lake is monomictic, and water passes through Lago Huiñaimarca and flows out the single outlet at the Río Desaguadero, which then flows south through Bolivia to Lake Poopó. This only accounts for about 10% of the lake&#x27;s water balance. Evapotranspiration, caused by strong winds and intense sunlight at high altitude, balances the remaining 90% of the water loss. It is nearly a closed lake.

Since 2000, Lake Titicaca has experienced constantly receding water levels. Between April and November 2009 alone, the water level dropped by , reaching the lowest level since 1949. This drop is caused by shortened rainy seasons and the melting of glaciers feeding the tributaries of the lake. Water pollution is also an increasing concern because cities in the Titicaca watershed grow, sometimes outpacing solid waste and sewage treatment infrastructure. According to the Global Nature Fund (GNF), Titicaca&#x27;s biodiversity is threatened by water pollution and the introduction of new species by humans. A 2011 United Nations report found alarming concentrations of cadmium, arsenic, and lead in various parts of the lake. In 2012, the GNF nominated the lake &quot;Threatened Lake of the Year&quot;.

==Name==

Given the various Indigenous groups that occupied the Lake Titicaca region, it likely lacked a single, commonly accepted name in prehistoric times and at the time the Spaniards arrived.

The terms &quot;titi&quot; and &quot;caca&quot; can be translated in several ways. In Aymara, &quot;titi&quot; can be translated as either puma, lead, or a heavy metal. The word &quot;caca&quot; (&quot;kaka&quot;) can be translated as white or grey hairs of the head and the term &quot;k’ak’a&quot; can be translated as either crack or fissure, or alternatively, comb of a bird. According to Weston La Barre, the Aymara considered in 1948 that the proper name of the lake is &quot;titiq’aq’a,&quot; which means gray, discolored, lead-colored puma. This phrase refers to the sacred carved rock found on the Isla del Sol. In addition to names including the term &quot;titi&quot; and/or &quot;caca,&quot; Lake Titicaca was also known as &quot;Chuquivitu&quot; in the 16th century. This name can be loosely translated as lance point. This name survives in modern usage in which the large lake is occasionally referred to as &quot;Lago Chucuito.&quot;

Stanish argues that the logical explanation for the origin of the name Titicaca is a corruption of the term &quot;thakhsi cala,&quot; which is the 15th- to the 16th-century name of the sacred rock on the Isla del Sol. Given the lack of a common name for Lake Titicaca in the 16th century, the Spaniards are thought to have used the name of the site of the most important indigenous shrine in the region, &quot;thakhsi cala&quot; on the Isla del Sol, as the name for the lake. In time and with usage, this name developed into &quot;Titicaca.&quot;

Locally, the lake goes by several names. The southeast quarter of the lake is separate from the main body (connected only by the Strait of Tiquina) and the Bolivians call it Lago Huiñaymarca (also Wiñay Marka, which in Aymara means the Eternal City) and the larger part Lago Chucuito. The large lake also is occasionally referred to as Lago Mayor, and the small lake as Lago Menor. In Peru, these smaller and larger parts are referred to as Lago Pequeño and Lago Grande, respectively.

==Highest Lake==
With a surface area of and an elevation of , Lake Titicaca is often called the highest navigable lake in the world. That claim is generally considered to refer to commercial craft. Numerous smaller lakes around the world are at higher elevations, such as the crater lake of Ojos del Salado, which at an elevation of is the overall highest lake in the world, and the Lake Puma Yumco, which at an elevation of is the highest large lake in the world. For many years, the largest vessel afloat on Lake Titicaca was the 2,200-ton (2,425 U.S. tons), SS &quot;Ollanta&quot;. Today, the largest vessel is most likely the similarly sized train barge/float &quot;Manco Capac&quot;, operated by PeruRail.

==Temperature==
The cold sources and winds over the lake give it an average surface temperature of . In the winter (June – September), mixing occurs with the deeper waters, which are always between .

==Ecology==

Lake Titicaca is home to more than 530 aquatic species.
 The lake holds large populations of water birds and was designated as a Ramsar Site on August 26, 1998. It has also been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA), in both Bolivia and Peru, by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of many bird species. Several threatened species such as the huge Titicaca water frog and the flightless Titicaca grebe are largely or entirely restricted to the lake. 

In addition to the threatened Titicaca grebe, some of the birds associated with water at Titicaca are the white-tufted grebe, Puna ibis, Chilean flamingo, Andean gull, Andean lapwing, white-backed stilt, greater yellowlegs, snowy egret, black-crowned night-heron, Andean coot, common gallinule, plumbeous rail, various ducks, wren-like rushbird, many-colored rush-tyrant, and yellow-winged blackbird.

The Titicaca orestias has likely become extinct (last seen in 1938) due to competition and predation by the introduced rainbow trout and the silverside &quot;Odontesthes bonariensis&quot;. In addition to the Titicaca orestias, native fish species in the lake&#x27;s basin are other species of &quot;Orestias&quot;, and the catfish &quot;Trichomycterus dispar&quot;, &quot;T. rivulatus&quot;, and &quot;Astroblepus stuebeli&quot; (the last species not in the lake itself, but in associated ecosystems). The many &quot;Orestias&quot; species in Lake Titicaca differ significantly in both habitat preference and feeding behavior. About 90% of the fish species in the basin are endemic, including 23 species of &quot;Orestias&quot; that only are found in the lake.
Titicaca is home to 24 described species of freshwater snails (15 endemics, including several tiny &quot;Heleobia&quot; spp.) and less than half a dozen bivalves (all in family Sphaeriidae), but in general these are very poorly known and their taxonomy is in need of a review. The lake also has an endemic species flock of amphipods consisting of 11 &quot;Hyalella&quot; (an additional Titicaca &quot;Hyalella&quot; species is nonendemic).

Reeds and other aquatic vegetation are widespread in Lake Titicaca. Totora sedges grow in water shallower than , less frequently to , but macrophytes, notably &quot;Chara&quot; and &quot;Potamogeton&quot;, occur down to . In sheltered shallow waters, such as the harbour of Puno, &quot;Azolla&quot;, &quot;Elodea&quot;, &quot;Lemna&quot; and &quot;Myriophyllum&quot; are common.

==Geology==

The Tinajani Basin, in which Lake Titicaca lies, is an intermontane basin. This basin is a pull-apart basin created by strike-slip movement along regional faults starting in the late Oligocene and ending in the late Miocene. The initial development of the Tinajani Basin is indicated by volcanic rocks, which accumulated between 27 and 20 million years ago within this basin. They lie upon an angular unconformity which cuts across pre-basin strata. Lacustrine sediments of the Lower Tinajani Formation, which are exposed within the Tinajani Basin, demonstrate the presence of a pre-Quaternary, ancestral Lake Titicaca within it between 18 and 14 million years ago (Mya). Little is known about the prehistory of Lake Titicaca between 14 Mya and 370,000 BP because the lake sediments dating to this period lie buried beneath the bottom of Lake Titicaca and have not yet been sampled by continuous coring.

The Lake Titicaca drilling project recovered a 136-m-long drill core of sediments from the bottom of Lake Titicaca at a depth of and at a location just east of Isla del Sol. This core contains a continuous record of lake sedimentation and paleoenvironmental conditions for Lake Titicaca back to about 370,000 BP. For this period of time, Lake Titicaca was typically fresher and had higher lake levels during periods of expanded regional glaciation that corresponded to global glacial periods. During periods of reduced regional glaciation that corresponded to global interglacial periods, Lake Titicaca had typically low lake levels.

Lacustrine sediments and associated terraces provide evidence for the past existence of five major prehistoric lakes that occupied the Tinajani Basin during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. Within the northern Altiplano (Tinajani Basin), these prehistoric lakes were Lake Mataro at an elevation of , Lake Cabana at an elevation of , Lake Ballivián at an elevation of , Lake (North) Minchin at an elevation of , and Lake (North) Tauca at an elevation . The age of Lake Mataro is uncertain—it may date back to the Late Pliocene. Lake Cabana possibly dates to the Middle Pleistocene. Lake Ballivián existed between 120,000 and 98,000 BP. Two high lake stands, between 72,000 and 68,000 BP and 44,000–34,000 BP, have been discerned for Lake Minchin within the Altiplano. Another ancient lake in the area is Ouki. The high lake levels of Lake Tauca have been dated as having occurred between 18,100 and 14,100 BP.

==Underwater archaeology==
Underwater excavations and surveys in and around Khoa reef, near the Island of Khoa, have recovered thousands of artifacts. These artifacts consist of ceramic feline incense burners, carved juvenile llamas, and well-crafted metal, shell, and stone ornaments. During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Lake Titicaca was a mythical place and the location of a pilgrimage complex for the Incas. Part of this complex included Khoa reef as a location where offerings were dropped into the lake.

==Climate==
Lake Titicaca has a borderline subtropical highland/alpine climate with cool to cold temperatures for most of the year. The average annual precipitation is 610 mm (24 in) mostly falling in summer thunderstorms. Winters are dry with very cold nights and mornings and warm afternoons. Below are the average temperatures of the town of Juliaca, in the northern part of the lake.

==Islands==

===Uros===


The &quot;Floating Islands&quot; are small, human-made islands constructed by the Uros (or Uru) people from layers of cut totora, a thick, buoyant sedge that grows abundantly in the shallows of Lake Titicaca. The Uros harvest the sedges that naturally grow on the lake&#x27;s banks to make the islands by continuously adding sedges to the surface.

According to legend, the Uru people originated in the Amazon and migrated to the area of Lake Titicaca in the pre-Columbian era, where they were oppressed by the local population and were unable to secure land of their own. They built the sedge islands, which could be moved into deep water or to different parts of the lake, as necessary, for greater safety from their hostile neighbors on land.

Golden in color, many of the islands measure about , and the largest are roughly half the size of a football field. Each island contains several thatched houses, typically belonging to members of a single extended family. Some of the islands have watchtowers and other buildings, also constructed of sedges.

Historically, most of the Uros islands were located near the middle of the lake, about from the shore; however, in 1986, after a major storm devastated the islands, many Uros rebuilt closer to shore. , about 1,200 Uros lived on an archipelago of 60 artificial islands, clustering in the western corner of the lake near Puno, Titicaca&#x27;s major Peruvian port town. The islands have become one of Peru&#x27;s tourist attractions, allowing the Uros to supplement their hunting and fishing by conveying visitors to the islands by motorboat and selling handicrafts.

===Amantani===
Amantani is another small island on Lake Titicaca populated by Quechua speakers. About 4,000 people live in 10 communities on the roughly circular island. Two mountain peaks, called Pachatata (Father Earth) and Pachamama (Mother Earth) and ancient ruins are on the top of both peaks. The hillsides that rise up from the lake are terraced and planted with wheat, potatoes, and vegetables. Most of the small fields are worked by hand. Long stone fences divide the fields, and cattle and sheep graze on the hillsides.

No cars and no hotels are on the island. Since machines are not allowed on the island, all agriculture is done by hand. A few small stores sell basic goods, and a health clinic and six schools are found. Electricity was produced by a generator and provided limited power a few hours each day, but with the rising price of petroleum, they no longer use the generator. Most families use candles or flashlights powered by batteries or hand cranks. Small solar panels have recently been installed on some homes.

Some of the families on Amantani open their homes to tourists for overnight stays and provide cooked meals, arranged through tour guides. The families who do so are required to have a special room set aside for the tourists and must conform to a code specified by the tourist companies that help them. Guests typically take food staples (cooking oil, rice, etc., but no sugar products, as they have no dental facilities) as a gift, or school supplies for the children on the island. The islanders hold nightly traditional dance shows for the tourists, where they offer to dress them up in their traditional clothes and allow them to participate.

===Taquile===
Taquile is a hilly island located east of Puno. It is narrow and long and was used as a prison during the Spanish Colony and into the 20th century. In 1970, it became property of the Taquile people, who have inhabited the island since then. The current population is around 2,200. The island is in size (maximum measurements), with an area of . The highest point of the island is above sea level, and the main village is at . Pre-Inca ruins are found on the highest part of the island, and agricultural terraces on hillsides. From the hillsides of Taquile, one has a view of the tops of Bolivian mountains. The inhabitants, known as &quot;Taquileños&quot;, are southern Quechua speakers.
Taquile is especially known for its handicraft tradition, which is regarded as being of the highest quality. &quot;Taquile and Its Textile Art&quot; were honored by being proclaimed &quot;Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity&quot; by UNESCO. Knitting is exclusively performed by males, starting at age eight. The women exclusively make yarn and weave.

Taquileans are also known for having created an innovative, community-controlled tourism model, offering home stays, transportation, and restaurants to tourists. Ever since tourism started coming to Taquile in the 1970s, the &quot;Taquileños&quot; have slowly lost control over the mass day-tourism operated by non-Taquileans. They have thus developed alternative tourism models, including lodging for groups, cultural activities, and local guides who have completed a 2-year training program. The local Travel Agency, Munay Taquile, has been established to regain control over tourism.

The people in Taquile run their society based on community collectivism and on the Inca moral code &quot;ama sua, ama llulla, ama qhilla,&quot; (do not steal, do not lie, do not be lazy). The island is divided into six sectors or &quot;suyus&quot; for crop rotation purposes. The economy is based on fishing, terraced farming based on potato cultivation, and tourist-generated income from the roughly 40,000 tourists who visit each year.

===Isla del Sol===
Situated on the Bolivian side of the lake with regular boat links to the town of Copacabana, Bolivia, Isla del Sol (&quot;Island of the Sun&quot;) is one of the largest islands of the lake. Geographically, the terrain is harsh; it is a rocky, hilly island. No motor vehicles or paved roads are on the island. The main economic activity of the approximately 800 families on the island is farming, with fishing and tourism augmenting the subsistence economy.

Over 180 ruins remain on the island. Most of these date to the Inca period around the 15th century AD. Many hills on the island contain terraces, which adapt steep and rocky terrain to agriculture. Among the ruins on the island are the Sacred Rock, a labyrinth-like building called Chinkana, Kasa Pata, and Pilco Kaima. In the religion of the Incas, the sun god was believed to have been born here.

During 1987–92, Johan Reinhard directed underwater archaeological investigations off of the Island of the Sun, recovering Inca and Tiahuanaco offerings. These artifacts are currently on display in the site museum of the village of Challapampa.

===Isla de la Luna===
Isla de la Luna is situated east from the bigger Isla del Sol. Both islands belong to the La Paz Department of Bolivia. According to legends that refer to Inca mythology Isla de la Luna (Spanish for &quot;island of the moon&quot;) is where Viracocha commanded the rising of the moon. Ruins of a supposed Inca nunnery (Mamakuna) occupy the eastern shore.

Archaeological excavations indicate that the Tiwanaku peoples (around 650–1000 AD) built a major temple on the Island of the Moon. Pottery vessels of local dignitaries dating from this period have been excavated on islands in Lake Titicaca. Two of them were found in the 19th century and are now in the British Museum in London. The structures seen on the island today were built by the Inca (&quot;circa&quot; 1450–1532) directly over the earlier Tiwanaku ones.

===Suriki===
Suriki lies in the Bolivian part of lake Titicaca (in the southeastern part also known as lake Wiñaymarka).

Suriki is thought to be the last place where the art of reed boat construction survives, at least as late as 1998. Craftsmen from Suriqui helped Thor Heyerdahl in the construction of several of his projects, such as the reed boats &quot;Ra II&quot; and &quot;Tigris&quot;, and a balloon gondola.

==Transport==
The dual gauge car float &quot;Manco Capac&quot; links PeruRail&#x27;s line at Puno with the Bolivian railways&#x27; line at Guaqui.

===History===

The lake has had a number of steamships, each of which was built in the United Kingdom in &quot;knock down&quot; form with bolts and nuts, disassembled into many hundreds of pieces, transported to the lake, and then riveted together and launched.

In 1862 Thames Ironworks on the River Thames built the iron-hulled sister ships SS &quot;Yavari&quot; and SS &quot;Yapura&quot; under contract to the James Watt Foundry of Birmingham. The ships were designed as combined cargo, passenger, and gunboats for the Peruvian Navy. After several years&#x27; delay in delivery from the Pacific coast to the lake, &quot;Yavari&quot; was launched in 1870 and &quot;Yapura&quot; in 1873. &quot;Yavari&quot; was long, but in 1914 her hull was lengthened for extra cargo capacity and she was re-engined as a motor vessel.

In November 1883, during the final phase of the War of the Pacific, the Chilean military command sent the to the lake, via railroad, from Mollendo to Puno to control the area. It was the first warship to navigate the lake.

In 1892, William Denny and Brothers at Dumbarton on the River Clyde in Scotland built . She was long and was launched on the lake in 1893.

In 1905, Earle&#x27;s Shipbuilding at Kingston upon Hull on the Humber built . By then, a railway served the lake, so the ship was delivered in kit form by rail. At long and 1,809 tons (1,994 U.S. tons), &quot;Inca&quot; was the lake&#x27;s largest ship thus far. In the 1920s, Earle&#x27;s supplied a new bottom for the ship, which also was delivered in kit form.

Trade continued to grow, so in 1930, Earle&#x27;s built . Her parts were landed at the Pacific Ocean port of Mollendo and brought by rail to the lake port of Puno. At long and 2,200 tons (425 U.S. tons), she was considerably larger than the &quot;Inca&quot;, so first a new slipway had to be built to build her. She was launched in November 1931.

In 1975, &quot;Yavari&quot; and &quot;Yapura&quot; were returned to the Peruvian Navy, which converted &quot;Yapura&quot; into a hospital ship and renamed her BAP &quot;Puno&quot;. The Navy discarded &quot;Yavari&quot;, but in 1987, charitable interests bought her and started restoring her. She is now moored at Puno Bay and provides static tourist accommodation while her restoration continues. &quot;Coya&quot; was beached in 1984, but restored as a floating restaurant in 2001. &quot;Inca&quot; survived until 1994, when she was broken up. &quot;Ollanta&quot; is no longer in scheduled service, but PeruRail has been leasing her for tourist charter operations.

<doc id="159769" wikidata="Q41603" url="?curid=159769" title="John I Tzimiskes">
<text>John I Tzimiskes (; 925 – 10 January 976) was the senior Byzantine emperor from 969 to 976. An intuitive and successful general who married into the influential Skleros family, he strengthened and expanded the Byzantine Empire to include Thrace and Syria by warring with the Rus&#x27; under Sviatoslav I and the Fatimids respectively.

== Background ==

John was born in present-day Çemişgezek in Tunceli Province. His father was a scion of the Kourkouas family, a clan of still debated Armenian origin that had established itself as one of the chief families among the Anatolian military aristocracy by the early 10th century. His mother belonging to the Phokas family of unknown ethnicity, maybe Greek-Armenian origin. Scholars have speculated that &quot;Tzimiskes&quot; was derived either from the Armenian &quot;Chmushkik&quot; (Չմշկիկ), meaning &quot;red boot&quot;, or from an Armenian word for &quot;short stature&quot;, as explained by Leo the Deacon. A more favorable explanation is offered by the medieval Armenian historian Matthew of Edessa, who states that Tzimiskes was from the region of Khozan, from the area called Chmushkatzag. Khozan was located in the region of Paghnatun, in the Byzantine province of Fourth Armenia (Sophene). Either way, &quot;Tzimiskes&quot; was a surname used by other members of John&#x27;s family, as the Armenian historian Stepanos Asoghik refers to him as the &quot;grandson of Č‘mškik&quot;.

Tzimiskes was born in 924 or 925, as Leo the Deacon states that he died aged 51, to an unnamed member of the Kourkouas family and the sister of the future Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas. Both the Kourkouai and the Phokadai were distinguished Cappadocian families, and among the most prominent of the emerging military aristocracy of Asia Minor. Several of their members had served as prominent army generals, most notably the great John Kourkouas, who conquered Melitene and much of Armenia.

Contemporary sources describe Tzimiskes as a rather short but well-built man, with reddish blonde hair and beard and blue eyes who was attractive to women. He seems to have joined the army at an early age, originally under the command of his maternal uncle Nikephoros Phokas. The latter is also considered his instructor in the art of war. Partly because of his familial connections and partly because of his personal abilities, Tzimiskes quickly rose through the ranks. He was given the political and military command of the theme of Armenia before he turned twenty-five years old.

His marriage to Maria Skleraina, daughter of Pantherios Skleros and sister of Bardas Skleros, linked him to the influential Skleros family. Little is known about her; she died before his rise to the throne, and the marriage was apparently childless. The contemporary historian Leo the Deacon remarks that she excelled in both beauty and wisdom.

== Rise to the throne ==

The Byzantine Empire was at war with its eastern neighbors, the various autonomous and semi-autonomous emirates emerging from the break-up of the Abbasid Caliphate. The most prominent among them was the Hamdanid Emirate of Aleppo, under Sayf al-Dawla. Armenia served as the borderland between the two Empires, and Tzimiskes successfully defended his province. He and his troops joined the main army which was campaigning under the command of Nikephoros Phokas.

By 962 the Hamdanids had sued for peace with favorable terms for the Byzantines, securing the eastern border of the Empire for some years. Tzimiskes distinguished himself during the war both at the side of his uncle and at leading parts of the army to battle under his personal command, as in the Battle of Raban in 958. He was rather popular with his troops and gained a reputation for taking the initiative during battles, turning their course.

On the death of Emperor Romanos II in 963, Tzimiskes urged his uncle to seize the throne. After helping Nikephoros to the throne and continuing to defend the Empire&#x27;s eastern provinces, Tzimiskes was deprived of his command by an intrigue, for which he retaliated by conspiring with Nikephoros&#x27; wife Theophano and a number of disgruntled leading generals (Michael Bourtzes and Leo Balantes) to assassinate Nikephoros.

== Reign ==
After his coronation in December 969, Tzimiskes dispatched his brother-in-law Bardas Skleros to subdue a rebellion by Bardas Phokas, a cousin of Tzimiskes who aspired to succeed their uncle as emperor. To solidify his position, Tzimiskes married Theodora, a daughter of Emperor Constantine VII. He proceeded to justify his usurpation by repelling the foreign invaders of the Empire. The tributary of Aleppo was soon assured under the Treaty of Safar.

During his early reign he had to fight off the Kievan Rus&#x27; encroachment on the Lower Danube. In 970 he sent his brother-in-law, Bardas Skleros, to push the Rus&#x27; forces out of Thrace; Skleros defeated the Rus&#x27; army at Arcadiopolis. In 971, John Tzimiskes took the main army across Mt. Haemus, and besieged the fortress of Dorostolon (Silistra) on the Danube for 65 days, where after several hard-fought battles he defeated Grand Prince Sviatoslav I of Kiev. Tzimiskes and Sviatoslav ended up negotiating a truce, in which weaponry, armor and provisions were exchanged for the famished Rus&#x27; departure.
On his return to Constantinople, Tzimiskes celebrated a triumph, expanded the Church of Christ of the Chalke as thanksgiving, divested the captive Bulgarian Emperor Boris II of the Imperial symbols, and proclaimed Bulgaria annexed. He further secured his northern frontier by transplanting to Thrace some colonies of the Paulicians, whom he suspected of sympathising with their Muslim neighbours in the east.
In 972, Tzimiskes turned against the Abbasid Empire and its vassals, beginning with an invasion of Upper Mesopotamia. A second campaign, in 975, was aimed at Syria, where his forces took Emesa, Heliopolis, Damascus, Tiberias, Nazareth, Caesarea, Sidon, Beirut, Byblos, and Tripoli, but failed to take Jerusalem.

== Death ==
Tzimiskes died suddenly in 976 returning from his second campaign against the Abbasids and was buried in the Church of Christ Chalkites, which he had rebuilt. Several sources state that the Imperial chamberlain Basil Lekapenos poisoned the emperor to prevent him from stripping Lekapenos of his ill-gotten lands and riches. Tzimiskes left all his own personal wealth to the poor and the sick. He was succeeded by his ward and nephew, Basil II, who had been nominal co-emperor since 960. He left his successor a strengthened and expanded empire.

== Assessment ==
Finnish philologist and researcher Paavo Hohti asserts that Tzimiskes was one of &quot;Byzantine&#x27;s most capable military generals&quot;, noting his talents as a mediator and a reformer of religious institutions. According to Hohti, Tzimiskes&#x27; successful campaigns against the Rus and the Arabs allowed him to restore the ascendancy of the Eastern Roman Empire in the Balkans and Mesopotamia.

== Legacy ==
Tsimiski Street, the main commercial road in the center of Thessaloniki, is named after him. Çemişgezek in the Tunceli Province, modern day Turkey, is named after him, as he was born there.

<text>The Winton Motor Carriage Company was a pioneer United States automobile manufacturer based in Cleveland, Ohio. Winton was one of the first American companies to sell a motor car. In 1912, Winton became one of the first American manufacturers of diesel engines.

==History==
===1896–1903===
In 1896, Scottish immigrant Alexander Winton, owner of the Winton Bicycle Company, turned from bicycle production to an experimental single-cylinder automobile before starting his car company.

The company was incorporated on March 15, 1897. Its first automobiles were built by hand. Each vehicle had painted sides, padded seats, a leather roof, and gas lamps. B.F. Goodrich made the tires.

By this time, Winton had already produced two fully operational prototype automobiles. In May of that year, the 10 hp (7.5 kW) model achieved the astonishing speed of on a test around a Cleveland horse track. However, the new invention was still subject to much skepticism , so to prove his automobile&#x27;s durability and usefulness, Alexander Winton had his car undergo an endurance run from Cleveland to New York City.

On March 24, 1898, Robert Allison of Port Carbon, Pennsylvania, became the first person to buy a Winton automobile after seeing the first automobile advertisement in &quot;Scientific American&quot;. Later that year the Winton Motor Carriage Company sold 21 more vehicles, including one to James Ward Packard, who later founded the Packard automobile company after Winton challenged a very dissatisfied Packard to do better. This is the same mistake that Enzo Ferrari would make with Ferruccio Lamborghini.

Winton sold his first manufactured semi-truck in 1899. More than one hundred Winton vehicles were sold that year, making the company the largest manufacturer of gasoline-powered automobiles in the United States. This success led to the opening of the first automobile dealership by Mr. H. W. Koler in Reading, Pennsylvania. To deliver the vehicles, in 1899, Winton built the first automobile hauler in America. One of these 1899 Wintons was purchased by Larz Anderson and his new wife, Isabel Weld Perkins.

Publicity generated sales. In 1901, the news that both Reginald Vanderbilt and Alfred Vanderbilt had purchased Winton automobiles boosted the company&#x27;s image substantially. Models at the time were a two-passenger Runabout with a one-cylinder engine (8 hp) and a four-passenger Touring and Mail Delivery Van, also with a one-cylinder engine (9 hp). That year, Winton lost a race at Grosse Pointe to Henry Ford. Winton vowed a comeback and win. He produced the 1902 Winton Bullet, which set an unofficial land speed record of in Cleveland that year. The Bullet was defeated by another Ford by famed driver Barney Oldfield, but two more Bullet race cars were built.

In 1903, Dr. Horatio Nelson Jackson made the first successful automobile drive across the United States. On a $50 bet (equal to $ today), he purchased a slightly used two-cylinder, Winton touring car and hired a mechanic to accompany him. Starting in San Francisco, California, ending in Manhattan, New York City, New York. The trip lasted 63 days, 12 hours, and 30 minutes, including breakdowns and delays while waiting for parts to arrive (especially in Cleveland.) The two men often drove miles out of the way to find a passable road, repeatedly hoisted the Winton up and over rocky terrain and mud holes with a block and tackle, or were pulled out of soft sand by horse teams. In 1903, there were only 150 miles of paved road in the entire country, all inside city limits. There were no road signs or maps. They once paid the exorbitant price of $5 for five gallons of gasoline ($178 in 2024 dollars). Jackson and his partner followed rivers and streams, transcontinental railroad tracks, sheep trails, and dirt back roads.

===1904–1924===
The 1904 Winton was a five-passenger tonneau-equipped tourer which sold for US$2,500. By contrast, the Enger 40 was US$2,000, the FAL US$1,750, an Oakland 40 US$1,600, the Cole 30 and Colt Runabout US$1,500, while the (1913) Lozier Light Six Metropolitan started at US$3,250, American&#x27;s lowest-priced model was US$4,250, and Lozier&#x27;s Big Six were US$5,000 and up.

::Models (1914)

Winton continued to successfully market automobiles to upscale consumers through the 1910s, but sales began to fall in the early 1920s. This was due to the very conservative nature of the company, both in terms of technical development and styling. Only one sporting model was offered — the Sport Touring, with the majority of Wintons featuring tourer, sedan, limousine and town car styling. The Winton Motor Carriage Company ceased automobile production on February 11, 1924.

===Winton Engine Company===
In 1912, Winton started producing diesel engines for stationary and marine use, and gasoline engines for heavy vehicles, independent of Winton&#x27;s automobile production. The subsidiary Winton Engine Company remained successful while Winton&#x27;s automotive sales went into decline, and would outlive the Winton Motor Carriage Company. Winton became the main supplier of engines for internal combustion-electric powered railcars in the 1920s.

===Sale to General Motors===
On June 20, 1930, Winton Engine Company was sold to General Motors and on June 30 was reorganized as the Winton Engine Corporation subsidiary of General Motors. It produced the first practical two-stroke diesel engines in the 400-to-1,200 hp (300 to 900 kW) range, which powered the early diesel locomotives of Electro-Motive Corporation (another General Motors subsidiary), as well as United States Navy submarines. In 1934, a Winton eight-cylinder, 8-201-A diesel engine powered the revolutionary streamlined passenger train the Burlington &quot;Zephyr&quot;, the first American diesel-powered mainline train. The Winton Engine Corporation provided 201 Series engines for rail use until late 1938, when it was reorganized as the General Motors Cleveland Diesel Engine Division, which produced the GM 567 series locomotive engines, and other large diesels for marine and stationary use. In 1941, locomotive engine production became part of General Motors Electro-Motive Division (EMD). In 1962, Cleveland Diesel was absorbed by Electro-Motive Division, which remains in business today as a subsidiary of Progress Rail.

===Marine engines===
Winton and Cleveland engines were used widely by the U.S. Navy in World War II, powering submarines, destroyer escorts, and numerous auxiliaries. The Winton engines were systematically replaced with the more reliable Cleveland Diesel engines during refittings during the war.

==In popular culture==
A purpose-built &quot;Winton Flyer&quot; features prominently in William Faulkner&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize–winning 1962 novel &quot;The Reivers&quot;. In fact, the 1969 film version of the novel starring Steve McQueen was known as &quot;The Yellow Winton Flyer&quot; in the UK.

<doc id="159776" wikidata="Q186190" url="?curid=159776" title="Skeleton (sport)">
<text>Skeleton is a winter sliding sport in which a person rides a small sled, known as a skeleton bobsled (or bobsleigh), down a frozen track while lying face down and head-first. The sport and the sled may have been named from the bony appearance of the sled.

Unlike other sliding sports of bobsleigh and luge, the race always involves single riders. Like bobsleigh, but unlike luge, the race begins with a running start from the opening gate at the top of the course. The skeleton sled is thinner and heavier than the luge sled, and skeleton gives the rider more precise control of the sled. Skeleton is the slowest of the three sliding sports, as skeleton&#x27;s face-down, head-first riding position is less aerodynamic than luge&#x27;s face-up, feet-first ride.

Previously, skeleton appeared in the Olympic program in St. Moritz, Switzerland, in 1928 and again in 1948. It was added permanently to the Olympic program for the 2002 Winter Olympics, at which stage a women&#x27;s race was added.

During elite racing the rider experiences accelerations up to 5g and reaches speeds over .

==History==
The skeleton originated in St. Moritz, Switzerland, as a spinoff of the tobogganing sport pioneered by the British on the Cresta Run. Although skeleton &quot;sliders&quot; use equipment similar to that of Cresta &quot;riders&quot;, the two sports are different: while skeleton is run on the same tracks used by bobsleds and luge (which are sufficiently &#x27;closed&#x27; that a participant is highly unlikely to be ejected from the track), the Cresta takes place only on the Cresta Run (which is more open, meaning a rider can fall out of the run if he is out of control). Skeleton sleds are steered using torque provided by the head and shoulders. The Cresta toboggan does not have a steering or braking mechanism, though Cresta riders use rakes on their boots in addition to shifting body weight to help steer and brake.

The sport of skeleton can be traced to 1882, when English soldiers constructed a toboggan track between the towns of Davos and Klosters in Switzerland. While toboggan tracks were not uncommon at the time, the added challenge of curves and bends in the Swiss track distinguished it from those of Canada and the United States. The source of the word is debated; some speculate that it comes from the skeleton-like appearance of the original sleds, and others an incorrectly anglicized version of the Norwegian word for toboggan, &quot;Kjelke&quot;.

Approximately away in the winter sports town of St. Moritz, British men had long enjoyed racing one another down the busy, winding streets of the town, causing an uproar among citizens because of the danger to pedestrians and visiting tourists. In 1884, Major William Bulpett, with the backing of winter sports pioneer and Kulm hotel owner Caspar Badrutt, constructed the Cresta Run, the first tobogganing track of its kind in St. Moritz. The track ran three-quarters of a mile from St. Moritz to Celerina and contained ten turns still used today. When the Winter Olympic Games were held at St. Moritz in 1928 and 1948, the Cresta Run was included in the program, marking the only two times skeleton was included as an Olympic event before its permanent addition in 2002 to the Winter Games.

In the 1887 Grand National competition in St. Moritz, a Mr. Cornish introduced the now-traditional head-first position, a trend that was in full force by the 1890 Grand National.

===International expansion===
Skeleton was practiced mainly in Switzerland; however, in 1905, Styria held its first skeleton competition in Mürzzuschlag, Austria. This opened the door to other national skeleton competitions including the Austrian championship held the following year. In 1908 and 1910, skeleton competitions were held in the Semmering Pass. As the popularity of the sport grew, skeleton evolved into the sport recognized today. In 1892, the sled was transformed by L. P. Child, an Englishman, to incorporate a more bare-bones design.

In 1923, the Federation Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing (FIBT) was established as the governing body of the sport. Soon afterward, in 1926, the International Olympic Committee declared bobsleigh and skeleton as Olympic sports and adopted the rules of the St. Moritz run as the officially recognized Olympic rules. It was not until 2002, however, that skeleton returned to the Olympic Winter Games after a 54-year absence, with the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. In 2015, the FIBT was renamed the International Bobsleigh &amp; Skeleton Federation (IBSF), and the Congress of the IBSF adopted its current governing statutes in 2016.

Popularity in the sport has grown since the 2002 Winter Olympics and now includes participation by some countries that either do not or cannot have a track because of climate, terrain or monetary limitations. Athletes from such countries as Australia, New Zealand, Bermuda, South Africa, Argentina, Iraq, Israel, Mexico, Brazil, and even the Virgin Islands have become involved with the sport in recent years. The IBSF operates a support program for &quot;emerging nations&quot;, which provides travel, coaching, and equipment funding assistance to countries which have neither a track nor three qualified pilots in three IBSF disciplines; in 2017, 20 national federations qualified for financial support in men&#x27;s skeleton, and 11 qualified in women&#x27;s skeleton.

== International competitions ==

The IBSF organizes three competitive circuits for international skeleton competition, in two tiers: two Continental Cups, and the top level World Cup. Each athlete receives points based on their results and the level of the competition, which are used to determine both their rankings on each circuit they race in and also an overall ranking across all circuits. An intermediate tier, the Intercontinental Cup, was discontinued after the 2022–23 season.

National federations are assigned athlete quota spots in the higher levels according to the overall rankings of their individual athletes during the previous season, but are free to send any qualified athlete to a competition in which they have available quota. However, individual athletes&#x27; discipline rankings are used to determine the start order for the first heat of each race: the track becomes less smooth after each successive run, so earlier starts are more desirable. In the second (fourth at the World Championships and Winter Olympics) heat, the competitors start in reverse order of their ranking after the previous heat. (At four-heat races, start order in heats two and three is in ascending order of combined time from the prior heats.)

In addition to the four race series, the IBSF also organizes World Championships, which are held at the end of every sliding season except when the Olympic Winter Games are held, and a Junior World Championships (open to athletes aged 23 and under) which are held annually without regard to the Olympics. One race each World Cup season is also designated the European Championship. The IBSF cooperates with the International Olympic Committee to supervise the skeleton races at the Olympic Winter Games, and the IBSF ranking system is used to determine the National Olympic Committees&#x27; athlete quota allocations.

On all of the regular competitive circuits, the race days are preceded by three or four days of pre-race training to allow athletes to learn the intricacies of each track, and each athlete must complete a certain number of successful training runs to be eligible to compete. Normally, if the same competition also includes bobsleigh races, the skeleton races will be held first, as the heavier bobsleighs do more damage to the track.

=== Continental Cups ===
The two Continental Cup series are the Europe Cup (also called &quot;Europa Cup&quot; and &quot;European Cup&quot;) and the North American Cup. Both series are open to athletes from all participating nations, but with some restrictions: the top 15 athletes in combined ranking are not permitted to race in the Continental Cups, and athletes are not permitted to race unless their team has filled all of its assigned quota sports in the World Cup. In addition, teams are limited to four athletes on their home continent and two athletes on the other continent. (For the purposes of this restriction, African teams are considered to be home on the Europe Cup and Asian, Oceanian, and South American teams are home on the North American Cup.)

As the bottom level of international skeleton competition, race results in the Continental Cups are assigned the lowest point values for ranking, with a first-place finish being with 75 points (compared to 225 points for the World Cup). Only the top 30 athletes receive ranking points; 30th place is worth 1 point. However, two races are generally held in each discipline on a single race weekend, allowing consistently competitive athletes to earn a higher ranking than if they went to a single World Cup race and finished poorly.

=== Intercontinental Cup ===
The Intercontinental Cup (ICC) was introduced as an intermediate level between the Continental Cups and the World Cup; a first-place finish was worth 120 points in the IBSF ranking (vs. 225 points for a World Cup win). The ICC was discontinued after the 2022–23 season to increase the number of athletes participating on the World Cup.

=== World Cup ===
The World Cup is the top level of international skeleton competition, and has the most stringent team quotas, with no teams receiving an automatic entry. To qualify, a team must have placed at least one athlete in the top 70 (for men) of the overall ranking table (top 55 for women); quotas were loosened for the 2023–24 season to account for the discontinuation of the Intercontinental Cup. Each team receives a number of starting positions equal to the number of athletes from that team who were in the top 70 (for men) or top 55 (for women) in the previous season&#x27;s overall rankings, to a maximum of four. To be eligible to enter a World Cup race, athletes must have safely completed five races on two tracks in the previous two seasons. At the end of the World Cup season, the man and woman with the highest ranking, considering only points earned in World Cup races, are given a trophy known as the &quot;Crystal Globe&quot;.

=== Continental Championships ===

One World Cup race a year may be designated as a continental championship for the continent on which it is held. This championship is a &quot;paper&quot; race, based only on the times in the regularly scheduled World Cup event, with the athletes representing a different continent excluded. Currently, this is done only in Europe; the 2017/18 European Championship races were the World Cup races held on 15 December 2017 at Innsbruck, Austria. The current European champions are Martins Dukurs of Latvia and Elena Nikitina of Russia.

=== Senior World Championships ===

In non-Olympic years, a national federation volunteers to organize the (Senior) World Championships (for both bobsleigh and skeleton), which are open to all athletes meeting the experience requirements that apply to the World Cup and the ICC (including junior athletes). The quota system for the Senior World Championships is the same as for the World Cup, except that all national federations are entitled to send one athlete. The defending Junior World Champion in each discipline also receives an automatic entry. Unlike all other IBSF-sponsored races, the World Championships use a two-day, four-heat format, with rankings determined by total time for all four heats.

The 2016/17 World Championships were held at Königssee bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track in Bavaria, 24–26 February 2017. Martins Dukurs of Latvia won the men&#x27;s competition and Jacqueline Lölling of Germany won the women&#x27;s competition. Because 2018 was an Olympic year, no World Championships were held for the 2017/18 season.

=== Junior World Championships ===
The Junior World Championships are held every year, but are scheduled to avoid conflict with the Olympics and the Senior World Championships. Junior athletes are those who are under 23 years of age, or who turn 23 at some point during the competitive season. All countries are entitled to send up to three athletes to the Junior World Championships, subject to the requirement that each entrant must have finished at least three IBSF sanctioned competitions on at least two tracks in the previous two years.

The 2017–18 Junior World Championships were held on 25 January 2018 in St. Moritz, Switzerland, and the winners were Anna Fernstädt of Germany and Nikita Tregubov of Russia.

=== Olympic Winter Games ===

The skeleton event in the Winter Olympics uses the same two-day, four-heat format as the World Championships, but team quotas are significantly smaller. The International Olympic Committee assigns athlete quotas to national Olympic committees in cooperation with the IBSF and using the IBSF ranking system to determine qualification; 20 women and 30 men competed at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Korea, with one automatic quota going to the host country (Korea) for each gender. For men, three countries received three quota spots each, six were allocated two spots, and five got one; for women, two countries received three spots, four got two, and two got one. The ranking of the countries for quota assignment was based on their third-highest, second-highest, or highest ranked athlete in total IBSF ranking over the qualification period. In addition, three quota spots are reserved for countries whose continent did not receive any representation based on this assignment procedure.

National Olympic Committees may send athletes other than the ones whose rankings earned the quota spot, but the athletes chosen must be ranked in the top 60 (for men) or top 45 (for women) on the IBSF list and meet similar experience requirements to those that apply to the World Cup. However, IBSF rule 4.1 provides that, for the purposes of determining the top 60 (or top 45) qualification, lower-ranking athletes from countries which have already received a full quota are &quot;cleaned&quot; from the list before an athlete&#x27;s ordinal ranking is determined This had the effect of allowing continental representatives for Africa into the 2018 games, as they would otherwise have been too low on the ranking list to qualify (notably, Nigerian slider Simidele Adeagbo was ranked 74th before cleaning, but was in the top 45 after application of rule 4.1).

==Sport==
The accessibility of skeleton to amateurs may have been the catalyst for its upswing in popularity. Most notably, Nino Bibbia, a fruit and vegetable merchant from St. Moritz, Switzerland, took Olympic gold at the 1948 event. With the advent of the first artificially refrigerated track in 1969 at Königssee/Berchtesgaden, Germany, athletes are currently able to practice the sport regardless of weather conditions. The sport is also promoted by skeleton officials as a gateway sport to &quot;train young, aspiring athletes…for their future career in bobsleigh.&quot;

===Track===
===Sled===
&quot;The &#x27;toboggans&#x27; used in Alpine countries at the end of the 19th century were inspired by Canadian/Indian sleds used for transport&quot;. Various additions and redesigning efforts by athletes have led to the skeleton sleds used today. In 1892, L. P. Child introduced the &quot;America&quot;, a new metal sled that revolutionized skeleton as a sport. The stripped-down design provided a compact sled with metal runners, and the design caught on quickly. In 1902, Arden Bott added a sliding seat to help athletes shift their weight forward and backward, a feature that is no longer included on modern sleds.

In 2010, the FIBT restricted the materials with which skeleton sleds are permitted to be made. Sled frames must be made of steel and may not include steering or braking mechanisms. The base plate, however, may be made of plastics. The handles and bumpers found along the sides of the sled help secure the athlete during a run.

Further specifications are included in the FIBT ruling regarding sled dimensions:

Some athletes opt to attach ballasts if the combined weight of athlete and sled falls below the maximum combined weight. These ballasts may only be added to the sled, not the rider.

<text>The Baikal seal (Pusa sibirica), also known as Lake Baikal seal or Baikal nerpa, is a species of earless seal endemic to Lake Baikal in Siberia, Russia. Like the Caspian seal, it is related to the Arctic ringed seal. The Baikal seal is one of the smallest true seals and the only exclusively freshwater pinniped species. A subpopulation of inland harbour seals living in the Hudson Bay region of Quebec, Canada, (Lacs des Loups Marins harbour seals), as well as the Saimaa ringed seal and the Ladoga seal (both ringed seal subspecies), are also found in fresh water, but these seals are part of species that also have marine populations.

The most recent population estimates are 80,000 to 100,000 animals, roughly equaling the expected carrying capacity of the lake. At present, the species is not considered threatened.

==Description==
The Baikal seal is one of the smallest true seals. Adults typically grow to in length with a body mass from . The maximum reported size is in length and in weight. There are significant annual variations in the weight, with lowest weight in the spring and highest weight, about 38–42% more, in the fall. The animals show very little sexual dimorphism; males are only slightly larger than females. They have a uniform, steely-grey coat on their backs and fur with a yellowish tinge on their abdomens. As the coat weathers, it becomes brownish. When born, the pups weigh and are about long. They have coats of white, silky, natal fur. This fur is quickly shed and exchanged for a darker coat, much like that of adults. Rarely, Baikal seals can be found with spotted coats.
==Distribution==
The Baikal seal lives only in the waters of Lake Baikal. It is unknown how Baikal seals came to the area. The skull structure of the Baikal seal suggests it is closely related to the Caspian seal. In addition, the morphological structures in both species suggest they are descended from Arctic ringed seals. They may have swum up rivers and streams or possibly Lake Baikal was linked to the ocean at some point through a large body of water, such as the Paratethys Sea, West Siberian Glacial Lake or West Siberian Plain, formed in a previous ice age. The seals are estimated to have inhabited Lake Baikal for some two million years.

The areas of the lake in which the Baikal seals reside change depending on the season, as well as other environmental factors. They are solitary animals for the majority of the year, sometimes living kilometres away from other Baikal seals. In general, a higher concentration of Baikal seals is found in the northern parts of the lake, because the longer winter keeps the ice frozen longer, which is preferable for pupping. However, in recent years, migrations to the southern half of the lake have occurred, possibly to evade hunters. In winter, when the lake is frozen over, seals maintain a few breathing holes over a given area and tend to remain nearby, not interfering with the food supplies of nearby seals. When the ice begins to melt, Baikal seals tend to keep to the shoreline.

==Abundance and trends==
Since 2008, the Baikal seal has been listed as a Least Concern species on the IUCN Red List. This means that they are not currently threatened or endangered. In 1994, the Russian government estimated that they numbered 104,000. In 2000, Greenpeace performed its own count and found an estimated 55,000 to 65,000 seals. The most recent estimates are 80,000–100,000 animals, roughly equaling the carrying capacity of the lake.

In the last century, the kill quota for hunting Baikal seals was raised several times, most notably after the fur industry boomed in the late 1970s and when official counts began indicating more Baikal seals were present than previously known. The quota in 1999, 6,000, was lowered in 2000 to 3,500, which was still nearly 5% of the population if the Greenpeace count is correct. In 2013–2014, the hunting quota was set at 2,500. In addition, new techniques, such as netting breathing holes and seal dens to catch pups, have been introduced. In 2001, a prime seal pelt would bring 1,000 rubles at market. In 2004–2006, about 2,000 seals were killed per year according to official Russian statistics, but in the same period another 1,500–4,000 are thought to have died annually due to drowning in fishing gear, poaching, and the like. In 2012–2013, it was estimated that 2,300–2,800 were hunted per year (combined legal hunting and poaching). Some groups have pressured for higher hunting quotas.

Another problem at Lake Baikal is the introduction of pollutants into the ecosystem. Pesticides such as DDT and hexachlorocyclohexane, as well as industrial waste, mainly from the Baikalisk pulp and paper plant, are thought to have exacerbated several disease epidemics among Baikal seal populations. The chemicals are speculated to concentrate up the food chain and weaken the Baikal seal&#x27;s immune system, making them susceptible to diseases such as canine distemper and the plague, which was the cause of a serious Baikal seal epidemic that resulted in the deaths of 5,000–6,500 animals in 1987–1988. Small numbers died as recently as 2000, but the reason for their deaths is unclear. Canine distemper is still present in the Baikal seal population, but has not caused mass deaths since the earlier outbreaks. In general, levels of DDT and non-ortho PCB have declined in the lake from the 1990s, levels of mono-ortho PCB are unchanged, and the level of perfluorochemicals have increased. Industrialization of the area near Lake Baikal is increasing and future monitoring is necessary. At present, Baikal seals show lower levels of contaminants than seals of Europe and North America, but higher than those in the Arctic.

The most serious future threat to the survival of the seal may be global warming, which has the potential to seriously affect a closed cold-water ecosystem such as that of Lake Baikal.

The only known natural predator of adult Baikal seals is the brown bear, but this is not believed to occur frequently. The seal pups are typically hidden in a den, but can fall prey to smaller land predators such as the red fox, the sable and the white-tailed eagle.

==Reproduction and growth==
Female Baikal seals reach sexual maturity at 3–6 years of age, whereas males achieve it around 4–7 years. The males and females are not strongly sexually dimorphic. Baikal seals mate in the water towards the end of the pupping season. With a combination of delayed implantation and a nine-month gestation period, the Baikal seals&#x27; overall pregnancy is around 11 months. Pregnant females are the only Baikal seals to haul out during the winter. The males tend to stay in the water, under the ice, all winter. Females usually give birth to one pup, but they are one of only two species of true seals with the ability to give birth to twins. Very rarely, triplets or quadruplets have been recorded. The twins often stick together for some time after being weaned. The females, after giving birth to their pups on the ice in late winter, become immediately impregnated again, and often are lactating while pregnant.

Baikal seals are slightly polygamous and slightly territorial, although not particularly defensive of their territory. Males mate with around three females if given the chance. They then mark the female&#x27;s den with a strong, musky odor, which can be smelled by another male if he approaches. The female raises the pups on her own; she digs them a fairly large den under the ice, up to 5 m (16 ft) in length, and more than 2 m (6 ft) wide. Pups as young as two days old then further expand this den by digging a maze of tunnels around the den. Since the pup avoids breaking the surface with these tunnels, this activity is thought to be mainly for exercise, to keep warm until they have built up an insulating layer of blubber.

Baikal seal pups are weaned after 2–2.5 months, occasionally up to 3.5 months. During this time, the pups can increase their birth weight five-fold. After the pups are weaned, the mother introduces them to solid food, bringing amphipods, fish, and other food into the den.

In spring, when the ice melts and the dens usually collapse, the pup is left to fend for itself. Growth continues until they are 20 to 25 years old.

Every year in the late winter and spring, both sexes haul themselves out and begin to moult their coat from the previous year, which is replaced with new fur. While moulting, they refrain from eating and enter a lethargic state, during which time they can die of overheating, males especially, from lying on the ice too long in the sun. During the spring and summer, groups as large as 500 can form on the ice floes and shores of Lake Baikal. Baikal seals can live to over 50 years old, exceptionally old for a seal, although the females are presumed to be fertile only until they are around 30.

==Foraging==
Their main food source is the golomyanka, a cottoid oilfish found only in Lake Baikal. Baikal seals eat more than half of the annual produced biomass of golomyanka, some 64,000 tons. In the winter and spring, it is estimated that more than 90% of its food consists of golomyankas. The remaining food sources for this seal are various other fish species, especially &quot;Cottocomephorus&quot; (about 7% of the diet during the winter and spring) and Kessler&#x27;s sculpin (about 0.3% of the diet in the winter and spring), but it may also take some invertebrates such as &quot;Epischura baikalensis&quot;, gammarids and molluscs. During the autumn the Baikal seal eats 50–67% fewer golomyankas than in the winter and spring, but significantly more &quot;Cottocomephorus&quot;, Kessler&#x27;s sculpins and stone sculpins. A total of 29 fish species have been recorded in the diet. They feed mainly during twilight and at night, when golomyankas occur in depths as shallow as . During the day, golomyankas are typically found deeper than . Baikal seals can dive up to depths of and stay underwater for more than 40 minutes. Most dives last less than 10 minutes and generally only 2–4 minutes. Baikal seals have two litres more blood than any other seal of their size and can stay underwater for up to 70 minutes if they are frightened or need to escape danger. According to a 2020 paper, Baikal seals also seek food through the use of filter-feeding on amphipods within Lake Baikal. Baikal seals have specialized teeth that allow the seals to expel water while feeding, allowing them to gather large amounts of amphipods while swimming.

According to a 2004 paper on the foraging tactics of Baikal seals, during the summer nights these seals are known to have different foraging strategies during night time and during day time. During the day, these seals use visual clues to search for their prey, which is mainly fish, while during the night they use tactile clues to hunt crustaceans. Since it is brighter during the day, the seals are able to see much better in order to hunt for the fish. Since there is no light at night, they have to hunt with tactile cues. The crustaceans they hunt at night have a diel migration, so they come up into shallower waters during the night, and swim to deeper waters during the day to escape predators. These seals were observed to dive deeper during dawn and dusk in order to get to these crustaceans as they were swimming shallower and deeper, respectively.

The Baikal seal has been blamed for drops in omul numbers, but this is not the case. It is estimated that omul only comprises about 0.1% of its diet. The omul&#x27;s main competitor is the golomyanka and by eating tons of these fish a year, Baikal seals cut down on the omul&#x27;s competition for resources.

Baikal seals have one unusual foraging habit. In early autumn, before the entire lake freezes over, they migrate to bays and coves and hunt Kessler&#x27;s sculpin, a fish that lives in silty areas and, as a result, usually contains grit and silt in its digestive system. This grit scours the seals&#x27; gastrointestinal tracts and expels parasites.

<text>The Matthew Bible, also known as Matthew&#x27;s Version, was first published in 1537 by John Rogers, under the pseudonym &quot;Thomas Matthew&quot;. It combined the New Testament of William Tyndale, and as much of the Old Testament as he had been able to translate before being captured and put to death. Myles Coverdale translated chiefly from German and Latin sources and completed the Old Testament and Biblical apocrypha, except for the Prayer of Manasseh, which was Rogers&#x27;, into the Coverdale Bible. It is thus a vital link in the main sequence of English Bible translations.

==Translation==
The Matthew Bible was the combined work of three individuals, working from numerous sources in at least five different languages.

The entire New Testament (first published in 1526 and later revised in 1534), the Pentateuch, Jonah and in David Daniell&#x27;s view, the Book of Joshua, Judges, Ruth, First and Second Samuel, First and Second Kings, and First and Second Chronicles, were the work of William Tyndale. Tyndale consulted Luther&#x27;s German Bible, Erasmus’ Latin version, and the Vulgate for the biblical text, prefaces, and marginal notes, and worked directly with the Hebrew and Greek. The use of the pseudonym &quot;Thomas Matthew&quot; resulted possibly from the need to conceal from Henry VIII the participation of Tyndale in the translation. A theory exists from Dr. Harding that indicates the name &quot;Thomas Matthew&quot;, which in Greek means &quot;A twin to the original gift from God&quot;, may have been chosen to indicate that the largest contributing author was indeed William Tyndale and that his writings were preserved by Coverdale and Rogers.

The remaining books of the Old Testament and the Apocrypha were the work of John Rogers and Myles Coverdale. Coverdale originally translated primarily from German and Latin sources and in the Matthew Bible they used the original language texts to translate. Historians often tend to treat Coverdale and Tyndale like competitors in a race to complete the monumental and arduous task of translating the biblical text. One is often credited to the exclusion of the other. In reality they knew each other and occasionally worked together. Contemporary historian John Foxe states that they were in Hamburg translating the Pentateuch together as early as 1529.

The Prayer of Manasseh was the work of John Rogers. Rogers translated from a French Bible printed two years earlier (in 1535). Rogers compiled the completed work and added the preface, some marginal notes, a calendar and an almanac.

Of the three translators, two met with martyrdom. Tyndale was strangled to death and his body burned on 6 October 1536 in Vilvoorde, Belgium. John Rogers was &quot;tested by fire&quot; on 4 February 1555 at Smithfield, England; the first to meet this fate under Mary I of England. Myles Coverdale was employed by Cromwell to work on the Great Bible of 1539, the first officially authorized English translation of the Bible.

Time and extensive scholastic scrutiny have judged Tyndale the most gifted of the three translators. Dr. Westcott (in his &quot;History of the English Bible&quot;) claims that &quot;The history of our English Bible begins with the work of Tyndale and not with that of Wycliffe.&quot; The quality of his translations and choices have also stood the test of time, coming relatively intact even into modern versions of the Bible. A. S. Herbert, Bible cataloguer, says of the Matthew Bible, &quot;this version, which welds together the best work of Tyndale and Coverdale, is generally considered to be the real primary version of our English Bible&quot;, upon which later editions were based, including the Geneva Bible and King James Version. Professor David Daniell recounts that, &quot;New Testament scholars Jon Nielson and Royal Skousen observed that previous estimates of Tyndale&#x27;s contribution to the KJV &#x27;have run from a high of up to 90% (Westcott) to a low of 18% (Butterworth)&#x27;. By a statistically accurate and appropriate method of sampling, based on eighteen portions of the Bible, they concluded that for the (KJV) New Testament Tyndale&#x27;s contribution is about 83% of the text, and in the Old Testament 76%. However, these studies do not in turn deal with the contributions of previous versions to Tyndale. 

The Matthew Bible, though largely unrecognized, significantly shaped and influenced English Bible versions in the centuries that followed its first appearance.

==Printing==
John Strype wrote in 1694 that the 1537 Matthew Bible was printed by Richard Grafton, in Hamburg. Later editions were printed in London; the last of four appeared in 1551. Two editions of the Matthew Bible were published in 1549. One was a reprint of the 1537 first edition, and was printed by Thomas Raynalde and William Hyll (Herbert #75). The other was printed by John Daye and William Seres, and made extensive changes to the notes of the original Matthew Bible, included copious commentaries on the book of Revelation based on the book &quot;Image of Two Churches&quot; by contemporary John Bale.

Van Meteren&#x27;s son, Emanuel, stated in an affidavit dated 28 May 1609 that his father was &quot;a furtherer of reformed religion, and he that caused the first Bible at his costes to be Englisshed by Mr Myles Coverdal in Andwarp, the w’h his father, with Mr Edward Whytchurch, printed both in Paris and London.&quot; Coverdale was employed as a translator by Jacobus van Meteren. Rogers began assisting the work around 1535, and married J. van Meteren&#x27;s niece Adriana in the same year that the Matthew Bible was first published (1537). Rogers was living in London again at the time of the second printing of the Matthew Bible in 1549.

<doc id="159781" wikidata="Q1137441" url="?curid=159781" title="Yawl">
<text>A yawl is a type of boat. The term has several meanings. It can apply to the rig (or sailplan), to the hull type or to the use which the vessel is put.

As a rig, a yawl is a two masted, fore and aft rigged sailing vessel with the mizzen mast positioned abaft (behind) the rudder stock, or in some instances, very close to the rudder stock. This is different from a ketch, where the mizzen mast is forward of the rudder stock. The sail area of the mizzen on a yawl is consequentially proportionately smaller than the same sail on a ketch.

As a hull type, yawl may refer to many types of open, clinker-built, double-ended, traditional working craft that operated from the beaches of Great Britain and Ireland. These boats are considered to be linked to the Viking or Nordic design tradition. Most of these types are now extinct, but they include the Norfolk and Sussex Beach Yawls (called &quot;yols&quot; by the men who crewed them), which were probably the fastest-sailing open boats ever built.

A yawl is also a type of ship&#x27;s boat. The definition, size, number of oars and sailing rig varied over time. This was one of the normal working boats carried by a ship in the age of sail.

In local usage, the term yawl was sometimes applied to working craft which did not fit any of the definitions given above. An example of this is the Whitstable yawl, a decked gaff-cutter-rigged fishing smack that dredged for oysters.

The etymology of &quot;yawl&quot; is obscure, especially considering the different meanings of the word.

== The sailing rig ==
=== Origins ===
Yawl rigs appear to have originated in the early 19th century. Working craft of this type include the later versions of the Falmouth Quay Punt. Dixon Kemp, an authority on yacht racing, became interested in this local type in 1875. Yachts were rigged as yawls as early as 1814. John MacGregor had his 1867-built &quot;Rob Roy&quot; designed as a yawl. (MacGregor had a number of boats, all of the same name.) British and European racing yachts were rigged as yawls from the second half of the 1870s, with a resurgence in popularity from 1896, when a change to the handicap rating system gave advantages to yawls. They remained prominent in handicap classes through the 1920s, with yachts like &quot;Rendezvous&quot; (built 1913) measuring and setting of sail.

=== Rig characteristics ===

A yawl is often considered a suitable rig for a short handed or single handed sailor. This is because the mainsail is not quite so big to handle and the mizzen (before the days of modern self steering gear) could allow the sails to be trimmed to keep a boat on the same course. Also, handing (taking down) the mizzen is a quick and easy way of reducing sail, often thought of as the equivalent of the first reef in a cutter or sloop. Less well known are the advantages of setting a mizzen staysail when reaching, which can give a considerable amount of extra drive not available to a single-masted rig. Alec Rose (single handed circumnavigator) used a mizzen staysail on his yawl &quot;Lively Lady&quot; but did not set a mizzen, feeling it was of little value and would interfere with the Hasler self-steering gear.

=== Current examples ===
Yawls are currently popular in cruising dinghies. The Drascombe Lugger is a good example of this type. With the mizzen sheeted to an outrigger or boomkin and a jib set on a bowsprit, the rig extends a lot horizontally. This allows the sail area to have a lower centre of pressure than, for example, a Bermudan sloop. This gives a lower heeling moment.

==The hull type==
Before &quot;yawl&quot; became the name of a rig, it was a hull type. Generally, a yawl is a double-ended, clinker built open boat, which can be worked under sail or oar. They are considered to have Viking or Norse influence in their design. Most were operated from a beach or a small harbour, with the boat being hauled out of the water when not in use.

===Scotland: yawl/yole/yoal===
In the North of Scotland, yawl is cognate with yole or yoal. There are examples in both Shetland and Orkney, with type and local variations in design. The Shetland boats include foureens and sixareens; the names denote the number of oars they were designed to use. Both also had sailing rigs, usually a single masted dipping lug. A sixareen was typically long overall. The foureen was around overall. Other smaller Shetland types were the Ness Yole and the Fair Isle Yole. Sixareens and foureens were used in the haaf fishery catching white fish species such as cod and saithe with long line fishing. These undecked sixareens operated between 30 and 50 miles offshore, sometimes within sight of Norway. The foureens ventured up to 20 miles offshore (where they &quot;sank the land&quot;; i.e. when the land had just sunk below the horizon, it was 20 miles away). Until the 19th century, most of these boats were built in Norway and then transported to Shetland disassembled, where they were put back together again. It appears that the Norwegian boatbuilders built specific types of craft to meet the needs of the Shetland market, as these boats differed somewhat from the ones used in Norway. Surviving examples and a replica of some of these Shetland boats are in the Shetland Museum.

The Orkney yoles had more beam than their Shetland counterparts. This allowed slightly more sail to be set, so these were two-masted with standing lug rigs.

===Norfolk and Suffolk Beach Yawls===
Beach Yawls could be found along a section of the East Anglian coast, mainly from Winterton on the north Norfolk coast down to Aldeburgh on the Suffolk coast. (They were called &quot;yols&quot; by the men who sailed in them.) Each boat was operated by a &quot;company&quot; that shared the profits of operations between their members, subject to strict rules. The members were entitled to serve as crew when the yawl was launched. These companies are known to have existed at the start of the 18th century and yawls operated right through the 19th century, until steam power, efficient tugs and lifeboats put the last of them out of business by the start of the 20th century.

The yawls serviced the ships anchored in Yarmouth Roads, took pilots to and from ships, carried stores and performed salvage work. The Royal Navy often had warships anchored in Yarmouth roads, so providing a lot of work additional to that from the many merchant ships that passed along the East Anglian coast.

The Norfolk and Suffolk Beach Yawls were probably the fastest open boats ever built. Fourteen knots could be achieved in the right conditions, and 16 knots has been measured for one of these boats. Clinker-built and double-ended, the hulls were typically long with a beam of . &quot;Reindeer&quot;, built in 1838 was at the top of the size range, at long (with a beam). Whilst the earlier boats had three lug-rigged masts, in common with other types of British lugger, from the middle of the 19th century the mainmast was usually dispensed with to give a dipping lug foresail and a standing lug mizzen. The foresail tack fastened to an iron bumkin protruding from the stemhead. The mizzen sheeted to an outrigger (called an &quot;outligger&quot; by the crews of these boats). The fastest type of Beach Yawl was used for taking pilots and passengers out to ships. The slightly shorter and beamier &quot;bullock boats&quot; carried supplies out to ships moored in the roads and would land catches of herrings from luggers.

Beach Yawls were kept ready for launching at a moment&#x27;s notice. A lookout tower was manned to spot any ship signalling for a pilot or in distress. There was competition between each company to get any potential work. The boats were run down the shingle beach on greased wooden skids laid at right angles to their route. Men ran alongside to hold the boat upright as it started to move, crew members scrambled aboard and others passed bags of ballast on board. As the boat entered the water she was given a final shove with a spar. Then each boat raced to get the work on offer.

Large crews were needed: 25 men would be common. They were fully occupied if going to windward. On tacking, the foresail would be dipped behind the mast to set on the other side, and the halyard (which was made fast at the gunwale to help support the mast) and burton (a moveable stay) would be shifted to windward and hauled taught again, whilst others would be heaving bags of shingle ballast to the new windward side of the bilge. Some would be continuously baling to rid the boat of the spray that came aboard. The most important man aboard tended the foresheet, which was never cleated, but held in hand after taking a couple of turns around the main sampson post. If a gust was too strong, the sheet would instantly be eased to prevent a capsize. If worked under oar, a yawl would have ten or more oars a side - though the beach companies usually operated a gig in light weather if delivering or collecting a pilot, as they were faster under oars.

==Ship&#x27;s boat==
The yawl as a type of Royal Navy ship&#x27;s boat appeared early in the second half of the 17th century. In early mentions, they were sometimes referred to as &quot;Norway yawls&quot;, so showing a Scandinavian influence. Later yawls were built in Deal, Kent. Both were clinker built, but those from Deal had transom sterns. When Navy dockyards started to copy the Deal-built boats, they moved to carvel construction. The size of an individual yawl would vary depending on the size of the ship to which she belonged - though the yawl was usually the smallest of the several types of boat typically carried on each ship. In 1817, Royal Navy yawls were issued in eight different lengths between 26 ft and 16 ft. After this date, the yawl was less commonly used. The sailing rig was two-masted, typically setting identical sprit-sails. The number of oars depended on the size of the boat, eight and six being common, with some pulling just four oars.

<text>Mansa Musa (reigned ) was the ninth &quot;Mansa&quot; of the Mali Empire, which reached its territorial peak during his reign. Musa&#x27;s reign is often regarded as the zenith of Mali&#x27;s power and prestige, although he features less in Mandinka oral traditions than his predecessors. 

He was exceptionally wealthy to an extent that he was described as being inconceivably rich by contemporaries; &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported: &quot;There&#x27;s really no way to put an accurate number on his wealth.&quot; It is known from local manuscripts and travellers&#x27; accounts that Mansa Musa&#x27;s wealth came principally from the Mali Empire&#x27;s control and taxing of the trade in salt from northern regions and especially from gold panned and mined in Bambuk and Bure to the south. Over a very long period Mali had amassed a large reserve of gold. Mali is also believed to have been involved in the trade in many goods such as ivory, slaves, spices, silks, and ceramics. However, presently little is known about the extent or mechanics of these trades. At the time of Musa&#x27;s ascension to the throne, Mali consisted largely of the territory of the former Ghana Empire, which Mali had conquered. The Mali Empire comprised land that is now part of Guinea, Senegal, Mauritania, the Gambia, and the modern state of Mali.

Musa went on Hajj to Mecca in 1324, traveling with an enormous entourage and a vast supply of gold. En route he spent time in Cairo, where his lavish gift-giving is said to have noticeably affected the value of gold in Egypt and garnered the attention of the wider Muslim world. Musa expanded the borders of the Mali Empire, in particular incorporating the cities of Gao and Timbuktu into its territory. He sought closer ties with the rest of the Muslim world, particularly the Mamluk and Marinid Sultanates. He recruited scholars from the wider Muslim world to travel to Mali, such as the Andalusian poet Abu Ishaq al-Sahili, and helped establish Timbuktu as a center of Islamic learning. His reign is associated with numerous construction projects, including a portion of Djinguereber Mosque in Timbuktu.

==Name and titles==

Mansa Musa&#x27;s personal name was Musa (), the name of Moses in Islam. &quot;Mansa&quot;, &#x27;ruler&#x27; or &#x27;king&#x27; in Mandé, was the title of the ruler of the Mali Empire. 

In oral tradition and the &quot;Timbuktu Chronicles&quot;, Musa is further known as Kanku Musa. In Mandé tradition, it was common for one&#x27;s name to be prefixed by his mother&#x27;s name, so the name Kanku Musa means &quot;Musa, son of Kanku&quot;, although it is unclear whether the genealogy implied is literal. Al-Yafii gave Musa&#x27;s name as Musa ibn Abi Bakr ibn Abi al-Aswad (), and ibn Hajar gave Musa&#x27;s name as Musa ibn Abi Bakr Salim al-Takruri ().

Musa is often given the title Hajji in oral tradition because he made hajj. In the Songhai language, rulers of Mali such as Musa were known as the Mali-koi, &quot;koi&quot; being a title that conveyed authority over a region: in other words, the &quot;ruler of Mali&quot;.

==Historical sources==

Much of what is known about Musa comes from Arabic sources written after his hajj, especially the writings of Al-Umari and Ibn Khaldun. While in Cairo during his hajj, Musa befriended officials such as Ibn Amir Hajib, who learned about him and his country from him and later passed that knowledge to historians such as Al-Umari. Additional information comes from two 17th-century manuscripts written in Timbuktu, the &quot;Tarikh Ibn al-Mukhtar&quot; and the &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot;. Oral tradition, as performed by the &quot;jeliw&quot; ( &quot;jeli&quot;), also known as griots, includes relatively little information about Musa relative to some other parts of the history of Mali, with his predecessor conquerors receiving more prominence.

==Lineage==

According to Djibril Tamsir Niane, Musa&#x27;s father was named Faga Leye and his mother may have been named Kanku. Faga Leye was the son of Abu Bakr, a brother of Sunjata, the first mansa of the Mali Empire. Ibn Khaldun does not mention Faga Leye, referring to Musa as Musa ibn Abu Bakr. This can be interpreted as either &quot;Musa son of Abu Bakr&quot; or &quot;Musa descendant of Abu Bakr.&quot; It is implausible that Abu Bakr was Musa&#x27;s father, due to the amount of time between Sunjata&#x27;s reign and Musa&#x27;s.

Ibn Battuta, who visited Mali during the reign of Musa&#x27;s brother Sulayman, said that Musa&#x27;s grandfather was named Sariq Jata. Sariq Jata may be another name for Sunjata, who was actually Musa&#x27;s great-uncle. This, along with Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s use of the name &#x27;Musa ibn Abu Bakr&#x27; prompted historian Francois-Xavier Fauvelle to propose that Musa was in fact the son of Abu Bakr I, a grandson of Sunjata through his daughter. Later attempts to erase this possibly illegitimate succession through the female line led to the confusion in the sources over Musa&#x27;s parentage. Hostility towards Musa&#x27;s branch of the Keita dynasty would also explain his relative absence from or scathing treatment by oral histories.

==Early life and accession to power==
The date of Musa&#x27;s birth is unknown, but he appears to have been a young man in 1324. The &quot;Tarikh al-fattash&quot; claims that Musa accidentally killed Kanku at some point prior to his hajj.

Musa ascended to power in the early 1300s under unclear circumstances. According to Musa&#x27;s own account, his predecessor as Mansa of Mali, presumably Muhammad ibn Qu, launched two expeditions to explore the Atlantic Ocean (200 ships for the first exploratory mission and 2,000 ships for the second). The Mansa led the second expedition himself and appointed Musa as his deputy to rule the empire until he returned. When he did not return, Musa was crowned as mansa himself, marking a transfer of the line of succession from the descendants of Sunjata to the descendants of his brother Abu Bakr. Some modern historians have cast doubt on Musa&#x27;s version of events, suggesting he may have deposed his predecessor and devised the story about the voyage to explain how he took power. Nonetheless, the possibility of such a voyage has been taken seriously by several historians.

==Early reign==

Musa was a young man when he became &quot;Mansa&quot;, possibly in his early twenties. Given the grandeur of his subsequent &quot;hajj&quot;, it is likely that Musa spent much of his early reign preparing for it. Among these preparations would likely have been raids to capture and enslave people from neighboring lands, as Musa&#x27;s entourage would include many thousands of slaves; the historian Michael Gomez estimates that Mali may have captured over 6,000 slaves per year for this purpose. Perhaps because of this, Musa&#x27;s early reign was spent in continuous military conflict with neighboring non-Muslim societies. In 1324, while in Cairo, Musa said that he had conquered 24 cities and their surrounding districts.

==Pilgrimage to Mecca==

Musa was a Muslim, and his hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca, made him well known across North Africa and the Middle East. To Musa, Islam was &quot;an entry into the cultured world of the Eastern Mediterranean&quot;. He would have spent much time fostering the growth of the religion within his empire. When Musa departed Mali for the Hajj, he left his son Muhammad to rule in his absence.

Musa made his pilgrimage between 1324 and 1325, spanning 2700 miles. His procession reportedly included upwards of 12,000 slaves, all wearing brocade and Yemeni silk and each carrying of gold bars, with heralds dressed in silks bearing gold staffs organizing horses and handling bags.

Musa provided all necessities for the procession, feeding the entire company of men and animals. Those animals included 80 camels, which each carried of gold dust. Musa gave the gold to the poor he met along his route. Musa not only gave to the cities he passed on the way to Mecca, including Cairo and Medina, but also traded gold for souvenirs. It was reported that he built a mosque every Friday. Shihab al-Din al-&#x27;Umari, who visited Cairo shortly after Musa&#x27;s pilgrimage to Mecca, noted that it was &quot;a lavish display of power, wealth, and unprecedented by its size and pageantry&quot;. Musa made a major point of showing off his nation&#x27;s wealth.

Musa and his entourage arrived at the outskirts of Cairo in July 1324. They camped for three days by the Pyramids of Giza before crossing the Nile into Cairo on 19 July. While in Cairo, Musa met with the Mamluk sultan al-Nasir Muhammad, whose reign had already seen one &quot;mansa&quot;, Sakura, make the Hajj. Al-Nasir expected Musa to prostrate himself before him, which Musa initially refused to do. When Musa did finally bow he said he was doing so for God alone.

Despite this initial awkwardness, the two rulers got along well and exchanged gifts. Musa and his entourage gave and spent freely while in Cairo. Musa stayed in the Qarafa district of Cairo and befriended its governor, ibn Amir Hajib, who learned much about Mali from him. Musa stayed in Cairo for three months, departing on 18 October with the official caravan to Mecca.

Musa&#x27;s generosity continued as he traveled onward to Mecca, and he gave gifts to fellow pilgrims and the people of Medina and Mecca. While in Mecca, conflict broke out between a group of Malian pilgrims and a group of Turkic pilgrims in the Masjid al-Haram. Swords were drawn, but before the situation escalated further, Musa persuaded his men to back down.

Musa and his entourage lingered in Mecca after the last day of the Hajj. Traveling separately from the main caravan, their return journey to Cairo was struck by catastrophe. By the time they reached Suez, many of the Malian pilgrims had died of cold, starvation, or bandit raids, and they had lost much of their supplies. Having run out of money, Musa and his entourage were forced to borrow money and resell much of what they had purchased while in Cairo before the Hajj, and Musa went into debt to several merchants such as Siraj al-Din. However, Al-Nasir Muhammad returned Musa&#x27;s earlier show of generosity with gifts of his own.

On his return journey, Musa met the Andalusi poet Abu Ishaq al-Sahili, whose eloquence and knowledge of jurisprudence impressed him, and whom he convinced to travel with him to Mali. Other scholars Musa brought to Mali included Maliki jurists.

According to the &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot;, the cities of Gao and Timbuktu submitted to Musa&#x27;s rule as he traveled through on his return to Mali. It is unlikely, however, that a group of pilgrims, even if armed, would have been able to conquer a wealthy and powerful city. According to one account given by ibn Khaldun, Musa&#x27;s general Saghmanja conquered Gao. The other account claims that Gao had been conquered during the reign of Mansa Sakura. Mali&#x27;s control of Gao may have been weak, requiring powerful mansas to reassert their authority periodically, or it might simply be an error on the part of al-Sadi, author of the &quot;Tarikh&quot;.

==Later reign==

===Construction in Mali===
Musa embarked on a large building program, raising mosques and madrasas in Timbuktu and Gao. Most notably, the ancient center of learning Sankore Madrasah (or University of Sankore) was constructed during his reign.

In Niani, Musa built the Hall of Audience, a building communicating by an interior door to the royal palace. It was &quot;an admirable Monument&quot;, surmounted by a dome and adorned with arabesques of striking colours. The wooden window frames of an upper storey were plated with silver foil; those of a lower storey with gold. Like the Great Mosque, a contemporaneous and grandiose structure in Timbuktu, the Hall was built of cut stone.

During this period, there was an advanced level of urban living in the major centers of Mali. Sergio Domian, an Italian scholar of art and architecture, wrote of this period: &quot;Thus was laid the foundation of an urban civilization. At the height of its power, Mali had at least 400 cities, and the interior of the Niger Delta was very densely populated.&quot;

===Economy and education===

It is recorded that Mansa Musa traveled through the cities of Timbuktu and Gao on his way to Mecca, and made them a part of his empire when he returned around 1325. He brought architects from Andalusia, a region in Spain, and Cairo to build his grand palace in Timbuktu and the great Djinguereber Mosque that still stands.

Timbuktu soon became the center of trade, culture, and Islam; markets brought in merchants from Hausaland, Egypt, and other African kingdoms, a university was founded in the city (as well as in the Malian cities of Djenné and Ségou), and Islam was spread through the markets and university, making Timbuktu a new area for Islamic scholarship. News of the Malian empire&#x27;s city of wealth even traveled across the Mediterranean to southern Europe, where traders from Venice, Granada, and Genoa soon added Timbuktu to their maps to trade manufactured goods for gold.

The University of Sankore in Timbuktu was restaffed under Musa&#x27;s reign with jurists, astronomers, and mathematicians. The university became a center of learning and culture, drawing Muslim scholars from around Africa and the Middle East to Timbuktu.

In 1330, the kingdom of Mossi invaded and conquered the city of Timbuktu. Gao had already been captured by Musa&#x27;s general, and Musa quickly regained Timbuktu, built a rampart and stone fort, and placed a standing army to protect the city from future invaders. While Musa&#x27;s palace has since vanished, the university and mosque still stand in Timbuktu.

==Death==
The date of Mansa Musa&#x27;s death is uncertain. Using the reign lengths reported by Ibn Khaldun to calculate back from the death of Mansa Suleyman in 1360, Musa would have died in 1332. However, Ibn Khaldun also reports that Musa sent an envoy to congratulate Abu al-Hasan Ali for his conquest of Tlemcen, which took place in May 1337, but by the time Abu al-Hasan sent an envoy in response, Musa had died and Suleyman was on the throne, suggesting Musa died in 1337. In contrast, al-Umari, writing twelve years after Musa&#x27;s hajj, in approximately 1337, claimed that Musa returned to Mali intending to abdicate and return to live in Mecca but died before he could do so, suggesting he died even earlier than 1332. It is possible that it was actually Musa&#x27;s son Maghan who congratulated Abu al-Hasan, or Maghan who received Abu al-Hasan&#x27;s envoy after Musa&#x27;s death. The latter possibility is corroborated by Ibn Khaldun calling Suleyman Musa&#x27;s son in that passage, suggesting he may have confused Musa&#x27;s brother Suleyman with Musa&#x27;s son Maghan. Alternatively, it is possible that the four-year reign Ibn Khaldun credits Maghan with actually referred to his ruling Mali while Musa was away on the hajj, and he only reigned briefly in his own right. Nehemia Levtzion regarded 1337 as the most likely date, which has been accepted by other scholars.

==Legacy==
Musa&#x27;s reign is commonly regarded as Mali&#x27;s golden age, but this perception may be the result of his reign being the best recorded by Arabic sources, rather than him necessarily being the wealthiest and most powerful mansa of Mali. The territory of the Mali Empire was at its height during the reigns of Musa and his brother Sulayman, and covered the Sudan-Sahel region of West Africa.

Musa is less renowned in Mandé oral tradition as performed by the &quot;jeliw&quot;. He is criticized for being unfaithful to tradition, and some of the &quot;jeliw&quot; regard Musa as having wasted Mali&#x27;s wealth. However, some aspects of Musa appear to have been incorporated into a figure in Mandé oral tradition known as Fajigi, which translates as &quot;father of hope&quot;. Fajigi is remembered as having traveled to Mecca to retrieve ceremonial objects known as &quot;boliw&quot;, which feature in Mandé traditional religion. As Fajigi, Musa is sometimes conflated with a figure in oral tradition named Fakoli, who is best known as Sunjata&#x27;s top general. The figure of Fajigi combines both Islam and traditional beliefs.

The name &quot;Musa&quot; has become virtually synonymous with pilgrimage in Mandé tradition, such that other figures who are remembered as going on a pilgrimage, such as Fakoli, are also called Musa.

===Wealth===

Mansa Musa is renowned for his wealth and generosity. Online articles in the 21st century have claimed that Mansa Musa was the richest person of all time. Historians such as Hadrien Collet have argued that Musa&#x27;s wealth is impossible to calculate accurately. Contemporary Arabic sources may have been trying to express that Musa had more gold than they thought possible, rather than trying to give an exact number. Further, it is difficult meaningfully to compare the wealth of historical figures such as Mansa Musa, due both to the difficulty of separating the personal wealth of a monarch from the wealth of the state and to the difficulty of comparing wealth across highly different societies. Musa may have taken as much as 18 tons of gold on his hajj, equal in value to over US$1.397 billion in 2024. Musa himself further promoted the appearance of having vast, inexhaustible wealth by spreading rumors that gold grew like a plant in his kingdom.

According to some Arabic writers, Musa&#x27;s gift-giving caused a depreciation in the value of gold in Egypt. Al-Umari said that before Musa&#x27;s arrival a &quot;mithqal&quot; of gold was worth 25 silver &quot;dirhams&quot;, but that it dropped to less than 22 &quot;dirhams&quot; afterward and did not go above that number for at least twelve years. Though this has been described as having &quot;wrecked&quot; Egypt&#x27;s economy, the historian Warren Schultz has argued that this was well within normal fluctuations in the value of gold in Mamluk Egypt.

The wealth of the Mali Empire did not come from direct control of gold-producing regions, but rather trade and tribute. The gold Musa brought on his pilgrimage probably represented years of accumulated tribute that Musa would have spent much of his early reign gathering. Another source of income for Mali during Musa&#x27;s reign was taxation of the copper trade.

According to several contemporary authors, such as Ibn Battuta, Ibn al-Dawadari and al-Umari, Mansa Musa ran out of money during his journey to Mecca and had to borrow from Egyptian merchants at a high rate of interest on his return journey. Al-Umari and Ibn Khaldun state that the moneylenders were either never repaid or only partly repaid. Other sources disagree as to whether they were eventually and fully compensated.

===Character===
Arabic writers, such as Ibn Battuta and Abdallah ibn Asad al-Yafii, praised Musa&#x27;s generosity, virtue, and intelligence. Ibn Khaldun said that he &quot;was an upright man and a great king, and tales of his justice are still told.&quot;

<text>Emanuel van Meteren or Meteeren (1535 – 11 April 1612) was a Flemish historian and Consul for &quot;the Traders of the Low Countries&quot; in London. He was born in Antwerp, the son of Sir Jacobus van Meteren, Dutch financier and publisher of early English versions of the Bible, and Ottilia Ortellius, of the famous Ortellius family of mapmakers, and nephew of the cartographer Abraham Ortelius.

==Biographical notes==
As a historian Van Meteren was special in that he was not merely a chronicler of the events of his time, but also a powerful and wealthy man who influenced those events:

The van Meteren family...had fled the Netherlands for religious reasons. Van Meteren’s father, Jacob, played a key role in the publication of the first English Bible in the 1530s, and the family established itself as a pillar of the Protestant refugee community in London. As an adult, Emmanuel lived on Lime Street, became the consul for the Dutch merchants in London, and occupied the all-important office of postmaster. Reliable mail service was an essential component of any natural history network, since specimens ranging from tulip bulbs to rhinoceros horns needed to circulate between interested naturalists. Accompanying these specimens, of course, were the letters on which the European natural history community in particular, and the Republic of Letters more generally, depended in order to thrive...[V]an Meteren’s skillful management of the post...made him indispensable. When the artist Marcus Gheeraerts wanted to send smoked herring to Antwerp, or Ortelius wanted gifts to arrive at his sister’s house in London, they inevitably went through Emmanuel van Meteren and his formidable network of middlemen, merchants, sailors, and travelers to ensure that precious messages and gifts reached their destination.

In 1581 he was the Consul representing Dutch merchants in London. In that year, William the Silent, Prince of Orange, enlisted van Meteren&#x27;s help in a bit of subterfuge in a larger effort to undermine the plots of Bernardino de Mendoza, Spain&#x27;s Ambassador at the Court of Queen Elizabeth. William enlisted a ship&#x27;s captain, Willem Janszoon van Hoorn, to pretend to accept a bribe from de Mendoza; to avoid trickery, de Mendoza held van Hoorn&#x27;s son as a hostage. Since trickery was indeed intended, William sent his fourth secretary, Christiaen, to sneak the boy out of the Spanish Embassy in London, at which point van Meteren concealed them and helped effect their escape.

In 1599 van Meteren wrote a book titled &quot;Belgische ofte Nederlandsche Historie van onzen Tijden,&quot; detailing the events of the first part of the Eighty Years&#x27; War between the Netherlands and Spain. Some of the accounts detail events that van Meteren actually witnessed. For instance he was with Maurice of Orange during the siege of Zaltbommel by the Spaniards.

After Henry Hudson returned from his second voyage he related to van Meteren that there had been a mutiny in 1609, originating in quarrels between Dutch and English sailors. Van Meteren had access to Hudson&#x27;s journals, charts and logbooks, and recorded these events in &quot;Historie der Nederlanden.&quot;

He also chronicled the adventures and demise of the French merchant François Le Fort.

Van Meteren is also the author of &quot;Historia Belgica.&quot;

<text>Wang Pi (; died 805?) was a Chinese calligrapher and politician of the Tang dynasty, who was a close associate of Emperor Shunzong (Li Song). He, along with his ally Wang Shuwen, was powerful during Emperor Shunzong&#x27;s brief reign in 805, but soon lost power and died in exile.

== Background and service under Li Song as crown prince ==
It is not known when Wang Pi was born, but it is known that his family was from Hang Prefecture (杭州, in modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang). He was at some point made a reserve official at Hanlin Institute (翰林院), where imperial scholars gathered, and later made a member of the staff of Li Song—then crown prince under his father Emperor Dezong. It was said that he became favored by Li Song because of his abilities in calligraphy, and he became a close associate of Li Song&#x27;s, having easy access to Li Song&#x27;s palace and often spending time with Li Song in leisure activities. He and another close associate of Li Song&#x27;s, Wang Shuwen, became friends and allies.

== During Emperor Shunzong&#x27;s reign ==
In late 804, Li Song suffered a debilitating stroke that left him partially paralyzed and unable to speak. When Emperor Dezong died on February 25, 805, there were initially some eunuchs who suggested that someone else should succeed Emperor Dezong, but at the strong advocacy of the imperial scholar Wei Cigong (衛次公), Li Song&#x27;s succession was not further questioned despite his illness. To show that he was still not completely incapacitated, Li Song was forced to personally show himself to the imperial guards, and he took the throne (as Emperor Shunzong).

However, Emperor Shunzong remained seriously ill, and he was often attended to only by the eunuch Li Zhongyan (李忠言) and his concubine Consort Niu. Much of the decisions on important matters of state were entrusted to Wang Pi and Wang Shuwen, both of whom were named imperial scholar and was largely making decisions at the Hanlin Institute. Under Wang Shuwen&#x27;s recommendation, Wei Zhiyi was made a chancellor, and it was said that Wei, Wang Shuwen, Wang Pi, Li Zhongyan, and Consort Niu formed a group of decision makers. It was said that much authority were also delegated to Han Tai (韓泰), Liu Zongyuan, and Liu Yuxi, and that Wang Shuwen was effectively the leader. His associates were also said to be praising each other and comparing each other to such great historical figures as Yi Yin, the Duke of Zhou, Guan Zhong, and Zhuge Liang. Many officials were being promoted and demoted based on their recommendations. Wang Pi also received the office of &quot;Zuo Sanqi Changshi&quot; (左散騎常侍), a high-level consultant at the examination bureau of government (門下省, &quot;Menxia Sheng&quot;).

Traditional historical accounts painted an unflattering picture of Wang Pi—describing him as ugly in appearance, lacking ambitions in accomplishment, and speaking in Wu tongue. It was said that Wang Pi was taking a large amount of bribes, and that his house had no closets or regular chests, but a single large chest in which he stored his treasure; at night, he and his wife would sleep on it.

In summer 805, when the powerful eunuch Ju Wenzhen (俱文珍) had Wang Shuwen technically promoted—to be the deputy minister of census—but removed from the post of imperial scholar, thus disallowing him from attending to matters of state at Hanlin Institute—Wang Pi interceded with Emperor Shunzong on Wang Shuwen&#x27;s behalf, and Wang Shuwen was allowed to visit Hanlin Institute once every three to five days. Soon, however, Wang Shuwen&#x27;s mother died, and he was forced to leave governmental service to observe a mourning period. Left without his main ally, it was said that Wang Pi became panicked, and he made repeated petitions to have Wang Shuwen recalled to government service to be chancellor, to no avail. In fall 805, knowing that he and his allies were near defeat, Wang Pi claimed to have suffered a stroke and no longer attended to governmental matters.

== Death ==
Late in 805, Emperor Shunzong yielded the throne to his son Li Chun the Crown Prince (as Emperor Xianzong). Even before he was formally enthroned, Emperor Xianzong immediately had Wang Shuwen and Wang Pi exiled, on September 2—in Wang Pi&#x27;s case, to be the military advisor to the prefect of Kai Prefecture (開州, in modern Chongqing). It was said that Wang Pi soon died in exile, and it was implied that that was later in 805.

<doc id="159798" wikidata="Q1535516" url="?curid=159798" title="Gospel Music Association">
<text>The Gospel Music Association (GMA) is a nonprofit organization founded in 1964 for the purpose of supporting and promoting the development of all forms of gospel music. As of 2011, there are about 4,000 members worldwide. The GMA&#x27;s membership comprises a network of artists, industry leaders, retail stores, radio stations, concert promoters and local churches involved with the wider Christian music industry.

== History ==

The GMA was founded in 1964 to promote gospel music. It was created as an extension of the National Quartet Convention, a convention devoted to Southern gospel that had been operating since 1956. Its founding board included Don Butler, Cecil and James Blackwood, Vestal Goodman, Charlie Lamb, Don Light, and J.D. Sumner, and its first president was Tennessee Ernie Ford. In its early years, it faced competition from the United States Gospel Music Association, a for-profit entity also focused on gospel music. It began organizing the Dove Awards in 1969, which eventually expanded into an awards ceremony covering the whole of Christian music. The Dove Awards had their 50th ceremony in 2019. By 1976, the GMA was well-established, with its award show bringing recognition to Christian music.

In the 1970s and 1980s, tension and conflict emerged between Southern gospel and the newer developments of Jesus music and Contemporary Christian music. Southern gospel conservatives had been resistant to racial integration, and even as they were slowly becoming more receptive to integration, the new developments in Christian music resulted in Southern gospel becoming increasingly marginalized by music consumers and losing influence in the GMA. Many Southern conservatives, including members of the GMA, also disapproved of rock music and felt that the newer styles of gospel music being promoted by the GMA indicated that the organization was essentially moving into an alliance with the &quot;enemy&quot;. The Southern gospel industry became disenchanted with the direction that the GMA was heading and a new organization, the Southern Gospel Music Association, was formed by Charles Waller. However, in 1985, this organization was absorbed by the GMA. A new, independent Southern Gospel Music Association was formed in 1995.

== Events ==

In April of every year for several years, the GMA held GMA Week (or GMA Music Week) around Nashville, Tennessee. The week-long event includes seminars, concerts and &quot;meet and greet&quot; events for artists, industry workers and members of the media. &quot;GMA Music Week&quot; ends with the annual GMA Dove Awards ceremony, which honors contemporary Christian and gospel music. The GMA began holding the Dove Awards in the Grand Ole Opry in the 1990s and arranged for the ceremony to be broadcast on the Family Channel, raising its public profile.

Annually held in Estes Park, Colorado from 1974 to 2008, &quot;Music in the Rockies&quot; (formally Seminar in the Rockies) was a showcase event for aspiring (often unsigned) songwriters and artists in the Christian music industry. This event was replaced by a new event, &quot;Immerse&quot;, in Nashville in 2009. The GMA also founded the Gospel Music Academy, which trains musicians, hosts artists-in-residence (which have included Cindy Morgan and Michael W. Smith), and organizes seminars on issues related to the music industry.

== Gospel Music Hall of Fame ==

The GMA Gospel Music Hall of Fame, which was created in 1971, is dedicated exclusively to recognizing meaningful contributions of individuals in all forms of gospel music. Inductees include Elvis Presley, Mahalia Jackson, Keith Green, Larry Norman, The Blackwood Brothers, The Imperials, J. D. Sumner and The Stamps, The Jordanaires and others. The Gospel Music Hall of Fame is overseen by the GMA Foundation, a &quot;sister organization&quot; established by the GMA to focus on gospel music history and education.

== Positions and controversies ==

In 1971, a scandal broke out over the 4th GMA Dove Awards when The Blackwood Brothers, some of whose membership was also part of the GMA leadership, won almost every award for which they were eligible, a total of nine out of fourteen awards. The group was accused of unfairly stacking the vote through an aggressive recruitment campaign, with some industry members accusing the group of also distributing &quot;marked ballots, gifts and free memberships.&quot; As a result of the controversy, all awards from that year were stripped and James Blackwood, a GMA board member, took responsibility for what he called &quot;unethical behavior.&quot;

The GMA has staunchly supported anti-music piracy efforts, and launched its own antipiracy campaign in 2004. In 2011, the GMA appeared on a list of organizations supporting the &quot;Stop Online Piracy Act&quot; (SOPA) before the U.S. Congress.

The GMA drew criticism from Kirk Franklin after his speech at the 2019 Dove Awards, which addressed shooting bias in police violence, was censored. The GMA later issued Franklin a formal apology.

The aircraft carrier was initially ordered for construction by Britain&#x27;s [[Royal Navy]] asHMS &quot;Powerful during the Second World War.

During her career &quot;Bonaventure&quot; carried three hull identification numbers, RML 22, RRSM 22 and CVL 22. Following her decommissioning &quot;Bonaventure&quot; was sold for scrap and broken up in Taiwan.

The American 3-inch/50-calibre guns were chosen over 40 mm guns. &quot;Bonaventure&quot; had a distinct appearance compared to her sister ships as she had a tall lattice mast, raked funnel and large sponson where the 3-inch guns were situated. Adding to her distinct appearance, was that &quot;Bonaventure&quot; was completed with United States Navy radar, specifically the SPS-8A height finder and the SPS-12 air search radar.

=== Aircraft ===
As part of the modernized design, &quot;Bonaventure&quot; was equipped with three relatively new technologies in relation to her air complement. The &quot;Majestic&quot; subclass&#x27; design allowed for heavier aircraft, those up to landing at , to be launched and recovered. &quot;Bonaventure&quot; improved on that limit, able to land aircraft of up to . The aircraft lifts were enlarged to in order to accommodate larger aircraft. The new design also incorporated an angled flight deck, steam catapults, and optical landing system. The angled flight deck increased the carrier&#x27;s landing area without limiting space for aircraft parking and allowed for the removal of antiquated crash barriers.

During her service life, &quot;Bonaventure&quot; carried five squadrons. The aircraft carrier&#x27;s initial air group was composed of sixteen McDonnell F2H Banshee jet fighters and eight Grumman CS2F Tracker anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft. The Banshee, flown by VF 870 and VF 871, and Tracker, operated by VS 880 and VS 881, were flown from &quot;Bonaventure&quot;, along with Sikorsky HO4S ASW helicopters operated by HS 50.

The Banshees were a tight fit, with &quot;Bonaventure&quot; barely able to accommodate them. The Trackers did not become fully operational aboard until 1959. Despite this, &quot;Bonaventure&quot; conducted sustained around-the-clock operations, keeping four Trackers and two HO4Ss in the air at all times, while monitoring an area of . The HO4Ss were equipped with dipping sonar and, beginning in 1958, Mark 43 torpedoes. The Banshees were retired in 1962 but were not replaced. The ship&#x27;s role then changed to one of pure ASW and the air wing was modified, dropping the fighters but keeping the eight Trackers, and increasing the number of HO4Ss to fourteen. In 1963, the aircraft carrier began a refit in order to allow her operate the new Sikorsky CHSS-2 Sea King helicopters, which had been ordered to replace the HO4Ss. When &quot;Bonaventure&quot; was retired, her former aircraft continued to operate from shore installations, including CFB Shearwater.

===Construction and acquisition===

The British government ordered a second hull constructed of what would become the &quot;Majestic&quot; class on 16 October 1942 once a dock opened at Harland &amp; Wolff&#x27;s shipyard in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The aircraft carrier&#x27;s keel was laid down on 21 November 1943 with the yard number 1229 and the British Admiralty chose the name &quot;Powerful&quot; for the ship. &quot;Powerful&quot; was launched on 27 February 1945. Work was suspended in May 1946 following the end of the Second World War, and the hull was laid up incomplete at Belfast.

In 1952, the Royal Canadian Navy was looking to replace their existing aircraft carrier . On 23 April, the Canadian government authorized the expenditure of $21 million to acquire &quot;Powerful&quot;. The Royal Canadian Navy had also been offered a &quot;Hermes&quot;-class aircraft carrier by the United Kingdom but found it too costly and two s on loan from the United States Navy, also considered too costly. The choice of &quot;Powerful&quot; was made due to cost considerations as well as financial support for the United Kingdom. Agreement on the purchase of &quot;Powerful&quot; was reached on 29 November but was back-dated to 12 July. Work on &quot;Powerful&quot; resumed, this time to a modernized design incorporating recent carrier operation developments, such as the angled flight deck and steam catapults. The design changes cost a further $10 million. Other changes that were incorporated were American radar and armament. Construction was completed on 17 January 1957, and the vessel was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy at Belfast as HMCS &quot;Bonaventure&quot; with Captain H.V. Gross in command. The vessel was christened by the wife of the Canadian Minister of National Defence, Ralph Campney.

===Early service===
&quot;Bonaventure&quot; was named for Bonaventure Island, a bird sanctuary in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and was the first aircraft carrier owned outright by Canada, initially tasked with trade protection. In March 1957, the aircraft carrier began trials in the English Channel with her aircraft. &quot;Bonaventure&quot; sailed for Canada on 19 June and arrived at her home port, Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 26 June, carrying the experimental hydrofoil to Canada on her flight deck. In October, the aircraft carrier began further trials with her air group composed of VF 870 (Banshee), VS 881 (Tracker) and one HO4S helicopter in the Caribbean Sea that lasted until early 1958. This included cross-deck operations with the Royal Navy aircraft carrier . On 2 October, a Banshee fighter flying from &quot;Bonaventure&quot; to the naval air base HMCS &quot;Shearwater&quot; was lost at sea. The resulting search did not find the plane or the pilot. Captain William Landymore became the ship&#x27;s senior officer on 15 January 1958. On 25 February 1958, a Banshee crashed into the sea after takeoff and the pilot was killed. On 4 March, a Banshee suffered another fatal crash, as the aircraft made a normal deck landing, an apparent brake failure caused the fighter to flip over the port side of the aircraft carrier, killing the pilot. Later in the year, &quot;Bonaventure&quot; participated in the naval exercises New Broom IX and Sharp Squall IV. During Sharp Squall IV a Banshee was lost off the bow of the ship during takeoff. This time, the pilot was recovered by the destroyer . In November 1958, while operating off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, &quot;Bonaventure&quot; and her escorts made contact with a Soviet Navy submarine while patrolling around a group of Russian fishing trawlers. The aircraft carrier ended the year with a visit to the United Kingdom before going into refit at Saint John, New Brunswick. On 12 September 1959, Captain John O&#x27;Brien took command of the ship.
In 1960, NATO reorganized their defence of the North Atlantic and the Canadian contribution to the new plan centred around an ASW hunter-killer group led by &quot;Bonaventure&quot;. The aircraft carrier rejoined the fleet in November 1960, embarking VF 870 (Banshee), VS 880 (Tracker) and HS 50 (HO4S) squadrons. Beginning in February 1961, &quot;Bonaventure&quot; took part in the naval exercise Toput Droit, followed by a period spent training with the United States Atlantic Fleet in the summer and further naval exercises in October. Captain F.C. Frewer took over command of the ship on 30 August 1961. In April 1962, &quot;Bonaventure&quot; had her 10,000th deck landing by an aircraft (a Tracker). On 30 September 1962, Canada withdrew the Banshee fleet and &quot;Bonaventure&quot;″s mission changed to a purely anti-submarine warfare one. The air group was then composed solely of VS 880 and HS 50 squadrons.

On 13 October 1962, at the onset of the Cuban Missile Crisis, &quot;Bonaventure&quot; and the 1st Canadian Escort Squadron were sailing through United Kingdom territorial waters. As the crisis deepened, &quot;Bonaventure&quot; and her escorts were recalled to Canada. The ship returned to her homeport following the crisis and in January 1963, began a refit at Saint John. During the refit, the ship was modified for the operation of the Sea King helicopters. The aircraft carrier rejoined the fleet in May, but suffered a boiler explosion while in port at Halifax. Repairs took six weeks to complete. On 7 August, Captain Robert Timbrell took command of the vessel. That year &quot;Bonaventure&quot; took part in the Sharp Squall naval exercise and in September, participated in testing ASW defences in the Greenland-Iceland gap. That was followed by cross-deck operations with the aircraft carrier .

===Mid-life refit and fate===
The 1964 Navy estimates called for the major refit of &quot;Bonaventure&quot; in order to extend the aircraft carrier&#x27;s service life. While the Canadian Naval Board planned the carrier&#x27;s upcoming refit, &quot;Bonaventure&quot; participated in the naval exercise Gooey Duck which included training off Bermuda in January and in February, sailed to the Mediterranean Sea. While there, &quot;Bonaventure&quot; was recalled to Canada to embark troops from the Canadian Royal 22nd Regiment for service in a United Nations peacekeeping venture. Called Operation Snow Goose, 95 soldiers, 54 vehicles and 400 tons of stores were loaded aboard the aircraft carrier and the ship disembarked them at Famagusta, Cyprus on 30 March. &quot;Bonaventure&quot; then returned to Canada before sailing to Norfolk, Virginia, for trials with the A-4 Skyhawk, a possible replacement for the Banshee. However, due to financial considerations, the Skyhawk was not purchased. In December, &quot;Bonaventure&quot; began sea trials with the Sea King helicopter.

In January 1965, &quot;Bonaventure&quot;″s air group was composed of VS 880 (Tracker), HS 50 (Sea King), an HO4S plane guard from HU 21 squadron and a COD Tracker from VU 32 squadron. From February to March 1965, &quot;Bonaventure&quot; took part in naval exercises and in May, visited the United Kingdom. On 2 April 1965, Captain Henry Porter became the commanding officer of the aircraft carrier. In June, &quot;Bonaventure&quot; visited the Joint Anti-Submarine School at Londonderry and took part in joint operations in the Southwest Approaches with and HNLMS &quot;Karel Doorman&quot;. The following year in January, &quot;Bonaventure&quot;, along with six escorts, took part in the largest Canadian naval activity in the Caribbean Sea and South American waters. During the exercise, the ship visited Rio de Janeiro in February and in March, returned to Halifax.

Beginning in April 1966, the carrier began a mid-life refit at Davie Shipbuilding in Lauzon, Quebec. The initial estimate for the refit was $8 million. However, during the refit, numerous issues with the ship, which had been present since construction, were found and led to cost overruns and delays. In the end, the refit took 18 months and cost $17 million, both behind schedule and well over budget. The refit was complete in August 1967. During her refit, Captain A. T. Brice became the ship&#x27;s commanding officer on 1 August 1966. &quot;Bonaventure&quot; rejoined the fleet in November 1967 with a new commanding officer, Captain R. H. Falls, who had taken command on 21 November 1966.

Following the 1968 Unification of the Canadian Forces, the Royal Canadian Navy ceased to exist and &quot;Bonaventure&quot; and naval aviation were merged with the rest of the Canadian Armed Forces, with naval aviation no longer under the jurisdiction of the navy. In February 1968, &quot;Bonaventure&quot; took part in a naval exercise in which a Sea King ditched into the sea. The crew were recovered alive and the helicopter was salvaged. In March, the ship visited New Orleans, Louisiana, before spending the next two months in military exercises. 1969 was spent training with the United States Navy and participating in the naval exercise Peace Keeper off Ireland. On 9 April 1969, Captain J. M. Cutts became the senior officer aboard the aircraft carrier. &quot;Bonaventure&quot; visited Portsmouth before sailing to Canada on 22 October 1969. As the Canadian military sought to cut spending, &quot;Bonaventure&quot; was deemed surplus and the last night deck landing took place on 28 October, followed by a visit to Boston, Massachusetts, before the last deck landing aboard &quot;Bonaventure&quot; took place on 12 December 1969.

A few last missions were left for &quot;Bonaventure&quot;. On 9 January 1970, Captain H. W. Vondette became the final commanding officer of &quot;Bonaventure&quot;. In January 1970, the aircraft carrier (minus her aircraft) was sent to carry troops of the Royal 22nd Regiment to Jamaica for training exercises. In February, &quot;Bonaventure&quot; was used as a replenishment oiler to replenish the fuel stores of frigates taking part in Exercise Maple Spring. During this operation, &quot;Bonaventure&quot; had six Sea Kings of HS 50 aboard. In April the ship was sent to recover Canadian forces from Narvik, Norway, after a military exercise and made a final visit to Portsmouth on the way back to Canada.

&quot;Bonaventure&quot; was decommissioned at HMC Dockyard in Halifax on 3 July 1970, and sold for disposal. During the component recovery process, parts from &quot;Bonaventure&quot; steam catapult were used to undertake repairs to the catapult of her sister ship, of the Royal Australian Navy. The vessel was purchased by Tung Chen S Steel Company of Taiwan for scrap and broken up in 1971.

==Commemoration==
&quot;Bonaventure&quot; had two ships&#x27; anchors. One anchor is preserved at Point Pleasant Park in Halifax as the &quot;Bonaventure&quot; Anchor Memorial. The monument was dedicated in 1973 initially to aircrew lost at sea, but later to all naval personnel who died in service. The monument consists of the anchor and chains, along with a small chain running from the monument into the water to make the connection between monument and the sea. The anchor faces the mouth of the harbour. The names of navy and air force personnel who died during peacetime are etched into plaques beside the anchor. Her starboard anchor, donated by Maritime Command on 6 May 1998, is on display at Royal Military College Saint-Jean. Her two saluting guns are mounted at in Vancouver&#x27;s Stanley Park. The ship&#x27;s bell is preserved at the Shearwater Aviation Museum in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, which also hosts a large model and exhibit about the carrier.

<text>A Dove Award is an accolade by the Gospel Music Association (GMA) of the United States to recognize outstanding achievement in the Christian music industry. The awards ceremonies presented annually and have been held in Nashville, Tennessee except in 2011 and 2012 when they were held in Atlanta, Georgia. The ceremonies feature live musical performances and are broadcast on TBN.

The awards were established in 1969 and represent a variety of musical styles including rock, pop, hip hop, country, and urban.

==History==
The Dove Awards were originally conceptualized by Gospel singer and songwriter Bill Gaither at a Gospel Music Association board meeting in 1968. The idea of the award being represented by a dove is credited to Gaither and the design for the award itself is credited to gospel singer Les Beasley and designer Bob McConnell. The first GMA Dove Awards were held at the Peabody Hotel in Memphis, Tennessee in October 1969. In 1971, the awards moved to Nashville.

The 3rd GMA Dove Awards of 1971 were deemed invalid due to apparent ballot stuffing by the southern gospel group the Blackwood Brothers and that year is still not considered an official awards year by the Gospel Music Association. There were no awards held in 1979 due to a decision by the Gospel Music Association to move the awards from autumn to spring. Every ceremony since then has been held in the spring. The first televised ceremony was the 15th GMA Dove Awards of 1984 which aired on the Christian Broadcasting Network.

The awards were held in Nashville until 2011 before being presented at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia in 2012. They returned to Nashville in 2013, and have been held at the Allen Arena on the campus of Lipscomb University since.

==Categories==

Because of the large number of award categories (42 in 2012), and the desire to feature several performances by various artists, only the ones with the most popular interest are presented directly at the televised version of the award ceremony.

==Re-definition of gospel music==
In 1998, the GMA published a new definition of gospel music. According to the definition, to be considered eligible for the Dove Awards, music was required to have lyrics that were:

* Substantially based upon historically orthodox Christian truth contained in or derived from the Holy Bible
* An expression of worship of God or praise for His works
* Testimony of relationship with God through Christ
* Obviously prompted and informed by a Christian world view

Prior to the definition, the only qualified music was that sold in Christian Booksellers Association affiliated stores. The new standards resulted in complaints by some fans and artists after thirteen entries were disqualified as being too secular in the 1999 Dove Awards. The rules were rescinded afterwards and many groups disqualified by the rulings in 1999 were winners in 2000.

The GMA&#x27;s current policy states: &quot;From time to time, screening judges may encounter product submissions that raise questions about whether or not the product&#x27;s content is appropriate for the GMA Dove Awards. To assist the judges in their determination, the GMA Board has authorized the following content criteria for use in these instances: &#x27;For purposes of GMA Dove Award eligibility, the content of all entries will be based upon the historically orthodox Christian faith contained in or derived from the Holy Bible or apparently prompted and informed by a Christian world-view.&#x27;&quot;

<doc id="159806" wikidata="Q2849692" url="?curid=159806" title="Anglo-Irish people">
<text>Anglo-Irish people () denotes an ethnic, social and religious grouping who are mostly the descendants and successors of the English Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. They mostly belong to the Anglican Church of Ireland, which was the established church of Ireland until 1871, or to a lesser extent one of the English Dissenting churches, such as the Methodist Church, though some were Catholics. They often defined themselves as simply &quot;British&quot;, and less frequently &quot;Anglo-Irish&quot;, &quot;Irish&quot; or &quot;English&quot;. Many became eminent as administrators in the British Empire and as senior army and naval officers since the Kingdom of England and Great Britain were in a real union with the Kingdom of Ireland for over a century, before politically uniting into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801.

The term is not usually applied to Presbyterians in the province of Ulster, whose ancestry is mostly Lowland Scottish, rather than English or Irish, and who are sometimes identified as Ulster Scots. The Anglo-Irish hold a wide range of political views, with some being outspoken Irish nationalists, but most overall being Unionists. And while most of the Anglo-Irish originated in the English diaspora in Ireland, others were descended from families of the old Gaelic nobility of Ireland.

== As a social class ==

The term &quot;Anglo-Irish&quot; is often applied to the members of the Church of Ireland who made up the professional and landed class in Ireland from the 17th century up to the time of Irish independence in the early 20th century. In the course of the 17th century, this Anglo-Irish landed class replaced the Gaelic Irish and Old English aristocracies as the ruling class in Ireland. They were also referred to as &quot;New English&quot; to distinguish them from the &quot;Old English&quot;, who descended from the medieval Hiberno-Norman settlers.

Under the Penal Laws, which were in force between the 17th and 19th centuries (although enforced with varying degrees of severity), Roman Catholic recusants in Great Britain and Ireland were barred from holding public office, while in Ireland they were also barred from entry to Trinity College Dublin and from professions such as law, medicine, and the military. The lands of the recusant Roman Catholic landed gentry who refused to take the prescribed oaths were largely confiscated during the Plantations of Ireland. The rights of Roman Catholics to inherit landed property were severely restricted. Those who converted to the Church of Ireland were usually able to keep or regain their lost property, as the issue was considered primarily one of allegiance. In the late 18th century, the Parliament of Ireland in Dublin won legislative independence, and the movement for the repeal of the Test Acts began.

Not all Anglo-Irish people could trace their origins to the Protestant English settlers of the Cromwellian period; some were of Welsh stock, and others descended from Old English or even native Gaelic converts to Anglicanism. Members of this ruling class commonly identified themselves as Irish, while retaining English habits in politics, commerce, and culture. They participated in the popular English sports of the day, particularly racing and fox hunting, and intermarried with the ruling classes in Great Britain. Many of the more successful of them spent much of their careers either in Great Britain or in some part of the British Empire. Many constructed large country houses, which became known in Ireland as Big Houses, and these became symbolic of the class&#x27; dominance in Irish society.

The Dublin working class playwright Brendan Behan, a staunch Irish Republican, saw the Anglo-Irish as Ireland&#x27;s leisure class and famously defined an Anglo-Irishman as &quot;a Protestant with a horse&quot;.

The Anglo-Irish novelist and short story writer Elizabeth Bowen memorably described her experience as feeling &quot;English in Ireland, Irish in England&quot; and not accepted fully as belonging to either.

Due to their prominence in the military and their conservative politics, the Anglo-Irish have been compared to the Prussian Junker class by, among others, Correlli Barnett.

===Business interests===

At the beginning of the 20th century, the Anglo-Irish owned many of the major indigenous businesses in Ireland, such as Jacob&#x27;s Biscuits, Bewley&#x27;s, Beamish and Crawford, Jameson&#x27;s Whiskey, W. P. &amp; R. Odlum, Cleeve&#x27;s, R&amp;H Hall, Maguire &amp; Patterson, Dockrell&#x27;s, Arnott&#x27;s, Goulding Chemicals, the &quot;Irish Times&quot;, the Irish Railways, and the Guinness brewery, Ireland&#x27;s largest employer. They also controlled financial companies such as the Bank of Ireland and Goodbody Stockbrokers.

===Prominent members===

Prominent Anglo-Irish poets, writers, and playwrights include Oscar Wilde, Maria Edgeworth, Jonathan Swift, George Berkeley, Sheridan Le Fanu, Oliver Goldsmith, Laurence Sterne, George Darley, Lucy Knox, Bram Stoker, J. M. Synge, W. B. Yeats, Cecil Day-Lewis, Bernard Shaw, Augusta, Lady Gregory, Samuel Beckett, Giles Cooper, C. S. Lewis, Lord Longford, Elizabeth Bowen, William Trevor and William Allingham. The writer Lafcadio Hearn was of Anglo-Irish descent on his father&#x27;s side but was brought up as a Catholic by his great-aunt.

In the 19th century, some of the most prominent mathematical and physical scientists of the British Isles, including Sir William Rowan Hamilton, Sir George Stokes, John Tyndall, George Johnstone Stoney, Thomas Romney Robinson, Edward Sabine, Thomas Andrews, Lord Rosse, George Salmon, and George FitzGerald, were Anglo-Irish. In the 20th century, scientists John Joly and Ernest Walton were also Anglo-Irish, as was the polar explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton. Medical experts included Sir William Wilde, Robert Graves, Thomas Wrigley Grimshaw, William Stokes, Robert Collis, Sir John Lumsden and William Babington. The geographer William Cooley was one of the first to describe the process of globalization.

The Anglo-Irishmen Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Henry Grattan, Lord Castlereagh, George Canning, Lord Macartney, Thomas Spring Rice, Charles Stewart Parnell, and Edward Carson played major roles in British politics. Downing Street itself was named after Sir George Downing. In the Church, Bishop Richard Pococke contributed much to C18 travel writing.

The Anglo-Irish were also represented among the senior officers of the British Army by men such as Field Marshal Earl Roberts, first honorary Colonel of the Irish Guards regiment, who spent most of his career in British India; Field Marshal Viscount Gough, who served under Wellington, himself a Wellesley born in Dublin to the Earl of Mornington, head of a prominent Anglo-Irish family in Dublin; and in the 20th century Field Marshal Lord Alanbrooke, Field Marshal Lord Alexander of Tunis, General Sir John Winthrop Hackett, Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson and Field Marshal Sir Garnet Wolseley. (see also Irish military diaspora).

Others were prominent officials and administrators in the British Empire, such as: Frederick Matthew Darley, the Chief Justice of New South Wales; Henry Arthur Blake, Antony MacDonnell and Gavan Duffy. Others were involved in finding better ways of managing it, heading the Donoughmore Commission or the Moyne Commission.

Sir John Winthrop Hackett emigrated to Australia where he became the proprietor and editor of many prominent newspapers. He was also influential in the founding of the University of Western Australia and was its first chancellor.

Prolific art music composers included Michael William Balfe, John Field, George Alexander Osborne, Thomas Roseingrave, Charles Villiers Stanford, John Andrew Stevenson, Robert Prescott Stewart, William Vincent Wallace, and Charles Wood.

In the visual arts, sculptor John Henry Foley, art dealer Hugh Lane, artists Daniel Maclise, William Orpen and Jack Yeats; ballerina Dame Ninette de Valois and designer-architect Eileen Gray were famous outside Ireland.

William Desmond Taylor was an early and prolific maker of silent films in Hollywood. Scriptwriter Johanna Harwood penned several of the early James Bond films, among others.

Philanthropists included Thomas Barnardo and Lord Iveagh.

Confederate general Patrick Cleburne was of Anglo-Irish ancestry.

Discussing what he considered the lack of Irish civic morality in 2011, former Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald remarked that before 1922: &quot;In Ireland a strong civic sense did exist – but mainly amongst Protestants and especially Anglicans&quot;.

Henry Ford, the American industrialist and business magnate, was half Anglo-Irish; his father William Ford was born in Cork to a family originally from Somerset, England.
==Attitude towards Ireland&#x27;s independence==

The Anglo-Irish, as a class, were mostly opposed to the notions of Irish independence and Home Rule. Most were supporters of continued political union with Great Britain, which existed between 1800 and 1922. This was for many reasons, but most important were the economic benefits of union for the landowning class, the close personal and familial relations with the British establishment, and the political prominence held by the Anglo-Irish in Ireland under the union settlement. Many Anglo-Irish men served as officers in the British Army, were clergymen in the established Anglican Church of Ireland or had land (or business interests) across the British Isles – all factors which encouraged political support for unionism. Between the mid-nineteenth century and 1922, the Anglo-Irish comprised the bulk of the support for movements such as the Irish Unionist Alliance, especially in the southern three provinces of Ireland.

During World War I, Irish nationalist MP Tom Kettle compared the Anglo-Irish landlord class to the Prussian Junkers, saying, &quot;England goes to fight for liberty in Europe and for junkerdom in Ireland.&quot;

However, Protestants in Ireland, and the Anglo-Irish class in particular, were by no means universally attached to the cause of continued political union with Great Britain. For instance, author Jonathan Swift (1667–1745), a clergyman in the Church of Ireland, vigorously denounced the plight of ordinary Irish Catholics under the rule of the landlords. Reformist politicians such as Henry Grattan (1746–1820), Wolfe Tone (1763–1798), Robert Emmet (1778–1803), Sir John Gray (1815–1875), and Charles Stewart Parnell (1846–1891), were also Protestant nationalists, and in large measure led and defined Irish nationalism. The Irish Rebellion of 1798 was led by members of the Anglo-Irish and Ulster Scots class, some of whom feared the political implications of the impending union with Great Britain. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, however, Irish nationalism became increasingly tied to a Roman Catholic identity. By the beginning of the twentieth century, many Anglo-Irishmen in southern Ireland had become convinced of the need for a political settlement with Irish nationalists. Anglo-Irish politicians such as Sir Horace Plunkett and Lord Monteagle became leading figures in finding a peaceful solution to the &#x27;Irish question&#x27;.

During the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921), many Anglo-Irish landlords left the country due to arson attacks on their family homes. The burnings continued and many sectarian murders were carried out by the Anti-Treaty IRA during the Irish Civil War. Considering the Irish State unable to protect them, many members of the Anglo-Irish class subsequently left Ireland forever, fearing that they would be subject to discriminatory legislation and social pressures. The Protestant proportion of the Irish population dropped from 10% (300,000) to 6% (180,000) in the Irish Free State in the twenty-five years following independence, with most resettling in Great Britain. In the whole of Ireland the percentage of Protestants was 26% (1.1 million).

The reaction of the Anglo-Irish to the Anglo-Irish Treaty which envisaged the establishment of the Irish Free State was mixed. J. A. F. Gregg, the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin, stated in a sermon in December 1921 (the month the Treaty was signed):

In 1925, when the Irish Free State was poised to outlaw divorce, the Anglo-Irish poet W. B. Yeats delivered a famous eulogy for his class in the Irish Senate:

== Peerage ==

Following the English victory in the Nine Years&#x27; War (1594–1603), the &quot;Flight of the Earls&quot; in 1607, the traditional Gaelic Irish nobility was displaced in Ireland, particularly in the Cromwellian period. By 1707, after further defeat in the Williamite War and the subsequent Union of England and Scotland, the aristocracy in Ireland was dominated by Anglican families who owed allegiance to the Crown. Some of these were Irish families who had chosen to conform to the established Church of Ireland, keeping their lands and privileges, such as the Dukes of Leinster (whose surname is FitzGerald, and who descend from the Hiberno-Norman aristocracy), or the Gaelic Guinness family. Some were families of British or mixed-British ancestry who owed their status in Ireland to the Crown, such as the Earls of Cork (whose surname is Boyle and whose ancestral roots were in Herefordshire, England).

Among the prominent Anglo-Irish peers are:

*The 1st Earl of Cork, Lord High Treasurer of Ireland, father of scientist Robert Boyle.
*The 1st Baron Glenavy, second-last Lord Chancellor of Ireland and first Cathoirleach (or Chairman) of the Irish Senate (1922).
*The 8th Marquess Conyngham, owner of the Slane Castle rock venue and candidate for Fine Gael in recent Irish general elections.
*The 3rd Earl of Iveagh, of Gaelic Irish descent; head of the Guinness family who sat in the Irish Senate (1973–1977).
*Valerie, Lady Goulding, founder of the Rehabilitation Institute and close associate of former Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Charles Haughey.
*The 6th Earl of Longford, Impresario at the Gate Theatre in Dublin in the 1950s.
*The 7th Earl of Longford (who succeeded his brother (above) in the Earldom), British Labour Cabinet minister, biographer and friend of Éamon de Valera.
*The 3rd Earl of Rosse, astronomer and builder of the then-largest telescope in the world.
*The 18th Baron of Dunsany, author.
*Edmond Roche, 1st Baron Fermoy, Irish peer.
*The 1st Duke of Ormonde, 17th-century statesman, served as Lord Deputy of Ireland on two occasions and commanded Royalist forces in Ireland in the Irish Confederate Wars negotiating with the Irish Confederates on behalf of Charles I.
*Murrough, 1st Earl of Inchiquin, 6th Baron Inchiquin (1618–1674), of Gaelic Irish descent; a Parliamentary commander in the Irish Confederate Wars (1644–1648) before changing sides to become one of the leaders of the Royalist troops in Ireland during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland (1649–53).
*Field Marshal The 1st Duke of Wellington, Anglo-Irish general who fought many successful campaigns and defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo. He later became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

Until the year 1800, the peers of Ireland were all entitled to a seat in the Irish House of Lords, the upper house of the Parliament of Ireland, in Dublin. After 1800, under the provisions of the Act of Union, the Parliament of Ireland was abolished and the Irish peers were entitled to elect twenty-eight of their number to sit in the British House of Lords, in London, as Irish representative peers. During the Georgian Era, titles in the peerage of Ireland were often granted by the British monarch to Englishmen with little or no connection to Ireland, as a way of preventing such honours from inflating the membership of the British House of Lords.

A number of Anglo-Irish peers have been appointed by Presidents of Ireland to serve on their advisory Council of State. Some were also considered possible candidates for presidents of Ireland, including:

*Valerie, Lady Goulding
*Lord Killanin (though an Irish Catholic, rather than Anglo-Irish despite his peerage)
*Lord Ashbourne (a renowned Gaelic scholar).

<doc id="159811" wikidata="Q1754293" url="?curid=159811" title="Upholder/Victoria-class submarine">
<text>The &quot;Upholder&quot;/&quot;Victoria&quot;-class submarines, also known as the Type 2400 (due to their displacement of 2,400 tonnes), are a class of diesel-electric submarines built in the United Kingdom in the 1980s to supplement the nuclear submarines in the Submarine Service of the British Royal Navy.

The boats were originally named the &quot;Upholder&quot; class, after the most renowned vessel of the former U class. Their British service life was short, with the vessels being decommissioned in 1994. After an unsuccessful bid to transfer these submarines to the Pakistan Navy in 1993–1994, the Canadian government eventually purchased the submarines and a suite of trainers from the Royal Navy for Canadian Forces Maritime Command (renamed to Royal Canadian Navy in 2011) to replace their decommissioned s in 1998.

In Canadian service, the submarines are classified as the &quot;Victoria&quot; class. These submarines initially suffered from serious electrical problems and were beset by mechanical operational incidents that limited their active service and the scope of their deployments. These problems have largely been overcome and the subs have achieved full operational capability.

==Design and development==

In the late 1970s the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence (MoD) proposed a diesel-electric submarine design to replace the &quot;Oberon&quot; class. The new submarine class was intended to provide a more cost-effective alternative for training and in coastal defence. The announcement for the new design took place in September 1979. Five designs were put forward, with the MoD selecting the 1,960-ton design. However, the need for export potential upped the displacement limit to 2,400 tons to allow for flexibility in construction if the need for alternative machinery and systems arose.

The Vickers Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Ltd. (VSEL) Type 2400 diesel-electric patrol submarine design was selected. The design displaces between 2,168 and 2,220 tons surfaced and 2,400–2,455 tons submerged. The submarines are long overall with a beam of and a draught of . The submarines had a complement between 44 and 47 with the Royal Navy.

The submarines have a single-skinned, teardrop-shaped hull constructed from NQ1 high tensile steel. The hull is fitted with elastomeric acoustic tiles to reduce the submarine&#x27;s acoustic signature. The class has a reported dive depth of over .

===Machinery===
The submarines are powered by a single-shaft diesel-electric system. They are equipped with two Paxman Valenta 1600 RPS SZ diesel engines, each driving a GEC electric alternator. There are two 120-cell Chloride batteries. The batteries have a 90-hour endurance at . The submarine is propelled by a GEC dual armature electric motor turning a seven-blade fixed pitch propeller. This gives the vessels a maximum speed of on the surface and submerged. They have a diesel fuel capacity of 200 tons, giving a range of at and at snorting depth.

===Armament===
The class is equipped with six torpedo tubes in the bow. In British service, the submarines were supplied with up to 18 Marconi Mk 24 Tigerfish Mod 2 torpedoes; they were also capable of using UGM-84 Sub-Harpoon missiles. They could also be adapted for use as a minelayer. The DCC Action Information Organisation and Fire Control System (AIS/FC), developed from the DCA/DCB systems in service at that time aboard Royal Navy nuclear-powered submarines, was based on two Ferranti FM1600E computers with a digital data bus linked to three dual-purpose consoles. Up to 35 targets could be tracked, and automatic guidance could be provided for four torpedoes against four separate targets.

During the refit for Canadian service, the Sub-Harpoon and mine capabilities were removed and the submarines were equipped with the Lockheed Martin Librascope Submarine fire-control system (SFCS) to meet the operational requirements of the Canadian Navy. Components from the fire control system of the &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarines were installed. This gave the submarines the ability to fire the Gould Mk 48 Mod 4 torpedo. This torpedo, operating at , is deployed against targets over a range of . The torpedo range is at speeds up to . The type uses active and passive homing to approach the designated target. In 2014, the Government of Canada purchased 12 upgrade kits that will allow the submarines to fire the Mk 48 Mod 7AT torpedo.

===Sensors and countermeasures===
As built, the &quot;Upholder&quot; class was equipped with the Kelvin Hughes Type 1007 I-band radar for navigational purposes. The submarines were fitted with the Type 2040 Thompson Sintra ARGONAUTE hull mounted sonar, installed in the bow and Type 2026 GEC Avionics passive towed array. The submarines had the Type 2019 Thompson Sintra PARIS passive sonar for active and intercept purposes. They also had the Type 2041 passive ranging sonar and the Type 2004 expendable bathythermograph. The class was fitted with Type 2008 underwater telephone. The Type 2040 sonar was intended to be upgraded to Type 2075; however, that upgrade was cancelled in 1991.

These systems were later upgraded with the installation of the BAE Type 2007 array and the Type 2046 towed array. The Canadian Towed Array Sonar (CANTASS) has been integrated into the towed sonar suite.

The &quot;Upholder&quot;-class submarines were equipped with the CK035 electro-optical search periscope and the CH085 optronic attack periscope, originally supplied by Pilkington Optronics. After the Canadian refit, the submarines were equipped with Canadian communication equipment and electronic support measures (ESM). This included two SSE decoy launchers and the AR 900 ESM.

==Construction and Royal Navy service==
The plan initially called for twelve submarines to be built. However, formal approval was given in 1981 for the construction of only nine. The nine submarines were to be constructed in three stages, with Stage 1 being the construction of the prototype submarine, Stage 2 being the construction of three more follow-ons, and Stage 3 being the construction of five vessels with updated systems.

The MoD placed the order with VSEL for the Stage 1 submarine on 2 November 1983. &quot;Upholder&quot;″s keel was laid down at the VSEL shipyard at Barrow-in-Furness that month and the submarine was launched on 2 December 1986. The order for Stage 2 was placed on 2 January 1986 with the contract for the next three vessels going to Cammell Laird, a subsidiary of VSEL. The cost announced for the program was £620 million plus long-lead items.

The second submarine, &quot;Unseen&quot;, was laid down at the Cammell Laird shipyard at Birkenhead on 12 August 1987 and launched on 14 November 1989. &quot;Ursula&quot; was laid down on 25 August 1987 and launched on 22 February 1991 and &quot;Unicorn&quot; was laid down on 13 March 1989 and launched on 16 April 1992.

&quot;Upholder&quot; was completed on 9 June 1990, followed by &quot;Unseen&quot; on 20 July 1991, &quot;Ursula&quot; on 8 May 1992 and &quot;Unicorn&quot; on 25 June 1993. Initially they were unable to fire torpedoes and the first three were refitted in 1992 and 1993 to have this fixed at a cost of £9 million. They were operating from (at Gosport), but with only four submarines the base was deemed uneconomic and they transferred to Devonport Naval Base. In their short period of service, the class operated mostly in the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean and UK waters. The exception was &quot;Unicorn&quot;, which completed a 6-month deployment east of Suez, completing operations and exercises in the Mediterranean, the Gulf of Oman and Indian Ocean and in the Persian Gulf.

In 1992, the Defence Review announced the decision by the MoD to direct all further submarine expenditure to nuclear-powered submarines. In 1994, the Royal Navy abandoned the Type 2400 program after the first four submarines and Stage 3 was never ordered. The &quot;Upholder&quot; class were declared surplus in 1994 and laid up. &quot;Unseen&quot; was paid off on 6 April 1994, followed by &quot;Upholder&quot; on 29 April and &quot;Ursula&quot; on 16 June. These three submarines were laid up in June 1994. &quot;Unicorn&quot; was paid off on 16 October 1994 and laid up.

==Search for a buyer==
===Failed sale to Pakistan===

In 1992, the United Kingdom learned that Pakistan had been in negotiations with France over the acquisition of submarines. The Sharif administration gave permission to the Pakistan Navy to acquire either diesel-electric powered or air-independent powered submarines. The Pakistan Navy&#x27;s research team, comprising three admirals, visited Sweden, China, France, and the United Kingdom. Original plans were to acquire the submarines from Sweden but later the acquisition of either the British &quot;Upholder&quot;s or the French was recommended. During this time, Admiral Saeed Khan, the Chief of Naval Staff (CNS), had strongly suggested &quot;Upholder&quot; class vessels, but the Bhutto administration chose French technology for several political and technical reasons.

===Sale to Canada===
Following the cancellation of the Canadian nuclear-powered submarine program, the Canadian navy sought to acquire conventionally-powered submarines again. The Canadian National Defence White Paper of 1994 stated the intent to explore the purchase of the &quot;Upholder&quot; class from the UK. The choice faced opposition and the price of $1 billion that the MoD demanded stalled the decision by the Cabinet of Canada to go ahead with the purchase. In the meantime, the subs were offered to Portugal and Chile. In 1996, another attempt to purchase the subs by Canada was stopped soon after starting. In the meantime, the UK spent millions maintaining the submarines.

In April 1998, the Canadian government announced the potential acquisition of the &quot;Upholder&quot; class. The published cost was $750 million divided into two parts. $610 million was to be paid for the subs themselves and the remaining $140 million would cover related expenses.

On 3 July 1998, the deal was ratified and two contracts were signed simultaneously. The first was an eight-year interest-free lease-to-purchase agreement for the four submarines, five training simulators and assorted training and data packages. The lease payments were part of a barter agreement for the continued access by the UK to Canadian Forces bases Wainwright, Suffield, and Goose Bay. The second contract was with VSEL for the refits required for the reactivation of the laid-up submarines. This included modifications for Canadian service, new batteries, a training program and all spare parts.

Although the Canadian government touted the $750 million CAD procurement as a bargain, there have been arguments over the quality of the submarines with some suggestions that the purchase price will be at least spent again putting things right. Some Canadian opposition parties demanded that the British government fund any further costs, since it is widely believed that the submarines deteriorated while in storage and the Royal Navy was not completely forthcoming on their condition during the sale. However, Stephen Saunders, editor of &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot;, argued that &quot;there is not something inherently wrong with the class of submarines.&quot;

In 2008, Babcock Canada was awarded the contract to support the &quot;Victoria&quot; class in Canadian service in the period up to 2023. The potential value of the contract was over CAD $3.6 billion and required establishing a supply chain in Canada to support and sustain the submarines. Every six to nine years each &quot;Victoria&quot;-class boat undergoes an extended docking work period (EDWP) involving comprehensive maintenance, repair, overhaul or upgrading of over 200 systems including sonar upgrades, mast upgrades and combat system upgrades.

====Trainers====
&quot;Victoria&quot;-class submarines use eight Submarine Command Team Trainers built for the Royal Navy. These were moved from the UK to Canada by CAE, Computing Devices Canada, General Dynamics Canada and Irving Shipbuilding. These devices are land-based systems using simulators and other training devices. &quot;Victoria&quot;-class submarines also use a Canadian Submarine Escape Trainer, attached to a real submarine escape hatch to simulate escape procedures.

==Canadian service==
Upon acquiring the subs, Maritime Command suggested that the subs would be operational by 2000. This included an 18-month systems check. Each sub would undergo a six-month Canadian Work Period (CWP). During the CWP, Canadian communications and fire control systems were installed. On 6 October, &quot;Unseen&quot; was accepted by Canada at Barrow-in-Furness and renamed &quot;Victoria&quot;. The submarine arrived in Canada on 23 October 2000 and was commissioned into Maritime Command on 2 December. She then underwent her CWP.

&quot;Unicorn&quot; was accepted by Canada and renamed &quot;Windsor&quot; on 5 July 2001. The sub sailed from Faslane on 8 October, arriving at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 19 October 2001. During her sea trials, &quot;Windsor&quot; suffered minor flooding while submerged, forcing her early entry into the CWP. &quot;Ursula&quot; was accepted by Canada and renamed &quot;Corner Brook&quot; on 21 February 2003. She departed Faslane on 25 February and arrived at Halifax on 10 March. &quot;Corner Brook&quot; was commissioned at her namesake city on 29 June 2003. On 29 June 2003, following the completion of her CWP, &quot;Victoria&quot; transferred to the west coast, arriving at Esquimalt, British Columbia on 24 August. &quot;Windsor&quot; was commissioned into Maritime Command during her CWP on 4 October 2003.

The crew of , the last Canadian &quot;Oberon&quot;, transferred to &quot;Upholder&quot;, the last of the class to transfer in July 2000. The sub was accepted by Canada on 2 October 2004 at Faslane and renamed &quot;Chicoutimi&quot;.

===&quot;Chicoutimi&quot; fire===
&quot;Chicoutimi&quot; cleared Faslane on 4 October 2004 on her homeward journey to Canada. Since Faslane was a nuclear submarine base, &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; was forced to travel on the surface for the first stage of the passage. On 5 October &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; was passing through a gale with seas. During a watch change at 03:00 sea water entered the conning tower. The lower hatch prevented the water from entering the sub; however, the drain in the tower failed to operate. When the lower hatch was opened, the water fell into the sub and was then pumped overboard with the incident noted. The drain valves required much repair before diving. At 10:52 two crew entered the tower to perform the needed repairs. The upper hatch was opened during the repair and after roughly 25 minutes, another tool was needed from within the sub. Once the lower hatch was opened, the submarine was hit by a large wave thereby throwing roughly of sea water into &quot;Chicoutimi&quot;. Electrical explosions and fire erupted soon afterward which spread quickly. In order to fight the fire, all systems aboard the submarine were shut down, leaving the submarine dead in the water. An attempt to restore auxiliary power caused another fire to break out. At 19:12, attempts to remove smoke by starting an oxygen generator caused another fire. Nine sailors were injured, three seriously.

The first ship on the scene was the Irish patrol vessel , which suffered damage in the heavy seas and was forced to return to port. The British frigate arrived the following day to provide aid. Rescue efforts had been hampered by the poor weather. The three seriously injured crewmen were evacuated by &quot;Montrose&quot;″s helicopter and flown directly to Sligo, Ireland. One sailor died of his injuries shortly after arrival. &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; was taken in tow on 7 October and arrived back at Faslane on 9 October.

&quot;Chicoutimi&quot; was transported to Halifax aboard the submersible heavy-lift vessel &quot;Eide Transporter&quot;, arriving on 1 February 2005. The commissioning of the submarine was delayed until the assessment of the damage could take place. Following the assessment, &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; was carried to Esquimalt aboard the submersible heavy-lift ship &quot;Tern&quot;, arriving on 29 April 2009 to undergo a major refit.

===Service entry===
&quot;Windsor&quot; became the first active member of the class in Canadian service in June 2005. In the following year and a half, the submarine took part in several international naval exercises and training periods with other Canadian units. &quot;Victoria&quot; performed several sea trials and training exercises before beginning a major refit, called the Extended Docking Work Period (EDWP), on 27 June 2005. &quot;Corner Brook&quot; entered her CWP from 2004 to 2005 and began sea trials on 24 October 2006.
On 15 January 2007, &quot;Windsor&quot; began the EDWP refit at Halifax. In 2007 &quot;Corner Brook&quot; participated in the NATO naval exercise &quot;Joint Warrior&quot;, marking the first time in fifteen years that a Canadian submarine had sailed in European waters. In August 2007, &quot;Corner Brook&quot; participated in Operation Nanook, Canada&#x27;s naval exercise in the Arctic.

In March 2008, &quot;Corner Brook&quot; deployed as part of Operation Caribbe in the Caribbean Sea. In August 2009 &quot;Corner Brook&quot; again deployed to the Arctic as part of Operation Nanook.

On 30 January 2011 &quot;Corner Brook&quot; left Halifax to transfer to the west coast. On the way, the submarine participated in Operation Caribbe. She arrived at Esquimalt on 5 May 2011. On 4 June 2011, &quot;Corner Brook&quot; while diving off the coast of British Columbia slammed into the seafloor at at a depth of . Two sailors were injured in the collision and the submarine suffered significant damage, with a hole in the bow. Two torpedo tube doors were torn off in the collision. The submarine surfaced and made port without requiring aid. The commander of the submarine was later stripped of his command following a board of inquiry. Repairs and a major refit kept the sub out of operational service until 2018. &quot;Victoria&quot; emerged from the EDWP at the end of 2011.

&quot;Victoria&quot; was declared fully operational in March 2012 and participated in the RIMPAC naval exercise that year, sinking ex- with one of her torpedoes. &quot;Windsor&quot; finished her refit on 30 November 2012. &quot;Victoria&quot; participated in Operation Caribbe in 2013. &quot;Windsor&quot; reentered the dockyard in March 2014 requiring the replacement of a defective diesel generator.

&quot;Windsor&quot; performed a 105-day training cruise in 2015, making it the longest deployment by a &quot;Victoria&quot;-class submarine. The submarine participated in training exercises with NATO and several navies in the North Atlantic. During the cruise, &quot;Windsor&quot; was deployed to track five submarines from another nation that had entered the North Atlantic. Canada announced plans for a major life extension for the class on 7 April 2015, possibly to start in 2020. The estimated cost for the program would be between $1.5 and $2 billion CAN.

On 3 September 2015, &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy at Esquimalt. However, the sub was restricted to shallow-water diving. In October 2015, &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; was among the Canadian vessels sent to participate in a joint exercise with the United States Navy. &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; and &quot;Victoria&quot; were taken out of active service in 2016 after hundreds of welds were found to not meet quality standards, affecting the ability of the subs to dive. They were docked at Esquimalt for several months. &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; was repaired first, followed by &quot;Victoria&quot;. &quot;Victoria&quot; was used for training purposes until repairs were effected. In September 2017, Canada deployed &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; on patrol in Asian waters, the first such deployment by a &quot;Victoria&quot;-class submarine. During the deployment, &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; marked the first visit to Japan by a Canadian submarine since 1968. The vessel returned to Canada on 21 March 2018 spending 197 days at sea, the longest deployment by a &quot;Victoria&quot;-class submarine in Canadian service.

===Life extension and replacement===
Under the Justin Trudeau government&#x27;s defence policy paper, &quot;Strong Secure Engaged&quot; (2017), the operational life of each &quot;Victoria&quot;-class boat was to be extended by one additional &quot;life-cycle&quot; (or by about eight years). This was designed to permit the operation of the fleet into about the early to mid-2030s. As of 2020 no decision had been taken on the actual replacement of Canada&#x27;s submarines which were then already thirty years old. Analysis by the Naval Association of Canada indicated that the lead times, technical challenges and costs involved in submarine replacement would be significant were such a program to be initiated.

According to John Ivison, Canadian navy personnel assessed six submarines that could be a potential replacement. They consist of the conventional , the Type 212CD, the , the KSS-III class, the &quot;Isaac Peral&quot; class and the . On 10 July 2024, the Government of Canada announced the Canadian Patrol Submarine Project (CPSP). Up to 12 conventionally powered submarines are to be acquired for the RCN. An RFI was issued by Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) in September 2024. On 21 November, it was reported that the &quot;Taigei&quot; class was no longer being considered.

David Pugliese in the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; reported that former navy officers estimated the program costs would be around $100 billion with the first new submarines estimated to be ready by 2037.

<doc id="159822" wikidata="Q1440597" url="?curid=159822" title="Party discipline">
<text>The term party discipline is used in politics in two closely related, yet distinct, meanings. In a broad sense (also known as party cohesion), the discipline is adherence of the party members at large to an agreed system of political norms and rules. In a narrow sense, most pronounced under the Westminster model, the party discipline is an obligation of the members of parliament to vote along their party&#x27;s line, with few exceptions. The deviations might be countered by consequences (&quot;whipping&quot;) that are designed to ensure the relative cohesion of members of the respective party group.

==Typology==
In order to maintain party discipline, given political parties usually appoint a party whip whose primary task it is to maintain party discipline and to ensure the given party members support the party on the floor of the legislature. In liberal democracies, party discipline commonly refers to the control that party leaders have over their caucus members in the legislature. Party discipline is important for all systems of government that allow parties to hold political power, as it can often be a determining factor in both the practical functionality of the government, as well as the efficient function of legitimate political process. Parliamentary groups can have discipline analogous to party discipline.

Breaking party discipline in both formal and informal settings may result in a number of consequences. Punishment for members who break party discipline largely varies on a case-to-case basis, but members may find themselves in a variety of positions from being internally demoted in the party to being expelled from the party itself. This results in there often being immense pressure for parliamentarians to compromise their beliefs if they conflict with the policy or decision that has been made by the parties leadership.

In order to maintain strict discipline and discourage behaviour such as floor crossing, which entails the given member leaving the party to join another caucus in the legislature, parties often offer a number of incentives to loyal members. These incentives also greatly vary on a case-to-case basis; examples include financial incentives and internal promotion within the party. There are, however, occasions in which members of a party are granted a conscience vote or free vote, in which party discipline is waived, and given members are free to vote to their individual preference.

This shared ideology is an essential and important part of party cohesion, and reinforcing the given shared ideology through methods such as party discipline is crucial to the ruling party&#x27;s survival in government.

==Strong party discipline==
Party discipline tends to vary largely depending on the type of governmental system of a given country.

===In Marxism-Leninism===
In Marxist–Leninist political systems democratic centralism refers to strong party discipline with actual sanctions such as fines or expulsion from the Communist Party imposed on its members for disagreeing with the party.

Other examples of even stronger party discipline include the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International and the French Communist Party which demand near absolute conformity to maintain party membership and good standing.

===Other===
Party discipline tends to be increasingly strong in countries that employ the Westminster parliamentary system, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand. The Australian Labor Party, for example, requires absolute solidarity with caucus decisions. Apart from extremely rare examples of a conscience vote, voting against the decision of the caucus will result in expulsion from the party entirely if internal discussions fail to dissuade the member from crossing the floor. Even in parties with no such requirement like the conservative Liberal Party of Australia, discipline remains strong and defections against the party are very rare.

In India, party discipline in regards to voting is strong enough that a vote by the legislature against the government is understood, by convention, to cause the government to &quot;collapse&quot;. Party leaders in such governments also often have the authority to expel members of the party who violate the party line.

Within the United Kingdom, the devolved Scottish Parliament uses the mixed member proportionality system of voting and so party discipline tends to be high. That is especially true for list MPs, who do not represent an electorate; (as if they do not vote along the party line) they risk staunch discipline. However research does show that proportional voting systems do result in constituent representatives engaging more with their respective ridings while regional (list) MP&#x27;s often spend more time legislating.

==Weaker party discipline==
Weak party discipline is usually more frequent in parties of notables and elite parties than in populist parties. The centrist Radical-Socialist Party and the right-wing parties during the French Third Republic (1871–1940) all had little to no party discipline.

In the United States, the modern Democratic Party and Republican Party both have relatively weaker party discipline in contrast to Westminsters system. That is aptly illustrated by the vote on the federal Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, in which the only senator to vote against overriding President Barack Obama&#x27;s veto was the retiring Democratic minority leader Harry Reid. This can also be seen in Republican failures to repeal Obamacare and the general power wielded by senators with a pivotal vote, such as Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema during the 117th Congress. This looser degree of party discipline in the United States is part due to the structure of the federal presidential republic government which by design enables elected representatives to exercise an increased degree of autonomy as opposed to the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy.

Party discipline weakened to a degree in the United Kingdom during Brexit under Theresa May with only a slim majority and intra-party divisions between hard Brexiteers and soft or anti Brexiters; and post 2019 under Boris Johnson (though Johnson has a large majority, making backbench dissent less of a difficulty). An independent evaluation found that MPs in the Canadian House of Commons voted the party line 99.6 percent of the time between 2015 and 2019. Canadian MP&#x27;s also face intense pressure to toe the line when making public remarks inside and outside the legislature.

In Italy, party discipline or group discipline as its referred to is required by the statutes of parliamentary groups. This group discipline has registered an oscillation from &quot;strong&quot; to &quot;weak&quot; over the years, defined as a pendulum, depending on the political phase of the government.

In Australia the electoral conditions can result in candidates from one of the minor parties or a microparty, elected to government with extremely small vote numbers. Discipline in these small parties is often non-existent and results in the elected member leaving to sit as an independent. An example of this is Jacqui Lambie, who won election to the federal senate in 2013 with the Palmer United Party, then quit to start a microparty under her own name only four months later, winning another term after a double dissolution. Following an eligibility issue she was forced to resign in late 2017 due to her British citizenship. Australian law requires the replacement to be from the same party and so she was replaced by Steven Martin. Martin then refused to resign himself, which would have allowed Lambie to return. He was expelled from the Lambie party, sitting as an independent before joining the Tasmanian Nationals.

== Increasing levels of party discipline and party cohesion in the 21st century ==
Party discipline has become increasingly important in the Twenty-First Century due in part to the rise of instant communication. The rise of digital media combined with global hyper-political polarization has caused parties to maintain not only strict party discipline but even stricter message discipline; which has become increasingly important in order to present a strong sense of cohesion. Strict party discipline allows political parties to maintain control over the entire respective party caucus and ensure that the party&#x27;s agenda is placed above all else.

=== The brand ambassador phenomenon ===
Increasing levels of party discipline in liberal democracy have often seen the majority of low-ranking elected party members become simple brand ambassadors whose overarching duty is to represent the values of the larger party. While the brand ambassador phenomenon does work to ensure the smooth operation of democracy, it also has several criticism, such as the oppression of dissenting opinions. This oppression of dissenting opinions sees the creation of a virtual barrier for free thinkers. Perspective party members who may vary from political norms in terms of sex, race or gender identity are thus placed at odds with party officials who may view this deviation from the norm as a threat to party cohesion.

This proverbial prohibition of those who deviate from the norm in establishment politics includes its tendency to suppress the representation of women and minority members of the party. Research from a variety of global legislatures has indicated that parties tend to only select women and minorities who are extremely partisan loyal. Parties also often systemically weed out members they deem to be a threat to party conformity. Examples of this behaviour include the expulsion of former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould from the Liberal Party of Canada in response to her pursuit of criminal proceedings in the SNC Lavalin scandal. 

Parties often view minority candidates as simple brand ambassadors that check social diversity quotas which has been shown to impair these members from ever doing anything substantive. This, in turn, negatively correlates with the prioritization of women and other minority rights. This negative correlation can be seen to drastic effect in the practice of sacrificial lambs in electoral politics.

== Party discipline by country ==
===Canada===
Canadian parliaments have seen an especially drastic rise in party discipline over the past 100 years. In the early 1900s, just 20 percent of elected MPs voted with their respective party 100 percent of the time. The past ten years, however, has seen MPs vote against their party less than 1 percent of the time. This mass conformity has had a drastic effect on Canadian elections, with just 4 to 5 percent of Canadians listing the actual candidate as prioritization in elections. Furthermore, statistics show that voter opinions of local candidates matter in less than 15 percent of elections. Thus Canada has become widely regarded as the parliamentary democracy with the most stringent party discipline. This, in turn, has led to frustration among many Canadian voters who feel their elected representative is no more than a simple brand ambassador.

==== Concerns over presidentialization of parliamentary systems ====
This stringent discipline in the Canadian system has, in turn, played a part in what is deemed the presidentialization of the Westminster parliamentary system. The Canadian system has come to possess many characteristics of presidential systems without any of the formal attributes. The position of the Canadian prime minister has seen an increasing level of power which has resulted in the position becoming arguably more powerful than some actual presidential systems.

==== Party discipline in the reformed Canadian Senate ====
The 2015 reforms to Canadian senate sought to increase independence, ideological diversity, and encouraging the exercising of formal powers, by eliminating political parties in the senate. While party discipline has been somewhat loosened, it has not really been effectively loosened as appointees are still likely to follow respective party policy and rhetoric. While senators are now officially unaffiliated with political parties research has shown that they still to tend to largely vote along the same ideological party lines as before. While more time is needed to study the implemented reforms&#x27; effects, initial data shows that the reforms have been largely ineffective and have actually negatively impacted regional representation.

<text>New France (, ) was the territory colonized by France in North America, beginning with the exploration of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence by Jacques Cartier in 1534 and ending with the cession of New France to Great Britain and Spain in 1763 under the Treaty of Paris.

A vast viceroyalty, New France consisted of five colonies at its peak in 1712, each with its own administration: Canada, the most developed colony, which was divided into the districts of Quebec (around what is now called Quebec City), Trois-Rivières, and Montreal; Hudson Bay; Acadia in the northeast; Terre-Neuve on the island of Newfoundland; and Louisiana. It extended from Newfoundland to the Canadian Prairies and from Hudson Bay to the Gulf of Mexico, including all the Great Lakes of North America. The continent-traversing Saint Lawrence and Mississippi rivers were means of carrying French influence through much of North America.

In the 16th century, the lands were used primarily to extract natural resources, such as furs, through trade with the various indigenous peoples. In the seventeenth century, successful settlements began in Acadia and in Quebec. In the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, France ceded to Great Britain its claims over mainland Acadia, Hudson Bay, and Newfoundland. France established the colony of Île Royale on Cape Breton Island, where they built the Fortress of Louisbourg.

The population rose slowly but steadily. In 1754, New France&#x27;s population consisted of 10,000 Acadians, 55,000 &quot;Canadiens&quot;, and about 4,000 settlers in upper and lower Louisiana; 69,000 in total. The British expelled the Acadians in the Great Upheaval from 1755 to 1764, and their descendants are dispersed in the Maritime provinces of Canada and in Maine and Louisiana, with small populations in Chéticamp, Nova Scotia, and the Magdalen Islands. Some also went to France.

After the Seven Years&#x27; War (which included the French and Indian War in America), France ceded the rest of New France to Great Britain and Spain in the Treaty of Paris of 1763 (except the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon). Britain acquired Canada, Acadia, and French Louisiana east of the Mississippi River, except for the Île d&#x27;Orléans, which was granted to Spain with the territory to the west. In 1800, Spain returned its portion of Louisiana to France under the secret Treaty of San Ildefonso, and Napoleon Bonaparte sold it to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, permanently ending French colonial efforts on the American mainland.

New France eventually became absorbed within the United States and Canada, with the only vestige of French rule being the tiny islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, an overseas collectivity of France, although Quebec remains predominantly French-speaking. In the United States, the legacy of New France includes numerous place names as well as small pockets of French-speaking communities.
==Settlements of New France==

* Acadia (1604–1713) — (areas, Port Royal, Île Saint-Jean, Île-Royale, New Brunswick and Maine)
* Canada (1608–1763) —(districts, Québec, Trois-Rivières and Montreal; areas, Pays d&#x27;en Haut and Domaine du roy)
*Hudson Bay —(Hudson Bay conflicts 17th and 18th centuries)
* Terre-Neuve (1662–1713)
* Louisiana (1682–1763, 1801–1803) —(district, Illinois Country; area, Ohio Country)

The 1715 Treaty of Utrecht resulted in the relinquishing of French claims to mainland Acadia, the Hudson Bay and Newfoundland, and the establishment of the colony of Île Royale, now called Cape Breton Island, where the French built the Fortress of Louisbourg.

===Growth of the settlements===

The European population grew slowly under French rule, thus remained relatively low as growth was largely achieved through natural births, rather than by immigration. Most of the French were farmers, and the rate of natural increase among the settlers themselves was very high. The women had about 30 per cent more children than their counterparts who remained in France. Yves Landry says, &quot;Canadians had an exceptional diet for their time.&quot; The 1666 census of New France was the first census conducted in North America. It was organized by Jean Talon, the first Intendant of New France, between 1665 and 1666. According to Talon&#x27;s census there were 3,215 people in New France, comprising 538 separate families. The census showed a great difference in the number of men at 2,034 versus 1,181 women. The French government sought to rectify this over the next few years by sending approximately 800 unmarried women, known as the &quot;Filles du Roi&quot; (&quot;King&#x27;s Daughters&quot;), to the colony.

By the early 1700s, the New France settlers were well established along the Saint Lawrence River and Acadian Peninsula with a population around 15,000-16,000. The first population figures for Acadia are from 1671, which enumerated only 450 people.

After the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, New France began to prosper. Industries such as fishing and farming, which had failed under Talon, began to flourish. A &quot;King&#x27;s Highway&quot; (&quot;Chemin du Roy&quot;) was built between Montreal and Quebec to encourage faster trade. The shipping industry also flourished as new ports were built and old ones were upgraded. The number of colonists greatly increased. By 1720, Canada had become a self-sufficient colony with a population of 24,594. 
Mainly due to natural increase and modest immigration from Northwest France (Brittany, Normandy, Île-de-France, Poitou-Charentes and Pays de la Loire) the population of Canada increased to 55,000 according to the last French census of 1754. This was an increase from 42,701 in 1730. By 1765, the population approached 70,000.

By 1714, the Acadian population had expanded to over 2,500, and by the end of the 1750s it had reached about 13,000. This was mostly from natural increase rather than immigration that affected other French settlements.

The European population of Louisiana is estimated at 5,000 by the 1720s. However, by the mid-1730s the colony had suffered the loss of 2,000 French settlers, though it added African slaves. Enslaved men, women and children represented approximately 65 percent of the 6,000 non-indigenous population of Louisiana by the end of French rule.

==History==
===Early exploration (1523–1650s)===
Around 1523, the Florentine navigator Giovanni da Verrazzano convinced King Francis I to commission an expedition to find a western route to Cathay (China). Late that year, Verrazzano set sail in Dieppe, crossing the Atlantic on a small caravel with 50 men. After exploring the coast of the present-day Carolinas early the following year, he headed north along the coast, eventually anchoring in the Narrows of New York Bay.

The first European to visit the site of present-day New York, Verrazzano named it Nouvelle-Angoulême in honour of the king, the former count of Angoulême. Verrazzano&#x27;s voyage convinced the king to seek to establish a colony in the newly discovered land. Verrazzano gave the names &quot;Francesca&quot; and &quot;Nova Gallia&quot; to that land between New Spain (Mexico) and English Newfoundland.

In 1534, Jacques Cartier planted a cross in the Gaspé Peninsula and claimed the land in the name of King Francis I. It was the first province of New France. The first settlement of 400 people, Fort Charlesbourg-Royal (present-day Quebec City), was attempted in 1541 but lasted only two years.

French fishing fleets continued to sail to the Atlantic coast and into the St. Lawrence River, making alliances with Canadian First Nations that became important once France began to occupy the land. French merchants soon realized the St. Lawrence region was full of valuable fur-bearing animals, especially the beaver, which were becoming rare in Europe. Eventually, the French crown decided to colonize the territory to secure and expand its influence in America.

Acadia and Canada (New France) were inhabited by indigenous nomadic Algonquian peoples and sedentary Iroquoian peoples. These lands were full of unexploited and valuable natural resources, which attracted all of Europe. By the 1580s, French trading companies had been set up, and ships were contracted to bring back furs. Much of what transpired between the indigenous population and their European visitors around that time is not known, for lack of historical records.

Other attempts at establishing permanent settlements were also failures. In 1598, a French trading post was established on Sable Island, off the coast of Acadia, but was unsuccessful. In 1600, a trading post was established at Tadoussac, but only five settlers survived the winter.

In 1604, a settlement was founded at Île-Saint-Croix on Baie François (Bay of Fundy), which was moved to Port-Royal in 1605. It was abandoned in 1607, re-established in 1610, and destroyed in 1613, after which settlers moved to other nearby locations, creating settlements that were collectively known as Acadia, and the settlers as Acadians.

====Foundation of Quebec City (1608)====

In 1608, King Henry IV sponsored Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons and Samuel de Champlain as founders of the city of Quebec with 28 men. This was the second permanent French settlement in the colony of Canada. Colonization was slow and difficult. Many settlers died early because of harsh weather and diseases. In 1630, there were only 103 colonists living in the settlement, but by 1640, the population had reached 355.

Champlain allied himself with the Algonquin and Montagnais peoples in the area, who were at war with the Iroquois, as soon as possible. In 1609, Champlain and two French companions accompanied his Algonquin, Montagnais, and Huron allies south from the St. Lawrence Valley to Lake Champlain. He participated decisively in a battle against the Iroquois there, killing two Iroquois chiefs with the first shot of his arquebus. This military engagement against the Iroquois solidified Champlain&#x27;s status with New France&#x27;s Huron and Algonquin allies, enabling him to maintain bonds essential to New France&#x27;s interests in the fur trade.
Champlain also arranged to have young French men live with local indigenous people, to learn their language and customs and help the French adapt to life in North America. These &quot;coureurs des bois&quot; (&quot;runners of the woods&quot;), including Étienne Brûlé, extended French influence south and west to the Great Lakes and among the Huron tribes who lived there. Ultimately, for the better part of a century, the Iroquois and French clashed in a series of attacks and reprisals.

During the first decades of the colony&#x27;s existence, only a few hundred French people lived there, while the English colonies to the south were much more populous and wealthy. Cardinal Richelieu, adviser to Louis XIII, wished to make New France as significant as the English colonies. In 1627, Richelieu founded the Company of One Hundred Associates to invest in New France, promising land parcels to hundreds of new settlers and to turn Canada into an important mercantile and farming colony. He named Champlain as the Governor of New France and forbade non-Catholics to live there. Consequently, any Protestant emigrants to New France were forced to convert to Catholicism, prompting many of them to relocate to the English colonies instead.

The Catholic Church, and missionaries such as the Recollets and the Jesuits, became firmly established in the territory. Richelieu also introduced the seigneurial system, a semi-feudal system of farming based on ribbon farms that remained a characteristic feature of the St. Lawrence valley until the 19th century. While Richelieu&#x27;s efforts did little to increase the French presence in New France, they did pave the way for the success of later efforts.

Simultaneously, the English colonies to the south began raiding the St. Lawrence Valley, also capturing and holding Quebec until 1632. Champlain returned to Canada that year and requested that Sieur de Laviolette found another trading post at Trois-Rivières, which Laviolette did in 1634. Champlain died in 1635.

On 23 September 1646, under the command of Pierre LeGardeur, Le Cardinal arrived to Quebec with Jules (Gilles) Trottier II and his family. Le Cardinal, commissioned by the Communauté des Habitants, had arrived from La Rochelle, France. Communauté des Habitants at the time of Trottier traded fur primarily. On 4 July 1646, by Pierre Teuleron, sieur de Repentigny, granted Trottier land in La Rochelle to build and develop New France, under the authorization Jacques Le Neuf de la Poterie.

===Royal takeover and attempts to settle===

In 1650, New France had seven hundred colonists and Montreal had only a few dozen settlers. Because the First Nations people did most of the work of beaver hunting, the company needed few French employees. The sparsely populated New France almost fell to hostile Iroquois forces completely as well. In 1660, settler Adam Dollard des Ormeaux led a Canadian and Huron militia against a much larger Iroquois force; none of the Canadians survived, although they did turn back the Iroquois invasion.

In 1627, Quebec had only eighty-five French colonists and was easily overwhelmed two years later when three English privateers plundered the settlement. In 1663, New France finally became more secure when Louis XIV made it a royal province, taking control away from the Company of One Hundred Associates. In the same year the Société Notre-Dame de Montréal ceded its possessions to the Seminaire de Saint-Sulpice.

The Crown paid for transatlantic passages and offered other incentives to those willing to move to New France as well, after which the population of New France grew to three thousand.

In 1665, Louis XIV sent a French garrison, the Carignan-Salières Regiment, to Quebec. The colonial government was reformed along the lines of the government of France, with the Governor General and Intendant subordinate to the French Minister of the Marine. In 1665, Jean Talon Minister of the Marine accepted an appointment from Jean-Baptiste Colbert as the first Intendant of New France. These reforms limited the power of the Bishop of Quebec, who had held the greatest amount of power after the death of Champlain.

Talon tried reforming the seigneurial system by forcing the &quot;seigneurs&quot; to reside on their land and limiting the size of the &quot;seigneuries,&quot; intending to make more land available to new settlers. Talon&#x27;s attempts failed since very few settlers arrived and the various industries he established failed to surpass the importance of the fur trade.

====Settlers and their families====
The first settler, brought to Quebec by Champlain, was the apothecary Louis Hébert and his family of Paris. They expressly came to settle and remain in New France so as to make the settlement viable. Waves of recruits came in response to the requests for men with specific skills, &quot;e&quot;.&quot;g&quot;., farmers, architects, and blacksmiths. At the same time, the government encouraged intermarriages with the indigenous peoples and welcomed indentured servants, or &quot;engagés&quot; sent to New France. As couples married, cash incentives to have large families were put in place and proved effective.

To further strengthen the nascent France&#x27;s colonial empire, Louis XIV sponsored single women, virtuous, physically fit, and aged between 15 and 30 years, known as the King&#x27;s Daughters, or, in French, &quot;les filles du roi&quot;, to move to New France. The King paid for their passage and granted goods or money as their dowries upon their marriage to single settlers. Approximately 800 women, primarily from the impoverished Parisian, Norman, and West-Central families, relocated during 1663–1673. By 1672, the population of New France had risen to 6,700 people, a marked increase from the population of 3,200 people in 1663.
This rapid demographic growth was predicated both on the high demand for children and on the ready supply of natural resources to support them. According to Landry, &quot;Canadians had an exceptional diet for their time. This was due to the natural abundance of meat, fish, and pure water; the good food conservation conditions during the winter; and an adequate wheat supply in most years.&quot; Consequently, colonial women bore about 30% more children than comparable women in France. 

Besides household duties, some women participated in the fur trade, the major source of money in New France. They worked at home alongside their husbands or fathers as merchants, clerks, and provisioners. Some were widows who took over their husbands&#x27; roles. Some even became independent and active entrepreneurs.

====Settlements in Louisiana====
The French extended their territorial claim to the south and to the west of the American colonies late in the 17th century, naming it for King Louis XIV, as La Louisiane. In 1682, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle explored the Ohio River Valley and the Mississippi River Valley, and he claimed the entire territory for France as far south as the Gulf of Mexico.

La Salle attempted to establish the first southern colony in the new territory in 1685, but inaccurate maps and navigational issues led him to instead establish his Fort Saint Louis in what is now Texas. The colony was devastated by disease, and the surviving settlers were killed in 1688, in an attack by the area&#x27;s indigenous population. Other parts of Louisiana were settled and developed with success, such as New Orleans and southern Illinois, leaving a strong French influence in these areas long after the Louisiana Purchase.

Many strategic forts were built there, under the orders of Governor Louis de Buade de Frontenac. Forts were also built in the older portions of New France that had not yet been settled. Many of these forts were garrisoned by the Troupes de la Marine, the only regular soldiers in New France between 1683 and 1755.

===Conquest of New France===
==Fur trade and economy==

According to the staples thesis, the economic development of New France was marked by the emergence of successive economies based on staple commodities, each of which dictated the political and cultural settings of the time. During the 16th and early 17th centuries New France&#x27;s economy was heavily centered on its Atlantic fisheries. This would change in the later half of the 17th and 18th centuries as French settlement penetrated further into the continental interior. Here French economic interests would shift and concentrate itself on the development of the North American fur trade. It would soon become the new staple good that would strengthen and drive New France&#x27;s economy, in particular that of Montreal, for the next century.

The trading post of Ville-Marie, established on the current island of Montreal, quickly became the economic hub for the French fur trade. It achieved this in great part due to its particular location along the St. Lawrence River. From here a new economy emerged, one of size and density that provided increased economic opportunities for the inhabitants of New France. In December 1627 the Company of New France was recognized and given commercial rights to the gathering and export of furs from French territories. By trading with various indigenous populations and securing the main markets its power grew steadily for the next decade. As a result, it was able to set specific price points for furs and other valuable goods, often doing so to protect its economic hegemony over other trading partners and other areas of the economy.

The fur trade itself was based on a commodity of small bulk but high value. Because of this it managed to attract increased attention and/or input capital that would otherwise be intended for other areas of the economy. The Montreal area witnessed a stagnant agricultural sector; it remained for the most part subsistence orientated with little or no trade purposes outside of the French colony. This was a prime example of the handicapping effect the fur trade had on its neighbouring areas of the economy.

Nonetheless, by the beginning of the 1700s, the economic prosperity the fur trade stimulated slowly transformed Montreal. Economically, it was no longer a town of small traders or of fur fairs but rather a city of merchants and of bright lights. The primary sector of the fur trade, the act of acquiring and the selling of the furs, quickly promoted the growth of complementary second and tertiary sectors of the economy. For instance a small number of tanneries was established in Montreal as well as a larger number of inns, taverns and markets that would support the growing number of inhabitants whose livelihood depended on the fur trade. Already by 1683 there were well over 140 families and there may have been as many as 900 people living in Montreal.

The founding of John Law&#x27;s Company in 1717, once again highlighted the economic importance of the fur trade. This merchant association, like its predecessor the Compagnie des Cent Associés, regulated the fur trade to the best of its abilities imposing price points, supporting government sale taxes and combating black market practices. However, by the middle half of the 18th century the fur trade was in a slow decline.

The natural abundance of furs had passed and it could no longer meet market demand. This eventually resulted in the repeal of the 25 percent sales tax that had previously aimed at curbing the administrative costs New France had accumulated. In addition, dwindling supply increased black market trading. A greater number of indigenous groups and fur traders began circumventing Montreal and New France altogether; many began trading with either British or Dutch merchants to the south.

By the end of French rule in New France in 1763, the fur trade had significantly lost its importance as the key staple good that supported much of New France&#x27;s economy for more than the last century. Even so, it did serve as the fundamental force behind the establishment and vast growth of Montreal and the French colony.

===Coureurs des bois and voyageurs===

The coureurs des bois were responsible for starting the flow of trade from Montreal, carrying French goods into upper territories while indigenous people were bringing down their furs. The coureurs traveled with intermediate trading tribes, and found that they were anxious to prevent French access to the more distant fur-hunting tribes. Still, the coureurs kept thrusting outwards using the Ottawa River as their initial step upon the journey and keeping Montreal as their starting point. The Ottawa River was significant because it offered a route that was practical for Europeans, by taking the traders northward out of the territory dominated by the Iroquois. It was for this reason that Montreal and the Ottawa River was a central location of indigenous warfare and rivalry.

Montreal faced difficulties by having too many coureurs out in the woods. The furs coming down were causing an oversupply on the markets of Europe. This challenged the coureurs trade because they so easily evaded controls, monopolies, and taxation, and additionally because the coureurs trade was held to debauch both French and various indigenous groups. The coureur debauched Frenchmen by accustoming them to fully live with indigenous, and indigenous by trading on their desire for alcohol.

The issues caused a great rift in the colony, and in 1678, it was confirmed by a General Assembly that the trade was to be made in public so as to better assure the safety of the indigenous population. It was also forbidden to take spirits inland to trade with indigenous groups. However, these restrictions on the coureurs, for a variety of reasons, never worked. The fur trade remained dependent on spirits, and increasingly in the hands of the coureurs who journeyed north in search of furs.

As time passed, the Coureurs des bois were partially replaced by licensed fur trading endeavors, and the main canoe travel workers of those endeavors were called voyageurs.

===Indigenous peoples===

The French and Algonquins first encountered one another in 1603 after Samuel de Champlain established France&#x27;s first permanent North American settlement along the St. Lawrence River. In 1610, the Algonquins continued to solidify their relations with the French by guiding Étienne Brûlé into the interiors of Canada.

The relationship between the Iroquois and the French first began in 1609, when Samuel De Champlain engaged in battle against the Iroquois. Champlain travelled from the St. Lawrence Valley, accompanied by his Algonquin, Montagnais, and Huron allies, and managed to kill three Iroquoian chiefs on Lake Champlain with the first shots of his arquebus. Subsequently, the two factions (Iroquois and French) were constantly at war with one another until the Great Peace of Montréal in 1701.

The French were interested in exploiting the land through the fur trade as well as the timber trade later on. Despite having tools and guns, the French settlers were dependent on Indigenous people to survive in the difficult climate in this part of North America. Many settlers did not know how to survive through the winter; the Indigenous people showed them how to survive in the New World. They showed the settlers how to hunt for food and to use the furs for clothing that would protect them during the winter months. Modern historians have highlighted that despite largely functional relations with indigenous peoples, administrators in France viewed co-operation as a wholly irritating task. Geographically removed from the colonies, Parisian courtiers viewed indigenous peoples as &quot;&#x27;sauvages&quot;&#x27;, often criticising New French officials for even interacting with nations.

As the fur trade became the dominant economy in the New World, French voyageurs, trappers and hunters often married or formed relationships with Indigenous women. This allowed the French to develop relations with their wives&#x27; Indigenous nations, which in turn provided protection and access to their hunting and trapping grounds.

One specific Indigenous group borne of these relationships are the Métis people, who are descendants of marriages between French men and Indigenous women. Their name originates from an old French term for “person of mixed parentage.” At the beginning of the fur trade, these relationships were encouraged by the French as a way to encourage the First Nations to adopt French culture and solidify alliances, but as the Métis began to emerge as an independent culture around the 1700s, it began to be discouraged by the French. Many Métis families moved to western Canada in response to this, as well as for other reasons, such as fur trading opportunities. One major settlement at this time was in the Red River Valley, strategically placed in a significant area for the fur trade. This was the origin of the modern Métis nation, which was legally recognized by modern Canada as a protected Indigenous group in the Constitution Act, 1982. Its prior legal history has its roots in acts such as the Manitoba Act, 1870, which began to recognize the Métis nation as a separate group with various rights and protections, but was not supported by the vast majority of Métis as it removed many from land that was rightfully theirs.

The fur trade benefited Indigenous people as well. They traded furs for metal tools and other European-made items that made their lives easier. Tools such as knives, pots and kettles, nets, firearms and hatchets improved the general welfare of indigenous peoples. At the same time, while everyday life became easier, some traditional ways of doing things were abandoned or altered, and while Indigenous people embraced many of these implements and tools, they also were exposed to less vital trade goods, such as alcohol and sugar, sometimes with deleterious effects. The Iroquois, like most tribes, began to rely on the importation of European goods, like firearms, which contributed significantly to a decrease in the beaver population of the Hudson Valley. This decline resulted in the fur trade moving further north, along the St. Lawrence River.

===Formal entry of England in New France area fur trade===
Since Henry Hudson had claimed Hudson Bay, and the surrounding lands for England in 1611, English colonists had begun expanding their boundaries across what is now the Canadian north beyond the French-held territory of New France. In 1670, King Charles II of England issued a charter to Prince Rupert and &quot;the Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson Bay&quot; for an English monopoly in harvesting furs in Rupert&#x27;s Land, a portion of the land draining into Hudson Bay. This is the start of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, ironically aided by French &quot;coureurs des bois&quot;, Pierre-Esprit Radisson and Médard des Groseilliers, frustrated with French license rules. Now both France and England were formally in the Canadian fur trade.

===The economy of &quot;La Louisiane&quot;===

The major commercial importance of the Louisiana Purchase territory was the Mississippi River. New Orleans, the largest and most important city in the territory, was the most commercial city in the United States until the Civil War, with most jobs there being related to trade and shipping; there was little manufacturing. The first commercial shipment to come down the Mississippi River was of deer and bear hides in 1705. The area, always loosely defined in those early times of European claims and settlements, extended as far east as the city that is now Mobile, Alabama, begun by French settlers in 1702.

The French (later Spanish) Louisiana Territory was owned by France for a number of years before the money-losing territory was transferred to French banker Antoine Crozat in 1713 for 15 years. After losing four times his investment, Crozat gave up his charter in 1717. Control of Louisiana and its 700 inhabitants was given to the Company of the Indies in 1719. The company conducted a major settlement program by recruiting European settlers to locate in the territory. Unemployed persons, convicts and prostitutes were also sent to the Louisiana Territory. After the bankruptcy of the company in 1720, control was returned to the king.

Louis XV saw little value in Louisiana, and to compensate Spain for its losses in the Seven Years&#x27; War, he transferred Louisiana to his cousin Charles III in 1762. Louisiana remained under the control of Spain until it was demanded to be turned over to France by Napoleon. Although Louisiana was property of France by the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1800, Louisiana continued to be administered by Spain until the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Following the American acquisition of the territory, its population tripled between 1803 and Louisiana statehood in 1812.

==Religion==

Before the arrival of European colonists and explorers, First Nations followed a wide array of mostly animistic religions. During the colonial period, the French settled along the shores of the Saint Lawrence River, specifically Catholics, including a number of Jesuits dedicated to converting the indigenous population; an effort that eventually proved successful.

The Catholic Church, which after Champlain&#x27;s death was the dominant force in New France, wanted to establish a Christian community in the colony. In 1642, they sponsored a group of settlers, led by Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve, who founded Ville-Marie, precursor to present-day Montreal, farther up the St. Lawrence. Throughout the 1640s, Jesuit missionaries penetrated the Great Lakes region and converted many of the Huron. The missionaries came into conflict with the Iroquois, who frequently attacked Montreal.
The presence of Jesuit missionaries in Huron society was nonnegotiable. The Huron relied on French goods to facilitate life and warfare. Because the French would refuse trade to all indigenous societies that denied relations with missionaries, the Huron had more of a propensity towards Christian conversion. The Huron heavily relied on European goods to perform burial ceremonies known as The Huron Feast of the Dead. Trading with the French allowed for larger amounts of decorative goods to be buried during ceremonies as opposed to only a bare minimum. With the growing epidemics and high number of deaths, the Huron could not afford to lose relations with the French, fearing to anger their ancestors.

Jesuit missionaries explored the Mississippi River, including the Illinois Country. Father Jacques Marquette and explorer Louis Jolliet traveled in a small party, starting from Green Bay down the Wisconsin River to the Mississippi River, communicating with the tribes they met en route. Although Spanish trade goods had reached most of the indigenous peoples, these were the first Frenchmen to connect in the area named for the Illinois, including the Kaskaskia. They kept detailed records of what they saw and the people they met, sketching what they could, and mapped the Mississippi River in 1673. Their travels were described as first contacts with the indigenous peoples, though evidence of contact with Spanish from the south was clear.

Subsequent to the arrival of French children in Quebec in 1634, measles was also brought along with them, which quickly spread among the indigenous peoples. Jesuit priest Jean de Brébeuf described the symptoms as being severe. Brebeuf stated that the fearlessness of the indigenous peoples towards death upon this disease made them perfect candidates for conversion to Christianity. The indigenous peoples believed that if they did not convert to Christianity, they would be exposed to the evil magic of the priests that caused the illness.

Jesuit missionaries were troubled by the absence of patriarchy in indigenous communities. Indigenous women were highly regarded within their societies and participated in political and military decisions. Jesuits attempted to eliminate the matriarchy and shift the powers of men and women to accommodate those of European societies. &quot;In France, women are to be obedient to their masters, their husbands.&quot; Jesuits would attempt to justify this to the indigenous women in hopes to enlighten them on proper European behavior. In response, Indigenous women grew worrisome of the presence of these missionaries fearing they would lose power and freedom within their communities. By 1649, both the Jesuit mission and the Huron society were almost destroyed by Iroquois invasions (see Canadian Martyrs). In 1653, a peace invitation was extended by the Onondaga Nation, one of the five nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, to New France, and an expedition of Jesuits, led by Simon Le Moyne, established Sainte Marie de Ganentaa in 1656. The Jesuits were forced to abandon the mission by 1658, as hostilities with the Iroquois resumed.

The second article of the charter of the &quot;Compagnie des Cent-Associés&quot; stated that New France could only be Catholic. This resulted in Huguenots facing legal restrictions to enter the colony when Cardinal Richelieu transferred the control of the colony to &quot;Compagnie des Cent-Associés&quot; in 1627. Protestantism was then outlawed in France and all its overseas possessions by the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685. In spite of that, approximately 15,000 Protestants settled in New France by using socioeconomic pretexts while at the same time concealing their religious background.

The Huguenots (a name used to designate French-Speaking Protestants) were a mercantile group, originating from the coastal cities of North-Western France, and had a significant impact on the early development of New France, especially in the regions of Quebec and Acadia, where many people still hold Huguenot surnames to this day. Huguenots were famous for their large and interconnected trading and communication network that spanned throughout France, and most of her colonies. This network was also known for trading with the Dutch Republic, and the Kingdom of England; two of France&#x27;s most important rivals, that also happened to be Protestant nations.

Initially, King Henri IV recognised Protestants as a significant minority within France, and allowed them a certain degree of freedom within their religion. After several years of various skirmishes within Metropolitan France, the Huguenots were deemed to not be &quot;faithful servants of the king&quot;, and their mercantile powers stripped, their trading network disbanded, and widespread governmental persecutory policies were enacted both within mainland France and Nouvelle France. In 1661, Louis XVI was able to enact self-rule as his regency ended, and he instituted a variety of anti-Protestant conventions throughout the greater French Empire. Under these new rules, Protestant children were forcibly converted to Catholicism, implemented direct governmental jurisdiction over what were formerly Huguenot-controlled trade routes, and labelled the Protestant communities throughout Nouvelle France (specifically Quebec and Acadia) as significant threats to the colonies, as they might sympathise with English Protestants competing in the same areas and trades. Eventually, Protestants were banned from settling in Nouvelle France, and the existing ones were only allowed to &quot;summer&quot; in the colonies, not &quot;winter&quot; there.

==Judiciary of New France==
===Early history in New France (pre-1663)===

In the early stage of French settlement, legal matters fell within the Governor of New France&#x27;s purview. Under this arrangement, legal disputes were settled in an incoherent fashion due to the Governor&#x27;s arbitrariness in issuing verdicts.

Since 1640, a Seneschal (&quot;sénéchal&quot;), a Judge (&quot;juge d&#x27;épée&quot;, which literally means &#x27;sword-bearing judge&#x27;), and a jurisdiction in Trois-Rivières were created. However, the Seneschal was under the oversight by the Governor, hence the Governor still had rather extensive control over legal matters in New France. In 1651, the Company of New France made the Great Seneschal (&quot;Grand Sénéchal&quot;) the chief justice. However, the Island of Montreal had its special Governor at that time, who also administered justice on the Island, and had not handed over justice to the Grand Seneschal until 1652.

In practice, though, the Great Seneschal was awarded as an honorary title to the son of Jean de Lauson, then Governor of New France; judicial functions were in fact carried out by the Seneschal&#x27;s deputies. These deputies included such officials as the civil and criminal lieutenant general (&quot;lieutenant général civil et criminel&quot;), the special lieutenant (&quot;lieutenant particulier&quot;, acting as assistant royal judge), and the lieutenant fiscal (&quot;lieutenant fiscal&quot;, acting as tax magistrate).

The Civil and Criminal Lieutenant General sat as judge in trials at first instance, whereas appeals would be adjudicated by the Governor, who held the sovereign right to settle final appeals on behalf of the French king. The Great Seneschal also had a magistrate in Trois-Rivières, as well as a bailiff formed by the Society of Priests of Saint Sulpice on the Island of Montreal.
Apart from judicial responsibilities, the Great Seneschal was also in charge of convening local nobility in New France, as well as issuing declarations of war if necessary. However, such alternative role of the Great Seneschal was much weakened soon after by having the rights to declare war and to administer finances stripped off from the office because the French crown feared that colonial officers held too much authority.

===Legal reforms (1663)===

====Royal judges and the Sovereign Council====
On 13 October 1663, the royal court replaced the Seneschal Office (&quot;sénéchaussée&quot;). Canada was divided into three districts: the district of Quebec City, the district of Trois-Rivières, and the district of Montreal. Each district had its own separate jurisdiction with a judge appointed by the Crown, known as the civil and criminal lieutenants general. They were responsible for all legal matters, civil and criminal, in each of the districts.

In addition to the royal judges, there were other judicial officers in each district. The clerk of court (registrar) was responsible for transcribing all court proceedings as well as other documents relevant to each of the cases. The king&#x27;s attorney (&quot;procureur du roi&quot;) was responsible for inquiring into the facts and preparing the case against the accused. In the districts of Quebec City and Montreal, the royal judges had special lieutenants to substitute them whenever they were absent or sick. Feudal courts heard minor cases.

The reform also brought the Sovereign Council of New France (&quot;Conseil souverain&quot;) into existence, which was later renamed the Superior Council (&quot;Conseil supérieur&quot;). The Sovereign Council effectively acted as the functional equivalent of a Council of State (&quot;Conseil d&#x27;État&quot;) for New France, having the authority to hand down verdicts on final appeal. Initially, the Council convened once every week, and the quorum of the Sovereign Council was seven for criminal matters, or five for civil cases. The council&#x27;s practices evolved over time. At the Sovereign Council there was a king&#x27;s attorney-general (&quot;procureur général du roi&quot;) in charge of the similar tasks as the district king&#x27;s attorneys. He was also responsible for supervising the king&#x27;s attorneys&#x27; daily operations as well as execution of royal edicts and regulations passed by the council in their respective districts.

====The Custom of Paris====

In 1664, the Custom of Paris (&quot;coutume de Paris&quot;) was formally set as the main source of law for civil law in France&#x27;s overseas empire. All royal judges and king&#x27;s attorneys in New France had to be thoroughly familiar with this compilation of rules. The Custom governed various civil aspects of the daily life in New France, including property, marriage, inheritance, and so on.

=====Montreal Island: transition from feudal justice to royal justice=====
The Island of Montreal was a special case because its judiciary had been previously held by the Society of St-Sulpice. In 1663, Governor-General of New France Augustin de Saffray de Mésy originally considered appointing Paul de Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve the Governor of the Island of Montreal and consolidating a royal jurisdiction on the island, but the plan garnered the St-Sulpicians&#x27; disapproval, who held the Island as its own fiefdom and effectively acted as the island&#x27;s governor. In other words, the Sovereign Council had not been able to seize effective control over the legal matters of the Island; instead, the St-Sulpicians administered justice on the island.

It was not until 16 September 1666, that the St-Sulpicians finally handed over the justice of the Island of Montreal to the Intendant of New France. In 1693, the French king commanded the replacement of the ecclesiastical courts in Montreal with a royal court composed of one royal judge, with appeals going to the Sovereign Council. The introduction of a royal court on the Montreal Island also resulted in the abolition of the feudal court in the fief of Trois-Rivières (then held by the Jesuits).

=====Quebec: founding of the Provostry of Quebec=====
In the Quebec City district, the lower court (&quot;tribunal antérieur&quot;) was established in 1664 and had jurisdiction to try cases at first instance, but then it was abolished in 1674. The Sovereign Council appointed trial judges (&quot;juges inférieurs&quot;) to adjudicate cases at first instance until the Provostry of Quebec (&quot;prévôté de Québec&quot;) was created in May 1677.

The Provostry of Quebec was located in the Hall of Justice (&quot;palais de justice&quot;) in Quebec City and had only one royal judge, also known as the civil and criminal lieutenant general of Quebec City, who heard both civil and criminal cases, as well as district police. Additionally, a court clerk and a king&#x27;s attorney were appointed to the court; if either of these two officers could not attend the trials due to illness or other untenable circumstances, the Intendant would appoint a temporary substitute.

===Criminal justice===

In the early stages of French colonization, the execution of criminal justice in New France was rather arbitrary. The Governor of New France served as the judge to the colonists as well as soldiers. He would announce his verdict at the presence of the chiefs of the Company of One Hundred Associates and that would be final.

After the Sovereign Council was established in Quebec in 1663, the Council carried out criminal justice according to the general ordinances of France. In 1670, the Criminal Ordinance was enacted in New France by order of the French king as a codification of the previous criminal laws passed by the Sovereign Council.

===Special courts===
====Ecclesiastical court====

The ecclesiastical court (&quot;tribunal ecclésiastique&quot;, or &quot;Officialité&quot;) was a special court for hearing first instance trials on both religious and secular affairs involving members of the Church. It first appeared in around 1660 but was not officially recognized by state authorities for it was not administered by a bishop, until 1684. Appeals from this court lay with the Sovereign Council.

====Admiralty court====
The court of admiralty was created on 12 January 1717 and was the last judicial body set up in Canada during the French colonial period. The court had a judge (also known as the lieutenant-general of the court) appointed by the French admiralty, a king&#x27;s attorney, a clerk of court, and one or two bailiffs (&quot;huissiers&quot;). The admiralty court was located in Quebec City and had jurisdiction over all of New France except Louisiana and Louisbourg. The court heard first instance trials on maritime affairs, including commerce and seamen&#x27;s conduct. During wartime, it also commanded maritime police. Before 1717, the Quebec Provostry performed the duties of the admiralty court.

===Acadia===

Unlike Canada, Acadia&#x27;s judicial system was somewhat under-developed during the New France period. Prior to 1670, Acadia was in a state of being contested between various European colonists. None of the Euroean countries—France, England, the Netherlands—were able to put in place a stable jurisdiction there.

In 1670, France regained control of Acadia and appointed Mathieu de Goutin as the Civil and Criminal Lieutenant (&quot;lieutenant civil et criminel&quot;) of Acadia. Simultaneously, the Governor of Acadia was set up and his job was primarily the defense of Acadia from English attacks. The Civil and Criminal Lieutenant was essentially supervised by the Governor, who held superior judicial authority over the Lieutenant, but for most of the time would let the Lieutenant mediate and decide legal affairs.

Due to the situation in Acadia as a small settlement of around 399 settlers in 1670–71, vulnerable to foreign invasion, courts were minimal, consisting of only a Civil and Criminal Lieutenant and a king&#x27;s attorney. There was not an official court in Acadia, although the king&#x27;s attorney of Acadia performed very similar duties as his counterpart in New France. Yet since Acadia never actually had a court, there was no clerk of court; instead, trials were recorded by a local notary. It is difficult to trace the judicial history of French Acadia as the relevant archives were destroyed in a fire in 1708.

==Military conflicts==

The presence of settlers, of businesses from several European countries harvesting furs, along with the interests of the indigenous people in this new competition for North American resources set the scene for significant military conflicts among all parties in New France beginning in 1642, and ending with the Seven Years&#x27; War, 1756–1763.

===Iroquois attacks against Montreal===
Ville-Marie was a noteworthy site for it was the center of defence against the Iroquois, the point of departure for all western and northern journeys, and the meeting point to which the trading Indians brought their annual furs. This placed Ville-Marie, later known as Montreal, at the forefront against the Iroquois, which resulted in its trade being easily and frequently interrupted. The Iroquois were in alliance with the Dutch and English, which allowed them to interrupt the French fur trade and send the furs down the Hudson River to the Dutch and English traders.

This also put the Iroquois at warfare against the Hurons, the Algonquians, and any other tribes that were in alliance with the French. If the Iroquois could destroy New France and its Indian allies, they would be able to trade freely and profitably with the Dutch and English on the Hudson River. The Iroquois formally attacked the settlement at today&#x27;s Quebec City in its foundation year of 1642, and in almost every subsequent year thereafter. A militant theocracy maintained Montreal. In 1653 and 1654, reinforcements arrived at Montreal, which allowed the Iroquois to be halted. In that year the Iroquois made peace with the French.

Adam Dollard des Ormeaux, a colonist and soldier of New France, was a notable figure regarding the Iroquois attacks against Montreal. The Iroquois soon resumed their assaults against Montreal, and the few settlers of Montreal fell almost completely to hostile Iroquois forces. The Iroquois did not use typical raiding tactics of moving swiftly and silently. Instead, they captured individuals and brought them back to their own territory. Women and children were made a part of the village, and men encountered slow torturous deaths. In the 1660s, warfare changed, and France began to counterattack. Professional French soldiers had arrived in the New World for the first time, and Alexandre de Prouville led them to invade Iroquois territory. In the spring of 1660, Adam Dollard des Ormeaux led a small militia consisting of 16 men from Montreal against a much larger Iroquois force at the Battle of Long Sault on the Ottawa River. They succeeded in turning back the Iroquois invasion and are responsible for saving Montreal from destruction. They were able to take Chief Canaqueese as a prisoner, and in September 1660, the French returned and burned Iroquois homes and crops. Later that Winter, many Iroquois died due to starvation, and the Iroquois finally agreed to peace which lasted roughly twenty years. The encounter between Ormeaux and the Iroquois is of significance because it dissuaded the Iroquois from further attacks against Montreal.

===King William&#x27;s War===

In 1688, King William&#x27;s War began and the English and Iroquois launched a major assault on New France, after many years of small skirmishes throughout the English and French territories. New France and the Wabanaki Confederacy were able to thwart New England expansion into Acadia, whose border New France defined as the Kennebec River in southern Maine. King William&#x27;s War ended in 1697, but a second war (Queen Anne&#x27;s War) broke out in 1702. Quebec survived the English invasions of both these wars, and during the wars France seized many of the English Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company fur trading centres on Hudson Bay including York Factory, which the French renamed &quot;Fort Bourbon&quot;.

===Queen Anne&#x27;s War===
While Acadia defeated an English invasion attempt during King William&#x27;s War, the colony was occupied by the British during Queen Anne&#x27;s War. The final Conquest of Acadia happened in 1710. In 1713, peace came to New France with the Treaty of Utrecht. Although the treaty turned Hudson Bay, Newfoundland and part of Acadia (peninsular Nova Scotia) over to Great Britain, France remained in control of Île Royale (Cape Breton Island) (which also administered Île Saint-Jean (Prince Edward Island)). The northern part of Acadia, what is today New Brunswick and Maine, remained contested territory. Construction of Fortress Louisbourg on Île Royale, a French military stronghold intended to protect the approaches to the St. Lawrence River settlements, began in 1719.

===Father Rale&#x27;s War===

In Acadia, however, war continued. Father Rale&#x27;s War (1722–1725) was a series of battles between New England and the Wabanaki Confederacy, who were allied with New France. New France and the Wabanaki Confederacy defended against the expansion of New England settlements into Acadia, whose border New France defined as the Kennebec River in southern Maine. After the New England Conquest of Acadia in 1710, mainland Nova Scotia was under the control of New England, but both present-day New Brunswick and virtually all of present-day Maine remained contested territory between New England and New France. To secure New France&#x27;s claim to the region, it established Catholic missions among the three largest indigenous villages in the region: one on the Kennebec River (Norridgewock); one further north on the Penobscot River (Penobscot) and one on the Saint John River (Medoctec).

The war began on two fronts: when New England pushed its way through Maine and when New England established itself at Canso, Nova Scotia. As a result of the war, Maine fell to the New Englanders with the defeat of Father Sébastien Rale at Norridgewock and the subsequent retreat of the indigenous peoples from the Kennebec and Penobscot rivers to St. Francis and Becancour, Quebec.

===King George&#x27;s War===
Peace lasted in Canada until 1744, when news of the outbreak of the War of the Austrian Succession (King George&#x27;s War in North America) reached Fort Louisbourg. The French forces went on the attack first in a failed attempt to capture Annapolis Royal, the capital of British Nova Scotia. In 1745, William Shirley, governor of Massachusetts, led a counterattack on Louisbourg. Both France and New France were unable to relieve the siege, and Louisbourg fell to the British. With the famed Duc d&#x27;Anville Expedition, France attempted to retake Acadia and the fortress in 1746 but failed. The fortress was returned to France under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, but the peace treaty, which restored all colonial borders to their pre-war status, did little to end the lingering enmity between France, Britain, and their respective colonies, nor did it resolve any territorial disputes.

===Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War===
Within Acadia and Nova Scotia, Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War (1749–1755) began with the British founding of Halifax. During Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War, New France established three forts along the border of present-day New Brunswick to protect it from a New England attack from Nova Scotia. The war continued until British victory at Fort Beausejour, which dislodged Father Le Loutre from the region, thereby ending his alliance with the Maliseet, Acadians and Mi&#x27;kmaq.

===French and Indian War===

Fort Duquesne, located at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers at the site of present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, guarded the most important strategic location in the west at the time of the Seven Years&#x27; War. It was built to ensure that the Ohio River valley remained under French control. A small colonial force from Virginia began a fort here, but a French force under Claude-Pierre Pécaudy de Contrecœur drove them off in April 1754. New France claimed this as part of their colony, and the French were anxious to keep the British from encroaching on it. The French built Fort Duquesne here to serve as a military stronghold and as a base for developing trade and strengthening military alliances with the indigenous peoples of the area.

In 1755, General Edward Braddock led an expedition against Fort Duquesne, and although they were numerically superior to the French militia and their Indian allies, Braddock&#x27;s army was routed and Braddock was killed. Later that same year at the Battle of Lake George, the British General William Johnson with a force of 1700 American and Iroquois troops defeated a French force of 2800 French and Canadians and 700 Native Americans led by Baron Dieskau (Military commander of New France).

The fight for control over Ohio Country led to the French and Indian War, which began as the North American phase of the Seven Years&#x27; War (which did not technically begin in Europe until 1756). The war began with the defeat of a Virginia militia contingent led by Colonel George Washington by the French troupes de la marine in the Ohio valley. As a result of that defeat, the British decided to prepare the conquest of Quebec City, the capital of New France. The British defeated France in Acadia in the Battle of Fort Beausejour (1755) and then Île Royale (Cape Breton Island) (which also administered Île Saint-Jean (Prince Edward Island) with the Siege of Louisbourg (1758).

Throughout the war, the British deported the Acadians to the Thirteen Colonies and Europe, which the Acadian militias resisted with assistance from Mi&#x27;kmaq and Malisteet forces. The Great Upheaval continued from 1755 to 1764. In 1756, a large force of French, Canadians, and their Native American allies led by the Marquis de Montcalm launched an attack against the key British post at Fort Oswego on Lake Ontario from Fort Frontenac and forced the garrison to surrender. The following year Montcalm with a huge force of 7,200 French and Canadian troops and 2,400 Native Americans laid siege to Fort William Henry on the southern shores of Lake George, and after three weeks of fighting the British commander Monroe surrendered. Montcalm gave him honorable terms to return to England and not to fight for 18 months. And yet, when the British force with civilians was three miles from the fort, the Native American allies massacred about 1,100 of the 1,500 strong force.

In 1758, the French suffered a defeat when the British captured the fortress city of Louisborg in July, while gaining a victory at Fort Carillon in July. The Battle of Carillon was fought at the fortress of the same name, which is located on a strip of land between Lake Champlain and Lake George, and which was defended by 3,400 French regular troops and marines, with minimal support from militia and indigenous peoples. The battle was the largest seen in North America up to that time, as General James Abercrombie assembled a force of 16,200 British, American, and Iroquois troops. A spirited French defense led the British to withdraw after a fierce battle on the 8th of July, 1758. During the battle, the British suffered 2,200 casualties and lost several artillery pieces, while the French received roughly 104 killed and 273 wounded.

While the British Conquest of Acadia happened in 1710, the French continued to remain a significant force in the region with Fort Beausejour and Fortress Louisbourg. The dominant population in the region remained Acadian, that is to say, not British. In 1755, the British were successful in the Battle of Beausejour and immediately after began the expulsion of the Acadians.

In the meantime the French continued to explore westwards and expand their trade alliances with indigenous peoples. Fort de la Corne was built in 1753, by Louis de la Corne, Chevalier de la Corne just east of the Saskatchewan River Forks in what is today the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. This was the furthest westward outpost of the French Empire in North America to be established before its fall.

==Treaties of cession==

In 1758, British forces again captured Louisbourg, allowing them to blockade the entrance to the St. Lawrence River. This proved decisive in the war. In 1759, the British besieged Quebec by sea, and an army under General James Wolfe defeated the French under General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in September. The garrison in Quebec surrendered on 18 September, and by the next year New France had been conquered by the British after the attack on Montreal, which had refused to acknowledge the fall of Canada. The last French governor-general of New France, Pierre François de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal, surrendered to British Major General Jeffery Amherst on 8 September 1760. France formally ceded Canada to the British in the Treaty of Paris, signed 10 February 1763.

==Aftermath==


The expelled Acadians were initially dispersed across much of eastern North America (including the Thirteen Colonies) and some were sent to France. Many eventually settled in Quebec or Louisiana, while others returned to the regions of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Chéticamp, Nova Scotia, and the Magdalen Islands have significant communities. In Louisiana their descendants became known as the Cajuns, a corruption of the French &quot;Acadiens&quot;.

By the mid-1700s, the French settlers were well established with a population around 70,000, mainly due to natural increase. The European population had grown slowly under French rule. The British Thirteen Colonies to the south along the Atlantic coast grew in population from natural increase and more new settlers from Europe. By 1760, almost 1.6 million people lived in the British colonies, a ratio of approximately twenty-three to one compared to New France. The population of the New England colonies alone in 1760 was nearly 450,000.

French culture and religion remained dominant in most of the former territory of New France until the arrival of British settlers led to the later creation of Upper Canada (today Ontario) and New Brunswick. The Louisiana Territory, under Spanish control since the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War, remained off-limits to settlement from the thirteen American colonies.

Twelve years after the British defeated the French, the American Revolutionary War broke out in the Thirteen Colonies. Many French Canadians would take part in the war, including Major Clément Gosselin and Admiral Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil. After the British surrender at Yorktown in 1781, the Treaty of Versailles gave all former British claims in New France below the Great Lakes into the possession of the nascent United States. A Franco-Spanish alliance treaty returned Louisiana to France in 1801, but French leader Napoleon Bonaparte sold it to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, ending French colonial efforts in North America.

The portions of the former New France that remained under British rule were administered as Upper Canada and Lower Canada, 1791–1841, and then those regions were merged as the Province of Canada during 1841–1867, when the passage of the British North America Act of 1867 instituted home rule for most of British North America and established French-speaking Quebec (the former Lower Canada) as one of the original provinces of the Dominion of Canada. The former French colony of Acadia was first designated the Colony of Nova Scotia but shortly thereafter the Colony of New Brunswick, which then included Prince Edward Island, was split off from it.

In Canada, the legacy of New France can be seen in the enduring Francophone identity of its descendants, which has led to institutional bilingualism in Canada as a whole.

The only remnant of the former colonial territory of New France that remains under French control to this day is the French overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon (French: Collectivité territoriale de Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon), consisting of a group of small islands off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada.

==Historiography==
The Conquest (referring to the fall of New France to the British, and specifically the events of 1759–60) has always been a central and contested theme of Canadian memory. Some Anglophone historians portray the Conquest as a victory for &quot;British military, political and economic superiority&quot; and argue that it ultimately brought benefits to the French settlers. However, Cornelius Jaenen notes that French-Canadian historians remain strongly divided on the subject. One group sees it as a highly negative economic, political and ideological disaster that threatened a way of life with materialism and Protestantism. At the other pole are those historians who see the positive benefit of enabling the preservation of language, and religion and traditional customs under British rule. French-Canadian debates have escalated since the 1960s, as the conquest is seen as a pivotal moment in the history of Québec&#x27;s nationalism. Francophone historian Jocelyn Létourneau suggested in 2009, that today, &quot;1759 does not belong primarily to a past that we might wish to study and understand, but, rather, to a present and a future that we might wish to shape and control.&quot;

The enduring contestation of the legacy of the Conquest can be exemplified by an episode in 2009, when an attempt to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the battle of the Plains of Abraham was cancelled. The explanation for the cancellation was that it was over security concerns, but activist Sylvain Rocheleau stated, &quot;[I think] they had to cancel the event because it was insulting a majority of Francophones. They had to cancel it because it was a bad idea.&quot;.

<text>Fusional languages or inflected languages are a type of synthetic language, distinguished from agglutinative languages by their tendency to use single inflectional morphemes to denote multiple grammatical, syntactic, or semantic features. 

For example, the Spanish verb &quot;comer&quot; (&quot;to eat&quot;) has the first-person singular preterite tense form &quot;comí&quot; (&quot;I ate&quot;); the single suffix &quot;-í&quot; represents &quot;both&quot; the features of first-person singular agreement and preterite tense, instead of having a separate affix for each feature.

Another illustration of fusionality is the Latin word (&quot;good&quot;). The ending denotes masculine gender, nominative case, and singular number. Changing any one of these features requires replacing the suffix with a different one. In the form , the ending denotes masculine accusative singular, neuter accusative singular, or neuter nominative singular.

== Indo-European languages ==

Many Indo-European languages feature fusional morphology, including:
* Balto-Slavic languages, e.g. Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, and the South Slavic languages (with the exception of Bulgarian and Macedonian, which are partially analytic)
* Indo-Iranian languages, e.g. Sanskrit, Bengali, Hindi, Pashto, Persian, Kashmiri, Urdu, Punjabi
* Latin and the Romance languages, e.g. Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Romanian
* Celtic languages, e.g. Irish and Welsh
* Some Germanic languages, e.g. German, Faroese, and Icelandic
* Greek (Classical and Modern) and Albanian

== Semitic languages ==
Another notable group of fusional languages is the Semitic languages, including Hebrew, Arabic, and Amharic. These also often involve nonconcatenative morphology, in which a word root is often placed into templates denoting its function in a sentence. Arabic is especially notable for this, with the common example being the root &quot;k-t-b&quot; being placed into multiple different patterns.

== Caucasian languages ==
Northeast Caucasian languages are weakly fusional.

== Uralic languages ==
A limited degree of fusion is also found in many Uralic languages, like Hungarian, Estonian, Finnish, and the Sami languages, such as Skolt Sami, as they are primarily agglutinative.

== Outside Eurasia ==
=== Americas ===
Unusual for a Native North American language, Navajo is sometimes described as fusional because of its complex and inseparable verb morphology.

Some Amazonian languages such as Ayoreo have fusional morphology.

The Fuegian language Selk&#x27;nam has fusional elements. For example, both evidentiality and gender agreement are coded with a single suffix on the verb:

&lt;section begin=&quot;list-of-glossing-abbreviations&quot;/&gt;
CERT:certainty (evidential):evidentiality
&lt;section end=&quot;list-of-glossing-abbreviations&quot;/&gt;
=== Africa ===
Some Nilo-Saharan languages such as Lugbara are also considered fusional.

==Loss of fusionality==
Fusional languages generally tend to lose their inflection over the centuries, some much more quickly than others. Proto-Indo-European was fusional, but some of its descendants have shifted to a more analytic structure such as Modern English, Danish and Afrikaans or to agglutinative such as Persian and Armenian. 

Other descendants remain fusional, including Sanskrit, Ancient Greek, Lithuanian, Latvian, Slavic languages, as well as Latin and the Romance languages and certain Germanic languages.

==Gain of fusionality==
Some languages shift over time from agglutinative to fusional. 

For example, most Uralic languages are predominantly agglutinative, but Estonian is markedly evolving in the direction of a fusional language. On the other hand, Finnish, its close relative, exhibits fewer fusional traits and thereby has stayed closer to the mainstream Uralic type. However, Sámi languages, while also part of the Uralic family, have gained more fusionality than Finnish and Estonian since they involve consonant gradation but also vowel apophony.

==Fusional inflections==

Inflections in fusional languages tend to fall in two patterns, based on which part of speech they modify: declensions for nouns and adjectives, and conjugations for verbs.

===Declension===
One feature of many fusional languages is their systems of declensions in which nouns and adjectives have an affix attached to them that specifies grammatical case (their uses in the clause), number and grammatical gender. Pronouns may also alter their forms entirely to encode that information. 

Within a fusional language, there are usually more than one declension; Latin and Greek have five, and the Slavic languages have anywhere between three and seven. German has multiple declensions based on the vowel or consonant ending the word, though they tend to be more unpredictable.

However, many descendants of fusional languages tend to lose their case marking. In most Romance and Germanic languages, including Modern English (with the notable exceptions of German, Icelandic and Faroese), encoding for case is merely vestigial because it no longer encompasses nouns and adjectives but only pronouns.

Compare the Italian &quot;egli&quot; (masculine singular nominative), &quot;gli&quot; (masculine singular dative, or indirect object), &quot;lo&quot; (masculine singular accusative) and &quot;lui&quot; (also masculine singular accusative but emphatic and indirect case to be used with prepositions), corresponding to the single vestigial trio &quot;he, him, his&quot; in English.

===Conjugation===

Conjugation is the alteration of the form of a verb to encode information about some or all of grammatical mood, voice, tense, aspect, person, grammatical gender and number. In a fusional language, two or more of those pieces of information may be conveyed in a single morpheme, typically a suffix.

For example, in French, the verbal suffix depends on the mood, tense and aspect of the verb, as well as on the person and number (but not the gender) of its subject. That gives rise to typically 45 different single-word forms of the verb, each of which conveys some or all of the following:
*mood (indicative, subjunctive, conditional or imperative)
*tense (past, present or future)
*aspect (perfective or imperfective)
*person (first, second or third), and
*number (singular or plural). 

Changing any one of those pieces of information without changing the others requires the use of a different suffix, the key characteristic of fusionality.

English has two examples of conjugational fusion. The verbal suffix &quot;-s&quot; indicates a combination of present tense with both third-person and singularity of the associated subject, and the verbal suffix &quot;-ed&quot; used in a verb with no auxiliary verb conveys both non-progressive aspect and past tense.

<doc id="159836" wikidata="Q1945786" url="?curid=159836" title="Chinese Indonesians">
<text>Chinese Indonesians (), or simply Orang Tionghoa or Tionghoa, are Indonesians whose ancestors arrived from China at some stage in the last eight centuries. Chinese Indonesians are the fourth largest community of Overseas Chinese in the world after Thailand, Malaysia, and the United States.

Chinese people and their Indonesian descendants have lived in the Indonesian archipelago since at least the 13th century. Many came initially as sojourners (temporary residents), intending to return home in their old age. Some, however, stayed in the region as economic migrants. Their population grew rapidly during the colonial period when workers were contracted from their home provinces in Southern China.

Discrimination against Chinese Indonesians has occurred since the start of Dutch colonialism in the region, although government policies implemented since 1998 have attempted to redress this. Resentment of ethnic Chinese economic aptitude grew in the 1950s as Native Indonesian merchants felt they could not remain competitive. Under the Suharto government backed by the United States during the Cold War, systematic massacres against ethnic Chinese occurred in the name of &quot;anti-communism&quot;. Later, government action propagated the stereotype that ethnic Chinese-owned conglomerates were corrupt. Although the 1997 Asian financial crisis severely disrupted their business activities, reform of government policy and legislation removed most if not all political and social restrictions on Chinese Indonesians.

The development of local Chinese society and culture is based upon three pillars: clan associations, ethnic media and Chinese-language schools. These flourished during the period of Chinese nationalism in the final years of China&#x27;s Qing dynasty and through the Second Sino-Japanese War; however, differences in the objective of nationalist sentiments brought about a split in the population. One group supported political reforms in China, while others worked towards improved status in local politics. The New Order government (1967–1998) dismantled the pillars of ethnic Chinese identity in favor of assimilation policies as a solution to the so-called &quot;Chinese Problem&quot;.

The Chinese Indonesian population of Java accounts for nearly half of the group&#x27;s national population. They are generally more urbanized than Indonesia&#x27;s indigenous population but significant rural and agricultural communities still exist throughout the country. Declining fertility rates have resulted in an upward shift in the population pyramid, as the median age increases. Emigration has contributed to a shrinking population and communities have emerged in more industrialized nations in the second half of the 20th century. Some have participated in repatriation programs to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, while others emigrated to neighboring Singapore, Taiwan, and Western countries to escape anti-Chinese sentiment. Among the overseas residents, their identities are noticeably more Indonesian than Chinese.

== Classification ==
The term Chinese Indonesian has never been clearly defined, especially for the period before 1900. There was no Indonesian identity or nationality before the 20th century. The ethno-political category Han Chinese was also poorly defined before the rise of modern Chinese nationalism in the late 19th century. At its broadest, the term Chinese Indonesian is used to refer to anyone from, or having an ancestor from, the present-day territory of China and Taiwan. This usage is problematic because it conflates Han Chinese with other ethnic groups under Chinese rule. For instance, Admiral Zheng He (1371–1433), who led several Chinese maritime expeditions into Southeast Asia, was a Muslim from Yunnan and was not of Chinese ancestry, yet he is generally characterized as Chinese. This broad use is also problematic because it prioritizes a line of descent from China over all other lines and may conflict with an individual&#x27;s own self-identity. Many people who identify as Chinese Indonesian are of mixed Chinese and Indonesian descent. Indonesia&#x27;s 4th president Abdurrahman Wahid (1940–2009) is of Arab, Chinese, and Javanese ancestry.

Some narrower uses of the term focus on culture, defining as Chinese Indonesian those who choose to prioritize their Chinese ancestry, especially those who have Chinese names or follow aspects of Chinese religion or culture. Within this cultural definition, a distinction has commonly been made between &quot;peranakan&quot; and &quot;totok&quot; Chinese. Peranakan were generally said to have mixed Chinese and local ancestry and to have developed a hybrid culture that included elements from both Chinese and local cultures. &quot;Totoks&quot; were generally said to be first-generation migrants and to have retained a strong Chinese identity.

Other definitions focus on the succession of legal classifications that have separated Chinese from other inhabitants of the archipelago. Both the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch colonial government (from 1815) applied complex systems of ethnic classification to their subjects, based on religion, culture and place of origin. Chinese Indonesians were sometimes classified as Natives, sometimes as Chinese, sometimes as Foreign Orientals, a category that included Arabs, Indians and Siamese. After independence, the community was divided between those who accepted Indonesian citizenship and those who did not. Under the New Order of President Suharto, citizens of Chinese descent were formally classified as &quot;Indonesian citizens of foreign descent&quot; (&quot;Warga Negara Indonesia keturunan asing&quot;). In public discourse, they were distinguished from native Indonesians as non&quot;-pribumi&quot; (lit., non-native).

== History ==

=== Early interactions ===

The first recorded movement of people from China into Maritime Southeast Asia was the arrival of Mongol forces under Kublai Khan that culminated in the invasion of Java in 1293. Their intervention hastened the decline of the classical kingdoms such as Singhasari and precipitated the rise of the Majapahit empire.

Chinese Muslim traders from the eastern coast of China arrived at the coastal towns of Indonesia and Malaysia in the early 15th century. They were led by the mariner Zheng He, who commanded several expeditions to Southeast Asia between 1405 and 1430. In the book &quot;Yingya Shenglan,&quot; his translator Ma Huan documented the activities of the Chinese Muslims in the archipelago and the legacy left by Zheng He and his men. These traders settled along the northern coast of Java, but there is no documentation of their settlements beyond the 16th century. The Chinese Muslims were likely to have been absorbed into the majority Muslim population. Between 1450 and 1520, the Ming dynasty&#x27;s interest in southeastern Asia reached a low point and trade, both legal and illegal, rarely reached the archipelago. The Portuguese made no mention of any resident Chinese minority population when they arrived in Indonesia in the early 16th century. Trade from the north was re-established when China legalized private trade in 1567 through licensing 50 junks a year. Several years later silver began flowing into the region, from Japan, Mexico, and Europe, and trade flourished once again. Distinct Chinese colonies emerged in hundreds of ports throughout southeastern Asia, including the pepper port of Banten.
Some Chinese traders avoided Portuguese Malacca after it fell to the Portuguese in the 1511 Capture of Malacca. Many Chinese, however, cooperated with the Portuguese for the sake of trade. Some Chinese in Java assisted in Muslim attempts to reconquer the city using ships. The Javanese–Chinese participation in retaking Malacca was recorded in &quot;The Malay Annals of Semarang and Cerbon&quot;.

Han Chinese in Indonesia forbid parallel cousin marriage which Han culture bans. Hui Muslims marry parallel cousins.

=== Chinese in the archipelago under Dutch East India Company rule (1600–1799) ===


By the time the Dutch arrived in the early 17th century, major Chinese settlements existed along the north coast of Java. Most were traders and merchants, but they also practiced agriculture in inland areas. The Dutch contracted many of these immigrants as skilled artisans in the construction of Batavia (Jakarta) on the northwestern coast of Java. A recently created harbor was selected as the new headquarters of the Dutch East India Company (&quot;&quot;, VOC) in 1609 by Jan Pieterszoon Coen. It grew into a major hub for trade with China and India. Batavia became home to the largest Chinese community in the archipelago and remains so in the 21st century. Coen and other early governors-general promoted the entry of Chinese immigrants to new settlements &quot;for the benefit of those places and for the purpose of gathering spices like cloves, nutmeg, and mace&quot;. The port&#x27;s Chinese population of 300–400 in 1619 had grown to at least 10,000 by 1740. The VOC ruled migrant ethnic groups in Batavia using &#x27;officers&#x27; drawn from each community, usually with the title &quot;kapitan&quot; or &quot;majoor&quot;. These officers had a high degree of authority over their community and undertook negotiations between the community and VOC authorities. Dutch colonial rule saw the beginning of anti-Chinese policies, including killings and ghettoization.

Most of those who settled in the archipelago had already severed their ties with the mainland and welcomed favorable treatment and protection under the Dutch. Some became revenue farmers, middlemen within the corporate structure of the VOC, tasked with collecting export–import duties and managing the harvest of natural resources; although this was highly profitable, it earned the enmity of the &quot;pribumi&quot; population. Others worked as opium farmers. Following the 1740 Batavia massacre and ensuing war, in which the Chinese rebelled against the Dutch, the Dutch attempted to place a quota on the number of Chinese who could enter the Indies. Amoy was designated as the only immigration port to the archipelago, and ships were limited to a specified number of crew and passengers depending on size. This quota was adjusted at times to meet demand for overseas workers, such as in July 1802 when sugar mills near Batavia were in need of workers.

Han Chinese &quot;peranakan&quot; rebels and Javanese Muslims both fought against the Dutch in the Java war in 1741 while Madurese Muslims allied with the Dutch. The Javanese Susuhunan Pakubuwana II joined the Chinese against the Dutch while the Dutch relieved the Madurese prince of his allegiance to the Susuhunan.

Han Siong Kong founded the Han family of Lasem at this time.

Chinese who married local Javanese women and converted to Islam created a distinct Chinese Muslim &quot;peranakan&quot; community in Java. Chinese rarely had to convert to Islam to marry Javanese &quot;abangan&quot; women but a significant amount of their offspring did, and Batavian Muslims absorbed the Chinese Muslim community which was descended from converts. Adoption of Islam back then was a marker of &quot;peranakan&quot; status which it no longer means. The Semaran Adipati and the Jayaningrat families were of Chinese origin.

Dayak women were married by the first Chinese men to settle in Borneo and this was recorded in the Hailu by Xie Qinggao (1765-1822) who was a merchant. After growing their initial population through this they began marrying each other&#x27;s daughters.

Peranakan community formed from local women in Java, Batavia marrying Hokkien Chinese migrants and they followed Chinese folk religion. Pure blood totok Chinese dominated Semarang after swamping out Peranakan Chinese when migrating in the late 18th century. However they intermarried with Peranakans from Batavia. Han Siong Kong of the Han family of Lasem moved to Lasem in east Java, from his home of Zhangzhou in Fujian and his wife was not Chinese. Four of his sons married Peranakan women and one son of his married a Javanese woman and converted to Islam.

===Chinese in the archipelago under Dutch colonial rule to 1900===

When the VOC was nationalized on 31 December 1799, many freedoms the Chinese experienced under the corporation were eliminated by the Dutch government. Among them was the Chinese monopoly on the salt trade which had been granted by the VOC administration. An 1816 regulation introduced a requirement for the indigenous population and Chinese traveling within the territory to obtain a travel permit. Those who did not carry a permit faced arrest by security officers. The governor-general also introduced a resolution in 1825 which forbade foreign Asians in Java, such as Malays, Buginese and Chinese, from living within the same neighborhood as the native population. Following the costly Java War (1825–1830) the Dutch introduced a new agrarian and cultivation system that required farmers to &quot;yield up a portion of their fields and cultivate crops suitable for the European market&quot;. Compulsory cultivation restored the economy of the colony, but ended the system of revenue farms established under the VOC.

The Chinese were perceived as temporary residents and encountered difficulties in obtaining land rights. Europeans were prioritized in the choice of plantation areas, while colonial officials believed the remaining plots must be protected and preserved for the indigenous population. Short-term and renewable leases of varying lengths were later introduced as a temporary measure, but many Chinese remained on these lands upon expiration of their contracts and became squatters. At the beginning of the 20th century, the colonial government began to implement the &quot;Ethical Policy&quot; to protect the indigenous population, casting the Chinese as the &quot;foremost enemy of the natives&quot;. Under the new policy, the administration increased restrictions on Chinese economic activities, which they believed exploited the native population.

Powerful Chinese families were described as the &quot;cabang atas&quot; (lit., upper branch) of colonial society, forming influential bureaucratic and business dynasties, such as the Kwee family of Ciledug and the Tan family of Cirebon.

In western Borneo, the Chinese established their first major mining settlement in 1760. Ousting Dutch settlers and the local Malay princes, they joined into a new republic known as Lanfang, led by ethnic Hakka, Lo Fang Pak. By 1819, they came into conflict with the new Dutch government and were seen as incompatible with its objectives, yet indispensable for the development of the region. The Bangka–Belitung Islands also became examples of major settlements in rural areas. In 1851, 28 Chinese were recorded on the islands and by 1915, the population had risen to nearly 40,000 and fishing and tobacco industries had developed. Coolies brought into the region after the end of the 19th century were mostly hired from the Straits Settlements owing to recruiting obstacles that existed in China.

Lowland Chinese in 1904 sold Beaumont and Winchester rifles in Sumatra to Bataks who were attacking and fighting the Dutch.

=== Divided nationalism (1900–1949) ===
The Chinese revolutionary figure Sun Yat-sen visited southeast Asia in 1900, and, later that year, the socio-religious organization Tiong Hoa Hwe Koan (), also known as the Chinese Association, was founded. Their goal was to urge ethnic Chinese in the Indies to support the revolutionary movement in China. In its effort to build Chinese-speaking schools the association argued that the teaching of the English and Chinese languages should be prioritized over Dutch, to provide themselves with the means of taking, in the words of Phoa Keng Hek, &quot;a two or three-day voyage (Java–Singapore) into a wider world where they can move freely&quot; and overcome restrictions of their activities. Several years later, the Dutch authorities abandoned its segregation policies, abolished travel permits for the ethnic Chinese, and allowed them to freely move throughout the colony. The 1911 Xinhai Revolution and the 1912 founding of the Republic of China coincided with a growing Chinese–nationalist movement within the Indies.

Although there was no recognizable nationalist movement among the indigenous population until 1908, Dutch authorities feared that nationalist sentiments would spread with the growth of ethnically mixed associations, known as &quot;kongsi&quot;. In 1911, some Javanese members of the Kong Sing association in Surakarta broke away and clashed with the ethnic Chinese. This incident led to the creation of Sarekat Islam, the first organized popular nationalist movement in the Indies. Indigenous groups saw the Chinese nationalist sentiment as haughty, leading to mutual antagonism. The anti-Chinese sentiment spread throughout Java in 1918 and led to violent attacks orchestrated by members of Sarekat Islam on the ethnic Chinese in Kudus. Following this incident, the left-wing Chinese nationalist daily &quot;Sin Po&quot; called on both sides to work together to improve living conditions because it considered most ethnic Chinese, like most of the indigenous population, to be poor.
&quot;Sin Po&quot; first went into print in 1910 and began gaining momentum as the leading advocate of Chinese political nationalism in 1917. The ethnic Chinese who followed its stream of thought refused any involvement with local institutions and would only participate in politics relating to mainland China. A second stream was later formed by wealthy ethnic Chinese who received an education at Dutch-run schools. This Dutch-oriented group wished for increased participation in local politics, Dutch education for the ethnic Chinese, and the furthering of ethnic Chinese economic standing within the colonial economy. Championed by the Volksraad&#x27;s Chinese representatives, such as Hok Hoei Kan, Loa Sek Hie and Phoa Liong Gie, this movement gained momentum and reached its peak with the Chung Hwa Congress of 1927 and the 1928 formation of the &quot;Chung Hwa Hui&quot; party, which elected Kan as its president. The editor-in-chief of the &quot;Madjallah Panorama&quot; news magazine criticized &quot;Sin Po&quot; for misguiding the ethnic Chinese by pressuring them into a Chinese-nationalist stance.
In 1932, pro-Indonesian counterparts founded the &quot;&quot; to support absorption of the ethnic Chinese into the Javanese population and support the call for self-government of Indonesia. Members of this group were primarily . This division resurfaced at the end of the period of Japanese occupation (1942–1945). Under the occupation ethnic Chinese communities were attacked by Japanese forces, in part owing to suspicions that they contained sympathizers of the Kuomintang as a consequence of the Second Sino-Japanese War. When the Dutch returned, following the end of World War II, the chaos caused by advancing forces and retreating revolutionaries also saw radical Muslim groups attack ethnic Chinese communities.

As the Dutch implemented a war of attrition and scorch earth, they forced Chinese on Java to flee inland and the Dutch destroyed all important assets including Chinese factories and property. Local Indonesians joined in on the Dutch violence against the Chinese looting Chinese property and trying to attack Chinese. However, when the Japanese troops landed and seized control of Java from the Dutch, to people&#x27;s surprise, the Japanese forced the native Indonesians to stop looting and attacking Chinese and warned the Indonesians they would not tolerate anti-Chinese violence in Java. The Japanese viewed the Chinese in Java and their economic power specifically as important and vital to Japanese war effort so they did not physically harm the Chinese of Java with no execution or torture of Chinese taking place unlike in other places. There was no violent confrontation between Japanese and Chinese on Java, unlike in British Malaya. The Japanese also allowed Chinese of Java in the Federation of Overseas-Chinese Associations (&quot;Hua Chiao Tsung Hui&quot;) to form the Keibotai, their own armed Chinese defense corps for protection with Japanese military instructors training them how to shoot and use spears. The Chinese viewed this as important to defending themselves from local Indonesians. The majority of Chinese of Java did not die in the war. It was only after the war ended when Japanese control fell and then the native Indonesians again started attacks against the Chinese of Java when the Japanese were unable to protect them.

The Japanese recruited help from local collaborator police of all ethnicities to recruit Javanese girls as comfort women, with one account accusing Chinese recruiters of tricking a Javanese regent into sending good Javanese girls into prostitution for the Japanese in May 1942. In Bali, the Japanese sexually harassed Balinese women when they came and started forcing Balinese women into brothels for prostitution, with Balinese men and Chinese men used as recruiters for the Balinese women. All of the brothels in Bali were staffed by Balinese women. Eurasians, Indians, Chinese, Dutch, Menadonese, Bataks, Bugis, Dayaks, Javanese, Arabs and Malays were arrested and massacred in the Mandor affair.

Although revolutionary leaders were sympathetic toward the ethnic Chinese, they were unable to stop the sporadic violence. Those who were affected fled from the rural areas to Dutch-controlled cities, a move many Indonesians saw as proof of pro-Dutch sentiments. There was evidence, however, that Chinese Indonesians were represented and participated in independence efforts. Four members of the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (BPUPK) were Chinese: Liem Koen Hian, Oey Tiang Tjoei, Oey Tjong Hauw and Tan Eng Hoa. Yap Tjwan Bing was the sole Chinese member of the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI). Ong Eng Die became a government minister in the Indonesian Republic. Other examples include Kwee Thiam Hiong member of , Abubakar Tjan Kok Tjiang and Thung Tjing Ek (Jakub Thung) exploits in Kaimana and Serui respectively, BPRT (&quot;Barisan Pemberontak Rakjat Tionghoa&quot;) which was founded in Surakarta on 4 January 1946, LTI (&quot;Lasjkar Tionghoa Indonesia&quot;) in Pemalang, and in Kudus Chinese descents became members of Muria Territorial Command called &quot;Matjan Poetih&quot; troops, a platoon size force under Mayor Kusmanto.

=== Loyalty in question (1950–1966) ===

The Netherlands relinquished its territorial claims in the archipelago (with the exception of West Papua) following the 1949 Round Table Conference. In the same year that the Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan, allowing the Chinese Communist Party to take control of mainland China. Most Chinese Indonesians considered a communist China less attractive than a newly independent Indonesia, but in the archipelago their loyalties were questioned. Ethnic Chinese born in the Dutch East Indies whose parents were domiciled under Dutch administration were regarded as citizens of the new state according to the principle of &quot;jus soli&quot; (lit., right of the soil). However, Chinese law considered a person as a Chinese citizen according to the principle of &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; (lit., right of blood). This meant that all Indonesian citizens of Chinese descent were also claimed as citizens by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. After several attempts by both governments to resolve this issue, Indonesia and China signed a Dual Nationality Treaty on the sidelines of the 1955 Asian–African Conference in Bandung. One of its provisions permitted Indonesians to renounce Chinese citizenship if they wished to hold Indonesian citizenship only.

As many as 390,000 ethnic Chinese, two-thirds of those with rightful claims to Indonesian citizenship, renounced their Chinese status when the treaty came into effect in 1962. On the other hand, an estimated 60,000 ethnic Chinese students left for the People&#x27;s Republic of China in the 1950s and early 1960s. The first wave of students were almost entirely educated in Chinese-language schools, but were not able to find opportunities for tertiary education in Indonesia. Seeking quality scientific professions, they entered China with high hopes for their future and that of the mainland. Subsequent migrations occurred in 1960 as part of a repatriation program and in 1965–1966 following a series of anti-communist violence that also drew anger toward the ethnic Chinese. As many as 80% of the original students who entered the mainland eventually became refugees in Hong Kong. During China&#x27;s Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), Red Guards questioned the loyalty of the returned overseas Chinese because of their foreign connections. They were attacked as &quot;imperialists&quot;, &quot;capitalists&quot;, &quot;spies&quot;, &quot;half-breeds&quot;, and &quot;foreign devils&quot;.As most had grown up in an urban environment they were sent to the countryside, told to &quot;rebel against their own class background&quot;, and eventually lost contact with their families.

In 1959, following the introduction of soft-authoritarian rule through Guided Democracy, the Indonesian government and military began placing restrictions on alien residence and trade. These regulations culminated in the enactment of Presidential Regulation 10 in November 1959, banning retail services by non-indigenous persons in rural areas. Ethnic Chinese, Arab, and Dutch businessmen were specifically targeted during its enforcement to provide a more favorable market for indigenous businesses. This move was met with protests from the Chinese government and some circles of Indonesian society. Javanese writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer later criticized the policies in his 1961 book &quot;Hoakiau di Indonesia&quot;. An integrationist movement, led by the Chinese-Indonesian organisation Baperki (&quot;&quot;), began to gather interest in 1963, including that of President Sukarno. However, a series of attacks on ethnic Chinese communities in West Java in May proved it to be short-lived, despite the government&#x27;s condemnation of the violence. When Baperki was branded a communist organization in 1965 the ethnic Chinese were implicated by association; this was exacerbated in the public mind by the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s communism. As many as 500,000 people, the majority of them Javanese Abangan Muslims and Balinese Indonesians but including a minority of several thousand ethnic Chinese, were killed in the anti-communist purge which followed the failed coup d&#x27;état, suspected as being communist-led, on 30 September 1965.

Dayaks were tricked by the Indonesian military into attacking Chinese. The land the Chinese fled from was not taken by Dayaks but by Madurese settlers, who were later massacred by the Dayaks. Dayaks and Malays killed and raped Madurese throughout 1996, 1997, 1999 and 2001.

=== Managing the &quot;Chinese Problem&quot; (1967–1998) ===
When the New Order government of General Suharto came into power in 1966–1967, it introduced a political system based only on the Pancasila (five principles) ideology. To prevent the ideological battles that occurred during Sukarno&#x27;s presidency from resurfacing, Suharto&#x27;s Pancasila democracy sought a depoliticized system in which discussions of forming a cohesive ethnic Chinese identity were no longer allowed. A government committee was formed in 1967 to examine various aspects of the &quot;Chinese Problem&quot; (&#x27;) and agreed that forced emigration of whole communities was not a solution: &quot;The challenge was to take advantage of their economic aptitude whilst eliminating their perceived economic dominance.&quot; The semi-governmental Institute for the Promotion of National Unity (&#x27;, LPKB) was formed to advise the government on facilitating assimilation of Chinese Indonesians. This process was done through highlighting the differences between the ethnic Chinese and the indigenous &quot;pribumi&quot;, rather than seeking similarities. Expressions of Chinese culture through language, religion, and traditional festivals were banned and the ethnic Chinese were pressured to adopt Indonesian-sounding names.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Suharto and his government brought in Chinese Indonesian businesses to participate in the economic development programs of the New Order while keeping them highly vulnerable to strengthen the central authority and restrict political freedoms. Patron–client relationships, mainly through the exchange of money for security, became an accepted norm among the ethnic Chinese as they maintained a social contract through which they could claim a sense of belonging in the country. A minority of the economic elite of Indonesian society, both those who were and were not ethnic Chinese, secured relationships with Suharto&#x27;s family members and members of the military for protection, while small business owners relied on local law enforcement officials. Stereotypes of the wealthy minority became accepted as generalized facts but failed to acknowledge that said businessmen were few in number compared to the small traders and shop owners. In a 1989 interview conducted by scholar Adam Schwarz for his book &quot;A Nation in Waiting: Indonesia&#x27;s Search for Stability&quot;, an interviewee stated that, &quot;to most Indonesians, the word &#x27;Chinese&#x27; is synonymous with corruption&quot;. The economic role of the ethnic Chinese was contradictory because it did not translate to acceptance of their status in the greater society. They were politically weak and often faced social harassment.

In 1973, native Indonesian anger against Japan was boiling over, over predatory Japanese investment and economic policy that was described as colonialism. Native Indonesians hated Japanese businessmen for discriminating against native Indonesians and treating them badly while the Japanese favored Chinese Indonesian business partners over native Indonesians due to their experience, contacts and skills. The Japanese used Southeast Asians like native Indonesians for cheap labour and natural resources to make money while the natives lived on subsistence. Indonesians engaged in violent anti-Japanese protests in January 1974 when Japan&#x27;s Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka came to Jakarta to visit Suharto.
Anti-Chinese sentiment gathered intensity through the 1990s. President Suharto gathered the most powerful businessmen—mostly Chinese Indonesians—in a nationally televised 1990 meeting at his private ranch, calling on them to contribute 25% of their shares to cooperatives. Commentators described the spectacle as &quot;good theatre&quot;, as it only served to reinforce resentment and suspicion of the ethnic Chinese among the indigenous population. Major riots broke out in Situbondo (October 1996), Tasikmalaya (December 1996), and Rengasdengklok (January 1997).

When Suharto entered his seventh term as president, following an uncontested election on 10 March 1998, Indonesian students began a series of major demonstrations in protest of the New Order regime which continued for weeks and culminated in the shootings of four students by security forces at Trisakti University in May. The incident sparked major violence in several cities during 12–15 May. Property and businesses owned by Chinese Indonesians were targeted by mobs, and over 100 women were sexually assaulted; this aspect of the riots, though generally accepted as true, has been denied by several Indonesian groups. In the absence of security forces, large groups of men, women, and children looted and burned the numerous shopping malls in major cities. In Jakarta and Surakarta over 1,000 people—both Chinese and non-Chinese—died inside shopping malls. Tens of thousands of ethnic Chinese fled the country following these events, and bankers estimated that US$20 billion of capital had left the country in 1997–1999 to overseas destinations such as Singapore, Hong Kong, and the United States.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s during the fall of Suharto there was mass ethnic violence with Catholic Dayaks and Malays in west Borneo killing the state sponsored Madurese settlers. The Malays and Madurese were both Muslims but the Malays declared the Madurese as apostates to justify the killings. The local Chinese in western Borneo supported the Dayaks and Malays in their anti-Madurese killings. One Dayak during the riot expressed his hatred of the Madurese while he had a Chinese married to his sister which he liked.

=== Social policy reforms (1999–present) ===
Suharto resigned on 21 May 1998, one week after he returned from a Group of 15 meeting in Cairo, which took place during the riots. The reform government formed by his successor Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie began a campaign to rebuild the confidence of Chinese Indonesians who had fled the country, particularly businessmen. Along with one of his envoys James Riady, son of financial magnate Mochtar Riady, Habibie appealed to Chinese Indonesians seeking refuge throughout East Asia, Australia, and North America to return and promised security from various government ministries as well as other political figures, such as Abdurrahman Wahid and Amien Rais. Despite Habibie&#x27;s efforts he was met with skepticism because of remarks he made, as vice president and as president, which suggested that the message was insincere. One special envoy described Chinese Indonesians as the key to restoring badly needed capital and economic activity, prioritizing businessmen as the target of their pleas. Others, including economist Kwik Kian Gie, saw the government&#x27;s efforts as perpetuating the myth of Chinese economic domination rather than affirming the ethnic Chinese identity.

Symbolic reforms to Chinese Indonesian rights under Habibie&#x27;s administration were made through two presidential instructions. The first abolished the use of the terms &quot;pribumi&quot; and non-&quot;pribumi&quot; in official government documents and business. The second abolished the ban on the study of Mandarin Chinese and reaffirmed a 1996 instruction that abolished the use of the SBKRI to identify citizens of Chinese descent. Habibie established a task force to investigate the May 1998 violence, although his government later dismissed its findings. As an additional legal gesture Indonesia ratified the 1965 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination on 25 May 1999. In 2000 the newly elected President Wahid abolished the ban on public displays of Chinese culture and allowed Chinese traditions to be practised freely, without the need of a permit. Two years later President Megawati Sukarnoputri declared that the Chinese New Year (&quot;&quot;) would be marked as a national holiday from 2003. Moreover, during President Wahid&#x27;s presidency, the Indonesian Government initiated the first National Chinese New Year Celebration (&quot;Perayaan Imlek Nasional&quot;). Since then, the National Chinese New Year Celebration has been held annually, attended by the President of Indonesia and related officials. Currently, the Supreme Council for the Confucian Religion in Indonesia is the organizer of the event. 

Furthermore, in addition to President Habibie&#x27;s directive on the term &quot;pribumi&quot;, the legislature passed a new citizenship law in 2006 defining the word &quot;&quot; (lit., indigenous) in the Constitution as a natural born person, allowing Chinese Indonesians to be eligible to run for president. The law further stipulates that children of foreigners born in Indonesia are eligible to apply for Indonesian citizenship.

The post-Suharto era saw the end of discriminatory policy against Chinese Indonesians. Since then, numbers of Chinese Indonesians began to take part in the nation&#x27;s politics, government and administrative sector. The Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono presidency (2004–2014) saw the first female Chinese Indonesian minister Mari Elka Pangestu as Minister of Trade (2004-2011) and Minister of Tourism and Creative Economy (2011-2014). Another notable Chinese Indonesian in Indonesian politics is Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, former Regent of East Belitung (2005–2006) and first governor of Jakarta (2014–2017) of Chinese descent.

However, discrimination and prejudice against Chinese Indonesians continues in the 21st century. On 15 March 2016, Indonesian Army General Suryo Prabowo commented that the incumbent governor of Jakarta, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, should &quot;know his place lest the Indonesian Chinese face the consequences of his action&quot;. This controversial comment was considered to hearken back to previous violence against the Indonesian Chinese. On 9 May 2017, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama was sentenced to two years in prison after being found guilty of committing a criminal act of blasphemy, a move that was widely criticized by many as an attack on free speech.

== Origins ==
Chinese immigrants to the Indonesian archipelago almost entirely originated from various ethnic groups especially the Tanka people of what are now the Fujian and Guangdong provinces in southern China, areas known for their regional diversity. Nearly all Chinese Indonesians are either patrilineal descendants of these early immigrants or new immigrants born in mainland China.
The first group of Chinese people to settle in large numbers to escape the coastal ban were the most affected Tanka boat people, other came in much smaller numbers, Teochews from Chaozhou, the Hakkas from Chengxiang county (now Meixian), Huizhou (pronounced Fuizhew in Hakka) and rural county of Dabu (pronounced Thaipo in Hakka), the Cantonese from Guangdong and various different ethnic dialect groups who left the trading city ports of southern Fujian including the ethnic Tanka, Hakkas, etc. Descendants of Hokkien Tanka are the dominant group in eastern Indonesia, Central and East Java and the western coast of Sumatra. Teochews, southern neighbors of the Hokkien, are found throughout the eastern coast of Sumatra, in the Riau Archipelago, and in western Borneo. They were preferred as plantation laborers in Sumatra but have become traders in regions where the Hokkien are not well represented.

From 1628 to 1740, there were more 100,000 Hakkas from Huizhou living in Batavia and Java island.

The Hakka, unlike the Hokkien and the Teochew, originate from the mountainous inland regions of Guangdong and do not have a maritime culture. Owing to the unproductive terrain of their home region, the Hakka emigrated out of economic necessity in several waves from 1850 to 1930 and were the poorest of the Chinese immigrant groups. Although they initially populated the mining centers of western Borneo and Bangka Island, Hakkas became attracted to the rapid growth of Batavia and West Java in the late 19th century.

The Cantonese people, like the Hakka, were well known throughout Southeast Asia as mineworkers. Their migration in the 19th century was largely directed toward the tin mines of Bangka, off the east coast of Sumatra. Notable traditionally as skilled artisans, the Cantonese benefited from close contact with Europeans in Guangdong and Hong Kong by learning about machinery and industrial success. They migrated to Java about the same time as the Hakka but for different reasons. In Indonesia&#x27;s cities, they became artisans, machine workers, and owners of small businesses such as restaurants and hotel-keeping services. The Cantonese are evenly dispersed throughout the archipelago and number far less than the Hokkien or the Hakka. Consequently, their roles are of secondary importance in the Chinese communities.
== Demographics ==
Indonesia&#x27;s 2000 census reported 2,411,503 citizens (1.20% of the total population) as ethnic Chinese. An additional 93,717 (0.05%) ethnic Chinese living in Indonesia were reported as foreign citizens, mostly those of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Republic of China, who may not be able to pay the cost of becoming an Indonesian citizen. Because the census employed the method of self-identification, those who refused to identify themselves as ethnic Chinese, or had assumed the identity of other ethnic groups, either because of assimilation or mixed-parentage, or fear of persecution, were recorded as non-Chinese. It is also likely that there are around 2.8 million Chinese living in Indonesia according to several external estimates.

Past estimates on the exact number of Chinese Indonesians relied on the 1930 Dutch East Indies census, which collected direct information on ethnicity. This census reported 1.23 million self-identified ethnic Chinese living in the colony, representing 2.03% of the total population, and was perceived to be an accurate account of the group&#x27;s population. Ethnic information would not be collected again until the 2000 census and so was deduced from other census data, such as language spoken and religious affiliation, during the intermediate years. In an early survey of the Chinese Indonesian minority, anthropologist G. William Skinner estimated that between 2.3 million (2.4%) and 2.6 million (2.7%) lived in Indonesia in 1961. Former foreign minister Adam Malik provided a figure of 5 million in a report published in the &quot;Harian Indonesia&quot; daily in 1973. Many media and academic sources subsequently estimated between 4 and 5% of the total population as ethnic Chinese regardless of the year. Estimates during the 2000s have placed the figure between 6 and 7 million, and the Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission of the Republic of China estimated a population as high as 7.67 million in 2006.

According to 2010 population census, 22.3% of Chinese Indonesians lived in the capital city of Jakarta, located on the island of Java. When the island&#x27;s other provinces—Banten, West Java, Central Java, Yogyakarta, and East Java—are included, this population accounted for around half (51.8%) of all Chinese Indonesians. This data does not count the number of ethnic Chinese that have foreign citizenship. 8.15% of West Kalimantan&#x27;s population is ethnic Chinese, followed by Bangka–Belitung Islands (8.14%), Riau Islands (7.66%), Jakarta (6.58%), North Sumatra (5,75%), Riau (1.84%). In each of the remaining provinces, Chinese Indonesians account for 1% or less of the provincial population. Most Chinese Indonesians in North Sumatra lived in the provincial capital of Medan; they are one of major ethnic groups in the city with the Bataks and Javanese people, but in the province, they constituted only a small percentage because of the relatively large population of the province, the sizeable Chinese population also has presence in Binjai, Tanjungbalai and Pematangsiantar city. Bangka–Belitung, West Kalimantan, and Riau are grouped around the hub of ethnic Chinese economic activity in Singapore and, with the exception of Bangka–Belitung, these settlements existed long before Singapore&#x27;s founding in 1819.

The ethnic Chinese population in Indonesia grew by an average of 4.3% annually between 1920 and 1930. It then slowed owing to the effects of the Great Depression and many areas experienced a net emigration. Falling growth rates were also attributed to a significant decrease in the number of Chinese immigrants admitted into Indonesia since the 1950s. The population is relatively old according to the 2000 census, having the lowest percentage of population under 14 years old nationwide and the second-highest percentage of population over 65. Their population pyramid had a narrow base with a rapid increase until the 15–19 age group, indicating a rapid decline in total fertility rates. This was evidenced by a decline in the absolute number of births since 1980. In Jakarta and West Java the population peak occurred in the 20–24 age group, indicating that the decline in fertility rates began as early as 1975. The upper portion of the pyramid exhibited a smooth decline with increasing population age. It is estimated that 60.7% of the Chinese Indonesian population in 2000 constitutes the generation that experienced political and social pressures under the New Order government. With an average life expectancy of 75 years, those who spent their formative years prior to this regime will completely disappear by 2032.

According to the last 2010 population census, the self-identified Chinese Indonesian population is 2,832,510. There is a growth of 17.5% from 2000 census, although some of them are because the census bureau improved its counting methodology between 2000 and 2010. During the 2000 census, it only published data for the eight largest ethnic groups in each province. Because Chinese Indonesians in some provinces did not have a large enough population, they were left off the list. This error was only corrected in 2008 when Aris Ananta, Evi Nuridya Arifin, and Bakhtiar from the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore published a report that accounted for all Chinese Indonesian populations using raw data from BPS.

=== Emigrant communities ===
Emigration by Chinese Indonesians became significant after Indonesian independence in 1945. Large numbers of Chinese Indonesians repatriated to China, Taiwan and Hong Kong throughout the following years, while others moved to more industrialized regions around the world.

Although these migrants have Chinese ancestry, they were often not identified as such; this trend has continued into the modern day. In a scientific research article, Kusuma mentioned the cultural development and life philosophy of the descendants of modern immigrant Hakka people in &quot;The History of Hakka Diaspora in Indonesia: Migration Waves and Negotiations with National Identity.&quot;, saying the concept of &quot;Hakka Heart&quot; emphasizes the Chinese identity of Hakkas and other ethnic groups within the framework of Indonesian nationalism. There have been several independent estimates made of the Chinese Indonesian population living in other countries. James Jupp&#x27;s &quot;The Australian People&quot; encyclopedia estimated that half of over 30,000 Indonesians living in Australia in the late 1990s are ethnic Chinese, and they have since merged with other Chinese communities. In New Zealand, many migrants reside in the suburbs of Auckland after some 1,500 sought asylum from the 1998 upheaval, of which two-thirds were granted residency.

Australian scholar Charles Coppel believes Chinese Indonesian migrants also constitute a large majority of returned overseas Chinese living in Hong Kong. Though it is impossible to accurately count this number, news sources have provided estimates ranging from 100,000 to 150,000, while the estimate of 150,000 was published in the &quot;Hong Kong Standard&quot; on 21 December 1984. .

Of the 57,000 Indonesians living in the United States in 2000, one-third were estimated to be ethnic Chinese. Locally knowledgeable migrants in Southern California estimate that 60% of Indonesian Americans living in the area are of Chinese descent. In Canada, only a minority of the emigrant Chinese Indonesian community speak Chinese. Although families are interested in rediscovering their ethnic traditions, their Canadian-born children are often reluctant to learn either Chinese mother tongue.

== Society ==


Scholars who study Chinese Indonesians often distinguish members of the group according to their racial and sociocultural background: the &quot;totok&quot; and the &quot;peranakan&quot;. The two terms were initially used to racially distinguish the pure-blooded Chinese from those with mixed ancestry. A secondary meaning to the terms later arose that meant the &quot;totok&quot; were born in China and anyone born in Indonesia was considered &quot;peranakan&quot;. Segmentation within &quot;totok&quot; communities occurs through division in speech groups, a pattern that has become less apparent since the turn of the 20th century. Among the indigenized &quot;peranakan&quot; segmentation occurs through social class, which is graded according to education and family standing rather than wealth.

=== Gender and kinship ===
Kinship structure in the &quot;totok&quot; community follows the patrilineal, patrilocal, and patriarchal traditions of Chinese society, a practice which has lost emphasis in &quot;peranakan&quot; familial relationships. Instead, kinship patterns in indigenized families have incorporated elements of matrilocal, matrilineal, and matrifocal traditions found in Javanese society. Within this community, both sons and daughters can inherit the family fortune, including ancestral tablets and ashes. Political, social, and economic authority in &quot;peranakan&quot; families is more evenly distributed between the two genders than in &quot;totok&quot; families. Kin terms do not distinguish between maternal and paternal relatives and polygyny is strongly frowned upon. Western influence in &quot;peranakan&quot; society is evidenced by the high proportion of childless couples. Those who did have children also had fewer of them than &quot;totok&quot; couples.

Despite their break from traditional kinship patterns, &quot;peranakan&quot; families are closer to some traditional Chinese values than the &quot;totok&quot;. Because the indigenized population have lost much of the connection to their ancestral homes in the coastal provinces of China, they are less affected by the 20th-century modernization patterns that transformed the region. The &quot;peranakan&quot; have a stricter attitude toward divorce, though the separation rates among families in both segments are generally lower than other ethnic groups. Arranged marriages are more common in &quot;peranakan&quot; families, whose relationships tend to be more nepotistic. Secularization among the &quot;totok&quot; meant that their counterparts carry out ancestral rituals to a higher degree, and &quot;peranakan&quot; youth tend to be more religious. Through education provided by high-quality Catholic and Protestant schools, these youth are much more likely to convert to Christianity.

In the 21st century, the conceptual differences of &quot;totok&quot; and &quot;peranakan&quot; Chinese are slowly becoming outdated as some families show a mixture of characteristics from both cultures. Interracial marriage and cultural assimilation often prevent the formation a precise definition of Chinese Indonesians in line with any simple racial criterion. Use of a Chinese surname, in some form or circumstance, is generally a sign of cultural self-identification as ethnic Chinese or alignment with a Chinese social system.

===Identity===
Ethnic Chinese in the 1930 Dutch East Indies census were categorized as foreign orientals, which led to separate registration. Citizenship was conferred upon the ethnic Chinese through a 1946 citizenship act after Indonesia became independent, and it was further reaffirmed in 1949 and 1958. However, they often encountered obstacles regarding the legality of their citizenship. Chinese Indonesians were required to produce an Indonesian Citizenship Certificate (&#x27;, SBKRI) when conducting business with government officials. Without the SBKRI, they were not able to make passports and identity cards (&#x27;, KTP); register birth, death, and marriage certificates; or register a business license. The requirement for its use was abolished in 1996 through a presidential instruction which was reaffirmed in 1999, but media sources reported that local authorities were still demanding the SBKRI from Chinese Indonesians after the instructions went into effect.

Other terms used for identifying sectors of the community include &#x27; and &#x27;. The former, traditionally used to describe those born locally, is derived from the root Indonesian word &quot;&quot; (lit., child) and thus means &quot;child of the land&quot;. The latter is derived from Javanese, meaning new or pure, and is used to describe the foreign born and new immigrants. A significant number of Chinese Indonesians also live in the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Hong Kong; they are considered part of the population of &quot;returned overseas Chinese&quot; (). To identify the varying sectors of Chinese Indonesian society, Tan contends they must be differentiated according to nationality into those who are citizens of the host country and those who are resident aliens, then further broken down according to their cultural orientation and social identification. In her doctoral dissertation, Aimee Dawis notes that such definitions, based on cultural affinity and not nation of origin, have gained currency since the early 1990s, although the old definition is occasionally used.

Sociologist Mely G. Tan asserts that scholars studying ethnic Chinese emigrants often refer to the group as a &quot;monolithic entity&quot;: the overseas Chinese. Such treatment also persists in Indonesia; a majority of the population referred to them as &#x27; or &#x27; (both meaning &quot;Chinese people&quot;, ), or &quot;&quot; (). They were previously described in ethnographic literature as the Indonesian Chinese, but there has been a shift in terminology as the old description emphasizes the group&#x27;s Chinese origins, while the more recent one, its Indonesian integration. Aimee Dawis, citing prominent scholar Leo Suryadinata, believes the shift is &quot;necessary to debunk the stereotype that they are an exclusive group&quot; and also &quot;promotes a sense of nationalism&quot; among them.

=== Economic aptitude ===
Members of the &quot;totok&quot; community are more inclined to be entrepreneurs and adhere to the practice of &quot;guanxi&quot;, which is based on the idea that one&#x27;s existence is influenced by the connection to others, implying the importance of business connections. In the first decade following Indonesian independence their business standing strengthened after being limited to small businesses in the colonial period. By the 1950s virtually all retail stores in Indonesia were owned by ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs, whose businesses ranged from selling groceries to construction material. Discontentment soon grew among indigenous merchants who felt unable to compete with ethnic Chinese businesses. Under pressure from indigenous merchants, the government enacted the Benteng program and Presidential Regulation 10 of 1959, which imposed restrictions on ethnic Chinese importers and rural retailers. Ethnic Chinese businesses persisted, owing to their integration into larger networks throughout Southeast Asia, and their dominance continued despite continuous state and private efforts to encourage the growth of indigenous capital. Indonesian Chinese businesses are part of the larger bamboo network, a network of overseas Chinese businesses operating in the markets of Southeast Asia that share common family and cultural ties.

Government policies shifted dramatically after 1965, becoming more favorable to economic expansion. In an effort to rehabilitate the economy, the government turned to those who possessed the capability to invest and expand corporate activity. Ethnic Chinese capitalists, called the &quot;&quot;, were supported by the military, which emerged as the dominant political force after 1965. Indigenous businessmen once again demanded greater investment support from the government in the 1970s, but legislative efforts failed to reduce ethnic Chinese dominance. In a 1995 study published by the East Asia Analytical Unit of Australia&#x27;s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, approximately 73% of the market capitalization value of publicly listed companies (excluding foreign and state-owned companies) were owned by Chinese Indonesians. Additionally, they owned 68 percent of the top 300 conglomerates and nine of the top ten private sector groups at the end of 1993. This figure propagated the general belief that ethnic Chinese—then estimated at 3% of the population—controlled 70% of the economy. Although the accuracy of this figure was disputed, it was evident that a wealth disparity existed along ethnic boundaries. The image of an economically powerful ethnic Chinese community was further fostered by the government through its inability to dissociate itself from the patronage networks. The Hokchia group dominated the ethnic Chinese business scene during the Suharto government, although other groups emerged after 1998.

The top five conglomerates in Indonesia prior to the 1997 Asian financial crisis—the Salim Group, Astra International, the Sinar Mas Group, Gudang Garam, Sampoerna and the Lippo Group—were all owned by ethnic Chinese, with annual sales totaling Rp112 trillion (US$47 billion). When the crisis finally hit the country, the rupiah&#x27;s plunge severely disrupted corporate operations. Numerous conglomerates lost a majority of their assets and collapsed. Over the next several years, other conglomerates struggled to repay international and domestic debts. Reforms introduced following 1998 were meant to steer the economy away from oligarchic arrangements established under the New Order; however, plans for reform proved too optimistic. When President B. J. Habibie announced in a 19 July 1998 interview with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that Indonesia was not dependent on ethnic Chinese businessmen, the rupiah&#x27;s value plunged 5%. This unexpected reaction prompted immediate changes in policies, and Habibie soon began enticing conglomerates for their support in the reform plans. Most were initially fearful of democratization, but the process of social demarginalization meant that the ethnic Chinese were regarded as equal members of society for the first time in the nation&#x27;s history. Increased regional autonomy allowed surviving conglomerates to explore new opportunities in the outer provinces, and economic reforms created a freer market.

=== Political activity ===
Between the 18th and early 20th centuries, ethnic Chinese communities were dominated by the &quot;peranakan&quot; presence. This period was followed by the growth of &quot;totok&quot; society. As part of a resinicization effort by the indigenized ethnic Chinese community, a new pan-Chinese movement emerged with the goal of a unified Chinese political identity. The movement later split in the 1920s when &quot;peranakan&quot; elites resisted the leadership of the &quot;totok&quot; in the nationalist movement, and the two groups developed their own objectives. When it became apparent that unification was being achieved on &quot;totok&quot; terms, &quot;peranakan&quot; leaders chose to align their community with the Dutch, who had abandoned the segregation policies in 1908. The two communities once again found common ground in opposition to the invading Japanese when the occupying forces treated all Chinese groups with contempt.

The issue of nationality, following independence, politicized the ethnic Chinese and led to the formation of Baperki in 1954, as the first and largest Chinese Indonesian mass organization. Baperki and its majority &quot;peranakan&quot; membership led the opposition against a draft law that would have restricted the number of ethnic Chinese who could gain Indonesian citizenship. This movement was met by the Islamic Masyumi Party in 1956 when it called for the implementation of affirmative action for indigenous businesses. During the 1955 legislative election, Baperki received 178,887 votes and gained a seat on the People&#x27;s Representative Council (DPR). Later that year, two Baperki candidates were also elected to the Constitutional Assembly.

Ethnic-based political parties were banned under the government of President Suharto, leaving only the three indigenous-dominated parties of Golkar, the United Development Party (PPP), and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI). The depoliticizing of Indonesian society confined ethnic Chinese activities to the economic sector. Chinese Indonesian critics of the regime were mostly &quot;peranakan&quot; and projected themselves as Indonesians, leaving the ethnic Chinese with no visible leaders. On the eve of the 1999 legislative election, after Suharto&#x27;s resignation, the news magazine &quot;Tempo&quot; conducted a survey of likely Chinese Indonesian voters on their political party of choice for the election. Although respondents were able to choose more than one party, 70% favored the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (&quot;Partai Demokrasi Indonesia Perjuangan&quot;, PDIP), whose image of a nationalist party was considered favorable toward the ethnic Chinese. The party also benefited from the presence of economist Kwik Kian Gie, who was well respected by both ethnic Chinese and non-ethnic-Chinese voters.

New ethnic political parties such as the Chinese Indonesian Reform Party (&#x27;, PARTI) and the Indonesian Bhinneka Tunggal Ika Party (&#x27;, PBI) failed to garner much support in the 1999 election. Despite this result, the number of Chinese Indonesian candidates standing in national election increased from fewer than 50 in 1999 to almost 150 in 2004. Of the 58 candidates of Chinese descent who ran for office as representatives from Jakarta in the 2009 legislative election, two won seats.

== Culture ==
=== Language ===
Four major Chinese-speech groups are represented in Indonesia: Hokkien (Southern Min; Min Nan), Hainanese, Hakka and Cantonese. In addition to these, the Teochew people speak their own dialect that has some degree of mutual intelligibility with Hokkien. Distinctions between the two, however, are accentuated outside of their regions of origin. There were an estimated 2.2 million native speakers of various Chinese varieties in Indonesia in 1982: 1,300,000 speakers of Southern Min varieties (including Hokkien and Teochew); 640,000 Hakka speakers; 460,000 Hainanese speakers; 180,000 Cantonese speakers; and 20,000 speakers of the Eastern Min varieties (including Fuzhou dialect). Additionally, an estimated 20,000 spoke different dialects of the Indonesian language.
Many of the Chinese living in capital city Jakarta and other towns located in Java are not fluent in Chinese languages, due to New Order&#x27;s banning of Chinese languages, but those who are living in non-Java cities especially in Sumatra, Sulawesi, Maluku as well as Kalimantan can speak Chinese and its dialects fluently. The Chinese along the North-Eastern coast of Sumatra, especially in Riau Islands, North Sumatra, Riau and Jambi are predominantly Hokkien (Min Nan) speakers, with populations also primarily found in West Sumatra especially the Minangkabau heartland of Padang, and there are also two different variants of Hokkien being used, such as Medan Hokkien, which is based on the Zhangzhou dialect and Riau Hokkien, which is based on the Quanzhou dialect. There are also Hokkien speakers in Java (Semarang, Surakarta, etc.), Sulawesi, particularly in Kendari of Southeast Sulawesi province, Bengkulu, Denpasar, Bali, Palembang, South Sumatra, Ambon, Manado and Makassar as well as Kalimantan (Borneo), particularly in East Kalimantan (Kutai Kartanegara Regency and the provincial capital of Samarinda). Meanwhile, the Hakkas are the majority dialect group in Aceh, Bangka-Belitung, Ambon of Maluku province, Palembang in South Sumatra and the northern region of West Kalimantan such as Singkawang, Pemangkat and Mempawah, several Hakka communities also live in parts of Java island especially in Tangerang and Jakarta, to a lesser extent Pontianak in West Kalimantan, Jambi and Lampung in mainland Sumatra, Banjarmasin in South Kalimantan, Manado, North Sulawesi, Batam in the Riau Islands archipelago as well as scattering pocketful minorities in Western New Guinea or the Indonesian part of Papua. The Cantonese mainly live in big major cities like Jakarta, Medan, Batam, Surabaya, Makassar, Semarang and Manado. The Teochew people are the majority within Chinese community in West Kalimantan province, especially in central to southern areas such as Kendawangan, Ketapang and Pontianak, as well as in the Riau Islands, which include Batam and Karimun. There are sizable communities of Hokchia or Fuzhounese speakers in East Java as well as Central Java, especially in Surabaya and Semarang. The Hainanese dialect group mostly inhabit the town of Pematangsiantar in North Sumatra province, which is the largest town outside Medan with a dominant minority Chinese population specifically of the said dialect group and to a lesser extent in other towns and provinces such as Manado, North Sulawesi (where the local Chinese minority population is mostly dominated by the Cantonese and Hakka subgroups) as well as the Riau region towns of Pekanbaru on the mainland part (Riau province) and Batam (Riau Islands).

Many Indonesians, including the ethnic Chinese, believe in the existence of a dialect of the Malay language, Chinese Malay, known locally as &#x27; or &#x27;. The growth of &quot;peranakan&quot; literature in the second half of the 19th century gave rise to such a variant, popularized through &quot;silat&quot; (martial arts) stories translated from Chinese or written in Malay and Indonesian. However, scholars argue it is different from the mixture of spoken Javanese and Malay that is perceived to be &quot;spoken exclusively by ethnic Chinese&quot;.

According to Ellen Rafferty, in Java, the &quot;peranakan&quot; generally started to speak Low Malay [Bazaar Malay] and some Javanese at home before 1800, while used the Low Malay for extra-local communication. The &quot;peranakan&quot; showed the usage of some Javanese in written communication since 1800. The spoken Javanese was later identified as &quot;ngoko&quot; variant. After 1880, the written Javanese was replaced by written Low Malay. Since 1945, the &quot;peranakan&quot; use Indonesianised-Javanese in home, supplanted by &quot;ngoko&quot; Javanese in local speech and Indonesian in extra-local communication and writing.

Academic literature discussing Chinese Malay commonly note that ethnic Chinese do not speak the same dialect of Malay throughout the archipelago. Furthermore, although the Dutch colonial government first introduced the Malay orthography in 1901, Chinese newspapers did not follow this standard until after independence. Because of these factors, the ethnic Chinese played a &quot;significant role&quot; in the development of the modern Indonesian language as the largest group during the colonial period to communicate in a variety of Malay dialects.

By 2018 the number of Chinese Indonesians studying Standard Mandarin increased.

=== Literature ===
Chinese cultural influences can be seen in local Chinese Malay literature, which dates back to the late 19th century. One of the earliest and most comprehensive works on this subject, Claudine Salmon&#x27;s 1981 book &quot;Literature in Malay by the Chinese of Indonesia: A Provisional Annotated Bibliography&quot;, lists over 3,000 works. Samples of this literature were also published in a six-volume collection titled &quot;&quot; (Chinese Malay Literature and the Indonesian Nation).

Kho Ping Hoo or Asmaraman Sukowati Kho Ping Hoo is a beloved Indonesian author of Chinese ethnicity. He is well known in Indonesia for his martial arts fiction set in the background of China or Java. During his 30 years career, at least 120 stories have been published (according to Leo Suryadinata). However, &quot;Forum&quot; magazine claimed at least Kho Ping Hoo had 400 stories with the background of China and 50 stories with the background of Java.

=== Media ===
All Chinese-language publications were prohibited under the assimilation policy of the Suharto period, with the exception of the government-controlled daily newspaper &quot;Harian Indonesia&quot;. The lifting of the Chinese-language ban after 1998 prompted the older generation of Chinese Indonesians to promote its use to the younger generation; according to Malaysian-Chinese researcher of the Chinese diaspora, Chang-Yau Hoon, they believed they would &quot;be influenced by the virtues of Chinese culture and Confucian values&quot;. One debate took place in the media in 2003, discussing the Chinese &quot;mu yu&quot; (, mother tongue) and the Indonesian &quot;guo yu&quot; (, national language). Nostalgia was a common theme in the Chinese-language press in the period immediately following Suharto&#x27;s government. The rise of China&#x27;s political and economic standing at the turn of the 21st century became an impetus for their attempt to attract younger readers who seek to rediscover their cultural roots.

During the first three decades of the 20th century, ethnic Chinese owned most, if not all, movie theaters in cities throughout the Dutch East Indies. Films from China were being imported by the 1920s, and a film industry began to emerge in 1928 with the arrival of the three Wong brothers from Shanghai—their films would dominate the market through the 1930s. These earliest films almost exclusively focused on the ethnic Chinese community, although a few examined inter-ethnic relations as a main theme. The later ban on the public use of the Chinese language meant that imported films and television programs were required to be dubbed in English with subtitles in Indonesian. When martial arts serials began appearing on national television in 1988, they were dubbed in Indonesian. One exception was the showing of films from Hong Kong in Chinese—limited to ethnic Chinese districts and their surroundings—because of an agreement between importers and the film censor board.

=== Religion ===

There is little scholarly work devoted to the religious life of Chinese Indonesians. The 1977 French book &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Chinese of Jakarta: Temples and Collective Life&quot;) is the only major study to assess ethnic Chinese religious life in Indonesia. The Ministry of Religious Affairs grants official status to six religions: Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. A 2006 civil registration law does not allow Indonesians to identify themselves as a member of any other religion on their identity cards.

According to an analysis of the 2000 census data, about half of Chinese Indonesians were Buddhists, and about one-third Protestant or Catholic. A report by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, however, puts the percentage of Christians much higher, at over 70%. With the exception of Chinese-Filipinos, Chinese Indonesians tend to be more Christian than other Chinese ethnic groups of Southeast Asia due to a complex of historical reasons. Throughout the 20th century Chinese religion and culture was forbidden and heavily persecuted in Indonesia, forcing many Chinese to convert to Christianity. The first wave of conversions occurred in the 1950s and 1960s, and the number of ethnic Chinese Christians during this period quadrupled. The second wave followed after the government withdrew Confucianism&#x27;s status as a recognized religion in the 1970s. Suharto endorsed a systematic campaign of eradication of Confucianism. As the result, many Chinese in Jakarta and other parts in Java island are mostly Christian, meanwhile in non-Java cities like Medan, Pontianak and other parts in Sumatra and Borneo island are mainly adherents to Buddhism, and some of them still practising Taoism, Confucianism and other Traditional Chinese belief.

In a country where nearly 86% of the population are Muslims, ethnic Chinese Muslims form a very small minority of the ethnic Chinese population, mainly due to intermarriages between Chinese men and local Muslim women. The 2010 census reckoned that 4.7% of Chinese Indonesians were followers of Islam. Associations such as the Organization of Chinese Muslims of Indonesia (&#x27;, PITI) had been in existence in the late 19th century. PITI was re-established in 1963 as a modern organization but occasionally experienced periods of inactivity. The Supreme Council for the Confucian Religion in Indonesia (&#x27;, MATAKIN) estimated that 95% of Confucians are ethnic Chinese; most of the remaining 5% are ethnic Javanese, who are mainly Chinese-Javanese marriages converts. Although the government has restored Confucianism&#x27;s status as a recognized religion, many local authorities do not abide by it and have refused to allow ethnic Chinese from listing it as a religion on their identity cards. Local officials remained largely unaware that the civil registration law legally allowed citizens to leave the religion section on their identity cards blank.


=== Architecture ===

Various forms of Chinese architecture exist throughout Indonesia with marked differences between urban and rural areas and among the different islands. Architectural developments by the Chinese in Southeast Asia differ from those in mainland China. By blending local and European (Dutch) design patterns, numerous variations of fusion styles emerged. Chinese architecture in Indonesia has manifested in three forms: religious temples, study halls, and houses. Cities during the colonial period were divided into three racial districts: European, oriental (Arabs, Chinese, and other Asians), and indigenous. There usually were no physical boundaries among the zones, except for rivers, walls, or roads in some cases. Such legal boundaries promoted high growths in urban density within each zone, especially in the Chinese quarters, often leading to poor environmental conditions.
Early settlers did not adhere to traditional architectural practices when constructing houses but instead adapted to living conditions in Indonesia. Although the earliest houses are no longer standing, they were likely built from wood or bamboo with thatched roofs, resembling indigenous houses found throughout Sumatra, Borneo, and Java. More permanent constructions replaced these settlements in the 19th century. Segregation policies under the Dutch forbade the use of European architectural styles by non-European ethnic groups. The ethnic Chinese and other foreign and indigenous groups lived according to their own cultures. Chinese houses along the north coast of Java were renovated to include Chinese ornamentation. As racial segregation eased at the turn of the 20th century, the ethnic Chinese who had lost their identity embraced European culture and began removing ethnic ornaments from their buildings. The policies implemented by the New Order government which prohibited the public display of Chinese culture have also accelerated the transition toward local and Western architecture.

=== Cuisine ===

Chinese culinary culture is particularly evident in Indonesian cuisine through the Hokkien, Hakka, and Cantonese loanwords used for various dishes. Words beginning with &#x27; () signify the presence of meat, e.g. &#x27; (meat bun); words ending with &#x27; () signify vegetables, e.g. &#x27; (Chinese white cabbage) and &#x27;. The words &#x27; () signify noodle as in &quot;&quot;.

Most of these loanwords for food dishes and their ingredients are Hokkien in origin, and are used throughout the Indonesian language and vernacular speech of large cities. Because they have become an integral part of the local language, many Indonesians and ethnic Chinese do not recognize their Hokkien origins. Some popular Indonesian dishes such as nasi goreng, pempek, lumpia, and bakpia can trace their origin to Chinese influence. Some food and ingredients are part of the daily diet of both the indigenous and ethnic Chinese populations as side dishes to accompany rice, the staple food of most of the country. Among ethnic Chinese families, both &quot;peranakan&quot; and &quot;totok&quot;, pork is generally preferred as meat; this is in contrast with traditional Indonesian cuisine, which in majority-Muslim areas avoids the meat. The consumption of pork has, however, decreased in recent years owing to a recognition of its contribution to health hazards such as high cholesterol levels and heart disease.

In a 1997 restaurant listing published by the English-language daily &quot;The Jakarta Post&quot;, which largely caters to expatriates and middle class Indonesians, at least 80 locations within the city can be considered Chinese out of the 10-page list. Additionally, major hotels generally operate one or two Chinese restaurants, and many more can be found in large shopping centers. Upscale Chinese restaurants in Jakarta, where the urban character of the ethnic Chinese is well established, can be found serving delicacies such as shark fin soup and bird&#x27;s nest soup. Food considered to have healing properties, including ingredients in traditional Chinese medicine, are in high demand.

===Education===
Citizens of Taiwan (officially known as the Republic of China) residing in Indonesia are served by two international schools: Jakarta Taipei School (印尼雅加達臺灣學校), which was the first Chinese-language school in Indonesia since the Indonesian government ended its ban on the Chinese language, and the Surabaya Taipei School (印尼泗水臺灣學校).

=== Geography ===
Warung Buncit is name of an area in South Jakarta (also known as Jalan AH Nasution) that took its origin from Chinese Indonesian profile name Bun Tjit. Zaenuddin HM wrote in his book 212 &quot;Asal-Usul Djakarta Tempo Doeloe&quot; that the name was inspired by a &quot;warung&quot; (local shop) ran by a Chinese Indonesia name Bun Tjit (styled Buncit). The shop was so famous among the local that the locals began to call the area Warung Buncit (lit., Buncit&#x27;s Shop). The area had been known as Warung Buncit ever since.

=== Honorifics ===
At present, a significant number of Indonesians, irrespective of their ethnic group, frequently use Chinese-derived kinship titles when addressing Chinese Indonesians. These titles are typically used colloquially, and are more prevalent in areas with a significant population of Chinese Indonesians, such as Jakarta and Surabaya.

In everyday situations, one would often hear young Chinese Indonesian men being called &quot;koko&quot; or &quot;kokoh&quot; (shortened as &quot;ko&quot; or &quot;koh&quot;), derived from the Hokkien &quot;koko&quot; or Mandarin &quot;gēgē&quot; (&#x27;, elder brother). On the other hand, young Chinese Indonesian women are typically addressed as &quot;cece&quot; or &quot;cici&quot; (shortened as &quot;ce&quot; &quot;or&quot; &quot;ci&quot;), stemming from &quot;jiějiě&quot; (&#x27;, elder sister). Occasionally, young Chinese Indonesian men might also be called &quot;titi&quot; or &quot;ti&quot;, originating from the word Hokkien &quot;tîtî&quot; or Mandarin &quot;dìdì&quot; (&#x27;, younger brother), and women may be referred to as &quot;meimei&quot; or &quot;meme&quot;, derived from the term &quot;mèimei&quot; (&#x27;, younger sister). However, the latter is infrequently used, especially by strangers, and is typically reserved for Chinese Indonesians addressing a younger family member. Other kinship titles may include &quot;ai&quot; or &quot;ayi&quot;, derived from the Hokkien &quot;aî&quot; or Mandarin &quot;āyí&quot; (&#x27;, aunt), used for addressing older women, and &quot;susuk&quot; (shortened as &quot;suk&quot;) derived from &quot;shūshu&quot; (&#x27;, uncle), commonly used for addressing older men.

This is evident in various platforms, such as the youth organization and pageant for Chinese Indonesians, Koko Cici. Additionally, many Chinese Indonesians have incorporated these titles into their social media, as used by popular content creators like, kokobuncit and cecekuliner.

<text>The February 28 incident (also called the February 28 massacre, the 228 incident, or the 228 massacre) was an anti-government uprising in Taiwan in 1947 that was violently suppressed by the Kuomintang–led nationalist government of the Republic of China (ROC). Directed by provincial governor Chen Yi and president Chiang Kai-shek, thousands of civilians were killed beginning on February 28. The incident is considered to be one of the most important events in Taiwan&#x27;s modern history and was a critical impetus for the Taiwan independence movement.

In 1945, following the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II, the Allies handed administrative control of Taiwan over to China, thus ending 50 years of Japanese colonial rule. Local residents became resentful of what they saw as high-handed and frequently corrupt conduct on the part of the Kuomintang (KMT) authorities, including the arbitrary seizure of private property, economic mismanagement, and exclusion from political participation. The flashpoint came on February 27, 1947, in Taipei, when agents of the State Monopoly Bureau struck a Taiwanese widow suspected of selling contraband cigarettes. An officer then fired into a crowd of angry bystanders, hitting one man, who died the next day. Soldiers fired upon demonstrators the next day, after which a radio station was seized by protesters and news of the revolt was broadcast to the entire island. As the uprising spread, the KMT-installed governor Chen Yi called for military reinforcements, and the uprising was violently put down by the National Revolutionary Army. Two years later, and for 38 years thereafter, the island would be placed under martial law in a period known as the &quot;White Terror&quot;.

During the White Terror, the KMT persecuted perceived political dissidents, and the incident was considered too taboo to be discussed. President Lee Teng-hui became the first president to discuss the incident publicly on its anniversary in 1995. The event is now openly discussed, and its details have become the subject of government and academic investigation. February 28 is now an official public holiday called Peace Memorial Day, on which the president of Taiwan gathers with other officials to ring a commemorative bell in memory of the victims. Monuments and memorial parks to the victims of the February 28 incident have been erected in a number of Taiwanese cities. In particular, Taipei&#x27;s former Taipei New Park was renamed 228 Peace Memorial Park, and the National 228 Memorial Museum was opened on February 28, 1997. The Kaohsiung Museum of History also has a permanent exhibit detailing the events of the incident in Kaohsiung. In 2019, the Transitional Justice Commission exonerated those who were convicted in the aftermath.

The number of deaths from the incident and massacre was estimated to be between 18,000 and 28,000. Other estimates are much lower. A government commission was set up under the administration of the pro-Taiwan independence president, Lee Teng-hui, to determine the facts. Using the civil registry set up during the Japanese administration, which was acknowledged by all as very efficient, they determined who was living at the time of the handover to the Chinese administration. The commission was given the power to award to the family of anyone who died in the period of the insurrection and the restoration of Nationalist government rule an amount of NT$6,000,000, about US$150,000. The families did not have to prove that the death was related to the above events. A total of 800 people came forward to get the awards for the people who died during the period.

==Background==

During the 50 years of Japanese rule in Taiwan (1895–1945), Taiwan experienced economic development and an increased standard of living, serving as a supply base for the Japanese main islands. After World War II, Taiwan was placed under the administrative control of the Republic of China to provide stability until a permanent arrangement could be made. Chen Yi, the governor-general of Taiwan, arrived on October 24, 1945, and received the last Japanese governor, Ando Rikichi, who signed the document of surrender on the next day. Chen Yi then proclaimed the day as Retrocession Day to make Taiwan part of the Republic of China.

Taiwanese perceptions of Japanese rule were more positive than perceptions in other parts of East and Southeast Asia that came under Japanese imperialism. Despite this, the Kuomintang troops from Mainland China were initially welcomed by the Taiwanese. Their harsh conduct and the corrupt KMT administration quickly led to Taiwanese discontent during the immediate postwar period. As governor-general, Chen Yi took over and sustained the Japanese system of state monopolies in tobacco, sugar, camphor, tea, paper, chemicals, petroleum refining, mining, and cement, the same way the Nationalists treated people in other former Japanese-controlled areas (earning Chen Yi the nickname &quot;robber&quot; ()). He confiscated some 500 Japanese-owned factories and mines, as well as the homes of former Japanese residents. 

Economic mismanagement led to a large black market, runaway inflation, and food shortages. Many commodities were compulsorily bought cheaply by the KMT administration and shipped to Mainland China to meet the Civil War shortages, where they were sold at a very high profit, furthering the general shortage of goods in Taiwan. The price of rice rose to 100 times its original value between the time the Nationalists took over and the spring of 1946, increasing to nearly four times the price in Shanghai. It inflated further to 400 times the original price by January 1947. Carpetbaggers from Mainland China dominated nearly all industry, as well as political and judicial offices, displacing the Taiwanese who were formerly employed. Many of the ROC garrison troops were highly undisciplined, looting, stealing, and contributing to the overall breakdown of infrastructure and public services. Because the Taiwanese elites had met with some success with self-government under Japanese rule, they had expected the same system from the incoming ruling Chinese Nationalist Government. However, the Chinese Nationalists opted for a different route, aiming for the centralization of government powers and a reduction in local authority. The KMT&#x27;s nation-building efforts followed this ideology because of unpleasant experiences with the diverging forces during the Warlord Era in 1916–1928 that had torn the government in China. Mainland Communists were even preparing to bring down the government like the Ili Rebellion. The different goals of the Nationalists and the Taiwanese, coupled with cultural and language misunderstandings, served to further inflame tensions on both sides.

==Uprising and crackdown==


On the evening of February 27, 1947, a Tobacco Monopoly Bureau enforcement team in Taipei went to the district of , Twatutia (Dadaocheng in Mandarin), where they confiscated contraband cigarettes from a 40-year-old widow named Lin Jiang-mai (林江邁) at the Tianma Tea House. When she demanded their return, one of the men struck her in the head with the butt of his gun, prompting the surrounding Taiwanese crowd to challenge the Tobacco Monopoly agents. As they fled, one agent shot his gun into the crowd, hitting a bystander who died the next day. The crowd, which had already been harbouring feelings of frustration from unemployment, inflation, and corruption towards the Nationalist government, reached its breaking point. The crowd protested to both the police and the gendarmes but was mostly ignored.

Protesters gathered the next morning around Taipei, calling for the arrest and trial of the agents involved in the previous day&#x27;s shooting, and eventually made their way to the Governor General&#x27;s Office, where security forces tried to disperse the crowd. Soldiers opened fire into the crowd, killing at least three people. On March 4, the Taiwanese took over the administration of the town and military bases and forced their way into a local radio station to broadcast news of the incident and call for people to revolt, causing uprisings to erupt throughout the island. By evening, martial law had been declared, and curfews were enforced by the arrest or shooting of anyone who violated the curfew.

For several weeks after the February 28 incident, Taiwanese civilians controlled much of Taiwan. The initial riots were spontaneous and sometimes violent, with mainland Chinese receiving beatings from and being killed by Taiwanese. Over 1,000 mainlanders were killed. Within a few days, the Taiwanese were generally coordinated and organized, and public order in Taiwanese-held areas was upheld by volunteer civilians organised by students and unemployed former Japanese army soldiers. Local leaders formed settlement committees (or resolution committees), which presented the government with a list of 32 demands for reform of the provincial administration. They demanded, among other things, greater autonomy, free elections, the surrender of the ROC Army to the Settlement Committee, and an end to government corruption. Motivations among the various Taiwanese groups varied; some demanded greater autonomy within the ROC, while others wanted UN trusteeship or full independence. The Taiwanese also demanded representation in the forthcoming peace treaty negotiations with Japan, hoping to secure a plebiscite to determine the island&#x27;s political future.

Outside of Taipei, there were examples of the formation of local militias, such as the Communist-inspired 27 Brigade near Taichung. In Chiayi, the mayor&#x27;s residence was set on fire, and local militias fought with the military police.

The Nationalist Government, under governor Chen Yi, stalled for time while it waited for reinforcements from Fujian. Upon their arrival on March 8, the ROC troops launched a crackdown. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, &quot;An American who had just arrived in China from Taipei said that troops from the mainland China arrived there on March 7 and indulged in three days of indiscriminate killing and arrest. For a time, everyone seen on the streets was fired upon, homes were broken into, and occupants were arrested. In the lower income sections the streets were said to have been littered with dead.

By the end of March, Chen Yi had ordered the imprisonment or execution of the leading Taiwanese organizers he could identify. His troops reportedly executed, according to a Taiwanese delegation in Nanjing, maybe between 3,000 to 4,000 people throughout the island, though the exact number is still undetermined. Detailed records kept by the KMT have been reported as missing. Some of the killings were random, while others were systematic. Taiwanese political leaders were among those targeted, and many of the Taiwanese who had formed self-governing groups during the reign of the Japanese were also victims of the February 28 incident. A disproportionate number of the victims had been discharged from the Imperial Japanese Army and came back unemployed. They were involved in the riots and looting and beat up recent immigrants from China. They presented the most fear, as they looked no different from Japanese soldiers from the mainland.

Some political organisations that participated in the uprising, for example the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, were declared &quot;communist&quot;. Many of their members were arrested and executed.

By late March 1947, the central executive committee of the KMT had recommended that Chen Yi be dismissed as governor-general over the &quot;merciless brutality&quot; he had shown in suppressing the rebellion. In June 1948, he was appointed provincial chairman of Zhejiang province. In January 1949, he attempted to defect to the Chinese Communist Party, but Chiang Kai-shek immediately relieved Chen of his duties. Chen Yi was escorted to Taiwan and later imprisoned in Keelung. In May 1950, a Taiwan military court sentenced Chen Yi to death for espionage. On June 18, he was executed at Machangding, Taipei.

== Death toll ==
Although 18,000–28,000 is widely cited as a broad death-toll as a result of the incident, various different figures have been given over time. In the immediate aftermath of the events, in addition to the Nanjing-based delegation, which cited 3,000–4,000, George Kerr cited a figure of 10,000 as being provided by various externally-based groups, a figure he cited in Formosa Betrayed, the first major book covering the incident in English which played a significant role in bringing it to light. The commonly cited range of 18,000–28,000 is based on an estimate made by a commission established in 1992 by then Premier Hau Pei-tsun, whose final report was adopted in 2007 by Premier Su Tseng-chang as the official account of the incident.

The 18,000–28,000 range has been challenged by several individuals, most prominently by Hau Pei-tsun, who in a letter published in the Chinese-language United Daily News in Feb. 2012, questioned whether “over 10,000 were killed” in the 228 Incident. Hau based his critique on the number of victims and their descendants who were claiming compensation for damages. Only around 1,000 people had put in claims for compensation as victims of the incident. However, others have contended that the veil of secrecy under the martial law period and taboo of discussing the matter had contributed to this low number, particularly as many descendants of victims may have been unaware that their relatives perished. 

Another critique of the common figure came from Marvin C. H. Ho, the president of the Taipei Language Institute and a member of the commission that issued the report. Mr. Ho stated that among his colleagues writing the report, very few supported the higher figure of 28,000. However, at the same time, he critiqued the report for only limiting itself to events in 1947. Fellow commission member Lai Tse-han, a history professor who was in charge of drafting the report, suggested that the report was shifting some blame away from the Chiang family by not covering extensive violations of human rights during the period where they had undeniable knowledge and complicity in the events, namely the 1950s and 1960s. Professor Lai stated that &quot;&quot;A lot of people here don&#x27;t know about the repression in the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s... More people were killed at that time than during 2-28. Police just knocked on the door at midnight, and then the people inside just disappeared.&quot; This viewpoint is somewhat similar to that of Kerr, who cited a figure of 10,000, but stated that between 1947 and 1965, when &quot;Formosa Betrayed&quot; was published, that &quot; If we add to this the thousands who have been seized and done away with since March, 1947, on the pretext that they were involved in the affair, the number may reach the 20,000 figure often given by Formosan writers.&quot;

==Legacy==



During the February 28 incident, Taiwanese leaders established Resolution Committees in various cities (with a central committee in Taipei) and demanded greater political autonomy. Negotiations with the ROC ended when troops arrived in early March. The subsequent feelings of betrayal felt towards the government and China are widely believed to have catalysed today&#x27;s Taiwan independence movement post-democratization. The initial February 28 purge was followed two years later by 38 years of martial law, commonly referred to as the White Terror, which lasted until the end of 1987, during which over 100,000 people were imprisoned for political reasons of which over 1,000 were executed. During this time, discussion of the incident was taboo.

In the 1970s, the 228 Justice and Peace Movement was initiated by several citizen groups to ask for a reversal of this policy and in 1992, the Executive Yuan promulgated the &quot;February 28 Incident Research Report&quot;. Then-president and KMT chairman Lee Teng-hui, who had participated in the incident and was arrested as an instigator and a Communist sympathizer, made a formal apology on behalf of the government in 1995 and declared February 28 a day to commemorate the victims. Among other memorials erected, Taipei New Park was renamed 228 Memorial Park.

In 1990, the ROC Executive Yuan set up a task force to investigate the February 28 incident. The &quot;Report of the 228 Incident&quot; (二二八事件研究報告) was published in 1992, and a memorial was set up in 1995 at the 228 Peace Park in Taipei. In October 1995, the state-funded Memorial Foundation of 228 (二二八事件紀念基金會) was established to distribute compensation again and award rehabilitation certificates to victims of the February 28 incident in order to restore their reputation. Family members of dead and missing victims are eligible for NT$6 million (approximately US$190,077). The foundation reviewed 2,885 applications, most of which were accepted. Of these, 686 involved deaths, 181 involved missing persons, and 1,459 involved imprisonment. Many descendants of victims remain unaware that their family members were victims, while many of the families of victims from Mainland China did not know the details of their relatives&#x27; mistreatment during the riot. Those who have received compensation twice are still demanding trials of the still-living soldiers and officials who were responsible for the jail terms and deaths of their loved ones. On the other hand, some survivors thought the arrest and questioning had more to do with looting and riot participation as many unemployed citizens had just been discharged from the Japanese Imperial Army from overseas.

On February 28, 2004, thousands of Taiwanese participated in the 228 Hand-in-Hand Rally. They formed a long human chain from Taiwan&#x27;s northernmost city to its southern tip to commemorate the incident, call for peace, and protest the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s deployment of missiles aimed at Taiwan along the coast of the Taiwan Strait.

In 2006, the &quot;Research Report on Responsibility for the 228 Massacre&quot; (二二八事件責任歸屬研究報告) was released after several years of research. The 2006 report was not intended to overlap with the prior (1992) 228 Massacre Research Report commissioned by the Executive Yuan. Chiang Kai-shek is specifically named as having the largest responsibility in the 2006 report.

===Art===
A number of artists in Taiwan have addressed the subject of the February 28 incident since the taboo was lifted on the subject in the early 1990s. The incident has been the subject of music by Fan-Long Ko and Tyzen Hsiao and a number of literary works.

===Film===
Hou Hsiao-hsien&#x27;s &quot;A City of Sadness&quot;, the first movie that addressed the events, won the Golden Lion at the 1989 Venice Film Festival. The 2009 thriller &quot;Formosa Betrayed&quot; also relates the incident as part of the motivation behind Taiwan independence activist characters.

===Literature===
Jennifer Chow&#x27;s 2013 novel &quot;The 228 Legacy&quot; revealed the emotional ramifications for those who lived through the events yet suppressed their knowledge out of fear. It focused on how there was such an impact that it permeated throughout multiple generations within the same family. Shawna Yang Ryan&#x27;s 2016 novel &quot;Green Island&quot; tells the story of the incident as it affects three generations of a Taiwanese family, while Julie Wu&#x27;s novel &quot;The Third Son&quot; (2013) describes the event and its aftermath from the viewpoint of a Taiwanese boy.

===Music===
The Taiwanese metal band Chthonic&#x27;s album &quot;Mirror of Retribution&quot; makes several lyrical references to the February 28 incident.

<text>Carmen Basilio (born Carmine Basilio, April 2, 1927 – November 7, 2012) was an American professional boxer who was the world champion in both the welterweight and middleweight divisions, beating Sugar Ray Robinson for the latter title. An iron-chinned pressure fighter, Basilio was a combination puncher who had great stamina and eventually wore many of his opponents down with vicious attacks to the head and body.

In 1957, &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine named Basilio Fighter of the Year and he won the Hickok Belt, a trophy that was awarded to the top professional athlete of the year. The Boxing Writers Association of America (BWAA) named him Fighter of the Year in 1955 and 1957. Basilio also holds the distinction of being in &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s Fight of the Year in five consecutive years (1955–59), a feat unmatched by any other boxer.

In 2002, Basilio was voted by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine as the 40th greatest fighter of the last 80 years. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 1990.

==Boxing career==

===Journeyman===
Basilio began his professional boxing career by facing Jimmy Evans on November 24, 1948, in Binghamton, New York. He knocked Evans out in the third round, and five days later he beat Bruce Walters in only one round. By the end of 1948, he had completed four bouts.

He started 1949 with two draws, against Johnny Cunningham on January 5 and against Jay Perlin 20 days later. Basilio campaigned exclusively inside the state of New York during his first 24 bouts, going 19-3-2 during that span. His first loss was at the hands of Connie Thies, who beat him in a six-round decision on May 2, 1949. He fought Cunningham three more times during that period. Basilio won by knockout in two rounds on their second meeting, Cunningham won by a decision in eight in their third fight, and Basilio won by a decision in eight in their fourth.

In the middle of that 24-bout span, 1950 rolled over and Basilio met former world champion Lew Jenkins, winning a 10-round decision.

For fight number 25, Basilio decided that it was time to campaign outside of New York state, so he went to New Orleans, where he boxed his next six fights. In his first bout there, he met Gaby Ferland, who held him to a draw. He and Ferland later had a rematch, Basilio winning by a knockout in the first round. He also boxed Guillermo Giminez there twice, first beating him by knockout in eight and then by knockout in nine. In his last fight before returning home, he lost by a decision in 10 to Eddie Giosa.

For his next seven bouts, Basilio only went 3–3–1, but he was able to avenge his loss to Giosa by winning a ten-round decision over him in Syracuse.

In 1952, Basilio went 6–2–1. He beat Jimmy Cousins among others that year, but he lost to Chuck Davey and Billy Graham. The draw he registered that year was against Davey in the first of the two meetings that year.

===Rise in the ranks===
In 1953. Basilio started winning big fights and rose in the welterweight division rankings. He secured his first world title fight, against Cuba&#x27;s Kid Gavilán for Gavilán&#x27;s world welterweight championship.

Before fighting against Gavilan, he beat former world lightweight champion Ike Williams and had two more fights with Graham, avenging his earlier loss to Graham in the second bout between them with a 12-round decision win and drawing in the third. Basilio lost a 15-round decision to Gavilan and went for a fourth meeting with Cunningham, this time winning by a knockout in four. Then he and French fighter Pierre Langois began another rivalry with a 10-round draw in the first bout between the two.

In 1954, Basilio went undefeated in eight bouts, going 7-0-1 with 2 knockouts and defeating Langois in their rematch by decision.

===World Champion===
In 1955, Basilio began by beating Peter Müller by decision. After that, Basilio was once again the number one challenger, and on June 10 of that year he received his second world title try, against world welterweight champion Tony DeMarco. Basilio became world champion by knocking out DeMarco in the 12th round.

After winning the title, Basilio had two non-title bouts, including a ten-round decision win over Gil Turner, before he and DeMarco met again, this time with Basilio as the defending world champion. Their second fight had exactly the same result as their first bout: Basilio won by a knockout in 12.

For his next fight, in 1956, Basilio lost the title in Chicago to Johnny Saxton by a decision in 15. Saxton&#x27;s manager, mafioso Frank &quot;Blinky&quot; Palermo&quot;, was later jailed along with his partner Frankie Carbo for fixing fights. Basilio said of losing his title to the referees&#x27; decision: &quot;It was like being robbed in a dark alley.&quot; In an immediate rematch that was fought in Syracuse, Basilio regained the crown with a nine-round knockout, and then, in a rubber match, Basilio kept the belt with a knockout in two.

After that, he went up in weight and challenged ageing 36- year-old world middleweight champion Sugar Ray Robinson, in what may have been his most famous fight. He won the middleweight championship of the world by beating Robinson in a 15-round split decision on September 23, 1957. The day after, he had to abandon the welterweight belt, in accordance with boxing&#x27;s then rules. In 1957 Basilio won the Hickok Belt as top professional athlete of the year.

===Decline===
In 1958, he and Robinson met in a rematch on March 25 and Robinson barely regained the title with a controversial 15-round split decision. The judges scored 71 to 64,5 and 72 to 64 Robinson while the referee scores 66 to 69 Basilio. Although Basilio&#x27;s left eye was totally swollen shut from the 6th round on, many of the ringside press thought Basilio won the fight.

From that moment, and until his retirement in 1961, he fought only sporadically, but three of his last fights were attempts to recover the world middleweight title, losing twice to Gene Fullmer: by a TKO in 14 at San Francisco and by a TKO in 12 in Fullmer&#x27;s home state of Utah (in Salt Lake City), and also later, when he lost a 10-round decision to defending world champion Paul Pender.

In between those fights, he was able to beat Art Aragon, by knockout in eight and former world welterweight champion Don Jordan by decision in ten. His fight with Pender for the title was also his last fight as a professional boxer.

===Senate Testimony===
In 1960, Basilio testified before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust and the Monopoly during its investigation of the International Boxing Club of New York and the influence of organized crime on boxing. Basilio told the Subcommittee about Frankie Carbo and Frank &quot;Blinky&quot; Palmero and Carbo&#x27;s aide, Gabriel Genovese, a cousin of Mafia Don Vito Genovese who was convicted in 1959 of being an unlicensed boxing manager. He called for a house cleaning of professional boxing. His testimony revealed that his former managers had to pay off organized crime for his title shots and that he essentially had a behind the scenes manager in Genovese.

Evidence submitted to the subcommittee showed that Basilio&#x27;s on-the-record managers, John DeJohn and Joseph Netro, paid Carbo frontman Gabriel Genovese $39,334.41 and approximately $25,000, respectively, during the time Basilio fought for and defended his welterweight and middleweight titles.

===Record===

Carmen Basilio retired with a ring record of 56 wins, 16 losses and 7 draws, with 27 wins by knockout.

==Post-boxing life==
After his retirement, Basilio worked for a time at the Genesee Brewery in Rochester, NY. Later Carmen, a high-school dropout, taught physical education at Le Moyne College in Syracuse. Basilio, who was also a member of the United States Marine Corps at one point in his life, was able to enjoy his retirement. Carmen was associated with a sausage company, frequently confused with a separate sausage company run by his brother Paul, for which he was a salesman.

During the 1970s, his nephew Billy Backus became world welterweight champion after having a shaky start to his own boxing career, and Basilio declared on the day that Backus became champion that, to him, Billy&#x27;s winning the title was better than his winning it himself.

In 1990, Ed Brophy decided to build the International Boxing Hall of Fame in Canastota, New York, to honor the two world champions who were born there: Basilio and his nephew. Although Backus isn&#x27;t a member of the Hall of Fame, Basilio is, along with many of the fighters he met inside the ring.

In the late 1990s, Basilio became seriously ill, requiring triple bypass heart surgery. Doctors were able to repair his heart.

Basilio was interviewed for an HBO documentary on Sugar Ray Robinson called &quot;The Bright Lights and Dark Shadows of a Champion&quot;. He mentioned that although he respected Robinson&#x27;s talents in the ring, he did not like him as a person.

In 2010, &quot;Title Town USA, Boxing in Upstate New York&quot; by historian Mark Allen Baker was published by The History Press in 2010 and identifies Canastota as the epicenter of Upstate New York&#x27;s rich boxing heritage. The book includes chapters on both Carmen Basilio and Billy Backus. The introduction was written by Edward P. Brophy Executive Director of the International Boxing Hall of Fame. He died aged 85 in 2012, and is survived by his wife Josephine Basilio.
