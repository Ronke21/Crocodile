<text>The City of the Sun (; ) is a philosophical work by the Italian Dominican philosopher Tommaso Campanella. It is an important early utopian work. The work was written in Italian in 1602, shortly after Campanella&#x27;s imprisonment for heresy and sedition. A Latin version was written in 1613–14 and published in Frankfurt in 1623.

== Synopsis ==

The book is presented as a dialogue between &quot;a Grandmaster of the Knights Hospitaller and a Genoese Sea-Captain&quot;. Inspired by Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; and the description of Atlantis in &quot;Timaeus&quot;, it describes a theocratic society where goods, women and children are held in common. It also resembles the City of Adocentyn in the &quot;Picatrix&quot;, an Arabic grimoire of astrological magic. In the final part of the work, Campanella prophesies—in the veiled language of astrology—that the Spanish kings, in alliance with the Pope, are destined to be the instruments of a Divine Plan: the final victory of the True Faith and its diffusion in the whole world. While one could argue that Campanella was simply thinking of the conquest of the New World, it seems that this prophecy should be interpreted in the light of a work written shortly before &quot;The City of the Sun&quot;, &quot;The Monarchy in Spain&quot;, in which Campanella exposes his vision of a unified, peaceful world governed by a theocratic monarchy.

== The City ==
Protected and defended by seven circles of walls, constructed of palaces that serve as dwellings for the citizens, the city is located in a place with an ideal climate, conducive to physical health, and on the slope of a hillside because the air there is lighter and purer. One of the most significant aspects of this community is the distribution of work. Once again Campanella engages in an explicit polemic with Aristotle, who had excluded artisans, peasants and those involved in manual labor from the category of full citizenship and from the highest levels of virtue.

In the City of the Sun no occupation is vile or base, and all are of equal dignity—in fact, those workers who are required to expend greater effort, such as artisans and builders, receive more praise. Everyone must be acquainted with all lines of work, and then each person practices the one for which he shows the greatest aptitude. They have no servants, and no service is regarded as unworthy. The only thing that they consider to be despicable is idleness, and in this way they come to privilege the dignity of work and to overturn an absurd conception of nobility, linked to inactivity and vice.

Thanks to the equal division of labour, it is sufficient for each person to spend only four hours a day working; but it is essential that they all work, because the idleness of one would have repercussions on the profit and the effort of the others. The citizens possess nothing; instead, everything is held in common, from food to houses, from the acquisition of knowledge to the exercise of activities, from honors to amusements, from women to children.

There are &quot;officials&quot; in charge of the distribution of each thing, who keep an eye out and make sure that this happens justly, but no one can appropriate anything for himself. According to them, possession of a house or a family reinforces &quot;self-love&quot;, with all the dire consequences this generates. They live &quot;like philosophers in common&quot; because they are aware of the negative impact, not only on the social but also on the moral level, of an unequal distribution of goods.

One of the most spectacular and imaginative aspects of The City of the Sun, which immediately struck its readers, are the painted walls of the city. Apart from enclosing and protecting the city, the walls are also the curtains of an extraordinary theater and the pages of an illustrated encyclopedia of knowledge. The walls of the palaces are painted with images of all the arts and sciences.

Starting with the wall that holds up the columns of the temple and gradually descending in large circles, following the order of the planets from Mercury to Saturn, we encounter illustrations of the heavens and the stars, of mathematical figures, of every country on earth and of all the marvels and secrets of the mineral, vegetable and animal worlds, until we arrive at mankind: on the internal wall of the sixth circle the mechanical arts and their inventors are represented.

Campanella was greatly interested in all ingenious discoveries, and in The City of the Sun he provides many examples of curious inventions, such as vessels able to navigate without wind and without sails, and stirrups that make it possible to guide a horse using only one&#x27;s feet, leaving one&#x27;s hands free. On the external wall legislators are depicted; and it is here, in &quot;a place of great honor&quot; —but along with Moses, Osiris, Jove, Mercury and Muhammad— that the Genoese sailor recognizes Christ and the twelve apostles. Knowledge is not enclosed in books kept in separate places such as libraries but is openly on show to everyone&#x27;s eyes. Visualizing in this manner promotes a quicker, easier and more efficient form of visual learning, in that it is connected to the art of memory, which underlines the evocative and emotive power of images. From a tender age children run around in this theater of knowledge, appropriately guided and following correct itineraries, so that they learn joyously, as if playing a game, without effort or pain.

In addition to the community of goods and the painted walls, another characteristic feature of the City of the Sun, one that is more difficult and disconcerting and that Campanella himself describes as &quot;hard and arduous&quot;, is the community of wives. This is the solution adopted by the citizens to the problem of generation. Echoing the teaching of the Pythagorean Ocellus Lucanus, Campanella says that they are amazed that humans are preoccupied by the breeding of horses and dogs while neglecting their own. The act of generation entails a large responsibility on the part of the parents; and if it is exercised in an incorrect manner, it can give rise to a long chain of suffering.

Moreover, there is a close connection between a person&#x27;s natural &quot;complexion&quot; or character, which is inborn and not afterwards modifiable, and moral virtue, which needs a suitable terrain in order to take root and prosper. Generation should therefore respect precise norms and not be entrusted to chance nor to individual sentiments. The citizens distinguish between love and sex. Affection between men and women, based on friendship and respect more than sexual attraction, is expressed in acts that are far removed from sexuality, such as exchanges of gifts, conversation and dancing. Sexual generation, on the other hand, must obey strict rules regarding the physical and moral qualities of the parents and the choice of a propitious time for conception, determined by an astrologer. Such a union is not the expression of a personal, emotional or passionate relationship, but rather is connected to the social responsibility of generation and to love for the collective community.

The religious beliefs of the citizenry, even though they include fundamental principles of Christianity (such as the immortality of the soul and divine providence), form a natural religion that establishes a sort of osmosis between the city and the stars. The temple is open and not surrounded by walls. In one of his poems Campanella promises: &quot;I shall make the heavens a temple and the stars an altar&quot;. On the vault of the temple&#x27;s dome the stars are depicted together with their influence on earthly affairs. The altar, on which are placed a celestial and a terrestrial globe, is in the form of the sun. Prayers are directed toward the heavens. The task of the twenty-four priests, who live in cells located in the highest part of the temple, is to observe the stars and, using astronomical instruments, to take account of all their movements. It is their job to indicate the times most favorable for generation and for agricultural labors, acting in this way as intermediaries between God and human beings.

== Trento 1602 manuscript ==

In Trento&#x27;s Civic Library, there is kept a 1602 manuscript of &quot;The City of the Sun&quot; (shelf mark BCT1-1538), discovered in 1943 by Italian historian Luigi Firpo. It is considered the most ancient manuscript copy that has survived to the present time. The text arrived at the Library through the bequest of Baron (1781–1841). He was a book collector and bibliophile and, as written in his will, he donated his book heritage to the Civic Library.

The manuscript was restored in 1980. It is made of parchment tied on paperboard. It consists of two codicological unities joined years after their writing: the first is a Venetian historical chronicle from 1297 to 1582, followed by a list of &quot;Hospedali di Venezia&quot; (&quot;Hospitals in Venice&quot;). At the bottom, it is sewn to a small-sized booklet independently enumerated: it is a copy by an anonymous hand of &quot;The City of the Sun&quot;. The transcription is meticulous, and there only are a few insignificant mistakes.

<text>The Geek Code, developed in 1993, is a series of letters and symbols used by self-described &quot;geeks&quot; to inform fellow geeks about their personality, appearance, interests, skills, and opinions. The idea is that everything that makes a geek individual can be encoded in a compact format which only other geeks can read. This is deemed to be efficient in some sufficiently geeky manner.

It was once common practice to use a geek code as one&#x27;s email or Usenet signature, but the last official version of the code was produced in 1996, and it has now largely fallen out of use.

A number of similar codes were developed for other subcultures, such as a Goth Code for the Goth subculture, and the Natural Bears Classification System for gay men.

==History==
The Geek Code was invented by Robert A. Hayden in 1993 and was defined at geekcode.com. It was inspired by a similar code for the bear subculture - which in turn was inspired by the Yerkes spectral classification system for describing stars.

After a number of updates, the last revision of the code was v3.12, in 1996.

Some alternative encodings have also been proposed. For example, the 1997 Acorn Code was a version specific to users of Acorn&#x27;s RISC OS computers.

==Format==
Geek codes can be written in two formats; either as a simple string:&lt;br&gt;

...or as a &quot;Geek Code Block&quot;, a parody of the output produced by the encryption program PGP:&lt;br&gt;

Note that this latter format has a line specifying the version of Geek Code being used.

(Both these examples use Hayden&#x27;s own geek code.)

==Encoding==
===Occupation===
The code starts with the letter codice_1 (for Geek) followed by the geek&#x27;s occupation(s): codice_2 for a geek of music, codice_3 for a geek of computer science etc. There are 28 occupations that can be represented, but codice_4 is for geeks that can do anything and everything - and &quot;usually precludes the use of other vocational descriptors&quot;.

===Categories===
The Geek Code website contains the complete list of categories, along with all of the special syntax options.

==Decoding==
There have been several &#x27;&quot;decoders&quot; produced to transform a specific geek code into English, including:
* Bradley M. Kuhn, in late 1998, made Williams&#x27; program available as a web service. 
* Joe Reiss made a similar page available in October 1999.

<doc id="163771" wikidata="Q108926" url="?curid=163771" title="Clément Marot">
<text>Clément Marot (23 November 1496 – 12 September 1544) was a French Renaissance poet. He was influenced by the writers of the late 15th century and paved the way for the Pléiade, and is undoubtedly the most important poet at the court of Francis I. Despite the support of Marguerite de Valois-Angoulême (1492-1549), the king’s sister, his strong leanings toward the Reformation led to several imprisonments and two periods of exile.

== Biography ==

=== Youth ===
Marot was born at Cahors, the capital of the province of Quercy, some time during the winter of 1496–1497. His father, Jean Marot (c. 1463-1523), whose more correct name appears to have been des Mares, Marais or Marets, was a Norman from the Caen region and was also a poet. Jean held the post of &quot;escripvain&quot; (a cross between poet laureate and historiographer) to Anne of Brittany, Queen of France. Clément was the child of his second wife. The boy was &quot;brought into France&quot; — it is his own expression, and is not unnoteworthy as showing the strict sense in which that term was still used at the beginning of the 16th century — in 1506. He appears to have been educated at the University of Paris, and to have then begun studying law. Jean Marot instructed his son in the fashionable forms of verse-making, which called for some formal training.

It was the time of the &quot;rhétoriqueurs&quot;, poets who combined stilted language with a fondness for the allegorical manner of the 15th century and the most complicated and artificial forms of the &quot;ballade&quot; and the &quot;rondeau&quot;. Clément began as a &quot;rhétoriqueur&quot;, though he later helped overthrow this style. He wrote panegyrics to Guillaume Crétin and translated Virgil&#x27;s first eclogue in 1512. He soon gave up the study of law and became page to Nicolas de Neufville, seigneur de Villeroy, which led to his introduction into court life. The house of Valois, which would hold the throne of France for the greater part of a century, was devoted to literature.

===At the French court===
As early as 1514, before the accession of King Francis I, Clément presented to him his &quot;Judgment of Minos&quot;, and shortly afterward he was either styled or styled himself &quot;facteur (poet) de la reine&quot; to Queen Claude. In 1519 he was attached to the suite of Marguerite d&#x27;Alençon, the king&#x27;s sister, (later to become Marguerite de Navarre), a great patron of the arts. He was also a great favourite of Francis himself, attended the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520, and duly celebrated it in verse. In the next year he was at the camp in Flanders, and wrote of the horrors of war.

Marot, like most of Marguerite&#x27;s literary court, was attracted by her grace, her kindness, and her intellectual accomplishments, but there is no grounds for thinking that they had a romantic relationship. During this time his poetic style began to change, becoming much less artificial. Some of his poems praise a lady named &quot;Diane&quot;, whom some have identified with Diane de Poitiers.

===In Paris===
In 1524, Marot accompanied King Francis on his disastrous Italian campaign. The king was taken prisoner at the Battle of Pavia, but there are no grounds for supposing that Marot was wounded or shared the king&#x27;s fate, and he was back in Paris again by the beginning of 1525. However, Marguerite for intellectual reasons, and her brother for political, had until then favoured the double movement of &quot;Aufklärung&quot;, partly humanist, partly reforming, which distinguished the beginning of the century. Formidable opposition to both forms of innovation now began to appear, and Marot, never particularly prudent, was arrested on a charge of heresy and lodged in the Grand Châtelet in February 1526. This was only a foretaste of his coming trouble, and a friendly prelate, acting for Marguerite, arranged his release before Easter. The imprisonment caused him to write a vigorous poem entitled &quot;Enfer&quot; (hell), later imitated by his friend Étienne Dolet. His father died about this time, and Marot seems to have been appointed in Jean&#x27;s place as &quot;valet de chambre&quot; to the king. He was certainly a member of the royal household in 1528 with a stipend of 250 &quot;livres&quot;. In 1530, probably, he married. The following year he was once again in trouble, this time for attempting to rescue a prisoner, and was again released, this time after Marot wrote the king one of his most famous poems, appealing for his release.

In 1532 he published (it had perhaps appeared three years earlier), under the title of &quot;Adolescence Clémentine&quot;, the first printed collection of his works, which was very popular and was frequently reprinted with additions. Unfortunately, the poet&#x27;s enemies ensured that Marot was implicated in the 1534 Affair of the Placards, and this time he fled.

===In Ferrara===
He passed through Nérac, the court of Navarre, and made his way to Renée, duchess of Ferrara, a supporter of the Protestant Reformation in France—as steadfast as her sister-in-law Marguerite, and even more efficacious, because her dominions were outside France. At Ferrara his work there included the celebrated &quot;Blasons&quot; (a descriptive poem, improved upon medieval models), which set all the verse-writers of France imitating them. The &quot;blason&quot; was defined by Thomas Sébillet as a perpetual praise or continuous of its subject. The &quot;blasons&quot; of Marot&#x27;s followers were printed in 1543 with the title of &quot;Blasons anatomiques du corps féminin&quot;.

===Back in Paris===
Duchess Renée was not able to persuade her husband, Ercole d&#x27;Este, to share her views, and Marot had to leave Ferrara. He went to Venice, but before very long Pope Paul III remonstrated with Francis I on the severity with which the Protestants were treated, and they were allowed to return to Paris on condition of recanting their errors. Marot returned with the rest, and abjured his heresy at Lyon. In 1539 Francis gave him a house and grounds in the suburbs.

It was at this time that his famous and influential translations of the &quot;Psalms&quot; appeared. Each courtier identified his or her favorite psalms, and the poems were sung in the court and in the city. It is said, probably with exaggeration, that these translations did more than anything else to advance the cause of the Protestant Reformation in France. Marot&#x27;s translations of the Psalms continued to be sung for centuries by Protestant congregations.

===Later life===
At the same time Marot engaged in a literary quarrel with a poet named François de Sagon, who represented the Sorbonne. Verse-writers of France aligned themselves as &quot;Marotiques&quot; or &quot;Sagontiques&quot;, and abuse was exchanged. Victory, as far as wit was concerned, was with Marot, but at the cost of ill-will against him.
Marot also edited the works of his fellow poet François Villon.

Although the &quot;Psalms&quot; were published in 1541 and 1543 with royal privilege, the Sorbonne still objected to translations from the Bible into French. In 1543, it was evident that Marot could not rely on the protection of the king; therefore he left for Geneva. After living working on the Psalms there, as Calvin became more influential, he went to Piedmont. He died at Turin in the autumn of 1544 and was buried in the Cathedral there at the expense of the French ambassador to Rome. 
== Editions ==
The most important early editions of Marot&#x27;s &quot;Œuvres&quot; were published at Lyon in 1538 and 1544. In the second of these the arrangement of his poems which has been accepted in later issues was first adopted; in 1596 an enlarged edition was edited by François Mizière. The Parisian printer Denis Janot, however, also printed several important editions of books by Marot. Others of later date are those of Nicolas Lenglet Du Fresnoy (The Hague, 1731) and P. Jannet (1868–1872; new ed., 1873–1876), on the whole the best, but there is a very good selection with a still better introduction by Charles d&#x27;Héricault, the joint editor of the Jannet edition in the larger &quot;Collection Garnier&quot; (no date). From an elaborate edition by G. Guiffrey only Vol. II and III appeared during his lifetime. Robert Yve-Plessis and Jean Plattard completed the edition in 5 vols (Paris, 1874-1931).
The first &#x27;scientific&#x27; edition is by C. A. Mayer in 6 vols.(1958-1980), which follows the arrangement of the material in &#x27;genres&#x27; (like the edition 1544).
The last complete scientific edition is by Gérard Defaux in 2 vols. (1990–92). Defaux adopts the editing principles of Marot himself, as deducible from his own 1538 edition, mentioned above.

==Influence==
Many of Marot&#x27;s texts were set as chansons, particularly by his contemporary Claudin de Sermisy.

Douglas Hofstadter&#x27;s book &quot;Le Ton beau de Marot&quot;, deals with the problems of translation, and includes several dozen different translations of Marot&#x27;s poem &quot;A une damoyselle malade&quot;.

Both Maurice Ravel and George Enescu composed song settings of Marot&#x27;s poems.

Wilhelm Killmayer set one of his poems in his song cycle &#x27; in 1953, and another in &#x27; in 1968.

<text>Percy is a 1971 British comedy film directed by Ralph Thomas starring Hywel Bennett, Denholm Elliott, Elke Sommer and Britt Ekland.

The film is based on the 1969 novel of the same name by Raymond Hitchcock, and features a soundtrack by The Kinks. It was followed by a 1974 sequel, &quot;Percy&#x27;s Progress&quot;.

==Plot==
Edwin Anthony is an innocent and shy young man who is hit by a nude man falling from a high-rise building while carrying a chandelier. Edwin&#x27;s penis is mutilated in the accident and has to be amputated; the falling man is killed.

Edwin becomes the recipient of the world&#x27;s first penis transplant: he receives the very large penis of the womanizer killed in the same accident. With his new bit of anatomy (which he names &quot;Percy&quot;), Edwin follows the womanizer&#x27;s footsteps, meeting all his women friends, before settling happily with the donor&#x27;s mistreated widow.

==Cast==
==Production==
Producer Betty E. Box discovered the novel when she and director Ralph Thomas were meeting a publisher about optioning the film rights for another book. They were not available at the time, but the publisher gave them a manuscript by Raymond Hitchcock about a penis transplant. Box took it back to the office to read. &quot;I zipped through it, laughing aloud as I read&quot;, she wrote. &quot;Very unusual. I might sometimes smile at a book, but I hadn&#x27;t laughed like this since I read Richard Gordon&#x27;s &quot;Doctor in the House&quot;.&quot;

Ralph Thomas enjoyed the book too so they decided to option the rights. These ended up costing four times more than Box originally thought after Hichcock had his own agent, as opposed to the publisher, do the negotiations. Box and Thomas paid for the rights themselves &quot;not without a fair amount of heart-searching&quot;, Box wrote, &quot;as we didn&#x27;t expect it to be a straightforward financing operation – with the amount required to make a film it seldom is – but this was certainly not a subject I expected Rank, our traditional partners, to finance. They very soon turned it down without even reading it.&quot;

In June 1969 it was announced Box had bought the rights for £30,000 (the novel was not published until November). &quot;I know people are saying this is the film that cannot be made,&quot; said Box. &quot;But we have already thrashed out a makeshift formula... It will be a comedy film with sex, not a sex film... We are only dealing with something that every man has.&quot; &quot;This is a tale of exploration,&quot; said Ralph Thomas.

Finance was obtained from Nat Cohen at EMI Films - they provided the entire budget. The poster was designed by John Troke, a publicist who had introduced Box to the book of &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; 15 years earlier. A script was prepared by Hugh Leonard while Thomas and Box filmed &quot;Doctor in Trouble&quot;. 

&quot;Five years ago I doubt we could have gotten away with it,&quot; said Box. &quot;But today it is time we made the human male organ a subject for open, straightforward conversation. I mean, really it is a thing that has been sacred too long.&quot;

The script was rewritten by Michael Palin and Terry Jones. They met with Thomas and Box at Pinewood in May 1970 and rewrote the script that month.

The film was shot in June 1970 being finished by September. It took place at Elstree Studios and on location in London. The film&#x27;s sets were designed by the art director Robert Jones. Ray Davies of The Kinks wrote the film&#x27;s soundtrack &quot;Percy&quot;.

&quot;I realise this is an adult film,&quot; said Box, &quot;but I do insist that it is not a sexy one.&quot;

During the making of the film, another comedy about a penis was being shot, &quot;The Statue&quot;. Box always regarded this as a rip off.

Box says that Raymond Hitchcock was delighted with the film and thought Hywel Bennett was very close to his original James Anthony.

Thomas and Box agreed to make a sequel provided Nat Cohen finance a film they wanted to make about the Byron-Shelley story, &quot;The Reckless Years&quot;. However Cohen reneged on the deal and only made the sequel.

==Release==
The film was not screened in Australia until the &quot;R&quot; certificate was introduced.

== Reception ==

=== Critical ===
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;The advertising campaign which paved the way for &quot;Percy&quot; by inviting us to guess its length seemed reprehensible enough but was still inadequate preparation for the unadulterated salacity of the film itself. Edwin&#x27;s first waking vision of the Post Office Tower sets the tone for a fusillade of barrack-room humour that repeats and twists practically every joke ever made about male genitalia, then caps this by having comedian Arthur English stand up and recite what would appear to be an anthology of the gags that didn&#x27;t make the grade for the scenario. Depressing enough when it forms the mainstay of the hospital situation comedy, this monotonous level of wit becomes still more wearying as an attempt to enliven Edwin&#x27;s apparently pointless quest for his donor. Director Ralph Thomas never misses an opportunity to leer at an undraped statue or the phallic objects that litter the sets and tower from the hoardings, though he does find time to make reproving digs at the amorality of television and the tabloid press. In the face of such banality, accomplished performers like Denholm Elliott and Adrienne Posta just fall by the wayside, although Cyd Hayman as the melancholy widow manages to make the best of things.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;Percy&quot; was the 8th most popular film at the British box office in 1971. By June 1972, it had earned EMI a profit of £43,000. Eventually, according to Nat Cohen, it made a profit of £500,000.

<doc id="163778" wikidata="Q190117" url="?curid=163778" title="Automotive industry">
<text>The automotive industry comprises a wide range of companies and organizations involved in the design, development, manufacturing, marketing, selling, repairing, and modification of motor vehicles. It is one of the world&#x27;s largest industries by revenue (from 16% such as in France up to 40% in countries such as Slovakia).

The word &quot;automotive&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;autos&quot; (self), and Latin &quot;motivus&quot; (of motion), referring to any form of self-powered vehicle. This term, as proposed by Elmer Sperry (1860–1930), first came into use to describe automobiles in 1898.

== History ==


The automotive industry began in the 1860s with hundreds of manufacturers pioneering the horseless carriage. Early car manufacturing involved manual assembly by a human worker. The process evolved from engineers working on a stationary car to a conveyor belt system where the car passed through multiple stations of more specialized engineers. In the 1960s, robotic equipment was introduced, and most cars are now mainly assembled by automated machinery.

For many decades, the United States led the world in total automobile production, with the U.S. Big Three General Motors, Ford Motor Company, and Chrysler being the world&#x27;s three largest auto manufacturers for a time, and G.M. and Ford remaining the two largest until the mid-2000s. In 1929, before the Great Depression, the world had 32,028,500 automobiles in use, of which the U.S. automobile enterprises produced more than 90%. At that time, the U.S. had one car per 4.87 persons. After 1945, the U.S. produced around three-quarters of the world&#x27;s auto production. In 1980, the U.S. was overtaken by Japan and then became a world leader again in 1994. Japan narrowly passed the U.S. in production during 2006 and 2007, and in 2008 also China, which in 2009 took the top spot (from Japan) with 13.8 million units, although the U.S. surpassed Japan in 2011, to become the second-largest automobile industry. In 2023, China had more than 30 million produced vehicles a year for the first time in history, after reaching 29 million for the first time in 2017 and 28 million the year before. From 1970 (140 models) to 1998 (260 models) to 2012 (684 models), the number of automobile models in the U.S. has grown exponentially.

==Safety==


Safety is a state that implies being protected from any risk, danger, damage, or cause of injury. In the automotive industry, safety means that users, operators, or manufacturers do not face any risk or danger coming from the motor vehicle or its spare parts. Safety for the automobiles themselves implies that there is no risk of damage.

Safety in the automotive industry is particularly important and therefore highly regulated. Automobiles and other motor vehicles have to comply with a certain number of regulations, whether local or international, in order to be accepted on the market. The standard ISO 26262, is considered one of the best practice frameworks for achieving automotive functional safety.

In case of safety issues, danger, product defect, or faulty procedure during the manufacturing of the motor vehicle, the maker can request to return either a batch or the entire production run. This procedure is called product recall. Product recalls happen in every industry and can be production-related or stem from raw materials.

Product and operation tests and inspections at different stages of the value chain are made to avoid these product recalls by ensuring end-user security and safety and compliance with the automotive industry requirements. However, the automotive industry is still particularly concerned about product recalls, which cause considerable financial consequences.

==Economy==

In 2007, there were about 806 million cars and light trucks on the road, consuming over of gasoline and diesel fuel yearly. The automobile is a primary mode of transportation for many developed economies. The Detroit branch of Boston Consulting Group predicted that, by 2014, one-third of world demand would be in the four BRIC markets (Brazil, Russia, India, and China). Meanwhile, in developed countries, the automotive industry has slowed. It is also expected that this trend will continue, especially as the younger generations of people (in highly urbanized countries) no longer want to own a car, and prefer other modes of transport. Other potentially powerful automotive markets are Iran and Indonesia.
Emerging automobile markets already buy more cars than established markets. 

According to a J.D. Power study, emerging markets accounted for 51 percent of the global light-vehicle sales in 2010. The study, performed in 2010 expected this trend to accelerate. However, more recent reports (2012) confirmed the opposite; namely that the automotive industry was slowing down even in BRIC countries. In the United States, vehicle sales peaked in 2000, at 17.8 million units.

In July 2021, the European Commission released its &quot;Fit for 55&quot; legislation package, which contains important guidelines for the future of the automotive industry; all new cars on the European market must be zero-emission vehicles from 2035.

The governments of 24 developed countries and a group of major car manufacturers including GM, Ford, Volvo, BYD Auto, Jaguar Land Rover and Mercedes-Benz committed to &quot;work towards all sales of new cars and vans being zero emission globally by 2040, and by no later than 2035 in leading markets&quot;. Major car manufacturing nations like the United States, Germany, China, Japan and South Korea, as well as Volkswagen, Toyota, Peugeot, Honda, Nissan and Hyundai, did not pledge.

==Environmental impacts==

The global automotive industry is a major consumer of water. Some estimates surpass of water per car manufactured, depending on whether tyre production is included. Production processes that use a significant volume of water include surface treatment, painting, coating, washing, cooling, air-conditioning, and boilers, not counting component manufacturing. Paintshop operations consume especially large amounts of water because equipment running on water-based products must also be cleaned with water.

In 2022, Tesla&#x27;s Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg ran into legal challenges due to droughts and falling groundwater levels in the region. Brandenburg&#x27;s Economy Minister Joerg Steinbach said that while water supply was sufficient during the first stage, more would be needed once Tesla expands the site. The factory would nearly double the water consumption in the Gruenheide area, with 1.4 million cubic meters being contracted from local authorities per year — enough for a city of around 40,000 people. Steinbach said that the authorities would like to drill for more water there and outsource any additional supply if necessary.

<text>Guarino Veronese or Guarino da Verona (1374 – 14 December 1460) was an Italian classical scholar, humanist, and translator of ancient Greek texts during the Renaissance. In the republics of Florence and Venice he studied under Manuel Chrysoloras ( 1350–1415), renowned professor of Greek and ambassador of the Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, the first scholar to hold such courses in medieval Italy.

==Biography==
He was born in Verona, medieval Italy, and later studied Greek language and literature in Constantinople, at the time capital of the Byzantine Empire, where for five years he was the pupil of the renowned Byzantine Greek scholar, Renaissance humanist, and professor Manuel Chrysoloras. When he set out to return home, he had with him two cases of precious manuscripts of ancient Greek texts which he had taken great pains to collect. It is said that the loss of one of these by shipwreck caused him such distress that his hair turned grey in a single night. On arriving back in Italy, he earned a living as a teacher of Greek, first in Verona and afterwards in Venice and Florence.

In 1436, he became a professor of Greek in Ferrara through the patronage of Leonello, Marquis of Este. His method of instruction was renowned and it attracted many students from Italy and the rest of medieval Europe as distant as the Kingdom of England. Many of them, notably the Italian Renaissance humanist and teacher Vittorino da Feltre, afterwards became well-known scholars and, as Vittorino would later, would support poor students from his funds. From 1438 on, he served as an interpreter for the Byzantine Greek participants at the ecumenical councils of Ferrara and Florence (1431–1449). He was particularly influenced by the Byzantine Greek scholar and philosopher Gemistus Pletho. He died in Ferrara in 1460.

His principal works are translations of Strabo and of some of the &quot;Lives&quot; of Plutarch, a compendium of the Greek grammar of Chrysoloras, and a series of commentaries on Persius, Martial, the Satires of Juvenal, and some of the writings of Aristotle and Cicero. The layout of the Studiolo of the Palazzo Belfiore is also attributed to him. He corresponded with the writer and humanist Isotta Nogarola.

<text>Manuel (or Emmanuel) Chrysoloras (; c. 1350 – 15 April 1415) was a Byzantine Greek classical scholar, humanist, philosopher, professor, and translator of ancient Greek texts during the Renaissance. Serving as the ambassador for the Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos in medieval Italy, he became a renowned teacher of Greek literature and history in the republics of Florence and Venice, and today he&#x27;s widely regarded as a pioneer in the introduction of ancient Greek literature to Western Europe during the Late Middle Ages.

==Biography==
Chrysoloras was born in Constantinople, at the time capital of the Byzantine Empire, to a distinguished Greek Orthodox family. In 1390, he led an embassy sent to the Republic of Venice by the Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos to ask the aid of the Christian princes of Medieval Europe against the invasions of the Byzantine Empire by the Muslim Ottoman Turks. Roberto de&#x27; Rossi of Florence met him in Venice, and, in 1395, Rossi&#x27;s acquaintance Jacopo d&#x27;Angelo set off for Constantinople to study Greek with Chrysoloras. In 1396, Coluccio Salutati, the Chancellor of Florence, invited him to Florence to teach Greek grammar and literature. In a letter to Poggio Bracciolini, quoting the Roman lawyer and statesman Cicero, Salutati wrote:
:&quot;The verdict of our own Cicero confirms that we Romans either made wiser innovations than theirs by ourselves or improved on what we took from them, but of course, as he himself says elsewhere with reference to his own day: &quot;Italy is invincible in war, Greece in culture.&quot; For our part, and we mean no offence, we firmly believe that both Greeks and Latins have always taken learning to a higher level by extending it to each other&#x27;s literature.&quot;
Chrysoloras arrived in the winter of 1397, an event remembered by one of his most famous pupils, the Italian humanist scholar Leonardo Bruni, as a great new opportunity: there were many teachers of law, but no one had studied Greek in northern Italy for 700 years. Another very famous pupil of Chrysoloras was Ambrogio Traversari, who became general of the Camaldolese order. Chrysoloras remained only a few years in Florence, from 1397 to 1400, teaching Greek, starting with the rudiments. He moved on to teach in Bologna, and later in Venice and Rome. Though he taught widely, a handful of his chosen students remained a close-knit group, among the first humanists of the Renaissance. Among his pupils were numbered some of the foremost figures of the revival of Greek studies in Renaissance Italy. Aside from Bruni, d&#x27;Angelo, and Ambrogio Traversari, they included Guarino da Verona, Coluccio Salutati, Roberto Rossi, Niccolò de&#x27; Niccoli, Carlo Marsuppini, Pier Paolo Vergerio, Uberto Decembrio, Palla Strozzi, and many others.

Having visited Milan and Pavia, and having resided for several years in Venice, he went to Rome on the invitation of Bruni, who was then secretary to Pope Gregory XII. In 1408, he was sent to Paris on an important mission from the Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos. In 1413, he went to Germany on an embassy to the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, the object of which was to fix a place for the church council that later assembled at Constance. Chrysoloras was on his way there, having been chosen to represent the Greek Church, when he died suddenly. His death gave rise to commemorative essays of which Guarino da Verona made a collection in &quot;Chrysolorina&quot;.

Chrysoloras translated the works of Homer, Aristotle, and Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; into Latin. His own works, which circulated in manuscript in his lifetime, include brief works on the Procession of the Holy Ghost, and letters to his brothers, to Bruni, Guarino, Traversari, and to Strozzi, as well as two which were eventually printed, his &quot;Erotemata&quot; (&quot;Questions&quot;) which was the first basic Greek grammar in use in Western Europe, first published in 1484 and widely reprinted, and which enjoyed considerable success not only among his pupils in Florence, but also among later leading humanists, being immediately studied by Thomas Linacre at Oxford and by Desiderius Erasmus at Cambridge; and &quot;Epistolæ tres de comparatione veteris et novæ Romæ&quot; (&quot;Three Letters on the Comparison of Old and New Rome,&quot; i.e. a comparison of Rome and Constantinople). Many of his treatises on morals and ethics and other philosophical subjects came into print in the 17th and 18th centuries, because of their antiquarian interest. He was chiefly influential through his teaching in familiarizing men such as Leonardo Bruni, Coluccio Salutati, Jacopo d&#x27;Angelo, Roberto de&#x27; Rossi, Carlo Marsuppini, Pietro Candido Decembrio, Guarino da Verona, with the masterpieces of Western philosophy and ancient Greek literature.

<text>Skid Row were an Irish blues rock band of the late 1960s and early 1970s, based in Dublin and fronted by bass guitarist Brendan &quot;Brush&quot; Shiels. It was the first band in which Phil Lynott and Gary Moore played professionally before finding greater fame with Thin Lizzy.

==History==
===Origins===
The band was formed in August 1967, comprising Brendan &#x27;Brush&#x27; Shiels on bass guitar, Noel &#x27;Nollaig&#x27; Bridgeman on drums, Bernard &quot;Ben&quot; Cheevers on guitar, and Phil Lynott on vocals. Shiels and Cheevers had played together in a number of groups in Dublin before forming Skid Row. The band&#x27;s first gig was in September 1967 in a basement club in Lower Abbey Street in Dublin 1.
Cheevers left the band in September 1968 to continue working full-time in the electrical industry. Before his departure, the search for a suitably proficient guitarist resulted in Gary Moore joining the band as a fifth member. Moore and Cheevers both played in the band for a short &#x27;hand-over&#x27; period. Robbie Brennan temporarily replaced original drummer Bridgeman until June 1969 and Cheevers was replaced by the 16-year-old Gary Moore in mid 1968, and the band recorded a single, &quot;New Places, Old Faces&quot; / &quot;Misdemeanour Dream Felicity&quot;, for the Irish Song Records label (the only released recording of Lynott with Skid Row).

Later that year Shiels dropped Lynott from the line-up, converting Skid Row to a power trio by making himself the lead vocalist. By way of compensation, Shiels gave him a bass guitar he had bought from former musician Robert Ballagh for £49 in 1967 while with the Uptown Band, he taught Lynott to play bass and, after a stint with &#x27;Orphanage&#x27;, Lynott went on to international fame as founder, bassist and vocalist for Thin Lizzy. The band recorded a second single for &#x27;Song&#x27;, &quot;Saturday Morning Man&quot; / &quot;Mervyn Aldridge&quot;. These two singles, plus three tracks from a BBC recording, were issued on the &#x27;Hux&#x27; label as &quot;Live and on Song&quot; in April 2006. At the end of 2006 a number of Skid Row demo tapes featuring Phil Lynott were discovered. These were his earliest recordings (from 1968) and had been presumed lost for decades.

===&quot;Skid&quot; and &quot;34 Hours&quot;===
With the returning Bridgeman, Skid Row played support to some of the great rock groups of the 1960s, including Fleetwood Mac in January 1970. Moore was influenced by the Fleetwood Mac guitarist Peter Green, who was in turn impressed by Moore&#x27;s guitar playing and introduced him to the Columbia/CBS record company. A third single, &quot;Sandie&#x27;s Gone (Part 1)&quot; / &quot;Sandie&#x27;s Gone (Part 2)&quot;, was released on the band&#x27;s new label in April 1970, and a number of sessions and concerts were also recorded for the BBC during this period. The band released its first album &quot;Skid&quot;, in October 1970. A second LP, &quot;34 Hours&quot; – so called because it took them a mere 34 hours to record it – was released in early 1971, preceded by the single &quot;Night Of The Warm Witch&quot; / &quot;Mr. De-Luxe&quot;. Skid Row performed on the legendary German TV music show &quot;Beat Club&quot; on 18 March 1971. There were short tours of Europe (October 1970, with Canned Heat) and of the USA (October/November 1970 and August and October 1971). A widely bootlegged show billed as &quot;The Whiskey, Los Angeles, August 5, 1970&quot;, and featuring John Bonham as a guest, is more likely from August 1971. A third album was recorded in the Autumn of 1971 but Moore left the band in December 1971 just before another planned US tour. He was temporarily replaced by Eric Bell (from Thin Lizzy) for some live appearances before Paul Chapman became the band&#x27;s full-time guitarist. Moore later played with Thin Lizzy, replacing Eric Bell. Chapman overdubbed Moore&#x27;s guitar tracks on the unreleased album but neither version was made public for almost twenty years. As the band faltered, Chapman left in July 1972 (later joining UFO). Shiels then teamed with drummer John Wilson (ex-Them, Taste and Stud) and future Sparks guitarist Adrian Fisher to form a band named simply &#x27;Brush&#x27;.

===Changing lineups===
Skid Row reformed in Ireland in 1973, initially with Shiels, Wilson, singer Eamonn Gibney (ex-Alyce) and guitarist Ed Deane, later adding keyboard player Kevin McAlea. Gibney would later join Colm Wilkinson and Helen Jordan to sing as The Dajacs at the 1980 Irish final for the Eurovision Song Contest placing 7th. Shiels/Deane/Wilson line-up released the single &quot;Dublin City Angels&quot; / &quot;Slow Down&quot;. John Wilson was replaced by Paddy Freeney before the band split again in early 1974. For the next few months Shiels played in the &#x27;Bell-Brush Band&#x27; with Eric Bell and Timmy Creedon (drums, ex-Orphanage), sometimes joined by Eamonn Gibney. At the end of the year Shiels, Moore and Bridgeman briefly reunited for a series of gigs, and a 1975 line-up of Shiels (guitar/vocals), Bridgeman, Jimi Slevin (lead guitar/vocals, ex-Alyce, ex-Peggy&#x27;s Leg) (born June 1950, Dublin), Timmy Creedon (second drummer/vocals) and Johann Brady (bass) recorded the Skid Row single &quot;The Spanish Lady&quot; / &quot;Elvira&quot;. In 1976 Jody Pollard (guitar, ex-Elmer Fudd) replaced Pat O&#x27;Farrell in a line-up with Shiels (vocals/mandolin), Bridgeman (drums), John Brady (bass) and Dave Gaynor (drums), recording the Phil Lynott-produced double A-sided single &quot;Coming Home Again&quot; / &quot;Fight Your Heart Out&quot; and unreleased track &quot;Skid Row Flashback&quot;. The 1976 double-disc live album of Rock n&#x27; Roll standards &quot;Alive And Kickin&quot; featured Shiels, Bridgeman, Brady, Pollard, Gaynor and Ian Anderson. In 1978 Pollard rejoined, this time replacing Eric Bell alongside Shiels, Bridgeman, Brady and Joe Staunton (guitar, ex-Orphanage).

===Legacy===

Skid Row had little commercial success outside Ireland and the UK, although &quot;Skid&quot; reached No.30 on the UK Albums Chart. More of their recorded material was released between 1990 and 2006.

Phil Lynott died of septicaemia in January 1986, John Brady was killed in a car accident on 15 February 1993, and Gary Moore died from a heart attack in February 2011. Noel Bridgeman went on to perform studio work with Clannad, The Waterboys and Altan and was part of Irish folk singer Mary Black&#x27;s band in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He died in March 2021. 

Shiels still occasionally performs as &#x27;Brush Shiels&#x27; Skid Row&#x27;, as recently as February 2005.

Brush Shiels returned to his Skid Row legacy once more releasing &quot;Mad Dog Woman&quot; (originally titled &quot;Skid Row Revisited&quot;) – an album of new material and re-recordings of Skid Row songs – through his website in June 2009. He also thanked the other Skid Row &quot;for the generosity of spirit in acknowledging the contribution of the original Skid Row&quot; by using the name. In January 2012 Shiels issued a public request to Jon Bon Jovi via YouTube to contact him about the use of the name &#x27;Skid Row&#x27;. This was connected to Shiels having recently recovered the rights to his own songs recorded with the original Skid Row.

It was reported that in 1987, Jon Bon Jovi asked Gary Moore to sell the name &#x27;Skid Row&#x27; to the American heavy metal band for $35,000 (Bon Jovi part-owns the music publishing rights of this band). Lead singer Sebastian Bach recalled,

However, Shiels maintains that Moore simply referred the band to Shiels to discuss the rights to the name, but that it was never followed up.

They were managed in the 1970s by Oliver Byrne.

<text>Industrial Records is a record label established in 1976 by industrial music and visual arts group Throbbing Gristle. The group created the label primarily for self-releases but also signed several other groups and artists. The label gave a name to the industrial music genre.

==Background==
Artists released through the label included Cabaret Voltaire, Clock DVA, SPK, Thomas Leer &amp; Robert Rental, The Leather Nun, plus &quot;outrage&quot; artist Monte Cazazza, the author William S. Burroughs&#x27; auditory works, and a solo album by Throbbing Gristle member Chris Carter.

A notable departure from the &quot;industrial&quot; form of the label was the blues standard &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; sung by Elisabeth Welch, taken from the soundtrack of Derek Jarman&#x27;s film &quot;The Tempest&quot;.

The label&#x27;s first LP was Throbbing Gristle&#x27;s debut LP &quot;The Second Annual Report,&quot; which was limited to 786 copies. It came in bootleg-like packaging: a plain white card sleeve with glued-on xerox information strips.

The Industrial Records logo is a stark black and white depiction a low-definition photo of an Auschwitz crematory.

In 2011, the label had an official &quot;re-activation&quot; as Throbbing Gristle&#x27;s contract with Mute Records had expired. Since the band has permanently disbanded following the death of Sleazy, the label&#x27;s plan is to re-release the original Throbbing Gristle albums (&quot;The Second Annual Report&quot;, &quot;D.o.A: The Third and Final Report&quot;, &quot;20 Jazz Funk Greats&quot;, &quot;Heathen Earth&quot;, and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;) on the label. Originally intended to be released all at once on 26 September 2011, the label had to delay due to a Sony DADC warehouse fire in London. The new plan was to release a new album chronologically once every week starting on Halloween 2011 with The Second Annual Report and ending 28 November with Throbbing Gristle&#x27;s Greatest Hits.

There has been no comment on releasing any other artists&#x27; works or new content after the Throbbing Gristle releases.

<text>Maurizio Costanzo (28 August 1938 – 24 February 2023) was an Italian television host, journalist, screenwriter, and film director.

==Biography==
Costanzo began his career as a journalist, first as a contributing writer to &quot;Paese Sera&quot; and then as managing editor of the weekly &quot;Grazia&quot;. In the late 1970s, he was the founding editor of the newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Occhio&quot;. Parallel to his career as a journalist, he worked as a radio and TV host, where he became known for his subtle, low-profile irony. His most popular show, &quot;Bontà loro&quot; was a staple of RAI&#x27;s programming but he was forced to resign after news broke that he was a member of the Propaganda Due masonic lodge. Costanzo then moved to Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s main TV station Canale 5, where he hosted the &quot;Maurizio Costanzo Show&quot;. It was the first Italiano talk show. The program worked as a talent scout and launched many Italian artists and showmen (like Alessandro Bergonzoni, Dario Vergassola, Walter Nudo, Daniele Luttazzi, Ricky Memphis, David Riondino, Stefano Nosei, Nick Novecento, Claudio Bisio, Platinette, and Enzo Iacchetti), contributing to the popularity of as many others (like Valerio Mastandrea, Giobbe Covatta, Enrico Brignano, Giampiero Mughini, and Afef Jnifen.

Costanzo was the artistic director of Canale 5 until 2009. In 2010 he returned to RAI, presenting the talk show &quot;Bontà sua&quot;. Since 2011 he also collaborated with Radio Manà Manà.

Costanzo was the &quot;&quot; (an aesthetical and rhetorical consultant for public appearances) of many Italian political leaders. He was a professor at the Università degli Studi Niccolò Cusano.

Costanzo also wrote screenplays for several films. In 1977 he wrote and directed his first and to this day, last film, &quot;Melodrammore&quot;. In 1966 he co-wrote the lyrics of the song &quot;Se telefonando&quot;, which was popularized by Mina.

On 14 May 1993, Costanzo, who had expressed delight at the arrest of Sicilian Mafia boss Salvatore Riina, was almost killed by a bomb as he drove down a Rome street; 23 people were injured.

==Personal life and death==
Costanzo was married four times. In 1963 he married Lori Sammartino, a journalist and photographer fourteen years his senior. He later married another journalist, Flaminia Morando, who left her husband Alberto Michelini for Costanzo. Costanzo and Morando had two children: Camilla (born 1973) and Saverio (born 1975); they divorced in the late 1970s. From 1983 to 1986 Costanzo lived with the actress, voice actress, screenwriter and director Simona Izzo. On 7 June 1989, he married the TV presenter Marta Flavi, but they separated in December 1990 and divorced in 1995. On his 57th birthday, 28 August 1995, Costanzo married Maria De Filippi, a television host and producer, who had been living with him since 1990. In 2004, the couple adopted a 12-year-old boy. Maurizio Costanzo has a strong connection to the village of Ansedonia, in the province of Grosseto, where he had a residence for decades and spent his holidays there together with Maria de Filippi.

Costanzo died on 24 February 2023 at the private clinic Paideia of Rome at the age of 84. His funeral was officiated on 27 February 2023 in the Basilica of Santa Maria in Montesanto in Rome, after which he was buried in the Campo Verano cemetery.

<doc id="163805" wikidata="Q135321" url="?curid=163805" title="Famicom Disk System">
<text>The commonly shortened to the Famicom Disk System, or just Disk System, is a peripheral for Nintendo&#x27;s Family Computer home video game console, released in Japan on February 21, 1986. It uses proprietary floppy disks called &quot;Disk Cards&quot; for cheaper data storage and it adds a new high-fidelity sound channel for supporting Disk System games.

Fundamentally, the Disk System serves simply to enhance some aspects already inherent to the base Famicom system, with better sound and cheaper games though with the disadvantages of high initial price, slow speed, and lower reliability. However, this boost to the market of affordable and writable mass storage temporarily served as an enabling technology for the creation of new types of video games. This includes the vast, open world, progress-saving adventures of the best-selling &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; (1986) and &quot;Metroid&quot; (1986), games with a cost-effective and swift release such as the best-selling &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;, and nationwide leaderboards and contests via the in-store Disk Fax kiosks, which are considered to be forerunners of today&#x27;s online achievement and distribution systems.

By 1989, the Famicom Disk System was inevitably obsoleted by the improving semiconductor technology of game cartridges. The Disk System&#x27;s lifetime sales reached 4.4 million units by 1990, making it the most successful console add-on of all time, despite not being sold outside of Japan. Its final game was released in 1992, its software was discontinued in 2003, and Nintendo officially discontinued its technical support in 2007.

==History==
By January 1985, Nintendo&#x27;s Family Computer was dominating the Japanese home video game market, selling over three million units within a year and a half. Because of its success, the company had difficulty with keeping up demand for new stock, often getting flooded with calls from retailers asking for more systems. Retailers also requested for cheaper games; the cost of chips and semiconductors made cartridges expensive to make, and often cost a lot of money for both stores and consumers to purchase. Chip shortages also created supply issues. To satisfy these requests, Nintendo began thinking of ways to potentially lower the cost of games. Later in July of that year, Hudson Soft approached and pitched them a new add-on for the Famicom that played games using their patented Bee Cards, which was experimented on the MSX computer. Nintendo liked this concept, as it had the ability to store full games and overwrite existing ones. However, as the technology for it was expensive, and that they would have to pay royalties for each card sold, Nintendo instead decided to pass on Hudson Soft&#x27;s proposal. Continuing their research, Nintendo turned towards the home computer market for inspiration; They specifically looked to floppy disks which were quickly becoming the standard for storage media for personal computers. Floppy disks were cheap to produce and rewritable, allowing games to be easily produced during the manufacturing process. Seeing its potential, Nintendo began work on a disk-based peripheral for the Famicom.

For its proprietary diskette platform, which they dubbed the &quot;Disk Card&quot;, Nintendo chose to base it on Mitsumi&#x27;s Quick Disk media format, a cheaper alternative to floppy disks for Japanese home computers. The Disk Card format presented a number of advantages over cartridges, such as increased storage capacity that allowed for larger games, additional sound channels, and the ability to save player progress. The add-on itself was produced by Masayuki Uemura and Nintendo Research &amp; Development 2, the same team that designed the Famicom itself. Following several delays, the Famicom Disk System was released on February 21, 1986, at a retail price of ¥15000 (US$80). The same day, Nintendo released &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; as a launch title, alongside disk re-releases of earlier Famicom games. Marketing material for the Disk System featured a yellow mascot character named Diskun, or Mr. Disk. The Famicom Disk System sold over 300,000 units within three months, jumping to over 2 million by the end of the year. Nintendo remained confident the Disk System would be a sure-fire success, and ensured that all future first-party releases would be exclusive to the peripheral.
Coinciding with the Disk System&#x27;s release, Nintendo installed several &quot;Disk Writer&quot; kiosks in various toy and electronic stores across the country. These kiosks allowed customers to bring in their disk games and have a new game rewritten onto them for a ¥500 fee; blank disks could also be purchased for ¥2000. Nintendo then decided to make an early form of online gaming; In 1987, they introduced special high-score tournaments for specific Disk System games, where players could submit their scores directly to Nintendo via &quot;Disk Fax&quot; machines found in retail stores. Winners would receive exclusive prizes, including Famicom-branded stationery sets and a gold-colored &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; cartridge. Nintendo of America announced plans to release the Disk System for the Famicom&#x27;s international counterpart, the Nintendo Entertainment System, and began filing patents simultaneously. However, by the time these were approved in November 1988, Nintendo cancelled their plans to release the system stateside.

Despite the Famicom Disk System&#x27;s success and advantages over the Famicom itself, it also imposed many problems of its own. Most common was the quality of the Disk Cards; Nintendo removed the shutters on most Disk System games to reduce costs, instead placing them in a wax sleeve and clear plastic shell. The disks themselves are fragile, and the lack of a shutter made them collect dust and fingerprints, eventually rendering them unplayable as a result. Piracy was also rampant, with disk copying devices and bootleg games becoming commonplace in stores and in magazine advertisements. Third-party developers for the Disk System were also angered towards Nintendo&#x27;s strict licensing terms, requiring that it receive 50% copyright ownership of any and all software released — this led to several major developers, such as Namco and Hudson Soft, refusing to produce games for it. Four months after the Disk System was released, Capcom released a Famicom conversion of &quot;Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins&quot; on a 128k cartridge - larger than the Disk Card&#x27;s 112k capacity - which, as a result, made consumers and developers less impressed with the Disk System&#x27;s technological features. Retailers disliked the Disk Writer kiosks for taking up too much space and for generally being unprofitable. The Disk System&#x27;s vague error messages, long loading times, and the poor quality of the rubber drive belt that spun the disks are also cited as attributing to its downfall.

By 1989, advancements in technology made cartridge games much cheaper and easier to produce, leaving the Famicom Disk System obsolete. Retailers were critical of Nintendo simply abandoning the Disk Writers and leaving stores with large kiosks that took up vital space, while companies began to release or move their games from the Disk System to a standard cartridge; towards the end of development, Square ported &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; over to the Famicom as a cartridge game, with its own battery backup save feature. Nintendo officially discontinued the Famicom Disk System in 1990, selling around 4.4 million units total. Disk writing services were still kept in operation until September 30, 2003, while technical services were provided up until October 31, 2007.

===Hardware versions===

Sharp released the Twin Famicom, a Famicom model that features a built-in Disk System.

===Disk Writer and Disk Fax kiosks===
Widespread copyright violation in Japan&#x27;s predominantly personal-computer-based game rental market inspired corporations to petition the government to ban the rental of all video games in 1984. With games then being available only via full purchase, demand rose for a new and less expensive way to access more games. In 1986, as video gaming had increasingly expanded from computers into the video game console market, Nintendo advertised a promise to install 10,000 Famicom Disk Writer kiosks in toy and hobby stores across Japan within one year. These jukebox style stations allowed users to copy from a rotating stock of the latest games to their disks and keep each one for an unlimited time. To write an existing disk with a new game from the available roster was (then about and 1/6 of the price of many new games). Instruction sheets were given by the retailer, or available by mail order for . Some game releases, such as &quot;Kaette Kita Mario Bros.&quot;, were exclusive to these kiosks.

In 1987, Disk Writer kiosks in select locations were also provisioned as Disk Fax systems as Nintendo&#x27;s first online concept. Players could take advantage of the dynamic rewritability of blue floppy disk versions of Disk System games (such as &quot;Famicom Grand Prix: F1 Race&quot; and &quot;Golf Japan Course&quot;) in order to save their high scores at their leisure at home, and then bring the disk to a retailer&#x27;s Disk Fax kiosk, which collated and transmitted the players&#x27; scores via fax to Nintendo. Players participated in a nationwide leaderboard, with unique prizes.

The kiosk service was very popular and remained available until 2003. In subsequent console generations, Nintendo would relaunch this online national leaderboard concept with the home satellite-based Satellaview subscription service in Japan from 1995 to 2000 for the Super Famicom. It would relaunch the model of games downloadable to rewritable portable media from store kiosks, with the Nintendo Power service in Japan which is based on rewritable flash media cartridges for the Super Famicom and Game Boy from 1997 to 2007.

Calling the Disk Writer &quot;one of the coolest things Nintendo ever created&quot;, Kotaku says modern &quot;digital distribution could learn from [the Disk Writer]&quot;, and that the system&#x27;s premise of game rental and achievements would still be innovative in today&#x27;s retail and online stores. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; said it &quot;was truly ground-breaking for its time and could be considered a forerunner of more modern distribution methods [such as] Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and Steam&quot;.

==Technology==
The device is connected to the Famicom console by plugging its RAM Adapter cartridge into the system&#x27;s cartridge port, and attaching that cartridge&#x27;s cable to the disk drive. The RAM Adapter contains 32 kilobytes (KB) of RAM for temporarily caching program data from disk, 8 KB of RAM for tile and sprite data storage, and an ASIC named the 2C33. The ASIC acts as a disk controller, plus single-cycle wavetable-lookup synthesizer sound hardware. Finally, embedded in the 2C33 is an 8KB BIOS ROM. The Disk Cards used are double-sided, with a total capacity of 112 KB per disk. Many games span both sides of a disk and a few span multiple disks, requiring the user to switch at some point during gameplay. The Disk System is capable of running on six C-cell batteries or the supplied AC adapter. Batteries usually last five months with daily game play. The inclusion of a battery option is due to the likelihood of a standard set of AC plugs already being occupied by a Famicom and a television.

The Disk System&#x27;s Disk Cards are somewhat proprietary 71 mm × 76 mm (2.8 × 3 in) 56K-per-side double-sided floppy. They are a slight modification of Mitsumi&#x27;s Quick Disk 71 mm 2.8 in square disk format which is used in a handful of Japanese computers and various synthesizer keyboards, along with a few word processors. QuickDisk drives are in a few devices in Europe and North America. Mitsumi already had close relations with Nintendo, as it manufactured the Famicom and NES consoles, and possibly other Nintendo hardware.

Modifications to the standard Quick Disk format include the &quot;NINTENDO&quot; moulding along the bottom of each Disk Card. In addition to branding the disk, this acts as a rudimentary form of copy protection - a device inside the drive bay contains raised protrusions which fit into their recessed counterparts, ostensibly ensuring that only official disks are used. If a disk without these recessed areas is inserted, the protrusions cannot raise, and the system will not allow the game to be loaded. This was combined with technical measures in the way data was stored on the disk to prevent users from physically swapping copied disk media into an official shell. However, both of these measures were defeated by pirate game distributors; in particular, special disks with cutouts alongside simple devices to modify standard Quick Disks were produced to defeat the physical hardware check, enabling rampant piracy. An advertisement containing a guide for a simple modification to a Quick Disk to allow its use with a Famicom Disk System was printed in at least one magazine.

==Games==

There are about 200 games in the Famicom Disk System&#x27;s library. Some are FDS exclusives, some are Disk Writer exclusives, and many were re-released years later on the cartridge format such as &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; for NES in 1987, and for Famicom in 1994. The most notable FDS originals include &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot;, &quot;Kid Icarus&quot;, &quot;Metroid&quot;, and &quot;Akumajō Dracula&quot; (&quot;Castlevania&quot;).

Square had a branch called Disk Original Group, a software label that published Disk System games from Japanese PC software companies. The venture was largely a failure and almost pushed a pre-&quot;Final Fantasy&quot; Square into bankruptcy. &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; was to be released for the FDS, but a disagreement over Nintendo&#x27;s copyright policies caused Square to change its position and release the game as a cartridge.

Nintendo released a disk version of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; in addition to the cartridge version. The Western-market &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; originated from a disk-only game called &quot;Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic&quot;.

Nintendo utilized the cheaper and more dynamic disk medium for a Disk Writer exclusive, as an early advergame. &quot;Kaettekita Mario Bros.&quot; (lit. The Return of Mario Bros.) is a remastered version of &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; with enhanced jump controls and high score saving, plus a new slot machine minigame co-branded for the Nagatanien food company.

The final FDS game release was &quot;Janken Disk Jō&quot; in December 1992, a rock paper scissors game featuring the Disk System mascot, Disk-kun.

==Legacy==
The Famicom Disk System briefly served as an enabling technology for the creation of a new wave of home console video games and a new type of video game experience, mostly due to tripling the size of cheap game storage compared to affordable cartridge ROMs, and by storing gamers&#x27; progress within their vast new adventures. These games include the open world design and enduring series launches of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; and &quot;Metroid&quot; (both 1986), with its launch game &quot;Zelda&quot; becoming very popular and leading to sequels which are considered some of the greatest games of all time. Almost one decade ahead of Nintendo&#x27;s Satellaview service, the FDS&#x27;s writable and portable storage technology served as an enabling technology for the innovation of online leaderboards and contests via the in-store Disk Fax kiosks, which are now seen as the earliest forerunners of modern online gaming and distribution.

Within its library of 200 original games, some are FDS-exclusive and many were re-released one or two years later on cartridges for Famicom and NES, though without the FDS&#x27;s additional sound channel.

<text>An oil platform (also called an oil rig, offshore platform, oil production platform, etc.) is a large structure with facilities to extract and process petroleum and natural gas that lie in rock formations beneath the seabed. Many oil platforms will also have facilities to accommodate the workers, although it is also common to have a separate accommodation platform linked by bridge to the production platform. Most commonly, oil platforms engage in activities on the continental shelf, though they can also be used in lakes, inshore waters, and inland seas. Depending on the circumstances, the platform may be fixed to the ocean floor, consist of an artificial island, or float. In some arrangements the main facility may have storage facilities for the processed oil. Remote subsea wells may also be connected to a platform by flow lines and by umbilical connections. These sub-sea facilities may include one or more subsea wells or manifold centres for multiple wells.

Offshore drilling presents environmental challenges, both from the produced hydrocarbons and the materials used during the drilling operation. Controversies include the ongoing US offshore drilling debate.

There are many different types of facilities from which offshore drilling operations take place. These include bottom-founded drilling rigs (jackup barges and swamp barges), combined drilling and production facilities, either bottom-founded or floating platforms, and deepwater mobile offshore drilling units (MODU), including semi-submersibles and drillships. These are capable of operating in water depths up to . In shallower waters, the mobile units are anchored to the seabed. However, in deeper water (more than ), the semisubmersibles or drillships are maintained at the required drilling location using dynamic positioning.

==History==
Jan Józef Ignacy Łukasiewicz (; 8 March 1822 – 7 January 1882) was a Polish pharmacist, engineer, businessman, inventor, and philanthropist. He was one of the most prominent philanthropists in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, crown land of Austria-Hungary. He was a pioneer who in 1856 built the world&#x27;s first modern oil refinery

Around 1891, the first submerged oil wells were drilled from platforms built on piles in the fresh waters of the Grand Lake St. Marys (a.k.a. Mercer County Reservoir) in Ohio. The wide but shallow reservoir was built from 1837 to 1845 to provide water to the Miami and Erie Canal.

Around 1896, the first submerged oil wells in salt water were drilled in the portion of the Summerland field extending under the Santa Barbara Channel in California. The wells were drilled from piers extending from land out into the channel.

Other notable early submerged drilling activities occurred on the Canadian side of Lake Erie since 1913 and Caddo Lake in Louisiana in the 1910s. Shortly thereafter, wells were drilled in tidal zones along the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana. The Goose Creek field near Baytown, Texas, is one such example. In the 1920s, drilling was done from concrete platforms in Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela.

The oldest offshore well recorded in Infield&#x27;s offshore database is the Bibi Eibat well which came on stream in 1923 in Azerbaijan. Landfill was used to raise shallow portions of the Caspian Sea.

In the early 1930s, the Texas Company developed the first mobile steel barges for drilling in the brackish coastal areas of the gulf.

In 1937, Pure Oil Company (now Chevron Corporation) and its partner Superior Oil Company (now part of ExxonMobil Corporation) used a fixed platform to develop a field in of water, one mile (1.6 km) offshore of Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana.

In 1938, Humble Oil built a mile-long wooden trestle with railway tracks into the sea at McFadden Beach on the Gulf of Mexico, placing a derrick at its end – this was later destroyed by a hurricane.

In 1945, concern for American control of its offshore oil reserves caused President Harry Truman to issue an Executive Order unilaterally extending American territory to the edge of its continental shelf, an act that effectively ended the 3-mile limit &quot;freedom of the seas&quot; regime.

In 1946, Magnolia Petroleum (now ExxonMobil) drilled at a site off the coast, erecting a platform in of water off St. Mary Parish, Louisiana.

In early 1947, Superior Oil erected a drilling/production platform in of water some 18 miles off Vermilion Parish, Louisiana. But it was Kerr-McGee Oil Industries (now part of Occidental Petroleum), as operator for partners Phillips Petroleum (ConocoPhillips) and Stanolind Oil &amp; Gas (BP), that completed its historic Ship Shoal Block 32 well in October 1947, months before Superior actually drilled a discovery from their Vermilion platform farther offshore. In any case, that made Kerr-McGee&#x27;s well the first oil discovery drilled out of sight of land.

The British Maunsell Forts constructed during World War II are considered the direct predecessors of modern offshore platforms. Having been pre-constructed in a very short time, they were then floated to their location and placed on the shallow bottom of the Thames and the Mersey estuary.

In 1954, the first jackup oil rig was ordered by Zapata Oil. It was designed by R. G. LeTourneau and featured three electro-mechanically operated lattice-type legs. Built on the shores of the Mississippi River by the LeTourneau Company, it was launched in December 1955, and christened &quot;Scorpion&quot;. The Scorpion was put into operation in May 1956 off Port Aransas, Texas. It was lost in 1969.

When offshore drilling moved into deeper waters of up to , fixed platform rigs were built, until demands for drilling equipment was needed in the to depth of the Gulf of Mexico, the first jack-up rigs began appearing from specialized offshore drilling contractors such as forerunners of ENSCO International.

The first semi-submersible resulted from an unexpected observation in 1961. Blue Water Drilling Company owned and operated the four-column submersible Blue Water Rig No.1 in the Gulf of Mexico for Shell Oil Company. As the pontoons were not sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of the rig and its consumables, it was towed between locations at a draught midway between the top of the pontoons and the underside of the deck. It was noticed that the motions at this draught were very small, and Blue Water Drilling and Shell jointly decided to try operating the rig in its floating mode. The concept of an anchored, stable floating deep-sea platform had been designed and tested back in the 1920s by Edward Robert Armstrong for the purpose of operating aircraft with an invention known as the &quot;seadrome&quot;. The first purpose-built drilling semi-submersible &quot;Ocean Driller&quot; was launched in 1963. Since then, many semi-submersibles have been purpose-designed for the drilling industry mobile offshore fleet.

The first offshore drillship was the &quot;CUSS 1&quot; developed for the Mohole project to drill into the Earth&#x27;s crust.

As of June, 2010, there were over 620 mobile offshore drilling rigs (Jackups, semisubs, drillships, barges) available for service in the competitive rig fleet.

One of the world&#x27;s deepest hubs is currently the Perdido in the Gulf of Mexico, floating in 2,438 meters of water. It is operated by Shell plc and was built at a cost of $3 billion. The deepest operational platform is the Petrobras America Cascade FPSO in the Walker Ridge 249 field in 2,600 meters of water.

===Fixed platforms===

These platforms are built on concrete or steel legs, or both, anchored directly onto the seabed, supporting the deck with space for drilling rigs, production facilities and crew quarters. Such platforms are, by virtue of their immobility, designed for very long term use (for instance the Hibernia platform). Various types of structure are used: steel jacket, concrete caisson, floating steel, and even floating concrete. Steel jackets are structural sections made of tubular steel members, and are usually piled into the seabed. To see more details regarding design, construction and installation of such platforms refer to: and.

Concrete caisson structures, pioneered by the Condeep concept, often have in-built oil storage in tanks below the sea surface and these tanks were often used as a flotation capability, allowing them to be built close to shore (Norwegian fjords and Scottish firths are popular because they are sheltered and deep enough) and then floated to their final position where they are sunk to the seabed. Fixed platforms are economically feasible for installation in water depths up to about .

===Compliant towers===

These platforms consist of slender, flexible towers and a pile foundation supporting a conventional deck for drilling and production operations. Compliant towers are designed to sustain significant lateral deflections and forces, and are typically used in water depths ranging from .

===Semi-submersible platform===

These platforms have hulls (columns and pontoons) of sufficient buoyancy to cause the structure to float, but of weight sufficient to keep the structure upright. Semi-submersible platforms can be moved from place to place and can be ballasted up or down by altering the amount of flooding in buoyancy tanks. They are generally anchored by combinations of chain, wire rope or polyester rope, or both, during drilling and/or production operations, though they can also be kept in place by the use of dynamic positioning. Semi-submersibles can be used in water depths from .

===Jack-up drilling rigs===
Jack-up Mobile Drilling Units (or jack-ups), as the name suggests, are rigs that can be jacked up above the sea using legs that can be lowered, much like jacks. These MODUs (Mobile Offshore Drilling Units) are typically used in water depths up to , although some designs can go to depth. They are designed to move from place to place, and then anchor themselves by deploying their legs to the ocean bottom using a rack and pinion gear system on each leg.

===Drillships===

A drillship is a maritime vessel that has been fitted with drilling apparatus. It is most often used for exploratory drilling of new oil or gas wells in deep water but can also be used for scientific drilling. Early versions were built on a modified tanker hull, but purpose-built designs are used today. Most drillships are outfitted with a dynamic positioning system to maintain position over the well. They can drill in water depths up to .

===Floating production systems===
The main types of floating production systems are FPSO (floating production, storage, and offloading system). FPSOs consist of large monohull structures, generally (but not always) shipshaped, equipped with processing facilities. These platforms are moored to a location for extended periods, and do not actually drill for oil or gas. Some variants of these applications, called FSO (floating storage and offloading system) or FSU (floating storage unit), are used exclusively for storage purposes, and host very little process equipment. This is one of the best sources for having floating production.

The world&#x27;s first floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facility is in production. See the section on particularly large examples below.

===Tension-leg platform===

TLPs are floating platforms tethered to the seabed in a manner that eliminates most vertical movement of the structure. TLPs are used in water depths up to about . The &quot;conventional&quot; TLP is a 4-column design that looks similar to a semisubmersible. Proprietary versions include the Seastar and MOSES mini TLPs; they are relatively low cost, used in water depths between . Mini TLPs can also be used as utility, satellite or early production platforms for larger deepwater discoveries.

===Gravity-based structure===

A GBS can either be steel or concrete and is usually anchored directly onto the seabed. Steel GBS are predominantly used when there is no or limited availability of crane barges to install a conventional fixed offshore platform, for example in the Caspian Sea. There are several steel GBS&#x27;s in the world today (e.g. offshore Turkmenistan Waters (Caspian Sea) and offshore New Zealand). Steel GBS do not usually provide hydrocarbon storage capability. It is mainly installed by pulling it off the yard, by either wet-tow or/and dry-tow, and self-installing by controlled ballasting of the compartments with sea water. To position the GBS during installation, the GBS may be connected to either a transportation barge or any other barge (provided it is large enough to support the GBS) using strand jacks. The jacks shall be released gradually whilst the GBS is ballasted to ensure that the GBS does not sway too much from target location.

===Spar platforms===
Spars are moored to the seabed like TLPs, but whereas a TLP has vertical tension tethers, a spar has more conventional mooring lines. Spars have to-date been designed in three configurations: the &quot;conventional&quot; one-piece cylindrical hull; the &quot;truss spar&quot;, in which the midsection is composed of truss elements connecting the upper buoyant hull (called a hard tank) with the bottom soft tank containing permanent ballast; and the &quot;cell spar&quot;, which is built from multiple vertical cylinders. The spar has more inherent stability than a TLP since it has a large counterweight at the bottom and does not depend on the mooring to hold it upright. It also has the ability, by adjusting the mooring line tensions (using chain-jacks attached to the mooring lines), to move horizontally and to position itself over wells at some distance from the main platform location. The first production spar was Kerr-McGee&#x27;s Neptune, anchored in in the Gulf of Mexico; however, spars (such as Brent Spar) were previously used as FSOs.

Eni&#x27;s Devil&#x27;s Tower located in of water in the Gulf of Mexico, was the world&#x27;s deepest spar until 2010. The world&#x27;s deepest platform as of 2011 was the Perdido spar in the Gulf of Mexico, floating in 2,438 metres of water. It is operated by Royal Dutch Shell and was built at a cost of $3 billion.

The first truss spars were Kerr-McGee&#x27;s Boomvang and Nansen.
The first (and, as of 2010, only) cell spar is Kerr-McGee&#x27;s Red Hawk.

===Normally unmanned installations (NUI)===

These installations, sometimes called toadstools, are small platforms, consisting of little more than a well bay, helipad and emergency shelter. They are designed to be operated remotely under normal conditions, only to be visited occasionally for routine maintenance or well work.

===Conductor support systems===

These installations, also known as &quot;satellite platforms&quot;, are small unmanned platforms consisting of little more than a well bay and a small process plant. They are designed to operate in conjunction with a static production platform which is connected to the platform by flow lines or by umbilical cable, or both.

==Particularly large examples==

The Petronius Platform is a compliant tower in the Gulf of Mexico modeled after the Hess Baldpate platform, which stands above the ocean floor. It is one of the world&#x27;s tallest structures.

The Hibernia platform in Canada is the world&#x27;s heaviest offshore platform, located on the Jeanne D&#x27;Arc Basin, in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Newfoundland. This &quot;gravity base structure&quot; (GBS), which sits on the ocean floor, is high and has storage capacity for of crude oil in its high caisson. The platform acts as a small concrete island with serrated outer edges designed to withstand the impact of an iceberg. The GBS contains production storage tanks and the remainder of the void space is filled with ballast with the entire structure weighing in at 1.2 million tons.

Royal Dutch Shell has developed the first Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) facility, which is situated approximately 200 km off the coast of Western Australia. It is the largest floating offshore facility. It is approximately 488m long and 74m wide with displacement of around 600,000t when fully ballasted.
==Maintenance and supply==

A typical oil production platform is self-sufficient in energy and water needs, housing electrical generation, water desalinators and all of the equipment necessary to process oil and gas such that it can be either delivered directly onshore by pipeline or to a floating platform or tanker loading facility, or both. Elements in the oil/gas production process include wellhead, production manifold, production separator, glycol process to dry gas, gas compressors, water injection pumps, oil/gas export metering and main oil line pumps.

Larger platforms are assisted by smaller ESVs (emergency support vessels) like the British Iolair that are summoned when something has gone wrong, &quot;e.g.&quot; when a search and rescue operation is required. During normal operations, PSVs (platform supply vessels) keep the platforms provisioned and supplied, and AHTS vessels can also supply them, as well as tow them to location and serve as standby rescue and firefighting vessels.

==Crew==

===Essential personnel===
Not all of the following personnel are present on every platform. On smaller platforms, one worker can perform a number of different jobs. The following also are not names officially recognized in the industry:
*OIM (offshore installation manager) who is the ultimate authority during his/her shift and makes the essential decisions regarding the operation of the platform;
*Operations Team Leader (OTL);
*Offshore Methods Engineer (OME) who defines the installation methodology of the platform;
*Offshore Operations Engineer (OOE) who is the senior technical authority on the platform;
*PSTL or operations coordinator for managing crew changes;
*Dynamic positioning operator, navigation, ship or vessel maneuvering (MODU), station keeping, fire and gas systems operations in the event of incident;
*Automation systems specialist, to configure, maintain and troubleshoot the process control systems (PCS), process safety systems, emergency support systems and vessel management systems;
*Second mate to meet manning requirements of flag state, operates fast rescue craft, cargo operations, fire team leader;
*Third mate to meet manning requirements of flag state, operate fast rescue craft, cargo operations, fire team leader;
*Ballast control operator to operate fire and gas systems;
*Crane operators to operate the cranes for lifting cargo around the platform and between boats;
*Scaffolders to rig up scaffolding for when it is required for workers to work at height;
*Coxswains to maintain the lifeboats and manning them if necessary;
*Control room operators, especially FPSO or production platforms;
*Catering crew, including people tasked with performing essential functions such as cooking, laundry and cleaning the accommodation;
*Production techs to run the production plant;
*Helicopter pilot(s) living on some platforms that have a helicopter based offshore and transporting workers to other platforms or to shore on crew changes;
*Maintenance technicians (instrument, electrical or mechanical).
*Fully qualified medic.
*Radio operator to operate all radio communications.
*Store Keeper, keeping the inventory well supplied
*Technician to record the fluid levels in tanks

===Incidental personnel===
Drill crew will be on board if the installation is performing drilling operations. A drill crew will normally comprise:

* Toolpusher
* Driller
* Roughnecks
* Roustabouts
* Company man
* Mud engineer
* Motorman See: Glossary of oilfield jargon
* Derrickhand
* Geologist
* Welders and Welder Helpers
Well services crew will be on board for well work. The crew will normally comprise:
* Well services supervisor
*Wireline or coiled tubing operators
* Pump operator
* Pump hanger and ranger

==Drawbacks==
===Risks===
The nature of their operation—extraction of volatile substances sometimes under extreme pressure in a hostile environment—means risk; accidents and tragedies occur regularly. The U.S. Minerals Management Service reported 69 offshore deaths, 1,349 injuries, and 858 fires and explosions on offshore rigs in the Gulf of Mexico from 2001 to 2010. On July 6, 1988, 167 people died when Occidental Petroleum&#x27;s Piper Alpha offshore production platform, on the Piper field in the UK sector of the North Sea, exploded after a gas leak. The resulting investigation conducted by Lord Cullen and publicized in the first Cullen Report was highly critical of a number of areas, including, but not limited to, management within the company, the design of the structure, and the Permit to Work System. The report was commissioned in 1988, and was delivered in November 1990. The accident greatly accelerated the practice of providing living accommodations on separate platforms, away from those used for extraction.

The offshore can be in itself a hazardous environment. In March 1980, the &#x27;flotel&#x27; (floating hotel) platform &quot;Alexander L. Kielland&quot; capsized in a storm in the North Sea with the loss of 123 lives.

In 2001, &quot;Petrobras 36&quot; in Brazil exploded and sank five days later, killing 11 people.

Given the number of grievances and conspiracy theories that involve the oil business, and the importance of gas/oil platforms to the economy, platforms in the United States are believed to be potential terrorist targets. Agencies and military units responsible for maritime counter-terrorism in the US (Coast Guard, Navy SEALs, Marine Recon) often train for platform raids.

On April 21, 2010, the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; platform, 52 miles off-shore of Venice, Louisiana, (property of Transocean and leased to BP) exploded, killing 11 people, and sank two days later. The resulting undersea gusher, conservatively estimated to exceed as of early June 2010, became the worst oil spill in US history, eclipsing the Exxon Valdez oil spill.

===Ecological effects===

In British waters, the cost of removing all platform rig structures entirely was estimated in 2013 at £30 billion.

Aquatic organisms invariably attach themselves to the undersea portions of oil platforms, turning them into artificial reefs. In the Gulf of Mexico and offshore California, the waters around oil platforms are popular destinations for sports and commercial fishermen, because of the greater numbers of fish near the platforms. The United States and Brunei have active Rigs-to-Reefs programs, in which former oil platforms are left in the sea, either in place or towed to new locations, as permanent artificial reefs. In the US Gulf of Mexico, as of September 2012, 420 former oil platforms, about 10 percent of decommissioned platforms, have been converted to permanent reefs.

On the US Pacific coast, marine biologist Milton Love has proposed that oil platforms off California be retained as artificial reefs, instead of being dismantled (at great cost), because he has found them to be havens for many of the species of fish which are otherwise declining in the region, in the course of 11 years of research. Love is funded mainly by government agencies, but also in small part by the California Artificial Reef Enhancement Program. Divers have been used to assess the fish populations surrounding the platforms.

== Effects on the environment ==
Offshore oil production involves environmental risks, most notably oil spills from oil tankers or pipelines transporting oil from the platform to onshore facilities, and from leaks and accidents on the platform. Produced water is also generated, which is water brought to the surface along with the oil and gas; it is usually highly saline and may include dissolved or unseparated hydrocarbons.

Offshore rigs are shut down during hurricanes. In the Gulf of Mexico hurricanes are increasing because of the increasing number of oil platforms that heat surrounding air with methane, it is estimated that U.S. Gulf of Mexico, oil and gas facilities emit approximately 500000 tons of methane each year, corresponding to a loss of produced gas of 2.9 percent. The increasing number of oil rigs also increase movement of oil tankers which also increases levels which directly warm water in the zone, warm waters are a key factor for hurricanes to form.

To reduce the amount of carbon emissions otherwise released into the atmosphere, methane pyrolysis of natural gas pumped up by oil platforms is a possible alternative to flaring for consideration. Methane pyrolysis produces non-polluting hydrogen in high volume from this natural gas at low cost. This process operates at around 1000 °C and removes carbon in a solid form from the methane, producing hydrogen. The carbon can then be pumped underground and is not released into the atmosphere.
It is being evaluated in such research laboratories as Karlsruhe Liquid-metal Laboratory (KALLA). and the chemical engineering team at University of California – Santa Barbara

== Repurposing ==
If not decommissioned, old platforms can be repurposed to pump into rocks below the seabed. Others have been converted to launch rockets into space, and more are being redesigned for use with heavy-lift launch vehicles.

In Saudi Arabia, there are plans to repurpose decommissioned oil rigs into a theme park.

== Challenges ==
Offshore oil and gas production is more challenging than land-based installations due to the remote and harsher environment. Much of the innovation in the offshore petroleum sector concerns overcoming these challenges, including the need to provide very large production facilities. Production and drilling facilities may be very large and a large investment, such as the Troll A platform standing on a depth of 300 meters.

Another type of offshore platform may float with a mooring system to maintain it on location. While a floating system may be lower cost in deeper waters than a fixed platform, the dynamic nature of the platforms introduces many challenges for the drilling and production facilities.

The ocean can add several thousand meters or more to the fluid column. The addition increases the equivalent circulating density and downhole pressures in drilling wells, as well as the energy needed to lift produced fluids for separation on the platform.

The trend today is to conduct more of the production operations subsea, by separating water from oil and re-injecting it rather than pumping it up to a platform, or by flowing to onshore, with no installations visible above the sea. Subsea installations help to exploit resources at progressively deeper waters—locations that had been inaccessible—and overcome challenges posed by sea ice such as in the Barents Sea. One such challenge in shallower environments is seabed gouging by drifting ice features (means of protecting offshore installations against ice action includes burial in the seabed).

Offshore manned facilities also present logistics and human resources challenges. An offshore oil platform is a small community in itself with cafeteria, sleeping quarters, management and other support functions. In the North Sea, staff members are transported by helicopter for a two-week shift. They usually receive higher salaries than onshore workers do. Supplies and waste are transported by ship, and the supply deliveries need to be carefully planned because storage space on the platform is limited. Today, much effort goes into relocating as many of the personnel as possible onshore, where management and technical experts are in touch with the platform by video conferencing. An onshore job is also more attractive for the aging workforce in the petroleum industry, at least in the western world. These efforts among others are contained in the established term integrated operations. The increased use of subsea facilities helps achieve the objective of keeping more workers onshore. Subsea facilities are also easier to expand, with new separators or different modules for different oil types, and are not limited by the fixed floor space of an above-water installation.

== Deepest platforms ==
The world&#x27;s deepest oil platform is the floating Perdido, which is a spar platform in the Gulf of Mexico in a water depth of .

<doc id="163823" wikidata="Q16848576" url="?curid=163823" title="Irish farm subdivision">
<text>The Popery Act (Penal Law) of 1704 required land owned by Roman Catholics to be divided equally between all a landholder&#x27;s sons, both legitimate and illegitimate, on his death. This had formerly been normal under the law of gavelkind, a law abolished by the Dublin administration in 1604. Known as sub-division, this inheritance practice continued by tradition until the middle of the 19th century.

The growth of population inevitably caused subdivision. Population grew from a level of about 500,000 in 1000 AD to about 2 million by 1700, and 5 million by 1800. On the eve of the Great Famine the population of Ireland had risen to 8 million, most people living on ever-smaller farms and depending on the potato as a staple diet.

By the 1840s, many farms had become so small that the only food source that could be grown in sufficient quantity to feed a family was potatoes. This was to have disastrous effects when, in the period 1847-50 a series of potato blight struck, making much of the potatoes grown inedible. This period came to be known as the Great Famine and led to the deaths of a million people.

From the 1870s the practice arose of passing a holding to one child only, which with the benefits of the Irish Land Acts, meant that the survivors prospered.

A secondary effect of the prohibition of sub-division was that other children, who would previously have inherited part of the family farm tenancy or married into a similar small farm, were forced to seek employment elsewhere. Many emigrated. Many entered religious life, as Roman Catholic priests, nuns or monks, such options becoming available due to a re-organisation of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland under Cardinal Cullen from the 1850s. This influx of young people into religious life, thanks to the disappearance of sub-division, in part, explains the massive growth in clerical numbers in Ireland in the period.

Irish landholdings underwent further massive change in the period between the 1880s and the 1930s when a series of Land Acts by the Irish Land Commission and Congested Districts Board for Ireland broke up the previous large estates from which tenant farmers rented property and who were empowered by British and (later) Irish government grants and loans to buy their farms instead of renting them.

* Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act 1870: this had little if any practical effect.
* Land Law (Ireland) Act 1881: Gave tenants real security (&quot;the Three Fs&quot;: Fair Rent, Fixity of Tenure and Free Sale). It was too little, too late: by this time the Irish were demanding full proprietorship.
* Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903: offered generous inducement to landlords to sell their estates to the Land Commission, which would then collect land annuities instead of rents.

<doc id="163824" wikidata="Q117571" url="?curid=163824" title="Romani Holocaust">
<text>The Romani Holocaust was the genocide of European Roma and Sinti people during World War II. Beginning in 1933, Nazi Germany systematically persecuted the European Roma, Sinti and other peoples pejoratively labeled &#x27;Gypsy&#x27; through forcible internment and compulsory sterilization. German authorities summarily and arbitrarily subjected Romani people to incarceration, forced labor, deportation and mass murder in concentration and extermination camps.

Under Adolf Hitler, a supplementary decree to the Nuremberg Laws was issued on 26 November 1935, classifying the Romani people (or Roma) as &quot;enemies of the race-based state&quot;, thereby placing them in the same category as the Jews. Thus, the fate of the Roma in Europe paralleled that of the Jews in the Holocaust.

Historians estimate that between 250,000 and 500,000 Romani and Sinti were killed by Nazi Germans and their collaborators—25% to over 50% of the estimate of slightly fewer than 1 million Roma in Europe at the time. Later research cited by Ian Hancock estimated the death toll to be at about 1.5 million out of an estimated 2 million European Roma.

In 1982, West Germany formally recognized that Nazi Germany had committed genocide against the Romani people. In 2011, Poland officially adopted 2 August as a day of commemoration of the Romani genocide.

Within the Nazi German state, first persecution, then extermination, was aimed primarily at sedentary &quot;Gypsy mongrels&quot;. In December 1942, Heinrich Himmler ordered the deportation of all Roma from the Greater Germanic Reich, and most were sent to the specially established Gypsy concentration camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Other Roma were deported there from the Nazi-occupied Western European territories. Approximately 21,000 of the 23,000 European Roma and Sinti sent there did not survive. In areas outside the reach of systematic registration, e.g., in the German-occupied areas of Eastern and Southeastern Europe, the Roma who were most threatened were those who, in the German judgment, were &quot;vagabonds&quot;, though some were actually refugees or displaced persons. Here, they were killed mainly in massacres perpetrated by the German military and police formations as well as by the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) task forces, and in armed resistance against the Nazi German occupation of Europe.

== Alternate terms ==
The term porajmos (also porrajmos or pharrajimos—literally, &quot;devouring&quot; or &quot;destruction&quot; in some dialects of the Romani language) was introduced by Ian Hancock in the early 1990s. Hancock chose to use the term, coined by a Kalderash Rom, from a number of suggestions which were given during an &quot;informal conversation in 1993&quot;.

The term is mostly used by activists and as a result, its usage is unknown to most Roma, including relatives of victims and survivors. Some Russian and Balkan Romani activists protest against the use of the word &quot;porajmos&quot;. In various dialects, &quot;porajmos&quot; is synonymous with &quot;poravipe&quot; which means &quot;violation&quot; and &quot;rape&quot;, a term which some Roma consider offensive. János Bársony and Ágnes Daróczi, pioneering organisers of the Romani civil rights movement in Hungary, prefer to use the term &quot;Pharrajimos&quot;, a Romani word which means &quot;cutting up&quot;, &quot;fragmentation&quot;, &quot;destruction&quot;. They argue against the use of the term &quot;porrajmos&quot;, saying that it is &quot;marhime&quot; (unclean, untouchable): &quot;[p]orrajmos is unpronounceable in the Roma community, and thus, it is incapable of conveying the sufferings of the Roma&quot;.

Balkan Romani activists prefer to use the term samudaripen (&quot;mass killing&quot;), first introduced by linguist Marcel Courthiade in the 1970s in Yugoslavia in the context of Auschwitz and Jasenovac. It is a neologism of sa (Romani for &#x27;all&#x27;) and mudaripen (murder). It can be translated as &#x27;murder of all&#x27; or &#x27;mass murder&#x27;. The International Romani Union now uses this term. Ian Hancock dismisses this word, arguing that it does not conform to Romani language morphology. Some Ruska Roma activists offer to use the term Kali Traš (&quot;Black Fear&quot;). Another alternative that has been used is Berša Bibahtale (&quot;The Unhappy Years&quot;). Lastly, adapted borrowings such as Holokosto, Holokausto, etc. are also used in the Romani language on some occasions.

Linguistically, the term &quot;porajmos&quot; is composed of the verb root &quot;porrav&quot;- and the abstract-forming nominal ending -&quot;imos&quot;. This ending is of the Vlax Romani dialect, whereas other varieties generally use -&quot;ibe(n)&quot; or -&quot;ipe(n)&quot;. For the verb itself, the most commonly given meaning is &quot;to open/stretch wide&quot; or &quot;to rip open&quot;, whereas the meaning &quot;to open up the mouth, devour&quot; occurs in fewer dialects.

== History ==
=== Anti-Romani discrimination before 1933 ===
==== Emergence of scientific racism ====
In the late 19th century, the emergence of scientific racism and Social Darwinism, linking social differences with racial differences, provided the German public with pseudoscientific justifications for prejudices against Jews and Roma. During this period, &quot;the concept of race was systematically employed in order to explain social phenomena.&quot; Proponents of this approach attempted to validate the belief that races were not variations of a single species of man because they had distinctly different biological origins. Proponents of this approach established a purportedly scientifically based racial hierarchy, which they believed defined certain minority groups as the other on the basis of biology.

In addition to being a period in which racial pseudoscience was widely promoted, the end of the 19th century was a period of state-sponsored modernization in Germany. Industrial development altered many aspects of society. Most notably, the changes which occurred during this period caused the social norms of work and life to shift. For the Roma, this shift in the social norms of work and life led to the denial of their traditional way of life as craftsmen and artisans. János Bársony notes that &quot;industrial development devalued their services as craftsmen, resulting in the disintegration of their communities and social marginalization.&quot;

==== Persecution by the German Empire and the Weimar Republic ====
The developments of racial pseudoscience and modernization resulted in anti-Romani state interventions, carried out by both the German Empire and the Weimar Republic. In 1899, the Imperial Police Headquarters in Munich established the Information Services on Romani by the Security Police. Its purpose was to keep records (identification cards, fingerprints, photographs, etc.) and continuous surveillance on the Roma community. In 1904, Prussia adopted a resolution calling for regulation of Gypsy movement. In 1911, the Bavarian Ministry of the Interior organized a conference in Munich to discuss the &quot;Gypsy problem&quot; and to coordinate efforts against Gypsies. Roma in the Weimar Republic were forbidden from entering public swimming pools, parks, and other recreational areas, and depicted throughout Germany and Europe as criminals and spies.

The 1926 &quot;Law for the Fight Against Gypsies, Vagrants and the Workshy&quot; was enforced in Bavaria, and became the national norm by 1929. It stipulated that groups identifying as &#x27;Gypsies&#x27; avoid all travel to the region. Those already living in the area were to &quot;be kept under control so that there [was] no longer anything to fear from them with regard to safety in the land.&quot; They were forbidden from &quot;roam[ing] about or camp[ing] in bands&quot;, and those &quot;unable to prove regular employment&quot; risked being sent to forced labor for up to two years.
Herbet Heuss notes that &quot;[t]his Bavarian law became the model for other German states and even for neighbouring countries.&quot;

The demand for Roma to give up their nomadic ways and settle in a specific region was often the focus of anti-Romani policy both in the German Empire and the Weimar Republic. Once settled, communities were concentrated and isolated in a single area of a town or city. This segregation facilitated state-run surveillance practices and &#x27;crime prevention.&#x27;

Following the passage of the Law for the Fight Against Gypsies, Vagrants, and the Workshy, public policy increasingly targeted the Roma on the explicit basis of race. In 1927, Prussia passed a law that required all Roma to carry identity cards. Eight thousand Roma were processed this way and subjected to mandatory fingerprinting and photographing. Two years later, the focus became more explicit. In 1929, the German state of Hessen proposed the &quot;Law for the Fight Against the Gypsy Menace&quot;. The same year, the Centre for the Fight Against Gypsies in Germany was opened. This body enforced restrictions on travel for undocumented Roma and &quot;allowed for the arbitrary arrest and detention of gypsies as a means of crime prevention.&quot;

=== Aryan racial purity ===
For centuries, Romani tribes had been subject to antiziganist persecution and humiliation in Europe. They were stigmatized as habitual criminals, social misfits, and vagabonds. When Hitler came to national power in 1933, anti-Gypsy laws in Germany remained in effect. Under the &quot;Law against Dangerous Habitual Criminals&quot; of November 1933, the police arrested many Roma, along with others the Nazis viewed as &quot;asocial&quot;—prostitutes, beggars, homeless vagrants, and alcoholics—and imprisoned them in internment camps.

After Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, legislation against the Romani was increasingly based upon a rhetoric of racism. Policy originally based on the premise of &quot;fighting crime&quot; was redirected to &quot;fighting a people&quot;. Targeted groups were no longer determined on juridical grounds, but instead, were victims of racialized policy.

The Department of Racial Hygiene and Population Biology began to experiment on Romani to determine criteria for their racial classification.

The Nazis established the Racial Hygiene and Demographic Biology Research Unit (&quot;Rassenhygienische und Bevölkerungsbiologische Forschungsstelle&quot;, Department L3 of the Reich Department of Health) in 1936. Headed by Robert Ritter and his assistant Eva Justin, this unit was mandated to conduct an in-depth study of the &quot;Gypsy question (&quot;Zigeunerfrage&quot;)&quot; and to provide data required for formulating a new Reich &quot;Gypsy law&quot;. After extensive fieldwork in the spring of 1936, consisting of interviews and medical examinations to determine the racial classification of the Roma, the unit decided that most Romani, whom they had concluded were not of &quot;pure Gypsy blood&quot;, posed a danger to German racial purity and should be deported or eliminated. No decision was made regarding the remainder (about 10 percent of the total Romani population of Europe), primarily Sinti and Lalleri tribes living in Germany. Several suggestions were made. &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler suggested deporting the Romani to a remote reservation, as the United States had done to Native Americans, where &quot;pure Gypsies&quot; could continue their nomadic lifestyle unhindered. According to him:

Himmler took special interest into the &quot;Aryan&quot; origins of the Romani and distinguished between &quot;settled&quot; (assimilated) and &quot;unsettled&quot; Romani. In May 1942 an order was issued according to which all &quot;Gypsies&quot; living in the Balkans were to be arrested.

Although the Nazi regime never produced the &quot;Gypsy Law&quot; desired by Himmler, policies and decrees were passed which discriminated against the Romani people. Roma were classified as &quot;asocial&quot; and &quot;criminals&quot; by the Nazi regime. From 1933 on, Roma were placed in concentration camps. After 1937, the Nazis started to carry out racial examinations on the Roma living in Germany. In 1938, Himmler issued an order regarding the &#x27;Gypsy question&#x27; which explicitly mentioned &quot;race&quot; which stated that it was &quot;advisable to deal with the Gypsy question on the basis of race.&quot; The decree made it law to register all Roma (including &quot;Mischlinge&quot; – mixed race), as well as those people who &quot;travel around in a Gypsy fashion&quot; over the age of six. Although the Nazis believed that the Roma had originally been Aryan, over time, the Nazis said, they became mixed-race and so were classified as &quot;non-Aryan&quot; and of an &quot;alien race&quot;.

=== Loss of citizenship ===

The Nuremberg race laws passed on 15 September 1935. The first Nuremberg Law, the &quot;Law for the Protection of German Blood and Honor&quot;, forbade marriage and extramarital intercourse between Jews and Germans. The second Nuremberg law, &quot;The Reich Citizenship Law&quot;, stripped Jews of their German citizenship. On 26 November 1935, Germany expanded the Nuremberg laws to also apply to the Roma. Romani, like Jews, lost their right to vote on 7 March 1936.

=== Persecution and genocide ===

The Third Reich&#x27;s government began persecuting the Romani as early as 1936 when they started to transfer the people to municipal internment camps on the outskirts of cities, a prelude to their deportation to concentration camps. A December 1937 decree on &quot;crime prevention&quot; provided the pretext for major roundups of Roma. Nine representatives of the Romani community in Germany were asked to compile lists of &quot;pure-blooded&quot; Romanis to be saved from deportation. However, the Germans often ignored these lists, and some individuals identified on them were still sent to concentration camps. Notable internment and concentration camps include Dachau, Dieselstrasse, Marzahn (which evolved from a municipal internment camp) and Vennhausen.

Initially, the Romani were herded into so-called ghettos, including the Warsaw Ghetto (April–June 1942), where they formed a distinct class in relation to the Jews. Ghetto diarist Emmanuel Ringelblum speculated that Romani were sent to the Warsaw Ghetto because the Germans wanted:... to toss into the Ghetto everything that is characteristically dirty, shabby, bizarre, of which one ought to be frightened, and which anyway has to be destroyed.

Initially, there was disagreement within the Nazi circles about how to solve the &quot;Gypsy Question&quot;. In late 1939 and early 1940, Hans Frank, the General Governor of occupied Poland, refused to accept the 30,000 German and Austrian Roma which were to be deported to his territory. Heinrich Himmler &quot;lobbied to save a handful of pure-blooded Roma&quot;, whom he believed to be an ancient Aryan people for his &quot;ethnic reservation&quot;, but was opposed by Martin Bormann, who favored deportation for all Roma. The debate ended in 1942 when Himmler signed the order to begin the mass deportations of Roma to Auschwitz concentration camp. During Operation Reinhard (1941–1943), an undetermined number of Roma were killed in the extermination camps, such as Treblinka.
The Nazi persecution of Roma was not regionally consistent. In France, between 3,000 and 6,000 Roma were deported to German concentration camps as Dachau, Ravensbrück, Buchenwald, and other camps. Further east, in the Balkan states and the Soviet Union, the Einsatzgruppen, mobile killing squads, travelled from village to village massacring the inhabitants where they lived and typically leaving few to no records of the number of Roma killed in this way. In a few cases, significant documentary evidence of mass murder was generated. Timothy Snyder notes that in the Soviet Union alone there were 8,000 documented cases of Roma murdered by the Einsatzgruppen in their sweep east.

In return for immunity from prosecution for war crimes, Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski stated at the Einsatzgruppen Trial that &quot;the principal task of the Einsatzgruppen of the S.D. was the annihilation of the Jews, Gypsies, and Political commissars&quot;. Roma in the Slovak Republic were killed by local collaborating auxiliaries. Notably, in Denmark and Greece, local populations did not participate in the hunt for Roma as they did elsewhere. Bulgaria and Finland, although allies of Germany, did not cooperate with the Porajmos, just as they did not cooperate with the anti-Jewish &quot;Shoah&quot;.
On 16 December 1942, Himmler ordered that the Romani candidates for extermination should be transferred from ghettos to the extermination facilities of Auschwitz-Birkenau. On 15 November 1943, Himmler ordered that Romani and &quot;part-Romanies&quot; were to be put &quot;on the same level as Jews and placed in concentration camps&quot;. The camp authorities housed Roma in a special compound that was called the &quot;Gypsy family camp&quot;. Some 23,000 Roma, Sinti, and Lalleri were deported to Auschwitz altogether. In concentration camps such as Auschwitz, Roma wore brown or black triangular patches, the symbol for &quot;asocials&quot;, or green ones, the symbol for professional criminals, and less frequently the letter &quot;Z&quot; (meaning &quot;Zigeuner&quot;, German word for gypsy).

Sybil Milton, a scholar of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust, has speculated that Hitler was involved in the decision to deport all Romani to Auschwitz, as Himmler gave the order six days after meeting with Hitler. For that meeting, Himmler had prepared a report on the subject &quot;Führer: Aufstellung wer sind Zigeuner&quot;. On some occasions, the Roma attempted to resist the Nazis&#x27; extermination. In May 1944 at Auschwitz, SS guards tried to liquidate the Gypsy Family Camp and were &quot;met with unexpected resistance&quot;. When ordered to come out, they refused, having been warned and arming themselves with crude weapons: iron pipes, shovels and other tools. The SS chose not to confront the Roma directly and withdrew for several months. After transferring as many as 3,000 Roma who were capable of forced labor to Auschwitz I and other concentration camps, the SS moved against the remaining 2,898 inmates on 2 August. The SS murdered nearly all of the remaining inmates, most of them ill, elderly men, women and children, in the gas chambers of Birkenau. At least 19,000 of the 23,000 Roma sent to Auschwitz were murdered there.

The Society for Threatened Peoples estimates the Romani deaths at 277,100. Martin Gilbert estimates that a total of more than 220,000 of the 700,000 Romani in Europe were murdered, including 15,000 (mainly from the Soviet Union) at Mauthausen in January–May 1945. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum cites scholars who estimate the number of Sinti and Roma murdered as between 220,000 and 500,000. Sybil Milton estimated the number of lives lost as &quot;something between a half-million and a million-and-a-half&quot;.

== Persecution in other Axis and occupied countries ==
The governments of some Nazi German allies, namely Slovakia, Finland, Italy, Vichy France, Hungary, and Romania, also contributed to the Nazi plan to exterminate the Romani, but most of the Romani who resided in these countries survived, unlike those Romani who resided in Ustaše Croatia or those Romani who resided in areas which were directly ruled by Nazi Germany (such as occupied Poland). The Hungarian Arrow Cross government deported between 28,000 and 33,000 Romani out of a population that was estimated to be between 70,000 and 100,000.

===Independent State of Croatia===
The Romani people were also persecuted by the puppet regimes that cooperated with the Third Reich during the war, especially by the notorious Ustaše regime in the Independent State of Croatia. Tens of thousands of Romani people were killed in the Jasenovac concentration camp, along with Serbs, Jews, Bosniaks and Croats. Yad Vashem estimates that the Porajmos was most intense in Yugoslavia, where around 90,000 Romani were killed. The Ustaše government virtually annihilated the country&#x27;s Romani population, killing an estimated 25,000 and also deporting around 26,000.

In May 1942, an Ustaše order was issued, according to it, the deportation of Muslim Roma who were residing in Bosnia and Herzegovina should stop.

On April 24, 1945, Ustaše soldiers brutally murdered between 43 and 47 Sinti and Roma members of a traveling circus named &quot;Braća Winter&quot; as they temporarily settled in Kraj Donji on their way to Slovenia. The atrocity is known as the Hrastina Massacre and is perhaps the last mass murder of Sinti and Roma in Europe during World War II. In 1977, a statue was erected in the local cemetery, Marija Gorica, to honor the victims.

===Serbia===
In the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia, the German occupiers and the Serbian collaborationist puppet government killed thousands of Romani in the Banjica concentration camp, Crveni Krst concentration camp and Topovske Šupe concentration camp along with Jews. In August 1942, Harald Turner reported to his superiors that &quot;Serbia is the only country in which the Jewish question and the Gypsy question have been solved.&quot;

Serbian Romani were parties to the unsuccessful class action suit against the Vatican Bank and others in the U.S. federal court in which they sought the return of wartime loot.

===Romania===
The Romanian government of Ion Antonescu did not systematically annihilate Roma who resided on its territory. Some resident Roma were deported to occupied Transnistria. Of the estimated 25,000 Romani inmates of these camps, around 11,000 (44%, or almost half) died.

===Italy===
In Fascist Italy, as well as in Slovenia and Montenegro, territories which were under Italian occupation, the majority of the Roma were forcibly rounded up and incarcerated in concentration camps, but generally, they were relatively well treated, especially in contrast to the Roma who resided in the parts of Europe which were occupied by Nazi Germany. Many of them were deported to Sardinia, with much of them being given Italian identity cards that put them out of reach of extermination by the Nazis and the Ustaše. As a result, the vast majority of the Roma who resided in Italy and its occupied territories managed to survive the war.

===Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia===
In the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, Romani internees were sent to the Lety and Hodonín concentration camps before they were transferred to Auschwitz-Birkenau for mass murder – by poison gas. What makes the Lety camp unique is the fact that it was staffed by Czech guards, who could be even more brutal than the Germans, as testified to in Paul Polansky&#x27;s book &quot;Black Silence&quot;. The genocide was so thorough, that the vast majority of Romani who currently reside in the Czech Republic are actually the descendants of migrants who moved from Slovakia to what was then Czechoslovakia and would become the Czech Republic during the post-war years.

===France ===
Between 16,000 and 18,000 Romani from Nazi-occupied France were killed in German camps.

===Denmark===
The small Romani population in Denmark was not subjected to mass killings by the Nazi occupiers; instead, it was simply classified as &quot;asocial&quot;. Angus Fraser attributes this to &quot;doubts over ethnic demarcations within the travelling population&quot;.

===Greece===
The Romanis of Greece were taken hostage and prepared for deportation to Auschwitz, but they were saved by appeals from the Archbishop of Athens and the Greek Prime Minister.

===Norway===
In 1934, 68 Romani, most of them Norwegian citizens, were denied entry into Norway, and they were also denied transit through Sweden and Denmark when they wanted to leave Germany. In the winter of 1943–1944, 66 members of the Josef, Karoli, and Modis families were interned in Belgium and deported to the gypsy department in Auschwitz. Only four members of this group survived.

===Crimea===
In Crimea, the Muslim Roma were protected by the Crimean Tatars from assassination. However, it later served Stalin to deport the Crimean Muslim Romani along with the Crimean Tatars to Siberia, since they were registered as Tatars.

=== Estimated number of victims ===
The following figures are from &quot;The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust&quot; and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum&#x27;s online encyclopedia of the Holocaust.
However, new findings and documents uncovered by research experts reveal that the Roma death toll was at least about 200,000 to 500,000 of the 1 or 2 million Roma in Europe, with numerous experts and scholars giving much higher number of Romani deaths, such as Ian Hancock, director of the Romani Archives and Documentation Center at the University of Texas at Austin. He discovered that almost the entire Romani population was killed in Croatia, Estonia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Rudolph Rummel, the late professor emeritus of political science at the University of Hawaii who spent his career assembling data on collective violence by governments toward their people (for which he coined the term democide), estimated that, in total, 258,000 were killed by the Nazi regime in Europe, 36,000 in Romania under Ion Antonescu and 27,000 in Ustaše-controlled Croatia.

In a 2010 publication, Ian Hancock stated that he agrees with the view that the number of Romanies killed has been underestimated as a result of being grouped with others in Nazi records under headings such as &quot;remainder to be liquidated&quot;, &quot;hangers-on&quot;, and &quot;partisans&quot;. He notes recent evidence such as the previously obscure Lety concentration camp in the Czech Republic and Ackovic&#x27;s revised estimates of Romani killed by the Ustaše as high as 80,000–100,000. These numbers suggest that previous estimates have been grossly underrepresented.

Zbigniew Brzezinski has estimated that 800,000 Roma people were killed through Nazi actions.

== Medical experiments ==

Another distinctive feature of both the Porajmos and the Holocaust was the extensive use of human subjects in medical experiments. The most notorious of these physicians was Josef Mengele, who worked in the Auschwitz concentration camp. His experiments included placing subjects in pressure chambers, testing drugs on them, freezing them, attempting to change their eye color by injecting chemicals into children&#x27;s eyes and performing various amputations and other brutal surgeries. The full extent of his work will never be known because the truckload of records which he sent to Otmar von Verschuer at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute was destroyed by von Verschuer. Mengele&#x27;s own journals, consisting of some 3,300 pages, are likely never to be published. Subjects who survived Mengele&#x27;s experiments were almost always murdered and dissected shortly afterwards. One Roma survivor of medical experimentation was Margarethe Kraus.

Mengele seemed particularly keen on working with Romani children. He brought them sweets and toys and personally took them to the gas chamber. They called him &quot;Onkel Mengele&quot;. Vera Alexander was a Jewish inmate at Auschwitz who looked after 50 sets of Romani twins:

I remember one set of twins in particular: Guido and Ina, aged about four. One day, Mengele took them away. When they returned, they were in a terrible state: they had been sewn together, back to back, like Siamese twins. Their wounds were infected and oozing pus. They screamed day and night. Then their parents—I remember the mother&#x27;s name was Stella—managed to get some morphine and they killed the children in order to end their suffering.

== Recognition and remembrance ==
The German government paid war reparations to Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, but not to the Romani. There were &quot;never any consultations at Nuremberg or any other international conference as to whether the Sinti and Roma were entitled like the Jews to reparations.&quot; The Interior Ministry of Wuerttemberg argued that &quot;Gypsies [were] persecuted under the Nazis not for any racial reason but because of an asocial and criminal record&quot;. When on trial for his leadership of Einsatzgruppen in the USSR, Otto Ohlendorf cited the massacres of Roma people during the Thirty Years&#x27; War as a historical precedent.

The European Roma Rights Centre in 2017 gave more details of the chronology of recognition and reparations:

In the historiography of East Germany (GDR), the persecution of Sinti and Roma under National Socialism was largely taboo. The German historian Anne-Kathleen Tillack-Graf states that in the GDR, Sinti and Roma were not mentioned as concentration camp prisoners during the official commemorations of the liberation at the three national memorial sites Buchenwald, Sachsenhausen, and Ravensbrück, just like homosexuals, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and asocial detainees. West Germany recognised the genocide of the Roma in 1982, and since then the Porajmos has been increasingly recognized as a genocide committed simultaneously with the Shoah. The American historian Sybil Milton wrote several articles arguing that the Porajmos deserved recognition as part of the Holocaust. In Switzerland, a committee of experts investigated the policy of the Swiss government during the Porajmos.

Nico Fortuna, a sociologist and Roma activist, explained the distinction between Jewish collective memory of the Holocaust and the Roma experience:
Ian Hancock has also observed a reluctance among Roma to acknowledge their victimization by the Third Reich. The Roma &quot;are traditionally not disposed to keeping alive the terrible memories from their history—nostalgia is a luxury for others&quot;. The effects of the illiteracy, the lack of social institutions, and the rampant discrimination faced by Roma in Europe today have produced a people who, according to Fortuna, lack a &quot;national consciousness ... and historical memory of the Holocaust because there is no Roma elite.&quot;

=== Acts of commemoration ===

The first memorial which commemorates victims of the Romani Holocaust was erected on 8 May 1956, in the Polish village of Szczurowa commemorating the Szczurowa massacre. Since 1996, a Gypsy Caravan Memorial has been traveling among the main remembrance sites in Poland, from Tarnów via Auschwitz, Szczurowa and Borzęcin Dolny, gathering the Romani and well-wishers in the remembrance of the Porajmos. Several museums dedicate a part of their permanent exhibition to documenting that history, such as the Museum of Romani Culture in Czech Republic and the Ethnographic Museum in Tarnów in Poland. Some political organisations have tried to block the installation of Romani memorials near former concentration camps, as shown by the debate over Lety and Hodonin in the Czech Republic.

On 23 October 2007, President Traian Băsescu publicly apologized for his nation&#x27;s role in the Porajmos, the first time a Romanian leader has done so. He called for the Porajmos to be taught in schools, stating that, &quot;We must tell our children that six decades ago children like them were sent by the Romanian state to die of hunger and cold&quot;. Part of his apology was expressed in the Romani language. Băsescu awarded three Porajmos survivors with an Order for Faithful Services. Before recognizing Romania&#x27;s role in the Porajmos, Traian Băsescu was widely quoted after an incident on 19 May 2007, in which he insulted a journalist by calling her a &quot;stinky gypsy&quot;. The president subsequently apologized.
On 27 January 2011, Zoni Weisz became the first Roma guest of honour at Germany&#x27;s official Holocaust Memorial Day ceremony. Dutch-born Weisz escaped death during a Nazi round-up when a policeman allowed him to escape. Nazi injustices against the Roma were recalled at the ceremony, including that directed at Sinto boxer Johann Trollmann.

In July 2011, the Polish Parliament passed a resolution for the official recognition of 2 August as a day of commemoration of the genocide.

On 5 May 2012, the world premiere of the &quot;Requiem for Auschwitz,&quot; by composer Roger Moreno Rathgeb, was performed at the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam by The Roma and Sinti Philharmoniker directed by Riccardo M Sahiti. The Philharmoniker is a pan-European orchestra of Roma and Sinto musicians generally employed by other classical orchestras; it is focused on the contribution of Roma culture to classical music. Dutch-Swiss Sinto Moreno Rathgeb wrote his requiem for all victims of Auschwitz and Nazi terror. The occasion of the premiere was coupled to a conference, &quot;Roma between Past and Future.&quot; The requiem has since been performed in Tilburg, Prague, Budapest, Frankfurt, Kraków, and Berlin.

On 24 October 2012, the Memorial to the Sinti and Roma Victims of National Socialism was unveiled in Berlin. Since 2010, ternYpe – International Roma Youth Network has organized a commemoration week called &quot;Dikh he na bister&quot; (look and don&#x27;t forget) about 2 August in Kraków and Auschwitz-Birkenau. In 2014 they organised the largest Youth Commemoration Ceremony in history, attracting more than 1000 young Roma and non-Roma from 25 countries. This initiative of ternYpe Network was held under the European Parliament&#x27;s High Patronage granted by President Martin Schulz.

=== In popular culture ===
*In the 2011 documentary film, &quot;A People Uncounted: The Untold Story of the Roma&quot;, filmmaker Aaron Yeger chronicles the rich, yet difficult history of the Romani people, from ancient times to the Romani genocide which was perpetrated by the Nazis during WWII, and then, it chronicles the history of the Romani people from the end of World War II to the present day. Romani Holocaust survivors share their raw, authentic stories of life in the concentration camps, providing first-hand accounts of this minority group&#x27;s experience, a subject which the public does not know about.
*In 2009, Tony Gatlif, a French Romani film director, directed the film &quot;Korkoro&quot;, which portrays the Romani Taloche&#x27;s escape from the Nazis, with help from a French notary, Justes, and his difficulty in trying to lead a sedentary life. The film&#x27;s other main character, Mademoiselle Lise Lundi, is inspired by Yvette Lundy, a teacher who worked in Gionges and was active in the French Resistance.
*The 1988 Polish film, &quot;And the Violins Stopped Playing,&quot; also has the Porajmos as its subject. It was criticized for showing the killing of Roma as a method of removing witnesses of the killing of Jews.
*A scene in the French-language film &quot;Train de Vie (Train of Life)&quot;, directed by Radu Mihaileanu, depicts a group of Romani singing and dancing with Jews at a stop en route to a concentration camp.
*In the graphic X-Men novel &quot;The Magneto Testament&quot;, Max Eisenhardt, who would later become Magneto, has a crush on a Romani girl who is named Magda. He later meets her again in Auschwitz, where she is in the Gypsy Camp and together, they plan their escape. The Porajmos is described in detail.
*In 2019, Roz Mortimer directed &quot;The Deathless Woman&quot;, a &#x27;hybrid-documentary&#x27; film which is both a ghost story and a record of first person testimonies about historical crimes which were committed against the Roma during WWII (and contemporary crimes). The ghostly narrator, voiced in Romani by Iveta Kokyová, questions the absence of her history in archives and museums.

=== Literature ===
Several survivors of the Romani holocaust wrote about their experiences. They include: Philomena Franz, Otto Rosenberg, Ceija Stojka, Walter Winter, Alfred Lessing, and others. The first of these works appeared in the 1980s as silence over the impact of the holocaust on Romani communities began to be discussed.

<text>Pteridinium is an erniettomorph found in a number of Precambrian deposits worldwide. It is a member of the Ediacaran biota.

==Body plan==
The three-lobed body is generally flat such that only two lobes are visible. Each lobe consists of a number of parallel ribs extending back to the main axis where the three lobes come together. Even on well-preserved specimens, there is no sign of a mouth, anus, eyes, legs, antennae, or any other appendages or organs. The organism grew primarily by the addition of new units, probably at both ends, with the inflation of existing units contributing little to its growth.

==Ecology==
Specimens found in what is thought to be life positions indicate that the creature rested on, or possibly in, the sediment in shallow seas. No tracks are known that would seem to be consistent with a moving &quot;Pteridinium&quot;. It is unclear whether it performed photosynthesis, or osmotically extracted nutrients from seawater.

==Occurrence==
Fossils are common in late Precambrian deposits in South Australia, South Africa, Namibia, and the White Sea region of Russia. It has also been found in North Carolina and is reported from California and the Northwest Territories of Canada.

==History==
&quot;Pteridium simplex&quot; was originally described by Georg Gürich in 1930 published in &quot;Zeitschrift der Deutschen Geologischen Gesellschaft&quot; vol.82 p. 637. &quot;Pteridium&quot; was already used back in 1777 by Scopoli as the generic name for bracken fern, and so it was changed to &quot;Pteridinium&quot; in 1933.

Two &quot;Pteridinium&quot; specimens were found in North Carolina in 1963 by a high school student named John Brattain. After their discovery, they were misidentified by Joseph St. Jean from the UNC Geology Department as Cambrian trilobites, and were classified as &quot;Paradoxides carolinaensis&quot;, until they were discovered to be a species of &quot;Pteridinium&quot;.

It was originally thought that &quot;Pteridinium&quot; might be a primitive Cnidarian, but it appears that it is, at best, only very distantly related to any known cnidarian. Its relation to other known Ediacaran biota is not clear. There are no identified related forms, although there is some vague resemblance to other Ediacaran forms such as &quot;Dickinsonia&quot; and &quot;Spriggina&quot; that share some of its enigmatic characteristics, such as the &quot;staggered&quot; or glide symmetry of its units, or triradial symmetry otherwise only seen in trilobozoans like &quot;Tribrachidium&quot;. &quot;Pteridinium&quot; has no known descendants.

<text>Richard John Seddon (22 June 1845 – 10 June 1906) was a New Zealand politician who served as the 15th premier (prime minister) of New Zealand from 1893 until his death. In office for thirteen years, he is to date New Zealand&#x27;s longest-serving head of government.

Seddon was born in Eccleston, Lancashire, England. He arrived in New Zealand in 1866. His prominence in local politics gained him a seat in the House of Representatives in 1879. Seddon became a key member of the Liberal Party under the leadership of John Ballance. When the Liberal Government came to power in 1891 Seddon was appointed to several portfolios, including Minister of Public Works. Seddon succeeded to the leadership of the Liberal Party following Ballance&#x27;s death in 1893, inheriting a bill for women&#x27;s suffrage, which was passed the same year despite Seddon&#x27;s opposition to it. Seddon&#x27;s government achieved many social and economic changes, such as the introduction of old age pensions. His personal popularity, charisma and strength overcame dissent from within his cabinet. This has been described as firmly establishing &quot;Seddonism&quot;, a colloquial term for Seddon&#x27;s strand of nationalist conservatism, as New Zealand&#x27;s dominant political ideology. His government also purchased vast amounts of land from the Māori, aided by his allies Alfred Cadman and James Carroll as the Ministers of Native Affairs. He spent the 1899 general election trying to relieve New Zealand&#x27;s parliament of the independent politicians who had so greatly dominated the country&#x27;s organised national politics since its provenance, in which he triumphed greatly. An imperialist in foreign policy, his attempt to incorporate Fiji into New Zealand failed, but he successfully annexed the Cook Islands in 1901. Seddon&#x27;s government supported Britain with troops in the Second Boer War (1899–1902) and supported preferential trade between British colonies.

Seddon was regarded as deeply regionalist; the late Professor of History at Victoria University of Wellington, D.A. Hamer, described him as &quot;an intensely parochial politician... a great fighter for the interests of West Coasters but with no interest in or knowledge about wider New Zealand problems&quot;. His heritage from the region defined him not only as a politician, but as a man; he became well-known for the &quot;uncouth&quot; stereotypes of the generally West Coast Pākehā population of the time, expressed in his lack of education, boisterous and aggressive persona, and his dialectal tendency to drop his aitches. Seddon continued to live on the West Coast of the South Island throughout his premiership, only coming to Wellington on a regular basis very reluctantly, from the late 1890s. Seddon was also described as a man of secret brooding, who secretly battled anxiety and depression beneath his public surface of rodomontade and bravado; he hid his personal struggles to ensure his enemies would not feel pleasure knowing they had hurt him.

Despite his personal insecurities, dominating and almost illiberal viewpoints, and erratic nature, he inspired serious and long-lasting loyalty among his cabinet members. Leading the Liberal Party until his death, the party afterwards struggled to recover, going through a string of leaders before essentially giving way to New Zealand&#x27;s modern two-party system of what would become the Labour and National Parties. Ironically, this was something Seddon had been instrumental in creating, through his successful attempt at suppressing New Zealand&#x27;s previously dominant political cohort of independents. Despite being derisively known as &quot;King Dick&quot; for his autocratic style, and criticised for his actions on Māori land deprivation and his views on race (especially towards Chinese), he has nonetheless been named as one of the greatest, most influential, and most widely known politicians in New Zealand history.

==Early life and family==
Seddon was born in the town of Eccleston, near St Helens in Lancashire, England, on 22 June 1845. His father Thomas Seddon (born 1817) was a school headmaster, and his mother Jane Lindsay was a teacher; they married on 8 February 1842 at Christ Church, Eccleston. Richard was the third of their eight children.

Despite this background, Seddon did not perform well at school, and was described as unruly. Despite his parents&#x27; attempt to give him a classical education, Seddon developed an interest in engineering, but was removed from school at age 12. After working on his grandfather Richard&#x27;s farm at Barrow Nook Hall for two years, Seddon was an apprentice at Daglish&#x27;s Foundry in Sutton. He later worked at Vauxhall foundry in Liverpool, where he attained a Board of Trade Certificate as a mechanical engineer. During his time in Lancashire, he was heavily influenced by social liberalism, and many of its ideas would form part of his political philosophy as a politician.

On 15 June 1862, at the age of 16, Seddon decided to emigrate to Australia, working his passage to Melbourne on the SS &quot;Great Britain&quot;. He later provided his reasoning: &quot;A restlessness to get away to see new, broad lands seized me: My work was irksome. I felt cramped.&quot; He entered the railway workshops at Williamstown, and also worked in the goldfields at Bendigo; he did not meet with any great success. In either 1865 or 1866, he became engaged to Louisa Jane Spotswood, but her family would not permit marriage until Seddon was financially secure.

Seddon moved to New Zealand&#x27;s West Coast in 1866. Initially, he worked the goldfields in Waimea. He is believed to have prospered here, and he returned briefly to Melbourne to marry Louisa. He established a store, and then expanded his business to include the sale of alcohol, becoming a publican. He was followed to the West Coast by his older sister Phoebe, younger brothers Edward and Jim and younger sister Mary. Phoebe married William Cunliffe on 9 May 1863 at Holy Trinity Church Eccleston. Their son Bill was Labour MP David Cunliffe&#x27;s grandfather, making Richard Seddon David Cunliffe&#x27;s great-great-uncle.

==Local politics==
Seddon first entered politics in 1870, when he ran unsuccessfully for the Westland County Council, finishing third. The same year, he was elected to the Arahura Road Board. He ran again for the County Council in 1872, finishing a distant third.

In 1874 Seddon stood for the newly created Westland Provincial Council and was elected for Arahura. He established himself as a broadly effective, if rather bellicose, advocate for miners&#x27; interests. He also took an interest in education during this time. He lost this position with the abolition of the provinces in 1876, and was elected instead to the newly reconstituted county council. In 1876 he stood for Parliament in the two-member Hokitika electorate and placed fourth out of five candidates.

Kumara became a prominent goldmining town. Seddon was elected its first Mayor in 1877. He had staked a claim in Kumara the previous year, and had shortly afterwards moved his business there. Despite occasional financial troubles (he filed for bankruptcy in 1878), his political career prospered.

==Entry to Parliament==
In the 1879 election, he stood for Parliament again, and was elected. He represented Hokitika to 1881, then Kumara from 1881 to 1890, then Westland from 1890 to his death in 1906. His son Tom Seddon succeeded him as MP for Westland.

In Parliament, Seddon aligned himself with George Grey, a former Governor turned Premier. Seddon later claimed to be particularly close to Grey, although some historians believe that this was an invention for political purposes. Initially, Seddon was derided by many members of Parliament, who mocked his &quot;provincial&quot; accent (which tended to drop the letter &quot;h&quot;) and his lack of formal education. He nevertheless proved quite effective in Parliament, being particularly good at &quot;stonewalling&quot; certain legislation. His political focus was on issues of concern to his West Coast constituents. He specialised on mining issues, became a recognised authority on the topic, and chaired the goldfields committee in 1887 and 1888.

He aggressively proclaimed a populist anti-elitist philosophy in many speeches and toast. &quot;It is the rich and the poor; it is the wealthy people and the landowners against the middle classes and the labouring classes,&quot; he explained.




==Liberal Party==

Seddon joined the nascent Liberal Party, led by John Ballance, following the December 1890 general election. Their platform was for reform in the areas of land and labour. They were greatly helped by the abolition of plural voting, which allowed landowners in each district they owned land in to vote in them.

Seddon was sworn into his first ministerial positions when the Liberals came to power in January 1891. He became minister of public works, mines, defence, and marine. He promoted co-operative contract system for road-making and other public works projects.

Unlike Ballance who believed in classical liberalism, Seddon did not have any great commitment to any ideology. Rather, he saw the Liberals as champions of &quot;the common man&quot; against large commercial interests and major landowners. His strong advocacy for what he saw as the interests of ordinary New Zealanders won him considerable popularity. Attacks by the opposition, which generally focused on his lack of education and sophistication (one opponent said that he was only &quot;partially civilised&quot;) reinforced his growing reputation as an enemy of elitism.

Seddon quickly became popular across the country. Some of his colleagues, however, were not as happy, accusing him of putting populism ahead of principle, and of being an anti-intellectual. John Ballance, now Premier, had a deep commitment to liberal causes such as women&#x27;s suffrage and Māori rights, which Seddon was not always as enthusiastic about. Nevertheless, many people in the Liberal Party believed that Seddon&#x27;s popularity was a huge asset for the party, and Seddon developed a substantial following.

==Premiership==

Ballance fell seriously ill in 1892 and made Seddon acting leader of the House. After Ballance&#x27;s death in April 1893, the Governor David Boyle, 7th Earl of Glasgow asked Seddon, as the acting leader of the house, to form a new ministry. Despite the refusal of William Pember Reeves and Thomas Mackenzie to accept his leadership, Seddon managed to secure the backing of his Liberal Party colleagues as interim leader, with an understanding being reached that a full vote would occur when Parliament resumed sitting. Seddon&#x27;s most prominent challenger was Robert Stout, a former Premier for two separate terms. Like Ballance, Stout had a strong belief in classical-liberal principles. Ballance himself had preferred Stout as his successor, but had died before being able to secure this aim. Stout was not a member of the House of Representatives at the time of Ballance&#x27;s death, and only re-entered following the by-election in Inangahua on 8 June 1893.

Despite Seddon&#x27;s promise, however, there was no vote on the party leadership and therefore the premiership. By convincing his party colleagues that a leadership contest would split the party in two, or at least leave deep divisions, Seddon managed to secure a permanent hold on the leadership. Stout continued to be one of his strongest critics and led the campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage despite Seddon&#x27;s opposition. Eventually Stout left the Liberal Party in 1896 and remained in the house as an independent until 1898. In 1899, however, Seddon recommended Stout to the Governor as the next Chief Justice of New Zealand.

===Women&#x27;s suffrage===

John Ballance, founder of the Liberal Party, had been a strong supporter of voting rights for women, declaring his belief in the &quot;absolute equality of the sexes&quot;. At the time women&#x27;s suffrage was closely linked to the temperance movement, which sought prohibition of alcohol. As a former publican and self-styled &quot;Champion of the Common Man&quot; Seddon initially opposed women&#x27;s suffrage. In July 1893, two months after Seddon became Premier, the second of two major petitions for women&#x27;s suffrage was presented to the House.

This resulted in considerable debate within the Liberal Party. John Hall, a former conservative premier, moved a Bill to enact women&#x27;s suffrage. Seddon&#x27;s opponents within the party, led by Stout (also an advocate of temperance), managed to gather enough support for the Bill to be passed despite Seddon&#x27;s opposition. When Seddon realised that the passage of the bill was inevitable, he changed his position, claiming to accept the people&#x27;s will. In actuality, however, he took strong measures to ensure that the Legislative Council would vote down the Bill, as it had done previously. Seddon&#x27;s tactics in lobbying the council were seen by many as underhand, and two Councillors, despite opposing suffrage, voted in favour of the bill in protest. The Bill was granted Royal Assent in September.

Nonetheless, at the 1893 general election in November, Seddon&#x27;s Liberal Party managed to increase its majority.

===Alcohol licensing===

The debate on women&#x27;s suffrage exposed deep divisions within the Liberal Party between more doctrinaire liberals, broadly led by Stout, and &quot;popular&quot; liberals, led by Seddon. This division was again highlighted by the debate over alcohol licensing. Seddon moved the radical Alcoholic Liquors Sale Control Bill in 1893 to introduce licensing districts where a majority could vote for continuance (continued liquor licensing in that district) or reduction of licences or no liquor licences at all. Votes were to be taken every three years at general elections and licensing districts were matched to electoral districts.
===Old-age pensions===
One of the policies for which Seddon is most remembered is his Old-age Pensions Act of 1898, which established the basis of the welfare state later expanded by Michael Joseph Savage and the Labour Party. Seddon put considerable weight behind the scheme, despite considerable opposition from many quarters. Its successful passage is often seen as a testament to Seddon&#x27;s political power and influence.

===Foreign policy===
In the sphere of foreign policy, Seddon was a notable supporter of the British Empire. After he attended the Colonial Conference in London in 1897, he became known &quot;as one of the pillars of British imperialism&quot;, and he was a strong supporter of the Second Boer War and sponsored preferential tariffs for trade with Britain. He is also noted for his support of New Zealand&#x27;s own &quot;imperial&quot; designs – Seddon believed that New Zealand should play a major role in the Pacific Islands as a &quot;Britain of the South&quot;. Seddon&#x27;s plans focused mainly on establishing New Zealand dominion over Fiji and Samoa. However, his expansionist policies were discouraged by the Imperial Government. Only the Cook Islands came under New Zealand&#x27;s control during his term in office.

===Immigration===

Seddon was firmly opposed Chinese immigration to New Zealand, harbouring an ethnic prejudice against them stemming from his years in the goldfields.

Although Chinese immigrants were invited to New Zealand by the Dunedin Chamber of Commerce, prejudice against them quickly led to calls for restrictions on immigration. Following the example of anti-Chinese poll taxes enacted by California in 1852 and by Australian states in the 1850s, 1860s and 1870s, John Hall&#x27;s government passed the Chinese Immigration Act 1881. This imposed a £10 tax per Chinese person entering New Zealand, and permitted only one Chinese immigrant for every 10 tons of cargo. Richard Seddon&#x27;s government increased the tax to £100 per head in 1896 ($20,990 in modern New Zealand dollars), and tightened the other restriction to only one Chinese immigrant for every 200 tons of cargo.

Seddon compared Chinese people to monkeys, and so used the Yellow Peril conspiracy theory to promote racialist politics in New Zealand. In 1879, in his first political speech, Seddon said that New Zealand did not wish her shores &quot;deluged with Asiatic Tartars. I would sooner address white men than these Chinese. You can&#x27;t talk to them, you can&#x27;t reason with them. All you can get from them is &#x27;No savvy&#x27;.&quot;

===Style of government===
Seddon was a strong premier, and enforced his authority with great vigour. At one point, he even commented that &quot;A president is all we require&quot;, and that Cabinet could be abolished. His opponents, both within the Liberal Party and in opposition, accused him of being an autocrat – the label &quot;King Dick&quot; was first applied to him at this point.

Seddon accumulated a large number of portfolios for himself, including that of Minister of Finance (from which he displaced Joseph Ward), Minister of Labour (from which he displaced William Pember Reeves), Minister of Education, Minister of Defence, Minister of Native Affairs, and Minister of Immigration.

Seddon was also accused of cronyism – his friends and allies, particularly those from the West Coast, were given various political positions, while his enemies within the Liberal Party were frequently denied important office. Many of Seddon&#x27;s appointees were not qualified for the positions that they received – Seddon valued loyalty above ability. One account, possibly apocryphal, claims that he installed an ally as a senior civil servant despite the man being illiterate. He was also accused of nepotism – in 1905, it was claimed that one of his sons had received an unauthorised payment, but this claim was proved false.

Sir Carl Berendsen recalled seeing Seddon in 1906 as a Department of Education junior innocently bearing what was an unwelcome document. A replacement was needed for a small native school. The inspectors had picked out three outstanding candidates, but Seddon picked out the last on the lengthy list; he had no academic qualifications and had just been released from gaol for embezzlement. When the Premier appointed the gentlemen from gaol, Departmental officials returned the papers and called attention to his criminal record. Berendsen cowered in the corner while with a snarl Seddon grasped his pen and wrote once more in very large letters, &quot;Appoint Mr X&quot;. Berendsen noted though that when an Editor was required for the new School Journal, Departmental officials had agreed on the best man, but the Massey Government (which had replaced the Liberal Government) was &quot;quite shameless in devotion to the principle of the loaves and fishes... and the Minister of the day appointed the third choice&quot;.

As Minister of Native Affairs, Seddon took a generally &quot;sympathetic&quot; but &quot;paternalistic&quot; approach. As Minister of Immigration, he was well known for his hostility to Chinese immigration – the so-called &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; was an important part of his populist rhetoric, and he compared Chinese people to monkeys. In his first political speech in 1879 he had declared New Zealand did not wish her shores to be &quot;deluged with Asiatic Tartars. I would sooner address white men than these Chinese. You can&#x27;t talk to them, you can&#x27;t reason with them. All you can get from them is &#x27;No savvy&#x27;.&quot;

Successive governments had also shown a lack of firmness in dealing with Māori, he said: &quot;The colony, instead of importing Gatling guns with which to fight Maori, should wage war with locomotives&quot;... pushing through roads and railways and compulsorily purchasing &quot;the land on both sides&quot;.

==Religion and freemasonry==

Seddon was an Anglican.

Seddon became a Freemason in 1868 when he was initiated into Pacific Lodge No 1229 (under the United Grand Lodge of England) in Hokitika. The lodge is still extant, but has since relocated to Christchurch. In 1898, while premier, he was elected Grand Master of New Zealand, and served in that role for two years.

==Honours==
Seddon attended Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee and received her Jubilee Medal and an appointment in the Privy Council. In 1902 he attended the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra and received his Coronation Medal. During the same visit, he received the Freedom of the Borough of his home-town St Helens during a visit there in July 1902, and the Freedom of the City of Edinburgh and an honorary degree LL.D. from the University of Edinburgh during a visit to the city later the same month. He was also presented with the Honorary Freedom of the Worshipful Company of Tallow Chandlers on 8 August 1902.

He twice refused a knighthood, wanting to be seen as a .

==Death==

Seddon remained Prime Minister for 13 years, but gradually, calls for him to retire became more frequent. Various attempts to replace him with Joseph Ward met with failure.

In June 1906, while returning from a trip to Australia on the ship &quot;Oswestry Grange&quot;, he was sitting with his wife in his cabin waiting to be called to dinner when he suddenly placed his head on his wife&#x27;s shoulder, and said, &quot;Oh, mother,&quot; before expiring of a massive heart attack at 6.20 pm on 10 June. Immediately following his death the ship, which was from Sydney Heads, turned back to port, its flag at half-mast. He died 12 days before his 61st birthday, . On the eve of his departure, he had sent a number of telegrams, among whom was one to the premier of Victoria, Thomas Bent, which contained the words, “Just leaving for God&#x27;s own country”.

News of his death provoked numerous public gestures of grief, which included black-bordered displays in shop windows and several public monuments, including a memorial lamp post outside the St Helens Hospital in Pitt Street Auckland.

Seddon’s funeral was held on 21 June 1906 and he was buried in Wellington&#x27;s Bolton Street Cemetery, now Bolton Street Memorial Park.

Joseph Ward was away in London at the time of Seddon&#x27;s death. He succeeded Seddon as Prime Minister nearly two months later, on 6 August 1906.

==Personal life==
Seddon married Louisa Jane Spotswood on 13 January 1869 in Trinity Church, Williamstown, Victoria, Australia. Lousia was born on 28 May 1851 in Williamstown, Victoria, Australia to Anna Victoria (nee Normandale) and John Stuart Spotswood. After a long illness Louisa died at her home, &quot;Eeeleston,” in Wellington on 9 July 1931. Flags were flown at half-mast, on various Government buildings on the day of her funeral.

The couple had the following eleven children with nine surviving to adulthood.
* Jane Anne Seddon. Born 8 May 1870 In Waimea, Westland. She died on 20 August 1955.
* Phoebe Alicia Seddon. Born on 26 June 1871. She died on 5 December 1944.
* Louisa Jane Spottswood Seddon. Born on 10 December 1872 in Big Dam, Westland. She died on 12 October 1957.
* Mary Stuart Charleston Seddon. Born on 20 June 1874 in Charlestown, West Coast. She died on 17 April 1946. Interred with her parents.
* Catherine Youd Lindsay Seddon. Born on 17 January 1876 in Kumara. She died on 20 October 1877.
* Catherine Youd Lindsay Seddon. Born on 24 March 1878 in Kumara, West Coast. She died on 2 July 1881.
* Elizabeth May Seddon. Born on 24 March 1880 in Kumara. She died on 29 February 1960.
* Richard John Spotswood Seddon. Born on 29 May 1881 in Kumara. He was killed in Bagaume, France on 21 August 1918 while serving as a captain with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. Over a ten-year period his mother campaigned without success to have his remains repatriated back to New Zealand. The original wooden cross from Seddon’s grave was brought back to New Zealand by one of his sisters and now resides inside the Seddon Memorial.
* Thomas Edward Youd Seddon. Born 2 July 1884 in Kumara. He died 22 January 1972.
* John Stewart Spotswood Seddon. Born on 20 July 1887 in Kumara. He died in 1969.
* Rubi Jessie Seddon. Born on 11 January 1889 in Kumara. She died on 19 December 1956.

==Legacy==

He is considered by academics and historians to be one of New Zealand&#x27;s greatest and most revered prime ministers. Seddon centralised government decision-making around himself—at his peak he exercised &quot;almost one-man, one-party rule&quot;—and, in doing so, he established the premiership as the &quot;de facto&quot; most important political office in New Zealand.

Seddon&#x27;s son Thomas replaced him as MP for Westland in the by-election following his death. When Thomas met former US President Theodore Roosevelt in 1918, he expressed admiration for his late father, particularly the labour legislation his government passed.

A town in New Zealand and a suburb of Melbourne, Australia are named after him. Wellington Zoo was originally created when a young lion was presented to Prime Minister Richard Seddon by the Bostock and Wombwell Circus. Seddon created the Zoo from this single specimen and the lion was later named King Dick in the Prime Minister&#x27;s honour. The stuffed body of King Dick (the lion) is displayed on the ground floor of the Museum of Wellington City &amp; Sea. St Mary&#x27;s Church in Addington, Christchurch also has a memorial bell tower to Richard Seddon.

The Duke of Argyll unveiled a memorial to Seddon in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London, in 1910. It shows a portrait of Seddon with the inscription &quot;

===Seddon memorial===
Following Seddon&#x27;s death plans were put in place to erect a suitable memorial which would also incorporate a Seddon family mausoleum. It was quickly agreed that the existing Colonial Time Service Observatory on top of Observatory Hill (today part of Bolton Street Memorial Park) should be torn down to make way for it. A new observatory was later constructed on the site of the former Garden coast defence battery at the top of the Botanic Gardens.

The memorial was designed by government architect John Campbell and constructed by Edwards and Son of Wellington with the above ground portion consisting of reinforced concrete faced with Coromandel granite. It cost £2,746. Constructed between 1908 and 1910 the memorial is topped by a bronze female figure approximately in height and weighing symbolising the “Zealandia”, the country mourning its dead. Costing approximately £500, the figure was designed at the London studio of sculptor Henry Poole and cast by Alexander Parlanti. The concrete crypt underneath contains the body of Seddon, his wife Louisa, their daughter Mary Stuart Hay and memorial to their son Captain Richard Spotswood Seddon, who was killed in 1918 while serving in France.

The family remains were temporally removed when between 2021 and December 2022 when the memorial was restored and seismically strengthened by the installation of a structural steel frame in the crypt and central void, combined with the installation of 17 post-tension tie rods. 

===Statues of Seddon===

A high bronze statue on a pedestal of Aberdeen granite to Seddon was erected facing Molesworth Street in front of the main entrance to Parliament Buildings. It was commissioned by then prime minister Sir Jospeh Ward from Sir Thomas Brock. The statue has him wearing a frock coat which was based on the one that he had worn while speaking at Papawai near Greytown. The coat had been brought to Brock in 1905 by Louisa Seddon and her daughter Mary.
The statue was paid for by jointly by the government and the public and. Its completion was delayed by the landscaping of the grounds and the completion of Seddon’s memorial. At a public event attended by 1,500 people on 26 June 1915 the statue was unveiled by the Governor-General, Lord Liverpool. Among those attending were members of Seddon’s family, the prime minister William Massey, Sir Joseph Ward and Sir John Luke, mayor of Wellington.
In October 1966 anti-Vietnam war protestors painted “No New Zealand Troops in Vietnam” across the plinth. In November 1988 a group protesting against the signing of the Antarctic convention and the risk they believed it posed to wildlife enclosed the statue in a giant penguin suit. In February 2022, an anti-mandate and anti-lockdown Covid-19 protestor tagged it with a Nazi Swastika and the words “Freedom” and “Truth”. 

Since 11 November 1981 the statue has had a Historic Places category 1 listing.

Another statue of Seddon has a prominent position in the West Coast town of Hokitika.

<text>Dame Tracey Karima Emin (; born 3 July 1963) is an English artist known for autobiographical and confessional artwork. She produces work in a variety of media including drawing, painting, sculpture, film, photography, neon text and sewn appliqué. Once the &quot;&quot; of the Young British Artists in the 1980s, Tracey Emin is now a Royal Academician.

In 1997, her work &quot;Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995&quot;, a tent appliquéd with the names of everyone the artist had ever slept with, was shown at Charles Saatchi&#x27;s &quot;Sensation&quot; exhibition held at the Royal Academy in London. In the same year, she gained considerable media exposure when she swore repeatedly when drunk on a live British TV discussion programme called &quot;The Death of Painting&quot;.

In 1999, Emin had her first solo exhibition in the United States at Lehmann Maupin Gallery, entitled &quot;Every Part of Me&#x27;s Bleeding&quot;. Later that year, she was a Turner Prize nominee and exhibited &quot;My Bed&quot; – a readymade installation, consisting of her own unmade dirty bed, in which she had spent several weeks drinking, smoking, eating, sleeping and having sexual intercourse while undergoing a period of severe emotional flux. The artwork featured used condoms and blood-stained underwear.

Emin is also a panellist and speaker: she has lectured at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney (2010), the Royal Academy of Arts (2008), and the Tate Britain in London (2005) about the links between creativity and autobiography, and the role of subjectivity and personal histories in constructing art. In December 2011, she was appointed Professor of Drawing at the Royal Academy; with Fiona Rae, she is one of the first two female professors since the Academy was founded in 1768. Emin lived in Spitalfields, East London, before returning to Margate, where she funds the &quot;TKE Studios&quot; with workspace for aspiring artists.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===

Emin was born in Croydon, a district of south London, to an English mother of Romanichal descent and a Turkish Cypriot father. She was brought up in Margate, Kent, with her twin brother, Paul.

Emin shares a paternal great-grandfather with her second cousin Meral Hussein-Ece, Baroness Hussein-Ece.

Her work has been analysed within the context of early adolescent and childhood abuse, as well as sexual assault. Emin was raped at the age of 13 while living in Margate, citing assaults in the area as &quot;what happened to a lot of girls.&quot; Emin later said in an article she wrote for the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; that she had &quot;no memory of being a virgin&quot;, citing numerous times she was raped as a young teenager.

She studied fashion at Medway College of Design (now part of the University for the Creative Arts) (1980–82). There she met expelled student Billy Childish and was associated with The Medway Poets. Emin and Childish were a couple until 1987, during which time she was the administrator for his small press, Hangman Books, which published Childish&#x27;s confessional poetry. From 1983–86 she studied printmaking at Maidstone Art College (now part of the University for the Creative Arts). She graduated with a first class degree in Printmaking. Also, whilst at Maidstone college of Art, Tracey Emin encountered Roberto Navickas aka Roberto Navikas, a name which was later to feature prominently in her &quot;tent&quot;. Emin however, mistakenly misspelled his name by dropping a C. Navickas used this error to promote two artworks of his own, some twenty odd years later when re-entering the art world. The works were titled &quot;The Lost C of Emin: The Discovery&quot; &amp; &quot;The Lost C of Emin: A Reliquary&quot;. (see tent below).

In 1995, she was interviewed in the &quot;Minky Manky&quot; show catalogue by Carl Freedman, who asked her, &quot;Which person do you think has had the greatest influence on your life?&quot; She replied, &quot;Uhmm... It&#x27;s not a person really. It was more a time, going to Maidstone College of Art, hanging around with Billy Childish, living by the River Medway&quot;.

In 1987, Emin moved to London to study at the Royal College of Art, where in 1989 she obtained an MA in painting. After graduation, she had two traumatic abortions and those experiences led her to destroy all the art she had produced in graduate school and later described the period as &quot;emotional suicide&quot;. Her influences included Edvard Munch and Egon Schiele, and for a time she studied philosophy at Birkbeck, University of London.

One of the paintings that survive from her time at Royal College of Art is &quot;Friendship&quot;, which is in the Royal College of Art Collection. Additionally, a series of photographs from her early work that was not destroyed was displayed as part of &quot;My Major Retrospective&quot;.

===Career beginnings===
In 1993, Emin opened a shop with fellow artist Sarah Lucas, called &quot;The Shop&quot; at 103 Bethnal Green Road in Bethnal Green, which sold works by the two of them, including T-shirts and ashtrays with Damien Hirst&#x27;s picture stuck to the bottom.

In November 1993, Emin had her first solo show at White Cube, a contemporary art gallery in London. It was called &quot;My Major Retrospective&quot;, and was autobiographical, consisting of personal photographs, photos of her (destroyed) early paintings, as well as items which most artists would not consider showing in public (such as a packet of cigarettes her uncle was holding when he was decapitated in a car crash).

In the mid-1990s, Emin had a relationship with Carl Freedman, who had been an early friend of, and collaborator with, Damien Hirst, and who had co-curated seminal Britart shows, such as &quot;Modern Medicine&quot; and &quot;Gambler&quot;. In 1994, they toured the US together, driving in a Cadillac from San Francisco to New York, and making stops en route where she gave readings from her autobiographical book &quot;Exploration of the Soul&quot; to finance the trip.

The couple spent time by the sea in Whitstable together, using a beach hut that she uprooted and turned into art in 1999 with the title &quot;The Last Thing I Said to You is Don&#x27;t Leave Me Here&quot;, and that was destroyed in the 2004 Momart warehouse fire.
In 1995, Freedman curated the show &quot;Minky Manky&quot; at the South London Gallery. Emin has said,

The result was her &quot;tent&quot; &quot;Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995&quot;, which was first exhibited in the show. It was a blue tent, appliquéd with the names of everyone she has slept with. These included sexual partners, plus relatives she slept with as a child, her twin brother, and her two aborted children.

The needlework which is integral to this work was used by Emin in a number of her other pieces. This piece was later bought by Charles Saatchi and included in the successful 1997 Sensation exhibition at the Royal Academy; it then toured to Berlin and New York. It, too, was destroyed by the fire in Saatchi&#x27;s east London warehouse, in 2004.

===Public recognition===
Emin was largely unknown by the public until she appeared on a Channel 4 television programme in 1997, &quot;&quot;Is Painting Dead?&quot;&quot;. The show comprised a group discussion about that year&#x27;s Turner Prize and was broadcast live. Emin said she was drunk, slurred and swore before walking out. From the interview: &quot;Are they really real people in England watching this programme now, they really watching, really watching it?&quot;

Two years later, in 1999, Emin was shortlisted for the Turner Prize herself and exhibited &quot;My Bed&quot; at the Tate Gallery.

There was considerable media attention regarding the apparently trivial and possibly unhygienic elements of the installation, such as yellow stains on the bedsheets, condoms, empty cigarette packets, and a pair of knickers with menstrual stains. The bed was presented as it had been when she had stayed in it for several days, feeling suicidal because of relationship difficulties.

Two performance artists, Yuan Chai and Jian Jun Xi, jumped onto the bed with bare torsos to &quot;improve&quot; the work, which they thought had not gone far enough.

In July 1999, at the height of Emin&#x27;s Turner Prize fame, she created a number of monoprints drawings inspired by the public and private life of Princess Diana for a themed exhibition called &quot;Temple of Diana&quot; held at The Blue Gallery, London. Works such as &quot;They Wanted You To Be Destroyed&quot; (1999) related to Princess Diana&#x27;s bulimia, while other monoprints included affectionate texts such as &quot;Love Was on Your Side&quot; and a description of Princess Diana&#x27;s &quot;dress with puffy sleeves&quot;. Other drawings highlighted &quot;The things you did to help other people&quot; written next to a drawing by Emin of Diana, Princess of Wales in protective clothing walking through a minefield in Angola. Another work was a delicate sketch of a rose drawn next to the phrase &quot;It makes perfect sence to know they killed you&quot; (with Emin&#x27;s trademark spelling mistakes) referring to the conspiracy theories surrounding Princess Diana&#x27;s death. Emin herself described the drawings, saying they &quot;could be considered quite scrappy, fresh, kind of naïve looking drawings&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s pretty difficult for me to do drawings not about me and about someone else. But I have did have a lot of ideas. They&#x27;re quite sentimental I think and there&#x27;s nothing cynical about it whatsoever.&quot;

Elton John collects Emin&#x27;s work, as did George Michael. Michael and his partner Kenny Goss held the &quot;A Tribute To Tracey Emin&quot; exhibition in September 2007 at their Dallas-based museum, the Goss-Michael Foundation (formerly Goss Gallery).

This was the inaugural exhibition for the gallery which displayed a variety of Emin works from a large blanket, video installations, prints, paintings and a number of neon works including a special neon piece &quot;George Loves Kenny&quot; (2007) which was the centrepiece of the exhibition, developed by Emin after she wrote an article for &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper in February 2007 with the same title. Goss and Michael (died 25 December 2016), acquired 25 works by Emin.

Other celebrities and musicians who support Emin&#x27;s art include models Jerry Hall and Naomi Campbell, film star Orlando Bloom who bought a number of Emin&#x27;s works at charity auctions and pop band Temposhark, whose lead singer collects Emin&#x27;s art, named their debut album &quot;The Invisible Line&quot;, inspired by passages from Emin&#x27;s book &quot;Exploration of The Soul&quot;. Rock legend Ronnie Wood of the Rolling Stones is a well documented friend of Emin, whose own paintings are inspired by Emin&#x27;s work. In 2004 Emin presented Madonna with the &quot;UK Music Hall of Fame&quot; award.

Emin was invited to Madonna&#x27;s country estate Ashcombe and has been described by the singer, &quot;Tracey is intelligent and wounded and not afraid to expose herself,&quot; she says. &quot;She is provocative but she has something to say. I can relate to that.&quot; David Bowie, a childhood inspiration of Emin&#x27;s, also became friends with the artist. Bowie once described Emin as &quot;William Blake as a woman, written by Mike Leigh&quot;.

Like the George Michael and Kenny Goss neon, Emin created a unique neon work for her supermodel friend Kate Moss called &quot;Moss Kin&quot;. In 2004, it was reported that this unique piece had been discovered dumped in a skip in east London. The piece, consisting of neon tubing spelling the words &quot;Moss Kin&quot;, had been mistakenly thrown out of a basement, owned by the craftsman who made the glass. The artwork was never collected by Moss and had therefore been stored for three years in the basement of a specialist artist used by Emin in the Spitalfields area. It was accidentally dumped when the craftsman moved. The term used in the work &quot;Kin&quot; is a recurring theme of Emin&#x27;s to describe those dear to her, her loved ones. Other examples can be seen in a monoprint called &quot;MatKin&quot; dedicated to her then boyfriend artist Mat Collishaw and released as an aquatint limited edition in 1997. Emin created a nude drawing of Kate Moss known as &quot;Kate&quot; (2000), signed and dated as &quot;1 February 2000&quot; in pencil by the artist. In 2006, the same image was released as a limited edition etching, but renamed as &quot;Kate Moss 2000&quot; (2006). Emin&#x27;s work was included in the 2022 exhibition &quot;Women Painting Women&quot; at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth.

===Stuckism===
Emin&#x27;s relationship with the artist and musician Billy Childish led to the name of the Stuckism movement in 1999. Childish, who had mocked her new affiliation to conceptualism in the early 1990s, was told by Emin, &quot;Your paintings are stuck, you are stuck! – Stuck! Stuck! Stuck!&quot; (that is, stuck in the past for not accepting the YBA approach to art). He recorded the incident in the poem, &quot;Poem for a Pissed Off Wife&quot; published in &quot;Big Hart and Balls&quot; Hangman Books 1994, from which Charles Thomson, who knew them both, later coined the term Stuckism.

Emin and Childish had remained on friendly terms up until 1999, but the activities of the Stuckist group offended her and caused a lasting rift with Childish. In a 2003 interview, she was asked about the Stuckists:

Childish left the Stuckist movement in 2001.

===Modern Art Oxford (2002–03)===
From November 2002 to January 2003, Tracey Emin&#x27;s solo exhibition &quot;This Is Another Place&quot; was held at Modern Art Oxford and marked the museum&#x27;s reopening and renaming to Modern Art Oxford. The exhibition was Emin&#x27;s first British exhibition since 1997. The exhibition contained drawings, etchings, film, neon works such as &quot;Fuck off and die, you slag&quot;, and sculptures including a large-scale wooden pier, called &quot;Knowing My Enemy&quot;, with a wooden shack on top made from reclaimed timber.

Emin commented that she decided to exhibit in Oxford as museum director Andrew Nairne had always been &quot;a big supporter of my work&quot;. An exhibition catalogue included 50 illustrations: &quot;a compilation of images and writings reflecting her life, her sexual experiences and her desires and fears.&quot;

===Momart fire (2004)===
On 24 May 2004, a fire in a Momart storage warehouse in East London destroyed many works from the Saatchi collection, including Emin&#x27;s famous tent with appliquéd letters, &quot;Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995&quot; (&quot;The Tent&quot;) (1995) and &quot;The Last Thing I Said To You Is Don&#x27;t Leave Me Here&quot; (&quot;The Hut&quot;) (1999), Emin&#x27;s blue wooden beach hut that she bought with fellow artist Sarah Lucas and shared with her boyfriend of the time, the gallerist Carl Freedman. Emin spoke out angrily against what she perceived as a general public lack of sympathy, and even amusement, at the loss of the artworks in the fire. She commented, &quot;I&#x27;m also upset about those people whose wedding got bombed last week [in Iraq], and people being dug out from under 400ft of mud in the Dominican Republic.&quot;

===Venice Biennale (2007)===
In August 2006, the British Council announced that they had chosen Emin to produce a show of new and past works for the British Pavilion at the 52nd Venice Biennale in 2007. Emin was the second woman to produce a solo show for the UK at the Biennale, following Rachel Whiteread in 1997. Andrea Rose, the commissioner for the British Pavilion, stated that the exhibition would allow Emin&#x27;s work to be viewed &quot;in an international context and at a distance from the YBA generation with which she came to prominence.&quot;.

Emin picked the title &quot;Borrowed Light&quot; for the exhibition. She produced new work especially for the British Pavilion, using a wide variety of media – from needlework, photography and video to drawing, painting, sculpture and neon. A promotional British Council flyer included an image of a previously unseen monoprint for the exhibition called &quot;Fat Minge&quot; (1994) that was included in the show, while the &quot;Telegraph&quot; newspaper featured a photo of a new purple neon &quot;Legs I&quot; (2007) that was on display (directly inspired by Emin&#x27;s 2004 purple watercolour &quot;Purple Virgin&quot; series). Emin summed up her Biennale exhibition work as &quot;Pretty and hard-core&quot;.

Emin was interviewed about the Venice Biennale by the BBC&#x27;s Kirsty Wark in November 2006. Emin showed Wark some work-in-progress, which included large-scale canvases with paintings of Emin&#x27;s legs and vagina. Starting with the &quot;Purple Virgin&quot; (2004) acrylic watercolour series with their strong purple brush strokes depicting Emin&#x27;s naked open legs, leading to Emin&#x27;s paintings in 2005-6 such as &quot;Asleep Alone With Legs Open&quot; (2005), the &quot;Reincarnation&quot; (2005) series and &quot;Masturbating&quot; (2006) amongst others, these works were a significant new development in her artistic output.

Andrea Rose, the British Pavilion commissioner, added to this commenting on the art Emin has produced, &quot;It&#x27;s remarkably ladylike. There is no ladette work – no toilet with a poo in it – and actually it is very mature I think, quite lovely. She is much more interested in formal values than people might expect, and it shows in this exhibition. It&#x27;s been revelatory working with her. Tracey&#x27;s reputation for doing shows and hanging them is not good, but she&#x27;s been a dream to work with. What it shows is that she&#x27;s moved a long way away from the YBAs. She&#x27;s quite a lady actually!&quot;

===Royal Academician (2007)===
On 29 March 2007, Tracey Emin was made a Royal Academician by the Royal Academy of Arts. In becoming a member of the Royal Academy Emin joined an elite group of artists that includes David Hockney, Peter Blake, Anthony Caro and Alison Wilding. Her Academician status entitles Emin to exhibit up to six works in the annual summer exhibition.

Emin had previously been invited to include works at the R.A. Summer Exhibitions of 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2001. For 2004&#x27;s Summer Exhibition, Emin was chosen by fellow artist David Hockney to submit two monoprints, one called &quot;And I&#x27;d Love To Be The One&quot; (1997) and another on the topic of Emin&#x27;s abortion called &quot;Ripped Up&quot; (1995), as that year&#x27;s theme celebrated the art of drawing as part of the creative process, while 2007 saw Emin exhibit a neon work called &quot;Angel&quot; (2005). Her art was first exhibited at the Royal Academy as part of the &quot;Sensation&quot; exhibition in 1997.

For the June 2008 Summer Exhibition, Emin was invited to curate a gallery. Emin also gave a public talk in June 2008 interviewed by art critic and broadcaster Matthew Collings, contemplating her role within the Royal Academy, the Academy&#x27;s relationship to the contemporary art world, and her perspective, as an artist, on hanging and curating a gallery in the Summer Exhibition. She exhibited her famous &quot;Space Monkey – We Have Lift Off&quot; print at the 2009 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition.

===&quot;Twenty Years&quot; retrospective (2008)===
The first major retrospective of Emin&#x27;s work was held in Edinburgh between August and November 2008 attracting over 40,000 visitors, breaking the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art&#x27;s record for an exhibition of work by a living artist.

The large-scale exhibition included the full range of Emin&#x27;s art from the rarely seen early work to the iconic &quot;My Bed&quot; (1998) and the room-sized installation &quot;Exorcism of the Last Painting I Ever Made&quot; (1996). The show displayed her unique appliquéd blankets, paintings, sculptures, films, neons, drawings and monoprints. The Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art was the only UK venue for the show which then went to the Centro de Arte Contemporáneo in Málaga, Spain and then to the Kunstmuseum in Bern, Switzerland from 2009.

It was reported on 6 November 2008 that Emin gifted a major sculpture to the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art as a &quot;thank you&quot; to both the gallery and the city of Edinburgh. The work called &quot;Roman Standard&quot; (2005) comprises a bronze pole, surmounted by a little bird, cast in bronze. The work has an estimated value of at least £75,000.

===&quot;Love Is What You Want&quot; retrospective (2011)===
In May–August 2011, a major survey exhibition at London&#x27;s Hayward Gallery consisted of work from all aspects of Emin&#x27;s art practice, revealing facets of the artist and her work that are frequently overlooked. The exhibition included painting, drawing, photography, textiles, video and sculpture, with rarely before seen early works alongside more recent large-scale installations. Emin made a new series of outdoor sculptures especially for this solo show.

===&quot;The Vanishing Lake – Frieze Fair (2011)&quot;===
On 6 October 2011, Emin opened a site-specific exhibition at a Georgian house on Fitzroy Square. The title is taken from her novel which has served as a catalyst for a series of works, created for a neoclassical house designed by Robert Adam in 1794. The exhibition also featured a series of embroidered texts and hand-woven tapestries which continued Emin&#x27;s interest in domestic and handcrafted traditions. Emin herself has said that, &quot;I called it that because I saw part of myself as drying and not there anymore and I wanted to question the whole idea of love and passion, whether love exists anymore...Why? Because I&#x27;m nearly 50, I&#x27;m single, because I don&#x27;t have children.&quot;

===London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games===
Emin was a mentor on the &quot;BA Great Britons Programme&quot;. She also produced a poster and limited edition print for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, one of only 12 British artists selected. On 19 July 2012, Emin carried the Olympic torch through her hometown of Margate.

=== Joint exhibit with Edvard Munch ===
In December 2020, Emin had a gallery exhibition containing works by Edvard Munch, entitled &quot;The Loneliness of the Soul&quot;, at the Royal Academy of Arts. Emin selected 19 pieces of Munch&#x27;s work to be displayed alongside 25 pieces of her own. Simultaneously, she had a show at London&#x27;s White Cube gallery which included a short Super-8 film in tribute to Munch.

The exhibition was re-shown at the newly opened Munch Museum in Oslo, with Emin being the first artist to show alongside the Norwegian painter. Works included recent paintings, as well as her seminal work &quot;My Bed&quot;. Emin had suffered from cancer in the year before the exhibit, and was unsure whether she would be able to see it herself. The exhibition travelled to the Royal Academy of Arts in London in 2021. Reviewing the exhibition for &quot;Londonist&quot;, Tabish Khan said: “It captures that sense of loneliness I&#x27;ve struggled to put into words, and left me emotionally spent&quot;. It was also reviewed favourably in The Guardian with Tim Adams writing &quot;This exhibition is not comprehensive enough to be billed as a retrospective, but even so, everything that Emin has made and felt and suffered in the past is brought to full expression in it&quot;.

=== &quot;By The Time You See Me There Will Be Nothing Left&quot; (2024) ===
An exhibition of Emin&#x27;s work produced post-cancer diagnosis began on 24 May 2024 and will continue until 27 July. The show includes &quot;You Keep Fucking Me&quot; and is held in the Xavier Hufkens gallery in Brussels. She told &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s the best show I have ever done.&quot;

==Artistic work==

===Monoprints===

Emin&#x27;s monoprints are a well documented part of her creative output. These unique drawings represent a diaristic aspect and frequently depict events from the past for example, &quot;Poor Love&quot; (1999), &quot;From The Week of Hell &#x27;94&quot; (1995) and &quot;Ripped Up&quot; (1995), which relate to a traumatic experience after an abortion or other personal events as seen in &quot;Fuck You Eddy&quot; (1995) and &quot;Sad Shower in New York&quot; (1995) which are both part of the Tate&#x27;s collection of Emin&#x27;s art.

Often they incorporate text as well as image, although some bear only text and others only image. The text appears as the artist&#x27;s stream of consciousness voice. Some critics have compared Emin&#x27;s text-only monoprints to ransom notes. The rapid, one-off technique involved in making monoprints is perfectly suited to (apparently) immediate expression, as is Emin&#x27;s scratchy and informal drawing style. Emin frequently misspells words, deliberately or due to the speed at which she did each drawing. In a 2002 interview with Lynn Barber, Emin said: &quot;It&#x27;s not cute affectation. If I could spell, then I would spell correctly, but I never bothered to learn. So, rather than be inhibited and say I can&#x27;t write because I can&#x27;t spell, I just write and get on with it.&quot;

Emin created a key series of monoprints in 1997 with the text &quot;Something&#x27;s Wrong&quot; or &quot;There Must Be Something Terebley Wrong With Me&quot; written with spelling mistakes intact in large capital letters alongside &quot;forlorn figures surrounded by space, their outlines fragile on the page. Some are complete bodies, others only female torsos, legs splayed and with odd, spidery flows gushing from their vaginas. They are all accompanied by the legend &quot;There&#x27;s Something Wrong&quot;.&quot;

Other key monoprints include a series from 1994 and 1995 known as the &quot;Illustrations from Memory&quot; series which document Emin&#x27;s childhood memories of sexual awakening and other experiences growing up in Margate such as &quot;Fucking Down An Ally 16/5/95&quot; (1995) and &quot;Illustrations from Memory, the year 1974. In The Livingroom&quot; (1994). Emin further produced a set of monoprints detailing her memories of Margate&#x27;s iconic buildings such as &quot;Margate Harbour 16/5/95&quot; (1995), &quot;The Lido 16/5/95&quot; (1995) and &quot;Light House 15/5/95&quot; (1995). Other drawings from 1994 include the &quot;Family Suite&quot; series, part of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art collection, consisting of 20 monoprints with &quot;archetypal themes in Emin&#x27;s art: sex, her family, her abortions, and Margate&quot;. This series of monoprints was displayed for the first time from August 2008 at the Edinburgh based gallery as part of her first major retrospective, which has been called the &quot;Summer Blockbuster&quot; exhibition. A further &quot;Family Suite II&quot; set was exhibited in Los Angeles in November 2007 as part of Emin&#x27;s solo show at Gagosian gallery.

Emin&#x27;s monoprints are rarely displayed alone in exhibitions, they&#x27;re particularly effective as collective fragments of intense emotional confrontation. Emin has made several works documenting painful moments of sadness and loneliness experienced when travelling to foreign cities for various exhibitions such as &quot;Thinking of You&quot; (2005) and &quot;Bath White I&quot; (2005) which were from a series of monoprints drawn directly onto the USA Mondrian hotel stationery. Emin herself has said, &quot;Being an artist isn&#x27;t just about making nice things, or people patting you on the back; it&#x27;s some kind of communication, a message.&quot;

In 2009, Emin along with book publisher Rizzoli released a book titled &quot;One Thousand Drawings&quot;. As the title suggests, the book contains 1000 drawings of Emin&#x27;s career since 1988. The book was released to coincide with Emin&#x27;s show &quot;Those who suffer love&quot; at White Cube which was mainly a drawings show. Emin said in an interview that &quot;We actually looked at about 2000 drawings and then chose 1000 drawings [for the book]... I&#x27;d probably done, over that period of time about 4000 drawings&quot;.

Monoprint drawings of mothers and children that Emin drew during a pregnancy in 1990 were included in a 2010 joint exhibition with Paula Rego and Mat Collishaw at the Foundling Museum.

Rarely exhibited examples of monoprints gifted to friends and family of Emin form a niche but revealing body of work. These may show Emin&#x27;s work in the most raw and uncensored from. Emin has gifted monoprints to individuals including her brother Paul Emin and the singer Cat Stevens (Yusuf Islam) with whom she shares Cypriot heritage.

===Painting===
Emin displayed six small watercolours in her Turner Prize exhibition in 1999, and also in her New York show &quot;Every Part of Me&#x27;s Bleeding&quot; held that same year, known as the &quot;Berlin Watercolour&quot; series (1998). These delicate, washed out but colourful watercolours include four portraits of Emin&#x27;s face and were all painted by Emin in Berlin during 1998, adapted from Polaroids of the artist taking a bath. Each unique painting from this series share the same title, &quot;Berlin The Last Week in April 1998&quot;. Simon Wilson, spokesperson for the Tate, commented that Emin included the set of tiny Berlin watercolours &quot;as a riposte to the accusation that there are no paintings&quot; in the Turner Prize exhibitions. The bath theme seen in these watercolours was later revisited by Emin in her photographic work &quot;Sometimes I Feel Beautiful&quot; (2000) and in monoprints such as the &quot;Bath White&quot; (2005) series. With all these works, Emin explores a Mary Cassatt quality of the &quot;woman in a private moment&quot;.

Emin&#x27;s focus on painting has developed over the past few years, starting with the &quot;Purple Virgin&quot; (2004) acrylic watercolour series of purple brush strokes depicting her naked open legs, and leading to paintings such as &quot;Asleep Alone With Legs Open&quot; (2005), the &quot;Reincarnation&quot; (2005) series and &quot;Masturbating&quot; (2006), among others.

In May 2005, London&#x27;s &quot;Evening Standard&quot; newspaper highlighted Emin&#x27;s return to painting in their preview of her &quot;When I Think About Sex&quot; exhibition at White Cube. Other works were nude self-portrait drawings. Emin was quoted as saying, &quot;For this show I wanted to show that I can really draw, and I think they are really sexy drawings.&quot;

Work for her 2007 show at the Venice Biennale included large-scale canvases of her legs and vagina. A watercolour series called &quot;The Purple Virgins&quot; were displayed. There are ten &quot;Purple Virgin&quot; works in total, six of which were shown at the Biennale. These were accompanied by two canvases of a similar style called &quot;How I Think I Feel 1 and 2&quot;. The Venice Biennale was also the first time Emin&#x27;s &quot;Abortion Watercolour&quot; series, painted in 1990, had ever been shown in public.

Jay Jopling presented a new Emin painting, &quot;Rose Virgin&quot; (2007), as part of White Cube&#x27;s stand at the Frieze Art Fair in London&#x27;s Regent&#x27;s Park on 10 October 2007. More new paintings are expected to be shown in Emin&#x27;s &quot;You Left Me Breathing&quot; exhibition in Los Angeles&#x27; Gagosian gallery from 2 November 2007, described in a recent interview as an &#x27;exhibition of sculpture and painting&#x27;. A number of new paintings were on display including &quot;Get Ready for the Fuck of Your Life&quot; (2007).

An article by the art critic Alastair Sooke, published in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, in October 2014, discussed Emin&#x27;s change of direction from conceptual pieces to painting and sculpture. Sooke claimed that although Emin was appointed Professor of Drawing at the Royal Academy in 2011, she has been taking drawing lessons privately for some years in New York, and that she had also been taking sculpture lessons for at least three years. Neither Emin or Jay Jopling have commented on the article.

===Photography===
Emin has produced many photographic works throughout her career, including &quot;Monument Valley (Grand Scale)&quot; (1995–97) and &quot;Outside Myself (Monument Valley, reading &quot;Exploration of the Soul&quot;)&quot; (1995) which resulted &quot;from a trip Emin made to the United States in 1994. She and her then boyfriend, writer, curator and gallery owner Carl Freedman, drove from San Francisco to New York, stopping off along the way to give readings from her 1994 book, &quot;Exploration of the Soul&quot;. The photograph shows the artist sitting in an upholstered chair in Monument Valley, a spectacular location on the southern border of Utah with northern Arizona, holding her book. Although it is open, it is not clear whether she is looking at the viewer or at the text in front of her. Emin gave her readings sitting in the chair, which she had inherited from her grandmother, which also became part of Emin&#x27;s art, &quot;There&#x27;s A Lot of Money in Chairs&quot; (1994).&quot;

Other photographic works include a series of nine images comprising the work &quot;Naked Photos – Life Model Goes Mad&quot; (1996) documenting a painting performance Emin made in a room specially built in Galleri Andreas Brändström, Stockholm. Another photographic series, &quot;Trying on Clothes From My Friends (She Took The Shirt Off His Back)&quot; (1997), shows the artist trying on her friends&#x27; clothes offering up questions of identity.

Other works such as &quot;I&#x27;ve Got It All&quot; (2000) show Emin with her &quot;legs splayed on a red floor, clutching banknotes and coins to her crotch. Made at a time of public and financial success, the image connects the artist&#x27;s desire for money and success and her sexual desire (her role as consumer) with her use of her body and her emotional life to produce her art (the object of consumption)&quot;, while &quot;Sometimes I Feel Beautiful&quot; (2000) pictures Emin lying alone in a bath. Both these works are examples of her using &quot;large-scale photographs of herself to record and express moments of emotional significance in her life, frequently making reference to her career as an artist. The photographs have a staged quality, as though the artist is enacting a private ritual.&quot;

Emin&#x27;s two self-portraits taken inside her beach hut, &quot;The Last Thing I Said To You Is Don&#x27;t Leave Me Here I&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Last Thing I Said To You Is Don&#x27;t Leave Me Here II&quot; (2000) are a diptych although they are often exhibited and sold separately. They depict a naked Emin on her knees inside her beach hut which she and friend Sarah Lucas had bought in Whitstable, Kent in 1992.

The hut itself later became the sculpture &quot;The Last Thing I Said To You Is Don&#x27;t Leave Me Here (The Hut)&quot; (1999). They are part of museum collections including Tate Modern, the Saatchi Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery and have been mass produced as postcards sold in museum shops around the world.

===Neon===
Emin has also worked with neon lights. One such piece is &quot;You Forgot To Kiss My Soul&quot; (2001) which consists of those words in blue neon inside a neon heart-shape. Another neon piece is made from the words &quot;Is Anal Sex Legal&quot; (1998). to complement another &quot;Is Legal Sex Anal&quot; (1998)

For the Venice Biennale, she produced a series of new purple neon works, for example, &quot;Legs I&quot; (2007). This 2007 series of &quot;Legs&quot; neon works were directly inspired by the &quot;Purple Virgin&quot; (2004) watercolour series. For example, &quot;Legs IV&quot; (2007) directly follows the watercolour lines of the &quot;Purple Virgin 9&quot; (2004). For a joint 2010 exhibition with Paula Rego and Mat Collishaw, she decorated the front of the Foundling Museum with the neon words &quot;Foundlings and fledglings are angels of this earth&quot;.

Emin has donated neon work to auction for charity and in 2007, her neon &quot;Keep Me Safe&quot; reached the highest price ever made for one of her neon works of over £60,000. A brand new neon piece called &quot;With You I Want To Live&quot; was shown as part of Emin&#x27;s &quot;You Left Me Breathing&quot; exhibition in 2007 at the Gagosian Gallery in Los Angeles.

In 2018, Emin&#x27;s largest neon work was displayed at London St Pancras Station, the work called &quot;I Want My Time With You&quot; hangs below the large central clock in the station. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Emin stated that the work was a message to the rest of europe during the Brexit Crisis. Passengers disembarking Eurostar trains from Paris, Brussels, and Amsterdam arrive at the station every day underneath the work.

===Fabric===
Emin frequently works with fabric in the form of appliqués – material (often cut out into lettering) sewn onto other material. She collects fabric from curtains, bed sheets and linen and has done so for most of her life. She keeps such material that holds emotional significance for later use in her work. Many of her large-scale appliqués are made on hotel linens, for example, &quot;It Always Hurts&quot; (2005), &quot;Sometimes I Feel So Fucking Lost&quot; (2005), &quot;Volcano Closed&quot; (2001) and &quot;Helter Fucking Skelter&quot; (2001). &quot;Hate And Power Can Be A Terrible Thing&quot; (2004), part of the Tate&#x27;s collection of Emin&#x27;s work, is a large-scale blanket inspired in part by Margaret Thatcher due to her involvement in &quot;an attack on 800 boys and men in the Argentinian navy&quot; and other women for example women who steals their friends&#x27; boyfriends, Emin says of this work &quot;about the kind of women I hate, the kind of women I have no respect for, women who betray and destroy the hearts of other women&quot;.

Emin&#x27;s use of fabric is diverse, one of her most famous works came from sewing letters onto her grandmother&#x27;s armchair in &quot;There&#x27;s A Lot of Money in Chairs&quot; (1994). The chair was very detailed, &quot;including her and her twin brother&#x27;s names, the year of her grandmother&#x27;s birth (1901) and the year of her death (1963) on either side of the words another world, referring to the passing of time. An exchange between the artist and her grandmother using the nicknames they had for each other: ″&quot;Ok Puddin, Thanks Plum&quot;″, covers the bottom front of the chair and a saying of Emin&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s, &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of money in chairs&quot;, is appliquéd in pink along the top and front of its back. Behind the chair back, the first page of &quot;Exploration of the Soul&quot;, handwritten onto fabric, is appliquéd together with other dictums such as, &quot;It&#x27;s not what you inherit. It&#x27;s what you do with your inheritance&quot;.

Emin used the chair on a trip Emin made to the United States in 1994. Driving from San Francisco to New York stopping off along the way to give readings from her book, &quot;Exploration of the Soul&quot; (1994). Emin gave her readings sitting in the upholstered chair and &quot;as she crossed the United States, the artist sewed the names of the places she visited – San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Las Vegas, Monument Valley, Detroit, Pittsburgh, New York – onto the front of the chair&quot;. Emin also posed in the chair for two of her photographic works (see Photography) while in Monument Valley, in the Arizona Desert. It is currently on public display at Pallant House Gallery until 6 March 2011 as part of the exhibition, &#x27;Contemporary Eye: Crossovers&#x27;, pallant.org.uk. Retrieved 6 May 2016.

Emin has made a large number of smaller-scale works, often including hand sewn words and images, such as &quot;Falling Stars&quot; (2001), &quot;It Could Have Been Something&quot; (2001), &quot;Always Sorry&quot; (2005) and &quot;As Always&quot; (2005).

On 13 April 2007, Emin launched a specially designed flag made out of fabric with the message &quot;One Secret Is To Save Everything&quot; written in orange-red letters across the banner made up of hand-sewn swimming sperm. Tracey Emin&#x27;s flag, at 21 feet by 14 feet, flew above the Jubilee Gardens in the British capital until 31 July 2007, with the parliament building and the London Eye as backdrops. Emin called the artwork &quot;a flag made from wishful thinking&quot;. The flag was commissioned by the South Bank Centre in London&#x27;s Waterloo.

In June 2007, on returning from the Venice Biennale, Emin donated a piece of artwork, a handsewn blanket called &quot;Star Trek Voyager&quot; to be auctioned at Elton John&#x27;s annual glamorous White Tie &amp; Tiara Ball to raise money for The Elton John AIDS Foundation. The piece of artwork sold for £800,000.

Emin&#x27;s works on fabric has been related to other artists such as Louise Bourgeois, who Emin actually mentions in a sewn work called &quot;The Older Woman&quot; (2005) with the phrase (monoprint on fabric), &quot;I think my Dad should have gone out with someone older like Louise, Louise Bourgeois&quot;. She was interviewed by Alan Yentob during the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot; documentary &quot;Spiderwoman&quot; about Louise Bourgeois, aired in the UK on 13 November 2007.

===Found objects===

Emin has often made use of found objects in her work from the early use of a cigarette box found in a car crash in which her uncle died. The most well known example is &quot;My Bed&quot;, where she displayed her bed. Another instance is the removal of her beach hut from Whitstable to be displayed in a gallery. This work was titled &quot;The Last Thing I Said To You Is Don&#x27;t Leave Me Here (The Hut)&quot; (1999). She revisited the theme of the bed in 2002, with the mixed media installation, &quot;To Meet My Past&quot; (2002), another installation with a four poster bed with embroidered text such as &quot;Weird Sex&quot; and &quot;To Meet My Past&quot; hanging down alongside the mattress.

She incorporated stones and rocks which had been thrown through her window in a mixed media piece in her 2005 show. The work consists of a monoprint of herself sitting on a chair with the stones lined up below the drawing in a vitrine. &quot;The Leg&quot; (2004) included a plaster cast inside a vitrine, kept by the artist after she broke her leg, exhibited alongside a C-print photograph of the artist wearing the cast.

&quot;May Dodge, My Nan (1993)&quot; is also an installation piece that displays relics of personal items significant to Emin. It was exhibited at the White Cube in Emin&#x27;s first solo show &quot;My Major Retrospective.&quot; &quot;May Dodge, My Nan&quot; encompasses five condiments separately framed and mounted to the wall in the exhibition. It consists of a handwritten page of manuscript, two relics and lastly two photographs. From left to right, it views: pasted onto a small paper doily is a magazine cut-out of three kittens along with the caption too  &#x27;Timmy, Leo and Squashie posing beautifully for the camera&#x27;, as well as a small piece of card stuck onto a piece of blue wool, which dangles making the shape of a handle below. A coloured photo from the past of Emin holding a kitten standing next to her grandmother May Dodge sitting at a table in a kitchen. A black and white photo of both Emin as a little girl and May Dodge standing in a garden in the 1960s. A handmade scented pomander that resembles a doll that Emin&#x27;s grandmother made. The relic made up of sections of soft knitted white cotton fabrics and lace gathered together over its scented stuffing and topped with a plastic doll&#x27;s head. And, lastly, the hand written note by Emin herself in blue ink.

===Sculpture===
In February 2005, Emin&#x27;s first public artwork, &quot;The Roman Standard &quot;, a bronze sculpture, went on display outside the Oratory, adjacent to Liverpool Cathedral. It consists of a small bird perched on a tall bronze pole, and is designed so that the bird seems to disappear when viewed from the front. It was commissioned by the BBC. &quot;Emin&#x27;s work stands outside The Oratory, in Upper Duke Street just outside the Cathedral. The Roman Standard – which features a small bird on top of a four-metre high bronze pole – is a tribute to the city&#x27;s famous symbol the Liver Bird. The sculpture was commissioned by the BBC as part of their contribution to the art05 festival and Liverpool&#x27;s year as European Capital of Culture in 2008. Emin says the sculpture represents strength and femininity.&quot;

In September 2008, she unveiled a neon work that was &quot;installed in the well of the cathedral&quot; Emin herself says of her continuing relationship of making public sculptures in the town, &quot;When Liverpool is Capital of Culture in 2008, I&#x27;ll be making a large work for the Anglican Cathedral, which I&#x27;m really looking forward to.&quot;

Other sculptures have included &quot;Death Mask&quot; (2002) which is a bronze cast of her own head. Emin loaned this work to the National Portrait Gallery in 2005,

At Emin&#x27;s 2007 &quot;Venice Biennale&quot; exhibition, as well as the central exhibition&#x27;s &quot;Tower&quot; sculptures, tall wooden towers consisting of small pieces of timber piled together, a new small bronze-cast sculpture work of a child&#x27;s pink sock was revealed &quot;Sock&quot; (2007) on display on the steps of the British Pavilion. Her exhibition again attracted widespread UK media coverage, both positive and negative.

In September 2007, Emin announced she would be exhibiting new sculpture work in the inaugural Folkestone Triennial, which took place in the Kent town from June until September 2008. In June 2008, Emin discussed the Folkestone sculptures, stating the &quot;high percentage&quot; of teenage pregnancies in the Kent town had inspired this latest work. Emin said her contribution would be different pieces placed around the town, &quot;I&#x27;m going to be making very tiny bronze-cast items of baby clothing. It&#x27;s baby clothes that I have found in the street, like a mitten or a sock.&quot;

Emin&#x27;s 2007 solo show at Gagosian Gallery in Los Angeles&#x27; Beverly Hills included brand new sculpture works described by Emin as, &quot;some very strange little sculptures. They are nearly all of animals, apart from one, which is a pineapple. They rest on mini-plinths made in a really brilliant LA, beach, California, Fifties surfer kind of style. Different woods put together in cute pattern formations. In some places the wood is 18th-century floorboards, some bits of cabin from tall ships or things which could have been found on the seashore – driftwood.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; included Emin in a piece about artists who are &quot;Originals&quot;, with a new photograph with two sculptures, one of a small bird on a thin stand and a large seagull, both sculptures placed on wooden plinths. Gagosian further described the many different sculptures from the show as, &quot;a group of delicate wood and jesmonite sculptures, which expand on the spirals, rollercoasters, and bridges of recent years. Others incorporate cast bronze figures – seagulls, songbirds, and frogs – or objects combining cement and glass, which are placed on tables or bundled bases made from found timbers.&quot;

In late November 2007, it was announced that Emin was one of six artists to have been shortlisted to propose a sculpture for the fourth plinth in London&#x27;s Trafalgar Square. The other shortlisted artists were Jeremy Deller, Antony Gormley, Anish Kapoor, Yinka Shonibare, and Bob and Roberta Smith – the professional name of Patrick Brill.

The contenders were commissioned to produce a scale model of their idea. On 6 January 2008, it was revealed Emin&#x27;s proposal was a lifesize model of a group of four meerkats, the desert mammal. Entitled &quot;Something for the Future&quot; it consisted of a sculpture of four meerkats &quot;as a symbol of unity and safety&quot; as &quot;whenever Britain is in crisis or, as a nation, is experiencing sadness and loss (for example, after Princess Diana&#x27;s funeral), the next programme on television is &#x27;Meerkats United.&#x27;&quot; The successful proposal were announced in 2008 as Gormley, whose project &quot;One &amp; Other&quot; occupied the plinth in summer 2009 and Shonibare, and whose work &quot;Nelson&#x27;s Ship in a Bottle&quot; was unveiled in 2010.

Emin&#x27;s latest project, commissioned by Oslo Municipality Art Programme, is a 7-metre-tall bronze sculpture, &quot;The Mother&quot;, to be unveiled on Museum Island, outside the new Munch Museum, when it opens in 2020. (http://www.themuseumisland.com/). From the jury&#x27;s assessment: &#x27;With its immediate and visceral artistic approach it appears both intimate and majestic, vulnerable and grandiose. The title &quot;The Mother&quot; refers to a mature protector and the sculpture brings to mind the ubiquitous motifs of women and the nude in Munch&#x27;s work. As a non‐idealised depiction of a woman made by a woman it can also be seen as a feminist statement.&#x27;

===Film===

* &quot;Quiet Lives&quot; (1982), featuring Emin and boyfriend Billy Childish—once available with &quot;Cheated&quot; and &quot;Room for Rent&quot; in &quot;A Hangman Triple Bill&quot; (also known as &quot;The Hangman Trilogy&quot;).
* &quot;Why I Never Became a Dancer&quot; (1995) is a single-screen projection with sound, shot on Super 8. Duration: 6 minutes, 40 seconds. It was made in an edition of 10 and an edited transcript has been published by Tate. The film portrays the artist&#x27;s early adolescence in Margate, where she grew up. The film begins with the title written across a wall, and then features a montage of views which are significant to Emin&#x27;s past, including her school, the seaside and shops. The artist&#x27;s voice narrates her story, opening with, &quot;I never liked school / I was always late / In fact I hated it / So at thirteen I left.&quot; The video&#x27;s final scenes show Emin&#x27;s involvement in a local disco-dancing competition, in an attempt to escape to London to take part in the British Disco Dance Championship 1978. The last two minutes of the film consist of Emin dancing exuberantly around an empty studio with the song &quot;You Make Me Feel&quot;, by Sylvester along with a voice overed narration of her saying &#x27;Shane, Eddy, Tony, Doug, Richard  this one&#x27;s for you&#x27;. 

In the film, Emin describes leaving school at age 13 and spending her time on Margate&#x27;s Golden Mile, dreaming and having sex. Sex &quot;was something you could just do and it was for free&quot;. She was &quot;13, 14&quot; and having sex with men of &quot;19, 20, 25, 26&quot;. In the film, the narration states: &quot;It could be good, really something. I remember the first time someone asked me to grab their balls, I remember the power it gave me. But it wasn&#x27;t always like that; sometimes they&#x27;d just cum, and then they&#x27;d leave me there, wherever I was, half naked.&quot; In the final scenes, the artist performs at a local dance competition and people begin to clap. A gang of men, &quot;most of whom [the artist] had sex with at one time or another&quot; began to chant &quot;slag, slag, slag&quot;.

In an interview with Melvyn Bragg, Emin commented on the incident: &quot;I don&#x27;t see why I was such a slag. All I did was sleep with a few people. It&#x27;s not a crime, I didn&#x27;t kill anyone.&quot;
* &quot;How It Feels&quot; (1996)
* &quot;Tracey Emin&#x27;s CV Cunt Vernacular&quot; (1997), an autobiographical work in which Emin narrates her story from childhood in Margate, through her student years, abortions and destruction of her early work.
* &quot;Homage to Edvard Munch and all My Dead Children&quot; (1998)
* &quot;Sometimes the Dress Is Worth More Money Than the Money&quot; (2001). ICA.
* &quot;Top Spot&quot; (2004), a feature-length non-fiction production mixing DV footage and Super 8 film into a montage. The title, &quot;Top Spot&quot;, refers to a youth centre/disco in Margate, as well as being an explicit sexual reference.

Emin has described &quot;Top Spot&quot; as being &quot;about the moment of... understanding that you are walking into an adult world which means sex, which means often violence, which means that you may suddenly have some perspective on your own life that you never had before.&quot; &quot;Top Spot&quot; was given an 18 certificate by the British Board of Film Classification, much to Emin&#x27;s dismay, as she intended the film for a teenage audience.

Emin withdrew the film from general distribution in cinemas after it was rated with an 18 certificate. It was broadcast on BBC3 television in the UK in December 2004, and a DVD of the film was released in 2004.

===Installations===

Emin has created a number of installation art pieces including &quot;Poor Thing (Sarah and Tracey)&quot; (2001) which was made up of two hanging frames, hospital gowns, a water bottle and wire. A similar installation called &quot;Feeling Pregnant III&quot; (2005) made up of fabric hung off wooden and metal coat hangers and stands was a later creation for Emin. Both these installations touch further on Emin&#x27;s relationship with pregnancy and abortion and can be related to Louise Bourgeois&#x27; sculptures such as &quot;Untitled&quot; (1996), a mobile of hanging clothes, and &quot;Untitled&quot; (2007), a series of standing bronze sculptures.

&quot;The Perfect Place to Grow&quot; (2001) was a video installation with a set consisting of a wooden birdhouse, a DVD (shot on Super 8), monitor, trestle, plants, wooden ladder. This installation has been exhibited at the Tate Britain in 2004 in their room dedicated to Emin&#x27;s work and also White Cube in 2001. It was dedicated to her father, creating the bird house as &quot;a tiny home for my dad&quot;, and Emin thought of the works&#x27; title from the idea of &quot;nature and nurture&quot;.

&quot;Knowing My Enemy&quot; (2002) was a large-scale installation created by Emin for her Modern Art Oxford solo show of that year. Consisting of reclaimed wood and steel, Emin created a wooden &quot;look-out&quot; house upon a long, broken, wooden pier. &quot;It&#x27;s Not the Way I Want to Die&quot; (2005) was another large-scale installation, part of Emin&#x27;s 2005 solo show at White Cube. Emin created a large rollercoaster track with reclaimed timber and metal. Displayed in the same show was a smaller installation work called &quot;Self Portrait&quot; (2005) which consisted of a tin bath, bamboo, wire and neon light. Another related installation &quot;Sleeping With You&quot; (2005) consisted of painted reclaimed timber and a thin neon light across a dark wall.

==Miscellanea==
A poster she photocopied and put up around her home when her cat Docket went missing became an object collected by people, but was excluded by Emin from her canon.

In 2000, Emin was commissioned, as part of a scheme throughout London titled &quot;Art in Sacred Spaces&quot;, to collaborate with children on an artwork at Ecclesbourne Primary School in Islington, north London. Pupils made the piece with her in Emin&#x27;s style of sewing cut out letters onto a large piece of material. In 2004, the school enquired if Emin would sign the work so that the school could sell it as an original to raise funds. They planned to auction the piece for £35,000 for an arts unit, as it could not afford to display the large work. Emin and her gallery White Cube refused, saying that it was not a piece of her art, therefore reducing its value, and requested it be returned. But Emin quickly came to an agreement with the school, where she paid £4,000 to create a perspex display box for the patchwork quilt to be showcased. Taking as her theme the title &quot;Tell me something beautiful&quot;, Emin invited eight-year-olds to nominate their ideas of beauty and then to sew the keywords in felt letters on bright fabric squares. The resulting bold patchwork featured words such as &quot;tree&quot;, &quot;sunrise&quot;, &quot;dolphin&quot; and &quot;nan&quot;.

Art critic John Slyce, who has worked on school collaborations with artists, supported Emin and White Cube&#x27;s decision saying, &quot;This is a horrific precedent for the school to try to set. They were lucky to have an artist of that stature spending that amount of time with them ... the artwork should remain in context with the kids. Children&#x27;s primary experience of art should not be as a commodity.&quot;

==Emin and feminism==
Tracey Emin is one of just two women professors to be appointed at London&#x27;s Royal Academy of Arts since the Academy was founded in 1768. In February 2013, she was named as one of the 100 most powerful women in the United Kingdom by Woman&#x27;s Hour on BBC Radio 4.

In response to the question &quot;[D]oes society sufficiently value women artists?&quot;, Emin answered, &quot;No. Of course not. But it&#x27;s changing slowly. We probably just need another 200 years.&quot;

Emin does not overtly appear as a feminist artist, nor does she believe so herself. In an interview with Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt, Emin stated that she is a feminist, but not a feminist artist.

Emin discusses sexism from the viewpoint of the being a female victim. Though Emin&#x27;s subversion of feminine stereotypes, Sophie Lloyd in her article describes her work as, &quot;…[embodying] a change in perception of female sexuality that was in line with third-wave feminism, with women defining beauty and sexuality on their own terms.&quot; By narrating such harrowed and tortured memories, Emin uses vulnerability to tell not only her own struggles, but the struggles that many women may face while finding themselves.

Emin openly discusses her 1998 installation &quot;My Bed&quot; for audiences and interviewers alike. She has been as saying that, &quot;By realizing how separate I was from it, I separated myself from the bed. I wasn&#x27;t there any more.&quot; This notion of a female using the domestic space and then removing herself from the environment, thus confronting stereotypes and taboos in a confessional work was a controversial event. Feminists critics have described Emin as using the historical notion of the bedroom and its importance for female experiences, as a site for crude intervention.

John Molyneux explains in his article &quot;Emin Matters&quot;, that her work revolves around class, sex and art itself. He writes that, &quot;What she does do is present herself as culturally working class…She makes no attempt to engage in &#x27;intellectual art speak&#x27; but sticks to unaffected everyday language,&quot; employing a strategy that doesn&#x27;t place her in authority over her viewers or peers. However, her class background contradicts this tactic of equal understanding. Emin&#x27;s mother until age seven owned a hotel in Margate, but bankruptcy and poverty ensued only when she broke up with Emin&#x27;s father. While she may use street language, swear words, grammatical errors and misspellings to convey a primarily middle-class female experience, Emin now functions as a boss of her own art business and exists within the elite upper class. Her relationship with sex is a major theme and aspect of her work. Feminist writers have reviewed Emin&#x27;s pieces as containing, &quot;…no element of eroticism or titillation…unlike in Botticelli, Renoir or Klimt. Nor is it sexual fantasy or dreams, as we might find in surrealism, or the sex of the brothel featured so heavily in late 19th-century French art. It is real, everyday sex—as experienced by her, of course, but also by millions of other people&quot;.

==Confessional nature of Emin&#x27;s work==
While studying painting at the Royal College of Art Emin became disenchanted with the art of painting, &quot;the idea of being a bourgeois artist, making paintings that just got hung in rich people&#x27;s houses was a really redundant, old fashioned idea that made no sense for the times that we were living in.&quot; She felt there was no point in making art that someone had made decades or centuries before her, &quot;I had to create something totally new or not at all&quot;. When asked by a reporter, when she decided that her life &#x27;as Tracey Emin&#x27; was going to be her art, she replied &#x27;&quot;I realised that I was much better than anything I&#x27;d ever made&quot;.

Roberta Smith of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; says the following about Emin&#x27;s work: &quot;In her art she tells all, all the truths, both awful and wonderful, but mostly awful, about her life. Physical and psychic pain in the form of rejection, incest, rape, abortion and sex with strangers figure in this tale, as do love, passion and joy.&quot;

==Music==
In 1998, Emin duetted with pop singer Boy George on a song called &quot;Burning Up&quot;, released on an 18 track audio CD that accompanied the book &quot;We love you&quot;.

In 2005, Emin compiled a CD of her favourite music called &quot;Music To Cry To&quot;, which was released and sold by the UK household furnishings retailer and brand Habitat.

In 2009, Emin designed the album artwork for a release by singer/songwriter Harper Simon, son of Paul Simon. The front cover depicts an aeroplane, drawn in Emin&#x27;s scratchy monoprint style.

==Health==
In spring 2020, Emin was diagnosed with squamous-cell bladder cancer. She underwent an operation to remove her bladder and several adjacent organs (radical cystectomy and full hysterectomy) that summer 2020, and this left her in remission, but with a stoma.

In December 2023, Emin was travelling from Australia to Thailand on the way back to the United Kingdom, when she experienced complications from an operation on her small intestine, which she said &quot;nearly exploded&quot;. She was subsequently hospitalised in Phuket, Thailand.

==Charity work==

Emin is well known for her charity work; she has raised over a million pounds for children&#x27;s charities such as the NSPCC and for HIV/AIDS charities including the Terrence Higgins Trust. She frequently donates original artworks for charity auctions, and has often adopted the role of auctioneer on the charity night to help increase the highest bid.

In June 2007, on returning from the Venice Biennale, Emin donated a piece of artwork, a handsewn blanket called &quot;Star Trek Voyager&quot; to be auctioned at Elton John&#x27;s annual glamorous White Tie &amp; Tiara Ball to raise money for The Elton John AIDS Foundation. The piece of artwork sold for £800,000. Also in June 2007, Emin&#x27;s neon work &quot;Keep Me Safe&quot; reached the highest price ever (at that time) made for one of her neon works of over £60,000.

Emin has participated in &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Appeal&quot; for many years, where she has offered for auction bespoke artworks and also drawing lessons with the artist. In December 2006, her lot raised £14,000 for a one-on-one drawing lesson, over champagne and cake, with the artist. The following year, in December 2007, her lot raised £25,150 for their appeal offering a special unique drawing of the highest bidder&#x27;s pet embroidered onto a cushion in Emin&#x27;s trademark style.

In January 2008, Emin went to Uganda where she had set up the brand new &quot;Tracey Emin Library&quot; at the rural Forest High School. She explained in her newspaper column, &quot;Schools here don&#x27;t have libraries. In fact, rural areas have very little. Most have no doctor, no clinic, no hospital; schools are few and far between. Education cannot afford to be a priority, but it should be... I think this library may be just the beginning.&quot;

On Valentine&#x27;s Day 2008, Emin donated a red, heart-shaped neon artwork called &quot;I Promise To Love You&quot; (2007) for a charity auction to raise money for The Global Fund, which helps women and children affected by HIV/AIDS in Africa. The auction was called &quot;(Auction) RED&quot;. The work sold for a record price $220,000, which was much higher than the guide estimates of between $60,000 and $80,000.

In 2023, Tracey Emin opened TKE Studios in Margate housing affordable spaces for professional artists to work (TKE Studio Members), as well as the ‘Tracey Emin Artist Residency’ (TEAR) programme. TKE Studio Members include Studio Lenca, Vanessa Raw and Lindsey Mendick. Graduates of TEAR include Bianca Raffaella, Helen Teede and Emmie Nume.

==Political activities==

Emin has been a critic of Britain&#x27;s income tax regime, stating &quot;I&#x27;m simply not willing to pay tax at 50%&quot;, she is &quot;very seriously considering leaving Britain&quot;, and suggests she will live in France. &quot;The French have lower tax rates and they appreciate arts and culture.&quot; Emin has since denied that she intends to leave the country, stating that a journalist she spoke to previously exaggerated her comments, and that London is her home, and is the context in which she belongs.

&quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper reported in August 2010 that Emin is thought of as a supporter of the Conservative Party.

In an interview with &quot;New Statesman&quot;, she revealed that she voted for the Conservatives at the 2010 general election, adding, &quot;We&#x27;ve got the best government at the moment that we&#x27;ve ever had.&quot; She has stated that she is an &#x27;outsider&#x27; in the art world, as a result of voting Conservative. She is a royalist.

In April 2014, Emin, who has a home and studio in Spitalfields, publicly called to save an East London newsagent who faced eviction from Old Spitalfields Market, after 22 years in business. She started a petition to save newsagent Ashok Patel&#x27;s business, which was signed by 1,000 people.

In August 2014, Emin was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

==Awards and honours==
In 2007, London&#x27;s Royal Academy of Arts elected Tracey Emin as a Royal Academician and four years later, the Academy appointed Emin a Professor of Drawing. The University of Kent also awarded Emin an honorary doctorate in 2007.

Emin was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to the arts. In February 2013, she was named one of the 100 most powerful women in the United Kingdom by &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; on BBC Radio 4.

Emin was made an honorary freewoman of Margate in 2022.

Emin was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2024 Birthday Honours for services to art.

In December 2024, Tracy Emin was included on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;100 Women&quot; list.

==Art market==
Emin&#x27;s primary galleries are White Cube in London (since 1993), Lorcan O&#x27;Neill in Rome and Xavier Hufkens in Brussels. In 2017, Emin and Lehmann Maupin ended their working relationship.

Charles Saatchi, who was best known as the most high-profile, high-spending collector of contemporary British art, bought &quot;My Bed&quot; (1998) for £150,000 ($248,000) from Lehmann Maupin&#x27;s &quot;Every Part of Me&#x27;s Bleeding,&quot; the exhibition that won the artist a nomination for the 1999 Turner Prize. In 2013, on the occasion of a Christie&#x27;s London sale that raised a total of 3.1 million pounds ($5 million) in aid of the Saatchi Gallery&#x27;s policy of free entry, &quot;To Meet My Past&quot; (2002) sold for $778,900, establishing a new record for the artist. At another Christie&#x27;s auction in 2014, &quot;My Bed&quot; was sold to White Cube founding director Jay Jopling for 2.5 million pounds, including buyer&#x27;s commission, once again to benefit the Saatchi Gallery&#x27;s foundation. It was estimated that the price of &quot;My Bed&quot; would sell between 800,000 and 1.2 million pounds. Before the sale, Emin said that &quot;what I would really love is that someone did buy it and they donated it to the Tate.&quot;

Her most commonly auctioned sculptural works are phrases in her own handwriting set in neon, usually issued in editions of three, with two artist&#x27;s proofs.
In 2011, British Prime Minister David Cameron added an artwork with &#x27;more passion&#x27; in neon by Emin in his private apartment at 10 Downing Street. In January 2022, Emin requested that the artwork be removed in response to the Westminster lockdown parties controversy.

In April 2014, Emin participated at The Other Art Fair for unrepresented artists.

&quot;I’ve Got It All&quot; (2000) sold at £74,500.&lt;ref name=&quot;collectordaily/christies-london&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Like A Cloud of Blood&quot; (2022), among the first paintings Emin made following her six-month recovery from cancer treatment, was sold by the artist in October 2022 at Christie&#x27;s, to benefit the Tracey Emin Foundation, in support the work of TKE Studios, a subsidised professional artist&#x27;s studios with an additional twenty residencies including a free arts educational program. The deeply personal large-scale canvas sold for £2,322,000 — a new record price for a painting by the artist.

<text>The Katipunan (), officially known as the  (; ) and abbreviated as the KKK, was a revolutionary organization founded in 1892 by a group of Filipino nationalists Deodato Arellano, Andrés Bonifacio, Valentin Diaz, Ladislao Diwa, José Dizon, and Teodoro Plata. Its primary objective was achieving independence from the Spanish Empire through an armed revolution. It was formed as a secret society before its eventual discovery by Spanish authorities in August 1896. This discovery led to the start of the Philippine Revolution.

Historians generally placed the date of its founding in July 1892 shortly after the arrest and deportation of Filipino author and nationalist José Rizal to Dapitan in Mindanao. Rizal was one of the founders of the nascent La Liga Filipina, which aimed for a Filipino representation to the Spanish Parliament. Many members of the Katipunan, including Bonifacio himself, were members of that organization. However, recent discovery of documents of the organization suggest that the Katipunan may have been around by January 1892 but became active by July.

Being originally formed as a secret society, the Katipunan had its members undergo through initiation rites similar to freemasonry. Membership to the organization was initially open only for men; however, women were eventually accepted. The Katipunan had a short-lived publication, &quot;Kalayaan&quot; (), which only saw printing in March 1896. During its existence, revolutionary ideals and works flourished, and Filipino literature was expanded by some of its prominent members.

Existing documents suggest that the Katipunan planned for an armed revolution since its founding, and initially sought for support from Filipino intellectuals. In one such incident, Bonifacio planned a rescue for the deported José Rizal in Dapitan in exchange for his support to the revolution, to which Rizal refused. An attempt to secure firearms from a visiting Japanese warship in May 1896 failed to gain anything. In August that year, Spanish authorities in Manila discovered the organization. Days after, the Katipunan, led by Bonifacio, openly declared war to the Spanish government, starting a three-year long revolution.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;&quot;Katipunan&quot; is a short name for &quot;Kataastaasang, Kagalanggalangang Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan&quot;&quot; (Supreme and Venerable Society of the Children of the Nation). The Tagalog word &quot;katipunan&quot; (literally, &quot;association&quot;, &quot;gathering&quot;, &quot;assemblage&quot;, or &quot;group&quot;) comes from the root word &quot;tipon&quot;, a Tagalog word meaning &quot;gathering&quot; or &quot;to gather&quot;.

==Formation==

The Katipunan was formed in 1892 by Filipino nationalists Deodato Arrellano, Teodoro Plata, Valentin Diaz, Ladislao Diwa, Andres Bonifacio, and Jose Dizon. It was one of the two groups that was formed after the dissolution of the nascent La Liga Filipina, a nationalist organization formed by Filipino writer Jose Rizal and members of the Propaganda Movement in Spain, following Rizal&#x27;s arrest and deportation to Dapitan in Mindanao. Most of the Katipunan&#x27;s early members were also members of the La Liga. However, while the La Liga advocated for a Filipino representation in the Spanish Parliament, Katipunan&#x27;s goals was for the archipelago to achieve independence through an armed revolution. Its founders saw that any move for Filipino autonomy from within Spain would be suppressed by colonial Spanish authorities. The other group, Cuerpo de Compromisarios, argued for a peaceful reformation instead. While fundamentally different in their views, the Katipunan decided to name Rizal as their honorary president. Rizal&#x27;s status was so prominent within the organization that &quot;Rizal&quot; was one of the passwords of the group alongside &quot;Gomburza&quot;, a trio of Filipino priests executed in Bagumbayan in 1872 the wake of the Cavite mutiny.

Modern historical consensus generally place Katipunan&#x27;s formation on the night of July 7, 1892, following Rizal&#x27;s arrest. It was formed in secrecy on a house in Azcarraga Street (now Recto Avenue) in San Nicolas, Manila. However, it may have been formed on paper as early as January of the same year based on recent documents discovered in the 21st century.

The organization was originally formed as a secret society following freemasonic practices such as its initiation rites and its organizational structure. This may come from the fact that many of its early members were freemasons themselves. While not directly involved in the organization, prominent Filipino freemason Marcelo H. del Pilar may have influenced the group. Del Pilar is also said to have approved the Katipunan&#x27;s statutes. Filipino historian Epifanio de los Santos, in the 1920s, noted, &quot;It is very correctly stated that Andrés Bonifacio ordered Teodoro Plata to draw up the statutes of the Katipunan, and that he did this with the aid of Ladislao Diwa and Valentín Diaz. After the statutes had been discussed, Bonifacio, with the concurrence of Deodato Arellano, submitted them to Marcelo H. del Pilar for approval. Upon the latter’s letter approving the statutes, Bonifacio used the same for the purpose of gaining adepts.&quot;

==Organization==

===Administration===
The Katipunan was governed by the Supreme Council (Tagalog: &quot;Kataas-taasang Sanggunian&quot;). The first Supreme Council of the Katipunan was formed around August 1892, a month after the founding of the society. The Supreme Council was headed by an elected president (&quot;pangulo&quot;), followed by the secretary/secretaries (&quot;kalihim&quot;), the treasurer (&quot;tagaingat-yaman&quot;) and the fiscal (&quot;tagausig&quot;). The Supreme Council also had its councilors (&quot;kasangguni&quot;); the number varied through presidencies. To distinguish from presidents of lower &quot;sanggunian&quot; or councils (below), the president of the Supreme Council was called the Supreme President (Tagalog: &quot;Kataas-taasang Pangulo&quot;; Spanish: &quot;Presidente Supremo&quot;).


At the outbreak of the 1896 Revolution, the council was further reorganized into a &#x27;cabinet&#x27; which the Katipunan regarded as a genuine revolutionary government, de facto and de jure.

In each province where there were Katipunan members, a provincial council called &quot;Sangguniang Bayan&quot; was established and in each town was an organized popular council called &quot;Sangguniang Balangay&quot;. Each &quot;bayan&quot; and &quot;balangay&quot; had its own set of elected officials: &quot;pangulo&quot; (president); &quot;kalihim&quot; (secretary); &quot;tagausig&quot; (fiscal);&quot; tagaingat-yaman&quot; (treasurer); &quot;pangalawang pangulo&quot; (vice president); &quot;pangalawang kalihim&quot; (vice secretary); &quot;mga kasangguni&quot; (councilors); &quot;mabalasig&quot; (terrible brother); &quot;taliba&quot; (guard); &quot;maniningil&quot; (collector/auditor); &quot;tagapamahala ng basahan ng bayan&quot; (custodian of the people&#x27;s library); &quot;tagapangasiwa&quot; (administrator); &quot;manunulat&quot; (clerk); &quot;tagatulong sa pagsulat&quot; (assistant clerk); &quot;tagalaan&quot; (warden) and &quot;tagalibot&quot; (patroller). Each &quot;balangay&quot; was given a chance to expand their own spheres of influence through the triangle system in order to elevate their status to &quot;Sangguniang Bayan&quot;. Every &quot;balangay&quot; that did not gain &quot;Sangguniang Bayan&quot; status were dissolved and annexed by greater provincial or popular councils.

The towns/cities which supported the Katipunan cause were given symbolic names, such as &quot;Magdiwang&quot; (to celebrate) for Noveleta; &quot;Magdalo&quot; (to come) for Kawit; &quot;Magwagi&quot; (to win) for Naic; &quot;Magtagumpay&quot; (to succeed) for Maragondon; &quot;Walangtinag&quot; (never-diminished) for Indang and &quot;Haligue&quot; (wall) for Imus–all are in the province of Cavite.

Within the society functioned a secret chamber, called Camara Reina, which was presided over by Bonifacio, Jacinto and Pío Valenzuela. This mysterious chamber passed judgment upon those who had betrayed their oath and those accused of certain offenses penalized by Katipunan laws. Every &quot;katipunero&quot; stood in fearful awe of this chamber. According to José P. Santos, throughout the existence of the secret chamber, about five &quot;katipuneros&quot; were convicted and sentenced to die by it. The death sentence was handed down in the figure of a cup with a serpent coiled around it.

===History of administration===
In 1892, after the &quot;Katipunan&quot; was founded, the members of the Supreme Council consisted of Arellano as president, Bonifacio as comptroller, Diwa as fiscal, Plata as secretary and Díaz as treasurer.

In 1893, the Supreme Council comprised Ramón Basa as president, Bonifacio as fiscal, José Turiano Santiago as secretary, Vicente Molina as treasurer and Restituto Javier, Briccio Pantas, Teodoro Gonzales. Gonzales, Plata and Diwa were councilors. It was during Basa&#x27;s term that the society organized a women&#x27;s auxiliary section. Two of its initial members were Gregoria de Jesús, whom Bonifacio had just married, and Marina Dizon, daughter of José Dizon. It was also in 1893 when Basa and Diwa organized the provincial council of Cavite, which would later be the most successful council of the society.

The Filipino scholar Maximo Kalaw reports that Basa yielded the presidency to Bonifacio in 1894 because of a dispute over the usefulness of the initiation rites and Bonifacio&#x27;s handling of the society&#x27;s funds. Basa contested Bonifacio&#x27;s practice of lending their funds to needy members, complete with promissory notes. Moreover, Basa refused to induct his son into the organization.

It was also in 1894 when Emilio Jacinto, a nephew of Dizon who was studying law at the University of Santo Tomas, joined the Katipunan. He intellectualized the society&#x27;s aims and formulated the principles of the society as embodied in its primer, called &quot;Kartilla&quot;. It was written in Tagalog and all recruits were required to commit it to heart before they were initiated. Jacinto would later be called the &quot;Brains of the Katipunan.&quot;

At the same time, Jacinto also edited &quot;Kalayaan&quot; (Freedom), the society&#x27;s official organ, but only one edition of the paper was issued; a second was prepared but never printed due to the discovery of the society. &quot;Kalayaan&quot; was published through the printing press of the Spanish newspaper &quot;Diario de Manila&quot;. This printing press and its workers would later play an important role in the outbreak of the revolution.

In 1895, José Turiano Santiago, a close personal friend of Bonifacio, was expelled because a coded message of the &quot;Katipunan&quot; fell into the hands of a Spanish priest teaching at the University of Santo Tomas. Since the priest was a friend of Santiago&#x27;s sister, he and his half-brother Restituto Javier were suspected of betrayal, but the two would remain loyal to the &quot;Katipunan&quot; and Santiago would even join the Philippine revolutionary forces in the Philippine–American War. Jacinto replaced Santiago as secretary.

In early 1895, Bonifacio called for a meeting of the society and deposed Basa in an election that installed Bonifacio as president, Jacinto as fiscal, Santiago as secretary, Molina as secretary, Pío Valenzuela and Pantaleon Torres as physicians and Aguedo del Rosario and Doreteo Trinidad as councilors.

On December 31, 1895, another election named Bonifacio as president, Jacinto as fiscal, Santiago as secretary, Molina as secretary, Pío Valenzuela and Pantaleon Torres as physicians and Aguedo del Rosario and Doreteo Trinidad as councilors.

The members of the Supreme Council in 1895 were Bonifacio as president, Valenzuela as fiscal and physician, Jacinto as secretary and Molina as treasurer. Enrico Pacheco, Pantaleon Torres, Balbino Florentino, Francisco Carreón and Hermenegildo Reyes were named councilors.

Eight months later, in August 1896, the fifth and last supreme council was elected to rename offices. Bonifacio was named President, Jacinto as Secretary of State, Plata as Secretary of War, Bricco Pantas as Secretary of Justice, Aguedo del Rosario as Secretary of the Interior and Enrico Pacheco as Secretary of Finance.

===Members===

Over the next four years, the &quot;Katipunan&quot; founders would recruit new members. By the time the society was uncovered, the American writer James Le Roy estimated the strength of the Katipunan at 100,000 to 400,000 members. Historian Teodoro Agoncillo estimated that the membership had increased to around 30,000 by 1896. The Ilocano writer Isabelo de los Reyes estimated membership at 15,000 to 50,000.

Aside from Manila, the &quot;Katipunan&quot; also had sizeable chapters in Batangas, Laguna, Cavite, Rizal, Bulacan, Pampanga, Tarlac and Nueva Ecija. There were also smaller chapters in Ilocos Sur, Ilocos Norte, Pangasinan and the Bicol region. The Katipunan founders spent their free time recruiting members. For example, Diwa, who was a clerk at a judicial court, was assigned to the office of a justice of the peace in Pampanga. He initiated members in that province as well as Bulacan, Tarlac, and Nueva Ecija. Most of the Katipuneros were plebeian although several wealthy patriots joined the society and submitted themselves to the leadership of Bonifacio.

&quot;Katipunero&quot; (plural, &quot;mga Katipunero&quot;) is the demonym of a male member of the Katipunan. &quot;Katipunera&quot; (plural, &quot;mga Katipunera&quot;) refers to female members.

===Triangle system and grades===

It was the original plan of Bonifacio to increase the membership of the Katipunan by means of &quot;sistemang patatsulok&quot; or triangle system. He formed his first triangle with his two comrades, Teodoro Plata and Ladislao Diwa. Each of them re-instituted Katipunan thoughts into another two new converts. The founder of the triangle knew the other two members, but the latter did not know each other. In December 1892 the system was abolished after proving it to be clumsy and complicated. A new system of initiation, modelled after the Masonic rites was then adopted.

When the Katipuneros had expanded to more than a hundred members, Bonifacio divided the members into three grades: the &quot;Katipon&quot; (literally: Associate) which is the lowest rank, the &quot;Kawal&quot; (soldier), and the &quot;Bayani&quot; (Hero or Patriot). In the meeting of the society, &quot;Katipon&quot; wore a black hood with a triangle of white ribbon having the letters &quot;&quot;Z. Ll. B.&quot;, corresponding to the roman &quot;A. N. B.&quot;, meaning &quot;Anak ng̃ Bayan&quot; (Son of the People, see below). &quot;Kawal&quot; wore a green hood with a triangle having white lines and the letters &quot;Z. LL. B.&quot; at the three angles of the triangle, and also wore a green ribbon with a medal with the letter (&quot;ka&quot;) in Baybayin script above a depiction of a crossed sword and flag. The password was &quot;Gom-Bur-Za&quot;, taken from the names of the three martyrs Mariano Gomez, Jose Burgos and Jacinto Zamora. &quot;Bayani&quot; (Hero) wore a red mask and a sash with green borders, symbolizing courage and hope. The front of the mask had white borders that formed a triangle with three &quot;K&quot;s arranged as if occupying the angles of a triangle within a triangle, and with the letters &quot;Z. Ll. B.&quot;&quot; below. Another password was &quot;Rizal&quot;. Countersigns enabled members to recognize one another on the street. A member meeting another member placed the palm of his right hand on his breast and, as he passed the other member, he closed the hands to bring the right index finger and thumb together.

Color designations:
* &quot;Katipon&quot;. First-degree members. Other symbols: Black hood, revolver and/or bolo.
* &quot;Kawal&quot;. Second-degree members. Other symbols: green ribboned-medallion with Malayan &quot;K&quot; inscription.
* &quot;Bayani&quot;. Third degree members. Other symbols: Red hood and sash, with green borders.

&quot;Katipon&quot; could graduate to &quot;Kawal&quot; class by bringing several new members into the society. A &quot;Kawal&quot; could become a &quot;Bayani&quot; upon being elected an officer of the society.

====Membership====
Any person who wished to join the Katipunan was subjected to certain initiation rites, resembling those of Masonic rites, to test his courage, patriotism and loyalty. New recruits underwent the initiation rite three at a time so that no member knew more than two other members of the society. The neophyte was first blindfolded and then led into a dimly lighted room with black curtains where his folded cloth was removed from his eyes. An admonition, in Tagalog, was posted at the entrance to the room:

Inside the candle-lit room, they would be brought to a table adorned with a skull and a bolo. There, they would condemn the abuses of the Spanish government and vow to fight colonial oppression:

During Bonifacio&#x27;s time, all of the Filipino people are referred collectively by the Katipunan as &quot;Tagalogs&quot;, while the Philippines is referred to as the &quot;Katagalugan&quot;.

The next step in the initiation ceremony was the lecture given by the master of ceremonies, called &quot;Mabalasig/Mabalasik&quot; (terrible brother), who informed the neophyte to withdraw if he lacked courage since he would be out of place in the patriotic society. If the neophyte persisted, he was presented to the assembly of the brethren, who subjected him to various ordeals such as blindfolding him and making him shoot a supposedly a revolver at a person, or forcing him to jump over a supposedly hot flame. After the ordeals came to final rite—the &quot;pacto de sangre&quot; or blood compact—in which the neophyte signed the following oath with the blood taken from his arm:

He was then accepted as a full-fledged member, with a symbolic name by which he was known within Katipunan circles. Bonifacio&#x27;s symbolic name was &quot;Maypagasa&quot;; Jacinto was &quot;Pingkian&quot; and Artemio Ricarte was &quot;Vibora&quot;.

====Admission of women to the society====

At first, Katipunan was purely a patriotic society for men. Owing to the growing suspicion of the women regarding nocturnal absences of their husbands, the reduction of their monthly earnings and &quot;long hours of work&quot;, Bonifacio had to bring them into the realms of the KKK. A section for women was established in the society: to become admitted, one must be a wife, a daughter, or a sister of a male &quot;katipunero&quot;. It was estimated that from 20 to 50 women had become members of the society.

The first woman to become a member of the Katipunan was Gregoria de Jesús, wife of Bonifacio. Her codename was &quot;Lakambini&quot; (Princess). Initially, there were 29 women were admitted to the Katipunan: Gregoria de Jesús, Marina Dizon, president of the women&#x27;s section; Josefa and Trinidad Rizal, sisters of Dr. José Rizal; Angelica Lopez and Delfina Herbosa Natividad, close relatives of Dr. Rizal; Carmén de Rodriguez; Marina Hizon; Benita Rodriguez; Semiona de Rémigio; Gregoria Montoya; Agueda Kahabagan, Teresa Magbanua, Trinidad Tecson, rendered as &quot;Mother of Biak-na-Bato&quot;; Nazaria Lagos; Patrocinio Gamboa; Marcela Agoncillo; Melchora Aquino, the &quot;Grand Old Woman of Balintawak&quot;; Marta Saldaña and Macaria Pañgilinan.

The women rendered valuable services to the Katipunan. They guarded the secret papers and documents of the society. Whenever the Katipunan held sessions in a certain house, they usually made merry, singing and dancing with some of the men in the living room so that the civil guard were led that there was nothing but a harmless social party within.

Though women are considered to be members of the Katipunan, information regarding the women&#x27;s section were scarce and sometimes conflicting. Teodoro Agoncillo, for example, disregarded Marina Dizon and concluded that Josefa Rizal was the only president of the said section. Gregorio Zaide, on the other hand, mentioned Dizon&#x27;s presidency in his 1939 publication &quot;History of the Katipunan&quot; but changed his mind when he adopted Dr. Pío Valenzuela&#x27;s notion that women-members did not elect officers, hence there is no room for president.

====Foreign members of the Katipunan====
Attracted by the universal appeal of the Katipunan&#x27;s Kartilya, several members who were not native Filipinos joined the Katipunan or, later, the Philippine Revolutionary Army (PRA) in the spirit of national liberation. Among the foreign-born Katipuneros were General Juan Cailles, a half Indian (From India) and French mestizo; General Jose Ignacio Paua, a full-blooded Chinese; African-American PRA Captain David Fagen who defected from the Americans to join the Filipinos due to his disgust of racism and imperialism; Captain Camillo Richairdi, an Italian who joined the rebel Filipinos; and Vicente Catalan, a Cuban Criollo captain who became the first Admiral of the Philippine Navy. A large number of former Latin-American officers in the Spanish army from Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Chile, Argentina, and Costa Rica were dismissed in the context of the Andres Novales uprising, one of the precursors of the Philippine revolution. These Latin-American-born officers moved to the Philippines to serve in the military and allied with the revolutionaries. There were also several Spanish and American defectors to the Philippine side during the Philippine War of Independence and the Philippine–American War. To add to these were the Japanese militants supporting the Katipunan and the First Republic among which include Lieutenant Saburo Nakamori and Captain Chizuno Iwamoto who served on President Emilio Aguinaldo&#x27;s staff. Nevertheless, there was friction between the Masons from the United States and France against the Masonic associated Katipunan as the first President of the United States, George Washington was once a Mason, but the nascent First Philippine Republic which the Katipunan founded went to war against the same Masonic-led United States in the Philippine-American War, and furthermore, the treaty which sealed the American invasion of the Philippines was concluded in the 1898 Treaty of Paris. The Revolution and the Philippine-American war caused many deaths but eventually, America granted the Philippines Independence after World War 2.

====Notable Katipuneros====
* Andres Bonifacio (1863–1897) – The leading founder and the third Supreme President (Kataas-taasang Pangulo, Presidente Supremo) of the Katipunan, later taking the title Pangulo ng Haring Bayang Katagalugan (President of the Sovereign Tagalog Nation; &quot;Haring Bayan&quot; was also translated as Republic, i.e. Republika ng Katagalugan) upon the start of the revolution.
* Emilio Aguinaldo (1869–1964) – First president of the First Philippine Republic, the Katipunan&#x27;s successor. He was also a war general and one of the officers of the &quot;Magdalo&quot; chapter that led to a lot of notable victories for the Katipunan against Spain. During his presidency, he ordered the arrest and eventual execution of Andrés and Procopio Bonifacio in 1897 after the trial.
* Emilio Jacinto (1875–1899) – called as the &quot;Brains of the Katipunan&quot;. He wrote several papers during the Revolution like the &quot;Kartilya&quot; (Primer).

* Julián Felipe (1861–1944) – composer of Lupang Hinirang, teacher and member of La Liga Filipina, he later served as legal advisor to the Katipunan. His tenacious ability in argumentative reasoning earned him the nickname &quot;demente viejo&quot; among the colonial Principalía. In Manila, Julian ran a private law school which many of his personal socio-political ideals succeeded to his students. Notable Katipuneros under his tutelage was Gregorio Aglipay and Miguel Malvar.
==Literature of the society==

===Written works===
During the Katipunan&#x27;s existence, literature flourished through prominent writers of the Katipunan: Andrés Bonifacio, Emilio Jacinto and Dr. Pío Valenzuela. Each of the three&#x27;s works stirred patriotism and are aimed to spread the revolutionary thoughts and ideals of the society.
* Bonifacio works. Probably one of the best works done inside the Katipunan was written by Andrés Bonifacio, &quot;Pag-ibig sa Tinubuang Lupa&quot; (Love for the Homeland). It is a poem of sincere patriotic sentiment. &quot;Pag-ibig&quot; was published in the January 1896 issue of &quot;Kalayaan&quot; by Bonifacio under his pen name &quot;Agapito Bagumbayan&quot;. According to Manuel Artigas y Cuerva, the name &quot;Agapito Bagumbayan&quot; was a corruption of &quot;agap-ito, bagum-bayan&quot;, which, if translated from Tagalog to English word by word, means &quot;the new nation is here and ready&quot;. There is no known original source of &quot;Pag-ibig&quot;, especially that there is no surviving &quot;Kalayaan&quot; issue. The two available texts accessible reprinted through books is the one published by Jose P. Santos in 1935. The other one, with familiar discrepancies to Santos&#x27; print, was archived in the military annals of Madrid.
: After Rizal&#x27;s execution at Bagumbayan on December 30, 1896, Bonifacio wrote the first Tagalog translation of the former&#x27;s &quot;Mi último adiós&quot; (Final Farewell), in which he gave the name &quot;Pahimakas&quot; (Farewell). He also wrote the prose &quot;Katungkulang Gagawin ng mga Z. Ll. B.&quot; (Duties of the Sons of the People), that was never published because he believed that Jacinto&#x27;s &quot;Kartilya&quot; was superior than his. Bonifacio also wrote &quot;Ang Dapat Mabatid ng Mga Tagalog&quot; (What the Tagalogs Should Know), which is a politic-historical essay.
* Jacinto works. Emilio Jacinto is considered as the &quot;Brains of the Katipunan&quot;, later &quot;of the Revolution&quot;. His poetical masterpiece, written in Laguna on October 8, 1897, was &quot;A la Patría&quot; (To My Fatherland), with an inspiring melody paralleled from Rizal&#x27;s &quot;Mi último adiós&quot;. He also wrote a touching ode entitled &quot;A mí Madre&quot; (To My Mother). His masterpiece in prose, the &quot;Kartilya&quot; (Primer; see below), became the Bible of the Katipunan. His other prose writing was &quot;Liwanag at Dilim&quot; (Light and Darkness), a series of articles on human rights, liberty, equality, labor, government, and love of country. His pen name was &quot;Dimas-Ilaw&quot;.
* Valenzuela works. Dr. Pío Valenzuela was a medical doctor by profession. In 1896, during the first publication of &quot;Kalayaan&quot;, Valenzuela assisted Bonifacio and Jacinto in editing the newspaper. He also wrote &quot;Catuiran?&quot; (Is it Fair?), which described the cruelties of the Spanish priest and civil guards of San Francisco del Monte (now in Quezon City) on a helpless village lieutenant. He also collaborated with Bonifacio in writing the article &quot;Sa Mga Kababayan&quot; (To my Countrymen), an essay addressing the people of the Philippines. His pen name was &quot;Madlang-Away&quot;.
:During the infamous Cry of Balintawak, Valenzuela held the position of physician-general of the Katipunan.

===&quot;Kalayaan&quot;===
&quot;Kalayaan&quot; (Liberty/Freedom) was the official organ and newspaper of the Katipunan. It was first published March 1896 (even though its masthead was dated January 1896.) The first &quot;Kalayaan&quot; issue has never been followed.

In 1895, the Katipunan bought an old hand-press with the money generously donated by two Visayan co-patriots Francisco del Castillo and Candido Iban–who returned to the country after working as shell and pearl divers in Australia and had some money from a lottery win. They bought the press and a small quantity of types from Antonio Salazar&#x27;s &quot;Bazar del Cisne&quot; on Calle Carriedo, and Del Castillo transported it to the house of Andrés Bonifacio in Santa Cruz, Manila. On January 1, 1896, Valenzuela accepted the position as the Katipunan &quot;fiscal&quot; in exchange for Bonifacio&#x27;s consent to send the printing press to his house in Calle de Lavezares, San Nicolas, Manila, &quot;so that he could assist and edit a monthly publication which would be the Katipunan&#x27;s main organ&quot;. Bonifacio agreed, and on mid-January, the press was delivered in San Nicolas.

The name &quot;Kalayaan&quot; was suggested by Dr. Pío Valenzuela, which was agreed both by Bonifacio and Emilio Jacinto. Even though Valenzuela was chosen to become the editor of the organ, they all decided to use the name of Marcelo H. del Pilar as its editor. To fool the Spanish authorities, the &quot;Kalayaan&quot; was also decided to carry a false masthead stating that it was being printed in Yokohama, Japan.

That very same month, January 1896, the publication of &quot;Kalayaan&quot; began. Valenzuela expected to complete it by the end of the month and so it was dated as such. The existence of the press was kept in utmost secrecy. Under the supervision of Valenzuela, two printers, Faustino Duque, a student from Colegio de San Juan de Letran, and Ulpiano Fernández, a part-time printer at &quot;El Comercio&quot;, printed the revolutionary literature of the society and &quot;Kalayaan&quot;.

When Valenzuela was appointed the physician-general of the Katipunan, he passed on his editorial duties to Jacinto. Jacinto edited the articles after his pre-law classes in University of Santo Tomas. Since the press was in the old orthography and not in the new &quot;Germanized&quot; alphabet, as called by the Spaniards, there were no Tagalog letters such as &quot;k&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;h&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. To solve this problem, Jacinto obliged his mother, Josefa Dizon, to buy typefaces that resembled such letters. The typefaces used in its printing were purchased from publisher Isabelo de los Reyes, but many were taken surreptitiously from the presses of the &quot;Diario de Manila&quot; by Filipino employees who were also members of the Katipunan.

According to Valenzuela, the printing process was so laborious that setting eight pages required two months to complete. For weeks, Jacinto, Duque and Fernández (and sometimes Valenzuela) took turns in preparing the pages of the &quot;Kalayaan&quot;, which was approximately nine by twelve inches in size.

In March 1896, the first copies of the January 1896 issue were secretly circulated with about 2,000 copies, according to Valenzuela. According to Epifanio de los Santos, only 1,000 copies were printed: 700 were distributed by Bonifacio, 300 by Aguinaldo, and some 100 by Valenzuela himself.

The first issue contained a supposed editorial done by del Pilar, which, in fact, was done by Jacinto himself. It also included Bonifacio&#x27;s &quot;Pag-ibig sa Tinubuang Lupa&quot;, Valenzuela&#x27;s &quot;Catuiran?&quot; and several works that exposed Spanish abuses and promoted patriotism. Copies spread to nearby Manila provinces, including Cavite, Morong (now Rizal), Kalookan, and Malabon. Surprised by this initial success, Jacinto decided to print a second issue that would contain nothing but his works.

In August 1896, the second issue was prepared. It was during this time that Spanish authorities began to grow wary of anti-government activities and, suspecting the existence of a subversive periodical in circulation (see below), raided the place where &quot;Kalayaan&quot; was being printed, at No. 6 Clavel Street, San Nicolas, Manila. Fortunately, the printers Duque and Fernández were warned in time, destroyed the incriminating molds and escaped. Therefore, Spanish authorities never found any evidence of the &quot;Kalayaan&quot;.

===&quot;Kartilya ng Katipunan&quot;===

The teachings of the Katipunan were embodied in a document entitled &quot;Kartilya ng Katipunan&quot;, a pamphlet printed in Tagalog language. Copies of which were distributed among the members of the society.

&quot;Kartilya&quot; was written by Emilio Jacinto, and later revised by Emilio Aguinaldo. The revised version consists of thirteen teachings (though some sources, such as the one provided by Philippine Centennial Commission, list only twelve). The term &quot;kartilya&quot; was derived from Spanish &quot;cartilla&quot;, which was a primer for grade school students before going to school at that time.

===Language and alphabet===
According to Filipino writer and historian Hermenegildo Cruz, the official language of the Katipunan is Tagalog, and uses an alphabet nearly similar to Spanish alphabet but has a different meaning and the way it was read was changed. Diacritics were added, to emphasize the existence of ng and mga on Tagalog orthography. The following is an excerpt from Cruz&#x27; &quot;Kartilyang Makabayan: Mga Tanong at Sagot Ukol Kay Andrés Bonifacio at sa KKK&quot; (, Manila, 1922):

Presented below is the Katipunan alphabet, when compared to the Spanish alphabet.
==Preparation for the revolution==

===Attempt to seek Rizal&#x27;s support===

The night when Governor-General Eulogio Despujol exiled Dr. José Rizal to Dapitan, Katipunan was discovered.

In a secret meeting of the Katipunan by a small creek named Bitukang Manok (later known as Parian Creek, now nearly extinct) near Pasig on May 4, 1896, Bonifacio and his councilors decided to seek the advice of Rizal regarding a decision to revolt. Bonifacio delegated Dr. Pío Valenzuela as the Katipunan&#x27;s emissary to Dapitan. This was done in order to inform Rizal of Katipunan&#x27;s plan to launch a revolution and, if possible, a war against Spain. By the end of May 1896, Valenzuela had visited and interviewed Rizal in Dapitan. As cover, Valenzuela was accompanied by a blind man named Raymundo Máta, since Rizal is an ophthalmologist.

Valenzuela arrived in Dapitan on June 21, 1896, where Rizal welcomed him. After supper, Valenzuela told him his real purpose and the necessity of securing Rizal&#x27;s support. According to Valenzuela, Rizal only answered, &quot;Huwag, huwag! Iya&#x27;y makasasama sa bayang Pilipino!&quot; (No, no! That will harm the Filipino nation!)

Rizal objected to Bonifacio&#x27;s audacious plan to plunge the country into a bloody revolution. He believed it was premature for two reasons:

# the people are not ready for a massive revolution; and
# arms and funds must first be collected before raising the cry of revolution.

Because of this notion, Valenzuela made another proposal to Rizal: to rescue him. Rizal disapproved of this plan, because he had given his word of honor to the Spanish authorities, and he did not want to break it. Instead, Rizal advised Valenzuela to persuade wealthy Filipinos, so that they can solicit funds, where he recommended an elite army officer named Antonio Luna to be Katipunan&#x27;s war general, should a revolution break out. According to Valenzuela&#x27;s statement to the Spanish authorities, they almost quarreled over the matter and Valenzuela left the following day instead of staying for a month as originally planned.

When Valenzuela returned to Manila and informed the Katipunan of his failure to secure Rizal&#x27;s sanction. Bonifacio, furious, warned Valenzuela not to tell anyone of Rizal&#x27;s refusal to support the impending uprising. However, Valenzuela had already spread the word, so that much fund proposals to the society were canceled. Despite Rizal&#x27;s rejection, the Katipunan was already trying to address its arms supply problem and had taken steps to smuggle in weapons from abroad.

At his trial, Rizal denied that he knew Valenzuela, saying only that he met him first at Dapitan and that he considered him a good friend because of what Valenzuela showed to him and his appreciation of medical tools Valenzuela gave to him. He also said that this was the last time they met.

===Attempt to solicit Japan&#x27;s aid===
Despite Rizal&#x27;s rejection of an armed revolution, Bonifacio continued to plan for an armed conflict with Spain. The Katipunan cast its eyes on Japan, which loomed then as the probable champion of Asian liberties against Western oppression at the time. In May 1896, after Valenzuela&#x27;s visit to Rizal, a delegation of Katipunan members, headed by Jacinto and Bonifacio, conferred with a visiting Japanese naval officer and captain of a Japanese ship, named &quot;Kongo&quot;, and the Japanese consul at a Japanese bazaar in Manila. The interpreter, a friend of Valenzuela, was José Moritaro Tagawa who was married to a Filipino woman of Bocaue, Bulacan.

After the usual exchange of courtesies, Jacinto submitted the Katipunan memorial for the Emperor of Japan in which the Filipinos prayed for Japanese aid in their projected revolution, &quot;so that the light of liberty that illuminates Japan may also shed its rays over the Philippines.&quot;

It was with good reason that the Katipunan solicited Japan&#x27;s aid and alliance. Japan had been friendly to the Filipinos since the Spanish colonial era. Many Filipinos who had fled from Spanish persecution had been welcomed there and given full protection of Japanese laws. Bonifacio tried to purchase arms and ammunition from Japan, but failed due to lack of funds and the uncovering of the Katipunan, José Dizon was part of the committee that the Katipunan formed to secure arms from Japan with the connivance of the Japanese ship captain. Three months later, however, the Katipunan was uncovered and Dizon was among the hundreds who were arrested for rebellion.

==Discovery==
As the Katipunan was busy preparing for the revolt, various denunciations regarding its existence reached the Spanish authorities. On July 5, 1896, Manuél Sityar, a Spanish lieutenant of the Guardia Civil stationed at Pasig, reported to Governor-General Ramón Blanco the mysterious activities of certain natives who had been gathering arms and recruiting men for some unknown purposes. On August 13, 1896, Fr. Agustín Fernández, an Augustinian curate of San Pedro, Makati, wrote to Don Manuél Luengo, the civil governor (mayor) of Manila, denouncing anti-Spanish meetings in his parish.

The Katipunan was finally discovered by the Spanish authorities six days after Fr. Fernández&#x27;s letter to Luengo. In early August 1896, Teodoro Patiño and Apolonio de la Cruz, both working for the &quot;Diario de Manila&quot; printing press (leading newspaper during those times) had undergone misunderstanding regarding wages. Press foreman de la Cruz and typesetter Patiño fought over salary increase of two pesos. De la Cruz tried to blame Patiño for the loss of the printing supplies that were used for the printing of &quot;Kalayaan&quot;. In retaliation, Patiño revealed the secrets of the society to his sister, Honoria Patiño, an inmate nun at the Mandaluyong Orphanage. That afternoon, on August 19, 1896, Honoria grew shocked and very upset of the revelation. The mother portress of the Orphanage, &quot;Sor&quot; (Sister) Teresa de Jesus saw Honoria crying so she approached her. Honoria told everything she heard from her brother. At around 6:15 pm that day, &quot;Sor&quot; Teresa called Patiño and advised him to tell everything he knew about the Katipunan through confession to Fr. Mariano Gíl.

Controlled by his fear of hell, Patiño went to Fr. Gíl, an Augustinian parish curate of the Tondo convent. Though he is willed to tell anything about the Katipunan, Patiño confessed that a lithographic stone was hidden in the press room of the &quot;Diario de Manila&quot;, which was used by the society for printing receipts. He also said that aside from the lithographic stone, there were also documents of membership (that uses member&#x27;s blood for signing) hidden, together with a picture of Dr. José Rizal and several daggers that was made for the &quot;Katipunero&quot;—employees of the newspaper.

Alarmed by the stunning truth of the existence of a secret society, Fr. Gíl, accompanied by local Spanish authorities, searched the printing office of &quot;Diario de Manila&quot; and found the incriminating evidence. They also found de la Cruz in possession of a dagger used in Katipunan initiation rites and some list of newly accepted members. After the arrest, Fr. Gíl rushed to Governor-General Blanco to denounce the revolutionary plot of the Katipunan. The Spanish unleashed a crackdown and arrested dozens of people, where many innocent citizens were forced to go to Fort Santiago.

Patiño&#x27;s alleged betrayal has become the standard version of how the revolution broke out in 1896. In the 1920s, however, the Philippine National Library commissioned a group of former &quot;Katipuneros&quot; to confirm the truth of the story. José Turiano Santiago, Bonifacio&#x27;s close friend who was expelled in 1895, denied the story. He claimed that Bonifacio himself ordered Patiño to divulge the society&#x27;s existence to hasten the Philippine revolution and preempt any objection from members.

Historian Teodoro Agoncillo gives a differing version of events, writing that Patiño revealed the secrets of the society to his sister, Honoria, following on a misunderstanding with de la Cruz, another society member who worked with him in the Spanish-owned &quot;Diario de Manila&quot; periodical. Honoria, an orphanage inmate, was upset at the news and informed Sor Teresa, the orphanage &quot;madre portera&quot;, who suggested that Patiño tell all to Fr. Gíl. On August 19, Patiño told Fr. Gíl what he knew of the secret society. Fr. Gíl and the owner of the &quot;Diario de Manila&quot; searched the printing shop, discovering the lithographic stone used to print Katipunan receipts. After this discovery, the locker of Policarpio Turla, whose signature appeared on the receipts, was forced open and found to contain a dagger, the rules of the society, and other pertinent documents. These were turned over to the Guardia Civíl, leading to the arrest and conviction on charges of illegal association and treason of some 500 prominent men.

In another version, the existence of the Katipunan became known to the authorities through Patiño, who revealed it to the general manager, La Font. Patiño was engaged in a bitter dispute over pay with de la Cruz and exposed the Katipunan to La Font, in retaliation. La Font led a Spanish police lieutenant to the shop and the desk of de la Cruz, where they &quot;found Katipunan paraphernalia such as a rubber stamp, a little book, ledgers, membership oaths signed in blood, and a membership roster of the Maghiganti chapter of the Katipunan.&quot;

==Revolution==

When the &quot;Katipunan&quot; leaders learned of the arrests, Bonifacio called an assembly of all provincial councils to decide the start of the armed uprising. The meeting was held at the house of Apolonio Samson at a place called Kangkong in Balintawak. About 1,000 &quot;Katipuneros&quot; attended the meeting but they were not able to settle the issue.

They met again at another place in Balintawak the following day. Historians are still debating whether this event took place at the yard of Melchora Aquino or at the house of her son Juan Ramos. The meeting took place either on August 23 or August 24. It was at this second meeting where the Katipuneros in attendance decided to start the armed uprising and they tore their &quot;cedulas&quot; (residence certificates and identity papers) as a sign of their commitment to the revolution. The &quot;Katipuneros&quot; also agreed to attack Manila on August 29.

But Spanish civil guards discovered the meeting and the first battle occurred with the Battle of Pasong Tamo. While the &quot;Katipunan&quot; initially had the upper hand, the Spanish civil guards turned the fight around. Bonifacio and his men retreated toward Marikina via Balara (now in Quezon City). They then proceeded to San Mateo (in the province now called Rizal) and took the town. The Spanish, however, regained it three days later. After regrouping, the &quot;Katipuneros&quot; decided not to attack Manila directly but agreed to take the Spanish powder magazine and garrison at San Juan.

On August 30, the &quot;Katipunan&quot; attacked the 14 Spanish soldiers (twelve Philippine soldiers and two Spanish officers) defending the powder magazine in the Battle of San Juan del Monte or Battle of Pinaglabanan, who were before noon reinforced by the 73rd &quot;Jolo&quot; Regiment, composed of Filipino soldiers under Spanish officers, under the command of General Bernardo Echaluce y Jauregui. About 153 Katipuneros were killed in the battle, but the &quot;Katipunan&quot; had to withdraw upon the arrival of Spanish reinforcements. More than 200 were taken prisoners. At about the same time, Katipuneros in other suburban Manila areas, like Caloocan, San Pedro de Tunasan (now Makati), Pateros and Taguig, rose up in arms. In the afternoon of the same day, the Spanish Gov. Gen. Camilo de Polavieja declared martial law in Manila and the provinces of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Bulacan, Pampanga, Tarlac and Nueva Ecija. The Philippine Revolution had begun.

In Bulacan, the Bulacan Revolutionary Movement was attacked by the strongest artillery forces ever converged in the capital town of Bulacan. This subsequently led to the Battle of San Rafael, where Gen. Anacleto Enriquez and his men were surrounded and attacked in the Church of San Rafael.

===Battle of Kakarong de Sili===


Pandi, Bulacan played a vital and historical role in the fight for Philippine independence. Pandi is known for the Réal de Kakarong de Sili Shrine—&quot;Inang Filipina Shrine&quot;, the site of the bloodiest battle in Bulacan, where more than 3,000 Katipunero revolutionaries died. Likewise, it is on this site where the &quot;Republic of Réal de Kakarong de Sili&quot; of 1896, one of the first Philippine revolutionary republics, was established.

It was in Kakarong de Sili—which about 6,000 Katipuneros from various towns of Bulacan headed by Brigadier General Eusebio Roque, better known as &quot;Maestrong Sebio&quot; or &quot;Dimabungo&quot; (see list of Filipino generals in the Philippine Revolution and the Philippine–American War)—that the &quot;Kakarong Republic&quot; was organized shortly after the Cry of Pugad Lawin, referred to as the &quot;Cry of Balintawak&quot;.

===Kakarong Republic===
History and researchers, as well as records of the National Historical Commission, tells that the &quot;Kakarong Republic&quot; was the first and truly organized revolutionary government established in the country to overthrow the Spaniards antedating event the famous Malolos Republic and the Biak-na-Bato Republic. In recognition thereof, these three &quot;republics&quot; established in Bulacan have been incorporated in the seal of the province of Bulacan.

According to available records including the biography of General Gregorio del Pilar entitled &quot;Life and Death of a Boy General&quot; written by Teodoro Kalaw, former director of the National Library of the Philippines, a fort was constructed at &quot;Kakarong de Sili&quot; that was like a miniature city. It had streets, an independent police force, a musical band, a factory of falconets, bolos and repair shops for rifles and cartridges. The &#x27;Kakarong Republic&#x27; had a complete set of officials with Canuto Villanueva as Supreme Chief and &#x27;Maestrong Sebio&#x27;—Eusebio Roque as Brigadaier General of the Army. The fort was attacked and totally destroyed on January 1, 1897, by a large Spanish force headed by the Commandant Olaguer-Feliu. Del Pilar was only a lieutenant at the time and the Battle of Kakarong de Sili was his &quot;baptism of fire.&quot; This was where he was first wounded and escaped to nearby barangay &#x27;Manatal.&#x27;

The Kakarong Lodge No. 168 of the &#x27;Legionarios del Trabajo&#x27;, named in memory of the 1,200 Katipuneros who perished in the battle, erected a monument named the &quot;Inang Filipina&quot; Shrine – (Mother Philippines Shrine) in 1924 in the barrio of Kakarong of Pandi, Bulacan.

The actual site of the Battle of Kakarong de Sili is now a part of the barangay of Réal de Kakarong. No less than one of the greatest generals in the Philippines&#x27; history, General Emilio Aguinaldo who became the first Philippine president visited this sacred ground in the late 1950s.

==Spanish response==

Even before the discovery of the &quot;Katipunan&quot;, Rizal applied for a position as a doctor in the Spanish army in Cuba in a bid to persuade the Spanish authorities of his loyalty to Spain. His application was accepted and he arrived in Manila to board a ship for Spain in August 1896, shortly before the secret society was exposed. But while Rizal was en route to Spain, the &quot;Katipunan&quot; was unmasked and a telegram overtook the steamer at Port Said, recalling him to the Philippines to face charges that he was the mastermind of the uprising. He was later executed by musketry on December 30, 1896, at the field of Bagumbayan (now known as Luneta).

While Rizal was being tried by a military court for treason, the prisoners taken in the Battle of Pinaglabanan—Sancho Valenzuela, Ramón Peralta, Modesto Sarmiento, and Eugenio Silvestre—were executed on September 6, 1896, at Bagumbayan.

Six days later, they also executed the Thirteen Martyrs of Cavite at Fort San Felipe Fort in Cavite.

The Spanish colonial authorities also pressed the prosecution of those who were arrested after the raid on the &quot;Diario de Manila&quot; printing press, where they found evidence incriminating not only common folk but also wealthy Filipino society leaders.

The Bicol Martyrs were executed by firing squad on January 4, 1897, at Bagumbayan. They were Manuel Abella, Domingo Abella, priests Inocencio Herrera, Gabriel Prieto and Severino Díaz, Camio Jacob, Tomas Prieto, Florencio Lerma, Macario Valentin, Cornelio Mercado and Mariano Melgarejo.

They arrested and seized the properties of prominent businessmen Francisco Roxas, Telesforo Chuidián and Jacinto Limjáp. While there may be circumstantial evidence pointing to Chuidián and Limjáp as financiers of the revolution, the record showed no evidence against Roxas except that he was involved in funding the Propaganda Movement. Even Mariano Ponce, another leader of the Propaganda Movement, said the arrest of Roxas was a &quot;fatal mistake&quot;. Nonetheless, Roxas was found guilty of treason and shot on January 11, 1897, at Bagumbayan.

Roxas was executed with Numeriano Adriáno, José Dizon, Domíngo Franco, Moisés Salvadór, Luis Enciso Villaréal, Braulio Rivera, Antonio Salazar, Ramón P. Padilla, Faustino Villaruél and Faustino Mañalac. Also executed with the group were Lt. Benedicto Nijaga and Corporal Gerónimo Cristóbal, both of the Spanish army.

On February 6, 1897, Apolonio de la Cruz, Román Bása, Teodoro Pláta, Vicente Molina, Hermenegildo de los Reyes, José Trinidad, Pedro Nicodemus, Feliciano del Rosario, Gervasio Samson and Doroteo Domínguez were also executed at Bagumbayan.

But the executions, particularly Rizal&#x27;s, only added fuel to the rebellion, with the &quot;Katipuneros&quot; shouting battle cries: &quot;&quot;Mabuhay ang Katagalugan&quot;!&quot; (&quot;Long Live the Tagalog Nation!&quot; – &quot;Katagalugan&quot; (Tagalog Nation) being the Katipunan term for the Philippines) and &quot;&quot;Mabuhay si Dr. José Rizal&quot;!&quot; (&quot;Long Live Dr. José Rizal!&quot;). To the Katipuneros, Rizal was the honorary president of the Katipunan.

==Schism, transfer of authority and dissolution==
In the course of the revolution against Spain, a split developed between the &quot;Magdiwang&quot; faction (led by Gen. Mariano Álvarez) and the &quot;Magdalo&quot; faction (led by Gen. Baldomero Aguinaldo, cousin of General Emilio Aguinaldo), both situated in Cavite.

At a convention in Tejeros, Cavite, the revolutionaries assembled to form a revolutionary government. There, on March 22, 1897, it was decided to dissolve the Katipunan and establish a republic. Bonifacio lost his bid for the presidency of the revolutionary government to Emilio Aguinaldo, who was in Pasong Santol, fighting the Spanish forces and instead was elected Secretary of the Interior. When members of the &quot;Magdalo&quot; faction tried to discredit him as uneducated and unfit for the position, Bonifacio declared the results of the convention as null and void, speaking as the &quot;Supremo&quot; of the Katipunan. Despite this, Aguinaldo took his oath of office as president the next day in Santa Cruz de Malabon (present-day Tanza) in Cavite, as did the rest of the officers, except for Bonifacio. Bonifacio and a few others issued the Acta de Tejeros, proclaiming the events at the Tejeros Convention to have been &quot;disorderly and tarnished by chicanery.&quot;, followed by the Naic Military Agreement characterizing actions at Tejeros to have been treasonous. This led to Andrés Bonifacio and his brother Procopio being arrested due to alleged incidents in Indang and, upon the orders of the Council of War and approved by Gen. Aguinaldo, they were both executed on May 10, 1897, at Mount Buntis in Maragondon, Cavite. He and his brother were buried in an unmarked grave.

The Katipunan revolution led to the eventual establishment of the First Philippine Republic. The Philippine Republic, more commonly known as the First Philippine Republic or the Malolos Republic was a short-lived nascent revolutionary government in the Philippines. It was formally established with the proclamation of the Malolos Constitution on January 23, 1899, in Malolos, Bulacan, and endured until the capture of Emilio Aguinaldo by the American forces on March 23, 1901, in Palanan, Isabela, which effectively dissolved the First Republic. The United States eventually destroyed the First Philippine Republic in the Philippine–American War. Afterwards, the Americans exterminated any remaining vestige of the Katipunan.

<text>Olaf Guthfrithson or Anlaf Guthfrithson ( ; ; ; died 941) was a Hiberno-Scandinavian (Irish-Viking) leader who ruled Dublin and Viking Northumbria in the 10th century. He was the son of Gofraid ua Ímair and great-grandson of Ímar, making him one of the Uí Ímair. Olaf succeeded his father as King of Dublin in 934 and succeeded in establishing dominance over the Vikings of Limerick when he captured their king, Amlaíb Cenncairech, in 937. That same year he allied with Constantine II of Scotland in an attempt to reclaim the Kingdom of Northumbria which his father had ruled briefly in 927. The forces of Olaf and Constantine were defeated by the English led by Æthelstan at the Battle of Brunanburh in 937.

Olaf returned to Ireland in 938 but after Æthelstan&#x27;s death the following year Olaf left for York where he was quickly able to establish himself as king, with his brother Blácaire mac Gofraid being left to rule in Dublin. Olaf and Æthelstan&#x27;s successor Edmund met in 939 at Leicester where they came to an agreement regarding the division of England between them. This agreement proved short-lived, however, and within a few years Vikings had occupied the Five Boroughs of Derby, Leicester, Lincoln, Nottingham and Stamford. Olaf died in 941 and was succeeded in Northumbria by his cousin Olaf Cuaran. At the time of his death, the Irish annals title him &quot;king of Danes&quot; and &quot;king of the Fair Foreigners and the Dark Foreigners&quot;.

==Biography==
Olaf first conclusively appears in contemporary records in 933 when the annals describe him plundering Armagh on 10 November. He is then recorded as allying with Matudán mac Áeda, overking of Ulaid and raiding as far as Sliabh Beagh, where they were met by an army led by Muirchertach mac Néill of Ailech, and lost 240 men in the ensuing battle along with much of their plunder. An earlier reference to a &quot;son of Gofraid&quot; who plundered the monastery at Kildare in 928 might refer to Olaf but no name is given. Olaf&#x27;s father Gofraid ua Ímair, King of Dublin, died in 934 and Olaf succeeded him as king. The following year Olaf carried out a raid at Lagore crannog in County Meath, and then looted the burial chamber at Knowth the following week.

Olaf is described as &quot;Lord of the Foreigners&quot; by the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; in 937, at which time he went to Lough Ree and captured Amlaíb Cenncairech, King of Limerick, and his troops after breaking their boats. This conflict can be ascribed to rivalry between the competing Viking settlements of Dublin and Limerick, with this event marking victory for Dublin. This period is considered to be the high-point of Viking influence in Ireland. Having secured his position in Ireland, Olaf turned his attention to England and Northumbria, which had once been ruled by Olaf&#x27;s father and had been conquered in 927 by Æthelstan of England. Olaf allied with Constantine II of Scotland, whose kingdom had been invaded by Æthelstan in 934, and in 937, the same year as the victory over Limerick, Olaf and the Vikings of Dublin left for England.

The allied forces of Olaf and Constantine met the forces of Æthelstan at the Battle of Brunanburh, at a site which is the subject of much debate, although current scholarly consensus identifies the site as Bromborough in Cheshire. Olaf and Constantine commanded the Viking troops while Æthelstan alongside his brother Edmund led the English troops into the battle. Contemporary accounts indicate both sides suffered many casualties but the result was a decisive English victory. Olaf and Constantine survived the battle and returned to Ireland and Scotland respectively, but one of Constantine&#x27;s sons died. The battle is well-attested, with references in Irish chronicles, and a poetic telling of the battle in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. The numerous references to it in various chronicles throughout the British Isles testify to its perceived importance at the time.

The annals record Olaf&#x27;s return to Ireland in 938 as well as a raid he carried out that year on Kilcullen in modern-day County Kildare, where he is said to have taken a thousand prisoners. Æthelstan died in October 939 and very soon afterwards Olaf left for York where he was able to quickly establish himself as king of Northumbria. Olaf was joined in England by his cousin Olaf Cuaran, and Olaf&#x27;s brother Blácaire was left to rule in Dublin while he was away. Symeon of Durham&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum&quot; records that Olaf and the new English king Edmund met at Leicester in 939 and came to an agreement on dividing England between the two of them. This peace was short-lived and within a few years of the agreement the Vikings had seized the Five Boroughs of Derby, Leicester, Lincoln, Nottingham and Stamford.
In 941 the &quot;Chronicle of Melrose&quot; records that Olaf raided an ancient Anglian church at Tyninghame in what is now the East Lothian and at the time was a part of Northumbria. This attack may have been more than just a raid, and may have been intended to secure a route through Scotland upon which communication between York and Dublin was reliant. Olaf died in 941 and he was succeeded in Northumbria by Olaf Cuaran. In recording his death, the annals title him &quot;king of Danes&quot; (&quot;Chronicon Scotorum&quot;) and &quot;king of the Fair Foreigners and the Dark Foreigners&quot; (&quot;Annals of Clonmacnoise&quot;).

==Burial==
In 2005, a skeleton was excavated in an archaeological dig at Auldhame, East Lothian. Grave goods including a belt similar to others known to have been worn in Viking-age Ireland indicate that the skeleton belonged to a high-status individual. The presence of such goods, and the age of the skeleton, has led to speculation among historians and archaeologists that the remains could be those of Olaf. Olaf is known to have conducted raids on Auldhame and Tyninghame shortly before his death in 941. Auldhame and Tyninghame were two of several local churches dedicated to Saint Baldred. According to Alex Woolf, although the skeleton cannot be definitively identified with Olaf, the date and nature of the burial make it very likely the deceased individual died as a consequence of Olaf&#x27;s attacks in the area in 941. Woolf has also suggested that &quot;there is a strong likelihood that the king’s followers hoped that by burying him in the saint’s cemetery he might have benefitted from some sort of post-mortem penance&quot;.

==Family==
Olaf&#x27;s father is identifiable as Gofraid, who was king of Dublin between 920 and 934, and also briefly ruled Northumbria in 927. Gofraid was a grandson of Ímar but no patronymic is given in the original sources. This may be because he was a child of a son of Ímar who never ruled Dublin, or he was a child of a daughter of Ímar, which in either case would mean his legitimacy to rule in the eyes of his contemporaries was dependent on the identity of his grandfather, not his parents. Ímar, possibly identical to Ivar the Boneless, was the founder of the Uí Ímair and was one of the earliest kings of Dublin in the mid-ninth century.

Three other individuals are identifiable as sons of Gofraid; Albann, Blácaire and Ragnall. Albann was killed in battle against Muirchertach mac Néill in 926. Blácaire ruled Dublin from 939 onwards, and Ragnall mac Gofraid ruled Northumbria in 943 and 944, probably along with his cousin Olaf Cuaran, until they were driven out by Edmund I of England. John of Worcester, writing in the twelfth century, claimed that Olaf had married a daughter of Constantine II of Scotland prior to 937, but this evidence is considered unreliable. The thirteenth century chronicler Roger of Wendover wrote that Olaf married Aldgyth, the daughter of a Northumbrian earl called Orm as a consequence of the agreement at Leicester between Olaf and King Edmund.

An individual named Cammán mac Amlaíb is identifiable as a son of Olaf. The &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; record he was defeated at a place called Dub in 960. Cammán may have been one of the meic Amlaíb (sons of Olaf) who the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; mention in 962. According to this account the sons of Olaf and the Ladgmanns (lawmen) came to Ireland and plundered Conaille Muirtheimne and Howth. Afterward the lawmen went to Munster to avenge their brother Oin. They continued the plunder there and were defeated by the Irish in Uí Liatháin where 365 of them died. In the same year an unnamed son of Olaf led a raid from Ireland&#x27;s Eye on Anglesey and Britain. Cammán may be identical to Sitriuc Cam, an individual who in 962 made a naval attack on Uí Cholgain, but was forced to flee back to ships after a force of Dubliners and Leinstermen overtook him and slaughtered some of his men. An individual named Gofraid mac Amlaíb recorded by the annals as dying in 963 may have been a son of Olaf or he may have been a son of Olaf Cuaran. The &quot;Annals of Clonmacnoise&quot; list an Ímar, a &quot;son of the king&quot;, among the dead at Brunanburh who might be a son of Olaf, although the origin of this list is uncertain.

<text>Del Monte Field (active 1941–1942) was a heavy bomber airfield of the Far East Air Force (FEAF) of the United States Army Air Forces, located in Mindanao in the Philippines. The airfield was located in a meadow of a Del Monte Corporation pineapple plantation.

==Overview==
Del Monte Airfield was first selected in September 1941 as an emergency landing strip on Mindanao, capable of landing four-engine B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers during the May to October wet season. It was built on a natural meadow on the Del Monte Pineapple Corporation plantation along the Sayre Highway, in the municipality of Maluko (now Manolo Fortich) of Bukidnon Province in northern Mindanao. The población of the rural municipality was nearby. The airfield was established as part of the build-up of United States military forces in the Philippines due to the rising tensions with the Japanese Empire.

==History==

===November 1941===
In mid-November 1941, with the creation of the FEAF, General Douglas MacArthur approved the expansion of Del Monte into a heavy bomber base for the 7th Bombardment Group, projected to arrive in early December. His plans, MacArthur told the Chief of Staff on 29 November, called ultimately for more bomber bases in the Visayas to accommodate three additional groups, but since funds for construction of runways for such bases could not be immediately allocated, he agreed to use the field at Del Monte.

On 21 November Col. Harold H. George, acting in place of FEAF commander Maj. Gen. Lewis H. Brereton while he was in Australia trying to arrange support bases for his air force, sent the newly arrived 5th Air Base Group to Del Monte in two inter-island steamers to hurry construction. Work on the field was rushed and by 5 December it was able to accommodate heavy bombers.

Two runways were built: No. 1 (main runway) and No. 2 (pursuit). A golf course was used as a third auxiliary strip. Additional dispersal airstrips were built over the next few months at Dalirig near Del Monte, Malaybalay, Maramag, and Valencia.

On the morning of 4 December, after the only operational FEAF radar site detected Japanese weather reconnaissance flights on several successive nights, MacArthur&#x27;s headquarters ordered the 19th BG to be moved out of range of direct attack. However Brereton decided to send only half of the 35 B-17s at Clark Field to Del Monte because the latter could accommodate only six squadrons and the 7th BG was expected to arrive soon.

Orders were issued on 5 December to move the 16 B-17s of the 14th and 93d Bombardment Squadrons from Clark to Del Monte. Since there were no barracks built at Del Monte yet, and intending to remain only 72 hours, the bombers were filled with tents, cots, blankets and rations. The men also took only what they needed, some toiletries and a few changes of uniform. The aircraft flew down singly on the night of 5–6 December, circling at the end of their 4-hour flight before being permitted to land at dawn (5 December in the United States) at Del Monte No. 1, just completed the day before. Materiel to support the arrival of the 7th BG was not scheduled to leave Luzon until 10 December.

===Battle of the Philippines===
On 8 December, the initial Japanese attack on Clark Field caught most of the remainder of the 19th Bombardment Group on the ground. The bomber and fighter sweeps on the field destroyed most of the aircraft. In the ensuing Battle of the Philippines (1942) and after the destruction of Clark and Nichols Fields on Luzon in the first days of the war, the Japanese flew extensive reconnaissance missions to discover the remaining American aircraft in the Philippines. They had been unable to find the Del Monte field, but it was only a question of time before this last haven would be discovered and destroyed as were the airfields on Luzon. Moreover, it was becoming increasingly difficult to service the B-17s with the inadequate facilities at Del Monte. There were no spare parts, engines, or propellers for the B-17s in the Philippines; damaged B-17s had to be cannibalized to keep the bombers flying. The only tools were those in the possession of the crews. The men who worked on the planes all night often got no rest the next day because of air alerts. On some days the heavy bombers had to remain aloft during the daylight hours to avoid destruction on the ground. They dodged back and forth between Mindanao and Luzon, playing a game of hide-and-seek that wore out men as well as planes.

B-17s flying from Del Monte Airfield became the first United States aircraft to engage in offensive action against the Japanese. On December 14, 1941, the American Army Air Forces reacted to the Japanese invasion of the Philippines at Legaspi, Luzon by sending 3 of a group of 6 Del Monte-based B-17s, ordered to attack the landing force. They attacked a Japanese minesweeper and a transport, thought to be a destroyer, with meager results, and 9 naval aircraft based on the Legaspi strip. The unescorted bombers were no match for the Japanese fighters and soon beat a hasty retreat. Only one of the B-17s was able to make its way back to Del Monte; the others had to crash-land short of their base. The Japanese lost at most 4 fighters.

Under these conditions, it was evident that the remaining heavy bombers could not operate efficiently in the Philippines. General Brereton therefore requested authority on December 15 to move the B-17s to Darwin in northwest Australia, 1,500 miles away, where they could be based safely and serviced properly. His intention was to operate from fields near Darwin, using Del Monte as an advance base from which to strike enemy targets in the Philippines. The planes were immediately prepared for the long flight southward, and on December 15 the first group of B-17s left Del Monte airfield. By the following evening ten of the bombers had reached Batchelor Field outside Darwin. They had left Mindanao none too soon, as the complex of airfields was discovered by the Japanese on December 18, 1941 and attacked the following day by Japanese planes based on the carrier &quot;Ryujo&quot;.

On December 22, 1941, 9 B-17&#x27;s from Batchelor Field near Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia, attacked shipping in Davao Bay, Mindanao Island and landed at Del Monte. The next day 4 B-17s took off from Del Monte after midnight and bombed enemy shipping in Lingayen Gulf. On the 24th, 3 B-17&#x27;s based at Del Monte bombed the airfield and shipping at Davao on the southeast coast of Mindanao before flying to Australia.

On March 16, 1942, Del Monte was later used to evacuate General MacArthur, his family, and senior staff from the Philippines, leaving before midnight. The evacuation party had arrived by PT boat from Corregidor and on March 16, four B-17 Flying Fortresses from Australia flew up to Del Monte: B-17E 41-2408, B-17E 41-2429, B-17E 41-2434 and B-17E 41-2447 and evacuated them to Batchelor Field, arriving on the 17th.

On Thursday, March 26, 1942, Del Monte was again used to evacuate Philippine President, Manuel Quezon, his family, doctors, chaplain, and senior staff. Two B-17&#x27;s had flown up from Australia and arrived at 8:45pm and departed again at 11pm for Australia.

On April 8, 1942, the air echelons of the 24th Pursuit Group along with the remaining Army Air Corps flying operations in the Philippines were withdrawn from Luzon and transferred to Del Monte with whatever aircraft were left to carry on the fight.

In April 1942, a group of 7 B-25s and 3 B-17s from Australia returned to Del Monte for the Royce Mission, to attack the Japanese on three bombing missions. On April 12, B-25s hit the harbor and shipping at Cebu, Cebu Island while B-17s carried out single-bomber strikes against Cebu harbor and Nichols Field on Luzon. On 13 April B-25s hit targets in the Philippines for the second consecutive day. The B-25s took off just after midnight and bombed shipping at Cebu and installations at Davao on Mindanao. Later in the day the B-25s again attacked Davao, bombing the dock area.

The advancing Japanese forced their return to Australia. In addition to the raids, they brought out a number of important military and diplomatic personnel who had gathered at Del Monte to await evacuation. The last of the 24th Pursuit Group&#x27;s aircraft were captured or destroyed by enemy forces on or about May 1, 1942 when the airfield was abandoned by the United States, leaving its facilities to the Japanese invaders.

==Del Monte Airfield today==

The complex was not used by the United States or Philippine Commonwealth armed forces during the Philippines Campaign (1944–45), and the airfields were returned to the Del Monte Pineapple Corporation.

MacArthur evacuation memorial at the site of the Del Monte Field, Manolo Fortich, Bukidnon, Philippines,

The present-day airstrip of the Del Monte company, built for their light aircraft, is about two miles south of the wartime airfield. Both #1 (Main) and #2 (Fighter) fields have become rice paddies and cornfields, a dirt road being the only trace of their wartime purpose. As of October 2013, The Del Monte Airfield is closed to general aviation, but ultralight aircraft, paramotor aircraft from paramotor flying school of Kampo Juan eco resort, and radio-controlled aircraft enthusiasts from nearby Cagayan de Oro city use the airfield with the approval of the Del Monte management.

The Gen. Douglas MacArthur Landmark was erected by the Rotary Club of Northern Bukidnon in Barangay Dicklum to mark the site of Del Monte Field.

<doc id="163847" wikidata="Q202384" url="?curid=163847" title="National Diet">
<text>The is the national legislature of Japan. It is composed of a lower house, called the House of Representatives (, &quot;Shūgiin&quot;), and an upper house, the House of Councillors (, &quot;Sangiin&quot;). Both houses are directly elected under a parallel voting system. In addition to passing laws, the Diet is formally responsible for nominating the prime minister. The Diet was first established as the Imperial Diet in 1890 under the Meiji Constitution, and took its current form in 1947 upon the adoption of the post-war constitution. Both houses meet in the in Nagatachō, Chiyoda, Tokyo.

==Composition==

The houses of the National Diet are both elected under parallel voting systems. This means that the seats to be filled in any given election are divided into two groups, each elected by a different method; the main difference between the houses is in the sizes of the two groups and how they are elected. Voters are asked to cast two votes: one for an individual candidate in a constituency, and one for a party list. Any national of Japan at least 18 years of age may vote in these elections, reduced from age 20 in 2016. Japan&#x27;s parallel voting system (mixed-member majoritarian) is not to be confused with the mixed-member proportional systems used in many other nations. The Constitution of Japan does not specify the number of members of each house of the Diet, the voting system, or the necessary qualifications of those who may vote or be returned in parliamentary elections, thus allowing all of these things to be determined by law. However it does guarantee universal adult suffrage and a secret ballot. It also stipulates that the electoral law must not discriminate in terms of &quot;race, creed, sex, social status, family origin, education, property or income&quot;.

Generally, the election of Diet members is controlled by statutes passed by the Diet. This is a source of contention concerning re-apportionment of prefectures&#x27; seats in response to changes of population distribution. For example, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) had controlled Japan for most of its post-war history, and it gained much of its support from rural areas. During the post-war era, large numbers of people relocated to urban centers for economic reasons; though some re-apportionments have been made to the number of each prefecture&#x27;s assigned seats in the Diet, rural areas generally have more representation than do urban areas. Among rural interests, Japanese rice farmers historically had particular influence in internal LDP politics and national policies on trade and agricultural subsidies.

The Supreme Court of Japan began exercising judicial review of apportionment laws following the &quot;Kurokawa&quot; decision of 1976, invalidating an election in which one district in Hyōgo Prefecture received five times the representation of another district in Osaka Prefecture. In the most recent elections, the malapportionment ratio amounted to 3.03 in the House of Councillors (2022 election: Kanagawa/Fukui) and 2.06 in the House of Representatives (2024 election: Hokkaidō 3/Tottori 1).

Candidates for the lower house must be 25 years old or older and 30 years or older for the upper house. All candidates must be Japanese nationals. Under Article 49 of Japan&#x27;s Constitution, Diet members are paid about ¥1.3 million a month in salary. Each lawmaker is entitled to employ three secretaries with taxpayer funds, free Shinkansen tickets, and four round-trip airplane tickets a month to enable them to travel back and forth to their home districts.

==Powers==

Article 41 of the Constitution describes the National Diet as &quot;the highest organ of State power&quot; and &quot;the sole law-making organ of the State&quot;. This statement is in forceful contrast to the Meiji Constitution, which described the Emperor as the one who exercised legislative power with the consent of the Diet. The Diet&#x27;s responsibilities include not only the making of laws but also the approval of the annual national budget that the government submits and the ratification of treaties. It can also initiate draft constitutional amendments, which, if approved, must be presented to the people in a referendum. The Diet may conduct &quot;investigations in relation to government&quot; (Article 62).

The Prime Minister must be designated by Diet resolution, establishing the principle of legislative supremacy over executive government agencies (Article 67). The government can also be dissolved by the Diet if the House of Representatives passes a motion of no confidence introduced by fifty members of the House of Representatives. Government officials, including the Prime Minister and Cabinet members, are required to appear before Diet investigative committees and answer inquiries. The Diet also has the power to impeach judges convicted of criminal or irregular conduct.

In most circumstances, in order to become law a bill must be first passed by both houses of the Diet and then promulgated by the Emperor. This role of the Emperor is similar to the Royal Assent in some other nations; however, the Emperor cannot refuse to promulgate a law and therefore his legislative role is merely a formality.

The House of Representatives is the more powerful chamber of the Diet. While the House of Representatives cannot usually overrule the House of Councillors on a bill, the House of Councillors can only delay the adoption of a budget or a treaty that has been approved by the House of Representatives, and the House of Councillors has almost no power at all to prevent the lower house from selecting any Prime Minister it wishes. Furthermore, once appointed it is the confidence of the House of Representatives alone that the Prime Minister must enjoy in order to continue in office. The House of Representatives can overrule the upper house in the following circumstances:
* If a bill is adopted by the House of Representatives and then either rejected, amended or not approved within 60 days by the House of Councillors, then the bill will become law if again adopted by the House of Representatives by a majority of at least two-thirds of members present.
* If both houses cannot agree on a budget or a treaty, even through the appointment of a joint committee of the Diet, or if the House of Councillors fails to take final action on a proposed budget or treaty within 30 days of its approval by the House of Representatives, then the decision of the lower house is deemed to be that of the Diet.
* If both houses cannot agree on a candidate for Prime Minister, even through a joint committee, or if the House of Councillors fails to designate a candidate within 10 days of House of Representatives&#x27; decision, then the nominee of the lower house is deemed to be that of the Diet.

==Activities==
Under the Constitution, at least one session of the Diet must be convened each year. Technically, only the House of Representatives is &quot;dissolved&quot; before an election. But, while the lower house is in dissolution, the House of Councillors is usually &quot;closed&quot;. The Emperor both convokes the Diet and dissolves the House of Representatives but in doing so must act on the &quot;advice&quot; of the Cabinet. In an emergency the Cabinet can convoke the Diet for an extraordinary session, and an extraordinary session may be requested by one-quarter of the members of either house. At the beginning of each parliamentary session, the Emperor reads a special speech from his throne in the chamber of the House of Councillors.

The presence of one-third of the membership of either house constitutes a quorum and deliberations are in public unless at least two-thirds of those present agree otherwise. Each house elects its own presiding officer who casts the deciding vote in the event of a tie. The Diet has parliamentary immunity. Members of each house have certain protections against arrest while the Diet is in session and arrested members must be released during the term of the session if the House demands. They are immune outside the house for words spoken and votes cast in the House. Each house of the Diet determines its own standing orders and has responsibility for disciplining its own members. A member may be expelled, but only by a two-thirds majority vote. Every member of the Cabinet has the right to appear in either house of the Diet for the purpose of speaking on bills, and each house has the right to compel the appearance of Cabinet members.

=== Legislative process ===
The vast majority of bills are submitted to the Diet by the Cabinet. Bills are usually drafted by the relevant ministry, sometimes with the advice of an external committee if the issue is sufficiently important or neutrality is necessary. Such advisory committees may include university professors, trade union representatives, industry representatives, and local governors and mayors, and invariably include retired officials. Such draft bills would be sent to the Cabinet Legislation Bureau of the government, as well as to the ruling party.

==Building==
==History==
Japan&#x27;s first modern legislature was the established by the Meiji Constitution in force from 1889 to 1947. The Meiji Constitution was adopted on February 11, 1889, and the Imperial Diet first met on November 29, 1890, when the document entered into force. The first Imperial Diet of 1890 was plagued by controversy and political tensions. The Prime Minister of Japan at that time was General Count Yamagata Aritomo, who entered into a confrontation with the legislative body over military funding. During this time, there were many critics of the army who derided the Meiji slogan of &quot;rich country, strong military&quot; as in effect producing a poor country (albeit with a strong military). They advocated for infrastructure projects and lower taxes instead and felt their interests were not being served by high levels of military spending. As a result of these early conflicts, public opinion of politicians was not favorable.

The Imperial Diet consisted of a House of Representatives and a . The House of Representatives was directly elected, if on a limited franchise; universal adult male suffrage was introduced in 1925 when the Universal Manhood Suffrage Law was passed, but excluded women, and was limited to men 25 years or older. The House of Peers, much like the British House of Lords, consisted of high-ranking nobles chosen by the Emperor.

The first election by universal suffrage without distinction of sex was held in 1946, but it was not until 1947, when the constitution for post-war Japan came into effect, that universal suffrage was established In Japan.

The word &quot;diet&quot; derives from Latin and was a common name for an assembly in medieval European polities like the Holy Roman Empire. The Meiji Constitution was largely based on the form of constitutional monarchy found in nineteenth century Prussia that placed the king not as a servant of the state but rather the sole holder of power and sovereignty over his kingdom, which the Japanese view of their emperor and his role at the time favoured. The new Diet was modeled partly on the German Reichstag and partly on the British Westminster system. Unlike the post-war constitution, the Meiji constitution granted a real political role to the Emperor, although in practice the Emperor&#x27;s powers were largely directed by a group of oligarchs called the &quot;genrō&quot; or elder statesmen.

To become law or bill, a constitutional amendment had to have the assent of both the Diet and the Emperor. This meant that while the Emperor could no longer legislate by decree he still had a veto over the Diet. The Emperor also had complete freedom in choosing the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, and so, under the Meiji Constitution, Prime Ministers often were not chosen from and did not enjoy the confidence of the Diet. The Imperial Diet was also limited in its control over the budget. However, the Diet could veto the annual budget. If no budget was approved, the budget of the previous year continued in force. This changed with the new constitution after World War II.

The proportional representation system for the House of Councillors, introduced in 1982, was the first major electoral reform under the post-war constitution. Instead of choosing national constituency candidates as individuals, as had previously been the case, voters cast ballots for parties. Individual councillors, listed officially by the parties before the election, are selected on the basis of the parties&#x27; proportions of the total national constituency vote. The system was introduced to reduce the excessive money spent by candidates for the national constituencies. Critics charged, however, that this new system benefited the two largest parties, the LDP and the Japan Socialist Party (now Social Democratic Party), which in fact had sponsored the reform.

== List of sessions ==

There are three types of sessions of the National Diet:
* R – &quot;jōkai&quot; (常会), regular, annual sessions of the National Diet, often shortened to &quot;regular National Diet&quot; (通常国会, &quot;tsūjō Kokkai&quot;). These are nowadays usually called in January, they last for 150 days and can be extended once.
* E – &quot;rinjikai&quot; (臨時会), extraordinary sessions of the National Diet, often shortened to &quot;extraordinary National Diet&quot; (臨時国会, &quot;rinji Kokkai&quot;). These are often called in autumn, or in the summer after a regular election of the House of Councillors (参議院議員通常選挙, &quot;sangiingiin tsūjōsenkyo&quot;) or after a full-term general election of the House of Representatives (衆議院議員総選挙, &quot;shūgiingiin sōsenkyo&quot;). Its length is negotiated between the two houses, it can be extended twice.
* S – &quot;tokubetsukai&quot; (特別会), special sessions of the National Diet, often shortened to &quot;special National Diet&quot; (特別国会, &quot;tokubetsu Kokkai&quot;). They are called only after a dissolution and early general election of the House of Representatives. Because the cabinet must resign after a House of Representatives election, the National Diet always chooses a prime minister-designate in a special session (but inversely, not all PM elections take place in a special Diet). A special session can be extended twice.
* HCES – There is a fourth type of legislative session: If the House of Representatives is dissolved, a National Diet cannot be convened. In urgent cases, the cabinet may invoke an emergency session (緊急集会, &quot;kinkyū shūkai&quot;) of the House of Councillors to take provisional decisions for the whole Diet. As soon as the whole National Diet convenes again, these decisions must be confirmed by the House of Representatives or become ineffective. Such emergency sessions have been called twice in history, in 1952 and 1953.

Any session of the National Diet may be cut short by a dissolution of the House of Representatives (衆議院解散, &quot;shūgiin kaisan&quot;). In the table, this is listed simply as &quot;(dissolution)&quot;; the House of Councillors or the National Diet as such cannot be dissolved.

<text>Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza (; 25 January 1922 – 31 August 2018) was an Italian geneticist. He was a population geneticist who taught at the University of Parma, the University of Pavia and then at Stanford University.

==Works==
===Schooling and positions===
Cavalli-Sforza entered Ghislieri College in Pavia in 1939 and he received his M.D. from the University of Pavia in 1944. In 1949, he was appointed to a research post at the Department of Genetics, Cambridge University by the statistician and evolutionary biologist Ronald A. Fisher in the field of &quot;E. coli&quot; genetics. In 1950, he left the University of Cambridge to teach in northern Italy (Parma, and Pavia) before taking up a professorship at Stanford in 1970. He remained at Stanford until he retired in 1992.

In 1999 he won the Balzan Prize for the Science of human origins. He has been a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences since 1994. In 1992 he was elected Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London. He was awarded the Telesio-Galilei Academy Award in 2011 for Biology.

===Specific contributions===
Cavalli-Sforza initiated a new field of research by combining the concrete findings of demography with a newly available analysis of blood groups in an actual human population. He also studied the connections between migration patterns and blood groups.

Writing in the mid-1960s with A.W.F. Edwards, another genetics student of Ronald A. Fisher, Cavalli-Sforza pioneered statistical methods for estimating evolutionary trees (phylogenies). Edwards and Cavalli-Sforza wrote about trees of populations within the human species, where genetic differences are affected both by treelike patterns of historical separation of populations and by spread of genes among populations by migration and admixture. Many of these influential and fundamental early papers were reprinted in 2018 in a volume focusing on A. W. F. Edwards, and dedicated to Cavalli-Sforza and Ian Hacking. In later papers, Cavalli-Sforza has written about the effects of both divergence and migration on human gene frequencies.

While Cavalli-Sforza is best known for his work in genetics, he also, in collaboration with Marcus Feldman and others, initiated the sub-discipline of cultural anthropology known alternatively as coevolution, gene-culture coevolution, cultural transmission theory or dual inheritance theory. The publication &quot;Cultural Transmission and Evolution: A Quantitative Approach&quot; (1981) made use of models from population genetics and infectious disease epidemiology to investigate the transmission of culturally transmitted units. This line of inquiry initiated research into the correlation of patterns of genetic and cultural dispersion.

Cavalli-Sforza conducted several studies of how language differences may serve as barriers to gene flow between adjacent human populations. His studies of human migration have tested hypotheses of linguists Merritt Ruhlen and Joseph Greenberg about language &quot;superfamilies&quot;. The hypothesized superfamilies are controversial among other linguists.

===Books===
Cavalli-Sforza has summed up his work for laymen in five topics covered in &quot;Genes, Peoples, and Languages&quot;. According to an article published in &quot;The Economist&quot;, the work of Cavalli-Sforza &quot;challenges the assumption that there are significant genetic differences between human races, and indeed, the idea that &#x27;race&#x27; has any useful biological meaning at all&quot;. The book illustrates both the problems of constructing a general &quot;hereditary tree&quot; for the entire human race, and some mechanisms and data analysis methods to greatly reduce these problems, thus constructing a fascinating hypothesis of the recent 150,000 years of human expansion, migration, and human diversity formation. In the book Cavalli-Sforza asserts that Europeans are, in their ancestry, about two-thirds Asian and one-third African.

Cavalli-Sforza&#x27;s &quot;The History and Geography of Human Genes&quot; (1994 with Paolo Menozzi and Alberto Piazza) is a standard reference on human genetic variation. Cavalli-Sforza also wrote &quot;The Great Human Diasporas: The History of Diversity and Evolution&quot; (together with his son Francesco).

Earlier, in the 1970s, he and Walter Bodmer wrote what was the standard textbook on modern human genetics, and was also a basic reference for population genetics more generally, as the field was at the time, &quot;The Genetics of Human Populations&quot; (W. H. Freeman, 1971). The two, with Bodmer as first author, later wrote another more basic text, &quot;Genetics, Evolution, and Man&quot; (W. H. Freeman, 1976). Along with his 1994 book these are essentially classical presentations of human genetics before the genomics era began providing very much more detailed data.

==Death==
Cavalli-Sforza died on 31 August 2018, at the age of 96 at his home in Belluno, Italy. He is survived by three sons Matteo, Francesco and Luca Tommaso Cavalli-Sforza, and one daughter, Violetta Cavalli-Sforza.

<doc id="163852" wikidata="Q204826" url="?curid=163852" title="Calque">
<text>In linguistics, a calque () or loan translation is a word or phrase borrowed from another language by literal word-for-word or root-for-root translation. When used as a verb, “to calque” means to borrow a word or phrase from another language while translating its components, so as to create a new word or phrase (lexeme) in the target language. For instance, the English word &quot;skyscraper&quot; has been calqued in dozens of other languages, combining words for &quot;sky&quot; and &quot;scrape&quot; in each language, as for example in German, in Portuguese, in Spanish, in Italian, in Turkish, and in Japanese.

Calquing is distinct from phono-semantic matching: while calquing includes semantic translation, it does not consist of phonetic matching—i.e., of retaining the approximate sound of the borrowed word by matching it with a similar-sounding pre-existing word or morpheme in the target language.

Proving that a word is a calque sometimes requires more documentation than does an untranslated loanword because, in some cases, a similar phrase might have arisen in both languages independently. This is less likely to be the case when the grammar of the proposed calque is quite different from that of the borrowing language, or when the calque contains less obvious imagery.

== Types ==
One system classifies calques into five groups. This terminology is not universal:
* &quot;Phraseological calques&quot;: idiomatic phrases are translated word for word. For example, &quot;it goes without saying&quot; calques the French .
* &quot;Syntactic calques&quot;: syntactic functions or constructions of the source language are imitated in the target language, in violation of their meaning. For example, the use of &quot;by&quot; instead of &quot;with&quot; in the phrase &quot;fine by me&quot; is thought to have come from Yiddish , namely from the 1930s Yiddish Broadway musical song title / / .
* &quot;Loan-translations&quot;: words are translated morpheme by morpheme, or component by component, into another language. 
* &quot;Semantic calques&quot; (also known as &quot;semantic loans&quot;): additional meanings of the source word are transferred to the word with the same primary meaning in the target language. As described below, the &quot;computer mouse&quot; was named in English for its resemblance to the animal; many other languages have extended their own native word for &quot;mouse&quot; to include the computer mouse.
* &quot;Morphological calques&quot;: the inflection of a word is transferred. Some authors call this a &quot;morpheme-by-morpheme translation&quot;.

Some linguists refer to a &quot;phonological calque&quot;, in which the pronunciation of a word is imitated in the other language. For example, the English word &quot;radar&quot; becomes the similar-sounding Chinese word (), which literally means &quot;to arrive (as fast) as thunder&quot;.

===Partial===

Partial calques, or loan blends, translate some parts of a compound but not others. For example, the name of the Irish digital television service is a partial calque of that of the UK service &quot;Freeview&quot;, translating the first half of the word from English to Irish but leaving the second half unchanged. Other examples include &quot;liverwurst&quot; (&lt; German ) and &quot;apple strudel&quot; (&lt; German ).

=== Semantic ===
The &quot;computer mouse&quot; was named in English for its resemblance to the animal. Many other languages use their word for &quot;mouse&quot; for the &quot;computer mouse&quot;, sometimes using a diminutive or, in Chinese, adding the word &quot;cursor&quot; (), making &quot;mouse cursor&quot; (). Another example is the Spanish word &quot;ratón&quot; that means both the animal and the computer mouse.

== Examples ==
The common English phrase &quot;flea market&quot; is a loan translation of the French (&quot;market with fleas&quot;). At least 22 other languages calque the French expression directly or indirectly through another language.

The word &quot;loanword&quot; is a calque of the German noun . In contrast, the term &quot;calque&quot; is a loanword, from the French noun (&quot;tracing, imitation, close copy&quot;).

Another example of a common morpheme-by-morpheme loan-translation is of the English word &quot;&quot;, a kenning-like term which may be calqued using the word for &quot;sky&quot; or &quot;cloud&quot; and the word, variously, for &quot;scrape&quot;, &quot;scratch&quot;, &quot;pierce&quot;, &quot;sweep&quot;, &quot;kiss&quot;, etc. At least 54 languages have their own versions of the English word.

Some Germanic and Slavic languages derived their words for &quot;translation&quot; from words meaning &quot;carrying across&quot; or &quot;bringing across&quot;, calquing from the Latin or .

The Latin weekday names came to be associated by ancient Germanic speakers with their own gods following a practice known as : the Latin &quot;Day of Mercury&quot;, (later in modern French), was borrowed into Late Proto-Germanic as the &quot;Day of Wōđanaz&quot; (&quot;Wodanesdag&quot;), which became in Old English, then &quot;Wednesday&quot; in Modern English.

== History ==

Since at least 1894, according to the , the French term &quot;calque&quot; has been used in its linguistic sense, namely in a publication by Louis Duvau:
Since at least 1926, the term &quot;calque&quot; has been attested in English through a publication by the linguist :

: [...] such imitative forms are called (or ) by French philologists, and this is a frequent method in coining abstract terminology, whether nouns or verbs.

<text>Amlaíb mac Sitric (d. 980; ), commonly called Amlaíb Cuarán (O.N.: ), was a 10th-century Norse-Gael who was King of Northumbria and Dublin. His byname, &quot;cuarán&quot;, is usually translated as &quot;sandal&quot;. His name appears in a variety of anglicized forms, including Olaf Cuaran, Anlaf Sihtricson and Olaf Sihtricson, particularly in relation to his short-lived rule in York. He was the last of the Uí Ímair to play a major part in the politics of the British Isles.

Amlaíb was twice, perhaps three times, ruler of Northumbria and twice ruler of Dublin and its dependencies. His reign over these territories spanned some forty years. He was a renowned warrior and a ruthless pillager of churches, but ended his days in retirement at Iona Abbey. Born when the Uí Ímair ruled over large areas of the British Isles, by his death the kingdom of Dublin was a minor power in Irish politics. At the same time, Dublin became a major centre of trade in Atlantic Europe and mastery over the city and its wealth became the supreme prize for ambitious Irish kings.

In death Amlaíb was the prototype for the Middle English romance character Havelok the Dane. In life he was a patron of Irish poets and Scandinavian skalds who wrote verses praising their paymaster. Amlaíb was married at least twice, and had many children who married into Irish and Scandinavian royal families. His descendants were kings in the Isle of Man and the Hebrides until the 13th century.

==Background==

The earliest records of attacks by Vikings in Britain or Ireland are at the end of the eighth century. The monastery on Lindisfarne, in the kingdom of Northumbria, was sacked on 8 June 793, and the monastery of Iona in the kingdom of the Picts was attacked in 795 and 802. In Ireland Rathlin Island, off the north-east coast, was the target in 795, and so too was St Patrick&#x27;s Island on the east coast in 798. Portland in the kingdom of Wessex in south-west Britain was attacked during the reign of King Beorhtric of Wessex (ruled from 786 to 802).

These raids continued in a sporadic fashion throughout the first quarter of the ninth century. During the second quarter of the century the frequency and size of raids increased and the first permanent Viking settlements (called longphorts in Ireland) appeared.

==Origins==

The Ímar from whom the Uí Ímair were descended is generally presumed to be that Ímar (English pronunciation &quot;Ivar&quot;): &quot;king of the Northmen of all Britain and Ireland&quot;, whose death is reported by the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; in 873. Whether this Ímar is to be identified with Ivar the Boneless, the leader of the Great Heathen Army, is rather less certain, although at the same time not unlikely.

Amlaíb Cuarán was probably a great-grandson of Ímar. There is no contemporary evidence setting out the descent from Ímar to his grandsons, but it may be that the grandsons of Ímar recorded between 896 and 934—Amlaíb Cuarán&#x27;s father Sitriuc (d. 927), Ragnall (d. 921), Gofraid (d. 934), Ímar (d. 904) and Amlaíb (d. 896)—were brothers rather than cousins. Amlaíb&#x27;s father Sitriuc first appears in the record in 917 when he seized Dublin, a settlement which had probably been under the control of an Irish king since the expulsion of the previous Viking rulers in 902.

Sitriuc ruled Northumbria until his death in 927. Manuscript D of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records his marriage to King Æthelstan&#x27;s sister at Tamworth on 30 January 926. According to some late sources, such as the chronicler John of Wallingford, copying a lost northern record, Amlaíb was the son of Sitriuc and Æthelstan&#x27;s sister, perhaps called Osgifu or Eadgyth. The historian Benjamin Hudson comments that &quot;there is no obvious reason why the chronicle copied by John of Wallingford would fabricate this information, and the claim is supported by the historian Neil McGuigan. Sitriuc&#x27;s other sons included Gofraid (died 951), king of Dublin, Aralt (died 940), ruler of Limerick, and, less certainly, Sichfrith and Auisle, listed among those killed at the battle of Brunanburh in 937 by the &quot;Annals of Clonmacnoise&quot;. A daughter of Sitriuc named Gytha is said in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; to have married Norwegian pirate king Olaf Tryggvason, but she was probably a daughter of Amlaíb Cuarán.

Following Sitriuc&#x27;s death, Amlaíb may have become king in York for a short time, but if he did it came to an end when Æthelstan took over the kingdom of Northumbria and defeated Sitriuc&#x27;s brother Gofraid. According to William of Malmesbury, Amlaíb fled to Ireland while his uncle Gofraid made a second unsuccessful attempt to gain control of York. In 937 an attack on Æthelstan&#x27;s kingdom by Gofraid&#x27;s son Amlaíb, assisted by Constantín mac Áeda, the king of Alba, and Owen, the king of Strathclyde, ended in defeat at the battle of Brunanburh. William of Malmesbury wrote that Amlaíb was present at Brunanburh and spied out the English camp the night before the battle disguised as a skald.

King Æthelstan died in 939 and his successor, his half-brother Edmund, was unable to keep control of York. Amlaíb mac Gofrith, ruling in Dublin, crossed to Britain where he was accepted as king of the Northumbrians. He died in 941, shortly after sacking the church of Saint Baldred at Tyninghame, struck dead by the saint&#x27;s power according to the &quot;Historia de Sancto Cuthberto&quot;. This traditional view of Amlaíb mac Gofrith&#x27;s later career has recently been disputed by Kevin Halloran. The basic argument presented is that Amlaíb mac Gofrith did not rule in York and the suggestion that only one Amlaíb, Amlaíb Cuarán, was king there may explain some of the apparent anomalies in the numismatic record.

==York==

Amlaíb Cuarán&#x27;s career began in 941, following the death of his cousin Amlaíb mac Gofrith, when he became co-ruler of York, sharing power with his cousin Ragnall son of Gofraid. According to the &quot;Annals of Clonmacnoise&quot;, Amlaíb had been in Britain since 940, having left another son of Gofraid, Blácaire, as ruler of Dublin.

Amlaíb and Ragnall ruled in York until 944. The dating of events in the period between the death of Æthelstan and the expulsion of Amlaíb and Ragnall is uncertain as the various versions of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; are in conflict. It appears that after Æthelstan&#x27;s death, not only did Edmund lose control of Northumbria, but that the Five Burghs of the Mercian Danelaw also pledged themselves to Amlaíb mac Gofrith. One of the Amlaíbs stormed Tamworth according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;:Here Olaf broke down Tamworth and a great slaughter fell on either side, and the Danes had the victory and led much war-booty away with them. Wulfrun was seized in the raid. Here King Edmund besieged King Olaf and Archbishop Wulfstan in Leicester, and he might have controlled them had they not escaped from the stronghold in the night. It is not clear when in the period between 940 and 943 these events took place, and as a result historians disagree as to whether they concern Amlaíb mac Gofrith or Amlaíb Cuarán.

Edmund reconquered the Five Burghs in 942, an event celebrated in verse by the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; reports the baptism of Amlaíb, with King Edmund becoming his godfather. This need not mean that Amlaíb was not already a Christian, nor would such a baptism have permanently committed him to Christianity, as such baptisms were often political acts. Alfred the Great, for example, had sponsored the confirmation of Christian Welsh king Anarawd ap Rhodri. Amlaíb was expelled from the kingship of York in 944. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; reports that &quot;King Edmund conquered all Northumbria and caused to flee away two kings [or &quot;royally-born men&quot;], Olaf and Rægnald&quot;. It is possible that rivalry between Amlaíb and Ragnall contributed to their fall. Æthelweard&#x27;s history reports that Amlaíb was deposed by a coup led by Wulfstan, Archbishop of York, and an unnamed Mercian ealdorman.

==Congalach and Ruaidrí==

After being driven out of Northumbria, Amlaíb returned to Ireland while Ragnall may have been killed at York. The Uí Ímair in Ireland had also suffered in 944 as Dublin was sacked that year by the High King of Ireland Congalach Cnogba, whose power base lay in Brega, north of Dublin on the lower reaches of the River Boyne. The following year, perhaps as a result of the sack of Dublin, Amlaíb&#x27;s cousin Blácaire was driven out and Amlaíb replaced him as ruler of Dublin. Amlaíb was allied with Congalach and may have gained power with his assistance.

Congalach and Amlaíb fought against Ruaidrí ua Canannáin, a rival for the High Kingship who belonged to the Cenél Conaill, based in modern County Donegal. In 945 the two defeated part of Ruaidrí&#x27;s army in Conaille Muirtheimne (modern County Louth) and the following year Amlaíb raided Kilcullen in the province of Leinster. In 947 Ruaidrí routed Congalach and Amlaíb at Slane. Losses among the Dublin men were heavy, with many drowning while fleeing the battle. This defeat appears to have lost Amlaíb his kingship, as the annals record that Blácaire, not Amlaíb, was the leader of the Dublin forces in the following year. Blácaire was killed in 948 by Congalach, and was succeeded by Amlaíb&#x27;s brother Gofraid.

==York again==

The course of events in Northumbria while Amlaíb was in Ireland is uncertain. While Edmund certainly controlled Northumbria after Amlaíb was expelled and Ragnall killed, he may soon after have lost control of the north to a Scandinavian king named Eiríkr, usually identified with Eric Bloodaxe. If Erik did rule in Northumbria before Edmund&#x27;s death, it was only for a short time. Edmund was killed in 946, and succeeded by his brother Eadred. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records that Eadred &quot;reduced all the land of Northumbria to his control; and the Scots granted him oaths that they would do all that he wanted&quot;. The Northumbrian submission to Eadred led to a meeting with the notables of York led by Archbishop Wulfstan in 947, but the following year King Erik was back ruling Northumbria and Eadred laid waste to the southern parts of the kingdom— Ripon is mentioned as a particular target—to force the Northumbrians to expel Erik, which they did.

The following year, 949, by which time Blacáire was dead and Amlaíb&#x27;s brother ruling in Dublin, the Northumbrians invited Amlaíb to rule in York. His return to England may have been with Eadred&#x27;s agreement. That year Máel Coluim mac Domnaill, the king of Alba, raided Northumbria as far south as the River Tees, capturing many slaves and much loot. Whether this invasion was directed against Amlaíb, or perhaps intended to support him by plundering only northern Northumbria which may have been outside his control, is uncertain. A second invasion from the north in 952, this time an alliance including Máel Coluim&#x27;s Scots and also Britons and Saxons, was defeated. Again, whether this was aimed against Amlaíb, who was deposed in 952 and replaced by Erik, or was mounted against King Erik in support of Amlaíb, is unclear. Erik&#x27;s reign was short and the Viking kingdom of York was definitively incorporated into the kingdom of the English on his death in 954. Amlaíb returned to Ireland, never again to rule in York.

==From Dublin to Iona==
In 951, while Amlaíb was in Britain his brother Gofraid died in Dublin of disease. Congalach&#x27;s rival Ruaidrí was also dead, leaving Amlaíb&#x27;s former ally as undisputed High King and thus a serious threat to Dublin and the south-eastern Irish kingdom of Leinster. This threat was perhaps what led to Congalach&#x27;s death in an ambush at Dún Ailinne (modern County Kildare) or at Tech Guigenn in the region of the River Liffey while collecting tribute in Leinster in 956. The main beneficiary was the brother of Amlaíb&#x27;s new wife Dúnflaith, Domnall ua Néill, who became the next High King of Ireland. The marriage linked Amlaíb not only to the northern Uí Néill kindred of Cenél nEógain, but also to the southern Clann Cholmáin as he was now stepfather to Dúnflaith&#x27;s young son Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill.

In the early 960s Amlaíb Cuarán probably faced a challenge from the sons of his cousin Amlaíb mac Gofrith. In 960 the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; report that Cammán, son of Amlaíb mac Gofrith, was defeated at an unidentifiable place named &quot;Dub&quot;. Two years later one Sitriuc Cam—Cam means crooked or twisted and Cammán is simply the hypocoristic form of this byname, so that Sitriuc Cam and Cammán are presumed to be the same person—was defeated by the Dubliners led by Amlaíb Cuarán and the Leinstermen while raiding in Leinster. Amlaíb Cuarán was wounded in the battle but Sitriuc fled to his ships. Sitriuc and his brothers appear to have raided Munster after this, but disappear from the record soon afterwards and do not appear to have returned to Ireland.

Amlaíb&#x27;s activities in the early 960s seem largely to have been limited to occasional raids in Leinster. He attacked Kildare in 964, and it was a target again in 967 when Muiredach mac Faeláin, abbot of Kildare, a member of the Uí Dúnlainge kindred which ruled Leinster, was killed by Amlaíb and Cerball mac Lorcáin, a kinsman of Muiredach&#x27;s. Another raid south in 964 ended in a heavy defeat for Amlaíb near Inistogue (modern County Kildare) at the hands of the Osraige.

Until the late 960s Domnall ua Néill, Congalach&#x27;s successor as would-be High King, was occupied with enemies close to home, and in Connacht and Munster, and did not intervene in Leinster or the hinterlands of Dublin. Having defeated these, in 968 he marched south and plundered Leinster, killing several notables, and laid siege to Dublin for two months. While Domnall did not take the port, he carried off a great many cattle. Amlaíb, allied with the king of Leinster Murchad mac Finn, retaliated by attacking the abbey of Kells in 969. A pursuit by ua Néill&#x27;s allies was defeated near Ardmulchan (County Meath).

In 970 Domnall ua Néill and his allies attacked Amlaíb&#x27;s new-found ally, Congalach&#x27;s son Domnall, the king of Brega. Domnall mac Congalaig was married to a daughter of Amlaíb, perhaps at about this time. Churches in Brega, including Monasterboice and Dunleer, guarded by Amlaíb&#x27;s soldiers, were a particular target of the raids. Domnall of Brega and Amlaíb fought against Domnall ua Néill&#x27;s northern army at Kilmona in modern County Westmeath. Domnall&#x27;s army, which included allies from Ulaid, was defeated, and Ardgal mac Matudáin, king of Ulaid, and Cináed mac Crongilla, king of Conaille Muirtheimne, were among those killed. The battle at Kilmona did not end the war in the midlands. Monasterboice and Dunleer were burned after the battle and fighting spread to the lands of Clann Cholmáin the following year when Domnall ua Néill&#x27;s enemies there drove him out, only for him to return with an army and ravage both Mide and the lands around Dublin before marching south to attack Leinster. This campaign appears to have established Domnall ua Néill as effective overlord of the midlands and Leinster for some years.

In 977, in unknown circumstances, Domnall ua Néill&#x27;s sons Congalach and Muirchertach were killed and Amlaíb is given credit for their deaths by the annals. Domnall made no effort to avenge the deaths, retiring to the monastery at Armagh where he died in 980. The Dubliners campaigned against Leinster the late 970s. The overking of Leinster, Úgaire mac Túathail, was captured in 976. He was evidently ransomed or released as he was killed, along with Muiredach mac Riain of Uí Cheinnselaig of south Leinster, fighting against the Dubliners in 978 at Belan (County Kildare). Úgaire&#x27;s successor Domnall Claen was little more fortunate, being captured by the Dubliners the following year.

Following the death of High King Domnall ua Néill, Amlaíb&#x27;s stepson Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill claimed the title. Amlaíb&#x27;s former ally Domnall son of Congalach had died in 976, removing one potential rival, and as Amlaíb had killed two of Domnall ua Néill&#x27;s sons he may have cleared the way for Máel Sechnaill to take power. If so, it was unlikely to be by design. Máel Sechnaill had become king of Mide and head of Clann Cholmáin in 975 and had inaugurated his reign with an attack on his stepfather when he burned &quot;Thor&#x27;s Wood&quot; outside Dublin. In 980 Máel Sechnaill had the support of the Leinstermen when he faced Amlaíb&#x27;s sons—Amlaíb himself was by now an old man—near the hill of Tara. The Dubliners too had allies as the Irish annals record the presence of warriors from the Isle of Man or the Hebrides. Amlaíb&#x27;s son Ragnall (Rögnvaldr) was among the dead in the battle which followed, and although several kings fighting alongside Máel Sechnaill were killed, the result was clearly a crushing blow for Dublin. Máel Sechnaill occupied the city and imposed a heavy tribute on the citizens.

In the aftermath of this defeat Amlaíb abdicated, or was removed from power. He was replaced by a son named Glúniairn (Járnkné), a son of Dúnlaith and thus Máel Sechnaill&#x27;s half-brother. Amlaíb retired to the monastery on Iona where he died soon afterwards.
==Marriages and children==
He was succeeded by his son Glúniairn (&quot;Járnkné&quot;, literally &quot;Iron Knee&quot;), son of his wife Dúnlaith, daughter of Muirchertach mac Néill. Among his wives was Gormflaith, daughter of Murchad mac Finn, King of Leinster, and future wife of Brian Boru. Gormflaith&#x27;s son Sitric Silkbeard was king of Dublin after Glúniairn&#x27;s death. Amlaíb&#x27;s other children included Gytha, who married Olaf Tryggvason, Máel Muire, who married Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill, and Harald, possibly the grandfather of Godred Crovan.

==Cuarán==
Amlaíb&#x27;s byname, &quot;cuarán&quot;, is usually translated as &quot;sandal&quot; or &quot;shoe&quot;. It derives from the Old Irish word &quot;cúar&quot; meaning bent or crooked. It is first applied to him in the report of the battle of Slane in 947 in the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot;. The usual translation may be misleading. The epithet probably refers to a distinctive style of footwear. Benjamin Hudson points to the description of a &quot;cuarán&quot; in a twelfth-century satire, where it is made of leather folded seven times and has a pointed toe. In &quot;Aislinge Meic Con Glinne&quot; and &quot;Scél Baili Binnbérlaig&quot;, the &quot;cuarán&quot; is waterproof. In the first story Mac Con Glinne cleans his by dipping them in his bath; in the second, a &quot;cuarán&quot; serves as a vessel to drink from. That the &quot;cuarán&quot; was a piece of footwear specific to Dublin is suggested by statements in other stories that have cobblers in the town owing a &quot;cuarán&quot; in taxes.

==Icelandic sagas==
Amlaíb Cuarán (Olaf Kvaran) is referred to at least twice in the Icelandic sagas, once in &quot;Njal&#x27;s Saga&quot; and again in &quot;Saga of Gunnlaugr Serpent-Tongue&quot;. It is from these references that Einar Hjörleifsson Kvaran and his siblings chose the name &quot;Kvaran&quot; as their own.

<doc id="163854" wikidata="Q1646867" url="?curid=163854" title="Neverland">
<text>Neverland is a fictional island featured in the works of J. M. Barrie and those based on them. It is an imaginary faraway place where Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Captain Hook, the Lost Boys, and some other imaginary beings and creatures live.

Although not all people who come to Neverland cease to age, its best-known resident, Peter Pan, famously refused to grow up. Thus, the term is often used as a metaphor for eternal childhood (and childishness), as well as immortality and escapism.

The concept was first introduced as &quot;the Never Never Land&quot; in Barrie&#x27;s West End theatre play &quot;Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn&#x27;t Grow Up&quot;, first staged in 1904. In the earliest drafts of the play, the island was called &quot;Peter&#x27;s Never Never Never Land&quot;, a name possibly influenced by the &#x27;Never Never&#x27;, a contemporary term for outback Australia. In the 1928 published version of the play&#x27;s script, the name was shortened to &quot;the Never Land&quot;. Although the caption to one of F. D. Bedford&#x27;s illustrations also calls it &quot;The Never Never Land&quot;, Barrie&#x27;s 1911 novelisation &quot;Peter and Wendy&quot; simply refers to it as &quot;the Neverland,&quot; and its many variations &quot;the Neverlands.&quot;

Neverland has been featured prominently in subsequent works that either adapted Barrie&#x27;s works or expanded upon them. These Neverlands sometimes vary in nature from the original.

The novel says that the Neverlands are compact enough that adventures are never far between, and that a map of a child&#x27;s mind would resemble a map of Neverland, with no boundaries at all. Accordingly, Barrie explains that the Neverlands are found in the minds of children; although each is &quot;always more or less an island&quot; as well as having a family resemblance, they are not the same from one child to the next. For example, John Darling&#x27;s Neverland had &quot;a lagoon with flamingos flying over it,&quot; while his little brother Michael&#x27;s had &quot;a flamingo with lagoons flying over it.&quot;

The exact situation of Neverland is ambiguous and vague. In Barrie&#x27;s original tale, the name for the real world is the Mainland, which suggests Neverland is a small island, reached by flight. Peter—who is described as saying &quot;anything that came into his head&quot;—tells Wendy the way to Neverland is &quot;second to the right, and straight on till morning.&quot; In the novel, the children are said to have found the island only because it was &quot;out looking for them.&quot; Barrie additionally writes that Neverland is near the &quot;stars of the milky way&quot; and it is reached &quot;always at the time of sunrise.&quot;

In Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens&quot; (1906), a proto-version of Neverland, located in the Serpentine in Kensington Gardens, is called the Birds&#x27; Island, where baby Peter reaches by flight, or by sailing in a paper boat or thrush&#x27;s nest.

Walt Disney&#x27;s 1953 &quot;Peter Pan&quot; adds a &quot;star&quot; to Peter&#x27;s directions: &quot;second star to the right, and straight on till morning.&quot; From afar, these stars depict Neverland in the distance. The 2003 live-action film (produced by Universal Pictures, Columbia Pictures, Revolution Studios, Red Wagon Entertainment and Allied Stars Ltd) repeats this representation, as the Darling children are flown through the solar system to reach Neverland. In the 1991 film &quot;Hook&quot; (produced by TriStar Pictures and Amblin Entertainment), Neverland is shown to be located in the same way as the 1953 Disney film. While flying is the only way to reach it, the film does not show exactly how Captain Hook manages to get from Neverland to London in order to kidnap Peter&#x27;s children, Jack and Maggie. In &quot;Peter Pan in Scarlet&quot; (2006), by Geraldine McCaughrean, Neverland is located in waters known as the &#x27;Sea of One Thousand Islands&#x27;. The children get to the island by flying on a road called the High Way.

In Peter David&#x27;s 2009 novel &quot;Tigerheart&quot;, Neverland is renamed the Anyplace and is described as being both a physical place and a dream land where human adults and children go when they dream. Additionally, there is a location called the Noplace which is cold and devoid of colour where people in a coma and those who are &quot;lost&quot; live. In the 2011 miniseries &quot;Neverland&quot;, inspired by Barrie&#x27;s works, the titular place is said to be another planet existing at the centre of the universe. It is accessible only via a magic portal generated by a strange sphere. In the 2015 American film &quot;Pan&quot;, Neverland is a floating island in a sky-like dimension.

=== Time ===
The passage of time in Neverland is similarly ambiguous. The novel &quot;Peter and Wendy&quot; mentions that in Neverland there are many more suns and moons than on the Mainland, making time difficult to track. One way to tell the time is to find the crocodile, and wait until the clock inside it strikes the hour. Although Neverland is widely thought of as a place where children don&#x27;t grow up, Barrie wrote that the Lost Boys eventually do grow up, having to leave, and fairies there lived typically short lifespans. 

In &quot;Peter Pan in Scarlet&quot; (2006), by Geraldine McCaughrean, time freezes as soon as the children arrived in Neverland. In the 2011 miniseries &quot;Neverland&quot;, in which Neverland is said to be another planet entirely, time has frozen due to external cosmic forces converging on the planet, preventing anyone living there from ageing.

==Locations within Neverland==
===Canon===
In J. M. Barrie&#x27;s play and novel, most of the adventures in the stories take place in the Neverwood, where the Lost Boys hunt and fight the pirates and Native Americans.

Peter and the Lost Boys live in the Home Under The Ground, which also contains Tinker Bell&#x27;s &quot;private apartment.&quot; The Home is accessed by sliding down hollowed tree trunks, one for each boy. It consisted of one large room, ... with a floor in which you could dig if you wanted to go fishing, and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming colour, which were used as stools. A Never tree tried hard to grow in the centre of the room, but every morning they sawed the trunk through, level with the floor.&quot; The Little House is built from branches by the Lost Boys for Wendy after she is hit by Tootles&#x27; arrow. At the end of the play, one year after the main events in the story, the house appears in different spots every night, but always on some tree-tops. The Little House is the original &quot;Wendy house,&quot; now the name of a children&#x27;s playhouse.

The Jolly Roger is the pirates&#x27; brig, described by Barrie as &quot;a rakish-looking craft foul to the hull.&quot;

The mermaids live in the Mermaids&#x27; Lagoon, which is also the location of Marooners&#x27; Rock, the most dangerous place in Neverland. Trapped on Marooners&#x27; Rock in the lagoon just offshore, Peter faced impending death by drowning, as he could not swim or fly from it to safety. The mermaids made no attempt to rescue him, but he was saved by the Never bird.

===Non-canon===
In the many film, television, and video game adaptations of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, adventures that originally take place in either the Mermaids&#x27; Lagoon, the Neverwood forest, or on the pirates&#x27; ship are played out in a greater number of more elaborate locations.

==== Disney ====
In the Disney-franchise version of Neverland, many non-canon locales are added which appear variously throughout different instalments, as well as adding or giving names to implied locations within Barrie&#x27;s original Neverland. These locales include:

* Cannibal Cove/Tiki Forest – A jungle environment, original to the Disney franchise, filled with monkeys, parrots, boars, cobras, bees and a &quot;host of evil traps.&quot; It is occupied by a tribe reminiscent of both African and indigenous Pacific-Islander cultures. This location appears regularly in Disney Channel&#x27;s animated series &quot;Jake and the Neverland Pirates&quot;
* The Neverseas are the seas around Neverland in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Tinker Bell&quot; films. Some small islands can be found in it, and it seems that it can communicate with the real seas, as a normal ship comes across the path of a young James Hook in &quot;The Pirate Fairy&quot;
* Pixie Hollow is where Tinker Bell and her tiny fairy friends live and dwell in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Tinker Bell&quot; franchise. (See Pixie Hollow)
* Never Land Plains – A location where the Indians reside
* Skull Rock – A location where the &quot;pirates are said to hide their booty.&quot;
* Crocodile Creek – A swamp environment where the Crocodile lives

==== &quot;Hook&quot; (1991) ====
In Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;Hook&quot;, the pirates occupy a small port town peppered with merchant shopfronts, warehouses, hotels, pubs, and an improvised baseball field, and many ships and boats of varying sizes and kinds fill the harbour. The Home Underground has also been replaced by an intricate tree house structure, which is home to a larger number of Lost Boys. In certain areas, the territory surrounding the tree house has its own unique weather (i.e; spring, summer, autumn, winter).

The Mermaids&#x27; Lagoon is directly connected to the Lost Boys&#x27; tree house structure by a giant clam-shell pulley system. The Home Underground is discovered buried and forgotten by an adult Peter in the film, underneath the new home of the Lost Boys. Neither the Indians nor their territory appear in the film, though they are mentioned by Hook during a conversation with Smee.

==== Other ====
The Black Castle, which is referred to in the 2003 film, is an old ruined and abandoned castle, decorated with stone dragons and gargoyles. It is one of the places where Tiger Lily is taken by Captain James Hook. This sequence is based on the Marooner&#x27;s Rock sequence in the original play and book: like Disney&#x27;s non-canon &#x27;Skull Rock&#x27;, Black Castle replaces Marooners&#x27;s Rock in this film.

Neverpeak Mountain is the huge mountain that is right in the middle of Neverland. According to &quot;Peter Pan in Scarlet&quot;, when a child is on top of Neverpeak Mountain, he or she can see over anyone and anything and can see beyond belief.

The Maze of Regrets is a maze in &quot;Peter Pan in Scarlet&quot; where all the mothers of the Lost Boys go to find their boys.

==Inhabitants==

===Fairies===

Fairies are arguably the most important magical inhabitants of the Neverland, and its primary magic users. A property of their nature is the production and possession of fairy dust, the magic material which enables flying for all characters except Peter, who was taught to fly by the birds, and later by the fairies in Kensington Gardens. The only-named fairy is Tinker Bell, Peter Pan&#x27;s companion, whose name alludes to her profession as a &#x27;tinker&#x27;, or fixer of pots and pans. Tinker Bell is essentially a household fairy, but far from benign. Her exotic, fiery nature, and capacity for evil and mischief, due to fairies being too small to feel more than one type of emotion at any one time, is reminiscent of the more hostile fairies encountered by Peter in Kensington Gardens.

In Barrie&#x27;s play and novel, the roles of fairies are brief: they are allies to the Lost Boys against the pirates, the source of fairy dust and where they act as &quot;guides&quot; for parties travelling to and from Neverland. They are also responsible for the collection of abandoned or lost babies from the Mainland to the Neverland. The roles and activities of the fairies are more elaborate in &quot;Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens&quot; (1906): they occupy kingdoms in the Gardens and at night &quot;mischief children who are locked in after dark&quot; to their deaths or entertain them before they return to their parents the following day; and they guard the paths to a &quot;Proto-Neverland&quot; called the birds&#x27; island. These fairies are more regal and engage in a variety of human activities in a magical fashion. They have courts; can grant wishes to children; and have a practical relationship with the birds, which is however &quot;strained by differences.&quot; They are portrayed as dangerous, whimsical and extremely clever, but quite hedonistic. After forgetting how to fly, unable to be taught by the birds, Peter is given the power to fly again by the fairies.

Barrie writes that &quot;when the first baby laughed for the first time, its laugh broke into a thousand pieces, ... and that was the beginning of fairies.&quot; Neverland&#x27;s fairies can be killed whenever someone says they don&#x27;t believe in fairies, suggesting that the race of fairies is finite and exhaustible. When dying from Hook&#x27;s poison, Tinker Bell is saved when Peter and other children and adults across the Neverlands and Mainland call out &quot;I do believe in fairies, I do, I do,&quot; so their deaths are not necessarily permanent. At the end of Barrie&#x27;s novel Wendy asks Peter about Tinker Bell, whom he has forgotten and he answers, &quot;I expect she is no more.&quot;

The &quot;Disney Fairies&quot;–&quot;Peter Pan&quot; franchise has elaborated on aspects of Barrie&#x27;s fairy mythology. The Never Fairies (and associated sparrow men) live in Pixie Hollow, located in the heart of Neverland. As stated in the &quot;Tinker Bell&quot; film, after the baby&#x27;s first laugh enters a flower, it breaks the flower into numerous pieces (the seeds), any piece that can blow with the wind and survive the trip to Pixie Hollow becomes a fairy, who then learns his/her specific talent.

===Birds===
In the novel and the play, between the flight from the Mainland (reality) and the Neverland, they are relatively simple animals which provide entertainment, instruction and some limited guidance to flyers. These birds are described as unable to sight its shores, &quot;even, carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners.&quot;

The Never Bird saves Peter from drowning when he is stranded on Marooners&#x27; Rock, by giving him her nest which he uses as a sailing vessel.

In Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens&quot;, birds have a far more prominent role on a proto-Neverland called the Birds&#x27; Island. On the island, the various birds speak bird-language, described as being related to fairy language which can be understood by young humans, who used to be birds. The birds are responsible for bringing human babies into the Mainland, whose human parents send folded paper boats along the serpentine &quot;with &#x27;boy&#x27; or &#x27;girl&#x27; and &#x27;thin&#x27; or &#x27;fat&#x27; (and so on) written&quot;, indicating to the official birds which species to send back to transform into human children, who are described as having an &quot;itch on their backs where their wings used to be&quot; and that their warbles are fairy/bird talk.

===Lost Boys===

The Lost Boys are a tribe of &quot;children who fall out of their prams when the nurse is not looking;&quot; having not been claimed by humans in seven days, they were collected by the fairies and flown to the Neverland. There are no &#x27;lost girls&#x27; because, as Peter explains, girls are much too clever to fall out of their prams and be lost in this manner.

There are six Lost Boys: Tootles, Nibs, Slightly, Curly and the Twins. They are not permitted to fly by Peter, as it is a sign of his authority and uniqueness. They live in tree houses and caves, wear animal skins, have spears and bows and arrows, and live for adventure. They are a formidable fighting force despite their youth and they make war with the pirates, although they seem to enjoy a harmonious existence with the other inhabitants of Neverland.

===Pirates===
The crew of the Pirate ship &quot;Jolly Roger&quot; have taken up residence off-shore, and are widely feared throughout Neverland. How they came to be in Neverland is unclear. Their captain is the ruthless James Hook, named after the hook in place of his right hand.

===&quot;Redskins&quot;===
There is a tribe of wigwam-dwelling Native Americans who live on the island, referred to by Barrie as &quot;Redskins&quot; or as the Piccaninny tribe. Their chief is Great Big Little Panther, whose daughter Tiger Lily has a crush on Peter Pan. The Piccaninny tribe are known to make ferocious and deadly war against Captain Hook and his pirates, but their connection with the Lost Boys is more lighthearted. For &quot;many moons&quot;, the two groups have captured each other, only to promptly release the captives, as though it were a game.

===Mermaids===
Mermaids live in the lagoon. They enjoy the company of Peter Pan but keep their distance from everyone else on the island, including the fairies. They are not sociable creatures and do not speak nor interact with outsiders. They are malevolent, hedonistic and frivolous; yet they sing and play &quot;mermaid games&quot; in which they &quot;rise to the surface in extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles,&quot; &quot;made in rainbow water.&quot; They also &quot;love to bask out on Marooners&#x27; Rock, combing their hair in a lazy way.&quot;

At first glance, Wendy is enchanted by their beauty, but finds them vain and irritating, as they would &quot;splash her with their tails, not accidentally, but intentionally&quot; when she attempted to steal a closer look. Their homes are &quot;coral caves underneath the waves&quot; to which they retire at sunset and rising tide, as well as in anticipation of storms. When one mermaid tries to pull Wendy into the water and drown her, Peter intervenes and hissesrather than crowsat them and they quickly dive into the water and disappear. Barrie describes the mermaids&#x27; &quot;haunting&quot; transformation at the &quot;turn of the moon&quot; while &quot;uttering strange wailing cries&quot; at night as the lagoon becomes a very &quot;dangerous place for mortals&quot;. The Mermaids&#x27; Lagoon is a favourite &quot;adventure&quot; for the children, and where they take their &quot;midday meal&quot;. Peter gives Wendy one of the mermaids&#x27; combs as a gift.

The 2003 &quot;Peter Pan&quot; film briefly describes mermaids as different from those in traditional story books, but as &quot;dark creatures in touch with all things mysterious,&quot; and who will drown humans who get too close, but do not harm Peter who seems to be the only one who can speak the mermaids&#x27; language. They always seem to know Hook&#x27;s whereabouts on the island at any given time and tell Peter.

===Animals===
Animals (referred to as beasts) live throughout Neverland, such as bears, tigers, lions, wolves, flamingoes and crocodiles. In Barrie&#x27;s original novel, these &quot;beasts&quot; hunt the Piccaninny tribe, who hunt the Pirates, who are themselves hunting the Lost Boys, who in turn hunt the beasts, creating a chain of prey and murder in the Neverland that only ends when one party stops or slows down, or when Peter redirects the Lost Boys to other tasks and activities. Like all the agencies of the Neverland, the animals do not need to eat, nor are they eaten when killed, nor do they reproduce (as they enjoy the same immortality as all other inhabitants), so their presence is a paradox. There are also a variety of birds, whose societies are present in the proto-Neverland described in Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens&quot;.

===Other residents===
Other inhabitants of Neverland are suggested by Barrie in his original novel, such as a &quot;small old lady with a hooked nose&quot;, &quot;gnomes who are mostly tailors&quot;, and princes &quot;with six elder brothers&quot;reminiscent of European fairy tales. Some locations are briefly described without inhabitants, but the narrator hints at their former presence, such as a &quot;hut fast going to decay&quot;.

In a Japanese anime series, &quot;The Adventures of Peter Pan&quot; (1989), the individual characters of the pirates, &quot;redskins&quot;, and mermaids are expanded, and new characters such as the schizophrenic spellcaster princess Luna and the witch Sinistra are added.

<doc id="163857" wikidata="Q157605" url="?curid=163857" title="Livonian Brothers of the Sword">
<text>The Livonian Brothers of the Sword (, ) was a Catholic military order established in 1202 during the Livonian Crusade by Albert, the third bishop of Riga (or possibly by Theoderich von Treydend). Pope Innocent III sanctioned the establishment in 1204 for the second time. The membership of the crusading order comprised warrior monks, mostly from northern Germany, who fought Baltic and Finnic pagans in the area of modern-day Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Alternative names of the Order include Christ Knights, Swordbrothers, Sword Brethren, Order of the Brothers of the Sword, and The Militia of Christ of Livonia. The seal reads: &quot;+MAGISTRI ETFRM (et fratrum) MILICIE CRI (Christi) DE LIVONIA&quot;.

Following their defeat by the Samogitians and Semigallians in the Battle of Saule in 1236, the surviving Brothers merged into the Teutonic Order as an autonomous branch and became known as the Livonian Order.

== Organization ==
The Baltic German Livonian Brothers had a set of rules adopted from the Knights Templar, requiring them to be of noble birth and to take vows of obedience, poverty, and celibacy. The order also included soldiers, artisans, and clerics as members. The Knights made up a general assembly, which selected a grand master and other officials.

The grandmaster served for life in the order. He chose a council and a military chief for each district castle, where the order&#x27;s knights were living. Wenno von Rohrbach was the first master of the order (1204–1209), followed by Volkwin Schenk von Winterstein, who died in the Battle of Schaulen in 1236.

In the beginning, the main duty of the Livonian Brothers was to protect priests and missionaries. The characteristics of the territory brought a moral challenge for the crusaders because the land of the Livs and Letts had not previously been Christian. Therefore, they did not have any justification to attack them. The division of conquered territory also was a problem faced by the order. Swordbrothers were to garrison the built castles to maintain control along the Daugava. However, garrison duties did not imply ownership. Albert of Riga established that one-third of any new territory could be retained by the order. Meanwhile, the rest of the territory was handed over to the bishop.

== History ==
=== Foundation ===
Albert, Bishop of Riga (also called Prince-Bishop of Livonia) (or possibly Theoderich von Treyden) realised that a standing army in Livonia would be more useful than crusaders staying a short time. As rewards for secular knights in the Baltic area were not enough to ensure their long-term stance, Albert founded the Brotherhood in 1202 to aid the Bishopric of Livonia in the conversion of the pagan Livonians, Latgalians and Selonians living across the ancient trade routes from the Gulf of Riga eastwards.

The Brotherhood had its headquarters at Fellin (Viljandi) in present-day Estonia, where the walls of the Master&#x27;s castle stand. Other strongholds included Wenden (Cēsis), Segewold (Sigulda) and Ascheraden (Aizkraukle). The commanders of Fellin, Goldingen (Kuldīga), Marienburg (Alūksne), Reval (Tallinn), and the bailiff of Weißenstein (Paide) belonged to the five-member entourage of the Order&#x27;s Master.

=== Battles ===
In 1205, the first battle of the Livonian brothers occurred. The Semigallian duke Viesthard visited Riga to request the help of the Swordbrothers after a local Semigallian tribe was devastated by the Lithuanians. The brotherhood was reluctant to go to war due to the absence of bishop Albert. However, Viesthard successfully persuaded the Swordbrothers. They prepared an ambush against the Lithuanians that were returning with the booty, where the Lithuanian leader was beheaded.

In 1206, the Duke Vladimir of Polozk demanded tribute from the inhabitants of the Daugava when the terms of service of the crusaders expired. The Swordbrothers, with the help of the remaining crusaders, beat the Russian troops that arrived suddenly to Daugava.

In 1207, the Swordbrothers faced an attack from Lithuania launched during the winter. The Swordbrothers and allies stayed at the castle of Lennewarden on the north of the Daugava. The Lithuanian army challenged the order to battle and was defeated by the Order. This victory served to show the value of the castle line along the river. The chain of castles allowed successful communication. Meanwhile, the local militia could assemble at the nearest fort to the raiders&#x27; return route and attack them.

The Swordbrothers had superiority in heavy cavalry. For that reason, natives tried to avoid pitched battles during the Livonian crusade. Most of the confrontations consisted of raids. The Order built a fortified line along the Daugava that created a peaceful time in the region. Livonian people began to consider the Swordbrothers as efficient protectors. Despite that, some native leaders felt that the Order represented a challenge to their authority, as the case of King Vetseke, the original owner of the fortress of Koknese. King Vetseke massacred German workers who were rebuilding the fortress. He was punished after that.

In 1211, several threats around Livonian prompted Albert of Riga to reinforce the defences. For safeguarding the northern flank, Albert organised an invasion of southern Estonia. The Swordbrothers were the core of the crusader army, allied with Russians, loyal Livs and Letts, and led by Engelbert von Thisenhusen, brother-in-law of Albert of Riga. After a siege, they took Fellin and negotiated a settlement with the condition that pagans accept baptism. The following year the order destroyed the Saccalian resistance in a battle where 2,000 Saccalians fell.

Between 1211 and 1212, the Swordbrothers realised that winter was the best season for warfare due to frozen swamps, weak undergrowth, and difficulty of their enemies to cover their tracks. Also, the knights could use frozen rivers as high-speed paths. The Order used these advantages in their campaigns until 1218, when they conquered southern Estonia, meanwhile they beat off counter-attacks from Russians and Lithuanians.

In 1230, Kurland was conquered and converted by the order.

=== Indiscipline ===
From its foundation, the indisciplined Order tended to ignore its supposed vassalage to the bishops. The desires of the Swordbrothers to expand to the north of the Daugava river, along the Livonian Aa stream, brought the Order into a confrontation with Bishop Albert. Albert wanted to extend to the south of the river and did not have an interest in Estonia, previously promised to King Valdemar II of Denmark.

Master Wenno advanced to the north without the permission of Bishop Albert. First, the Order took and occupied the fortress of Treiden. In 1208, they founded the castle of Segewold in the Aa valley, and the castle of Wenden further upstream. The last one grew as a fortress and Master Wenno located the Headquarters of the Order there. Wickbert, a man loyal to Albert of Riga, was placed to manage the Wenden castle. Master Wenno removed him, but Wickbert fled to the protection of Albert of Riga and killed Wenno with an axe.

In 1219, King Valdemar II of Denmark conquered the north of Estonia with the help of Bishop Albert. In 1222, Estonia was partitioned between Valdemar II and Albert of Riga in an agreement unsatisfactory to the Swordbrothers. After that, they exploited the peasants until a revolt arose. The Pope rebuked the Order for the way they managed the conflict. Then, they tried to seize Danish land in Estonia until a papal legate made them give it back. When the papal legate left, the Swordbrothers took the Danish land again. They also invaded the territory of Bishop Albert and levied tolls on traffic on the Daugava.

After the death of Albert of Riga in 1229, ecclesiastical authorities considered that the Order was no longer useful. The papal legate Bernard of Aulne decided that they should be suppressed, and he tried to recapture the Danish Castle at Reval. However, the Order defeated him and took him as a prisoner.

Pope Gregory IX asked the Brothers to defend Finland from the Novgorodian attacks in his letter of November 24, 1232. However, no known information regarding the knights&#x27; possible activities in Finland has survived. (Sweden eventually conquered Finland following the Second Swedish Crusade in 1249.)

=== Incorporation into the Teutonic Knights ===
The Order was decimated in the Battle of Schaulen (Saule) in 1236 against Lithuanians and Semigallians. This disaster led the surviving Brothers to become incorporated into the Order of Teutonic Knights in the following year, and from that point on they became known as the Livonian Order. They continued to function in all respects (rule, clothing and policy) as an autonomous branch of the Teutonic Order, headed by their own Master (himself &quot;de jure&quot; subject to the Teutonic Order&#x27;s Grand Master).

<text>, formerly New Komeito (NKP) and commonly referred to as simply Komei, is a political party in Japan founded by the leader of Soka Gakkai, Daisaku Ikeda, in 1964. It is generally considered centrist and socially conservative. Since 2012, it has served in government as the junior coalition partner of the nationalist and conservative governments led by the Liberal Democratic Party. 

Tetsuo Saito has been the president of the party since 9 November 2024. Komeito currently has 24 elected Deputies in the Japanese House of Representatives.

==History==
===Opposition before 1993===
Komeito began as the Political Federation for Clean Government in 1961, but held its inaugural convention as Komeito on 17 November 1964. The three characters 公明党 have the approximate meanings of &quot;public/government&quot; (公 kō), &quot;light/brightness&quot; (明 mei), and &quot;political party&quot; (党 tō). The combination &quot;kōmei&quot; (公明) is usually taken to mean &quot;justice&quot;.
Komeito&#x27;s predecessor party, Kōmeitō, was formed in 1962, but it had begun in 1954 as the Kōmei Political League. It lasted until it merged with the NKP in 1998.

In 1957, a group of Young Men&#x27;s Division members campaigning for a Soka Gakkai candidate in an Osaka Upper House by-election were arrested for distributing money, cigarettes, and caramels at supporters&#x27; residences, in violation of election law, and on July 3 of that year, at the beginning of an event memorialized as the &quot;Osaka Incident,&quot; Daisaku Ikeda was arrested in Osaka. He was taken into custody in his capacity as Soka Gakkai&#x27;s Youth Division Chief of Staff for overseeing activities that constituted violations of election law. He spent two weeks in jail and appeared in court forty-eight times before he was cleared of all charges in January 1962.

In 1968, fourteen of its members were convicted of forging absentee ballots in Shinjuku, and eight were sentenced to prison for electoral fraud. In the 1960s it was widely criticized for violating the separation of church and state, and in February 1970 all three major Japanese newspapers printed editorials demanding that the party reorganize. It eventually broke apart based on promises to segregate from Soka Gakkai.

In the 1980s, &quot;Shimbun Akahata&quot; discovered that many Soka Gakkai members were rewarding acquaintances with presents in return for Komeito votes and that Okinawa residents had changed their addresses to elect Komeito politicians.

Kōmeitō joined the Hosokawa and Hata anti-LDP coalition cabinets in 1993 and 1994. After the collapse of the anti-LDP and anti-JCP governments () and the electoral and campaign finance reforms of 1994, the Kōmeitō split in December 1994: The joined the New Frontier Party (NFP) a few days later in an attempt to unify the splintered opposition. The other group, , continued to exist as a separate party. After the dissolution of the NFP in December 1997, former Kōmeitō members from the NFP founded two new groups: the and the in the House of Councillors, but some ex-Kōmeitō politicians such as Shōzō Azuma followed Ichirō Ozawa into the Liberal Party. The Reimei Club merged into the New Peace Party a few weeks later in January 1998. Finally, in November 1998, Kōmei and New Peace Party merged to re-establish Kōmeitō (referred to in English now as &quot;New Komeito&quot; – the party&#x27;s name is just &quot;Kōmeitō&quot; as before the 1994 split).

The &quot;Japan Echo&quot; alleged in 1999 that Soka Gakkai distributed fliers to local branches describing how to abuse the &quot;jūminhyō&quot; residence registration system in order to generate a large number of votes for Komeito candidates in specific districts.

===Coalition with the Liberal Democratic Party: 1999–2009, 2012–present===

The current conservative, more moderate, and centrist party was formed in 1998, in a merger of Kōmei and the New Peace Party. Since then it has joined coalition with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which needs Komeito to maintain a majority in the Diet (especially in the House of Councillors which the LDP lost majority since 1989), and did well in the 2000 and 2001 parliamentary elections.

The LDP-Liberal coalition expanded to include the New Komeito Party in October 1999. New Komeito has been (and continues to be) a coalition partner in the Government of Japan since 1999 (excluding 2009–2011 when the Democratic Party of Japan was in power). As such, New Komeito supported a (temporary) change to Japan&#x27;s &quot;no-war constitution&quot; in order for Japan to deploy troops in support of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

In the 2003 Japanese general election and 2004 Japanese House of Councillors election, the NKP did well, thanks to an extremely committed and well-organized voter base coming from Soka Gakkai. The party shares its support base with the LDP, made up of white-collar bureaucrats and rural populations, but also gained support from religious leaders. However, on 27 July 2005, NKP&#x27;s Secretary-General said that his party would consider forming a coalition government with the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) if the DPJ gained a majority in the House of Representatives. On 8 August 2005, then-Prime Minister and the president of LDP Junichiro Koizumi dissolved the Lower House and called for a general election, due to the rejection on some of the members of LDP for efforts to privatize Japan Post. The incumbent LDP-New Komeito coalition won a large majority in the 2005 general election.

Natsuo Yamaguchi became the party&#x27;s leader on 8 September 2009 after the party and their coalition partner LDP suffered a major defeat in the 2009 general election, become part of the opposition for the first time since 1999. New Komeito lost ten seats, including that of party leader Akihiro Ota and general secretary Kazuo Kitagawa. On 8 September 2009, Yamaguchi replaced Ota as president of New Komeito.

In the general election on 16 December 2012, the LDP/Komeito coalition secured a supermajority and came back into government. The former party chief Akihiro Ota (Ohta) is currently Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. The party also gained seats in the general election in 2014. In September 2014 the party changed its English name from New Komeito back to Komeito.

In July 2015, Komeito backed Prime Minister Shinzō Abe&#x27;s push to revise the Constitution in order to &quot;give Japan&#x27;s military limited powers to fight in foreign conflicts for the first time since World War II&quot;. This legislation, supported by the United States, would allow the &quot;Self-Defense Forces to cooperate more closely with the U.S. by providing logistical support and, in certain circumstances, armed backup in international conflicts&quot; and &quot;complements guidelines in a bilateral agreement governing how Japanese and United States forces work together, which was signed by the two nations&quot; earlier in 2015.

On March 11, 2019, a project team of Komeito submitted proposals to Foreign Minister Taro Kono for an international agreement to regulate robotic weapons, calling on Japan to build global consensus for a &quot;political declaration or a code of conduct, within the framework of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons&quot;.

==Ideology and policies==
A self-proclaimed party of &quot;humanitarian socialism,&quot; Komeito&#x27;s declared mission is to pioneer &quot;people-centered politics, a politics based on a humanitarianism, that treats human life with the utmost respect and care&quot;. On 24 April 2019, joint task force efforts with its coalition partner resulted in the passing of a bill mandating reparations and having the coalition government issue a formal apology to sterilization victims of the defunct Eugenic Protection Act, thus to advance human rights awareness in the wake of lawsuits related to the history of eugenics in Japan.

Religious scholar and political analyst Masaru Satō explains that in postwar Japan there were two major parties, the Liberal Democratic Party representing financial interests and large corporations and the Japan Socialist Party largely advocating the interests of trade unions and the working class. There was no single party that represented people who belonged to neither, such as shop owners and housewives, among others. Komeito was thus able to capture the support of this constituency.

Despite the party&#x27;s conservative ideology, it supports the protection and expansion of LGBT rights.

===Relationship with &quot;Soka Gakkai&quot;===
Komeito regards the Soka Gakkai as a &quot;major electoral constituency&quot;, having formally separated from the religious group and revised both its platform and regulations in 1970 to reflect a &quot;secular orientation&quot;. Observers continue to describe Komeito as the Soka Gakkai&#x27;s &quot;political arm&quot;, however, and critics contend the relationship violates the separation of religion and politics enshrined in Article 20 of the Japanese Constitution. The leadership and financing of the two groups are currently said to be independent. Both groups report having occasional liaison meetings, characterizing them as informational and &quot;open to the media&quot;. Numerous Japanese religious groups have established political parties in Japan, but statistics scholar Petter Lindgren states that &quot;None have, however, been more successful than Soka Gakkai.&quot;

=== Domestic policy ===
Domestically, the party proposals include reduction of the central government and bureaucracy, increased transparency in public affairs, and increased local (prefectural) autonomy with the private sector playing an increased role. Komeito also supports reducing the consumption tax rate, reducing school fees and offering child allowances.

In accordance with its public affairs transparency platform, it was reported that since September 2016, the Komeito conducted independent analyses for possible environmental contamination of the proposed Toyosu market site. The Komeito officially raised its environmental concerns later regarding Toyosu market during the 5 October 2016 Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly Session. In response, the newly appointed Tokyo Governor, Yuriko Koike, cited possible disciplinary action towards those responsible for the Toyosu project.

=== Security policy ===
In contrast with the LDP, Komeito has generally been more cautious about efforts to expand the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF). At its founding, the party adhered to absolute pacifism, rejecting both the constitutionality of the JSDF and the military alliance with the US. Softening its views later, Komeito backed LDP proposals, such as a 2004 vote to dispatch the JSDF to support allied operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and prime minister Shinzo Abe&#x27;s revision of the security laws to expand military powers in July 2015, although it did manage to moderate the policy on the latter.

=== Foreign policy ===
With regard to foreign policy, the Komeito wishes to eliminate nuclear arms and Japanese involvement in armed conflict in general. Komeito supports maintaining the Japan&#x27;s military alliance with the United States.

The party promotes closer relations between China and Japan. According to a &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; article in 2021, &quot;Of all parties in the Diet, Komeito enjoys the strongest and most stable relationship with China.&quot; Komeito&#x27;s then leader Yoshikatsu Takeiri&#x27;s held negotiations Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in the 1970s played a critical role in the eventual normalization of relations between the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Japan in 1972. The party has advocated for friendlier policies towards China, and has maintained communications with the country even during moments when the relationships between the two countries have been strained.

The party reportedly advocates for improved ties with China and South Korea in light of Japan&#x27;s historical war crimes in both territories. In 2013, the party&#x27;s chief representative Natsuo Yamaguchi praised Prime Minister Shinzo Abe&#x27;s decision not to visit Yasukuni Shrine, where Japanese war criminals are enshrined. On the comfort women issue, in 2016 the party reportedly advocated for removing Yoshitaka Sakurada from a leadership position after Sakurada denied that the women were forced to work.

===Party organ===
The party organ of Komeito is the &quot;Komei Shinbun&quot;. It is published by the Komei Organ Paper Committee, and has also published a regional Hokkaido edition in the past.

<doc id="163873" wikidata="Q38890985" url="?curid=163873" title="English numerals">
<text>English number words include numerals and various words derived from them, as well as a large number of words borrowed from other languages.

==Cardinal numbers==

Cardinal numbers refer to the size of a group. In English, these words are numerals.

If a number is in the range 21 to 99, and the second digit is not zero, the number is typically written as two words separated by a hyphen.
In English, the hundreds are perfectly regular, except that the word &quot;hundred&quot; remains in its singular form regardless of the number preceding it.
So too are the thousands, with the number of thousands followed by the word &quot;thousand&quot;. The number one thousand may be written 1 000 or 1000 or 1,000; larger numbers are written for example 10 000 or 10,000 for ease of reading. European languages that use the comma as a decimal separator may correspondingly use the period as a thousands separator. As a result, some style guides recommend avoidance of the comma (,) as either separator and the use of the period (.) only as a decimal point. Thus one-half would be written 0.5 in decimal, base ten notation, and fifty thousand as 50 000, and not 50.000 nor 50,000 nor 50000.

In American usage, four-digit numbers are often named using multiples of &quot;hundred&quot; and combined with tens and ones: &quot;eleven hundred three&quot;, &quot;twelve hundred twenty-five&quot;, &quot;forty-seven hundred forty-two&quot;, or &quot;ninety-nine hundred ninety-nine&quot;. In British usage, this style is common for multiples of 100 between 1,000 and 2,000 (e.g. 1,500 as &quot;fifteen hundred&quot;) but not for higher numbers.

Americans may pronounce four-digit numbers with non-zero tens and ones as pairs of two-digit numbers without saying &quot;hundred&quot; and inserting &quot;oh&quot; for zero tens: &quot;twenty-six fifty-nine&quot; or &quot;forty-one oh five&quot;. This usage probably evolved from the distinctive usage for years; &quot;nineteen-eighty-one&quot;, or from four-digit numbers used in the American telephone numbering system which were originally two letters followed by a number followed by a four-digit number, later by a three-digit number followed by the four-digit number. It is avoided for numbers less than 2500 if the context may mean confusion with time of day: &quot;ten ten&quot; or &quot;twelve oh four&quot;.

Intermediate numbers are read differently depending on their use. Their typical naming occurs when the numbers are used for counting. Another way is for when they are used as labels. The second column method is used much more often in American English than British English. The third column is used in British English but rarely in American English (although the use of the second and third columns is not necessarily directly interchangeable between the two regional variants). In other words, British English and American English can seemingly agree, but it depends on a specific situation (in this example, bus numbers).
Note: When a cheque (or &quot;check&quot;) is written, the number 100 is always written &quot;one hundred&quot;. It is never &quot;a hundred&quot;.

In American English, many students are taught not to use the word &quot;and&quot; anywhere in the whole part of a number, so it is not used before the tens and ones. It is instead used as a verbal delimiter when dealing with compound numbers. Thus, instead of &quot;three hundred and seventy-three&quot;, &quot;three hundred seventy-three&quot; would be said. Despite this rule, some Americans use the &quot;and&quot; in reading numbers containing tens and ones as an alternative.

===Very large numbers===
For numbers above a million, there are three main systems used to form numbers in English. (For the use of prefixes such as kilo- for a thousand, mega- for a million, milli- for a thousandth, etc. see SI units.) These are:
*the long scale — designates a system of numeric names formerly used in British English, but now obsolete, in which a &quot;billion&quot; is used for a million million (and similarly, with trillion, quadrillion etc., the prefix denoting the power of a million); and a thousand million is sometimes called a &quot;milliard&quot;. This system is still used in several other European languages. There is some favour for this scale in astronomy, due to the issue of the vastness of the Universe.
*the short scale — always used in American English and almost always in British English since the politically-ordained formal adoption of this scale in the 1970s — designates a system of numeric names in which a thousand million is called a &quot;billion&quot;, and the word &quot;milliard&quot; is not used.
*the Indian numbering system, used widely across Indian subcontinent.

Many people have no direct experience of manipulating numbers this large, and many non-American readers may interpret &quot;billion&quot; as 1012 (even if they are young enough to have been taught otherwise at school); moreover, usage of the &quot;long&quot; billion is standard in some non-English-speaking countries. For these reasons, defining the word may be advisable when writing for the public.

The numbers past one trillion in the short scale, in ascending powers of 1000, are as follows: quadrillion, quintillion, sextillion, septillion, octillion, nonillion, decillion, undecillion, duodecillion, tredecillion, quattuordecillion, quindecillion, sexdecillion, septendecillion, octodecillion, novemdecillion and vigintillion (which is 10 to the 63rd power, or a one followed by 63 zeros). The highest number in this series listed in modern dictionaries is centillion, which is 10 to the 303rd power. The interim powers of one thousand between vigintillion and centillion do not have standardized names, nor do any higher powers, but there are many extensions in use. The highest number listed in Robert Munafo&#x27;s table of such unofficial names is milli-millillion, which was coined as a name for 10 to the 3,000,003rd power.

The googolplex was often cited as the largest named number in English. If a googol is ten to the one hundredth power, then a googolplex is one followed by a googol of zeros (that is, ten to the power of a googol). There is the coinage, of very little use, of ten to the googolplex power, of the word .

The terms &quot;arab&quot;, &quot;kharab&quot;, &quot;padm&quot; and &quot;shankh&quot; are more commonly found in old books on Indian mathematics.

Here are some approximate composite large numbers in American English:
Often, large numbers are written with (preferably non-breaking) half-spaces or thin spaces separating the thousands (and, sometimes, with normal spaces or apostrophes) instead of commas—to ensure that confusion is not caused in countries where a decimal comma is used. Thus, a million is often written 1 000 000. In some areas, a point (. or ·) may also be used as a thousands separator, but then the decimal separator must be a comma (,). In English the point (.) is used as the decimal separator, and the comma (,) as the thousands separator.

==Special names==

Some numbers have special names in addition to their regular names, most depending on context.

* 0:
**&quot;zero:&quot; formal scientific usage
** &quot;nought:&quot; mostly British usage, common in science to refer to subscript 0 indicating an initial state
**&quot;naught&quot;: archaic term for nothingness, which may or may not be equivalent to the number; mostly American usage, old-fashioned spelling of &quot;nought&quot;
**&quot;aught:&quot; proscribed but still occasionally used when a digit is 0 (as in &quot;thirty-aught-six&quot;, the .30-06 Springfield rifle cartridge and by association guns that fire it). Aughts also refers to the decade of 2000–2009 in American English. 
**&quot;oh:&quot; used when spelling numbers (like telephone, bank account, bus line [British: bus route]) but can cause confusion with the letter o if reading a mix of numbers and letters
**&quot;nil:&quot; in general sport scores, British usage (&quot;The score is two–nil.&quot;)
**&quot;nothing:&quot; in general sport scores, American usage (&quot;The score is two–nothing.&quot;)

Combinations of numbers in most sports scores are read as in the following examples:
* 1–0    British English: &quot;one-nil&quot;; American English: &quot;one-nothing&quot;, &quot;one-zip&quot;, or &quot;one-zero&quot;
* 0–0    British English: &quot;nil-nil&quot; or &quot;nil all&quot;; American English: &quot;zero-zero&quot; or &quot;nothing-nothing&quot;, (occasionally &quot;scoreless&quot; or &quot;no score&quot;)
* 2–2    &quot;two-two&quot; or &quot;two all&quot;; American English also &quot;twos&quot;, &quot;two to two&quot;, &quot;even at two&quot;, or &quot;two up&quot;.

Naming conventions of Tennis scores (and related sports) are different from other sports.

The centuries of Italian culture have names in English borrowed from Italian: 
* duecento &quot;(one thousand and) two hundred&quot; for the years 1200 to 1299, or approximately 13th century
* trecento 14th century
* quattrocento 15th century
* cinquecento 16th century
* seicento 17th century
* settecento 18th century
* 19th century
* 20th century
* 21st century

When reading numbers in a sequence, such as a telephone or serial number, British people will usually use the terms &quot;double&quot; followed by the repeated number. Hence 007 is &quot;double oh seven&quot;. Exceptions are the emergency telephone number 999, which is always &quot;nine nine nine&quot; and the apocalyptic &quot;Number of the Beast&quot;, which is always &quot;six six six&quot;. In the US, 911 (the US emergency telephone number) is usually read &quot;nine one one&quot;, while 9/11 (in reference to the September 11, 2001, attacks) is usually read &quot;nine eleven&quot;.

== Multiplicative adverbs and adjectives ==

A few numbers have specialised multiplicative numbers (adverbs), also called adverbial numbers, which express how many times some event happens:

Compare these specialist multiplicative numbers to express how many times some thing exists (adjectives):

English also has some multipliers and distributive numbers, such as &quot;singly&quot;.

==Negative numbers==
The name of a negative number is the name of the corresponding positive number preceded by &quot;minus&quot; or (American English) &quot;negative&quot;. Thus −5.2 is &quot;minus five point two&quot; or &quot;negative five point two&quot;. For temperatures, North Americans colloquially say &quot;below&quot;—short for &quot;below zero&quot;—so a temperature of −5° is &quot;five below&quot; (in contrast, for example, to &quot;two above&quot; for 2°). This is occasionally used for emphasis when referring to several temperatures or ranges both positive and negative. This is particularly common in Canada where the use of Celsius in weather forecasting means that temperatures can regularly drift above and below zero at certain times of year.

==Ordinal numbers==
Ordinal numbers refer to a position (also called index or rank) in a sequence. Common ordinals include:

&quot;Zeroth&quot; only has a meaning when counting starts with zero, which happens in a mathematical or computer science context. Ordinal numbers predate the invention of zero and positional notation.

Ordinal numbers such as 21st, 33rd, etc., are formed by combining a &quot;cardinal&quot; ten with an &quot;ordinal&quot; unit.

Higher ordinals are not often written in words, unless they are round numbers (thousandth, millionth, billionth). They are written with digits and letters as described below. Some rules should be borne in mind.
* The suffixes &quot;-th&quot;, &quot;-st&quot;, &quot;-nd&quot; and &quot;-rd&quot; are occasionally written superscript above the number itself.
* If the tens digit of a number is 1, then &quot;th&quot; is written after the number. For example: 13th, 19th, 112th, 9,311th.
* If the tens digit is &quot;not&quot; equal to 1, then the following table could be used:

*For example: 2nd, 7th, 20th, 23rd, 52nd, 135th, 301st.

These ordinal abbreviations are actually hybrid contractions of a numeral and a word. 1st is &quot;1&quot; + &quot;st&quot; from &quot;first&quot;. Similarly, &quot;nd&quot; is used for &quot;second&quot; and &quot;rd&quot; for &quot;third&quot;. In the legal field and in some older publications, the ordinal abbreviation for &quot;second&quot; and &quot;third&quot; is simply &quot;d&quot;.
*For example: 42d, 33d, 23d.

NB: &quot;D&quot; still often denotes &quot;second&quot; and &quot;third&quot; in the numeric designations of units in the US armed forces, for example, 533d Squadron, and in legal citations for the second and third series of case reporters.

==Dates==

There are a number of ways to read years. The following table offers a list of valid pronunciations and alternate pronunciations for any given year of the Gregorian calendar and Julian calendar.


&quot;Twelve thirty-four&quot; would be the norm on both sides of the Atlantic for the year 1234. The years 2000 to 2009 are most often read as &quot;two thousand&quot;, &quot;two thousand (and) one&quot; and the like by both British and American speakers. For years after 2009, &quot;twenty eleven&quot;, &quot;twenty fourteen&quot;, etc. are more common, even in years earlier than 2009 BC/BCE. Likewise, the years after 1009 (until 1099) are also read in the same manner (e.g. 1015 is either &quot;ten fifteen&quot; or, rarely, &quot;one thousand fifteen&quot;). Some Britons read years within the 1000s to 9000s BC/BCE in the American manner, that is, 1234 BC is read as &quot;twelve (hundred and) thirty-four&quot; BC, while 2400 BC can be read as either &quot;two thousand four hundred&quot; or &quot;twenty four hundred&quot; BC.

== Collective numbers ==
Collective numbers are numbers that refer to a group of a specific size. Words like &quot;pair&quot; and &quot;dozen&quot; are common in English, though most are formally derived from Greek and Latin numerals, as follows:
==Fractions and decimals==

Numbers used to denote the denominator of a fraction are known linguistically as &quot;partitive numerals&quot;. In spoken English, ordinal numerals and partitive numerals are identical with a few exceptions. Thus &quot;fifth&quot; can mean the element between fourth and sixth, or the fraction created by dividing the unit into five pieces. When used as a partitive numeral, these forms can be pluralized: one seventh, two &quot;sevenths&quot;. The sole exceptions to this rule are division by one, two, and sometimes four: &quot;first&quot; and &quot;second&quot; cannot be used for a fraction with a denominator of one or two. Instead, &quot;whole&quot; and &quot;half&quot; (plural &quot;halves&quot;) are used. For a fraction with a denominator of four, either &quot;fourth&quot; or &quot;quarter&quot; may be used.

Here are some common English fractions, or partitive numerals:

Alternatively, and for greater numbers, one may say for &quot;one over two&quot;, for &quot;five over eight&quot;, and so on. This &quot;over&quot; form is also widely used in mathematics.

Fractions together with an integer are read as follows:

* is &quot;one and a half&quot;
* is &quot;six and a quarter&quot;
* is &quot;seven and five eighths&quot;

A space is placed to mark the boundary between the whole number and the fraction part unless superscripts and subscripts are used; for example:

* 9 1/2
* 

Numbers with a decimal point may be read as a cardinal number, then &quot;and&quot;, then another cardinal number followed by an indication of the significance of the second cardinal number (mainly U.S.); or as a cardinal number, followed by &quot;point&quot;, and then by the digits of the fractional part. The indication of significance takes the form of the denominator of the fraction indicating division by the smallest power of ten larger than the second cardinal. This is modified when the first cardinal is zero, in which case neither the zero nor the &quot;and&quot; is pronounced, but the zero is optional in the &quot;point&quot; form of the fraction.

Some American and Canadian schools teach students to pronounce decimaly written fractions (for example, &quot;.5&quot;) as though they were longhand fractions (&quot;five tenths&quot;), such as &quot;thirteen and seven tenths&quot; for 13.7. This formality is often dropped in common speech and is steadily disappearing in instruction in mathematics and science as well as in international American schools. In the U.K., and among most North Americans, 13.7 would be read &quot;thirteen point seven&quot;.

For example:

*0.002 is &quot;point zero zero two&quot;, &quot;point oh oh two&quot;, &quot;nought point zero zero two&quot;, etc.; or &quot;two thousandths&quot; (U.S., occasionally)
*3.1416 is &quot;three point one four one six&quot;
*99.3 is &quot;ninety-nine point three&quot;; or &quot;ninety-nine and three tenths&quot; (U.S., occasionally).

In English the decimal point was originally printed in the center of the line (0·002), but with the advent of the typewriter it was placed at the bottom of the line, so that a single key could be used as a full stop/period and as a decimal point. In many non-English languages a full-stop/period at the bottom of the line is used as a thousands separator with a comma being used as the decimal point.

==Whether or not digits or words are used==

With few exceptions, most grammatical texts rule that the numbers zero to nine inclusive should be &quot;written out&quot; – instead of &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;, one would write &quot;one&quot; and &quot;two&quot;.

:Example: &quot;I have two apples.&quot; (Preferred)
:Example: &quot;I have 2 apples.&quot;

After &quot;nine&quot;, one can head straight back into the 10, 11, 12, etc., although some write out the numbers until &quot;twelve&quot;.
:Example: &quot;I have 28 grapes.&quot; (Preferred)
:Example: &quot;I have twenty-eight grapes.&quot;

Another common usage is to write out any number that can be expressed as one or two words, and use figures otherwise.

:Examples:
::&quot;There are six million dogs.&quot; (Preferred)
::&quot;There are 6,000,000 dogs.&quot;
::&quot;That is one hundred and twenty-five oranges.&quot; (British English)
::&quot;That is one hundred twenty-five oranges.&quot; (US-American English)
::&quot;That is 125 oranges.&quot; (Preferred)

Numbers at the beginning of a sentence should also be written out, or the sentence rephrased.

The above rules are not always followed. In literature, larger numbers might be spelled out. On the other hand, digits might be more commonly used in technical or financial articles, where many figures are discussed. In particular, the two different forms should not be used for figures that serve the same purpose; for example, it is inelegant to write, &quot;Between day twelve and day 15 of the study, the population doubled.&quot;

==Empty numbers==
Colloquial English&#x27;s small vocabulary of empty or indefinite numbers can be employed when there is uncertainty as to the precise number to use, but it is desirable to define a general range: specifically, the terms &quot;umpteen&quot;, &quot;umpty&quot;, and &quot;zillion&quot;. These are derived etymologically from the range affixes:
* &quot;-teen&quot; (designating the range as being between 13 and 19 inclusive)
* &quot;-ty&quot; (designating the range as being between 20 and 90 inclusive)
* &quot;-illion&quot; (designating the range as being above 1,000,000; or, more generally, as being extremely large).

The prefix &quot;ump-&quot; is added to the first two suffixes to produce the empty numbers &quot;umpteen&quot; and &quot;umpty&quot;: derived from the onomatopoeic sound on the telegraph key used by Morse operators. A noticeable absence of an empty number is in the hundreds range.

Usage of empty numbers:
* The word &quot;umpteen&quot; may be used as an adjective, as in &quot;I had to go to umpteen stores to find shoes that fit.&quot; It can also be used to modify a larger number, usually &quot;million&quot;, as in &quot;Umpteen million people watched the show; but they still cancelled it.&quot;
* &quot;Umpty&quot; is not in common usage. It can appear in the form &quot;umpty-one&quot; (paralleling the usage in such numbers as &quot;twenty-one&quot;), as in &quot;There are umpty-one ways to do it wrong.&quot; &quot;Umpty-ump&quot; is also heard, though &quot;ump&quot; is never used by itself.
* The word &quot;zillion&quot; may be used as an adjective, modifying a noun. The noun phrase normally contains the indefinite article &quot;a&quot;, as in &quot;There must be a zillion pages on the World Wide Web.&quot;
* The plural &quot;zillions&quot; designates a number indefinitely larger than &quot;millions&quot; or &quot;billions&quot;. In this case, the construction is parallel to the one for &quot;millions&quot; or &quot;billions&quot;, with the number used as a plural count noun, followed by a prepositional phrase with &quot;of&quot;, as in &quot;There are zillions of grains of sand on the beaches of the world.&quot;
* Empty numbers are sometimes made up, with obvious meaning: &quot;squillions&quot; is obviously an empty, but very large, number; a &quot;squintillionth&quot; would be a very small number.
* Some empty numbers may be modified by actual numbers, such as &quot;four zillion&quot;, and are used for jest, exaggeration, or to relate abstractly to actual numbers.
* Empty numbers are colloquial, and primarily used in oral speech or informal contexts. They are inappropriate in formal or scholarly usage.

<text>Iterative and incremental development is any combination of both iterative design (or iterative method) and incremental build model for development.

Usage of the term began in software development, with a long-standing combination of the two terms &quot;iterative&quot; and &quot;incremental&quot; having been widely suggested for large development efforts. For example, the 1985 DOD-STD-2167
mentions (in section 4.1.2): &quot;During software development, more than one iteration of the software development cycle may be in progress at the same time.&quot; and &quot;This process may be described as an &#x27;evolutionary acquisition&#x27; or &#x27;incremental build&#x27; approach.&quot; In software, the relationship between iterations and increments is determined by the overall software development process.

==Overview==

The basic idea behind this method is to develop a system through repeated cycles (iterative) and in smaller portions at a time (incremental), allowing software developers to take advantage of what was learned during development of earlier parts or versions of the system. Learning comes from both the development and use of the system, where possible key steps in the process start with a simple implementation of a subset of the software requirements and iteratively enhance the evolving versions until the full system is implemented. At each iteration, design modifications are made and new functional capabilities are added.

The procedure itself consists of the initialization step, the iteration step, and the Project Control List. The initialization step creates a base version of the system. The goal for this initial implementation is to create a product to which the user can react. It should offer a sampling of the key aspects of the problem and provide a solution that is simple enough to understand and implement easily. To guide the iteration process, a project control list is created that contains a record of all tasks that need to be performed. It includes items such as new features to be implemented and areas of redesign of the existing solution. The control list is constantly being revised as a result of the analysis phase.

An iteration involves redesign and implementation, which is meant to be simple, straightforward, and modular, supporting redesign at that stage or as a future task added to the project control list. The level of design detail is not dictated by the iterative approach. In a light-weight iterative project the code may represent the major source of documentation of the system; however, in a critical iterative project a formal Software Design Document may be used. The analysis of an iteration is based upon user feedback and the program analysis facilities available. It involves analysis of the structure, modularity, usability, reliability, efficiency, and achievement of goals. The project control list is modified in light of the analysis results.

===Phases===
Incremental development slices the system functionality into increments (portions). In each increment, a slice of functionality is delivered through cross-discipline work, from the requirements to the deployment. The Unified Process groups increments/iterations into phases: inception, elaboration, construction, and transition.
* Inception identifies project scope, requirements (functional and non-functional) and risks at a high level but in enough detail that work can be estimated.
* Elaboration delivers a working architecture that mitigates the top risks and fulfills the non-functional requirements.
* Construction incrementally fills-in the architecture with production-ready code produced from analysis, design, implementation, and testing of the functional requirements.
* Transition delivers the system into the production operating environment.
Each of the phases may be divided into 1 or more iterations, which are usually time-boxed rather than feature-boxed. Architects and analysts work one iteration ahead of developers and testers to keep their work-product backlog full.

===Usage and history===

Many examples of early usage are provided in Craig Larman and Victor Basili&#x27;s article &quot;Iterative and Incremental Development: A Brief History&quot;, with one of the earliest being NASA&#x27;s 1960s Project Mercury.

Some of those Mercury engineers later formed a new division within IBM, where &quot;another early and striking example of a major IID success [was] the very heart of NASA’s space shuttle software—the primary avionics software system, which [they] built from 1977 to 1980. The team applied IID in a series of 17 iterations over 31 months, averaging around eight weeks per iteration. Their motivation for avoiding the waterfall life cycle was that the shuttle program’s requirements changed during the software development process.&quot;

Some organizations, such as the US Department of Defense, have a preference for iterative methodologies, starting with MIL-STD-498 &quot;clearly encouraging evolutionary acquisition and IID&quot;.
The DoD Instruction 5000.2 released in 2000 stated a clear preference for IID: There are two approaches, evolutionary and single step [waterfall], to full capability. An evolutionary approach is preferred. … [In this] approach, the ultimate capability delivered to the user is divided into two or more blocks, with increasing increments of capability...software development shall follow an iterative spiral development process in which continually expanding software versions are based on learning from earlier development. It can also be done in phases. Recent revisions to DoDI 5000.02 no longer refer to &quot;spiral development,&quot; but do advocate the general approach as a baseline for software-intensive development/procurement programs. In addition, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) also employs an iterative and incremental developmental approach to its programming cycle to design, monitor, evaluate, learn and adapt international development projects with a project management approach that focuses on incorporating collaboration, learning, and adaptation strategies to iterate and adapt programming.

===Contrast with Waterfall development===

The main cause of the software development projects failure is the choice of the model, so should be made with a great care.

For example, the Waterfall development paradigm completes the project-wide work-products of each discipline in one step before moving on to the next discipline in a succeeding step. Business value is delivered all at once, and only at the very end of the project, whereas backtracking is possible in an iterative approach. Comparing the two approaches, some patterns begin to emerge:

* User involvement: In the waterfall model, the user is involved in two stages of the model, i.e. requirements and acceptance testing, and possibly creation of user education material. Whereas in the incremental model, the client is involved at each and every stage.
*Variability: The software is delivered to the user only after the build stage of the life cycle is completed, for user acceptance testing. On the other hand, every increment is delivered to the user and after the approval of user, the developer is allowed to move towards the next module.
*Human resources: In the incremental model fewer staff are potentially required as compared to the waterfall model.
*Time limitation: An operational product is delivered after months while in the incremental model the product is given to the user within a few weeks.
*Project size: Waterfall model is unsuitable for small projects while the incremental model is suitable for small, as well as large projects.

===Implementation guidelines===
Guidelines that drive software implementation and analysis include:
* Any difficulty in design, coding and testing a modification should signal the need for redesign or re-coding.
* Modifications should fit easily into isolated and easy-to-find modules. If they do not, some redesign is possibly needed.
* Modifications to tables should be especially easy to make. If any table modification is not quickly and easily done, redesign is indicated.
* Modifications should become easier to make as the iterations progress. If they are not, there is a basic problem such as a design flaw or a proliferation of patches.
* Patches should normally be allowed to exist for only one or two iterations. Patches may be necessary to avoid redesigning during an implementation phase.
* The existing implementation should be analyzed frequently to determine how well it measures up to project goals.
* Program analysis facilities should be used whenever available to aid in the analysis of partial implementations.
* User reaction should be solicited and analyzed for indications of deficiencies in the current implementation.

== Use in hardware and embedded systems ==

While the term &quot;iterative and incremental&quot; development got started in the software industry, many hardware and embedded software development efforts are using iterative and incremental techniques.

Examples of this may be seen in a number of industries. One sector that has recently been substantially affected by this shift of thinking has been the space launch industry, with substantial new competitive forces at work brought about by faster and more extensive technology innovation brought to bear by the formation of private companies pursuing space launch. These companies, such as SpaceX and Rocket Lab, are now both providing commercial orbital launch services in the past decade, something that only six nations had done prior to a decade ago. New innovation in technology development approaches, pricing, and service offerings—including the ability that has existed only since 2016 to fly to space on a previously flown (reusable) booster stage—further decreasing the price of obtaining access to space.

SpaceX has been explicit about its effort to bring iterative design practices into the space industry, and uses the technique on spacecraft, launch vehicles, electronics and avionics, and operational flight hardware operations.

As the industry has begun to change, other launch competitors are beginning to change their long-term development practices with government agencies as well. For example, the large US launch service provider United Launch Alliance (ULA) began in 2015 a decade-long project to restructure its launch business—reducing two launch vehicles to one—using an iterative and incremental approach to get to a partially-reusable and much lower-cost launch system over the next decade.

=== World War I ===
The regiment was constituted on 23 December 1917 in the Regular Army as the 60th Artillery, Coast Artillery Corps and organized at Fort Monroe, Virginia, comprising Regular Army companies and National Guard companies from Virginia and the District of Columbia. The regiment was sent to France to fight with the American Expeditionary Forces on the Western Front in World War I, participating in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and the Meuse-Argonne Offensive armed with 24 155 mm GPF guns. It was demobilized on 24 February 1919 at Fort Washington, with its National Guard companies reverting to state control.

=== Interwar period and World War II ===
The regiment was reconstituted on 26 October 1922 in the Regular Army as the 60th Artillery Battalion, Antiaircraft and organized at Fort Crockett, Texas. It was expanded, reorganized, and redesignated as the 60th Coast Artillery, with 1st Battalion organized at Fort William McKinley in Manila, Philippine Islands. The regimental headquarters was activated at the fort on 31 August 1925, with the 1st Battalion, without Batteries A and B, being simultaneously inactivated, and Battery E activated at the fort. On 1 April 1929, 1st Battalion and Battery F were activated at Fort Mills on Corregidor. The rest of the regiment was activated at Fort Mills on 30 May 1941.

It was part of USAFFE&#x27;s Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays, under the Philippine Coast Artillery Command.

A battery, with a platoon of searchlights, was located at Fort Wint, in Subic Bay. Following the Attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December of that year, the Japanese invaded the Philippines. The regiment served in the Battle of Bataan and the Battle of Corregidor, and surrendered to the Japanese at the end of the latter on 6 May 1942.

Armed with the short range M167A1 towed Vulcan Air Defense System and long range MIM-72 Chaparral surface-to-air missile launcher, the battalion provided airbase defense for Ramstein Air Base. It included three firing batteries, each with four firing platoons (two Vulcan and two Chaparral), eight Vulcans, and eight Chaparrals.

A Battery was initially located at Husterhoeh Kaserne and Zweibrücken Air Base, and eventually was completely relocated to the latter. Headquarters &amp; Headquarters Battery, the 92d Ordnance Detachment, and B Battery were located at Ramstein, while C Battery at Daenner Kaserne defended the Kaiserslautern Army Depot. On 8 January 1985, the battalion was relieved from its assignment to the 108th Brigade and transferred to the 94th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, swapping places with the 94th&#x27;s 2nd Battalion, 62d Air Defense Artillery.

<doc id="163881" wikidata="Q2613769" url="?curid=163881" title="The Famous Jett Jackson">
<text>The Famous Jett Jackson is a coming-of-age television series for the Disney Channel. The show is about a boy named Jett Jackson (Lee Thompson Young) who plays a teenage secret agent on a fictional show-within-a-show called &quot;Silverstone&quot;.

==Premise==
Jett Jackson previously lived with his actress mother in Los Angeles, but missed his home and his friends. Longing for a relatively normal life, Jett succeeds in getting the production of &quot;Silverstone&quot; moved to the fictional city of Wilsted, North Carolina, thus providing jobs to townspeople while affording Jett the chance to live with his father, Sheriff Woodrick &quot;Wood&quot; Jackson, and his great-grandmother, Miz Coretta (whom Jett calls Nana). Keeping in touch with his mother Jules by video link on his computer (though by the third season she also moved to Wilsted), Jett now spends part of his time with family, friends and school, and the rest living the life of a working actor and celebrity. In doing so, Jett often ends up in sticky situations, usually aided and abetted by his childhood friend, J.B., his not-quite girlfriend Kayla, and sometimes by Cubby, &quot;Silverstone&quot;&#x27;s wacky special effects wizard. In the second half of the series, Jett&#x27;s new co-star, Riley Grant, is added to the mix.

The show within the show, &quot;Silverstone&quot;, is about a spy who works for Mission Omega Matrix (the acronym being a pun on the word &quot;Mom&quot;) in order to save the world from villains like Dr. Hypnoto and The Rat. In contrast to Jett, Silverstone has no family, only his mentor, Artemus, and eventually his partner &quot;Hawk&quot; (surname Hawkins) (&quot;played&quot; by Riley Grant). From the second season onward, the action sequences and Silverstone subplots became more prominent.

The relative realism of Jett&#x27;s home life sometimes gave way to fantasy or paranormal elements, such as one episode in which Jett learns about a shameful incident in Wilsted&#x27;s history with a little prodding from the ghost of a key figure in the buried scandal. Other episodes dealt with issues in a more realistic and contemporary way, such as when J.B.&#x27;s father&#x27;s family-owned store is threatened by the arrival of high-powered, &quot;big box&quot; competition, and another in which Jett&#x27;s English teacher, Mr. Dupree, runs afoul of local attempts at censorship of a class reading assignment. Other episodes dealt with such topics as bulimia and the question of whether Jett, with his relatively sheltered and pampered home life, can truly understand or cope with the problems of other African Americans.

The series was followed by a Disney Channel original movie in which Jett finds himself trapped in Silverstone&#x27;s world, and vice versa. In that movie, he takes on Silverstone&#x27;s role for real and is able to muddle through while Silverstone does the same thing in Jett&#x27;s world until Miz Coretta finds out the truth and he returns home and sends Jett back as well.

==History and related series==
Show creator Fracaswell Hyman reportedly devised the character before casting Lee Thompson Young for the role. Like Jett, Young was raised in a single parent home in the South, and decided on an acting career at an early age. Young went on to write one of the episodes produced for the series.

The series included both young guest stars such as Hayden Christensen, Rachel McAdams, Britney Spears, and Destiny&#x27;s Child and veteran stars such as Eartha Kitt, the latter of whom played the new coach of Wilsted&#x27;s minor league baseball team in one episode.

The series ended on June 22, 2001, due to Disney&#x27;s unstated policy of producing 65 episodes per series.

The show&#x27;s end theme, &quot;It&#x27;s Not What You Think&quot;, was performed by the band Youngstown in 1999; the full song includes lyrics from Young. The song was used for show credits in seasons 2 and 3.

One of the producers, Jim Steyer of company JP Kids, would go on to found Common Sense Media in 2003.

==Film==
&quot;Jett Jackson: The Movie&quot; premiered on Disney Channel on June 8, 2001.

==Syndication==
After the series ended in 2001, it continued to air in reruns. &quot;The Famous Jett Jackson&quot; was removed from the Disney Channel schedule in June 2004. The show briefly aired on ABC Family from December 2003 to January 2004. The show was briefly seen again on Disney XD in 2009.

==Critical reaction==
Response to the show was generally positive. Laura Fries of &quot;Variety&quot;, the Hollywood trade paper, noted in her review of &quot;Jett Jackson: The Movie&quot; that &quot;Young serves as an appealing role model, much like Sarah Michelle Gellar&#x27;s &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; --someone who can fulfill young, action craving audiences without the gratuitous violence. There&#x27;s a sense of empowerment associated with these sort of roles, and handled correctly, they function as an excellent allegory for the confusing teenage years.&quot; Although she mentions &quot;contrived plot devices&quot;, she also refers to the series as &quot;clever&quot; and &quot;an extremely entertaining concept&quot;.

===Awards and nominations===
The series &quot;The Famous Jett Jackson&quot; and its young cast were nominated for Young Artist Awards, presented by the nonprofit Young Artist Foundation, in several categories in the course of the show&#x27;s run:

<doc id="163883" wikidata="Q1427216" url="?curid=163883" title="The Coasters">
<text>The Coasters are an American rhythm and blues/rock and roll vocal group who had a string of hits in the late 1950s. With hits including &quot;Searchin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Young Blood&quot;, &quot;Charlie Brown&quot;, &quot;Poison Ivy&quot;, and &quot;Yakety Yak&quot;, their most memorable songs were written by the songwriting and producing team of Leiber and Stoller. Although the Coasters originated outside of mainstream doo-wop, their records were so frequently imitated that they became an important part of the doo-wop legacy through the 1960s. In 1987, they were the first group inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==History==
The Coasters were formed on October 12, 1955, when Carl Gardner and Bobby Nunn left Los Angeles–based rhythm-and-blues group The Robins and signed to Atlantic Records. Dubbed The Coasters because they had moved from the West Coast to the East Coast, the original lineup comprised the vocal quartet of Gardner, Nunn, Billy Guy, and Leon Hughes (who was replaced by Young Jessie on a couple of their early Los Angeles recordings), plus guitarist Adolph Jacobs up until his departure in 1959.

The songwriting team of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller started Spark Records and in 1955 produced &quot;Smokey Joe&#x27;s Cafe&quot; for the Robins (their sixth single with Leiber and Stoller). The record was popular enough for Atlantic Records to offer Leiber and Stoller an independent production contract to produce the Robins for Atlantic. Only two of the Robins—Gardner and Nunn—were willing to make the move to Atlantic, recording their first songs in the same studio as the Robins had done (Master Recorders). In late 1957, Carl Gardner and Billy Guy moved to New York with newcomers Cornell Gunter and Will &quot;Dub&quot; Jones to reform The Coasters. The new quartet was from then on stationed in New York, although all had Los Angeles roots.

The Coasters&#x27; association with Leiber and Stoller was an immediate success. Together they created a string of good-humored &quot;storytelling&quot; hits that are some of the most entertaining from the original era of rock and roll. According to Leiber and Stoller, getting the humor to come through on the records often required more recording &quot;takes&quot; than for a typical musical number.

Their first single, &quot;Down in Mexico&quot;, was an R&amp;B hit in 1956. The following year, the Coasters crossed over to the pop chart in a big way with the double-sided &quot;Young Blood&quot;/&quot;Searchin&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Searchin&#x27;&quot; was the group&#x27;s first U.S. Top 10 hit, and topped the R&amp;B chart for 13 weeks, becoming the biggest R&amp;B single of 1957 (all were recorded in Los Angeles).

&quot;Yakety Yak&quot; (recorded in New York), featuring King Curtis on tenor saxophone, included the famous lineup of Gardner, Guy, Jones, and Gunter, and became the act&#x27;s only national number one single, topping both the pop and R&amp;B charts. The next single, &quot;Charlie Brown&quot;, reached number two on both charts. It was followed by &quot;Along Came Jones&quot;, &quot;Poison Ivy&quot; (number 1 for almost two months on the R&amp;B chart), and &quot;Little Egypt (Ying-Yang)&quot;.

Changing popular tastes and changes in the group&#x27;s line-up contributed to a lack of hits in the 1960s. During this time, Billy Guy was also working on solo projects; the New York singer Vernon Harrell was brought in to replace him for stage performances. Later members included Earl &quot;Speedo&quot; Carroll (lead of the Cadillacs), Ronnie Bright (the bass voice on Johnny Cymbal&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Bass Man&quot;), Jimmy Norman, and guitarist Thomas &quot;Curley&quot; Palmer. The Coasters signed with Columbia Records&#x27; Date label in 1966, reuniting with Leiber and Stoller (who had parted ways with Atlantic Records in 1963), but never regained their former fame. In 1971, the Coasters had a minor chart entry with &quot;Love Potion No. 9&quot;, a song that Leiber and Stoller had written for the Coasters, but instead gave to the Clovers in 1959. In Britain, a 1994 Volkswagen TV advertisement used the group&#x27;s &quot;Sorry But I&#x27;m Gonna Have to Pass&quot;, which led to a minor chart placement in that country.

In 1987, the Coasters became the first group inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, crediting the members of the 1958 configuration. The Coasters also joined the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999.

Several groups used the name in the 1970s, touring throughout the country, though original member Carl Gardner held the legal rights to it. Gardner continued to tour with the Coasters and made many attempts to stop bogus groups with no connection to the original group using the name. In late 2005, Carl&#x27;s son Carl Gardner Jr. took over as lead with the group when his father retired. The Coasters&#x27; line-up then consisted of Carl Gardner Jr., J. W. Lance, Primo Candelara, and Eddie Whitfield. Carl Jr. later left this group and has started his own group with Curley Palmer. Carl&#x27;s widow Veta owns the rights to the Coasters name.

Leon Hughes, the last surviving member of the original Coasters, died of natural causes on March 1, 2023, at the age of 92. Prior to his death, he performed with his own group. 

Several former members of the band met untimely ends. Saxophonist King Curtis, known as the &quot;Fifth Coaster,&quot; was fatally stabbed by two drug addicts outside his apartment building in 1971. Cornelius Gunter was murdered in a Las Vegas parking garage in 1990.

<text>The 200th Coast Artillery (AA) (200 CA) was a United States Army unit during the first half of World War II. Today descendant elements serve with the New Mexico Army National Guard as the 200th Infantry.

==History==
Most of this section is taken from &quot;Army Lineage Series: Air Defense Artillery&quot; by Janice E. McKenney.

=== Cavalry and infantry ===
The 200th Infantry Regiment traces its origins to the organization, on 1 September 1880, of the 1st Regiment in the New Mexico Volunteer Militia in west-central New Mexico from previous independent companies. It was divided on 18 February 1882 into the 1st Regiment, with headquarters at Socorro; and the 2nd Regiment with headquarters at Albuquerque.

The 1st Regiment was expanded 25 April 1883 to form the 1st Regiment and the 2nd Cavalry Battalion (1st Regiment; hereafter, separate lineage). 2nd Cavalry was reorganized and redesignated 14 September 1883 as the 1st Regiment of Cavalry (less 3rd Battalion; see below). It was reorganized 10 November 1885 as the 1st Regiment of Cavalry. It was disbanded 29 December 1893 and two remaining troops attached to the 1st Regiment of Infantry. The unit was reorganized 12 September 1896 in the New Mexico Volunteer Militia as the 1st Battalion of Cavalry with headquarters at Santa Fe. (New Mexico Volunteer Militia redesignated 17 March 1897 as the New Mexico National Guard.) The unit was redesignated in 1897 as the 1st Squadron of Cavalry. While remaining in state service the 1st Squadron of Cavalry additionally formed the 2nd Squadron, 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry, also known as the &quot;Rough Riders&quot; (mustered into federal service 6–7 May 1898 at Santa Fe; mustered out of federal service 15 September 1898 at Montauk Point, New York). Troop A attached 5 February 1908 to the 1st Regiment of Infantry (see below); remainder of squadron concurrently disbanded.

The 2nd Regiment was expanded 25 April 1883 to form the 2nd Regiment and the 1st Cavalry Battalion. The 2nd Regiment was redesignated 10 November 1885 as the 1st Regiment of Infantry with headquarters at Santa Fe. Location of headquarters was changed 16 August 1886 to Albuquerque.

The 1st Cavalry Battalion was reorganized and redesignated 14 September 1883 as the 3rd Battalion, 1st Regiment of Cavalry. The unit was expanded, reorganized and redesignated 10 November 1885 as the 2nd Regiment of Cavalry.

The 1st Regiment of Infantry and elements of the 2nd Regiment of Cavalry were consolidated 24 December 1890 and consolidated unit designated at the 1st Regiment of Infantry. 1st Regiment of Infantry was consolidated in 1909 with Troop A (see above) and consolidated unit designated as the 1st Regiment of Infantry. The unit was mustered into federal service 21 April 1917 and its elements reorganized and redesignated as elements of the 115th Train Headquarters and Military Police and the 143rd and 144th Machine Gun Battalions, elements of the 40th Division.

The Military Police section of the 115th Train Headquarters and Military Police was reorganized and redesignated 27 October 1918 as the 40th Military Police Company, an element of the 40th Division, and the 115th Train Headquarters and Military Police was concurrently reorganized and redesignated as the 115th Train Headquarters. The 40th Military Police Company demobilized 2 May 1919 at Camp Kearny, California, and the 115th Train Headquarters was demobilized 25 April 1919 at Camp Kearny.

The 143rd and 144th Machine Gun Battalions demobilized 30 April 1919 at Camp Grant, Illinois.

The former 1st Regiment of Infantry was reconstituted 16 July 1919 in the New Mexico National Guard as a separate squadron of cavalry and organized with Troops A and B at Albuquerque and Carlsbad, respectively. It was expanded, reorganized and redesignated 3 December 1920 as the 1st Cavalry. It was redesignated 2 May 1922 as the 111th Cavalry. Headquarters federally recognized 4 May 1924 at Santa Fe.

=== First creation of 200th Coast Artillery (AA) in North Carolina ===
The first entity designated the 200th Coast Artillery Regiment (Antiaircraft) existed from 1921 until 5 September 1927 in the North Carolina National Guard. The regiment was constituted in the National Guard in 1921 as the 200th Artillery Regiment (Antiaircraft), Coast Artillery Corps. Battery G, its only active element, was organized on 5 August 1921 at Raeford, North Carolina and assigned to the IV Corps. Additional elements were allocated as follows, but were never organized: Regimental Headquarters and Headquarters Battery (HHB) and Batteries B, C, D, E, F, I, K, and L allotted to Louisiana; Battery A allotted to Alabama; and Battery M allotted to Florida. New Orleans, Louisiana was designated as the headquarters location on organization, but the unit was never organized at that location. Regiment redesignated 200th Coast Artillery (Antiaircraft) on 27 September 1924. On 1 December 1926 Battery G was redesignated as Battery F, 252nd Coast Artillery Battalion (Harbor Defense) in the North Carolina National Guard; the other elements were withdrawn from their allotted states and transferred to the deferred list. When the deferred list was abandoned, the regiment was withdrawn from the National Guard and demobilized on 5 September 1927. It had a separate lineage from the New Mexico National Guard unit.

At some later time the designation was transferred to the New Mexico National Guard.

=== Antiaircraft artillery ===
The 111th Cavalry, tracing its lineage back to the 1st Regiment, New Mexico Volunteer Militia (1880), was converted and redesignated on 26 April 1940 as the 207th Coast Artillery Regiment (Antiaircraft). Redesignated as the 200th Coast Artillery (AA) on 1 July 1940, with the “207th CA” designation being transferred to the converted 107th Infantry Regiment, a New York National Guard unit.

It was inducted into federal service 6 January 1941 at home stations in New Mexico. The 200th CA was equipped with 12 3-inch guns (an older model with a vertical range of 8,200 m), water-cooled .50-caliber machine guns, and Sperry searchlights.

The 200th was doubled in size with draftees to 1,800 men while at Fort Bliss preparing for overseas deployment. In August 1941, the 200th was given notice that it had been selected for an overseas assignment of great importance. The Arkansas National Guard 206th CA and the 200th competed for deployment to either the Philippines or the Aleutian Islands. The 200th, whose personnel virtually all spoke fluent Spanish, were chosen to go to the Philippines, and arrived there in September 1941. Upon arrival it was assigned to the US Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) and ordered to provide air defenses for Clark Field while based at Fort Stotsenburg, although they were not attached to the Philippine Coast Artillery Command, which was primarily a harbor defense command. At about 0300 hours on 8 December 1941, the 200th went on full alert when the night radio crew picked up commercial broadcasts telling of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

The 200th CA surrendered on 9 April 1942 to the Japanese 14th Army. Elements of the unit were forced by the Japanese to march into captivity in the Bataan Death March.

The Headquarters, 200th Coast Artillery, was redesignated 31 May 1946 as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 200th Antiaircraft Artillery Group. Headquarters, 200th Antiaircraft Artillery Group, organized and federally recognized 25 September 1947 at Roswell. It was reorganized and was redesignated 1 September 1959 as Headquarters, 200th Artillery Group. It was consolidated 15 December 1967 with the 200th Artillery and consolidated unit designated at the 200th Artillery, a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental system.

The 2nd Battalion, 200th Coast Artillery, was redesignated 31 May 1946 as the 697th Antiaircraft Artillery Automatic Weapons Battalion. It was reorganized and federally recognized 2 November 1947 in southeastern New Mexico with headquarters at Roswell. Redesignated 1 October 1953 as the 697th Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion.

The 716th, 717th, 726th and 697th Antiaircraft Artillery Battalions; Headquarters, 515th Antiaircraft Artillery Group; 502nd Field Artillery Battalion (organized and federally recognized 21 September 1956 in eastern New Mexico with headquarters at Clovis); 120th Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion; and 804th Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion consolidated 1 September 1959 and consolidated unit reorganized and redesignated as the 200th Artillery, a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System, to consist of the 1st Automatic Weapons Battalion; the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Gun Battalions; and the 7th and 8th Detachments. The headquarters battery of the 2nd Battalion, reorganized from that of the 200th Antiaircraft Artillery Group, was at Las Cruces. Reorganized 1 April 1962 to consist of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Automatic Weapons Battalions and the 7th and 8th Detachments. Consolidated 15 December 1967 with Headquarters, 200th Artillery, a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental system, to consist of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Battalions.

The unit was redesignated 1 November 1972 as the 200th Air Defense Artillery. Reorganized 1 September 1975 to consist of the 1st Battalion, an element of the 49th Armored Division; the 2nd Battalion, an element of the 47th Infantry Division; the 3rd Battalion, an element of the 50th Armored Division; and the 4th Battalion, an element of the 40th Infantry Division. 1st Battalion headquarters was at Roswell, 2nd Battalion at Las Cruces, 3rd Battalion at Albuquerque, and 4th Battalion at Tucumcari. Equipped with the M42 Duster self-propelled anti-aircraft gun, the battalions served as divisional air defense artillery units of National Guard divisions but were under the administrative control of the 111th Air Defense Artillery Brigade headquarters. The 5th Battalion was activated on 1 July 1983, the first and only Roland-equipped United States Army unit, and reached initial operating capability in December 1985. The majority of its personnel volunteered for full-time service at McGregor Range, administered by Fort Bliss. As a result, the battalion was affiliated with the active 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade and under the control of Central Command and Forces Command. During its five years of existence, the battalion made 101 Roland firings during exercises. 

The 4th Battalion replaced its now obsolete M42 Dusters with the Chaparral missile system and its Battery B at Springer became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the new 6th Battalion on 15 November 1986. Battery A of the 6th Battalion was at Raton with Detachment 1 at Clayton, Battery B at Taos, and Battery C at Espanola. Battery C was converted from a heavy equipment maintenance detachment. 

It was reorganized on 3 March 1987 to consist of the 1st Battalion, an element of the 49th Armored Division; the 2nd Battalion, an element of the 4th Infantry Division; the 3rd Battalion, an element of the 50th Armored Division; 4th Battalion, an element of the 40th Infantry Division; and the 5th and 7th Battalions. The 5th and 7th Battalions were equipped with the Roland and Hawk air defense missiles respectively. 

The 5th Battalion, with 300 out of 400 personnel full-time, was inactivated on 30 September 1988 due to budget cuts and the retirement of the Roland system; 143 of its full-time personnel transferred to the 7th Battalion at Rio Rancho. The regiment was withdrawn on 1 June 1989 from the Combat Arms Regimental System and reorganized under the United States Army Regimental System with headquarters at Roswell.

During annual training in 1989, 7th Battalion, 200th ADA, became the first Army reserve component unit to live-fire the Hawk air defense missile. 

On 1 October 1993, the Headquarters Battery of the 2nd Battalion at Las Cruces was expanded into a new 2nd Battalion, transitioning from the Chaparral to the Hawk. Hawk-trained personnel from the 7th Battalion were planned to transfer to the new unit if they desired to. HHB and Batteries A and B were located in Las Cruces, while Battery C was in Alamogordo. The battalion was converted into the 1st Battalion, 202nd Field Artillery on 15 December 1995. By 1996, 6th Battalion was assigned as the divisional air defense battalion for the 42nd Infantry Division and in the process of transitioning to the Avenger missile system. 

The 7th Battalion was announced as the second National Guard Patriot missile battalion in December 1997, but the equipment did not begin arriving until March 1998, piecemeal. As a result of the Patriot conversion, the 7th was redesignated as the 2nd that year. Due to the demanding nature of Patriot training, the 2nd Battalion struggled to fill its ranks: in mid-2003 it had only 202 soldiers out of an authorized strength of 547. By that point, three Patriot launchers out of fifteen authorized had been delivered to the unit, enough for two of five required batteries. The Avenger-equipped 4th Battalion was inactivated in 2003 and replaced by a military police unit. At the time, it had batteries in Rio Rancho, Raton, Tucumcari, and Clovis. 

Today the regiment has elements serving with the New Mexico Army National Guard. Colonel Bump transitioned the 3rd Battalion, 200th ADA, to infantry in 2005, and the battalion was redesignated the 1st Battalion, 200th Infantry. The 1st Battalion, headquartered at Roswell, was converted into the 717th Support Battalion in early 2006 due to the reduced need for air defense units during the War on terror. The 2nd Battalion was inactivated in the second half of 2005, its personnel spread among new support and infantry units. 

On 4 September 2005, the 2nd Battalion, 200th Infantry was converted from the 1st Battalion, 202nd Field Artillery as a light infantry unit. The battalion included HHC and rifle and forward support companies at Las Cruces and a heavy weapons company at Alamogordo. The battalion was inactivated on 25 September 2008.

===515th Coast Artillery (Antiaircraft)===
On 19 December 1941 the 515th Coast Artillery (Antiaircraft) was activated at Fort Stotsenburg as a provisional AAA regiment by the expansion and redesignation of one battalion of the 200th CA. It was originally designated &quot;Provisional 200th CA (AA) Regiment of Manila&quot; on 8 December 1941, initially with 20 officers and 500 enlisted men manning AA weapons previously stored in the Manila area. The number &quot;515th&quot; was taken from an Organized Reserve regiment in Lincoln, Nebraska, organized in 1924, that probably had few personnel assigned. On 19 December 1941 the regiment was redesignated as the 515th and augmented with about 750 officers and enlisted men of the Philippine Commonwealth Army for training. Moved from Manila 25 December 1941 (the day before Manila was declared an open city) to defend the withdrawal routes to Bataan, where the unit defended the Cabcaben airfield and other key points until surrendering as part of the Philippine Provisional Coast Artillery Brigade on 9 April 1942.

<text>Viggo Peter Mortensen Jr. (; born October 20, 1958) is an American actor, musician, and filmmaker. He is the recipient of various accolades, including nominations for three Academy Awards for Best Actor, three BAFTA Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, and an Independent Spirit Award.

Mortensen made his film debut as Moses Hochleitner in Peter Weir&#x27;s 1985 thriller &quot;Witness&quot;. Through the late 1990s, Mortensen played supporting roles in a variety of films including the historical romance &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; (1996), the action drama &quot;G.I. Jane&quot; (1997), the crime drama &quot;A Perfect Murder&quot; (1998), and the comedy &quot;28 Days&quot; (2000).

Mortensen gained international attention for his breakthrough role as Aragorn in the fantasy trilogy &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (2001–2003). He later starred in several David Cronenberg films including &quot;A History of Violence&quot; (2005), &quot;Eastern Promises&quot; (2007), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, and &quot;A Dangerous Method&quot; (2011). He gained additional Academy Award nominations for his leading roles as an anarchist father in &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot; (2016) and as Tony Lip in &quot;Green Book&quot; (2018). Mortensen made his directorial debut with &quot;Falling&quot; (2020), in which he also starred. &quot;Falling&quot; was nominated for the Goya Award for Best European Film.

In addition to film, Mortensen has pursued a variety of artistic endeavors including painting, poetry, music, and photography. Mortensen composed and performed music for films including &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; soundtrack, and has collaborated with guitarist Buckethead on several albums.

In 2002, Mortensen founded Perceval Press to publish his works and the works of little-known artists and authors.

== Early life ==
Mortensen was born in Watertown, New York, on October 20, 1958, to Grace Gamble (; July 8, 1928 – April 25, 2015) and Viggo Peter Mortensen Sr. (May 8, 1929 – March 2, 2017). His mother was American, while his father was Danish. They met in Norway. His maternal grandfather was a Canadian from Nova Scotia. His paternal grandmother was from Trondheim, Norway.

In 1961, the family moved to Venezuela, then Denmark, and eventually settled in Argentina. They lived successively in the provinces of Córdoba, Chaco, and Buenos Aires. Mortensen attended primary school and acquired a fluent proficiency in Spanish while his father managed poultry farms and ranches. He was baptized Lutheran, the tradition of his father, though he now identifies as an atheist.

When Mortensen was 11 and his brothers 8 and 6, their parents divorced. In 1969, the three boys returned with their mother to the United States, where Viggo spent the rest of his childhood in Northern New York State. He graduated from Watertown High School in 1976. He attended St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1980 in Spanish studies and government.

After graduating, Mortensen moved to Europe and lived in the United Kingdom and Spain before returning to Denmark. There he took various jobs such as driving trucks in Esbjerg and selling flowers in Copenhagen. In 1982, he returned to the United States to pursue an acting career.

== Acting career ==
=== 1980s–1990s: First films ===
Mortensen&#x27;s first film role was in the Woody Allen film &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot; (1985), but his scenes were deleted from the final cut. He was one of the four finalists to play the title role of Tarzan in the adventure film &quot;&quot; (1984), though the role eventually went to Christopher Lambert.

His first onscreen appearance was playing an Amish farmer in Peter Weir&#x27;s &quot;Witness&quot;. He was cast because the director thought he had the right face for the part. Although he was simultaneously cast as a soldier in Shakespeare in the Park&#x27;s production of &quot;Henry V&quot;, he chose to work on &quot;Witness&quot; instead, citing a desire to try something new. Mortensen credited that decision and the positive experience on the film as the start of his film career. Also in 1985, he was cast in the role of Bragg on the TV series &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;.

Mortensen&#x27;s 1987 performance in &quot;Bent&quot; at the Coast Playhouse, Los Angeles, won him a Dramalogue Critics&#x27; Award. The play, which revolves around homosexual prisoners in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany, was known for the leading performance by Ian McKellen, with whom Mortensen later costarred in the film trilogy &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The same year, Mortensen starred as Jerome Stample in the black comedy &quot;Salvation!&quot; alongside Exene Cervenka, and played Burke, a professional car thief in &quot;Prison&quot;. He also guest starred as a police detective on the hit TV series &quot;Miami Vice.&quot; In 1988, Mortensen played a minor part as Green, the abusive husband of Jewel (Molly Ringwald), in Fresh Horses. The following year, Mortensen appeared in a minor role as Hans in &quot;Tripwire&quot;.

Mortensen made three film appearances in 1990: Edward &quot;Tex&quot; Sawyer, a member of a cannibalistic family in &quot;&quot;, John W. Poe in &quot;Young Guns II&quot;, and Cameron Dove, a military veteran suffering from radiation poisoning in &quot;The Reflecting Skin&quot;. &quot;The Reflecting Skin&quot; was Mortensen&#x27;s first film to premiere at the Cannes Film Festival. The following year, Mortensen starred as Frank Roberts in Sean Penn&#x27;s directorial debut The Indian Runner. Sandy Dennis, who played Frank Roberts&#x27;s mother in the film and was a personal friend of Mortensen, was dying of ovarian cancer during filming. Mortensen described the filming experience as having an &quot;undercurrent of loss,&quot; and wrote the poem &quot;For Sandy Dennis&quot; in her honor.

In 1992, Mortensen starred in Ruby Cairo alongside Liam Neeson and Andie MacDowell. Although Ruby Cairo was Mortensen&#x27;s highest-budget film at this point in his career, it was a commercial failure, bringing in only 608,000 on its 24 million dollar budget. The next year, the film was recut and given the title &quot;Deception&quot;. Several scenes were reshot for &quot;Deception&quot;, including a sex scene between Mortensen and MacDowell, which was removed and replaced with a less intimate dialogue on a balcony.

By the mid-1990s, Mortensen was consistently making several film appearances a year. During this time, Mortensen was frequently cast in crime dramas such as Lalin Miasso in Carlito&#x27;s Way, Carl Frazer in The Young Americans, Nick Davis in American Yakuza, and Guy Foucard in Albino Aligator.

Other films from that time include Jane Campion&#x27;s &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot;, where he played Caspar Goodwood, a love interest of the film&#x27;s protagonist, Isabel Archer (Nicole Kidman). He also acted in &quot;Crimson Tide&quot;, &quot;Daylight&quot;, &quot;A Walk on the Moon&quot;, &quot;The Passion of Darkly Noon&quot;, &quot;28 Days&quot;, and &quot;The Prophecy&quot;, with Christopher Walken.

With a budget of $50 million, G.I Jane (1997) was Mortensen&#x27;s biggest budget film appearance prior to his role in &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. Although the film earned his co-star, Demi Moore, a Golden Raspberry Award for her role, Mortensen&#x27;s performance as Command Master Chief John James &#x27;Jack&#x27; Urgayle was favorably received.

In 1998, Mortensen appeared in remakes of two Alfred Hitchcock movies: Psycho and A Perfect Murder (which was a remake of Dial M for Murder).

=== 2000s: &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and breakthrough ===

Another major mainstream breakthrough came in 1999, when Peter Jackson cast him as Aragorn in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy. According to the Special Extended Edition DVD of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, Mortensen was a last-minute replacement for Stuart Townsend, and would not have taken the part of Aragorn had it not been for his son&#x27;s enthusiasm for the J. R. R. Tolkien novel. He received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Aragorn, and was ranked No. 15 on a 2015 survey of &quot;The 100 Greatest Movie Characters&quot; conducted by &quot;Empire&quot;.

In &quot;The Two Towers&quot; DVD extras, the film&#x27;s swordmaster, Bob Anderson, described Mortensen as &quot;the best swordsman I&#x27;ve ever trained.&quot; Mortensen often performed his own stunts, and even the injuries he sustained during several of them, including two broken toes, did not dampen his enthusiasm. At one point during filming of &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, and Brett Beattie (stunt double for John Rhys-Davies) all had painful injuries, which led to Peter Jackson jokingly referring to the three as &quot;the walking wounded.&quot; Also, according to the Special Extended Edition DVD of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;, Mortensen purchased the two horses, Uraeus and Kenny, whom he had ridden and bonded with over the duration of the films.

In 2004, Mortensen starred as Frank Hopkins in &quot;Hidalgo&quot;, the story of an ex-army courier who travels to Arabia to compete with his horse, Hidalgo, in a dangerous desert race for a contest prize.

Mortensen starred in David Cronenberg&#x27;s 2005 film &quot;A History of Violence&quot; as a family man revealed to have had an unsavory previous career. He was nominated for a Satellite Award for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture for this role. In the DVD extras for &quot;A History of Violence&quot;, Cronenberg related that Mortensen is the only actor he had come across who would come back from weekends with his family with items he had bought to use as props on the set. 

In 2006, he starred as Captain Diego Alatriste in the Spanish language film &quot;Alatriste&quot;, based on the series of novels &quot;The Adventures of Captain Alatriste&quot;, written by the Spanish writer Arturo Pérez-Reverte.

In September 2007, the film &quot;Eastern Promises&quot;, directed by David Cronenberg, was released to critical acclaim for the film itself and for Mortensen&#x27;s performance as a Russian gangster on the rise in London. His nude fight scene in a steam room was applauded by Roger Ebert: &quot;Years from now, it will be referred to as a benchmark.&quot; Mortensen&#x27;s performance in &quot;Eastern Promises&quot; resulted in his winning the Best Performance by an Actor in a British Independent Film award from the British Independent Film Awards. He was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor.

Mortensen appeared as himself in the 2009 film &quot;Reclaiming The Blade&quot;, in which he discussed his passion for the sword and his sword-work in films such as &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Alatriste&quot;. Mortensen also talked about his work with Bob Anderson, the swordmaster on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;Alatriste&quot;, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; and many others.

In 2009, Mortensen performed in &quot;The People Speak&quot;, a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian Howard Zinn&#x27;s &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot;. Later that year, he joined the cast of &quot;The Road&quot;, a film adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name, and collaborated with David Cronenberg for a third time on &quot;A Dangerous Method&quot;.

=== 2010s–present: Critical acclaim ===
After two years, Mortensen returned to theater in 2011, starring in Ariel Dorfman&#x27;s &quot;Purgatorio&quot; (&quot;Purgatory&quot;) in Madrid. &quot;Purgatorio&quot; is Mortensen&#x27;s first play in Spanish. The play is about a man and woman confined either in a psychiatric hospital or prison together. During production, Mortensen&#x27;s mother became ill and he pulled out of the initial premiere date, the first time he had ever done so for a project. The play premiered from November 4 to December 18.

During production for the 2012 film &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot;, Mortensen was offered to reprise his role as Aragorn, but he declined because the character does not appear in the novel the film is based on.

Mortensen starred in the 2016 film &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot;, for which he received his second Academy Award nomination. Alonso Duralde of &quot;TheWrap&quot; praised Mortensen&#x27;s performance, saying, &quot;The movie really belongs to Mortensen, who allows Ben to be exasperating, arrogant, and impatient but also warm, loving, and caring. He&#x27;s a tough but adoring father, a grieving widower and a passionate defender of his wife&#x27;s final wishes, and Mortensen plays all these notes, and more with subtlety and grace&quot;.

In 2018, he starred in the film &quot;Green Book&quot;. Mortensen portrayed Tony Lip, an Italian-American bouncer hired to drive and protect pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) on a tour through the Jim Crow South from 1962 to 1963. Reflecting on the character, Mortensen stated, &quot;I was attracted to playing Tony in part because it was a different kind of character, but the main thing I liked about him was his heart&quot;. Mortensen received his third Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Lip.

In 2020, Mortensen released his directorial debut &quot;Falling&quot;, which he also wrote, produced, composed the score for and starred in alongside Lance Henriksen at the Sundance Film Festival. Mortensen had based the story on his own family&#x27;s history, including his parents suffering from dementia. The film is dedicated to his brothers, Charles and Walter Mortensen.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020, Mortensen along with fellow Lord of the Rings actors Sean Astin, Sean Bean, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan, Miranda Otto, John Rhys-Davies, Andy Serkis, Liv Tyler, Karl Urban, Elijah Wood, writer Philippa Boyens, and director Peter Jackson joined actor Josh Gad&#x27;s YouTube series &quot;Reunited Apart&quot;, which reunites the cast of popular movies through video-conferencing, and promotes donations to non-profit charities.

Mortensen was cast as British cave diver Rick Stanton in the biographical film &quot;Thirteen Lives&quot; directed by Ron Howard which was released in July 2022. Mortensen was taught cave diving by Stanton personally to prepare for the role.

Mortensen reunited with David Cronenberg in the horror sci-fi film &quot;Crimes of the Future&quot;. Mortensen reunited with Lisandro Alonso on the film &quot;Eureka&quot;. Mortensen and Caleb Landry Jones will star together in the Vietnam War thriller &quot;Two Wolves&quot; which will be directed by documentary filmmaker Alex Gibney.

He wrote, directed, and stars in a Western film titled &quot;The Dead Don&#x27;t Hurt&quot;. It also stars Vicky Krieps and it was shot in Mexico.

== Literary and arts career ==
=== Perceval Press ===
With part of his earnings from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Mortensen founded the Perceval Press publishing house—named after the knight from the legend of King Arthur—to help other artists by publishing works that might not find a home in more traditional publishing venues. &quot;Perceval Press&quot; is also the home of Mortensen&#x27;s many personal artistic projects in the area of fine arts, photography, poetry, song, and literature.

=== Bibliography ===
Mortensen is also an author, with various books of poetry, photography, and painting published. His poems are written in English, Danish, and Spanish. With anthropologists Federico Bossert and Diego Villar, he has written several works related to ethnography of natives in South America, specifically in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Some of the published books co-authored by Mortensen are &quot;Sons of the Forest&quot; and &quot;Skovbo&quot;. Mortensen&#x27;s bibliography includes:

=== Visual arts and discography ===

Mortensen is a painter and photographer. His paintings are frequently abstract and often contain fragments of his poetry therein. His paintings have been featured in galleries worldwide, and many of the paintings of the artist he portrayed in &quot;A Perfect Murder&quot; are his own.

Mortensen experiments with his poetry and music by mixing the two art forms. He has collaborated with guitarist Buckethead on several albums, mostly released on his own label (Perceval Press) or TDRS Music. Viggo was first introduced to Buckethead&#x27;s work while working on sounds for an educational CD on Greek mythology. The finished product included a guitar part by Buckethead, which caught Viggo&#x27;s ear and led him to initiate contact with the guitarist. The collaboration grew from there.

== Personal life ==

=== Family and relationships ===
Mortensen holds dual American and Danish citizenship. He has stated that he was raised speaking English and Spanish, and sometimes feels that, when speaking Spanish, he &quot;can get to the heart of the matter better&quot;.

Mortensen met singer Exene Cervenka in 1986 on the set of the comedy &quot;Salvation!&quot; The couple married on July 8, 1987. On January 28, 1988, Cervenka gave birth to their son, Henry, who later played his on-screen son in the film &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; in 1995. Henry graduated from Columbia University in 2010 with a B.A. in archaeology and has been working at Perceval Press, which was founded by his father. Mortensen and Cervenka lived in Idaho for three years. They separated in 1992 and divorced in 1997. Since 2009, he has been in a relationship with Spanish actress Ariadna Gil. Though the couple reside in Madrid, Mortensen spends much of his time in the United States, and has stated, &quot;I am a citizen and longtime resident of the United States and am attached to its landscapes, history, and people.&quot; He has owned property in Sandpoint, Idaho, and spends time there when not filming movies.

Mortensen has talked about his family&#x27;s struggles with dementia, seeing both of his parents, three of his four grandparents, aunts, uncles, and his stepfather battle the condition. In 2016, Mortensen traveled to New York to take care of his father, who died a year later. Two years earlier, Mortensen&#x27;s mother had also died from complications of the condition.

Mortensen was a close friend of Icelandic painter Georg Guðni Hauksson until the latter&#x27;s death in 2011. He had long been an admirer of Georg Guðni&#x27;s work as a landscape artist, and the two published books together.

=== Sports ===
Mortensen has expressed a liking for association football, ice hockey and baseball. His favorite teams include Argentine club San Lorenzo de Almagro, English team Fulham, Spanish team Real Madrid, Turkish team Beşiktaş, and both the Argentine and Danish national teams. His favorite football players are Diego Maradona and Héctor &quot;Bambino&quot; Veira. He is a fan of the Montreal Canadiens and wore a Canadiens shirt underneath his costume throughout the filming of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. During the 100th anniversary celebrations of the Montreal Canadiens, Mortensen introduced one of his idols, Guy Lafleur, to the crowd at the Bell Centre in Montreal. He is also a fan of the New York Mets and, in an interview promoting 2009 film &quot;The Road&quot;, was seen wearing apparel indicating his support for the Australian Football League&#x27;s Collingwood Magpies. While appearing on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, he held a sign supporting the New York Giants of the NFL.

=== Political activities ===

During the press tour for &quot;Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, which occurred between the September 11 attacks and the Second Gulf War, Mortensen appeared in an interview wearing a t-shirt on which he had written, &quot;No More Blood for Oil.&quot;
In 2009, Mortensen signed a protest stating that the Toronto International Film Festival&#x27;s &quot;Spotlight on Tel Aviv&quot; program implicitly condoned the Israeli occupation and marginalization of Palestinians. In 2015 he donated $1,000 to Irish political party Sinn Fein.

Mortensen endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for U.S. president during the primaries for the 2016 election. After Sanders failed to win the Democratic Party nomination, Mortensen endorsed Green Party candidate Jill Stein. He wrote an open letter just before Election Day 2016 in which he listed the reasons he disagreed with Hillary Clinton’s policies and could not support her in the race against Donald Trump, though he thought that Clinton would be elected president. He went on to narrate a documentary, &quot;The Revolution Televised&quot;, about the 2016 presidential election and the protests in the aftermath of the Democratic National Convention.
Since 2018, Mortensen has been a member of the Catalan NGO Òmnium Cultural, a pro-independence organization dedicated to promoting Catalan culture and language in the arts and the public sphere. After Vox, a far-right Spanish party, published a tweet depicting Mortensen as Aragorn fighting various social movements, including pro-Catalan separatists, during the campaign for the 2019 Spanish general election, Mortensen wrote a letter to the editor criticizing the depiction saying, &quot;Not only is it absurd that I, the actor who embodied this character... and a person interested in the rich variety of cultures and languages that exist in Spain and the world, is linked to an ultra-nationalist and neo-fascist political party, it is even more ridiculous to use the character of Aragorn, a polyglot statesman who advocates knowledge and inclusion of the diverse races, customs and languages of Middle Earth, to legitimize an anti-immigrant, anti-feminist and Islamophobic political group.&quot;

In May 2020, Mortensen signed an open letter urging Israel to end its blockade of the Gaza Strip. In October 2023, Mortensen signed the Artists4Ceasefire open letter to President Joe Biden, calling for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war. In May 2024, Mortensen criticized Javier Milei&#x27;s Argentine government, calling him a &quot;clown&quot; and &quot;a puppet of the political right&quot;.

Wood made his film debut with a small part in &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; (1989) at the age of eight and achieved recognition as a child actor with roles in &quot;Avalon&quot; (1990), &quot;Forever Young&quot; (1992), and &quot;The Good Son&quot; (1993). As a teenager, he starred in the films including &quot;North&quot; (1994), &quot;The War&quot; (1994), &quot;Flipper&quot; (1996), &quot;The Ice Storm&quot; (1997), and &quot;Deep Impact&quot; (1998). Wood achieved international fame in the early 2000s for playing the hobbit Frodo Baggins in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy (2001–2003), based on the classic fantasy novel of the same name by English author J. R. R. Tolkien.

As an adult, Wood appeared in a wide range of films, including &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; (2004), &quot;Paris, je t&#x27;aime&quot; (2006), and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Feel at Home in This World Anymore&quot; (2017). His voice roles include &quot;Happy Feet&quot; (2006), &quot;The Legend of Spyro&quot; (2006–2008), &quot;9&quot; (2009), &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; (2012), &quot;&quot; (2012–2013), and &quot;Over the Garden Wall&quot; (2014). On television, Wood starred in the series &quot;Wilfred&quot; (2011–2014) and &quot;Dirk Gently&#x27;s Holistic Detective Agency&quot; (2016–2017).

Wood founded the record label Simian Records in 2005, which was dissolved in 2015. He directed the 2007 music video &quot;Energy&quot; for The Apples in Stereo. In 2010, Wood co-founded a film production company for horror films, The Woodshed, renamed SpectreVision in 2013. Wood is a disc jockey, and has toured globally with his friend Zach Cowie as the duo Wooden Wisdom.

==Early life==

Wood was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on January 28, 1981, to Debbie () and Warren Wood, who operated a delicatessen together. He is of English, Danish, Irish, and German ancestry, and was raised Catholic. He has an older brother named Zachariah and a younger sister named Hannah. At age seven, Wood began modeling and taking piano lessons in his hometown. In elementary school, he appeared in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and played the title character in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. He served as a choirboy in a production of &quot;See How They Run&quot;. Wood&#x27;s parents sold their delicatessen in 1989 and the family, without his father, moved to Los Angeles to allow him to pursue an acting career; they divorced when he was 15.

==Career==

===1988–1999: Early work===

Wood modeled and appeared in local commercials; his first appearance was in the music video for Paula Abdul&#x27;s &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot;, directed by David Fincher. This was followed by a pivotal role in the made-for-TV film, &quot;Child in the Night,&quot; and a minor role in &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot;, as a boy from a futuristic 2015 who teases Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) for playing an arcade game because &quot;you have to use your hands&quot;. Nine-year-old Wood auditioned for a role in &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot;, but was told by director Ivan Reitman that his performance was not believable, which Wood later said was &quot;a harsh thing to say to a nine-year-old.&quot;

Playing Aidan Quinn&#x27;s son in &quot;Avalon&quot; garnered professional attention for Wood; the film received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for four Academy Awards. A small part in Richard Gere&#x27;s &quot;Internal Affairs&quot; was followed by the role of a boy who brings estranged couple Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson back together in &quot;Paradise&quot; (1991). In 1992, Wood co-starred with Mel Gibson and Jamie Lee Curtis in &quot;Forever Young&quot;, and with Joseph Mazzello in &quot;Radio Flyer&quot;.

In 1993, Wood played the title character in Disney&#x27;s adaptation of Mark Twain&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Adventures of Huck Finn&quot;, and co-starred with Macaulay Culkin in the psychological thriller &quot;The Good Son&quot;. The following year, he starred in &quot;The War&quot;, alongside Kevin Costner. Although the film received mostly negative reviews, Wood&#x27;s performance earned praise. Roger Ebert&#x27;s review of the film praised Wood highly, stating that Wood &quot;has emerged, I believe, as the most talented actor, in his age group, in Hollywood history.&quot;

Wood&#x27;s title role—opposite Bruce Willis—in the Robert Reiner film &quot;North&quot; (1994) was followed by a Super Bowl commercial for Lay&#x27;s &quot;Wavy&quot; potato chips (with Dan Quayle). In 1995, Wood appeared in the music video for The Cranberries&#x27; &quot;Ridiculous Thoughts&quot;, played the lead role in &quot;Flipper&quot;, and co-starred in Ang Lee&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;The Ice Storm&quot;. In 1996, he guest starred in the episode entitled &quot;The True Test&quot; in &quot;&quot;. In 1997, Wood played Jack &quot;The Artful Dodger&quot; Dawkins in a made-for-TV adaptation of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, alongside Richard Dreyfuss. The following year, he had a leading role in the sci-fi disaster film &quot;Deep Impact,&quot; and a starring role in &quot;The Faculty&quot;, directed by Robert Rodriguez. In 1999, Wood played a suburban white teenager who affects hip-hop lingo in James Toback&#x27;s &quot;Black and White&quot;, and a junior hitman in &quot;Chain of Fools&quot;.

===1999–2003: &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;===

Wood played Frodo Baggins in the 2001 &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, the first installment of Peter Jackson&#x27;s adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s multi-volume novel. Wood was a fan of the Hobbit, and he sent in an audition tape of himself dressed as Frodo, reading lines from the novel. He was selected from 150 actors who auditioned. Wood was the first actor to be cast. This gave Wood top billing, alongside a cast full of stars. 
The &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy was filmed in New Zealand; principal photography took over a year, and pick-up shooting continued annually for the next four years. Before the cast left the country, Jackson gave Wood two gifts: one of the One Ring props used on the set and Sting, Frodo&#x27;s sword. He was also given a pair of prosthetic &quot;hobbit feet&quot; of the type worn during filming.

In 2002, Wood lent his voice to the DTV release of &quot;The Adventures of Tom Thumb and Thumbelina&quot;. Later that year, the second part of Peter Jackson&#x27;s trilogy was released, titled &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot;. 
In 2003, Wood starred in the DTV film &quot;All I Want&quot; and cameoed as &#x27;The Guy&#x27; in &quot;Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over&quot;. The concluding chapter of the &quot;Rings&quot; trilogy, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; was released in December of that year.

===2004–present===

Wood&#x27;s first role following his &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; success was in &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; (2004), in which he played Patrick, an unscrupulous lab technician who pursues Kate Winslet. The film received the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay in 2005. He next played the silent serial killer Kevin in Robert Rodriguez&#x27;s adaptation of Frank Miller&#x27;s comic book series, &quot;Sin City&quot; (2005). Wood&#x27;s audition for the role only consisted of staring at a film camera while passages from the graphic novel were read. On May 12, 2005, Wood hosted &quot;MTV Presents: The Next Generation Xbox Revealed&quot; for the launch of the Xbox 360 video game console.

In &quot;Everything Is Illuminated&quot; (2005), Wood starred as a young Jewish-American man on a quest to find the woman who saved his grandfather during World War II. It was based on the novel of the same name by Jonathan Safran Foer. In &quot;Green Street&quot; (also 2005), he played an American college student who joins a violent British football firm. Both had limited release but were critically acclaimed.

Wood shot a small part in &quot;Paris, je t&#x27;aime&quot; (2006), which consists of 18 five-minute sections, each directed by a different director. Wood&#x27;s section, called &quot;Quartier de la Madeleine&quot;, was directed by Vincenzo Natali. The film played at the Cannes Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival.

In George Miller&#x27;s animated musical &quot;Happy Feet&quot; (2006), Wood provided the voice of Mumble, a penguin who can tap dance, but not sing. &quot;Happy Feet&quot; grossed over $380 million worldwide, and received both the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and the BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film. Wood reprised his role for the film&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Happy Feet Two&quot; (2011).

Also in 2006, he was part of the ensemble cast of Emilio Estevez&#x27;s drama &quot;Bobby&quot;, a fictionalized account of the hours leading up to the June 5, 1968, shooting of U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy. In the film, Wood marries Lindsay Lohan&#x27;s character in order to avoid being drafted for the Vietnam War. &quot;Bobby&quot; screened in competition at the Venice Film Festival. Wood, along with his co-stars, received a nomination for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.

Later that year, Wood hosted the television special &quot;Saving a Species: The Great Penguin Rescue&quot; for Discovery Kids; he received a nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in Children&#x27;s Programming. That same year, it was announced that Wood was set to star in &quot;The Passenger&quot;, a biographical film about singer Iggy Pop. However, the project failed to come to fruition after years in development.

Wood has provided voiceovers for video games, including the voice of Spyro the Dragon in &quot;The Legend of Spyro&quot; game trilogy (2006–2008), as well as reprising Mumble in the game version of &quot;Happy Feet&quot; (2006–2011).

On January 4, 2007, Wood joined Screen Actors Guild president Alan Rosenberg in a live telecast to announce the nominees for the 13th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards. Later that year, he starred in &quot;Day Zero&quot;, a drama about conscription in the United States, which had its debut at the Tribeca Film Festival.

In &quot;The Oxford Murders&quot; (2008), a film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Guillermo Martínez, Wood played a graduate student who investigates a series of bizarre, mathematically based murders in Oxford. The following year, he voiced the lead in the animated feature film &quot;9&quot;, which was produced by Tim Burton.

Wood&#x27;s first starring television role came in the FX series, &quot;Wilfred,&quot; where he played Ryan Newman, who is described as &quot;an introverted and troubled young man struggling unsuccessfully to make his way in the world until he forms a unique friendship with Wilfred, his neighbor&#x27;s canine pet.&quot; The pilot episode was shot in the summer of 2010, and the series lasted four seasons, with the final episode airing in the U.S. on August 13, 2014. For his role, Wood received a nomination for the Satellite Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy in 2011.

In January 2011, it was confirmed that Wood had signed on to reprise the role of Frodo Baggins in &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot;, the first film of the &quot;Hobbit&quot; trilogy, directed again by Peter Jackson. The film was released the following year and grossed over $1 billion at the worldwide box office.

Wood featured in the Beastie Boys&#x27; 2011 music video for &quot;Make Some Noise,&quot; along with Seth Rogen and Danny McBride. He then starred in the Flying Lotus music video &quot;Tiny Tortures,&quot; where he played a recent amputee coming to grips with his new situation. The psychedelic video was described as &quot;menacing and magical.&quot;

In 2012, Wood had a supporting role in the romantic comedy &quot;Celeste and Jesse Forever&quot;, and starred in the horror film &quot;Maniac&quot;, for which he received the Fangoria Chainsaw Award for Best Actor. &quot;Maniac&quot; was mostly shot from a first person point of view of Wood&#x27;s character.

Wood played the leading role in the 2013 Hitchcockian suspense thriller &quot;Grand Piano&quot;. He voiced Shay, one of two main characters in the adventure game &quot;Broken Age&quot;, for which he received the 2014 &quot;Performance in a Comedy, Lead&quot; award from National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR).

This was followed by prominent roles in films &quot;The Last Witch Hunter&quot; (2015), opposite Vin Diesel; &quot;The Trust&quot; (2016), opposite Nicolas Cage; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Feel at Home in This World Anymore&quot; (2017), opposite Melanie Lynskey. The latter film was awarded the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize at Sundance in January 2017.

From 2016 to 2017, Wood co-starred with Samuel Barnett as Todd Brotzman in the BBC America series &quot;Dirk Gently&#x27;s Holistic Detective Agency&quot;.

They have spun at events such as the Bushmills Live 2012 festival at the Old Bushmills Distillery, the opening of the Brickell City Centre and at the pre-Emmy party at The London West Hollywood hotel.

Wood signed up to co-produce and star in the film &quot;Black Wings Has My Angel&quot;, based on the noir novel of the same name, with Anthony Moody and Rob Malkani of Indalo Productions.

In May 2006, Wood was ranked at No. 7 on &quot;Autograph Collector Magazine&quot; list of the &quot;10 Best Hollywood Autograph Signers.&quot;

On April 23, 2010, in a charitable gesture, Wood visited the Chilean town of Curepto, one of the hardest hit by the 8.8 magnitude earthquake that struck on February 27, 2010. He made personal visits to many of the victims and was accompanied by the First Lady of Chile, Cecilia Morel.

During a 2016 interview with &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Wood accused Hollywood of being organized by pedophiles who preyed on children within the industry, including many of his fellow child actors.

After the interview made international headlines, Wood clarified that he had &quot;no firsthand experience or observation of the topic&quot; and that his comments had been partly based on the documentary &quot;An Open Secret&quot; that he had seen.

<text>Heavenly Creatures is a 1994 New Zealand biographical film directed by Peter Jackson, from a screenplay he co-wrote with his partner, Fran Walsh. It stars Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet in their feature film debuts, with Sarah Peirse, Diana Kent, Clive Merrison and Simon O&#x27;Connor in supporting roles. The film blends elements of various genres, such as period drama, crime, psychological thriller, romance, and fantasy.

Based on the notorious Parker–Hulme murder case, &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; examines the relationship between two teenage girls—Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme—which culminates in the premeditated killing of Parker&#x27;s mother. The story&#x27;s events span the period from the girls&#x27; first meeting in 1952 to the carrying out of the crime, which took place in Christchurch, New Zealand on 22 June 1954.

&quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; debuted at the Venice Film Festival in September 1994, where it was awarded the Silver Lion. It went on to receive widespread critical acclaim, becoming one of the best-received films of that year. Reviewers praised most aspects of the production, with particular attention given to the work of the previously unknown Lynskey and Winslet, as well as Jackson&#x27;s directing. The film received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay in 1995.

==Plot==
In 1952 Christchurch, Juliet Hulme, an affluent 13-year-old English girl, transfers to a new school and befriends Pauline Parker, a 14-year-old girl from a working-class family. Bonding over a shared history of severe childhood disease and isolating hospitalizations, they develop an intense friendship. Pauline admires Juliet&#x27;s outspoken arrogance and beauty.

Unlike the peaceful intellectual life Juliet shares with her family, Pauline&#x27;s relationship with her mother, Honora, is hostile, and the two fight constantly. Pauline spends most of her time at the Hulmes&#x27;, where she feels accepted.

Together, Juliet and Pauline paint, write stories, make figurines, and eventually create a fantasy kingdom called Borovnia. It is the setting of the adventure novels they write together, which they hope to have published and made into films in Hollywood. Over time, it begins to be as real to them as the real world. Juliet introduces Pauline to the idea of &quot;the Fourth World,&quot; a Heaven without Christians where music and art are celebrated. Juliet believes she will go there when she dies.

During a day trip to Port Levy, Juliet&#x27;s parents announce their plan to go on a trip together, leaving Juliet by herself. Hysterical at the prospect of being left alone, Juliet experiences the Fourth World for the first time, perceiving it as a land where all is beautiful and she is safe. She asks Pauline to come with her, and this world also becomes visible to Pauline. This shared spiritual vision confirms their Fourth World belief and begins to affect their perception of events in the everyday world.

When Juliet is diagnosed with tuberculosis and sent to a clinic, she and Pauline begin writing to each other, not only as themselves but in the roles of the royal couple of Borovnia. During this time, Pauline has a sexual relationship with a lodger, making Juliet jealous. Their fantasy life becomes a useful escape from the real world, and the two engage in increasingly violent, even murderous, fantasies about people who oppress them. After Juliet is released from the clinic, their relationship intensifies. Wary of her attachment to Pauline, Juliet&#x27;s father speaks to Pauline&#x27;s parents, who take her to a doctor. The doctor suspects that Pauline is homosexual and uses it to explain her dramatic weight loss and increasing anger at her mother.

Juliet&#x27;s parents announce their intention to divorce and leave Christchurch, with Juliet to stay with a relative in South Africa. Increasingly distraught at the thought of separation, the two girls plan to run away together. When that plan becomes impossible, the two share a bathtub and talk about murdering Pauline&#x27;s mother, seeing her as the primary obstacle to their being together.

The two girls spend the last three weeks together at Juliet&#x27;s house. At the end of that time, Pauline returns home, and the two finalize plans for the murder. Honora plans a trip for the three of them to Victoria Park. After having tea, the three walk on a path down a steep hillside. When Honora bends over to pick up a pink charm the girls have deliberately dropped, Juliet and Pauline bludgeon her to death with a broken piece of brick hidden in an old stocking.

A textual epilogue reveals that Pauline and Juliet were arrested shortly after the murder, sentenced to five years in prison, as they were too young to face the death penalty, and released separately in 1959 on the condition that they never see each other again.

==Production==
===Development===
Fran Walsh suggested to Peter Jackson (who was noted for horror-comedy films) that they write a film about the notorious Parker–Hulme murder. Jackson took the idea to his long-time collaborator, producer Jim Booth (who died after filming). The three filmmakers decided that the film should tell the story of the friendship between the two girls rather than focus on the murder and trial. &quot;The friendship was for the most part a rich and rewarding one, and we tried to honour that in the film. It was our intention to make a film about a friendship that went terribly wrong,&quot; said Peter Jackson.

Walsh had been interested in the case since her early childhood. &quot;I first came across it in the late Sixties when I was ten years old. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; devoted two whole pages to the story with an accompanying illustration of the two girls. I was struck by the description of the dark and mysterious friendship that existed between them—by the uniqueness of the world the two girls had created for themselves.&quot;

Jackson and Walsh researched the story by reading contemporaneous newspaper accounts of the trial. They decided that the sensational aspects of the case that so titillated newspaper readers in 1954 were far removed from the story that Jackson and Walsh wished to tell. &quot;In the 1950s, Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme were branded as possibly the most evil people on earth. What they had done seemed without rational explanation, and people could only assume that there was something terribly wrong with their minds,&quot; states Jackson. To bring a more humane version of events to the screen, the filmmakers undertook a nationwide search for people who had had close involvement with Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme forty years earlier. This included tracing and interviewing seventeen of their former classmates and teachers from Christchurch Girls&#x27; High School. In addition, Jackson and Walsh spoke to neighbours, family friends, colleagues, police officers, lawyers and psychologists. Jackson and Walsh also read Pauline&#x27;s diary, in which she made daily entries documenting her friendship with Juliet Hulme and events throughout their relationship. From the diary entries, Jackson and Walsh perceived that Pauline and Juliet were intelligent, imaginative, outcast young women who possessed a wicked and somewhat irreverent sense of humour. In the film all of Pauline&#x27;s voice-overs are excerpts from her journal entries.

===Casting===
The role of Pauline was cast after Walsh scouted schools all over New Zealand to find a Pauline &#x27;look-alike&#x27;. She had trouble finding an actress who resembled Pauline and had acting talent before discovering Melanie Lynskey. Kate Winslet was among 175 girls to audition for the film and was cast after impressing Jackson with the intensity she brought to her part. The girls were both so absorbed by their roles that they kept on acting as Pauline and Juliet after the filming was done, as is described on Jackson&#x27;s website.

===Principal photography===
The entire film was shot on location in Christchurch in 1993. Jackson has been quoted as saying &quot;&quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; is based on a true story, and as such I felt it important to shoot the movie on locations where the actual events took place.&quot;

===Post-production===
The visual effects in the film were handled by the then newly created Weta Digital. The girls&#x27; fantasy life, and the ‘Borovnian’ extras (the characters the girls made up) were supervised by Richard Taylor while the digital effects were supervised by George Port. Taylor and his team constructed more than 70 full-sized latex costumes to represent the Borovnian crowds—plasticine figures that inhabit Pauline and Juliet&#x27;s magical fantasy world. &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; contains more than thirty shots that were digitally manipulated, ranging from the morphing garden of the ‘Fourth World’ to castles in fields and the sequences with &quot;Orson Welles&quot; (played by Jean Guérin).

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; garnered wide critical praise. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 95% score based on 108 reviews, with an average rating of 8.20/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Dark, stylish, and captivating, &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; signals both the auspicious debut of Kate Winslet and the arrival of Peter Jackson as more than just a cult director.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 86 out of 100 based on reviews from 31 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Nick Hyman, writing for Metacritic, thought that 1994&#x27;s Oscar-winning &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; was equally matched by &quot;Memorable Film(s) Not Nominated for Best Picture&quot;, including &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot;, of which Hyman said, &quot;Peter Jackson&#x27;s masterful blend of fantastical visions and a heartbreaking real-life murder tragedy has arguably never been topped.&quot;

Owen Gleiberman, writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, gave the film a B+ and said, &quot;Set in the early &#x27;50s, in the New Zealand village of Christchurch, this ripe hallucination of a movie – a rhapsody in purple – has been photographed in sun-drenched candy color that lends it the surreal clarity of a dream... There&#x27;s something bracing about the way that &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; serves up its heroines&#x27; fantasies with literal-minded brute force.&quot; Gleiberman complains that Jackson never quite explains &quot;why the two girls have metamorphosed into the &#x27;50s teenybop answer to Leopold and Loeb,&quot; yet concludes, &quot;Still, if the pleasures of &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; remain defiantly on the surface, on that level the movie is a dazzler.&quot;

===Box office===

&quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; had a limited box office success but performed admirably in various countries, including the United States, where it grossed a total of $3,049,135 during its limited run in 57 theatres; it grossed $5,438,120 worldwide. In the US it opened on two screens in New York City (Angelika Film Center and Lincoln Plaza) and had the biggest per-screen gross of the weekend with an average of $15,796, grossing $41,323 in its opening 5 days.

=== Accolades ===
&quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; was an Academy Award nominee in 1994 for Best Original Screenplay and won for Best British Actress at the 1st Empire Awards. It featured in a number of international film festivals, and received very favourable reviews worldwide.

Miramax International believed that reception at the Cannes Film Festival would make the film more appealing than it already was.

The film made top ten of the year lists in &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, and &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot;. It appears in Schneider&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.&quot;

The film also did exceptionally well at the 1995 New Zealand Film and Television Awards, being nominated for 10 awards and winning nine.
